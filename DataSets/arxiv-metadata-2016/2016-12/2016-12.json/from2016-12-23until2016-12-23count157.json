We analyze the possible IR\nphases in terms of various scaling exponents and the (ir)relevance of operators\nin the IR effective holographic theory with a dilaton. We compute the (finite)\nresistivity and encounter broad families of (in)coherent metals and insulators,\ncharacterized by universal scaling behaviour. The optical conductivity at zero\ntemperature and low frequencies exhibits power tails which can violate scaling\nsymmetries, due to the running of the dilaton. At low temperatures, our model\ncaptures features of random-field disorder.\n", "  We consider dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes, which are conformal\nto the static spherically symmetric metrics, and find new solutions of Einstein\nequations by symmetry considerations. Our study help us classify various\nconformal Black Holes that are embedded within a dynamic background into the\none class of solutions with the same conformal symmetry. In addition,\nThermodynamics, mathematical and gravitational properties are addressed. These\nsolutions point to have a better resolution of the meaning of the Black Holes\nin the dynamic background.\n", "  The COMPASS collaboration at CERN has measured diffractive dissociation of\n190 GeV/$c$ pions into the $\\pi^-\\pi^-\\pi^+$ final state using a stationary\nhydrogen target. A partial-wave analysis (PWA) was performed in bins of $3\\pi$\nmass and four-momentum transfer using the isobar model and the so far largest\nPWA model consisting of 88 waves. A narrow $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ signal is observed\nin the $f_0(980)\\,\\pi$ channel. We present a resonance-model study of a subset\nof the spin-density matrix selecting $3\\pi$ states with $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$ and\n$4^{++}$ decaying into $\\rho(770)\\,\\pi$ and with $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ decaying\ninto $f_0(980)\\,\\pi$. We identify a new $a_1$ meson with mass\n$(1414^{+15}_{-13})$ MeV/$c^2$ and width $(153^{+8}_{-23})$ MeV/$c^2$. Within\nthe final states investigated in our analysis, we observe the new $a_1(1420)$\ndecaying only into $f_0(980)\\,\\pi$, suggesting its exotic nature.\n", "  The propagation of non-linear electromagnetic waves is carefully analyzed on\na curved spacetime created by static spherically symmetric mass and charge\ndistribution. We compute how non-linear electrodynamics affects the geodesic\ndeviation and the redshift of photons propagating near this massive charged\nobject. In the first order approximation, the effects of electromagnetic\nself-interaction can be distinguished from the usual Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nterms. In the particular case of Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, we find\nthat these self-interaction effects might be important near extremal compact\ncharged objects.\n", "  Quantum mechanics establishes the ultimate limit to the scaling of the\nprecision on any parameter, by iden- tifying optimal probe states and\nmeasurements. While this paradigm is, at least in principle, adequate for the\nmetrology of quantum channels involving the estimation of phase and loss\nparameters, we show that estimat- ing the loss parameters associated with a\nquantum channel and a realistic quantum detector are fundamentally different.\nWhile Fock states are provably optimal for the former, we identify a crossover\nin the nature of the optimal probe state for estimating detector imperfections\nas a function of the loss parameter. We provide explicit results for on-off and\nhomodyne detectors, the most widely used detectors in quantum photonics\ntechnologies.\n", "  Open neutrino physics issues require precision studies, both theoretical and\nexperimental ones, and towards this aim coherent neutral current\nneutrino-nucleus scattering events are expected to be observed soon. In this\nwork, we explore $\\nu$-nucleus processes from a nuclear theory point of view\nand obtain results with high confidence level based on accurate nuclear\nstructure cross sections calculations. Besides cross sections, the present\nstudy includes simulated signals expected to be recorded by nuclear detectors,\ndifferential event rates as well as total number of events predicted to be\nmeasured. Our original cross sections calculations are focused on measurable\nrates for the Standard Model process, but we also perform calculations for\nvarious channels of the non-standard neutrino-nucleus reactions and come out\nwith promising results within the current upper limits of the corresponding\nexotic parameters. We concentrate on the possibility of detecting (i) supernova\nneutrinos by using massive detectors like those of the GERDA and SuperCDMS dark\nmatter experiments and (ii) laboratory neutrinos produced near the spallation\nneutron source facilities (at Oak Ridge National Lab) by the COHERENT\nexperiment. Our nuclear calculations take advantage of the relevant\nexperimental sensitivity and employ the severe bounds extracted for the exotic\nparameters entering the Lagrangians of various particle physics models and\nspecifically those resulting from the charged lepton flavour violating $\\mu^{-}\n\\rightarrow e^{-}$ experiments (Mu2e and COMET experiments).\n", "  The Synchronized Molecular-Dynamics simulation which was recently proposed by\nauthors [Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 4}, 041011 (2014)] is applied to the analysis of\npolymer lubrication between parallel plates. The rheological properties,\nconformational change of polymer chains, and temperature rise due to the\nviscous heating are investigated with changing the values of thermal\nconductivity of the polymeric liquid. It is found that at a small applied shear\nstress on the plate, the temperature of polymeric liquid only slightly\nincreases in inverse proportion to the thermal conductivity and the apparent\nviscosity of polymeric liquid is not much affected by changing the thermal\nconductivity. However, at a large shear stress, the transitional behaviors of\nthe polymeric liquid occur due to the interplay of the shear deformation and\nviscous heating by changing the thermal conductivity. This transition is\ncharacterized by the Nahme-Griffith number $Na$ which is defined as the ratio\nof the viscous heating to the thermal conduction at a characteristic\ntemperature. When the Nahme-Griffith number exceeds the unity, the temperature\nof polymeric liquid increases rapidly and the apparent viscosity also\nexponentially decreases as the thermal conductivity decreases. The conformation\nof polymer chains is stretched and aligned by the shear flow for $Na<1$, but\nthe coherent structure becomes disturbed by the thermal motion of molecules for\n$Na>1$.\n", "  In contrast to Hermitian systems, eigenstates of non-Hermitian ones are in\ngeneral nonorthogonal. This feature is most pronounced at exceptional points\nwhere several eigenstates are linearly dependent. In this work we show that\nnear this point a new effect takes place. It exhibits in energy increases in\nthe system when its parameters change periodically. This effect resembles\nparametric resonance in a Hermitian system but there is a fundamental\ndifference. It comes from the unique properties of the exceptional point that\nleads to parametric instability that occurs almost at any change in a\nparameter, while in the case of Hermitian systems it is necessary to fulfill\nresonance conditions. We illustrate this phenomenon by the case of two coupling\nwaveguides with gain and loss. This phenomenon opens a wide range of\napplications in optics, plasmonics, and optoelectronics, where the loss is an\ninevitable problem and plays a crucial role.\n", "  We introduce an arrival time operator which is self-adjoint and, unlike\npreviously proposed arrival time operators, has a close link to simple\nmeasurement models. Its spectrum leads to an arrival time distribution which is\na variant of the Kijowski distribution (a re-ordering of the current) in the\nlarge momentum regime but is proportional to the kinetic energy density in the\nsmall momentum regime, in agreement with measurement models. A brief derivation\nof the latter distribution is given. We make some simple observations about the\nphysical reasons for self-adjointness, or its absence, in arrival time\noperators and in the momentum operator on the half-line and we also compare our\noperator with the dwell time operator.\n", "  The energy transition towards an increased supply of renewable energy raises\nconcerns that existing electricity grids, built to connect few centralized\nlarge power plants with consumers, may become more difficult to control and\nstabilized with a rising number of decentralized small scale generators. Here,\nwe aim to study therefore, how local phase perturbations which may be caused by\nlocal power fluctuations, affect the AC grid stability. To this end, we start\nfrom nonlinear power balance equations and map them to complex linear wave\nequations, yielding stationary solutions with phases $\\varphi_i$ at generator\nand consumer sites $i$. Next, we study deviations from these stationary\nsolutions. Starting with an initially localized perturbation, it is found to\nspread in a periodic grid diffusively throughout the grid. We derive the\nparametric dependence of diffusion constant $D$. We apply the same solution\nstrategy to general grid topologies and analyse their stability against local\nperturbations. The perturbation remains either localized or becomes\ndelocalized, depending on grid topology, power capacity and distribution of\nconsumers and generators $P_i$. Delocalization is found to increase the\nlifetime of perturbations and thereby their influence on grid stability, while\nlocalization results in an exponentiallyfast decay of perturbations at all grid\nsites. These results may therefore lead to new strategies to control the\nstability of electricity grids.\n", "  Fixing the number of particles $N$, the quantum canonical ensemble imposes a\nconstraint on the occupation numbers of single-particle states. The constraint\nparticularly hampers the systematic calculation of the partition function and\nany relevant thermodynamic expectation value for arbitrary $N$ since, unlike\nthe case of the grand-canonical ensemble, traces in the $N$-particle Hilbert\nspace fail to factorize into simple traces over single-particle states. In this\npaper we introduce a projection operator that enables a constraint-free\ncomputation of the partition function and its derived quantities, at the price\nof an angular or contour integration. Being applicable to both bosonic and\nfermionic non-interacting systems in arbitrary dimensions, the projection\noperator approach provides closed-form expressions for the partition function\n$Z_N$ and the Helmholtz free energy $F_{\\! N}$ as well as for two- and\nfour-point correlation functions. While appearing only as a secondary quantity\nin the present context, the chemical potential potential emerges as a\nby-product from the relation $\\mu_N = F_{\\! N+1} - F_{\\! N}$, as illustrated\nfor a two-dimensional fermion gas with $N$ ranging between 2 and 500.\n", "  In complex materials various interactions play important roles in determining\nthe material properties. Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES) has\nbeen used to study these processes by resolving the complex single particle\nself energy $\\Sigma(E)$ and quantifying how quantum interactions modify bare\nelectronic states. However, ambiguities in the measurement of the real part of\nthe self energy and an intrinsic inability to disentangle various contributions\nto the imaginary part of the self energy often leave the implications of such\nmeasurements open to debate. Here we employ a combined theoretical and\nexperimental treatment of femtosecond time-resolved ARPES (tr-ARPES) and show\nhow measuring the population dynamics using tr-ARPES can be used to separate\nelectron-boson interactions from electron-electron interactions. We demonstrate\nthe analysis of a well-defined electron-boson interaction in the unoccupied\nspectrum of the cuprate Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$ characterized by an\nexcited population decay time constant $\\tau_{QP}$ that maps directly to a\ndiscrete component of the equilibrium self energy not readily isolated by\nstatic ARPES experiments.\n", "  By placing an atom into a cavity, the electromagnetic mode structure of the\ncavity is modified. In Cavity QED, one manifestation of this phenomenon is the\nappearance of a gauge-dependent diamagnetic term, known as the $A^2$\ncontribution. Although in atomic Cavity QED, the resulting modification in the\neigenmodes is negligible, in recent superconducting circuit realizations, such\ncorrections can be observable and may have qualitative implications. We revisit\nthe canonical quantization procedure of a circuit QED system consisting of a\nsingle superconducting transmon qubit coupled to a multimode superconducting\nmicrowave resonator. A complete derivation of the quantum Hamiltonian of an\nopen circuit QED system consisting of a transmon qubit coupled to a leaky\ntransmission line cavity is presented. We introduce a complete set of modes\nthat properly conserves the current in the entire structure and present a sum\nrule for the dipole transition matrix elements of a multi-level transmon qubit\ncoupled to a multi-mode cavity. Finally, an effective multi-mode Rabi model is\nderived with coefficients that are given in terms of circuit parameters.\n", "  Tensorial non-standard neutrino interactions are studied through a combined\nanalysis of nuclear structure calculations and a sensitivity $\\chi^2$-type of\nneutrino events expected to be measured at the COHERENT experiment, recently\nplanned to operate at the Spallation Neutron Source (Oak Ridge). Potential\nsizeable predictions on transition neutrino magnetic moments and other\nelectromagnetic parameters, such as neutrino milli-charges, are also addressed.\nThe non-standard neutrino-nucleus processes, explored from nuclear physics\nperspectives within the context of quasi-particle random phase approximation,\nare exploited in order to estimate the expected number of events originating\nfrom vector and tensor exotic interactions for the case of reactor neutrinos,\nstudied with TEXONO and GEMMA neutrino detectors.\n", "  Bearing the thermodynamic arguments together with the two definitions of mass\nin mind, we try to find metrics with spherical symmetry. We consider the\nadiabatic condition along with the Gong-Wang mass, and evaluate the $g_{rr}$\nelement which points to a null hypersurface. In addition, we generalize the\nthermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the\ncorresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the\n$g_{tt}$ element. Moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physical\nproperties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which\nshows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The\nobtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a\npolytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background. We also show\nthat if one considers the Misner-Sharp mass in the calculations, the\nSchwarzschild metric will be got. The relationship between the two mass\ndefinitions in each metric is studied. The results of considering the\ngeometrical surface gravity are also addressed. Our investigation shows that\nthe geometrical surface gravity's definition is not always compatible with the\nvalidity of the first law of thermodynamics on the horizons of spherically\nsymmetric static metrics.\n", "  We predict that a strong nonreciprocity in the resonance spectra of Dirac\nquantum dots can be induced by the Berry phase. The nonreciprocity arises in\nrelatively weak magnetic fields and is manifest in anomalously large\nfield-induced splittings of quantum dot resonances which are degenerate at\n$B=0$ due to time-reversal symmetry. This exotic behavior, which is governed by\nfield-induced jumps in the Berry phase of confined electronic states, is unique\nto quantum dots in Dirac materials and is absent in conventional quantum dots.\nThe effect is strong for gapless Dirac particles and can overwhelm the\n$B$-induced orbital and Zeeman splittings. A finite Dirac mass suppresses the\neffect. The nonreciprocity, predicted for generic two-dimensional Dirac\nmaterials, is accessible through Faraday and Kerr optical rotation measurements\nand scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  In this paper, we describe a new type of surgery for non-compact Riemann\nsurfaces that naturally appear when colliding two holes or two sides of the\nsame hole in an orientable Riemann surface with boundary (and possibly orbifold\npoints). As a result of this surgery, bordered cusps appear on the boundary\ncomponents of the Riemann surface. In Poincar\\'e uniformization, these bordered\ncusps correspond to ideal triangles in the fundamental domain. We introduce the\nnotion of bordered cusped Teichm\\\"uller space and endow it with a Poisson\nstructure, quantization of which is achieved with a canonical quantum ordering.\nWe give a complete combinatorial description of the bordered cusped\nTeichm\\\"uller space by introducing the notion of maximal cusped lamination, a\nlamination consisting of geodesics arcs between bordered cusps and closed\ngeodesics homotopic to the boundaries such that it triangulates the Riemann\nsurface. We show that each bordered cusp carries a natural decoration, i.e. a\nchoice of a horocycle, so that the lengths of the arcs in the maximal cusped\nlamination are defined as $\\lambda$-lengths in Thurston--Penner terminology. We\ncompute the Goldman bracket explicitly in terms of these $\\lambda$-lengths and\nshow that the Mapping Class Group acts as a generalized cluster algebra\nmutation. From the physical point of view, our construction provides an\nexplicit coordinatization of moduli spaces of open/closed string worldsheets\nand their quantization.\n", "  Recent observational evidence indicates that the center of our Milky Way\nharbours a super-massive object with ultra-strong radial magnetic field\n(Eatough et al., 2013). Here we demonstrate that the radiations observed in the\nvicinity of the Galactic Center (GC) (Falcke and Marko 2013) cannot be emitted\nby the gas of the accretion disk since the accreting plasma is prevented from\napproaching to the GC by the abnormally strong radial magnetic field. These\nfields obstruct the infalling accretion flow from the inner region of the disk\nand the central massive black hole in the standard model. It is expected that\nthe observed radiations near the Galactic Center cannot be generated by the\ncentral black hole.\n  We also demonstrate that the observed ultra-strong radial magnetic field near\nthe Galactic Center ( Eatough et al., 2013) cannot be generated by the -\nturbulence dynamo mechanism of Parker since preliminary qualitative estimate in\nterms of this mechanism gives a magnetic field strength six orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the observed field strength at . However, both these difficulties\nor the dilemma of the standard model can be overcome if the central black hole\nin the standard model is replaced by a supper-massive stellar object containing\nmagnetic monopoles ( SMSOMM, Peng and Chou, 2001). The observed power peaking\nof the thermal radiation is essentially the same as our theoretical prediction.\nIn addition, the discovery of the ultra-strong radial magnetic field near the\nGalactic Center can be naturally explained and is consistent with the\nprediction of our model( Peng and Chou 2001). Furthermore, the observed\nultra-strong radial magnetic field in the vicinity of the Galactic Center may\nbe considered as the astronomical evidence for the existence of magnetic\nmonopoles as predicted by the Grand Unified Theory of particle physics.\n", "  We review high energy symmetries of string theory at both the fixed angle or\nGross regime (GR) and the fixed momentum transfer or Regge regime (RR). We\ncalculated in details high energy string scattering amplitudes at arbitrary\nmass levels for both regimes. We discovered infinite linear relations among\nfixed angle string amplitudes conjectured by Gross in 1988 from decoupling of\nhigh energy zero-norm states (ZNS), and infinite recurrence relations among\nRegge string amplitudes from Kummer function U and Appell function F_1.\nHowever, the linear relations we obtained in the GR corrected [27-32] the\nsaddle point calculations of Gross, Gross and Mende and Gross and Manes [1-5].\nOur results were consistent with the decoupling of high energy ZNS or unitarity\nof the theory while those of them were not. In addition, for the case of high\nenergy closed string scatterings, our results [36] differ from theirs by an\noscillating prefactor which was crucial to recover the KLT relation valid for\nall energies. In the GR/RR regime, all high energy string amplitudes can be\nsolved by these linear/recurrence relations so that all GR/RR string amplitudes\ncan be expressed in terms of one single GR/RR string amplitude. In addition, we\nfound an interesting link between string amplitudes of the two regimes, and\ndiscovered that at each mass level the ratios among fixed angle amplitudes can\nbe extracted from Regge string scattering amplitudes. This result enables us to\nargue that the known SL(5,C) dynamical symmetry of the Appell function F_1 is\ncrucial to probe high energy spacetime symmetry of string theory.\n", "  The coherence power of a quantum channel, that is, its ability to increase\nthe coherence of input states, is a fundamental concept within the framework of\nthe resource theory of coherence. In this note we discuss various possible\ndefinitions of coherence power. Then we prove that the coherence power of a\nunitary operator acting on a qubit, computed with respect to the\n$l_1$-coherence measure, can be calculated by maximizing its coherence gain\nover pure incoherent states. We proceed to show that this result fails for\ndimensions N>2, that is, the maximal coherence gain is found when acting on a\nstate with non-vanishing coherence.\n", "  Living organisms are inherently out-of-equilibrium systems. We employ new\ndevelopments in stochastic energetics and rely on a minimal microscopic model\nto predict the amount of mechanical energy dissipated by such dynamics. Our\nmodel includes complex rheological effects and nonequilibrium stochastic\nforces. By performing active microrheology and tracking micron-sized vesicles\nin the cytoplasm of living oocytes, we provide unprecedented measurements of\nthe spectrum of dissipated energy. We show that our model is fully consistent\nwith the experimental data, and we use it to offer predictions for the\ninjection and dissipation energy scales involved in active fluctuations.\n", "  A prominent outburst of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C~454.3 was observed\nin 2014 June with the \\emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope. This outburst was\ncharacterized by a three-stage light-curve pattern---plateau, flare and\npost-flare---that occurred from 2014 May to July, in a similar pattern as\nobserved during the exceptional outburst in 2010 November. The highest flux of\nthe outburst reported in this paper occurred during 2014 June 7--29, showing a\nmultiple-peak structure in the light-curves. The average flux in these 22 days\nwas found to be $F[E > 100~\\mathrm{MeV}] = (7.2 \\pm 0.2) \\times\n10^{-6}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, with a spectral index, for a simple power law,\nof $\\Gamma = 2.04 \\pm 0.01$. That made this outburst the first $\\gamma$-ray\nhigh state of 3C~454.3 ever to be detected by \\emph{Fermi} with such a hard\nspectrum over several days. The highest flux was recorded on 2014 June 15, in a\n3 hr bin, at MJD 56823.5625, at a level of $F[E > 100~\\mathrm{MeV}] = (17.6 \\pm\n1.9) \\times 10^{-6}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The rise time of one of the short\nsubflares was found to be $T_r= 1200 \\pm 700$~s at MJD = 56827, when the flux\nincreased from 4 to 12 $\\times 10^{-6}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. Several photons\nabove 20 GeV were collected during this outburst, including one at 45 GeV on\nMJD 56827, constraining the $\\gamma$-ray emission region to be located close to\nthe outer boundary of the broad-line region, leading to fast flux variability.\n", "  A new pixel detector for the CMS experiment is being built, owing to the\ninstantaneous luminosities anticipated for the Phase I Upgrade of the LHC. The\nnew CMS pixel detector provides four-hit tracking while featuring a\nsignificantly reduced material budget as well as new cooling and powering\nschemes. A new front-end readout chip mitigates buffering and bandwidth\nlimitations, and comprises a low-threshold comparator. These improvements allow\nthe new pixel detector to sustain and improve the efficiency of the current\npixel tracker at the increased requirements imposed by high luminosities and\npile-up. This contribution gives an overview of the design of the upgraded\npixel detector and the status of the upgrade project, and presents test beam\nperformance measurements of the production read-out chip.\n", "  We investigate the hard edge scaling limit of the ensemble defined by the\nsquared singular values of the product of two coupled complex random matrices.\nWhen taking the coupling parameter to be dependent on the size of the product\nmatrix, in a certain double scaling regime at the origin the two matrices\nbecome strongly coupled and we obtain a new hard edge limiting kernel. It\ninterpolates between the classical Bessel-kernel describing the hard edge\nscaling limit of the Laguerre ensemble of a single matrix, and the Meijer\nG-kernel of Kuijlaars and Zhang describing the hard edge scaling limit for the\nproduct of two independent Gaussian complex matrices. It differs from the\ninterpolating kernel of Borodin to which we compare as well.\n", "  Landscape analyses often assume the existence of large numbers of fields,\n$N$, with all of the many couplings among these fields (subject to constraints\nsuch as local supersymmetry) selected independently and randomly from simple\n(say Gaussian) distributions. We point out that unitarity and perturbativity\nplace significant constraints on behavior of couplings with $N$, eliminating\notherwise puzzling results. In would-be flux compactifications of string\ntheory, we point out that in order that there be large numbers of light fields,\nthe compactification radii must scale as a positive power of $N$; scaling of\nthe radii and couplings with $N$ may also be necessary for perturbativity. We\nshow that in some simple string theory settings with large numbers of fields,\nfor fixed $R$ and string coupling, one can bound certain sums of squares of\ncouplings by order one numbers. This may argue for strong correlations,\npossibly calling into question the assumption of random distributions. We\nconsider implications of these considerations for classical and quantum\nstability of states without supersymmetry, with low energy supersymmetry\narising from tuning of parameters, and with dynamical breaking of\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  A framework for parameterization of the light response functions (LRFs) in a\nscintillation camera is presented. It is based on approximation of the measured\nor simulated photosensor response with weighted sums of uniform cubic B-splines\nor their tensor products. The LRFs represented in this way are smooth,\ncomputationally inexpensive to evaluate and require much less computer memory\nthan non-parametric alternatives. The parameters are found in a straightforward\nway by the linear least squares method. Several techniques that allow to reduce\nthe storage and processing power requirements were developed. A software\nlibrary for fitting simulated and measured light response with spline functions\nwas developed and integrated into an open source software package ANTS2\ndesigned for simulation and data processing for Anger camera type detectors.\n", "  We study certain non-linear generalisations of the Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation\nwhich admit static solitonic 2 solutions in absence of external potential\nacting on the particle. We consider a class of solutions that can be written as\na product of a solution of the linear Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation with a peaked\nquantum soliton, in a regime where the size of the soliton is quite smaller\nthan the typical scale of variation of the linear wave. In the non-relativistic\nlimit, the solitons obey a generalized de Broglie-Bohm (dB-B) guidance\nequation. In first approximation, this guidance equation reduces to the dB-B\nguidance equation according to which they move at the so-called de Broglie-Bohm\nvelocity along the hydrodynamical flow lines of the linear Schr{\\\"o}dinger\nwave. If we consider a spinorial electronic wave function a la Dirac, its\nbarycentre is predicted to move exactly in accordance with the dB-B guidance\nequation.\n", "  Domain patterns are simulated by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation\nwith an easy-axis anisotropy. If the Gilbert damping is removed from the LLG\nequation, it merely describes the precession of magnetization with a\nferromagnetic interaction. However, even without the damping, domains that look\nsimilar to those of scalar fields are formed, and they grow with time. It is\ndemonstrated that the damping has no significant effects on domain growth laws\nand large-scale domain structure. In contrast, small-scale domain structure is\naffected by the damping. The difference in small-scale structure arises from\nenergy dissipation due to the damping.\n", "  Metasurfaces are planar optical elements that hold promise for overcoming the\nlimitations of refractive and conventional diffractive optics1-3. Dielectric\nmetasurfaces demonstrated thus far4-10 are limited to transparency windows at\ninfrared wavelengths because of significant optical absorption and loss at\nvisible wavelengths. It is critical that new materials and fabrication\ntechniques be developed for dielectric metasurfaces at visible wavelengths to\nenable applications such as three-dimensional displays, wearable optics and\nplanar optical systems11. Here, we demonstrate high performance titanium\ndioxide dielectric metasurfaces in the form of holograms for red, green and\nblue wavelengths with record absolute efficiency (>78%). We use atomic layer\ndeposition of amorphous titanium dioxide that exhibits low surface roughness of\n0.738 nm and ideal optical properties. To fabricate the metasurfaces we use a\nlift-off-like process that allows us to produce highly anisotropic nanofins\nwith shape birefringence. This process is applicable to any optical element and\ncan be implemented using a broad class of materials.\n", "  Control of electron spin coherence via external fields is fundamental in\nspintronics. Its implementation demands a host material that accommodates the\nhighly desirable but contrasting requirements of spin robustness to relaxation\nmechanisms and sizeable coupling between spin and orbital motion of charge\ncarriers. Here we focus on Ge, which, by matching those criteria, is rapidly\nemerging as a prominent candidate for shuttling spin quantum bits in the mature\nframework of Si electronics. So far, however, the intrinsic spin-dependent\nphenomena of free electrons in conventional Ge/Si heterojunctions have proved\nto be elusive because of epitaxy constraints and an unfavourable band\nalignment. We overcome such fundamental limitations by investigating a two\ndimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined in quantum wells of pure Ge grown on\nSiGe-buffered Si substrates. These epitaxial systems demonstrate exceptionally\nlong spin relaxation and coherence times, eventually unveiling the potential of\nGe in bridging the gap between spintronic concepts and semiconductor device\nphysics. In particular, by tuning spin-orbit interaction via quantum\nconfinement we demonstrate that the electron Land\\'e g factor and its\nanisotropy can be engineered in our scalable and CMOS-compatible architectures\nover a range previously inaccessible for Si spintronics.\n", "  A parity deformed Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) is introduced, which describes\nan interaction of a two-level atom with a $\\lambda$-deformed quantized field.\nIn the rotating wave approximation (RWA), all eigen-values and eigen-functions\nof this model are obtained exactly. Assuming that initially the field is\nprepared in the Wigner cat state (WCS) and the two-level atom is in the excited\nstate, it has been shown that the atomic Rabi oscillations exhibit a\nquasi-periodic behavior in the collapse and revival patterns. The influence of\nthe deformation parameter on the time evolution of non-classical features of\nthe radiation field such as the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effect\nare also analyzed. Interestingly, the main finding here is that we can realize\nmaximally entangled atom-field states. In this note it is shown that the high\nfidelity is possible in the weak coupling regime, while the deformation\nparameter becomes large values.\n", "  Regarding the wide applications of dilaton gravity in the presence of\nelectrodynamics, we introduce a suitable Lagrangian for the coupling of dilaton\nwith gauge field. There are various Lagrangians which show the coupling between\nscalar fields and electrodynamics with correct special situations. In this\npaper, taking into account conformal transformation of Brans-Dicke theory with\nan electrodynamics Lagrangian, we show that how scalar field should couple with\nelectrodynamics in dilaton gravity. In other words, in order to introduce a\ncorrect Lagrangian of dilaton gravity, one should check at least two\nrequirements: compatibility with Brans-Dicke theory and appropriate special\nsituations. Finally, we apply the mentioned method to obtain analytical\nsolutions of dilaton-Born-Infeld and Brans-Dicke-Born-Infeld theories with\nenergy dependent spacetime.\n", "  Version 1.6.0 of the code SusHi is presented. Concerning inclusive CP-even\nHiggs production in gluon fusion, the following new features with respect to\nprevious versions have been implemented: expansion of the partonic cross\nsection in the soft limit, i.e. around $x=M_H^2/\\hat{s}\\to 1$; N$^3$LO QCD\ncorrections in terms of the soft expansion; top-quark mass suppressed terms\nthrough NNLO; matching to the cross section at $x\\to 0$ through N$^3$LO. For\nCP-even and -odd scalars, an efficient evaluation of the renormalization-scale\ndependence is included, and effects of dimension-5 operators can be studied,\nwhich we demonstrate for the SM Higgs boson and for a CP-even scalar with a\nmass of $750$ GeV. In addition, as a generalization of the previously available\n$b\\bar{b}\\to H$ cross section, SusHi 1.6.0 provides the cross section for\ncharged and neutral Higgs production in the annihilation of arbitrary heavy\nquarks. At fixed order in perturbation theory, SusHi thus allows to obtain\nHiggs cross-section predictions in different models to the highest precision\nknown today. For the SM Higgs boson of $M_H=125$ GeV, SusHi yields $48.28$ pb\nfor the gluon-fusion cross section at the LHC at $13$ TeV. Simultaneously,\nSusHi provides the renormalization-scale uncertainty of $\\pm 1.97$ pb.\n", "  Fault-tolerant quantum computation techniques rely on weakly correlated\nnoise. Here I show that it is enough to assume weak spatial correlations: time\ncorrelations can take any form. In particular, single-shot error correction\ntechniques exhibit a noise threshold for quantum memories under spatially local\nstochastic noise.\n", "  We investigate the problem of identifying $\\nu_\\tau$-induced reactions in\nlarge neutrino telescopes. We concentrate on events with tracks and showers\nwhere the respective energies $E_\\mu$ and $E_X$ are measured separately. Then\nwe compute analytically and numerically event distributions in two variables\n$r_l = E_X/E_l$ and $y'=E_{\\text{X}}/(E_{\\mu}+E_{X})$. We find that the\n$y'$-distribution is especially useful because in the $\\nu_\\tau$-induced\nreactions the distribution has a minimum at $y'=0.75$ and then increases as\n$y'\\rightarrow1$. This is different in $\\nu_\\mu$-induced reactions where the\n$y'$-distribution decreases monotonically. The results are demonstrated with\nfigures where one can estimate the required sensitivity of the experiments.\nAnother attractive property is that in several ratios the neutrino flux\nfactorizes and drops out. We hope the results of this article will be useful\nfor searches of tau (anti)neutrinos of energies above 100 GeV to several TeV in\nthe present and planned large volume neutrino telescopes.\n", "  By using Bogoliubov transformations to construct the ground states of\nfermionic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluids and weakly-interacting\nBose gases supporting Bose Einstein Condensation (BEC), their algebraic\nstructures and implications can be analyzed in detail. Both ground states are\ngeneralized squeezed coherent states saturating a generalized Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation, and they acquire quantized Berry phases when the\ncorresponding systems are transported along a closed path in their parameter\nspaces. While the Berry phase of the BCS ground state depends on the total\nparticle number, the Berry phase of the BEC ground state depends only on the\nparticles outside the BEC. The Berry phases are associated with magnetic\nmonopoles in the parameter spaces and we found that the Dirac quantization\ncondition is satisfied. Moreover, both ground states are entangled states of\nthe fermion or boson quanta and we found the entanglement entropy quantifying\nthe internal correlations. A fixed particle-number approach of fermionic\nsuperfluids does not saturate the generalized uncertainty relation, exhibits\ninternal entanglement, and gives corresponding Berry phase. In addition, the\nalgebraic structures of the ground states can be classified by the $q$-deformed\nHopf algebra, $\\bigoplus_{\\mathbf{k}}h_{q_{\\mathbf{k}}}(1)$ for bosons and\n$q$-deformed Hopf superalgebra $\\bigoplus_{\\mathbf{k}}h_{q_{\\mathbf{k}}}(1|1)$\nfor fermions, respectively.\n", "  We formulate the necessary conditions for the integrability of a certain\nfamily of Hamiltonian systems defined in the constant curvature two-dimensional\nspaces. Proposed form of potential can be considered as a counterpart of a\nhomogeneous potential in flat spaces. Thanks to this property Hamilton\nequations admit, in a general case, a particular solution. Using this solution\nwe derive necessary integrability conditions investigating differential Galois\ngroup of variational equations.\n", "  Future observations of 21~cm emission using HI intensity mapping will enable\nus to probe the large scale structure of the Universe over very large survey\nvolumes within a reasonable observation time. We demonstrate that the\nthree-dimensional information contained in such surveys will be an extremely\npowerful tool in searching for features that were imprinted in the primordial\npower spectrum and bispectrum during inflation. Here we focus on the \"resonant\"\nand \"step\" inflation models, and forecast the potential of upcoming 21~cm\nexperiments to detect these inflationary features in the observable power- and\nbispectrum. We find that the full scale Tianlai experiment and the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA) have the potential to improve on the sensitivity of\ncurrent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments by several orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  Bismuth chalcogenides are the most studied 3D topological insulators. As a\nrule, at low temperatures thin films of these materials demonstrate positive\nmagnetoresistance due to weak antilocalization. Weak antilocalization should\nlead to resistivity decrease at low temperatures; in experiments, however,\nresistivity grows as temperature decreases. From transport measurements for\nseveral thin films (with various carrier density, thickness, and carrier\nmobility), and by using purely phenomenological approach, with no microscopic\ntheory, we show that the low temperature growth of the resistivity is\naccompanied by growth of the Hall coefficient, in agreement with diffusive\nelectron-electron interaction correction mechanism. Our data reasonably explain\nthe low-temperature resistivity upturn.\n", "  In this paper we present \"citation success index\", a metric for comparing the\ncitation capacity of pairs of journals. Citation success index is the\nprobability that a random paper in one journal has more citations than a random\npaper in another journal (50% means the two journals do equally well). Unlike\nthe journal impact factor (IF), the citation success index depends on the\nbroadness and the shape of citation distributions. Also, it is insensitive to\nsporadic highly-cited papers that skew the IF. Nevertheless, we show, based on\n16,000 journals containing ~2.4 million articles, that the citation success\nindex is a relatively tight function of the ratio of IFs of journals being\ncompared, due to the fact that journals with same IF have quite similar\ncitation distributions. The citation success index grows slowly as a function\nof IF ratio. It is substantial (>90%) only when the ratio of IFs exceeds ~6,\nwhereas a factor of two difference in IF values translates into a modest\nadvantage for the journal with higher IF (index of ~70%). We facilitate the\nwider adoption of this metric by providing an online calculator that takes as\ninput parameters only the IFs of the pair of journals.\n", "  We study the imprints of massive particles with spin on cosmological\ncorrelators. Using the framework of the effective field theory of inflation, we\nclassify the couplings of these particles to the Goldstone boson of broken time\ntranslations and the graviton. We show that it is possible to generate\nobservable non-Gaussianity within the regime of validity of the effective\ntheory, as long as the masses of the particles are close to the Hubble scale\nand their interactions break the approximate conformal symmetry of the\ninflationary background. We derive explicit shape functions for the scalar and\ntensor bispectra that can serve as templates for future observational searches.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new approach to study the dark sector of the\nuniverse by considering the dark energy as emerging a q-deformed bosonic scalar\nfield which is not only interacting with the dark matter, but also\nnon-minimally coupled to gravity, in the framework of standard Einsteinian\ngravity. In order to analyze the dynamic of the system, we first give the\nquantum field theoretical description of the q-deformed scalar field dark\nenergy, then construct the action and the dynamical structure of these\ninteracting and non-minimally coupled dark sector. As a second issue, we\nperform the phase space analysis of the model to check the reliability of our\nproposal by searching the stable attractor solutions implying the late-time\naccelerating expansion phase of the universe.\n", "  We analytically obtain the free energy and thermodynamic geometry of\nholographic superconductors in $2+1$-dimensions. The gravitational theory in\nthe bulk dual to this $2+1$-dimensional strongly coupled theory lives in the\n$3+1$-dimensions and is that of a charged $AdS$ black hole together with a\nmassive charged scalar field. The matching method is applied to obtain the\nnature of the fields near the horizon using which the holographic free energy\nis computed through the gauge/gravity duality. The critical temperature is\nobtained for a set of values of the matching point of the near horizon and the\nboundary behaviour of the fields. The thermodynamic geometry is then computed\nfrom the free energy of the boundary theory. From the divergence of the\nthermodynamic scalar curvature, the critical temperature is obtained once\nagain. We then compare this result for the critical temperature with that\nobtained from the matching method.\n", "  To clarify the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism, we need to probe the\nHiggs self-couplings, which can be measured in Higgs pair productions. The\nassociated production with a vector boson is special due to a clear tag in the\nfinal state. We perform a fully differential next-to-next-to-leading-order\ncalculation of the Higgs pair production in association with a $W$ boson at\nhadron colliders, and present numerical results at the 14 TeV LHC and a future\n100 TeV hadron collider.\n", "  We present a new method for detecting superdiffusive behaviour and for\ndetermining rates of superdiffusion in time series data. Our method applies\nequally to stochastic and deterministic time series data (with no prior\nknowledge required of the nature of the data) and relies on one realisation (ie\none sample path) of the process. Linear drift effects are automatically removed\nwithout any preprocessing. We show numerical results for time series\nconstructed from i.i.d. $\\alpha$-stable random variables and from deterministic\nweakly chaotic maps. We compare our method with the standard method of\nestimating the growth rate of the mean-square displacement as well as the\n$p$-variation method, maximum likelihood, quantile matching and linear\nregression of the empirical characteristic function.\n", "  A detailed study of vortices is presented in Ginzburg-Landau (or Abelian\nHiggs) models with two complex scalars (order parameters) assuming a general\nU(1)$\\times$U(1) symmetric potential. Particular emphasis is given to the case,\nwhen only one of the scalars obtains a vacuum expectation value (VEV). It is\nfound that for a significantly large domain in parameter space vortices with a\nscalar field condensate in their core (condensate core, CC) coexist with\nAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) vortices. Importantly CC vortices are stable and\nhave lower energy than the ANO ones. Magnetic bags or giant vortices of the\norder of 1000 flux quanta are favoured to form for the range of parameters\n(\"strong couplings\") appearing for the superconducting state of liquid metallic\nhydrogen (LMH). Furthermore, it is argued that finite energy/unit length 1VEV\nvortices are smoothly connected to fractional flux 2VEV ones. Stable, finite\nenergy CC-type vortices are also exhibited in the case when one of the scalar\nfields is neutral.\n", "  We study the effects of a synthetic gauge field and pseudospin-orbit\ninteraction in a stacked two-dimensional ring-network model. The model was\nintroduced to simulate light propagation in the corresponding ring-resonator\nlattice, and is thus completely bosonic. Without these two items, the model\nexhibits Floquet-Weyl and Floquet-topological-insulator phases with\ntopologically gapless and gapped band structures, respectively. The synthetic\nmagnetic field implemented in the model results in a three-dimensional\nHofstadter-butterfly-type spectrum in a photonic platform. The resulting gaps\nare characterization by the winding number of relevant S-matrices together with\nthe Chern number of the bulk bands. The pseudospin-orbit interaction is defined\nas the mixing term between two pseudospin degrees of freedom in the rings,\nnamely, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes. It destroys the\nFloquet-topological-insulator phases, while the Floquet-Weyl phase with\nmultiple Weyl points can be preserved by breaking the space-inversion symmetry.\nImplementing both the synthetic gauge field and pseudospin-orbit interaction\nrequires a certain nonreciprocity.\n", "  We have computed the number of polarization modes of gravitational waves\npropagating in the Minkowski background in $f(R)$ gravity. This is three of two\nfrom transverse-traceless tensor modes and one from a massive trace mode, which\nconfirms the results found in the literature. There is no massless breathing\nmode and the massive trace mode corresponds to the Ricci scalar. A newly\ndefined metric tensor in $f(R)$ gravity satisfies the transverse-traceless (TT)\ncondition as well as the TT wave equation.\n", "  Processes in which a jet recoils against an electroweak boson complement\nstudies of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. As the boson does\nnot interact strongly it escapes the dense medium unmodified and thus provides\na more direct access to the hard scattering kinematics than can be obtained in\ndi-jet events. First measurements of jet modification in these processes are\nnow available from the LHC experiments and will improve greatly with better\nstatistics in the future. We present an extension of JEWEL to boson-jet\nprocesses. JEWEL is a dynamical framework for jet evolution in a dense\nbackground based on perturbative QCD, that is in agreement with a large variety\nof jet observables. We also obtain a good description of the CMS and ATLAS data\nfor y+jet and Z+jet processes at 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV.\n", "  Unsupervised neural network learning extracts hidden features from unlabeled\ntraining data. This is used as a pretraining step for further supervised\nlearning in deep networks. Hence, understanding unsupervised learning is of\nfundamental importance. Here, we study the unsupervised learning from a finite\nnumber of data, based on the restricted Boltzmann machine learning. Our study\ninspires an efficient message passing algorithm to infer the hidden feature,\nand estimate the entropy of candidate features consistent with the data. Our\nanalysis reveals that the learning requires only a few data if the feature is\nsalient and extensively many if the feature is weak. Moreover, the entropy of\ncandidate features monotonically decreases with data size and becomes negative\n(i.e., entropy crisis) before the message passing becomes unstable, suggesting\na discontinuous phase transition. In terms of convergence time of the message\npassing algorithm, the unsupervised learning exhibits an easy-hard-easy\nphenomenon as the training data size increases. All these properties are\nreproduced in an approximate Hopfield model, with an exception that the entropy\ncrisis is absent, and only continuous phase transition is observed. This key\ndifference is also confirmed in a handwritten digits dataset. This study\ndeepens our understanding of unsupervised learning from a finite number of\ndata, and may provide insights into its role in training deep networks.\n", "  There have been tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts toward\ndiscovery of quantum spin liquid phase in honeycomb-based-lattice materials\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling. Here the bond-dependent Kitaev interaction\nbetween local moments provides strong magnetic frustration and if it is the\nonly interaction present in the system, it will lead to an exactly solvable\nquantum spin liquid ground state. In all of these materials, however, the\nground state is in a magnetically ordered phase due to additional interactions\nbetween local moments. Recently, it has been reported that the magnetic order\nin hyperhoneycomb material, $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$, is suppressed upon applying\nhydrostatic pressure and the resulting state becomes a quantum paramagnet or\npossibly a quantum spin liquid. Using ab-initio computations and strong\ncoupling expansion, we investigate the lattice structure and resulting local\nmoment model in pressurized $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$. Remarkably, the dominant\ninteraction under high pressure is not the Kitaev interaction nor further\nneighbor interactions, but a different kind of bond-dependent interaction. This\nleads to strong magnetic frustration and may provide a platform for discovery\nof a new kind of quantum spin liquid ground state.\n", "  We present time-resolved spectral analysis of the steep decay segments of 29\nbright X-ray flares of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed with the Swift/X-ray\ntelescope, and model their lightcurves and spectral index evolution behaviors\nwith the curvature effect model. Our results show that the observed rapid flux\ndecay and strong spectral index evolution with time can be well fit with this\nmodel, and the derived characteristic timescales ($t_c$) are in the range of\n$33\\sim 264$ seconds. Using an empirical relation between the peak luminosity\nand the Lorentz factor derived from the prompt gamma-rays, we estimate the\nLorentz factors of the flares ($\\Gamma_{\\rm X}$). We obtain $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nX}=17\\sim 87$ with a median value of $52$, which is smaller than the initial\nLorentz factors of prompt gamma-ray fireballs. With the derived $t_c$ and\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm X}$, we constrain the radiating regions of 13 X-ray flares,\nyielding $R_{\\rm X}=(0.2\\sim 1.1)\\times 10^{16}$ cm, which are smaller than the\nradii of the afterglow fireballs at the peak times of the flares. A long\nevolution feature from prompt gamma-ray phase to the X-ray epoch is found by\nincorporating our results with a sample of GRBs whose initial Lorentz factors\nare available in literatures, i.e., $\\Gamma\\propto [t_{p}/(1+z)]^{-0.69\\pm\n0.06}$. These results may shed lights on the long term evolution of GRB central\nengines.\n", "  Space division multiplexing using multicore fibers is becoming a more and\nmore promising technology. In space-division multiplexing fiber network, the\nreconfigurable switch is one of the most critical components in network nodes.\nIn this paper we for the first time demonstrate reconfigurable space-division\nmultiplexing switching using silicon photonic integrated circuit, which is\nfabricated on a novel silicon-on-insulator platform with buried Al mirror. The\nsilicon photonic integrated circuit is composed of a 7x7 switch and low loss\ngrating coupler array based multicore fiber couplers. Thanks to the Al mirror,\ngrating couplers with ultra-low coupling loss with optical multicore fibers is\nachieved. The lowest total insertion loss of the silicon integrated circuit is\nas low as 4.5 dB, with low crosstalk lower than -30 dB. Excellent performances\nin terms of low insertion loss and low crosstalk are obtained for the whole\nC-band. 1 Tb/s/core transmission over a 2-km 7-core fiber and space-division\nmultiplexing switching is demonstrated successfully. Bit error rate performance\nbelow 10-9 is obtained for all spatial channels with low power penalty. The\nproposed design can be easily upgraded to reconfigurable optical add/drop\nmultiplexer capable of switching several multicore fibers.\n", "  We report a demonstration of a surface ion trap fabricated directly on a\nhighly reflective mirror surface, which includes a secondary set of radio\nfrequency (RF) electrodes allowing for translation of the quadrupole RF null\nlocation. We introduce a position-dependent photon scattering rate for a\n$^{174}$Yb$^+$ ion in the direction perpendicular to the trap surface using a\nstanding wave of retroreflected light off the mirror surface directly below the\ntrap. Using this setup, we demonstrate the capability of fine-tuning the RF\ntrap location with nanometer scale precision and characterize the charging\neffects of the dielectric mirror surface upon exposure to ultra-violet light.\n", "  We present all scalar-tensor Lagrangians that are cubic in second derivatives\nof a scalar field, and that are degenerate, hence avoiding Ostrogradsky\ninstabilities. Thanks to the existence of constraints, they propagate no more\nthan three degrees of freedom, despite having higher order equations of motion.\nWe also determine the viable combinations of previously identified quadratic\ndegenerate Lagrangians and the newly established cubic ones. Finally, we study\nwhether the new theories are connected to known scalar-tensor theories such as\nHorndeski and beyond Horndeski, through conformal or disformal transformations.\n", "  The primary task of the Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory (DHO) was to\nproduce the detailed and reliable photographic documentation of the solar\nphotospheric activity since 1958. This long-term effort resulted in various\nsolar catalogues based on ground-based and space-borne observations. The DHO\nhosts solar-image databases containing heritages of two former Hungarian\nobservatories. One of the sets of drawings was observed between 1872 and 1891\nat the \\'Ogyalla Observatory (now Hurbanovo, Slovakia) founded by Mikl\\'os\nKonkoly-Thege (1842-1916). We briefly summarize the history of the events that\nresulted in the longest photographic sunspot database available at the DHO at\npresent, and we show the basic role of Dr. Mikl\\'os Konkoly-Thege in this\nachievement.\n", "  We present a complete framework for numerical calculation of the power\nspectrum and bispectrum in canonical inflation with an arbitrary number of\nlight or heavy fields. Our method includes all relevant effects at tree-level\nin the loop expansion, including (i) interference between growing and decaying\nmodes near horizon exit; (ii) correlation and coupling between species near\nhorizon exit and on superhorizon scales; (iii) contributions from mass terms;\nand (iv) all contributions from coupling to gravity. We track the evolution of\neach correlation function from the vacuum state through horizon exit and the\nsuperhorizon regime, with no need to match quantum and classical parts of the\ncalculation; when integrated, our approach corresponds exactly with the\ntree-level Schwinger or 'in-in' formulation of quantum field theory. In this\npaper we give the equations necessary to evolve all two- and three-point\ncorrelation functions together with suitable initial conditions. The final\nformalism is suitable to compute the amplitude, shape, and scale dependence of\nthe bispectrum in models with |fNL| of order unity or less, which are a target\nfor future galaxy surveys such as Euclid, DESI and LSST. As an illustration we\napply our framework to a number of examples, obtaining quantitatively accurate\npredictions for their bispectra for the first time. Two accompanying reports\ndescribe publicly-available software packages that implement the method.\n", "  Any physical system can be viewed from the perspective that information is\nimplicitly represented in its state. However, the quantification of this\ninformation when it comes to complex networks has remained largely elusive. In\nthis work, we use techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics to\ndefine an entropy measure for complex networks and to develop a set of\ninformation-theoretic tools, based on network spectral properties, such as\nRenyi q-entropy, generalized Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences,\nthe latter allowing us to define a natural distance measure between complex\nnetworks. First we show that by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween an observed network and a parametric network model, inference of model\nparameter(s) by means of maximum-likelihood estimation can be achieved and\nmodel selection can be performed appropriate information criteria. Second, we\nshow that the information-theoretic metric quantifies the distance between\npairs of networks and we can use it, for instance, to cluster the layers of a\nmultilayer system. By applying this framework to networks corresponding to\nsites of the human microbiome, we perform hierarchical cluster analysis and\nrecover with high accuracy existing community-based associations. Our results\nimply that spectral based statistical inference in complex networks results in\ndemonstrably superior performance as well as a conceptual backbone, filling a\ngap towards a network information theory.\n", "  Measurements of the differential branching fraction and angular moments of\nthe decay $B^0 \\to K^+ \\pi^- \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ in the $K^+\\pi^-$ invariant mass\nrange $1330<m(K^+ \\pi^-)<1530~MeV/c^2$ are presented. Proton-proton collision\ndata are used, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 $fb^{-1}$\ncollected by the LHCb experiment. Differential branching fraction measurements\nare reported in five bins of the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system,\n$q^2$, between 0.1 and 8.0 $GeV^2/c^4$. For the first time, an angular analysis\nsensitive to the S-, P- and D-wave contributions of this rare decay is\nperformed. The set of 40 normalised angular moments describing the decay is\npresented for the $q^2$ range 1.1--6.0 $GeV^2/c^4$.\n", "  Soft supramolecular materials are promising for the design of innovative and\nhighly tunable adhesives. These materials are composed of polymer chains\nfunctionalized by strongly interacting moieties, sometimes called \"stickers\".\nIn order to systematically investigate the effect of the presence of\nassociative groups on the debonding properties of a supramolecular adhesive, a\nseries of supramolecular model systems has been characterized by probe-tack\ntests. These model materials, composed of linear and low dispersity\npoly(butylacrylate) chains functionalized in the middle by a single tri-urea\nsticker, are able to self-associate by six hydrogen bonds and range in\nmolecular weight (M n) between 5 and 85 kg/mol. The linear rheology and the\nnanostructure of the same materials (called \"PnBA3U\") was the object of a\nprevious study 1,2. At room temperature, the association of polymers via\nhydrogen bonds induces the formation of rod-like aggregates structured into\nbundles for M n \\textless{} 40kg/mol and the behavior of a soft elastic\nmaterial was observed (G'\\textgreater{}\\textgreater{}G \"and G'~$\\omega$ 0). For\nhigher M n , the filaments were randomly oriented and polymers displayed a\ncrossover towards viscous behavior although terminal relaxation was not reached\nin the experimental frequency window. All these materials show however similar\nadhesive properties characterized by a cohesive mode of failure and low\ndebonding energies (W adh \\textless{}40J/m 2 for a debonding speed of\n100$\\mu$m/s). The debonding mechanisms observed during the adhesion tests have\nbeen investigated in detail with an Image tools analysis developed by our group\n3. The measure of the projected area covered by cavities growing in the\nadhesive layer during debonding can be used to estimate the true stress in the\nwalls of the cavities and thus, to characterize the in-situ large strain\ndeformation of the thin layer during the adhesion test itself. This analysis\nrevealed in particular that the PnBA3U materials with M n \\textless{} 40 kg/mol\nsoften very markedly at large deformation like yield stress fluids, explaining\nthe low adhesion energies measured for these viscoelastic gels. 2\n", "  In this paper we present an analytical study on the synchronization dynamics\nobserved in unidirectionally-coupled quasiperiodically-forced systems that\nexhibit Strange Non-chaotic Attractors (SNA) in their dynamics. The SNA\ndynamics observed in the uncoupled system is studied analytically through phase\nportraits and poincare maps. A difference system is obtained by coupling the\nstate equations of similar piecewise linear regions of the drive and response\nsystems. The mechanism of synchronization of the coupled system is realized\nthrough the bifurcation of the eigenvalues in one of the piecewise linear\nregions of the difference system. The analytical solutions obtained for the\nnormalized state equations in each piecewise linear region of the difference\nsystem has been used to explain the synchronization dynamics though phase\nportraits and timeseries analysis. The stability of the synchronized state is\nconfirmed through the Master Stability Function. An explicit analytical\nsolution explaining the synchronization of SNAs is reported in the literature\nfor the first time.\n", "  We study the probability density function (PDF) of the cover time $t_c$ of a\nfinite interval of size $L$, by $N$ independent one-dimensional Brownian\nmotions, each with diffusion constant $D$. The cover time $t_c$ is the minimum\ntime needed such that each point of the entire interval is visited by at least\none of the $N$ walkers. We derive exact results for the full PDF of $t_c$ for\narbitrary $N \\geq 1$, for both reflecting and periodic boundary conditions. The\nPDFs depend explicitly on $N$ and on the boundary conditions. In the limit of\nlarge $N$, we show that $t_c$ approaches its average value $\\langle t_c \\rangle\n\\approx L^2/(16\\, D \\, \\ln N)$, with fluctuations vanishing as $1/(\\ln N)^2$.\nWe also compute the centered and scaled limiting distributions for large $N$\nfor both boundary conditions and show that they are given by nontrivial\n$N$-independent scaling functions.\n", "  When electrons are driven through unconventional magnetic structures, such as\nskyrmions, they experience emergent electromagnetic fields that originate\nseveral Hall effects. Independently, ground state emergent magnetic fields can\nalso lead to orbital magnetism, even without the spin-orbit interaction. The\nclose parallel between the geometric theories of the Hall effects and of the\norbital magnetization raises the question: does a skyrmion display topological\norbital magnetism? Here we first address the smallest systems with nonvanishing\nemergent magnetic field, trimers, characterizing the orbital magnetic\nproperties from first-principles. Armed with this understanding, we study the\norbital magnetism of skyrmions, and demonstrate that the contribution driven by\nthe emergent magnetic field is topological. This means that the topological\ncontribution to the orbital moment does not change under continous deformations\nof the magnetic structure. Furthermore, we use it to propose a new experimental\nprotocol for the identification of topological magnetic structures, by soft\nx-ray spectroscopy.\n", "  We present the results of the analysis of the impact of bulges on the radial\ndistributions of the different types of supernovae (SNe) in the stellar discs\nof host galaxies with various morphologies. We find that in Sa-Sm galaxies, all\ncore-collapse (CC) and vast majority of SNe Ia belong to the disc, rather than\nthe bulge component. The radial distribution of SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies is\ninconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Sm hosts, which is probably due to\nthe contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies. The radial\ndistributions of both types of SNe are similar in all the subsamples of Sa-Sbc\nand Sc-Sm galaxies. These results confirm that the old bulges of Sa-Sm galaxies\nare not significant producers of Type Ia SNe, while the bulge populations are\nsignificant for SNe Ia only in S0-S0/a galaxies.\n", "  Alkali-activated materials and related alternative cementitious systems are\nsustainable material technologies that have the potential to substantially\nlower CO$_2$ emissions associated with the construction industry. However, the\nimpact of augmenting the chemical composition of the material on the main\nbinder phase, calcium-silicate-hydrate gel, is far from understood,\nparticularly since this binder phase is disordered at the nanoscale. Here, we\nreveal the presence of a charge balancing mechanism at the molecular level,\nwhich leads to stable structures when alkalis (i.e., Na or K) are incorporated\ninto a calcium-silicate-hydrate gel, as modeled using crystalline 14{\\AA}\ntobermorite. These alkali containing charge balanced structures possess\nsuperior mechanical properties compared to their charge unbalanced\ncounterparts. Our results, which are based on first-principles simulations\nusing density functional theory, include the impact of charge balancing on the\noptimized geometries of the new model phases, formation energies, local bonding\nenvironments, bulk moduli and diffusion barriers of the alkali atoms within the\ncrystals.\n", "  Purpose: Photon counting (PC) computed tomography (CT) can provide material\nselective CT imaging at lowest patient dose but it suffers from suboptimal\ncount rate. A dynamic beam attenuator (DBA) can help with count rate by\nmodulating x-ray beam intensity such that the low attenuating areas of the\npatient receive lower exposure, and detector behind these areas is not\noverexposed. However, DBA may harden the beam and cause artifacts and errors.\nThis work investigates positive and negative effects of using DBA in PCCT.\nMethods: A simple PCCT with single energy bin, spectroscopic PCCT with 2 and 5\nenergy bins, and conventional energy integrating CT with and without DBA were\nsimulated and investigated using 120kVp tube voltage and 14mGy air dose. The\nDBAs were modeled as made from soft tissue (ST) equivalent material, iron (Fe),\nand holmium (Ho) K-edge material. A cylindrical CT phantom and chest phantom\nwith iodine and CaCO3 contrast elements were used. Image artifacts and\nquantification errors in general and material decomposed CT were determined.\nResults: Simple PCCT exhibited major image artifacts and quantification errors\nwhen DBAs were used. The artifacts and errors were decreased with 2bin\nspectroscopic PCCT and nearly eliminated with 5bin spectroscopic CT. The photon\nstarvation noise did present with Fe-DBA due to strong absorption of lower\nenergy photons. The 5bin PCCT with ST-DBA and Ho-DBA were nearly free of\nartifacts and photon starvation noise. The Ho-DBA better preserved low energy\nphotons and decreased beam hardening artifacts, and improved material\ndecomposition. Also, the Ho-DBA was also miniature having 1.4mm thickness and\n2cm length, much smaller than Fe-DBA. Conclusion: DBA fabricated from K-edge\nmaterial such as Ho can address count rate problem of PCCT and provide\nminiature size, minimal image artifacts, and improved material decomposition at\nlowest patient dose.\n", "  Experiments of electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECH) power scan in KSTAR\ntokamak clearly demonstrate that both the cut-off density for non-local heat\ntransport (NLT) and the threshold density for intrinsic rotation reversal can\nbe determined by the collisionality. We demonstrate that NLT can be affected by\nECH, and the intrinsic rotation direction follows the changes of NLT. The\ncut-off density of NLT and threshold density for rotation reversal can be\nsignificantly extended by ECH. The poloidal flow of turbulence in core plasma\nis in the electron and the ion diamagnetic direction in ECH plasmas and high\ndensity OH plasma, respectively. The auto-power spectra of density fluctuation\nare almost the same in the outer region for both ECH and OH plasmas. On the\nother hand, in the core region of ECH plasmas, the power spectra of the density\nfluctuations are broader than those of OH plasma. All these observations in\nmacroscopic parameters and micro fluctuations suggest a possible link between\nthe macro phenomena and the structural changes in micro-fluctuations.\n", "  Rashba spin-orbit interaction leads to a number of electromagnetic\ncross-correlation effects by inducing a mixing of electric and magnetic degrees\nof freedom. In this study, we investigate the optical properties of a magnetic\nRashba conductor by deriving an effective Hamiltonian based on an\nimaginary-time path-integral formalism. We show that the effective Hamiltonian\ncan be described in terms of toroidal and quadrupole moments, as has been\nargued in the case of insulator multiferroics. The toroidal moment turns out to\ncoincide with the spin gauge field induced by the Rashba field. It causes\nDoppler shift by inducing intrinsic spin current, resulting in anisotropic\nlight propagation (directional dichroism) irrespective of the polarization. The\nquadrupole moment on the other hand results in a magneto-optical phenomenon\nsuch as a Faraday effect for circularly-polarized waves.\n", "  We construct the holographic p-wave superfluid in Gauss-Bonnet gravity via a\nMaxwell complex vector field model and investigate the effect of the curvature\ncorrection on the superfluid phase transition in the probe limit. We obtain the\nrich phase structure and find that the higher curvature correction hinders the\ncondensate of the vector field but makes it easier for the appearance of\ntranslating point from the second-order transition to the first-order one or\nfor the emergence of the Cave of Winds. Moreover, for the supercurrents versus\nthe superfluid velocity, we observe that our results near the critical\ntemperature are independent of the Gauss-Bonnet parameter and agree well with\nthe Ginzburg-Landau prediction.\n", "  The problem of heat conduction in one-dimensional piecewise homogeneous\ncomposite materials is examined by providing an explicit solution of the\none-dimensional heat equation in each domain. The location of the interfaces is\nknown, but neither temperature nor heat flux are prescribed there. We find a\nsolution using the Unified Transform Method, due to Fokas and collaborators,\napplied to interface problems and compute solutions numerically.\n", "  The high dimensionality and computational constraints associated with\nfiltering problems in large-scale geophysical applications are particularly\nchallenging for the Particle Filter (PF). Approximate but efficient methods\nsuch as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) are therefore usually preferred. A\nkey element of these approximate methods is localization, which is in principle\na general technique to avoid the curse of dimensionality and consists in\nlimiting the influence of observations to neighboring sites. However, while it\nworks effectively with the EnKF, localization introduces harmful\ndiscontinuities in the estimated physical fields when applied blindly to the\nPF. In the present paper, we explore two possible local algorithms based on the\nEnKPF, a hybrid method combining the EnKF and the PF. A simulation study in a\nconjugate normal setup allows to highlight the trade-offs involved when\napplying localization to PF type of algorithms in the high-dimensional setting.\nExperiments with the Lorenz96 model demonstrate the ability of the local EnKPF\nalgorithms to perform well even with a small number of particles compared to\nthe problem size.\n", "  We study the prospects of detection at terrestrial and space interferometers,\nas well as at pulsar timing array experiments, of a stochastic gravitational\nwave background which can be produced in models of axion inflation. This\npotential signal, and the development of these experiments, open a new window\non inflation on scales much smaller than those currently probed with Cosmic\nMicrowave Background and Large Scale Structure measurements. The sourced signal\ngenerated in axion inflation is an ideal candidate for such searches, since it\nnaturally grows at small scales, and it has specific properties (chirality and\nnon-gaussianity) that can distinguish it from an astrophysical background. We\nstudy under which conditions such a signal can be produced at an observable\nlevel, without the simultaneous overproduction of scalar perturbations in\nexcess of what is allowed by the primordial black hole limits. We also explore\nthe possibility that scalar perturbations generated in a modified version of\nthis model may provide a distribution of primordial black holes compatible with\nthe current bounds, that can act as a seeds of the present black holes in the\nuniverse.\n", "  Dirac points in two-dimensional electronic structures are a source for\ntopological electronic states due to the $\\pm \\pi$ Berry phase that they\nsustain. Here we show that two rutile multilayers (namely\n(WO$_2$)$_2$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$ and (PtO$_2$)$_2$/(ZrO$_2$)$_n$, where an active\nbilayer is sandwiched by a thick enough (n=6 is sufficient) band insulating\nsubstrate, show semi-metallic Dirac dispersions with a total of four Dirac\ncones along the $\\Gamma-M$ direction. These become gapped upon the introduction\nof spin-orbit coupling, giving rise to an insulating ground state comprising\nfour edge states. We discuss the origin of the lack of topological protection\nin terms of the valley spin-Chern numbers and the multiplicity of Dirac points.\nWe show with a model Hamiltonian that mirror-symmetry breaking would be capable\nof creating a quantum phase transition to a strong topological insulator, with\na single Kramers pair per edge.\n", "  We investigate the consequences of acceleration of nuclei in jets of active\ngalaxies not far from the surface of an accretion disk. The nuclei can be\naccelerated in the re-connection regions in the jet and/or at the jet boundary,\nbetween the relativistic jet and its cocoon. It is shown that the relativistic\nnuclei can efficiently fragment onto specific nucleons in collisions with the\ndisk radiation. Neutrons, directed towards the accretion disk, take a\nsignificant part of energy from the relativistic nuclei. These neutrons develop\na cascade in the dense accretion disk. We calculate the neutrino spectra\nproduced in such hadronic cascade within the accretion disk. We propose that\nthe neutrinos produced in such scenario from the whole population of\nsuper-massive black holes in active galaxies can explain the extragalactic\nneutrino background recently measured by the IceCube neutrino detector,\nprovided that $5\\%$ fraction of galaxies is AGN and a few percent of neutrons\nreach the accretion disk. It is predicted that the neutrino signals in the\npresent neutrino detectors, produced in terms of such a model, are not expected\nto be detectable even from the nearby radio galaxies similar to M87.\n", "  Relativistic generalization of hydrodynamic theory has attracted much\nattention from a theoretical point of view. However, it has many important\npractical applications in high energy as well as astrophysical contexts.\nDespite various attempts to formulate relativistic hydrodynamics, no definitive\nconsensus has been achieved. In this work, we propose to test the predictions\nof four types of \\emph{first-order} hydrodynamic theories for non-perfect\nfluids in the light of numerically exact molecular dynamics simulations of a\nfully relativistic particle system in the low density regime. In this regard,\nwe study the propagation of density, velocity and heat fluctuations in a wide\nrange of temperatures using extensive simulations and compare them to the\ncorresponding analytic expressions we obtain for each of the proposed theories.\nAs expected in the low temperature classical regime all theories give the same\nresults consistent with the numerics. In the high temperature extremely\nrelativistic regime, not all considered theories are distinguishable from one\nanother. However, in the intermediate regime, a meaningful distinction exists\nin the predictions of various theories considered here. We find that the\npredictions of the recent formulation due to Tsumura-Kunihiro-Ohnishi are more\nconsistent with our numerical results than the traditional theories due to\nMeixner, modified Eckart and modified Marle-Stewart.\n", "  A comprehensive study of selected properties of four (TiZrNbCu)_1-xNi_x (x\n\\le 0.25) amorphous high entropy alloys (a-HEA) has been performed. The samples\nwere ribbons about 20 \\mum thick and their fully amorphous state was verified\nby X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. The surface morphology, precise\ncomposition and the distribution of components were studied with a Scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)\nattachment. The properties selected were the melting temperature (T_m), the low\ntemperature specific heat (LTSH), the magnetic susceptibility \\chi_exp and the\nYoung^,s modulus (E). Whereas LTSH and \\chi_exp were measured for the as-cast\nsamples, E was measured both for as-cast samples and relaxed samples (after a\nshort anneal close to the glass transition temperature). The LTSH showed that\nthe electronic density of states at the Fermi level, N_0(E_F), decreases with\nincreasing x, whereas the Debye temperature (\\theta_D) increases with x. This\nis similar to what is observed in binary and ternary amorphous alloys of early\ntransition metals (TE) with late transition metals (TL) and indicates that\nN_0(E_F) is dominated by the d-electrons of the TE. The LTSH also showed the\nabsence of superconductivity down to 1.8K and indicated the emergence of the\nBoson peak above 4K in all alloys.The free-electron like paramagnetic\ncontribution to \\chi_exp also decreases with x, whereas E, like \\theta_D,\nincreases with x, indicating enhanced interatomic bonding on addition of Ni.\nThe applicability of the rule of mixtures to these and other similar HEAs is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Recent computational efforts have shown that the current potential energy\nmodels used in molecular dynamics are not accurate enough to describe the\nconformational ensemble of RNA oligomers and suggest that molecular dynamics\nshould be complemented with experimental data. We here propose a scheme based\non the maximum entropy principle to combine simulations with bulk experiments.\nIn the proposed scheme the noise arising from both the measurements and the\nforward models used to back calculate the experimental observables is\nexplicitly taken into account. The method is tested on RNA nucleosides and is\nthen used to construct chemically consistent corrections to the Amber RNA force\nfield that allow a large set of experimental data on nucleosides and\ndinucleosides to be correctly reproduced. The transferability of these\ncorrections is assessed against independent data on tetranucleotides and\ndisplays a previously unreported agreement with experiments. This procedure can\nbe applied to enforce multiple experimental data on multiple systems in a\nself-consistent framework thus suggesting a new paradigm for force field\nrefinement.\n", "  We study the open string integrality invariants (LMOV invariants) for toric\nCalabi-Yau 3-folds with Aganagic-Vafa brane (AV-brane). In this paper, we focus\non the case of the resolved conifold with one out AV-brane in any integer\nframing $\\tau$, which is the large $N$ duality of the Chern-Simons theory for a\nframed unknot with integer framing $\\tau$ in $S^3$. We compute the explicit\nformulas for the LMOV invariants in genus $g=0$ with any number of holes, and\nprove their integrality. For the higher genus LMOV invariants with one hole,\nthey are reformulated into a generating function $g_{m}(q,a)$, and we prove\nthat $g_{m}(q,a)\\in\n(q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2})^{-2}\\mathbb{Z}[(q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2})^2,a^{\\pm 1/2}]$ for any\ninteger $m\\geq 1$. As a by product, we compute the reduced open string\npartition function of $\\mathbb{C}^3$ with one AV-brane in framing $\\tau$. We\nfind that, for $\\tau\\leq -1$, this open string partition function is equivalent\nto the Hilbert-Poincar\\'e series of the Cohomological Hall algebra of the\n$|\\tau|$-loop quiver. It gives an open string GW/DT correspondence.\n", "  In this proceeding we present the impact of the EW corrections on $t \\bar t$\ndistributions focusing on the effect of the photon PDF. We use the {\\sc\nNNPDF2.3QED} and {\\sc CT14QED} PDF sets, which include the photon PDF. We\ndiscuss a detailed comparison between the results obtained from these two PDF\nsets at NLO QCD+EW accuracy for 13 TeV, focusing on the top-quark $p_T$ and the\ntop-quark pair rapidity. We point out the differences between these two PDF\nsets and we show that the rapidity of the top-quark pair can be used in order\nto constrain the photon PDF predicted by the {\\sc NNPDF2.3QED} set.\n", "  New calculations of the quasi-bound state positions in $K^{-}K^{-}pp$ kaonic\nnuclear cluster are performed using non-relativistic four-body Faddeev-type\nequations in AGS form. The corresponding separable approximation for the\nintegral kernels in the three- and four-body kaonic clusters is obtained by\nusing the Hilbert-Schmidt expansion procedure. Different phenomenological\nmodels of $\\bar{K}N-\\pi\\Sigma$ potentials with one- and two-pole structure of\n$\\Lambda$(1405) resonance and separable potential models for\n$\\bar{K}$-$\\bar{K}$ and nucleon-nucleon interactions, are used. The dependence\nof the resulting four-body binding energy on models of $\\bar{K}N-\\pi\\Sigma$\ninteraction is investigated. We obtained the binding energy of the\n$K^{-}K^{-}pp$ quasi-bound state $\\sim$ 80-94 MeV with the phenomenological\n$\\bar{K}N$ potentials. The width is about $\\sim$ 5-8 MeV for the two-pole\nmodels of the interaction, while the one-pole potentials give $\\sim$ 24-31 MeV\nwidth.\n", "  Among the objectives toward large-scale quantum computation is the quantum\ninterconnect: a device which uses photons to interface qubits that otherwise\ncould not interact. However, current approaches require photons\nindistinguishable in frequency---a major challenge for systems experiencing\ndifferent local environments or of different physical compositions altogether.\nHere we develop an entirely new platform which actually exploits such frequency\nmismatch for processing quantum information. Labeled \"spectral linear optical\nquantum computation\" (spectral LOQC), our protocol offers favorable linear\nscaling of optical resources and enjoys an unprecedented degree of parallelism,\nas an arbitrary $N$-qubit quantum gate may be performed in parallel on multiple\n$N$-qubit sets in the same linear optical device. Not only does spectral LOQC\noffer new potential for optical interconnects; it also brings the ubiquitous\ntechnology of high-speed fiber optics to bear on photonic quantum information,\nmaking wavelength-configurable and robust optical quantum systems within reach.\n", "  GAIA leads us to step into a new era with a high astrometry precision of 10\nuas. Under such a precision, astrometry will play important roles in detecting\nand characterizing exoplanets. Specially, we can identify planet pairs in mean\nmotion resonances(MMRs) via astrometry, which constrains the formation and\nevolution of planetary systems. In accordance with observations, we consider\ntwo Jupiters or two super-Earths systems in 1:2, 2:3 and 3:4 MMRs. Our\nsimulations show the false alarm probabilities(FAPs) of a third planet are\nextremely small while the real two planets can be good fitted with\nsignal-to-noise ratio(SNR)> 3. The probability of reconstructing a resonant\nsystem is related with the eccentricities and resonance intensity. Generally,\nwhen SNR >= 10, if eccentricities of both planets are larger than 0.01 and the\nresonance is quite strong, the probabilities to reconstruct the planet pair in\nMMRs >= 80%. Jupiter pairs in MMRs are reconstructed more easily than\nsuper-Earth pairs with similar SNR when we consider the dynamical stability.\nFAPs are also calculated when we detect planet pairs in or near MMRs. FAPs for\n1:2 MMR are largest, i.e., FAPs > 15% when SNR <= 10. Extrapolating from the\nKepler planet pairs near MMRs and assuming SNR to be 3, we will discover and\nreconstruct a few tens of Jupiter pairs and hundreds of super-Earth pairs in\n2:3 and 1:2 MMRs within 30 pc. We also compare the differences between even and\nuneven data cadence and find that planets are better measured with more uniform\nphase coverage.\n", "  We consider the master equation of quantum Brownian motion and with the\napplication of the group invariant transformation we show that there exists a\nsurface on which the solution of the master equation is given by an autonomous\none-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger Equation.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the differences between classical logarithmic\nfidelity and quantum fidelity. The classical logarithmic fidelity is found to\nbe always extensive while the quantum one manifests distinct size dependence in\ndifferent phases. Illustrated by the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we\nfound numerically and analytically that the logarithmic fidelity scales like N\nin the symmetry-broken phase and scales like N^0 in the polarized phase. The\nsingular behavior around the critical point is also investigated.\n", "  In this note we prove decay for the spin $\\pm$1 Teukolsky Equations on the\nSchwarzschild spacetime. These equations are those satisfied by the extreme\ncomponents ($\\alpha$ and $\\underline \\alpha$) of the Maxwell field, when\nexpressed with respect to a null frame. The subject has already been addressed\nin the literature, and the interest in the present approach lies in the\nconnection with the recent work by Dafermos, Holzegel and Rodnianski on\nlinearized gravity [M. Dafermos, G. Holzegel and I. Rodnianski, The linear\nstability of the Schwarzschild solution to gravitational perturbations,\narXiv:1601.06467]. In analogy with the spin $\\pm2$ case, it seems difficult to\ndirectly prove Morawetz estimates for solutions to the spin $\\pm1$ Teukolsky\nEquations. By performing a differential transformation on the extreme\ncomponents $\\alpha$ and $\\underline \\alpha$, we obtain quantities which satisfy\na Fackerell--Ipser Equation, which does admit a straightforward Morawetz\nestimate, and is the key to the decay estimates. This approach is exactly\nanalogous to the strategy appearing in the aforementioned work on linearized\ngravity. We achieve inverse polynomial decay estimates by a streamlined version\nof the physical space $r^p$ method of Dafermos and Rodnianski. Furthermore, we\nare also able to prove decay for all the components of the Maxwell system. The\ntransformation that we use is a physical space version of a fixed-frequency\ntransformation which appeared in the work of Chandrasekhar. The present note is\na version of the author's master thesis and also serves the \"pedagogical\"\npurpose to be as complete as possible in the presentation.\n", "  A novel concept of a high-power magnetron transmitter allowing dynamic phase\nand power control at the frequency of locking signal is proposed. The\ntransmitter compensating parasitic phase and amplitude modulations inherent in\nSuperconducting RF (SRF) cavities within closed feedback loops is intended for\npowering of the intensity-frontier superconducting accelerators. The concept\nuses magnetrons driven by a sufficient resonant (injection-locking) signal and\nfed by the voltage which can be below the threshold of self-excitation. This\nprovides an extended range of power control in a single magnetron at highest\nefficiency minimizing the cost of RF power unit and the operation cost.\nProof-of-principle of the proposed concept demonstrated in pulsed and CW\nregimes with 2.45 GHz, 1kW magnetrons is discussed here. A conceptual scheme of\nthe high-power transmitter allowing the dynamic wide-band phase and\nmid-frequency power controls is presented and discussed.\n", "  A recent study analyzed the dynamic propagation of error in a PIV-based\npressure field calculation by directly analyzing the pressure Poisson equation\n(Pan et al. (2016)). We extend these results by quantifying the effect of the\nspatial dependence of the error profile in the data on the resultant error in\nthe pressure measurement. We design the \"worst case error\" for the pressure\nPoisson solver, providing an explicit example where relatively small errors in\nthe experimental data lead to maximal error in the calculated pressure field.\nThis calculation of the worst case error is equivalent to an Euler-Bernoulli\nbeam problem in one-dimension and the Kirchhoff-Love plate problem in\ntwo-dimensions, thus connecting the velocity-based pressure calculation, to\nelastic dynamics. These results can be used to minimize experimental error by\navoiding worst case scenarios and to design synthetic velocity errors for\nfuture PIV-pressure challenges.\n", "  Compton scattering processes are ideal to study electric and magnetic dipole\npolarizabilities of nucleons. These fundamental quantities parametrize the\nresponses of the internal degrees of freedoms to a monochromatic photon probe.\nIn this work, the inelastic channel $\\gamma d\\rightarrow \\gamma np$ is treated\nin $\\chi$EFT, with a focus on the kinematic region of the neutron quasi-free\npeak, where the momentum of the outgoing proton is small enough that it is\nconsidered to remain at rest. This provides access to the Compton scattering\nprocess $\\gamma n \\rightarrow \\gamma n$, from which the scalar polarizabilites\nof the neutron, $\\alpha_{E1}$ and $\\beta_{M1}$, are extracted. Using $\\chi$EFT,\ntriple differential cross-sections $d^3\\sigma/dE_nd\\Omega_{\\gamma'} \\Omega_n$\nin the photon energy range of 200-to-400 MeV are computed. The biggest\ncontribution comes from the impulse approximation, with small corrections\nstemming from final state interactions, meson exchange currents and\nrescattering. In this presentation, we report progress and preliminary results.\n", "  The symbiotic star AG Dra experienced a double-peaked outburst of 0.6\nmagnitudes in April and May 2016. Photometry and spectroscopy through the\noutburst showed the B-V colour index varying linearly with the V magnitude and\nenabled the temperature variation of the hot star to be calculated from the\nchanging flux in the H beta and He II 4686A emission lines.\n", "  X-rays have widespread applications in science and industry, but developing a\nsimple, compact, and high-quality X-ray source remains a challenge. Our\ncollaboration has explored the possible use of channeling radiation driven by a\n50 MeV low-emittance electron beam to produce narrowband hard X-rays with\nphoton energy of 40 to 140 keV. Here we present the simulated X-ray spectra\nincluding the background bremsstrahlung contribution, and a description of the\nrequired optimization of the relevant electron-beam parameters necessary to\nmaximize brilliance of the resulting X-ray beam. Results are presented from our\ntest of this, carried out at the Fermilab Accelerator Science & Technology\n(FAST) facility's 50-MeV low-energy electron injector. As a result of the beam\nparameters, made possible by the photo-injector based SRF linac, the average\nbrilliance at FAST was expected to be about one order of magnitude higher than\nthat in previous experiments.\n", "  Using quantum annealing to solve an optimization problem requires minor\nembeddings of a logic graph into a known hardware graph. In an effort to reduce\nthe complexity of the minor embedding problem, we introduce the minor set cover\n(MSC) of a known graph G: a subset of graph minors which contain any remaining\nminor of the graph as a subgraph. Any graph that can be embedded into G will be\nembeddable into a member of the MSC. Focusing on embedding into the hardware\ngraph of commercially available quantum annealers, we establish the MSC for a\nparticular known virtual hardware, which is a complete bipartite graph. We show\nthat the complete bipartite graph $K_{N,N}$ has a MSC of $N$ minors, from which\n$K_{N+1}$ is identified as the largest clique minor of $K_{N,N}$. The case of\ndetermining the largest clique minor of hardware with faults is briefly\ndiscussed but remains an open question.\n", "  Emittance exchange mediated by wedge absorbers is required for longitudinal\nionization cooling and for final transverse emittance minimization for a muon\ncollider. A wedge absorber within the MICE beam line could serve as a\ndemonstration of the type of emittance exchange needed for 6-D cooling,\nincluding the configurations needed for muon colliders. Parameters for this\ntest are explored in simulation and possible experimental configurations with\nsimulated results are presented.\n", "  Describing the geometry of the dual amplituhedron without reference to a\nparticular triangulation is an open problem. In this note we introduce a new\nway of determining the volume of the tree-level NMHV dual amplituhedron. We\nshow that certain contour integrals of logarithms serve as natural building\nblocks for computing this volume as well as the volumes of general polytopes in\nany dimension. These building blocks encode the geometry of the underlying\npolytopes in a triangulation-independent way, and make identities between\ndifferent representations of the amplitudes manifest.\n", "  Surveys have revealed many multi-planet systems containing super-Earths and\nNeptunes in orbits of a few days to a few months. There is debate whether in\nsitu assembly or inward migration is the dominant mechanism of the formation of\nsuch planetary systems. Simulations suggest that migration creates tightly\npacked systems with planets whose orbital periods may be expressed as ratios of\nsmall integers (resonances), often in a many-planet series (chain). In the\nhundreds of multi-planet systems of sub-Neptunes, more planet pairs are\nobserved near resonances than would generally be expected, but no individual\nsystem has hitherto been identified that must have been formed by migration.\nProximity to resonance enables the detection of planets perturbing each other.\nHere we report transit timing variations of the four planets in the Kepler-223\nsystem, model these variations as resonant-angle librations, and compute the\nlong-term stability of the resonant chain. The architecture of Kepler-223 is\ntoo finely tuned to have been formed by scattering, and our numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that its properties are natural outcomes of the\nmigration hypothesis. Similar systems could be destabilized by any of several\nmechanisms, contributing to the observed orbital-period distribution, where\nmany planets are not in resonances. Planetesimal interactions in particular are\nthought to be responsible for establishing the current orbits of the four giant\nplanets in the Solar System by disrupting a theoretical initial resonant chain\nsimilar to that observed in Kepler-223.\n", "  Lattice results are presented for the meson spectrum of 1+1 dimensional gauge\ntheory at large $N$, using the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai model. Comparison is made\nto the results obtained by `t Hooft in the light cone gauge.\n", "  A number of planetary nebulae show binary central stars and significant\nabundance discrepancies between values estimated from colisionally excited\nlines when compared to the same abundances estimated from recombination lines.\nOne approach to investigate this yet unsolved problem is using spatially\nresolved images of emission lines in an attempt to detect a possibly distinct\nmetal rich component in the nebula. In this work we present results of\nspatially resolved bundance analysis of NGC 6778 based on data gathered from\nVLT VIMOS-IFU. We discuss the spatial variations found as well as possible\nlimitations of the method in answering questions about abundance variations.\n", "  In the framework of a complete vector-like and universal gauged SU(3)_F\nfamily symmetry, we report a global region in the parameter space where this\napproach can account for a realistic spectrum of quark masses and mixing in a 4\nx 4 non-unitary V_{CKM}, as well as for the known charged lepton masses and the\nsquared neutrino mass differences reported from neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. The $SU(3)_F$ family symmetry is broken spontaneously in two\nstages by heavy SM singlet scalars, whose hierarchy of scales yield and\napproximate SU(2)_F global symmetry associated to the almost degenerate boson\nmasses of the order of the lower scale of the SU(3)_F SSB. The gauge symmetry,\nthe fermion content, and the transformation of the scalar fields, all together,\navoid Yukawa couplings between SM fermions. Therefore, in this scenario\nordinary heavy fermions, top and bottom quarks and tau lepton, become massive\nat tree level from Dirac See-saw mechanisms, while light fermions, including\nlight neutrinos, obtain masses from radiative corrections mediated by the\nmassive gauge bosons of the SU(3)_F family symmetry. The displayed fit\nparameter space region solution for fermion masses and mixing yield the\nvector-like fermion masses: M_D \\approx 3.2 \\,TeV, M_U \\approx 6.9 \\,TeV, M_E\n\\approx 21.6 \\,TeV, SU(2)_F family gauge boson masses of $\\mathcal{O} (2 TeV)$,\nand the squared neutrino mass differences: m_2^2-m_1^2 \\approx 7.5 x\n10^{-5}\\;eV^2, m_3^2-m_2^2 \\approx 2.2 x 10^{-3}\\;eV^2, m_4^2-m_1^2 \\approx\n0.82\\;eV^2.\n", "  We present the systematical decomposition results of three-dimensional (3D)\nfragmentation functions (FFs) from parton correlators for spin-1 hadron. We\nchoose one of the best process $e^+e^-\\to V\\pi X$ to study the 3D and tensor\npolarization dependent FFs. By making a general kinematic analysis we show that\nthe cross section is expressed by 81 independent structure functions, and get\nthe results of the azimuthal and spin asymmetries. We also present the parton\nmodel results for this process and express the results in terms of the 3D FFs.\nBased on this formalism, we also give the numerical results of hadron\nlongitudinal polarizations and predict the energy dependence.\n", "  An important step in quantum simulation is to measure the many-body\ncorrelations of the simulated model. For a practical quantum simulator composed\nof finite number of qubits and cavities, in contrast to ideal many-body systems\nin the thermodynamic limit, a measurement device can generate strong backaction\non the simulator, which could prevent the accurate readout of the correlation\nfunctions. Here we calculate the readout of a detector coupled to an analog\nquantum simulator. We show that reliable characterization of the many-body\ncorrelations in the simulator can be achieved when the coupling operators obey\nthe Wick's theorem. Our results are illustrated with two examples: a simulator\nfor an harmonic oscillator and a simulator for the free electron gas.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to outline a general-purpose scalable\nimplementation of Shor's period finding algorithm using fundamental quantum\ngates, and to act as a blueprint for linear optical implementations of Shor's\nalgorithm for both general and specific values of N. This offers a broader view\nof a problem often overlooked in favour of compiled versions of the algorithm.\n", "  To overcome the resolution limit of conventional optics, near field imaging\ntechniques using a negative index flat lens (NIFL) have been previously\ndeveloped that amplify the evanescent components of the incident field. Here, a\ntechnique is developed and demonstrated to compensate for losses in a non-ideal\nNIFL by determining the transfer function of the lens and subsequently applying\nthe inverse to the unresolved raw image. The result is a compensated image with\nsub-diffraction-limited resolution.\n", "  In this paper, we develop and analyze a minimal model for a 2D network of\ncross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors, representing the cortical\ncytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. We implement coarse-grained representations\nof force production by myosin motors and stress dissipation through an\neffective cross-link friction and filament turnover. We use this model to\ncharacterize how the sustained production of active stress, and the steady\ndissipation of elastic stress, depend individually on motor activity, effective\ncross-link friction and filament turnover. Then we combine these results to\ngain insights into how microscopic network parameters control steady state flow\nproduced by asymmetric distributions of motor activity. Our results provide a\nframework for understanding how local modulation of microscopic interactions\nwithin contractile networks control macroscopic quantities like active stress\nand effective viscosity to control cortical deformation and flow at cellular\nscales.\n", "  We study translational and rotational diffusion of anisotropic gold\nnanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in the bulk of a nematic liquid crystal fluid\nhost. Experimental data reveal strong anisotropy of translational diffusion\nwith respect to the uniform far-field director, which is dependent on shape and\nsurface functionalization of colloids as well as on their ground-state\nalignment. For example, elongated NPs aligned parallel to the far-field\ndirector translationally diffuse more rapidly along the director whereas\ndiffusion of NPs oriented normal to the director is faster in the direction\nperpendicular to it while they are also undergoing elasticity-constrained\nrotational diffusion. To understand physical origins of these rich diffusion\nproperties of anisotropic nanocolloids in uniaxially anisotropic nematic fluid\nmedia, we compare them to diffusion of prolate and oblate ellipsoidal particles\nin isotropic fluids as well as to diffusion of shape-isotropic particles in\nnematic fluids. We also show that surface functionalization of NPs with\nphotosensitive azobenzene groups allows for in situ control of their\ndiffusivity through trans-cis isomerization that changes surface anchoring.\n", "  We demonstrate scaffolding of plasmonic nanoparticles by topological defects\ninduced by colloidal microspheres to match their surface boundary conditions\nwith a uniform far-field alignment in a liquid crystal host. Displacing\nenergetically costly liquid crystal regions of reduced order, anisotropic\nnanoparticles with concave or convex shapes not only stably localize in defects\nbut also self-orient with respect to the microsphere surface. Using laser\ntweezers, we manipulate the ensuing nanoparticle-microsphere colloidal dimers,\nprobing the strength of elastic binding and demonstrating self-assembly of\nhierarchical colloidal superstructures such as chains and arrays.\n", "  We report a visible-range nonlinear photoluminescence (PL) from graphene\noxide (GO) flakes excited by near-infrared femtosecond laser light. PL\nintensity has nonlinear dependence on the laser power, implying a multiphoton\nexcitation process, and also strongly depends on a linear polarization\norientation of excitation light, being at maximum when it is parallel to\nflakes. We show that PL can be used for a fully three-dimensional label-free\nimaging of isotropic, nematic, and lamellar liquid crystalline dispersions of\nGO flakes in water. This nonlinear PL is of interest for applications in direct\nlabel-free imaging of composite materials and study of orientational ordering\nin mesomorphic phases formed by these flakes, as well as in biomedical and\nsensing applications utilizing GO.\n", "  The neural network-based approach, presented in this paper, was developed for\nthe analysis of peak profiles and for the prediction of base profile\ncharacteristics, such as width, asymmetry, asymptotic (\"peak tales\"), etc. of\nthe observed distributions. The obtained parameters can be used as the initial\nparameters in the peak decomposition applications. The neural network\narchitecture, presented here, was designed for the analysis of one particular\ntype of peak profiles, the Voigt type distributions (symmetrical and\nasymmetrical), and is suitable for a variety of applications, such as x-ray and\nneutron powder diffraction, x-ray spectroscopy, etc. The approach itself,\nhowever, is not limited to the demonstrated case, but is applicable to other\ntypes of peak profile distributions. The approach was successfully tested on\nexperimentally collected x-ray powder diffraction data.\n", "  Oxygen is widely used to tune the performance of chalcogenide phase-change\nmaterials in the usage of phase-Change random access memory (PCRAM) which is\nconsidered as the most promising next-generation non-volatile memory. However,\nthe microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible\nphase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change\nmaterials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work\nunravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total\nenergy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main\nfinding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization\nprocess simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom\nout of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the\nTe vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a\n\"dumbbell-like\" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of\nab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to\nsubstitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found\nto be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved\ndata retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work.\nMoreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the\ncarrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe. Our results unravel the\nmicroscopic mechanism of the oxygen-doping optimization of phase-change\nmaterial GeTe, and the present reported mechanism can be applied to other\noxygen doped ternary chalcogenide phase-change materials.\n", "  In this chapter we review stochastic modelling methods in climate science.\nFirst we provide a conceptual framework for stochastic modelling of\ndeterministic dynamical systems based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. The\nMori-Zwanzig equations contain a Markov term, a memory term and a term\nsuggestive of stochastic noise. Within this framework we express standard model\nreduction methods such as averaging and homogenization which eliminate the\nmemory term. We further discuss ways to deal with the memory term and how the\ntype of noise depends on the underlying deterministic chaotic system. Secondly,\nwe review current approaches in stochastic data-driven models. We discuss how\nthe drift and diffusion coefficients of models in the form of stochastic\ndifferential equations can be estimated from observational data. We pay\nattention to situations where the data stems from multi scale systems, a\nrelevant topic in the context of data from the climate system. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the use of discrete stochastic processes (Markov chains) for e.g.\nstochastic subgrid-scale modeling and other topics in climate science.\n", "  In this paper we consider a manifold with a dynamical vector field and\ninquire about the possible tangent bundle structures which would turn the\nstarting vector field into a second order one. The analysis is restricted to\nmanifolds which are diffeomorphic with affine spaces. In particular, we\nconsider the problem in connection with conformal vector fields of second order\nand apply the procedure to vector fields conformally related with the harmonic\noscillator (f-oscillators) . We select one which covers the vector field\ndescribing the Kepler problem.\n", "  When large social-media platforms allow users to easily form and\nself-organize into interest groups, highly related communities can arise. For\nexample, the Reddit site hosts not just a group called food, but also\nHealthyFood, foodhacks, foodporn, and cooking, among others. Are these highly\nrelated communities created for similar classes of reasons (e.g., to focus on a\nsubtopic, to create a place for allegedly more \"high-minded\" discourse, etc.)?\nHow do users allocate attention between such close alternatives when they are\navailable or emerge over time? Are there different types of relations between\nclose alternatives such as sharing many users vs. a new community drawing away\nmembers of an older one vs. a splinter group failing to cohere into a viable\nseparate community? We investigate the interactions between highly related\ncommunities using data from reddit.com consisting of 975M posts and comments\nspanning an 8-year period. We identify a set of typical affixes that users\nadopt to create highly related communities and build a taxonomy of affixes. One\ninteresting finding regarding users' behavior is: after a newer community is\ncreated, for several types of highly-related community pairs, users that engage\nin a newer community tend to be more active in their original community than\nusers that do not explore, even when controlling for previous level of\nengagement.\n", "  In [Arch. Math. 7, 28 (1956), Utilitas Math. 15, 51 (1979)] Carlitz\nintroduced the degenerate Bernoulli numbers and polynomials by replacing the\nexponential factors in the corresponding classical generating functions with\ntheir deformed analogs: $\\exp(t) \\rightarrow (1+\\lambda t)^{1/\\lambda}$, and\n$\\exp(tx) \\rightarrow (1+\\lambda t)^{x/\\lambda}$. The deformed exponentials\nreduce to their ordinary counterparts in the $\\lambda \\rightarrow 0$ limit. In\nthe present work we study the extension of the Bernoulli polynomials obtained\nvia an alternate deformation $\\exp(tx) \\rightarrow (1+\\lambda tx)^{1/\\lambda}$\nthat is inspired by the concepts of $q$-exponential function and $q$-logarithm\nused in the nonextensive Tsallis statistics.\n", "  We consider fourth order ordinary differential operators with compactly\nsupported coefficients on the half-line and on the line. The Fredholm\ndeterminant for this operator is an analytic function in the whole complex\nplane without zero. We describe the determinant at zero. We show that in the\ngeneric case it has a pole of order 4 in the case of the line and of order 1 in\nthe case of the half-line.\n", "  Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations have been carried out to\nstudy the influence of quantum dynamics of carbon atoms on the properties of a\nsingle graphene layer. Finite-temperature properties were analyzed in the range\nfrom 12 to 2000~K, by using the LCBOPII effective potential. To assess the\nmagnitude of quantum effects in structural and thermodynamic properties of\ngraphene, classical molecular dynamics simulations have been also performed.\nParticular emphasis has been laid on the atomic vibrations along the\nout-of-plane direction. Even though quantum effects are present in these\nvibrational modes, we show that at any finite temperature classical-like motion\ndominates over quantum delocalization, provided that the system size is large\nenough. Vibrational modes display an appreciable anharmonicity, as derived from\na comparison between kinetic and potential energy of the carbon atoms. Nuclear\nquantum effects are found to be appreciable in the interatomic distance and\nlayer area at finite temperatures. The thermal expansion coefficient resulting\nfrom PIMD simulations vanishes in the zero-temperature limit, in agreement with\nthe third law of thermodynamics.\n", "  The low conductance of nickel atomic junctions in the hydrogen environment is\nstudied using the nonequilibrium Green's function theory combined with\nfirst-principles calculations. The Ni junction bridged by a $H_2$ molecule has\na conductance of approximately 0.7 $G_0$. This conductance is contributed by\nthe anti-bonding state of the $H_2$ molecule, which forms a bonding state with\nthe $3d$ orbitals of the nearby Ni atoms. In contrast, the Ni junction bridged\nby the two single H atoms has a conductance of approximately 1 $G_0$, which is\nweakly spin-polarized. The spin-up channels were found to contribute mostly to\nthe conductance at a small junction gap, while the spin-down channels play a\ndominant role at a larger junction gap.\n", "  Spectral intensity of spontaneous radiation is calculated in relativistic\nstrophotron. It is shown, that it in the strophotron is given by a\nsuperposition of contributions from emission at different (odd) harmonics of\nthe main resonance frequency . The main resonance frequency is shown to depend\non the initial conditions of the electron, and in particular on its initial\ntransversal coordinate .\n", "  This work deals with Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large Eddy\nSimulations (LES) of turbulent gravity currents, performed by means of a\nDiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element method. In particular, a DG-LES\napproach in which the filter operation is built in the numerical discretization\nhas been employed, similarly to VMS approaches. Numerical simulations of\nnon-Boussinesq lock-exchange benchmark problems show that, in the DNS case, the\nproposed method allows to correctly reproduce relevant features of variable\ndensity flows with gravity. Moreover LES results highlight the excessively high\ndissipation of the Smagorinsky model with respect to the Germano dynamic\nprocedure, providing a first indication of the superiority of dynamic models in\nthe context of gravity currents.\n", "  We present the summary of our last results on the spatial distribution and\nrelative frequencies of Supernovae (SNe) in a large number of host galaxies\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use the locations of SNe in order\nto study the relations between radial/azimuthal distributions of SNe and\nproperties of their hosts and environments. On the other hand, the vertical\ndistribution of SNe allows to study the progenitors association to the thin or\nthick discs, and to the stellar halo. We also propose the underlying mechanisms\nshaping the number ratios of SNe types. It is important to note that there were\nno extended studies of the 3D distribution of SNe and structural parameters of\nhosts. Our study is intended to fill this gap and better constrain the nature\nof SN progenitors.\n", "  Photon statistics in a weakly driven optomechanical photonic crystal cavity,\nwith Kerr-type nonlinearity, is analyzed both analytically and numerically.\nSingle-photon blockade effect is demonstrated via calculations of the\nzero-time-delay second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$. The analytical\nresults obtained by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation are in complete\nconformity with the results obtained through numerical solution of the quantum\nmaster equation. The experimental feasibility with state-of-the-art device\nparameters is discussed. It is observed that photon blockade could be generated\nat the telecommunication wavelength, even at lower values of the nonlinear\nsusceptibility parameters and in the weak single-photon optomechanical coupling\nregime.The system is found to be robust against pure dephasing-induced\ndecoherences.\n", "  It is commonly believed that melting occurs when mean square displacement\n(MSD) of a particle of crystalline solid exceeds a threshold value. This is\nknown as the Lindemann criterion, first introduced in the year of 1910 by\nLindemann. However, Chakravarty et al. demonstrated that this common wisdom is\ninadequate because the MSD at melting can be temperature dependent when\npressure is also allowed to vary along the coexistence line of the phase\ndiagram [Chakravarty C, Debenedetti P G and Stillinger F H 2007 J. Chem.\nPhys.126 204508]. We show here by extensive molecular dynamics simulation of\nboth two and three dimensional polydisperse Lennard-Jones solids that particles\non the small and large limits of size distribution exhibit substantially\ndifferent Lindemann ratio at melting. Despite all the dispersion in MSD,\nmelting is found to be first order in both the dimensions at 5-10% dispersity\nin size.\n", "  The LAMOST DR1 survey contains about two million of spectra labelled by its\npipeline as stellar objects of common spectral classes. There is, however, a\nlot of spectra corrupted in some way by both instrumental and processing\nartifacts, which may mimic spectral properties of interesting celestial\nobjects, namely emission lines of Be stars and quasars. We have tested several\nclustering methods as well as outliers analysis on a sample of one hundred\nthousand spectra using Spark scripts running on Hadoop cluster consisting of\ntwenty-four sixteen-core nodes. This experiment was motivated by an attempt to\nfind rare objects with interesting spectra as outliers most dissimilar from all\ncommon spectra. The result of this time-consuming procedure is a list of\nseveral hundred candidates where different artifacts are prominent, but also\ntens of very interesting emission-line spectra requiring further detailed\nexamination. Many of them may be quasars or even blazars as well as yet unknown\nBe-stars. It deserves mentioning that most of the work benefitted considerably\nfrom technologies of Virtual Observatory.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),\nare expected to be promising for next generation device applications. The\nexistence of sulfur vacancies formed in MoS2, however, will potentially make\ndevices unstable and problematic. Random telegraphic signals (RTSs) have often\nbeen studied in small area Si metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect\ntransistors (MOSFETs) to identify the carrier capture and emission processes at\ndefects. In this paper, we have systemically analyzed RTSs observed in\natomically thin layer MoS2 FETs. Several types of RTSs have been analyzed. One\nis the simple on/off type of telegraphic signals, the second is multilevel\ntelegraphic signals with a superposition of the simple signals, and the third\nis multilevel telegraphic signals that are correlated with each other. The last\none is discussed from the viewpoint of the defect-defect interaction in MoS2\nFETs with a weak screening in atomically confined two-dimensional electron-gas\nsystems. Furthermore, the position of defects causing RTSs has also been\ninvestigated by preparing MoS2 FETs with multi-probes. The electron beam was\nlocally irradiated to intentionally generate defects in the MoS2 channel. It is\nclearly demonstrated that the MoS2 channel is one of the RTS origins. RTS\nanalysis enables us to analyze the defect dynamics of TMD devices.\n", "  A long-standing quantum-mechanical puzzle is whether the collapse of the wave\nfunction is a real physical process or simply an epiphenomenon. This puzzle\nlies at the heart of the measurement problem. One way to choose between the\nalternatives is to assume that one or the other is correct and attempt to draw\nphysical, observable consequences which then could be empirically verified or\nruled out. As a working hypothesis, we propose simple models of collapse as a\nreal physical process for direct binary symmetric measurements made on one\nparticle. This allows one to construct irreversible unstable Schr\\\"odinger\nequations capable of describing continuously the process of collapse induced by\nthe interaction of the quantum system with the measuring device. Due to unknown\ninitial conditions the collapse outcome remains unpredictable so no\ncontradictions with quantum mechanics arise. Our theoretical framework predicts\na finite time-scale of the collapse and links with experiment. Sensitive probes\nof the collapse dynamics could be done using Bose-Einstein condensates,\nultracold neutrons or ultrafast optics. If confirmed, the formulation could be\nrelevant to the transition from quantum fluctuations to classical\ninhomogeneities in early cosmology and to establishing the ultimate limits on\nthe speed of quantum computation and information processing.\n", "  Cassini states correspond to equilibria of the spin axis of a body when its\norbit is perturbed. They were initially described for satellites, but the spin\naxis of stars and planets undergoing strong dissipation can also evolve into\nsome equilibria. For small satellites, the rotational angular momentum is\nusually much smaller than the total angular momentum, so classical methods for\nfinding Cassini states rely on this approximation. Here we present a more\ngeneral approach, which is valid for the secular quadrupolar non-restricted\nproblem with spin. Our method is still valid when the precession rate and the\nmutual inclination of the orbits are not constant. Therefore, it can be used to\nstudy stars with close-in companions, or planets with heavy satellites, like\nthe Earth-Moon system.\n", "  The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) is a 1-m solar telescope that aims to\nobserve the fine structures in both the photosphere and the chromosphere of the\nSun. The observational data acquired simultaneously from one channel for the\nchromosphere and two channels for the photosphere bring great challenges to the\ndata storage of NVST. The multi-channel instruments of NVST, including\nscientific cameras and multi-band spectrometers, generate at least 3 terabytes\ndata per day and require high access performance while storing massive\nshort-exposure images. It is worth studying and implementing a storage system\nfor NVST which would balance the data availability, access performance and the\ncost of development. In this paper, we build a distributed data storage system\n(DDSS) for NVST and then deeply evaluate the availability of real-time data\nstorage on a distributed computing environment. The experimental results show\nthat two factors, i.e., the number of concurrent read/write and the file size,\nare critically important for improving the performance of data access on a\ndistributed environment. Referring to these two factors, three strategies for\nstoring FITS files are presented and implemented to ensure the access\nperformance of the DDSS under conditions of multi-host write and read\nsimultaneously. The real applications of the DDSS proves that the system is\ncapable of meeting the requirements of NVST real-time high performance\nobservational data storage. Our study on the DDSS is the first attempt for\nmodern astronomical telescope systems to store real-time observational data on\na low-cost distributed system. The research results and corresponding\ntechniques of the DDSS provide a new option for designing real-time massive\nastronomical data storage system and will be a reference for future\nastronomical data storage.\n", "  In this paper, using the theory of the so-called fractional calculus we show\nthat it is possible to easily obtain the solutions for the confluent\nhypergeometric equation. Our approach is to be compared with the standard one\n(Frobenius) which is based on the ordinary calculus of integer order.\n", "  The New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) is a 1-meter vacuum solar telescope\nthat aims to observe the fine structures of active regions on the Sun. The main\ntasks of the NVST are high resolution imaging and spectral observations,\nincluding the measurements of the solar magnetic field. The NVST has been\ncollecting more than 20 million FITS files since it began routine observations\nin 2012 and produces a maximum observational records of 120 thousand files in a\nday. Given the large amount of files, the effective archiving and retrieval of\nfiles becomes a critical and urgent problem. In this study, we implement a new\ndata archiving system for the NVST based on the Fastbit Not Only Structured\nQuery Language (NoSQL) database. Comparing to the relational database (i.e.,\nMySQL; My Structured Query Language), the Fastbit database manifests\ndistinctive advantages on indexing and querying performance. In a large scale\ndatabase of 40 million records, the multi-field combined query response time of\nFastbit database is about 15 times faster and fully meets the requirements of\nthe NVST. Our study brings a new idea for massive astronomical data archiving\nand would contribute to the design of data management systems for other\nastronomical telescopes.\n", "  As the observational signature of the footprints of solar magnetic field\nlines open into the heliosphere, coronal holes provide a critical measure of\nthe structure and evolution of these lines. Using a combination of Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory / Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SOHO/EIT),\nSolar Dynamics Observatory / Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) and Solar\nTerrestrial Relations Observatory / Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (STEREO/EUVI\nA/B) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations spanning 1996-2015 (nearly two\nsolar cycles), coronal holes are automatically detected and characterized.\nCoronal hole area distributions show distinct behavior in latitude, defining\nthe domain of polar and low-latitude coronal holes. The northern and southern\npolar regions show a clear asymmetry, with a lag between hemispheres in the\nappearance and disappearance of polar coronal holes.\n", "  The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions of the six-state clock\nmodel on the square lattice are investigated by means of the corner-transfer\nmatrix renormalization group method. The classical analogue of the entanglement\nentropy $S( L, T )$ is calculated for $L$ by $L$ square system up to $L = 129$,\nas a function of temperature $T$. The entropy has a peak at $T = T^{*}_{~}( L\n)$, where the temperature depends on both $L$ and boundary conditions. Applying\nthe finite-size scaling to $T^{*}_{~}( L )$ and assuming the presence of BKT\ntransitions, the transition temperature is estimated to be $T_1^{~} = 0.70$ and\n$T_2^{~} = 0.88$. The obtained results agree with previous analyses. It should\nbe noted that no thermodynamic function is used in this study.\n", "  We compute and compare the continuum limits of several quantities in QCD with\nand without a dynamical charm quark. We consider both low energy quantities,\nlike the hadronic scales $r_0$ and $t_0$, and high energy quantities, like the\ncharmonium masses.\n", "  We provide an up-to-date view on the knowledge management system ScienceWISE\n(SW) and address issues related to the automatic assignment of articles to\nresearch topics. So far, SW has been proven to be an effective platform for\nmanaging large volumes of technical articles by means of ontological\nconcept-based browsing. However, as the publication of research articles\naccelerates, the expressivity and the richness of the SW ontology turns into a\ndouble-edged sword: a more fine-grained characterization of articles is\npossible, but at the cost of introducing more spurious relations among them. In\nthis context, the challenge of continuously recommending relevant articles to\nusers lies in tackling a network partitioning problem, where nodes represent\narticles and co-occurring concepts create edges between them. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the three research directions we have taken for solving this issue: i)\nthe identification of generic concepts to reinforce inter-article similarities;\nii) the adoption of a bipartite network representation to improve scalability;\niii) the design of a clustering algorithm to identify concepts for\ncross-disciplinary articles and obtain fine-grained topics for all articles.\n", "  Previously, the most prominent explanation for the Star of Bethlehem was to\nidentify one of many astronomical events in the sky as being the inspiration\nfor the trip of the Magi. However, all the astronomical answers have detailed\nrefutations, and general disproofs, so all the astronomical answers for the\nStar are dead.\n  In 1999, Michael Molnar put forth a completely new solution, where the Star\noriginated as a report of a natal horoscope for 17 April 6 BC. This natal\nhoroscope shows very impressive regal portents and points to Judea. It is very\nimprobable that such a very rare planet configuration (averaging only once per\nmillennium or longer) would coincide with the very restricted day of Jesus'\nbirth (springtime in a year shortly before Herod's death in 4 BC), unless there\nis some causal connection. The Magi (as labeled by the gospel author) were\nastrologers, so they were only interested in horoscopes. The astrological\nsolution is further supported by the presence of an astrological technical term\n('in the east' meaning what astronomers call the 'heliacal rise') in the\nNativity narrative of Matthew. Importantly, Molnar has only identified the Star\nas originating from a particular natal horoscope, while making no statement\nabout the nature or historicity of any of the other elements of the story in\nMatthew. So for example, the Magi might be astrologers as idealized by the\nGreeks of the time, or they might have been non-existent (invented by a\nlatter-day Greek seeking omens for the birth of a great king), and they might\nhave arrived on 17 April 6 BC or months later, and they might or might not have\nbeen three in numbers with given names. But for the Star of Bethlehem alone,\nMolnar's astrological solution is convincing.\n", "  Flow visualisations are essential to better understand the unsteady\naerodynamics of flapping wing flight. The issues inherent to animal\nexperiments, such as poor controllability and unnatural flapping when tethered,\ncan be avoided by using robotic flyers. Such an approach holds a promise for a\nmore systematic and repeatable methodology for flow visualisation, through a\nbetter controlled flight. Such experiments require high precision position\ncontrol, however, and until now this was not possible due to the challenging\nflight dynamics and payload restrictions of flapping wing Micro Air Vehicles\n(FWMAV). Here, we present a new FWMAV-specific control approach that, by\nemploying an external motion tracking system, achieved autonomous wind tunnel\nflight with a maximum root-mean-square position error of 28 mm at low speeds\n(0.8 - 1.2 m/s) and 75 mm at high speeds (2 - 2.4 m/s). This allowed the first\nfree-flight flow visualisation experiments to be conducted with an FWMAV.\nTime-resolved stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to\nreconstruct the 3D flow patterns of the FWMAV wake. A good qualitative match\nwas found in comparison to a tethered configuration at similar conditions,\nsuggesting that the obtained free-flight measurements are reliable and\nmeaningful.\n", "  The notion of quantum hashing formalized by F. Ablayev and A. Vasiliev in\n2013. F. Ablayev and M. Ablayev in 2014 introduced the notion of quantum hash\ngenerator which is convenient technical tool for constructing quantum hash\nfunc- tions. M. Ziatdinov in 2014 presented group approach for constructing\nquantum hash functions. All these mentioned above results present constructions\nof quan- tum hash functions based on abelian groups. This paper continue the\nresearch on quantum hashing. Our approach allows us to construct quantum hash\nfunction working on any (finite) group. Also our approach allows us to\nconstruct quantum hash functions based on classical hash function from $NC^1$.\n", "  The interdependence of microscopic (atomic) and macroscopic (hydrodynamic)\nprocesses inside stars and their consequences for stellar structure and\nevolution were recognized by Jean-Paul Zahn several decades ago. He was a\npioneer in that respect, discussing the importance of the macroscopic motions\nrelated to stellar rotation, in competition with the chemical stratification\ninduced by gravitational settling and radiative accelerations. This has been\nmuch developed in recent years, in connection with the improvement of\nobservational data, including asteroseismology. Morover, it has been recently\ndiscovered that the microscopic atomic diffusion processes can lead to\nmacroscopic results which may infuence in a non negligible way the internal\nstellar structure, independently of the abundances observed at the surface.\n", "  The Bel-Robinson tensor contains many nice mathematical properties and its\ndominant energy condition is desirable for describing the positive\ngravitational energy. The dominant property is a basic requirement for the\nquasi-local mass, i.e., in small sphere limit. We claim that there exists\nanother option, a linear combination between the Bel-Robinson tensor $B$ and\ntensor $S$, which contributes the same dominant property. Moreover, using the 5\nPetrov types as the verification, we found that this dominant property\njustification for the Bel-Robinson tensor can be simplified as examining\n$B_{0000}\\geq|B_{\\alpha\\beta{}00}|$ and $B_{0000}\\geq|B_{0123}|$, instead of\n$B_{0000}\\geq|B_{\\alpha\\beta\\lambda\\sigma}|$ for all\n$\\alpha,\\beta,\\lambda,\\sigma=0,1,2,3$.\n", "  In this thesis we investigate topological aspects and arithmetic structures\nin quantum field theory and string theory. Particular focus is put on\nconsistent truncations of supergravity and compactifications of F-theory.\n", "  Recently, a new definition for a Wigner distribution function for a\none-dimensional finite quantum system, in which the position and momentum\noperators have a finite (multiplicity-free) spectrum, was developed. This\ndistribution function is defined on discrete phase-space (a finite square\ngrid), and can thus be referred to as the Wigner matrix. In the current paper,\nwe compute this Wigner matrix (or rather, the pre-Wigner matrix, which is\nrelated to the Wigner matrix by a simple matrix multiplication) for the case of\nthe $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ finite oscillator. The first expression for the matrix\nelements involves sums over squares of Krawtchouk polynomials, and follows from\nstandard techniques. We also manage to present a second solution, where the\nmatrix elements are evaluations of Dyck polynomials. These Dyck polynomials are\ndefined in terms of the well known Dyck paths. This combinatorial expression of\nthe pre-Wigner matrix elements turns out to be particularly simple.\n", "  We consider an extension of the real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ by\nintroducing a parity operator $P$ and a parameter $c$. This extended algebra is\nisomorphic to the Bannai-Ito algebra with two parameters equal to zero. For\nthis algebra we classify all unitary finite-dimensional representations and\nshow their relation with known representations of $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$. Moreover,\nwe present a model for a one-dimensional finite oscillator based on the\nodd-dimensional representations of this algebra. For this model, the spectrum\nof the position operator is equidistant and coincides with the spectrum of the\nknown $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ oscillator. In particular the spectrum is independent\nof the parameter $c$ while the discrete position wavefunctions, which are given\nin terms of certain dual Hahn polynomials, do depend on this parameter.\n", "  The Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) has completed a four-year study on the\nfeasibility of muon colliders and on using stored muon beams for neutrinos.\nThat study was broadly successful in its goals, establishing the feasibility of\nheavy lepton colliders (HLCs) from the 125 GeV Higgs Factory to more than 10\nTeV, as well as exploring using a {\\mu} storage ring (MSR) for neutrinos, and\nestablishing that MSRs could provide factory-level intensities of $\\nu_e\n(\\bar{\\nu}_e)$ and $\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ $({\\nu}_\\mu)$ beams. The key components of\nthe collider and neutrino factory systems were identified. Feasible designs and\ndetailed simulations of all of these components have been obtained, including\nsome initial hardware component tests, setting the stage for future\nimplementation where resources are available and the precise physics goals\nbecome apparent.\n", "  Motivated by the sharp contrast between classical and quantum physics as\nprobability theories, in these lecture notes I introduce the basic notions of\noperator algebras that are relevant for the algebraic approach to quantum\nphysics. Aspects of the representation theory of C*-algebras will be motivated\nand illustrated in physical terms. Particular emphasis will be given to\nexplicit examples from the theory of quantum phase transitions, where concepts\ncoming from strands as diverse as quantum information theory, algebraic quantum\nphysics and statistical mechanics agreeably converge, providing a more complete\npicture of the physical phenomena involved.\n", "  The non-perturbative computation of the energy-momentum tensor can be used to\nstudy the scaling behaviour of strongly coupled quantum field theories. The\nWilson flow is an essential tool to find a meaningful formulation of the\nenergy-momentum tensor on the lattice. We extend recent studies of the\nrenormalisation of the energy-momentum tensor in four-dimensional gauge theory\nto the case of a three-dimensional scalar theory to investigate its intrinsic\nstructure and numerical feasibility on a more basic level. In this paper, we\ndiscuss translation Ward identities, introduce the Wilson flow for scalar\ntheory, and present our results for the renormalisation constants of the scalar\nenergy-momentum tensor.\n", "  For the perturbed Gelfand's equation on the unit ball in two dimensions, Y.\nDu and Y. Lou [4] proved that the curve of positive solutions is exactly\n$S$-shaped, for sufficiently small values of the secondary parameter. We\npresent a simplified proof and some extensions. This problem is prominent in\ncombustion theory, see e.g., the book of J. Bebernes and D. Eberly [1].\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are perfect laboratories to check General\nRelativity (GR) effects by using Broad Line Region (BLR) clouds eclipses to\nprobe the innermost regions of the accretion disk. A new relativistic X-ray\nspectral model for X-ray eclipses is introduced. First we present the different\nobservables that are involved in X-ray eclipses, including the X-ray emitting\nregions size, the emissivity index, the cloud's column density, ionization,\nsize and velocity, the black hole spin, and the system's inclination. Then we\nhighlight some theoretical predictions on the observables by using XMM-Newton\nsimulations, finding that absorption varies depending on the photons' energy\nrange, being maximum when the approaching side of the X-ray-emitting region is\ncovered. Finally, we fit our relativistic model to actual XMM-Newton data from\na long observation of the NLS1 galaxy SWIFT J2127.4+5654, and compare our\nresults with a previous work, in which we addressed the BLR cloud eclipse from\na non-relativistic prespective.\n", "  We present a precise lattice QCD calculation of the contribution to the\nneutron-proton mass splitting arising from strong isospin breaking,\n$m_n-m_p|_{QCD}=2.32\\pm0.17$ MeV. We also determine $m_{\\Xi^-} -\nm_{\\Xi^0}|_{QCD} = 5.44\\pm0.31$ MeV. The calculation is performed at three\nvalues of the pion mass, with several values of the quark mass splitting and\nmultiple lattice volumes, but only a single lattice spacing and an estimate of\ndiscretization errors. The calculations are performed on the anisotropic\nclover-Wilson ensembles generated by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration. The\nomega-baryon mass is used to set the scale $a_t^{-1}=6111\\pm127$ MeV, while the\nkaon masses are used to determine the value of the light-quark mass spitting.\nThe nucleon mass splitting is then determined as a function of the pion mass.\nWe observe, for the first time, conclusive evidence for non-analytic light\nquark mass dependence in lattice QCD calculations of the baryon spectrum. When\nleft as a free parameter, the fits prefer a nucleon axial coupling of\n$g_A=1.24(56)$. To highlight the presence of this chiral logarithm in the\nnucleon mass splitting, we also compute the isospin splitting in the\ncascade-baryon system which is less sensitive to chiral dynamics. Finally, we\nupdate the best lattice QCD determination of the CP-odd pion-nucleon coupling\nthat would arise from a non-zero QCD theta-term, $\\bar{g}_0 / (\\sqrt{2}f_\\pi) =\n(14.7\\pm1.8\\pm1.4) \\cdot 10^{-3} \\bar{\\theta}$.\n  The original lattice QCD correlation functions, analysis results and\nextrapolated quantities are packaged in HDF5 files made publicly available\nincluding a simple Python script to access the numerical results, construct\neffective mass plots along with our analysis results, and perform the\nextrapolations of various quantities determined in this work.\n", "  New extended interpolating operators made of quenched three dimensional\nfermions are introduced in the context of lattice QCD. The mass of the 3D\nfermions can be tuned in a controlled way to find a better overlap of the\nextended operators with the states of interest. The extended operators have\ngood renormalisation properties and are easy to control when taking the\ncontinuum limit. Moreover the short distance behaviour of the two point\nfunctions built from these operators is greatly improved. The operators have\nbeen numerically implemented and a comparison to point sources and Jacobi\nsmeared sources has been performed on the new CLS configurations.\n", "  A concise introduction to quantum entanglement in multipartite systems is\npresented. We review entanglement of pure quantum states of three--partite\nsystems analyzing the classes of GHZ and W states and discussing the monogamy\nrelations. Special attention is paid to equivalence with respect to local\nunitaries and stochastic local operations, invariants along these orbits,\nmomentum map and spectra of partial traces. We discuss absolutely maximally\nentangled states and their relation to quantum error correction codes. An\nimportant case of a large number of parties is also analysed and entanglement\nin spin systems is briefly reviewed.\n", "  We construct small-$x$ evolution equations which can be used to calculate\nquark and anti-quark helicity TMDs and PDFs, along with the $g_1$ structure\nfunction. These evolution equations resum powers of $\\alpha_s \\, \\ln^2 (1/x)$\nin the polarization-dependent evolution along with the powers of $\\alpha_s \\,\n\\ln (1/x)$ in the unpolarized evolution which includes saturation effects. The\nequations are written in an operator form in terms of polarization-dependent\nWilson line-like operators. While the equations do not close in general, they\nbecome closed and self-contained systems of non-linear equations in the\nlarge-$N_c$ and large-$N_c \\, \\& \\, N_f$ limits. We construct a numerical\nsolution of the helicity evolution equations in the large-$N_c$ limit.\nEmploying the extracted intercept, we are able to predict directly from theory\nthe behavior of the quark helicity PDFs at small $x$, which should have\nimportant phenomenological consequences. We also give an estimate of how much\nof the proton's spin may be at small $x$ and what impact this has on the\nso-called \"spin crisis.\"\n  Based on JHEP 1601 (2016) 072 (arXiv:1511.06737), arXiv:1610.06197 and\narXiv:1610.06188.\n", "  Between 2004 until today many new resonances in the QCD spectrum have been\nadded by the Particle Data Group. However, it is still possible that there are\nfurther states that have yet to be measured, as predicted by Lattice QCD\ncalculations and Quark Models. In this paper I review how these missing states\nwould influence the field of heavy-ion collisions. Additionally, the quantum\nnumbers that characterize these missing states are also discussed.\n", "  A composite non-abelian model $SU(N) \\times SU(N)$ is proposed as possible\nextension of the Yang-Mills symmetry. We obtain the corresponding gauge\nsymmetry of the model and the most general lagrangian invariant by $SU(N)\n\\times SU(N)$. The corresponding Feynman rules of the model are studied.\nPropagators and vertices are derived in the momentum space. As physical\napplication, instead of considering the color symmetry $SU_{c}(3)$ for $QCD$ ,\nwe substitute it by the combination $SU_{c}(3) \\times SU_{c}(3)$. It yields a\npossibility to go beyond $QCD$ symmetry in the sense that quarks are preserved\nwith three colors. This extension provides composite quarks in triplets and\nsextets multiplets accomplished with the usual massless gluons plus massive\ngluons. We present a power counting analysis that satisfies the renormalization\nconditions as well as one studies the structure of radiative corrections to one\nloop approximation. Unitary condition is verified at tree level. Tachyons are\navoided. For end, one extracts a BRST symmetry from lagrangian and\nSlavnov-Taylor identities.\n", "  A portion of the remnant Tevatron program infrastructure at Fermilab is being\nreconfigured to be used for the generation and delivery of proton and muon\nbeams for new high-precision particle physics experiments. With the 8 GeV\nBooster as its primary source, the Mu2e experiment will receive 8.9 GeV/c\nbunched beam on target, after being stored and slow spilled from the Delivery\nRing (DR) -- a refurbished debuncher ring from Tevatron antiproton production.\nFor the Muon g-2 experiment, the DR will be tuned for 3.1 GeV/c to capture\nmuons off of a target before sending them to this experiment's Storage Ring.\nThe apertures in the beam transport systems are optimized for the large muon\nbeams of this lower-energy experiment. In order to provide further flexibility\nin the operation of the DR for future possible low-energy, high intensity\nparticle physics experiments (REDTOP, for example) and detector development,\ninvestigations are underway into the feasibility of decelerating beams from its\nmaximum kinetic energy of 8 GeV level to lower energies, down to 1-2 GeV. In\nthis paper we look at possible lattice modifications to the DR to avoid a\ntransition crossing during the deceleration process. Hardware requirements and\nother operational implications of this scheme will also be discussed.\n", "  The Milky Way galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy which consists of a black\nhole in its centre, a barred bulge and a disk which contains spiral arms. The\ncomplex structure of the Galaxy makes it extremely difficult and challenging to\nmodel its mass distribution, particularly for the Galactic disk which plays the\nmost important role in the dynamics and evolution of the Galaxy. Conventionally\nan axisymmetric disk model with an exponential brightness distribution and a\nconstant mass-to-light ratio is assumed for the Galactic disk. In order to\ngenerate a flat rotation curve, a dark halo has also to be included. Here, by\nusing the recently released Gaia billion-star map, we propose a Galactic disk\nmass distribution model which is based on the star density distribution rather\nthan the brightness and mass-to-light ratio. The model is characterized by two\nparameters, a bulge radius and a characteristic length. Using the mass\ndistribution model and solving the Poisson equation of the Galaxy, we obtain a\nflat rotation curve which reproduces the key observed features with no need for\na dark halo.\n", "  Most Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite (HED) meteorites (analogs to V-type\nasteroids) are thought to originate from asteroid (4) Vesta. However, some HEDs\nshow distinct oxygen isotope ratios and therefore are thought to originate from\nother asteroids. In this study, we try to identify asteroids that may represent\nparent bodies of those mismatching HEDs. In particular, the origin of the\nanomalous Bunburra Rockhole meteorite was traced back to the inner main\nasteroid belt, showing that there might be asteroids that are not genetically\nlinked to the asteroid (4) Vesta (the main source of V-type asteroids and HED\nmeteorites) in the inner main belt. In this work we identify V-type asteroids\noutside the dynamical Vesta family whose rotational properties (retrograde vs\nprograde rotation) suggest the direction of Yarkovsky drift that sets them\napart from typical Vestoids and Vesta fugitives. Specifically Nesvorny et al.\n2008 simulated escapes paths from the Vesta family and showed that typical\nVesta fugitives in the inner main asteroid belt at semi-major axis a < 2.3 AU\nhave to have retrograde rotations and physical and thermal parameters that\nmaximize the Yarkovsky force in order to evolve to scattered orbits within 1-2\nGyrs (age of the Vesta collisional family). Therefore large asteroids outside\nthe Vesta family and with a < 2.3 AU and having thermal and rotational\nproperties minimizing the Yarkovsky drift or showing Yarkovsky drift direction\ntowards (4) Vesta are the best candidates for non-Vestoids V-type asteroids and\ntherefore parent bodies of anomalous HED. In this study, we have performed\naccurate photometric observations and determined sense of rotation for several\nasteroids testing their links to Vesta and anomalous HED. We have found several\npotential non-Vestoid candidates. Those objects have to be studied in more\ndetail to fully confirm their link to anomalous HEDs.\n", "  Topological phases of matter exhibit phase transitions between distinct\ntopological classes. These phase transitions are exotic in that they do not\nfall within the traditional Ginzburg-Landau paradigm but are instead associated\nwith changes in bulk topological invariants and associated topological surface\nstates. In the case of a Weyl semimetal this phase transition is particularly\nunusual because it involves the creation of bulk chiral charges and the\nnucleation of topological Fermi arcs. Here we image a topological phase\ntransition to a Weyl semimetal in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ with changing\ncomposition $x$. Using pump-probe ultrafast angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (pump-probe ARPES), we directly observe the nucleation of a\ntopological Fermi arc at $x_c \\sim 7\\%$, showing the critical point of a\ntopological Weyl phase transition. For Mo dopings $x < x_c$, we observe no\nFermi arc, while for $x > x_c$, the Fermi arc gradually extends as the bulk\nWeyl points separate. Our results demonstrate for the first time the creation\nof magnetic monopoles in momentum space. Our work opens the way to manipulating\nchiral charge and topological Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals for transport\nexperiments and device applications.\n", "  We investigate soliton generation dynamics with the influence of thermal\neffects. Either soliton annihilation or survival can occur in different trials\nwith the same tuning method, and a spontaneous route to soliton formation is\nobserved.\n", "  The method of differential equations in canonical form has proven a powerful\ntool for solving multiloop Feynman integrals. In this note we test this\nprocedure away from four dimensions. Namely, we consider the simple example of\na massless doublebox, expanded in dimensional regularization around six\ndimensions. We achieve a canonical form for the relevant master integrals and\nsolve them in terms of harmonic polylogarithms up to transcendental order 9.\nThe integral basis of uniform transcendentality requires increasing indices of\npropagators. According to the standard graphical jargon, this amounts to\ndecorating the integrals with baubles, like on Christmas trees, or rather loops\nin this case. The results can be useful for studying amplitudes in six\ndimensions.\n", "  We derive the Riemannian Positive Mass theorem in arbitrary dimensions,\nwithout any topological constraints. The main new tools are skin structures and\nsurgeries on minimal hypersurfaces.\n"]}
