The largest\neigenvalue converges, after proper scaling, to the Tracy--Widom distribution.\n", "  There are two chiral Archimedean polyhedra, the snub cube and snub\ndodecahedron together with their duals the Catalan solids, pentagonal\nicositetrahedron and pentagonal hexacontahedron. In this paper we construct the\nchiral polyhedra and their dual solids in a systematic way. We use the proper\nrotational subgroups of the Coxeter groups $W(A_1 \\oplus A_1 \\oplus A_1)$,\n$W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$ and $W(H_3)$ to derive the orbits representing the solids of\ninterest. They lead to the polyhedra tetrahedron, icosahedron, snub cube, and\nsnub dodecahedron respectively. We prove that the tetrahedron and icosahedron\ncan be transformed to their mirror images by the proper rotational octahedral\ngroup $\\frac{W(B_3)}{C_2}$ so they are not classified in the class of chiral\npolyhedra. It is noted that the snub cube and the snub dodecahedron can be\nderived from the vectors, which are non-linear combinations of the simple\nroots, by the actions of the proper rotation groups $\\frac{W(B_3)}{C_2}$ and\n$\\frac{W(H_3)}{C_2}$ respectively. Their duals are constructed as the unions of\nthree orbits of the groups of concern. We also construct the polyhedra,\nquasiregular in general, by combining chiral polyhedra with their mirror\nimages. As a by product we obtain the pyritohedral group as the subgroup the\nCoxeter group $W(H_3)$ and discuss the constructions of pyritohedrons. We\nemploy a method which describes the Coxeter groups and their orbits in terms of\nquaternions.\n", "  We report on the results of numerical simulations of 1+1 dimensional SU(N)\nYang-Mills theory with maximal supersymmetry at finite temperature and\ncompactified on a circle. For large N this system is thought to provide a dual\ndescription of the decoupling limit of N coincident D1-branes on a circle. It\nhas been proposed that at large N there is a phase transition at strong\ncoupling related to the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) phase transition in the\nholographic gravity dual. In a high temperature limit there was argued to be a\ndeconfinement transition associated to the spatial Polyakov loop, and it has\nbeen proposed that this is the continuation of the strong coupling GL\ntransition. Investigating the theory on the lattice for SU(3) and SU(4) and\nstudying the time and space Polyakov loops we find evidence supporting this. In\nparticular at strong coupling we see the transition has the parametric\ndependence on coupling predicted by gravity. We estimate the GL phase\ntransition temperature from the lattice data which, interestingly, is not yet\nknown directly in the gravity dual. Fine tuning in the lattice theory is\navoided by the use of a lattice action with exact supersymmetry.\n", "  We describe $\\omega$-limit sets of completely positive (CP) maps over\nfinite-dimensional spaces. In such sets and in its corresponding convex hulls,\nCP maps present isometric behavior and the states contained in it commute with\neach other. Motivated by these facts, we describe a quantization procedure\nbased on CP maps which are induced by Markov (transfer) operators. Classical\ndynamics are described by an action over essentially bounded functions. A\nnon-expansive linear map, which depends on a choice of a probability measure,\nis the centerpiece connecting phenomena over function and matrix spaces.\n", "  A characterization of the Kerr-NUT-(A)de Sitter metric among four dimensional\n\\Lambda-vacuum spacetimes admitting a Killing vector is obtained in terms of\nthe proportionality of the self-dual Weyl tensor and a natural self-dual double\ntwo-form constructed from the Killing vector. This result recovers and extends\na previous characterization of the Kerr and Kerr-NUT metrics. The method of\nproof is based on (i) the presence of a second Killing vector field which is\nbuilt in terms of geometric information arising from the previous Killing\nvector exclusively, and (ii) the existence of an interesting underlying\ngeometric structure involving a Riemannian submersion of a conformally related\nmetric, both of which may be of independent interest.\n", "  We propose a method to reach the antiferromagnetic state of two-dimensional\nFermi gases trapped in optical lattices: Independent subsystems are prepared in\nsuitable initial states and then connected by a sudden or slow quench of the\ntunneling between the subsystems. Examples of suitable low-entropy subsystems\nare double wells or plaquettes, which can be experimentally realised in Mott\ninsulating shells using optical super-lattices. We estimate the effective\ntemperature T* of the system after the quench by calculating the distribution\nof excitations created using the spin wave approximation in a Heisenberg model.\nWe investigate the effect of an initial staggered magnetic field and find that\nfor an optimal polarisation of the initial state the effective temperature can\nbe significantly reduced from T*$\\approx$1.7 Tc at zero polarisation to\nT*<0.65Tc, where Tc is the crossover temperature to the antiferromagnetic\nstate. The temperature can be further reduced using a finite quench time. We\nalso show that T* decreases logarithmically with the linear size of the\nsubsystem.\n", "  The Quantum Satisfiability problem (QSAT) is the generalization of the\ncanonical NP-complete problem - Boolean Satisfiability. (k,s)-QSAT is the\nfollowing variant of the problem: given a set of projectors of rank 1, acting\nnon-trivially on k qubits out of n qubits, such that each qubit appears in at\nmost s projectors, decide whether there exists a quantum state in the null\nspace of all the projectors. Let f*(k) be the maximal integer s such that every\n(k,s)-QSAT instance is satisfiable. Deciding (k,f*(k))-QSAT is computationally\neasy: by definition the answer is \"satisfiable\". But, by relaxing the\nconditions slightly, we show that (k,f*(k)+2)-QSAT is QMA_1-hard, for k >=15.\nThis is a quantum analogue of a classical result by Kratochv\\'il et al.\n[KST93]. We use the term \"an almost sudden jump\" to stress that the complexity\nof (k,f*(k)+1)-QSAT is open, where the jump in the classical complexity is\nknown to be sudden.\n  We present an implication of this finding to the quantum PCP conjecture,\narguably one of the most important open problems in the field of Hamiltonian\ncomplexity. Our implications impose constraints on one possible way to refute\nthe quantum PCP.\n", "  We study the quantization of spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes within\nloop quantum gravity. In particular, we give additional details about our\nprevious work in which we showed that one could complete the quantization the\nmodel and that the singularity inside black holes is resolved. Moreover, we\nconsider an alternative quantization based on a slightly different kinematical\nHilbert space. The ambiguity in kinematical spaces stems from how one treats\nthe periodicity of one of the classical variables in these models. The\ncorresponding physical Hilbert spaces solve the diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian\nconstraint but their intrinsic structure is radically different depending on\nthe kinematical Hilbert space one started from. In both cases there are quantum\nobservables that do not have a classical counterpart. However, one can show\nthat at the end of the day, by examining Dirac observables, both quantizations\nlead to the same physical predictions.\n", "  An alternative expression for the Christoffel--Darboux formula for multiple\northogonal polynomials of mixed type is derived from the $LU$ factorization of\nthe moment matrix of a given measure and two sets of weights. We use the action\nof the generalized Jacobi matrix $J$, also responsible for the recurrence\nrelations, on the linear forms and their duals to obtain the result.\n", "  We construct a continuous-time non-commutative random walk on\n$U(\\mathfrak{gl}_N)$ with dilation maps $U(\\mathfrak{gl}_N)\\rightarrow\nL^2(U(N))^{\\otimes\\infty}$. This is an analog of a continuous-time\nnon-commutative random walk on the group von Neumann algebra $vN(U(N))$\nconstructed in [15], and is a variant of discrete-time non-commutative random\nwalks on $U(\\mathfrak{gl}_N)$ [2,9].\n  It is also shown that when restricting to the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra of\n$U(\\mathfrak{gl}_N),$ the non-commutative random walk matches a\n(2+1)-dimensional random surface model introduced in [7]. As an application, it\nis then proved that the moments converge to an explicit Gaussian field along\ntime-like paths. Combining with [7] which showed convergence to the Gaussian\nfree field along space-like paths, this computes the entire three-dimensional\nGaussian field. In particular, it matches a Gaussian field from eigenvalues of\nrandom matrices [5].\n", "  A group theoretical discussion on the hypercubic lattice described by the\naffine Coxeter-Weyl group Wa(Bn) has been presented. When the lattice is\nprojected onto the Coxeter plane it is noted that the maximal dihedral subgroup\nDh of W(Bn) with h = 2n representing the Coxeter number describes the h-fold\nsymmetric quasicrystallography. Higher dimensional cubic lattices are\nexplicitly constructed for n = 4, 5, 6. Their rank 3 Coxeter subgroups and\nmaximal dihedral subgroups are identified. It has been explicitly shown that\nwhen their Voronoi cells are decomposed under the respective rank 3 subgroups\nW(A3),W(H2) x W(A1) and W(H3) one obtains the rhombic dodecahedron, rhombic\nicosahedron and rhombic triacontahedron respectively. Projection of the lattice\nB4 onto the Coxeter plane represents quasicrystal structures with 8-fold\nsymmetry. The B5 lattice is used to describe the quasicrystals with both 5-fold\nand 10-fold symmetries. The lattice B6 can describe a 12-fold symmetric\nquasicrystal as well as a 3D icosahedral quasicrystal depending on the choice\nof subspace of projections. The novel structures from the projected sets of\nlattice points are compatible with the available experimental data.\n", "  The massless harmonic oscillator is a rare example of a system whose Feynman\npath integral can be explicitly computed and receives its main contributions\nfrom regions of the functional space that are far from the classical and\nsemiclassical configurations near the stationary point of the action. The\nfunctional average $\\langle q_m^2 \\rangle$ of the square of the coordinate at a\ntime $t_m$ which is intermediate between the initial and final time gives a\nmeasure of the amplitude of quantum fluctuations with respect to the classical\npath. This average, or \"transition element\", is divergent in the massless\nlimit, signaling a quantum runaway. We show that the divergence is not due to\nthe continuum limit and formulate the conjecture that the divergent\ncontributions come from regions where the action $S$ is constant and therefore\nthe interference factor $e^{-iS/\\hbar}$ does not oscillate. For most systems\nthese regions have zero functional measure and thus give a null contribution to\nthe path integral, but this is not the case for the massless oscillator. We\nstudy the simplest functional subspace with constant action, namely the one\nwith $S=0$, which is connected to the classical solutions but extends to\ninfinity, like an hyperplane through the origin; this subspace turns out to be\ninfinite-dimensional. Some possible applications and developments are\nmentioned.\n", "  We investigate whether arbitrarily small perturbations in global AdS space\nare generically unstable and collapse into black holes on the time scale set by\ngravitational interactions. We argue that current evidence, combined with our\nanalysis, strongly suggests that a set of nonzero measure in the space of\ninitial conditions does not collapse on this time scale. We perform an analysis\nin position space to study this puzzle, and our formalism allows us to directly\nstudy the vanishing-amplitude limit. We show that gravitational\nself-interaction leads to tidal deformations which are equally likely to focus\nor defocus energy, and we sketch the phase diagram accordingly. We also clarify\nthe connection between gravitational evolution in global AdS and holographic\nthermalization.\n", "  This paper provides a modern presentation of Noether's theory in the realm of\nclassical dynamics, with application to the problem of a particle submitted to\nboth a potential and a linear dissipation. After a review of the close\nrelationships between Noether symmetries and first integrals, we investigate\nthe variational point symmetries of the Lagrangian introduced by Bateman,\nCaldirola and Kanai. This analysis leads to the determination of all the\ntime-independent potentials allowing such symmetries, in the one-dimensional\nand the radial cases. Then we develop a symmetry-based transformation of\nLagrangians into autonomous others, and apply it to our problem. To be\ncomplete, we enlarge the study to Lie point symmetries which we associate\nlogically to Noether ones. Finally, we succinctly address the issue of a\n`weakened' Noether's theory, in connection with on-flows symmetries and\nnon-local constant of motions, for it has a direct physical interpretation in\nour specific problem. Since the Lagrangian we use gives rise to simple\ncalculations, we hope that this work will be of didactic interest to graduate\nstudents, and give teaching material as well as food for thought for physicists\nregarding Noether's theory and the recent developments around the idea of\nsymmetry in classical mechanics.\n", "  In this paper, we study the separability of quantum states in bosonic system.\nOur main tool here is the \"separability witnesses\", and a connection between\n\"separability witnesses\" and a new kind of positivity of matrices--- \"Power\nPositive Matrices\" is drawn. Such connection is employed to demonstrate that\nmulti-qubit quantum states with Dicke states being its eigenvectors is\nseparable if and only if two related Hankel matrices are positive semidefinite.\nBy employing this criterion, we are able to show that such state is separable\nif and only if it's partial transpose is non-negative, which confirms the\nconjecture in [Wolfe, Yelin, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2014)]. Then, we present a class\nof bosonic states in $d\\otimes d$ system such that for general $d$, determine\nits separability is NP-hard although verifiable conditions for separability is\neasily derived in case $d=3,4$.\n", "  The thermodynamics and phase transitions of charged RN-AdS and rotating\nKerr-AdS black holes in a generalized Randall-Sundrum braneworld are\ninvestigated in the framework of thermodynamic geometry. A detailed analysis of\nthe thermodynamics, stability and phase structures in the canonical and the\ngrand canonical ensembles for these AdS braneworld black holes are described.\nThe thermodynamic curvatures for both these AdS braneworld black holes are\ncomputed and studied as a function of the thermodynamic variables. Through this\nanalysis we illustrate an interesting dependence of the phase structures on the\nbraneworld parameter for these black holes.\n", "  Given a convex function $\\varphi$ and two hermitian matrices $A$ and $B$,\nLewin and Sabin study in [M. Lewin, J. Sabin, {\\it A Family of Monotone Quantum\nRelative Entropies}, Lett. Math. Phys. \\textbf{104} (2014), 691-705.] the\nrelative entropy defined by $\\mathcal{H}(A,B)=\\text{Tr} [ \\varphi(A) -\n\\varphi(B) - \\varphi'(B)(A-B) ]$. Amongst other things, they prove that the\nso-defined quantity is monotone if and only if $\\varphi'$ is operator monotone.\nThe monotonicity is then used to properly define $\\mathcal{H}(A,B)$ for\nself-adjoint bounded operators acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space\nby a limiting procedure. More precisely, for an increasing sequence of\nfinite-dimensional projections $\\lbrace P_n \\rbrace_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ with $P_n\n\\to 1$ strongly, the limit $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathcal{H}(P_n A P_n, P_n B\nP_n)$ is shown to exist and to be independent of the sequence of projections\n$\\lbrace P_n \\rbrace_{n=1}^{\\infty}$. The question whether this sequence\nconverges to its \"obvious\" limit, namely $\\text{Tr} [ \\varphi(A)- \\varphi(B) -\n\\varphi'(B)(A-B) ]$, has been left open. We answer this question in principle\naffirmatively and show that $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathcal{H}(P_n A P_n, P_n B\nP_n) = \\text{Tr}[ \\varphi(A) - \\varphi(B) - \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} \\alpha}\n\\varphi( \\alpha A + (1-\\alpha)B )|_{\\alpha = 0} ]$. If the operators $A$ and\n$B$ are regular enough, that is $(A-B)$, $\\varphi(A)-\\varphi(B)$ and\n$\\varphi'(B)(A-B)$ are trace-class, the identity $\\text{Tr}[ \\varphi(A) -\n\\varphi(B) - \\frac{\\text{d}}{\\text{d} \\alpha} \\varphi( \\alpha A + (1-\\alpha)B\n)|_{\\alpha = 0} ] = \\text{Tr} [ \\varphi(A)- \\varphi(B) - \\varphi'(B)(A-B) ]$\nholds.\n", "  An alternative equilibrium stochastic dynamics for a Brownian particle in\ninhomogeneous space is derived. Such a dynamics can model the motion of a\ncomplex molecule in its conformation space when in equilibrium with a uniform\nheat bath. The derivation is done by a simple generalization of the formulation\ndue to Zwanzig for a Brownian particle in homogeneous heat bath. We show that\nif the system couples to different number of bath degrees of freedom at\ndifferent conformations then the alternative model is derived. We discuss\nresults of an experiment by Faucheux and Libchaber which probably has indicated\npossible limitation of the Boltzmann distribution as equilibrium distribution\nof a Brownian particle in inhomogeneous space and propose experimental\nverification of the present theory using similar methods.\n", "  We explore the effects of an outer stably stratified coronal envelope on\nrotating turbulent convection, differential rotation, and large-scale dynamo\naction in spherical wedge models of the Sun. We solve the compressible\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations in a two-layer model with unstable stratification\nbelow the surface, representing the convection zone, and a stably stratified\ncoronal envelope above. The interface represents a free surface. We compare our\nmodel to models that have no coronal envelope. The presence of a coronal\nenvelope is found to modify the Reynolds stress and the $\\Lambda$ effect\nresulting in a weaker and non-cylindrical differential rotation. This is\nrelated to the reduced latitudinal temperature variations that are caused by\nand dependent on the angular velocity. Some simulations develop a near-surface\nshear layer that we can relate to a sign change in the meridional Reynolds\nstress term in the thermal wind balance equation. Furthermore, the presence of\na free surface changes the magnetic field evolution since the toroidal field is\nconcentrated closer to the surface. In all simulations, however, the migration\ndirection of the mean magnetic field can be explained by the Parker--Yoshimura\nrule, which is consistent with earlier findings. A realistic treatment of the\nupper boundary in spherical dynamo simulations is crucial for the dynamics of\nthe flow and magnetic field evolution.\n", "  For all the joint von Neumann measurements on a D-dimensional quantum system,\nwe present the specific example of a context-invariant quasi hidden variable\n(qHV) model, proved in [Loubenets, J. Math. Phys. 56, 032201 (2015)] to exist\nfor each Hilbert space. In this model, a quantum observable X is represented by\na variety of random variables satisfying the functional condition required in\nquantum foundations but, in contrast to a contextual model, each of these\nrandom variables equivalently models X under all joint von Neumann\nmeasurements, regardless of their contexts. This, in particular, implies the\nspecific local qHV (LqHV) model for an N-qudit state and allows us to derive\nthe new exact upper bound on the maximal violation of 2x...x2-setting Bell-type\ninequalities of any type (either on correlation functions or on joint\nprobabilities) under N-partite joint von Neumann measurements on an N-qudit\nstate. For d=2, this new upper bound coincides with the maximal violation by an\nN-qubit state of the Mermin-Klyshko inequality. Based on our results, we\ndiscuss the conceptual and mathematical advantages of context-invariant and\nlocal qHV modelling.\n", "  Recent studies at Jefferson Lab show that there are a certain proportion of\nnucleons in nuclei have momenta greater than the so-called nuclear Fermi\nmomentum $p_{F}$. Based on the transport model of nucleus-nucleus collisions at\nintermediate energies, nucleon high momentum caused by the neutron-proton\nshort-range correlations in nuclei is constrained by comparing with $\\pi$ and\nphoton experimental data and considering some uncertainties. The high momentum\ncutoff value $p_{max}$ $\\leq$ 2$p_{F}$ is obtained.\n", "  We present stellar evolution models for 0.5 - 1.2 \\Msol at scaled\nmetallicities of 0.1 - 1.5 Z\\sol and O/Fe values of 0.44 - 2.28 O/Fe\\sol. The\ntime dependent evolution of habitable zone boundaries are calculated for each\nstellar evolution track based on stellar mass, effective temperature, and\nluminosity parameterizations. The rate of change of stellar surface quantities\nand the surrounding habitable zone position are strong functions of all three\nquantities explored. The range of orbits that remain continuously habitable, or\nhabitable for at least 2 Gyr, are provided. The results show that the detailed\nchemical characterization of exoplanet host stars and a consideration of their\nevolutionary history are necessary to assess the likelihood that a planet found\nin the instantaneous habitable zone has had sufficient time to develop a\nbiosphere capable of producing detectable biosignatures. This model grid is\ndesigned for use by the astrobiology and exoplanet communities to efficiently\ncharacterize the time evolution of host stars and their habitable zones for\nplanetary candidates of interest.\n", "  The interplay between spontaneous symmetry breaking in many-body systems, the\nwavelike nature of quantum particles and lattice effects produces an\nextraordinary behavior of the chiral current of bosonic particles in the\npresence of a uniform magnetic flux defined on a two-leg ladder. While\nnon-interacting as well as strongly interacting particles, stirred by the\nmagnetic field, circulate along the system's boundary in the counterclockwise\ndirection in the ground state, interactions stabilize vortex lattices. These\nstates break translational symmetry, which can lead to a reversal of the\ncirculation direction. Our predictions could readily be accessed in quantum gas\nexperiments with existing setups or in arrays of Josephson junctions.\n", "  The conformal structure of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is analysed\nusing the extended conformal Einstein field equations. To this end, initial\ndata for an asymptotic initial value problem for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nspacetime is obtained. This initial data allows to understand the singular\nbehaviour of the conformal structure at the asymptotic points where the\nhorizons of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime meet the conformal boundary.\nUsing the insights gained from the analysis of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter\nspacetime in a conformal Gaussian gauge, we consider nonlinear perturbations\nclose to the Schwarzschild- de Sitter spacetime in the asymptotic region. We\nshow that small enough perturbations of asymptotic initial data for the\nSchwarzschild de-Sitter spacetime give rise to a solution to the Einstein field\nequations which exists to the future and has an asymptotic structure similar to\nthat of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  Ellerman bombs are transient brightenings of the wings of the solar Balmer\nlines that mark reconnection in the photosphere. Ellerman noted in 1917 that he\ndid not observe such brightenings in the Na I D and Mg I b lines. This\nnon-visibility should constrain EB interpretation, but has not been addressed\nin published bomb modeling. We therefore test Ellerman's observation and\nconfirm it using high-quality imaging spectrometry with the Swedish 1-m Solar\nTelescope. However, we find diffuse brightness in these lines that seems to\nresult from prior EBs. We tentatively suggest this is a post-bomb hot-cloud\nphenomenon also found in recent EB spectroscopy in the ultraviolet.\n", "  We construct the fcc (face centered cubic), bcc (body centered cubic) and sc\n(simple cubic) lattices as the root and the weight lattices of the affine\nCoxeter groups W(D3) and W(B3)=Aut(D3). The rank-3 Coxeter-Weyl groups\ndescribing the point tetrahedral symmetry and the octahedral symmetry of the\ncubic lattices have been constructed in terms of quaternions. Reflection planes\nof the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams are identified with certain planes of the unit\ncube. It turns out that the pyritohedral symmetry takes a simpler form in terms\nof quaternionic representation. The D3 diagram is used to construct the\nvertices of polyhedra relevant to the cubic lattices and, in particular,\nconstructions of the pseudoicosahedron and its dual pyritohedron are explicitly\nworked out.\n", "  We present the results of a 135-arcmin$^2$ search for high-redshift galaxies\nlensed by 29 clusters from the MAssive Cluster and extended MAssive Cluster\nSurveys (MACS and eMACS). We use relatively shallow images obtained with the\nHubble Space Telescope in four passbands, namely, F606W, F814W, F110W, and\nF140W. We identify 130 F814W dropouts as candidates for galaxies at $z \\le 6$.\nIn order to fit the available broad-band photometry to galaxy spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) templates, we develop a prior for the level of dust\nextinction at various redshifts. We also investigate the systematic biases\nincurred by the use of SED-fit software. The fits we obtain yield an estimate\nof 20 Lyman-break galaxies with photometric redshifts from $z \\sim 7$ to 9. In\naddition, our survey has identified over 100 candidates with a significant\nprobability of being lower-redshift ($z \\sim 2$) interlopers. We conclude that\neven as few as four broad-band filters -- when combined with fitting the SEDs\n-- are capable of isolating promising objects. Such surveys thus allow one both\nto probe the bright end ($M_{1500} \\le -19$) of the high-redshift UV luminosity\nfunction and to identify candidate massive evolved galaxies at lower redshifts.\n", "  Approximating nonlinear dynamics with a truncated perturbative expan- sion\nmay be accurate for a while, but it in general breaks down at a long time scale\nthat is one over the small expansion parameter. There are interesting occasions\nin which such breakdown does not happen. We provide a mathematically general\nand precise definition of those occasions, in which we prove that the validity\nof truncated theory trivially extends to the long time scale. This enables us\nto utilize numerical results, which are only obtainable within finite times, to\nlegitimately predict the dynamic when the expansion parameter goes to zero,\nthus the long time scale goes to infinity. In particular, this shows that\nexisting non-collapsing solutions in the AdS (in)stability problem persist to\nthe zero-amplitude limit, opposing the conjecture by Dias, Horowitz, Marolf and\nSantos that predicts a shrinkage to measure-zero [1]. We also point out why the\npersistence of collapsing solutions is harder to prove, and how the recent\ninteresting progress by Bizon, Maliborski and Rostoworowski is not there yet\n[2].\n", "  We consider the logarithmic negativity, a measure of bipartite entanglement,\nin a general unitary 1+1-dimensional massive quantum field theory, not\nnecessarily integrable. We compute the negativity between a finite region of\nlength $r$ and an adjacent semi-infinite region, and that between two\nsemi-infinite regions separated by a distance $r$. We show that the former\nsaturates to a finite value, and that the latter tends to zero, as\n$r\\rightarrow\\infty$. We show that in both cases, the leading corrections are\nexponential decays in $r$ (described by modified Bessel functions) that are\nsolely controlled by the mass spectrum of the model, independently of its\nscattering matrix. This implies that, like the entanglement entropy, the\nlogarithmic negativity displays a very high level of universality, allowing one\nto extract information about the mass spectrum. Further, a study of sub-leading\nterms shows that, unlike the entanglement entropy, a large-$r$ analysis of the\nnegativity allows for the detection of bound states.\n", "  Manipulating the flow of energy in nanoscale and molecular photonic devices\nis of both fundamental interest and central importance for applications in\nlight harvesting optoelectronics. Under erratic solar irradiance conditions,\nunregulated power fluctuations in a light harvesting photocell lead to\ninefficient energy storage in conventional solar cells and potentially fatal\noxidative damage in photosynthesis. Here, we show that regulation against these\nfluctuations arises naturally within a two-channel quantum heat engine\nphotocell, thus enabling the efficient conversion of varying incident solar\nspectrum at Earth's surface. Remarkably, absorption in the green portion of the\nspectrum is avoided, as it provides no inherent regulatory benefit. Our\nfindings illuminate a quantum structural origin of regulation, provide a novel\noptoelectronic design strategy, and may elucidate the link between\nphotoprotection in photosynthesis and the predominance of green plants on\nEarth.\n", "  In the present work the rotation of polarization vector due to the\ngravitational field of a rotating body has been derived, from the general\nexpression of Maxwell's equation in the curved space-time. Considering the far\nfield approximation (i.e impact parameter is greater than the Schwarzschild\nradius and rotation parameter), the amount of rotation of polarization vector\nas a function of impact parameter has been obtained for a rotating body\n(considering Kerr geometry). Present work shows that, the rotation of\npolarization vector can not be observed in case of Schwarzschild geometry. This\nwork also calculates the effect, considering prograde and retrograde orbit for\nthe light ray. Although the present work demonstrates the effect of rotation of\npolarization vector for electromagnetic wave (light ray), but it confirms that\nthere would be no net polarization of electromagnetic wave due to the curved\nspace-time geometry.\n", "  In this work, different computational methods such as HF, B3LYP, range\nseparated functionals (CAM-B3LYP and LC-BLYP) with 6-31G* basis set were\napplied to investigate the electronic, spectroscopic and nonlinear optical\nproperties of L-threoninium picrate (LTHP) molecule for the first time. The\ncalculated values of IR and Raman vibrational frequencies were found to be in a\ngood agreement with the experimental results. Time dependent density functional\ntheory has been applied to calculate the electronic and photophysical\nproperties such as excitation energy, dipole moment and frontier molecular\norbital (FMO) energies of LTHP molecule. The excitation energy value calculated\nby CAM-B3LYP is found to be at 351 nm which is in close agreement with the\nexperimental values. The total/partial DOS (T/PDOS) was determined using\nGGA/BLYP. The total dipole moment ({\\mu}tot), static total and anisotropy of\npolarizability ({\\alpha}tot, {\\Delta}{\\alpha}) and static first\nhyperpolarizability (\\b{eta}0, \\b{eta}tot) values were calculated and compared\nwith the reference compound. The {\\mu}tot and \\b{eta}tot are found to be 3 and\n51 time higher than urea molecule respectively. The FMOs, molecular\nelectrostatic potential (MEP), global reactivity descriptors were also\ncalculated and discussed. All these results suggest that the L-threoninium\npicrate would be a good candidate for optoelectronic device applications.\n", "  For a quantum field theory over four-dimensional Minkowski space at zero\ntemperature worldline holography states, that it can be expressed as a field\ntheory of its sources over five-dimensional AdS space to all orders in its\nelementary fields, the fifth dimension being Schwinger's proper time of the\nworldline formalism. For the finite temperatures studied here worldline\nholography yields either a thermal AdS space or an AdS black hole as\nfive-dimensional manifolds. Comparing the values of the five-dimensional action\nfor the two alternatives does not predict a phase transition as a function of\nthe temperature. This absence is crucially linked to the used coordinates, and\nworldline holography predicts the Fefferman-Graham form. For these coordinates\nthe only way to tilt the scales in favour of one or the other spacetime is to\nswitch between fermionic or bosonic elementary matter.\n", "  We have shown the existence of self-dual solutions in new Maxwell-Higgs\nscenarios where the gauge field possesses a $k$-generalized dynamic, i.e., the\nkinetic term of gauge field is a highly nonlinear function of\n$F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$. We have implemented our proposal by means of a\n$k$-generalized model displaying the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon.\nWe implement consistently the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield formalism\nproviding highly nonlinear self-dual equations whose solutions are electrically\nneutral possessing total energy proportional to the magnetic flux. Among the\ninfinite set of possible configurations, we have found families of\n$k$-generalized models whose self-dual equations have a form mathematically\nsimilar to the ones arising in the Maxwell-Higgs or Chern-Simons-Higgs models.\nFurthermore, we have verified that our proposal also supports infinite twinlike\nmodels with $|\\phi|^4$-potential or $|\\phi |^6$-potential. With the aim to show\nexplicitly that the BPS equations are able to provide well-behaved\nconfigurations, we have considered a test model in order to study axially\nsymmetric vortices. By depending of the self-dual potential, we have shown that\nthe $k$-generalized model is able to produce solutions that for long distances\nhave a exponential decay (as Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices) or have a\npower-law decay (characterizing delocalized vortices). In all cases, we observe\nthat the generalization modifies the vortex core size, the magnetic field\namplitude and the bosonic masses but the total energy remains proportional to\nthe quantized magnetic flux.\n", "  The recent experimental condensation of ultracold atoms in a triangular\noptical lattice with negative effective tunneling energies paves the way to\nstudy frustrated systems in a controlled environment. Here, we explore the\ncritical behavior of the chiral phase transition in such a frustrated lattice\nin three dimensions. We represent the low-energy action of the lattice system\nas a two-component Bose gas corresponding to the two minima of the dispersion.\nThe contact repulsion between the bosons separates into intra- and\ninter-component interactions, referred to as $V_{0}$ and $V_{12}$,\nrespectively. We first employ a Huang-Yang-Luttinger approximation of the free\nenergy. For $V_{12}/V_{0} = 2$, which corresponds to the bare interaction, this\napproach suggests a first order phase transition, at which both the U$(1)$\nsymmetry of condensation and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the emergent chiral\norder are broken simultaneously. Furthermore, we perform a renormalization\ngroup calculation at one-loop order. We demonstrate that the coupling regime\n$0<V_{12}/V_0\\leq1$ shares the critical behavior of the Heisenberg fixed point\nat $V_{12}/V_{0}=1$. For $V_{12}/V_0>1$ we show that $V_{0}$ flows to a\nnegative value, while $V_{12}$ increases and remains positive. This results in\na breakdown of the effective quartic field theory due to a cubic anisotropy,\nand again suggests a discontinuous phase transition.\n", "  Quantum physics dictates fundamental speed limits during time evolution. We\npresent a quantum speed limit governing the generation of nonclassicality and\nthe mutual incompatibility of two states connected by time evolution. This\nresult is used to characterize the timescale required to generate a given\namount of quantumness under an arbitrary physical process. The bound is shown\nto be tight under pure dephasing dynamics. More generally, our analysis reveals\nthe dependence on the initial state and non-Markovian effects.\n", "  The electronic properties of co-evaporated mixtures (blends) of manganese\nphthalocyanine and the fullerene C$_{60}$ (MnPc:C$_{60}$) have been studied as\na function of the concentration of the two constituents using two supplementary\nelectron spectroscopic methods, photoemission spectroscopy (PES) as well as\nelectron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in transmission. Our PES measurements\nprovide a detailed picture of the electronic structure measured with different\nexcitation energies as well as different mixing ratios between MnPc and\nC$_{60}$. Besides a relative energy shift, the occupied electronic states of\nthe two materials remain essentially unchanged. The observed energy level\nalignment is different compared to that of the related CuPc:C$_{60}$ bulk\nheterojunction. Moreover, the results from our EELS investigations show that\ndespite of the rather small interface interaction the MnPc related electronic\nexcitation spectrum changes significantly by admixing C$_{60}$ to MnPc thin\nfilms.\n", "  The effects of nuclear isospin asymmetry on $\\alpha$ decay lifetimes of heavy\nnuclei are investigated within various phenomenological models of nuclear\npotential for the $\\alpha$ particle. We consider the widely used simple square\nwell potential and Woods-Saxon potential, and modify them by including an\nisospin asymmetry term. We then suggest a model for the potential of the\n$\\alpha$ particle motivated by a microscopic phenomenological approach of the\nSkyrme force model, which naturally introduce the isospin dependent form of the\nnuclear potential for the $\\alpha$ particle. The empirical $\\alpha$ decay\nlifetime formula of Viola and Seaborg is also modified to include isospin\nasymmetry effects. The obtained $\\alpha$ decay half-lives are in good agreement\nwith the experimental data and we find that including the nuclear isospin\neffects somehow improves the theoretical results for $\\alpha$ decay half-lives.\nThe implications of these results are discussed and the predictions on the\n$\\alpha$ decay lifetimes of superheavy elements are also presented.\n", "  The P2 experiment in Mainz aims to measure the weak mixing angle in electron-\nproton scattering to a precision of 0.13 %. In order to suppress uncertainties\ndue to proton structure and contributions from box graphs, both a low average\nmomentum transfer $Q^2$ of $4.5\\cdot 10^{-3}$ GeV$^2/c^2$ and a low beam energy\nof 155 MeV are chosen. In order to collect the enormous statistics required for\nthis measurement, the new Mainz Energy Recovery Superconducting Accelerator\n(MESA) is being constructed. These proceedings describe the motivation for the\nmeasurement, the experimental and accelerator challenges and how we plan to\ntackle them.\n", "  The potential of elastic antineutrino-electron scattering in a Gd-doped water\nCherenkov detector to determine the direction of a nuclear reactor antineutrino\nflux was investigated using the recently proposed WATCHMAN antineutrino\nexperiment as a baseline model. The expected scattering rate was determined\nassuming a 13-km standoff from a 3.758-GWt light water nuclear reactor and the\ndetector response was modeled using a Geant4-based simulation package.\nBackground was estimated via independent simulations and by scaling published\nmeasurements from similar detectors. Background contributions were estimated\nfor solar neutrinos, misidentified reactor-based inverse beta decay\ninteractions, cosmogenic radionuclides, water-borne radon, and gamma rays from\nthe photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), detector walls, and surrounding rock. We show\nthat with the use of low background PMTs and sufficient fiducialization,\nwater-borne radon and cosmogenic radionuclides pose the largest threats to\nsensitivity. Directional sensitivity was then analyzed as a function of radon\ncontamination, detector depth, and detector size. The results provide a list of\nexperimental conditions that, if satisfied in practice, would enable\nantineutrino directional reconstruction at 3$\\sigma$ significance in large\nGd-doped water Cherenkov detectors with greater than 10-km standoff from a\nnuclear reactor.\n", "  We consider a gravitating extended object constructed from vacuum\nfluctuations of nonperturbatively quantized non-Abelian gauge fields. An\napproximate description of such an object is given by two gravitating scalar\nfields. The object has a core filled with a constant energy density of the\nvacuum fluctuations of the quantum fields. The core is located inside a\ncosmological event horizon. An exact analytical solution of the Einstein\nequations for such a core is presented. The value of the energy density of the\nvacuum fluctuations is connected with the cosmological constant.\n", "  The swimming of a sphere immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid with\ninertia is studied for surface modulations of small amplitude on the basis of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. The mean swimming velocity and the mean rate of\ndissipation are expressed as quadratic forms in term of the surface\ndisplacements. With a choice of a basis set of modes the quadratic forms\ncorrespond to two hermitian matrices. Optimization of the mean swimming\nvelocity for given rate of dissipation requires the solution of a generalized\neigenvalue problem involving the two matrices. It is found for surface\nmodulations of low multipole order that the optimal swimming efficiency depends\nin intricate fashion on a dimensionless scale number involving the radius of\nthe sphere, the period of the cycle, and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.\n", "  In this paper, we have presented the impact of swift heavy ion beam\nirradiation on the structural, microstructural, electrical and magnetic\nproperties of $Sn_{0.9}Mn_{0.1}O_{2}$ thin films. The structural and electrical\nresults have been interpreted by using properties of native or point defects,\nwhereas the magnetic and morphological variations have been explained in terms\nof conductivity of material. Efforts have been made to summarize the properties\nof all possible charged and neutral point defects ($V_{Sn}^{4-}$,\n$Sn_{i}^{4+}$, $V_{O}^{0}$, $O_{i}^{2-}$, $Sn_{O}^{4+}$, $O_{Sn}^{2-}$,\n$H_{O}^{+}$) and afterwards from the correlation between\nexperimentally-observed and theoretically-calculated results various\ninteresting conclusions have been drawn.\n", "  All the possible CP-conserving non-linear operators up to the $p^4$-order in\nthe Lagrangian expansion are analysed here for the left-right symmetric model\nin the non-linear electroweak chiral context coupled to a light dynamical\nHiggs. The low energy effects will be triggered by an emerging new physics\nfield content in the nature, more specifically, from spin-1 resonances sourced\nby the straightforward extension of the SM local gauge symmetry to the larger\nlocal group $SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$. Low energy\nphenomenology will be altered by integrating out the resonances from the\nphysical spectrum, being manifested through induced corrections onto the left\nhanded operators. Such modifications are weighted by powers of the scales ratio\nimplied by the symmetries of the model and will determine the size of the\neffective operator basis to be used. The recently observed diboson excess\naround the invariant mass 1.8-2 TeV entails a scale suppression that suggests\nto encode the low energy effects via a much smaller set of effective operators.\n", "  We present an exactly solvable extension of the quantum XY chain with longer\nrange multi-spin interactions. Topological phase transitions of the model are\nclassified in terms of the number of Majorana zero modes which are in turn\nrelated to an integer winding number. We further find a general relation\nbetween the winding number and the number of Majorana fermions at the ends of\nan open chain. The present class of exactly solvable models belong to the BDI\nclass in the Altland-Zirnbauer classification (A. Altland, M. R. Zirnbauer,\nPhys. Rev. B (1997) 55 1142) of topological superconductors. We show that time\nreversal (TR) symmetry of the spin variables translates into a peculiar\nparticle-hole transformation in the language of Jordan-Wigner (JW) fermions\nthat is accompanied by a {\\pi} shift in the wave vector ($\\pi$PH). Presence of\n$\\pi$PH symmetry restricts the winding number of TR symmetric extensions of XY\nto odd integers. The {\\pi}PH operator may serve in further detailed\nclassification of topological superconductors.\n", "  We introduce a stability criterion for quantum statistical ensembles\ndescribing macroscopic systems. An ensemble is called \"stable\" when a small\nnumber of local measurements cannot significantly modify the probability\ndistribution of the total energy of the system. We apply this criterion to\nlattices of spins-1/2, thereby showing that the canonical ensemble is nearly\nstable, whereas statistical ensembles with much broader energy distributions\nare not stable. In the context of the foundations of quantum statistical\nphysics, this result justifies the use of statistical ensembles with narrow\nenergy distributions such as canonical or microcanonical ensembles.\n", "  The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a millimeter-wavelength,\nvery-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiment that is capable of\nobserving black holes with horizon-scale resolution. Early observations have\nrevealed variable horizon-scale emission in the Galactic Center black hole,\nSagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Comparing such observations to time-dependent general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations requires statistical tools\nthat explicitly consider the variability in both the data and the models. We\ndevelop here a Bayesian method to compare time-resolved simulation images to\nvariable VLBI data, in order to infer model parameters and perform model\ncomparisons. We use mock EHT data based on GRMHD simulations to explore the\nrobustness of this Bayesian method and contrast it to approaches that do not\nconsider the effects of variability. We find that time-independent models lead\nto offset values of the inferred parameters with artificially reduced\nuncertainties. Moreover, neglecting the variability in the data and the models\noften leads to erroneous model selections. We finally apply our method to the\nearly EHT data on Sgr A*.\n", "  We describe the relationship between dimer models on the real two-torus and\ncoamoebas of curves in (\\CC^\\times)^2. We show, inter alia, that the dimer\nmodel obtained from the shell of the coamoeba is a deformation retract of the\nclosed coaomeba if and only if the number of connected components of the\ncomplement of the closed coamoeba is maximal. Furthermore, we show that in\ngeneral the closed coamoeba of the characteristic polynomial of a dimer model\ndoes not have the maximal number of components of its complement.\n", "  We consider the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the five-dimensional\nsuperconformal index and propose a novel prescription for selecting the finite\ncontributions. Applying the latter to various examples of U(1) theories, we\nfind that the 5D NS index can be reproduced using recent techniques of\nC\\'ordova and Shao, who related the 4D Schur index to the BPS spectrum of the\ntheory on the Coulomb branch. In this picture, the 5D instanton solitons are\ninterpreted as additional flavour nodes in an associated 5D BPS quiver.\n", "  For a random intersection graph with a power law degree sequence having a\nfinite mean and an infinite variance we show that the global clustering\ncoefficient admits a tunable asymptotic distribution.\n", "  We extract the macroscopic characteristics of the groundstate sectors of two\ndimensional Bose-condensed BCS models with a fixed number of magnetic flux\nquanta, on length scales much larger than the characteristic size of the\nCooper-pair bound states. We show that this reduces to the problem of computing\nthe moduli space of gauge-inequivalent solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations on a nontrivial fibre bundle. Inspired in part by the physical\narguments of Oshikawa and Senthil in Fractionalization, Topological Order, and\nQuasiparticle Statistics, we extract a large class of groundstates from this\nmoduli space.\n", "  Standard error correction techniques only provide a quantum memory and need\nextra gadgets to perform computation. Central to quantum algorithms are small\nangle rotations, which can be fault-tolerantly implemented given a supply of an\nunconventional species of magic state. We present a low-cost distillation\nroutine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on\nthe work of Duclos-Cianci and Poulin [Phys. Rev. A, 91, 042315 (2015)] by\ncompressing their circuit. Additionally, we present a method of diluting magic\nstates that reduces costs associated with very small angle rotations. We\nquantify performance by the expected number of noisy magic states consumed per\nrotation, and compare with other protocols. For modest size angles, our\nprotocols offer a factor 24 improvement over the best known gate synthesis\nprotocols and a factor 2 over the Duclos-Cianci and Poulin protocol. For very\nsmall angle rotations, the dilution protocol dramatically reduces costs, giving\nseveral orders magnitude improvement over competitors. There also exists an\nintermediary regime of small, but not very small, angles where our approach\ngives a marginal improvement over gate synthesis. We discuss how different\nperformance metrics may alter these conclusions.\n", "  The noncommutative space $\\mathbb{R}^3_\\lambda$, a deformation of\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$, supports a $3$-parameter family of gauge theory models with\ngauge-invariant harmonic term, stable vacuum and which are perturbatively\nfinite to all orders. Properties of this family are discussed. The partition\nfunction factorizes as an infinite product of reduced partition functions, each\none corresponding to the reduced gauge theory on one of the fuzzy spheres\nentering the decomposition of $\\mathbb{R}^3_\\lambda$. For a particular\nsub-family of gauge theories, each reduced partition function is exactly\nexpressible as a ratio of determinants. A relation with integrable 2-D Toda\nlattice hierarchy is indicated.\n", "  We investigate solutions $(\\mathcal{M}, g)$ to Einstein's vacuum field\nequations with positive cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ which admit a smooth\npast null infinity $\\mathcal{J}^-$ \\`a la Penrose and a Killing vector field\nwhose associated Mars-Simon tensor (MST) vanishes. The main purpose of this\nwork is to provide a characterization of these spacetimes in terms of their\nCauchy data on $\\mathcal{J}^-$.\n  Along the way, we also study spacetimes for which the MST does not vanish. In\nthat case there is an ambiguity in its definition which is captured by a scalar\nfunction $Q$. We analyze properties of the MST for different choices of $Q$. In\ndoing so, we are led to a definition of \"asymptotically Kerr-de Sitter-like\nspacetimes\", which we also characterize in terms of their asymptotic data on\n$\\mathcal{J}^-$.\n", "  We describe some basic tools in the spectral theory of Schr\\\"odinger operator\non metric graphs (also known as \"quantum graph\") by studying in detail some\nbasic examples. The exposition is kept as elementary and accessible as\npossible. In the later sections we apply these tools to prove some results on\nthe count of zeros of the eigenfunctions of quantum graphs.\n", "  A topological p-n junction (TPNJ) is an important concept to control spin and\ncharge transport on a surface of three dimensional topological insulators\n(3D-TIs). Here we report successful fabrication of such TPNJ on a surface of\n3D-TI Bi$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_y$ thin films and experimental observation\nof the electrical transport. By tuning the chemical potential of n-type\ntopological Dirac surface of BSTS on its top half by employing\ntetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane as an organic acceptor molecule, a\nhalf surface can be converted to p-type with leaving the other half side as the\nopposite n-type, and consequently TPNJ can be created. By sweeping the\nback-gate voltage in the field effect transistor structure, the TPNJ was\ncontrolled both on the bottom and the top surfaces. A dramatic change in\nelectrical transport observed at the TPNJ on 3D-TI thin films promises novel\nspin and charge transport of 3D-TIs for future spintronics.\n", "  We provide a pedagogical review of the main ideas and results in\nnon-equilibrium conformal field theory and connected subjects. These concern\nthe understanding of quantum transport and its statistics at and near critical\npoints. Starting with phenomenological considerations, we explain the general\nframework, illustrated by the example of the Heisenberg quantum chain. We then\nintroduce the main concepts underlying conformal field theory (CFT), the\nemergence of critical ballistic transport, and the CFT scattering construction\nof non-equilibrium steady states. Using this we review the theory for energy\ntransport in homogeneous one-dimensional critical systems, including the\ncomplete description of its large deviations and the resulting (extended)\nfluctuation relations. We generalize some of these ideas to one-dimensional\ncritical charge transport and to the presence of defects, as well as beyond\none-dimensional criticality. We describe non-equilibrium transport in\nfree-particle models, where connections are made with generalized Gibbs\nensembles, and in higher-dimensional and non-integrable quantum field theories,\nwhere the use of the powerful hydrodynamic ideas for non-equilibrium steady\nstates is explained. We finish with a list of open questions. The review does\nnot assume any advanced prior knowledge of conformal field theory,\nlarge-deviation theory or hydrodynamics.\n", "  Our goal is to unravel the mechanisms that lead to failure of a ductile\ntwo-phase material - that consists of a ductile soft phase and a relatively\nbrittle hard phase. An idealized microstructural model is used to study damage\npropagation systematically and transparently. The analysis uncovers distinct\nmicrostructural features around early voids, whereby regions of the hard phase\nare aligned with the tensile axis and regions of the soft phase are aligned\nwith the shear directions. These features are consistently found in regions\nexhibiting damage propagation, whereby the damage remains initiation driven,\ni.e. voids nucleate independently of each other. Upon localization, damage is\ncontrolled on a longer length-scale relying on a critical relative position of\n'initiation hot-spots'. The damage rapidly increases in bands of the soft phase\nwherein several voids are aligned with the shear directions. The relative\narrangement of the voids determines whether the microstructure fails early, or\nat a substantially higher strain. Although much research is needed to refine\nthese findings for real or more realistic microstructures, in particular in\nthree-dimensions, this paper opens a route to a deeper understanding of the\nultimate failure of multi-phase materials.\n", "  We develop the complete theory for non-Abelian braiding of Majorana Kramers'\npairs (MKPs) in time-reversal (TR) invariant topological superconductors. By\nintroducing an effective Hamiltonian approach to describe the braiding of MKPs,\nwe show that the non-Abelian braiding is protected when the effective\nHamiltonian exhibits a new TR like anti-unitary symmetry, which is satisfied if\nthe system is free of dynamical noise. Importantly, even the dynamical noise\nmay not cause error in braiding, unless the noise correlation function breaks a\ndynamical TR symmetry, which generalizes the TR symmetry protection of MKPs to\ndynamical regime. Moreover, the resulted error by noise is shown to be a higher\norder effect, compared with the decoherence of Majorana qubits without TR\nsymmetry protection. These results show that the non-Abelian braiding of MKPs\nis observable and may have versatile applications to future quantum computation\ntechnologies.\n", "  We report an unconventional behavior of electron transport in the limit of\nzero magnetic flux in a one-dimensional disordered ring, be it completely\nrandom or any correlated one, subjected to Rashba spin-orbit (SO) coupling. It\nexhibits much higher circulating current compared to a fully perfect ring for a\nwide range of SO coupling yielding larger electrical conductivity which is\nclearly verified from our Drude weight analysis.\n", "  A challenge for constructing large circuits of superconducting qubits is to\nbalance addressability, coherence and coupling strength. High coherence can be\nattained by building circuits from fixed-frequency qubits, however, leading\ntechniques cannot couple qubits that are far detuned. Here we introduce a\nmethod based on a tunable bus which allows for the coupling of two\nfixed-frequency qubits even at large detunings. By parametrically oscillating\nthe bus at the qubit-qubit detuning we enable a resonant exchange (XX+YY)\ninteraction. We use this interaction to implement a 183ns two-qubit iSWAP gate\nbetween qubits separated in frequency by 854MHz with a measured average\nfidelity of 0.9823(4) from interleaved randomized benchmarking. This gate may\nbe an enabling technology for surface code circuits and for analog quantum\nsimulation.\n", "  A $(1+1)$ dimensional model where vector and axial vector interaction get\nmixed up with different weight is considered with a generalized masslike term\nfor gauge field. Through Poincar\\'e algebra it has been made confirm that only\na Lorentz covariant masslike term leads to a physically sensible theory as long\nas the number of constraints in the phase space is two. With that admissible\nmasslike term, phase space structure of this model with proper identification\nof physical canonical pair has been determined using Diracs' scheme of\nquantization of constrained system. The bosonized version of the model remains\ngauge non-invariant to start with. Therefore, with the inclusion of appropriate\nWess-Zumino term it is made gauge symmetric. An alternative quantization has\nbeen carried out over this gauge symmetric version to determine the phase space\nstructure in this situation. To establish that the Wess-Zumino fields allocates\nthemselves in the un-physical sector of the theory an attempts has been made to\nget back the usual theory from the gauge symmetric theory of the extended\nphase-space without hampering any physical principle. It has been found that\nthe role of gauge fixing is crucial for this transmutation.\n", "  The search for topological superconductors (TSCs) is one of the most urgent\ncontemporary problems in condensed matter systems. TSCs are characterized by a\nfull superconducting gap in the bulk and topologically protected gapless\nsurface (or edge) states. Within each vortex core of TSCs, there exist the zero\nenergy Majorana bound states, which are predicted to exhibit non-Abelian\nstatistics and to form the basis of the fault-tolerant quantum computation. So\nfar, no stoichiometric bulk material exhibits the required topological surface\nstates (TSSs) at Fermi level combined with fully gapped bulk superconductivity.\nHere, we report atomic scale visualization of the TSSs of the\nnon-centrosymmetric fully-gapped superconductor, PbTaSe2. Using quasiparticle\nscattering interference (QPI) imaging, we find two TSSs with a Dirac point at\nE~1.0eV, of which the inner TSS and partial outer TSS cross Fermi level, on the\nPb-terminated surface of this fully gapped superconductor. This discovery\nreveals PbTaSe2 as a promising candidate as a TSC.\n", "  We propose a simple mechanism for copiously producing heavy Higgs bosons with\nenhanced decay rates to two photons at the LHC, within the context of the\nMinimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). In the\nCP-conserving limit of the theory, such a diphoton resonance may be identified\nwith the heavier CP-even $H$ boson, whose gluon-fusion production and decay\ninto two photons are enhanced by loops of the lightest supersymmetric partner\nof the top quark $\\tilde{t}_1$ when its mass $m_{\\tilde{t}_1}$ happens to be\nnear the $\\tilde{t}^*_1\\tilde{t}_1$ threshold, i.e.~for\n$m_{\\tilde{t}_1}\\!\\simeq \\!\\frac12 M_H$. The scenario requires a relatively low\nsupersymmetry-breaking scale $M_S\\stackrel{<}{{}_\\sim} 1$ TeV, but large values\nof the higgsino mass parameter, $\\mu \\stackrel{>}{{}_\\sim} 1$ TeV, that lead to\na strong $H \\tilde{t}^*_1 \\tilde{t}_1$ coupling. Such parameters can\naccommodate the observed mass and standard-like couplings of the 125 GeV $h$\nboson in the MSSM, while satisfying all other constraints from the LHC and dark\nmatter searches. Additional enhancement to the diphoton rate could be provided\nby Coulombic QCD corrections and, to a lesser extent, by resonant contributions\ndue to $\\tilde{t}_1^* \\tilde{t}_1$ bound states. To discuss the characteristic\nfeatures of such a scenario, we consider as an illustrative example the case of\na diphoton resonance with a mass of approximately 750 GeV, for which an excess\nwas observed in the early LHC 13 TeV data and which later turned out to be\nsimply a statistical fluctuation.\n", "  Graphene and single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) have attracted great\nattention because of their ultra-high thermal conductivity. However, there are\nfew works exploring the relations of their thermal conductivity quantitatively.\nThe carbon nanocone (CNC) is a graded structure fall in between graphene disk\n(GD) and SWCNT. We perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation\nto study the thermal conductivity of CNC with different apex angles, and then\ncompare them with that of GD and SWCNT. Our results show that, different from\nthe homogeneous thermal conductivity in SWCNT, the CNC also has a natural\ngraded thermal conductivity which is similar to the GD. Unexpectedly, the\ngraded rate keeps almost the same when the apex angle decreases from 180{\\deg}\n(GD) to 19{\\deg}, but then suddenly declines to zero when the apex angle\ndecreases from 19{\\deg} to 0{\\deg} (SWCNT). What is more interesting, the\ngraded effect is not diminished when the interatomic force constant is weakened\nand mean free path is shorten. That is, besides nanoscale, the graded effect\ncan be observed in macroscale graphene or CNC structures.\n", "  We consider two minimal models of active fluid droplets that exhibit complex\ndynamics including steady motion, deformation, rotation and oscillating motion.\nFirst we consider a droplet with a concentration of active contractile matter\nadsorbed to its boundary. We analytically predict activity driven instabilities\nin the concentration profile, and compare them to the dynamics we find from\nsimulations. Secondly, we consider a droplet of active polar fluid of constant\nconcentration. In this system we predict, motion and deformation of the\ndroplets in certain activity ranges due to instabilities in the polarisation\nfield. Both these systems show spontaneous transitions to motility and\ndeformation which resemble dynamics of the cell cytoskeleton in animal cells.\n", "  An active learning physics course (treatment) was re-organized in an attempt\nto increase students' problem solving abilities. This re-organized course\ncovered all of the relevant concepts in the first 6 weeks with the final 4\nweeks spent in practice at solving complicated problems (those requiring\nstudents to use higher order cognitive abilities). A second active learning\ncourse (control) was taught in the same quarter by the same instructor using\nthe same curricular materials but covering material in the standard\n(chapter-by-chapter) order. After accounting for incoming student\ncharacteristics, students from the treatment course scored significantly better\nthan the control for two outcome measures: i) the final exam and ii) their\nimmediately subsequent physics course. More importantly, students from minority\ngroups who are underrepresented in physics had final exam scores as well as\nclass grades that were indistinguishable from the rest of their class if and\nonly if they were in the treatment class. Finally, many of the students in this\ncohort took a Concepts First course in their third quarter of introductory\nphysics. The students who took at least one Concepts First course are found to\nhave significantly higher rates of graduation with a STEM major than those\nstudents from this cohort who did not take a Concepts First course.\n", "  We have investigated the impact of photoionization and radiation pressure on\na dusty star-forming cloud using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic\nsimulations, which include absorption and re-emission of photons by dust. We\nfind that, in a cloud of mass 10^5 Msun and radius 17 pc, the effect of\nradiation pressure is negligible when star formation efficiency is 2%. The\nimportance of radiation pressure increases with increasing star formation\nefficiency or an increasing dust-to-gas mass ratio. The net effect of radiation\nfeedback, however, becomes smaller with the increasing dust-to-gas mass ratio,\nsince the absorption of ultra-violet photons by dust grains suppresses\nphotoionization and hence photoheating.\n", "  Weyl consistency conditions have been used in unitary relativistic quantum\nfield theory to impose constraints on the renormalization group flow of certain\nquantities. We classify the Weyl anomalies and their renormalization scheme\nambiguities for generic non-relativistic theories in 2+1 dimensions with\nanisotropic scaling exponent z=2; the extension to other values of z are\ndiscussed as well. We give the consistency conditions among these anomalies. As\nan application we find several candidates for a C-theorem. We comment on\npossible candidates for a $C$-theorem in higher dimensions.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled nanowire quantum dot, driven\nby external electric and magnetic fields, and theoretically formulate an\nelectric mechanism to interfere its electron orbits. Owing to the existence of\nspin-orbit coupling and a pulsed electric field, different spin-orbit states\nare shown to interfere with each other, generating intriguing\ninterference-resonant patterns. We also reveal that an in-plane magnetic field\ndoes not affect the strength interval of any neighboring resonant peaks, but\ncontributes a weak shift of each peak, which is sensitive to the direction of\nthe magnetic field. We find that this proposed external-field-controlled scheme\nshould be regarded as a new type of quantum-dot-based interferometry. Finally,\nthis interferometry has an important application in precisely measuring\nrelative experimental parameters, such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit-coupling strengths, as well as the Lande-g factor.\n", "  Based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics we derive a set of general equations\nrelating the partial volumetric flow rates to each other and to the total\nvolumetric flow rate in immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. These\nequations together with the conservation of saturation reduces the immiscible\ntwo-phase flow problem to a single-phase flow problem of a complex fluid. We\ndiscuss the new equation in terms of the relative permeability equations. We\ntest the equations on model systems, both analytically and numerically.\n", "  The high production rate and $\\langle x_{F} \\rangle > 0.33$ of the doubly\ncharmed baryons measured by the SELEX experiment is not amenable to\nperturbative QCD analysis. In this paper we calculate the production of the\ndoubly heavy baryons with the double intrinsic charm Fock states whose\nexistence is rigorously predicted by QCD. The production rate and the\nlongitudinal momentum distribution are both reproduced. We also show that the\nproduction rates of the doubly charmed baryons and double $J/\\psi $ production\nobserved by NA3 collaboration are comparable. Recent experimental results are\nreviewed. The production cross section of the doubly charmed baryons at a\nfixed-target experiment at the LHC is presented.\n", "  The pulse-train technique within ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy is\ntheoretically investigated to enhance a specific coherent phonon mode while\nsuppressing the other phonon modes generated in single wall carbon nanotubes\n(SWNTs). In particular, we focus on the selectivity of the radial breathing\nmode (RBM) and the G-band for a given SWNT. We find that if the repetition\nperiod of the pulse train matches with integer multiple of the RBM phonon\nperiod, the RBM amplitude could be kept while the amplitudes of the other modes\nare suppressed. As for the G-band, when we apply a repetition period of\nhalf-integer multiple of the RBM period, the RBM could be suppressed because of\ndestructive interference, while the G-band still survives. It is also possible\nto keep the G-band and suppress the RBM by applying a repetition period that\nmatches with integer multiple of the G-band phonon period. However, in this\ncase we have to use a large number of laser pulses having a property of \"magic\nratio\" of the G-band and RBM periods.\n", "  The transport of molecules in confined media is subject to entropic barriers.\nSo theoretically, asymmetry of the confinement length may lead to molecular\nratchets with entropy as the only driving force for the biased transport. We\naddress experimentally this question by performing alternative ionic current\nmeasurements on electrolytes confined in neutral conical nanopores. In case\nanions and cations widely differ in size, we show that rectification of ionic\ncurrent can be obtained that depends on ions size and cycle frequency,\nconsistently with the entropic ratchet mechanism.\n", "  The inclusive cross section of top quark-antiquark pairs produced in\n$p\\bar{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV is measured in the lepton$+$jets\nand dilepton decay channels. The data sample corresponds to 9.7 fb${}^{-1}$ of\nintegrated luminosity recorded with the D0 detector during Run II of the\nFermilab Tevatron Collider. Employing multivariate analysis techniques we\nmeasure the cross section in the two decay channels and we perform a combined\ncross section measurement. For a top quark mass of 172.5 GeV, we measure a\ncombined inclusive top quark-antiquark pair production cross section of\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}} = 7.26 \\pm\n0.13\\,(\\mathrm{stat.})\\,^{+0.57}_{-0.50}\\,(\\mathrm{syst.})$ pb which is\nconsistent with standard model predictions. We also perform a likelihood fit to\nthe measured and predicted top quark mass dependence of the inclusive cross\nsection, which yields a measurement of the pole mass of the top quark. The\nextracted value is $m_t = 172.8 \\pm\n1.1\\,(\\mathrm{theo.})\\,^{+3.3}_{-3.1}\\,(\\mathrm{exp.})$ GeV.\n", "  We perform a low-mass dark matter search using an exposure of\n30\\,kg$\\times$yr with the XENON100 detector. By dropping the requirement of a\nscintillation signal and using only the ionization signal to determine the\ninteraction energy, we lowered the energy threshold for detection to 0.7\\,keV\nfor nuclear recoils. No dark matter detection can be claimed because a complete\nbackground model cannot be constructed without a primary scintillation signal.\nInstead, we compute an upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section\nunder the assumption that every event passing our selection criteria could be a\nsignal event. Using an energy interval from 0.7\\,keV to 9.1\\,keV, we derive a\nlimit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section that excludes WIMPs\nwith a mass of 6\\,GeV/$c^2$ above $1.4 \\times 10^{-41}$\\,cm$^2$ at 90\\%\nconfidence level.\n", "  We present a new scheme for quantum interfaces to accomplish the\ninterconversion of photonic qubits and spin qubits based on optomechanical\nresonators and the spin-orbit-induced interactions in suspended carbon nanotube\nquantum dots. This interface implements quantum spin transducers and further\nenables electrical manipulation of local electron spin qubits, which lays the\nfoundation for all-electrical control of state transfer protocols between two\ndistant quantum nodes in a quantum network. We numerically evaluate the state\ntransfer processes and proceed to estimate the effect of each coupling strength\non the operation fidelities.\n", "  We present a feasible protocol to mimic topological Weyl semimetal phase in a\nsmall one-dimensional circuit-QED lattice. By modulating the photon hopping\nrates and on-site photon frequencies in parametric spaces, we demonstrate that\nthe momentum space of this one-dimensional lattice model can be artificially\nmapped to three dimensions accompanied by the emergence of topological Weyl\nsemimetal phase. Furthermore, via a lattice-based cavity input-output process,\nwe show that all the essential topological features of Weyl semimetal phase,\nincluding the topological charge associated with each Weyl point and the open\nFermi arcs, can be unambiguously detected in a circuit with four dissipative\nresonators by measuring the reflection spectra. These remarkable features may\nopen a new prospect in using well-controlled small quantum lattices to mimic\nand study topological phases.\n", "  Klein tunneling refers to the absence of normal backscattering of electrons\neven under the case of high potential barriers. At the barrier interface, the\nperfect matching of electron and hole wavefunctions enables a unit transmission\nprobability for normally incident electrons. It is theoretically and\nexperimentally well understood in two-dimensional relativistic materials such\nas graphene. Here we investigate the Klein tunneling effect in Weyl semimetals\nunder the influence of magnetic field induced by anti-symmetric ferromagnetic\nstripes placed at barrier boundaries. Our results show that the resonance of\nFermi wave vector at specific barrier lengths gives rise to perfect\ntransmission rings, i.e., three-dimensional analogue of the so-called magic\ntransmission angles in two-dimensional Dirac semimetals. Besides, the\ntransmission profile can be shifted by application of magnetic field, a\nproperty which may be utilized in electro-optic applications. When the applied\npotential is close to the Fermi level, a particular incident vector can be\nselected for transmission by tuning the applied magnetic field, thus enabling\nhighly selective transmission of electrons in the bulk of Weyl semimetals. Our\nanalytical and numerical calculations obtained by considering Dirac electrons\nin three regions and using experimentally feasible parameters can pave the way\nfor relativistic tunneling applications in Weyl semimetals.\n", "  The doubly special relativity (DSR) theories are investigated in order to\ntake into account an observer-independent length scale in special relativity\nframework. It is widely believed that any quantum theory of gravity would\nreduce to a DSR model at the flat limit when purely gravitational and quantum\nmechanical effects are negligible. Gravity's rainbow is a simple generalization\nof DSR theories to incorporate gravity. In this paper, we show that the\neffective Friedmann equations that are suggested by loop quantum cosmology\n(LQC) can be exactly reobtained in rainbow cosmology setup. The deformed\ngeometry of LQC then completely fixes the modified dispersion relation and\nresults in unique DSR model. In comparison with standard LQC scenario where\nonly the geometry is modified, both of the geometry and matter parts get\nmodifications in our setup. In this respect, we find that the total number of\nmicrostates for the universe is finite which suggests the statistical origin\nfor the energy and entropy density bounds. These results explicitly show that\nthe DSR theories are appropriate candidates for the flat limit of loop quantum\ngravity.\n", "  We compute the resummed on-shell $W^+ W^-$ production cross section under a\njet-veto at the LHC to partial N$^3$LL order matched to the fixed order NNLO\nresult. Differential NNLO cross sections are obtained from an implementation of\n$q_T$ subtraction in Sherpa. The two-loop virtual corrections to the $q \\bar q\n\\rightarrow W^+ W^-$ amplitude, used in both fixed order and resummation\npredictions, are extracted from the public code {\\tt qqvvamp}. We perform\nresummation using soft collinear effective theory (SCET), with approximate beam\nfunctions where only the logarithmic terms are included at two-loop. In\naddition to scale uncertainties from the hard matching scale and the\nfactorization scale, rapidity scale variations are obtained within the analytic\nregulator approach. Our resummation results show a decrease in the jet-veto\ncross-section compared to NNLO fixed order predictions, with reduced scale\nuncertainties compared to NNLL+NLO resummed predictions. We include the\nloop-induced $gg$ contribution with jet veto resummation to NLL+LO. The\nprediction shows good agreement with recent LHC measurements.\n", "  We initiate the calculation of loop corrections to correlation functions in\n4D defect CFTs. More precisely, we consider N=4 SYM with a codimension-one\ndefect separating two regions of space, x_3>0 and x_3<0, where the gauge group\nis SU(N) and SU(N-k), respectively. This set-up is made possible by some of the\nreal scalar fields acquiring a non-vanishing and x_3-dependent vacuum\nexpectation value for x_3>0. The holographic dual is the D3-D5 probe brane\nsystem where the D5 brane geometry is AdS_4 x S^2 and a background gauge field\nhas k units of flux through the S^2. We diagonalise the mass matrix of the\ndefect CFT making use of fuzzy-sphere coordinates and we handle the\nx_3-dependence of the mass terms in the 4D Minkowski space propagators by\nreformulating these as standard massive AdS_4 propagators. Furthermore, we show\nthat only two Feynman diagrams contribute to the one-loop correction to the\none-point function of any single-trace operator and we explicitly calculate\nthis correction in the planar limit for the simplest chiral primary. The result\nof this calculation is compared to an earlier string-theory computation in a\ncertain double-scaling limit, finding perfect agreement. Finally, we discuss\nhow to generalise our calculation to any single-trace operator, to finite N and\nto other types of observables such as Wilson loops.\n", "  Regarding three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators and semimetals as a\nstack of constituent 2D topological (or sometimes non-topological) layers is a\nuseful viewpoint. Primarily, concrete theoretical models of the paradigmatic 3D\ntopological phases such as Weyl semimetal (WSM), strong and weak topological\ninsulators (STI/WTI), and Chern insulator (CI), are often constructed in that\nway. Secondarily, fabrication of the corresponding 3D topological material is\nalso done in the same spirit; epitaxial growth technique is employed, making\nthe resulting sample in the form of a thin film. Here, in this paper we\ncalculate $\\mathbb{Z}$- and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-indices and study evolution of the\ntopological properties of such thin films of 3D topological systems, making\nalso a comparative study of CI- vs. TI-type models belonging to different\nsymmetry classes in this respect. Through this comparative study we suggest\nthat WSM is to CI as STI is to WTI. Finally, to test the robustness of our\nscenario against disorder and relevance to experiments we have also studied\nnumerically the two-terminal conductance of the system using transfer matrix\nmethod.\n", "  We investigate characteristic features of both non-interacting and\ninteracting electrons in a M\\\"{o}bius strip, the simplest possible one-sided\ntopological system, in presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux $\\phi$. Using\nHartree-Fock mean field theory we determine energy eigenvalues for the\ninteracting model, while for the non-interacting system an analytical\nprescription is given. The interplay between longitudinal and vertical motions\nof electrons along with on-site Hubbard interaction yield several anomalous\nfeatures of persistent current associated with energy-flux characteristics. The\nvariation of current with system size and its temperature dependences are also\ncritically examined. Current is highly sensitive to both these two factors, and\nwe find that for a particular system size it decreases exponentially with\ntemperature. Our analysis can be helpful in investigating electronic transport\nthrough any non-trivial topological material.\n", "  In the present article the existence of the Weyl representation for the\ncanonical commutation relations algebras was proved in a Krein space.\n", "  Modern semiconductor detectors allow for charged particle tracking with ever\nincreasing position resolution. Due to the reduction of the spatial hit\nuncertainties, multiple Coulomb scattering in the detector layers becomes the\ndominant source for tracking uncertainties. In this case long distance effects\ncan be ignored for the momentum measurement, and the track fit can consequently\nbe formulated as a sum of independent fits to hit triplets. In this paper we\npresent an analytical solution for a three-dimensional triplet(s) fit in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field based on a multiple scattering model. Track fitting\nof hit triplets is performed using a linearization ansatz. The momentum\nresolution is discussed for a typical spectrometer setup. Furthermore the track\nfit is compared with other track fits for two different pixel detector\ngeometries, namely the Mu3e experiment at PSI and a typical high-energy\ncollider experiment. For a large momentum range the triplets fit provides a\nsignificantly better performance than a single helix fit. The triplets fit is\nfast and can easily be parallelized, which makes it ideal for the\nimplementation on parallel computing architectures.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide MoTe$_2$ is an important candidate for\nrealizing the newly predicted type-IIWeyl fermions, for which the breaking of\nthe inversion symmetry is a prerequisite. Here we present direct spectroscopic\nevidence for the inversion symmetry breaking in the low temperature phase of\nMoTe$_2$ by systematic Raman experiments and first principles calculations. We\nidentify five lattice vibrational modes which are Raman active only in\nnoncentrosymmetric structure at low temperature. A hysteresis is also observed\nin the peak intensity of inversion symmetry activated Raman modes, confirming a\ntemperature induced structural phase transition with a concomitant change in\nthe inversion symmetry. Our results provide definitive evidence for the low\ntemperature noncentrosymmetric T$_d$ phase from vibrational spectroscopy, and\nsuggest MoTe$_2$ as an ideal candidate for investigating the temperature\ninduced topological phase transition.\n", "  We assume that the unperturbed operators $A_0$ are known. Then, the fact that\nthe scattering operators $S$ and the unperturbed operators $A_0$ are pairwise\npermutable provides some important information about the structure of the\nscattering operators. Using this information and the ideas from the theory of\ngeneralized wave operators, we present a new approach to the divergence\nproblems in quantum electrodynamics. We show that the so called infrared\ndivergences appeared because the deviations of the initial and final waves from\nthe free waves were not taken into account.\n", "  The nucleon single-particle energies (SPEs) of the selected nuclei, that is,\n16O, 40Ca, and 56Ni, are obtained by using the diagonal matrix elements of\ntwo-body effective interaction, which generated through the lowest order\nconstrained variational (LOCV) calculations for the symmetric nuclear matter\nwith the AV18 phenomenological nucleon-nucleon potential. The SPEs at the major\nlevels of nuclei are calculated by employing a Hartree-Fock inspired scheme in\nthe spherical harmonic oscillator basis. In the scheme, the correlation\ninfluences are taken into account by imposing the nucleon effective mass factor\non the radial wave functions of the major levels. Replacing the\ndensity-dependent one-body momentum distribution functions of nucleons,\nn(k,rho), with the Heaviside functions, the role of n(k,rho) on the nucleon\nSPEs at the major levels of the selected closed shell nuclei, is investigated.\nThe best fit of spin-orbit splitting is taken into account when correcting the\nmajor levels of the nuclei by using the parameterized Wood-Saxon potential and\nthe AV18 density-dependent mean field potential which is constructed by the\nLOCV method. Considering the point-like protons in the spherical Coulomb\npotential well, the single-proton energies are corrected. The results show the\nimportance of including n(k,rho), instead of the Heaviside functions, in the\ncalculation of nucleon SPEs at the different levels, particularly the valence\nlevels, of the closed shell nuclei.\n", "  We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on the Metropolis\nalgorithm for simulation of the flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous\nmedium under macroscopic steady-state conditions using a dynamical pore network\nmodel that tracks the motion of the fluid interfaces. The Monte Carlo algorithm\nis based on the configuration probability, where a configuration is defined by\nthe positions of all fluid interfaces. We show that the configuration\nprobability is proportional to the inverse of the flow rate. Using a\ntwo-dimensional network, advancing the interfaces using time integration the\ncomputational time scales as the linear system size to the fourth power,\nwhereas the Monte Carlo computational time scales as the linear size to the\nsecond power. We discuss the strengths and the weaknesses of the algorithm.\n", "  A search is presented for physics beyond the standard model in final states\nwith two opposite-sign, same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse\nmomentum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\ninverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected\nwith the CMS detector at the LHC in 2015. The analysis uses the invariant mass\nof the lepton pair, searching for a kinematic edge or a resonant-like excess\ncompatible with the Z boson mass. Both search modes use several event\ncategories in order to increase the sensitivity to new physics. These\ncategories are based on the rapidity of the leptons, the multiplicity of jets\nand b jets, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta, and missing transverse\nmomentum. The observations in all signal regions are consistent with the\nexpectations from the standard model, and the results are interpreted in the\ncontext of simplified models of supersymmetry.\n", "  At translinear scales, the log power spectrum captures significantly more\ncosmological information than the standard power spectrum. At high wavenumbers\n$k$, the Fisher information in the standard power spectrum $P(k)$ fails to\nincrease in proportion to $k$ in part due to correlations between large- and\nsmall-scale modes. As a result, $P(k)$ suffers from an information plateau on\nthese translinear scales, so that analysis with the standard power spectrum\ncannot access the information contained in these small-scale modes. The log\npower spectrum $P_A(k)$, on the other hand, captures the majority of this\notherwise lost information. Until now there has been no means of predicting the\namplitude of the log power spectrum apart from cataloging the results of\nsimulations. We here present a cosmology-independent prescription for the log\npower spectrum; this prescription displays accuracy comparable to that of Smith\net al. (2003), over a range of redshifts and smoothing scales, and for\nwavenumbers up to $1.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$.\n", "  Open-ended evolution (OEE) is relevant to a variety of biological, artificial\nand technological systems, but has been challenging to reproduce in silico.\nMost theoretical efforts focus on key aspects of open-ended evolution as it\nappears in biology. We recast the problem as a more general one in dynamical\nsystems theory, providing simple criteria for open-ended evolution based on two\nhallmark features: unbounded evolution and innovation. We define unbounded\nevolution as patterns that are non-repeating within the expected Poincare\nrecurrence time of an equivalent isolated system, and innovation as\ntrajectories not observed in isolated systems. As a case study, we implement\nnovel variants of cellular automata (CA) in which the update rules are allowed\nto vary with time in three alternative ways. Each is capable of generating\nconditions for open-ended evolution, but vary in their ability to do so. We\nfind that state-dependent dynamics, widely regarded as a hallmark of life,\nstatistically out-performs other candidate mechanisms, and is the only\nmechanism to produce open-ended evolution in a scalable manner, essential to\nthe notion of ongoing evolution. This analysis suggests a new framework for\nunifying mechanisms for generating OEE with features distinctive to life and\nits artifacts, with broad applicability to biological and artificial systems.\n", "  Symmetric ensembles of neutral atoms interacting via the Rydberg blockade are\nwell-described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We use this framework to\nstudy the problem of generating arbitrary superpositions of Dicke states of\nhyperfine qubits in such ensembles. The combination of the symmetric Rydberg\nblockade and microwaves that drive the qubits with a time-dependent phase is\nsufficient to make these ensembles completely controllable, in the sense that\none can generate an arbitrary unitary transformation on the system. We apply\nthis to the problem of state mapping. With currently feasible parameters, it is\npossible to generate arbitrary symmetric states of ~ 10 hypefine qubits with\nhigh fidelity in ~ 1 microsecond, assuming fast microwave phase switching\ntimes. To reduce the requirements on phase switching, we propose a \"dressed\nground control\" scheme, in which the control task is simplified by restricting\nthe system's dynamics to the dressed ground subspace.\n", "  We reveal that for the single Anderson impurity localized between\nnon-magnetic leads of the tunneling contact $\"$magnetic$\"$ state can be\ndistinguished from the $\"$paramagnetic$\"$ one only by the analysis of the\nnon-stationary system characteristics or the behavior of the second order\ncorrelation functions for the localized electrons occupation numbers. We\ninvestigate the response of the system to the sudden shift of the applied bias\nand to the switching $\"$on$\"$ the coupling to the second lead of the tunneling\ncontact. We demonstrate that in addition to the changes of the relaxation\nregimes and typical relaxation time scales, non-stationary spin-polarized\ncurrents flowing in the both leads are present in the system. Spin polarization\nand direction of the non-stationary currents in each lead can be simultaneously\ninverted by the sudden changing of the applied bias voltage.\n", "  We have calculated microscopically bulk viscosity of hadronic matter, where\nequilibrium thermodynamics for all hadrons in medium are described by Hadron\nResonance Gas (HRG) model. Considering pions and nucleons as abundant medium\nconstituents, we have calculated their thermal widths, which inversely control\nthe strength of bulk viscosities for respective components and represent their\nin-medium scattering probabilities with other mesonic and baryonic resonances,\npresent in the medium. Our calculations show that bulk viscosity increases with\nboth temperature and baryon chemical potential, whereas viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio decreases with temperature and with baryon chemical potential,\nthe ratio increases first and then decreases. The decreasing nature of the\nratio with temperature is observed in most of the earlier investigations with\nfew exceptions. We find that the temperature dependence of bulk viscosity\ncrucially depends on the structure of the relaxation time. Along the chemical\nfreeze-out line in nucleus-nucleus collisions with increasing collision energy,\nbulk viscosity as well as the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio\ndecreases, which also agrees with earlier references. Our results indicate the\npicture of a strongly coupled hadronic medium.\n", "  An implementation of a small quantum absorption refrigerator in a circuit QED\narchitecture is proposed. The setup consists of three harmonic oscillators\ncoupled to a Josephson unction. The refrigerator is autonomous in the sense\nthat it does not require any external control for cooling, but only thermal\ncontact between the oscillators and heat baths at different temperatures. In\naddition, the setup features a built-in switch, which allows the cooling to be\nturned on and off. If timing control is available, this enables the possibility\nfor coherence-enhanced cooling. Finally, we show that significant cooling can\nbe achieved with experimentally realistic parameters and that our setup should\nbe within reach of current technology.\n", "  We investigate the effect of adiabatic regularization on both the tensor- and\nscalar-perturbation power spectra in \\textit{nonminimally} coupled chaotic\ninflation. Similar to that of the \\textit{minimally} coupled general\nsingle-field inflation, we find that the subtraction term is suppressed by an\nexponentially decaying factor involving the number of $ e $-folds. By following\nthe subtraction term long enough beyond horizon crossing, the regularized power\nspectrum tends to the \"bare\" power spectrum. This study justifies the use of\nthe unregularized (\"bare\") power spectrum in standard calculations.\n", "  This letter examines diagrammatic cancellations for Quantum Electrodynamics\n(QED) in the general linear gauge. These cancellations combine Feynman graphs\nof various topologies and provide a method to reconstruct the gauge dependence\nof the electron propagator from the result of a particular gauge by means of a\nlinear Dyson-Schwinger equation. We use this method in combination with\ndimensional regularization to demonstrate how the 3-loop ${\\epsilon}$-expansion\nin the Feynman gauge determines the ${\\epsilon}$-expansions for all gauge\nparameter dependent terms to 4 loops.\n", "  The standard deviation (SD) quantifies the spread of the observed values on a\nmeasurement of an observable. In this paper, we study the distribution of SD\namong the different components of a superposition state. It is found that the\nSD of an observable on a superposition state can be well bounded by the SDs of\nthe superposed states. We also show that the bounds also serve as good bounds\non coherence of a superposition state. As a further generalization, we give an\nalternative definition of incompatibility of two observables subject to a given\nstate and show how the incompatibility subject to a superposition state is\ndistributed.\n", "  Previous work on the AdS instability problem within the two-time framework\n(TTF) has found an \"oscillating singularity\" whose presence depends on the\ngauge choice. We give a physical interpretation of this singularity as a\ndiverging redshift between the boundary and the center of AdS. This signals a\ngenuine breakdown of the linearized gravity. One can also identify the\ndiverging redshift through a back-reaction calculation purely in the boundary\ngauge, where the TTF result stays regular.\n", "  In the present paper we generate a set of solutions describing the interior\nof a compact star under $f(R,T)$ theory of gravity which admits conformal\nmotion. We consider the equation of state (EOS) $p=\\omega\\rho$ with\n$0<\\omega<1$ for the fluid distribution consisting normal matter, $\\omega$\nbeing the EOS parameter. We therefore explore several aspects of the model\nanalytically along with graphical representations to check the physical\nvalidity as well as acceptability of it within specified observational\nconstraint in connection to a dozen of the compact star candidates. It is shown\nfrom the presented model that these objects are nothing but radiating compact\nstars.\n", "  The physics of the crossover between weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) and strong-coupling Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) limits gives a unified\nframework of quantum bound (superfluid) states of interacting fermions. This\ncrossover has been studied in the ultracold atomic systems, but is extremely\ndifficult to be realized for electrons in solids. Recently, the superconducting\nsemimetal FeSe with a transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}=8.5$ K has been found\nto be deep inside the BCS-BEC crossover regime. Here we report experimental\nsignatures of preformed Cooper pairing in FeSe below $T^*\\sim20$ K, whose\nenergy scale is comparable to the Fermi energies. In stark contrast to usual\nsuperconductors, large nonlinear diamagnetism by far exceeding the standard\nGaussian superconducting fluctuations is observed below $T^*\\sim20$ K,\nproviding thermodynamic evidence for prevailing phase fluctuations of\nsuperconductivity. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transport data give\nevidence of pseudogap formation at $\\sim T^*$. The multiband superconductivity\nalong with electron-hole compensation in FeSe may highlight a novel aspect of\nthe BCS-BEC crossover physics.\n", "  We study the cosmology of a recent model of supersymmetry breaking, in the\npresence of a tuneable positive cosmological constant, based on a gauged shift\nsymmetry of a string modulus that can be identified with the string dilaton.\nThe minimal spectrum of the `hidden' supersymmetry breaking sector consists\nthen of a vector multiplet that gauges the shift symmetry of the dilaton\nmultiplet and when coupled to the MSSM leads to a distinct low energy\nphenomenology depending on one parameter. Here we study the question if this\nmodel can also lead to inflation by identifying the dilaton with the inflaton.\nWe find that this is possible if the K\\\"ahler potential is modified by a term\nthat has the form of NS5-brane instantons, leading to an appropriate\ninflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential, depending on\ntwo extra parameters. This model is consistent with present cosmological\nobservations without modifying the low energy particle phenomenology associated\nto the minimum of the scalar potential.\n", "  We demonstrate Yokoyama gaugeon formalism for the Abelian one-form gauge\n(Maxwell) as well as for Abelian two-form gauge theory in the very special\nrelativity (VSR) framework. In VSR scenario, the extended action due to\nintroduction of gaugeon fields also possesses form invariance under quantum\ngauge transformations. It is observed that the gaugeon field together with\ngauge field naturally acquire mass, which is different from the conventional\nHiggs mechanism. The quantum gauge transformation implements a shift in gauge\nparameter. Further, we analyse the BRST symmetric gaugeon formalism in VSR\nwhich embeds only one subsidiary condition rather than two.\n", "  Evolution of highly excited quantum field is considered in the framework of\nKeldysh formalism . It is demonstrated that leading order (LO) term of\nsemiclassical approximation appears as well-known Classical Statistical\nApproximation (CSA). In simple case of spatially homogeneous scalar field\nanalytical expressions for leading and next-to-leading (NLO) order are\npresented. It is shown that the range of applicability of CSA strongly depends\non the properties of the initial state of the system\n", "  The wave kinetic equation (WKE) describing drift-wave (DW) turbulence is\nwidely used in studies of zonal flows (ZFs) emerging from DW turbulence.\nHowever, this formulation neglects the exchange of enstrophy between DWs and\nZFs and also ignores effects beyond the geometrical-optics limit. We derive a\nmodified theory that takes both of these effects into account, while still\ntreating DW quanta (\"driftons\") as particles in phase space. The drifton\ndynamics is described by an equation of the Wigner-Moyal type, which is\ncommonly known in the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics. In the\ngeometrical-optics limit, this formulation features additional terms missing in\nthe traditional WKE that ensure exact conservation of the total enstrophy of\nthe system, in addition to the total energy, which is the only conserved\ninvariant in previous theories based on the WKE. Numerical simulations are\npresented to illustrate the importance of these additional terms. The proposed\nformulation can be considered as a phase-space representation of the\nsecond-order cumulant expansion, or CE2.\n", "  We present a measurement of the inclusive production of Upsilon mesons in U+U\ncollisions at 193 GeV at mid-rapidity (|y| < 1). Previous studies in central\nAu+Au collisions at 200 GeV show a suppression of Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) production\nrelative to expectations from the Upsilon yield in p+p collisions scaled by the\nnumber of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll), with an indication that\nthe Upsilon(1S) state is also suppressed. The present measurement extends the\nnumber of participant nucleons in the collision (Npart) by 20% compared to\nAu+Au collisions, and allows us to study a system with higher energy density.\nWe observe a suppression in both the Upsilon(1S+2S+3S) and Upsilon(1S) yields\nin central U+U data, which consolidates and extends the previously observed\nsuppression trend in Au+Au collisions.\n", "  We revisit the Ising-nematic quantum critical point with an $m$-dimensional\nFermi surface by applying a dimensional regularization scheme, introduced in\nPhys. Rev. B 92, 035141 (2015). We compute the contribution from two-loop and\nthree-loop diagrams in the intermediate energy range controlled by a crossover\nscale. We find that for $m=2 $, the corrections continue to be one-loop exact\nfor both the infrared and intermediate energy regimes.\n", "  We study light, thermal neutralino dark matter in the sub-GeV to 65 GeV mass\nrange in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). We\nconsider realizations of the limit of alignment without decoupling in the Higgs\nsector where the heavier CP-even Higgs impersonates the observed Higgs state at\n125 GeV, while the lighter CP-even Higgs is the mediator of dark matter\nannihilation. We single out three distinct and novel possibilities for light\ndark matter: (i) a neutralino with mass around half the light Higgs mass, in\nthe sub-GeV to 30 GeV mass range; (ii) a neutralino with a mass around half the\npseudoscalar Higgs boson mass, in our examples around 60 to 65 GeV; (iii) a\nvery light neutralino with mass around the light Higgs mass, pair-annihilating\nto Higgs pairs. We discuss the implications of all these possibilities for\nindirect and direct dark matter detection experiments, and we demonstrate that\nall scenarios will be tested by next generation direct detection experiments.\nWe also emphasize that the unique Higgs phenomenology of these scenarios\nwarrants a dedicated search program at the LHC.\n", "  Analytic expressions are presented for the dark current-voltage relation\n$J(V)$ of a $pn^+$ junction with positively charged columnar grain boundaries\nwith high defect density. These expressions apply to non-depleted grains with\nsufficiently high bulk hole mobilities. The accuracy of the formulas is\nverified by direct comparison to numerical simulations. Numerical simulations\nfurther show that the dark $J(V)$ can be used to determine the open circuit\npotential $V_{\\rm oc}$ of an illuminated junction for a given short-circuit\ncurrent density $J_{\\rm sc}$ . A precise relation between the grain boundary\nproperties and $V_{\\rm oc}$ is provided, advancing the understanding of the\ninfluence of grain boundaries on the efficiency of thin film polycrystalline\nphotovoltaics like CdTe and $\\mathrm{Cu(In,Ga)Se_2}$.\n", "  We investigate two coupled nonlinear cavities that are coherently driven in a\ndissipative environment. We perform semiclassical, numerical and analytical\nquantum studies of this dimer model when both cavities are symmetrically\ndriven. In the semiclassical analysis, we find steady-state solutions with\ndifferent photon occupations in two cavities. Such states can be considered\nanalogs of the closed system double well symmetry breaking states. We analyze\nthe occurrence and properties of these localized states in the system parameter\nspace and examine how the symmetry breaking states, in form of a bistable pair,\nare associated to the single cavity bistable behavior. In a full quantum\ncalculation of the master equation dynamics that includes quantum fluctuations,\nthe symmetry breaking states and bistability disappear due to the quantum\nfluctuations. In quantum trajectory picture, we observe enhanced quantum jumps\nand switching which indicate the presence of the underlying semiclassical\nsymmetry breaking states. Finally, we present a set of analytical solutions for\nthe steady state correlation functions using the complex P-representation and\ndiscuss its regime of validity.\n", "  We introduce a model for hydrogen induced blister formation in nanometer\nthick thin films. The model assumes that molecular hydrogen gets trapped under\na circular blister cap causing it to deflect elastically outward until a stable\nblister is formed. In the first part, the energy balance required for a stable\nblister is calculated. From this model, the adhesion energy of the blister cap,\nthe internal pressure and the critical H-dose for blister formation can be\ncalculated. In the second part, the flux balance required for a blister to grow\nto a stable size is calculated. The model is applied to blisters formed in a\nMo/Si multilayer after being exposed to hydrogen ions. From the model the\nadhesion energy of the Mo/Si blister cap was calculated to be around 1.05 J/m2\nwith internal pressures in the range of 175-280 MPa. Based on the model a\nminimum ion dose for the onset of blister formation was calculated to be d =\n4.2*10^18 ions/cm2. From the flux balance equations the diffusion constant for\nthe Mo/Si blister cap was estimated to be D_H2 = (10+-1) *10^18 cm2/s.\n", "  We consider $\\phi^3$ theory in $6-2\\epsilon$ with $F_4$ global symmetry. The\nbeta function is calculated up to 3 loops, and a stable unitary IR fixed point\nis observed. The anomalous dimensions of operators quadratic or cubic in $\\phi$\nare also computed. We then employ conformal bootstrap technique to study the\nfixed point predicted from the perturbative approach. For each putative scaling\ndimension of $\\phi$ ($\\Delta_{\\phi})$, we obtain the corresponding upper bound\non the scaling dimension of the second lowest scalar primary in the ${\\mathbf\n26}$ representation $(\\Delta^{\\rm 2nd}_{{\\mathbf 26}})$ which appears in the\nOPE of $\\phi\\times\\phi$. In $D=5.95$, we observe a sharp peak on the upper\nbound curve located at $\\Delta_{\\phi}$ equal to the value predicted by the\n3-loop computation. In $D=5$, we observe a weak kink on the upper bound curve\nat $(\\Delta_{\\phi},\\Delta^{\\rm 2nd}_{{\\mathbf 26}})$=$(1.6,4)$.\n", "  Direct searches for dark matter (DM) by the LUX and PandaX-II Collaborations\nemploying xenon-based detectors have recently come up with the most stringent\nlimits to date on the spin-independent elastic scattering of DM off nucleons.\nFor Higgs-portal scalar DM models, the new results have precluded any\npossibility of accommodating low-mass DM as suggested by the DAMA and CDMS II\nSi experiments utilizing other target materials, even after invoking\nisospin-violating DM interactions with nucleons. In the simplest model, SM+D,\nwhich is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar named darkon acting as\nthe DM candidate, the LUX and PandaX-II limits rule out DM masses roughly from\n4 to 450 GeV, except a small range around the resonance point at half of the\nHiggs mass where the interaction cross-section is near the neutrino-background\nfloor. In the THDM II+D, which is the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model combined\nwith a darkon, the region excluded in the SM+D by the direct searches can be\nrecovered due to suppression of the DM effective interactions with nucleons at\nsome values of the ratios of Higgs couplings to the up and down quarks, making\nthe interactions significantly isospin-violating. However, in either model, if\nthe 125-GeV Higgs boson is the portal between the dark and SM sectors, DM\nmasses less than 50 GeV or so are already ruled out by the LHC constraint on\nthe Higgs invisible decay. In the THDM II+D, if the heavier $CP$-even Higgs\nboson is the portal, theoretical restrictions from perturbativity, vacuum\nstability, and unitarity requirements turn out to be important instead and\nexclude much of the region below 100 GeV. For larger DM masses, the THDM II+D\nhas plentiful parameter space that corresponds to interaction cross-sections\nunder the neutrino-background floor and therefore is likely to be beyond the\nreach of future direct searches without directional sensitivity.\n", "  We study a system of $N$ non-interacting spin-less fermions trapped in a\nconfining potential, in arbitrary dimensions $d$ and arbitrary temperature $T$.\nThe presence of the trap introduces an edge where the average density of\nfermions vanishes. Far from the edge, near the center of the trap (the so\ncalled \"bulk regime\"), physical properties of the fermions have traditionally\nbeen understood using the Local Density Approximation. However, this\napproximation drastically fails near the edge where the density vanishes. In\nthis paper we show that, even near the edge, novel universal properties emerge,\nindependently of the details of the confining potential. We show that for large\n$N$, these fermions in a confining trap, in arbitrary dimensions and at finite\ntemperature, form a determinantal point process. As a result, any $n$-point\ncorrelation function can be expressed as an $n \\times n$ determinant whose\nentry is called the kernel. Near the edge, we derive the large $N$ scaling form\nof the kernels. In $d=1$ and $T=0$, this reduces to the so called Airy kernel,\nthat appears in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrix theory. In\n$d=1$ and $T>0$ we show a remarkable connection between our kernel and the one\nappearing in the $1+1$-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation at finite time.\nConsequently our result provides a finite $T$ generalization of the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution, that describes the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion at\n$T=0$. In $d>1$ and $T \\geq 0$, while the connection to GUE no longer holds,\nthe process is still determinantal whose analysis provides a new class of\nkernels, generalizing the $1d$ Airy kernel at $T=0$ obtained in random matrix\ntheory. Some of our finite temperature results should be testable in\npresent-day cold atom experiments, most notably our detailed predictions for\nthe temperature dependence of the fluctuations near the edge.\n", "  In the present paper, the primal-dual problem consisting of the investment\nrisk minimization problem and the expected return maximization problem in the\nmean-variance model is discussed using replica analysis. As a natural extension\nof the investment risk minimization problem under only a budget constraint that\nwe analyzed in a previous study, we herein consider a primal-dual problem in\nwhich the investment risk minimization problem with budget and expected return\nconstraints is regarded as the primal problem, and the expected return\nmaximization problem with budget and investment risk constraints is regarded as\nthe dual problem. With respect to these optimal problems, we analyze a quenched\ndisordered system involving both of these optimization problems using the\napproach developed in statistical mechanical informatics, and confirm that both\noptimal portfolios can possess the primal-dual structure. Finally, the results\nof numerical simulations are shown to validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n", "  We study nonlinear magneto-optical responses of metals by a semiclassical\nBoltzmann equation approach. We derive general formulas for linear and second\norder nonlinear optical effects in the presence of magnetic fields that include\nboth Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Applied to Weyl fermions, the\nsemiclassical approach (i) captures the directional anisotropy of linear\nconductivity under magnetic field as a consequence of an anisotropic $B^2$\ncontribution, which may explain the low-field regime of recent experiments;\n(ii) predicts strong second harmonic generation proportional to $B$ that is\nenhanced as the Fermi energy approaches the Weyl point, leading to large\nnonlinear Kerr rotation. Moreover, we show that the semiclassical formula for\nthe circular photogalvanic effect arising from the Berry curvature dipole is\nreproduced by a full quantum calculation using a Floquet approach.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the embedding cell method, an algorithm which has\nbeen developed for the numerical homogenization of metal-ceramic composite\nmaterials. We show the convergence of the iteration scheme of this algorithm\nand the coincidence of the material properties predicted by the limit with the\neffective material properties provided by the analytical homogenization theory\nin three situations, namely for a one dimensional linear elasticity model, a\nsimple one dimensional plasticity model and a two dimensional model of linear\nhyperelastic isotropic materials with constant shear modulus and slightly\nvarying first Lam\\'e parameter.\n", "  A ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate supports polar-core spin vortices (PCVs) in\nthe easy-plane phase. We derive a model for the dynamics of these PCVs using a\nvariational Lagrangian approach. The PCVs behave as massive charged particles\ninteracting under the two dimensional Coulomb interaction, with the mass\narising from interaction effects within the vortex core. We compare this model\nto numerical simulations of the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii equations and find\nsemi-quantitative agreement. In addition, the numerical results suggest that\nthe PCV core couples to spin waves, and this affects the PCV dynamics even far\nfrom the core. We identify areas of further research that could extend the\nmodel of PCV dynamics presented here.\n", "  Circumplanetary disks (CPDs) control the growth of planets, supply material\nfor satellites to form, and provide observational signatures of young forming\nplanets. We have carried out two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with\nradiative cooling to study CPDs, and suggested a new mechanism to drive the\ndisk accretion. Two spiral shocks are present in CPDs, excited by the central\nstar. We find that spiral shocks can at least contribute to, if not dominate\nthe angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in CPDs. Meanwhile,\ndissipation and heating by spiral shocks have a positive feedback on\nshock-driven accretion itself. As the disk is heated up by spiral shocks, the\nshocks become more open, leading to more efficient angular momentum transport.\nThis shock driven accretion is, on the other hand, unsteady on a timescale of\nmonths/years due to production and destruction of vortices in disks. After\nbeing averaged over time, a quasi-steady accretion is reached from the planet's\nHill radius all the way to the planet surface, and the disk\n$\\alpha$-coefficient characterizing angular momentum transport due to spiral\nshocks is $\\sim$0.001-0.02. The disk surface density ranges from 10 to 1000 g\ncm$^{-2}$ in our simulations, which is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the \"minimum mass sub-nebula\" model used to study satellite formation;\ninstead it is more consistent with the \"gas-starved\" satellite formation model.\nFinally, we calculate the millimeter flux emitted by CPDs at ALMA and EVLA\nwavelength bands and predict the flux for several recently discovered CPD\ncandidates, which suggests that ALMA is capable of discovering these accreting\nCPDs.\n", "  The R^{2}-gravity contribution to energy loss of a hot plasma due to the\ngravitational bremsstrahlung is calculated in the linearized theory on the\nbasis of classical Coulomb scattering of plasma constituents in small-angle\nscattering approximation. The explicit dependence of the gravitational\nluminosity on the plasma temperature is derived and its relevance to the\nEinstein gravity is demonstrated. The result when applied to the Sun as a hot\nplasma, shows very good agreement with available data.\n", "  The MuPix7 chip is a monolithic HV-CMOS pixel chip, thinned down to 50 \\mu m.\nIt provides continuous self-triggered, non-shuttered readout at rates up to 30\nMhits/chip of 3x3 mm^2 active area and a pixel size of 103x80 \\mu m^2. The hit\nefficiency depends on the chosen working point. Settings with a power\nconsumption of 300 mW/cm^2 allow for a hit efficiency >99.5%. A time resolution\nof 14.2 ns (Gaussian sigma) is achieved. Latest results from 2016 test beam\ncampaigns are shown.\n", "  Building upon the one-step replica symmetry breaking formalism, duly\nunderstood and ramified, we show that the sequence of ordered extreme values of\na general class of Euclidean-space logarithmically correlated random energy\nmodels (logREMs) behave in the thermodynamic limit as a randomly shifted\ndecorated exponential Poisson point process. The distribution of the random\nshift is determined solely by the large-distance (\"infra-red\", IR) limit of the\nmodel, and is equal to the free energy distribution at the critical temperature\nup to a translation. the decoration process is determined solely by the\nsmall-distance (\"ultraviolet\", UV) limit, in terms of the biased minimal\nprocess. Our approach provides connections of the replica framework to results\nin the probability literature and sheds further light on the freezing/duality\nconjecture which was the source of many previous results for log-REMs. In this\nway we derive the general and explicit formulae for the joint probability\ndensity of depths of the first and second minima (as well its higher-order\ngeneralizations) in terms of model-specific contributions from UV as well as IR\nlimits. In particular, we show that the second min statistics is largely\nindependent of details of UV data, whose influence is seen only through the\nmean value of the gap. For a given log-correlated field this parameter can be\nevaluated numerically, and we provide several numerical tests of our theory\nusing the circular model of $1/f$-noise.\n", "  Electromagnetic simulations of complex geologic settings are computationally\nexpensive. One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to\naccurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting.\nThis conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these\nvariations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine\nmesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a\nlarge system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the\nsimulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the\ndiscretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the\nfine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in\nthe predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a\ncoarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh\nmodel. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a\nparameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a\ncoarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to\nthe survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce\nthe predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale\narbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning\nof the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the\nproposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the\nfine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the\ndesired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation\nprocess.\n", "  We analyze the real-time dynamics of a quantum two-state system in the\npresence of nonequilibrium quantum fluctuations. The latter are generated by a\ncoupling of the two-state system to a single electronic level of a quantum dot\nwhich carries a nonequilibrium tunneling current. We restrict to the sequential\ntunneling regime and calculate the dynamics of the two-state system, of the dot\npopulation, and of the nonequilibrium charge current on the basis of a\ndiagrammatic perturbative method valid for a weak tunneling coupling. We find a\nnontrivial dependence of the relaxation and dephasing rates of the two-state\nsystem due to the nonequilibrium fluctuations which is directly linked to the\nstructure of the unperturbed central system. In addition, a\nHeisenberg-Langevin-equation of motion allows us to calculate the correlation\nfunction of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. By this, we obtain a generalized\nnonequilibrium fluctuation relation which includes the equilibrium\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem. A straightforward extension to the case with a\ntime-periodic ac voltage is shown.\n", "  It has been shown that a self-gravitating system of massive keV fermions in\nthermodynamic equilibrium correctly describes the dark matter (DM) distribution\nin galactic halos and predicts a denser quantum core towards the center of the\nconfiguration. Such a quantum core, for a fermion mass in the range of $50$ keV\n$\\lesssim m c^2 \\lesssim 345$ keV, can be an alternative interpretation of the\ncentral compact object in Sgr A*. We present in this work the gravitational\nlensing properties of this novel DM model in Milky Way-like spiral galaxies. We\ndescribe the lensing effects of the pure DM component both on halo scales,\nwhere we compare them to the effects of the Navarro-Frenk-White and the\nNon-Singular Isothermal Sphere DM models, and near the galaxy center, where we\ncompare them with the effects of a Schwarzschild BH. For the particle mass\nleading to the most compact DM core, $m c^2\\approx 10^{2}$ keV, we draw the\nfollowing conclusions. At distances $r\\gtrsim 20$ pc from the center of the\nlens the effect of the central object on the lensing properties is negligible.\nHowever, we show that measurements of the deflection angle produced by the DM\ndistribution in the outer region at a few kpc, together with rotation curve\ndata, could help to discriminate between different DM models. We show that at\ndistances $\\sim 10^{-4}$ pc strong lensing effects, such as multiple images and\nEinstein rings, may occur. Large differences in the deflection angle produced\nby a DM central core and a central BH appear at distances $r\\lesssim 10^{-6}$\npc; in this regime the weak-field formalism is no longer applicable and the\nexact general-relativistic formula has to be used. We find that quantum DM\ncores do not show a photon sphere what implies that they do not cast a shadow.\nSimilar conclusions apply to the other DM distributions for other fermion\nmasses in the above specified range and for other galaxy types.\n", "  In this paper, we present a continuum model to compute the energy of low\nangle grain boundaries for any given degrees of freedom (arbitrary rotation\naxis, rotation angle and boundary plane orientation) based on a continuum\ndislocation structure. In our continuum model, we minimize the grain boundary\nenergy associated with the dislocation structure subject to the constraint of\nFrank's formula for dislocations with all possible Burgers vectors. This\nconstrained minimization problem is solved by the penalty method by which it is\nturned into an unconstrained minimization problem. The grain boundary\ndislocation structure is approximated by a network of straight dislocations\nthat predicts the energy and dislocation densities of the grain boundaries. The\ngrain boundary energy based on the calculated dislocation structure is able to\nincorporate its anisotropic nature. We use our continuum model to\nsystematically study the energy of $<111>$ low angle grain boundaries in fcc Al\nwith any boundary plane orientation and all six possible Burgers vectors.\nComparisons with results of the atomistic simulations show that our continuum\nmodel is able to give excellent predictions of the energy and dislocation\ndensities of low angle grain boundaries. We also study the energy of low angle\ngrain boundaries in fcc Al with varying rotation axis while the rest degrees of\nfreedom are fixed. With minor modifications, our model can also apply to\ndislocation structures and energy of heterogeneous interfaces.\n", "  The Bures geometry of quantum statistical thermodynamics at thermal\nequilibrium is investigated by introducing the connections between the Bures\nangle and the Renyi $1/2$-divergence. Fundamental relations concerning free\nenergy, moments of work and distance are established.\n", "  Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of flexible cables are an example of\nflow-induced vibrations that can act as energy harvesting systems by converting\nenergy associated with the spontaneous cable motion into electricity. This work\ninvestigates the optimal positioning of the harvesting devices along the cable,\nusing numerical simulations with a wake oscillator model to describe the\nunsteady flow forcing. Using classical gradient-based optimization, the optimal\nharvesting strategy is determined for the generic configuration of a flexible\ncable fixed at both ends, including the effect of flow forces and gravity on\nthe cable's geometry. The optimal strategy is found to consist systematically\nin a concentration of the harvesting devices at one of the cable's ends,\nrelying on deformation waves along the cable to carry the energy toward this\nharvesting site. Furthermore, we show that the performance of systems based on\nVIV of flexible cables is significantly more robust to flow velocity\nvariations, in comparison with a rigid cylinder device. This results from two\npassive control mechanisms inherent to the cable geometry : (i) the\nadaptability to the flow velocity of the fundamental frequencies of cables\nthrough the flow-induced tension and (ii) the selection of successive vibration\nmodes by the flow velocity for cables with gravity-induced tension.\n", "  We consider the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations for a spherically\nsymmetric scalar field scattering off a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole in\nasymptotically flat spacetime. The equations are solved numerically using a\nhyperboloidal evolution scheme. For suitable frequencies of the initial data,\nsuperradiance is observed, leading to a substantial decrease of mass and charge\nof the black hole. We also derive a Bondi mass loss formula using the Kodama\nvector field and investigate the late-time decay of the scalar field.\n", "  Electrochromic materials change color reversibly by applying an external DC\nvoltage. One among the many emerging application of electro-chromics is the\nsmart windows. The coloration efficiency, the optical colour modulation and the\ncyclability are the factors that bench mark the device. Tungsten oxide (WO3-x)\nis versatile material and reactive DC magnetron sputtering (with argon as\nsputter gas) technique is common for electro-chromics. In the present\ncommunication we have prepared tungsten oxide thin films by reactive DC\nmagnetron sputtering technique (at room temperature 300 K) using Neon as the\nsputter gas. The thickness of the WO3 thin films are varied from 190 nm to 712\nnm. These WO3 thin films are subjected for electrochemical measurements with\nthree electrode electrochemical cell in presence of 1M HCl, 1M Li2SO4 aqueous\nelectrolyte and we have prepared a solid state electrochromic device with\nnafion thin film. The highest coloration efficiency of the neon sputtered WO3\nis observed as 187.9 cm2/C by lithium intercalation.\n", "  The accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the most profound\ndiscoveries in modern cosmology, pointing to a universe in which 70% of the\nmass-energy density has an unknown form spread uniformly across the universe.\nThis result has been well established using a combination of cosmological\nprobes (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), resulting in a \"standard\nmodel\" of modern cosmology that is a combination of a cosmological constant\nwith cold dark matter and baryons. The first compelling evidence for the\nacceleration came in the late 1990's, when two independent teams studying type\nIa supernovae discovered that distant SNe Ia were dimmer than expected. The\ncombined analysis of modern cosmology experiments, including SNe Ia, the Hubble\nconstant, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background has\nnow measured the contributions of matter and the cosmological constant to the\nenergy density of the universe to better than 0.01, providing a secure\nmeasurement of acceleration. A recent study (Tr{\\o}st Nielsen et al. 2015) has\nclaimed that the evidence for acceleration from SNe Ia is \"marginal.\" Here we\ndemonstrate errors in that analysis which reduce the acceleration significance\nfrom SNe Ia, and further demonstrate that conservative constraints on the\ncurvature or matter density of the universe increase the significance even\nmore. Analyzing the Joint Light-curve Analysis supernova sample, we find\n4.2{\\sigma} evidence for acceleration with SNe Ia alone, and 11.2{\\sigma} in a\nflat universe. With our improved supernova analysis and by not rejecting all\nother cosmological constraints, we find that acceleration is quite secure.\n", "  Axisymmetric current-carrying plasmoids are formed in the presence of\nnonaxisymmetric fluctuations during nonlinear three-dimensional resistive MHD\nsimulations in a global toroidal geometry. We utilize the helicity injection\ntechnique to form an initial poloidal flux in the presence of a toroidal guide\nfield. As helicity is injected, two types of current sheets are formed from 1)\nthe oppositely directed field lines in the injector region (primary\nreconnecting current sheet), and 2) the poloidal flux compression near the\nplasma edge (edge current sheet). We first find that nonaxisymmetic\nfluctuations arising from the current-sheet instability isolated near the\nplasma edge have tearing parity but can nevertheless grow fast (on the poloidal\nAlfven time scale). These modes saturate by breaking up the current sheet.\nSecond, for the first time a dynamo poloidal flux amplification is observed at\nthe reconnetion site (in the region of the oppositely directed magnetic field).\nThis fluctuation-induced flux amplification increases the local Lundquist\nnumber, which then triggers a plasmoid instability and breaks the primary\ncurrent sheet at the reconnection site. The plasmoids formation driven by\nlarge-scale flux amplification, i.e. a large-scale dynamo, observed here has\nstrong implications for astrophysical reconnection as well as fast reconnection\nevents in laboratory plasmas.\n", "  The composition of Dark Matter (DM) remains an important open question. The\ncurrent data do not distinguish between single- and multi-component DM, while\nin theory constructions it is often assumed that DM is composed of a single\nfield. In this work, we study a hidden sector which naturally entails\nmulticomponent DM consisting of spin-1 and spin-0 states. This UV complete\nset-up is based on SU(3) hidden gauge symmetry with the minimal scalar field\ncontent to break it spontaneously. The presence of multiple DM components is a\nresult of a residual Z_2 x Z'_2 symmetry which is part of an unbroken global\nU(1) x Z'_2 inherent in the Yang-Mills systems. We find that the model exhibits\nvarious parametric regimes with drastically different DM detection prospects.\nIn particular, we find that the direct detection cross section is much\nsuppressed in large regions of parameter space as long as the Standard Model\nHiggs mixes predominantly with a single scalar from the hidden sector. The\nresulting scattering rate is often beyond the level of sensitivity of XENON1T,\nwhile still being consistent with the thermal WIMP paradigm.\n", "  We performed $^{17}$O nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on\nsuperconducting (SC) Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under in-plane magnetic fields. We found\nthat no new signal appears in the SC state and that the $^{17}$O Knight shifts\nobtained from the double-site measurements remain constant across the\nfirst-order phase-transition line, as well as across the second-order\nphase-transition line as already reported. The present results indicate that\nthe SC spin susceptibility does not decrease in the high-field region, although\na magnetization jump in the SC state was reported at low temperatures. Because\nthe spin susceptibility is unchanged in the SC state in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we\nsuggest that the first-order phase transition across the upper critical field\nshould be interpreted as a depairing mechanism other than the conventional\nPauli-paramagnetic effect.\n", "  Nonlinear time series analysis has been widely used to search for signatures\nof low-dimensional chaos in light curves emanating from astrophysical bodies. A\nparticularly popular example is the microquasar GRS 1915+105, whose irregular\nbut systematic X-ray variability has been well studied using data acquired by\nthe Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. With a view to building simpler models of\nX-ray variability, attempts have been made to classify the light curves of GRS\n1915+105 as chaotic or stochastic. Contrary to some of the earlier suggestions,\nafter careful analysis, we find no evidence for chaos or determinism in any of\nthe GRS 1915+105 classes. The dearth of long and stationary data sets\nrepresenting all the different variability classes of GRS 1915+105 makes it a\npoor candidate for analysis using nonlinear time series techniques. We conclude\nthat either very exhaustive data analysis with sufficiently long and stationary\nlight curves should be performed, keeping all the pitfalls of nonlinear time\nseries analysis in mind, or alternative schemes of classifying the light curves\nshould be adopted. The generic limitations of the techniques that we point out\nin the context of GRS 1915+105 affect all similar investigations of light\ncurves from other astrophysical sources.\n", "  We extensively study the rotational group structure inside the patch space by\nintroducing the fiber bundle structure. The rotational group structure leads to\na new image denoising algorithm called the \\textit{vector non-local Euclidean\nmedian} (VNLEM). The theoretical aspect of VNLEM is studied, which explains why\nthe VNLEM and traditional non-local mean/non-local Euclidean median (NLEM)\nalgorithm work. The numerical issue of the VNLEM is improved by taking the\norientation feature in the commonly applied scale-invariant feature transform\n(SIFT), and a theoretical analysis of the robustness of the orientation feature\nin the SIFT is provided. The VNLEM is applied to an image database of 1,361\nimages and compared with the NLEM. Different image quality assessments based on\nthe error-sensitivity or the human visual system are applied to evaluate the\nperformance. The results confirmed the potential of the VNLEM algorithm.\n", "  Principally, there are two forms of coupling energy when particle(photon) is\nmoving around the micro-ring resonator, which is generated by the construction\n(creation) and the destruction (annihilation) energies that can disturb the\ncentre nonlinear microring resonator and lead the system unstable from the\nharmonic motion, from which the squeezing state of the particle can occur. The\ndetected outputs either electrons and their spins or photons can be useful for\nthe new era of electronic devices and circuits, where the classical\nelectronics, plasmonic electronics, spintronic electronics and quantum\nelectronics can be combined and realized.\n", "  Phase-locking an array of quantum cascade lasers is an effective way to\nachieve higher output power and beam shaping. In this article, based on Talbot\neffect, we show a new-type phase-locked array of mid-infrared quantum cascade\nlasers with an integrated spatial- filtering Talbot cavity. All the arrays show\nstable in-phase operation from the threshold current to full power current. The\nbeam divergence of the array device is smaller than that of a single-ridge\nlaser. We use the multi-slit Fraunhofer diffraction mode to interpret the\nfar-field radiation profile and give a solution to get better beam quality. The\nmaximum power is just about 5 times that of a single-ridge laser for\neleven-laser array device and 3 times for seven-laser array device. Considering\nthe great modal selection ability, simple fabricating process and the potential\nfor achieving better beam quality and smaller cavity loss, this new-type\nphase-locked array may be a hopeful and elegant solution to get high power or\nbeam shaping.\n", "  A threshold condition for amplification without inversion in a free-electron\nlaser without inversion (FELWI) is determined. This condition is found to be\ntoo severe for the effect to be observed in an earlier suggested scheme because\na threshold intensity of the field to be amplified appears to be too high. This\nindicates that alternative schemes have to be found for making the creation of\nan FELWI realistic.\n", "  The nonlinear theory of relyativistic strophotron is developed. Classical\nequations of motion are averaged over fast oscillations. The slow motion phase\nand saturation parameter are found different from usual undulator oscillation\nparameters. In the strong field approximation the analytical expression of gain\nis found on higher harmonics of main resonance frequency.\n", "  We review our recent proposal to use certain spatial cross-sections of the\nboundary at infinity -- light-cone cuts -- to recover the conformal metric in\nthe bulk. We discuss some extensions of this work, including how to obtain the\nconformal metric near the horizon of a collapsing black hole. We also show how\nto obtain the conformal factor under certain conditions.\n", "  Crystallographic alignment between two-dimensional crystals in van der Waals\nheterostructures brought a number of profound physical phenomena, including\nobservation of Hofstadter butterfly and topological currents, and promising\nnovel applications, such as resonant tunnelling transistors. Here, by probing\nthe electronic density of states in graphene using graphene-hexagonal boron\nnitride tunnelling transistors, we demonstrate a structural transition of\nbilayer graphene from incommensurate twisted stacking state into a commensurate\nAB stacking due to a macroscopic graphene self-rotation. This structural\ntransition is accompanied by a topological transition in the reciprocal space\nand by pseudospin texturing. The stacking transition is driven by van der Waals\ninteraction energy of the two graphene layers and is thermally activated by\nunpinning the microscopic chemical adsorbents which are then removed by the\nself-cleaning of graphene.\n", "  The discovery of graphene makes it highly desirable to seek new\ntwo-dimensional materials. Through first-principles investigation, we predict\ntwo-dimensional materials of ReN$_{2}$: honeycomb and tetragonal structures.\nThe phonon spectra establish the dynamical stability for both of the two\nstructures, and the calculated in-plane stiffness constants proves their\nmechanical stability. The energy bands near the Fermi level consist of N-p and\nRe-d orbitals for the honeycomb structure, and are mainly from Re d orbitals\nfor the tetragonal structure. While the tetragonal structure is non-magnetic,\nthe honeycomb structure has N-based ferromagnetism, which will transit to\nanti-ferromagnetism under 14$\\%$ biaxial strain. The calculated electron\nlocalization function and spin density indicate that direct N-N bond can occur\nonly in the honeycomb structure. The ferromagnetism allows us to distinguish\nthe two 2D phases easily. The tetragonal phase has lower energy than the\nhoneycomb one, which means that the tetragonal phase is more stable, but the\nhexagonal phase has much larger bulk, shear, and Young's muduli than the\ntetragonal phase. The tetragonal phase is a three-bands metal, and the\nhexagonal phase is a ferromagnetic semi-metal. The special structural,\nelectronic, magnetic, and optical properties in the honeycomb and tetragonal\nstructures make them promising for novel applications.\n", "  A fractal approach to the long-short portfolio optimization is proposed. The\nalgorithmic system based on the composition of market-neutral spreads into a\nsingle entity was considered. The core of the optimization scheme is a fractal\nwalk model of returns, optimizing a risk aversion according to the investment\nhorizon. The covariance matrix of spread returns has been used for the\noptimization and modified according to the Hurst stability analysis.\nOut-of-sample performance data has been represented for the space of exchange\ntraded funds in five period time period of observation. The considered\nportfolio system has turned out to be statistically more stable than a passive\ninvestment into benchmark with higher risk adjusted cumulative return over the\nobserved period.\n", "  We propose a holographic description of cosmic preheating at strong coupling.\nIn this scenario the energy transfer between the inflaton and matter field is\nmimicked by a model of holographic superconductor. An exponential amplification\nof the matter field during preheating can be described by the quasi-normal\nmodes of a metastable \"black hole\" in the bulk spacetime with an expanding\nboundary. Our results reveal that the matter field can be produced continuously\nat strong coupling in contrast to the case of weak coupling with a\ndiscontinuous matter growth as inflaton oscillates. Furthermore, the\namplification of matter field has an enhanced dependence on the vacuum\nexpectation value of the inflaton at strong coupling. By virtue of the proposed\nmechanism, physics of the very early universe at an extremely high temperature\nright after inflation may become accessible.\n", "  In the holographic description of cosmic preheating proposed in an\naccompanied Letter [1], the energy transfer between the inflaton and matter\nfield at strong coupling is suggested to be mimicked by superfluid and normal\ncomponents of a superconductor on Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) boundary in\nan asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In this paper we investigated\ntwo aspects of the scenario of holographic preheating that are not included in\nthe accompanied work. Firstly, we study in detail the evolution of the\nquasi-normal modes (QNMs) surrounding a metastable hairy black hole. This\nanalysis can quantitatively describe the preheating process of the matter field\nthat is produced continuously in the case of strong coupling. Secondly, we\npresent a detailed analysis of the holographic renormalization for the AdS-FRW\nbackground, which allows us to extract operator expectation values for studying\ncosmological implications.\n", "  Aiming at improving the efficiency and accuracy of community detection in\ncomplex networks, we proposed a new algorithm, which is based on the idea that\ncommunities could be detected from subnetworks by comparing the internal and\nexternal cohesion of each subnetwork. In our method, similar nodes are firstly\ngathered into meta-communities, which are then decided to be retained or merged\nthrough a multilevel label propagation process, until all of them meet our\ncommunity criterion. Our algorithm requires neither any priori information of\ncommunities nor optimization of any objective function. Experimental results on\nboth synthetic and real-world networks show that, our algorithm performs quite\nwell and runs extremely fast, compared with several other popular algorithms.\nBy tuning a resolution parameter, we can also observe communities at different\nscales, so this could reveal the hierarchical structure of the network. To\nfurther explore the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the E-Coli\ntranscriptional regulatory network, and found that all the identified modules\nhave strong structural and functional coherence.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the nonlinear optical response of a heterodimer\ncomprising a semiconductor quantum dot strongly coupled to a metal\nnanoparticle. The quantum dot is considered as a three-level ladder system with\nground, one-exciton, and bi-exction states. As compared to the case of a\ntwo-level quantum dot model, adding the third (bi-exciton) state produces\nfascinating effects in the optical response of the hybrid system. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that the system may exhibit picosecond and sub-picosecond\nself-oscillations and quasi-chaotic behaviour under {\\it single}-frequency\ncontinuous wave excitation. An isolated semiconductor quantum dot does not show\nsuch features. The effects originate from competing one-exciton and bi-exciton\ntransitions in the semiconductor quantum dot, triggered by the self-action of\nthe quantum dot via the metal nanoparticle. The key parameter that governs the\nphenomena mentioned is the ratio of the self-action strength and the bi-exciton\nshift. The self-oscillation regime can be achieved in practice, in particular,\nin a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced ZnS/ZnSe core-shell quantum dot\nand a spherical silver nanoparticle. The results may have applications in\nnanodevices for generating trains of ultrashort optical pulses.\n", "  This is the documentation for generating random samples from the quantum\nstate space in accordance with a specified distribution, associated with this\nwebpage: http://tinyurl.com/QSampling . Ready-made samples (each with at least\na million points) from various distributions are available for download, or one\ncan generate one's own samples from a chosen distribution using the provided\nsource codes. The sampling relies on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm as\ndescribed in New J. Phys. 17, 043018 (2015). The random samples are reposited\nin the hope that they would be useful for a variety of tasks in quantum\ninformation and quantum computation. Constructing credible regions for\ntomographic data, optimizing a function over the quantum state space with a\ncomplicated landscape, testing the typicality of entanglement among states from\na multipartite quantum system, or computing the average of some quantity of\ninterest over a subset of quantum states are but some exemplary applications\namong many.\n", "  In our paper we investigate the lower limit of collisional energy of test\nparticles near the Kerr black hole. In particular we examine the minimal\nLorentz factor between the freely falling particles and the particles orbiting\naround a black hole. We consider collisions on the innermost stable circular\norbit (ISCO) and examine near--extreme case, where collisions take place near\nan event horizon. By fine--tuning the particles' angular momentum, the Lorentz\nfactor of the collision can always be minimized to a value dependent on the\nblack hole's spin. We identified that this minimal value is always less than\n$\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}-1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and more than $\\frac{\\sqrt{12}-1}{\\sqrt{6}}$\n(the limits are the values for an extreme Kerr and Schwarzschild,\nrespectively). It implies that this kind of collisions of compact objects are\nexpected to be highly energetic near supermassive black holes. In addition, we\nshow that an interaction between black hole's and particle's spins has an\ninfluence on minimal Lorentz factor. This contribution is nonnegligible for\nnear--extreme black holes. We also discuss the relation between our results and\nsci--fi movie Interstellar.\n", "  Nuclear level density (NLD) and radiative strength function (RSF) are\ndescribed simultaneously within a microscopic approach, which takes into\naccount the thermal effects of the exact pairing as well as the giant\nresonances within the phonon-damping model. The good agreement between the\nresults of calculations and experimental data extracted by the Oslo group for\n$^{170, 171, 172}$Yb isotopes shows the importance of exact thermal pairing in\nthe description of NLD at low and intermediate excitation energies and\ninvalidates the assumption based on the Brink-Axel hypothesis in the\ndescription of the RSF.\n", "  Observational constraints of relativistic jets from black holes has largely\ncome from the most powerful and extended jets\\cite{Jorstad05,Asada14}, leaving\nthe nature of the low luminosity jets a mystery\\cite{Falcke04}. M81* is one of\nthe nearest low-luminosity jets, which underwent an extremely large radio flare\nin 2011, allowing us to study compact core emission with unprecedented\nsensitivity and linear resolution. Utilizing a multi-wavelength campaign, we\nwere able to track the flare as it re-brightened and became optically thick.\nSimultaneous X-ray observations indicated the radio re-brightening was preceded\nby a low energy X-ray flare at least $t_{\\rm delay}>12\\ {\\rm days}$ prior.\nAssociating the time delay between the two bands as the cooling time in a\nsynchrotron flare\\cite{Urry97,Bai03}, we find the magnetic field strength was\n$1.9<B<9.2\\ {\\rm G}$, which is consistent with magnetic field estimate from\nspectral-energy distribution modeling\\cite{Kellerman81}, $B<10.2\\ {\\rm G}$. In\naddition, VLBA observations at 23 GHz clearly illustrate a discrete knot moving\nmildly relativistically at $v_{\\rm app}/c=0.51\\pm0.17$ associated with the\ninitial radio flare. The observations indicate radial jet motions for the first\ntime in M81*. This has profound implications for jet production, as it means\nradial motion can be observed in even the lowest-luminosity AGN, but at slower\nvelocities and smaller radial extents ($\\approx10^4\\ R_{\\rm G}$).\n", "  For the PIP-II Injector Test (PI-Test) at Fermilab, a four-vane radio\nfrequency quadrupole (RFQ) is designed to accelerate a 30-keV, 1-mA to 10-mA,\nH- beam to 2.1 MeV under both pulsed and continuous wave (CW) RF operation. The\navailable headroom of the RF amplifiers limits the maximum allowable detuning\nto 3 kHz, and the detuning is controlled entirely via thermal regulation. Fine\ncontrol over the detuning, minimal manual intervention, and fast trip recovery\nis desired. In addition, having active control over both the walls and vanes\nprovides a wider tuning range. For this, we intend to use model predictive\ncontrol (MPC). To facilitate these objectives, we developed a dedicated control\nframework that handles higher-level system decisions as well as executes\ncontrol calculations. It is written in Python in a modular fashion for easy\nadjustments, readability, and portability. Here we describe the framework and\npresent the first control results for the PI-Test RFQ under pulsed and CW\noperation.\n", "  Efficient phase cycling schemes remain a challenge for NMR techniques if the\npulse sequences involve a large number of rf-pulses. Especially complex is the\nCarr Purcell Meiboom Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence where the number of rf-pulses\ncan range from hundreds to several thousands. Our recent implementation of\nMagnetic Resonance Pore Imaging (MRPI) is based on a CPMG rf-pulse sequence in\norder to refocus the effect of internal gradients inherent in porous media.\nWhile the spin dynamics for spin-$1/2$ systems in CPMG like experiments are\nwell understood it is still not straight forward to separate the desired\npathway from the spectrum of unwanted coherence pathways. In this contribution\nwe apply Phase Incremented Echo Train Acquisition (PIETA) to MRPI. We show how\nPIETA offers a convenient way to implement a working phase cycling scheme and\nhow it allows one to gain deeper insights into the amplitudes of undesired\npathways.\n", "  At present, a variety of image-based diagnostics are used in particle\naccelerator systems. Often times, these are viewed by a human operator who then\nmakes appropriate adjustments to the machine. Given recent advances in using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, it should be\npossible to use image diagnostics directly in control routines (NN-based or\notherwise). This is especially appealing for non-intercepting diagnostics that\ncould run continuously during beam operation. Here, we show results of a first\nstep toward implementing such a controller: our trained CNN can predict\nmultiple simulated downstream beam parameters at the Fermilab Accelerator\nScience and Technology (FAST) facility's low energy beamline using simulated\nvirtual cathode laser images, gun phases, and solenoid strengths.\n", "  The Sloan Digitial Sky Surveys (SDSS) have been collecting imaging and\nspectoscopic data since 1998. These data as well as their derived data products\nare made publicly available through regular data releases, of which the 13th\ntook place summer 2016. Although public data releases can be challenging to\nmanage, they signficantly increase the impact of a survey, both scientifically\nand educationally.\n", "  An analytical linear solution of the fully compressible Euler equations is\nfound, in the particular case of a stationary two dimensional flow that passes\nover an orographic feature with small height-width ratio. A method based on the\ncovariant formulation of the Euler equations is used, and the analytical\nvertical velocity as well as the horizontal velocity, density and pressure, are\nobtained. The analytical solution is tested against a numerical model in three\ndifferent regimes, hydrostatic, non-hydrostatic and potential flow. The model\nused is a non-hydrostatic spectral semi-implicit model, with a height-based\nvertical coordinate. It is shown that there is a clear and consistent\nconvergence of the numerical solution towards the analytical solution, when the\nresolution increases. The method described is intended to be used as an\nidealized test for numerical weather models.\n", "  We study the tensor consistency relation in models of axion inflation with an\nSU(2) gauge field. In the tensor sector, we have two spin-2 modes, the standard\ngravity waves and the tensor perturbations of the SU(2) gauge field which\nsources the gravity waves at the linear level. Interestingly enough, we find\nthat the gravity waves are adiabatic and Maldacena's consistency relation\nincluding a long wavelength gravity wave holds in this setup. However, since it\nis partially polarized, there is a difference between the (n+1)-point functions\nwith different helicity states proportional to the ratio of the gauge field\ndensity to the total density. These chiral n-point functions are the imprints\nof the SU(2) gauge field on the primordial cosmological perturbations and a\nrobust observational feature of their contribution to the physics of inflation.\n", "  The first step in the calculation of semi-leptonic form factors in the decay\nof heavy mesons is the tuning of the hopping parameter $\\kappa$ for the charm\nand bottom quark masses. Results for the Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action are\npresented for one $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ ensemble generated by the MILC collaboration\nat $a\\approx 0.12\\,\\mathrm{fm}$ and $M_\\pi\\approx 310$ MeV. Estimates of\nhyperfine splitting of heavy-light and heavy-heavy mesons are presented and the\ninconsistency parameter is evaluated.\n", "  Graphene, as a promising material of post-silicon electronics, opens a new\nparadigm for the novel electronic properties and device applications. On the\nother hand, the 2D feature of graphene makes it technically challenging to be\nintegrated into 3D transistors with a sufficient processor capacity. Although\nthere are many attempts to assemble 2D graphene into 3D structures, the\ncharacteristics of massless Dirac fermions cannot be well preserved in these\nmaterials for transistor applications. Here we report a high-performance\ngraphene transistor by utilizing 3D nanoporous graphene which is comprised of\nan interconnected single graphene sheet and a commodious open porosity to\ninfuse an ionic liquid for a tunable electronic state by applying electric\nfields. The 3D nanoporous graphene transistor, with high carrier mobility of\n5000-7500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, exhibits two to three orders of magnitude\nhigher electric conductance and capacitance than those of 2D graphene devices,\nalong with preserved ambipolor electronic nature of Dirac cones. Moreover, the\n3D graphene networks with Dirac fermions turn out to exhibit a unique nonlinear\nHall resistance in a wide range of the gate voltages. The high quality 3D\nnanoporous graphene EDLT may open a new field for utilizing Dirac fermions in\n3D network structures for various fundamental and practical applications.\n", "  We consider three modes $A$, $B$ and $C$ and derive continuous variable\nmonogamy inequalities that constrain the distribution of bipartite entanglement\namongst the three modes. The inequalities hold for all such tripartite states,\nwithout the assumption of Gaussian states, and are based on measurements of two\nconjugate quadrature phase amplitudes $X_{i}$ and $P_{i}$ at each mode $i=A,B$.\nThe first monogamy inequality is $D_{BA}+D_{BC}\\geq1$ where $D_{BA}<1$ is the\nwidely used symmetric entanglement criterion, for which $D_{BA}$ is the sum of\nthe variances of $(X_{A}-X_{B})/2$ and $(P_{A}+P_{B})/2$. A second monogamy\ninequality is\n$Ent_{BA}Ent_{BC}\\geq\\frac{1}{\\left(1+(g_{BA}^{(sym)})^{2}\\right)\\left(1+(g_{BC}^{(sym)})^{2}\\right)}$\nwhere $Ent_{BA}<1$ is the EPR variance product criterion for entanglement. Here\n$Ent_{BA}$ is a normalised product of variances of $X_{B}-g_{BA}^{(sym)}X_{A}$\nand $P_{B}+g_{BA}^{(sym)}P_{A}$, and $g_{BA}^{(sym)}$ is a parameter that gives\na measure of the symmetry between the moments of $A$ and $B$. We also show that\nthe monogamy bounds are increased if a standard steering criterion for the\nsteering of $B$ is not satisfied. We illustrate the monogamy for continuous\nvariable tripartite entangled states including the effects of losses and noise,\nand identify regimes of saturation of the inequalities. The monogamy relations\nexplain the experimentally observed saturation at $D_{AB}=0.5$ for the\nentanglement between $A$ and $B$ when both modes have 50\\% losses, and may be\nuseful to establish rigorous bounds of correlation for the purpose of quantum\nkey distribution protocols.\n", "  We propose a minimal model aiming to describe heat transfer between particles\n(i.e. grains) and gases in a model of flighted rotary kilns. It considers a\nchannel in which a convective gas interacts with a granular suspension and a\ngranular bed. Despite its simplicity it captures the main experimental findings\nin the case of dilute suspension of heavy grains typical of what can be\nobserved in many industrial rotary kilns. Energy balance between each phase\ntakes into account the main heat transfer mechanisms between the transverse\ngranular motion and the convective gas. In the absence of radiation heat\ntransfer, the model predicts exponential variations of the temperatures\ncharacterized by a length which depends on the granular and gas heat flow rates\nas well as on the exchange areas. When radiation is taken into account, the\nmodel can be solved numerically. For this case, the temperature variations can\nbe fitted by stretched exponentials whose parameters are found to be\nindependent of the studied phases. Finally, an efficiency criterion is proposed\nto optimize the length of the system.\n", "  Hydrophilic and LCST polymer chains, poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) and\npoly(Nisopropylacrylamide)(PNIPA), were combined in semi-interpenetrated\narchitectures toinvestigate their responsive properties in swollen isochoric\nconditions comparatively tografted network structures. Using equal weight\nfractions of PDMA and PNIPA, semi-IPNdesigned with opposite topologies have\ndemonstrated a thermoresponsive behavior with verydifferent\nstructure/properties relationships as investigated by calorimetry,\nswellingexperiments, tensile tests and 2D neutron scattering at rest and under\ndeformation. In the caseof the PDMA network interpenetrated by linear PNIPA\nchains, the phase transition of PNIPAgives rise to the formation of large\nmicrodomains, loosely percolating the PDMA network.Above the transition, the\nenhancement of the mechanical properties remains low in terms ofelastic modulus\nand fracture energy. Conversely, the opposite topology, with PDMA\nchainsinterpenetrating the crosslinked PNIPA network, brings a large\nimprovement of themechanical properties at high temperature with a 10-fold\nincrease of the modulus and veryhigh fracture energy. By comparison with\ngrafted hydrogels of similar composition anddifferent topologies, the impact of\nthe primary structure over the phase-separated morphologyand the resulting\nmechanical properties was clearly highlighted.\n", "  \\'Eliashberg theory generalized to the case of the electron-phonon (EP)\nsystems with the not constant density of electronic states, as well as to the\ncase of the frequency dependent renormalization of both the electron mass and\nthe chemical potential, is used to study hydrogen sulphide phase under\npressure. The frequency and the temperature dependences of the electron mass\nrenormalization ReZ , the density of electronic states , renormalized by the EP\ninteraction , the spectral function of the electron-phonon interaction,\nobtained by calculation are used to calculate the electronic abnormal GF. The\ngeneralized \\'Eliashberg equations with the variable density of electronic\nstates are resolved for the hydrogen sulphide phase under pressure. The\ndependence of both the real and the imaginary part of the order parameter on\nthe frequency in the phase is obtained. The results of the solution of the\nEliashberg equations for the Im-3m (170 GPa), Im-3m (200 GPa), Im-3m (225 GPa)\nand R3m (120 GPa) hydrogen sulphide phases are presented. The value in the\nhydrogen sulfide phase at the pressure P = 225 GPa has been defined. The value\nfor the hydrogen sulfide phase at the pressure P = 170 GPa has been predicted.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the electrical transport properties of a\nrecently discovered iron-based superconductor:\nSm$_4$Fe$_2$As$_2$Te$_{0.72}$O$_{2.8}$F$_{1.2}$. We followed the temperature\ndependence of the upper critical field by resistivity measurement of single\ncrystals in magnetic fields up to 16 T, oriented along the two main\ncrystallographic directions. This material exhibits a zero-temperature upper\ncritical field of 90 T and 65 T parallel and perpendicular to the Fe$_2$As$_2$\nplanes, respectively. An unprecedented superconducting magnetic anisotropy\n$\\gamma_H=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^c \\sim 14$ is observed near Tc, and it decreases\nat lower temperatures as expected in multiband superconductors. Direct\nmeasurement of the electronic anisotropy was performed on microfabricated\nsamples, showing a value of $\\rho_c/\\rho_{ab}(300K) \\sim 5$ that raises up to\n19 near Tc. Finally, we have studied the pressure and temperature dependence of\nthe in-plane resistivity. The critical temperature decreases linearly upon\napplication of hydrostatic pressure (up to 2 GPa) similarly to overdoped\ncuprate superconductors. The resistivity shows saturation at high temperatures,\nsuggesting that the material approaches the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit for metallic\nconduction. Indeed, we have successfully modelled the resistivity in the normal\nstate with a parallel resistor model that is widely accepted for this state.\nAll the measured quantities suggest strong pressure dependence of the density\nof states.\n", "  We study the hydrodynamic interaction between two closely-spaced waving\nelastic cylinders immersed within a viscous liquid, at the creeping flow\nregime. The cylinders are actuated by a forced oscillation of the slope at\ntheir clamped end and are free at the opposite end. We obtain an expression for\nthe interaction force and apply an asymptotic expansion based on a small\nparameter representing the ratio between the elastic deflections and the\ndistance between the cylinders. The leading-order solution is an asymmetric\noscillation pattern at the two frequencies ($\\omega_1,\\omega_2$) in which the\ncylinders are actuated. Higher orders oscillate at frequencies which are\ncombinations of the actuation frequencies, where the first-order includes the\n$2\\omega_1,2\\omega_2,\\omega_1+\\omega_2$, and $\\omega_1-\\omega_2$ harmonics. For\nin-phase actuation with $\\omega_1= \\omega_2$, the deflection dynamics are\nidentical to an isolated cylinder with a modified Sperm number. For\nconfigurations with $\\omega_1\\approx \\omega_2$, the $\\omega_1-\\omega_2$ mode\nrepresents the dominant first-order interaction effect due to significantly\nsmaller effective Sperm number. Experiments are conducted to verify and\nillustrate the theoretical predictions.\n", "  In this work we present results of searching for satellites near the 18\nMelpomene and 532 Herculina asteroids, which were predicted in 1978 from\nanalysis of observations at the occultation moments of HD 47239 and HR 5584 by\nthese asteroids respectively. In addition, we looked for satellites of the HD\n47239 and HR 5584 stars. During several observational periods at the 6-m BTA\ntelescope (SAO RAS) we did not detect any satellites near the 18 Melpomene and\n532 Herculina asteroids, and also HR 5584. In February 2016 we clearly detected\na satellite with $\\rho$ $\\approx$ 0.01 $\\div$ 0.02 arcsec close to HD 47239.\nThus, the 18 Melpomene asteroid is likely to be single.\n", "  We propose a novel design of superconducting nanowire avalanche\nphotodetectors (SNAPs), which combines the advantages of multi-stage avalanche\nSNAPs to lower the avalanche current I_AV and that of series-SNAPs to reduce\nthe reset time. As proof of principle, we fabricated 800 devices with large\ndetection area (15 um * 15 um) and five different designs on a single silicon\nchip for comparison, which include standard SNSPDs, series-3-SNAPs and our\nmodified series-SNAPs with double-stage avalanche structure 2*2-SNAPs,\n2*3-SNAPs, and 3*3-SNAPs. The former three types of the detectors demonstrate\nfully-saturated device detection efficiencies of ~20% while the latter two\ntypes are latching at larger bias currents. In addition, the I_AV of 2*2-SNAPs\nis only 64% of the switching current I_SW that is lower than series-3-SNAPs\n(74%) and well below that of 4-SNAPs (84%) reported elsewhere. We also measure\nthat the exponential decay times of the detectors are proportional to (1/n)^2\ndue to the lack of external choke inductors. In particular, the decay time of\n3*3-SNAPs is only 0.89 ns compared to the standard SNSPDs' 63.2 ns, showing the\npotential to attain GHz counting rates.\n", "  The actions for bosonic fields typically contain terms quadratic in the\nderivatives of the fields. This is not the case in the Palatini approach to\ngeneral relativity. The action does not contain any derivatives of the metric\nand it only contains terms linear in the derivatives of the connection. In\ngeneral relativity the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes, so it is\nnot possible to include such terms in the action. However, in more general\ntheories this is not the case.\n  In this paper I consider an action which is quadratic in the derivatives of\nthe metric and connection and show that it leads to the coupled\nEinstein-Maxwell theory or the coupled Einstein-Proca theory with the\nantisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor playing the role of the electromagnetic\nfield strength.\n", "  In this paper I consider surfaces in a space-time with a Killing vector\n$\\xi^{\\alpha}$ that is time-like and hypersurface orthogonal on one side of the\nsurface. The Killing vector may be either time-like or space-like on the other\nside of the surface. It has been argued that the surface is null if\n$\\xi_{\\alpha}\\xi^{\\alpha}\\rightarrow 0$ as the surface is approached from the\nstatic region. This implies that, in a coordinate system adapted to $\\xi$,\nsurfaces with $g_{tt}=0$ are null. In spherically symmetric space-times the\ncondition $g^{rr}=0$ instead of $g_{tt}=0$ is sometimes used to locate null\nsurfaces.\n  In this paper I examine the arguments that lead to these two different\ncriteria and show that both arguments are incorrect. A surface $\\xi=$ constant\nhas a normal vector whose norm is proportional to $\\xi_{\\alpha}\\xi^{\\alpha}$.\nThis lead to the conclusion that surfaces with $\\xi_{\\alpha}\\xi^{\\alpha}=0$ are\nnull. However, the proportionality factor generally diverges when $g_{tt}=0$,\nleading to a different condition for the norm to be null. In static spherically\nsymmetric space-times this condition gives $g^{rr}=0$, not $g_{tt}=0$.\n  The problem with the condition $g^{rr}=0$ is that the coordinate system is\nsingular on the surface. One can either use a nonsingular coordinate system or\nexamine the induced metric on the surface to determine if it is null. By using\nthese approaches it is shown that the correct criteria is $g_{tt}=0$. I also\nexamine the condition required for the surface to be nonsingular.\n", "  Further development of quantum emitter based communication and sensing\napplications intrinsically depends on the availability of robust single-photon\ndetectors. Here, we demonstrate a new generation of superconducting\nsingle-photon detectors specifically optimized for the 500-1100 nm wavelength\nrange, which overlaps with the emission spectrum of many interesting\nsolid-state atom-like systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy and silicon-vacancy\ncenters in diamond. The fabricated detectors have a wide dynamic range (up to\n350 million counts per second), low dark count rate (down to 0.1 counts per\nsecond), excellent jitter (62 ps), and the possibility of on-chip integration\nwith a quantum emitter. In addition to performance characterization, we tested\nthe detectors in real experimental conditions involving nanodiamond\nnitrogen-vacancy emitters enhanced by a hyperbolic metamaterial.\n", "  The suppression of the productions of the $\\eta$ meson in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions and its ratio of $\\eta/\\pi^0$ are computed theoretically\nin the framework of the perturbative QCD(pQCD) to confront the experimental\ndata which matches well. We explore how the hadron production ratios\nas$\\eta/\\pi^0$ would further disclose the informations of the production\nsuppressions due to the energy loss of the energetic jet that propagating\nthough the QGP medium. Also, we present our further studies on vector mesons\nsuch as $\\rho^0$ and $\\phi$ within the same framework. The theoretical\npredictions based on pQCD are thus firstly given which give a decent\ndescription on the experimental measurements. It paved the way to the uniformly\nunderstanding of the strong suppression of single hadron productions at large\ntransverse momentum which is a convincing evidence of the jet quenching effect.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the model-independent traversable wormholes\nfrom baryon acoustic oscillations. Firstly, we place the statistical\nconstraints on the average dark energy equation of state $\\omega_{av}$ by only\nusing BAO data. Subsequently, two specific wormhole solutions are obtained,\ni.e, the cases of the constant redshift function and a special choice for the\nshape function. For the first case, we analyze the traversabilities of the\nwormhole configuration, and for the second case, we find that one can construct\ntheoretically a traversable wormhole with infinitesimal amounts of average null\nenergy condition violating phantom fluid. Furthermore, we perform the stability\nanalysis for the first case, and find that the stable equilibrium\nconfigurations may increase for increasing values of the throat radius of the\nwormhole in the cases of a positive and a negative surface energy density. It\nis worth noting that the obtained wormhole solutions are static and spherically\nsymmetrical metric, and that we assume $\\omega_{av}$ to be a constant between\ndifferent redshifts when placing constraints, hence, these wormhole solutions\ncan be interpreted as stable and static phantom wormholes configurations at\nsome certain redshift which lies in the range [0.32, 2.34].\n", "  In order to detect the effect of the surface charge discreteness on the\nproperties at the solid-liquid interface, molecular dynamics simulation model\ntaking consideration of the vibration of wall atoms was used to investigate the\nion and water performance under different charge distributions. Through the\ncomparison between simulation results and the theoretical prediction, it was\nfound that, with the degree of discreteness increasing, much more counterions\nwere attracted to the surface. These ions formed a denser accumulating layer\nwhich located much nearer to the surface and caused charge inversion. The ions\nin this layer were non-hydrated or partially hydrated. When a voltage was\napplied across the nanochannel, this dense accumulating layer did not move\nunlike the ions near uniformly charged surface. From the water density profiles\nobtained in nanochannels with different surface charge distributions, the\ninfluence of the surface charge discreteness on the water distributions could\nbe neglected.\n", "  We discuss the broadband X-ray spectrum of GRS 1734-292 obtained from\nnon-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations, performed in 2009 and\n2014, respectively. GRS1734-292 is a Seyfert 1 galaxy, located near the\nGalactic plane at $z=0.0214$. The NuSTAR spectrum ($3-80$ keV) is dominated by\na primary power-law continuum with $\\Gamma=1.65 \\pm 0.05$ and a high-energy\ncutoff $E_c=53^{+11}_{-8}$ keV, one of the lowest measured by NuSTAR in a\nSeyfert galaxy. Comptonization models show a temperature of the coronal plasma\nof $kT_e=11.9^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ keV and an optical depth, assuming a slab\ngeometry, $\\tau=2.98^{+0.16}_{-0.19}$ or a similar temperature and\n$\\tau=6.7^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ assuming a spherical geometry. The 2009 XMM-Newton\nspectrum is well described by a flatter intrinsic continuum\n($\\Gamma=1.47^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$) and one absorption line due to Fe\\textsc{XXV}\nK$\\alpha$ produced by a warm absorber. Both data sets show a modest iron\nK$\\alpha$ emission line at $6.4$ keV and the associated Compton reflection, due\nto reprocessing from neutral circumnuclear material.\n", "  Background: Guanine quadruplexes (GQs) play vital roles in many cellular\nprocesses and are of much interest as drug targets. In contrast to the\navailability of many structural studies, there is still limited knowledge on GQ\nfolding.\n  Scope of review: We review recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies\nof the folding of GQs, with an emphasis paid to the human telomeric DNA GQ. We\nexplain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to\nstudy unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss\nthe potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in\nthe folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally\ndifferent from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best\ndescribed by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between\nat least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different\nconformational ensembles.\n  Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain\nexperiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of\nlong-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the\nfree energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences\nto populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts. The extreme\ncomplexity of the KP of GQs typically prevents an appropriate description of\nthe folding landscape using just a few order parameters or collective\nvariables.\n  General significance: We reconcile available computational and experimental\nstudies of GQ folding and formulate basic principles characterizing GQ folding\nlandscapes\n", "  Using Aggregation-Volume-Bias Monte Carlo simulations along with Successive\nUmbrella Sampling and Histogram Re-weighting, we study the phase diagram of a\nsystem of dumbbells formed by two touching spheres having variable sizes, as\nwell as different interaction properties. The first sphere ($h$) interacts with\nall other spheres belonging to different dumbbells with a hard-sphere\npotential. The second sphere ($s$) interacts via a square-well interaction with\nother $s$ spheres belonging to different dumbbells and with a hard-sphere\npotential with all remaining $h$ spheres. We focus on the region where the $s$\nsphere is larger than the $h$ sphere, as measured by a parameter $1\\le\n\\alpha\\le 2 $ controlling the relative size of the two spheres.\n  As $\\alpha \\to 2$ a simple fluid of square-well spheres is recovered, whereas\n$\\alpha \\to 1$ corresponds to the Janus dumbbell limit, where the $h$ and $s$\nspheres have equal sizes. Many phase diagrams falling into three classes are\nobserved, depending on the value of $\\alpha$. The $1.8 \\le \\alpha \\le 2$ is\ndominated by a gas-liquid phase separation very similar to that of a pure\nsquare-well fluid with varied critical temperature and density. When $1.3 \\le\n\\alpha \\le 1.8$ we find a progressive destabilization of the gas-liquid phase\ndiagram by the onset of self-assembled structures, that eventually lead to a\nmetastability of the gas-liquid transition below $\\alpha=1.2$.\n", "  Plasmonic nanostructures that support surface plasmon (SP) resonance\npotentially provide a route for the development of nanoengineered nonlinear\noptical devices. In this work, second-order nonlinear light scattering,\nspecifically sum-frequency generation (SFG) and second-harmonic generation\n(SHG), from plasmonic nanoantennas is modeled by the boundary element method\n(BEM). Far-field scattering patterns are compared with the results calculated\nby the Mie theory to validate the accuracy of the developed nonlinear solver.\nThe SFG from a multi-resonant nanoantenna (MR-NA) and the SHG from a\nparticle-in-cavity nanoantenna (PIC-NA) are analyzed by using the developed\nmethod. Enhancements of the scattering signals due to double-resonance of the\nMR-NA and gap plasmonic mode of the PIC-NA are observed. Unidirectional\nnonlinear radiation for the PIC-NA is realized. Moreover, its emission\ndirection can be controlled by the location of the nanosphere. This work\nprovides new theoretical tools and design guidelines for plasmonic nonlinear\nnanoantennas.\n", "  We consider the description of open quantum systems with probability sinks\n(or sources) in terms of general non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.~Within such a\nframework, we study novel possible definitions of the quantum linear entropy as\nan indicator of the flow of information during the dynamics. Such linear\nentropy functionals are necessary in the case of a partially Wigner-transformed\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian (which is typically useful within a mixed\nquantum-classical representation). Both the case of a system represented by a\npure non-Hermitian Hamiltonian as well as that of the case of non-Hermitian\ndynamics in a classical bath are explicitly considered.\n", "  We propose to measure the decay asymmetry parameters in the hadronic weak\ndecays of singly charmed baryons, such as $\\ldc\\to\\ld\\pi^+,\\Sigma^0\\pi^+,p \\bar\nK_0$, $\\Xi_c^0\\to\\Xi^-\\pi^+$ and $\\Omega_c^0\\to\\Omega^-\\pi^+$. The joint\nangular formulae for these processes are presented, and are used to extract the\nasymmetry parameters in $\\ee$ annihilation data. Base on the current $\\ldc$\ndata set collected at BESIII, we estimate the experimental sensitivities to\nmeasure the parameters $\\alpha_{\\ld\\pi^+}$ for $\\ldc\\to\\ld\\pi^+$,\n$\\alpha_{\\Sigma^+\\pi^0}$ for $\\ldc\\to\\Sigma^+\\pi^0$ and $\\alpha_{\\usig\\pi^+}$\nfor $\\ldc\\to\\usig\\pi^+$.\n", "  We introduce an Active Vertex Model (AVM) for cell-resolution studies of the\nmechanics of confluent epithelial tissues consisting of tens of thousands of\ncells, with a level of detail inaccessible to similar methods. The AVM combines\nthe Vertex Model for confluent epithelial tissues with active matter dynamics.\nThis introduces a natural description of the cell motion and accounts for\nmotion patterns observed on multiple scales. Furthermore, cell contacts are\ngenerated dynamically from positions of cell centres. This not only enables\nefficient numerical implementation, but provides a natural description of the\nT1 transition events responsible for local tissue rearrangements. The AVM also\nincludes cell alignment, cell-specific mechanical properties, cell growth,\ndivision and apoptosis. In addition, the AVM introduces a flexible, dynamically\nchanging boundary of the epithelial sheet allowing for studies of phenomena\nsuch as the fingering instability or wound healing. We illustrate these\ncapabilities with a number of case studies.\n", "  We present an exploratory study of the electromagnetic corrections to meson\nmasses and the hadronic vacuum polarization using $N_f=2+1$ Domain Wall\nfermions. These corrections are estimated with two different approaches, a\nstochastic approach using $U(1)$ gauge configurations for the photon fields,\nand a perturbative approach through a QED perturbative expansion of the QCD+QED\npath integral. We compare results and statistical errors from both methods.\n", "  The electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of SnSe are studied by\nfirst-principles methods. The inclusion of van der Waals dispersive corrections\nimproves the agreement of structural parameters with experiments. The bands\nstructure and projected density of states justify the macroscopic anisotropy\nexhibited by this system. An original methodology is used to estimate the\nchemical potential and the relaxation time for the electrical and thermal\nconductivities. Following this methodology, the Seebeck coefficient and thermal\nconductivity for single crystals and polycrystals are described in good\nagreement with experimental data. As for the electrical conductivity, values\ncalculated with a temperature-dependent relaxation time compare well with\navailable measurements, especially for single crystals, polycrystals are better\ndescribed by a constant relaxation time. Finally, the figure of merit of SnSe\nsingle crystals and polycrystals is calculated. It is found to exhibit a\nmaximum for some \"ideal\" carrier concentration, and might be noticeably\nenhanced by using carrier concentrations higher than the experimental ones.\nFrom these findings, possible strategies to increase the figure of merit in\npractise are suggested.\n", "  Four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory admits asymptotically flat\nextremal dyonic solutions for an infinite discrete sequence of the coupling\nconstant values. The quantization condition arises as consequence of regularity\nof the dilaton function at the event horizon. These dyons satisfy the no-force\ncondition and have flat reduced three spaces like true BPS configurations, but\nno supersymmetric embeddings are known except for some cases of lower values of\nthe coupling sequence.\n", "  We present a monolithic mechanical metamaterial comprising a periodic\narrangement of snapping units with tunable tensile behavior. Under tension, the\nmetamaterial undergoes a large extension caused by sequential snap-through\ninstabilities, and exhibits a pattern switch from an undeformed wavy-shape to a\ndiamond configuration. By means of experiments performed on 3D printed\nprototypes, numerical simulations and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how\nthe snapping architecture can be tuned to generate a range of nonlinear\nmechanical responses including monotonic, S-shaped, plateau and non-monotonic\nsnap-through behavior. This work contributes to the development of design\nstrategies that allow programming nonlinear mechanical responses in solids.\n", "  Auxetic materials become thicker rather than thinner when stretched,\nexhibiting an unusual negative Poisson's ratio well suited for designing shape\ntransforming metamaterials. Current auxetic designs, however, are often\nmonostable and cannot maintain the transformed shape upon load removal. Here,\ninspired by ancient geometric motifs arranged in square and triangular grids,\nwe introduce a class of switchable architected materials exhibiting\nsimultaneous auxeticity and structural bistability. The material concept is\nexperimentally realized by perforating various cut motifs into a sheet of\nrubber, thus creating a network of rotating units connected with compliant\nhinges. The metamaterial performance is assessed through mechanical testing and\naccurately predicted by a coherent set of finite element simulations. A\ndiscussion on a rich set of mechanical phenomena follows to shed light on the\nmain design principles governing bistable auxetics.\n", "  In the study of the large-scale structure (LSS), it is challenging to\ndescribe all relevant physical processes, so it is appealing to develop some\neffective approach that best represents the original system. Particularly,\nsince we are only interested in the statistical properties instead of specific\nrealizations in LSS, with a given evolution history of the probability density\nfunction (PDF), there could exist alternative dynamical system that obeys the\nexact same PDF evolution, which we will name as the statistical equivalence\nprinciple. This PDF equation is expressed as a kinetic theory of all relevant\ndegree of freedoms, and as a first order partial differential equation, it\ncould be solved by the method of characteristics. In this paper, we show that\nthese characteristic curves would lead to a theory quite similar to the\nwell-studied effective field theory (EFT) of LSS. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at realization level, our equivalent dynamics is valid\nonly statistically. In this formula, the small-scale influence is expressed as\nthe ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the large-scale\nmodes. By applying the Gram-Charlier expansion, we demonstrate a different\nstructure of the effective counter terms. Our formalism is a natural framework\nfor discussing the evolution of statistical properties of large-scale modes,\nand provides an alternative view for understanding the relationship between\ngeneral effective dynamics and standard perturbation theory.\n", "  Marine magnetic anomalies of the tiny wiggles (TW) type can be used to solve\ngeohistorical and paleomagnetic problems. The model fields corresponding to\nPaleocene-Eocene anomalies in the northwestern Indian Ocean, which were formed\nduring the fasts preading stage, were studied. For these fields, widely used\ninterpretation methods were compared. The testing was performed with first the\nclassical block model and then more complex models reflecting actual processes\nof oceanic accretion and magnetic field variations in the past. Spectral and\nstatistical methods are used to estimate the magnetic anomalies(MA) resolving.\nPreprocessing of a set profiles based on the maximal correlation is considered.\n", "  We describe the effect of the gravitational $\\Theta$-parameter on the\nbehavior of the stretched horizon of a black hole in $(3+1)$-dimensions. The\ngravitational $\\Theta$-term is a total derivative, however, it affects the\ntransport properties of the horizon. In particular, the horizon acquires a\nthird order parity violating, dimensionless transport coefficient which affects\nthe way localized perturbations scramble on the horizon. In the context of the\ngauge/gravity duality, the $\\Theta$-term induces a non-trivial contact term in\nthe energy-momentum tensor of a $(2+1)-$dimensional large-N gauge theory, which\nadmits a dual gravity description. As a consequence, the dual gauge theory in\nthe presence of the $\\Theta$-term acquires the same third order parity\nviolating transport coefficient.\n", "  In nonlinear plasmonics, the switching threshold of optical bistability is\nlimited by the weak nonlinear responses from the conventional Kerr dielectric\nmedia. Considering the giant nonlinear susceptibility of graphene, here we\ndevelop a nonlinear scattering model under the mean field approximation and\nstudy the bistable scattering in graphene-coated dielectric nanowires based on\nthe semi-analytical solutions. We find that the switching intensities of\nbistable scattering can be smaller than 1MW/cm2 at the working frequency. To\nfurther decrease the switching intensities, we show that the most important\nfactor that restricts the bistable scattering is the relaxation time of\ngraphene, rather than the chemical potential and the permittivity of the\ndielectric nanowire. Our work not only reveals some general characteristics of\ngraphene-based bistable scattering, but also provides a guidance to further\napplications of optical bistability in the high speed all-optical signal\nprocessing.\n", "  Graphene materials and structures have become an essential part of modern\nelectronics and photovoltaics. However, despite many production methods,\napplications of graphene-based structures are hindered by high costs, lack of\nscalability and limitations in spatial patterning. Here we fabricate\nthree-dimensional functional solid microstructures of reduced graphene oxide in\na lyotropic nematic liquid crystal of graphene oxide flakes using a pulsed\nnear-infrared laser. This reliable, scalable approach is mask-free, does not\nrequire special chemical reduction agents, and can be implemented at ambient\nconditions starting from aqueous graphene oxide flakes. Orientational ordering\nof graphene oxide flakes in self-assembled liquid-crystalline phases enables\nlaser patterning of complex, three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide\nstructures and colloidal particles, such as trefoil knots, with \"frozen\"\norientational order of flakes. These structures and particles are mechanically\nrigid and range from hundreds of nanometres to millimetres in size, as needed\nfor applications in colloids, electronics, photonics and display technology.\n", "  We report the first observation of nonlinear harmonic generation and sum\nfrequency generation (SFG) coupled with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) via\nthe second-order (\\chi^{(2)}) and the third-order (\\chi^{(3)}) nonlinearities\nin a silica microbottle resonator. The visible light emission due to third\nharmonic generation (THG) was observed in both the output of a tapered fiber\nand the optical microscope images, which can be used to identify the axial mode\nprofiles. SFG enabled by three- and four-wave mixing processes between the pump\nlight and the light generated via SRS was also observed. Second Harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) and the SFG are enabled by \\chi^{(2)} induced in silica by\nsurface effects and multipole excitations.\n", "  Dimensionality reduction and matrix factorization techniques are important\nand useful machine-learning techniques in many fields. Nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) is particularly useful for spectral analysis and image\nprocessing in astronomy. I present the vectorized update rules and an\nindependent proof of their convergence for NMF with heteroscedastic\nmeasurements and missing data. I release a Python implementation of the rules\nand use an optical spectroscopic dataset of extragalactic sources as an example\nfor demonstration. A future paper will present results of applying the\ntechnique to image processing of planetary disks.\n", "  We have stabilized the {\\alpha}-Fe1.6Ga0.4O3 (Ga doped {\\alpha}-Fe2O3) system\nin rhombohedral structure. The system has shown magnetically canted\nferromagnetic state and ferroelectric properties at room temperature. In first\ntime, we confirm the existence of magneto-electric coupling and\nmultiferro-electric properties at room temperature in the Ga doped\n{\\alpha}-Fe2O3 system based on the experimental observation of magnetic field\ncontrolled electric polarization and electric field controlled magnetization.\nThe {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 system does not exhibit electric field controlled magnetic\nexchange bias effect, where as Ga doped {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 showed exchange bias\nshift up to the value of 370 Oe. We have recorded the response of\ncurrent-voltage characteristics and in-field magnetic relaxation of the system\nunder the simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields. The\nmagnetization of the system is found highly sensitive to the ON and OFF modes,\nas well as change of the polarity of external electric field. The system is a\nnew addition in the list of non-traditional\nmagneto-electrics/multi-ferroelectrics so far reported in literature. Such\nnovel materials, where magnetization and electric polarization can be\ncontrolled by simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields, is in\nthe increasing demand for potential applications in the field of next\ngeneration magnetic sensor, switching, non-volatile memory and spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  Quantum teleportation (QT) is a fundamentally remarkable communication\nprotocol that also finds many important applications for quantum informatics.\nGiven a quantum entangled resource, it is crucial to know to what extent one\ncan accomplish the QT. This is usually assessed in terms of output fidelity,\nwhich can also be regarded as an operational measure of entanglement. In the\ncase of multipartite communication when each communicator possesses a part of\n$N$-partite entangled state, not all pairs of communicators can achieve a high\nfidelity due to monogamy property of quantum entanglement. We here investigate\nhow such a monogamy relation arises in multipartite continuous-variable (CV)\nteleportation particularly using a Gaussian entangled state. We show a strict\nmonogamy relation, i.e. a sender cannot achieve a fidelity higher than optimal\ncloning limit with more than one receiver. While this seems rather natural\nowing to the no-cloning theorem, a strict monogamy relation still holds even if\nthe sender is allowed to individually manipulate the reduced state in\ncollaboration with each receiver to improve fidelity. The local operations are\nfurther extended to non-Gaussian operations such as photon subtraction and\naddition, and we demonstrate that the Gaussian cloning bound cannot be beaten\nby more than one pair of communicators. Furthermore we investigate a\nquantitative form of monogamy relation in terms of teleportation capability,\nfor which we show that a faithful monogamy inequality does not exist.\n", "  This paper describes a new numerical method for solving eigenstate problems,\nsuch as time-independent Schrodinger equation. The idea is to use the first\norder perturbation theory to rewrite the eigenvalue problem as a system of\nfirst order differential equations and then solve them using numerical\ntechniques. The method allows to introduce perturbation terms of any order of\nmagnitude. The algorithm is in some cases faster than conventional variational\nmethod and offers a new insight into perturbation theory. It is also easy to\nunderstand and implement.\n", "  The present study is dedicated to the influence of different substrate and\nbuffer layer materials on the martensitic transformation in sputter deposited\nepitaxial shape memory Heusler alloys. For this, the magnetocaloric Heusler\nalloy Ni-Co-Mn-Al \\cite{Teichert2015b} is grown on MgO(001),\nMgAl$_{2}$O$_{4}$(001), and MgO(001)/V substrates, which exhibit a lattice\nmisfit to the Ni-Co-Mn-Al between $-1.2\\%$ and $3.6\\%$. By temperature\ndependent X-ray diffraction measurements it is shown that the optimum buffer\nlayer for shape memory Heusler films is not one with minimum lattice misfit,\nbut one with minimum Young's modulus and moderate misfit because an elastic\nbuffer layer can deform during the martensitic transformation of the Heusler\nlayer. Furthermore, epitaxial strain caused by a moderate lattice misfit does\nnot significantly change the martensitic transformation temperatures.\n", "  Quantum plasma with arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas is\nconsidered. In plasma N (N>2) external electromagnetic waves are propagated. It\nis required to find the response of plasma to these waves. From kinetic Wigner\nequation for quantum collisionless plasmas distribution function in square-law\napproach on quantities of vector potentials of N electric fields is received.\nThe formula for electric current calculation is deduced at arbitrary\ntemperature, i.e. at arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas. It is\nshown, that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence of the longitudinal\nelectric current directed along a wave vector. This longitudinal current is\northogonal to the known transversal current received at the linear analysis.\nThe case of small values of wave number is considered. It is shown, that in\ncase of small values of wave numbers the longitudinal current in quantum plasma\ncoincides with a longitudinal current in classical plasma.\n", "  We present an experimental and numerical study of immiscible two-phase flow\nin 3-dimensional (3D) porous media to find the relationship between the\nvolumetric flow rate ($Q$) and the total pressure difference ($\\Delta P$) in\nthe steady state. We show that in the regime where capillary forces compete\nwith the viscous forces, the distribution of capillary barriers at the\ninterfaces effectively creates a yield threshold, making the fluids reminiscent\nof a Bingham viscoplastic fluid in the porous medium, introducing a threshold\npressure $P_t$. In this regime, $Q$ depends quadratically on an excess pressure\ndrop ($\\Delta P-P_t$). While increasing the flow-rate, there is a transition,\nbeyond which the flow is Newtonian and the relationship is linear. In our\nexperiments, we build a model porous medium using a column of glass beads\ntransporting two fluids -- de-ionized water and air. For the numerical study,\nreconstructed 3D pore-networks from real core samples are considered and the\ntransport of wetting and non-wetting fluids through the network are modeled by\ntracking the fluid interfaces with time. We find agreement between our\nnumerical and experimental results. Our results match the mean-field results\nreported earlier.\n", "  For the first time, we report the formation of pentagonal atomic chains\nduring tensile deformation of ultra thin BCC Fe nanowires. Extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations have been performed on $<$100$>$/{110} BCC Fe nanowires\nwith different cross section width varying from 0.404 to 3.634 nm at\ntemperatures ranging from 10 to 900 K. The results indicate that above certain\ntemperature, long and stable pentagonal atomic chains form in BCC Fe nanowires\nwith cross section width less than 2.83 nm. The temperature, above which the\npentagonal chains form, increases with increase in nanowire size. The\npentagonal chains have been observed to be highly stable over large plastic\nstrains and contribute to high ductility in Fe nanowires.\n", "  $B$-physics is one of the most promising windows to find new physics in the\nflavor sector. One key ingredient to these searches are precise theoretical\npredictions derived from the Standard Model. Focusing at the nonperturbative\nQCD contributions, we carry out lattice QCD simulations in order to calculate\n$B$-meson decay constants and semi-leptonic form factors. Combined with\nexperimental measurements our results enable us to determine CKM matrix\nelements.\n  Here we present $B$ and $B_s$ meson decay constants as well as semi-leptonic\nform factors including rare decays, CKM or GIM suppressed in the Standard\nModel. Our results are based on the set of 2+1 flavor domain-wall Iwasaki gauge\nfield configurations generated by the RBC-UKQCD collaboration. Heavy $b$-quarks\nare simulated using the relativistic heavy quark action.\n", "  Field stars are frequently formed in pairs, and many of these binaries are\npart of triples or even higher-order systems. Even though, the principles of\nsingle stellar evolution and binary evolution, have been accepted for a long\ntime, the long-term evolution of stellar triples is poorly understood. The\npresence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly\nalter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical\nbehavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which\nthe eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and\nouter orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of\ntidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar\ninteractions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a\nself-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body\ndynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general\nunderstanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems. In this paper, we\naim to address some of these hiatus, by discussing the dominant physical\nprocesses of hierarchical triple evolution, and presenting heuristic recipes\nfor these processes. To improve our understanding on hierarchical stellar\ntriples, these descriptions are implemented in a public source code TrES which\ncombines three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach) with stellar\nevolution and their mutual influences. Note that modeling through a phase of\nstable mass transfer in an eccentric orbit is currently not implemented in TrES\n, but can be implemented with the appropriate methodology at a later stage.\n", "  The problem of infering the top component of a noisy sample covariance matrix\nwith prior information about the distribution of its entries is considered, in\nthe framework of the spiked covariance model. Using the replica method of\nstatistical physics the computation of the overlap between the top components\nof the sample and population covariance matrices is formulated as an explicit\noptimization problem for any kind of entry-wise prior information. The approach\nis illustrated on the case of top components including large entries, and the\ncorresponding phase diagram is shown. The calculation predicts that the maximal\nsampling noise level at which the recovery of the top population component\nremains possible is higher than its counterpart in the spiked covariance model\nwith no prior information.\n", "  The propagation of ionic perturbations in a dusty plasma is considered\nthrough a three-species kinetic simulation approach, in which the temporal\nevolution of all three elements i.e. electrons, ions and dust particles are\nfollowed based on the Vlasov equation coupled with the Poisson equation. Two\ncases are focused upon: firstly a fully electron depleted dusty plasma, i.e., a\nplasma consisting of ions and dust-particles. The second case includes dusty\nplasmas with large electron-to-ion temperature ratios. The main features of the\nionic waves in these two settings including the dispersion relation and the\nLandau damping rate are studied. It is shown that the dispersion relation of\nthe ionic waves perfectly matches the dispersion relation of Langmuir waves and\nhence are called Langmuir-like ionic waves and can be considered as\nion-Langmuir waves. These waves can be theoretically predicted by the\ndispersion relation of the dust-ion-acoustic waves. The transition of ionic\nwaves from dust-ion-acoustic to Langmuir-like waves are shown to be\nsharp/smooth in first/second case. The Landau damping rates based on simulation\nresults are presented and compared with theoretical predictions wherever\npossible.\n", "  Zitterbewegung is a striking consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics\nwhich predicts that free Dirac electrons exhibit a rapid trembling motion even\nin the absence of external forces. The trembling motion of an electron results\nfrom the interference between the positive and the negative-energy solutions of\nthe Dirac equation, separated by one MeV, leading to oscillations at extremely\nhigh frequencies which are out of reach experimentally. Recently, it was shown\ntheoretically that electrons in III-V semiconductors are governed by similar\nequations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The small energy splittings\nup to meV result in Zitterbewegung at much smaller frequencies which should be\nexperimentally accessible as an AC current. Here, we demonstrate the\nZitterbewegung of electrons in a solid. We show that coherent electron\nZitterbewegung can be triggered by initializing an ensemble of electrons in the\nsame spin states in strained n-InGaAs and is probed as an AC current at GHz\nfrequencies. Its amplitude is shown to increase linearly with both the\nspin-orbit coupling strength and the Larmor frequency of the external magnetic\nfield. The latter dependence is the hallmark of the dynamical generation\nmechanism of the oscillatory motion of the Zitterbewegung. Our results\ndemonstrate that relativistic quantum mechanics can be studied in a rather\nsimple solid state system at moderate temperatures. Furthermore, the large\namplitude of the AC current at high precession frequencies enables ultra-fast\nspin sensitive electric read-out in solids.\n", "  If observed, charged lepton flavour violation is a clear sign of new physics\n- beyond the Standard Model minimally extended to accommodate neutrino\noscillation data. After a brief review of several charged lepton flavour\nviolation observables and their current experimental status, we consider\ndistinct extensions of the Standard Model which could potentially give rise to\nobservable signals, focusing on the case of models in which the mechanism of\nneutrino mass generation is the common source of neutral and charged lepton\nflavour violation.\n", "  We consider a Skyrme fluid with a constant radial profile in locally\nrotational Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. The Skyrme fluid is an anisotropic fluid\nwith zero heat flux and with an equation of state parameter $w_{S}$ that\n$\\left\\vert w_{s}\\right\\vert \\leq\\frac{1}{3}$. From the Einstein field\nequations we define the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. For the last equation we\nperform a Lie symmetry classification and we determine the invariant solutions\nfor the wavefunction of the model. Moreover from the Lie symmetries of the\nWheeler-DeWitt equation we construct Noetherian conservation laws for the field\nequations which we use in order to write the solution in closed form. We show\nthat all pf the cosmological parameters are expressed in terms of the scale\nfactor of the two dimensional sphere of the Kantowski-Sachs spacetime. Finally\nfrom the application of Noether's theorem for the Wheeler-DeWitt equation we\nderive conservation laws for the wavefunction of the universe.\n", "  We study the Hall effect in diluted plasmas within the two-fluids theory.\nComposed by two distinct species with opposite charge, such as electrons and\nions in fully ionised hydrogen, the plasma is driven by an electric field\nthrough a channel in the presence of a transversal magnetic field. As a\nconsequence, a separation of charge is induced producing an electric potential\ndifference. We have found a general relation for the Hall voltage as function\nof the mass and viscosity ratios, which converges to the usual expression in\nthe limit of solid matter, i.e. when ions are much more massive than electrons.\nAll the simulations have been performed using a three-dimensional\nLattice-Boltzmann model, which has been also validated for some relevant\napplications. Finally, we discuss the importance of our findings in the light\nof recent developments in plasma physics, in particular in magnetic\nreconnection.\n", "  We construct and study a two parameter gauged linear sigma model with gauge\ngroup $(U(1)^2\\times O(2))/{\\mathbb Z}_2$ that has a dual model with gauge\ngroup $(U(1)^2\\times SO(4))/{\\mathbb Z}_2$. The model has two geometric phases,\nthree hybrid phases and one phase whose character is unknown. One of the\ngeometric phases is strongly coupled and the other is weakly coupled, where\nstrong versus weak is exchanged under the duality. They correspond to two\nCalabi-Yau manifolds with $(h^{1,1},h^{2,1})=(2,24)$ which are birationally\ninequivalent but are expected to be derived equivalent. A region of the\ndiscriminant locus in the space of Fayet-Iliopoulos-theta parameters supports a\nmixed Coulomb-confining branch which is mapped to a mixed Coulomb-Higgs branch\nin the dual model.\n", "  We report on Raman experiments performed on a single crystal MoTe$_2$ sample.\nThe system belongs to the wide family of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides which\nincludes several of the most interesting two dimensional materials for both\nbasic and applied physics. Measurements were performed in the standard basal\nplane configuration, by placing the $ab$ plane of the crystal perpendicular to\nthe wave vector $k_i$ of the incident beam to explore the in plane vibrational\nmodes, and in the edge plane configuration with $k_i$ perpendicular to the\ncrystal $c$ axis, thus mainly exciting out-of-plane modes. For both\nconfigurations we performed a polarization-dependent Raman study and we were\nable to provide a complete assignment of the observed first- and second-order\nRaman peaks fully exploiting the polarization selection rules. Present findings\nare in complete agreement with previous first-order Raman data whereas a\nthorough analysis of the second-order Raman bands, either in basal- or\nedge-plane configurations, provides new information and a precise assignment of\nthese spectral structures. In particular, we have observed Raman active modes\nof the $M$ point of the Brillouin zone previously predicted by ab-initio\ncalculations and ascribed to either combination or overtone but never\npreviously measured.\n", "  In this work we investigate the ultraviolet behavior of Euclidean\nfour-derivative quantum gravity beyond perturbation theory. In addition to a\nperturbative fixed point, we find an ultraviolet fixed point that is\nnon-trivial in all couplings and is described by only two free parameters. This\nresult is in line with the asymptotic safety scenario in quantum gravity. In\nparticular, it supports the conjecture that the full theory is described by a\nfinite number of free parameters.\n", "  The concept of diagrammatic combinatorial Hopf algebras in the form\nintroduced for describing the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra\nin~\\cite{blasiak2010combinatorial} is extended to the case of so-called rule\ndiagrams that present graph rewriting rules and their composites. The resulting\nrule diagram algebra may then be suitably restricted in four different ways to\nwhat we call the rule algebras, which are non-commutative, unital associative\nalgebras that implement the algebra of compositions of graph rewriting rules.\nNotably, our framework reveals that there exist two more types of graph\nrewriting systems than previously known in the literature, and we present an\nanalysis of the structure of the rule algebras as well as a form of\nPoincar\\'{e}-Birkhoff-Witt theorem for the rule diagram algebra. Our work lays\nthe foundation for a fundamentally new way of analyzing graph transformation\nsystems, and embeds this very important concept from theoretical computer\nscience firmly into the realm of mathematical combinatorics and statistical\nphysics.\n", "  We show that the interpretation of $\\mathbf{D}=\\varepsilon_{0} \\mathbf{E}$ as\nvacuum polarization is consistent with quantum electrodynamics. A free\nelectromagnetic field polarizes the vacuum but the magnetization and\npolarization currents cancel giving zero source current. The speed of light is\na universal constant while the fine structure constant that couples the EM\nfield to matter runs. In that sense, the quantum vacuum can be understood as a\nmodern Lorentz invariant ether.\n", "  Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys hold great potential as an energy-saving\nstructural material for automative, aerospace applications. However, the use of\nMg alloys has been limited due to poor ductility and formability. Poor\nmechanical properties of Mg alloys origin from the insufficient number of slip\nsystems, and deformation twinning plays an important role to accommodate\nplastic deformation. Here, we report a comprehensive experimental and modeling\nstudy to understand crystal size effect on the transformation in deformation\nmodes in twin oriented Mg single crystals. The experiments reveal two regimes\nof size effects: (1) single twin propagation, where a typical \"smaller the\nstronger\" behavior was dominant in pillars {\\le} 18 {\\mu}m in diameter, and (2)\ntwin-twin interaction, which results in anomalous strain hardening in pillars >\n18 {\\mu}m. Molecular dynamics simulations further indicate a transition from\ntwinning to dislocation mediated plasticity for crystal sizes below a few\nhundred nanometers. Our results provide new understanding of the fundamental\ndeformation modes of twin oriented Mg from nano-scale to bulk, and insights to\ndesign Mg alloys with superior mechanical properties through dimensional\nrefinement. This subsequently can materialize into more utilization of Mg\nalloys as a structural material in technologically relevant applications.\n", "  We study the production and decay of a light charged Higgs boson at the\nfuture Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) in the framework of the Two Higgs\nDoublet Type III, assuming a four-zero texture in the Yukawa matrices and a\ngeneral Higgs potential. We analyze the charge current production processes\n$e^- p \\to \\nu_e q H^+ $ considering the signature $H^+ \\to c \\bar{b} + c.c.$\nof the final state. We take this signature and we compare it to the irreducible\nbackground from Standard Model (SM) interactions. We consider scenarios of the\nmodel which are consistent with current experimental data from Higgs and flavor\nphysics.\n", "  We propose a model of a programmable quantum processing device realizable\nwith existing nanophotonic technologies and which can be viewed as a basis for\nnew high performance hardware architectures. We present protocols and their\nphysical implementation on the controlled photon transfer for executing basic\nsingle-qubit and multi-qubit gates. The possible operation of this quantum\ncomputer scheme is analyzed. The physical architecture is then formalized by a\nmathematical model of the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), which is used as a\nbasis for the Quantum Programming Framework that makes it possible to perform\nuniversal quantum computations in a multitasking environment.\n", "  Totally symmetric arbitrary spin conformal field propagating in flat space of\ndimension greater than or equal to four are studied. For such fields, we\ndevelop ordinary-derivative light-cone gauge formulation. We derive explicit\nform of restrictions imposed by conformal algebra kinematical symmetries on\ninteraction vertices. Cubic interaction vertices for conformal scalar fields\nwith arbitrary conformal dimensions and vector conformal fields in space time\nof arbitrary dimensions are considered in details.\n", "  In this paper we report on a comparative study of the low temperature\nemission and polarisation properties of InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) grown on\nnonpolar a-plane and m-plane free-standing bulk GaN substrates where the In\ncontent varied from 0.14 to 0.28 in the m-plane series and 0.08 to 0.21 for the\na-plane series. The low temperature photoluminescence spectra from both sets of\nsamples are very broad with full width at half-maximum height increasing from\n81 to 330 meV as the In fraction increases. Comparative photoluminescence\nexcitation spectroscopy indicates that the recombination mainly involves\nstrongly localised carriers. At a temperature of 10 K the degree of linear\npolarisation of the a-plane samples is much smaller than of the m-plane\ncounterparts and also varies across the spectrum. From polarisation-resolved\nphotoluminescence excitation spectroscopy we measured the energy splitting\nbetween the lowest valence sub-band states to lie in the range of 23-54 meV for\nboth a-and m-plane samples in which we could observe distinct exciton features\nin the polarised photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy. Thus, the thermal\noccupation of a higher valence subband cannot be responsible for the reduction\nof the degree of linear polarisation. Time-resolved spectroscopy indicates that\nin a-plane samples there is an extra emission component which at least partly\nresponsible for the reduction in the degree of linear polarisation.\n", "  V-pit-defects in GaN-based light-emitting diodes induced by dislocations are\nconsidered beneficial to electroluminescence because they relax the strain in\nInGaN quantum wells and also enhance the hole lateral injection through\nsidewall of V-pits. In this paper, regularly arranged V-pits are formed on\nc-plane GaN grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy on conventional c-plane\ncone-patterned sapphire substrates. The size of V-pits and area of flat GaN can\nbe adjusted by changing growth temperature. Five pairs of InGaN/GaN\nmulti-quantumwell and also a light-emitting diode structure are grown on this\nV-pit-shaped GaN. Two peaks around 410 nm and 450 nm appearing in both\nphotoluminescence and cathodeluminescence spectra are from the semipolar\nInGaN/GaN multi-quantum-well on sidewalls of V-pits and cplane InGaN/GaN\nmulti-quantum-well, respectively. In addition, dense bright spots can be\nobserved on the surface of light-emitting diode when it works under small\ninjection current, which are believed owing to the enhanced hole injection\naround V-pits.\n", "  Contact resistance and thermal degradation of metal-silicon contacts are\nchallenges in nanoscale CMOS as well as in power device applications. Titanium\nsilicide (TiSi) contacts are commonly used metal-silicon contacts, but are\nknown to diffuse into the active region under high current stress. In this\npaper we show that a graphenic carbon (C) contact deposited on n-type silicon\n(C-Si) by CVD, has the same low Schottky barrier height of 0.45 eV as TiSi, but\na much improved reliability against high current stress. The C-Si contact is\nover 100 million times more stable against high current stress pulses than the\nconventionally used TiSi junction. The C-Si contact properties even show\npromise to establish an ultra-low, high temperature stable contact resistance.\nThe finding has important consequences for the enhancement of reliability in\npower devices as well as in Schottky-diodes and electrical contacts to silicon\nin general.\n", "  Nanostars (NSTs) are spiky nanocrystals with plasmonic hot spots. In this\nstudy, we show that strong electromagnetic fields localized in the nanostar\ntips are able to generate large numbers of energetic (hot) electrons, which can\nbe used for photochemistry. To compute plasmonic nanocrystals with complex\nshapes, we develop a quantum approach based on the effect of surface generation\nof hot electrons. We then apply this approach to nanostars, nanorods and\nnanospheres. We found that that the plasmonic nanostars with multiple hot spots\nhave the best characteristics for optical generation of hot electrons compared\nto the cases of nanorods and nanospheres. Generation of hot electrons is a\nquantum effect and appears due to the optical transitions near the surfaces of\nnanocrystals. The quantum properties of nanocrystals are strongly size- and\nmaterial-dependent. In particular, the silver nanocrystals significantly\novercome the case of gold for the quantum rates of hot-electron generation.\nAnother important factor is the size of a nanocrystal. Small nanocrystals are\nmore efficient for the hot-electron generation since they exhibit stronger\nquantum surface effects. The results of this study can useful for designing\nnovel material systems for solar photocatalytic applications.\n", "  We use the correlation relation between the energy emitted by the GRBs in\ntheir prompt phases and the X-ray afterglow fluxes, in an effort to constrain\ncosmological parameters and aiming to construct a Hubble diagram at high\nredshifts, i.e. beyond those found with Type Ia supernovae.\n  We use a sample of 126 \\textit{Swift} GRBs, that we have selected among more\nthan 800 long bursts observed until April 2015. The selection is based on a few\nobservational constraints: GRB flux higher than 0.4 $photons/cm^2/s$ in the\nband 15-150 keV, spectrum fitted with simple power law, redshift accurately\nknown and given, and X-ray afterglow observed and flux measured.\n  The statistical method of maximum likelihood is then used to determine the\nbest cosmological parameters ($\\Omega_M$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$) that give the\nbest correlation for two relations: a) the Amati relation (between intrinsic\nspectral peak energy $E_{p,i}$ and the equivalent isotropic energy), b) the\nDainotti relation, namely between the X-ray afterglow luminosity $L_X$ and the\nbreak time $T_a$, which is observed in the X-ray flux FX.\n  Although the number of GRBs with high redshifts is rather small, and despite\nthe notable dispersion found in the data, the results we have obtained are\nquite encouraging and promising. The results obtained using the Amati relation\nare close to those obtained using the Type Ia supernovae, and they appear to\nindicate a universe dominated by dark energy. However, those obtained with the\ncorrelation between the break time and the X-ray afterglow luminosity is\nconsistent with the findings of the WMAP study of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation, and they seem to indicate a de Sitter-Einstein universe\ndominated by matter.\n"]}
