Phys. Rev. B, 75, 045439 (2007)]. The procedure has\nbeen extended and applied to predict the absorption coefficient of a quaternary\nnanocomposite consisting of Cu, Ag, and Au nanospheres embedded in a SiO2 host\nmatrix. Significant enhancement of the absorption coefficient is observed over\nthe spectral range 350-800 nm. The magnitude of this enhancement can be\ncontrolled by varying the nanosphere diameter and the individual metal volume\nfraction with respect to the host matrix. We have determined the optimal\ncomposition resulting in enhanced broadband (350nm-800nm) absorption of the\nsolar spectrum using a simulated annealing algorithm. Fabricating such\ncomposite materials with a desired optical absorption has potential\napplications in solar energy harvesting.\n", "  We present a first-principles derivation of the main results of the Kerr/CFT\ncorrespondence and its extensions using only tools from gravity and quantum\nfield theory. Firstly, we review properties of extremal black holes with in\nparticular the construction of an asymptotic Virasoro symmetry in the\nnear-horizon limit. The entropy of extremal spinning or charged black holes is\nshown to match with a chiral half of Cardy's formula. Secondly, we show how a\nthermal 2-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) is relevant to reproduce the\ndynamics of near-superradiant probes around near-extremal black holes in the\nsemi-classical limit. Thirdly, we review the hidden conformal symmetries of\nasymptotically-flat black holes away from extremality and present how the\nnon-extremal entropy can be matched with Cardy's formula. We follow an\neffective field theory approach and consider the Kerr-Newman black hole and its\ngeneralizations in various supergravity theories. The interpretation of these\nresults by deformed dual conformal field theories is discussed and contrasted\nwith properties of standard 2-dimensional CFTs. We conclude with a list of open\nproblems.\n", "  In this letter, it is reported that the first experimental results are\nassociated with the GAM induced by energetic electrons (eEGAM) in HL-2A Ohmic\nplasma. The energetic-electrons are generated by parallel electric fields\nduring magnetic reconnection associated with tearing mode (TM). The eEGAM\nlocalizes in the core plasma, i.e. in the vicinity of q=2 surface, and is very\ndifferent from one excited by the drift-wave turbulence in the edge plasma. The\nanalysis indicated that the eEGAM is provided with the magnetic components,\nwhose intensities depend on the poloidal angles, and its mode numbers are\njm/nj=2/0. Further, there exist intense nonlinear interactions among eEGAM,\nBAEs and strong tearing modes (TMs). These new findings shed light on the\nunderlying physics mechanism for the excitation of the low frequency (LF)\nAlfv\\'enic and acoustic uctuations.\n", "  This work investigates the validity of the generalized second law of\nthermodynamics in modified f(R) Horava-Lifshitz gravity proposed by Chaichian\net al (2010) [Class. Quantum Grav. 27 (2010) 185021], which is invariant under\nfoliation-preserving diffeomorphisms. It has been observed that the equation of\nstate parameter behaves like quintessence (w > -1). We study the thermodynamics\nof the apparent, event and particle horizons in this modified gravity. We\nobserve that under this gravity, the time derivative of total entropy stays at\npositive level and hence the generalized second law is validated.\n", "  The origin of the bulk of cosmic rays (CRs) observed at Earth is the topic of\na century long investigation, paved with successes and failures. From the\nenergetic point of view, supernova remnants (SNRs) remain the most plausible\nsources of CRs up to rigidity ? 10^6-10^7 GV. This confidence somehow resulted\nin the construction of a paradigm, the so-called SNR paradigm: CRs are\naccelerated through diffusive shock acceleration in SNRs and propagate\ndiffusively in the Galaxy in an energy dependent way. Qualitative confirmation\nof the SNR acceleration scenario has recently been provided by gamma ray and\nX-ray observations. Diffusive propagation in the Galaxy is probed\nobservationally through measurement of the secondary to primary nuclei flux\nratios (such as B/C). There are however some weak points in the paradigm, which\nsuggest that we are probably missing some physical ingredients in our models.\nThe theory of diffusive shock acceleration at SNR shocks predicts spectra of\naccelerated particles which are systematically too hard compared with the ones\ninferred from gamma ray observations. Moreover, hard injection spectra\nindirectly imply a steep energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the\nGalaxy, which in turn leads to anisotropy larger than the observed one.\nMoreover recent measurements of the flux of nuclei suggest that the spectra\nhave a break at rigidity ? 200 GV, which does not sit well with the common\nwisdom in acceleration and propagation. In this paper I will review these new\ndevelopments and suggest some possible implications.\n", "  A frequency-stabilized ultraviolet laser system, locked to the thallium\nresonant transition of 377.5 nm, was demonstrated using a novel bichromatic\nspectroscopy technique for tuning the zero-crossing laser-lock point. The\natomic thallium system is a promising candidate in atomic parity violation and\npermanent electric dipole moment experiments, and its 377.5 nm 6P1/2->7S1/2\ntransition is important for thallium laser cooling and trapping experiment. The\npressure shift, owing to the high pressure buffer gas of the hollow-cathode\nlamp, was observed using an atomic beam resonance as reference. Such a shift\nwas corrected by adjusting the peak ratio of the two Doppler-free saturation\nprofiles resulted from two pumping beams with a 130 MHz frequency difference.\nThe resulted frequency stability of the ultraviolet laser is ?0.5 MHz at 0.1\nsec integration time. This scheme is compact and versatile for stabilizing UV\nlaser systems, which acquire a sub-MHz stability and frequency tunability.\n", "  We explore the Potts model on the generalized decorated square lattice, with\nboth nearest (J1) and next-neighbor (J2) interactions. Using the tensor\nrenormalization-group method augmented by higher-order singular value\ndecompositions, we calculate the spontaneous magnetization of the Potts model\nwith q = 2, 3, and 4. The results for q = 2 allow us to benchmark our numerics\nusing the exact solution. For q = 3, we find a highly degenerate ground state\nwith partial order on a single sublattice, but with vanishing entropy per site,\nand we obtain the phase diagram as a function of the ratio J2=J1. There is no\nfinite-temperature transition for the q = 4 case when J1 = J2, but the magnetic\nsusceptibility diverges as the temperature goes to zero, showing that the model\nis critical at T = 0.\n", "  Multi-frequency power maps of the local acoustic oscillations show acoustic\nenhancements (\\acoustic-power halos\") at high frequencies surrounding large\nactive region. Computational seismic holography reveals a high-frequency\n\\acoustic-emission halo\", or \\seismic glory\" surrounding large active regions.\nIn this study, we have applied computational seismic holography to map the\nseismic seismic source density surrounding AR 11429. Studies of HMI/SDO Doppler\ndata, shows that the \"acoustic halos\" and the \"seismic glories\" are prominent\nat high frequencies 5-8 mHz. We investigate morphological properties of\nacoustic-power and acoustic emission halos around an active region to see if\nthey are spatially correlated. Details about the local magnetic field from\nvectormagnetograms of AR 11429 are included. We identify a 15\" region of\nseismic deficit power (dark moat) shielding the white-light boundary of the\nactive region. The size of the seismic moat is related to region of\nintermediate magnetic field strength. The acoustic moat is circled by the halo\nof enhanced seismic amplitude as well as enhanced seismic emission. Overall,\nthe results suggest that features are related. However, if we narrow the\nfrequency band to 5.5-6.5 mHz, we find that the seismic source density\ndominates over the local acoustic power, suggesting the existence of sources\nthat emit more energy downward into the solar interior than upward toward the\nsolar surface.\n", "  Context.Within the sequential accretion scenario of planet formation, planets\nare build up through a sequence sticking collisions. The outcome of collisions\nbetween porous dust aggregates is very important for the growth from very small\ndust particles to planetesimals. In this work we determine the necessary\nmaterial properties of dust aggregates as a function the porosity.\n  Aims: Continuum models such as SPH that are capable of simulating collisions\nof macroscopic dust aggregates require a set of material parameters. Some of\nthem such as the tensile and shear strength are difficult to obtain from\nlaboratory experiments. The aim of this work is to determine these parameters\nfrom ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations.\n  Methods: We simulate the behavior of porous dust aggregates using a detailed\nmicro-physical model of the interaction of spherical grains that includes\nadhesion forces, rolling, twisting, and sliding. Using different methods of\npreparing the samples we study the strength behavior of our samples with\nvarying porosity and coordination number of the material.\n  Results: For the tensile strength, we can reproduce data from laboratory\nexperiments very well. For the shear strength, there are no experimental data\navailable. The results from our simulations differ significantly from previous\ntheoretical models, which indicates that the latter might not be sufficient to\ndescribe porous dust aggregates.\n  Conclusions: We have provided functional behavior of tensile and shear\nstrength of porous dust aggregates as a function of the porosity that can be\ndirectly applied in continuum simulations of these objects in planet formation\nscenarios.\n", "  We have discovered two molecular features at radial velocities of -35 km/s\nand 0 km/s toward the infrared Double Helix Nebula (DHN) in the Galactic center\nwith NANTEN2. The two features show good spatial correspondence with the DHN.\nWe have also found two elongated molecular ridges at these two velocities\ndistributed vertically to the Galactic plane over 0.8 degree. The two ridges\nare linked by broad features in velocity and are likely connected physically\nwith each other. The ratio between the 12CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 transitions is 0.8\nin the ridges which is larger than the average value 0.5 in the foreground gas,\nsuggesting the two ridges are in the Galactic center. An examination of the K\nband extinction reveals a good coincidence with the CO 0 km/s ridge and is\nconsistent with a distance of 8 +/-2 kpc. We discuss the possibility that the\nDHN was created by a magnetic phenomenon incorporating torsional Alfv\\'en waves\nlaunched from the circumnuclear disk (Morris, Uchida & Do 2006) and present a\nfirst estimate of the mass and energy involved in the DHN.\n", "  Unfolding problems often arise in the context of statistical data analysis.\nSuch problematics occur when the probability distribution of a physical\nquantity is to be measured, but it is randomized (smeared) by some well\nunderstood process, such as a non-ideal detector response or a well described\nphysical phenomenon. In such case it is said that the original probability\ndistribution of interest is folded by a known response function. The\nreconstruction of the original probability distribution from the measured one\nis called unfolding. That technically involves evaluation of the non-bounded\ninverse of an integral operator over the space of L^1 functions, which is known\nto be an ill-posed problem. For the pertinent regularized operator inversion,\nwe propose a linear iterative formula and provide proof of convergence in a\nprobability theory context. Furthermore, we provide formulae for error\nestimates at finite iteration stopping order which are of utmost importance in\npractical applications: the approximation error, the propagated statistical\nerror, and the propagated systematic error can be quantified. The arguments are\nbased on the Riesz-Thorin theorem mapping the original L^1 problem to L^2\nspace, and subsequent application of ordinary L^2 spectral theory of operators.\nA library implementation in C of the algorithm along with corresponding error\npropagation is also provided. A numerical example also illustrates the method\nin operation.\n", "  We present a two dimensional model of hydrodynamic interaction between a\ncircular swimmer and a circular post at low Reynolds number, using a point\nsingularity description of the swimming activity. We derive a nonlinear\ndynamical system fully describing the motion and discuss the generic features\nof the phase portrait and typical trajectories for a variety of squirmer modes.\nContractile swimmers exhibit stable bound orbits arising from the contrasting\nnature of monopolar and dipolar squirmer modes, which are robust with respect\nto swimmer size and the inclusion of higher squirmer modes. The behaviour of\nextensile swimmers is related through time reversal and their orbits are\nunstable, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.\n", "  We initiate the study of stability of solutions of the 2D inviscid\nincompressible porous medium equation (IPM). We begin by classifying all\nstationary solutions of the inviscid IPM under mild conditions. We then prove\nsome linear stability results. We then study solutions of the IPM equation\nwhich are sufficiently regular perturbations of linearly stable steady states.\nWe prove that sufficiently regular perturbations which are also small must be\nglobally regular and strongly converge to a steady state. The mechanism behind\nthe stability is \\emph{stratification} as opposed to previous stability results\nbased on dispersion and/or mixing \\cite{BedrossianMasmoudi}. More or less, we\nprove that stratified stationary solutions which do not go against gravity are\nasymptotically stable.\n", "  We introduce an accurate and efficient method for a class of nonlocal\npotential evaluations with free boundary condition, including the 3D/2D\nCoulomb, 2D Poisson and 3D dipolar potentials. Our method is based on a\nGaussian-sum approximation of the singular convolution kernel and Taylor\nexpansion of the density. Starting from the convolution formulation, for smooth\nand fast decaying densities, we make a full use of the Fourier pseudospectral\n(plane wave) approximation of the density and a separable Gaussian-sum\napproximation of the kernel in an interval where the singularity (the origin)\nis excluded. Hence, the potential is separated into a regular integral and a\nnear-field singular correction integral, where the first integral is computed\nwith the Fourier pseudospectral method and the latter singular one can be well\nresolved utilizing a low-order Taylor expansion of the density. Both\nevaluations can be accelerated by fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The new method\nis accurate (14-16 digits), efficient ($O(N \\log N)$ complexity), low in\nstorage, easily adaptable to other different kernels, applicable for\nanisotropic densities and highly parallelable.\n", "  We provide a unified ultraproduct approach for constructing Wick words in\nmixed $q$-Gaussian algebras, which are generated by $s_j=a_j+a_j^*$,\n$j=1,\\cdots,N$, where $a_ia^*_j - q_{ij}a^*_ja_i =\\delta_{ij}$. Here we also\nallow equality in $-1\\le q_{ij}=q_{ji}\\le 1$. Using the ultraproduct method, we\nconstruct an approximate co-multiplication of the mixed $q$-Gaussian algebras.\nBased on this we prove that these algebras are weakly amenable and strongly\nsolid in the sense of Ozawa and Popa. We also encode Speicher's central limit\ntheorem in the unified ultraproduct method, and show that the\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck semigroup is hypercontractive, the Riesz transform\nassociated to the number operator is bounded, and the number operator satisfies\nthe $L_p$ Poincar\\'e inequalities with constants $C\\sqrt{p}$.\n", "  The reconstruction algorithm introduced by \\cite{Eis07}, which is widely used\nin clustering analysis, is based on the inference of the first order Lagrangian\ndisplacement field from the Gaussian smoothed galaxy density field in redshift\nspace. The \\modif2{smoothing scale} applied to the density field affects the\ninferred displacement field that is used to move {the galaxies}, and partially\n\\modif2{erases} the nonlinear evolution {of the density field}.\n  In this article, we explore this crucial step \\modif2{in} the reconstruction\nalgorithm. We study the performance of the reconstruction technique using two\nmetrics: first, we study the performance using the anisotropic clustering,\nextending previous studies focused on isotropic clustering; second, we study\nits effect on the displacement field. We find that smoothing has a strong\neffect in the quadrupole of the correlation function and affects the accuracy\nand precision \\modif2{with} which we can measure $D_A (z)$ and $H(z)$. We find\nthat the optimal smoothing scale to use in the reconstruction algorithm applied\nto BOSS-CMASS is between 5-10 $h^{-1}$Mpc. Varying from the \"usual\"\n15$h^{-1}$Mpc to $5 h^{-1}$Mpc \\modif2{shows} $\\sim$ 0.3\\% variations in\n$D_A(z)$ and $\\sim$ 0.4\\% $H(z)$ and uncertainties are also reduced by 40\\% and\n30\\% respectively. We also find that the accuracy of velocity field\nreconstruction depends strongly on the smoothing scale used for the density\nfield. We measure the bias and uncertainties associated with different choices\nof smoothing length.\n", "  We present new IRAM 30m spectroscopic observations of the $\\sim88$ GHz band,\nincluding emission from the CCH (n=1-0) multiplet, HCN (1-0), HCO+ (1-0), and\nHNC (1-0), for a sample of 58 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared\ngalaxies from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). By combining\nour new IRAM data with literature data and Spitzer/IRS spectroscopy, we study\nthe correspondence between these putative tracers of dense gas and the relative\ncontribution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation to the\nmid-infrared luminosity of each system. We find the HCN (1-0) emission to be\nenhanced in AGN-dominated systems ($\\langle$L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+\n(1-0)}\\rangle=1.84$), compared to composite and starburst-dominated systems\n($\\langle$L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+ (1-0)}\\rangle=1.14$, and 0.88,\nrespectively). However, some composite and starburst systems have L'$_{HCN\n(1-0)}$/L'$_{HCO^+ (1-0)}$ ratios comparable to those of AGN, indicating that\nenhanced HCN emission is not uniquely associated with energetically dominant\nAGN. After removing AGN-dominated systems from the sample, we find a linear\nrelationship (within the uncertainties) between $\\log_{10}$(L'$_{HCN (1-0)}$)\nand $\\log_{10}$(L$_{IR}$), consistent with most previous findings. L'$_{HCN\n(1-0)}$/L$_{IR}$, typically interpreted as the dense gas depletion time,\nappears to have no systematic trend with L$_{IR}$ for our sample of luminous\nand ultraluminous infrared galaxies, and has significant scatter. The\ngalaxy-integrated HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) emission do not appear to have a\nsimple interpretation, in terms of the AGN dominance or the star formation\nrate, and are likely determined by multiple processes, including density and\nradiative effects.\n", "  We study the quasinormal modes of scalar field perturbations in the\nbackground of non-Abelian hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We find\nthat the quasinormal frequencies have no real part so there is no oscillatory\nbehavior in the perturbations, only exponential decay, that is, the system is\nalways overdamped, which guarantees the mode stability of non-Abelian\nhyperscaling violating Lifshitz black holes. We determine analytically the\nquasinormal modes for massless scalar fields for a dynamical exponent $z=2$ and\nhyperscaling violating exponent $\\tilde{\\theta}>-2$. Also, we obtain\nnumerically the quasinormal frequencies for different values of the dynamical\nexponent and the hyperscaling violating exponent by using the improved\nasymptotic iteration method.\n", "  Recent molecular dynamics simulations show that thermal gradients can induce\nelectric fields in water that are comparable in magnitude to electric fields\nseen in ionic thin films and biomembranes. This surprising non-equilibrium\nphenomenon of thermomolecular orientation is also observed more generally in\nsimulations of polar and non-polar size-asymmetric dumbbell fluids. However, a\nmicroscopic theory linking thermomolecular orientation and polarization to\nmolecular properties is yet unknown. Here, we formulate an analytically\nsolvable microscopic model of size-asymmetric dumbbell molecules in a\ntemperature gradient using a mean-field, local equilibrium approach. Our theory\nreveals the relationship between the extent of thermomolecular orientation and\npolarization, and molecular volume, size anisotropy and dipole moment.\nPredictions of the theory agree quantitatively with molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Crucially, our framework shows how thermomolecular orientation can\nbe controlled and maximized by tuning microscopic molecular properties.\n", "  This book provides an introduction to the field of star formation at a level\nsuitable for graduate students or advanced undergraduates in astronomy or\nphysics. The structure of the book is as follows. The first two chapters begin\nwith a discussion of observational techniques, and the basic phenomenology they\nreveal. The goal is to familiarize students with the basic techniques that will\nbe used throughout, and to provide a common vocabulary for the rest of the\nbook. The next five chapters provide a similar review of the basic physical\nprocesses that are important for star formation. Again, the goal is to provide\na basis for what follows. The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a\nvariety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the\nscales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief\ndiscussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation. The\nbook includes five problem sets, complete with solutions.\n", "  The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is currently\none of the most widely used instruments for observing exoplanetary atmospheres,\nespecially with the use of the spatial scanning technique. An increasing number\nof exoplanets have been studied using this technique as it enables the\nobservation of bright targets without saturating the sensitive detectors. In\nthis work we present a new pipeline for analyzing the data obtained with the\nspatial scanning technique, starting from the raw data provided by the\ninstrument. In addition to commonly used correction techniques, we take into\naccount the geometric distortions of the instrument, whose impact may become\nimportant when combined to the scanning process. Our approach can improve the\nphotometric precision for existing data and also push further the limits of the\nspatial scanning technique, as it allows the analysis of even longer spatial\nscans. As an application of our method and pipeline, we present the results\nfrom a reanalysis of the spatially scanned transit spectrum of HD 209458 b. We\ncalculate the transit depth per wavelength channel with an average relative\nuncertainty of 40 ppm. We interpret the final spectrum with T-Rex, our fully\nBayesian spectral retrieval code, which confirms the presence of water vapor\nand clouds in the atmosphere of HD 209458 b. The narrow wavelength range limits\nour ability to disentangle the degeneracies between the fitted atmospheric\nparameters. Additional data over a broader spectral range are needed to address\nthis issue.\n", "  The China Dark Matter Experiment (CDEX) is a low background experiment at\nChina Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) designed to directly detect dark\nmatter with a high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detector. In the second phase\nCDEX-10 with a 10 kg Germanium array detector system, the liquid argon (LAr)\nanti-compton active shielding and cooling system is proposed. For purpose of\nstudying the properties of LAr detector, a prototype with an active volume of 7\nliters of liquid argon was built and operated. The photoelectron yields, as a\ncritically important parameter for the prototype detector, have been measured\nto be 0.051-0.079 p.e./keV for 662 keV Gamma lines at different positions. The\ngood agreement between the experimental and simulation results has provided a\nquite reasonable understanding and determination of the important parameters\nsuch as the Surviving Fraction of the Ar2 excimers, the absorption length for\n128 nm photons in liquid argon, the reflectivity of Teflon and so on.\n", "  We have measured the electrical resistivity of cerium monochalcogenices, CeS,\nCeSe, and CeTe, under high pressures up to 8 GPa. Pressure dependences of the\nantiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_{N}$, crystal field splitting, and\nthe $\\ln T$ anomaly of the Kondo effect have been studied to cover the whole\nregion from the magnetic ordering regime at low pressure to the Fermi liquid\nregime at high pressure. $T_{N}$ initially increases with increasing pressure,\nand starts to decrease at high pressure as expected from the Doniach's diagram.\nSimultaneously, the $\\ln T$ behavior in the resistivity is enhanced, indicating\nthe enhancement of the Kondo effect by pressure. It is also characteristic in\nCeX$_{c}$ that the crystal field splitting rapidly decreases at a common rate\nof $-12.2$ K/GPa. This leads to the increase in the degeneracy of the $f$ state\nand further enhancement of the Kondo effect. It is shown that the pressure\ndependent degeneracy of the $f$ state is a key factor to understand the\npressure dependence of $T_{N}$, Kondo effect, magnetoresistance, and the peak\nstructure in the temperature dependence of resistivity.\n", "  We apply ray-optical methods to dielectric optical microcavities in the shape\nof triangles made of low refractive index material. We find ray trajectories\nthat maximize the intensity inside the cavity to determine the far-field\nemission characteristics and to complement the concept of the unstable manifold\napplicable to chaotic microlasers. As these maximum intensity trajectories need\nnot to be periodic, we suggest that they provide a more general explanation for\nemission patterns of microlasers than short periodic orbits. Further, the\ngeometrical optics description is extended by the inclusion of intensity\namplification along the optical path to achieve a better description of active,\nlasing cavities. Far-field emission patterns of equilateral triangle cavities\nobtained in this way agree well with our full electromagnetic wave simulations\nand with previously reported experimental results.\n", "  Recent experiments with dilute trapped Fermi gases observed that weak\ninteractions can drastically modify spin transport dynamics and give rise to\nrobust collective effects including global demagnetization, macroscopic spin\nwaves, spin segregation, and spin self-rephasing. In this work we develop a\nframework for studying the dynamics of weakly interacting fermionic gases\nfollowing a spin-dependent change of the trapping potential which illuminates\nthe interplay between spin, motion, Fermi statistics, and interactions. The key\nidea is the projection of the state of the system onto a set of lattice spin\nmodels defined on the single-particle mode space. Collective phenomena,\nincluding the global spreading of quantum correlations in real space, arise as\na consequence of the long-ranged character of the spin model couplings. This\napproach achieves good agreement with prior measurements and suggests a number\nof directions for future experiments.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall effect was first predicted in graphene. However, the weak\nspin orbit interaction in graphene meant that the search for quantum spin Hall\neffect in graphene never fructified. In this work we show how to generate the\nquantum spin-valley Hall effect in graphene via quantum pumping by\nadiabatically modulating a magnetic impurity and an electrostatic potential in\na monolayer of strained graphene. We see that not only exclusive spin polarized\ncurrents can be pumped in the two valleys in exactly opposite directions but\none can have pure spin currents flowing in opposite directions in the two\nvalleys, we call this novel phenomena the quantum spin-valley Hall effect. This\nmeans that the twin effects of quantum valley Hall and quantum spin Hall can\nboth be probed simultaneously in the proposed device. This work will\nsignificantly advance the field of graphene spintronics, hitherto hobbled by\nthe lack of spin-orbit interaction. We obviate the need for any spin orbit\ninteraction and show how graphene can be manipulated to posses features\nexclusive to topological insulators.\n", "  Using the helicity-spinor language we explore the non-perturbative\nconstraints that Lorentz symmetry imposes on three-point amplitudes where the\nasymptotic states can be massive. As it is well known, in the case of only\nmassless states the three-point amplitude is fixed up to a coupling constant by\nthese constraints plus some physical requirements. We find that a similar\nstatement can be made when some of the particles have mass. We derive the\ngeneric functional form of the three-point amplitude by virtue of Lorentz\nsymmetry, which displays several functional structures accompanied by arbitrary\nconstants. These constants can be related to the coupling constants of the\ntheory, but in an unambiguous fashion only in the case of one massive particle.\nConstraints on these constants are obtained by imposing that in the UV limit\nthe massive amplitude matches the massless one. In particular, there is a\ncertain Lorentz frame, which corresponds to projecting all the massive momenta\nalong the same null momentum, where the three-point massive amplitude is fully\nfixed, and has a universal form.\n", "  We suggest an all-optical scheme for the storage, retrieval and processing of\na single-photon wave packet through its off-resonant Raman interaction with a\nseries of coherent control beams. These control beams, each with distinct\ncarrier frequency, are distributed along the way of single-photon propagation,\nthus effectively forming a gradient absorption structure which can be\ncontrolled in various ways to achieve different single-photon processing\nfunctionalities. Such a controllable frequency comb is a hybrid of Raman,\ngradient echo memory (GEM) and atomic frequency comb (AFC) methods, therefore\ndemonstrates many of their advantages all together in one.\n", "  Multi-terminal superconducting Josephson junctions based on the proximity\neffect offer the bright opportunity to tailor non trivial quantum states in\nnanoscale weak-links. These structures can realize exotic topologies in\nmultidimensions as, for example, artificial topological superconductors able to\nsupport Majorana bound states, and pave the way to emerging quantum\ntechnologies and future quantum information schemes. Here, we report the first\nrealization of a three-terminal Josephson interferometer based on a proximized\nnanosized weak-link. Our tunneling spectroscopy measurements reveal transitions\nbetween gapped (i.e., insulating) and gapless (i.e., conducting) states, those\nbeing controlled by the phase configuration of the three superconducting leads\nconnected to the junction. We demonstrate the $topological$ nature of these\ntransitions: a gapless state necessarily occurs between two gapped states of\ndifferent topological index, very much like the interface between two\ninsulators of different topology is necessarily conducting. The topological\nnumbers characterizing such gapped states are given by superconducting phase\nwindings over the two loops forming the Josephson interferometer. Since these\ngapped states cannot be transformed to one another continuously withouth\npassing through a gapless condition, these are topologically $protected$. Our\nobservation of the gapless state is pivotal for enabling phase engineering of\nmore sophisticated artificial topological materials realizing Weyl points or\nthe anomalous Josephson effect.\n", "  We provide evidence that spin ferroquadrupolar (FQ) order is the likely\nground state in the nonmagnetic nematic phase of stoichiometric FeSe. By\nstudying the variational mean-field phase diagram of a bilinear-biquadratic\nHeisenberg model up to the 2nd nearest neighbor, we find the FQ phase in close\nproximity to the columnar antiferromagnet commonly realized in iron-based\nsuperconductors; the stability of FQ phase is further verified by the density\nmatrix renormalization group. The dynamical spin structure factor in the FQ\nstate is calculated with flavor-wave theory, which yields a qualitatively\nconsistent result with inelastic neutron scattering experiments on FeSe at both\nlow and high energies. We verify that FQ can coexist with $C_4$ breaking\nenvironments in the mean-field calculation, and further discuss the possibility\nthat quantum fluctuations in FQ act as a source of nematicity.\n", "  We compute analytically the weak (anti)localization correction to the Drude\nconductivity for electrons in tubular semiconductor systems of zinc blende\ntype. We include linear Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\ncompare wires of standard growth directions $\\langle100\\rangle$,\n$\\langle111\\rangle$, and $\\langle110\\rangle$. The motion on the\nquasi-two-dimensional surface is considered diffusive in both directions:\ntransversal as well as along the cylinder axis. It is shown that Dresselhaus\nand Rashba SOC similarly affect the spin relaxation rates. For the\n$\\langle110\\rangle$ growth direction, the long-lived spin states are of helical\nnature. We detect a crossover from weak localization to weak anti-localization\ndepending on spin-orbit coupling strength as well as dephasing and scattering\nrate. The theory is fitted to experimental data of an undoped\n$\\langle111\\rangle$ InAs nanowire device which exhibits a top-gate-controlled\ncrossover from positive to negative magnetoconductivity. Thereby, we extract\ntransport parameters where we quantify the distinct types of SOC individually.\n", "  Trapped inflation is a mechanism in which particle production from the moving\ninflaton is the main source of friction in the inflaton equation of motion. The\nproduced fields source inflaton perturbations, which dominate over the vacuum\nones. We employ the set of equations for the inflaton zero mode and its\nperturbations which was developed in the original work on trapped inflation,\nand which we extend to second order in the perturbations. We build on this\nstudy by updating the experimental constraints, and by replacing the existing\napproximate solutions with more accurate ones. We obtain a different numerical\nvalue for the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum, and a parametrically\ndifferent result for the bispectrum. This has implications for the allowed\nregion of parameter space in models of trapped inflation, and for some of the\nphenomenological results obtained in this region. The main results in the\nallowed region are the following: monomial inflaton potentials, such as $V\n\\propto \\varphi ,\\, \\varphi^2$ can be compatible with the data, and (in a\nportion of the allowed region) the inflaton can be sub-Planckian over all the\n\"observable\" stage of inflation; gravitational waves from this mechanism are\ntoo small to be observed in the foreseeable future; a non-gaussianity parameter\n$-60 < f_{\\rm NL} < -20 $ is obtained in the allowed region for exactly\nequilateral configurations, with a mild dependence on the parameters of the\nmodel and of the inflaton potential.\n", "  Nowadays, many extrasolar planetary systems possessing at least one planet on\na highly eccentric orbit have been discovered. In this work, we study the\npossible long-term stability of such systems. We consider the general three\nbody problem as our model. Highly eccentric orbits are out of the Hill\nstability regions. However, mean motion resonances can provide phase protection\nand orbits with long-term stability exist. We construct maps of dynamical\nstability based on the computation of chaotic indicators and we figure out\nregions in phase space, where the long-term stability is guaranteed. We focus\non regions where at least one planet is highly eccentric and attempt to\nassociate them with the existence of stable periodic orbits. The values of the\norbital elements, which are derived from observational data, are often given\nwith very large deviations. Generally, phase space regions of high\neccentricities are narrow and thus, our dynamical analysis may restrict\nconsiderably the valid domain of the system's location.\n", "  In a paper by Ashtekar and Campiglia, invariance under volume preserving\nresidual diffeomorphisms has been used to single out the standard\nrepresentation of the reduced holonomy-flux algebra in homogeneous loop quantum\ncosmology (LQC). In this paper, we use invariance under all residual\ndiffeomorphisms to single out the standard kinematical Hilbert space of\nhomogeneous isotropic LQC for both the standard configuration space\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$, as well as for the Fleischhack one $\\mathbb{R}\n\\sqcup \\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$. We first determine the scale invariant\nRadon measures on these spaces, and then show that the Haar measure on\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$ is the only such measure for which the momentum\noperator is hermitian w.r.t. the corresponding inner product. In particular,\nthe measure is forced to be identically zero on $\\mathbb{R}$ in the Fleischhack\ncase, so that for both approaches, the standard kinematical LQC-Hilbert space\nis singled out.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear parity-time (PT) symmetric coupler from a\ndynamical perspective. As opposed to linear PT-coupler where the PT threshold\ndictates the evolutionary characteristics of optical power in the two\nwaveguides, in a nonlinear coupler, the PT threshold governs the existence of\nstationary points. We have found that the stability of the ground state\nundergoes a phase transition when the gain/loss coefficient is increased from\nzero to beyond the PT threshold. Moreover, we found that instabilities in\ninitial conditions can lead to aperiodic oscillations as well as exponential\ngrowth and decay of optical power. At the PT threshold, we observed the\nexistence of a stable attractor under the influence of fluctuating gain/loss\ncoefficient. Phase plane analysis has shown us the presence of a toroidal\nchaotic attractor. The chaotic dynamics can be controlled by a judicious choice\nof the waveguide parameters.\n", "  Thermal conductivity and interfacial thermal conductance play crucial roles\nin the design of engineering systems where temperature and thermal stress are\nof concerns. To date, a variety of measurement techniques are available for\nboth bulk and thin film solid-state materials with a broad temperature range.\nFor thermal characterization of bulk material, the steady-state absolute\nmethod, laser flash diffusivity method, and transient plane source method are\nmost used. For thin film measurement, the 3{\\omega} method and transient\nthermoreflectance technique including both frequency-domain and time-domain\nanalysis are employed widely. This work reviews several most commonly used\nmeasurement techniques. In general, it is a very challenging task to determine\nthermal conductivity and interface contact resistance with less than 5% error.\nSelecting a specific measurement technique to characterize thermal properties\nneed to be based on: 1) knowledge on the sample whose thermophysical properties\nis to be determined, including the sample geometry and size, and preparation\nmethod; 2) understanding of fundamentals and procedures of the testing\ntechnique and equipment, for example, some techniques are limited to samples\nwith specific geometrics and some are limited to specific range of\nthermophysical properties; 3) understanding of the potential error sources\nwhich might affect the final results, for example, the convection and radiation\nheat losses.\n", "  The inner crust of neutron stars is supposed to be inhomogeneous and composed\nof dense structures (clusters) that are immersed in a dilute gas of unbound\nneutrons. Here we consider spherical clusters forming a BCC crystal and\ncylindrical rods arranged in a hexagonal lattice. We study the relative motion\nof these dense structures and the neutron gas using superfluid hydrodynamics.\nWithin this approach, which relies on the assumption that Cooper pairs are\nsmall compared to the crystalline structures, we find that the entrainment of\nneutrons by the clusters is very weak since neutrons of the gas can flow\nthrough the clusters. Consequently, we obtain a low effective mass of the\nclusters and a superfluid density that is even higher than the density of\nunbound neutrons. Consequences for the constraints from glitch observations are\ndiscussed.\n", "  By applying loop quantum gravity techniques to 3D gravity with a positive\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$, we show how the local gauge symmetry of the\ntheory, encoded in the constraint algebra, acquires the quantum group structure\nof $so_q(4)$, with $ q = \\exp{(i\\hbar \\sqrt{\\Lambda}/2\\kappa)}$. By means of an\nInonu-Wigner contraction of the quantum group bi-algebra, keeping $\\kappa$\nfinite, we obtain the kappa-Poincar\\'e algebra of the flat quantum space-time\nsymmetries.\n", "  Many phases of matter, including superconductors, fractional quantum Hall\nfluids and spin liquids, are described by gauge theories with constrained\nHilbert spaces. However, thermalization and the applicability of quantum\nstatistical mechanics has primarily been studied in unconstrained Hilbert\nspaces. In this article, we investigate whether constrained Hilbert spaces\npermit local thermalization. Specifically, we explore whether the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds in a pinned Fibonacci anyon chain, which\nserves as a representative case study. We first establish that the constrained\nHilbert space admits a notion of locality, by showing that the influence of a\nmeasurement decays exponentially in space. This suggests that the constraints\nare no impediment to thermalization. We then provide numerical evidence that\nETH holds for the diagonal and off-diagonal matrix elements of various local\nobservables in a generic disorder-free non-integrable model. We also find that\ncertain non-local observables obey ETH.\n", "  The change in Holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) for small fluctuations\nabout pure AdS is given by a perturbative expansion of the area functional in\nterms of the change in the bulk metric and the embedded extremal surface.\nHowever it is known that change in the embedding appear at second order or\nhigher. In this paper we show that these changes in the embedding can be\nsystematically calculated in the 2+1 dimensional case by accounting for the\ndeviation of the spacelike geodesics between a spacetime and perturbations over\nit. Here we consider rotating BTZ as perturbation over $AdS_3$ and study\ndeviations of spacelike geodesics in them. We argue that these deviations arise\nnaturally as solutions of a \"generalized geodesic deviation equation\". Using\nthis we perturbatively calculate the changes in HEE upto second order, for\nrotating BTZ. This expression matches with the small system size expansion of\nthe change in HEE obtained by HRT (Hubeny, Rangamani and Takayanagi) proposal\nfor rotating BTZ. We also write an alternative form of entanglement first law\nfor rotating BTZ. To do this one needs to go beyond the leading order in the\nperturbation series discussed above. That's precisely the reason we consider\nfinding a systematic way to calculate it. To put our result on a firm footing\nwe further show that it is this alternative first law that approaches the\nthermal first law in the large subsystem size limit.\n", "  An easily available resource of common crystal structures is essential for\nresearchers, teachers, and students. For many years this was provided by the\nU.S. Naval Research Laboratory's $Crystal\\ Lattice\\ Structures$ web page, which\ncontained nearly 300 crystal structures, including a majority of those which\nwere given $Strukturbericht$ designations. This article presents the updated\nversion of the database, now including 288 standardized structures in 92 space\ngroups. Similar to what was available on the web page before, we present a\ncomplete description of each structure, including the formulas for the\nprimitive vectors, all of the basis vectors, and the AFLOW commands to generate\nthe standardied cells. We also present a brief discussion of crystal systems,\nspace groups, primitive and conventional lattices, Wyckoff positions, Pearson\nsymbols and $Strukturbericht$ designations.\n", "  We employ magnetized plasma turbulence, described by a gyrokinetic formalism\nin an interval ranging from the end of the fluid scales to the electron\ngyroradius, to introduce the first study of kinetic intermittency, in which\nnonlinear structures formed directly in the distribution functions are analyzed\nby accounting for velocity space correlations generated by linear (Landau\nresonance) and nonlinear phase mixing. Electron structures are found to be\nstrongly intermittent and dominated by linear phase mixing, while nonlinear\nphase mixing dominates the weakly intermittent ions. This is the first time\nspatial intermittency and linear phase mixing are shown to be self-consistently\nlinked for the electrons and, as the magnetic field follows the intermittency\nof the electrons at small scales, explain why magnetic islands are places\ndominated by Landau damping in steady state turbulence.\n", "  We study the equivalence between the recently proposed finite environment\nquantum jump model and a master equation approach. We derive microscopically\nthe master equation for a qubit coupled to a finite bosonic environment and\nshow that the master equation is equivalent with the finite environment quantum\njump model. We analytically show that both the methods produce the same moments\nof work when the work is defined through the two-measurement protocol excluding\nthe interaction energy. However, when compared to the work moments computed\nusing the power operator approach, we find a difference in the form of the work\nmoments. To numerically verify our results, we study a qubit coupled to an\nenvironment consisting of ten two-level systems.\n", "  In chameleon gravity, there exists a light scalar field that couples to the\ntrace of the stress-energy tensor in such a way that its mass depends on the\nambient matter density, and the field is screened in local, high-density\nenvironments. Recently it was shown that, for the runaway potentials commonly\nconsidered in chameleon theories, the field's coupling to matter and the\nhierarchy of scales between Standard Model particles and the energy scale of\nsuch potentials result in catastrophic effects in the early Universe when these\nparticles become nonrelativistic. Perturbations with trans-Planckian energies\nare excited, and the theory suffers a breakdown in calculability at the\nrelatively low temperatures of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We consider a\nchameleon field in a quartic potential and show that the scale-free nature of\nthis potential allows the chameleon to avoid many of the problems encountered\nby runaway potentials. Following inflation, the chameleon field oscillates\naround the minimum of its effective potential, and rapid changes in its\neffective mass excite perturbations via quantum particle production. The\nquartic model, however, only generates high-energy perturbations at comparably\nhigh temperatures and is able remain a well-behaved effective field theory at\nnucleosynthesis.\n", "  We present generalized evolution equations and factorization in terms of the\ntruncated Mellin moments (TMM) of the parton distributions and structure\nfunctions. We illustrate the $x$ and $Q^2$ dependence of TMM in the polarized\ncase. Using the TMM approach we compare the integrals of $g_1$ with HERMES and\nCOMPASS data from the limited $x$-ranges.\n", "  The luminosity determination for the ATLAS detector at the LHC during pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV in 2012 is presented. The evaluation of the\nluminosity scale is performed using several luminometers, and comparisons\nbetween these luminosity detectors are made to assess the accuracy, consistency\nand long-term stability of the results. A luminosity uncertainty of dL/L = +/-\n1.9% is obtained for the 22.7 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data delivered to ATLAS\nat $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV in 2012.\n", "  The $I(J^P)={1\\over 2}({1\\over 2}^-)$, ${1\\over 2}({3\\over 2}^-)$, and\n${1\\over 2}({5\\over 2}^-)$ $uudc\\overline{c}$ pentaquarks are investigated by\nthe quark cluster model. This model, which reproduces the mass spectra of the\ncolor-singlet $S$-wave $q^3$ baryons and $q\\overline{q}$ mesons, also enables\nus to evaluate the quark interaction in the color-octet $uud$ configurations.\nIt is shown that the color-octet isospin-${1\\over 2}$ spin-${3\\over 2}$ $uud$\nconfiguration gains attraction. The $uudc\\overline{c}$ states with this\nconfiguration have structures around the $\\Sigma_c{}^{(*)}\\overline{D}{}^{(*)}$\nthresholds: one bound state, two resonances, and one large cusp are found. We\nargue that the negative parity pentaquark found by the LHCb experiments may be\ngiven by these structures.\n", "  Lattice vibrations in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ are strongly interacting, with\ndouble well instabilities present at the Brillouin zone boundary. Analysis\nwithin a first-principles lattice dynamics framework reveals anharmonic\npotentials with short phonon quasi-particle lifetimes and mean-free paths. The\nphonon behaviour is distinct from the inorganic semiconductors GaAs and CdTe\nwhere three-phonon interaction strengths are three orders of magnitude smaller.\nThe implications for the applications of hybrid halide perovskites arising from\nthermal conductivity, band-gap deformation, and charge-carrier scattering\nthrough electron-phonon coupling, are presented.\n", "  Axions may make a significant contribution to the dark matter of the\nuniverse. It has been suggested that these dark matter axions may condense into\nlocalized clumps, called \"axion stars.\" In this paper we argue that collisions\nof dilute axion stars with neutron stars, of the type known as \"magnetars,\" may\nbe the origin of most of the observed fast radio bursts. This idea is a\nvariation of an idea originally proposed by Iwazaki. However, instead of the\nsurface effect of Iwazaki, we propose a perhaps stronger volume effect caused\nby the induced time dependent electric dipole moment of neutrons.\n", "  The bouncing of an inelastic ball on a vibrating plate is a popular model\nused in various fields, from granular gases to nanometer-sized mechanical\ncontacts. For random plate motion, so far, the model has been studied using\nPoincar{\\'e} maps in which the excitation by the plate at successive bounces is\nassumed to be a discrete Markovian (memoryless) process. Here, we investigate\nnumerically the behaviour of the model for continuous random excitations with\ntunable correlation time. We show that the system dynamics are controlled by\nthe ratio of the Markovian mean flight time of the ball and the mean time\nbetween successive peaks in the motion of the exciting plate. When this ratio,\nwhich depends on the bandwidth of the excitation signal, exceeds a certain\nvalue, the Markovian approach is appropriate; below, memory of preceding\nexcitations arises, leading to a significant decrease of the jump duration; at\nthe smallest values of the ratio, chattering occurs. Overall, our results open\nthe way for uses of the model in the low excitation regime, which is still\npoorly understood.\n", "  The spontaneous formation of double helices for filaments under torsion is\ncommon and significant. For example, the research on the supercoiling of DNA is\nhelpful for understanding the replication and transcription of DNA. Similar\ndouble helices can appear in polymer chains, carbon nanotube yarns, cables,\ntelephone wires and so forth. We noticed that non-uniform double helices can be\nproduced due to the surface friction induced by the self-contact. Therefore an\nideal model was presented to investigate the formation of double helices for\nelastic rods under torque. A general equilibrium condition which is valid for\nboth the smooth surface and the rough surface situations is derived by using\nthe variational method. Based on this, by adding further constraints, the\nsmooth and rough surface situations are investigated in detail respectively.\nAdditionally, the model showed that the specific process of how to twist and\nslack the rod can determine the surface friction and hence influence the\nconfiguration of the double helix formed by rods with rough surfaces. Based on\nthis principle, a method of manufacturing double helices with designed\nconfigurations was proposed and demonstrated. Finally, experiments were\nperformed to verify the model and the results agreed well with the theory.\n", "  The detection of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrino sources would contribute\nsignificantly to solving the decades-old mystery of the origin of the\nhighest-energy cosmic rays. We investigate the ability of a future UHE neutrino\ndetector to identify the brightest neutrino point sources, by exploring the\nparameter space of the total number of observed events and the angular\nresolution of the detector. The favored parameter region can be translated to\nrequirements for the effective area, sky coverage and angular resolution of\nfuture detectors, for a given source number density and evolution history.\nMoreover, by studying the typical distance to sources that are expected to emit\nmore than one event for a given diffuse neutrino flux, we find that a\nsignificant fraction of the identifiable UHE neutrino sources may be located in\nthe nearby Universe if the source number density is above $\\sim10^{-6}\\,\\rm\nMpc^{-3}$. If sources are powerful and rare enough, as predicted in blazar\nscenarios, they can first be detected at distant locations. Our result also\nsuggests that if UHE cosmic-ray accelerators are neither beamed nor transients,\nit will be possible to associate the detected UHE neutrino sources with nearby\nUHE cosmic-ray and gamma-ray sources, and that they may also be observed using\nother messengers, including ones with limited horizons such as TeV gamma rays,\nUHE gamma rays and cosmic rays. We find that for a $\\gtrsim5\\sigma$ detection\nof UHE neutrino sources with a uniform density,\n$n_s\\sim{10}^{-7}-{10}^{-5}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$, at least $\\sim100-1000$ events and\nsub-degree angular resolution are needed, and the results depend on the source\nevolution model.\n", "  It has been known that the binary replica liquid theory (RLT) is inconsistent\nwith its one-component counterpart; In the limit that all atoms are identical,\nthe configurational entropy and thus the glass transition point calculated by\nthe binary RLT differ from those obtained by the one-component RLT. More\nspecifically, an extra composition-dependent term, or the mixing entropy,\nremains finite in the configurational entropy computed by the binary RLT. In\nthis Short Note, we reformulate the RLT in order to resolve this problem.\n", "  We propose a novel coupled dark energy model which is assumed to occur as a\nq-deformed scalar field and investigate whether it will provide an expanding\nuniverse phase. We consider the q-deformed dark energy as coupled to dark\nmatter inhomogeneities. We perform the phase-space analysis of the model by\nnumerical methods and find the late-time accelerated attractor solutions. The\nattractor solutions imply that the coupled q-deformed dark energy model is\nconsistent with the conventional dark energy models satisfying an acceleration\nphase of universe. At the end, we compare the cosmological parameters of\ndeformed and standard dark energy models and interpret the implications.\n", "  We observe new Feshbach resonances in ultracold mixtures of $^{85}$Rb and\n$^{87}$Rb atoms in the $^{85}$Rb$|2, +2\\rangle$+$^{87}$Rb$|1, +1\\rangle$ and\n$^{85}$Rb$|2, -2\\rangle$+$^{87}$Rb$|1, -1\\rangle$ scattering channels. The\npositions and properties of the resonances are predicted and characterized\nusing the semi-analytic multichannel quantum-defect theory by Gao. Of\nparticular interest, a number of broad entrance-channel dominated p-wave\nresonances are identified, implicating exciting opportunities for studying a\nvariety of p-wave interaction dominated physics.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations are at the forefront of advances in Physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Increasing accuracy in measurements of the neutrino mixing\nmatrix is an important challenge in current experiments. It depends on\nparameters that do not directly correspond to observables of the neutrino\nsystem. This type of estimation problem is handled by Quantum Estimation Theory\n(QET) via the Fisher Information (FI) and the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI).\nIn this work, we analyze two-flavor neutrino oscillations within the framework\nof QET. We compute the QFI for the mixing angle $\\theta$ and show that mass\nmeasurements are the ones that achieve optimal precision. We also study the FI\nassociated with flavor measurements and show that they are optimized at\nspecific neutrino times-of-flight. Therefore, although the usual population\nmeasurement does not realize the precision limit set by the QFI, it can in\nprinciple be implemented with the best possible sensitivity to $\\theta $. We\nstudy how these quantifiers relate to the single-particle, mode entanglement.\nWe demonstrate that this form of entanglement does not enhance neither of them.\nIn particular, this shows that in single-particle settings, entanglement is not\ndirectly connected with the optimal precision in metrological tasks.\n", "  We found that a network-organized metapopulation of cooperators, defectors\nand destructive agents playing the public goods game with mutations, can\ncollectively reach global synchronization or chimera states. Global\nsynchronization is accompanied by a collective periodic burst of cooperation,\nwhereas chimera states reflect the tendency of the networked metapopulation to\nbe fragmented in clusters of synchronous and incoherent bursts of cooperation.\nNumerical simulations have shown that the system's dynamics alternates between\nthese two steady states through a first order transition. Depending on the\nparameters determining the dynamical and topological properties, chimera states\nwith different numbers of coherent and incoherent clusters are observed. Our\nresults present the first systematic study of chimera states and their\ncharacterization in the context of evolutionary game theory. This provides a\nvaluable insight into the details of their occurrence, extending the relevance\nof such states to natural and social systems.\n", "  We consider a spinor quintom dark energy model with intrinsic spin, in the\nframework of Eintein- Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory. After constructing the\nmathematical formalism of the model, we obtain the spin contributed total\nenergy-momentum tensor giving the energy density and the pressure of the\nquintom model, and then we find the equation of state parameter in terms of the\nspinor potential. Choosing suitable potentials leads to the quintom scenario\ncrossing between quintessence and phantom epochs, or vice versa. Analyzed three\nquintom scenarios provides stable expansion phases avoiding Big Rip\nsingularities, and yielding matter dominated era through the stabilization of\nthe spinor pressure via spin contribution. The stabilization in spinor pressure\nleads to neglecting it as compared to the increasing energy density, and\nconstituting a matter dominated stable expansion epoch.\n", "  Recently, a model of modified gravity plus single scalar field model was\nproposed, in which the scalar couples both to the standard Riemannian volume\nform given by the square root of the determinant of the Riemannian metric, as\nwell as to another non-Riemannian volume form given in terms of an auxiliary\nmaximal rank antisymmetric tensor gauge field. This model provides an exact\nunified description of both dark energy (via dynamically generated cosmological\nconstant) and dark matter (as a \"dust\" fluid due to a hidden nonlinear Noether\nsymmetry).\n  In this paper we test the model against Supernovae type Ia experimental data\nand investigate the future Universe evolution which follows from it. Our\nresults show that this model has very interesting features allowing various\nscenarios of Universe evolution and in the same time perfectly fits\ncontemporary observational data. It can describe exponentially expanding or\nfinite expanding Universe and moreover, a Universe with phase transition of\nfirst kind. The phase transition occurs to a new, emerging at some time ground\nstate with lower energy density, which affects significantly the Universe\nevolution.\n", "  Albert Einstein's General Relativity (GR) from 1916 has become the widely\naccepted theory of gravity and been tested observationally to a very high\nprecision at different scales of energy and distance. At the same time, there\nstill remain important questions to resolve. At the classical level\ncosmological and black hole singularities are examples of problems which let us\nnotice that GR is incomplete at short distances (high energy). Furthermore, at\nthe quantum level GR is not ultraviolet (UV) complete, namely it is not\nperturbatively renormalizable. Most of the work try to solve these problems\nmodifying GR by considering finite higher order derivative terms. Fourth\nDerivative Gravity, for example, turns out to be renormalizable, but at the\nsame time it introduces ghost. To avoid both UV divergence and presence of\nghost one could consider sets of infinite higher derivative terms that can be\nexpressed in the form of entire functions satisfying the special property do\nnot introduce new poles other than GR graviton one. By making a special choice\nfor these entire functions, one could show that such a theory describes a\ngravity that, at least in the linear regime, can avoid both the presence of\nghost and classical singularities (both black hole and cosmological\nsingularities). In this master's thesis we review some of these aspects\nregarding gravitational interaction, focusing more on the classical level. Most\nof the calculations are done in detail and an extended treatment of the\nformalism of the spin projector operators is presented.\n", "  In the present work, we propose $Y(4140)$ as the $\\chi_{c1}(3P)$ state by\nstudying the $\\chi_{c1} \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ invariant mass spectrum of the $B\\to K\n\\chi_{c1} \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ process. In the $D\\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectrum of\nthe $B\\to K D\\bar{D}$ process, we find a new resonance with the mass and width\nto be $ (4083.0 \\pm 5.0) $ and $ (24.1 \\pm 15.4) $ MeV, respectively, which\ncould be a good candidate of the $\\chi_{c0}(3P)$ state. The theoretical\ninvestigations on the decay behaviors of the $\\chi_{cJ}(3P)$ in the present\nwork support the assignments of the $Y(4140)$ and $Y(4080)$ as the\n$\\chi_{c1}(3P)$ and $\\chi_{c0}(3P)$ states, respectively. In addition, the\n$\\chi_{c2}(3P)$ state is predicted to be a very narrow state. The results in\nthe present work could be tested by further experiments in the LHCb and\nforthcoming Belle II.\n", "  Structural properties of SmRu$_4$P$_{12}$ in the anomalous magnetic ordered\nphase between $T^*\\sim 14 $ K and $T_{\\text{N}}=16.5$ K in magnetic fields has\nbeen studied by x-ray diffraction. Atomic displacements of Ru and P, reflecting\nthe field-induced charge order of the $p$ electrons, have been deduced by\nanalyzing the intensities of the forbidden Bragg peaks, assuming a cubic space\ngroup $Pm\\bar{3}$. Also, by utilizing high-resolution x-ray diffraction\nexperiment, we observed a splitting of fundamental Bragg peaks, clarifying that\nthe unit cell in the magnetic ordered phase is rhombohedral elongated along the\n$[1\\, 1\\, 1]$ axis. Responses of the rhombohedral domains to the magnetic\nfield, which reflects the direction of the magnetic moment, is studied in\ndetail.\n", "  The dynamic localization of a two-level atom in a periodic potential under\nthe action of spin-orbit coupling and a weak harmonically-varying linear force\nis studied. We consider optical and Zeeman potentials that are either in-phase\nor out-of-phase in two spinor components, respectively. The expectation value\nfor the position of the atom after one oscillation period of the linear force\nis recovered in authentic resonances or in pseudo-resonances. The frequencies\nof the linear force corresponding to authentic resonances are determined by the\nband structure of the periodic potential and are affected by the spin-orbit\ncoupling. The width/dispersion of the wavepacket in authentic resonances is\nusually minimal. The frequencies corresponding to pseudo-resonances do not\ndepend on the type of potential and on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling,\nwhile the evolution of excitations at the corresponding frequencies is usually\naccompanied by significant dispersion. Pseudo-resonances are determined by the\ninitial phase of the linear force and by the quasi-momentum of the wavepacket.\nDue to the spinor nature of the system, the motion of the atom is accompanied\nby periodic, but not harmonic, spin oscillations. Under the action of\nspin-orbit coupling the oscillations of the wavepacket can be nearly completely\nsuppressed in optical lattices. Dynamic localization in Zeeman lattices is\ncharacterized by doubling of the resonant oscillation periods due to band\ncrossing at the boundary of the Brillouin zone. We also show that higher\nharmonics in the Fourier expansion of the energy band lead to effective\ndispersion, which can be strong enough to prevent dynamic localization of the\nBloch wavepacket.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a methodology that allows to model behavioral\ntrajectories of users in online social media. First, we illustrate how to\nleverage the probabilistic framework provided by Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to\nrepresent users by embedding the temporal sequences of actions they performed\nonline. We then derive a model-based distance between trained HMMs, and we use\nspectral clustering to find homogeneous clusters of users showing similar\nbehavioral trajectories. To provide platform-agnostic results, we apply the\nproposed approach to two different online social media --- i.e. Facebook and\nYouTube. We conclude discussing merits and limitations of our approach as well\nas future and promising research directions.\n", "  Photon echo-based quantum memories demonstrated in rare-earth doped solids\nover the last decade have solved the major constraint of population inversion\nin conventional photon echoes by using collective atom phase controls. Both\natomic frequency comb and gradient echoes have also made a breakthrough in\nhigher echo efficiency, where conventional photon echo efficiency remains at a\nfew per cent. Here we review, analyze, and discuss the collective atom phase\ncontrol applied to conventional photon echoes for quantum memory applications\nto clarify fundamental physics of coherent transients in a three-level system\nspecifically for optical-spin coherence conversion in a controlled double\nrephasing echoes. Some critical misunderstandings in various protocols are also\nanalyzed, and corrected for near unity echo efficiency under no population\ninversion.\n", "  It is known that the cross product of gradients of two scalars, the Euler\npotentials (EP), may represent magnetic fields lines. We examine the utility of\nsuch potential in the broader magneto-genesis and dynamo theories, and find\nthat a reinterpretation of the potentials offer a new understanding of the role\nEP may play in the evolution of magnetic fields.\n", "  I develop a transfer matrix algorithm for computing the exact partition\nfunction of a square lattice polymer with nearest-neighbor interaction, by\nextending a previous algorithm for computing the total number of self-avoiding\nwalks. The computation time scales as ~1.6^N with the chain length N, in\ncontrast to the explicit enumeration where the scaling is ~ 2.7^N. The exact\npartition function can be obtained faster with the transfer matrix method than\nwith the explicit enumeration, for N>25. The new results for up to N=42 are\npresented.\n", "  Nearly 70 Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) of cosmic rays have been recorded\nby the worldwide neutron monitor network since the 1950s depicting a big\nvariety of energy spectra of solar energetic particles (SEP). Here we studied a\nstatistical relation between the event-integrated intensity of GLEs (calculated\nas count-rate relative excess, averaged over all available polar neutron\nmonitors, and expressed in percent-hours) and the hardness of the solar\nparticle energy spectra. For each event the integral omnidirectional\nevent-integrated fluences of particles with energy above 30 MeV ($F_{30}$) and\nabove 200 MeV ($F_{200}$) were computed using the reconstructed spectra, and\nthe ratio between the two fluences was considered as a simple index of the\nevent's hardness. We also provided a justification of the spectrum estimate in\nthe form of the Band-function, using direct PAMELA data for GLE 71\n(17-May-2012). We found that, while there is no clear relation between the\nintensity and the hardness for weak events, all strong events with the\nintensity greater 100 \\%*hr are characterized by a very hard spectrum. This\nimplies that a hard spectrum can be securely assumed for all extreme GLE\nevents, e.g., those studied using cosmogenic isotope data in the past.\n", "  We consider a manifestly Lorentz invariant form $\\mathbb L$ of the\nbiquaternion algebra and its generalization to the case of curved manifold. The\nconditions of $\\mathbb L$-differentiability of $\\mathbb L$-functions are\nformulated and considered as the primary equations for fundamental fields\nmodeled with such functions. The exact form of the effective affine connection\ninduced by $\\mathbb L$-differentiability equations is obtained for the flat and\ncurved cases. In the flat case, the integrability conditions of the latter lead\nto the self-duality of the corresponding curvature, thus ensuring that the\nsource-free Maxwell and $SL(2,\\mathbb C)$ Yang-Mills equations hold on the\nsolutions of the $\\mathbb L$-differentiability equations\n", "  Transport phenomena in parallel coupled scatterers are studied by transfer\nmatrix formulism. We derive a simple recurrence relation for transfer matrix of\none-dimensional two-terminal systems consisting of $N$ arbitrary scattering\nunit cells connected in parallel. For identical scattering sub-units we find\nthat the effects of parallel connection on transport properties of the coupled\nsystem can be described by a similarity transformation on the single scatterer,\nwith the similar matrix determined by the scattering matrix of the junction.\nWhile for distinct single scatterers, the similar matrices depend on both\nscattering properties of individual elements and structure of connection\ntopologies.\n", "  We study the scattering properties of $N$ identical one-dimensional localized\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric potentials, connected in series as well as in\nparallel. We derive a general transfer matrix formalism for parallel coupled\nquantum scatterers, and apply that theory to demonstrate that the spectral\nsingularities and $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric transitions of single scattering\ncells may be observed in coupled systems, at the same or distinct values of the\ncritical parameters, depending on the connection modes under which the\nscattering objects are coupled. We analyse the influences of the connection\nconfiguration on the related transport properties such as spectral\nsingularities and anisotropic transmission resonances.\n", "  This paper gives a method that maps the static magnetic field due to a system\nof parallel current-carrying wires to a complex function. Using this function\nsimplifies the calculation of the magnetic field energy density and inductance\nper length in the wires, and we reproduce well-known results for this case.\n", "  In this work, we consider a STU black-hole model containing eight magnetic\nand eight electric charges ((8+8)-signature). We show that such model admits an\nextremal black holes solution in which (8+8)-signature can be associated with\nthe entropy via the Cayley's hyperdeterminant.\n", "  Based on General Relativity (GR) we consider two different cosmological\nscenarios in where reconstruct the energy exchange (Q) between cold dark matter\n(DM) fluid and dark energy (DE) fluid, which is modelled with a DE varying\nequation of state (EoS) parameter {\\omega}. We here investigate the main\ncosmological effects on the growth rate of matter density perturbations\n(f{\\sigma}8), on the effective Hubble friction term (Heff ), on the effective\nNewton constant (Geff ) and on the growth index of the linear matter\nfluctuations ({\\gamma}). Our study demonstrates that in the coupled models the\nevolution of these quantities are modified with respect to the predictions in\nthe uncoupled models, and therefore could be used to distinguish among coupled\nDE scenarios. Finally, we also perform a combined statistical analysis using\ncurrent observational data (geometric and dynamical probes) to put more\nstringent constraints on the parameters space of the cosmic scenarios studied.\n", "  In this chapter we review the contributions of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to\nthe study of quantum correlations, including its capabilities to prepare\ninitial states, generate unitary transformations, and characterize the final\nstate. These are the three main demands to implement quantum information\nprocessing in a physical system, which NMR offers, nearly to perfection, though\nfor a small number of qubits. Our main discussion will concern liquid samples\nat room temperature.\n", "  In this paper, three different materials Si, ITO and graphene; and three\ndifferent types of mode structures bulk, slot and hybrid; based on their\nelectrooptical and electro absorptive aspects in performance are analyzed. The\nstudy focuses on three major characteristics of electrooptic tuning, i.e.\nmaterial, modal and cavity dependency. The materials are characterized with\nestablished models and the allowed ranges for their key parameter spectra are\nanalyzed with desired tuning in mind; categorizing into n and k dominant\nregions for plausible electrooptic and electro absorptive applications,\nrespectively. A semi analytic approach, with the aid of FEM simulations for the\neigenmode calculations, was used for this work. Electrooptic tuning i.e.\nresonance shift properties inside Fabry Perot cavities are investigated with\nmodal and scaling concerns in mind. Tuning changes the effective complex\nrefractive index of the mode dictated by the Kramers Kronig relations which\nsubsequently suggest a tradeoff between the resonance shift and increasing\nlosses. The electrical tuning properties of the different modes in the cavity\nare analyzed, and subsequently a figure of merit, delta-lambda/delta-alpha was\nchosen with respect to carrier concentration and cavity scaling to find\nprospective suitable regions for desired tuning effects.\n", "  This work presents a new procedure to extract features of grey-level texture\nimages based on the discrete Schroedinger transform. This is a non-linear\ntransform where the image is mapped as the initial probability distribution of\na wave function and such distribution evolves in time following the\nSchroedinger equation from Quantum Mechanics. The features are provided by\nstatistical moments of the distribution measured at different times. The\nproposed method is applied to the classification of three databases of textures\nused for benchmark and compared to other well-known texture descriptors in the\nliterature, such as textons, local binary patterns, multifractals, among\nothers. All of them are outperformed by the proposed method in terms of\npercentage of images correctly classified. The proposal is also applied to the\nidentification of plant species using scanned images of leaves and again it\noutperforms other texture methods. A test with images affected by Gaussian and\n\"salt \\& pepper\" noise is also carried out, also with the best performance\nachieved by the Schroedinger descriptors.\n", "  Recent renewal of the highest transition temperature in a conventional\nsuperconductor of the sulfer hydride attracts much attention to exploring\nsimple compounds with the lighter elements, situated in unconventional\nconditions. We report the discovery of superconductivity in simple oxides of\nTi4O7 and g-Ti3O5 in a thin-film form having deliberately tuned epitaxial\nstructures and off-stoichiometry. These higher titanium oxides join in a class\nof simple-oxide superconductors, and g-Ti3O5 now holds the highest\nsuperconducting transition temperature of 7.1 kelvin among them. The mechanism\nbehind the superconductivity is discussed on the basis of electrical\nmeasurements and theoretical predictions. We conclude that superconductivity\narises from unstabilized bipolaronic insulating states.\n", "  Diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) nanostructures are promising platform to\nmodulate carriers and spins for new information devices. Here we report that\nthe high quality pure CH3NH3PbBr3 nanorods and Mn doped CH3NH3PbBr3 nanorods\nhave been prepared by solution method and in which the exciton magnetic\npolarons (EMP) formed in Mn doped NRs, and a single mode lasing phenomenon from\ncollective EMP in single NR have been detected when excited by fs pulse laser.\nThis finding helps to understand the exciton and spin interactions and pave\nways to the realization of new type of bosonic laser.\n", "  The dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) is the production of photons by the\namplification of vacuum fluctuations. In this paper we demonstrate new\nresonance conditions in DCE that potentially allow the production of optical\nphotons when the mechanical frequency is smaller than the lowest frequency of\nthe cavity field. We consider a cavity with one mirror fixed and the other\nallowed to oscillate. In order to identify the region where production of\nphotons takes place, we do a linear stability analysis and investigate the\ndynamic stability of the system under small fluctuations. By using a numerical\nsolution of the Heisenberg equations of motion, the time evolution of the\nnumber of photons produced in the unstable region is studied.\n", "  This paper presents high-order (HO) electromagnetic modeling of plasmonic\nnanostructures based on the Locally Corrected Nystrom (LCN) method. Advanced\nnanophotonic and nanoplasmonic structures involve electrically large\nelectromagnetic structures that are very complex in both geometry and material\ncomposition. Hence, advanced analysis and design tools are required in order to\npredict the performance of such structures and optimize the geometrical\nparameters prior to costly prototype development. In this perspective, the LCN\nis exploited to solve the electromagnetic scattering of plasmonic\nnanostructures. The LCN utilizes basis functions of higher orders defined on\nlarge geometrical elements, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns\nfor a given problem. Compared to other well-known methods for EM modeling of\nplasmonic nanostructures, the LCN is computationally efficient, straightforward\nto implement and provides exponential convergence. A full comparison, in terms\nof time and complexity between the proposed method and previous works for a few\n3D nanoplasmonic structures are presented to validate the accuracy, efficiency\nand flexibility of the proposed method to simulate the behavior of\nelectromagnetic fields in real nanoplasmonic problems.\n", "  We present early results from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT)\nonboard the ASTROSAT observatory. We report the discovery of a hot companion\nassociated with one of the blue straggler stars (BSSs) in the old open cluster,\nNGC188. Using fluxes measured in four filters in UVIT's Far-UV (FUV) channel,\nand two filters in the near-UV (NUV) channel, we have constructed the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the star WOCS-5885, after combining with flux\nmeasurements from GALEX, UIT, UVOT, SPITZER, WISE and several ground-based\nfacilities. The resulting SED spans a wavelength range of 0.15~${\\mu}$m to\n7.8~${\\mu}$m. This object is found to be one of the brightest FUV sources in\nthe cluster. An analysis of the SED reveals the presence of two components. The\ncooler component is found to have a temperature of 6,000$\\pm$150~K, confirming\nthat it is a BSS. Assuming it to be a main-sequence star, we estimate its mass\nto be $\\sim$ 1.1 - 1.2M$_\\odot$. The hotter component, with an estimated\ntemperature of 17,000$\\pm$500~K, has a radius of $\\sim$ 0.6R$_\\odot$ and L\n$\\sim$ 30L$_\\odot$. Bigger and more luminous than a white dwarf, yet cooler\nthan a sub-dwarf, we speculate that it is a post-AGB/HB star that has recently\ntransferred its mass to the BSS, which is known to be a rapid rotator. This\nbinary system, which is the first BSS with a post-AGB/HB companion identified\nin an open cluster, is an ideal laboratory to study the process of BSS\nformation via mass transfer.\n", "  Axelrod's model of cultural dissemination, despite its apparent simplicity,\ndemonstrates complex behavior that has been of much interest in statistical\nphysics. Despite the many variations and extensions of the model that have been\ninvestigated, a systematic investigation of the effects of changing the size of\nthe neighborhood on the lattice in which interactions can occur has not been\nmade. Here we investigate the effect of varying the radius R of the von Neumann\nneighborhood in which agents can interact. We show, in addition to the\nwell-known phase transition at the critical value of q, the number of traits,\nanother phase transition at a critical value of R, and draw a q -- R phase\ndiagram for the Axelrod model on a square lattice. In addition, we present a\nmean-field approximation of the model in which behavior on an infinite lattice\ncan be analyzed.\n", "  City traffic is a dynamic system of enormous complexity. Modeling and\npredicting city traffic flow remains to be a challenge task and the main\ndifficulties are how to specify the supply and demands and how to parameterize\nthe model. In this paper we attempt to solve these problems with the help of\nlarge amount of floating car data. We propose a coarse-grained cellular\nautomata model that simulates vehicles moving on uniform grids whose size are\nmuch larger compared with the microscopic cellular automata model. The car-car\ninteraction in the microscopic model is replaced by the coupling between\nvehicles and coarse-grained state variables in our model. To parameterize the\nmodel, flux-occupancy relations are fitted from the historical data at every\ngrids, which serve as the coarse-grained fundamental diagrams coupling the\noccupancy and speed. To evaluate the model, we feed it with the historical\ntravel demands and trajectories obtained from the floating car data and use the\nmodel to predict road speed one hour into the future. Numerical results show\nthat our model can capture the traffic flow pattern of the entire city and make\nreasonable predictions. The current work can be considered a prototype for a\nmodel-based forecasting system for city traffic.\n", "  In this review, we discuss whether the present solar dynamo models can be\nextrapolated to explain various aspects of stellar activity. We begin with a\nsummary of the following kinds of data for solar-like stars: (i) data\npertaining to stellar cycles from Ca H/K emission over many years; (ii) X-ray\ndata indicating hot coronal activity; (iii) starspot data (especially about\ngiant polar spots); and (iv) data pertaining to stellar superflares. Then we\ndescribe the current status of solar dynamo modelling---giving an introduction\nto the flux transport dynamo model, the currently favoured model for the solar\ncycle. While an extrapolation of this model to solar-like stars can explain\nsome aspects of observational data, some other aspects of the data still remain\nto be theoretically explained. It is not clear right now whether we need a\ndifferent kind of dynamo mechanism for stars having giant starspots or\nproducing very strong superflares.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum of photons is an intriguing system for the storage\nand transmission of quantum information, but it is rapidly degraded by\natmospheric turbulence. We explore the ability of adaptive optics to compensate\nfor this disturbance by measuring and correcting cumulative phase shifts in the\nwavefront. These shifts can be represented as a sum of Zernike functions; we\nanalyze the residual errors after correcting up to a certain number of Zernike\nmodes when an orbital angular momentum state is transmitted through a turbulent\natmosphere whose density fluctuations have a Kolmogorov spectrum. We\napproximate the superoperator map that represents these residual errors and\nfind the solution in closed form. We illustrate with numerical examples how\nthis perturbation depends on the the number of Zernike modes corrected and the\norbital angular momentum state of the light.\n", "  Propagation of optical vortex beamlet (OVB) in turbulent atmospheric\nenvironment is studied theoretically by normalized models. Our simulation shows\nthat optical vortex beamlet is superior to traditional Gaussian beam in terms\nof diffraction behavior of long haul propagation. Formation of vortex beam let\nis experimentally demonstrated by using a spatial light modulator (SLM), which\nachieve a power efficiency of more than 90% when the intrinsic loss in SLM is\nexcluded.\n", "  In this paper, we present a formalism designed to model tidal interaction\nwith a viscoelastic body made of Maxwell material. Our approach remains regular\nfor any spin rate and orientation, and for any orbital configuration including\nhigh eccentricities and close encounters. The method is to integrate\nsimultaneously the rotation and the position of the planet as well as its\ndeformation. We provide the equations of motion both in the body frame and in\nthe inertial frame. With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the\nspatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from\nquantum theory. We also provide the vectorial expression of the secular tidal\ntorque expanded in Fourier series. Applying this model to close-in exoplanets,\nwe observe that if the relaxation time is longer than the revolution period,\nthe phase space of the system is characterized by the presence of several\nspin-orbit resonances, even in the circular case. As the system evolves, the\nplanet spin can visit different spin-orbit configurations. The obliquity is\ndecreasing along most of these resonances, but we observe a case where the\nplanet tilt is instead growing. These conclusions derived from the secular\ntorque are successfully tested with numerical integrations of the instantaneous\nequations of motion on HD 80606b. Our formalism is also well adapted to\nclose-in super-Earths in multiplanet systems which are known to have non-zero\nmutual inclinations.\n", "  A new mechanism of nuclear excitation via two-photon electron transitions\n(NETP) is proposed and studied theoretically. As a generic example, detailed\ncalculations are performed for the $E1E1$ $1s2s\\,^1S_0 \\rightarrow 1s^2\\,^1S_0$\ntwo-photon decay of He-like $^{225}$Ac$^{87+}$ ion with the resonant excitation\nof the $3/2+$ nuclear state with the energy 40.09(5) keV. The probability for\nsuch a two-photon decay via the nuclear excitation is found to be $P_{\\rm NETP}\n= 3.5 \\times 10^{-9}$ and, thus, is comparable with other mechanisms, such as\nnuclear excitation by electron transition and by electron capture. The\npossibility for the experimental observation of the proposed mechanism is\nthoroughly discussed.\n", "  The dynamics of tripartite entanglement of fermionic system in noninertial\nframes through linear contraction criterion when one or two observers are\naccelerated is investigated. In one observer accelerated case the entanglement\nmeasurement is not invariant with respect to the partial realignment of\ndifferent subsystems and for two observers accelerated case it is invariant. It\nis shown that the acceleration of the frame does not generate entanglement in\nany bipartite subsystems. Unlike the bipartite states, the genuine tripartite\nentanglement does not completely vanish in both one observer accelerated and\ntwo observers accelerated cases even in the limit of infinite acceleration. The\ndegradation of tripartite entanglement is fast when two observers are\naccelerated than when one observer is accelerated. It is shown that tripartite\nentanglement is a better resource for quantum information processing than the\nbipartite entanglement in noninertial frames .\n", "  Clustering plays an important role in the structure of nuclei, especially for\nlight nuclei in the $p$-shell. In nuclear cluster models these degrees of\nfreedom are introduced explicitly. In the Resonating Group Method or in the\nGenerator Coordinate Method the clusters are built from individual nucleons\ninteracting via an effective nucleon-nucleon interaction; the total wave\nfunction is antisymmetrized. Fermionic Molecular Dynamics (FMD) goes beyond\npure cluster models. It is a microscopic many-body approach using a Gaussian\nwave packet basis that includes the harmonic oscillator shell model and\nBrink-type cluster model wave functions as special cases. Clustering is not\nimposed but appears dynamically in the calculations. The importance of\nclustering for the understanding of bound states, resonances and scattering\nstates is illustrated with examples discussing the charge radii of the Neon\nisotopes, the $^3$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^7$Be capture reaction and the cluster\nstates in the $^{12}$C continuum.\n", "  Thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbines and aeroengine combustors falls\nwithin the category of complex systems. They can be described\nphenomenologically using nonlinear stochastic differential equations, which\nconstitute the grounds for output-only model-based system identification. It\nhas been shown recently that one can extract the governing parameters of the\ninstabilities, namely the linear growth rate and the nonlinear component of the\nthermoacoustic feedback, using dynamic pressure time series only. This is\nhighly relevant for practical systems, which cannot be actively controlled due\nto a lack of cost-effective actuators. The thermoacoustic stability is given by\nthe linear growth rate, which results from the combination of the acoustic\ndamping and the coherent feedback from the flame. In this paper, it is shown\nthat it is possible to quantify the acoustic damping of the system, and thus to\nseparate its contribution to the linear growth rate from the one of the flame.\nThis is achieved by post-processing in a simple way simultaneously acquired\nchemiluminescence and acoustic pressure data. It provides an additional\napproach to further unravel from observed time series the key mechanisms\ngoverning the system dynamics. This straightforward method is illustrated here\nusing experimental data from a combustion chamber operated at several linearly\nstable and unstable operating conditions.\n", "  In the present work, a set of ZrO2 thin films have been deposited at 82\ndegree angle of deposition at several substrate rotation speeds and at 0\ndegree. The effect of substrate rotation on optical, structural, morphological\nproperties and residual stress has been studies thoroughly. Refractive index\nestimated from ellipsometric measurement and suitable modeling depicts an\ninteresting decreasing behavior with substrate rotation and has been explained\nin the light of varying columnar structure with substrate rotation. Refractive\nindex of GLAD ZrO2 films varies between and 1.901 to 2.011. Normally deposited\nfilm exhibits refractive index value of 2.178 which is substantially greater\nthan that of GLAD films. Lowering in refractive index of glancing angle\ndeposited films is the attribute of dominant atomic shadowing at glancing\nangles. Further, correlation length which is the representative of surface\ngrain size was obtained from suitable modeling of atomic force microscopy data\nand it exhibits a decreasing trend with substrate rotation. The trend has also\nbeen attributed to the varying columnar microstructure with substrate rotation.\nAll the glancing angle deposited ZrO2 films possess root mean square roughness\nbetween 4.6 and 5.1 nm whereas normally deposited film depicts 1.0 nm rms\nroughness. Dominant atomic shadowing is responsible for high roughness of GLAD\nfilms. Both glancing angle and normally deposited films exhibit preferential\ngrowth of monoclinic phase oriented in different directions. GLAD films also\ndepict a tetragonal peak which has been attributed to the fine nano-crystallite\nsize (~13 nm). Residual stress depicts a great switching from large compressive\nto small tensile as the deposition angle switches from normal to glancing angle\n", "  We study the optimization problem for remote one- and two-qubit state\ncreation via a homogeneous spin-1/2 communication line using the local unitary\ntransformations of the multi-qubit sender and extended receiver. We show that\nthe maximal length of a communication line used for the needed state creation\n(the critical length) increases with an increase in the dimensionality of the\nsender and extended receiver. The model with the sender and extended receiver\nconsisting of up to 10 nodes is used for the one-qubit state creation and we\nconsider two particular states: the almost pure state and the maximally mixed\none. Regarding the two-qubit state creation, we numerically study the\ndependence of the critical length on a particular triad of independent\neigenvalues to be created, the model with four-qubit sender without an extended\nreceiver is used for this purpose.\n", "  Optimization of Lamb modes induced by laser can be achieved by adjusting the\nspatial source distribution to the mode wavelength ($\\lambda$). The\nexcitability of Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) resonances in isotropic plates is\ninvestigated both theoretically and experimentally for axially symmetric\nsources. Optimal parameters and amplitude gains are derived analytically for\nspot and annular sources of either Gaussian or rectangular energy profiles. For\na Gaussian spot source, the optimal radius is found to be $\\lambda_{ZGV}/\\pi$.\nAnnular sources increase the amplitude by at least a factor of 3 compared to\nthe optimal Gaussian source. Rectangular energy profiles provide higher gain\nthan Gaussian ones. These predictions are confirmed by semi-analytical\nsimulation of the thermoelastic generation of Lamb waves, including the effect\nof material attenuation. Experimentally, Gaussian ring sources of controlled\nwidth and radius are produced with an axicon-lens system. Measured optimal\ngeometric parameters obtained for Gaussian and annular beams are in good\nagreement with theoretical predictions. A ZGV resonance amplification factor of\n2.1 is obtained with the Gaussian ring. Such source should facilitate the\ninspection of highly attenuating plates made of low ablation threshold\nmaterials like composites.\n", "  Domain model of confinement, chiral symmetry breaking and hadronization is\nbased on description of QCD vacuum gluon configurations as an ensemble of\nalmost everywhere homogeneous Abelian (anti-)self-dual fields. The ensemble can\nbe explicitly constructed as domain wall network. We shortly overview this\napproach and within this framework discuss the effects of QCD vacuum\npolarization by strong electromagnetic fields. It is stressed that such\npolarization effects can play the role of trigger for deconfinement.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the long-time behavior of solutions for the\nthree dimensional primitive equations of large-scale ocean and atmosphere\ndynamics in an unbounded domain. Since the Sobolev embedding is no longer\ncompact in an unbounded domain, we cannot obtain the asymptotical compactness\nof the semigroup generated by problem (2.4)-(2.6) by the Sobolev compactness\nembedding theorem even if we obtain the existence of an absorbing set in more\nregular phase space. To overcome this difficulty, we first prove the\nasymptotical compactness in a weak phase space of the semigroup generated by\nproblem (2.4)-(2.6) by combining the tail-estimates and the energy methods.\nThanks to the existence of an absorbing set in more regular phase space, we\nestablish the existence of a global attractor of problem (2.4)-(2.6) by virtue\nof Sobolev interpolation inequality.\n", "  For years, the biggest unspeakable in quantum theory has been why quantum\ntheory and what is quantum theory telling us about the world. Recent efforts\nare unveiling a surprisingly simple answer. Here we show that two\ncharacteristic limits of quantum theory, the maximum violations of\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Klyachko-Can-Binicio\\u{g}lu-Shumovsky\ninequalities, are enforced by a simple principle. The effectiveness of this\nprinciple suggests that non-realism is the key that explains why quantum\ntheory.\n", "  We aim to investigate the influence of the eccentricity and inclination\ndamping due to planet-disc interactions on the final configurations of the\nsystems, generalizing previous studies on the combined action of the gas disc\nand planet-planet scattering during the disc phase. Instead of the simplistic\n$K$-prescription, our n-body simulations adopt the damping formulae for\neccentricity and inclination provided by the hydrodynamical simulations of our\ncompanion paper. We follow the evolution of $11000$ numerical experiments of\nthree giant planets in the late stage of the gas disc, exploring different\ninitial configurations, planetary mass ratios and disc masses. The dynamical\nevolutions of the planetary systems are studied along the simulations, with\nemphasis on the resonance captures and inclination-growth mechanisms. Most of\nthe systems are found with small inclinations ($\\le10^{\\circ}$) at the\ndispersal of the disc. Even though many systems enter an inclination-type\nresonance during the migration, the disc usually damps the inclinations on a\nshort timescale. Although the majority of the multiple systems in our results\nare quasi-coplanar, $\\sim5\\%$ of them end up with high mutual inclinations\n($\\ge10^{\\circ}$). Half of these highly mutually inclined systems result from\ntwo- or three-body MMR captures, the other half being produced by orbital\ninstability and/or planet-planet scattering. When considering the long-term\nevolution over $100$ Myr, destabilization of the resonant systems is common,\nand the percentage of highly mutually inclined systems still evolving in\nresonance drops to $30\\%$. Finally, the parameters of the final system\nconfigurations are in very good agreement with the semi-major axis and\neccentricity distributions in the observations, showing that planet-planet\ninteractions during the disc phase could have played an important role in\nsculpting planetary systems.\n", "  The most developed integrated receivers for THz radiation nowadays are based\non Josephson junction SIS devices. In this kind of devices, the highest\nreceivable frequency is determined by the energy gap of the superconducting\nelectrodes and limited to approximately 700 GHz in case of Nb/AlOx/Nb\nmultilayers. We have developed a technology for NbN/AlN/NbN Josephson junctions\non sapphire substrates which allow operation at frequencies above 1 THz. The\ntrilayers are deposited in-situ in a 3-chamber DC-magnetron sputtering system\nat temperatures as high as 775 {\\deg}C. Each layer is reactively sputtered in\nan argon and nitrogen atmosphere. By variation of the partial gas pressures and\ndischarge current of the plasma, optimum deposition conditions for the\ntri-layers were found. So far, gap voltages as high as 5.1 mV at 4.2 K have\nbeen achieved which allows the operation frequency of the JJ devices to exceed\n1 THz.\n", "  The next-generation lepton colliders, such as CEPC, FCC-ee, and ILC will make\nprecision measurement of the Higgs boson properties. We first extract the Higgs\ncoupling precision from Higgs observables at CEPC to illustrate the potential\nof future lepton colliders. Depending on the related event rates, the precision\ncan reach percentage level for most couplings. Then, we try to estimate the new\nphysics scales that can be indirectly probed with Higgs and electroweak\nprecision observables. The Higgs observables, together with the existing\nelectroweak precision observables, can probe new physics up to 10TeV (40TeV for\nthe gluon-related operator $\\mathcal O_g$) at 95% C.L. Including the $Z/W$ mass\nmeasurements and $Z$-pole observables at CEPC further pushes the limit up to\n35TeV. Although $Z$-pole running is originally for the purpose of machine\ncalibration, it can be as important as the Higgs observables for probing the\nnew physics scales indirectly. The indirect probe of new physics scales at\nlepton colliders can mainly cover the energy range to be explored by the\nfollowing hadron colliders of pp (50-100TeV), such as SPPC and FCC-hh.\n", "  In 2013 a new nonlocal symmetry reduction of the well-known AKNS scattering\nproblem was found; it was shown to give rise to a new nonlocal $PT$ symmetric\nand integrable Hamiltonian nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation.\nSubsequently, the inverse scattering transform was constructed for the case of\nrapidly decaying initial data and a family of spatially localized, time\nperiodic one soliton solution were found. In this paper, the inverse scattering\ntransform for the nonlocal NLS equation with nonzero boundary conditions at\ninfinity is presented in the four cases when the data at infinity have constant\namplitudes. The direct and inverse scattering problems are analyzed.\nSpecifically, the direct problem is formulated, the analytic properties of the\neigenfunctions and scattering data and their symmetries are obtained. The\ninverse scattering problem is developed via a left-right Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem in terms of a suitable uniformization variable and the time dependence\nof the scattering data is obtained. This leads to a method to linearize/solve\nthe Cauchy problem. Pure soliton solutions are discussed and explicit 1-soliton\nsolution and two 2-soliton solutions are provided for three of the four\ndifferent cases corresponding to two different signs of nonlinearity and two\ndifferent values of the phase difference between plus and minus infinity. In\nthe one other case there are no solitons.\n", "  We report an experimental study of the influences of the fixed charge and\nbulk ionic concentrations on the conduction of biological ion channels, and we\nconsider the results within the framework of the ionic Coulomb blockade model\nof permeation and selectivity. Voltage clamp recordings were used to\ninvestigate the Na$^+$/Ca$^{2+}$ anomalous mole fraction effect (AMFE)\nexhibited by the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac and its mutants.\nSite-directed mutagenesis was used to study the effect of either increasing or\ndecreasing the fixed charge in their selectivity filters for comparison with\nthe predictions of the Coulomb blockade model. The model was found to describe\nwell some aspects of the experimental (divalent blockade and AMFE) and\nsimulated (discrete multi-ion conduction and occupancy band) phenomena,\nincluding a concentration-dependent shift of the Coulomb staircase. These\nresults substantially extend the understanding of ion channel selectivity and\nmay also be applicable to biomimetic nanopores with charged walls.\n", "  We present a new software framework for simulating lattice field theories. It\nfeatures an intuitive programming interface, while simultaneously achieving\nhigh performance supercomputing, all in one programming language, Nim. With a\nmacro system based on its abstract syntax tree, the language enables us to\ncheck and optimize our code at compile time. It also allows us to code\nintrinsics that map directly to machine instructions, and generates efficient\nnative code. We show how we use Nim's metaprogramming features in our code, and\npresent the current status of the code and future plans.\n", "  Negative thermal expansion (NTE) is unusual but important property for\ncontrol of thermal expansion. In the present study, the chemical modification\nis utilized to engineer controllable thermal expansion in cubic NTE ScF3. A\nbroad window of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE = -1.51 ~ -3.4*10^-6\nK-1, 300-800 K) has been achieved in Sc1-xMxF3 (M = Ti, Al and Ga). The\nlong-range crystallographic structure of (Sc1-xTix)F3 adheres to the cubic\nPm-3m symmetry according to the analysis of high-energy synchrotron X-ray\npowder diffraction. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of synchrotron\nX-ray total scattering was performed to investigate the local lattice\ndistortion. It was found that the weakness of NTE has a close correlation with\nthe local lattice distortion. Based on the coupled rotation model, it is\npresumably that this local distortion might dampen the transverse vibration of\nF atoms and thus reduce NTE. The present work provides a possible reference for\nthe design of controllable NTE in open framework solids.\n", "  Self-assembly of nanoparticles can enable composites with pre-designed\nproperties but remains challenged by reproducing structural diversity of atomic\nand molecular crystals. We combine anisotropic elastic and weakly screened\nelectrostatic interactions to guide both orientational and triclinic positional\nself-ordering of inorganic nanocrystals in a nematic fluid host. The lattice\nperiodicity of these low-symmetry colloidal crystals is more than an order of\nmagnitude larger than the nanoparticle size. Orientations of nanocrystals, as\nwell as crystallographic axes of ensuing triclinic colloidal crystals, are\ncoupled to the uniform alignment direction of the nematic host, which can be\nreadily controlled on large scales. We probe colloidal pair and many-body\ninteractions and demonstrate how triclinic crystals with orientational ordering\nof the semiconductor nanorods emerge from competing long-range elastic and\nelectrostatic forces.\n", "  In this work we investigate doping and temperature dependences of electronic\nstructure of system with strong electronic correlations and strong\nelectron-phonon interaction modeling cuprates in the frameworks of the\nthree-band p-d-Holstein model by a polaronic version of the generalized tight\nbinding (GTB) method. Within this approach the electronic structure is formed\nby polaronic quasiparticles constructed as excitations between initial and\nfinal polaronic multielectron states. Doping and temperature effects are taken\ninto account by occupation numbers of local excited polaronic states and\nvariations in the magnitude of spin-spin correlation functions. Both effects\nare manifested in the reconstruction of band structure, Fermi contours, density\nof states and redistribution of the spectral weight over the Hubbard polaron\nsubbands. Doping leads to transformation of Fermi contour from small hole\npockets around k=(pi/2,pi/2) with inhomogeneous spectral weight distribution at\nsmall hole concentration to large contour around k=(pi,pi) in the overdoped\ncompound as a result of two quantum phase transitions. In the system with\nphonon subsystem and EPI doping results in the top of the valence band\nsplitting off and new polaron subbands appearance. Temperature increasing in\nthe system with doped holes and moderate EPI leads to formation of the flatband\naround k=(pi,pi) and transfer of the spectral weight to the splitted off top of\nthe valence band.\n"]}
