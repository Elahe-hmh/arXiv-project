We reduce this problem to\nfinding a weakly terminal commutative subalgebra of A, and solve the latter for\nvarious C*-algebras, including all commutative ones and all type I von Neumann\nalgebras. This addresses a natural generalization of the Mackey-Piron\nprogramme: which lattices are those of closed subspaces of Hilbert space? We\nalso discuss the way this categorified generalization differs from the original\nquestion.\n", "  We theoretically evaluate establishing remote entanglement between\ndistinguishable matter qubits through interference and detection of two emitted\nphotons. The fidelity of the entanglement operation is analyzed as a function\nof the temporal and frequency mode-matching between the photons emitted from\neach quantum memory. With a general analysis, we define limits on the absolute\nmagnitudes of temporal and frequency mode-mismatches in order to maintain\nentanglement fidelities greater than 99% with two-photon detection efficiencies\ngreater than 90%. We apply our analysis to several selected systems of quantum\nmemories. Results indicate that high fidelities may be achieved in each system\nusing current experimental techniques, while maintaining acceptable rates of\nentanglement. Thus, it might be possible to use two-photon-mediated\nentanglement operations between distinguishable quantum memories to establish a\nnetwork for quantum communication and distributed quantum computation.\n", "  Within thunderstorms electrons can gain energies of up to hundred(s) of MeV.\nThese electrons can create X-rays and gamma-rays as Bremsstrahlung when they\ncollide with air molecules. Here we calculate the distribution of angles\nbetween incident electrons and emitted photons as a function of electron and\nphoton energy. We derive these doubly differential cross-sections by\nintegrating analytically over the triply differential cross-sections derived by\nBethe and Heitler; this is appropriate for light atoms like nitrogen and oxygen\n(Z=7,8) if the energy of incident and emitted electron is larger than 1 keV. We\ncompare our results with the approximations and cross section used by other\nauthors. We also discuss some simplifying limit cases, and we derive some\nsimple approximation for the most probable scattering angle. We also provide\ncross sections for the production of electron positron pairs from energetic\nphotons when they interact with air molecules. This process is related to the\nBremsstrahlung process by some physical symmetry. Therefore the results above\ncan be transferred to predictions on the angles between incident photon and\nemitted positron, again as a function of photon and positron energy. We present\nthe distribution of angles and again a simple approximation for the most\nprobable scattering angle. Our results are given as analytical expressions as\nwell as in the form of a C++ code that can be directly be implemented into\nMonte Carlo codes.\n", "  We show differentiability of a class of Geroch's volume functions on globally\nhyperbolic manifolds. Furthermore, we prove that every volume function\nsatisfies a local anti-Lipschitz condition over causal curves, and that locally\nLipschitz time functions which are locally anti-Lipschitz can be uniformly\napproximated by smooth time functions with timelike gradient. Finally, we prove\nthat in stably causal spacetimes Hawking's time function can be uniformly\napproximated by smooth time functions with timelike gradient.\n", "  The inclusive top quark pair ($t\\bar{t}$) production cross-section\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ has been measured in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV\nand $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, using $t\\bar{t}$\nevents with an opposite-charge $e\\mu$ pair in the final state. The measurement\nwas performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ and the 2012 8 TeV dataset of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. The\ncross-section was measured to be: $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}=182.9\\pm 3.1\\pm 4.2\\pm 3.6\n\\pm 3.3$ pb ($\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV) and $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}=242.9\\pm 1.7\\pm 5.5\\pm\n5.1\\pm 4.2$ pb ($\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV, updated as described in the Addendum), where\nthe four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical\nsystematic effects, the knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC\nbeam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD\ncalculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements\ncorresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported,\ntogether with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass\nenergies. The inclusive cross-section results were used to determine the top\nquark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically-predicted cross-section\non $m_t^{\\rm pole}$, giving a result of $m_t^{\\rm pole}=172.9^{+2.5}_{-2.6}$\nGeV. By looking for an excess of $t\\bar{t}$ production with respect to the QCD\nprediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production\nof supersymmetric top squarks $\\tilde{t}_1$ with masses close to the top quark\nmass decaying via $\\tilde{t}_1\\rightarrow t\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1$ to predominantly\nright-handed top quarks and a light neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}_0^1$, the lightest\nsupersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and\n177 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level.\n", "  The number of constituent quarks (NCQ-) scaling of hadrons and the number of\nconstituent nucleons (NCN-) scaling of light nuclei are proposed for nuclear\nmodification factors ($R_{cp}$) of hadrons and light nuclei, respectively,\naccording to the experimental investigations in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. Based on coalescence mechanism the scalings are performed for pions\nand protons in quark level, and light nuclei $d (\\bar d)$ and $^3$He for\nnucleonic level, respectively, formed in Au + Au and Pb + Pb collisions and\nnice scaling behaviour emerges. NCQ or NCN scaling law of $R_{cp}$ can be\nrespectively taken as a probe for quark or nucleon coalescence mechanism for\nthe formation of hadron or light nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  In this paper we give a Clifford bundle motivated approach to the wave\nequation of a free spin $1/2$ fermion in the de Sitter manifold, a brane with\ntopology $M=\\mathrm{S0}(4,1)/\\mathrm{S0}(3,1)$ living in the bulk spacetime\n$\\mathbb{R}^{4,1}=(\\mathring{M}=\\mathbb{R}^{5},\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}})$ and\nequipped with a metric field\n$\\boldsymbol{g:=-i}^{\\ast}\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}%}$ with\n$\\boldsymbol{i}:M\\rightarrow\\mathring{M}$ being the inclusion map. To obtain\nthe analog of Dirac equation in Minkowski spacetime in the structure\n$\\mathring{M}$ we appropriately factorize the two Casimir invariants $C_{1}$\nand $C_{2}$ of the Lie algebra of the de Sitter group using the constraint\ngiven in the linearization of $C_{2}$ as input to linearize $C_{1}$. In this\nway we obtain an equation that we called \\textbf{DHESS1,}which in previous\nstudies by other authors was simply postulated.$.$Next we derive a wave\nequation (called \\textbf{DHESS2}) for a free spin $1/2$ fermion in the de\nSitter manifold using a heuristic argument which is an obvious generalization\nof a heuristic argument (described in detail in Appendix D) permitting a\nderivation of the Dirac equation in Minkowski spacetime and which shows that\nsuch famous equation express nothing more than the fact that the momentum of a\nfree particle is a constant vector field over timelike \\ integral curves of a\ngiven velocity field. It is a remarkable fact that \\textbf{DHESS1}and\n\\textbf{DHESS2}\\ coincide. One of the main ingredients in our paper is the use\nof the concept of Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields. Appendices B and C recall this\nconcept and its relation with covariant Dirac spinor fields usualy used by\nphysicists.\n", "  We study Coleman-De Luccia tunneling of the Standard Model Higgs field during\ninflation in the case when the electroweak vacuum is metastable. We verify that\nthe tunneling rate is exponentially suppressed. The main contribution to the\nsuppression is the same as in flat space-time. We analytically estimate the\ncorrections due to the expansion of the universe and an effective mass term in\nthe Higgs potential that can be present at inflation.\n", "  We have investigated the critical conditions required for a steady propeller\neffect for magnetized neutron stars with optically thick, geometrically thin\naccretion disks. We have shown through simple analytical calculations that a\nsteady-state propeller mechanism cannot be sustained at an inner disk radius\nwhere the viscous and magnetic stresses are balanced. The radius calculated by\nequating these stresses is usually found to be close to the conventional Alfven\nradius for spherical accretion, r_A. Our results show that: (1) a steady\npropeller phase can be established with a maximum inner disk radius that is at\nleast \\sim 15 times smaller than r_A depending on the mass-flow rate of the\ndisk, rotational period and strength of the magnetic dipole field of the star,\n(2) the critical accretion rate corresponding to the accretion-propeller\ntransition is orders of magnitude lower than the rate estimated by equating r_A\nto the co-rotation radius. Our results are consistent with the properties of\nthe transitional millisecond pulsars which show transitions between the\naccretion powered X-ray pulsar and the rotational powered radio pulsar states.\n", "  We report on highly nonlinear luminescence being observed from individual\nspherical gold nanoparticles immobilized on a glass surface and illuminated by\ncontinuous-wave (CW) lasers with relatively low power. The nonlinear\nluminescence shows optical super-resolution beyond the diffraction limit in\nthree dimensions compared to the scatting of the excitation laser light. The\nluminescence intensity from most nanoparticles is proportional to the 5th--7th\npower of the excitation laser power and has wide excitation and emission\nspectra across the visible wavelength range. Strong nonlinear luminescence is\nonly observed near the glass surface. High optical nonlinearity excited by low\nCW laser power is related to a long-lived dark state of the gold nanoparticles,\nwhere the excitation light is strongly absorbed. This phenomenon has potential\nbiological applications in super-resolution and deep tissue imaging.\n", "  Massive QED, in contrast with its massless counterpart, possesses two\nconserved charges; one is a screened (vanishing) Maxwell charge which is\ndirectly associated with the massive vector mesons through the identically\nconserved Maxwell current. A somewhat peculiar situation arises for couplings\nof Hermitian matter fields to massive vector potentials; in that case the only\ncurrent is the screened Maxwell current and the coupling disappears in the\nmassless limit. In case of selfinteracting massive vector mesons the situation\nbecomes even more peculiar in that the usually renormalizability guaranteeing\nvalidity of the first order power-counting criterion breaks down in second\norder and requires the compensatory presence of additional Hermitian H-fields.\nSome aspect of these observation have already been noticed in the BRST gauge\ntheoretic formulation, but here we use a new setting based on string-local\nvector mesons which is required by Hilbert space positivity. The coupling to\nH-fields induces Mexican hat like selfinteractions; they are not imposed and\nbear no relation with spontaneous symmetry breaking; they are rather\nconsequences of the foundational causal localization properties realized in a\nHilbert space setting. In case of selfinteracting massive vectormesons their\npresence is required in order to maintain the first order power-counting\nrestriction of renormalizability also in second order. The presentation of the\nnew Hilbert space setting for vector mesons which replaces gauge theory and\nextends on-shell unitarity to its off-shell counterpart is the main motivation\nfor this work. The new Hilbert space setting also shows that the second order\nLie-algebra structure of selfinteracting vector mesons is a consequence of the\nprinciples of QFT and promises a deeper understanding of the origin of\nconfinement.\n", "  The surface states of a 3D topological insulator (TI) exhibit topological\nprotection against backscattering. However, the contribution of bulk electrons\nto the transport data is an impediment to the topological protection of\nsurface. We report the tuning of the chemical potential in the bulk of Bi2Se2Te\nTI thin films, pinning it near the center of the bulk band gap, thereby\nsuppressing the bulk carriers. The temperature dependent resistance of these\nfilms shows activated behavior down to 50K, followed by a metallic transition\nat lower temperatures, a hallmark of the robustness of TI surface states.\nManifestation of topological protection and surface dominated transport is\nexplained by 2D weak antilocalization phenomenon. We further explore the effect\nof surface to bulk coupling in TI in this work, which is captured by the number\nof effective conducting surface channels that participate in the transport. The\npresence of a single conducting channel indicates a strong surface to bulk\ncoupling which is detrimental to purely topological transport. We demonstrate\nthe decoupling of topological surface states on opposite surfaces of thin\nfilms, thereby suppressing the bulk transport. Our findings provide a deeper\nunderstanding of surface to bulk coupling along with topological transport\nbehavior and their respective tunability.\n", "  Rare event search experiments using liquid xenon as target and detection\nmedium require ultra-low background levels to fully exploit their physics\npotential. Cosmic ray induced activation of the detector components and, even\nmore importantly, of the xenon itself during production, transportation and\nstorage at the Earth's surface, might result in the production of radioactive\nisotopes with long half-lives, with a possible impact on the expected\nbackground. We present the first dedicated study on the cosmogenic activation\nof xenon after 345 days of exposure to cosmic rays at the Jungfraujoch research\nstation at 3470m above sea level, complemented by a study of copper which has\nbeen activated simultaneously. We have directly observed the production of 7Be,\n101Rh, 125Sb, 126I and 127Xe in xenon, out of which only 125Sb could\npotentially lead to background for a multi-ton scale dark matter search. The\nproduction rates for five out of eight studied radioactive isotopes in copper\nare in agreement with the only existing dedicated activation measurement, while\nwe observe lower rates for the remaining ones. The specific saturation\nactivities for both samples are also compared to predictions obtained with\ncommonly used software packages, where we observe some underpredictions,\nespecially for xenon activation.\n", "  The problems of optimizing the value of an arbitrary observable of the\ntwo-level system at both a fixed time and the shortest possible time is\ntheoretically explored. Complete identification and classification along with\ncomprehensive analysis of globally optimal control policies and traps (i.e.\npolicies which are locally but not globally optimal) is presented. The central\nquestion addressed is whether the control landscape remains trap-free if\ncontrol constraints of the inequality type are imposed. The answer is\nastonishingly controversial, namely, although formally it is always negative,\nin practice it is positive provided that the control time is fixed and chosen\nlong enough.\n", "  A proposed high energy Future Circular Hadron-Electron Collider would provide\nsufficient energy in a clean environment to probe di-Higgs production. Using\nthis channel we show that the azimuthal angle correlation between the missing\ntransverse energy and the forward jet is a very good probe for the non-standard\n$hhh$ and $hhWW$ couplings. We give the exclusion limits on these couplings as\na function of integrated luminosity at a $95$\\% C.L. using the fiducial cross\nsections. With appropriate error fitting methodology we find that the Higgs\nboson self coupling could be measured to be $g^{(1)}_{hhh} =\n1.00^{+0.24(0.14)}_{-0.17(0.12)}$ of its expected Standard Model value at\n$\\sqrt s = 3.5(5.0)$ TeV for an ultimate 10 ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.\n", "  In conventional scattering theory, by large-distance asymptotics, at the cost\nof losing the information of the distance between target and observer, one\nimposes a large-distance asymptotics to achieve a scattering wave function\nwhich can be represented explicitly by a scattering phase shift. In this paper,\nwithout large-distance asymptotics, we establish an arbitrary-dimensional\nscattering theory. Arbitrary-dimensional scattering wave functions, scattering\nboundary conditions, cross sections, and phase shifts are given without\nlarge-distance asymptotics. The importance of an arbitrary-dimensional\nscattering theory is that the dimensional renormalization procedure in quantum\nfield theory needs an arbitrary-dimensional result. Moreover, we give a\ndiscussion of one- and two-dimensional scatterings.\n", "  Species spanning the animal kingdom have evolved extravagant and costly\nornaments to attract mating partners. Zahavi's handicap principle offers an\nelegant explanation for this: ornaments signal individual quality, and must be\ncostly to ensure honest signalling, making mate selection more efficient. Here\nwe incorporate the assumptions of the handicap principle into a mathematical\nmodel and show that they are sufficient to explain the heretofore puzzling\nobservation of bimodally distributed ornament sizes in a variety of species.\n", "  A $\\mathrm{CHSH}_{q}$ game is a generalization of the standard two player\n$\\mathrm{CHSH}$ game, having $q$ different input and output options. In\ncontrast to the binary game, the best classical and quantum winning strategies\nare not known exactly. In this paper we provide a constructive classical\nstrategy for winning a $\\mathrm{CHSH}_{q}$ game, with $q$ being a prime. Our\nconstruction achieves a winning probability better than\n$\\frac{1}{22}q^{-\\frac{2}{3}}$, which is in contrast with the previously known\nconstructive strategies achieving only the winning probability of $O(q^{-1})$.\n", "  Recent progress in the holographic approach makes it more transparent that\neach conductivity can be decomposed into the coherent contribution due to\nmomentum relaxation and the incoherent contribution due to intrinsic current\nrelaxation. In this paper we investigate this decomposition in the framework of\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We derive the perturbation equations, which\nare decoupled for a large class of background solutions, and then obtain the\nanalytic results of conductivity with the slow momentum relaxation in low\nfrequency approximation, which is consistent with the known results from memory\nmatrix techniques.\n", "  The paper deals with the problem of describing fundamental particles. The\nEinstein-Rosen approach was revisited to explain que charge-mass ratio\nquantization. Such a result is obtained once a quantization prescription is\napplied to the expression of gravitational energy defined in the realm of\nteleparallel gravity.\n", "  The recent observation of the 750 GeV diphoton excess at 13 TeV LHC has\nmotivated many scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we\nbegin by showing that many models which explain the observed excess tend to get\nstrongly coupled well below the Planck scale. We then study a simple scenario\ninvolving colored vector-like fermions with exotic charges, which is expected\nto stay weakly coupled till the Planck scale. We find the conditions under\nwhich this happens, derive the Renormalization Group equations for such models\nand solve them to show that perturbativity till Planck scale can be maintained\nfor a very reasonable choice of parameters. Finally, we discuss issues related\nto vacuum stability and the possibility of inflation in the scenarios we study.\n", "  Here we make an attempt to extend the idea of generalized Hawking temperature\nand modified Bekenstein entropy at the event horizon in a fractal universe. The\nmodified Hawking temperature and Bekenstein entropy are considered in the\ngoverning Friedmann equations, which is modified in the background of a fractal\nuniverse. The validity of the Generalized second law of thermodynamics\\,(GSLT)\nand Thermodynamic Equilibrium\\,(TE) have been examined and compared graphically\nin a fractal universe filled with a perfect fluid having the constant equation\nof state in three different generalized Bekenstein system.\n", "  An anisotropic limit of the 3d plaquette Ising model, in which the plaquette\ncouplings in one direction were set to zero, was solved for free boundary\nconditions by Suzuki (Phys. Rev. Lett. 28 (1972) 507), who later dubbed it the\nfuki-nuke, or \"no-ceiling\", model. Defining new spin variables as the product\nof nearest-neighbour spins transforms the Hamiltonian into that of a stack of\n(standard) 2d Ising models and reveals the planar nature of the magnetic order,\nwhich is also present in the fully isotropic 3d plaquette model. More recently,\nthe solution of the fuki-nuke model was discussed for periodic boundary\nconditions, which require a different approach to defining the product spin\ntransformation, by Castelnovo et al. (Phys. Rev. B 81 (2010) 184303).\n  We clarify the exact relation between partition functions with free and\nperiodic boundary conditions expressed in terms of original and product spin\nvariables for the 2d plaquette and 3d fuki-nuke models, noting that the\ndifferences are already present in the 1d Ising model. In addition, we solve\nthe 2d plaquette Ising model with helical boundary conditions. The various\nexactly solved examples illustrate how correlations can be induced in finite\nsystems as a consequence of the choice of boundary conditions.\n", "  In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal mathematical model for simulating\nthe formation and growth of a thrombus. Blood is treated as a multi-constituent\nmixture comprised of a linear fluid phase and a thrombus (solid) phase. The\ntransport and reactions of 10 chemical and biological species are incorporated\nusing a system of coupled convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) equations to\nrepresent three processes in thrombus formation: initiation, propagation and\nstabilization. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations using the\nlibraries of OpenFOAM were performed for two illustrative benchmark problems:\nin vivo thrombus growth in an injured blood vessel and in vitro thrombus\ndeposition in micro-channels (1.5mm x 1.6mm x 0.1mm) with small crevices\n(125{\\mu}m x 75{\\mu}m and 125{\\mu}m x 137{\\mu}m). For both problems, the\nsimulated thrombus deposition agreed very well with experimental observations,\nboth spatially and temporally. Based on the success with these two benchmark\nproblems, which have very different flow conditions and biological\nenvironments, we believe that the current model will provide useful insight\ninto the genesis of thrombosis in blood-wetted devices, and provide a tool for\nthe design of less thrombogenic devices.\n", "  The excess events reported by the ATLAS Collaboration in the $WZ$-final\nstate, and by the CMS Collaboration in the $e^+\\!e^- jj$, $Wh$ and $jj$-final\nstates, may be induced by the decays of a heavy boson $W'$ in the 1.8-2 TeV\nmass range, here modelled via the larger local group $SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ in a non-linear dynamical Higgs scenario. The\n$W'$-production cross section at the 13 TeV LHC is around 700-1200 fb. This\nframework also predicts a heavy $Z'$ boson with a mass of 2.5-4 TeV, and some\ndecay channels testable in the LHC Run II. We determine the cross section times\nbranching fractions for the dijet, dilepton and top-pair $Z'$-decay channels at\nthe 13 TeV LHC around 2.3, 7.1, 70.2 fb respectively, for $M_{Z'}= 2.5$ TeV,\nwhile one/two orders of magnitude smaller for the dijet/dilepton and top-pair\nmodes at $M_{Z'}= 4$ TeV. Non-zero contributions from the effective operators,\nand the underlying Higgs sector of the model, will induce sizeable enhancement\nin the $W^+W^-$ and $Z h$-final states that could be probed in the future LHC\nRun II.\n", "  We study a model with a real scalar Higgs field and a scalar triplet field\nthat allows existence of a topological defect -- a domain wall. The wall breaks\nthe global $O(3)$ symmetry of the model, which gives rise to non-Abelian\norientational degrees of freedom. We found an exact analytic solution that\ndescribes a domain wall with a localized configuration of the triplet field on\nit. This solution enables one to calculate contributions to the action from the\norientational and translational degrees of freedom of the triplet field. We\nalso study the linear stability of the domain wall with the triplet field\nswitched off. We obtain that degrees of freedom localized on the wall can\nappear or do not appear depending on the parameters of the model.\n", "  We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida effective exchange interaction\nbetween magnetic impurities embedded on the edges of transition-metal\ndichalcogenide flakes, using a three-orbital tight-binding model. Electronic\nstates lying midgap of the bulk structure have strong one-dimensional (1D)\ncharacter, localized on the edges of the crystallite. This results in exchange\ninteractions with $1/r$ (or slower) decay with distance $r$, similar to other\n1D systems. Most interestingly, however, the strong spin-orbit interaction in\nthese materials results in sizable non-collinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions between impurities, comparable in size to the usual Ising and\nin-plane components. Varying the relevant Fermi energy by doping or gating may\nallow one to modulate the effective interactions, controlling the possible\nhelical ground state configurations of multiple impurities.\n", "  Using a relation between a bi-orthogonal set of equiseparable bases and the\nweak values of the density matrix we derive an explicit formula for its\ntomographic reconstruction completely analogous to the standard mutually\nunbiased bases expansion. With the simple example of a qubit is evidenced the\nrelationship between weak values, measured probabilities and the separation\nbetween non-orthogonal bases.\n", "  Zero-knowledge proofs are mathematical cryptographic methods to demonstrate\nthe validity of a claim while providing no further information beyond the claim\nitself. The possibility of using such proofs to process classified and other\nsensitive physical data has attracted attention, especially in the field of\nnuclear arms control. Here we demonstrate a non-electronic fast neutron\ndifferential radiography technique using superheated emulsion detectors that\ncan confirm that two objects are identical without revealing their geometry or\ncomposition. Such a technique could form the basis of a verification system\nthat could confirm the authenticity of nuclear weapons without sharing any\nsecret design information. More broadly, by demonstrating a physical\nzero-knowledge proof that can compare physical properties of objects, this\nexperiment opens the door to developing other such secure proof-systems for\nother applications.\n", "  When we represent real-world systems as networks, the directions of links\noften convey valuable information. Finding module structures that respect link\ndirections is one of the most important tasks for analyzing directed networks.\nAlthough many notions of a directed module have been proposed, no consensus has\nbeen reached. This lack of consensus results partly because there might exist\ndistinct types of modules in a single directed network, whereas most previous\nstudies focused on an independent criterion for modules. To address this issue,\nwe propose a generic notion of the so-called truss structures in directed\nnetworks. Our definition of truss is able to extract two distinct types of\ntrusses, named the cycle truss and the flow truss, from a unified framework. By\napplying the method for finding trusses to empirical networks obtained from a\nwide range of research fields, we find that most real networks contain both\ncycle and flow trusses. In addition, the abundance of (and the overlap between)\nthe two types of trusses may be useful to characterize module structures in a\nwide variety of empirical networks. Our findings shed light on the importance\nof simultaneously considering different types of modules in directed networks.\n", "  We use a strong-disorder renormalization group (SDRG) method and ground-state\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to study S=1/2 spin chains with random\ncouplings, calculating disorder-averaged spin and dimer correlations. The QMC\nsimulations demonstrate logarithmic corrections to the power-law decaying\ncorrelations obtained with the SDRG scheme. The same asymptotic forms apply\nboth for systems with standard Heisenberg exchange and for certain multi-spin\ncouplings leading to spontaneous dimerization in the clean system. We show that\nthe logarithmic corrections arise in the valence-bond (singlet pair) basis from\na contribution that can not be generated by the SDRG scheme. In the model with\nmulti-spin couplings, where the clean system dimerizes spontaneously, random\nsinglets form between spinons localized at domain walls in the presence of\ndisorder. This amorphous valence-bond solid is asymptotically a random-singlet\nstate and only differs from the random-exchange Heisenberg chain in its\nshort-distance properties.\n", "  Warm dark matter cosmologies have been widely studied as an alternative to\nthe cold dark matter paradigm, the characteristic feature being a suppression\nof structure formation on small cosmological scales. A very similar situation\noccurs if standard cold dark matter particles are kept in local thermal\nequilibrium with a, possibly dark, relativistic species until the universe has\ncooled down to keV temperatures. We perform a systematic phenomenological study\nof this possibility, and classify all minimal models containing dark matter and\nan arbitrary radiation component that allow such a late kinetic decoupling. We\nrecover explicit cases recently discussed in the literature and identify new\nclasses of examples that are very interesting from a model-building point of\nview. In some of these models dark matter is inevitably self-interacting, which\nis remarkable in view of recent observational support for this possibility.\nHence, dark matter models featuring late kinetic decoupling have the potential\nnot only to alleviate the missing satellites problem but also to address other\nproblems of the cosmological concordance model on small scales, in particular\nthe cusp-core and too-big-too-fail problems, in some cases without invoking any\nadditional input.\n", "  We consider the $\\phi^4$ model in one space dimension with propagation speeds\nthat are small deviations from a constant function. In the constant-speed case,\na stationary solution called the kink is known explicitly, and the recent work\nof Kowalczyk, Martel, and Mu\\~noz established the asymptotic stability of the\nkink with respect to odd perturbations in the natural energy space. We show\nthat a stationary kink solution exists also for our class of non-constant\npropagation speeds, and extend the asymptotic stability result by taking a\nperturbative approach to the method of Kowalczyk, Martel, and Mu\\~noz. This\nrequires an understanding of the spectrum of the linearization around the\nvariable-speed kink.\n", "  A sufficiently general definition for the future and past boundaries of the\nchronology violating region is given. In comparison to previous studies, this\nwork does not assume that the complement of the chronology violating set is\nglobally hyperbolic. The boundary of the chronology violating set is studied\nand several propositions are obtained which confirm the reasonability of the\ndefinition. Some singularity theorems related to chronology violation are\nconsidered. Among the other results we prove that compactly generated horizons\nare compactly constructed.\n", "  The exact analytical solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a generalized\nsymmetrical Woods-Saxon potential are examined for a nucleon in Fluorine 17\nnucleus for bound and quasi-bound states in one dimension. The wave functions\nimply that the nucleon is completely confined within the nucleus, i.e., no\ndecay probability for bound states, while tunneling probabilities arise for the\nquasi-bound state. We have calculated the temperature dependent Helmholtz free\nenergies, the internal energies, the entropies and the specific heat capacities\nof the system. It is shown that, when the quasi-bound state is included, the\ninternal energy and entropy increase, while the Helmholtz energy decreases at\nhigh temperatures. Very high excitation temperatures imply that the nucleus\ndoes not tend to release a nucleon. The calculated quasi bound state energy is\nin reasonable agreement with the experimental data on the cumulative fission\nenergy issued by IAEA.\n", "  We have performed density functional calculations on the group II-IV nitride\nMgSiN$_{2}$. At a pressure of about 20~GPa the ground state wurtzite derived\nMgSiN$_{2}$ structure (LP-MgSiN$_{2}$) transforms into a rock-salt derived\nstructure (HP-MgSiN$_{2}$) in agreement with previous theoretical and\nexperimental studies. Both phases are wide band gap semiconductors with\nindirect band gaps at equilibrium of 5.58 eV (LP-MgSiN$_{2}$) and 5.87 eV\n(HP-MgSiN$_{2}$), respectively. As the pressure increases, the band gaps become\nlarger for both phases, however, the band gap in LP-MgSiN$_{2}$ increases\nfaster than the gap in HP-MgSiN$_{2}$ and with a high enough pressure the band\ngap in LP-MgSiN$_{2}$ becomes larger than the band gap in HP-MgSiN$_{2}$.\n", "  Temperature chaos plays a role in important effects, like for example memory\nand rejuvenation, in spin glasses, colloids, polymers. We numerically\ninvestigate temperature chaos in spin glasses, exploiting its recent\ncharacterization as a rare-event driven phenomenon. The peculiarities of the\ntransformation from periodic to anti-periodic boundary conditions in spin\nglasses allow us to conclude that temperature chaos is non-local: no bounded\nregion of the system causes it. We precise the statistical relationship between\ntemperature chaos and the free-energy changes upon varying boundary conditions.\n", "  If the initial quantum state of the primordial perturbations broke rotational\ninvariance, that would be seen as a statistical anisotropy in the angular\ncorrelations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) temperature\nfluctuations. This can be described by a general parameterisation of the\ninitial conditions that takes into account the possible direction-dependence of\nboth the amplitude and the phase of particle creation during inflation. The\nleading effect in the CMBR two-point function is typically a quadrupole\nmodulation, whose coefficient is analytically constrained here to be $|B|\n\\lesssim 0.06$. The CMBR three-point function then acquires enhanced\nnon-gaussianity, especially for the local configurations. In the large\noccupation number limit, a distinctive prediction is a modulation of the\nnon-gaussianity around a mean value depending on the angle that short and long\nwavelength modes make with the preferred direction. The maximal variations with\nrespect to the mean value occur for the configurations which are coplanar with\nthe preferred direction and the amplitude of the non-gaussianity increases\n(decreases) for the short wavelength modes aligned with (perpendicular to) the\npreferred direction. For a high scale model of inflation with maximally pumped\nup isotropic occupation and $\\epsilon\\simeq 0.01$ the difference between these\ntwo configurations is about $0.27$, which could be detectable in the future.\nFor purely anisotropic particle creation, the non-Gaussianity can be larger and\nits anisotropic feature very sharp. The non-gaussianity can then reach $f_{NL}\n\\sim 30$ in the preferred direction while disappearing from the correlations in\nthe orthogonal plane.\n", "  The sporadic accretion following the tidal disruption of a star by a\nsuper-massive black hole (TDE) leads to a bright UV and soft X-ray flare in the\ngalactic nucleus. The gas and dust surrounding the black hole responses to such\na flare with an echo in emission lines and infrared emission. In this paper, we\nreport the detection of long fading mid-IR emission lasting up to 14 years\nafter the flare in four TDE candidates with transient coronal lines using the\nWISE public data release. We estimate that the reprocessed mid-IR luminosities\nare in the range between $4\\times 10^{42}$ and $2\\times 10^{43}$ erg~s$^{-1}$\nand dust temperature in the range of 570-800K when WISE first detected these\nsources three to five years after the flare. Both luminosity and dust\ntemperature decreases with time. We interpret the mid-IR emission as the\ninfrared echo of the tidal disruption flare. We estimate the UV luminosity at\nthe peak flare to be 1 to 30 times $10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and for warm dust\nmasses to be in the range of 0.05-1.3 Msun within a few parsecs. Our results\nsuggest that the mid-infrared echo is a general signature of TDE in the\ngas-rich environment.\n", "  In artificial neural networks, learning from data is a computationally\ndemanding task in which a large number of connection weights are iteratively\ntuned through stochastic-gradient-based heuristic processes over a\ncost-function. It is not well understood how learning occurs in these systems,\nin particular how they avoid getting trapped in configurations with poor\ncomputational performance. Here we study the difficult case of networks with\ndiscrete weights, where the optimization landscape is very rough even for\nsimple architectures, and provide theoretical and numerical evidence of the\nexistence of rare - but extremely dense and accessible - regions of\nconfigurations in the network weight space. We define a novel measure, which we\ncall the \"robust ensemble\" (RE), which suppresses trapping by isolated\nconfigurations and amplifies the role of these dense regions. We analytically\ncompute the RE in some exactly solvable models, and also provide a general\nalgorithmic scheme which is straightforward to implement: define a\ncost-function given by a sum of a finite number of replicas of the original\ncost-function, with a constraint centering the replicas around a driving\nassignment. To illustrate this, we derive several powerful new algorithms,\nranging from Markov Chains to message passing to gradient descent processes,\nwhere the algorithms target the robust dense states, resulting in substantial\nimprovements in performance. The weak dependence on the number of precision\nbits of the weights leads us to conjecture that very similar reasoning applies\nto more conventional neural networks. Analogous algorithmic schemes can also be\napplied to other optimization problems.\n", "  In this paper we continue to study billiards with flat points, by\nconstructing a spec family of dispersing billiards with cusps. All boundaries\nof the table have positive curvature except that the curvature vanishes at the\nvertex of a cusp, i.e. there is a pair of boundaries intersection at the flat\npoint tangentially. We study the mixing rates of this one-parameter family of\nbilliards with parameter $\\beta\\in (2,\\infty)$, and show that the correlation\nfunctions of the collision map decay polynomially with order\n$\\cO(n^{-\\frac{1}{\\beta-1}})$ as $n\\to\\infty$. In particular, this solves an\nopen question raised by Chernov and Markarian \\cite{CM05}.\n", "  We establish the ultimate limits to the compression of sequences of\nidentically prepared qubits. The limits are determined by Holevo's information\nquantity and are attained through use of the optimal universal cloning machine,\nwhich finds here a novel application to quantum Shannon theory.\n", "  Resilience to noise and to decoherence processes is an important ingredient\nfor the implementation of quantum information processing, and quantum\ntechnologies. To this end, techniques such as pulsed and continuous dynamical\ndecoupling have been proposed to reduce noise effects. In this paper, we\nsuggest a new approach to implementing continuous dynamical decoupling\ntechniques, that uses an extra control parameter; namely, the ability to shape\nthe time dependence of the detuning. This approach reduces the complexity of\nthe experimental setup, such that we are only left with noise originating from\nthe frequency of the driving field, which is much more robust than the\namplitude (Rabi frequency) noise. As an example, we show that our technique can\nbe utilized for improved sensing.\n", "  The computation and analysis of photoelectron spectra (PES) is a fundamental\ntechnique in atomic and molecular physics to study the structural and dynamical\nproperties of a target system, and to gain insight into the process of its\nionization. Since the first numerical solutions of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, numerous methods have been developed to extract PES\nfrom the calculated wave functions. However, most of these methods have severe\nlimitations or are computationally very demanding. Here we present a new family\nof methods, based on the ideas of the so-called analytical Volkov continuation,\nor time-dependent surface flux ([Ermolaev, A. M. et al. Phys. Rev. A 60, 4831\n(1999), Ermolaev, A. M. et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 015401 (2000), Tao L. and\nScrinzi A. New Journal of Physics 14, 013021 (2012)]), that allows one to\nobtain fully-converged PES at the end of the laser pulse using either Volkov\nstates or the exact scattering-states, and that has been implemented in the\nTime Dependent Schr\\\"odinger Equation (TDSE) solver ([Patchkovskii S. and\nMuller H. G., Computer Physics Communications 199, 153 (2016)]).\n", "  The nature of the interaction between superfluid vortices and the neutron\nstar crust, conjectured by Anderson and Itoh in 1975 to be at the heart vortex\ncreep and the cause of glitches, has been a long-standing question in\nastrophysics. Using a qualitatively new approach, we follow the dynamics as\nsuperfluid vortices move in response to the presence of \"nuclei\" (nuclear\ndefects in the crust). The resulting motion is perpendicular to the force,\nsimilar to the motion of a spinning top when pushed. We show that nuclei repel\nvortices in the neutron star crust, and characterize the force as a function of\nthe vortex-nucleus separation.\n", "  Identifying factors that affect human decision making and quantifying their\ninfluence remain essential and challenging tasks for the design and\nimplementation of social and technological communication systems. We report\nresults of a behavioral experiment involving decision making in the face of an\nimpending natural disaster. In a controlled laboratory setting, we characterize\nindividual and group evacuation decision making influenced by several key\nfactors, including the likelihood of the disaster, available shelter capacity,\ngroup size, and group decision protocol. Our results show that success in\nindividual decision making is not a strong predictor of group performance. We\nuse an artificial neural network trained on the collective behavior of subjects\nto predict individual and group outcomes. Overall model accuracy increases with\nthe inclusion of a subject-specific performance parameter based on laboratory\ntrials that captures individual differences. In parallel, we demonstrate that\nthe social media activity of individual subjects, specifically their Facebook\nuse, can be used to generate an alternative individual personality profile that\nleads to comparable model accuracy. Quantitative characterization and\nprediction of collective decision making is crucial for the development of\neffective policies to guide the action of populations in the face of threat or\nuncertainty.\n", "  Robust topological edge modes may evolve into complex-frequency modes when a\nphysical system becomes non-Hermitian. We show that, while having negligible\nforward optical extinction cross section, a conjugate pair of such complex\ntopological edge modes in a non-Hermitian $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system can\ngive rise to an anomalous sideway scattering when they are simultaneously\nexcited by a plane wave. We propose a realization of such scattering state in a\nlinear array of subwavelength resonators coated with gain media. The prediction\nis based on an analytical two-band model and verified by rigorous numerical\nsimulation using multiple-multipole scattering theory. The result suggests an\nextreme situation where leakage of classical information is unnoticeable to the\ntransmitter and the receiver when such a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric unit is\ninserted into the communication channel.\n", "  Many new physics models contain a neutral scalar resonance that can be\npredominantly produced via gluon fusion through loops. In such a case, there\ncould be important effects of additional particles, that in turn may hadronize\nbefore decaying and form bound states. This interesting possibility may lead to\nnovel signatures with double peaks that can be searched for at the LHC. We\nstudy the phenomenology of double peak searches in diboson final states from\nloop induced production and decay of a new neutral spin-0 resonance at the LHC.\nThe loop-induced couplings should be mediated by particles carrying color and\nelectroweak charge that after forming bound states will induce a second peak in\nthe diboson invariant mass spectrum near twice their mass. A second peak could\nbe present via loop-induced couplings into $gg$ (dijet), $\\gamma\\gamma$ and\n$Z\\gamma$ final states as well as in the $WW$ and $ZZ$ channels for the case of\na pseudo-scalar resonance or for scalars with suppressed tree-level coupling to\ngauge bosons.\n", "  DARk matter WImp search with liquid xenoN (DARWIN) will be an experiment for\nthe direct detection of dark matter using a multi-ton liquid xenon time\nprojection chamber at its core. Its primary goal will be to explore the\nexperimentally accessible parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs) in a wide mass-range, until neutrino interactions with the\ntarget become an irreducible background. The prompt scintillation light and the\ncharge signals induced by particle interactions in the xenon will be observed\nby VUV sensitive, ultra-low background photosensors. Besides its excellent\nsensitivity to WIMPs above a mass of 5 GeV/c2, such a detector with its large\nmass, low-energy threshold and ultra-low background level will also be\nsensitive to other rare interactions. It will search for solar axions, galactic\naxion-like particles and the neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136-Xe, as well\nas measure the low-energy solar neutrino flux with <1% precision, observe\ncoherent neutrino-nucleus interactions, and detect galactic supernovae. We\npresent the concept of the DARWIN detector and discuss its physics reach, the\nmain sources of backgrounds and the ongoing detector design and R&D efforts.\n", "  We give a simple differential geometric proof of the conformal transformation\nof the night sky under change of observer. The proof does not rely on the four\ndimensionality of spacetime or on spinor methods. Furthermore, it really shows\nthat the result does not depend on Lorentz transformations. This approach, by\ngiving a transparent covariant expression to the conformal factor, shows that\nin most situations it is possible to define a thermal sky metric independent of\nthe observer.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of spin-preserving symmetries due to the\ninterplay of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in n-doped zinc-blende\nsemiconductor quantum wells of general crystal orientation. It is shown that a\nconserved spin operator can be realized if and only if at least two\ngrowth-direction Miller indices agree in modulus. The according spin-orbit\nfield has in general both in-plane and out-of-plane components and is always\nperpendicular to the shift vector of the corresponding persistent spin helix.\nWe also analyze higher-order effects arising from the Dresselhaus term, and the\nimpact of our results on weak (anti)localization corrections.\n", "  We explore the distance-redshift relation using a cosmographic methodology,\nand show how the cosmographic parameters can be used to determine the redshift\nof transition from deceleration to acceleration. Such a transition at a low\nredshift occupies only a small region of the available parameter space, and the\nprior assumption of an early period of deceleration can significantly change\nthe posterior constraints. We use available type Ia Supernovae (SN-Ia) and\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data sets to determine the cosmographic\ndeceleration $q_0$, jerk $j_0$, snap $s_0$ and lerk $l_0$ parameters. The\nparameters are consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM model for a flat universe\nwithin 2-sigma. We derive constraints on the redshift of transition from\ndeceleration to acceleration for the different expansions, and find $z_{\\rm\nacc} > 0.14$ at 95% confidence in the most conservative case.\n", "  Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have been predicted to exist in the topological\ninsulator (TI)/superconductor (SC) heterostructure. Recent spin polarized\nscanning tunneling microscope (STM) experiment$^{1}$ has observed\nspin-polarization dependence of the zero bias differential tunneling\nconductance at the center of vortex core, which may be attributed to the spin\nselective Andreev reflection, a novel property of the MZMs theoretically\npredicted in 1-dimensional nanowire$^{2}$. Here we consider a helical electron\nsystem described by a Rashba spin orbit coupling Hamiltonian on a spherical\nsurface with a s-wave superconducting pairing due to proximity effect. We\nexamine in-gap excitations of a pair of vortices with one at the north pole and\nthe other at the south pole. While the MZM is not a spin eigenstate, the spin\nwavefunction of the MZM at the center of the vortex core, r = 0, is parallel to\nthe magnetic field, and the local Andreev reflection of the MZM is spin\nselective, namely occurs only when the STM tip has the spin polarization\nparallel to the magnetic field, similar to the case in 1-dimensional nanowire2.\nThe total local differential tunneling conductance consists of the normal term\nproportional to the local density of states and an additional term arising from\nthe Andreev reflection. We also discuss the finite size effect, for which the\nMZM at the north pole is hybridized with the MZM at the south pole. We apply\nour theory to examine the recently reported spin-polarized STM experiments and\nshow good agreement with the experiments.\n", "  We show that reformulating the Direct State Tomography (DST) protocol in\nterms of projections into a set of non-orthogonal bases one can perform an\naccuracy analysis of DST in a similar way as in the standard projection-based\nreconstruction schemes. i.e. in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between\nestimated and true states. This allows us to determine the estimation error for\nany measurement strength, including the weak measurement case, and to obtain an\nexplicit analytic form for the average minimum square errors.\n", "  We report a detailed computational study by Brownian Dynamics simulations of\nthe structure and dynamics of a liquid of patchy particles which develops an\namorphous tetrahedral network upon decreasing temperature. The highly\ndirectional particle interactions allows us to investigate the system\nconnectivity by discriminating the total set of particles into different\npopulations according to a penta-modal distribution of bonds per particle. With\nthis methodology we show how the particle bonding process is not randomly\nindependent but it manifests clear bond correlations at low temperatures. We\nfurther explore the dynamics of the system in real space and establish a clear\nrelation between particle mobility and particle connectivity. In particular, we\nprovide evidence of anomalous diffusion at low temperatures and reveal how the\ndynamics is affected by the short-time hopping motion of the weakly bounded\nparticles. Finally we widely investigate the dynamics and structure of the\nsystem in Fourier space and identify two quantitatively similar length scales,\none dynamic and the other one static, which increase upon cooling the system\nand reach distances of the order of few particle diameters. We summarize our\nfindings in a qualitative picture where the low temperature regime of the\nviscoelastic liquid is understood in terms of an evolving network of long time\nmetastable cooperative domains of particles.\n", "  We study complex networks of stochastic two-state units. Our aim is to model\ndiscrete stochastic excitable dynamics with a rest and an excited state. Both\nstates are assumed to possess different waiting time distributions. The rest\nstate is treated as an activation process with an exponentially distributed\nlife time, whereas the latter in the excited state shall have a constant mean\nwhich may originate from any distribution. The activation rate of any single\nunit is determined by its neighbors according to a random complex network\nstructure. In order to treat this problem in an analytical way, we use a\nheterogeneous mean-field approximation yielding a set of equations general\nvalid for uncorrelated random networks. Based on this derivation we focus on\nrandom binary networks where the network is solely comprised of nodes with\neither of two degrees. The ratio between the two degrees is shown to be a\ncrucial parameter. Dependent on the composition of the network the steady\nstates show the usual transition from disorder to homogeneous ordered\nbistability as well as new scenarios that include inhomogeneous ordered and\ndisordered bistability as well as tristability. The various steady states\ndiffer in their spiking activity expressed by a state dependent spiking rate.\nNumerical simulations agree with analytic results of the heterogeneous\nmean-field approximation.\n", "  We examine a quintessence model with a modified exponential potential given\nby $V(\\phi) = V_0(1+e^{-\\lambda \\phi})$. Unlike quintessence with a standard\nexponential potential, our model can yield an acceptable accelerated expansion\nat late times, while producing a distinct \"early dark energy\" signature at high\nredshift. We determine the evolution of the equation of state parameter,\n$w_\\phi$, and the density parameter, $\\Omega_\\phi$, as a function of the scale\nfactor. The strongest constraints on the model come from cosmic microwave\nbackground observations rather than supernova data. The former give the limit\n$\\lambda > 13$. This model predicts a value of the effective neutrino number\nduring Big Bang nucleosynthesis larger than the standard model value. It also\nprovides a partial solution to the coincidence problem, in that the ratio of\nthe quintessence energy density is always within a few orders of magnitude of\nthe background radiation or matter density from the early universe up to the\npresent, but it does not explain why the accelerated expansion is beginning\nnear the present day, suggesting that these two different ways of\ncharacterizing the coincidence problem are not entirely equivalent.\n", "  We report here on a new method for calculating the renormalized stress-energy\ntensor (RSET) in black-hole (BH) spacetimes, which should also be applicable to\ndynamical BHs and to spinning BHs. This new method only requires the spacetime\nto admit a single symmetry. So far we developed three variants of the method,\naimed for stationary, spherically symmetric, or axially symmetric BHs. We used\nthis method to calculate the RSET of a minimally-coupled massless scalar field\nin Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom backgrounds, for several quantum\nstates. We present here the results for the RSET in the Schwarzschild case in\nUnruh state (the state describing BH evaporation). The RSET is type I at weak\nfield, and becomes type IV at $r\\lesssim2.78M$. Then we use the RSET results to\nexplore violation of the weak and null Energy conditions. We find that both\nconditions are violated all the way from $r\\simeq4.9M$ to the horizon. We also\nfind that the averaged weak energy condition is violated by a class of\n(unstable) circular timelike geodesics. Most remarkably, the circular null\ngeodesic at $r=3M$ violates the averaged null energy condition.\n", "  Galaxy cluster mass determinations achieved using X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich data combined with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium\nare generally biased. The bias exists for two main reasons: non-thermal\npressure forces are expected to contribute to the overall pressure balance and\ndeviations from spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium can be present.\nIn this paper, we use a sample of zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy\nclusters to measure the magnitude of hydrostatic bias and the non-thermal\ncontribution to the total pressure. We propose a new empirical model for\nnon-thermal pressure based on our simulations that can be applied to\nobservations. We show that our model can be successfully applied to remove most\nof the bias related to neglection of non-thermal pressure, which is usually not\nincluded in hydrostatic cluster mass profile reconstructions. The use of this\nmodel may significantly improve the calibration of cluster scaling relations\nthat are a key tool for cluster cosmology.\n", "  Natural protein sequences that self-assemble to form globular structures are\ncompact with high packing densities in the folded states. It is known that\nproteins unfold upon addition of denaturants, adopting random coil structures.\nThe dependence of the radii of gyration on protein size in the folded and\nunfolded states obeys the same scaling laws as synthetic polymers. Thus, one\nmight surmise that the mechanism of collapse in proteins and polymers ought to\nbe similar. However, because the number of amino acids in single domain\nproteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been\nresolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that\nfavor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By\nadopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the\npropensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and\nis encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over\n2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\\beta$-sheets have greater tendency\nto be compact than $\\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into\nthe reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis\nfor the origin of multi-domain proteins. Application to non-coding RNA\nmolecules show that they have evolved to collapse sharing similarities to\n$\\beta$-sheet proteins. An implication of our theory is that the evolution of\nnatural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient\nfolding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding\nconditions. This concept also supports the compaction selection hypothesis used\nto rationalize the unusually condensed states of viral RNA molecules.\n", "  The generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation (gGPE) is an effective\nphenomenological description for the dynamics of incoherently pumped\nexciton-polariton condensates. However, a brute force numerical simulation of\nthe gGPE provides little physical insight into condensate formation under\narbitrary pumping configurations, and is demanding in terms of computational\nresources. We introduce in this paper a modal description of polariton\ncondensation under incoherent pumping of arbitrary spatial profile, based on\neigenmodes of the non-Hermitian generator of the linearized dynamics. A\npump-dependent basis is then introduced to formulate a temporal coupled-mode\ntheory that captures condensate dynamics in the presence of all nonlinear\ninteractions. Simulations using a single set of modes for a given pumping and\ntrapping configuration agree very well with a full integration of the gGPE in\ndiverse dynamical regimes, supporting the validity of this modal description,\nwhile also providing a speedup in simulation times.\n", "  We report a new ultra-faint stellar system found in Dark Energy Camera data\nfrom the first observing run of the Magellanic Satellites Survey (MagLiteS).\nMagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pictor II or Pic II) is a low surface brightness ({\\mu} =\n28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ within its half-light radius) resolved overdensity of\nold and metal-poor stars located at a heliocentric distance of 45 kpc. The\nphysical size (r$_{1/2}$ = 46 pc) and low luminosity (Mv = -3.2 mag) of this\nsatellite are consistent with the locus of spectroscopically confirmed\nultra-faint galaxies. MagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pic II) is located 11.3 kpc from the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and comparisons with simulation results in the\nliterature suggest that this satellite was likely accreted with the LMC. The\nclose proximity of MagLiteS J0644-5953 (Pic II) to the LMC also makes it the\nmost likely ultra-faint galaxy candidate to still be gravitationally bound to\nthe LMC.\n", "  In first order formulation of pure gravity, we find a new class of solutions\nto the equations of motion represented by degenerate four-geometries. These\nconfigurations are described by non- invertible tetrads with two zero\neigenvalues and admit non-vanishing torsion. The homogeneous ones among these\ninfinitely many degenerate solutions admit a geometric classification provided\nby the three fundamental geometries that a closed two-surface can accomodate,\nnamely, E^2 , S^2 and H^2.\n", "  It has recently been shown that if the dark matter is in thermal equilibrium\nwith a sector that is highly decoupled from the Standard Model, it can\nfreeze-out with an acceptable relic abundance, even if the dark matter is as\nheavy as ~1-100 PeV. In such scenarios, both the dark and visible sectors are\npopulated after inflation, but with independent temperatures. The lightest\nparticle in the dark sector will be generically long-lived, and can come to\ndominate the energy density of the universe. Upon decaying, these particles can\nsignificantly reheat the visible sector, diluting the abundance of dark matter\nand thus allowing for dark matter particles that are much heavier than\nconventional WIMPs. In this paper, we present a systematic and pedagogical\ntreatment of the cosmological history in this class of models, emphasizing the\nsimplest scenarios in which a dark matter candidate annihilates into hidden\nsector particles which then decay into visible matter through the vector,\nHiggs, or lepton portals. In each case, we find ample parameter space in which\nvery heavy dark matter particles can provide an acceptable thermal relic\nabundance. We also discuss possible extensions of models featuring these\ndynamics.\n", "  Optical pumping of solids creates a non-equilibrium electronic structure\nwhere electrons and photons combine to form quasiparticles of dressed\nelectronic states. The resulting shift of electronic levels is known as the\noptical Stark effect, visible as a red shift in the optical spectrum. Here we\nshow that in a pump-probe setup we can uniquely define a non-equilibrium\nquasiparticle bandstructure that can be directly measurable with photo-electron\nspectroscopy. The dynamical photon-dressing (and undressing) of the many-body\nelectronic states can be monitored by pump-probe time and angular resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) as the photon-dressed bandstructure\nevolves in time depending on the pump-probe pulse overlap. The computed\ntr-ARPES spectrum agrees perfectly with the quasi-energy spectrum of Floquet\ntheory at maximum overlap and goes to the the equilibrium bandstructure as the\npump-probe overlap goes to zero. Additionally, we show how this time-dependent\nnon-equilibrium quasiparticle structure can be understood to be the\nbandstructure underlying the optical Stark effect. The extension to\nspin-resolved PES can be used to predict asymmetric dichroic response linked to\nthe valley selective optical excitations in monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs).\n", "  For semimetal nanowires with diameters smaller than a few tens of nanometers,\na semimetal-to-semiconductor transition is observed as the emergence of an\nenergy band gap resulting from quantum confinement. Quantum confinement in a\nsemimetal results in either lifting of the degeneracy of the conduction and\nvalence bands in a zero gap semimetal, or shifting of bands with a negative\nenergy overlap to form conduction and valence bands. For semimetal nanowires\nwith diameters below 10 nanometer, the magnitude of the band gap can become\nsignificantly larger than the thermal energy at room temperature resulting in a\nnew class of semiconductors relevant for nanoelectronics with critical\ndimensions on the order of a few atomic lengths. The smaller a nanowire's\ndiameter, the larger its surface-to-volume ratio thus leading to an increasing\nimpact of surface chemistry on its electronic structure. Energy level shifts to\nstates in the vicinity of the Fermi level due to the electronegativity of\nsurface terminating species are shown to be comparable in magnitude to quantum\nconfinement effects at nanowire diameters of a few nanometer; these two effects\ncan be used to counteract one another leading to semimetallic behavior for\nnanowire cross sections at which the quantum confinement effect would otherwise\ndominate. Abruptly changing the surface terminating species along the length of\na nanowire leads to an abrupt change in the surface electronegativity. This can\nresult in the formation of a semimetal-semiconductor junction within a\nmonomaterial nanowire, without the need for impurity doping nor requiring the\nformation of a heterojunction.\n", "  A fundamental aspect of the three-body problem is its stability. Most\nstability studies have focused on the co-planar three-body problem, deriving\nanalytic criteria for the dynamical stability of such pro/retrograde systems.\nNumerical studies of inclined systems phenomenologically mapped their stability\nregions, but neither complement it by theoretical framework, nor provided\nsatisfactory fit for their dependence on mutual inclinations. Here we present a\nnovel approach to study the stability of hierarchical three-body systems at\narbitrary inclinations, which accounts not only for the instantaneous stability\nof such systems, but also for the secular stability and evolution through\nLidov-Kozai cycles and evection. We generalize the Hill-stability criteria to\narbitrarily inclined triple systems, explain the existence of quasi-stable\nregimes and characterize the inclination dependence of their stability. We\ncomplement the analytic treatment with an extensive numerical study, to test\nour analytic results. We find excellent correspondence up to high inclinations\n$(\\sim120^{\\circ}$), beyond which the agreement is marginal. At such high\ninclinations the stability radius is larger, the ratio between the outer and\ninner periods becomes comparable, and our secular averaging approach is no\nlonger strictly valid. We therefore combine our analytic results with\npolynomial fits to the numerical results to obtain a generalized stability\nformula for triple systems at arbitrary inclinations. Besides providing a\ngeneralized secular-based physical explanation for the stability of non\nco-planar systems, our results have direct implications for any triple systems,\nand in particular binary planets and moon/satellite systems; we briefly discuss\nthe latter as a test case for our models.\n", "  A precise theoretical study of the electronic structure of heavy atom\ndiatomic molecules is of key importance to interpret the experiments in the\nsearch for violation of time-reversal (T) and spatial-parity (P) symmetries of\nfundamental interactions it terms of the electron electric dipole moment, eEDM,\nand dimensionless constant, $k_{T,P}$, characterizing the strength of the\nT,P-odd pseudoscalar$-$scalar electron$-$nucleus neutral current interaction.\nACME collaboration has recently obtained and improved limits on these\nquantities using a beam of ThO molecules in the $H^3\\Delta_1$ state [Science\n343, 269 (2014)]. We apply the combined direct 4-component and two-step\nrelativistic pseudopotential/restoration approaches to a benchmark calculation\nof the effective electric field, Eeff, parameter of the T,P-odd\npseudoscalar$-$scalar interaction, $W_{T,P}$, and HFS constant in $^3\\Delta_1$\nstate of the ThO molecule. The first two parameters are required to interpret\nthe experimental data in terms of the eEDM and $k_{T,P}$ constant. We have\ninvestigated the electron correlation for all of the 98 electrons of ThO\nsimultaneously up to the level of the coupled cluster with single, double and\nnoniterative triple amplitudes theory. Contributions from iterative triple and\nnoniterative quadruple cluster amplitudes for the valence electrons have been\nalso treated. The obtained values are Eeff=79.9 GV/cm, $W_{T,P}$=113.1 kHz. The\ntheoretical uncertainty of these values we estimate as about two times smaller\nthan that of our previous study [JCP, 142, 024301 (2015)]. It was found that\nthe correlation of the inner- and outer- core electrons contributes 9% to the\neffective electric field. The values of the molecule frame dipole moment of the\n$^3\\Delta_1$ state and the $H^3\\Delta_1\\to X^1\\Sigma^+$ transition energy of\nThO calculated within the same methods are in a very good agreement with the\nexperiment.\n", "  We assume that the origin of the electroweak (EW) scale is a gauge-invariant\nscalar-bilinear condensation in a strongly interacting non-abelian gauge\nsector, which is connected to the standard model via a Higgs portal coupling.\nThe dynamical scale genesis appears as a phase transition at finite\ntemperature, and it can produce a gravitational wave (GW) background in the\nearly Universe. We find that the critical temperature of the scale phase\ntransition lies above that of the EW phase transition and below few $O(100)$\nGeV and it is strongly first-order. We calculate the spectrum of the GW\nbackground and find the scale phase transition is strong enough that the GW\nbackground can be observed by DECIGO.\n", "  We analytically compute the two-loop scattering amplitude $gg \\to Hg$\nassuming that the mass of the quark, that mediates the ggH interaction, is\nvanishingly small. Our computation provides an important ingredient required to\nimprove the theoretical description of the top-bottom interference effect in\nHiggs boson production in gluon fusion, and to elucidate its impact on the\nHiggs boson transverse momentum distribution.\n", "  Lorentz symmetry is one of the pillars of both General Relativity and the\nStandard Model of particle physics. Motivated by ideas about quantum gravity,\nunification theories and violations of CPT symmetry, a significant effort has\nbeen put the last decades into testing Lorentz symmetry. This review focuses on\nLorentz symmetry tests performed in the gravitational sector. We briefly review\nthe basics of the pure gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension\n(SME) framework, a formalism developed in order to systematically parametrize\nhypothetical violations of the Lorentz invariance. Furthermore, we discuss the\nlatest constraints obtained within this formalism including analyses of the\nfollowing measurements: atomic gravimetry, Lunar Laser Ranging, Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry, planetary ephemerides, Gravity Probe B, binary\npulsars, high energy cosmic rays,... In addition, we propose a combined\nanalysis of all these results. We also discuss possible improvements on current\nanalyses and present some sensitivity analyses for future observations.\n", "  We study quantum information properties of a seven-level system realized by a\nparticle in an one-dimensional square-well trap. Features of encodings of\nseven-level systems in a form of three-qubit or qubit-qutrit systems are\ndiscussed. We use the three-qubit encoding of the system in order to\ninvestigate subadditivity and strong subadditivity conditions for the thermal\nstate of the particle. The qubit-qutrit encoding is employed to suggest a\nsingle qudit algorithm for calculation of parity of a bit string. Obtained\nresults indicate on the potential resource of multilevel systems for\nrealization of quantum information processing.\n", "  Tapered and dispersion managed (DM) silicon nanophotonic waveguides are\ninvestigated for the generation of optimal ultra broadband supercontinuum (SC).\nDM waveguides are structures showing a longitudinally dependent group velocity\ndispersion that results from the variation of the waveguide width with the\npropagation distance. For the generation of optimal SC, a genetic algorithm has\nbeen used to find the best dispersion map. This allows for the generation of\nhighly coherent supercontinuums that span over 1.14 octaves from 1300 nm to\n2860 nm and 1.25 octaves from 1200 nm to 2870 nm at -20 dB level for the\ntapered and DM waveguides respectively, for a 2 $\\mu$m, 200 fs and 6.4 pJ input\npulse. The comparison of these two structures with the usually considered\noptimal fixed width waveguide shows that the SC is broader and flatter in the\nmore elaborated DM waveguide, while the high coherence is ensured by the\nvarying dispersion.\n", "  We consider two possible flat space limits of three dimensional $\\mathcal{N}\n= (1,1)$ AdS supergravity. They differ by how the supercharges are scaled with\nthe AdS radius $\\ell$: the first limit (democratic) leads to the usual\nsuper-Poincare theory, while a novel `twisted' theory of supergravity stems\nfrom the second (despotic) limit. We then propose boundary conditions such that\nthe asymptotic symmetry algebras at null infinity correspond to supersymmetric\nextensions of the BMS algebras previously derived in connection to non- and\nultra-relativistic limits of the $\\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ Virasoro algebra in two\ndimensions. Finally, we study the supersymmetric energy bounds and find the\nexplicit form of the asymptotic and global Killing spinors of supersymmetric\nsolutions in both flat space supergravity theories.\n", "  The scalar color octet contribution to the resonance $t\\bar{t}$-pair\nproduction at the LHC is calculated and analysed with account of the one loop\neffective two gluon vertex. It is shown that this contribution from the scalar\ncolor octet $F_2$ predicted by the minimal model with the four color\nquark-lepton symmetry is for $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV of about a few percents for $750\n< m_{F_2} < 1800$ GeV and can exceed 10% for $400 < m_{F_2} < 750$ GeV. It is\nalso pointed out that the search for the scalar octet $F_2$ as the resonance in\nthe dijet mass spectra seems to be difficult because of the smallness of its\none loop effective two gluon interaction.\n", "  There is a good cause to assert that the Easter Islanders constantly watched\nAldebaran and the Pleiades in the past. The Russian scholar Irina K. Fedorova\nand the American scholar Georgia Lee were the first who contributed\nsignificantly to the archaeoastronomical studies of these celestial bodies. I\nhave decoded the Mataveri calendar completely. The ceremonial platform Hekii 2\nwas oriented on Aldebaran and nearby stars. The disappearance of the Pleiades\nduring the dawn period in the north at the end of August could be an important\nmark before the arrival of sooty terns and before the elections of the next\nbird-man. The calculated dates of several solar eclipses have been used for\ncomposing the chronology of Easter Island from 1771 till 1867 A.D.\n", "  A diverse range of natural and artificial self-propelled particles are known\nand are used nowadays. Among them, active Brownian particles (ABPs) and\nrun-and-tumble particles (RTPs) are two important classes. We numerically study\nnon-interacting ABPs and RTPs strongly confined to different maze geometries in\ntwo dimensions. We demonstrate that by means of geometrical confinement alone,\nABPs are separable from RTPs. By investigating Matryoshka-like mazes with\nnested shells, we show that a circular maze has the best filtration efficiency.\nResults on the mean first-passage time reveal that ABPs escape faster from the\ncenter of the maze, while RTPs reach the center from the rim more easily.\nAccording to our simulations and a rate theory, which we developed, ABPs in\nsteady state accumulate in the outermost region of the Matryoshka-like mazes,\nwhile RTPs occupy all locations within the maze with nearly equal probability.\nThese results suggest a novel technique for separating different types of\nself-propelled particles by designing appropriate confining geometries without\nusing chemical or biological agents.\n", "  We build a model of metastable dark energy, in which the observed vacuum\nenergy is the value of the scalar potential at the false vacuum. The scalar\npotential is given by a sum of even self-interactions up to order six. The\ndeviation from the Minkowski vacuum is due to a term suppressed by the Planck\nscale. The decay time of the metastable vacuum can easily accommodate a mean\nlife time compatible with the age of the universe. The metastable dark energy\nis also embedded into a model with $SU(2)_R$ symmetry. The dark energy doublet\nand the dark matter doublet naturally interact with each other. A three-body\ndecay of the dark energy particle into (cold and warm) dark matter can be as\nlong as large fraction of the age of the universe, if the mediator is massive\nenough, the lower bound being at intermediate energy level some orders below\nthe grand unification scale. Such a decay shows a different form of interaction\nbetween dark matter and dark energy, and the model opens a new window to\ninvestigate the dark sector from the point-of-view of particle physics.\n", "  Following Dirac, the rules of canonical quantization include classical and\nquantum contact transformations of classical and quantum phase space variables.\nWhile arbitrary classical canonical coordinate transformations exist that is\nnot the case for some analogous quantum canonical coordinate transformations.\nThis failure is due to the rigid connection of quantum variables arising by\npromoting the corresponding classical variable from a $c$-number to a\n$q$-number. A different relationship of $c$-numbers and $q$-numbers in the\nprocedures of Enhanced Quantization shows the compatibility of all quantum\noperators with all classical canonical coordinate transformations.\n", "  We introduce a useful and rather simple classes of BKP tau functions which\nwhich we shall shall call \"easy tau functions\". We consider the \"large BKP\nhiearchy\" related to $O(2\\infty +1)$ which was introduced in \\cite{KvdLbispec}\n(which is closely related to the DKP $O(2\\infty) $hierarchy introduced in\n\\cite{JM}). Actually \"easy tau functions\" of the small BKP was already\nconsidered in \\cite{HLO}, here we are more interested in the large BKP and also\nthe mixed small-large BKP tau functions \\cite{KvdLbispec}. Tau functions under\nconsideration are equal to sums over partitions and to multi-integrals. In this\nway they may be appliciable in models of random partitions and models of random\nmatrices. Here in the part II we consider multi-intergals and series of $N$-ply\nintegrals in $N$. Relations to matrix models is explained. This paper may be\nviewed as a developement of the the paper by J.van de Leur \\cite{L1} related to\northogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices.\n", "  We investigate magnetic deflection of currents that flow across the\nAharonov-Bohm interferom- eters defined in graphene. We consider devices\ninduced by closed n-p junctions in nanoribbons as well as etched quantum rings.\nThe deflection effects on conductance are strictly correlated with the\nproperties of the ring-localized quasibound states. The energy of these states,\ntheir lifetime and the periodicity of the conductance oscillations are\ndetermined by orientation of the current circulating within the interferometer.\nFormation of high harmonics of conductance at high magnetic field and the role\nof intervalley scattering are discussed.\n", "  We introduce in this article a general formalism for Fourier based wave front\nsensing. To do so, we consider the filtering mask as a free parameter. Such an\napproach allows to unify sensors like the Pyramid Wave Front Sensor (PWFS) and\nthe Zernike Wave Front Sensor (ZWFS). In particular, we take the opportunity to\ngeneralize this two sensors in terms of sensors' class where optical quantities\nas, for instance, the apex angle for the PWFS or the depth of the Zernike mask\nfor the ZWFS become free parameters. In order to compare all the generated\nsensors of this two classes thanks to common performance criteria, we firstly\ndefine a general phase-linear quantity that we call meta-intensity. Analytical\ndevelopments allow then to split the perfectly phase-linear behavior of a WFS\nfrom the non-linear contributions making robust and analytic definitions of the\nsensitivity and the linearity range possible. Moreover, we define a new\nquantity called the SD factor which characterizes the trade-off between these\ntwo antagonist quantities. These developments are generalized for modulation\ndevice and polychromatic light. A non-exhaustive study is finally led on the\ntwo classes allowing to retrieve the usual results and also make explicit the\ninfluence of the optical parameters introduced above.\n", "  We have observed three luminous infrared galaxy systems (LIRGS) which are\npairs of interacting galaxies, with the Galaxy H$\\alpha$ Fabry-Perot system\n(GH$\\alpha$FaS) mounted on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope at the Roque de\nlos Muchachos Observatory, and combined the observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of these systems in CO emission to compare\nthe physical properties of the star formation regions and the molecular gas\nclouds, and specifically the internal kinematics of the star forming regions.\nWe identified 88 star forming regions in the H$\\alpha$ emission data-cubes, and\n27 molecular cloud complexes in the CO emission data-cubes. The surface\ndensities of the star formation rate and the molecular gas are significantly\nhigher in these systems than in non-interacting galaxies and the Galaxy, and\nare closer to the surface densities of the star formation rate and the\nmolecular gas of extreme star forming galaxies at higher redshifts. The large\nvalues of the velocity dispersion also show the enhanced gas surface density.\nThe HII regions are situated on the ${\\rm{SFR}}-\\sigma_v$ envelope, and so are\nalso in virial equilibrium. Since the virial parameter decreases with the\nsurface densities of both the star formation rate and the molecular gas, we\nclaim that the clouds presented here are gravitationally dominated rather than\nbeing in equilibrium with the external pressure.\n", "  We present results of a numerical analysis of magnon spectra in supercells\nsimulating two-dimensional and bulk random diluted ferromagnets with\nlong-ranged pair exchange interactions. We show that low-energy spectral\nregions for these strongly disordered systems contain a coherent component\nleading to interference phenomena manifested by a pronounced sensitivity of the\nlowest excitation energies to the adopted boundary conditions. The dependence\nof configuration averages of these excitation energies on the supercell size\ncan be used for an efficient determination of the spin-wave stiffness D. The\ndeveloped formalism is applied to the ferromagnetic Mn-doped GaAs semiconductor\nwith optional incorporation of phosphorus; the obtained concentration trends of\nD are found in reasonable agreement with recent experiments. Moreover, a\nrelation of the spin stiffness to the Curie temperature Tc has been studied for\nMn-doped GaAs and GaN semiconductors. It is found that the ratio Tc/D exhibits\nqualitatively the same dependence on Mn concentration in both systems.\n", "  Some theories predict that the filling factor 5/2 fractional quantum Hall\nstate can exhibit non-Abelian statistics, which makes it a candidate for\nfault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Although the non-Abelian\nPfaffian state and its particle-hole conjugate, the anti-Pfaffian state, are\nthe most plausible wave functions for the 5/2 state, there are a number of\nalternatives with either Abelian or non-Abelian statistics. Recent experiments\nsuggest that the tunneling exponents are more consistent with an Abelian state\nrather than a non-Abelian state. Here, we present edge-current-tunneling\nexperiments in geometrically confined quantum point contacts, which indicate\nthat Abelian and non-Abelian states compete at filling factor 5/2. Our results\nare consistent with a transition from an Abelian state to a non-Abelian state\nin a single quantum point contact when the confinement is tuned. Our\nobservation suggests that there is an intrinsic non-Abelian 5/2 ground state,\nbut that the appropriate confinement is necessary to maintain it. This\nobservation is important not only for understanding the physics of the 5/2\nstate, but also for the design of future topological quantum computation\ndevices.\n", "  Quantifying uncertainties in collective human behavior and decision making is\ncrucial for ensuring public health and safety, enabling effective disaster\nresponse, informing the design of transportation and communication networks,\nand guiding the development of new technologies. However, modeling and\npredicting such behavior is notoriously difficult, due to the influence of a\nvariety of complex factors such as the availability and uncertainty of\ninformation, the interaction and influence of social groups and networks, the\ndegree of risk or time pressure involved in a situation, and differences in\nindividual personalities and preferences. Here, we develop a stochastic model\nof human decision making to describe the empirical behavior of subjects in a\ncontrolled experiment simulating a natural disaster scenario. We compare the\nobserved behavior to that of statistically optimal Bayesian decision makers,\nquantifying the extent to which human decisions are optimal and identifying the\nconditions in which sub-optimal decisions are made. Finally, we investigate how\nhuman evacuation strategies change when decisions are made in groups under a\nvariety of different rules, and whether these group strategy adjustments are\noptimal or beneficial.\n", "  The focus of these lectures is on the quantum vacuum subjected to classical\nelectromagnetic fields. To this end we explicitly derive the renowned\nHeisenberg-Euler effective action in constant electromagnetic fields in a\nrather pedagogical and easy to conceive way. As an application, we use it to\nstudy vacuum birefringence constituting one of the most promising optical\nsignatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity.\n", "  We present subarcsecond images of submillimeter CO and continuum emission\nfrom a local galaxy forming massive star clusters: the blue compact dwarf\ngalaxy II Zw 40. At $\\sim$0.4\" resolution (20 pc), the CO(3-2), CO(1-0), 3mm\nand 870${\\mu}$m continuum maps illustrate star formation on the scales of\nindividual molecular clouds. Dust contributes about a third of the 870${\\mu}$m\ncontinuum emission, with free-free accounting for the rest. On these scales,\nthere is not a good correspondence between gas, dust, and free-free emission.\nDust continuum is enhanced toward the star-forming region as compared to the CO\nemission. We suggest that an unexpectedly low and spatially variable\ngas-to-dust ratio is the result of massive clusters of the starburst.\n", "  After some personal recollectioms about Rudolf Haag and his thoughts which\nled him to \"Local Quantum Physics\", the present work recalls his ideas about\nscattering theory, the relation between local observables and localized fields\nand his contributions to the physical aspects of modular operator theory which\npaved the way for an intrisic understanding of quantum causal localization in\nwhich fields \"coordinatize\" the local algebras. The paper ends with the\npresentation of string-local fields whose construction and use in a new\nrenormalization theory for higher spin fields is part of an ongoing\nreformulation of gauge theory in the conceptual setting of Haag's LQP.\n", "  Starting with a general discussion, a program is sketched for a quantization\nbased on dilations. This resolving-power quantization is simplest for scalar\nfield theories. The hope is to find a way to relax the requirement of locality\nso that the necessity to fine tune mass parameters is eliminated while\nuniversality is still preserved.\n", "  We construct an irreducible s- and t-channel tensor basis for Bhabha\nscattering like amplitudes based on the properties of the underlying Lorentz\nsymmetry in four space-time dimensions. In the given basis the calculation of\namplitude contractions like the amplitude square reduces to the contraction of\ntheir corresponding coefficient tensors. Further the basis retains the full\namplitude information and thus can be applied in off-shell cases. The general\nFierz transformations which relate the s- and t-channel basis with each other\nare obtained. As an example for application we use the basis to calculate the\ntree-level Bhabha scattering amplitude.\n", "  We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with two-dimensional\ntantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room\ntemperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices\nconnected in series. Such a cell has constant output and oscillatory states.\nAll cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through\nthe cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias\nvoltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing\nto the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two\n1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase where one of the devices is in the\ninsulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The\nnearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are\nresistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the On state while they\nare capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation\nof the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30x30 node\nnetwork. The results of our numerical modeling show the formation of artificial\nvortexes and cellular-automata type data processing. The two-dimensional\n1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of\nproperties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast\nsynchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for\nboth consumer electronic and defense applications.\n", "  Following [OW16], we continue our analysis of: (1) \"Quantum tomography\",\ni.e., learning a quantum state, i.e., the quantum generalization of learning a\ndiscrete probability distribution; (2) The distribution of Young diagrams\noutput by the RSK algorithm on random words. Regarding (2), we introduce two\npowerful new tools: (i) A precise upper bound on the expected length of the\nlongest union of $k$ disjoint increasing subsequences in a random length-$n$\nword with letter distribution $\\alpha_1 \\geq \\alpha_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq\n\\alpha_d$; (ii) A new majorization property of the RSK algorithm that allows\none to analyze the Young diagram formed by the lower rows $\\lambda_k,\n\\lambda_{k+1}, \\dots$ of its output.\n  These tools allow us to prove several new theorems concerning the\ndistribution of random Young diagrams in the nonasymptotic regime, giving\nconcrete error bounds that are optimal, or nearly so, in all parameters. As one\nexample, we give a fundamentally new proof of the fact that the expected length\nof the longest increasing sequence in a random length-$n$ permutation is\nbounded by $2\\sqrt{n}$. This is the $k = 1$, $\\alpha_i \\equiv \\frac1d$, $d \\to\n\\infty$ special case of a much more general result we prove: the expected\nlength of the $k$th Young diagram row produced by an $\\alpha$-random word is\n$\\alpha_k n \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\alpha_kd n}$.\n  From our new analyses of random Young diagrams we derive several new results\nin quantum tomography, including: (i) Learning the eigenvalues of an unknown\nstate to $\\epsilon$-accuracy in Hellinger-squared, chi-squared, or KL distance,\nusing $n = O(d^2/\\epsilon)$ copies; (ii) Learning the optimal rank-$k$\napproximation of an unknown state to $\\epsilon$-fidelity (Hellinger-squared\ndistance) using $n = \\widetilde{O}(kd/\\epsilon)$ copies.\n", "  A two-dimensional phononic crystal (PC) can exhibit longitudinal-mode\nnegative energy refraction on its lowest (acoustical) frequency pass band. The\neffective elastodynamic properties of a typical PC are calculated and it is\nobserved that the components of the effective density tensor can achieve\nnegative values at certain low frequencies on the acoustical branches for the\nlongitudinal-mode pass-band, and that negative refraction may be accompanied by\neither positive or negative effective density. Furthermore, such a PC has a\nhigh anisotropy ratio at certain low frequencies, offering potential for\napplication to acoustic cloaking where effective material anisotropy is\nessential.\n", "  The effective bandwidth of an energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence\nspectroscopy system is limited by the timing of incident photons. When multiple\nphotons strike the detector within the processing time of the detector photon\npile-up occurs and the signal received by the detector during this interval\nmust be ignored. In conventional ED-XRF systems the probability of a photon\nbeing incident upon the detector is uniform over time, and thus pile-up follows\nPoisson statistics. In this paper we present a mathematical treatment of the\nrelationship between photon timing statistics and the count rate of an XRF\nsystem. We show that it is possible to increase the maximum count rates by\napplying feedback from the detector to the x-ray source to alter the timing\nstatistics of photon emission. Monte-Carlo simulations, show that this\ntechnique can increase the maximum count rate of an XRF spectroscopy system by\na factor of 2.94 under certain circumstances.\n", "  We constrain the average density profile of the proton and the amount of\nevent-by-event fluctuations by simultaneously calculating the coherent and\nincoherent exclusive diffractive vector meson production cross section in deep\ninelastic scattering. Working within the Color Glass Condensate picture, we\nfind that the gluonic density of the proton must have large geometric\nfluctuations in order to describe the experimentally measured large incoherent\ncross section.\n", "  In this paper we study the presence of irregularities and scintillation in\nrelation to the nightside part of a long-lived, Sun-aligned transpolar arc on\n15 January 2015. The arc was observed in DMSP UV and particle data and lasted\nat least 3 h between 1700 and 2000 UT. The arc was more intense than the main\noval during this time. From all-sky imagers on Svalbard we were able to study\nthe evolution of the arc, which drifted slowly westward toward the dusk cell.\nThe intensity of the arc as observed from ground was 10-17 kR in 557.7 nm and\n2-3.5 kR in 630.0 nm, i.e., significant emissions in both green and red\nemission lines. We have used high-resolution raw data from global navigation\nsatellite systems (GNSS) receivers and backscatter from Super Dual Auroral\nRadar Network (SuperDARN) radars to study irregularities and scintillation in\nrelation to the polar cap arc. Even though the literature has suggested that\npolar cap arcs are potential sources for irregularities, our results indicate\nonly very weak irregularities. This may be due to the background density in the\nnorthward IMF polar cap being too low for significant irregularities to be\ncreated.\n", "  A continuum limit treatment of planar spin chains with arbitrary S is\npresented. The difference between integer and half-integer spins is emphasised.\nWhile isotropic half-integer spin chains are gapless,and have power-law decay\nof correlations at T = 0 with exponent eta = 1, integer spin systems have a\nsinglet ground state with a gap for S=1 excitations and exponential decay of\ncorrelations. The easy-plane to easy-axis transition is described.\n  Note: this is a verbatim transcription of ILL preprint SP-81/95, which is\ncited in a number of places, but was rejected for publication in 1981, and\nremained unpublished in this original form, which gives somewhat different\narguments for the central result as compared to the later paper finally\npublished in Phys. Lett. 93A, 464 (1983); many thanks to Jeno Solyom for\npreserving this historical document.\n", "  A short autobiography written for a centennial party.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have recently\nattracted attention due to their superlative optical and electronic properties.\nIn particular, their extraordinary optical absorption and semiconducting band\ngap have enabled demonstrations of photovoltaic response from heterostructures\ncomposed of TMDCs and other organic or inorganic materials. However, these\nearly studies were limited to devices at the micrometer scale and/or failed to\nexploit the unique optical absorption properties of single-layer TMDCs. Here we\npresent an experimental realization of a large-area type-II photovoltaic\nheterojunction using single-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) as the primary\nabsorber, by coupling it to the organic {\\pi}-donor polymer PTB7. This\nTMDC-polymer heterojunction exhibits photoluminescence intensity that is\ntunable as a function of the thickness of the polymer layer, ultimately\nenabling complete quenching of the TMDC photoluminescence. The strong optical\nabsorption in the TMDC-polymer heterojunction produces an internal quantum\nefficiency exceeding 40% for an overall cell thickness of less than 20 nm,\nresulting in exceptional current density per absorbing thickness in comparison\nto other organic and inorganic solar cells. Furthermore, this work provides new\ninsight into the recombination processes in type-II TMDC-polymer\nheterojunctions and thus provides quantitative guidance to ongoing efforts to\nrealize efficient TMDC-based solar cells.\n", "  I review some of the lattice results on spectroscopy and resonances in the\npast years. For the conventional hadron spectrum computations, focus has been\nput on the isospin breaking effects, QED effects, and simulations near the\nphysical pion mass point. I then go through several single-channel scattering\nstudies within L\\\"uscher formalism, a method that has matured over the past few\nyears. The topics cover light mesons and also the charmed mesons, with the\nlatter case intimately related to the recently discovered exotic $XYZ$\nparticles. Other possible related formalisms that are available on the market\nare also discussed.\n", "  It is of broad interest to understand how the evolution of non-equilibrium\nsystems can be triggered and the role played by external perturbations. A\nfamous example is the origin of randomness in the laminar-turbulence\ntransition, which is raised in the pipe flow experiment by Reynolds as a\ncentury old unresolved problem. Although there exist different hypotheses, it\nis widely believed that the randomness is \"intrinsic\", which, however, remains\nas an open question to be verified. Simulating the modeled Rayleigh-Benard\nconvection system by means of the so-called clean numerical simulation (CNS)\nwith negligible numerical noises that are smaller even than thermal\nfluctuation, we verify that turbulence can be self-excited from the inherent\nthermal fluctuation, without any external disturbances, i.e. out of nothing.\nThis reveals a relationship between microscopic physical uncertainty and\nmacroscopic randomness. It is found that in physics the system nonlinearity\nfunctions as a channel for randomness information, and energy as well, to\ntransport microscopic uncertainty toward large scales. Such scenario can\ngenerally be helpful to understand the various relevant phenomena. In\nmethodology, compared with direct numerical simulation (DNS), CNS opens a new\ndirection to investigate turbulent flows with largely improved accuracy and\nreliability.\n", "  Three dimensional nonlinear wave interactions have been analytically\ndescribed. The procedure under interest can be applied to three dimensional\nquasilinear systems of first order, whose hydrodynamic reductions are\nhomogeneous semi-Hamiltonian hydrodynamic type systems (i.e. possess a diagonal\nform and infinitely many conservation laws). The interaction of N waves was\nstudied. In particular we prove that they behave like simple waves and they\ndistort after the collision region. The amount of the distortion can be\nanalytically computed.\n", "  The works of Rabindranath Tagore have been sung by various artistes over\ngenerations spanning over almost 100 years. there are few songs which were\npopular in the early years and have been able to retain their popularity over\nthe years while some others have faded away. In this study we look to find cues\nfor the singing style of these songs which have kept them alive for all these\nyears. For this we took 3 min clip of four Tagore songs which have been sung by\nfive generation of artistes over 100 years and analyze them with the help of\nlatest nonlinear techniques Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\n(MFDFA). The multifractal spectral width is a manifestation of the inherent\ncomplexity of the signal and may prove to be an important parameter to identify\nthe singing style of particular generation of singers and how this style varies\nover different generations. The results are discussed in detail.\n", "  In North Indian Classical Music, raga forms the basic structure over which\nindividual improvisations is performed by an artist based on his/her\ncreativity. The Alap is the opening section of a typical Hindustani Music (HM)\nperformance, where the raga is introduced and the paths of its development are\nrevealed using all the notes used in that particular raga and allowed\ntransitions between them with proper distribution over time. In India,\ncorresponding to each raga, several emotional flavors are listed, namely erotic\nlove, pathetic, devotional, comic, horrific, repugnant, heroic, fantastic,\nfurious, peaceful. The detection of emotional cues from Hindustani Classical\nmusic is a demanding task due to the inherent ambiguity present in the\ndifferent ragas, which makes it difficult to identify any particular emotion\nfrom a certain raga. In this study we took the help of a high resolution\nmathematical microscope (MFDFA or Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis)\nto procure information about the inherent complexities and time series\nfluctuations that constitute an acoustic signal. With the help of this\ntechnique, 3 min alap portion of six conventional ragas of Hindustani classical\nmusic namely, Darbari Kanada, Yaman, Mian ki Malhar, Durga, Jay Jayanti and\nHamswadhani played in three different musical instruments were analyzed. The\nresults are discussed in detail.\n", "  We study the proton-neutron RPA with an extended Lipikin-Meshkov-Glick model.\nWe pay attention to the effect of correlated ground state and the case in which\nneutron and proton numbers are different. The effect of the correlated ground\nstate are tested on the basis of quasi-boson approximation. We obtain the\nresult that RPA excitation energies and transition strengths are in a good\nagreement with the exact solution up to a certain strength of the\nparticle-particle interaction. However, the transition strength becomes worse\nif we consider the case in which neutron and proton numbers are different even\nat a weak particle-particle interaction.\n", "  We have performed electronic state calculations to clarify the initial stage\nof the oxidation of the Si- and C-faces in 4H-SiC based on the\ndensity-functional theory. We investigate how each Si and C atomic site is\noxidized on C- and Si-face, and explore most probable reaction pathways,\ncorresponding energy barriers, and possible defects generated during the\noxidation. We have found that carbon annihilation process is different between\non Si- and on C-face, and this difference causes different defects in\ninterface; In C-face case, (1), carbon atoms are dissociated directly from the\nsubstrate as CO molecules. (2), after CO dissociation, 3-fold coordinated\noxygen atoms (called Y-lid) are observed at the interface. (3), high density of\nC-dangling bonds can remain at the interface. In Si-face case, (1), C atoms\ninevitably form carbon nano clusters (composed of a few atoms) in interface to\nreduce the number of dangling bonds there. Moreover, we have found that the\ncarbon nano clusters are composed of not only single but also double chemical\nbonds. (2), We have observed that CO molecules are dissociated from the carbon\nnano clusters in MD simulations. Furthermore, we have investigated whether\nH$_2$ and NO molecules react with the defects found in this study.\n", "  For elliptic in the half-space and parabolic degenerating on the boundary\nequation of Keldysh type we construct by similarity method the self-similar\nsolution, which is the approximation to the identity in the class of integrable\nfunctions. This solution is the fundamental solution of the Dirichlet problem,\ni.e. the solution of the Dirichlet problem with the Dirac delta-function in the\nboundary condition. Solution of the Dirichlet problem with an arbitrary\nfunction in the boundary condition can be written as the convolution of the\nfunction with the fundamental solution of the Dirichlet problem, if a\nconvolution exists. For a bounded and piecewise continuous boundary function\nconvolution exists and is written in the form of an integral, which gives the\nclassical solution of the Dirichlet problem, and is a generalization of the\nPoisson integral for the Laplace equation. If the boundary function is a\ngeneralized function, the convolution is a generalized solution of the\nDirichlet problem.\n", "  A three level quantum system interacting with nonequilibrium environment is\ninvestigated. The stationary state of the system is found (both for\nnon-coherent and coherent environment) and relaxation and decoherence to the\nstationary state is described. The stationary state of the system will be\nnon-equilibrium and will generate flows. We describe the dependence of the\nflows on the state of the environment.\n  We also discuss application of this model to the problem of quantum\nphotosynthesis, in particular, to description of flows of excitons and\ngeneration of excitonic coherences.\n", "  Large scale chromomagnetic, B_3, B_8, and usual magnetic,H, fields have to be\ngenerated in QCD after the deconfinement phase transition (DPT) at temperatures\nT larger than deconfinement temperature T_d. The two former fields are created\nspontaneously due to asymptotic freedom of gluon intaractions. Whereas H is\nproduced due to either the feature of quarks to possess both electric and color\ncharges or a vacuum polarization in this case. At the polarization, the vacuum\nquark loops mix the external fields. As a result, B_3, B_8 become the sources\ngenerating H. The latter field appears at $T$ much lower than the electroweak\nphase transition temperature T_ew. This mechanism should exhibit itself at the\nLHC experiments on heavy ion collisions. It operates at the one-loop diagram\nlevel for an effective potential. The created fields are temperature dependent\nand occupying the macroscopic volume of quark-gluon plasma. The magnetization\ninfluences different processes and may serve as a signal for the DPT.\n", "  In this paper, we develop an agent-based version of the Diamond search\nequilibrium model - also called Coconut Model. In this model, agents are faced\nwith production decisions that have to be evaluated based on their expectations\nabout the future utility of the produced entity which in turn depends on the\nglobal production level via a trading mechanism. While the original dynamical\nsystems formulation assumes an infinite number of homogeneously adapting agents\nobeying strong rationality conditions, the agent-based setting allows to\ndiscuss the effects of heterogeneous and adaptive expectations and enables the\nanalysis of non-equilibrium trajectories. Starting from a baseline\nimplementation that matches the asymptotic behavior of the original model, we\nshow how agent heterogeneity can be accounted for in the aggregate dynamical\nequations. We then show that when agents adapt their strategies by a simple\ntemporal difference learning scheme, the system converges to one of the fixed\npoints of the original system. Systematic simulations reveal that this is the\nonly stable equilibrium solution.\n", "  Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely used organosilicon polymer often\nemployed in formulations with fine oxide particles for various high temperature\napplications. Although PDMS is considered to be thermally stable and chemically\ninert, it is not always clear how the oxide filler influences its\nthermoresistance, decomposition chemistry and what reactive products are formed\nin the underlying thermal reactions. In this work we use temperature programmed\ndesorption mass spectrometry (TPD MS) to study the pyrolysis of PDMS and its\ncomposites with nanosized silica and ceria/silica. Our results suggest that the\nelusive organosilicon compound - dimethylsilanone is generated from PDMS over a\nbroad temperature range (in some cases starting at 70${\\deg}$C). The presence\nof nano-oxides catalyzed this process. Ions characteristic of the fragmentation\nof dimethylsilanone under electron ionization were assigned with the aid of DFT\nstructure calculations. Possible reaction mechanisms for generating\ndimethylsilanone were discussed in the context of the calculated kinetic\nparameters. Observed accompanying products of PDMS pyrolysis, such as\ntetramethylcyclodisiloxane and hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, indicate that\nmultiple channels are involved in the dimethylsilanone release.\n", "  Massive galaxy clusters are the most violent large scale structures\nundergoing merger events in the Universe. Based upon their morphological\nproperties in X-rays, they are classified as un-relaxed and relaxed clusters\nand often host (a fraction of them) different types of non-thermal radio\nemitting components, viz., haloes, mini-haloes, relics and phoenix within their\nIntra Cluster Medium (ICM). The radio haloes show steep (alpha = -1.2) and\nultra steep (alpha < -1.5) spectral properties at low radio frequencies, giving\nimportant insights on the merger (pre or post) state of the cluster. Ultra\nsteep spectrum radio halo emissions are rare and expected to be the dominating\npopulation to be discovered via LOFAR and SKA in the future. Further, the\ndistribution of matter (morphological information), alignment of hot X-ray\nemitting gas from the ICM with the total mass (dark + baryonic matter) and the\nbright cluster galaxy (BCG) is generally used to study the dynamical state of\nthe cluster. We present here a multi wavelength study on 14 massive clusters\nfrom the CLASH survey and show the correlation between the state of their\nmerger in X-ray and spectral properties (1.4 GHz - 150 MHz) at radio\nwavelengths. Using the optical data we also discuss about the gas-mass\nalignment, in order to understand the interplay between dark and baryonic\nmatter in massive galaxy clusters.\n", "  Plasma dipole oscillation (PDO) depicted as harmonic motion of a spatially\nlocalized block of electrons has, until now, been hypothetical. In practice,\nthe plasma oscillation occurs always as a part of a plasma wave. Studies on\nradiation burst from plasmas have focused only on coupling of the plasma wave\nand electromagnetic wave. Here we show that a very-high-field PDO can be\ngenerated by the electrons trapped in a moving train of potential wells. The\nelectrons riding on the potential train coherently construct a local dipole\nmoment by charge separation. The subsequent PDO is found to persist stably\nuntil its energy is emitted entirely via coherent radiation. In our novel\nmethod, the moving potentials are provided by two slightly-detuned laser pulses\ncolliding in a non-magnetized plasma. The radiated energy reaches several\nmillijoules in the terahertz spectral region. The proposed method provides a\nway of realizing the PDO as a new radiation source in the laboratory. PDO as a\nmechanism of astrophysical radio-bursts is discussed.\n", "  This is a Commentary in $Physics~Today$ on the novel review process developed\nby the biology journal $eLife$, with the suggestion that it be adopted by\nphysics journals.\n", "  This work reexamines the dynamics of the 5:2 mean motion resonance with\nJupiter located in the Outer Belt at $a\\sim 2.82$ AU. First, we compute\ndynamical maps revealing the precise structure of chaos inside the resonance.\nBeing interested to verify the chaotic structures as sources of natural\ntransportation routes, we additionally integrate 1000 massless particles\ninitially placed along them and follow their orbital histories up to 5 Myr. As\nmany as 99.5\\% of our test particles became Near-Earth Objects, 23.4\\% migrated\nto semi-major axis below 1 AU and more than 57\\% entered the Hill sphere of\nEarth. We have also observed a borderline defined by the $q \\simeq 2.6$ AU\nperihelion distance along which particles escape from the Solar System.\n", "  In our contribution we give a brief overview of two widely discussed quantum\nprocesses: electron-positron pairs production off a probe photon propagating\nthrough a polarized short-pulsed electromagnetic (e.m.) (e.g.\\ laser) wave\nfield or generalized Breit-Wheeler process and a single a photon emission off\nan electron interacting with the laser pules, so-called non-linear Compton\nscattering. We show that at small and moderate laser field intensities the\nshape and duration of the pulse are very important for the probability of\nconsidered processes. However, at high intensities the multi-photon\ninteractions of the fermions with laser field are decisive and completely\ndetermined all aspects of subthreshold electron-positron pairs and photon\nproduction\n", "  The Hungaria Family (the closest region of the Main Belt to Mars) is an\nimportant source of Planet-Crossing-Asteroids and even impactors of terrestrial\nplanets. We present the possibility that asteroids coming from the Hungaria\nFamily get captured into co-orbital motion with the terrestrial planets in the\ninner solar system. Therefore we carried out long term numerical integrations\n(up to 100 Myr) to analyze the migrations from their original location - the\nHungaria family region- into the inner solar system. During the integration\ntime we observed whether or not the Hungarias get captured into a co-orbital\nmotion with the terrestrial planets. Our results show that 5.5% of 200\nHungarias, selected as a sample of the whole group, escape from the Hungaria\nregion and the probability from that to become co-orbital objects (Trojans,\nsatellites or horseshoes) turns out to be about 3.3%: 1.8% for Mars and 1.5%\nfor the Earth. In addition, we distinguished in which classes of co-orbital\nmotion the asteroids get captured and for how long they stay there in stable\nmotion. Most of the escaped Hungarias become Quasi-satellites and the ones\ncaptured as Trojans favor the L_5 lagrangian point. This work highlights that\nthe Hungaria region is a source of Mars and also Earth co-orbital objects.\n", "  The strong-coupling expansion of the lattice gauge action leads to\nPolyakov-loop models that effectively describe gluodynamics at low\ntemperatures, and together with the hopping expansion of the fermion\ndeterminant provides insight into the QCD phase diagram at finite density and\nlow temperatures, although for rather heavy quarks. At higher temperatures the\nstrong-coupling expansion breaks down and it is expected that the interactions\nbetween Polyakov loops become non-local. Here, we therefore test how well pure\nSU(2) gluodynamics can be mapped onto different non-local Polyakov models with\ninverse Monte-Carlo methods. We take into account Polyakov loops in higher\nrepresentations and gradually add interaction terms at larger distances. We are\nparticularly interested in extrapolating the range of non-local terms in\nsufficiently large volumes and higher representations. We study the\ncharacteristic fall-off in strength of the non-local couplings with the\ninteraction distance, and its dependence on the gauge coupling in order to\ncompare our results to existing proposals for non-local effective actions.\n", "  The mechanisms promoting scalar dissipation through scalar gradient\nproduction are scrutinized in terms of vorticity alignment with respect to\nstrain principal axes. For that purpose, a stochastic Lagrangian model for the\nvelocity gradient tensor and the scalar gradient vector is used. The model\nresults show that the major part of scalar dissipation occurs for stretched\nvorticity, namely when the vorticity vector aligns with the extensional and\nintermediate strain eigenvectors. More specifically, it appears that the mean\nscalar dissipation is well represented by the sample defined by alignment with\nthe extensional strain, while the most intense scalar dissipation is promoted\nby the set of events for which vorticity aligns with the intermediate strain.\nThis difference is explained by rather subtle mechanisms involving the\nstatistics of both the strain intensities and the scalar gradient alignment\nresulting from these special alignments of vorticity. The analysis allowing for\nthe local flow structure confirms the latter scenario for both the strain-and\nrotation-dominated events. However, despite the prevailing role of strain in\npromoting scalar dissipation, the difference in the level of scalar dissipation\nwhen vorticity aligns with either the extensional or the intermediate strain\nmostly arises from rotation-dominated events.\n", "  I have shown conceptually that quantum state has a direct relationship to\ngravitational constant due to entropic force posed by Verlinde's argument and\npart of the Newton-Schr\\\"odinger equation (N-S) in the context of gravity\ninduced collapse of the wavefunction via Di\\'osi-Penrose proposal. This direct\nrelationship can be used to measure gravitational constant using\nstate-of-the-art mater-wave interferometry to test the entropic gravity\nargument.\n", "  Long-slit spectroscopy with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) of\ncentral stars of mid-infrared nebulae detected with the Spitzer Space Telescope\nand Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) led to the discovery of numerous\ncandidate luminous blue variables (cLBVs) and other rare evolved massive stars.\nWith the recent advent of the SALT fibre-fed high-resolution echelle\nspectrograph (HRS), a new perspective for the study of these interesting\nobjects is appeared. Using the HRS we obtained spectra of a dozen newly\nidentified massive stars. Some results on the recently identified cLBV Hen\n3-729 are presented.\n", "  The present paper aims to complete an earlier paper where the acoustic world\nwas introduced. This is accomplished by analyzing the interactions which occur\nbetween the inhomogeneities of the acoustic medium, which are induced by the\nacoustic vibrations traveling in the medium. When a wave packet travels in a\nmedium, the medium becomes inhomogeneous. The spherical wave packet behaves\nlike an acoustic spherical lens for the acoustic plane waves. According to the\nprinciple of causality, there is an interaction between the wave and plane wave\npacket. In specific conditions the wave packet behaves as an acoustic black\nhole.\n", "  We present exact analytical solutions for charge transfer reactions between\ntwo arbitrarily charged hard dielectric spheres. These solutions, and the\ncorresponding exact ones for sphere-sphere interaction energies, include sums\nthat describe polarization effects to infinite orders in the inverse of the\ndistance between the sphere centers. In addition, we show that these exact\nsolutions may be approximated by much simpler analytical expressions that are\nuseful for many practical applications. This is exemplified through\ncalculations of Langevin type cross sections for forming a compound system of\ntwo colliding spheres and through calculations of electron transfer cross\nsections. We find that it is important to account for dielectric properties and\nfinite sphere sizes in such calculations, which for example may be useful for\ndescribing the evolution, growth, and dynamics of nanometer sized dielectric\nobjects such as molecular clusters or dust grains in different environments\nincluding astrophysical ones.\n", "  The variation of energies associated with soft matter interfaces where\nsurface inhomogeneities are present. These energies include the total bending\nand splay energy, the variable surface tension energy, a coupling energy\nbetween the total curvature and an underlying surface concentration field, the\nenergy due to an external field, and a phase segregation energy. When\nconsidering these energies the variation of material properties such a bending\nrigidity are taken into account, which results in more general variation\nexpressions. These variations can be used to determine the equilibrium\ninterface and concentration configuration or to determine the driving forces\nfor non-equilibrium situations. While the focus of this work are energies\nassociated with multicomponent vesicles, it can easily be extended to any soft\nmatter interface.\n", "  The IVOA Data Access Layer (DAL) working group was created in 2002 to define\nprotocols to homogenize data discovery, data description, data retrieval, and\ndata access processes. We describe its history and status today, and look at\ncurrent trends for future development of the DAL protocols.\n", "  In this paper we study FRW bulk viscous cosmology in presence of modified\nChaplygin gas. We write modified Friedmann equations due to bulk viscosity and\nChaplygin gas and obtain time-dependent energy density for the special case of\nflat space.\n", "  We present a method of calibrating the properties of photometric redshift\nbins as part of a larger Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for the\ninference of cosmological parameters. The redshift bins are characterised by\ntheir mean and variance, which are varied as free parameters and marginalised\nover when obtaining the cosmological parameters. We demonstrate that the\nlikelihood function for cross-correlations in an angular power spectrum\nframework tightly constrains the properties of bins such that they may be well\ndetermined, reducing their influence on cosmological parameters and avoiding\nthe bias from poorly estimated redshift distributions. We demonstrate that even\nwith only three photometric and three spectroscopic bins, we can recover\naccurate estimates of the mean redshift of a bin to within $\\Delta\\mu \\approx\n3-4 \\times10^{-3}$ and the width of the bin to $\\Delta\\sigma \\approx\n1\\times10^{-3}$ for galaxies near $z = 1$. This indicates that we may be able\nto bring down the photometric redshift errors to a level which is in line with\nthe requirements for the next generation of cosmological experiments.\n", "  A simple application of classical density functional theory is derived and\napplied to a system of polymers grafted to a plane. The system is assumed to\nhave symmetry in directions parallel to the grafting plane hence it being a\n'1-dimensional' problem. A quick introduction to using propagators in the\ntheory of chains in the presence of external fields and a numerical algorithm\nfor solving the modified diffusion (or Fokker-Planck) equation are presented.\nDensity profiles are found for hard-sphere chains which agree with results in\nthe literature (see Murat,.., Milner,.., Muhukumar and others) and align with\nphysical expectations of brush formation due to excluded volume. The linear\nscaling $h \\approx (\\sigma)^{1/3} N$, of brush height with polymerisation $N$,\nis reproduced here.\n", "  Ultrafast laser experiments yield increasingly reliable data on warm dense\nmatter, but their interpretation requires theoretical models. We employ an\nefficient density functional neutral-pseudoatom hypernetted-chain (NPA-HNC)\nmodel with accuracy comparable to ab initio simulations and which provides\nfirst-principles pseudopotentials and pair-potentials for warm-dense matter. It\navoids the use of (i) ad hoc core-repulsion models and (ii) \"Yukawa screening\",\nand (iii) need not assume ionelectron thermal equilibrium. Computations of the\nx-Ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectra of aluminum and beryllium are compared\nwith recent experiments and with density-functional-theory molecular-dynamics\n(DFT-MD) simulations. The NPA-HNC structure factors, compressibilities, phonons\nand conductivities agree closely with DFT-MD results, while Yukawa screening\ngives misleading results. The analysis of the XRTS data for two of the\nexperiments, using two-temperature quasi-equilibrium models, is supported by\ncalculations of their temperature relaxation times.\n", "  Non linear fiber optics concerns with the non linear optical phenomena\noccurring inside optical fibers. The propagation of light in single-mode fibers\nis governed by the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) in\nthe presence of attenuation, dispersion, and non linear effects. In this NLS\nthe role of space and time is exchanged with respect to the standard NLS as\nintroduced in the almost entire mathematical literature. Such an exchange is\nfar from being only formal as it enters in the interpretation of basic ideas as\nwell-posedness and stability, as well as in the phenomenological meaning of the\npredictions formulated by such model. In this dissertation, the physical bases\nof the optical fibers are provided, and a derivation of the NLS from the\nMaxwell's equations is reviewed. Furthermore, problems of local nature (local\nexistence of solutions, uniqueness) and problems of global nature (global\nexistence) are studied by the Kato's method based on a fixed point argument and\nStrichartz's estimates. Moreover, tools usually employed to study global\nproblems connected with finite-time blow up of solutions, are here used to show\na closeness result between the NLS for optical fibers and an integrable NLS.\nIntegrability is pursued by means of the Painlev\\'e analysis that allows to\ndescribe quite a large class of integrable equations like the transformed\nequation from the standard NLS. Among these functions, one can be described as\na standard NLS with an additional linear harmonic oscillator term. This\nequation is showed to be close in $L^2$-norm to the NLS for single-mode fibers.\nFinally, the dissertation focuses on two kinds of stationary solutions: the\nso-called time-homogenous, that is given by a stationary wave oscillating in\nspace, and the soliton-like solution. Results are obtained about stability\nproperties of them.\n", "  Despite the exponential growth in computing resources and the availability of\na myriad of different theoretical water models, an accurate, yet\ncomputationally efficient molecular level description of mesoscopic grain\ngrowth remains a grand challenge. The underlying phase transitions and\ndynamical processes in deeply supercooled systems are often rendered\ninaccessible due to limitations imposed by system sizes and timescales, which\nis further compounded by their sluggish kinetics. Here, we introduce a\nmachine-learned, bond-order-based potential model (BOP) that more accurately\ndescribes the anomalous behavior, as well as structural and thermodynamical\nproperties of both liquid water and ice, with at least two orders of magnitude\ncheaper computational cost than existing atomistic water models. In a\nsignificant departure from conventional force-field fitting, we use a\nmultilevel evolutionary strategy that trains the BOP model against not just\nenergetics but temperature dependent properties inferred from on-the-fly\nmolecular dynamics simulations as well. We use the BOP model to probe the\nhomogeneous ice nucleation and growth process by performing molecular dynamics\non multi-million molecule systems for up to microsecond time scales. These\nmassively parallel, long-time simulations naturally capture the competition\nbetween cubic, hexagonal, and stacking disordered ice phases during nucleation\nand early stages of growth leading to the formation of nanometer sized grains.\nSubsequently, we elucidate the hitherto elusive mechanism of grain coarsening\nof the crystallized mixed ice phases, which occur through grain dissolution and\nOstwald ripening followed by grain boundary migration.\n", "  Constrained mean-field calculations, based on the Gogny-D1M energy density\nfunctional, have been carried out to describe fission in the isotopes\n$^{250-260}$No. The even-even isotopes have been considered within the standard\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliobov (HFB) framework while for the odd-mass ones the Equal\nFilling Approximation (HFB-EFA) has been employed. Ground state quantum numbers\nand deformations, pairing energies, one-neutron separation energies, inner and\nouter barrier heights as well as fission isomer excitation energies are given.\nFission paths, collective masses and zero-point quantum vibrational and\nrotational corrections are used to compute the systematic of the spontaneous\nfission half-lives t$_\\mathrm{SF}$ both for even-even and odd-mass nuclei.\nThough there exists a strong variance of the predicted fission rates with\nrespect to the details involved in their computation, it is shown that both the\nspecialization energy and the pairing quenching effects, taken into account\nwithin the self-consistent HFB-EFA blocking procedure, lead to larger\nt$_\\mathrm{SF}$ values in odd-mass nuclei as compared with their even-even\nneighbors. Alpha decay lifetimes have also been computed using a\nparametrization of the Viola-Seaborg formula. The high quality of the Gogny-D1M\nfunctional regarding nuclear masses leads to a very good reproduction of\n$Q_{\\alpha}$ values and consequently of lifetimes.\n", "  The largest galaxies in the Universe reside in galaxy clusters. Using\nsensitive observations of carbon-monoxide, we show that the Spiderweb Galaxy -a\nmassive galaxy in a distant protocluster- is forming from a large reservoir of\nmolecular gas. Most of this molecular gas lies between the protocluster\ngalaxies and has low velocity dispersion, indicating that it is part of an\nenriched inter-galactic medium. This may constitute the reservoir of gas that\nfuels the widespread star formation seen in earlier ultraviolet observations of\nthe Spiderweb Galaxy. Our results support the notion that giant galaxies in\nclusters formed from extended regions of recycled gas at high redshift.\n", "  The thermodynamic dislocation theory presented in preceding papers is used\nhere to describe shear-banding instabilities. Central ingredients of the theory\nare a thermodynamically defined effective configurational temperature, and a\nformula for the plastic deformation rate determined by thermally activated\ndepinning of entangled dislocations. An important feature of this paper is an\ninterpretation of yielding transitions in polycrystalline solids.\n", "  In previous work, molecular dynamics simulations based on a\nfirst-principles-derived effective Hamiltonian for\n$Pb_{1-X}(Sc_{1/2}Nb_{1/2})O_{3-X}$~ (PSN), with nearest-neighbor Pb-O\ndivacancy pairs, was used to calculate $X_{\\rm [Pb-O]}$~vs.~T, phase diagrams\nfor PSN with: ideal rock-salt type chemical order; nanoscale chemical\nshort-range order; and random chemical disorder. Here, we show that the phase\ndiagrams should include additional regions in which a glassy relaxor-phase (or\nstate) is predicted. With respect to phase diagram topology, these results\nstrongly support the analogy between relaxors and magnetic spin-glass-systems.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a rigorous derivation of asymptotic formula for the\nlargest eigenvalues using the convergence estimation of the eigenvalues of a\nsequence of self-adjoint compact operators of perturbations resulting from the\npresence of small inhomogeneities.\n", "  A classical field system of two interacting fields -- a real Higgs field and\na complex scalar field -- is considered. It is shown that in such field system\na non-trivial solution exists, which is U(1) charged topological kink. Some\nquestions of stability of the obtained solution are discussed. An improved\nvariational procedure for searching of topological U(1) charged solutions is\ngiven.\n"]}
