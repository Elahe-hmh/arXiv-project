the claim that something seems to travel with a group\nvelocity larger than the speed c of light in vacuum. Various other experimental\nresults seem to point in the same direction: For instance, localized wavelet-\ntype solutions to Maxwell equations have been found, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, that travel with superluminal speed. [Even muonic and\nelectronic neutrinos [it has been proposed] might be \"tachyons\", since their\nsquare mass appears to be negative]. With regard to the first-mentioned\nexperiments, it was recently claimed by Guenter Nimtz that those results with\nevanescent waves (or tunneling photons) imply superluminal signal and impulse\ntransmission, and therefore violate Einstein causality. In this note we want to\nstress that, on the contrary, all such results do not place relativistic\ncausality in jeopardy, even if they referred to actual tachyonic motions: In\nfact, Special Relativity can cope even with superluminal objects and waves. For\ninstance, it is possible (at least in microphysics) to solve also the known\ncausal paradoxes, devised for faster than light motion, although this is not\nwidely recognized yet. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the\noldest causal paradox, originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of\nmany further tachyon paradoxes (like J.Bell's, F.A.E.Pirani's, J.D.Edmonds' and\nothers'). The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon\nmechanics, as it unambiguously follows from special relativity. At Last, in one\nof the two Appendices, we propose how to evaluate the group-velocity in the\ncase of evanescent waves. [PACS nos.: 03.30.+p; 03.50.De; 41.20.Jb; 73.40.Gk;\n84.40.Az; 42.82.Et ]\n", "  The quantum critical fluctuations of the time-reversal breaking order\nparameter which is observed in the pseudogap regime of the Cuprates are shown\nto couple to the lattice equivalent of the local angular momentum of the\nfermions. Such a coupling favors scattering of fermions through angles close to\n$\\pm \\pi/2$ which is unambiguously shown to promote d-wave pairing. The right\norder of magnitude of both $T_c$ and the normalized zero temperature gap\n$\\Delta/T_c$ are calculated using the same fluctuations which give the\ntemperature, frequency and momentum dependence of the the anomalous normal\nstate properties for dopings near the quantum-critical value and with two\nparameters extracted from fit to such experiments.\n", "  Using density functional theory we show that an applied electric field\nsubstantially improves the hydrogen storage properties of a BN sheet by\npolarizing the hydrogen molecules as well as the substrate. The adsorption\nenergy of a single H2 molecule in the presence of an electric field of 0.05\na.u. is 0.48 eV compared to 0.07 eV in its absence. When one layer of H2\nmolecules is adsorbed, the binding energy per H2 molecule increases from 0.03\neV in the field-free case to 0.14 eV/H2 in the presence of an electric field of\n0.045 a.u. The corresponding gravimetric density of 7.5 wt % is consistent with\nthe 6 wt % system target set by DOE for 2010. Once the applied electric field\nis removed, the stored H2 molecules can be easily released, thus making the\nstorage reversible.\n", "  Melt-mixing in twin-screw extruders is a key process in the development of\npolymer composites. Quantifying the mixing performance of kneading elements\nbased on their internal physical processes is a challenging problem. We discuss\nmelt-mixing by novel kneading elements called \"pitched-tip kneading disk\n(ptKD)\". The disk-stagger angle and tip angle are the main geometric parameters\nof the ptKDs. We investigated four typical arrangements of the ptKDs, which are\nforward and backward disk-staggers combined with forward and backward tips.\nNumerical simulations under a certain feed rate and screw revolution speed were\nperformed, and the mixing process was investigated using Lagrangian statistics.\nIt was found that the four types had different mixing characteristics, and\ntheir mixing processes were explained by the coupling effect of drag flow with\nthe disk staggering and pitched-tip and pressure flows, which are controlled by\noperational conditions. The use of a pitched-tip effectively to controls the\nbalance of the pressurization and mixing ability.\n", "  Magnetic and electronic structures in LaFeAsO in the single-stripe-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase are studied using first-principles\ndensity-functional calculations including the spin-orbit interaction. We show\nthat the longitudinal ordering (LO) where Fe magnetic moments are parallel or\nanti-parallel with the in-plane AFM ordering vector is lower in energy than\ntransverse orderings (TOs), in good agreement with neutron diffraction\nexperiments. Calculated energy difference between LO and TOs is about 0.1 meV\nper Fe atom, indicating that LO will prevail at temperature below about 1 K. We\nalso show that the spin-orbit interaction splits degenerate bands at some\nhigh-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone by about 60 meV, depending on\nspatial directions of the Fe magnetic moments.\n", "  We consider a class of nonlinear Boltzmann equations describing return to\nthermal equilibrium in a gas of colliding particles suspended in a thermal\nmedium. We study solutions in the space $L^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\times\n\\mathbb{T}^3).$ Special solutions of these equations, called \"Maxwellians,\" are\nspatially homogenous static Maxwell velocity distributions at the temperature\nof the medium. We prove that, for dilute gases, the solutions corresponding to\nsmooth initial conditions in a weighted $L^{1}$-space converge to a Maxwellian\nin $L^{1},$ exponentially fast in time.\n", "  The formulation of a dynamical theory of General Relativity, including\nmatter, is viewed as a problem of coupling Einstein's theory of pure gravity,\nformulated as an action principle, to an independently chosen and well defined\nfield theory of matter. It is well known that this is accomplished in a most\nnatural way when the matter theory is formulated as a relativistic, Lagrangian\nfield theory. Special matter models of this type have been available; here a\nthermodynamical model that allows for general flows is used. A problem that is\nof even older date, one that was pursued vigorously by leading scientists of\nthe 19'th century, is that of subjecting hydrodynamics and thermodynamics to an\nAction Principle. A solution to this problem has been known for some time, but\nonly under the strong restriction to potential flows.\n  A variational principle for general flows has now become available.\n  The present paper lifts this theory to the relativistic context, Special\nRelativity and General Relativity. The energy momentum tensor has a structure\nthat is more general than that postulated by Tolman, and different from\nproposed generalizations; it appears to be well suited to represent rotational\nflows in General Relativity. It incorporates a conserved mass current, the\nrelativistic analogue of the hydrodynamical equation of continuity.\n", "  We develop a quantum scattering model to describe the exciton transport\nthrough the Fenna-Matthews-Olson(FMO) complex. It is found that the exciton\ntransport involved the optimal quantum coherence is more efficient than that\ninvolved classical behavior alone. Furthermore, we also find that the quantum\nresonance condition is easier to be fulfilled in multiple pathways than that in\none pathway. We then definitely demonstrate that the optimal distribution of\nthe pigments, the multitude of energy delivery pathways and the quantum\neffects, are combined together to contribute to the perfect energy transport in\nthe FMO complex.\n", "  We study a car-following model of traffic flow which assumes only that a\ncar's acceleration depends on its own speed, the headway ahead of it, and the\nrate of change of headway, with only minimal assumptions about the functional\nform of that dependence. The velocity of uniform steady flow is found\nimplicitly from the acceleration function, and its linear stability criterion\ncan be expressed simply in terms of it. Crucially, unlike in previously\nanalyzed car-following models, the threshold of absolute stability does not\ngenerally coincide with an inflection point in the steady velocity function.\nThe Burgers and KdV equations can be derived under the usual assumptions, but\nthe mKdV equation arises only when absolute stability does coincide with an\ninflection point. Otherwise, the KdV equation applies near absolute stability,\nwhile near the inflection point one obtains the mKdV equation plus an extra,\nquadratic term. Corrections to the KdV equation \"select\" a single member of the\none-parameter set of soliton solutions. In previous models this has always\nmarked the threshold of a finite- amplitude instability of steady flow, but\nhere it can alternatively be a stable, small-amplitude jam. That is, there can\nbe a forward bifurcation from steady flow. The new, augmented mKdV equation\nwhich holds near an inflection point admits a continuous family of kink\nsolutions, like the mKdV equation, and we derive the selection criterion\narising from the corrections to this equation.\n", "  In multi-component soft matter, interface properties often play a key role in\ndetermining the properties of the overall system. The identification of the\ninternal dynamic structures in non-equilibrium situations requires the\ninterface rheology to be characterized. We have developed a method to quantify\nthe rheological contribution of soft interfaces and evaluate the dynamic\nmodulus of the interface. This method reveals that the dynamic shear responses\nof interfaces in bilayer systems comprising polypropylene and three different\npolyethylenes can be classified as having hardening and softening effects on\nthe overall system: a interface between linear long polymers becomes more\nelastic than the component polymers, while large polydispersity or\nlong-chain-branching of one component make the interface more viscous. We find\nthat the chain lengths and architectures of the component polymers, rather than\nequilibrium immiscibility, play an essential role in determining the interface\nrheological properties.\n", "  In this paper, we are exploring strategies for the reduction of the\ncongestion in the complex networks. The nodes without buffers are considered,\nso, if the congestion occurs, the information packets will be dropped. The\nfocus is on the efficient routing. The routing strategies are compared using\ntwo generic models, i.e., Barab\\`asi-Albert scale-free network and scale-free\nnetwork on lattice, and the academic router networks of the Netherlands and\nFrance. We propose a dynamic deflection routing algorithm which automatically\nextends path of the packet before it arrives at congested node. The simulation\nresults indicate that the dynamic routing strategy can further reduce number of\ndropped packets in a combination with the efficient path routing proposed by\nYan et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)].\n", "  These are notes on the theory of supermanifolds and integration on them,\naiming to collect results that are useful for a better understanding of\nsuperstring perturbation theory in the RNS formalism.\n", "  New tests are proposed to constrain possible deviations from local Lorentz\ninvariance and local position invariance in the gravity sector. By using\nprecise timing results of two binary pulsars, i.e., PSRs J1012+5307 and\nJ1738+0333, we are able to constrain (strong-field) parametrized post-Newtonian\nparameters $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$, $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$, $\\hat{\\xi}$ to high precision,\namong which, $|\\hat{\\xi}| < 3.1\\times10^{-4}$ (95% C.L.) is reported here for\nthe first time.\n", "  Mixture quality plays a crucial role in the physical properties of\nmulti-component immiscible polymer mixtures including nanocomposites and\npolymer blends. Such complex mixtures are often characterized by hierarchical\ninternal structures, which have not been accounted for by conventional mixture\nquantifications. We propose a way to characterize the mixture quality of\ncomplex mixtures with hierarchical structures. Starting from a concentration\nfield, which can be typically obtained from TEM/SEM images, the distribution of\nthe coarsegrained concentration is analyzed to obtain the scale-dependent\ninhomogeneity of a mixture. The hierarchical nature of a mixture is\ncharacterized by multiple characteristic scales of the scale-dependent\ninhomogeneity. We demonstrate how the proposed method works to characterize\nsizes and distributions in different dispersions. This method is generally\napplicable to various complex mixtures.\n", "  We discuss the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) in lambda,\ncascade and vee type three-level systems where the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad\nterm of each configuration are expressed in the $SU(3)$ representation. At\nsteady state, the Optical Bloch Equations of each configuration are solved to\nobtain the dispersion and absorption profiles of the probe field along with\ntheir group velocities. When the EIT condition is achieved at resonance, the\npopulation oscillation shows which of the bare states are contributing to form\nthe dark state. Our study reveals that the dark state for the lambda and\ncascade system effectively coincides with the lowest bare state of that system,\nwhile for the vee system, it is a maximally superposed state of the middle and\nupper bare states.\n", "  The notion of the center of an algebra over a field k has a far reaching\ngeneralization to algebras in monoidal categories. The center then lives in the\nmonoidal center of the original category. This generalization plays an\nimportant role in the study of bulk-boundary duality of rational conformal\nfield theories. In this paper, we study functorial properties of the center. We\nshow that it gives rise to a 2-functor from the bicategory of semisimple\nindecomposable module categories over a fusion category to the bicategory of\ncommutative algebras in the monoidal center of this fusion category. Morphism\nspaces of the latter bicategory are extended from algebra homomorphisms to\ncertain categories of cospans. We conjecture that the above 2-functor arises\nfrom a lax 3-functor between tricategories, and that in this setting one can\nrelax the conditions from fusion categories to finite tensor categories. We\nbriefly outline how one is naturally lead to the above 2-functor when studying\nrational conformal field theory with defects of all codimensions. For example,\nthe cospans of the target bicategory correspond to spaces of defect fields and\nto the bulk-defect operator product expansions.\n", "  This paper derives a kinetic equation for a two-dimensional single species\npoint vortex system. We consider a situation (different from the ones\nconsidered previously) of weak mean flow where the time scale of the\nmacroscopic motion is longer than the decorrelation time so that the trajectory\nof the point vortices can be approximated by a straight line on the\ndecorrelation time scale. This may be the case when the number $N$ of point\nvortices is not too large. Using a kinetic theory based on the Klimontovich\nformalism, we derive a collision term consisting of a diffusion term and a\ndrift term, whose structure is similar to the Fokker-Planck equation. The\ncollision term exhibits several important properties: (a) it includes a\nnonlocal effect; (b) it conserves the mean field energy; (c) it satisfies the H\ntheorem; (d) its effect vanishes in each local equilibrium region with the same\ntemperature. When the system reaches a global equilibrium state, the collision\nterm completely converges to zero all over the system.\n", "  We investigate of the properties of $\\sim$2000 Herschel/SPIRE-selected\ngalaxies from $0<z<4$ using a combination of extensive spectroscopy, deep\nimaging from CFHT, VLA, Spitzer, XMM-Newton, and Herschel, and well-calibrated\nSED fitting. Herschel galaxies are observed to span a range of stellar masses,\ncolors, and absolute magnitudes equivalent to galaxies undetected in SPIRE.\nThough many Herschel galaxies appear to be in transition, such galaxies are\nlargely consistent with normal star-forming galaxies when rest-frame colors are\nutilized. The nature of the star-forming \"main sequence\" is studied and we warn\nagainst adopting this framework unless the main sequence is determined\nprecisely. Herschel galaxies at different total infrared luminosities\n($L_{TIR}$) are compared. Bluer colors, larger nebular extinctions, and larger\ncontributions from younger stellar populations are observed for galaxies with\nlarger $L_{TIR}$, suggesting that low-$L_{TIR}$ galaxies are undergoing\nrejuvenated starbursts while galaxies with higher $L_{TIR}$ are forming a\nlarger percentage of their stellar mass. A variety of methods are used to\nselect powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN). Galaxies hosting AGN are observed\nto be undergoing starbursts more commonly and vigorously than a matched sample\nof galaxies without powerful AGN and, additionally, the fraction of galaxies\nwith an AGN increases with increasing star formation rate at all redshifts. At\nall redshifts ($0<z<4$) the most prodigious star-forming galaxies are found to\ncontain the highest fraction of powerful AGN. For redshift bins that allow a\ncomparison ($z>0.5$), the highest $L_{TIR}$ galaxies in a given redshift bin\nare unobserved by SPIRE at subsequently lower redshifts, a trend linked to\ndownsizing. In conjunction with other results, this evidence is used to argue\nfor prevalent AGN-driven quenching in starburst galaxies across cosmic time.\n", "  Close to half filling and in the limit of strong interactions the Hubbard\nmodel leads a spin Hamiltonian. In its original isotropic form this is the\nHeisenberg model with antiferromagnetic coupling $J$. On a square lattice there\nis no frustration and the ground state is a classical antiferromagnet denoted\nby the commensurate order vector ${\\bf Q}=(\\pi,\\pi)$. In this work we show that\nthe inclusion of spin orbit coupling (SOC) in the fermionic Hubbard model on a\nsquare lattice leads to an incommensurate spin density wave (ISDW) in the\nstrong interactions limit at half filling. In this limit the Hubbard model\nleads to a non-diagonal and anisotropic spin Hamiltonian which exhibits the\nincommensurate spin order as its classical ground state. We note that an ISDW\ncan be found in systems regardless of spin orbit-coupling due to nesting and\nlattice distortion. These effects, however, can usually be recognized by\nexperimental probes.\n", "  We present a systematic method to classify the four-level system using\n$SU(4)$ symmetry as the basis group. It is shown that this symmetry allows\nthree dipole transitions which eventually leads to six possible configurations\nof the four-level system. Using a dressed atom approach, the semi-classical\nversion of each configuration is exactly solved under rotating wave\napproximation and the symmetry of the Rabi oscillation among various models is\nstudied and its implication is discussed.\n", "  We describe the definition of Jacobi (generalized)-Lie bialgebras\n$(({\\bf{g}},\\phi_{0}),({\\bf{g}}^{*},X_{0}))$ in terms of structure constants of\nthe Lie algebras ${\\bf{g}}$ and ${\\bf{g}}^{*}$ and components of their\n1-cocycles $X_{0}\\in {\\bf{g}}$ and $\\phi_{0}\\in {\\bf{g}}^{*}$ in the basis of\nthe Lie algebras. Then, using adjoint representations and automorphism Lie\ngroups of Lie algebras, we give a method for classification of real low\ndimensional Jacobi-Lie bialgebras. In this way, we obtain and classify real two\nand three dimensional Jacobi-Lie bialgebras.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the problem of existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to the Einstein field equations for a spatially flat FLRW universe in\nthe context of stochastic eternal inflation where the stochastic mechanism is\nmodelled by adding a stochastic forcing term representing Gaussian white noise\nto the Klein-Gordon equation. We show that under these considerations, the\nKlein-Gordon equation actually becomes a stochastic differential equation.\nTherefore, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Einstein's equations\ndepend on whether the coefficients of this stochastic differential equation\nobey Lipschitz continuity conditions. We show that for any choice of $V(\\phi)$,\nthe Einstein field equations are not globally well-posed, hence, any solution\nfound to these equations is not guaranteed to be unique. Instead, the\ncoefficients are at best locally Lipschitz continuous in the physical state\nspace of the dynamical variables, which only exist up to a finite explosion\ntime. We further perform Feller's explosion test for an arbitrary power-law\ninflaton potential and prove that all solutions to the EFE explode in a finite\ntime with probability one. This implies that the mechanism of stochastic\ninflation thus considered cannot be described to be eternal, since the very\nconcept of eternal inflation implies that the process continues indefinitely.\nWe therefore argue that stochastic inflation based on a stochastic forcing term\nwould not produce an infinite number of universes in some multiverse ensemble.\nIn general, since the Einstein field equations in both situations are not\nwell-posed, we further conclude that the existence of a multiverse via the\nstochastic eternal inflation mechanism considered in this paper is still very\nmuch an open question that will require much deeper investigation.\n", "  This paper provides an alternative approach to the problem of preparing pure\nGaussian states in a linear quantum system. It is shown that any pure Gaussian\nstate can be generated by a cascade of one-dimensional open quantum harmonic\noscillators, without any direct interaction Hamiltonians between these\noscillators. This is physically advantageous from an experimental point of\nview. An example on the preparation of two-mode squeezed states is given to\nillustrate the theory.\n", "  Within the framework of higher-twist collinear factorization, transverse\nmomentum broadening for the final hadrons in semi-inclusive deeply inelastic\n$e+A$ collisions is studied at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative\nQCD. Through explicit calculations of real and virtual corrections at twist-4,\nthe transverse-momentum-weighted differential cross section due to double\nscattering is shown to factorize at NLO and can be expressed as a convolution\nof twist-4 nuclear parton correlation functions, the usual twist-2\nfragmentation functions and hard parts which are finite and free of any\ndivergences. A QCD evolution equation is also derived for the renormalized\ntwist-4 quark-gluon correlation function which can be applied to future\nphenomenological studies of transverse momentum broadening and jet quenching at\nNLO.\n", "  Experiments show that macromolecular crowding modestly reduces the size of\nintrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) even at volume fraction ($\\phi$)\nsimilar to that in the cytosol whereas DNA undergoes a coil-to-globule\ntransition at very small $\\phi$. We show using a combination of scaling\narguments and simulations that the polymer size $\\overline{R}_g(\\phi)$ depends\non $x = \\overline{R}_g(0)/D$ where $D$ is the $\\phi$-dependent distance between\nthe crowders. If $x\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, there is only a small decrease in\n$\\overline{R}_g(\\phi)$ as $\\phi$ increases. When $x\\gg \\mathcal{O}(1)$, a\ncooperative coil-to-globule transition is induced. Our theory quantitatively\nexplains a number of experiments.\n", "  The Purcell factor quantifies the change of the radiative decay of a dipole\nin an electromagnetic environment relative to free space. Designing this factor\nis at the heart of photonics technology, striving to develop ever smaller or\nless lossy optical resonators. The Purcell factor can be expressed using the\nelectromagnetic eigenmodes of the resonators, introducing the notion of a mode\nvolume for each mode. This approach allows to use an analytic treatment,\nconsisting only of sums over eigenmode resonances, a so-called spectral\nrepresentation. We show in the present work that the expressions for the mode\nvolumes known and used in literature are only approximately valid for modes of\nhigh quality factor, while in general they are incorrect. We rectify this\nissue, introducing the exact normalization of modes. We present an analytic\ntheory of the Purcell effect based on the exact mode normalization and\nresulting effective mode volume. We use a homogeneous dielectric sphere in\nvacuum, which is analytically solvable, to exemplify these findings.\n", "  We explore non-analytic quantum phase dynamics of dipolar exciton condensates\nformed in a system of 1D quantum layers subjected to voltage quenches. We map\nthe exciton condensate physics on to the pseudospin ferromagnet model showing\nan additional oscillatory metastable and paramagnetic phase beyond the\nwell-known ferromagnetic phase by utilizing a time-dependent, non-perturbative\ntheoretical model. We explain the coherent phase of the exciton condensate in\nquantum Hall bilayers, observed for currents equal to and slightly larger than\nthe critical current, as a stable time-dependent phase characterized by\npersistent charged meron flow in each of the individual layers with a\ncharacteristic AC Josephson frequency. As the magnitude of the voltage quench\nis further increased, we find that the time-dependent current oscillations\nassociated with the charged meron flow decay, resulting in a transient\npseudospin paramagnet phase characterized by partially coherent charge transfer\nbetween layers, before the state relaxes to incoherent charge transfer between\nthe layers.\n", "  Instead of formulating the state space of a quantum field theory over one big\nHilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski to describe quantum states as\nprojective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler\nHilbert spaces. Beside the physical motivations for this approach, it could\nhelp designing a quantum state space holding the states we need. In\n[Oko{\\l}\\'ow 2013, arXiv:1304.6330] the description of a theory of Abelian\nconnections within this framework was developed, an important insight being to\nuse building blocks labeled by combinations of edges and surfaces. The present\nwork generalizes this construction to an arbitrary gauge group G (in\nparticular, G is neither assumed to be Abelian nor compact). This involves\nrefining the definition of the label set, as well as deriving explicit formulas\nto relate the Hilbert spaces attached to different labels.\n  If the gauge group happens to be compact, we also have at our disposal the\nwell-established Ashtekar-Lewandowski Hilbert space, which is defined as an\ninductive limit using building blocks labeled by edges only. We then show that\nthe quantum state space presented here can be thought as a natural extension of\nthe space of density matrices over this Hilbert space. In addition, it is\nmanifest from the classical counterparts of both formalisms that the projective\napproach allows for a more balanced treatment of the holonomy and flux\nvariables, so it might pave the way for the development of more satisfactory\ncoherent states.\n", "  We show that self-organization occurs in the phase dynamics of soliton\nmodelocking in paramet- ric frequency combs. Reduction of the Lugiato-Lefever\nequation (LLE) to a simpler set of phase equations reveals that this\nself-organization arises via mechanisms akin to those in the Kuramoto model for\nsynchronization of coupled oscillators. In addition, our simulations show that\nthe phase equations evolve to a broadband phase-locked state, analogous to the\nsoliton formation process in the LLE. Our simplified equations intuitively\nexplain the origin of the pump phase offset in soliton- modelocked parametric\nfrequency combs. They also predict that the phase of the intracavity field\nundergoes an anti-symmetrization that precedes phase synchronization, and they\nclarify the role of chaotic states in soliton formation in parametric combs.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional chain of harmonically coupled units in an\nasymmetric anharmonic soft potential. Due to nonlinear localisation of energy,\nthis system exhibits extreme events in the sense that individual elements of\nthe chain show very large excitations. A detailed statistical analysis of\nextremes in this system reveals some unexpected properties, e.g., a pronounced\npattern in the inter event interval statistics. We relate these statistical\nproperties to underlying system dynamics, and notice that often when extreme\nevents occur the system dynamics adopts (at least locally) an oscillatory\nbehaviour, resulting in, for example, a quick succession of such events. The\nmodel therefore might serve as a paradigmatic model for the study of the\ninterplay of nonlinearity, energy transport, and extreme events.\n", "  This paper is a survey of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariant of topological\ninsulators used in condensed matter physics. The $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued\ntopological invariant, which was originally called the TKNN invariant in\nphysics, has now been fully understood as the first Chern number. The\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant is more mysterious, we will explain its equivalent\ndescriptions from different points of view and provide the relations between\nthem. These invariants provide the classification of topological insulators\nwith different symmetries in which K-theory plays an important role. Moreover,\nwe establish that both invariants are realizations of index theorems which can\nalso be understood in terms of condensed matter physics.\n", "  The Bredig transition to the superionic phase indicated with the lambda-peak\nin Cp was highly expected for PuO2 as other actinide dioxides. However,\nleast-square fit and local smoothing techniques applied to the experimental\nenthalpy data of plutonium dioxide in 80's could not detect a lambda-peak in\nspecific heat that might be due to too scattered and insufficient experimental\ndata. Therefore, this issue has not been yet put beyond the doubts. In the\ncurrent article, a superionic model of PuO2 is developed with partially ionic\nmodel of a rigid ion potential. Thermophysical properties were calculated in\nconstant pressure-temperature ensemble using molecular dynamics simulation. The\nBredig transition with vicinity of a lambda-peak in specific heat was a\nsuccessfully observed for the model system at about 2100K. Moreover, the\nexperimental enthalpy change was well reproduced before and after the estimated\ntransition temperature.\n", "  A complete classification of exact solutions of ghost-free, massive bigravity\nis derived which enables the dynamical decoupling of the background, and the\nforeground metrics. The general decoupling solution space of the two metrics is\nconstructed. Within this branch of the solution space the foreground metric\ntheory becomes general relativity (GR) with an additional effective\ncosmological constant, and the background metric dynamics is governed by plain\nGR.\n", "  Quantum entanglement under an extensive bipartition can reveal the critical\nboundary theory of a topological phase in the parameter space. In this study we\ndemonstrate that the infinite-randomness fixed point for spin-1/2 degrees of\nfreedom can emerge from an extensive random bipartition of the spin-1\nAffleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki chain. The nested entanglement entropy of the\nground state of the reduced density matrix exhibits a logarithmic scaling with\nan effective central charge $\\tilde{c} = 0.72 \\pm 0.02 \\approx \\ln 2$. We\nfurther discuss, in the language of bulk quantum entanglement, how to\nunderstand all phase boundaries and the surrounding Griffiths phases for the\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1 chain with quenched disorder and\ndimerization.\n", "  Gravitational collapse of a shell of charged dust surrounded by the phantom\ndark energy is probed by the minimal area surface, which is dual to probe the\nthermalization in the boundary quantum field by expectation values of Wilson\nloop in the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We investigated mainly the\neffect of the phantom dark energy parameter and chemical potential on the\nthermalization. The result shows that the smaller the phantom dark energy\nparameter is, the easier the plasma thermalizes as the chemical potential is\nfixed, and the larger the chemical potential is, the harder the plasma\nthermalizes as the dark energy parameter is fixed. We get the fitting function\nof the thermalization curve and with it, the thermalization velocity and\nthermalization acceleration are discussed.\n", "  Iron-based superconductivity develops near an antiferromagnetic order and out\nof a bad metal normal state, which has been interpreted as originating from a\nproximate Mott transition. Whether an actual Mott insulator can be realized in\nthe phase diagram of the iron pnictides remains an open question. Here we use\ntransport, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and\nneutron scattering to demonstrate that NaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As near $x\\approx 0.5$\nexhibits real space Fe and Cu ordering, and are antiferromagnetic insulators\nwith the insulating behavior persisting above the N\\'eel temperature,\nindicative of a Mott insulator. Upon decreasing $x$ from $0.5$, the\nantiferromagnetic ordered moment continuously decreases, yielding to\nsuperconductivity around $x=0.05$. Our discovery of a Mott insulating state in\nNaFe$_{1-x}$Cu$_x$As thus makes it the only known Fe-based material in which\nsuperconductivity can be smoothly connected to the Mott insulating state,\nhighlighting the important role of electron correlations in the high-$T_{\\rm\nc}$ superconductivity.\n", "  We study the dynamical evolution of a stellar disk orbiting a massive black\nhole. We explore the role of two-body relaxation, mass segregation, stellar\nevolution and binary heating in affecting the disk evolution, and consider the\nimpact of the nuclear cluster structure and the stellar-disk mass-function. We\nuse analytic arguments and numerical calculations, and apply them to study the\nevolution of a stellar disk (similar to that observed in the Galactic center;\nGC), both on the short (few Myr) and longer (100 Myr) evolutionary timescales.\nWe find the dominant processes affecting the disk evolution are two-body\nrelaxation and mass segregation where as binary heating have only a little\ncontribution. Massive stars play a dominant role in kinematically heating low\nmass stars, and driving them to high eccentricities/inclinations. Multi-mass\nmodels with realistic mass-functions for the disk stars show the disk structure\nto be mass stratified, with the most massive stars residing in thinner\nstructures. Stellar evolution plays an important role in decreasing the number\nof massive stars with time, thereby leading to slower relaxation, where the\nremnant compact objects of these stars are excited to higher\neccentricities/inclinations. At these later evolutionary stages dynamical\nheating by the nuclear cluster plays a progressively more important role. We\nconclude that the high eccentricities of the disk-stars in the Galactic Center\nsuggest that the disk formed with initially high eccentricities, or that\ncollective or secular processes dominate the disk evolution. Finally, we find\nthat the disk structure is expected to keep a thin structure even after 100\nMyrs. It therefore suggests earlier disks now containing only older, lower mass\nstars might still be observed in the Galactic center, unless destroyed/smeared\nby other non-two-body relaxation processes.\n", "  We study exponential decay rates of eigenfunctions of self-adjoint higher\norder elliptic operators on R^n. We are interested in decay rates as a function\nof direction. We show that the possible decay rates are to a large extent\ndetermined algebraically.\n", "  We investigate the conformations of DNA-like stiff chains, characterized by\ncontour length ($L$) and persistence length ($l_p$), in a variety of crowded\nenvironments containing mono disperse soft spherical (SS) and spherocylindrical\n(SC) particles, mixture of SS and SC, and a milieu mimicking the composition of\nproteins in $E. coli.$ cytoplasm. The stiff chain, whose size modestly\nincreases in SS crowders up to $\\phi\\approx 0.1$, is considerably more compact\nat low volume fractions ($\\phi \\leq 0.2$) in monodisperse SC particles than in\na medium containing SS particles. A 1:1 mixture of SS and SC crowders induces\ngreater chain compaction than the pure SS or SC crowders at the same $\\phi$\nwith the effect being highly non-additive. We also discover a counter-intuitive\nresult that polydisperse crowding environment, mimicking the composition of a\ncell lysate, swells the DNA-like polymer, which is in stark contrast to the\nsize reduction of flexible polymer in the same milieu. Trapping of the stiff\nchain in a fluctuating tube-like environment created by large-sized crowders\nexplains the dramatic increase in size and persistence length of the stiff\nchain. In the polydisperse medium, mimicking the cellular environment, the size\nof the DNA (or related RNA) is determined by $L/l_p$. At low $L/l_p$ the size\nof the polymer is unaffected whereas there is a dramatic swelling at\nintermediate value of $L/l_p$. We use these results to provide insights into\nrecent experiments on crowding effects on RNA, and also make testable\npredictions.\n", "  Recent experiments showing scaling of the intrachromosomal contact\nprobability, $P(s)\\sim s^{-1}$ with the genomic distance $s$, are interpreted\nto mean a self-similar fractal-like chromosome organization. However, scaling\nof $P(s)$ varies across organisms, requiring an explanation. We illustrate\ndynamical arrest in a highly confined space as a discriminating marker for\ngenome organization, by modeling chromosome inside a nucleus as a homopolymer\nconfined to a sphere of varying sizes. Brownian dynamics simulations show that\nthe chain dynamics slows down as the polymer volume fraction ($\\phi$) inside\nthe confinement approaches a critical value $\\phi_c$. The universal value of\n$\\phi_c^{\\infty}\\approx 0.44$ for a sufficiently long polymer ($N\\gg 1$) allows\nus to discuss genome dynamics using $\\phi$ as a single parameter. Our study\nshows that the onset of glassy dynamics is the reason for the segregated\nchromosome organization in human ($N\\approx 3\\times 10^9$,\n$\\phi\\gtrsim\\phi_c^{\\infty}$), whereas chromosomes of budding yeast ($N\\approx\n10^8$, $\\phi<\\phi_c^{\\infty}$) are equilibrated with no clear signature of such\norganization.\n", "  The observed value of the Higgs mass indicates an instability of the Higgs\nscalar at large energy scales, and hence also at large field values. In the\ncontext of early universe cosmology, this is often considered to lead to\nproblems. Here we point out that we can use the instability of the Higgs field\nto generate an Ekpyrotic phase of contraction. In the context of string theory\nit is possible that at very high energy densities extra states become massless,\nleading to an S-brane which leads to the transition between a contracting phase\nin the past and the current expanding phase. Thus, the Higgs field can be used\nto generate a non-singular bouncing cosmology in which the anisotropy problem\nof usual bouncing scenarios is mitigated.\n", "  Chemically synthesized single-crystalline gold microplates have been\nattracting increasing interests because of their potential as high-quality gold\nfilms for nanotechnology. We present the growth of tens of nanometer thick and\ntens of micrometer large single-crystalline gold plates directly on solid\nsubstrates by solution-phase synthesis. Compared to microplates deposited on\nsubstrates from dispersion phase, substrate-grown plates exhibit significantly\nhigher quality by avoiding severe small-particle contamination and aggregation.\nSubstrate-grown gold plates also open new perspec-tives to study the growth\nmechanism via intermittent growth and observation cycles of a large number of\nindividual plates. Growth models are proposed to interpret the evolution of\nthickness, area and shape of plates. It is found that the plate surface remains\nsmooth after regrowth, implying the application of regrowth for producing giant\nplates as well as unique single-crystalline nano-structures.\n", "  Defining the entropy of classical particles raises a number of paradoxes and\nambiguities, some of which have been known for over a century. Several, such as\nGibbs' paradox, involve the fact that classical particles are distinguishable,\nand in textbooks these are often `resolved' by appeal to the quantum-mechanical\nindistinguishability of atoms or molecules of the same type. However, questions\nthen remain of how to correctly define the entropy of large poly-atomic\nparticles such as colloids in suspension, of which no two are exactly alike. By\nperforming experiments on such colloids, one can establish that certain\ndefinitions of the classical entropy fit the data, while others in the\nliterature do not. Specifically, the experimental facts point firmly to an\n`informatic' interpretation that dates back to Gibbs: entropy is determined by\nthe number of microstates that we as observers choose to treat as equivalent\nwhen we identify a macrostate. This approach, unlike some others, can account\nfor the existence of colloidal crystals, and for the observed abundances of\ncolloidal clusters of different shapes. We also address some lesser-known\nparadoxes whereby the physics of colloidal assemblies, which ought to be purely\nclassical, seems to involve quantum mechanics directly. The experimental\nsymptoms of such involvement are predicted to be `isotope effects' in which\ncolloids with different inertial masses, but otherwise identical sizes and\nproperties, show different aggregation statistics. These paradoxes are caused\nby focussing one's attention on some classical degrees while neglecting others;\nwhen all are treated equally, all isotope effects are found to vanish.\n", "  We propose a theoretical model to describe the strain-induced linear\nelectro-optic (Pockels) effect in centro-symmetric crystals. The general\nformulation is presented and the specific case of the strained silicon is\ninvestigated in detail because of its attractive properties for integrated\noptics. The outcome of this analysis is a linear relation between the second\norder susceptibility tensor and the strain gradient tensor, depending\ngenerically on fifteen coefficients. The proposed model greatly simplifies the\ndescription of the electro-optic effect in strained silicon waveguides,\nproviding a powerful and effective tool for design and optimization of optical\ndevices.\n", "  We present a determination of nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts for l\n>= 0. The S, P, D and F phase shifts for both the spin-triplet and spin-singlet\nchannels are computed with lattice Quantum ChromoDynamics. For l > 0, this is\nthe first lattice QCD calculation using the Luscher finite-volume formalism.\nThis required the design and implementation of novel lattice methods involving\ndisplaced sources and momentum-space cubic sinks. To demonstrate the utility of\nour approach, the calculations were performed in the SU(3)-flavor limit where\nthe light quark masses have been tuned to the physical strange quark mass,\ncorresponding to m_pi = m_K ~ 800 MeV. In this work, we have assumed that only\nthe lowest partial waves contribute to each channel, ignoring the unphysical\npartial wave mixing that arises within the finite-volume formalism. This\nassumption is only valid for sufficiently low energies; we present evidence\nthat it holds for our study using two different channels. Two spatial volumes\nof V ~ (3.5 fm)^3 and V ~ (4.6 fm)^3 were used. The finite-volume spectrum is\nextracted from the exponential falloff of the correlation functions. Said\nspectrum is mapped onto the infinite volume phase shifts using the\ngeneralization of the Luscher formalism for two-nucleon systems.\n", "  Inducing topological transitions by a time-periodic perturbation offers a\nroute to controlling the properties of materials. Here we show that the\nadiabatic preparation of a non-trivial state involves a selective population of\nedge-states, due to exponentially-small gaps preventing adiabaticity. We\nillustrate this by studying graphene-like ribbons with hopping's phases of\nslowly increasing amplitude, as for, e.g., a circularly polarized laser slowly\nturned-on. The induced currents have large periodic oscillations, but flow\nsolely at the edges upon time-averaging, and can be controlled by focusing the\nlaser on either edge. The bulk undergoes a non-equilibrium topological\ntransition, as signaled by the local Chern marker introduced by Bianco & Resta\nin equilibrium. The failure of the adiabatic picture in presence of intraband\nresonances is discussed.\n", "  We present a proof of concept design for a structured square cloak enclosing\na void in an elastic lattice, subjected to flexural vibrations. In addition to\nthe theoretical design, we fabricate and experimentally test an elastic\ninvisibility cloak for flexural waves in a mechanical lattice. Further\nverification and modelling is performed numerically through finite element\nsimulations. The primary advantage of our square lattice cloak, over other\ndesigns, is the straightforward implementation and the ease of construction.\nThe elastic lattice cloak shows an impressive efficiency within the predicted\nfrequency range of 100-250Hz.\n", "  The pivotal quality of proximity graphs is connectivity, i.e. all nodes in\nthe graph are connected to one another either directly or via intermediate\nnodes. These types of graphs are robust, i.e., they are able to function well\neven if they are subject to limited removal of elementary building blocks, as\nit may occur for random failures or targeted attacks. Here, we study how the\nstructure of these graphs is affected when nodes get removed successively until\nan extensive fraction is removed such that the graphs fragment. We study\ndifferent types of proximity graphs for various node removal strategies. We use\ndifferent types of observables to monitor the fragmentation process, simple\nones like number and sizes of connected components, and more complex ones like\nthe hop diameter and the backup capacity, which is needed to make a network N-1\nresilient. The actual fragmentation turns out to be described by a second order\nphase transition. Using finite-size scaling analyses we numerically assess the\nthreshold fraction of removed nodes, which is characteristic for the particular\ngraph type and node deletion scheme, that suffices to decompose the underlying\ngraphs.\n", "  We demonstrate that ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic excitations can be\ntriggered by the dynamical spin accumulations induced by the bulk and surface\ncontributions of the spin Hall effect. Due to the spin-orbit interaction, a\ntime-dependent spin density is generated by an oscillatory electric field\napplied parallel to the atomic planes of Fe/W(110) multilayers. For symmetric\ntrilayers of Fe/W/Fe in which the Fe layers are ferromagnetically coupled, we\ndemonstrate that only the collective out-of-phase precession mode is excited,\nwhile the uniform (in-phase) mode remains silent. When they are\nantiferromagnetically coupled, the oscillatory electric field sets the Fe\nmagnetizations into elliptical precession motions with opposite angular\nvelocities. The manipulation of different collective spin-wave dynamical modes\nthrough the engineering of the multilayers and their thicknesses may be used to\ndevelop ultrafast spintronics devices. Our work provides a general framework\nthat probes the realistic responses of materials in the time or frequency\ndomain.\n", "  The WASA-at-COSY experiment has collected $3\\times10^{7}$ events with\n$\\eta$-mesons produced via the reaction $pd\\rightarrow{^{3}\\textrm{He}}\\eta$ at\n$\\textrm{T} = 1.0 \\textrm{GeV}$. Using this data set, we evaluate the branching\nratios of the decays $\\eta\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\gamma$, $\\eta\\to e^{+}e^{-}\\gamma$,\n$\\eta\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\\eta\\to e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$. The\nbranching ratios are normalized to the $\\eta\\rightarrow\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}$\ndecay. In addition an upper limit on a $CP$-violating asymmetry in\n$\\eta\\rightarrow \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}e^{+}e^{-}$ is extracted.\n", "  Understanding the behavior of quantum systems subject to magnetic fields is\nof fundamental importance and underpins quantum technologies. However, modeling\nthese systems is a complex task, because of many-body interactions and because\nmany-body approaches such as density functional theory get complicated by the\npresence of a vector potential into the system Hamiltonian. We use the metric\nspace approach to quantum mechanics to study the effects of varying the\nmagnetic vector potential on quantum systems. The application of this technique\nto model systems in the ground state provides insight into the fundamental\nmapping at the core of current density functional theory, which relates the\nmany-body wavefunction, particle density and paramagnetic current density. We\nshow that the role of the paramagnetic current density in this relationship\nbecomes crucial when considering states with different magnetic quantum\nnumbers, $m$. Additionally, varying the magnetic field uncovers a richer\ncomplexity for the \"band structure\" present in ground state metric spaces, as\ncompared to previous studies varying scalar potentials. The robust nature of\nthe metric space approach is strengthened by demonstrating the gauge invariance\nof the related metric for the paramagnetic current density. We go beyond ground\nstate properties and apply this approach to excited states. The results suggest\nthat, under specific conditions, a universal behavior may exist for the\nrelationships between the physical quantities defining the system.\n", "  Understanding the dynamics of fluid-driven sediment transport remains\nchallenging, as it is an intermediate region between a granular material and a\nfluid flow. Boyer \\textit{et al.}\\citep{Boyer2011} proposed a local rheology\nunifying dense dry-granular and viscous-suspension flows, but it has been\nvalidated only for neutrally-buoyant particles in a confined system. Here we\ngeneralize the Boyer \\textit{et al.}\\citep{Boyer2011} model to account for the\nweight of a particle by addition of a pressure $P_0$, and test the ability of\nthis model to describe sediment transport in an idealized laboratory river. We\nsubject a bed of settling plastic particles to a laminar-shear flow from above,\nand use Refractive-Index-Matching to track particles' motion and determine\nlocal rheology --- from the fluid-granular interface to deep in the granular\nbed. Data from all experiments collapse onto a single curve of friction $\\mu$\nas a function of the viscous number $I_v$ over the range $10^{-5} \\leq I_v \\leq\n1$, validating the local rheology model. For $I_v < 10^{-5}$, however, data do\nnot collapse. Instead of undergoing a jamming transition with $\\mu \\rightarrow\n\\mu_s$ as expected, particles transition to a creeping regime where we observe\na continuous decay of the friction coefficient $\\mu \\leq \\mu_s$ as $I_v$\ndecreases. The rheology of this creep regime cannot be described by the local\nmodel, and more work is needed to determine whether a non-local rheology model\ncan be modified to account for our findings.\n", "  An asymptotic solution is derived for the motion of inertial particles\nexposed to Stokes drag in an unsteady random flow. This solution provides the\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponents as a function of Stokes number and Lagrangian\nstrain- and rotation-rates autocovariances. The sum of these exponents, which\ncorresponds to a concentration-weighted divergence of particle velocity field,\nis considered as a measure of clustering. For inertial particles dispersed in\nan isotropic turbulent flow our analysis predicts maximum clustering at an\nintermediate Stokes number and minimal clustering at small and large Stokes\nnumbers. Direct numerical simulations are performed for quantitative validation\nof our analysis, showing a reasonable agreement between the two.\n", "  $K^0\\bar{K}^0$ transitions in a medium followed by decay and regeneration of\n$K^0_{S}$-component are considered by means of perturbation theory. It is shown\nthat in the previous calculations the problem different from regeneration is\nsolved.\n", "  We introduce and study a generalization of majorization called relative\nsubmajorization and show that it has many applications to the resource theories\nof thermodynamics, bipartite entanglement, and quantum coherence. In\nparticular, we show that relative submajorization characterizes both the\nprobability and approximation error that can be obtained when transforming one\nresource to another, also when assisted by additional standard resources such\nas useful work or maximally-entangled states. These characterizations have a\ngeometric formulation as the ratios or differences, respectively, between the\nLorenz curves associated with the input and output resources. We also find\nseveral interesting bounds on the reversibility of a given transformation in\nterms of the properties of the forward transformation. The main technical tool\nused to establish these results is linear programming duality.\n", "  Loop amplitudes are conveniently expressed in terms of master integrals whose\ncoefficients carry the process dependent information. Similarly before\nintegration, the loop integrands may be expressed as a linear combination of\npropagator products with universal numerator-tensors. Such a decomposition is\nan important input for the numerical unitarity approach, which constructs\nintegrand coefficients from on-shell tree amplitudes. We present a new method\nto organise multi-loop integrands into a direct sum of terms that integrate to\nzero (surface terms) and remaining master integrands. This decomposition\nfacilitates a general, numerical unitarity approach for multi-loop amplitudes\ncircumventing analytic integral reduction. Vanishing integrals are well known\nas integration-by-parts identities. Our construction can be viewed as an\nexplicit construction of a complete set of integration-by-parts identities\nexcluding doubled propagators. Interestingly, a class of 'horizontal'\nidentities is singled out which hold as well for altered propagator powers.\n", "  We present the history of investigation of the dynamical properties of pairs\nand groups of genetically related long-period comets (other than the Kreutz\nsungrazing system). Members of a comet pair or group move in nearly identical\norbits and their origin as fragments of a common parent comet is\nunquestionable. The only variable is the time of perihelion passage, which\ndiffers from member to member considerably due primarily to an orbital-momentum\nincrement acquired during breakup. Meter-per-second separation velocities\naccount for gaps of years or tens of years, thanks to the orbital periods of\nmany millennia. The physical properties of individual members may not at all be\nalike, as illustrated by the trio of C/1988 A1, C/1996 Q1, and C/2015 F3. We\nexploit orbital similarity to examine whether the celebrated and as yet\nunidentified object, discovered from the Lick Observatory near the Sun at\nsunset on 1921 August 7, happened to be a member of such a pair and to track\ndown the long-period comet to which it could be genetically related. Our search\nshows that the Lick object, which could not be a Kreutz sungrazer, was most\nprobably a companion to comet C/1847 C1 (Hind), whose perihelion distance was\n~9 R_sun and true orbital period approximately 8300 years. The gap of 74.4\nyears between their perihelion times is consistent with a separation velocity\nof ~1 m/s that set the fragments apart following the parent's breakup in a\ngeneral proximity of perihelion during the previous return to the Sun in the\n7th millennium BCE.\n", "  Pareto selective forces optimize several targets at the same time, instead of\nsingle fitness functions. Systems subjected to these forces evolve towards\ntheir Pareto front, a geometrical object akin to the thermodynamical Gibbs\nsurface and whose shape and differential geometry underlie the existence of\nphase transitions. In this paper we outline the connection between the Pareto\nfront and criticality and critical phase transitions. It is shown how, under\ndefinite circumstances, Pareto selective forces drive a system towards a\ncritical ensemble that separates the two phases of a first order phase\ntransition. Different mechanisms implementing such Pareto selective dynamics\nare revised.\n", "  Interaction of axisymmetrically-polarized (radially or\nazimuthally-polarized), relativistically intense laser pulses (ALP) with\nunder-dense plasma is shown experimentally to be different from the interaction\nof conventional Gaussian pulses. The difference is clearly observed in distinct\nspectra of scattered laser light as well as in appearance of a strong side\nemission of second harmonic in the vicinity of focus spot. According 3D\nparticle-in-cell simulations, this is a result of instability in the\npropagation of ALP in under-dense plasma. Laser wakefield acceleration of\nelectrons by ALP, therefore, is less efficient than that by Gaussian laser\npulses but ALP may be interesting for efficient electron self-injection.\n", "  The clogging behavior of a symmetric binary mixture of particles that are\ndriven in opposite directions through constrictions is explored by Brownian\ndynamics simulations and theory. A dynamical state with a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry occurs where one species is flowing and the other is blocked for a\nlong time which can be tailored by the size of the constrictions. Moreover, we\nfind self-organized oscillations in clogging and unclogging of the two species.\nApart from statistical physics, our results are of relevance for fields like\nbiology, chemistry, and crowd management, where ions, microparticles,\npedestrians, or other particles are driven in opposite directions through\nconstrictions.\n", "  Non-invasive and ultra-accurate optical manipulation of nanometer objects has\nrecently gained a growing interest as a powerful enabling tool in\nnanotechnology and biophysics. In this context, Self-Induced Back-Action (SIBA)\ntrapping in nano-optical cavities has shown a unique potential for trapping and\nmanipulating nanometer-sized objects under low optical intensities. Yet, the\nexistence of the SIBA effect has that far only been evidenced indirectly\nthrough its enhanced trapping performances. In this article we present for the\nfirst time a direct experimental evidence of the self-reconfiguration of the\noptical potential experienced by a nanoparticle trapped in a plasmonic\nnanocavity. Our observations enable us gaining further understanding of the\nSIBA mechanism and determine the optimum conditions to boost the performances\nof SIBA-based nano-optical tweezers.\n", "  Odd-even double mass differences (DMD) of magic nuclei are found within the\napproach starting from the free $NN$ interaction with account for\nparticle-phonon coupling (PC) effects. We consider three PC effects: the phonon\ninduced effective interaction, the renormalization of the \"ends\" due to the\n$Z$-factor corresponding to the pole PC contribution to the nucleon mass\noperator and the change of the single-particle energies. The perturbation\ntheory in $g^2_L$, where $g_L$ is the vertex of the $L$-phonon creation, is\nused for PC calculations.\n  PC corrections to single-particle energies are found self-consistently with\nan approximate account for the tadpole diagram. Results for magic $^{40,48}$Ca,\n$^{56,78}$Ni, $^{100,132}$Sn and $^{208}$Pb nuclei are presented. For lighter\npart of this set of nuclei, from $^{40}$Ca till $^{56}$Ni, the cases divide\napproximately in half between those where the PC corrections to DMD values make\nagreement with the data better and the ones with the opposite result. In the\nmajor part of the cases of worsening of description of DMD, a poor\napplicability of the perturbation theory for the induced interaction is the\nmost probable reason of the phenomenon. For intermediate nuclei, $^{78}$Ni and\n$^{100}$Sn, there is no sufficiently accurate data on masses of nuclei\nnecessary for finding DMD values. Finally, for heavier nuclei, $^{132}$Sn and\n$^{208}$Pb, PC corrections always make agreement with the experiment better.\n", "  Rotation in planetary atmospheres plays an important role in regulating\natmospheric and oceanic heat flow, cloud formation and precipitation. Using the\nGoddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) three dimension General Circulation\nModel (3D-GCM) we investigate how the effects of varying rotation rate and\nincreasing the incident stellar flux on a planet set bounds on a planet's\nhabitable zone with its parent star. From ensemble climate simulations we\nidentify which factors are the primary controllers of uncertainty in setting\nthese bounds. This is shown in particular for fully coupled ocean (FCO) runs --\nsome of the first that have been utilized in this context. Results with a Slab\nOcean (SO) of 100m mixed layer depth are compared with a similar study by Yang\net al. 2014, which demonstrates consistency across models. However, there are\nclear differences for rotations rates of 1-16x present Earth sidereal day\nlengths between the 100m SO and FCO models, which points to the necessity of\nusing FCOs whenever possible. The latter was recently demonstrated quite\nclearly by Hu & Yang 2014 in their aquaworld study with a FCO when compared\nwith similar mixed layer ocean studies and by Cullum et al. 2014.\n  We also show how these results have implications for Venus in the early\nhistory of our Solar System since even at this time Venus received more solar\nflux than Earth does today while it may still have had a slow retrograde\nrotation. The Venus runs utilize a 2.9Gya solar spectrum generated with the\ncode of Claire et al. 2012, a modern Venus topography with an ocean filling the\nlowlands (giving an equivalent depth of 310 meters if spread across the entire\nsurface), atmosphere of 1 bar N2, CO2=0.4mb, CH4=0.001mb and present day\norbital parameters, radius, & gravity. We demonstrate that ancient Venus could\nhave had quite moderate surface temperatures given these assumptions.\n", "  We derive H{\\alpha} fluxes for a large spectroscopic and\nphotometric-redshift-selected sample of sources over GOODS-North and South in\nthe redshift range z = 3.8-5.0 with deep HST, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based\nobservations. The H{\\alpha} flux is inferred based on the offset between the\nIRAC 3.6 {\\mu}m flux and that predicted from the best-fit SED. We demonstrate\nthat the H{\\alpha} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation\nrate (SFR) and therefore can serve as an independent SFR indicator. However, we\nalso find a systematic offset in the SFR_H{\\alpha}/SFR_UV ratios for z ~ 4-5\ngalaxies relative to local relations (assuming the same dust corrections for\nnebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest\ntension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing\nthe dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low\nmetallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the\nL_H{\\alpha}/SFR ratio). Using H{\\alpha} as a SFR indicator, we find a\nnormalization of the star formation main sequence in good agreement with recent\nSED-based determinations and also derive the SFR functions at z ~ 4-8. In\naddition, we assess for the first time the burstiness of star formation in z ~\n4 galaxies on <100 Myr time scales by comparing UV and H{\\alpha}-based sSFRs;\ntheir one-to-one relationship argues against significantly bursty\nstar-formation histories. Further progress will be made on these results, by\nincorporating new results from ALMA to constrain the dust-obscured star\nformation in high-redshift UV-selected samples.\n", "  Using a Kaluza-Klein-type lift, it is shown how Killing-Yano forms with\ntorsion can remain symmetries of a higher-dimensional geometry, subject to an\nalgebraic condition between the Kaluza-Klein field strength and the\nKilling-Yano form. The lift condition's significance is highlighted, and is\nsatisfied by examples of black holes in supergravity.\n", "  Recent years have seen an enormously revived interest in the study of\nthermodynamic notions in the quantum regime. This applies both to the study of\nnotions of work extraction in thermal machines in the quantum regime, as well\nas to questions of equilibration and thermalisation of interacting quantum\nmany-body systems as such. In this work we bring together these two lines of\nresearch by studying work extraction in a closed system that undergoes a\nsequence of quenches and equilibration steps concomitant with free evolutions.\nIn this way, we incorporate an important insight from the study of the dynamics\nof quantum many body systems: the evolution of closed systems is expected to be\nwell described, for relevant observables and most times, by a suitable\nequilibrium state. We will consider three kinds of equilibration, namely to (i)\nthe time averaged state, (ii) the Gibbs ensemble and (iii) the generalised\nGibbs ensemble (GGE), reflecting further constants of motion in integrable\nmodels. For each effective description, we investigate notions of entropy\nproduction, the validity of the minimal work principle and properties of\noptimal work extraction protocols. While we keep the discussion general, much\nroom is dedicated to the discussion of paradigmatic non-interacting fermionic\nquantum many-body systems, for which we identify significant differences with\nrespect to the role of the minimal work principle. Our work not only has\nimplications for experiments with cold atoms, but also can be viewed as\nsuggesting a mindset for quantum thermodynamics where the role of the external\nheat baths is instead played by the system itself, with its internal degrees of\nfreedom bringing coarse-grained observables to equilibrium.\n", "  The phase space of an area-preserving map typically contains infinitely many\nelliptic islands embedded in a chaotic sea. Orbits near the boundary of a\nchaotic region have been observed to stick for long times, strongly influencing\ntheir transport properties. The boundary is composed of invariant \"boundary\ncircles\". We briefly report recent results of the distribution of rotation\nnumbers of boundary circles for the H\\'enon quadratic map and show that the\nprobability of occurrence of small elements of their continued fraction\nexpansions is larger than would be expected for a number chosen at random.\nHowever, large elements occur with probabilities distributed proportionally to\nthe random case. The probability distributions of ratios of fluxes through\nisland chains is reported as well. These island chains are neighbours in the\nsense of the Meiss-Ott Markov-tree model. Two distinct universality families\nare found. The distributions of the ratio between the flux and orbital period\nare also presented. All of these results have implications for models of\ntransport in mixed phase space.\n", "  We investigate the disorder effect on coherent fraction and the quantum phase\ntransition of ultracold dilute Bose gases trapped in disordered optical\nlattices. Within the framework of Bogoliubov theory, an analytical expression\nfor the particle density is derived and the dependence of coherent fraction on\ndisorder strength as well as on lattice depth is discussed. In weak disorder\nregime, we find a decreased sensitivity of coherent fraction to disorder with\nthe increase of on-site interaction strength. For strong disorder, the quantum\nphase boundary between superfluid phase and Bose glass phase in the disordered\nBose-Hubbard system in weak interaction regime is discussed qualitatively. The\nobtained phase diagram is in agreement with the empirical square-root law. The\ndependence of the corresponding critical value of the disorder strength on\noptical lattice depth is presented as well, and may serve as a reference object\nfor possible experimental investigation.\n", "  At a critical temperature QCD in the chiral limit undergoes a chiral\nrestoration phase transition. Above the phase transition the quark condensate\nvanishes. The Banks-Casher relation connects the quark condensate to a density\nof the near-zero modes of the Dirac operator. In the Nambu-Goldstone mode the\nquasi-zero modes condense around zero, \\lambda \\rightarrow 0, and provide a\nnonvanishing quark condensate. The chiral restoration phase transition implies\nthat above the critical temperature there is no any longer a condensation of\nthe Dirac modes around zero. If a U(1)_A symmetry is also restored and a gap\nopens in the Dirac spectrum then the Euclidean correlation functions are\nSU(2N_f) \\supset SU(N_f)_L \\times SU(N_f)_R \\times U(1)_A- symmetric. This\nsymmetry implies that a free (deconfined) propagation of quarks in Minkowski\nspace-time that perturbatively interact with unconfined gluons is impossible.\nThis means that QCD above the critical temperature is not of a quark-gluon\nplasma origin and has a more complicated structure.\n", "  Many-body localization (MBL) is currently a hot issue of interacting systems,\nin which quantum mechanics overcomes thermalization of statistical mechanics.\nLike Anderson localization of non-interacting electrons, disorders are usually\ncrucial in engineering the quantum interference in MBL. For translation\ninvariant systems, however, the breakdown of eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis due to a \\emph{pure} many-body quantum effect is still unclear. Here\nwe demonstrate a possible MBL phenomenon without disorder, which emerges in a\nlightly doped Hubbard model with very strong interaction. By means of density\nmatrix renormalization group numerical calculation on a two-leg ladder, we show\nthat whereas a single hole can induce a very heavy Nagaoka polaron, two or more\nholes will form bound pair/droplets which are all localized excitations with\nflat bands at low energy densities. Consequently, MBL eigenstates of finite\nenergy density can be constructed as composed of these localized droplets\nspatially separated. We further identify the underlying mechanism for this MBL\nas due to a novel `Berry phase' of the doped Mott insulator, and show that by\nturning off this Berry phase either by increasing the anisotropy of the model\nor by hand, an eigenstate transition from the MBL to a conventional\nquasiparticle phase can be realized.\n", "  In single field slow roll inflation models the height and slope of the\npotential are to satisfy certain conditions, to match with observations. This\nin turn translates into bounds on the number of e-foldings and the excursion of\nthe scalar field during inflation. In this work we consider broad classes of\ninflationary models to study how much the field excursion starting from horizon\nexit to the end of inflation, $\\Delta \\phi $, can vary for the set of\ninflationary parameters given by Planck. We also derive an upper bound on the\nnumber of e-foldings between the horizon exit of a cosmologically interesting\nmode and the end of inflation. We comment on the possibility of having\nsuper-Planckian and sub-Planckian field excursions within the framework of\nsingle field slow roll inflation.\n", "  Masses of the three generations of charged leptons are known to completely\nsatisfy the Koide's mass relation. But the question remains if such a relation\nexists for neutrinos? In this paper, by considering SeeSaw mechanism as the\nmechanism generating tiny neutrino masses, we show how neutrinos satisfy the\nKoide's mass relation, on the basis of which we systematically give exact\nvalues of not only left but also right handed neutrino masses.\n", "  We present a special-relativistic analysis of deformable interferometers\nwhere counter propagating beams share a common optical path. The optical path\nis allowed to change rather arbitrarily and need not be stationary. We show\nthat, in the absence of dispersion the phase shift has two contributions. To\nleading order in $v/c$ one contribution is given by Wang empirical formula for\ndeformable Sagnac interferometers. The second contribution is due to the\nstretching of the optical path and we give an explicit formula for this stretch\nterm valid to first order in $v/c$. The analysis provides a unifying framework\nincorporating the Sagnac, Wang and Fizeau effects in a single scheme and gives\na rigorous proof of Wang empirical formula.\n", "  Solar variability investigations that include magnetic energy coupling are\nparamount to solving many key solar/stellar physics problems, particularly for\nunderstanding the temporal variability of magnetic energy redistribution and\nheating processes. Using three years of observations from the {\\it Solar\nDynamics Observatory's} Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Heliosemic Magnetic\nImager; radiative and magnetic fluxes were measured from gross features and at\nfull-disk scales, respectively. Magnetic energy coupling analyses support\nradiative flux descriptions via a plasma heating connectivity of dominant\n(magnetic) and diffuse components, specifically of the predominantly closed\nfield corona. Our work shows that this relationship favors an energetic\nredistribution efficiency across large temperature gradients, and potentially\nsheds light on the long withstanding issue of diffuse unresolved low corona\nemission. The intimacy of magnetic energy redistribution and plasma conditions\nrevealed by this work holds significant insight for the field of stellar\nphysics, as we have provided possible means for probing distant sources in\ncurrently limited and/or undetectable radiation distributions.\n", "  In systems where electrons form both dispersive bands and small local spins,\nwe show that changes of the spin configuration can tune the bands through a\nLifshitz transition, resulting in a continuous metal-insulator transition\nassociated with a progressive change of the Fermi surface topology. In contrast\nto a Mott-Hubbard and Slater pictures, this spin-driven Lifshitz transition\nappears in systems with small electron-electron correlation and large\nhybridization. We show that this situation is realized in 5$d$ distorted\nperovskites with an half-filled $t_{2g}$ bands such as NaOsO$_3$, where the\nstrong $p-d$ hybridization reduces the local moment, and spin-orbit coupling\ncauses a large renormalization of the electronic mobility. This weakens the\nrole of electronic correlations and drives the system towards an itinerant\nmagnetic regime which enables spin-fluctuations.\n", "  We present a systematic study of mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission from 141\nnearby supernovae (SNe) observed with the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on\nSpitzer.These SNe reside in one of the 190 galaxies within 20 Mpc drawn from\nthe ongoing SPIRITS program. We detect 8 Type Ia SNe and 36 core-collapse SNe.\nAll Type I SNe become undetectable within 3 years of explosion. About\n22$\\pm$11% of Type II SNe continue to be detected at late-times. Dust\nluminosity, temperature, and a lower liit on mass are obtained by fitting the\nSED using photometry with IRAC bands 1 and 2. The mass estimate does not\ndistinguish between pre-existing and newly produced dust. We observe warm dust\nmasses between $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-6}$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and dust temperatures\nfrom 200 K to 1280 K.We present detailed case studies of two extreme Type II-P\nSNe: SN 2011ja and 2014bi. SN 2011ja was over-luminous ([4.5] = -15.6 mag) at\n900 days post-explosion accompanied by the growing dust mass. This suggests\neither an episode of dust formation or an intensifying CSM interactions heating\nup pre-existing dust. SN 2014bi showed a factor of 10 decrease in dust mass\nover one month suggesting either an episode of dust destruction or a fading\nsource of dust heating. A rebrightening of the Type Ib SN 2014C is observed and\nattributed to CSM interactions. This observation adds to a small number of\nstripped-envelope SNe that have mid-IR excess. The observations suggest that\nthe CSM shell around SN 2014C is originated from an LBV-like eruption roughly\n100 years before the explosion. We also report detections of SN1974E, 1979C,\n1980K, 1986J, and 1993J detected more than 20 years post-explosion. The number\nof outlying SNe identified in this work demonstrates the power of late time\nmid-IR observations of a large sample of SNe to identify events with unusual\nevolution.\n", "  Hawking particles emitted by a black hole are usually found to have thermal\nspectra, if not exactly, then by a very good approximation. Here, we argue\ndifferently. It was discovered that spherical partial waves of in-going and\nout-going matter can be described by unitary evolution operators independently,\nwhich allows for studies of space-time properties that were not possible\nbefore. Unitarity dictates space-time, as seen by a distant observer, to be\ntopologically non-trivial. Consequently, Hawking particles are only locally\nthermal, but globally not: we explain why Hawking particles emerging from one\nhemisphere of a black hole must be 100 % entangled with the Hawking particles\nemerging from the other hemisphere. This produces exclusively pure quantum\nstates evolving in a unitary manner, and removes the interior region for the\noutside observer, while it still completely agrees locally with the laws of\ngeneral relativity. Unitarity is a starting point; no other assumptions are\nmade. Region I and the diametrically opposite region II of the Penrose diagram\nrepresent antipodal points in a PT or CPT relation, as was suggested before. On\nthe horizon itself, antipodal points are identified. A candidate instanton is\nproposed to describe the formation and evaporation of virtual black holes of\nthe type described here. Some important explanations and discussion points are\nadded. In the latest of the paper, again some minor inaccuracies are corrected.\n", "  In this paper, after referring to the Rastall theory, we address some of its\ncosmological consequences. Moreover, bearing the Clausius relation in mind,\nusing Friedman equations in Rastall theory and the Cai-Kim temperature, we\nobtain a relation for the apparent horizon entropy of a flat FLRW universe. In\naddition, we impose the entropy positivity condition on the obtained relation\nfor the horizon entropy, to find some constraints on the Rastall parameters.\nMoreover, we investigate the second and generalized second laws of\nthermodynamics. The results of considering a dominated prefect fluid with\nconstant state parameter are also addressed helping us familiarize with the\nRastall theory.\n", "  This is a writeup of lectures given at the EPFL Lausanne in the fall of 2012.\nThe topics covered: physical foundations of conformal symmetry, conformal\nkinematics, radial quantization and the OPE, and a very basic introduction to\nconformal bootstrap.\n", "  Chemical tagging promises to use detailed abundance measurements to identify\nspatially separated stars that were in fact born together (in the same\nmolecular cloud), long ago. This idea has not yielded much practical success,\npresumably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance\nmeasurements. We have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic\nmeasurements with The Cannon, which has now delivered 15 individual abundances\nfor ~100,000 stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with\nprecisions around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking\nat clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase\nspace. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the\n15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The Cannon, and plot the\nassociated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no\npositional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in\nabundance space are indeed clusters in phase space. We recover some known\nphase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This is the\nfirst-ever project to identify phase-space structures at survey-scale by blind\nsearch purely in abundance space; it verifies the precision of the abundance\nmeasurements delivered by The Cannon; the prospects for future data sets appear\nvery good.\n", "  The study of cosmology, galaxy formation and exoplanets has now advanced to a\nstage where a cosmic inventory of terrestrial planets may be attempted. By\ncoupling semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to a recipe that relates the\noccurrence of planets to the mass and metallicity of their host stars, we trace\nthe population of terrestrial planets around both solar-mass (FGK type) and\nlower-mass (M dwarf) stars throughout all of cosmic history. We find that the\nmean age of terrestrial planets in the local Universe is $7\\pm{}1$ Gyr for FGK\nhosts and $8\\pm{}1$ Gyr for M dwarfs. We estimate that hot Jupiters have\ndepleted the population of terrestrial planets around FGK stars by no more than\n$\\approx 10\\%$, and that only $\\approx 10\\%$ of the terrestrial planets at the\ncurrent epoch are orbiting stars in a metallicity range for which such planets\nhave yet to be confirmed. The typical terrestrial planet in the local Universe\nis located in a spheroid-dominated galaxy with a total stellar mass comparable\nto that of the Milky Way. When looking at the inventory of planets throughout\nthe whole observable Universe, we argue for a total of $\\approx 1\\times\n10^{19}$ and $\\approx 5\\times 10^{20}$ terrestrial planets around FGK and M\nstars, respectively. Due to light travel time effects, the terrestrial planets\non our past light cone exhibit a mean age of just $1.7\\pm 0.2$ Gyr. These\nresults are discussed in the context of cosmic habitability, the Copernican\nprinciple and searches for extraterrestrial intelligence at cosmological\ndistances.\n", "  The self-assembly in two dimensions of spherical magnets in strong magnetic\nfield is addressed theoretically. %% It is shown that the attraction and\nassembly of parallel magnetic chains is the result of a delicate interplay of\ndipole-dipole interactions and short ranged excluded volume correlations. %%\nMinimal energy structures are obtained by numerical optimization procedure as\nwell as analytical considerations. For a small number of constitutive magnets\n$N_{\\rm tot}\\leq26$, a straight chain is found to be stable. In the regime of\nlarger $N_{\\rm tot}\\geq27$, the magnets form \\textit{two touching} chains with\nequally long tails at both ends. We succeed to identify the transition from\n\\textit{two} to \\textit{three} touching chains at $N_{\\rm tot}=129$.\n", "  In the previous work we introduced the higher order $q$-Painlev\\'{e} system\n$q$-$P_{(n+1,n+1)}$ as a generalization of the Jimbo-Sakai's $q$-Painlev\\'{e}\nVI equation. It is derived from a $q$-analogue of the Drinfeld-Sokolov\nhierarchy of type $A^{(1)}_{2n+1}$ and admits a particular solution in terms of\nthe Heine's $q$-hypergeometric function ${}_{n+1}\\phi_n$. However the obtained\nsystem is insufficient as a generalization of $q$-$P_{\\rm{VI}}$ due to some\nreasons. In this article we rewrite the system $q$-$P_{(n+1,n+1)}$ to a more\nsuitable one.\n", "  The Square Kilometre Array's Low Frequency instrument (SKA-LOW) will be the\nmost sensitive aperture array ever used for radio astronomy, and will operate\nin the under-sampled regime for most of the frequency band where grating-lobes\npose particular challenges. To achieve the expected level of sensitivity for\nSKA-LOW, it is particularly important to understand how interfering sources in\nboth near and far side-lobes of the station beam affect the imaging\nperformance. We discuss options for station designs, and adopting a random\nelement layout, we assess its effectiveness by investigating how sources far\nfrom the main lobe of the station beam degrade images of the target field.\nThese sources have the effect of introducing a noise-like corruption to images,\nwhich we call the Far Side-lobe Source Noise (FSSN). Using OSKAR, a\nGPU-accelerated software simulator, we carried out end-to-end simulations using\nan all-sky model and telescope configuration representative of the SKA-LOW\ninstrument. The FSSN is a function of both the station beam and the\ninterferometric point spread function, and decreases with increasing\nobservation time until the coverage of the aperture plane no longer improves.\nUsing apodisation to reduce the level of near-in side-lobes of the station beam\nhad a noticeable improvement on the level of FSSN at low frequencies. Our\nresults indicate that the effects of picking up sources in the side-lobes are\nworse at low frequencies, where the array is less sparse.\n", "  It has been argued that stanene has lowest lattice thermal conductivity among\n2D group-IV materials because of largest atomic mass, weakest interatomic\nbonding, and enhanced ZA phonon scattering due to the breaking of an\nout-of-plane symmetry selection rule. However, we show that although the\nlattice thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ for graphene, silicene and germanene\ndecreases monotonically with decreasing Debye temperature, unexpected higher\n$\\kappa$ is observed in stanene. By enforcing all the invariance conditions in\n2D materials and including Ge $3d$ and Sn $4d$ electrons as valence electrons\nfor germanene and stanene respectively, the lattice dynamics in these materials\nare accurately described. A large acoustic-optical gap and the bunching of the\nacoustic phonon branches significantly reduce phonon scattering in stanene,\nleading to higher thermal conductivity than germanene. The vibrational origin\nof the acoustic-optical gap can be attributed to the buckled structure.\nInterestingly, a buckled system has two competing influences on phonon\ntransport: the breaking of the symmetry selection rule leads to reduced thermal\nconductivity, and the enlarging of the acoustic-optical gap results in enhanced\nthermal conductivity. The size dependence of thermal conductivity is\ninvestigated as well. In nanoribbons, the $\\kappa$ of silicene, germanene and\nstanene is much less sensitive to size effect due to their short intrinsic\nphonon mean free paths. This work sheds light on the nature of phonon transport\nin buckled 2D materials.\n", "  This paper derives accuracy standards for model gravitational waveforms\nrequired to ensure proper use of the Allen $\\chi^2$ discriminator in\ngravitational wave (GW) data analysis. These standards are different from\npreviously established requirements for detection and waveform parameter\nmeasurement based on signal-to-noise optimization. We present convenient\nformulae for evaluating and interpreting the contribution of model errors to\nmeasured values of this $\\chi^2$ statistic. The new accuracy standards derived\nhere are needed to ensure the reliability of measured values of the Allen\n$\\chi^2$ statistic, both in their traditional role as vetoes and in their\ncurrent role as elements in evaluating the significance of candidate\ndetections.\n", "  The possible exotic meson $Z_{c}(3900)$, found in $e^+ e^-$ reactions, is\nstudied by the method of coupled-channel scattering in lattice QCD. The\ninteraction among $\\pi J/\\psi$, $\\rho \\eta_{c}$ and $\\bar{D}D^{*}$ channels is\nderived from (2+1)-flavor QCD simulations at $m_{\\pi}=410$-$700$ MeV. The\ninteraction is dominated by the off-diagonal $\\pi J/\\psi$-$\\bar{D}D^{*}$ and\n$\\rho \\eta_{c}$-$\\bar{D}D^{*}$ couplings, which indicates that the\n$Z_{c}(3900)$ is not a usual resonance but a threshold cusp.\nSemi-phenomenological analyses with the coupled-channel interaction are\npresented to confirm this conclusion.\n", "  Quantum decision theory (QDT) is a recently developed theory of decision\nmaking based on the mathematics of Hilbert spaces, a framework known in physics\nfor its application to quantum mechanics. This framework formalizes the concept\nof uncertainty and other effects that are particularly manifest in cognitive\nprocesses, which makes it well suited for the study of decision making. QDT\ndescribes a decision maker's choice as a stochastic event occurring with a\nprobability that is the sum of an objective utility factor and a subjective\nattraction factor. QDT offers a prediction for the average effect of\nsubjectivity on decision makers, the quarter law. We examine individual and\naggregated (group) data, and find that the results are in good agreement with\nthe quarter law at the level of groups. At the individual level, it appears\nthat the quarter law could be refined in order to reflect individual\ncharacteristics. This article revisits the formalism of QDT along a concrete\nexample and offers a practical guide to researchers who are interested in\napplying QDT to a dataset of binary lotteries in the domain of gains.\n", "  We show that quantum Hall states on surfaces with conical singularities\nbehave as conformal primaries near the singular points, with a conformal\ndimension controlled by the gravitational anomaly. We show that the electronic\nfluid at the cone tip possesses an intrinsic angular momentum equal to the\nconformal dimension, in units of the Planck constant. Finally, we argue that\nthe gravitational anomaly also controls { the fine structure of electronic\ndensity at the tip, and } the exchange statistics of cones in the Laughlin\nstates, arising from adiabatically braiding conical singularities. Thus, the\ngravitational anomaly, which appears as a finite size correction on smooth\nsurfaces, dominates geometric transport on singular surfaces.\n", "  We study the relation between center vortex fluxes and monopole fluxes for\n$SU(2)$ gauge group in a model. This model is the same as thick center vortex\nmodel but we use monopole-antimonopole configurations instead of center\nvortices in the vacuum. Monopole-antimonopole configurations are line-like\nsimilar to center vortices. The group factor and potential for the fundamental\nrepresentation of these configurations are studied and compared with those of\ncenter vortices. As a result, we obtain monopole-vortex chains which appear in\nlattice Monte Carlo simulations, as well. If these monopole-vortex chains\nintersect the large Wilson loop in two points, screening is observed for the\npotential in the fundamental representation at large distances and confinement\nis observed when one leg of the chain intersects the Wilson loop.\n", "  Epidemic control is of great importance for human society. Adjusting\ninteracting partners is an effective individualized control strategy.\nIntuitively, it is done either by shortening the interaction time between\nsusceptible and infected individuals or by increasing the opportunities for\ncontact between susceptible individuals. Here, we provide a comparative study\non these two control strategies by establishing an epidemic model with\nnon-uniform stochastic interactions. It seems that the two strategies should be\nsimilar, since shortening the interaction time between susceptible and infected\nindividuals somehow increases the chances for contact between susceptible\nindividuals. However, analytical results indicate that the effectiveness of the\nformer strategy sensitively depends on the infectious intensity and the\ncombinations of different interaction rates, whereas the latter one is quite\nrobust and efficient. Simulations are shown in comparison with our analytical\npredictions. Our work may shed light on the strategic choice of disease\ncontrol.\n", "  The possible gamma ray burst occurred in location and temporal consistence\nwith gravitational wave event GW150914, as reported by Fermi Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor (GBM), offers a new way of constraining models with extra dimensions.\nUsing the time delay in arrival of the gamma ray transient observed by Fermi\nGBM relative to the gravitational waves event triggered by the LIGO detectors\nwe investigate the size of the spherical brane-universe expanding in\nmulti-dimensional space-time. It is shown that a joint observation of\ngravitational waves in association with gamma ray burst can provide a very\nstringent bound on the spatial curvature of the brain.\n", "  We study the effect of oxygen vacancies on the electronic structure of the\nmodel strongly correlated metal SrVO$_3$. By means of angle-resolved\nphotoemission (ARPES) synchrotron experiments, we investigate the systematic\neffect of the UV dose on the measured spectra. We observe the onset of a\nspurious dose-dependent prominent peak at an energy range were the lower\nHubbard band has been previously reported in this compound, raising questions\non its previous interpretation. By a careful analysis of the dose dependent\neffects we succeed in disentangling the contributions coming from the oxygen\nvacancy states and from the lower Hubbard band. We obtain the intrinsic ARPES\nspectrum for the zero-vacancy limit, where a clear signal of a lower Hubbard\nband remains. We support our study by means of state-of-the-art ab initio\ncalculations that include correlation effects and the presence of oxygen\nvacancies. Our results underscore the relevance of potential spurious states\naffecting ARPES experiments in correlated metals, which are associated to the\nubiquitous oxygen vacancies as extensively reported in the context of a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the surface of insulating $d^0$\ntransition metal oxides.\n", "  We present a detailed phenomenological study of W-boson production in\nassociation with a jet through next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in\nperturbative QCD. Fiducial cross sections and differential distributions for\nboth 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC collisions are presented, as are results for both the\ninclusive one-jet bin and the exclusive one-jet bin. Two different event\nselection criteria are considered: a general selection with standard cuts used\nin experimental analyses, and a boosted selection that focuses on high\ntransverse momentum jets. We discuss the higher-order corrections in detail and\nidentify for which observables and phase space regions the QCD perturbative\nexpansion is under good theoretical control, and where additional work is\nneeded. For most distributions and phase space regions the QCD perturbative\nexpansion exhibits good convergence after the inclusion of the NNLO\ncorrections.\n", "  Considerable work has recently been directed toward developing resource\ntheories of quantum coherence. In most approaches, a state is said to possess\nquantum coherence if it is not diagonal in some specified basis. In this letter\nwe establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory in\nterms of physical implementation of the free operations, and we show that all\ncurrently proposed basis-dependent theories of coherence fail to satisfy this\ncriterion. We further characterize the physically consistent resource theory of\ncoherence and find its operational power to be quite limited. After relaxing\nthe condition of physical consistency, we introduce the class of\ndephasing-covariant incoherent operations, present a number of new coherent\nmonotones based on relative R\\'{e}nyi entropies, and study incoherent state\ntransformations under different operational classes. In particular, we derive\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for qubit state transformations and show\nthese conditions hold for all classes of incoherent operations.\n", "  We find that unjammed packings of frictionless particles with rather weak\nattraction can always be driven into solid-like states by shear. The structure\nof shear-driven solids evolves continuously with packing fraction from gel-like\nto jamming-like, but is almost independent of the shear stress. In contrast,\nboth the density of vibrational states (DOVS) and force network evolve\nprogressively with the shear stress. There exists a packing fraction\nindependent shear stress $\\sigma_c$, at which the shear-driven solids are\nisostatic and have a flattened DOVS. Solid-like states induced by a shear\nstress greater than $\\sigma_c$ possess properties of marginally jammed solids\nand are thus strictly-defined shear jammed states. Below $\\sigma_c$, states at\nall packing fractions are under isostaticity and share common features in the\nDOVS and force network, although their structures can be rather different. Our\nstudy reveals the significance of the shear stress in determining properties of\nshear-driven solids and leads to an enriched jamming phase diagram for weakly\nattractive particles.\n", "  We report on a resonantly coupled 2(1) - 4 (1) photoassociation resonance in\nLiRb. This pair of states displays interesting decay physics that hint at\ninterference-like effects caused by two different decay paths. We observe decay\nto predominantly $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+ \\ v=43$, with significant numbers of molecules\nproduced in $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+ \\ v=2$ - 12. This photoassociation resonance also\nproduces $\\sim$300 $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+ \\ v=0 \\ J=0$ molecules/second. Finally, we\nidentify a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage transfer pathway from $v=43$ to\n$v=0$ that has the potential to produce up to $2 \\times 10^5$ LiRb\nmolecules/second in the $X \\ ^1\\Sigma^+ \\ v=0 \\ J=0$ state.\n", "  The primary astrophysical source of the rare earth elements is the rapid\nneutron capture process ($r$ process). The rare earth peak that is seen in the\nsolar $r$-process residuals has been proposed to originate as a pile-up of\nnuclei during the end of the $r$ process. We introduce a new method utilizing\nMonte Carlo studies of nuclear masses in the rare earth region, that includes\nself-consistently adjusting $\\beta$-decay rates and neutron capture rates, to\nfind the mass surfaces necessary for the formation of the rare earth peak. We\ndemonstrate our method with two types of astrophysical scenarios, one\ncorresponding conditions typical of core-collapse supernova winds and one\ncorresponding to conditions typical of the ejection of the material from the\ntidal tails of neutron star mergers. In each type of astrophysical conditions,\nthis method successfully locates a region of enhanced stability in the mass\nsurface that is responsible for the rare earth peak. For each scenario, we find\nthat the change in the mass surface has qualitatively different features, thus\nfuture measurements can shed light on the type of environment in which the $r$\nprocess occurred.\n", "  We study the effective field theory that describes the low-energy physics of\nself-gravitating media. The field content consists of four derivatively coupled\nscalar fields that can be identified with the internal comoving coordinates of\nthe medium. Imposing SO(3) internal spatial invariance, the theory describes\nsupersolids. Stronger symmetry requirements lead to superfluids, solids and\nperfect fluids, at lowest order in derivatives. In the unitary gauge, massive\ngravity emerges, being thus the result of a continuous medium propagating in\nspacetime. Our results can be used to explore systematically the effects and\nsignatures of modifying gravity consistently at large distances. The dark\nsector is then described as a self-gravitating medium with dynamical and\nthermodynamic properties dictated by internal symmetries. These results\nindicate that the divide between dark energy and modified gravity, at large\ndistance scales, is simply a gauge choice.\n", "  To exploit a given physical system for quantum information processing, it is\ncritical to understand the different types of noise affecting quantum control.\nDistinguishing coherent and incoherent errors is extremely useful as they can\nbe reduced in different ways. Coherent errors are generally easier to reduce at\nthe hardware level, e.g. by improving calibration, whereas some sources of\nincoherent errors, e.g. T2* processes, can be reduced by engineering robust\npulses. In this work, we illustrate how purity benchmarking and randomized\nbenchmarking can be used together to distinguish between coherent and\nincoherent errors and to quantify the reduction in both of them due to using\noptimal control pulses and accounting for the transfer function in an electron\nspin resonance system. We also prove that purity benchmarking provides bounds\non the optimal fidelity and diamond norm that can be achieved by correcting the\ncoherent errors through improving calibration.\n", "  By starting with a simple configurations of 2 neutrons in a single j shell we\nhare able to learn the effects of high lying configurations on physical\nproperties such as nuclear magnetic g factors. Some counterintuitive results\nare found when both high lying spin orbit partners are allowed to admix with\nthe basic configuration.\n", "  We study a lattice model of interacting Dirac fermions in $(2+1)$ dimension\nspace-time with an SU(4) symmetry. While increasing interaction strength, this\nmodel undergoes a {\\it continuous} quantum phase transition from the weakly\ninteracting Dirac semimetal to a fully gapped and nondegenerate phase without\ncondensing any Dirac fermion bilinear mass operator. This unusual mechanism for\nmass generation is consistent with recent studies of interacting topological\ninsulators/superconductors, and also consistent with recent progresses in\nlattice QCD community.\n", "  For multilevel spin systems, robustness of the quantum mechanical (QM)\nviolation of macrorealism (MR) with respect to coarse grained measurements is\ninvestigated using three different necessary conditions of MR, namely, the\nLeggett-Garg inequality (LGI), Wigner's form of the Leggett-Garg inequality\n(WLGI) and the condition of no-signalling in time (NSIT). It is shown that for\ndichotomic sharp measurements, in the asymptotic limit of spin, the algebraic\nmaxima of the QM violations of all these three necessary conditions of MR are\nattained. Importantly, the QM violations of all these persist in that limit\neven for \\textit{arbitrary} unsharp measurements, i.e. for any non zero value\nof the sharpness parameter characterizing the degree of fuzziness of the\nrelevant measurements. We also find that when different measurement outcomes\nare clubbed into two groups for the sake of dichotomising the outcomes, the\nasymmetry/symmetry in the number of outcomes in the two groups, signifying the\ndegree of coarse graining of measurements, has a crucial role in discerning\nquantum violation of MR. The results clearly demonstrate that classicality does\nnot emerges in the asymptotic limit of spin, whatever be the unsharpness and\ndegree of coarse graining of the measurements.\n", "  We study collective excitations in hot rotating chiral media in presence of\nmagnetic field in kinetic theory, namely Chiral Heat Wave and its' mixings with\nChiral Vortical Wave and Chiral Magnetic Wave. Our results for velocities of\nthese waves have slight alterations from those obtained earlier. We explain the\norigin of these alterations and also give the most general expressions for the\nvelocities of all these waves in hydrodynamic approach.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the phase sensitivity with parity detection on\nan SU(1,1) interferometer with a coherent state combined with a squeezed vacuum\nstate. This interferometer is formed with two parametric amplifiers for beam\nsplitting and recombination instead of beam splitters. We show that the\nsensitivity of estimation phase approaches Heisenberg limit and give the\ncorresponding optimal condition. Moreover, we derive the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao\nbound of the SU(1,1) interferometer.\n", "  In this note we extend previous work on efficiency corrections for cumulant\nmeasurements [1,2]. We will discuss the limitations of the methods presented in\nthese papers. Specifically we will consider multiplicity dependent efficiencies\nas well as a non-binomial efficiency distributions. We will discuss the most\nsimple and straightforward methods to implement those corrections.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms have long relied on Jastrow factors to\nincorporate dynamic correlation into trial wave functions. While Jastrow-type\nwave functions have been widely employed in real-space algorithms, they have\nseen limited use in second-quantized QMC methods, particularly in projection\nmethods that involve a stochastic evolution of the wave function in imaginary\ntime. Here we propose a scheme for generating Jastrow-type correlated trial\nwave functions for auxiliary-field QMC methods. The method is based on\ndecoupling the two-body Jastrow into one-body projectors coupled to auxiliary\nfields, which then operate on a single determinant to produce a\nmulti-determinant trial wave function. We demonstrate that intelligent sampling\nof the most significant determinants in this expansion can produce compact\ntrial wave functions that reduce errors in the calculated energies. Our\ntechnique may be readily generalized to accommodate a wide range of two-body\nJastrow factors and applied to a variety of model and chemical systems.\n", "  Although both RNA and proteins have densely packed native structures, chain\norganizations of these two biopolymers are fundamentally different. Motivated\nby the recent discoveries in chromatin folding that interphase chromosomes have\nterritorial organization with signatures pointing to metastability, we analyzed\nthe biomolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank and found that\nthe intrachain contact probabilities, $P(s)$ as a function of the arc length\n$s$, decay in power-law $\\sim s^{-\\gamma}$ over the intermediate range of $s$,\n$10\\lesssim s\\lesssim 110$. We found that the contact probability scaling\nexponent is $\\gamma\\approx 1.11$ for large RNA ($N>110$), $\\gamma\\approx 1.41$\nfor small sized RNA ($N<110$), and $\\gamma\\approx 1.65$ for proteins. Given\nthat Gaussian statistics is expected for a fully equilibrated chain in polymer\nmelts, the deviation of $\\gamma$ value from $\\gamma=1.5$ for the subchains of\nlarge RNA in the native state suggests that the chain configuration of RNA is\nnot fully equilibrated. It is visually clear that folded structures of large\nsized RNA ($N\\gtrsim 110$) adopt crumpled structures, partitioned into modular\nmulti-domains assembled by proximal sequences along the chain, whereas the\npolypeptide chain of folded proteins looks better mixed with the rest of the\nstructure. Our finding of $\\gamma\\approx 1$ for large RNA might be an\nineluctable consequence of the hierarchical ordering of the secondary to\ntertiary elements in the folding process.\n", "  A class of $k$-Essence cosmological models, with a power law kinetic term, is\nquantised in the mini-superspace. It is shown that for a specific\nconfiguration, corresponding to a pressureless fluid, a Schr\\\"odinger-type\nequation is obtained with the scalar field playing the r\\^ole of time. The\nresulting quantum scenario reveals a bounce, the classical behaviour being\nrecovered asymptotically.\n", "  In the coset model based on (A_{N-1}^{(1)} \\oplus A_{N-1}^{(1)},\nA_{N-1}^{(1)}) at level (N, N; 2N), it is known that the N=2 superconformal\nalgebra can be realized by the two kinds of adjoint fermions. Each Kac-Moody\ncurrent of spin-1 is given by the product of fermions with structure constant\n(f symbols) as usual. One can construct the spin-1 current by combining the\nabove two fermions with the structure constant and the spin-1 current by\nmultiplying these two fermions with completely symmetric SU(N) invariant tensor\nof rank 3 (d symbols). The lowest higher spin-2 current with nonzero U(1)\ncharge (corresponding to the zeromode eigenvalue of spin-1 current of N=2\nsuperconformal algebra) can be obtained from these four spin-1 currents in\nquadratic form. Similarly, the other type of lowest higher spin-2 current,\nwhose U(1) charge is opposite to the above one, can be obtained also. Four\nhigher spin-5/2 currents can be constructed from the operator product\nexpansions (OPEs) between the spin-3/2 currents of N=2 superconformal algebra\nand the above two higher spin-2 currents. The two higher spin-3 currents can be\ndetermined by the OPEs between the above spin-3/2 currents and the higher\nspin-5/2 currents. Finally, the ten N=2 OPEs between the four N=2 higher spin\nmultiplets (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3), (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3), (7/2, 4, 4, 9/2) and (7/2, 4, 4,\n9/2) are obtained explicitly for generic N.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to constrain modified gravity with redshift space\ndistortion observations and supernovae measurements. Compared with a standard\nLCDM analysis, we include three additional free parameters, namely the initial\nconditions of the matter perturbations,the overall perturbation normalization,\nand a scale-dependent Y parameter modifying the Poisson equation, in an attempt\nto perform a more model-independent analysis. First, we constrain the Poisson\nparameter Y (also called Geff ) by using currently available fsigma_8 data and\nthe recent SN catalog JLA. We find that the inclusion of the additional free\nparameters makes the constraints significantly weaker than when fixing them to\nthe standard cosmological value. Second, we constrain Y by using forecast\ngrowth-rate data for Euclid and SKA missions. Here again we point out the\nweakening of the constraints when the additional parameters are included.\nFinally, we adopt as modified gravity Poisson parameter the specific Horndeski\nform, and use scale-dependent forecasts to build an exclusion plot for the\nYukawa potential akin to the ones realized in laboratory experiments, both for\nthe Euclid and the SKA surveys.\n", "  The paper is devoted to numerical study of stability of nonlinear localized\nmodes (\"gap solitons\") for the spatially one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation (1D GPE) with periodic potential and repulsive interparticle\ninteractions. We use the Evans function approach combined with the exterior\nalgebra formulation in order to detect and describe weak oscillatory\ninstabilities. We show that the simplest (\"fundamental\") gap solitons in the\nfirst and in the second spectral gaps can undergo oscillatory instabilities for\ncertain values of the frequency parameter (i.e., the chemical potential). The\nnumber of unstable eigenvalues and the associated instability rates are\ndescribed. Several stable and unstable more complex (non-fundamental) gap\nsolitons are also discussed. The results obtained from the Evans function\napproach are independently confirmed using the direct numerical integration of\nthe GPE.\n", "  Extended numerical simulations of threshold models have been performed on a\nhuman brain network with N=836733 connected nodes available from the Open\nConnectome project. While in case of simple threshold models a sharp\ndiscontinuous phase transition without any critical dynamics arises, variable\nthresholds models exhibit extended power-law scaling regions. This is\nattributed to fact that Griffiths effects, stemming from the\ntopological/interaction heterogeneity of the network, can become relevant if\nthe input sensitivity of nodes is equalized. I have studied the effects effects\nof link directness, as well as the consequence of inhibitory connections.\nNon-universal power-law avalanche size and time distributions have been found\nwith exponents agreeing with the values obtained in electrode experiments of\nthe human brain. The dynamical critical region occurs in an extended control\nparameter space without the assumption of self organized criticality.\n", "  Using ALMA observations of the C$^{18}$O(2-1) line emission of the gas\nenvelope of protostar L1527, we have reconstructed its morphology and\nkinematics under the assumption of axisymmetry about the west-east axis. The\nmain original contribution to our understanding of the formation process of\nL1527 is the presentation of a simple 3D parameterisation based solely on\nregions that are not dominated by absorption. In the explored range ($\\sim$0.7\nto 5 arcsec from the star) the model reproduces observations better than\nearlier attempts. The main results include: a measurement of the rotation\nvelocity that confirms its evolution to Keplerian toward short distances; a\nmeasurement of the mean in-fall velocity, 0.43$\\pm$0.10 kms$^{-1}$, lower than\nfree fall velocity, with no evidence for the significant $r$-dependence\nsuggested by an earlier analysis; a measurement of the central mass,\n0.23$\\pm$0.06 M$_{\\odot}$ within a distance of 1.5 arcsec from the star, in\nagreement with earlier estimates obtained from a different range of distances;\nevidence for a strong disc plane depression of the in-falling flux resulting in\nan $X$ shaped flow possibly caused by the freeze-out of CO molecules on dust\ngrains; a measurement of the accretion rate, 3.5$\\pm$1.0 10$^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1 arcsec (140 au) from the star; evidence\nfor a 10$^\\circ$ tilt of the symmetry plane of the envelope about the line of\nsight, cancelling below $\\sim$3 arcsec from the star, but matching infrared\nobservations and being also apparent on the sky map of the mean Doppler\nvelocity.\n", "  We describe seven exoplanets transiting stars of brightness V = 10.1 to 12.4.\nWASP-130b is a \"warm Jupiter\" having an orbital period of 11.6 d around a\nmetal-rich G6 star. Its mass and radius (1.23 +/- 0.04 Mjup; 0.89 +/- 0.03\nRjup) support the trend that warm Jupiters have smaller radii than hot\nJupiters. WASP-131b is a bloated Saturn-mass planet (0.27 Mjup; 1.22 Rjup). Its\nlarge scale height and bright (V = 10.1) host star make it a good target for\natmospheric characterisation. WASP-132b (0.41 Mjup; 0.87 Rjup) is among the\nleast irradiated and coolest of WASP planets, having a 7.1-d orbit around a K4\nstar. WASP-139b is a \"super-Neptune\" akin to HATS-7b and HATS-8b, being the\nlowest-mass planet yet found by WASP (0.12 Mjup; 0.80 Rjup). The metal-rich K0\nhost star appears to be anomalously dense, akin to HAT-P-11. WASP-140b is a\n2.4-Mjup planet in an eccentric (e = 0.047 +/- 0.004) 2.2-d orbit. The planet's\nradius is large (1.4 Rjup), but uncertain owing to the grazing transit (b =\n0.93). The 10.4-day rotation period of the K0 host star suggests a young age,\nand the timescale for tidal circularisation is likely to be the lowest of all\nknown eccentric hot Jupiters. WASP-141b (2.7 Mjup, 1.2 Rjup, P = 3.3 d) and\nWASP-142b (0.84 Mjup, 1.53 Rjup, P = 2.1 d) are typical hot Jupiters orbiting\nmetal-rich F stars. We show that the period distribution within the hot-Jupiter\nbulge does not depend on the metallicity of the host star.\n", "  A numerical study of Anderson transition on random regular graphs (RRG) with\ndiagonal disorder is performed. The problem can be described as a tight-binding\nmodel on a lattice with N sites that is locally a tree with constant\nconnectivity. In certain sense, the RRG ensemble can be seen as\ninfinite-dimensional ($d\\to\\infty$) cousin of Anderson model in d dimensions.\nWe focus on the delocalized side of the transition and stress the importance of\nfinite-size effects. We show that the data can be interpreted in terms of the\nfinite-size crossover from small ($N\\ll N_c$) to large ($N\\gg N_c$) system,\nwhere $N_c$ is the correlation volume diverging exponentially at the\ntransition. A distinct feature of this crossover is a nonmonotonicity of the\nspectral and wavefunction statistics, which is related to properties of the\ncritical phase in the studied model and renders the finite-size analysis highly\nnon-trivial. Our results support an analytical prediction that states in the\ndelocalized phase (and at $N\\gg N_c$) are ergodic in the sense that their\ninverse participation ratio scales as $1/N$.\n", "  The Differential Transfer Matrix Method is extended to the complex plane,\nwhich allows dealing with singularities at turning points. The result for\nreal-valued systems are simplified and a pair of basis functions is found.\nThese bases are a bit less accurate than WKB solutions but much easier to work\nwith because of their algebraic form. Furthermore, these bases exactly satisfy\nthe initial conditions and may go over the turning points without the divergent\nbehavior of WKB solutions. The findings of this paper allow explicit evaluation\nof eigenvalues of confined modes with high precision, as demonstrated by few\nexamples.\n", "  Various pieces of insight were needed to formulate the rules for working with\ngauge theories of the electro-magnetic, weak and strong forces. First, it was\nneeded to understand how to formulate the Feynman rules. We had to learn that\nthere are many different ways to derive them, and it was needed to know how\ndifferent formulations of the gauge constraint lead to the same final results:\nthe calculated values of the scattering amplitudes. The rules for dealing with\nthe infinities that had to be subtracted were a big challenge, culminating in\nthe discovery of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry. Fond recollections of\nthe numerous discussions the author had with Raymond Stora on this topic are\nmemorised here. We end with some reflections on the mathematical status of\nquantum field theories, and a letter sent by Stora to the author\n", "  A point source on a plane constantly emits particles which rapidly diffuse\nand then stick to a growing cluster. The growth probability of a cluster is\npresented as a sum over all possible scenarios leading to the same final shape.\nThe classical point for the action, defined as a minus logarithm of the growth\nprobability, describes the most probable scenario and reproduces the Laplacian\ngrowth equation, which embraces numerous fundamental free boundary dynamics in\nnon-equilibrium physics. For non-classical scenarios we introduce virtual point\nsources, in which presence the action becomes the Kullback-Leibler entropy.\nStrikingly, this entropy is shown to be the sum of electrostatic energies of\nlayers grown per elementary time unit. Hence the growth probability of the\npresented non-equilibrium process obeys the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, which,\nas a rule, is not applied out from equilibrium. Each layer's probability is\nexpressed as a product of simple factors in an auxiliary complex plane after a\nproperly chosen conformal map. The action at this plane is a sum of Robin\nfunctions, which solve the Liouville equation. At the end we establish\nconnections of our theory with the tau-function of the integrable Toda\nhierarchy and with the Liouville theory for non-critical quantum strings.\n", "  It is well known that entropy can be used to holographically establish a\nconnection between geometry, thermodynamics and information theory. In this\npaper, we will use complexity to holographically establish a connection between\ngeometry, thermodynamics and information theory. Thus, we will analyse the\nrelation between holographic complexity, fidelity susceptibility, and\nthermodynamics in extended phase space. We will demonstrate that fidelity\nsusceptibility (which is the informational complexity dual to a maximum volume\nin AdS) can be related to the thermodynamical volume (which is conjugate to the\ncosmological constant in the extended thermodynamic phase space). Thus, this\nletter establishes a relation between geometry, thermodynamics, and information\ntheory, using complexity.\n", "  High harmonic generation (HHG) from semiconductors and insulators has become\na very active area of research due to its great potential for developing\ncompact HHG devices. Here we show that by growing monolayers (ML) of insulators\non single-crystal metal surfaces, one can tune the harmonic spectrum by just\nvarying the thickness of the ultrathin layer, not the laser properties. This is\nshown from numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for\n$n$ML NaCl/Cu(111) systems ($n=1-50$) based on realistic potentials available\nin the literature. Remarkably, the harmonic cutoff increases linearly with $n$\nand as much as an order of magnitude when going from $n$ $=$ 1 to 30, while\nkeeping the laser intensity low and the wavelength in the near-infrared range.\nFurthermore, the degree of control that can be achieved in this way is much\nhigher than by varying the laser intensity. The origin of this behavior is the\nreduction of electronic \"friction\" when moving from the essentially discrete\nenergy spectrum associated with a few-ML system to the continuous energy\nspectrum (bands) inherent to an extended periodic system.\n", "  The prevalence of many urban phenomena changes systematically with population\nsize. We propose a theory that unifies models of economic complexity and\ncultural evolution to derive urban scaling. The theory accounts for the\ndifference in scaling exponents and average prevalence across phenomena, as\nwell as the difference in the variance within phenomena across cities of\nsimilar size. The central ideas are that a number of necessary complementary\nfactors must be simultaneously present for a phenomenon to occur, and that the\ndiversity of factors is logarithmically related to population size. The model\nreveals that phenomena that require more factors will be less prevalent, scale\nmore superlinearly and show larger variance across cities of similar size. The\ntheory applies to data on education, employment, innovation, disease and crime,\nand it entails the ability to predict the prevalence of a phenomenon across\ncities, given information about the prevalence in a single city.\n", "  A comprehensive study on the nature of the $Z_c(3900)$ resonant structure is\ncarried out in this work. By constructing the pertinent effective Lagrangians\nand considering the important final-state-interaction effects, we first give a\nunified description to all the relevant experimental data available, including\nthe $J/\\psi\\pi$ and $\\pi\\pi$ invariant mass distributions from the $e^+e^-\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ process, the $h_c\\pi$ distribution from $e^+e^-\\to h_c\\pi\\pi$ and\nalso the $D\\bar D^{*}$ spectrum in the $e^+e^-\\to D\\bar D^{*}\\pi$ process.\nAfter fitting the unknown parameters to the previous data, we search the pole\nin the complex energy plane and find only one pole in the nearby energy region\nin different Riemann sheets. Therefore we conclude that $Z_c(3900)$ is of\n$D\\bar D^*$ molecular nature, according to the pole counting rule\nmethod~[Nucl.~Phys.~A543, 632 (1992); Phys.~Rev.~D 35,~1633 (1987)]. We\nemphasize that the conclusion based upon the pole counting method is not\ntrivial, since both the $D\\bar D^{*}$ contact interactions and the explicit\n$Z_c$ exchanges are introduced in our analyses and they lead to the same\nconclusion.\n", "  The leading order of the large N limit of the O(N) symmetric phi-six theory\nin three dimensions has a phase which exhibits spontaneous breaking of scale\nsymmetry accompanied by a massless dilaton which is a Goldstone boson. At the\nnext-to-leading order in large N, the phi-six coupling has a beta function of\norder 1/N and it is expected that the dilaton acquires a small mass,\nproportional to the beta function and the condensate. In this note, we show\nthat this \"light dilaton\" is actually a tachyon. This indicates an instability\nof the phase of the theory with spontaneously broken approximate scale\ninvariance.\n", "  In this paper we argue that classical, asymptotically AdS spacetimes that\narise as states in consistent ultraviolet completions of Einstein gravity\ncoupled to matter must satisfy an infinite family of positive energy\nconditions. To each ball-shaped spatial region $B$ of the boundary spacetime,\nwe can associate a bulk spatial region $\\Sigma_B$ between $B$ and the bulk\nextremal surface $\\tilde{B}$ with the same boundary as $B$. We show that there\nexists a natural notion of a gravitational energy for every such region that is\nnon-negative, and non-increasing as one makes the region smaller. The results\nfollow from identifying this gravitational energy with a quantum relative\nentropy in the associated dual CFT state. The positivity and monotonicity\nproperties of the gravitational energy are implied by the positivity and\nmonotonicity of relative entropy, which holds universally in all quantum\nsystems.\n", "  Random networks of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) usually contain both\nmetallic (m-CNTs) and semiconducting (s-CNTs) nanotubes with an approximate\nratio of 1:2, which leads to a trade-off between on-conductance and on/off\nratio. We demonstrate how the design problem can be solved with a realistic\nnumerical approach. We determine CNT density, length, and channel dimensions\nfor which CNT thin-film transistors (TFTs) simultaneously attain on-conductance\nhigher than $1~{\\rm \\mu S}$ and on/off ratio higher than $10^4$. Fact that\nasymmetric systems have more pronounced finite-size scaling behavior than\nsymmetric, enables us additional design freedom. A realisation probability of\ndesired characteristics higher than 99\\% is obtained only with channel aspect\nlength to width ratios $L_{\\rm CH} / W_{\\rm CH} < 1.2$ and normalized channel\nsize $L_{\\rm CH}W_{\\rm CH} / l^2_{\\rm CNT} > 250$ for a range of CNT lengths\n$l_{\\rm CNT} = 4-20~{\\rm \\mu m}$.\n", "  The Advanced LIGO observatory recently reported the first direct detection of\ngravitational waves predicted by Einstein (1916). We report on the first\noptical observations of the Gravitational Wave (GW) source GW150914 error\nregion with the Global MASTER Robotic Net. We detected several optical\ntransients, which proved to be unconnected with the GW event. Our result is\nconsistent with the assumption that gravitational waves were produced by a\nbinary black hole merger. The detection of the event confirmed the main\nprediction of the population synthesis performed with the \"Scenario Machine\"\nformulated in Lipunov1997b.\n", "  Doped strontium titanate becomes superconducting at a density as low as n = 5\nx 10^17 cm^-3, where the Fermi energy is orders of magnitude smaller than the\nlongitudinal-optical-phonon frequencies. In this limit the only optical mode\nwith a frequency which is smaller than the Fermi energy is the plasmon. In\ncontrast to metals, the interaction strength is weak due to screening by the\ncrystal, which allows the construction of a controllable theory of plasmon\nsuperconductivity. We show that plasma mediated pairing alone can account for\nthe observed transition temperatures if the screening by the crystal is reduced\nin the slightly doped samples compared with the insulating ones. This mechanism\ncan also explain the pairing in the two-dimensional superconducting states\nobserved at surfaces and interfaces with other oxides. We also discuss unique\nfeatures of the plasmon mechanism, which appear in the tunneling density of\nstates above the gap.\n", "  The Weyl semimetals are topologically protected from a gap opening against\nweak disorder in three dimensions. However, a strong disorder drives this\nrelativistic semimetal through a quantum transition towards a diffusive\nmetallic phase characterized by a finite density of states at the band\ncrossing. This transition is usually described by a perturbative\nrenormalization group in $d=2+\\varepsilon$ of a $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model in the\nlimit $N \\to 0$. Unfortunately, this model is not multiplicatively\nrenormalizable in $2+\\varepsilon$ dimensions: An infinite number of relevant\noperators are required to describe the critical behavior. Hence its use in a\nquantitative description of the transition beyond one-loop is at least\nquestionable. We propose an alternative route, building on the correspondence\nbetween the Gross-Neveu and Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models developed in the context\nof high energy physics. It results in a model of Weyl fermions with a random\nnon-Gaussian imaginary potential which allows one to study the critical\nproperties of the transition within a $d=4-\\varepsilon$ expansion. We also\ndiscuss the characterization of the transition by the multifractal spectrum of\nwave functions.\n", "  We discuss the Schwinger pair creation process for the system of massless\nDirac fermions in the presence of constant external magnetic and electric\nfields. The pair production rate remains finite unlike the vacuum decay rate.\nIn the recently discovered Dirac semimetals, where the massless Dirac fermions\nemerge, this pair production may be observed experimentally through the\ntransport properties. We estimate its contribution to the ordinary conductivity\nof the semimetals.\n", "  We study experimentally the stability of excited, interacting states of\nbosons in a double-well optical lattice in regimes where the nonlinear\ninteractions are expected to induce \"swallowtail\" looped band structure. By\ncarefully preparing different initial coherent states and observing their\nsubsequent decay, we observe distinct decay rates that provide direct evidence\nfor multivalued, looped band structure. The double well lattice both stabilizes\nthe looped band structure and allows for dynamic preparation of different\ninitial states, including states within the loop structure. We confirm our\nstate preparation procedure with dynamic Gross-Pitaevskii calculations. The\nexcited loop states are found to be more stable than dynamically unstable\nground states, but decay faster than expected based on a mean-field stability\ncalculation, indicating the importance of correlations beyond a mean field\ndescription.\n", "  Primordial gravitational waves constitute a promising probe of the very early\nUniverse and the laws of gravity. We study in this work changes to tensor-mode\nperturbations (TMPs) that can arise in various proposed modified gravity (MG)\ntheories. These include additional friction effects, nonstandard dispersion\nrelations involving a massive graviton, a modified speed, and a small-scale\nmodification. We introduce a physically motivated parameterization of these\neffects and use current available data to obtain exclusion regions in the\nparameter spaces. Taking into account the foreground subtraction, we then\nperform a forecast analysis focusing on tensor-mode MG parameters as\nconstrained by future experiments COrE, Stage-IV and PIXIE. For a fiducial\nvalue of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.01$, we find that an additional\nfriction of $3.5\\sim4.5\\%$ compared to GR will be detected at $3$-$\\sigma$ by\nthese experiments, while a decrease in friction will be more difficult to\ndetect. The speed of gravitational waves needs to be by $5\\sim15\\%$ different\nfrom the speed of light for detection. We find that the minimum detectable\ngraviton mass is about $7.8\\sim9.7\\times 10^{-33}$ eV, which is of the same\norder of magnitude as the graviton mass that allows massive gravity theories to\nproduce cosmic acceleration. Finally, we study TMPs in MG during inflation\nusing our parameterization. We find that the tensor spectral index is related\nto $r$ and the friction parameter $\\nu_0$ by $n_T=-3\\nu_0-r/8$. Assuming that\nthe friction parameter is unchanged throughout the history of the Universe and\nis much larger than $r$, future experiments will be able to distinguish this MG\nconsistency relation from the standard inflation one, and thus can be used as a\nfurther test of MG. In summary, TMPs and cosmic-microwave-background B-mode\npolarization provide a complementary avenue to test gravity theories.\n(Abridged)\n", "  We discuss the use of atom interferometry as a tool to search for Dark Matter\n(DM) composed of ultra-light scalar fields. Previous work on ultra-light DM\ndetection using accelerometers has considered the possibility of equivalence\nprinciple violating effects whereby gradients in the dark matter field can\ndirectly produce relative accelerations between media of differing composition.\nIn atom interferometers, we find that time-varying phase signals from\noscillatory, or dilaton-like, DM can also arise due to changes in the atom rest\nmass that can occur between light-pulses throughout the interferometer sequence\nas well as changes in the earth's gravitational field. We estimate that several\norders of magnitude of unexplored phase space for light DM fields can be probed\nwith our proposed method.\n", "  We derive the relativistically exact Eikonal equation for ring\ninterferometers undergoing deformations. For ring interferometers that undergo\nslow deformation we describe the two leading terms in the adiabatic expansion\nof the phase shift. The leading term is independent of the refraction index $n$\nand is given by a line integral generalizing results going back to Sagnac\n\\cite{sagnac1913,wang2004,Ori} for non-deforming interferometers to all orders\nin {$\\beta=|\\mathbf{v}|/c$}. In the non-relativistic limit {this term} is\n$O(\\beta)$. The next term in the adiabaticity has the form of a double\nintegral, it is of order $\\beta^0$ and depends on the refractive index $n$. It\naccounts for non-reciprocity due to changing circumstances in the fiber. The\nadiabatic correction is often comparable to the Sagnac term. In particular,\nthis is the case in Fizeau's interferometer. Besides providing a mathematical\nframework that puts all ring interferometers under a single umbrella, our\nresults generalize and strengthen results of \\cite{Ori, shupe} to fibers with\nchromatic dispersion.\n", "  By coupling with a qubit, we demonstrate that qubit decoherence can\nunambiguously detect the occurrence of ground-state degeneracy in many-body\nsystems. We first demonstrate universality using the two-band model.\nConsequently, several exemplifications, focused on topological condensed matter\nsystems in one, two, and three dimensions, are presented to validate our\nproposal. The key point is that qubit decoherence varies significantly when\nenergy bands touch each other at the Fermi surface. In addition, it can\npartially reflect the degeneracy inside the band. This feature implies that\nqubit decoherence can be used for reliable diagnosis of ground-state\ndegeneracy.\n", "  A robust mechanism was recently proposed in which thermal freeze-out of WIMPs\ncan provide a unified origin of dark matter and baryon abundances in our\nuniverse. We point out that this WIMP-triggered baryogenesis mechanism can\nexhibit a rich collider phenomenology and be tested at the current and\nnear-future experiments at LHC, even in the case where the WIMPs are completely\ndevoid of SM gauge and higgs portal interactions, as may be motivated by the\npersistent null results of WIMP dark matter searches. We catalogue a rich array\nof LHC signatures robustly present in such a scenario. In particular, the\nsimplest such implementation can already offer a very clean signal of a\nTeV-scale resonance that decays to diphotons with a cross section that can\neasily be within the reach of the current and near-future LHC runs in the\nregion of parameter space that leads to a successful baryogenesis. Other\ncharacteristic signatures include the production of multi-bottom and/or\nmulti-top quarks, promptly or displaced. An even more exotic possibility is the\nproduction of two separate sets of isolated emerging jets connected by a\ncharged track, which may require new dedicated studies. Finally, di-nucleon\ndecay can also provide a powerful probe of the mechanism.\n", "  We study the production rate of ionizing photons of a sample of 588 H$\\alpha$\nemitters (HAEs) and 160 Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=2.2$ in the COSMOS\nfield in order to assess the implied emissivity from galaxies, based on their\nUV luminosity. By exploring the rest-frame Lyman Continuum (LyC) with\nGALEX/$NUV$ data, we find f$_{\\rm esc} < 2.8\\, (6.4)$% through median (mean)\nstacking. By combining the H$\\alpha$ luminosity density with IGM emissivity\nmeasurements from absorption studies, we find a globally averaged\n$\\langle$f$_{\\rm esc}\\rangle$ of $5.9^{+14.5}_{-4.2}$ % at $z=2.2$ if we assume\nHAEs are the only source of ionizing photons. We find similarly low values of\nthe global $\\langle$f$_{\\rm esc}\\rangle$ at $z\\approx3-5$, also ruling out a\nhigh $\\langle$f$_{\\rm esc}\\rangle$ at $z<5$. These low escape fractions allow\nus to measure $\\xi_{ion}$, the number of produced ionizing photons per unit UV\nluminosity, and investigate how this depends on galaxy properties. We find a\ntypical $\\xi_{ion} \\approx 10^{24.77\\pm0.04}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ for HAEs and\n$\\xi_{ion} \\approx 10^{25.14\\pm0.09}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ for LAEs. LAEs and low mass\nHAEs at $z=2.2$ show similar values of $\\xi_{ion}$ as typically assumed in the\nreionization era, while the typical HAE is three times less ionizing. Due to an\nincreasing $\\xi_{ion}$ with increasing EW(H$\\alpha$), $\\xi_{ion}$ likely\nincreases with redshift. This evolution alone is fully in line with the\nobserved evolution of $\\xi_{ion}$ between $z\\approx2-5$, indicating a typical\nvalue of $\\xi_{ion} \\approx 10^{25.4}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ in the reionization era.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of weak ergodicity breaking for a class of globally\ncorrelated random walk dynamics defined over a finite set of states. The\npersistence in a given state or the transition to another one depends on the\nwhole previous temporal history of the system. A set of waiting time\ndistributions, associated to each state, set the random times between\nconsecutive steps. Their mean value is finite for all states. The probability\ndensity of time-averaged observables is obtained for different memory\nmechanisms. This statistical object explicitly shows departures between time\nand ensemble averages. While the mean residence time in each state may result\ndivergent, we demonstrate that this condition is in general not necessary for\nbreaking ergodicity. Hence, global memory effects are an alternative mechanism\nable to induce this property. Analytical and numerical calculations support\nthese results.\n", "  We examine four candidate mechanisms that could explain the high surface\ntemperatures of magnetars. (1) Heat flux from the liquid core heated by\nambipolar diffusion. It could sustain the observed surface luminosity\n$L_s\\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s if core heating offsets neutrino cooling at a\ntemperature $T_{core}>6\\times 10^8$ K. This scenario is viable if the core\nmagnetic field exceeds $10^{16}$ G and the heat-blanketing envelope of the\nmagnetar has a light element composition. We find however that the lifetime of\nsuch a hot core should be shorter than the typical observed lifetime of\nmagnetars. (2) Mechanical dissipation in the solid crust. This heating can be\nquasi-steady, powered by gradual (or frequent) crustal yielding to magnetic\nstresses. We show that it obeys a strong upper limit. As long as the crustal\nstresses are fostered by the field evolution in the core or Hall drift in the\ncrust, mechanical heating is insufficient to sustain persistent $L_s\\approx\n10^{35}$ erg/s. The surface luminosity is increased in an alternative scenario\nof mechanical deformations triggered by external magnetospheric flares. (3)\nOhmic dissipation in the crust, in volume or current sheets. This mechanism is\ninefficient because of the high conductivity of the crust. Only extreme\nmagnetic configurations with crustal fields $B>10^{16}$ G varying on a 100\nmeter scale could provide $L_s\\approx 10^{35}$ erg/s. (4) Bombardment of the\nstellar surface by particles accelerated in the magnetosphere. This mechanism\nproduces hot spots on magnetars. Observations of transient magnetars show\nevidence for external heating.\n", "  Moving from the consideration that matter fields must be treated in terms of\ntheir fundamental quantum counterparts, we show straightforward arguments,\nwithin the framework of ordinary quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, in\norder to convince readers that cosmological perturbations must be addressed in\nterm of the semiclassical limit of the expectation value of quantum fields. We\nfirst take into account cosmological perturbations originated by a quantum\nscalar field, and then extend our treatment in order to account for the\nexpectation values of bilinears of Dirac fermion fields. The latter can indeed\ntransform as scalar quantities under diffeomorphisms, as well as all the other\nbilinear of the Dirac fields that belong to the Clifford algebra. This is the\nfirst of a series of works that is intended to prove that cosmological quantum\nperturbations can actually be accounted for in terms of Dirac fermion fields,\nwhich must be treated as fundamental quantum objects, and their dynamics.\n", "  We present a novel analysis of the internal kinematics of the Fornax dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy. Our results are based on the largest sample of spectroscopic\ndata for Fornax stars presently available ($> 2500$ stars), for which we have\nchemical and kinematic information. We introduce new software, Beacon, designed\nto detect chemo-kinematic patterns among stars of different stellar populations\nusing their metallicity and velocity along the line of sight. Applying Beacon\nto Fornax we have detected non-negligible rotation signals around main optical\naxes of the galaxy, characteristic for a triaxial system partially supported by\nrotation. The dominant rotation pattern is relatively strong ($\\sim 12$ km\ns$^{-1}$), but the galaxy also shows additional weaker albeit complex rotation\npatterns. Using the information available from the star formation history of\nFornax we have also derived the average age of the different chemo-kinematic\ncomponents found by Beacon, which has allowed us to obtain its kinematic\nhistory. Our results point to a possible major merger suffered by Fornax at\nredshift $z\\sim1$, in agreement with previous works.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) halos have long been known to be triaxial, but in studies of\npossible annihilation and decay signals they are often treated as approximately\nspherical. In this work, we examine the asymmetry of potential indirect\ndetection signals of DM annihilation and decay, exploiting the large statistics\nof the hydrodynamic simulation Illustris. We carefully investigate the effects\nof the baryons on the sphericity of annihilation and decay signals for both the\ncase where the observer is at 8.5 kpc from the center of the halo (exemplified\nin the case of Milky Way-like halos), and for an observer situated well outside\nthe halo. In the case of Galactic signals, we find that both annihilation and\ndecay signals are expected to be quite symmetric, with axis ratios very\ndifferent from 1 occurring rarely. In the case of extragalactic signals, while\ndecay signals are still preferentially spherical, the axis ratio for\nannihilation signals has a much flatter distribution, with elongated profiles\nappearing frequently. Many of these elongated profiles are due to large\nsubhalos and/or recent mergers. Comparing to gamma-ray emission from the Milky\nWay and X-ray maps of clusters, we find that the gamma-ray background appears\nless spherical/more elongated than the expected DM signal from the large\nmajority of halos, and the Galactic gamma ray excess appears very spherical,\nwhile the X- ray data would be difficult to distinguish from a DM signal by\nelongation/sphericity measurements alone.\n", "  We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams. In the second approach, referred as light-front approximation, we\nformulate the boost invariant nuclear spectral function in the light-front\nreference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams are generally suppressed and\nthe bound nucleon is described by its light-cone variables such as momentum\nfraction, transverse momentum and invariant mass.\n", "  We develop the model proposed by Cort\\^es, Gomes & Smolin, to predict\ncosmological signatures of time-asymmetric extensions of general relativity\nthey proposed recently. Within this class of models the equation of motion of\nchiral fermions is modified by a torsion term. This term leads to a dispersion\nlaw for neutrinos that associates a new time-varying energy with each particle.\nWe find a new neutrino contribution to the Friedmann equation resulting from\nthe torsion term in the Ashtekar connection. In this note we explore the\nphenomenology of this term and observational consequences for cosmological\nevolution. We show that constraints on the critical energy density will\nordinarily render this term unobservably small, a maximum of order $10^{-25}$\nof the neutrino energy density today. However, if the time-asymmetric dark\nenergy is tuned to cancel the cosmological constant, the torsion effect may be\na dark matter candidate.\n", "  We present expected values of the Single Spin Asymmetry (SSA) in $D$-meson\nproduction in the process $p+p^\\uparrow \\rightarrow D^0 + X $ at RHIC energy\n$(\\sqrt{s}=200\\text{ GeV})$ using a generalized parton model approach. We use\nfits to the gluon Sivers function obtained recently by D'Alesio {\\it et al.,}\nby fitting to the asymmetry data for the process $p+p^\\uparrow \\rightarrow\n\\pi^0+ X$ measured by the PHENIX collaboration at RHIC. These fits give peak\nasymmetry predictions which lie in a broad range, $0.5\\%\\lesssim\nA_N\\lesssim10\\%$ for the kinematic regions considered. This is to be compared\nwith the upper bound of 18\\% expected for the maximal gluon Sivers function. We\nextend our analysis to two other centre of mass energies of proposed\nexperiments - AFTER@LHC $(\\sqrt{s}=115\\text{ GeV})$ and a future RHIC run\n$(\\sqrt{s}=500\\text{ GeV})$. We further investigate (at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV) the\neffect of the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution of the unpolarized\nparton distribution functions (pdf's) and of the gluon Sivers function on the\nasymmetry predictions. We perform this study using an evolution setup given by\nAnselmino {\\it et al}. We find that the effect of evolution is an overall\nreduction of the asymmetry predictions. For example, for the saturated gluon\nSivers function, upon taking into account TMD evolution, peak asymmetry\npredictions reduce by a factor 3 or more. This decrease is similar to that\nnoticed earlier for Single Spin Asymmetries (SSA) in the electroproduction of\n$J/\\psi$.\n", "  The attenuation of starlight by dust in galactic environments is investigated\nthrough models of radiative transfer in a spherical, clumpy ISM. Extinction\nproperties for MW, LMC, and SMC dust types are considered. It is illustrated\nthat the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength\ndependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction\n(absorption+scattering) curve. Attenuation curves consistent with the \"Calzetti\nattenuation curve\" are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model\nfor the MW, but with the 2175A absorption bump suppressed or absent. The\ndiscrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the SMC-type\ndust to be the most likely origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the\ndifference in adopted albedos; this study uses the theoretically calculated\nalbedos whereas the previous ones adopted empirically derived albedos from\nobservations of reflection nebulae. It is also found that the model attenuation\ncurves calculated with the MW dust are well represented by a modified Calzetti\ncurve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between\nthe slope and UV bump strength, with steeper curves having stronger bumps, as\nfound in star-forming galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0, is well reproduced by our models\nif the abundance of the UV bump carriers or PAHs is assumed to be 30% or 40% of\nthat of the MW-dust. The trend is explained by radiative transfer effects which\nlead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more\nclumpy and dustier. We also argue that at least some of the IUE local starburst\ngalaxies may have a UV bump feature in their attenuation curves, albeit much\nweaker than that of the MW extinction curve.\n", "  Discrete-time quantum walks are well-known for exhibiting localization, a\nquantum phenomenon where the walker remains at its initial location with high\nprobability. In companion with a joint Letter, we introduce oscillatory\nlocalization, where the walker alternates between two states. The walk is given\nby the flip-flop shift, which is easily defined on non-lattice graphs, and the\nGrover coin. Extremely simple examples of the localization exist, such as a\nwalker jumping back and forth between two vertices of the complete graph. We\nshow that only two kinds of states, called flip states and uniform states,\nexhibit exact oscillatory localization. So the projection of an arbitrary state\nonto these gives a lower bound on the extent of oscillatory localization. Thus\nwe completely characterize the states that oscillate under the quantum walk.\n", "  We calculate the dark matter halo correlation function in redshift space\nusing the Gaussian streaming model (GSM). To determine the scale dependent\nfunctions entering the streaming model we use local Lagrangian bias together\nwith Convolution Lagrangian perturbation theory (CLPT) which constitutes an\napproximation to the Post-Zel'dovich approximation. On the basis of N-body\nsimulations we demonstrate that a smoothing of the initial conditions with the\nLagrangian radius improves the Zel'dovich approximation and its ability to\npredict the displacement field of proto-halos. Based on this observation we\nimplement a \"truncated\" CLPT by smoothing the initial power spectrum and\ninvestigate the dependence of the streaming model ingredients on the smoothing\nscale. We find that the real space correlation functions of halos and their\nmean pairwise velocity are optimised if the coarse graining scale is chosen to\nbe 1 Mpc/h at z=0, while the pairwise velocity dispersion is optimised if the\nsmoothing scale is chosen to be the Lagrangian size of the halo. We compare\ntheoretical results for the halo correlation function in redshift space to\nmeasurements within the Horizon Run 2 N-body simulation halo catalog. We find\nthat this simple two-filter smoothing procedure in the spirit of the truncated\nZel'dovich approximation significantly improves the GSM+CLPT prediction of the\nredshift space halo correlation function over the whole mass range from large\ngalaxy to galaxy cluster-sized halos.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of stationary states composed of vortex lines\nattached to planar dark solitons in scalar Bose-Einstein condensates.\nDynamically stable states of this type are found at low values of the chemical\npotential in channeled condensates, where the long-wavelength instability of\ndark solitons is prevented. In oblate, harmonic traps, U-shaped vortex lines\nattached by both ends to a single planar soliton are shown to be long-lived\nstates. Our results are reported for parameters typical of current experiments,\nand open up a way to explore the interplay of different topological structures.\nThese configurations provide Dirichlet boundary conditions for vortex lines and\nthereby mimic open strings attached to D-branes in string theory. We show that\nthese similarities can be formally established by mapping the Gross-Pitaevskii\ntheory into a dual effective string theory for open strings via a boson-vortex\nduality in 3+1 dimensions. Combining a one-form gauge field living on the\nsoliton plane which couples to the endpoints of vortex lines and a two-form\ngauge field which couples to vortex lines, we obtain a gauge-invariant dual\naction of open vortex lines with their endpoints attached to dark solitons.\n", "  Tunneling between a point contact and a one-dimensional wire is usually\ndescribed with the help of a tunneling Hamiltonian that contains a delta\nfunction in position space. Whereas the leading order contribution to the\ntunneling current is independent of the way this delta function is regularized,\nhigher-order corrections with respect to the tunneling amplitude are known to\ndepend on the regularization. Instead of regularizing the delta function in the\ntunneling Hamiltonian, one may also obtain a finite tunneling current by\ninvoking the ultraviolet cut-offs in a field-theoretic description of the\nelectrons in the one-dimensional conductor, a procedure that is often used in\nthe literature. For the latter case, we show that standard ultraviolet cut-offs\nlead to different results for the tunneling current in fermionic and bosonized\nformulations of the theory, when going beyond leading order in the tunneling\namplitude. We show how to recover the standard fermionic result using the\nformalism of functional bosonization and revisit the tunneling current to\nleading order in the interacting case.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of driven spin lattices in the presence\nof decoherence caused by either laser phase noise or strong decay. In the first\ncase, we discriminate between correlated and uncorrelated noise and explore\ntheir effect on the mean density of Rydberg states and the full counting\nstatistics (FCS). We find that while the mean density is almost identical in\nboth cases, the FCS differ considerably. The main method employed is the\nLangevin equation (LE) but for the sake of efficiency in certain regimes, we\nuse a Markovian master equation and Monte Carlo rate equations, respectively.\nIn the second case, we consider dissipative systems with more general power-law\ninteractions. We determine the phase diagram in the steady state and analyse\nits generation dynamics using Monte Carlo rate equations. In contrast to\nnearest-neighbour models, there is no transition to long-range-ordered phases\nfor realistic interactions and resonant driving. Yet, for finite laser\ndetunings, we show that Rydberg lattices can undergo a dissipative phase\ntransition to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. We identify\nthe advantages of Monte Carlo rate equations over mean field (MF) predictions.\n", "  We theoretically investigate excitons in MoS$_2$ monolayers in an applied\nin-plane electric field. Tight-binding and Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations\npredict a quadratic Stark shift, of the order of a few meV for fields of 10\nV/$\\mu$m, in the linear absorption spectra. The spectral weight of the main\nexciton peaks decreases by a few percent with an increasing electric field due\nto the exciton field ionization into free carriers as reflected in the exciton\nwave functions. Subpicosecond exciton decay lifetimes at fields of a few tens\nof V/$\\mu$m could be utilized in solar energy harvesting and photodetection. We\nfind simple scaling relations of the exciton binding, radius, and oscillator\nstrength with the dielectric environment and an electric field, which provides\na path to engineering the MoS$_2$ electro-optical response.\n", "  Restricting the covariant gravitational phase spaces to the manifold of\nparametrized families of solutions, the mass, angular momenta, entropies, and\nelectric charges can be calculated by a single and simple method. In this\nmethod, which has been called \"solution phase space method,\" conserved charges\nare unambiguous and regular. Moreover, assuming the generators of the charges\nto be exact symmetries, entropies and other conserved charges can be calculated\non almost arbitrary surfaces, not necessarily horizons or asymptotics. Hence,\nthe first law of thermodynamics would be a local identity relating the exact\nsymmetries to which the mass, angular momentum, electric charge, and entropy\nare attributed. In this paper, we apply this powerful method to the $f(R)$\ngravitational theories accompanied by the terms quadratic in the Riemann and\nRicci tensors. Furthermore, conserved charges and the first law of\nthermodynamics for some of their black hole solutions are exemplified. The\nexamples include warped AdS$_3$, charged static BTZ, and 3-dimensional $z=3$\nLifshitz black holes.\n", "  Describing the lightest pseudoscalar mesons as bound states of quark and\nantiquark within the framework of an instantaneous Bethe-Salpeter formalism\nconstructed such as to retain (in contrast to Salpeter's equation) as much\ninformation on the relativistic effects provided by the full quark propagator\nas conceivable allows for a surprisingly simple implementation of their near\nmasslessness mandatory for their interpretability as pseudo-Goldstone bosons\nrelated to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetries of quantum\nchromodynamics.\n", "  We probe the onset and effect of contact changes in 2D soft harmonic particle\npackings which are sheared quasistatically under controlled strain. First, we\nshow that in the majority of cases, the first contact changes correspond to the\ncreation or breaking of contacts on a single particle, with contact breaking\noverwhelmingly likely for low pressures and/or small systems, and contact\nmaking and breaking equally likely for large pressures and in the thermodynamic\nlimit. The statistics of the corresponding strains are near-Poissonian. The\nmean characteristic strains exhibit scaling with the number of particles N and\npressure P, and reveal the existence of finite size effects akin to those seen\nfor linear response quantities. Second, we show that linear response accurately\npredicts the strains of the first contact changes, which allows us to study the\nscaling of the characteristic strains of making and breaking contacts\nseparately. Both of these show finite size scaling, and we formulate scaling\narguments that are consistent with the observed behavior. Third, we probe the\neffect of the first contact change on the shear modulus G, and show in detail\nhow the variation of G remains smooth and bounded in the large system size\nlimit: even though contact changes occur then at vanishingly small strains,\ntheir cumulative effect, even at a fixed value of the strain, are limited, so\nthat effectively, linear response remains well-defined. Fourth, we explore\nmultiple contact changes under shear, and find strong and surprising\ncorrelations between alternating making and breaking events. Fifth, we show\nthat by making a link with extremal statistics, our data is consistent with a\nvery slow crossover to self averaging with system size, so that the\nthermodynamic limit is reached much more slowly than expected based on finite\nsize scaling of elastic quantities or contact breaking strains.\n", "  The appearance of spin-density-wave (SDW) magnetic order in the\nlow-temperature and high-field corner of the superconducting phase diagram of\nCeCoIn$_5$ is unique among unconventional superconductors. The nature of this\nmagnetic $Q$ phase is a matter of current debate. Here, we present the thermal\nconductivity of CeCoIn$_5$ in a rotating magnetic field, which reveals the\npresence of an additional order inside the $Q$ phase that is intimately\nintertwined with the superconducting $d$-wave and SDW orders. A discontinuous\nchange of the thermal conductivity within the $Q$ phase, when the magnetic\nfield is rotated about antinodes of the superconducting $d$-wave order\nparameter, demands that the additional order must change abruptly together with\nthe recently observed switching of the SDW. A combination of interactions,\nwhere spin-orbit coupling orients the SDW, which then selects the secondary\n$p$-wave pair-density-wave component (with an average amplitude of 20\\% of the\nprimary $d$-wave order parameter), accounts for the observed behavior.\n", "  Non-equilibrium transport properties of quantum systems have recently become\nexperimentally accessible in a number of platforms in so-called full-counting\nexperiments that measure transient and steady state non-equilibrium transport\ndynamics. We show that the effect of the measurement back-action can be\nexploited to gain access to relevant transport coefficients. This relationship\nis general, but becomes most conspicuous in the transient dynamics of open\nquantum systems understrong coupling to non-Markovian environments. In order to\nexplore this regime, a new simulation method for the generation of full\ncounting statistics of non-Markovian, strong-coupling transport settings has\nbeen developed that is expressed in terms of a hierarchy of equations of\nmotion. With this tool we gain access to the relevant regime and instantiate\nour proposal with the study of energetic conductance between two baths\nconnected via a few level system.\n", "  Resonance spectral lines such as H I Ly {\\alpha}, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K\nthat form in the solar chromosphere are influenced by the effects of 3D\nradiative transfer as well as partial redistribution (PRD). So far no one has\nmodeled these lines including both effects simultaneously owing to the high\ncomputing demands of existing algorithms. Such modeling is however\nindispensable for accurate diagnostics of the chromosphere. We present a\ncomputationally tractable method to treat PRD scattering in 3D model\natmospheres using a 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code. To make the method\nmemory-friendly, we use the hybrid approximation of Leenaarts et al. (2012) for\nthe redistribution integral. To make it fast, we use linear interpolation on\nequidistant frequency grids. We verify our algorithm against computations with\nthe RH code and analyze it for stability, convergence, and usefulness of\nacceleration using model atoms of Mg II with the h&k lines and H I with the Ly\n{\\alpha} line treated in PRD. A typical 3D PRD solution can be obtained in a\nmodel atmosphere with $252 \\times 252 \\times 496$ coordinate points in 50\n000--200 000 CPU hours, which is a factor ten slower than computations assuming\ncomplete redistribution. We illustrate the importance of the joint action of\nPRD and 3D effects for the Mg II h&k lines for disk-center intensities as well\nas the center-to-limb variation. The proposed method allows simulating PRD\nlines in time series of radiation-MHD models in order to interpret observations\nof chromospheric lines at high spatial resolution.\n", "  We have quantitatively studied the spin-orbit torque purely generated by the\nspin Hall effect in a wide range of temperatures by intensionally eliminating\nthe Rashba spin-orbit torque using Pt/Co/Pt trilayers with asymmetric\nthicknesses of the top and bottom Pt layers. The vanishingly small contribution\nfrom the Rashba effect has been confirmed through the vector measurements of\nthe current-induced effective fields. In order to precisely determine the value\nof the spin Hall torque, the complete cancelation of the spin Hall torque has\nbeen verified by fabricating symmetric Pt/Co/Pt structure on SiO2 and Gd3Ga5O12\n(GGG) substrates. Despite of the complete cance- lation on the GGG substrate,\nthe spin Hall torque cannot be completely canceled out even when the top and\nbottom Pt layers have same thicknesses on the SiO2 substrate, which suggests\nthat Pt/Co/Pt trilayers on a GGG substrate is a suitable system for precise\nmeasurements of the spin Hall torque. The result of the vector measurements on\nPt/Co/Pt/GGG from 300 to 10 K shows that the spin Hall torque is almost\nindependent of temperature, which is quantitatively reproduced under the\nassumption of the temperature-independent spin Hall angle of Pt.\n", "  We study the crossover in a zero temperature superconducting nanofilm from a\nsingle to a double superconducting slab induced by a tunable insulating\npotential barrier in the middle. The single phase superconducting ground state\nof this heterostructure is shown to be intrinsically multigapped and to have a\nnew type of resonance caused by the strength of the barrier, thus distinct from\nthe Thompson-Blatt shape resonance which is caused by tuning the thickness of\nthe film. Single particle electronic states are strongly or weakly affected\naccording to their parity (even or odd) with respect to the insulating barrier.\nThe lift of the parity degeneracy at finite barrier strength reconfigures the\npairing interaction and leads to a multigapped superconducting state with\ninteraction driven resonances.\n", "  Gravitational wave (GW) signals were recently detected directly by LIGO from\nthe coalescences of two black hole pairs. These detections have strengthened\nour belief that compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are the most promising GW\ndetection prospects accessible to ground-based interferometric detectors. For\ndetecting CBC signals it is of vital importance to characterize and identify\nnon-Gaussian and non-stationary noise in these detectors. In this work we model\ntwo important classes of transient artifacts that contribute to this noise and\nadversely affect the detector sensitivity to CBC signals. One of them is the\nsine-Gaussian glitch, characterized by a central frequency $f_0$ and a quality\nfactor $Q$ and the other is the chirping sine-Gaussian glitch, which is\ncharacterized by $f_0$, $Q$ as well as a chirp parameter. We study the response\na bank of compact binary inspiral templates has to these two families of\nglitches when they are used to match-filter data containing any of these\nglitches. Two important characteristics of this response are the distributions\nof the signal-to-noise ratio and the timelag of individual templates. We show\nhow these distributions differ from those when the detector data has a real CBC\nsignal instead of a glitch. We argue that these distinctions can be utilized to\ndevelop useful signal-artifact vetos that add negligibly to the computational\ncost of a CBC search. Specifically, we show how $f_0$ of a glitch can be used\nto set adaptive time-windows around it so that any template trigger occurring\nin that window can be quarantined for further vetting of its supposed\nastrophysical nature. Second, we recommend focusing efforts on reducing the\nincidence of glitches with low $f_0$ values because they create CBC triggers\nwith the longest timelags. This work allows us to associate such triggers with\nthe glitches which otherwise would have escaped attention.\n", "  Measurements of two- and multi-particle angular correlations in pp collisions\nat sqrt(s) = 5, 7, and 13 TeV are presented as a function of charged-particle\nmultiplicity. The data, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 inverse\npicobarn (5 TeV), 6.2 inverse picobarns (7 TeV), and 0.7 inverse picobarns (13\nTeV), were collected using the CMS detector at the LHC. The second-order (v[2])\nand third-order (v[3]) azimuthal anisotropy harmonics of unidentified charged\nparticles, as well as v[2] of K0 short and Lambda/anti-Lambda particles, are\nextracted from long-range two-particle correlations as functions of particle\nmultiplicity and transverse momentum. For high-multiplicity pp events, a mass\nordering is observed for the v[2] values of charged hadrons (mostly pions), K0\nshort, and Lambda/anti-Lambda, with lighter particle species exhibiting a\nstronger azimuthal anisotropy signal below pt of about 2 GeV/c. For 13 TeV\ndata, the v[2] signals are also extracted from four- and six-particle\ncorrelations for the first time in pp collisions, with comparable magnitude to\nthose from two-particle correlations. These observations are similar to those\nseen in pPb and PbPb collisions, and support the interpretation of a collective\norigin for the observed long-range correlations in high-multiplicity pp\ncollisions.\n", "  In replica exchange Monte Carlo (REM), tuning of the temperature set and the\nexchange scheduling are crucial in improving the accuracy and reducing\ncalculation time. In multi-dimensional simulated tempering, the first order\nphase transition is accessible. Therefore it is important to study the tuning\nof parameter set and the scheduling of exchanges in the parallel counterpart,\nthe multi-dimensional REM. We extend Hukushima's constant exchange probability\nmethod to multi-dimensional REM for the parameter set. We further propose a\ncombined method to use this set and the Bittner-Nussbaumer-Janke's PT tau\nalgorithm for scheduling. We test the proposed method in two-dimensional spin-1\nBlume-Capel model and find that it works efficiently, including the vicinity of\nthe first order phase transition.\n", "  Big Bang Nucleosynthesis imposes stringent bounds on light sterile neutrinos\nmixing with the active flavors. Here we discuss how altered dispersion\nrelations can weaken such bounds and allow compatibility of new sterile\nneutrino degrees of freedom with a successful generation of the light elements\nin the early Universe.\n", "  In this paper we consider the fragmentation of a parton into a jet with small\njet radius $R$. Perturbatively, logarithms of $R$ can appear, which for narrow\njets can lead to large corrections. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we\nintroduce the fragmentation function to a jet (FFJ), which describes the\nfragmentation of a parton into a jet. We discuss how these objects are related\nto the standard jet functions. Calculating the FFJ to next-to-leading order, we\nshow that these objects satisfy the standard\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations, with a natural\nscale that depends upon $R$. By using the standard renormalization group\nevolution, we can therefore resum logarithms of $R$. We further use the\nsoft-collinear effective theory to prove a factorization theorem where the FFJs\nnaturally appear, for the fragmentation of a hadron within a jet with small\n$R$. Finally, we also show how this formalism can be used to resum the ratio of\njet radii for a subjet to be emitted from within a fat jet.\n", "  We introduce an inhomogeneous protocol to drive a weakly disordered quantum\nspin chain quasi-adiabatically across a quantum phase transition and minimize\nthe residual energy of the final state. The number of spins that simultaneously\nreach the critical point is controlled by the length scale in which the\nmagnetic field is modulated, introducing an effective size that favors\nadiabatic dynamics. The dependence of the residual energy on this length scale\nand the velocity at which the magnetic field sweeps out the chain is shown to\nbe nonmonotonic. We determine the conditions for an optimal suppression of the\nresidual energy of the final state and show that inhomogeneous driving can\noutperform conventional adiabatic schemes based on homogeneous control fields\nby several orders of magnitude.\n", "  In this letter we introduce a new variable $\\xi$, namely the number of tracks\nassociated with the primary vertex, which are not parts of reconstructed\nobjects such as jets/isolated leptons etc. We demonstrate its usefulness in the\ncontext of new physics searches in the channel monojet$+$missing transverse\nmomentum (MET). In models such as in compressed supersymmetry, events are often\ncharacterized by a rather large number of soft partons from the cascade decays,\nnone of which result in reconstructed objects. We find that $\\xi$, binned in\n$p_T$, can discriminate these new physics events from events due to\n$Z+\\text{jets}$, that is, the main background in the channel monojet+ MET. The\ninformation contained in soft tracks is largely uncorrelated with traditional\nvariables such as the effective mass, MET, $p_T$ of the jet, etc. and,\ntherefore, can be combined with these to increase the discovery potential by\nmore than $200\\%$ (depending on the spectra, of course). In fact, we find that\nsimple cuts on $\\xi(p_T)$ along with cuts on MET, and the effective mass\noutperforms sophisticated optimized MultiVariate Analyses using all\nconventional variables. One can model the background distribution of $\\xi(p_T)$\nin an entirely data-driven way, and make these robust against pile-up by\nidentifying the primary vertex.\n", "  We analyze the continuous measurement of two non-commuting observables for a\nqubit, and investigate whether the simultaneously observed noisy signals are\nconsistent with the evolution of an equivalent classical system. Following the\napproach outlined by Leggett and Garg, we show that the readouts violate\nmacrorealistic inequalities for arbitrarily short temporal correlations.\nMoreover, the derived inequalities are manifestly violated even in the absence\nof Hamiltonian evolution, unlike for Leggett-Garg inequalities that use a\nsingle continuous measurement. Such a violation should indicate the failure of\nat least one postulate of macrorealism: either physical quantities do not have\nwell defined values at all times, or the measurement process itself disturbs\nwhat is being measured. For measurements of equal strength we are able to\nconstruct a classical stochastic model for a spin that perfectly emulates both\nthe qubit evolution and the observed noisy signals, thus emulating the\nviolations; interestingly, this model also requires an unphysical noise to\nemulate the readouts, which effectively restricts the ability of an observer to\nlearn information about the spin.\n", "  The stability of a single Belavin-Polyakov (BP) skyrmion in isotropic\nHeisenberg ferromagnet is studied. Such skyrmion is higher in energy than the\nuniform ferromagnetic state and is thus metastable. Starting from the lattice\nmodel in two spatial dimensions and using Maleyev-Dyson representation for spin\noperators, we examine the effects of magnon-magnon interaction for two\nquantities at $T=0$. First we discuss the self-energy corrections to magnon\nenergy. Second we analyze the two-particle Green's function and possible bound\nstates of two magnons. The simplicity of the model makes possible full analytic\ntreatment of all relevant processes. We found that the magnons remain\nwell-defined quasiparticles with a finite lifetime. The bound states of two\nmagnons are suppressed near the skyrmion, although they are not excluded far\naway from it. A resonance for the magnons of dilational mode in the vicinity of\nBP skyrmion is also found, which leads to a redistribution of the spectral\nweight. We conclude that the BP skyrmion as the classical topological object is\nnot destroyed by quantum fluctuations.\n", "  We study exact solutions of the steady state behaviour of several non-linear\nopen quantum systems which can be applied to the field of circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics. Using Fokker-Planck equations in the generalised\nP-representation we investigate the analytical solutions of two fundamental\nmodels. First, we solve for the steady-state response of a linear cavity that\nis coupled to an approximate transmon qubit and use this solution to study both\nthe weak and strong driving regimes, using analytical expressions for the\nmoments of both cavity and transmon fields, along with the Husimi Q-function\nfor the transmon. Second, we revisit exact solutions of quantum Duffing\noscillator which is driven both coherently and parametrically while also\nexperiencing decoherence by the loss of single and pairs of photons. We use\nthis solution to discuss both stabilisation of Schroedinger cat states and the\ngeneration of squeezed states in parametric amplifiers, in addition to studying\nthe Q-functions of the different phases of the quantum system. The field of\nsuperconducting circuits, with its strong nonlinearities and couplings, has\nprovided access to a new parameter regime in which returning to these exact\nquantum optics methods can provide valuable insights.\n", "  The equation of state of cold supra-nuclear-density matter, such as in\nneutron stars, is an open question in astrophysics. A promising method for\nconstraining the neutron star equation of state is modelling pulse profiles of\nthermonuclear X-ray burst oscillations from hotspots on accreting neutron\nstars. The pulse profiles, constructed using spherical and oblate neutron star\nmodels, are comparable to what would be observed by a next-generation X-ray\ntiming instrument like ASTROSAT, NICER, or LOFT. In this paper, we showcase the\nuse of an evolutionary optimization algorithm to fit pulse profiles to\ndetermine the best-fit masses and radii. By fitting synthetic data, we assess\nhow well the optimization algorithm can recover the input parameters. Multiple\nPoisson realizations of the synthetic pulse profiles, constructed with 1.6\nmillion counts and no background, were fitted with the Ferret algorithm to\nanalyze both statistical and degeneracy-related uncertainty, and to explore how\nthe goodness-of-fit depends on the input parameters. For the regions of\nparameter space sampled by our tests, the best-determined parameter is the\nprojected velocity of the spot along the observer's line-of-sight, with an\naccuracy of $\\le3$% compared to the true value and with $\\le5$\\% statistical\nuncertainty. The next best-determined are the mass and radius; for a neutron\nstar with a spin frequency of 600\\,Hz, the best-fit mass and radius are\naccurate to $\\le5$%, with respective uncertainties of $\\le7$% and $\\le10$%. The\naccuracy and precision depend on the observer inclination and spot co-latitude,\nwith values of $\\sim1$ % achievable in mass and radius if both the inclination\nand co-latitude are > 60 degrees.\n", "  We investigate the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the Polyakov\nloop and heavy quark entropy in a bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD)\nholographic model for the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) that\nquantitatively matches lattice data for the $(2+1)$-flavor QCD equation of\nstate at finite magnetic field and physical quark masses. We compare the\nholographic EMD model results for the Polyakov loop at zero and nonzero\nmagnetic fields and the heavy quark entropy at vanishing magnetic field with\nthe latest lattice data available for these observables and find good agreement\nfor temperatures $T\\gtrsim 150$ MeV and magnetic fields $eB\\lesssim 1$ GeV$^2$.\nPredictions for the behavior of the heavy quark entropy at nonzero magnetic\nfields are made that could be readily tested on the lattice.\n", "  There has been recent progress in understanding chaotic features in many-body\nquantum systems. Motivated by the scrambling of information in black holes, it\nhas been suggested that the time dependence of out-of-time-ordered (OTO)\ncorrelation functions such as $\\langle O_2(t) O_1(0) O_2(t) O_1(0) \\rangle $ is\na faithful measure of quantum chaos. Experimentally, these correlators are\nchallenging to access since they apparently require access to both forward and\nbackward time evolution with the system Hamiltonian. Here, we propose a\nprotocol to measure such OTO correlators using an ancilla which controls the\ndirection of time. Specifically, by coupling the state of ancilla to the system\nHamiltonian of interest, we can emulate the forward and backward time\npropagation, where the ancilla plays the role of a 'quantum clock'. Within this\nscheme, the continuous evolution of the entire system (the system of interest\nand the ancilla) is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian. Our protocol is\nimmune to errors that could occur when the direction of time evolution is\nexternally controlled by a classical switch.\n", "  We discuss relations between several relativistic spin observables and derive\na Lorentz-invariant characteristic of a reduced spin density matrix.A\nrelativistic position operator that satisfies all the properties of its\nnonrelativistic analog does not exist. Instead we propose two\ncausality-preserving positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) that are based\non projections onto one-particle and antiparticle spaces, and on the normalized\nenergy density. They predict identical expectation values for position. The\nvariances differ by less than a quarter of the squared de Broglie wavelength\nand coincide in the nonrelativistic limit. Since the resulting statistical\nmoment operators are not canonical conjugates of momentum, the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relations need not hold. Indeed, the energy density POVM leads to a\nlower uncertainty. We reformulate the standard equations of the spin dynamics\nby explicitly considering the charge-independent acceleration, allowing a\nconsistent treatment of backreaction and inclusion of a weak gravitational\nfield.\n", "  The emission of prompt fission $\\gamma$ rays within a few nanoseconds to a\nfew microseconds following the scission point is studied in the Hauser-Feshbach\nformalism applied to the deexcitation of primary excited fission fragments.\nNeutron and $\\gamma$-ray evaporations from fully accelerated fission fragments\nare calculated in competition at each stage of the decay, and the role of\nisomers in the fission products, before $\\beta$-decay, is analyzed. The time\nevolution of the average total $\\gamma$-ray energy, average total $\\gamma$-ray\nmultiplicity, and fragment-specific $\\gamma$-ray spectra, is presented in the\ncase of neutron-induced fission reactions of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu, as well\nas spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf. The production of specific isomeric\nstates is calculated and compared to available experimental data. About 7% of\nall prompt fission $\\gamma$ rays are predicted to be emitted between 10 nsec\nand 5 $\\mu$sec following fission, in the case of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu\n$(n_{\\rm th},f)$ reactions, and up to 3% in the case of $^{252}$Cf spontaneous\nfission. The cumulative average total $\\gamma$-ray energy increases by 2 to 5%\nin the same time interval. Finally, those results are shown to be robust\nagainst significant changes in the model input parameters.\n", "  The mechanical behaviors of polycrystalline solids are determined by the\ninterplay between phenomena governed by two different thermodynamic\ntemperatures: the configurational effective temperature that controls the\ndensity of dislocations, and the ordinary kinetic-vibrational temperature that\ncontrols activated depinning mechanisms and thus deformation rates. This paper\ncontains a review of the effective-temperature theory and its relation to\nconventional dislocation theories. It includes a simple illustration of how\nthese two thermal effects can combine to produce a predictive theory of spatial\nheterogeneities such as shear-banding instabilities. Its main message is a plea\nthat conventional dislocation theories be reformulated in a thermodynamically\nconsistent way so that the vast array of observed behaviors can be understood\nsystematically.\n", "  This paper is the first attempt to build CGC/saturation model based on the\nnext-to-leading order corrections to linear and non-linear evolution in QCD. We\nassume that the renormalization scale is the saturation momentum and found that\nthe scattering amplitude has geometric scaling behaviour deep in the saturation\ndomain with the explicit formula of this behaviour at large $\\tau = r^2 Q^2_s$.\nWe built a model that include this behaviour, as well as the ingredients that\nhas been known: (i) the behaviour of the scattering amplitude in the vicinity\nof the saturation momentum, using the NLO BFKL kernel, (ii) the pre-asymptotic\nbehaviour of $\\ln\\Lb Q^2_s\\Lb Y \\Rb\\Rb$, as function of $Y$ and (iii) the\nimpact parameter behaviour of the saturation momentum, which has exponential\nbehaviour $\\propto \\exp\\Lb -\\, m\\, b\\Rb$ at large $b$.We demonstrated that the\nmodel is able to describe the experimental data for the deep inelastic\nstructure function. Despite this, our model has difficulties that are related\nto the small value of the QCD coupling at $Q_s\\Lb Y_0\\Rb$ and the large values\nof the saturation momentum, which indicate the theoretical inconsistency of our\ndescription.\n", "  Recently, Sheppard et al. (2016) presented the discovery of seven new\ntrans-Neptunian objects with moderate eccentricities, perihelia beyond 40 AU,\nand semimajor axes beyond 50 AU. Like the few previously known objects on\nsimilar orbits, these objects' semimajor axes are just beyond the Kuiper belt\nedge and clustered around Neptunian mean motion resonances (MMRs). These\nobjects likely obtained their observed orbits while trapped within MMRs, when\nthe Kozai-Lidov mechanism raised their perihelia and weakened Neptune's\ndynamical influence. Using numerical simulations that model the production of\nthis population, we find that high-perihelion objects near Neptunian MMRs can\nconstrain the nature and timescale of Neptune's past orbital migration. In\nparticular, the population near the 3:1 MMR (near 62 AU) is especially useful\ndue to its large population and short dynamical evolution timescale. If Neptune\nfinishes migrating within ~100 Myrs or less, we predict over 90% of\nhigh-perihelion objects near the 3:1 MMR will have semimajor axes within 1 AU\nof each other, very near the modern resonance's center. On the other hand, if\nNeptune's migration takes ~300 Myrs, we expect ~50% of this population to\nreside in dynamically fossilized orbits over ~1 AU closer to the Sun than the\nmodern resonance. We highlight 2015 KH162 as a likely member of this fossilized\n3:1 population. Under any plausible migration scenario, nearly all\nhigh-perihelion objects in resonances beyond the 4:1 MMR (near 76 AU) reach\ntheir orbits well after Neptune stops migrating and comprise a recently\ngenerated, dynamically active population.\n", "  The explicit expressions for the high-temperature expansions of the one-loop\ncorrections to the omega-potential coming from charged scalar and Dirac\nparticles and, separately, from antiparticles in a constant homogeneous\nmagnetic field are derived. The explicit expressions for the non-perturbative\ncorrections to the effective action at finite temperature and density are\nobtained. Thermodynamic properties of a gas of charged scalars in a constant\nhomogeneous magnetic field are analyzed in the one-loop approximation. It turns\nout that, in this approximation, the system suffers a first-order phase\ntransition from the diamagnetic to the superconducting state at sufficiently\nhigh densities. The improvement of the one-loop result by summing the ring\ndiagrams is investigated. This improvement leads to a drastic change in\nthermodynamic properties of the system. The gas of charged scalars passes to\nthe ferromagnetic state in place of the superconducting one at high densities\nand sufficiently low temperatures, in the high temperature regime.\n", "  We analyze the possibility that the HESS gamma-ray source at the Galactic\nCenter could be explained as the secondary flux produced by annihilation of TeV\nDark Matter (TeVDM) particles with locally enhanced density, in a region\nspatially compatible with the HESS observations themselves. We study the inner\n100 pc considering (i) the extrapolation of several density profiles from\nstate-of-the-art N-body + Hydrodynamics simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies,\n(ii) the DM spike induced by the black hole, and (iii) the DM particles\nscattering off by bulge stars. We show that in some cases the DM spike may\nprovide the enhancement in the flux required to explain the cut-off in the HESS\nJ1745-290 gamma-ray spectra as TeVDM. In other cases, it may helps to describe\nthe spatial tail reported by HESS II at angular scales < 0.54 degrees towards\nSgr A.\n", "  The longitudinal ($\\Gamma_1$) and transverse ($\\Gamma_2$) decay rates of a\ntwo-level quantum system have profound influence on its evolution. Atomic\nsystems with $\\Gamma_2=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\Gamma_1$ have been studied extensively, but\nwith the rise of solid-state quantum devices it is also important to consider\nthe effect of stronger transverse relaxation due to interactions with the solid\nenvironment. Here we study the quantum dynamics of a single organic dye\nmolecule driven by a laser. We measure the variation of $\\Gamma_2$ with\ntemperature and determine the activation energy for thermal dephasing of the\noptical dipole. Then we measure the second-order correlation function\n$g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ of the light emitted by the molecule for various ratios\n$\\Gamma_2/\\Gamma_1$ and saturation parameters $S$. We show that the general\nsolution to the optical Bloch equations accurately describes the observed\nquantum dynamics over a wide range of these parameters, and we discuss the\nlimitations of the various approximate expressions for $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ that\nappear in the literature.\n", "  We analyse the output of the hi-res cosmological zoom-in simulation ErisBH to\nstudy self-consistently the formation of a strong stellar bar in a Milky\nWay-type galaxy and its effect on the galactic structure, on the central gas\ndistribution and on star formation. The simulation includes radiative cooling,\nstar formation, SN feedback and a central massive black hole which is\nundergoing gas accretion and is heating the surroundings via thermal AGN\nfeedback. A large central region in the ErisBH disk becomes bar-unstable after\nz~1.4, but a clear bar-like structure starts to grow significantly only after\nz~0.4, possibly triggered by the interaction with a massive satellite. At z~0.1\nthe bar reaches its maximum radial extent of l~2.2 kpc. As the bar grows, it\nbecomes prone to buckling instability, which we quantify based on the\nanisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion. The actual buckling event is\nobservable at z~0.1, resulting in the formation of a boxy-peanut bulge clearly\ndiscernible in the edge-on view of the galaxy at z=0. The bar in ErisBH does\nnot dissolve during the formation of the bulge but remains strongly\nnon-axisymmetric down to the resolution limit of ~100 pc at z=0. During its\nearly growth, the bar exerts a strong torque on the gas within its extent and\ndrives gas inflows that enhance the nuclear star formation on sub-kpc scales.\nLater on the infalling gas is nearly all consumed into stars and, to a lesser\nextent, accreted onto the central black hole, leaving behind a gas-depleted\nregion within the central ~2 kpc. Observations would more likely identify a\nprominent, large-scale bar at the stage when the galactic central region has\nalready been quenched. Bar-driven quenching may play an important role in\ndisk-dominated galaxies at all redshift. [Abridged]\n", "  We present coarse but robust star formation histories (SFHs) derived from\nspectro-photometric data of the Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Survey, for 22,494\ngalaxies at 0.3<z<0.9 with stellar masses of 10^9 Msun to 10^12 Msun. Our study\nmoves beyond \"average\" SFHs and distribution functions of specific star\nformation rates (sSFRs) to individually measured SFHs for tens of thousands of\ngalaxies. By comparing star formation rates (SFRs) with timescales of 10^10,\n10^9, and 10^8 years, we find a wide diversity of SFHs: 'old galaxies' that\nformed most or all of their stars early; galaxies that formed stars with\ndeclining or constant SFRs over a Hubble time, and genuinely 'young galaxies'\nthat formed most of their stars since z=1. This sequence is one of decreasing\nstellar mass, but, remarkably, each type is found over a mass range of a factor\nof 10. Conversely, galaxies at any given mass follow a wide range of SFHs,\nleading us to conclude that: (1) halo mass does not uniquely determine SFHs;\n(2) there is no 'typical' evolutionary track; and (3) \"abundance matching\" has\nlimitations as a tool for inferring physics. Our observations imply that SFHs\nare set at an early epoch, and that--for most galaxies--the decline and\ncessation of star formation occurs over a Hubble-time, without distinct\n\"quenching\" events. SFH diversity is inconsistent with models where galaxy\nmass, at any given epoch, grows simply along relations between SFR and stellar\nmass, but is consistent with a 2-parameter lognormal form, lending credence to\nthis model from a new and independent perspective.\n", "  Using symmetry arguments and a tight-binding model, we show that for layered\ncollinear anti- ferromagnets, magneto-optic effects can be generated and\nmanipulated by controlling crystal symmetries through a gate voltage. This\nprovides a promising route for electric field manipulation of the magneto-optic\neffects without modifying the underlying magnetic structure. We further\ndemonstrate the gate control of magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) in bilayer\nMnPSe3 using first-principles calculations. The field-induced inversion\nsymmetry breaking effect leads to gate-controllable MOKE whose direction of\nrotation can be switched by the reversal of the gate voltage.\n", "  A calorimetric measurement has recently been proposed as a promising\ntechnique to measure thermodynamic quantities in a dissipative superconducting\nqubit. These measurements rely on the fact that the system is projected into\nenergy eigenstates whenever energy is exchanged with the environment. This\nrequirement imposes a restriction on the class of systems that can be measured\nin this way. Here we extend the calorimetric protocol to the measurement of a\ndriven quantum harmonic oscillator. We employ a scheme based on the two-level\napproximation to define a new work quantity and show how its statistics relates\nto the standard two-measurement protocol. We find that for the average work the\ntwo-level approximation holds in the underdamped regime for short driving times\nand, in the overdamped regime, for any driving time. However, this\napproximation fails for the variance and higher moments of work at finite\ntemperatures. Furthermore, we show how to relate the work statistics obtained\nthrough this scheme to the work statistics given by the two-measurement\nprotocol.\n", "  We report on the first observation of magnetic catalysis at zero temperature\nin a fully nonperturbative simulation of the graphene effective field theory.\nUsing lattice gauge theory, a nonperturbative analysis of the theory of\nstrongly-interacting, massless, (2+1)-dimensional Dirac fermions in the\npresence of an external magnetic field is performed. We show that in the\nzero-temperature limit, a nonzero value for the chiral condensate is obtained\nwhich signals the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. This result implies\na nonzero value for the dynamical mass of the Dirac quasiparticle. This in turn\nhas been posited to account for the quantum-Hall plateaus that are observed at\nlarge magnetic fields.\n", "  We investigate flavor phenomenology and dark matter in the context of\nscotogenic model. In this model, the neutrino masses are generated through\nradiative corrections at one-loop level. Considering the neutrino mixing matrix\nto be of tri-bimaximal form with additional perturbations to accommodate the\nrecently observed non-zero value of reactor mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$, we\nobtain the relation between various neutrino oscillation parameters and the\nmodel parameters. Working in degenerate heavy neutrino mass spectrum, we obtain\nlight neutrino masses obeying normal hierarchy and also study the relic\nabundance of fermionic dark matter candidate including co-annihilation effects.\nA viable parameter space is thus obtained, consistent with neutrino oscillation\ndata, relic abundance and various lepton flavor violating decays such as\n$\\ell_\\alpha\\to\\ell_\\beta\\gamma$ and $\\ell_\\alpha \\to 3 \\, \\ell_\\beta$.\n", "  We argue that strain applied to a time-reversal and inversion breaking Weyl\nsemi-metal in a magnetic field can induce an electric current via the chiral\nmagnetic effect. A tight binding model is used to show that strain generically\nchanges the locations in the Brillouin zone but also the energies of the band\ntouching points (tips of the Weyl cones). Since axial charge in a Weyl\nsemi-metal can relax via inter-valley scattering processes the induced current\nwill decay with a timescale given by the lifetime of a chiral quasiparticle. We\nestimate the strength and lifetime of the current for typical material\nparameters and find that it should be experimentally observable.\n", "  We analyse configurations of compact stars in the so-called R-squared gravity\nin the Palatini formalism. Using a realistic equation of state we show that the\nmass-radius configurations are lighter than their counterparts in General\nRelativity. We also obtain the internal profiles, which run in strong\ncorrelation with the derivatives of the equation of state, leading to regions\nwhere the mass parameter decreases with the radial coordinate in a\ncounter-intuitive way. In order to analyse such correlation, we introduce a\nparametrisation of the equation of state given by multiple polytropes, which\nallows us to explicitly control its derivatives. We show that, even in a\nlimiting case where hard phase transitions in matter are allowed, the internal\nprofile of the mass parameter still presents strange features and the\ncalculated M-R configurations also yield NSs lighter than those obtained in\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  We present results from two Herschel observing programs using the\nPhotodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer. During three separate campaigns,\nwe obtained Herschel data for 24 stars at 70, 100, and 160 microns. We chose\nstars that were already known or suspected to have circumstellar dust based on\nexcess infrared emission previously measured with IRAS or Spitzer, and used\nHerschel to examine long-wavelength properties of the dust. Fifteen stars were\nfound to be uncontaminated by background sources, and possess infrared emission\nmost likely due to a circumstellar debris disk. We analyzed the properties of\nthese debris disks to better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for\ndust production and removal. Seven targets were spatially resolved in the\nHerschel images. Based on fits to their spectral energy distributions, nine\ndisks appear to have two temperature components. Of these nine, in three cases,\nthe warmer dust component is likely the result of a transient process rather\nthan a steady state collisional cascade. The dust belts at four stars are\nlikely stirred by an unseen planet, and merit further investigation.\n", "  We consider the canonical ensemble of $N$-vertex Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER)\nrandom topological graphs with quenched vertex degree, and with fugacity $\\mu$\nfor each closed triple of bonds. We claim complete defragmentation of large-$N$\ngraphs into the collection of $[p^{-1}]$ almost full subgraphs (cliques) above\ncritical fugacity, $\\mu_c$, where $p$ is the ER bond formation probability.\nEvolution of the spectral density, $\\rho(\\lambda)$, of the adjacency matrix\nwith increasing $\\mu$ leads to the formation of two-zonal support for\n$\\mu>\\mu_c$. Eigenvalue tunneling from one (central) zone to the other means\nformation of a new clique in the defragmentation process. The adjacency matrix\nof the ground state of a network has the block-diagonal form where number of\nvertices in blocks fluctuate around the mean value $Np$. The spectral density\nof the whole network in this regime has triangular shape. We interpret the\nphenomena from the viewpoint of the conventional random matrix model and\nspeculate about possible physical applications.\n", "  Magnetization measurements were performed on two sigma-phase samples of\nFe(100-x)V(x) (x=35.5, 34.1) vs. temperature, T, and in DC magnetic field, of\nvarious amplitudes. Using three characteristic temperatures, magnetic phase\ndiagrams in the H-T plane have been designed testifying to a re-entrant\ncharacter of magnetism. The ground magnetic state, a spin glass (SG), was\nevidenced to be composed of two sub phases: one with a weak irreversibility and\nthe other with a strong irreversibility. Two critical lines were reconstructed\nwithin the SG state. Both of them show a crossover from the Gabay-Toulouse\nbehavior (low field) to a linear and/or quasi-Almeida-Touless behavior. A\nstrong difference in the effect of the applied magnetic field on the SG phase\nin the two samples was revealed.\n", "  Experiments on the $Gd^{3+}$ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) in the filled\nskutterudite $Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$ ($x \\approx 0.001$), at temperatures\nwhere the host resistivity manifests a smooth insulator-metal crossover,\nprovides evidence of the underlying Kondo physics associated with this system.\nAt low temperatures (below $T \\approx K$), $Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$ behaves\nas a Kondo-insulator with a relatively large hybridization gap, and the\n$Gd^{3+}$ ESR spectra displays a fine structure with lorentzian line shape,\ntypical of insulating media. The electronic gap is attributed to the large\nhybridization present in the coherent regime of a Kondo lattice, when Ce\n4f-electrons cooperate with band properties at half-filling. Mean-field\ncalculations suggest that the electron-phonon interaction is fundamental at\nexplaining the strong 4f-electron hybridization in this filled skutterudite.\nThe resulting electronic structure is strongly temperature dependent, and at\nabout $T^{*} \\approx 160 K$ the system undergoes an insulator-to-metal\ntransition induced by the withdrawal of 4f-electrons from the Fermi volume, the\nsystem becoming metallic and non-magnetic. The $Gd^{3+}$ ESR fine structure\ncoalesces into a single dysonian resonance, as in metals. Still, our\nsimulations suggest that exchange-narrowing via the usual Korringa mechanism,\nalone, is not capable of describing the thermal behavior of the ESR spectra in\nthe entire temperature region ($4.2$ - $300$ K). We propose that temperature\nactivated fluctuating-valence of the Ce ions is the missing ingredient that,\nadded to the usual exchange-narrowing mechanism, fully describes this unique\ntemperature dependence of the $Gd^{3+}$ ESR fine structure observed in\n$Ce_{1-x}Gd_{x}Fe_{4}P_{12}$.\n", "  We evaluate the effects of a distant planet, commonly known as planet 9, on\nthe dynamics of the giant planets of the Solar System. We find that, given the\nlarge distance of planet 9, the dynamics of the inner giant planets can be\ndecomposed into a classic Lagrange-Laplace dynamics relative to their own\ninvariant plane (the plane orthogonal to their total angular momentum vector)\nand a slow precession of said plane relative to the total angular momentum\nvector of the Solar System, including planet 9. Under some specific\nconfigurations for planet 9, this precession can explain the current tilt of\napproximately 6 degrees between the invariant plane of the giant planets and\nthe solar equator. An analytical model is developed to map the evolution of the\ninclination of the inner giant planets' invariant plane as a function of the\nplanet 9's mass, inclination, eccentricity and semimajor axis, and some\nnumerical simulations of the equations of motion of the giant planets and\nplanet 9 are performed to validate our analytical approach. The longitude of\nthe ascending node of planet 9 is found to be linked to the longitude of the\nascending node of the giant planets' invariant plane, which also constrain the\nlongitude of the node of planet 9 on the ecliptic. Some of the planet 9\nconfigurations that allow explaining the current solar tilt are compatible with\nthose proposed to explain the orbital confinement of the most distant Kuiper\nbelt objects. Thus, this work on the one hand gives an elegant explanation for\nthe current tilt between the invariant plane of the inner giant planets and the\nsolar equator and, on the other hand, adds new constraints to the orbital\nelements of planet 9.\n", "  We consider the existence and stability of solitons in generalized galileons,\nscalar field theories with higher-derivative interactions but second-order\nequations of motion. It has previously been proven that no stable, static\nsolitons exist in a single galileon theory using an argument invoking the\nexistence of zero modes for the perturbations. Here we analyze the\napplicability of this argument to generalized galileons and discuss how this\nmay be avoided by having potential terms in the energy functional for the\nperturbations, or by including time dependence. Given the presence of potential\nterms in the Lagrangian for the perturbations, we find that stable, static\nsolitons are not ruled out in conformal and (A)dS galileons. For the case of\nDBI and conformal galileons, we find that solitonic solutions moving at the\nspeed of light exist, the former being stable and the latter unstable if the\nbackground soliton satisfies a certain condition.\n", "  Two-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect are relevant tools\nfor quantum metrology and quantum information processing. In optical coherence\ntomography, HOM effect is exploited to achieve high-resolution measurements\nwith the width of the HOM dip being the main parameter. On the other hand,\napplications like dense coding require high-visibility performances. Here we\naddress high-order dispersion effects in two-photon interference and study,\ntheoretically and experimentally, the dependence of the visibility and the\nwidth of the HOM dip on both the pump spectrum and the downconverted photon\nspectrum. In particular, a spatial light modulator is exploited to\nexperimentally introduce and manipulate a custom phase function to simulate the\nhigh-order dispersion effects.\n", "  We present a pedagogical introduction to the In-Medium Similarity\nRenormalization Group (IM-SRG) framework for ab initio calculations of nuclei.\nThe IM-SRG performs continuous unitary transformations of the nuclear many-body\nHamiltonian in second-quantized form, which can be implemented with polynomial\ncomputational effort. Through suitably chosen generators, it is possible to\nextract eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian in a given nucleus, or drive the\nHamiltonian matrix in configuration space to specific structures, e.g., band-\nor block-diagonal form.\n  Exploiting this flexibility, we describe two complementary approaches for the\ndescription of closed- and open-shell nuclei: The first is the Multireference\nIM-SRG (MR-IM-SRG), which is designed for the efficient calculation of nuclear\nground-state properties. The second is the derivation of nonempirical\nvalence-space interactions that can be used as input for nuclear Shell model\n(i.e., configuration interaction (CI)) calculations. This IM-SRG+Shell model\napproach provides immediate access to excitation spectra, transitions, etc.,\nbut is limited in applicability by the factorial cost of the CI calculations.\n  We review applications of the MR-IM-SRG and IM-SRG+Shell model approaches to\nthe calculation of ground-state properties for the oxygen, calcium, and nickel\nisotopic chains or the spectroscopy of nuclei in the lower $sd$ shell,\nrespectively, and present selected new results, e.g., for the ground- and\nexcited state properties of neon isotopes.\n", "  We study phase-transitions of the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts chain with\nrandom nearest-neighbour couplings having a variance $\\Delta^2$ and with\nhomogeneous long-range interactions, which decay with the distance as a power\n$r^{-(1+\\sigma)}$, $\\sigma>0$. In the large-$q$ limit the free-energy of random\nsamples of length $L \\le 2048$ is calculated exactly by a combinatorial\noptimization algorithm. The phase-transition stays first-order for $\\sigma <\n\\sigma_c(\\Delta) \\le 0.5$, while the correlation length becomes divergent at\nthe transition point for $\\sigma_c(\\Delta) < \\sigma < 1$. In the latter regime\nthe average magnetization is continuous for small enough $\\Delta$, but for\nlarger $\\Delta$ it is discontinuous at the transition point, thus the\nphase-transition is of mixed order.\n", "  Background: The $\\gamma$ vibrational mode of excitation is an acknowledged\ncollective mode in deformed nuclei. The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying\nsystematically the microscopic structure of the $\\gamma$ vibration in the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of\nthe observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals. We find the similar isotopic\ndependence of the excitation energy in the neutron-rich Er and Yb isotopes as\nwell. Conclusions: The microscopic framework of the Skyrme-EDF based QRPA\ndescribes well the isotopic dependence of the energy of the $\\gamma$ vibration\nin the well-deformed neutron-rich rare-earth nuclei. The strong collectivity at\n$N=108-110$ is expected as the Fermi level of neutrons lies just among the\norbitals that play an important role in generating the collectivity around\n$N=106$.\n", "  Instead of analog electronic circuits and components, digital controllers\nthat are capable of active multi-resonant piezoelectric shunting are applied to\nelastic metamaterials integrated with piezoelectric patches. Giving thanks to\nthe introduced digital control technique, shunting strategies with transfer\nfunctions that can hardly be realized with analog circuits is possible now. As\nan example, the \"pole-zero\" method is developed to design single- or\nmulti-resonant bandgaps by adjusting poles and zeros in the transfer function\nof piezoelectric shunting directly. Large simultaneous attenuations in up to\nthree frequency bands at deep subwavelength scale (with the normalized\nfrequency as low as 0.077) are achieved. The underlying physical mechanism is\nattributed to the negative group velocity of flexural wave within bandgaps. As\ndigital controllers can be readily adapted via wireless broadcasting, the\nbandgaps can be tuned easily instead of tuning the electric components in\nanalog shunting circuits one by one manually. The theoretical results are well\nverified experimentally with the measured vibration transmission properties\nwhere large insulations of up to 20dB in low-frequency ranges are observed.\n", "  The heuristic identification of peaks from noisy complex spectra often leads\nto misunderstanding of the physical and chemical properties of matter. In this\npaper, we propose a framework based on Bayesian inference, which enables us to\nseparate multipeak spectra into single peaks statistically and consists of two\nsteps. The first step is estimating both the noise variance and the number of\npeaks as hyperparameters based on Bayes free energy, which generally is not\nanalytically tractable. The second step is fitting the parameters of each peak\nfunction to the given spectrum by calculating the posterior density, which has\na problem of local minima and saddles since multipeak models are nonlinear and\nhierarchical. Our framework enables the escape from local minima or saddles by\nusing the exchange Monte Carlo method and calculates Bayes free energy via the\nmultiple histogram method. We discuss a simulation demonstrating how efficient\nour framework is and show that estimating both the noise variance and the\nnumber of peaks prevents overfitting, overpenalizing, and misunderstanding the\nprecision of parameter estimation.\n", "  An extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) has recently been observed in several\nnon-magnetic semimetals. Increasing experimental and theoretical evidence\nindicates that the XMR can be driven by either topological protection or\nelectron-hole compensation. Here, by investigating the electronic structure of\na XMR material, YSb, we present spectroscopic evidence for a special case which\nlacks topological protection and perfect electron-hole compensation. Further\ninvestigations reveal that a cooperative action of a substantial difference\nbetween electron and hole mobility and a moderate carrier compensation might\ncontribute to the XMR in YSb.\n", "  For a generic conformal field theory (CFT) in four dimensions, the scale\nanomaly dictates that the universal part of entanglement entropy across a\nsphere ($\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{univ}}(S^{2})$) is positive. Based on this fact, we\nexplore the consequences of assuming positive sign for\n$\\mathcal{C}_{\\text{univ}}(S^{2})$ in a four dimensional scale invariant theory\n(SFT). In absence of a dimension two scalar operator $\\mathcal{O}_{2}$ in the\nspectrum of a SFT, we show that this assumption suggests that SFT is a CFT. In\npresence of $\\mathcal{O}_{2}$, we show that this assumption can fix the\ncoefficient of the nonlinear coupling term $\\int\\hspace{-.5mm} d^{4}x\\sqrt{g}\nR\\mathcal{O}_{2}$ to a conformal value.\n", "  In this paper we study the consequences of relaxing the hypothesis of the\npressureless nature of the dark matter component when determining constraints\non dark energy. To this aim we consider simple generalized dark matter models\nwith constant equation of state parameter. We find that present-day\nlow-redshift probes (type-Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations)\nlead to a complete degeneracy between the dark energy and the dark matter\nsectors. However, adding the cosmic microwave background (CMB) high-redshift\nprobe restores constraints similar to those on the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nWe then examine the anticipated constraints from the galaxy clustering probe of\nthe future Euclid survey on the same class of models, using a Fisher forecast\nestimation. We show that the Euclid survey allows us to break the degeneracy\nbetween the dark sectors, although the constraints on dark energy are much\nweaker than with standard dark matter. The use of CMB in combination allows us\nto restore the high precision on the dark energy sector constraints.\n", "  The high-temperature superconducting state in cuprates appears if charge\ncarriers are doped into a Mott insulating parent compound. An unresolved puzzle\nis the unconventional nature of the normal state above the superconducting\ndome, and its connection to the superconducting instability. At weak\nhole-doping, a \"pseudo-gap\" metal state with signatures of time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking is observed, which near optimal doping changes into a\n\"strange metal\" with non-Fermi liquid properties. Qualitatively similar phase\ndiagrams are found in multi-orbital systems, such as pnictides, where the\nunconventional metal states arise from a Hund coupling induced spin-freezing.\nHere, we show that the relevant model for cuprates, the single-orbital Hubbard\nmodel on the square lattice, can be mapped onto an effective multi-orbital\nproblem with strong ferromagnetic Hund coupling. The spin-freezing physics of\nthis multi-orbital system explains the phenomenology of cuprates, including the\npseudo-gap, the strange metal, and the d-wave superconducting instability. Our\nanalysis suggests that spin-freezing is the universal mechanism which controls\nthe properties of unconventional superconductors.\n", "  The Ward identities for conformal symmetries in single field models of\ninflation are studied in more detail in momentum space. For a class of\ngeneralized single field models, where the inflaton action contains arbitrary\npowers of the scalar and its first derivative, we find that the Ward identities\nare valid. We also study a one-parameter family of vacua, called\n$\\alpha$-vacua, which preserve conformal invariance in de Sitter space. We find\nthat the Ward identities, upto contact terms, are met for the three point\nfunction of a scalar field in the probe approximation in these vacua.\nInterestingly, the corresponding non-Gaussian term in the wave function does\nnot satisfy the operator product expansion. For scalar perturbations in\ninflation, in the $\\alpha$-vacua, we find that the Ward identities are not\nsatisfied. We argue that this is because the back-reaction on the metric of the\nfull quantum stress tensor has not been self-consistently incorporated. We also\npresent a calculation, drawing on techniques from the AdS/CFT correspondence,\nfor the three point function of scalar perturbations in inflation in the\nBunch-Davies vacuum.\n", "  Working with a gauge coupling field in a linear superfield, we construct\neffective Lagrangians for N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory fully compatible with the\nexpected all-order behaviour or physical quantities. Using the one-loop\ndependence on its ultraviolet cutoff and anomaly matching or cancellation of R\nand dilatation anomalies, we obtain the Wilsonian effective Lagrangian. With\nsimilar anomaly matching or cancellation methods, we derive the effective\naction for gaugino condensates, as a function of the real coupling field. Both\neffective actions lead to a derivation of the NSVZ beta function from algebraic\narguments only. The extension of results to N=2 theories or to matter systems\nis briefly considered. The main tool for the discussion of anomalies is a\ngeneric supercurrent structure with 16_B+16_F operators (the S multiplet),\nwhich we derive using superspace identities and field equations for a fully\ngeneral gauge theory Lagrangian with the linear gauge coupling superfield, and\nwith various U(1)_R currents. As a byproduct, we show under which conditions\nthe S multiplet can be improved to contain the Callan-Coleman-Jackiw\nenergy-momentum tensor whose trace measures the breaking of scale invariance.\n", "  Bulk superfluid helium supports two sound modes: first sound is an ordinary\npressure wave, while second sound is a temperature wave, unique to inviscid\nsuperfluid systems. These sound modes do not usually exist independently, but\nrather variations in pressure are accompanied by variations in temperature, and\nvice versa. We studied the coupling between first and second sound in dilute\n$^3$He - superfluid $^4$He mixtures, between 1.6 K and 2.2 K, at $^3$He\nconcentrations ranging from 0 to 11 %, under saturated vapor pressure, using a\nquartz tuning fork oscillator. Second sound coupled to first sound can create\nanomalies in the resonance response of the fork, which disappear only at very\nspecific temperatures and concentrations, where two terms governing the\ncoupling cancel each other, and second sound and first sound become decoupled.\n", "  We use published data on the power and production efficiency of jets in\nblazars with double radio lobes in order to compare results obtained using\ndifferent methods. In order to eliminate selection effects, we use\ncross-matched sub-samples containing only luminous blazars. We compare the\nthree main existing methods, namely those based on the emission of radio lobes,\non spectral fitting, and on radio core shift. We find the average jet power\nobtained for identical samples with the radio-lobe method is $\\sim10$ times\nlower than that from the spectral fitting. In turn, the power from spectral\nfitting is compatible with that from core-shift modelling for plausible\nparameters of the latter. We also consider a phenomenological estimator based\non the {\\gamma}-ray luminosity. We examine uncertainties of those methods and\ndiscuss two alternative hypotheses. In one, the blazar-fit and core-shift\nmethods are assumed to be correct, and the lower power from radio lobes is\ncaused by intermittency of accretion. Long periods of quiescence cause the\nenergy in the radio lobes, accumulated over the lifetime of the blazar, to be\nmuch less than that estimated based on the present luminous state. In addition,\nthe power calculated using the radio lobes can be underestimated for\nintrinsically compact jets, in which the radio core flux can be\nover-subtracted. In our second hypothesis, the radio-lobe method is assumed to\nbe correct, and the blazar-fit and core-shift powers are reduced due to the\npresence of $\\sim15$ pairs per proton, and a larger magnetization than usually\nassumed, respectively.\n", "  We study the dispersion relation for parallel propagating ion-cyclotron (IC)\nwaves in a dusty plasma, considering situations where the velocity dispersion\nalong perpendicular direction is greater than along the parallel direction, and\nconsidering the use of product-bi-kappa (PBK) velocity distributions for the\nplasma particles. The results obtained by numerical solution of the dispersion\nrelation, in a case with isotropic Maxwellian distributions for electrons and\nPBK distribution for ions, show the occurrence of the electromagnetic\nion-cyclotron instability (EMIC), and show that the decrease in the kappa\nindexes of the PBK ion distribution leads to significant increase in the\nmagnitude of the growth rates and in the range of wavenumber for which the\ninstability occurs. On the other hand, for anisotropic Maxwellian distribution\nfor ions and PBK distribution for electrons, the decrease of the kappa index in\nthe PBK electron distribution contributes to reduce the growth rate of the EMIC\ninstability, but the reduction effect is less pronounced than the increase\nobtained with ion PBK distribution with the same $\\kappa$ index. The results\nobtained also show that, as a general rule, the presence of a dust population\ncontributes to reduce the instability in magnitude of the growth rates and\nrange, but that in the case of PBK ion distribution with small kappa indexes\nthe instability may continue to occur for dust populations which would\neliminate completely the instability in the case of bi-Maxwellian ion\ndistributions. It has also been seen that the anisotropy due to the kappa\nindexes in the ion PBK distribution is not so efficient in producing the EMIC\ninstability as the ratio of perpendicular and parallel ion temperatures, for\nequivalent value of the effective temperature.\n", "  We investigate analytically and numerically eigenfunction statistics in a\ndisordered system on a finite Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). We show that the\nwave function amplitude at the root of a tree is distributed fractally in a\nlarge part of the delocalized phase. The fractal exponents are expressed in\nterms of the decay rate and the velocity in a problem of propagation of a front\nbetween unstable and stable phases. We demonstrate a crucial difference between\na loopless Cayley tree and a locally tree-like structure without a boundary\n(random regular graph) where extended wavefunctions are ergodic.\n", "  A modal expansion approach is developed and employed to investigate and\nelucidate the nonlinear mechanism behind the multistability and formation of\ncoupled multi-mode polariton solitons in microcavity wires. With pump switched\non and realistic dissipation parameters, truncating the expansion up to the\nsecond-order wire mode, our model predicts two distinct coupled soliton\nbranches: stable and ustable. Modulational stability of the homogeneous\nsolution and soliton branches stability are studied. Our simplified 1D model is\nin remarkably good agreement with the full 2D mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii\nmodel, reproducing correctly the soliton existence domain upon variation of\npump amplitude and the onset of multistability.\n", "  The $U$-spin symmetry provides a powerful tool to extract the angle $\\gamma$\nof the Unitarity Triangle and the $B_s^0$-$\\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing phase $\\phi_s$\nfrom CP violation in the $B^0_s\\to K^-K^+$, $B^0_d\\to\\pi^-\\pi^+$ system. LHCb\nhas obtained first results with uncertainties at the $7^\\circ$ level. Due to\n$U$-spin-breaking corrections, it will be challenging to reduce the uncertainty\nbelow ${\\cal O}(5^\\circ)$ at Belle II and the LHCb upgrade. We propose a new\nstrategy, using $\\gamma$ as input and utilizing $B^0_s\\to K^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$,\n$B^0_d\\to \\pi^-\\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$ decays, which allows an extraction of $\\phi_s$\nwith a future theoretical precision of up to ${\\cal O}(0.5^\\circ)$, thereby\nmatching the experimental prospects. Since $B^0_s\\to K^-K^+$ is dominated by\npenguin topologies, new sources of CP violation may be revealed.\n", "  We present a new event generator based on the three-fluid hydrodynamics\napproach for the early stage of the collision, followed by a particlization at\nthe hydrodynamic decoupling surface to join to a microscopic transport model,\nUrQMD, to account for hadronic final state interactions. We present first\nresults for nuclear collisions of the FAIR/NICA energy scan program (Au+Au\ncollisions, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4-11$ GeV). We address the directed flow of protons\nand pions as well as the proton rapidity distribution for two model EoS, one\nwith a first order phase transition the other with a crossover type softening\nat high densities. The new simulation program has the unique feature that it\ncan describe a hadron-to-quark matter transition which proceeds in the baryon\nstopping regime that is not accessible to previous simulation programs designed\nfor higher energies.\n", "  We report on an ongoing project to investigate activity in the M dwarf\nstellar population observed by the Pan-STARRS 1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS).\nUsing a custom-built pipeline, we refine an initial sample of $\\approx$ 4\nmillion sources in PS1-MDS to a sample of 184,148 candidate cool stars using\ncolor cuts. Motivated by the well-known relationship between rotation and\nstellar activity, we use a multi-band periodogram analysis and visual vetting\nto identify 271 sources that are likely rotating M dwarfs. We derive a new set\nof polynomials relating M dwarf PS1 colors to fundamental stellar parameters\nand use them to estimate the masses, distances, effective temperatures, and\nbolometric luminosities of our sample. We present a catalog containing these\nvalues, our measured rotation periods, and cross-matches to other surveys. Our\nfinal sample spans periods of $\\lesssim$1-130 days in stars with estimated\neffective temperatures of $\\approx$ 2700-4000 K. Twenty-two of our sources have\nX-ray cross-matches, and they are found to be relatively X-ray bright as would\nbe expected from selection effects. Our data set provides evidence that\nKepler-based searches have not been sensitive to very slowly-rotating stars\n($P_{\\rm rot} \\gtrsim 70$ d), implying that the observed emergence of very slow\nrotators in studies of low-mass stars may be a systematic effect. We also see a\nlack of low-amplitude ($<$2%) variability in objects with intermediate (10-40\nd) rotation periods, which, considered in conjunction with other observational\nresults, may be a signpost of a loss of magnetic complexity associated with a\nphase of rapid spin-down in intermediate-age M dwarfs. This work represents\njust a first step in exploring stellar variability in data from the PS1-MDS\nand, in the farther future, LSST.\n", "  Orion Source I (`SrcI') is the protostar at the center of the Kleinmann-Low\nNebula. ALMA observations of SrcI with 0.2\" angular resolution were made at 350\nand 660 GHz to search for the H26alpha and H21alpha hydrogen recombination\nlines and to measure the continuum flux densities. The recombination lines were\nnot detected, ruling out the possibility that SrcI is a hypercompact HII\nregion. The deconvolved size of the continuum source is approximately 0.23 x\n0.07\" (100 x 30 AU); it is interpreted as a disk viewed almost edge-on.\nOptically thick thermal emission from ~500 K dust is the most plausible source\nof the continuum, even at frequencies as low as 43 GHz; the disk mass is most\nlikely in the range 0.02 to 0.2 Mo. A rich spectrum of molecular lines is\ndetected, mostly from sulfur- and silicon-rich molecules like SO, SO2, and SiS,\nbut also including vibrationally excited CO and several unidentified\ntransitions. Lines with upper energy levels E_U > 500 K appear in emission and\nare symmetric about the source's LSR velocity of 5 km/sec, while lines with E_U\n< 500 K appear as blueshifted absorption features against the continuum,\nindicating that they originate in outflowing gas. The emission lines exhibit a\nvelocity gradient along the major axis of the disk that is consistent with\nrotation around a 5-7 Mo central object. The relatively low mass of SrcI and\nthe existence of a 100 AU disk around it are difficult to reconcile with the\nmodel in which SrcI and the nearby Becklin-Neugebauer Object were ejected from\na multiple system 500 years ago.\n", "  We present deeply virtual $\\pi^0$ electroproduction cross-section\nmeasurements at $x_B$=0.36 and three different $Q^2$--values ranging from 1.5\nto 2 GeV$^2$, obtained from experiment E07-007 that ran in the Hall A at\nJefferson Lab. The Rosenbluth technique was used to separate the longitudinal\nand transverse responses. Results demonstrate that the cross section is\ndominated by its transverse component, and thus is far from the asymptotic\nlimit predicted by perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. An indication of a\nnon-zero longitudinal contribution is provided by the interference term\n$\\sigma_{LT}$ also measured. Results are compared with several models based on\nthe leading twist approach of Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs). In\nparticular, a fair agreement is obtained with models where the scattering\namplitude is described by a convolution of chiral-odd (transversity) GPDs of\nthe nucleon with the twist-3 pion distribution amplitude. Therefore, neutral\npion electroproduction may offer the exciting possibility of accessing\ntransversity GPDs through experiment.\n", "  The LHCb Collaboration has recently observed four $J/\\psi\\phi$ structures\ncalled $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ in the $B^{+}\\to\nJ/\\psi\\phi K^{+}$ decays. We study them herein using a nonrelativistic\nconstituent quark model in which the degrees of freedom are quark-antiquark and\nmeson-meson components. The $X(4140)$ resonance appears as a cusp in the\n$J/\\psi\\phi$ channel due to the near coincidence of the\n$D_{s}^{\\pm}D_{s}^{\\ast\\pm}$ and $J/\\psi\\phi$ mass thresholds. The remaining\nthree $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ appear as conventional charmonium\nstates with quantum numbers $3^{3}P_{1}$, $4^{3}P_{0}$ and $5^{3}P_{0}$,\nrespectively; and whose masses and widths are slightly modified due to their\ncoupling with the corresponding closest meson-meson thresholds. A particular\nfeature of our quark model is a lattice-based screened linear confining\ninteraction that has been constrained in the light quark sector and usually\nproduces higher excited heavy-quark states with lower masses than standard\nquark model predictions.\n", "  The emerging field of quantum acoustics explores interactions between\nacoustic waves and artificial atoms and their applications in quantum\ninformation processing. In this experimental study, we demonstrate the coupling\nbetween a surface acoustic wave (SAW) and an electron spin in diamond by taking\nadvantage of the strong strain coupling of the excited states of a nitrogen\nvacancy center, while avoiding the short lifetime of these states. The SAW-spin\ncoupling takes place through a lamda-type three-level system where two ground\nspin states couple to a common excited state through a phonon-assisted as well\nas a direct dipole optical transition. Both coherent population trapping and\noptically-driven spin transitions have been realized. The coherent population\ntrapping demonstrates the coupling between a SAW and an electron spin coherence\nthrough a dark state. The optically-driven spin transitions, which resemble the\nsideband transitions in a trapped ion system, can enable the quantum control of\nboth spin and mechanical degrees of freedom and potentially a trapped-ion-like\nsolid state system for applications in quantum computing. These results\nestablish an experimental platform for spin-based quantum acoustic, bridging\nthe gap between spintronics and quantum acoustics.\n", "  Magnetars may have strong surface dipole field. Observationally, two\nmagnetars may have passive fallback disks. In the presence of a fallback disk,\nthe rotational evolution of magnetars may be changed. In the self-similar\nfallback disk model, it is found that: (1) When the disk mass is significantly\nsmaller than $10^{-6} \\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$, the magnetar is unaffected by the\nfallback disk and it will be a normal magnetar. (2) When the disk mass is\nlarge, but the magnetar's surface dipole field is about or below $10^{14} \\,\\rm\nG$, the magnetar will also be a normal magnetar. A magnetar plus a passive\nfallback disk system is expected. This may correspond to the observations of\nmagnetars 4U 0142$+$61, and 1E 2259$+$586. (3) When the disk mass is large, and\nthe magnetar's surface dipole field is as high as $4\\times 10^{15} \\,\\rm G$,\nthe magnetar will evolve from the ejector phase to the propeller phase, and\nthen enter rotational equilibrium. The magnetar will be slowed down quickly in\nthe propeller phase. The final rotational period can be as high $2\\times 10^4\n\\,\\rm s$. This may correspond to the super-slow magnetar in the supernova\nremnant RCW 103. Therefore, the three kinds of magnetars can be understood in a\nunified way.\n", "  Using a method to correct redshift space distortion (RSD) for individual\ngalaxies, we mapped the real space distributions of galaxies in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We use an ensemble of mock\ncatalogs to demonstrate the reliability of our method. Here as the first paper\nin a series, we mainly focus on the two point correlation function (2PCF) of\ngalaxies. Overall the 2PCF measured in the reconstructed real space for\ngalaxies brighter than $^{0.1}{\\rm M}_r-5\\log h=-19.0$ agrees with the direct\nmeasurement to an accuracy better than the measurement error due to cosmic\nvariance, if the reconstruction uses the correct cosmology. Applying the method\nto the SDSS DR7, we construct a real space version of the main galaxy catalog,\nwhich contains 396,068 galaxies in the North Galactic Cap with redshifts in the\nrange $0.01 \\leq z \\leq 0.12$. The Sloan Great Wall, the largest known\nstructure in the nearby Universe, is not as dominant an over-dense structure as\nappears to be in redshift space. We measure the 2PCFs in reconstructed real\nspace for galaxies of different luminosities and colors. All of them show clear\ndeviations from single power-law forms, and reveal clear transitions from\n1-halo to 2-halo terms. A comparison with the corresponding 2PCFs in redshift\nspace nicely demonstrates how RSDs boost the clustering power on large scales\n(by about $40-50\\%$ at scales $\\sim 10 h^{-1}{\\rm {Mpc}}$) and suppress it on\nsmall scales (by about $70-80\\%$ at a scale of $0.3 h^{-1}{\\rm {Mpc}}$).\n", "  We present the first results from our KODIAQ Z survey aimed to determine the\nmetallicity distribution and physical properties of the z>2 partial and full\nLyman limit systems (pLLSs and LLSs; 16.2<log N(HI)<19), which are probed of\nthe interface regions between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies. We\nstudy 31 HI-selected pLLSs and LLSs at 2.3<z<3.3 observed with Keck/HIRES in\nabsorption against background QSOs. We compare the column densities of\nmetal-ions to HI and use photoionization models to assess the metallicity. The\nmetallicity distribution of the pLLSs/LLSs at 2.3<z<3.3 is consistent with a\nunimodal distribution peaking at [X/H]=-2. The metallicity distribution of\nthese absorbers therefore evolves markedly with z since at z<1 it is bimodal\nwith peaks at [X/H]=-1.8 and -0.3. There is a substantial fraction (25-41%) of\npLLSs/LLSs with metallicities well below those of damped Lya absorbers (DLAs)\nat any studied z from z<1 to z~2-4, implying reservoirs of metal-poor cool,\ndense gas in the IGM/galaxy interface at all z. However, the gas probed by\npLLSs and LLSs is rarely pristine, with a fraction 3-18% for pLLSs/LLSs with\n[X/H]<-3. We find C/alpha enhancement in several pLLSs and LLSs in the\nmetallicity range -2<[X/H]<-0.5, where C/alpha is 2-5 times larger than\nobserved in Galactic metal-poor stars or high redshift DLAs at similar\nmetallicities. This is likely caused by preferential ejection of carbon from\nmetal-poor galaxies into their surroundings.\n", "  The rapid progress seen in the development of quantum coherent devices for\ninformation processing has motivated serious consideration of quantum computer\narchitecture and organization. One topic which remains open for investigation\nand optimization relates to the design of the classical-quantum interface,\nwhere control operations on individual qubits are applied according to\nhigher-level algorithms; accommodating competing demands on performance and\nscalability remains a major outstanding challenge. In this work we present a\nresource-efficient, scalable framework for the implementation of embedded\nphysical-layer classical controllers for quantum information systems. Design\ndrivers and key functionalities are introduced, leading to the selection of\nWalsh functions as an effective functional basis for both programming and\ncontroller hardware implementation. This approach leverages the simplicity of\nreal-time Walsh-function generation in classical digital hardware, and the fact\nthat a wide variety of physical-layer controls such as dynamic error\nsuppression are known to fall within the Walsh family. We experimentally\nimplement a real-time FPGA-based Walsh controller producing Walsh timing\nsignals and Walsh-synthesized analog waveforms appropriate for critical tasks\nin error-resistant quantum control and noise characterization. These\ndemonstrations represent the first step towards a unified framework for the\nrealization of physical-layer controls compatible with large-scale quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  We show how quantum metrology protocols that seek to estimate the parameters\nof a Hamiltonian that exhibits a quantum phase transition can be efficiently\nsimulated on an exponentially smaller quantum computer. Specifically, by\nexploiting the fact that the ground state of such a Hamiltonian changes\ndrastically around its phase transition point, we construct a suitable\nobservable from which one can estimate the relevant parameters of the\nHamiltonian with Heisenberg scaling precision. We then show how, for the\none-dimensional Ising Hamiltonian with transverse magnetic field acting on N\nspins, such a metrology protocol can be efficiently simulated on an\nexponentially smaller quantum computer while maintaining the same Heisenberg\nscaling, i.e., O(1/N^2) precision and derive the explicit circuit that\naccomplishes the simulation.\n", "  We study quantum discord between two free modes of a massive scalar field in\na maximally entangled state in de Sitter space. We introduce two observers, one\nin a global chart and the other in an open chart of de Sitter space, and the\nobservers determine the quantum discord created by each detecting one of the\nmodes. This situation is analogous to the relationship between an observer in a\nMinkowski chart and another in one of the two Rindler charts in flat space. We\nfind that the state becomes less entangled as the curvature of the open chart\ngets larger. In particular, for the cases of a massless, and a conformally\ncoupled scalar field, the entanglement vanishes in the limit of infinite\ncurvature. However, we find that the quantum discord never disappears even in\nthe limit that entanglement disappears.\n", "  We report full polarimetric VLBA observations of water masers towards the\nTurner-Welch Object in the W3(OH) high-mass star forming complex. This object\ndrives a synchrotron jet, which is quite exceptional for a high-mass protostar,\nand is associated with a strongly polarized water maser source, W3(H$_2$O),\nmaking it an optimal target to investigate the role of magnetic fields on the\ninnermost scales of protostellar disk-jet systems. The linearly polarized\nemission from water masers provides clues on the orientation of the local\nmagnetic field, while the measurement of the Zeeman splitting from circular\npolarization provides its strength. The water masers trace a bipolar, biconical\noutflow at the center of the synchrotron jet. Although on scales of a few\nthousand AU the magnetic field inferred from the masers is on average\norientated along the flow axis, on smaller scales (10s to 100s of AU), we have\nrevealed a misalignment between the magnetic field and the velocity vectors,\nwhich arises from the compression of the field component along the shock front.\nOur measurements support a scenario where the magnetic field would evolve from\nhaving a dominant component parallel to the outflow velocity in the pre-shock\ngas, with field strengths of the order of a few tens of mG (at densities of\n$10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), to being mainly dominated by the perpendicular component of\norder of a few hundred of mG in the post-shock gas where the water masers are\nexcited (at densities of $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$). The general implication is that in\nthe undisturbed (i.e. not-shocked) circumstellar gas, the flow velocities would\nfollow closely the magnetic field lines, while in the gas shocked by the\nprostostellar jet the magnetic field would be re-configured to be parallel to\nthe shock front.\n", "  We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of two interacting atoms in a\none-dimensional harmonic trap after a quench by a tightly pinned impurity atom.\nWe make use of an approximate variational calculation called the Lagrange-mesh\nmethod to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation as a function of inter-particle\ninteraction and impurity quench strength. We investigate the out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics by calculating the Loschmidt echo which quantifies the irreversibility\nof the system following the quench, while its probability distribution after\nlong times can be used to identify distinct dynamical regimes. These quantities\nare related to the spectral function which describes the full dynamical\nspectrum, and we show through a thorough examination of the parameter space the\nexistence of distinct scattering states and collective oscillations. This work\ndemonstrates how these dynamics are strongly dependent on the interaction\nstrength between the atoms and may be tuned to reach the orthogonality\ncatastrophe in few-body systems.\n", "  The $^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,p)^{26}$Mg and $^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,n)^{26}$Al reactions\nare important for our understanding of the $^{26}$Al abundance in massive\nstars. The aim of this work is to report on a direct and simultaneous\nmeasurement of these astrophysically important reactions using an active target\nsystem. The reactions were investigated in inverse kinematics using $^{4}$He as\nthe active target gas in the detector. We measured the excitation functions in\nthe energy range of about 2 to 6 MeV in the center of mass. We have found that\nthe cross sections of the $^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,p)^{26}$Mg and the\n$^{23}$Na$(\\alpha,n)^{26}$Al reactions are in good agreement with previous\nexperiments, and with statistical model calculations.\n", "  One of the scenarios for the formation of grand-design spiral arms in disky\ngalaxies involves their interactions with a satellite or another galaxy. Here\nwe consider another possibility, where the perturbation is instead due to the\npotential of a galaxy cluster. Using $N$-body simulations we investigate the\nformation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky Way-like galaxy orbiting a\nVirgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but\nsimilar eccentricity and its evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally\ninduced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of\nthem during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with\ntime, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this\ntransient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of\nthe pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are\nformed on the tightest orbit, however they wind up rather quickly and are\ndisturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit,\nwhich we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest\ntime. Measurements of the pattern speed of the arms indicate that they are\nkinematic density waves. We attempt a comparison with observations by selecting\ngrand-design spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Among those, we find nine\nexamples bearing no signs of recent interactions or the presence of companions.\nFor three of them we present close structural analogues among our simulated\nspiral galaxies.\n", "  We employ an $^{88}$Y/Be photoneutron source to derive the quenching factor\nfor neutron-induced nuclear recoils in germanium, probing recoil energies from\na few hundred eV$_{nr}$ to 8.5keV$_{nr}$. A comprehensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation of our setup is compared to experimental data employing a Lindhard\nmodel with a free electronic energy loss $k$ and an adiabatic correction for\nsub-keV$_{nr}$ nuclear recoils. The best fit $k=0.179\\pm 0.001$ obtained using\na Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) ensemble sampler is in good agreement with\nprevious measurements, confirming the adequacy of the Lindhard model to\ndescribe the stopping of few-keV ions in germanium crystals at a temperature of\n$\\sim$77 K. This value of $k$ corresponds to a quenching factor of 13.7 % to\n25.3 % for nuclear recoil energies between 0.3 keV$_{nr}$ and 8.5 keV$_{nr}$,\nrespectively.\n", "  Increasing evidence suggests that, similar to face-to-face communications,\nhuman emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms\nunderlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings\nspread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social\nnetwork, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and\nspatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using\nconventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are\ncollection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals,\nonline social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the\nperspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the\nanalysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is\nmore contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up\ntweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels\neasily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different\ncommunities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content\nmore often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion\nand weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The\ndiffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides\nfurther testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals\na difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. Our\nfindings shed light on both personal anger management in human communications\nand on controlling collective outrage in cyberspace.\n", "  We study the Braess paradox in the transport network as originally proposed\nby Braess with totally asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs) on the edges.\nThe Braess paradox describes the counterintuitive situation in which adding an\nedge to a road network leads to a user optimum with higher travel times for all\nnetwork users. Travel times on the TASEPs are nonlinear in the density, and\njammed states can occur due to the microscopic exclusion principle, leading to\na more realistic description of trafficlike transport on the network than in\npreviously studied linear macroscopic mathematical models. Furthermore, the\nstochastic dynamics allows us to explore the effects of fluctuations on network\nperformance. We observe that for low densities, the added edge leads to lower\ntravel times. For slightly higher densities, the Braess paradox occurs in its\nclassical sense. At intermediate densities, strong fluctuations in the travel\ntimes dominate the system's behavior due to links that are in a domain-wall\nstate. At high densities, the added link leads to lower travel times. We\npresent a phase diagram that predicts the system's state depending on the\nglobal density and crucial path-length ratios.\n", "  We study the possibility of generating tiny Dirac neutrino masses at one loop\nlevel through the \\textit{scotogenic} mechanism such that one of the particles\ngoing inside the loop can be a stable cold dark matter (DM) candidate. Majorana\nmass terms of singlet fermions as well as tree level Dirac neutrino masses are\nprevented by incorporating the presence of additional discrete symmetries in a\nminimal fashion, which also guarantee the stability of the dark matter\ncandidate. Due to the absence of total lepton number violation, the observed\nbaryon asymmetry of the Universe is generated through the mechanism of Dirac\nleptogenesis where an equal and opposite amount of leptonic asymmetry is\ngenerated in the left and right handed sectors which are prevented from\nequilibration due to tiny Dirac Yukawa couplings. Dark matter relic abundance\nis generated through its usual freeze-out at a temperature much below the scale\nof leptogenesis. We constrain the relevant parameter space from neutrino mass,\nbaryon asymmetry, Planck bound on dark matter relic abundance, and latest LUX\nbound on spin independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. We also discuss\nthe charged lepton flavour violation $(\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma)$ and electric\ndipole moment of electron in this model in the light of the latest experimental\ndata and constrain the parameter space of the model.\n", "  One of the most intriguing puzzle is why there is a coexistence of Fermi arcs\nand Fermi pockets in the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors? This\npuzzle is calling for an explanation. Based on the t-J model in the\nfermion-spin representation, the coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi\npockets in cuprate superconductors is studied by taking into account the\npseudogap effect. It is shown that the pseudogap induces an energy band\nsplitting, and then the poles of the electron Green's function at zero energy\nform two contours in momentum space, however, the electron spectral weight on\nthese two contours around the antinodal region is gapped out by the pseudogap,\nleaving behind the low-energy electron spectral weight only located at the\ndisconnected segments around the nodal region. In particular, the tips of these\ndisconnected segments converge on the hot spots to form the closed Fermi\npockets, generating a coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets.\nMoreover, the single-particle coherent weight is directly related to the\npseudogap, and grows linearly with doping. The calculated result of the overall\ndispersion of the electron excitations is in qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data. The theory also predicts that the pseudogap-induced\npeak-dip-hump structure in the electron spectrum is absent from the hot-spot\ndirections.\n", "  How does inhomogeneity affect our interpretation of cosmological\nobservations? It has long been wondered to what extent the observable\nproperties of an inhomogeneous universe differ from those of a corresponding\nFriedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model, and how the inhomogeneities\naffect that correspondence. Here, we use numerical relativity to study the\nbehavior of light beams traversing an inhomogeneous universe and construct the\nresulting Hubble diagrams. The universe that emerges exhibits an average FLRW\nbehavior, but inhomogeneous structures contribute to deviations in observables\nacross the observer's sky. We also investigate the relationship between angular\ndiameter distance and the angular extent of a source, finding deviations that\ngrow with source redshift. These departures from FLRW are important\npath-dependent effects with implications for using real observables in an\ninhomogeneous universe such as our own.\n", "  The hadronic decay widths and some ratios of branching fractions of the newly\nobserved charmed strange baryons, $\\Xi_c(3055)^0$, $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and\n$\\Xi_c(3080)^+$ are calculated in a $^3P_0$ model. In the calculation, they are\nconsidered as $34$ kinds of $D-wave$ charmed strange baryons. Among these\nassignments, $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ is very possibly a $J^P={5\\over 2}^+$\n$\\hat\\Xi_{c3}^\\prime(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$ or $\\check\\Xi_{c3}^2(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$,\nwhere $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ has the total decay width $\\Gamma=10.1$ MeV and\n$\\Gamma=7.6$ MeV. The predicted ratios $\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^+ \\to \\Lambda D^+ )/\n\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^+ \\to \\Sigma_c^{++}K^-)=3.39$. $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ is also very\npossibly a $J^P={7\\over 2}^+$ $\\hat\\Xi_{c3}^\\prime(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$ or\n$\\check\\Xi_{c3}^2(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$. In these two assignments, $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$\nhas the total decay width $\\Gamma=9.7$ MeV and $\\Gamma=6.3$ MeV. The predicted\nratios $\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^+ \\to \\Lambda D^+ )/ \\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^+ \\to\n\\Sigma_c^{++}K^-)=5.91~\\rm{or}~6.04$. As a isospin partner of $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$,\n$\\Xi_c(3055)^0$ is also very possibly a $J^P={5\\over 2}^+$\n$\\hat\\Xi_{c3}^\\prime(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$ or $\\check\\Xi_{c3}^2(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$,\nwhere $\\Xi_c(3055)^0$ has the total decay width $\\Gamma=10.9$ MeV and\n$\\Gamma=7.0$ MeV. The predicted ratios $\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^0 \\to \\Lambda D^0 )/\n\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^0 \\to \\Sigma_c^{+}K^-)=4.24~\\rm{or}~4.20$. $\\Xi_c(3055)^0$\nis also very possibly a $J^P={7\\over 2}^+$ $\\hat\\Xi_{c3}^\\prime(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$\nor $\\check\\Xi_{c3}^2(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$. In these assignments, $\\Xi_c(3055)^0$ has\nthe total decay width $\\Gamma=10.3$ MeV and $\\Gamma=7.1$ MeV. The predicted\nratios $\\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^0 \\to \\Lambda D^0 )/ \\Gamma(\\Xi_c(3055)^0 \\to\n\\Sigma_c^{+}K^-)=7.47~\\rm{or}~7.56$. The results agree well with recent\nexperimental data from Belle. $\\Xi_c(3080)^+$ seems impossible to be identified\nwith a D-wave charmed strange baryon.\n", "  By following the Kazantsev theory and taking into account both microscopic\nand turbulent diffusion of magnetic fields, we develop a unified treatment of\nthe kinematic and nonlinear stages of turbulent dynamo, and study the dynamo\nprocess for a full range of magnetic Prandtl number Pm and ionization\nfractions. We find a striking similarity between the dependence of dynamo\nbehavior on Pm in a conducting fluid and R (a function of ionization fraction)\nin partially ionized gas. In a weakly ionized medium, the kinematic stage is\nlargely extended, including not only exponential growth but a new regime of\ndynamo characterized by linear-in-time growth of magnetic field strength, and\nthe resulting magnetic energy is much higher than the kinetic energy carried by\nviscous-scale eddies. Unlike the kinematic stage, the subsequent nonlinear\nstage is unaffected by microscopic diffusion processes and has a universal\nlinear-in-time growth of magnetic energy with the growth rate as a constant\nfraction $3/38$ of the turbulent energy transfer rate, showing good agreement\nwith earlier numerical results. Applying the analysis to the first stars and\ngalaxies, we find that the kinematic stage is able to generate a field strength\nonly an order of magnitude smaller than the final saturation value. But the\ngeneration of large-scale magnetic fields can only be accounted for by the\nrelatively inefficient nonlinear stage and requires longer time than the\nfree-fall time. It suggests that magnetic fields may not have played a\ndynamically important role during the formation of the first stars.\n", "  We investigate the form of equilibrium spatio-temporal correlation functions\nof conserved quantities, and of energy transport in the Toda lattice and in\nother integrable models. From numerical simulations we find that the\ncorrelations satisfy ballistic scaling with a remarkable collapse of data from\ndifferent times. We examine special limiting choices of parameter values, for\nwhich the Toda lattice tends to either the harmonic chain or the equal mass\nhard-particle gas. In both these limiting cases, one can obtain the\ncorrelations exactly and we find excellent agreement with the direct Toda\nsimulation results. We also discuss a transformation to \"normal mode\"\nvariables, as commonly done in hydrodynamic theory of non-integrable systems,\nand find that this is useful, to some extent, even for the integrable system.\n", "  Star formation on galactic scales is known to be a slow process, but whether\nit is slow on smaller scales is uncertain. We cross-correlate 5469 giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) from a new all-sky catalog with 256 star forming\ncomplexes (SFCs) to build a sample of 191 SFC-GMC complexes---collections of\nmultiple clouds each matched to 191 SFCs. The total mass in stars harbored by\nthese clouds is inferred from WMAP free-free fluxes. We measure the GMC mass,\nthe virial parameter, the star formation efficiency $\\epsilon$ and the star\nformation rate per free-fall time $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$. Both $\\epsilon$ and\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ range over 3--4 orders of magnitude. We find that 68.3% of\nthe clouds fall within $\\sigma_{\\log\\epsilon}=0.79\\pm0.22\\,{\\rm dex}$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\log\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}}=0.91\\pm0.22\\,{\\rm dex}$ about the median.\nCompared to these observed scatters, a simple model with a time independent\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ that depends on the host GMC properties predicts\n$\\sigma_{\\log\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}}=$0.12-0.24. Allowing for a time-variable\n$\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$, we can recover the large dispersion in the rate of star\nformation. This strongly suggests that star formation in the Milky Way is a\ndynamic process on GMC scales. We also show that the surface star formation\nrate profile of the Milky Way correlates well with the molecular gas surface\ndensity profile.\n", "  We suggest a method for calculating scattering phase shifts and energies and\nwidths of resonances which utilizes only eigenenergies obtained in variational\ncalculations with oscillator basis and their dependence on oscillator basis\nspacing $\\hbar\\Omega$. We make use of simple expressions for the $S$-matrix at\neigenstates of a finite (truncated) Hamiltonian matrix in the oscillator basis\nobtained in the HORSE ($J$-matrix) formalism of quantum scattering theory. The\nvalidity of the suggested approach is verified in calculations with model\nWoods--Saxon potentials and applied to calculations of $n\\alpha$ resonances and\nnon-resonant scattering using the no-core shell model.\n", "  Star-formation feedback onto the parent cloud is conventionally examined\nthrough the study of molecular outflows. Little is however known on the effect\nthat atomic ejecta, tracing fast shocks, can have on the global cloud\nproperties. In this study we employ Herschel/PACS [OI] and [CII] spectral line\nmaps of the NGC 1333 star-forming region to assess the relative influence of\natomic jets onto the star-formation process. Atomic line maps are compared\nagainst molecular outflow tracers and atomic ejecta are associated to\nindividual driving sources. We study the detailed morphology and velocity\ndistribution of [OI] line using channel and line-centroid maps and derive the\nmomentum, energy, and mass flux for all the bipolar jets traced by [OI] line\nemission. We find that the line-centroid maps can trace velocity structures\ndown to 5 km s$^{-1}$ which is a factor of $\\sim$20 beyond the nominal velocity\nresolution reached by Herschel/PACS. These maps reveal an unprecedented degree\nof details that assist significantly in the association and characterization of\njets and outflows. Comparisons of the dynamical and kinematical properties\nshows that [OI] momentum accounts for only $\\sim$1% of the momentum carried by\nthe large scale CO outflows but the energy released through the jets\ncorresponds to 50 - 100% of the energy released in outflows. The estimated\nratios of the jet to the outflow momenta and energies are consistent with the\nresults of two-component, nested jet/outflow simulations, where jets are\nassociated to episodic accretion events. Under this scenario, the energy from\natomic jets to the cloud is as important as the energy output from outflows in\nmaintaining turbulence and dissipating the cloud gas.\n", "  We report the analysis of magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$($T$) of\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$ single crystal in the paramagnetic phase. We formulate the\ntheoretical susceptibility based on isotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnetism\nincorporating the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction exactly, and include the\ninterlayer couplings in a mean-field approximation. $\\chi$($T$) above $T_{\\rm\nN}$ was found to be well described by the model, indicating the predominant\nHeisenberg exchange consistent with the microscopic theory. The analysis points\nto a competition of nearest and next-nearest neighbor interlayer couplings,\nwhich results in the up-up-down-down configuration of the in-plane canting\nmoments identified by the diffraction experiments.\n", "  We analyze in detail the background cosmological evolution of a scalar field\ncoupled to a massless abelian gauge field through an axial term\n$\\frac{\\phi}{f_\\gamma} F \\tilde{F}$, such as in the case of an axion. Gauge\nfields in this case are known to experience tachyonic growth and therefore can\nbackreact on the background as an effective dissipation into radiation energy\ndensity $\\rho_R$, which which can lead to inflation without the need of a flat\npotential. We analyze the system, for momenta $k$ smaller than the cutoff\n$f_\\gamma$, including numerically the backreaction. We consider the evolution\nfrom a given static initial condition and explicitly show that, if $f_\\gamma$\nis smaller than the field excursion $\\phi_0$ by about a factor of at least\n${\\cal O} (20)$, there is a friction effect which turns on before that the\nfield can fall down and which can then lead to a very long stage of inflation\nwith a generic potential. In addition we find superimposed oscillations, which\nwould get imprinted on any kind of perturbations, scalars and tensors. Such\noscillations have a period of 4-5 efolds and an amplitude which is typically\nless than a few percent and decreases linearly with $f_\\gamma$. We also stress\nthat the comoving curvature perturbation on uniform density should be sensitive\nto slow-roll parameters related to $\\rho_R$ rather than $\\dot{\\phi}^2/2$,\nalthough we postpone a calculation of the power spectrum and of non-gaussianity\nto future work and we simply define and compute suitable slow roll parameters.\nFinally we stress that this scenario may be realized in the axion case, if the\ncoupling $1/f_\\gamma$ to U(1) (photons) is much larger than the coupling\n$1/f_G$ to non-abelian gauge fields (gluons), since the latter sets the range\nof the potential and therefore the maximal allowed $\\phi_0\\sim f_G$.\n", "  We propose a simplified protocol of quantum energy teleportation (QET) for\nholographic conformal field theory (CFT) in 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter space\nwith or without black hole. As a tentative proposal, we simplify the standard\nQET by replacing Alice's local measurement with the local projection, which\nexcites the system from ground state into a particular state dual to a Banados\ngeometry. We then mimic Bob's local operation of the usual QET for extracting\nenergy by deforming the UV surface with a local bump. Adopting the\nsurface/state duality this deformation corresponds to local unitary. We\nevaluate the extraction of energy from the holographic stress tensor, and find\nthat Bob always gains energy extraction in our protocol. This could be related\nto the positive energy theorem of the dual gravity. Moreover, the ratio of\nextraction energy to injection one is a universal function of the UV surface\ndeformation profile.\n", "  Spin-liquid behavior was recently suggested experimentally in the moderately\none-dimensional organic compound $\\kappa$-H$_3$(Cat-EDT-TTF)$_2$. This compound\ncan be modeled by the one-band Hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular\nlattice with $t^\\prime/t \\simeq 1.5$, where $t'$ is the minority hopping. It\nthus becomes important to extend previous studies, that were performed in the\nrange $0 \\leq t'/t \\leq 1.2$, to find out whether there is a regime where Mott\ninsulating behavior can be found without long-range magnetic order. To this\nend, we study the above model in the range $1.2 \\leq t'/t \\leq 2$ using cluster\ndynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We argue that it is important to choose a\nsymmetry-preserving cluster rather than a quasi one-dimensional cluster. We\nfind that, upon increasing $t'/t$ beyond $t^\\prime/t \\approx 1.3$, the Mott\ntransition at zero-temperature is replaced by a first-order transition\nseparating a metallic state from a collinear magnetic insulating state.\nNevertheless, at the physically relevant value $t^\\prime/t \\simeq 1.5$, the\ntransitions toward the magnetic and the Mott insulating phases are very close.\nThe phase diagram obtained in this study can provide a working basis for\nmoderately one-dimensional compounds on the anisotropic triangular lattice.\n", "  A new quantum eraser setup exploiting for the first time the time-energy\ncomplementarity relation in the x-ray regime is investigated theoretically.\nStarting point is the interference process between x-ray quanta driving two\nnuclear hyperfine transitions in a nuclear forward scattering setup. We show\nthat which-way information can be obtained by marking the scattering paths with\northogonal polarization states, thus leading to the disappearance of the\ninterference pattern. In turn, erasure of the which-way information leads to\nthe reappearance of the interference fringes. We put forward two schemes using\nresonant scattering off nuclear targets and design which-way marking procedures\nto realize the quantum eraser setup for x-ray quanta.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the (pseudo)rapidity distributions of massive\nvector bosons produced in p+p and p+Pb collisions at the LHC within the\nnext-to-leading order approximation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. In\nparticular, we discuss the impact of different cold nuclear matter effects on\nthis process using the nuclear parton distributions calculated from the\nmicroscopic model developed by Kulagin and Petti (KP). This model was\nsuccessfully applied to study nuclear effects in the deep-inelastic scattering\nand the Drell-Yan reactions off various (fixed) target nuclei. Results are\ncompared with the recent CMS and ATLAS p+Pb data with \\sqrt{s}=5.02 TeV per two\ncolliding nucleons. We found an excellent agreement between the predictions of\nthe KP model and the recent LHC data on W+- and Z0 production in p+Pb\ncollisions, including the differential cross sections, the forward-backward\nasymmetries, and W charge asymmetry. We also discuss the sensitivity of the\ncurrent and future LHC data to the underlying mechanisms responsible for the\nnuclear modifications of parton density functions.\n", "  We investigate the possibilities of producing neutron-rich nuclides in\nprojectile fission of heavy beams in the energy range of 20 MeV/nucleon\nexpected from low-energy facilities. We report our efforts to theoretically\ndescribe the reaction mechanism of projectile fission following a multinucleon\ntransfer collision at this energy range. Our calculations are mainly based on a\ntwo-step approach: the dynamical stage of the collision is described with\neither the phenomenological Deep-Inelastic Transfer model (DIT), or with the\nmicroscopic Constrained Molecular Dynamics model (CoMD). The\ndeexcitation/fission of the hot heavy projectile fragments is performed with\nthe Statistical Mul- tifragmentation Model (SMM). We compared our model\ncalculations with our previous experimental projectile-fission data of 238U (20\nMeV/nucleon)+208Pb and 197Au (20 MeV/nucleon)+197Au and found an overall\nreasonable agreement. Our study suggests that projectile fission following\nperiph- eral heavy-ion collisions at this energy range offers an effective\nroute to access very neutron-rich rare isotopes toward and beyond the\nastrophysical r-process path.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss non-perturbative infrared features of Yang-Mills\ntheory in Euclidean space-time dimensions greater than four in the Landau gauge\nand within the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework, which enables us to take\ninto account the existence of gauge copies by restricting the domain of\nintegration in the path integral to the Gribov region. Evidences for a\ndecoupling/massive solution for the gluon propagator in higher dimensions are\nprovided. This behavior is strengthened the bigger the dimension is. Further,\nwe show that, by a dimensional reduction of the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger action\nfrom five to four dimensions, a non-perturbative coupling between the inverse\nof the Faddeev-Popov operator and the scalar field corresponding to the fifth\ncomponent of the gauge field naturally arises, being in agreement with the\nrecently proposed mechanism \\cite{Capri:2014bsa} to generalize the Refined\nGribov-Zwanziger construction to the matter sector.\n", "  We investigate a unique type of zero-index medium with both gain and loss\n(ZIMGL), whose effective permittivity and permeability are purely imaginary and\nof opposite signs. We show analytically that, by using a slab of ZIM-GL with\nequal magnitude of loss and gain, coherent perfect absorber (CPA) and laser,\ni.e. the socalled CPA-laser, can be achieved simultaneously. CPA-laser has been\nfound previously in parity-time (PT) symmetric systems. However, the underlying\nphysics in a PT-symmetric system is distinct from that in a ZIM-GL. By\ndesigning a photonic crystal (PC) composed of core-shell rods, with loss and\ngain distributed in either the core or the shell, we have realized such a\nZIM-GL. The CPA-laser functionality of such a PC is also confirmed in our\nnumerical simulations. Our work provides a different approach for simultaneous\nrealization of CPA and laser besides PTsymmetric systems.\n", "  We study the ground state of a bilayer system of dipolar bosons with dipoles\noriented by an external field perpendicularly to the two parallel planes. By\ndecreasing the interlayer distance, for a fixed value of the strength of the\ndipolar interaction, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition from an\natomic to a pair superfluid. We investigate the excitation spectrum across this\ntransition by using microscopic approaches. Quantum Monte Carlo methods are\nemployed to obtain the static structure factors and intermediate scattering\nfunctions in imaginary time. The dynamic response is calculated using both the\ncorrelated basis functions (CBF) method and the approximate inversion of the\nLaplace transform of the quantum Monte Carlo imaginary time data. In the atomic\nphase, both density and spin excitations are gapless. However, in the\npair-superfluid phase a gap opens in the excitation energy of the spin mode.\nFor small separation between layers, the minimal spin excitation energy equals\nthe binding energy of a dimer and is twice the gap value.\n", "  We present a self-contained operator-based approach to derive the spectrum of\ntrapped ions. This approach provides the complete normal form of the low energy\nquadratic Hamiltonian in terms of bosonic phonons, as well as an effective free\nparticle degree of freedom for each spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. We\ndemonstrate how this formalism can directly be used to characterize an ion\nchain both in the linear and the zigzag regimes. In particular we compute, both\nfor the ground state and finite temperature states, spatial correlations, heat\ncapacity and dynamical susceptibility. Last, for the ground state which has\nquantum correlations, we analyze the amount of energy reduction compared to an\nuncorrelated state with minimum energy, thus highlighting how the system can\nlower its energy by correlations.\n", "  We compute the gradient expansion for anisotropic hydrodynamics. The results\nare compared with the corresponding expansion of the underlying kinetic-theory\nmodel with the collision term treated in the relaxation time approximation. We\nfind that a recent formulation of anisotropic hydrodynamics based on an\nanisotropic matching principle yields the first three terms of the gradient\nexpansion in agreement with those obtained for the kinetic theory. This gives\nfurther support for this particular hydrodynamic model as a good approximation\nof the kinetic-theory approach. We further find that the gradient expansion of\nanisotropic hydrodynamics is an asymptotic series, and the singularities of the\nanalytic continuation of its Borel transform indicate the presence of\nnon-hydrodynamic modes.\n", "  We demonstrate that underlying assumptions concerning the structure of\nconstituent parton Fock states in hadrons make a strong impact on the\npredictions of hadronic interaction models for forward hadron spectra and for\nlong-range correlations between central and forward hadron production. Our\nanalysis shows that combined studies of proton-proton collisions at the Large\nHadron Collider by central and forward-looking detectors have a rich potential\nfor discriminating between the main model approaches.\n", "  Characteristic functions (CFs) provide a very efficient method for evaluating\nthe probability density functions of stochastic thermodynamic quantities and\ninvestigating their statistical features in quantum master equations (QMEs). A\nconventional procedure for obtaining these functions is to resort to a\nfirst-principles approach; namely, the evolution equations of the CFs of the\ncombined system and its environment are obtained and then projected into the\ndegrees of freedom of the system. However, the QMEs can be unraveled by a\nquantum jump trajectory. Thermodynamic quantities such as the heat, work, and\nentropy production can be well defined along a trajectory. Hence, on the basis\nof the notion of a trajectory, can we straightforwardly derive these CFs, e.g.,\ntheir evolution equations? This is essential to establish the self-contained\nstochastic thermodynamics of a QME. In this paper, we show that it is indeed\nplausible and also simple. Particularly, these equations are fully consistent\nwith those obtained by the first-principles method. Our results have practical\nsignificance; they indicate that the quantum fluctuation relations could be\nverified by more realistic photocounting experiments.\n", "  The spoke cavities mounted in the China Accelerator Driven sub-critical\nSystem (C-ADS) have high quality factor(Q) and very small bandwidth, making\nthem very sensitive to mechanical perturbations whether external or\nself-induced. The transfer function is used to characterize the response of the\ncavity eigen frequency to the perturbations. This paper describes a method to\nmeasure the transfer function of a spoke cavity. The measured Lorentz transfer\nfunction shows there are 206 Hz and 311 Hz mechanical eigenmodes excited by\nLorentz force in the cavity of C-ADS, and the measured piezo fast tuner\ntransfer function shows there are 12 mechanical eigenmodes from 0 to 500 Hz.\nAccording to these results, some effective measures have been taken to weaken\nthe influence from helium pressure fluctuation, avoid mechanical resonances and\nimprove the reliability of RF system.\n", "  In Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) scalar-tensor theories, which are\noutside the domain of second-order Horndeski theories, it is known that there\nexists a solid angle deficit singularity in the case where the parameter\n$\\alpha_{\\rm H}$ characterizing the deviation from Horndeski theories\napproaches a non-vanishing constant at the center of a spherically symmetric\nbody. Meanwhile, it was recently shown that second-order generalized Proca\ntheories with a massive vector field $A^{\\mu}$ can be consistently extended to\nbeyond-generalized Proca theories, which recover shift-symmetric GLPV theories\nin the scalar limit $A^{\\mu} \\to \\nabla^{\\mu} \\chi$. In beyond-generalized\nProca theories up to quartic-order Lagrangians, we show that solid angle\ndeficit singularities are generally absent due to the existence of a temporal\nvector component. We also derive the vector-field profiles around a compact\nobject and show that the success of the Vainshtein mechanism operated by vector\nGalileons is not prevented by new interactions in beyond generalized Proca\ntheories.\n", "  The Debye-H\\\"uckel approximation to the free-energy of a simple fluid is\nwritten as a functional of the pair correlation function. This functional can\nbe seen as the Debye-H\\\"uckel equivalent to the functional derived in the\nhyper-netted chain framework by Morita and Hiroike, as well as by Lado. It\nallows one to obtain the Debye-H\\\"uckel integral equation through a\nminimization with respect to the pair correlation function, leads to the\ncorrect form of the internal energy, and fulfills the virial theorem.\n", "  We show that a model with a scalar leptoquark of hypercharge $Y=1/6$ which\nincludes the light right-handed neutrinos, can successfully describe both of\nthe $B$-physics anomalies, $R_K^{\\rm exp} < R_K^{\\rm SM}$ and $R_D^{\\rm exp} >\nR_D^{\\rm SM}$. We discuss the corresponding low energy effective theory and,\nafter using the known experimental data as constraints, we show that the model\nis viable and that it offers several predictions which can be tested\nexperimentally.\n", "  We study the expansion of an interacting atomic system at zero temperature,\nfollowing its release from an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic trap and\ncalculate the time dependence of its density and momentum distribution, with\nspecial focus on the behavior of the contact parameter. We consider different\nquantum systems, including the unitary Fermi gas of infinite scattering length,\nthe weakly interacting Bose gas, and two interacting particles with highly\nasymmetric mass imbalance. In all cases analytic results can be obtained, which\nshow that the initial value of the contact, fixing the $1/k^4$ tail of the\nmomentum distribution, disappears for large expansion times. Our results raise\nthe problem of understanding the recent experiment of Chang \\textit{et al.}\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{117}, 235303 (2016)] carried out on a weakly\ninteracting Bose gas of metastable $^4$He atoms, where a $1/r^4$ tail in the\ndensity distribution was observed after a large expansion time, implying the\nexistence of the $1/k^4$ tail in the asymptotic momentum distribution.\n", "  We present \\textsl{Hubble Space Telescope} (\\textsl{HST}) F606W-band imaging\nobservations of 21 galaxy-Ly$\\alpha$ emitter lens candidates in the Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line Lens Survey (BELLS) for\nGALaxy-Ly$\\alpha$ EmitteR sYstems (BELLS GALLERY) survey. 17 systems are\nconfirmed to be definite lenses with unambiguous evidence of multiple imaging.\nThe lenses are primarily massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts of\napproximately $0.55$, while the lensed sources are Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs)\nat redshifts from 2 to 3. Although the \\textsl{HST} imaging data are well fit\nby smooth lens models consisting of singular isothermal ellipsoids in an\nexternal shear field, a thorough exploration of dark substructures in the lens\ngalaxies is required. The Einstein radii of the BELLS GALLERY lenses are on\naverage $60\\%$ larger than those of the BELLS lenses because of the much higher\nsource redshifts which will allow a detailed investigation of the radius\nevolution of the mass profile in ETGs. With the aid of the average $\\sim 13\n\\times$ lensing magnification, the LAEs are resolved to comprise individual\nstar-forming knots of a wide range of properties with characteristic sizes from\nless than 100 pc to several kpc, rest-frame far UV apparent AB magnitudes from\n29.6 to 24.2, and typical projected separations of 500 pc to 2 kpc.\n", "  We introduce a class of discrete random walk model driven by global memory\neffects. At any time the right-left transitions depend on the whole previous\nhistory of the walker, being defined by an urn-like memory mechanism. The\ncharacteristic function is calculated in an exact way, which allows us to\ndemonstrate that the ensemble of realizations is ballistic. Asymptotically each\nrealization is equivalent to that of a biased Markovian diffusion process with\ntransition rates that strongly differs from one trajectory to another. Using\nthis \"inhomogeneous diffusion\" feature the ergodic properties of the dynamics\nare analytically studied through the time-averaged moments. In the long time\nregime they becomes random objects. While their mean values recover the\ncorresponding ensemble averages, departure between time and ensemble averages\nis explicitly shown through their probability densities. For the density of the\nsecond time-averaged moment an ergodic limit and the limit of infinite lag\ntimes do not commutate. All these effects are induced by the memory effects.\n", "  We investigate the orbital and rotational evolution of the CoRoT-7 two-planet\nsystem, assuming that the innermost planet behaves like a Maxwell body. We\nnumerically resolve the coupled differential equations governing the\ninstantaneous deformation of the inner planet together with the orbital motion\nof the system. We show that, depending on the relaxation time for the\ndeformation of the planet, the orbital evolution has two distinct behaviours:\nfor relaxation times shorter than the orbital period, we reproduce the results\nfrom classic tidal theories, for which the eccentricity is always damped.\nHowever, for longer relaxation times, the eccentricity of the inner orbit is\nsecularly excited and can grow to high values. This mechanism provides an\nexplanation for the present high eccentricity observed for CoRoT-7 b, as well\nas for other close-in super-Earths in multiple planetary systems.\n", "  We study the collapse of an attractive atomic Bose-Einstein condensate\nprepared in the uniform potential of an optical-box trap. We characterise the\ncritical point for collapse and the collapse dynamics, observing universal\nbehaviour in agreement with theoretical expectations. Most importantly, we\nobserve a clear experimental signature of the counterintuitive weak collapse,\nnamely that making the system more unstable can result in a smaller particle\nloss. We experimentally determine the scaling laws that govern the\nweak-collapse atom loss, providing a benchmark for the general theories of\nnonlinear wave phenomena.\n", "  An infinite array of globally coupled overdamped constituents moving in a\ndouble-well potential with $n$-th order saturation term under the influence of\nadditive Gaussian white noise is investigated. The system exhibits a continuous\nphase transition from a symmetric phase to a symmetry-broken phase. The\nqualitative behavior is independent on $n$. The critical point is calculated\nfor strong and for weak noise, these limits are also bounds for the critical\npoint. Introducing an additional nonlinearity, such that the potential can have\nup to three minima, leads to richer behavior. There the parameter space divides\nin three regions, a region with a symmetric phase, a region with a phase of\nbroken symmetry and a region where both phases coexist. The region of\ncoexistence collapses into one of the others via a discontinuous phase\ntransition whereas the transition between the symmetric phase and the phase of\nbroken symmetry is continuous. The tricritical point where the three regions\nintersect, can be calculated for strong and for weak noise. These limiting\nvalues form optimal bounds on the tricritical point. In the region of\ncoexistence simulations of finite systems are performed. One finds that the\nstationary distribution of finite but large systems differs qualitatively from\nthe one of the infinite system. Hence the limits of stationarity and large\nsystem size do not commute.\n", "  CePdAl with Ce $4f$ moments forming a distorted kagom\\'e network is one of\nthe scarce materials exhibiting Kondo physics and magnetic frustration\nsimultaneously. As a result, antiferromagnetic (AF) order setting in at\n$T_{\\mathrm{N}} = 2.7$~K encompasses only two thirds of the Ce moments. We\nreport measurements of the specific heat, $C$, and the magnetic Gr\\\"uneisen\nparameter, $\\Gamma_{\\rm mag}$, on single crystals of CePd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$Al with\n$x\\leq 0.16$ at temperatures down to 0.05~K and magnetic fields $B$ up to\n$8$~T. Field-induced quantum criticality for various concentrations is observed\nwith the critical field decreasing to zero at $x_c\\approx 0.15$. Remarkably,\ntwo-dimensional (2D) AF quantum criticality of Hertz-Millis-Moriya type arises\nfor $x=0.05$ and $x=0.1$ at the suppression of 3D magnetic order. Furthermore,\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm mag}(B)$ shows an additional contribution near $2.5$~T for all\nconcentrations which is ascribed to correlations of the frustrated one third of\nCe moments.\n", "  We investigate a spontaneously broken $U(1)_d$ gauge symmetry with a\nmuon-specific dark Higgs. Our first goal is to verify how the presence of a new\ndark Higgs, $\\phi$, and a dark gauge boson, $V$, can simultaneously face the\nanomalies from the muon magnetic moment and the proton charge radius. Secondly,\nby assuming that $V$ must decay to an electron-positron pair, we explore the\ncorresponding parameter space determined with the low energy constraints coming\nfrom $ K \\to \\mu X$, electron $(g-2)_e$, $K \\to \\mu \\nu_\\mu e^+ e^-$, $K \\to\n\\mu \\nu_\\mu \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, $\\tau \\to \\nu_\\tau \\mu \\nu_\\mu e^+ e^-$. We focus in\nthe scenario where the $V$ mass is below $ \\sim 2 m_\\mu$ and the $\\phi$ mass\nruns from few MeV till $250$ MeV, with V-photon mixing of the order $\n\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. Among weak process at low energies, we check the\ninfluence of the new light vector on kaon decays as well as on the scattering\n$e^+ e^- \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^- e^+ e^-$ and discuss the impact of the dark\nHiggs on $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+ \\mu^- $. Finally, we consider\ncontributions of the V-photon mixing in the decays $\\pi^0 \\to \\gamma e^+ e^-$,\n$\\eta \\to \\gamma e^+ e^-$, $\\rho \\to \\pi e^+ e^-$, $K^* \\to K e^+ e^-$ and\n$\\phi (1020) \\to \\eta e^+ e^-$.\n", "  In this paper we propose equations of motion for the dynamics of liquid films\nof surfactant suspensions that consist of a general gradient dynamics framework\nbased on an underlying energy functional. This extends the gradient dynamics\napproach to dissipative non-equilibrium thin film systems with several\nvariables, and casts their dynamic equations into a form that reproduces\nOnsager's reciprocity relations. We first discuss the general form of gradient\ndynamics models for an arbitrary number of fields and discuss simple well-known\nexamples with one or two fields. Next, we develop the gradient dynamics (three\nfield) model for a thin liquid film covered by soluble surfactant and discuss\nhow it automatically results in consistent convective (driven by pressure\ngradients, Marangoni forces and Korteweg stresses), diffusive,\nadsorption/desorption, and evaporation fluxes. We then show that in the dilute\nlimit, the model reduces to the well-known hydrodynamic form that includes\nMarangoni fluxes due to a linear equation of state. In this case the energy\nfunctional incorporates wetting energy, surface energy of the free interface\n(constant contribution plus an entropic term) and bulk mixing entropy.\nSubsequently, as an example, we show how various extensions of the energy\nfunctional result in consistent dynamical models that account for nonlinear\nequations of state, concentration-dependent wettability and surfactant and film\nbulk decomposition phase transitions. We conclude with a discussion of further\npossible extensions towards systems with micelles, surfactant adsorption at the\nsolid substrate and bioactive behaviour.\n", "  Recent HESS observations of the ~200 pc scale diffuse gamma-ray emission from\nthe central molecular zone (CMZ) suggest the presence of a PeV cosmic-ray\naccelerator (PeVatron) located in the inner 10 pc region of the Galactic\nCenter. Interestingly, the gamma-ray spectrum of the point-like source (HESS\nJ1745-290) in the Galactic Center shows a cutoff at ~10 TeV, implying a cutoff\naround 100 TeV in the cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Here we propose that the\ngamma-ray emission from the inner and the outer regions may be explained\nself-consistently by run-away protons from a single, yet fading accelerator. In\nthis model, gamma rays from the CMZ region are produced by protons injected in\nthe past, while gamma rays from the inner region are produced by protons\ninjected more recently. We suggest that the blast wave formed in a tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) caused by the supermassive black hole (Sgr A*) could\nserve as such a fading accelerator. With typical parameters of the TDE blast\nwave, gamma-ray spectra of both the CMZ region and HESS J1745-290 can be\nreproduced simultaneously. Meanwhile, we find that the cosmic-ray energy\ndensity profile in the CMZ region may also be reproduced in the fading\naccelerator model when appropriate combinations of the particle injection\nhistory and the diffusion coefficient of cosmic rays are adopted.\n", "  We give a further step in the quantum mechanical description of engineered\natomic spin structures by deriving a master equation of the Redfield type that\ngoverns the dynamics of the atomic spin density matrix. By generalizing this\napproach to charge-specific density matrices, we are able to describe magnetic\ntransport quantities, such as the average inelastic current and the shot noise,\naccessible by tunneling spectroscopy. Our method suitably describes moderate\nlead-atom coupling regimes where quantum coherence effects cannot be\ndisregarded. We contrast our approach with the existing descriptions in terms\nof rate equations and show examples where coherence effects are crucial to\nunderstand the physics of spin-polarized tunnel current through spin\nstructures.\n", "  Average stellar radii in open clusters can be estimated from rotation periods\nand projected rotational velocities under the assumption of random orientation\nof the spin axis. Such estimates are independent of distance, interstellar\nabsorption, and models, but their validity can be limited by missing data\n(truncation) or data that only represent upper/lower limits (censoring). We\npresent a new statistical analysis method to estimate average stellar radii in\nthe presence of censoring and truncation. We use theoretical distribution\nfunctions of the projected stellar radius $R \\sin i$ to define a likelihood\nfunction in the presence of censoring and truncation. Average stellar radii in\nmagnitude bins are then obtained by a maximum likelihood parametric estimation\nprocedure. This method is capable of recovering the average stellar radius\nwithin a few percent with as few as $\\approx$ 10 measurements. Here it is\napplied for the first time to the dataset available for the Pleiades. We find\nan agreement better than $\\approx$ 10 percent between the observed $R$ vs $M_K$\nrelationship and current standard stellar models for 1.2 $\\ge M/M_{\\odot} \\ge$\n0.85 with no evident bias. Evidence of a systematic deviation at $2\\sigma$\nlevel are found for stars with 0.8 $\\ge M/M_{\\odot} \\ge$ 0.6 approaching the\nslow-rotator sequence. Fast-rotators ($P$ < 2 d) agree with standard models\nwithin 15 percent with no systematic deviations in the whole 1.2 $\\ge\nM/M_{\\odot} \\ge$ 0.5 range. The evidence found of a possible radius inflation\njust below the lower mass limit of the slow-rotator sequence indicates a\npossible connection with the transition from the fast to the slow-rotator\nsequence.\n", "  Energy-dependent and single-energy fits to the existing nucleon-nucleon\ndatabase have been updated to incorporate recent measurements. The fits cover a\nregion from threshold to 3 GeV, in the laboratory kinetic energy, for\nproton-proton scattering, with an upper limit of 1.3 GeV for neutron-proton\nscattering. Experiments carried out at the COSY-WASA and COSY-ANKE facilities\nhave had a significant impact on the partial-wave solutions. Results are\ndiscussed in terms of both partial-wave and direct reconstruction amplitudes.\n", "  By performing a slow adiabatic change between two traps of a quantum\nparticle, it is possible to transform an eigenstate of the original trap into\nthe corresponding eigenstate of the final trap. If no level crossings are\ninvolved, the process can be made faster than adiabatic by setting first the\ninterpolated evolution of the wave function from its initial to its final form\nand inferring from this evolution the trap deformation. We find a simple and\ncompact formula which gives the trap shape at any time for any interpolation\nscheme. It is applicable even in complicated scenarios where there is no\nadiabatic process for the desired state-transformation, e.g., if the state\nchanges its topological properties. We illustrate its use for the expansion of\na harmonic trap, for the transformation of a harmonic trap into a linear trap\nand into an arbitrary number of traps of a periodic structure. Finally, we\nstudy the creation of a node exemplified by the passage from the ground state\nto the first excited state of a harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We study the Josephson effect in a quantum spin Hall system coupled to a\nlocalized magnetic impurity. As a consequence of the fermion parity anomaly,\nthe spin of the combined system of impurity and spin-Hall edge alternates\nbetween half-integer and integer values when the superconducting phase\ndifference across the junction advances by $2\\pi$. This leads to characteristic\ndifferences in the splittings of the spin multiplets by exchange coupling and\nsingle-ion anisotropy at phase differences, for which time-reserval symmetry is\npreserved. We discuss the resulting $8\\pi$-periodic (or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$)\nfractional Josephson effect in the context of recent experiments.\n", "  Combining analytic calculations, computer simulations, and classical density\nfunctional theory we determine the interfacial tension of orientable\ntwo-dimensional hard rectangles near a curved hard wall. Both a circular cavity\nholding the particles and a hard circular obstacle surrounded by particles are\nconsidered. We focus on moderate bulk densities (corresponding to area\nfractions up to 50 percent) where the bulk phase is isotropic and vary the\naspect ratio of the rectangles and the curvature of the wall. The Tolman\nlength, which gives the leading curvature correction of the interfacial\ntension, is found to change sign at a finite density, which can be tuned via\nthe aspect ratio of the rectangles.\n", "  We study the main cosmological properties of the agegraphic dark energy model\nat the expansion and perturbation levels. Initially, using the latest\ncosmological data we implement a joint likelihood analysis in order to\nconstrain the cosmological parameters. Then we test the performance of the\nagegraphic dark energy model at the perturbation level and we define its\ndifference from the usual $\\Lambda$CDM model. Within this context, we verify\nthat the growth index of matter fluctuations depends on the choice of the\nconsidered agegraphic dark energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular,\nassuming a homogeneous agegraphic dark energy we find, for the first time, that\nthe asymptotic value of the growth index is $\\gamma \\approx 5/9$, which is\nclose to that of the usual $\\Lambda$ cosmology, $\\gamma^{(\\Lambda)} \\approx\n6/11$. Finally, if the distribution of dark energy is clustered then we obtain\n$\\gamma \\approx 1/2$ which is $\\sim 8\\%$ smaller than that of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel.\n", "  SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) emission has been imaged in NGC 1068 with the Plateau\nde Bure Interferometer (PdBI). We perform an LTE and RADEX analysis to\ndetermine the column densities and physical characteristics of the gas emitting\nthese two lines. We then use a chemical model to determine the origin of the\nemission. There is a strong SiO peak to the East of the AGN, with weak\ndetections to the West. This distribution contrasts that of HNCO, which is\ndetected more strongly to the West. The SiO emission peak in the East is\nsimilar to the peak of the molecular gas mass traced by CO. HNCO emission is\noffset from this peak by as much as 80 pc ( 1\"). We compare velocity integrated\nline ratios in the East and West. We confirm that SiO emission strongly\ndominates in the East, while the reverse is true in the West. We use RADEX to\nanalyse the possible gas conditions that could produce such emission. We find\nthat, in both East and West, we cannot constrain a single temperature for the\ngas. We run a grid of chemical models of potential shock processes in the CND\nand find that SiO is significantly enhanced during a fast (60 km/s) shock but\nnot during a slow (20 km/s) shock, nor in a gas not subjected to shocks at all.\nWe find the inverse for HNCO, whose abundance increases during slow shocks and\nin warm non-shocked gas. High SiO and low HNCO indicated a fast shock, while\nhigh HNCO and low SiO indicates either a slow shock or warm, dense, non-shocked\ngas. The East Knot is therefore likely to contain gas that is heavily shocked.\nFrom chemical modelling, gas in the West Knot may be non-shocked, or maybe\nundergoing a much milder shock event. When taking into account RADEX results,\nthe milder shock event is the more likely of the two scenarios.\n", "  Lattice gases in the strongly correlated regime have been proven to simulate\nquantum magnetic models under certain conditions: the mapping of the\ndouble-well system onto the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model is a paradigmatic\ncase. A suitable definition of the length in the Hilbert space of the system\nleads to the concept of a correlation length, whose divergence is a\ncharacteristic property of continuous quantum phase transitions. We calculate\nthe finite-size scaling of some observables like e.g. the magnetization or the\npopulation imbalance, as well as of the Schmidt gap, obtaining in this way the\ncritical exponents associated to such transitions. The systematic definition of\nthe Schmidt gap in extended Hamiltonians provides a good tool to analyze the\nset of critical exponents associated to transitions in systems formed by a\nlarger number of traps. This demonstrates, thus, the potential use of\nmesoscopic Bose-Einstein condensates as quantum simulators of condensed matter\nsystems.\n", "  We performed the photometric analysis of M2 and M92 globular clusters in g\nand r bands of SLOAN photometric system. We transformed these g and r bands\ninto BV bands of Johnson-Cousins photometric system and built the color\nmagnitude diagram (CMD). We estimated the age, and metallicity of both the\nclusters, by fitting Padova isochrones of different age and metallicities onto\nthe CMD. We studied Einstein and de Sitter model, bench mark model, the\ncosmological parameters by WMAP and Planck surveys. Finally, we compared\nestimated age of globular clusters to the ages from the cosmological models and\ncosmological parameters values of WMAP and Planck surveys.\n", "  Time-periodic (Floquet) topological phases of matter exhibit bulk-edge\nrelationships that are more complex than static topological insulators and\nsuperconductors. Finding the edge modes unique to driven systems usually\nrequires numerics. Here we present a minimal two-band model of Floquet\ntopological insulators and semimetals in two dimensions where all the bulk and\nedge properties can be obtained analytically. It is based on the extended\nHarper model of quantum Hall effect at flux one half. We show that periodical\ndriving gives rise to a series of phases characterized by a pair of integers.\nThe model has a most striking feature: the spectrum of the edge modes is always\ngiven by a single cosine function, $\\omega(k_y)\\propto \\cos k_y$ where $k_y$ is\nthe wave number along the edge, as if it is freely dispersing and completely\ndecoupled from the bulk. The cosine mode is robust against the change in\ndriving parameters and persists even to semi-metallic phases with Dirac points.\nThe localization length of the cosine mode is found to contain an integer and\nin this sense quantized.\n", "  We illustrate how it is possible to calculate the quantum gravitational\neffects on the spectra of primordial scalar/tensor perturbations starting from\nthe canonical, Wheeler-De Witt, approach to quantum cosmology. The composite\nmatter-gravity system is analysed through a Born-Oppenheimer approach in which\ngravitation is associated with the heavy degrees of freedom and matter (here\nrepresented by a scalar field) with the light ones. Once the independent\ndegrees of freedom are identified the system is canonically quantised. The\ndifferential equation governing the dynamics of the primordial spectra with its\nquantum-gravitational corrections is then obtained and is applied to diverse\ninflationary evolutions. Finally, the analytical results are compared to\nobservations through a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique and an estimate of\nthe free parameters of our approach is finally presented and the results\nobtained are compared with previous ones.\n", "  Hybrid $\\delta$ Scuti-$\\gamma$ Doradus pulsating stars show acoustic ($p$)\noscillation modes typical of $\\delta$ Scuti variable stars, and gravity ($g$)\npulsation modes characteristic of $\\gamma$ Doradus variable stars\nsimultaneously excited. Observations from space missions like MOST, CoRoT, and\n\\emph{Kepler} have revealed a large number of hybrid $\\delta$ Scuti-$\\gamma$\nDoradus pulsators, thus paving the way for a exciting new channel for\nasteroseismic studies. We perform a detailed asteroseismological modeling of\nfive hybrid $\\delta$ Scuti-$\\gamma$ Doradus stars. We employ a grid-based\nmodeling approach to sound the internal structure of the target stars by\nemploying a huge grid of stellar models from the zero-age main sequence to the\nterminal-age main sequence, varying parameters like stellar mass, effective\ntemperature, metallicity and core overshooting. We compute their adiabatic\nradial ($\\ell= 0$) and non-radial ($\\ell= 1, 2, 3$) $p$ and $g$ mode periods.\nWe employ two model-fitting procedures to searching for the models that best\nreproduce the observed pulsation spectra of each target star, that is, the\nasteroseismological models. We derive the fundamental parameters and the\nevolutionary status of five hybrid $\\delta$ Scuti-$\\gamma$ Doradus variable\nstars recently observed with the CoRoT and \\emph{Kepler} space missions: CoRoT\n105733033, CoRoT 100866999, KIC 11145123, KIC 9244992, and HD 49434. The\nasteroseismological model for each star results from different criteria of\nmodel selection, in which we take full advantage of the richness of periods\nthat characterizes the pulsation spectra of this kind of stars.\n", "  Following the recent discovery of the first radial velocity planet in a star\nstill possessing a protoplanetary disc (CI Tau), we examine the origin of the\nplanet's eccentricity (e $\\sim 0.3$). We show through long timescale ($10^5$\norbits) simulations that the planetary eccentricity can be pumped by the disc,\neven when its local surface density is well below the threshold previously\nderived from short timescale integrations. We show that the disc may be able to\nexcite the planet's orbital eccentricity in $<$ a Myr for the system parameters\nof CI Tau. We also perform two planet scattering experiments and show that\nalternatively the observed planet may plausibly have acquired its eccentricity\nthrough dynamical scattering of a migrating lower mass planet, which has either\nbeen ejected from the system or swallowed by the central star. In the latter\ncase the present location and eccentricity of the observed planet can be\nrecovered if it was previously stalled within the disc's magnetospheric cavity.\n", "  We report on the first focused hard X-ray view of the absorbed supergiant\nsystem IGRJ18027-2016 performed with the NuSTAR observatory. The pulsations are\nclearly detected with a period of $P_{spin}=139.866(1)$ s and a pulse fraction\nof about 50-60% at energies from 3 to 80 keV. The source demonstrates an\napproximately constant X-ray luminosity on a time scale of more than dozen\nyears with an average spin-down rate of $dP/dt\\simeq6\\times10^{-10}$ s/s. This\nbehaviour of the pulsar can be explained in terms of the wind accretion model\nin the settling regime. The detailed spectral analysis at energies above 10 keV\nwas performed for the first time and revealed a possible cyclotron absorption\nfeature at energy ~23 keV. This energy corresponds to the magnetic field\n$B\\simeq3\\times10^{12}$ G at the surface of the neutron star, which is typical\nfor X-ray pulsars.\n", "  The 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes started with a magnitude (M) 6.5 quake on Apr\n14 on the Hinagu fault zone (FZ), followed by active seismicity including an\nM6.4 quake. Eventually, an M7.3 quake occurred on Apr 16 on the Futagawa FZ. We\ninvestigated if any sign indicative of the M7.3 quake could be found in the\nspace-time changes of seismicity after the M6.5 quake. We determined in advance\nthe threshold magnitude, above which all earthquakes are completely recorded.\nWe then showed that the occurrence rate of relatively large (M >= 3)\nearthquakes significantly decreased 1 day before the M7.3 quake. Significance\nof this decrease was evaluated by one standard deviation of sampled changes in\nthe rate of occurrence. We next confirmed that seismicity with M >= 3 was well\nmodeled by the OU law with p ~ 1.5 +/- 0.3, which indicates that the temporal\ndecay of seismicity was significantly faster than a typical decay with p = 1.\nThe larger p value was obtained when we used data of the longer time period in\nthe analysis. This significance was confirmed by a bootstrapping approach. Our\ndetailed analysis shows that the large p value was caused by the rapid decay of\nthe seismicity in the northern area around the Futagawa FZ. Application of the\nslope (the b value) of the GR frequency-magnitude distribution to the\nspatiotemporal change in the seismicity revealed that the b value in the\nnorthern area increased significantly, the increase being db = 0.3-0.5.\nSignificance was verified by a statistical test of db and a test using\nbootstrapping errors. Based on our findings, combined with the results obtained\nby a stress inversion analysis performed by the NIED, we suggested that stress\nnear the Futagawa FZ had reduced just prior to the occurrence of the M7.3\nquake. We proposed, with some other observations, that a reduction in stress\nmight have been induced by growth of the slow slips on the Futagawa FZ.\n", "  The electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction shows up in a variety of phenomena\nincluding e.g. NMR studies of correlated states and spin decoherence effects in\nquantum dots. Here we focus on the hyperfine coupling and the NMR spin\nrelaxation time, $T_1$ in Weyl semimetals. Since the density of states in Weyl\nsemimetals varies with the square of the energy around the Weyl point, a naive\npower counting predicts a $1/T_1T\\sim E^4$ scaling with $E$ the maximum of\ntemperature ($T$) and chemical potential. By carefully investigating the\nhyperfine interaction between nuclear spins and Weyl fermions, we find that\nwhile its spin part behaves conventionally, its orbital part diverges unusually\nwith the inverse of energy around the Weyl point. Consequently, the nuclear\nspin relaxation rate scales in a graphene like manner as $1/T_1T\\sim\nE^2\\ln(E/\\omega_0)$ with $\\omega_0$ the nuclear Larmor frequency. This allows\nus to identify an effective hyperfine coupling constant, which is tunable by\ngating or doping, which is relevant for decoherence effect in spintronics\ndevices and double quantum dots where hyperfine coupling is the dominant source\nof spin-blockade lifting.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a rotating\nBose-Einstein condensation with non-zero interatomic interactions\ntheoretically. The analysis relies on a semiclassical Hartree-Fock\napproximation where an integral is performed over the phase space and function\nof the grand canonical ensemble is derived. Subsequently, we use this result to\nderive several thermodynamic quantities including the condensate fraction,\ncritical temperature, entropy and heat capacity. Thereby, we investigate the\neffect of the rotation rate and interactions parameter on the thermodynamic\nbehavior. The role of finite size is discussed. Our approach can be extended to\nconsider the rotating condensate in optical potential.\n", "  We use density-matrix renormalization group, applied to a one-dimensional\nmodel of continuum Hamiltonians, to accurately solve chains of hydrogen atoms\nof various separations and numbers of atoms. We train and test a\nmachine-learned approximation to $F[n]$, the universal part of the electronic\ndensity functional, to within quantum chemical accuracy. Our calculation (a)\nbypasses the standard Kohn-Sham approach, avoiding the need to find orbitals,\n(b) includes the strong correlation of highly-stretched bonds without any\nspecific difficulty (unlike all standard DFT approximations) and (c) is so\naccurate that it can be used to find the energy in the thermodynamic limit to\nquantum chemical accuracy.\n", "  We apply a PCA-based pre-whitening method to the entire collection of main\nKepler mission long-cadence data for KIC 8462852 spanning four years. This\ntechnique removes the correlated variations of instrumental origin in both the\ndetected light curves and astrometry, resolving intrinsic changes in flux and\nimage position of less than 100 ppm and 1 mas, respectively. Beside the major\ndips in the light curve during mission quarters 8 and 16, when the flux dropped\nby up to 20%, we confirm multiple smaller dips across the time span of\nobservation with amplitudes ranging from 0.1% to 7%. A variation of flux with a\nperiod of 0.88 d and a half-amplitude of approximately 90 ppm is confirmed in\nthe PCA-cleaned data. We find that the phase of the wave is steady over the\nentire 15-month interval. We confidently detect a weak variability-induced\nmotion (VIM) effect in the cleaned astrometric trajectories, when the\nmoment-based centroids shift synchronously with the flux dips by up to 0.0008\npixels on the detector. The inconsistent magnitude and direction of VIM effects\nwithin the same quarter point at more than one source of photometric\nvariability in the blended image. The 0.88 d periodicity comes from a different\nsource, not from the target star KIC 8462852. We discuss a possible\ninterpretation of the bizarre properties of the source as a swarm of\ninterstellar junk (comets and planetoids) crossing the line of sight to the\nstar and its optical companions at approximately 7 mas per year.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations, we analyze the structural properties of\ntungsten trioxide WO3 . Our calculations rely on density functional theory and\nthe use of the B1-WC hybrid functional, which provides very good agreement with\nexperimental data. The hypothetical high-symmetry cubic reference structure\ncombines several ferroelectric and antiferrodistortive (antipolar cation\nmotions, rotations and tilts of oxygen octahedra) structural instabilities. The\ninstability related to antipolar W motions combines with those associated to\noxygen rotations and tilts to produce the biggest energy reduction, yielding a\nP21/c ground state. This non-polar P21/c phase is only different from the\nexperimentally reported Pc ground state by the absence of a very tiny\nadditional ferroelectric distortion. The calculations performed on a\nstoichiometric compound so suggest that the low temperature phase of WO3 is not\nintrinsically ferroelectric and that the reported ferroelectric character might\narise from extrinsic defects such as oxygen vacancies. Independently, we also\nidentify never observed R3m and R3c ferroelectric phases with large\npolarizations and low energies close to the P 21/c ground state, which makes\nWO3 a potential antiferroelectric material. The relative stability of various\nphases is discussed in terms of the couplings between different structural\ndistortions, highlighting a very complex interplay involving improper-like\ncouplings up to fourth order in the energy expansion in the cubic phase.\n", "  We derive an analytic expression for the transitional column density value\n($s_t$) between the lognormal and power-law form of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) in star-forming molecular clouds. Our expression\nfor $s_t$ depends on the mean column density, the variance of the lognormal\nportion of the PDF, and the slope of the power-law portion of the PDF. We show\nthat $s_t$ can be related to physical quantities such as the sonic Mach number\nof the flow and the power-law index for a self-gravitating isothermal sphere.\nThis implies that the transition point between the lognormal and power-law\ndensity/column density PDF represents the critical density where turbulent and\nthermal pressure balance, the so-called \"post-shock density.\" We test our\nanalytic prediction for the transition column density using dust PDF\nobservations reported in the literature as well as numerical MHD simulations of\nself-gravitating supersonic turbulence with the Enzo code. We find excellent\nagreement between the analytic $s_t$ and the measured values from the numerical\nsimulations and observations (to within 1.5 A$_V$). We discuss the utility of\nour expression for determining the properties of the PDF from unresolved low\ndensity material in dust observations, for estimating the post-shock density,\nand for determining the HI-H$_2$ transition in clouds.\n", "  Bilayer graphene under a magnetic field has an octet of quasidegenerate\nlevels due to spin, valley, and orbital degeneracies. This zero-energy Landau\nlevel is resolved into several incompressible states whose nature is still\nelusive. We use a Hartree-Fock treatment of a realistic tight-binding four-band\nmodel to understand the quantum ferromagnetism phenomena expected for integer\nfillings of the octet levels. We include the exchange interaction with filled\nLandau levels below the octet states. This Lamb-shift-like effect contributes\nto the orbital splitting of the octet. We give phase diagrams as a function of\napplied bias and magnetic field. Some of our findings are in agreement with\nexperiments. We discuss the possible appearance of phases with orbital\ncoherence.\n", "  We study thermodynamic and transport properties for the isotropic\ncolor-spin-locking (iso-CSL) phase of two-flavor superconducting quark matter\nunder compact star constraints within a NJL-type chiral quark model. Chiral\nsymmetry breaking and the phase transition to superconducting quark matter\nleads to a density dependent change of quark masses, chemical potentials and\ndiquark gap. A self-consistent treatment of these physical quantities\ninfluences on the microscopic calculations of transport properties. We present\nresults for the iso-CSL direct URCA emissivities and bulk viscosities, which\nfulfill the constraints on quark matter derived from cooling and rotational\nevolution of compact stars. We compare our results with the phenomenologically\nsuccessful, but yet heuristic 2SC+X phase. We show that the microscopically\nfounded iso-CSL phase can replace the purely phenomenological 2SC+X phase in\nmodern simulations of the cooling evolution for compact stars with color\nsuperconducting quark matter interior.\n", "  In the present paper, we propose that the chiral magnetic effect, the direct\nconsequence of the presence of Weyl points in the band structure, can be\ndetected by its coupling to certain phonon modes, which behave like pseudo\nscalars under point group transformations. Such coupling can generate resonance\nbetween intrinsic plasmon oscillation and the corresponding phonon modes,\nleading to dramatic modification of the optical response by the external\nmagnetic field, which provides a new way to study chiral magnetic effect by\noptical measurements.\n", "  In this paper we consider a generally covariant theory of gravity, and extend\nthe generalized off-shell ADT current such that it becomes conserved for field\ndependent (asymptotically) Killing vector field. Then we define the extended\noff-shell ADT current and the extended off-shell ADT charge. Consequently, we\ndefine the conserved charge perturbation by integrating from the extended\noff-shell ADT charge over a spacelike codimension two surface. Eventually, we\nuse the presented formalism to find the conserved charge perturbation of an\nasymptotically flat spacetime. The conserved charge perturbation we obtain is\nexactly matched with the result of the paper \\cite{6'}. These charges are as\nrepresentations of the $BMS_4$ symmetry algebra. Also, we find that the near\nhorizon conserved charges of a non-extremal black hole with extended symmetries\nare the Noether charges. For this case our result is also exactly matched with\nthat of the paper \\cite{15}.\n", "  Wide-field (> 100 deg$^2$) hard X-ray coded-aperture telescopes with high\nangular resolution (< 2') will enable a wide range of time domain astrophysics.\nFor instance, transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts can be precisely\nlocalized without assistance of secondary focusing X-ray telescopes to enable\nrapid followup studies. On the other hand, high angular resolution in\ncoded-aperture imaging introduces a new challenge in handling the systematic\nuncertainty: average photon count per pixel is often too small to establish a\nproper background pattern or model the systematic uncertainty in a time scale\nwhere the model remains invariant. We introduce two new techniques to improve\ndetection sensitivity, which are designed for, but not limited to high\nresolution coded-aperture system: a self-background modeling scheme which\nutilizes continuous scan or dithering operations, and a Poisson-statistics\nbased probabilistic approach to evaluate the significance of source detection\nwithout subtraction in handling the background. We illustrate these new imaging\nanalysis techniques in high resolution coded-aperture telescope using the data\nacquired by the wide-field hard X-ray telescope ProtoEXIST2 during the\nhigh-altitude balloon flight in Fall, 2012. We review the imaging sensitivity\nof ProtoEXIST2 during the flight, and demonstrate the performance of the new\ntechniques using our balloon flight data in comparison with simulated ideal\nPoisson background.\n", "  We study in this work a continuum model derived from 1D\nattachment-detachment-limited (ADL) type step flow on vicinal surface, $\nu_t=-u^2(u^3)_{hhhh}$, where $u$, considered as a function of step height $h$,\nis the step slope of the surface. We formulate a notion of weak solution to\nthis continuum model and prove the existence of a global weak solution, which\nis positive almost everywhere. We also study the long time behavior of weak\nsolution and prove it converges to a constant solution as time goes to\ninfinity. The space-time H\\\"older continuity of the weak solution is also\ndiscussed as a byproduct.\n", "  LkCa 15 is an extensively studied star in the Taurus region known for its\npre-transitional disk with a large inner cavity in dust continuum and normal\ngas accretion rate. The most popular hypothesis to explain the LkCa 15 data\ninvokes one or more planets to carve out the inner cavity, while gas continues\nto flow across the gap from the outer disk onto the central star. We present\nspatially unresolved HCO+ J=4-3 observations of the LkCa 15 disk from the JCMT\nand model the data with the ProDiMo code. We find that: (1) HCO+ line-wings are\nclearly detected, certifying the presence of gas in the cavity within <50 AU of\nthe star. (2) Reproducing the observed line-wing flux requires both a\nsignificant suppression of cavity dust (by a factor >10^4 compared to the ISM)\nand a substantial increase in the gas scale-height within the cavity (H_0/R_0 ~\n0.6). An ISM dust-to-gas ratio (d:g=10^-2) yields too little line-wing flux\nregardless of the scale-height or cavity gas geometry, while a smaller\nscale-height also under predicts the flux even with a reduced d:g. (3) The\ncavity gas mass is consistent with the surface density profile of the outer\ndisk extended inwards to the sublimation radius (corresponding to mass M_d ~\n0.03 M_sun), and masses lower by a factor >10 appear to be ruled out.\n", "  The average fidelity of the teleportation of a coherent state is calculated\nfor general Gaussian bipartite systems shared by the partners of the protocol,\nAlice and Bob. It is considered that the shared Gaussian bipartite modes suffer\nindependent attenuations before the processing of Alice and Bob. Moreover the\nclassical communication between the partners can be controlled by a gain not\nnecessarily unitary. Comparing with the classical fidelity threshold of\nmeasure-and-prepare methods, we establish several genuinely quantum\nteleportation conditions which depend on the gain and the local attenuations.\nConsidering that the gain can be tuned to maximize the bipartite state set able\nto genuinely quantum teleportation, a condition for teleportation robust to\nlocal attenuations is found. This condition is demonstrated to be essentially\nequivalent to the condition of robust Gaussian bipartite entanglement, obtained\nin previous articles, showing that the attenuation robustness is an\nentanglement property relevant for characterization and application of\nbipartite systems. For the derivation of the robust teleportation conditions,\nthe Gaussian operations onto the bipartite system are thoroughly studied, so\nthat the transformations that maintain the fidelity invariant are found. Some\nscenarios for different Gaussian bipartite states are presented and discussed.\n", "  We argue that a natural boundary condition for gravity in asymptotically AdS\nspaces is to hold the {\\em renormalized} boundary stress tensor density fixed,\ninstead of the boundary metric. This leads to a well-defined variational\nproblem, as well as new counter-terms and a finite on-shell action. We\nelaborate this in various (even and odd) dimensions in the language of\nholographic renormalization. Even though the {\\em form} of the new renormalized\naction is distinct from the standard one, once the cut-off is taken to\ninfinity, their {\\em values} on classical solutions coincide when the trace\nanomaly vanishes. For AdS$_4$, we compute the ADM form of this renormalized\naction and show in detail how the correct thermodynamics of Kerr-AdS black\nholes emerge. We comment on the possibility of a consistent quantization with\nour boundary conditions when the boundary is dynamical, and make a connection\nto the results of Compere and Marolf. The difference between our approach and\nmicrocanonical-like ensembles in standard AdS/CFT is emphasized.\n", "  We analyze the wavelength-dependent variability of a sample of\nspectroscopically confirmed active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected from near-UV\n($NUV$) variable sources in the GALEX Time Domain Survey that have a large\namplitude of optical variability (difference-flux S/N $>$ 3) in the Pan-STARRS1\nMedium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS). By matching GALEX and PS1 epochs in 5 bands\n($NUV$, $g_{P1}$, $r_{P1}$, $i_{P1}$, $z_{P1}$) in time, and taking their flux\ndifference, we create co-temporal difference-flux spectral energy distributions\n($\\Delta f$SEDs) using two chosen epochs for each of the 23 objects in our\nsample on timescales of about a year.\n  We confirm the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend reported in previous studies, and\nmeasure a median spectral index of the $\\Delta f$SEDs of $\\alpha_{\\lambda}$ =\n2.1 that is consistent with an accretion disk spectrum. We further fit the\n$\\Delta f$SEDs of each source with a standard accretion disk model in which the\naccretion rate changes from one epoch to the other. In our sample, 17 out of 23\n($\\sim$74 %) sources are well described by this variable accretion-rate disk\nmodel, with a median average characteristic disk temperature $\\bar{T}^*$ of\n$1.2\\times 10^5$~K that is consistent with the temperatures expected given the\ndistribution of accretion rates and black hole masses inferred for the sample.\nOur analysis also shows that the variable accretion rate model is a better fit\nto the $\\Delta f$SEDs than a simple power law.\n", "  We use the combined data from the COS-GASS and COS-Halos surveys to\ncharacterize the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM) surrounding typical low-redshift\ngalaxies in the mass range $\\rm~M_*\\sim~10^{9.5-11.5}~M_{\\odot} $, and over a\nrange of impact parameters extending to just beyond the halo virial radius\n($\\rm~R_{vir}$). We find the radial scale length of the distributions of the\nequivalent widths of the Lyman~$\\alpha$ and Si III absorbers to be 0.9 and 0.4\n$\\rm~R_{vir}$, respectively. The radial distribution of equivalent widths is\nrelatively uniform for the blue galaxies, but highly patchy (low covering\nfraction) for the red galaxies. We also find that the Lyman~$\\alpha$ and Si III\nequivalent widths show significant positive correlations with the specific\nstar-formation rate (sSFR) of the galaxy. We find a surprising lack of\ncorrelations between the halo mass (virial velocity) and either the velocity\ndispersions or velocity offsets of the Lyman~$\\alpha$ lines. The ratio of the\nvelocity offset to the velocity dispersion for the Lyman~$\\alpha$ absorbers has\na mean value of $\\sim$ 4, suggesting that a given the line-of-sight is\nintersecting a dynamically coherent structure in the CGM rather than a sea of\norbiting clouds. The kinematic properties of the CGM are similar in the blue\nand red galaxies, although we find that a significantly larger fraction of the\nblue galaxies have large Lyman~$\\alpha$ velocity offsets (>200 km s$^{-1}$). We\nshow that - if the CGM clouds represent future fuel for star-formation - our\nnew results could imply a large drop in the specific star-formation rate across\nthe galaxy mass-range we probe.\n", "  The carrier mobility of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors under\nlongitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon scattering was theoretically studied with the\ndeformation potential theory. Based on Boltzmann equation with relaxation time\napproximation, an analytic formula of intrinsic anisotropic mobility was\ndeduced, which shows that the influence of effective mass to the mobility\nanisotropy is larger than that of deformation potential constant and elastic\nmodulus. Parameters were collected for various anisotropic 2D materials (black\nphosphorus, Hittorf's phosphorus, BC$_2$N, MXene, TiS$_3$, GeCH$_3$) to\ncalculate their mobility anisotropy. It was revealed that the anisotropic ratio\nwas overestimated in the past.\n", "  We examine updated prospects for detecting WIMPs in supersymmetric models via\ndirect and indirect dark matter search experiments. We examine several\nhistorical and also still viable scenarios: projections for well-tempered\nneutralinos (WTN), projections from the MasterCode (MC), BayesFits (BF) and\nFittino (FO) collaborations, non-thermal wino dark matter (NThW) and finally\nmixed axion-higgsino dark matter from SUSY with radiatively-driven naturalness\n(RNS). The WTN is ruled out by recent limits from XENON and LUX collaborations.\nThe NThW scenario, previously on tenuous ground due to gamma-line searches,\nappears also ruled out by recent combined Fermi-LAT/MAGIC limits combined with\nnew HESS results from continuum gamma rays. Substantial portions of MC\nparameter space and 1 TeV higgsino parameter space from BF group are ruled out.\nThe 100-300 GeV higgsino-like WIMP from RNS survives due to its possible\ndepleted local abundance (where the axion may make up the bulk of dark matter).\nProjections from ton-scale noble liquid detectors should discover or rule out\nWIMPs from the remaining parameter space of these surviving models.\n", "  A novel solid state based charge qubit is presented. The system consists of a\none-dimensional wire with a pair of qubits embedded at its center. It is shown\nthat the system supports collective states localized in the left and right\nsides of the wire and therefore, as a whole, performs as a single qubit. The\ncouplings between the ground and excited states of the two central qubits are\ninversely proportional making them fully asynchronized and allowing for\ncoherent manipulation and gate operations. Initialization and measurement\ndevices, such as leads and charge detectors, connected to the edges of the wire\nare modeled by a continuum of energy states. The coupling to the continuum is\ndiscussed using the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. At weak continuum\ncoupling, all internal states uniformly acquire small decay widths. This\nchanges dramatically as the coupling strength increases: the width distribution\nundergoes a sharp restructuring and is no longer uniformly divided among the\neigenstates. Two broad resonances localized at the ends of the wire are formed.\nThese superradiant states (analogous to Dicke states in quantum optics),\neffectively protect the remaining internal states from decaying into the\ncontinuum and hence increase the lifetime of the qubit. Environmental noise is\nintroduced by considering random Gaussian fluctuations of electronic energies.\nThe interplay between decoherence and superradiance is studied by solving the\nstochastic Liouville equation. In addition to increasing the lifetime, the\nemergence of the superradiant states increases the qubit coherence.\n", "  High levels of deuterium fraction in N$_2$H$^+$ are observed in some\npre-stellar cores. Single-zone chemical models find that the timescale required\nto reach observed values ($D_{\\rm frac}^{{\\rm N}_2{\\rm H}^+} \\equiv {\\rm\nN}_2{\\rm D}^+/{\\rm N}_2{\\rm H}^+ \\gtrsim 0.1$) is longer than the free-fall\ntime, possibly ten times longer. Here, we explore the deuteration of turbulent,\nmagnetized cores with 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulations. We use an\napproximate chemical model to follow the growth in abundances of N$_2$H$^+$ and\nN$_2$D$^+$. We then examine the dynamics of the core using each tracer for\ncomparison to observations. We find that the velocity dispersion of the core as\ntraced by N$_2$D$^+$ appears slightly sub-virial compared to predictions of the\nTurbulent Core Model of McKee & Tan, except at late times just before the onset\nof protostar formation. By varying the initial mass surface density, the\nmagnetic energy, the chemical age, and the ortho-to-para ratio of H$_2$, we\nalso determine the physical and temporal properties required for high\ndeuteration. We find that low initial ortho-to-para ratios ($\\lesssim 0.01$)\nand/or multiple free-fall times ($\\gtrsim 3$) of prior chemical evolution are\nnecessary to reach the observed values of deuterium fraction in pre-stellar\ncores.\n", "  We study the magnetic properties of the adatom systems on a semiconductor\nsurface Si(111):\\{C,Si,Sn,Pb\\} - ($\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$). On the basis of\nall-electron density functional theory calculations we construct effective\nlow-energy models taking into account spin-orbit coupling and electronic\ncorrelations. In the ground state the surface nanostructures are found to be\ninsulators with the non-collinear 120$^{\\circ}$ N\\'eel (for C, Si, Sn monolayer\ncoverages) and 120$^{\\circ}$ row-wise (for Pb adatom) antiferromagnetic\norderings. The corresponding spin Hamiltonians with anisotropic exchange\ninteractions are derived by means of the superexchange theory and the\ncalculated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions are revealed to be very strong\nand compatible with the isotropic exchange couplings in the systems with Sn and\nPb adatoms. To simulate the excited magnetic states we solve the constructed\nspin models by means of the Monte Carlo method. At low temperatures and zero\nmagnetic field we observe complex spin spiral patterns in Sn/Si(111) and\nPb/Si(111). On this basis the formation of antiferromagnetic skyrmion lattice\nstates in adatom $sp$ electron systems in strong magnetic fields is discussed.\n", "  For laser cooling considerations, we have theoretically investigated the\nelectronic, rovibrational and hypefine structures of BaF molecule. The highly\ndiagonal Franck-Condon factors and the branching ratios for all possible\ntransitions within the lowest-lying four electronic states have also been\ncalculated. Meanwhile, the mixing between metastable A'2{\\Delta} and A2{\\Pi}\nstates and further the lifetime of the {\\Delta} state have been estimated since\nthe loss procedure via {\\Delta} state would like fatally destroy the main\nquasi-cycling {\\Sigma}-{\\Pi} transition for cooling and trapping. The resultant\nhyperfine splittings of each rovibrational states in X2{\\Sigma}+ state provide\nbenchmarksfor sideband modulations of cooling and repumping lasers and remixing\nmicrowaves to address all necessary levels. The calculated Zeeman shift and\ng-factors for both X and A states serve as benchmarks for selections of the\ntrapping laser polarizations. Our study paves the way for future laser cooling\nand magneto-optical trapping of the BaF molecule.\n", "  We analyze chiral restoration within the $O(N+1)/O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model\nfor large $N$ as an effective theory for low-energy QCD at finite temperature\n$T$. The free energy is constructed diagramatically to ${\\cal O}(TM^3)$ in the\npion mass expansion, which allows to derive the quark condensate and the scalar\nsusceptibility in the chiral limit. At this order, we do not have to deal with\nrenormalization, neither from divergences from mass tadpoles nor from those of\nhigher order loop contributions. Our results for the critical behaviour are\nconsistent with expectations from lattice analysis and with previous works\nwhere the susceptibility is saturated by the thermal $f_0(500)$ pole.\n", "  The deformation of brittle material is primarily accompanied by\nmicro-cracking and faulting. However, it has often been found that continuum\nfluid models, usually based on a non-Newtonian viscosity, are applicable. To\nexplain this rheology, we use a fiber-bundle model, which is a model of damage\nmechanics. In our analyses, yield stress was introduced. Above this stress, we\nhypothesize that the fibers begin to fail and a failed fiber is replaced by a\nnew fiber. This replacement is analogous to a micro-crack or an earthquake and\nits iteration is analogous to stick-slip motion. Below the yield stress, we\nassume that no fiber failure occurs, and the material behaves elastically. We\nshow that deformation above yield stress under a constant strain rate for a\nsufficient amount of time can be modeled as an equation similar to that used\nfor non-Newtonian viscous flow. We expand our rheological model to treat\nviscoelasticity and consider a stress relaxation problem. The solution can be\nused to understand aftershock temporal decay following an earthquake. Our\nresults provide justification for the use of a non-Newtonian viscous flow to\nmodel the continuum deformation of brittle materials.\n", "  Thermal properties of solid-state materials are a fundamental topic of study\nwith important practical implications. For example, anisotropic displacement\nparameters (ADPs) are routinely used in physics, chemistry, and crystallography\nto quantify the thermal motion of atoms in crystals. ADPs are commonly derived\nfrom diffraction experiments, but recent developments have also enabled their\nfirst-principles prediction using periodic density functional theory (DFT).\nHere, we combine experiments and dispersion-corrected DFT to quantify lattice\nthermal expansion and ADPs in crystalline {\\alpha}-sulfur (S8), a prototypical\nelemental solid that is controlled by the interplay of covalent and van der\nWaals interactions. We first report on single-crystal and powder X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) measurements that provide new and improved reference data\nfrom 10 K up to room temperature. We then use several popular\ndispersion-corrected DFT methods to predict vibrational and thermal properties\nof {\\alpha}-sulfur, including the anisotropic lattice thermal expansion.\nHereafter, ADPs are derived in the commonly used harmonic approximation (in the\ncomputed zero-Kelvin structure) and also in the quasi-harmonic approximation\n(QHA) which takes the predicted lattice thermal expansion into account. At the\nPBE+D3(BJ) level, the latter leads to excellent agreement with experiments.\nFinally, more general implications of this study for realistic materials\nmodeling at finite temperature are discussed.\n", "  The domain of outer communication of five-dimensional asymptotically flat\nstationary spacetimes may possess non-trivial 2-cycles (bubbles). Spacetimes\ncontaining such 2-cycles can have non-zero energy, angular momenta, and charge\neven in the absence of horizons. A mass variation formula has been established\nfor spacetimes containing bubbles and possibly a black hole horizon. This\n`first law of black hole and soliton mechanics' contains new intensive and\nextensive quantities associated to each 2-cycle. We consider examples of such\nspacetimes for which we explicitly calculate these quantities and show how\nregularity is essential for the formulae relating them to hold. We also derive\nnew explicit expressions for the angular momenta and charge for spacetimes\ncontaining solitons purely in terms of fluxes supporting the bubbles.\n", "  gPhoton is a new database product and software package that enables analysis\nof GALEX ultraviolet data at the photon level. The project's stand-alone,\npure-Python calibration pipeline reproduces the functionality of the original\nmission pipeline to reduce raw spacecraft data to lists of time-tagged,\nsky-projected photons, which are then hosted in a publicly available database\nby the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope (MAST). This database contains\napproximately 130 terabytes of data describing approximately 1.1 trillion\nsky-projected events with a timestamp resolution of five milliseconds. A\nhandful of Python and command line modules serve as a front-end to interact\nwith the database and to generate calibrated light curves and images from the\nphoton-level data at user-defined temporal and spatial scales. The gPhoton\nsoftware and source code are in active development and publicly available under\na permissive license. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of\nthe calibration pipeline, database, and tools, with emphasis on divergence from\nprior work, as well as challenges created by the large data volume. We\nsummarize the astrometric and photometric performance of gPhoton relative to\nthe original mission pipeline. For a brief example of short time domain science\ncapabilities enabled by gPhoton, we show new flares from the known M dwarf\nflare star CR Draconis. The gPhoton software has permanent object identifiers\nwith the ASCL (ascl:1603.004) and DOI (doi:10.17909/T9CC7G). This paper\ndescribes the software as of version v1.27.2.\n", "  We determine probabilities of physical association for stars in blended\nKepler Objects of Interest, and find that $14.5\\%^{+3.8\\%}_{-3.4\\%}$ of\ncompanions within $\\sim4\\arcsec$ are consistent with being physically\nunassociated with their primary. This produces a better understanding of\npotential false positives in the Kepler catalog and will guide models of planet\nformation in binary systems. Physical association is determined through two\nmethods of calculating multi-band photometric parallax using visible and\nnear-infrared adaptive optics observation of 84 KOI systems with 104\ncontaminating companions within $\\sim4\\arcsec$. We find no evidence that KOI\ncompanions with separation of less than $1\\arcsec$ are more likely to be\nphysically associated than KOI companions generally. We also reinterpret\ntransit depths for 94 planet candidates, and calculate that $2.6\\% \\pm 0.4\\%$\nof transits have $R > 15R_{\\earth}$, which is consistent with prior modeling\nwork.\n", "  The paper presents the author view on spin-rooted properties of graphene\nsupported by numerous experimental and calculation evidences. Dirac fermions of\ncrystalline graphene and local spins of graphene molecules are suggested to\nmeet a strict demand - different orbitals for different spins- which leads to a\nlarge spectrum of effects caused by spin polarization of electronic states. The\nconsequent topological non-triviality, making graphene topological insulator,\nand local spins, imaging graphene chemical activity, are proposed to discuss\nsuch peculiar properties of graphene as high temperature ferromagnetism and\noutstanding chemical behavior. The connection of these new findings with\ndifficulties met at attempting to convert semimetal graphene into semiconductor\none is discussed.\n", "  We present a new version of the MURaM radiative MHD code that allows for\nsimulations spanning from the upper convection zone into the solar corona. We\nimplemented the relevant coronal physics in terms of optically thin radiative\nloss, field aligned heat conduction and an equilibrium ionization equation of\nstate. We artificially limit the coronal Alfv{\\'e}n and heat conduction speeds\nto computationally manageable values using an approximation to\nsemi-relativistic MHD with an artificially reduced speed of light (Boris\ncorrection). We present example solutions ranging from quiet to active Sun in\norder to verify the validity of our approach. We quantify the role of numerical\ndiffusivity for the effective coronal heating. We find that the (numerical)\nmagnetic Prandtl number determines the ratio of resistive to viscous heating\nand that owing to the very large magnetic Prandtl number of the solar corona,\nheating is expected to happen predominantly through viscous dissipation. We\nfind that reasonable solutions can be obtained with values of the reduced speed\nof light just marginally larger than the maximum sound speed. Overall this\nleads to a fully explicit code that can compute the time evolution of the solar\ncorona in response to photospheric driving using numerical time steps not much\nsmaller than $0.1$ seconds. Numerical simulations of the coronal response to\nflux emergence covering a time span of a few days are well within reach using\nthis approach.\n", "  A domain wall and spin supercurrent can coexist in magnets with easy-cone\nanisotropy owing to simultaneous spontaneous breaking of Z$_2$ and U(1)\nsymmetries. Their interaction is theoretically investigated in quasi\none-dimensional ferromagnets within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology.\nSpecifically, we show that spin supercurrent can exert the torque on a domain\nwall and thereby drive it. We also show, as a reciprocal phenomenon, a\nfield-induced motion of a domain wall can generate spin supercurrent.\n", "  We apply a new method \"force enhanced atomic refinement\" (FEAR) to create a\ncomputer model of amorphous silicon (a-Si), based upon the highly precise X-ray\ndiffraction experiments of Laaziri et al. The logic underlying our calculation\nis to estimate the structure of a real sample a-Si using experimental data and\nchemical information included in a non-biased way, starting from random\ncoordinates. The model is in close agreement with experiment and also sits at a\nsuitable minimum energy according to density functional calculations. In\nagreement with experiments, we find a small concentration of coordination\ndefects that we discuss, including their electronic consequences. The gap\nstates in the FEAR model are delocalized compared to a continuous random\nnetwork model. The method is more efficient and accurate, in the sense of\nfitting the diffraction data than conventional melt quench methods. We compute\nthe vibrational density of states and the specific heat, and find that both\ncompare favorably to experiments.\n", "  For the first time, we present an extensive study of stars with individual\nnon-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances for 17 chemical elements\nfrom Li to Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the $-2.62 \\le$\n[Fe/H] $\\le +0.24$ metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical\nevolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to trace\nthe Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new and improve earlier\nresults as follows. (i) The element-to-iron ratios for Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form\na MP plateau at a similar height of 0.3~dex, and the knee occurs at common\n[Fe/H] $\\simeq -0.8$. The knee at the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe],\nand the MP plateau is formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (ii) The upward trend of [C/O]\nwith decreasing metallicity exists at [Fe/H] $< -1.2$, supporting the earlier\nfinding of Akerman et al. (iii) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the\n[Fe/H] $< -1$ stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/Mg] $\\simeq -0.5$.\n(iv) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends, suggesting a\ncommon site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe abundance down to\n[Fe/H] $\\simeq -2.5$, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars. (vi) The comparisons of\nour results with some widely used Galactic evolution models are given. The use\nof the NLTE element abundances raises credit to the interpretation of the data\nin the context of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\n", "  We have studied the electrostatic screening effect of NaCl solutions on the\ninteractions between anionic lipid bilayers in the fluid lamellar phase using a\nPoisson-Boltzmann based mean-field approach with constant charge and constant\npotential limiting charge regulation boundary conditions. The full DLVO\npotential, including the electrostatic, hydration and van der Waals\ninteractions, was coupled to thermal bending fluctuations of the membranes via\na variational Gaussian Ansatz. This allowed us to analyze the coupling between\nthe osmotic pressure and the fluctuation amplitudes and compare them both\nsimultaneously with the measured dependence on the bilayer separation,\ndetermined by the small-angle X-ray scattering experiments. High-structural\nresolution analysis of the scattering data revealed no significant changes of\nmembrane structure as a function of salt concentration. Parsimonious\ndescription of our results is consistent with the constant charge limit of the\ngeneral charge regulation phenomenology, with fully dissociated lipid charge\ngroups, together with a four-fold reduction of the membranes' bending rigidity\nupon increasing NaCl concentration.\n", "  The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) under development by NASA is being\nplanned to collect a multi-meter boulder from a near-Earth asteroid (NEA), and\nto bring it to the cis-lunar space in the mid-2020's for future study and\nexploitation by a crewed mission. The MarcoPolo-M5 project is being proposed in\n2016 for the M5 mission opportunity by ESA, to bring back to Earth a sample\nfrom a very primitive D-type NEA.\n  We aim to further characterize the physical properties of two optimal targets\nfor sample return space missions, the low-DeltaV NEAs (341843) 2008 EV5 and\n(52381) 1993 HA. 2008 EV5 is the baseline target of ARM, but only one spectrum\nof this object exists in the literature. 1993 HA is a very favourable target\nfor a space mission based on its dynamical properties: here we intend to assess\nif it is a suitable target for MarcoPolo-M5.\n  We obtained visible spectroscopy of 2008 EV5 with the FORS2 instrument at\nESO-VLT, at different rotational phases. We also obtained visible and\nnear-infrared spectroscopy of 1993 HA, using the EFOSC2 and SOfI instruments at\nESO-NTT. Visible photometry of 1993 HA was carried out within the IMPACTON\nproject at the Observatorio Astronomico do Sertao de Itaparica (Brazil).\n  Our new observations are in agreement with the C-type classification of 2008\nEV5. We obtained five visible spectra which do not show any variability within\nthe limits of noise, suggesting a homogeneous surface. We obtained the first\never spectroscopic dataset for 1993 HA, finding a featureless, red-sloped\nbehaviour typical of D-types. We found that the synodic rotation period of 1993\nHA is 4.107+-0.002 h. The derived lightcurve also suggests an elongated shape\n(axis ratio a/b>=1.71). At this stage 1993 HA does indeed seem to be the most\nfavourable target for MarcoPolo-M5, though future observations are necessary to\nstudy it further.\n", "  We obtain a new equation of state for the nucleonic and hyperonic inner core\nof neutron stars that fulfills the 2$M_{\\odot}$ observations as well as the\nrecent determinations of stellar radii below 13 km. The nucleonic equation of\nstate is obtained from a new parametrization of the FSU2 relativistic\nmean-field functional that satisfies these latest astrophysical constraints\nand, at the same time, reproduces the properties of nuclear matter and finite\nnuclei while fulfilling the restrictions on high-density matter deduced from\nheavy-ion collisions. On the one hand, the equation of state of neutron star\nmatter is softened around saturation density, which increases the compactness\nof canonical neutron stars leading to stellar radii below 13 km. On the other\nhand, the equation of state is stiff enough at higher densities to fulfill the\n2$M_{\\odot}$ limit. By a slight modification of the parametrization, we also\nfind that the constraints of 2$M_{\\odot}$ neutron stars with radii around 13 km\nare satisfied when hyperons are considered. The inclusion of the high magnetic\nfields present in magnetars further stiffens the equation of state. Hyperonic\nmagnetars with magnetic fields in the surface of $ \\sim 10^{15}$ G and with\nvalues of $\\sim 10^{18}$ G in the interior can reach maximum masses of\n2$M_{\\odot}$ with radii in the 12-13 km range.\n", "  We review matter bounce scenarios where the matter content is dark matter and\ndark energy. These cosmologies predict a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum\nwith a slightly red tilt for scalar perturbations and a small tensor-to-scalar\nratio. Importantly, these models predict a positive running of the scalar\nindex, contrary to the predictions of the simplest inflationary and ekpyrotic\nmodels, and hence could potentially be falsified by future observations. We\nalso review how bouncing cosmological space-times can arise in theories where\neither the Einstein equations are modified or where matter fields that violate\nthe null energy condition are included.\n", "  We consider a real, massive scalar field on ${\\rm PAdS}_{d+1}$, the\nPoincar\\'e domain of the $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. We\nfirst determine all admissible boundary conditions that can be applied on the\nconformal boundary, noting that there exist instances where \"bound states\"\nsolutions are present. Then, we address the problem of constructing the\ntwo-point function for the ground state satisfying those boundary conditions,\nfinding ultimately an explicit closed form. In addition, we investigate the\nsingularities of the resulting two-point functions, showing that they are\nconsistent with the requirement of being of Hadamard form in every globally\nhyperbolic subregion of ${\\rm PAdS}_{d+1}$ and proposing a new definition of\nHadamard states which applies to ${\\rm PAdS}_{d+1}$.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the many-body localization phase transition in a\none-dimensional Ising spin chain with random long-range spin-spin interactions,\n$V_{ij}\\propto\\left|i-j\\right|^{-\\alpha}$, where the exponent of the\ninteraction range $\\alpha$ can be tuned from zero to infinitely large. By using\nexact diagonalization, we calculate the half-chain entanglement entropy and the\nenergy spectral statistics and use them to characterize the phase transition\ntowards the many-body localization phase at infinite temperature and at\nsufficiently large disorder strength. We perform finite-size scaling to extract\nthe critical disorder strength and the critical exponent of the divergent\nlocalization length. With increasing $\\alpha$, the critical exponent\nexperiences a sharp increase at about $\\alpha=1$ and then gradually decreases\nto a value found earlier in a disordered short-ranged interacting spin chain.\nFor $\\alpha<1$, we find that the system is mostly localized and the increase in\nthe disorder strength may drive a transition between two many-body localized\nphases. In contrast, for $\\alpha>1$, the transition is from a thermalized phase\nto the many-body localization phase. Our predictions could be experimentally\ntested with ion-trap quantum emulator with programmable random long-range\ninteractions, or with randomly distributed Rydberg atoms or polar molecules in\nlattices.\n", "  Coherent states in a projected Hilbert space have many useful properties.\nWhen there are conserved quantities, a representation of the entire Hilbert\nspace is not necessary. The same issue arises when conditional observations are\nmade with post-selected measurement results. In these cases, only a part of the\nHilbert space needs to be represented, and one can define this restriction by\nway of a projection operator. Here coherent state bases and normally-ordered\nphase-space representations are introduced for treating such projected Hilbert\nspaces, including existence theorems and dynamical equations. These techniques\nare very useful in studying novel optical or microwave integrated photonic\nquantum technologies, such as boson sampling or Josephson quantum computers. In\nthese cases states become strongly restricted due to inputs, nonlinearities or\nconditional measurements. This paper focuses on coherent phase states, which\nhave especially simple properties. Practical applications are reported on\ncalculating recurrences in anharmonic oscillators, the effects of arbitrary\nphase-noise on Schrodinger cat fringe visibility, and on boson sampling\ninterferometry for large numbers of modes.\n", "  If massive neutrinos are Dirac particles, the proposed PTOLEMY experiment\nwill hopefully be able to discover cosmic neutrino background via $\\nu^{}_e +\n{^3}{\\rm H} \\to {^3}{\\rm He} + e^-$ with a capture rate of $\\Gamma^{}_{\\rm D}\n\\approx 4~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. Recently, it has been pointed out that right-handed\ncomponents of Dirac neutrinos could also be copiously produced in the early\nUniverse and become an extra thermal or nonthermal ingredient of cosmic relic\nneutrinos, enhancing the capture rate to $\\Gamma^{}_{\\rm D} \\approx 5.1~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ or $\\Gamma^{}_{\\rm D} \\approx 6.1~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. In this work, we\ninvestigate the possibility to distinguish between thermal and nonthermal\nspectra of cosmic relic neutrinos by measuring the annual modulation of the\ncapture rate. For neutrino masses of $0.1~{\\rm eV}$, we have found the\namplitude of annual modulation in the standard case is ${\\cal M} \\approx\n0.05\\%$, which will be increased to $0.1\\%$ and $0.15\\%$ in the presence of\nadditional thermal and nonthermal right-handed neutrinos, respectively. The\nfuture detection of such a modulation will be helpful in understanding the\nMajorana or Dirac nature of massive neutrinos.\n", "  In solar-type stars, the attenuation of convective blueshift by stellar\nmagnetic activity dominates the RV variations over the low amplitude signal\ninduced by low mass planets. Models of stars that differ from the Sun will\nrequire a good knowledge of the attenuation of the convective blueshift to\nestimate its impact on the variations. It is therefore crucial to precisely\ndetermine not only the amplitude of the convective blueshift for different\ntypes of stars, but also the dependence of this convective blueshift on\nmagnetic activity, as these are key factors in our model producing the RV. We\nstudied a sample of main sequence stars with spectral types from G0 to K2 and\nfocused on their temporally averaged properties: the activity level and a\ncriterion allowing to characterise the amplitude of the convective blueshift.\nWe find the differential velocity shifts of spectral lines due to convection to\ndepend on the spectral type, the wavelength (this dependence is correlated with\nthe Teff and activity level), and on the activity level. This allows us to\nquantify the dependence of granulation properties on magnetic activity for\nstars other than the Sun. The attenuation factor of the convective blueshift\nappears to be constant over the considered range of spectral types. We derive a\nconvective blueshift which decreases towards lower temperatures, with a trend\nin close agreement with models for Teff lower than 5800 K, but with a\nsignificantly larger global amplitude. We finally compare the observed RV\nvariation amplitudes with those that could be derived from our convective\nblueshift using a simple law and find a general agreement on the amplitude. Our\nresults are consistent with previous results and provide, for the first time,\nan estimation of the convective blueshift as a function of Teff, magnetic\nactivity, and wavelength, over a large sample of G and K main sequence stars.\n", "  We develop a general phenomenology describing the interplay between coherent\nand incoherent dynamics in ferromagnetic insulators. Using the Onsager\nreciprocity and Neumann's principle, we derive expressions for the local\nthermomagnonic torques exerted by thermal magnons on the order-parameter\ndynamics and the reciprocal pumping processes, which are in close analogy to\nthe spin-transfer torque and spin pumping at metallic interfaces. Our formalism\nis applicable to general long-wavelength dynamics and, although here we\nexplicitly focus on ferromagnetic insulators possessing U(1) symmetry, our\napproach can be easily extended to other classes of magnetic materials. As an\nillustrative example, we apply our theory to investigate a domain wall floating\nover a spin superfluid, whose dynamics is triggered thermally at the system's\nedge. Our results demonstrate that the local pumping of coherent spin dynamics\nby a thermal magnon gas offers an alternative route - with no need for\nconducting components and thus devoid of Ohmic losses - for the control and\nmanipulation of topological solitons.\n", "  Scalar field self-force effects on a scalar charge orbiting a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole are investigated. The scalar wave equation is\nsolved analytically in a post-Newtonian framework, and the solution is used to\ncompute the self-field as well as the components of the self-force at the\nparticle's location up to 7.5 post-Newtonian order. The energy fluxes radiated\nto infinity and down the hole are also evaluated. Comparison with previous\nnumerical results in the Schwarzschild case shows a good agreement in both\nstrong-field and weak-field regimes.\n", "  We propose a one-loop radiative Majorana-type neutrino-mass matrix without\nany kind of additional symmetries by introducing two leptoquark-like bosons\nonly. In this scenario, we show that the anomaly appearing in the process $b\\to\ns\\ell\\bar\\ell$ can be explained without any conflicts against various\nconstraints such as lepton-flavor violations, flavor-changing neutral currents,\noblique parameters $\\Delta S,\\ \\Delta T$, and the Drell-Yan process. We make\nthe predictions for the flavor-violating lepton-pair production ($e\\mu$,\n$e\\tau$, and $\\mu\\tau$) at the LHC, as well as the cross sections for pair\nproduction of these leptoquark-like bosons.\n", "  We revisit the effect of the (Dirac) CP-violating phase on neutrino lepton\nnumber asymmetries in both mass- and flavor-basis. We found that, even if there\nare sizable effects on muon- and tau-neutrino asymmetries, the effect on the\nasymmetry of electron-neutrinos is at most similar to the upper bound set by\nBBN for initial neutrino degeneracy parameters smaller than order unity. We\nalso found that, for the asymmetries in mass-basis, the changes caused by\nCP-violation is of sub-\\% level which is unlikely to be accesible neither in\nthe current nor in the forthcoming experiments.\n", "  We present a general procedure for constructing exact black hole solutions\nwith electric or magnetic charges in General Relativity coupled to a nonlinear\nelectrodynamics. We obtain a variety of two-parameter family spherically\nsymmetric black hole solutions. In particular, the singularity at the central\nof the space-time can be cancelled in the parameters space and the black hole\nsolutions become regular everywhere in the space-time. We study the global\nproperties of the solutions and derive the first law of thermodynamics. We also\ngeneralize the procedure to include a cosmological constant and construct\nregular black hole solutions that are asymptotic to anti-de Sitter space-time.\n", "  The recent discovery of an Earth-like exoplanet around Proxima Centauri has\nshined a spot light on slowly rotating fully convective M-stars. When such\nstars rotate rapidly (period $\\lesssim 20$ days), they are known to generate\nvery high levels of activity that is powered by a magnetic field much stronger\nthan the solar magnetic field. Recent theoretical efforts are beginning to\nunderstand the dynamo process that generates such strong magnetic fields.\nHowever, the observational and theoretical landscape remains relatively\nuncharted for fully convective M-stars that rotate slowly. Here we present an\nanelastic dynamo simulation designed to mimic some of the physical\ncharacteristics of Proxima Centauri, a representative case for slowly rotating\nfully convective M-stars. The rotating convection spontaneously generates\ndifferential rotation in the convection zone which drives coherent magnetic\ncycles where the axisymmetric magnetic field repeatedly changes polarity at all\nlatitudes as time progress. The typical length of the `activity' cycle in the\nsimulation is about nine years, in good agreement with the recently proposed\nactivity cycle length of about seven years for Proxima Centauri. Comparing our\nresults with earlier work, we hypothesis that the dynamo mechanism undergoes a\nfundamental change in nature as fully convective stars spin down with age.\n", "  Using the Green Bank 100 m telescope and the Nobeyama 45 m telescope, we have\nobserved the rotational emission lines of the three 13C isotopic species of\nHC3N in the 3 and 7 mm bands toward the low-mass star-forming region L1527 in\norder to explore their anomalous 12C/13C ratios. The column densities of the\n13C isotopic species are derived from the intensities of the J = 5-4 lines\nobserved at high signal-to-noise ratios. The abundance ratios are determined to\nbe 1.00:1.01 +- 0.02:1.35 +- 0.03:86.4 +- 1.6 for\n[H13CCCN]:[HC13CCN]:[HCC13CN]:[HCCCN], where the errors represent one standard\ndeviation. The ratios are very similar to those reported for the starless\ncloud, Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 Cyanopolyyne Peak (TMC-1 CP). These ratios\ncannot be explained by thermal equilibrium, but likely reflect the production\npathways of this molecule. We have shown the equality of the abundances of\nH13CCCN and HC13CCN at a high-confidence level, which supports the production\npathways of HC3N via C2H2 and C2H2+. The average 12C/13C ratio for HC3N is 77\n+- 4, which may be only slightly higher than the elemental 12C/13C ratio.\nDilution of the 13C isotope in HC3N is not as significant as that in CCH or\nc-C3H2. We have also simultaneously observed the DCCCN and HCCC15N lines and\nderived the isotope ratios: [DCCCN]/[HCCCN] = 0.0370 +- 0.0007 and\n[HCCCN]/[HCCC15N] = 338 +- 12.\n", "  The hypothesis of the self-induced collapse of the inflaton wave function was\nproposed as responsible for the emergence of inhomogeneity and anisotropy at\nall scales. This proposal was studied within an almost de Sitter space-time\napproximation for the background, which led to a perfect scale-invariant power\nspectrum, and also for a quasi-de Sitter background, which allows to\ndistinguish departures from the standard approach due to the inclusion of the\ncollapse hypothesis. In this work we perform a Bayesian model comparison for\ntwo different choices of the self-induced collapse in a full quasi-de Sitter\nexpansion scenario. In particular, we analyze the possibility of detecting the\nimprint of these collapse schemes at low multipoles of the anisotropy\ntemperature power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) using the\nmost recent data provided by the Planck Collaboration. Our results show that\none of the two collapse schemes analyzed provides the same Bayesian evidence of\nthe minimal standard cosmological model $\\Lambda$CDM, while the other scenario\nis weakly disfavoured with respect to the standard cosmology.\n", "  We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy used\nto explore the formation and evolution of star clusters. We investigate in\nparticular the origin of the bimodality observed in the colour and metallicity\nof globular clusters, and the environmental evolution through cosmic times in\nthe form of tidal tensors. Our results self-consistently confirm previous\nfindings that the blue, metal-poor clusters form in satellite galaxies which\nare accreted onto the Milky Way, while the red, metal-rich clusters form mostly\nin situ or, to a lower extent in massive, self-enriched galaxies merging with\nthe Milky Way. By monitoring the tidal fields these populations experience, we\nfind that clusters formed in situ (generally centrally concentrated) feel\nsignificantly stronger tides than the accreted ones, both in the present-day,\nand when averaged over their entire life. Furthermore, we note that the tidal\nfield experienced by Milky Way clusters is significantly weaker in the past\nthan at present-day, confirming that it is unlikely that a power-law cluster\ninitial mass function like that of young massive clusters, is transformed into\nthe observed peaked distribution in the Milky Way with relaxation-driven\nevaporation in a tidal field.\n", "  Prediction of solar flares is an important task in solar physics. The\noccurrence of solar flares is highly dependent on the structure and the\ntopology of solar magnetic fields. A new method for predicting large (M and X\nclass) flares is presented, which uses machine learning methods applied to the\nZernike moments of magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) for a period of six\nyears from 2 June 2010 to 1 August 2016. Magnetic field images consisting of\nthe radial component of the magnetic field are converted to finite sets of\nZernike moments and fed to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Zernike\nmoments have the capability to elicit unique features from any 2-D image, which\nmay allow more accurate classification. The results indicate whether an\narbitrary active region has the potential to produce at least one large flare.\nWe show that the majority of large flares can be predicted within 48 hours\nbefore their occurrence, with only 10 false negatives out of 385 flaring active\nregion magnetograms, and 21 false positives out of 179 non-flaring active\nregion magnetograms. Our method may provide a useful tool for prediction of\nsolar flares which can be employed alongside other forecasting methods.\n", "  Transport and acceleration of charged particles in turbulent media is a topic\nof great interest in space physics and interstellar astrophysics. These\nprocesses are dominated by the scattering of particles off magnetic\nirregularities. The scattering process itself is usually described by\nsmall-angle scattering with the pitch-angle coefficient $D_{\\mu\\mu}$ playing a\nmajor role. Since the diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mu\\mu}$ can be determined\nanalytically only for the approximation of quasi-linear theory, the\ndetermination of this coefficient from numerical simulations has, therefore,\nbecome more important. So far these simulations yield particle tracks for\nsmall-scale scattering, which can then be interpreted using the running\ndiffusion coefficients. This method has a limited range of validity. This paper\npresents two new methods that allow for the calculation of the pitch-angle\ndiffusion coefficient from numerical simulations. These methods no longer\nanalyse particle trajectories, but the change of particle distribution\nfunctions. It is shown that they provide better resolved results and allow for\nthe analysis of strong turbulence. The application of these methods to Monte\nCarlo simulations of particle scattering and hybrid MHD-particle simulations is\npresented. Both analysis methods are able to recover the diffusion coefficients\nused as input for the Monte Carlo simulations and provide better results in MHD\nsimulations especially for stronger turbulence.\n", "  We study the inflation via logarithmic entropy-corrected holographic dark\nenergy LECHDE model with future event horizon, particle horizon and Hubble\nhorizon cut-offs, and compare the results with those of obtained in the study\nof inflation by holographic dark energy HDE model. In comparison, the spectrum\nof primordial scalar power spectrum in the LECHDE model becomes redder than the\nspectrum in HDE model. Moreover, the consistency with the observational data in\nLECHDE model of inflation, constrains the reheating temperature and Hubble\nparameter by one parameter of holographic dark energy and two new parameters of\nlogarithmic corrections.\n", "  We investigate dark matter in a constrained $E_6$ inspired supersymmetric\nmodel with an exact custodial symmetry and compare with the CMSSM. The\nbreakdown of $E_6$ leads to an additional $U(1)_N$ symmetry and a discrete\nmatter parity. The custodial and matter symmetries imply there are two stable\ndark matter candidates, though one may be extremely light and contribute\nnegligibly to the relic density. We demonstrate that a predominantly Higgsino,\nor mixed bino-Higgsino, neutralino can account for all of the relic abundance\nof dark matter, while fitting a 125 GeV SM-like Higgs and evading LHC limits on\nnew states. However we show that the recent LUX 2016 limit on direct detection\nplaces severe constraints on the mixed bino-Higgsino scenarios that explain all\nof the dark matter. Nonetheless we still reveal interesting scenarios where the\ngluino, neutralino and chargino are light and discoverable at the LHC, but the\nfull relic abundance is not accounted for. At the same time we also show that\nthere is a huge volume of parameter space, with a predominantly Higgsino dark\nmatter candidate that explains all the relic abundance, that will be\ndiscoverable with XENON1T. Finally we demonstrate that for the $E_6$ inspired\nmodel the exotic leptoquarks could still be light and within range of future\nLHC searches.\n", "  In the presence of strong density stratification, hydromagnetic turbulence\nattains qualitatively new properties: the formation of magnetic flux\nconcentrations. We review here the theoretical foundations of this mechanism in\nterms of what is now called the negative effective magnetic pressure\ninstability. We also present direct numerical simulations of forced turbulence\nin strongly stratified layers and discuss the qualitative and quantitative\nsimilarities with corresponding mean-field simulations. Finally, the relevance\nto sunspot formation is discussed.\n", "  Structures and magnetic properties of Fe16-xCoxN2 are studied using adaptive\ngenetic algorithm and first-principles calculations. We show that substituting\nFe by Co in Fe16N2 with Co/Fe ratio smaller than 1 can greatly improve the\nmagnetic anisotropy of the material. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy\nfrom first-principles calculations reaches 3.18 MJ/m3 (245.6 {\\mu}eV per metal\natom) for Fe12Co4N2, much larger than that of Fe16N2 and is one of the largest\namong the reported rare-earth free magnets. From our systematic crystal\nstructure searches, we show that there is a structure transition from\ntetragonal Fe16N2 to cubic Co16N2 in Fe16-xCoxN2 as the Co concentration\nincreases, which can be well explained by electron counting analysis. Different\nmagnetic properties between the Fe-rich (x < 8) and Co-rich (x > 8) Fe16-xCoxN2\nis closely related to the structural transition.\n", "  We study spectral and thermodynamic properties of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev\nmodel, a variant of the $k$-body embedded random ensembles studied for several\ndecades in the context of nuclear physics and quantum chaos. We show\nanalytically that the fourth and sixth order energy cumulants vanish in the\nlimit of large number of particles $N \\to \\infty$ which is consistent with a\nGaussian spectral density. However, for finite $N$, the tail of the average\nspectral density is well approximated by a semi-circle law. The specific heat\ncoefficient, determined numerically from the low temperature behavior of the\npartition function, is consistent with the value obtained by previous\nanalytical calculations. For energy scales of the order of the mean level\nspacing we show that level statistics are well described by random matrix\ntheory. Due to the underlying Clifford algebra of the model, the universality\nclass of the spectral correlations depends on $N$. For larger energy\nseparations we identify an energy scale that grows with $N$, reminiscent of the\nThouless energy in mesoscopic physics, where deviations from random matrix\ntheory are observed. Our results are a further confirmation that the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model is quantum chaotic for all time scales. According to\nrecent claims in the literature, this is an expected feature in field theories\nwith a gravity-dual.\n", "  We compute the boundary entropy for bond percolation on the square lattice in\nthe presence of a boundary loop weight, and prove explicit and exact\nexpressions on a strip and on a cylinder of size $L$. For the cylinder we\nprovide a rigorous asymptotic analysis which allows for the computation of\nfinite-size corrections to arbitrary order. For the strip we provide exact\nexpressions that have been verified using high-precision numerical analysis.\nOur rigorous and exact results corroborate an argument based on conformal field\ntheory, in particular concerning universal logarithmic corrections for the case\nof the strip due to the presence of corners in the geometry. We furthermore\nobserve a crossover at a special value of the boundary loop weight.\n", "  The Dirac equation in four time and four space dimensions (or\n(4+4)-dimensions) is considered. Step by step we show that such an equation\nadmits Majorana and Weyl solutions. In order to obtain the Majorana or Weyl\nspinors we used a method based on the construction of Clifford algebra in terms\nof 2x2-matrices. We argue that our approach can be useful in supergravity,\nsuperstrings and qubit theory.\n", "  Motivated by tremendous progress in neutrino oscillation experiments, we\nderive a new set of simple and compact formulas for three-flavor neutrino\noscillation probabilities in matter of a constant density. A useful definition\nof the $\\eta$-gauge neutrino mass-squared difference $\\Delta^{}_* \\equiv \\eta\n\\Delta^{}_{31} + (1-\\eta) \\Delta^{}_{32}$ is introduced, where $\\Delta^{}_{ji}\n\\equiv m^2_j - m^2_i$ for $ji = 21, 31, 32$ are the ordinary neutrino\nmass-squared differences and $0 \\leq \\eta \\leq 1$ is a real and positive\nparameter. Expanding neutrino oscillation probabilities in terms of $\\alpha\n\\equiv \\Delta^{}_{21}/\\Delta^{}_*$, we demonstrate that the analytical formulas\ncan be remarkably simplified for $\\eta = \\cos^2 \\theta^{}_{12}$, with\n$\\theta_{12}^{}$ being the solar mixing angle. As a by-product, the mapping\nfrom neutrino oscillation parameters in vacuum to their counterparts in matter\nis obtained at the order of ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2)$. Finally, we show that our\napproximate formulas are not only valid for an arbitrary neutrino energy and\nany baseline length, but also still maintaining a high level of accuracy.\n", "  Polarization leakage of foreground synchrotron emission is a critical issue\nin HI intensity mapping experiments. While the sought-after HI emission is\nunpolarized, polarized foregrounds such as Galactic and extragalactic\nsynchrotron radiation, if coupled with instrumental impurity, can mimic or\noverwhelm the HI signals. In this paper we present the methodology for\npolarization calibration at 700-900 MHz, applied on data obtained from the\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT). We use astrophysical sources, both polarized and\nunpolarized sources including quasars and pulsars, as calibrators to\ncharacterize the polarization leakage and control systematic effects in our GBT\nHI intensity mapping project. The resulting fractional errors on polarization\nmeasurements on boresight are well controlled to within 0.6%-0.8% of their\ntotal intensity. The polarized beam patterns are measured by performing spider\nscans across both polarized quasars and pulsars. A dominant Stokes I to V\nleakage feature and secondary features of Stokes I to Q and I to U leakages in\nthe 700-900 MHz frequency range are identified. These characterizations are\nimportant for separating foreground polarization leakage from the HI 21 cm\nsignal.\n", "  By using recent developments for the Langevin dynamics of spatially\nasymmetric systems, we routinely generalize the Onsager-Machlup fluctuation\ntheory of the second order in time. In this form, it becomes applicable to\nfluctuating variables, including hydrodynamic currents, in equilibrium as well\nas nonequilibrium steady states. From the solution of the obtained stochastic\nequations we derive an analytical expression for the time autocorrelation\nfunction of a general fluctuating quantity. This theoretical result is then\ntested in a study of a shear flow by molecular dynamics simulations. The\nproposed form of the time autocorrelation function yields an excellent fit to\nour computational data for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady states.\nUnlike the analogous result of the first-order Onsager-Machlup theory, our\nexpression correctly describes the short-time correlations. Its utility is\ndemonstrated in an application of the Green-Kubo formula for the transport\ncoefficient. Curiously, the normalized time autocorrelation function for the\nshear flow, which only depends on the deterministic part of the fluctuation\ndynamics, appears independent of the external shear force in the linear\nnonequilibrium regime.\n", "  We present the results of a set of N-body simulations aimed at exploring how\nthe process of mass segregation (as traced by the spatial distribution of blue\nstraggler stars, BSSs) is affected by the presence of a population of heavy\ndark remnants (as neutron stars and black holes). To this end, clusters\ncharacterized by different initial concentrations and different fractions of\ndark remnants have been modeled. We find that an increasing fraction of\nstellar-mass black holes significantly delays the mass segregation of BSSs and\nthe visible stellar component. In order to trace the evolution of BSS\nsegregation, we introduce a new parameter ($A^+$) that can be easily measured\nwhen the cumulative radial distribution of these stars and a reference\npopulation are available. Our simulations show that $A^+$ might also be used as\nan approximate indicator of the time remaining to the core collapse of the\nvisible component.\n", "  The total cross sections are important ingredients for the current and future\nneutrino oscillation experiments. We present measurements of the total\ncharged-current neutrino and antineutrino cross sections on scintillator (CH)\nin the NuMI low-energy beamline using an {\\em in situ} prediction of the shape\nof the flux as a function of neutrino energy from 2--50 GeV. This flux\nprediction takes advantage of the fact that neutrino and antineutrino\ninteractions with low nuclear recoil energy ($\\nu$) have a nearly constant\ncross section as a function of incident neutrino energy. This measurement is\nthe lowest energy application of the low-$\\nu$ flux technique, the first time\nit has been used in the NuMI antineutrino beam configuration, and demonstrates\nthat the technique is applicable to future neutrino beams operating at\nmulti-GeV energies. The cross section measurements presented are the most\nprecise measurements to date below 5 GeV.\n", "  We present the discovery of nine quasars at $z\\sim6$ identified in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. This completes our survey of $z\\sim6$\nquasars in the SDSS footprint. Our final sample consists of 52 quasars at\n$5.7<z\\le6.4$, including 29 quasars with $z_{\\rm AB}\\le20$ mag selected from\n11,240 deg$^2$ of the SDSS single-epoch imaging survey (the main survey), 10\nquasars with $20\\le z_{\\rm AB}\\le20.5$ selected from 4223 deg$^2$ of the SDSS\noverlap regions (regions with two or more imaging scans), and 13 quasars down\nto $z_{\\rm AB}\\approx22$ mag from the 277 deg$^2$ in Stripe 82. They span a\nwide luminosity range of $-29.0\\le M_{1450}\\le-24.5$. This well-defined sample\nis used to derive the quasar luminosity function (QLF) at $z\\sim6$. After\ncombining our SDSS sample with two faint ($M_{1450}\\ge-23$ mag) quasars from\nthe literature, we obtain the parameters for a double power-law fit to the QLF.\nThe bright-end slope $\\beta$ of the QLF is well constrained to be\n$\\beta=-2.8\\pm0.2$. Due to the small number of low-luminosity quasars, the\nfaint-end slope $\\alpha$ and the characteristic magnitude $M_{1450}^{\\ast}$ are\nless well constrained, with $\\alpha=-1.90_{-0.44}^{+0.58}$ and\n$M^{\\ast}=-25.2_{-3.8}^{+1.2}$ mag. The spatial density of luminous quasars,\nparametrized as $\\rho(M_{1450}<-26,z)=\\rho(z=6)\\,10^{k(z-6)}$, drops rapidly\nfrom $z\\sim5$ to 6, with $k=-0.72\\pm0.11$. Based on our fitted QLF and assuming\nan IGM clumping factor of $C=3$, we find that the observed quasar population\ncannot provide enough photons to ionize the $z\\sim6$ IGM at $\\sim90$\\%\nconfidence. Quasars may still provide a significant fraction of the required\nphotons, although much larger samples of faint quasars are needed for more\nstringent constraints on the quasar contribution to reionization.\n", "  We study the contribution of the first galaxies to the\nfar-infrared/sub-millimeter (FIR/sub-mm) extragalactic background light (EBL)\nby implementing an analytical model for dust emission. We explore different\ndust models, assuming different grain size distributions and chemical\ncompositions. According to our findings, observed re-radiated emission from\ndust in dwarf-size galaxies at $z \\sim 10$ would peak at a wavelength of $\\sim\n500 \\mu {\\rm m}$ with observed fluxes of $\\sim 10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$ nJy, which is\nbelow the capabilities of current observatories. In order to be detectable,\nmodel sources at these high redshifts should exhibit luminosities of $\\gtrsim\n10^{12} L_{\\odot}$, comparable to that of local ultra-luminous systems. The\nFIR/sub-mm EBL generated by primeval galaxies peaks at $\\sim 500 \\mu {\\rm m}$,\nwith an intensity ranging from $\\sim 10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3} {\\rm nW \\ m^{-2} \\\nsr^{-1}}$, depending on dust properties. These values are $\\sim 3 - 4$ orders\nof magnitude below the absolute measured cosmic background level, suggesting\nthat the first galaxies would not contribute significantly to the observed\nFIR/sub-mm EBL. Our model EBL exhibits a strong correlation with the\ndust-to-metal ratio, where we assume a fiducial value of $D = 0.005$,\nincreasing almost proportionally to it. Thus, measurements of the FIR/sub-mm\nEBL could provide constraints on the amount of dust in the early Universe. Even\nif the absolute signal from primeval dust emission may be undetectable, it\nmight still be possible to obtain information about it by exploring angular\nfluctuations at $\\sim 500 \\mu {\\rm m}$, close to the peak of dust emission from\nthe first galaxies.\n", "  We report a discovery of shocked gas from the supernova remnant (SNR)\nG357.7+0.3. Our millimeter and submillimeter observations reveal broad\nmolecular lines of CO(2-1), CO(3-2), CO(4-3), 13CO (2-1) and 13CO (3-2), HCO^+\nand HCN using HHSMT, Arizona 12-Meter Telescope, APEX and MOPRA Telescope. The\nwidths of the broad lines are 15-30 kms, and the detection of such broad lines\nis unambiguous, dynamic evidence showing that the SNR G357.7+0.3 is interacting\nwith molecular clouds. The broad lines appear in extended regions (>4.5'x5').\nWe also present detection of shocked H2 emission in mid-infrared but lacking\nionic lines using the Spitzer IRS observations to map a few arcmin area. The H2\nexcitation diagram shows a best-fit with a two-temperature LTE model with the\ntemperatures of ~200 and 660 K. We observed [C II] at 158um and high-J\nCO(11-10) with the GREAT on SOFIA. The GREAT spectrum of [C II], a 3 sigma\ndetection, shows a broad line profile with a width of 15.7 km/s that is similar\nto those of broad CO molecular lines. The line width of [C~II] implies that\nionic lines can come from a low-velocity C-shock. Comparison of H2 emission\nwith shock models shows that a combination of two C-shock models is favored\nover a combination of C- and J-shocks or a single shock. We estimate the CO\ndensity, column density, and temperature using a RADEX model. The best-fit\nmodel with n(H2) = 1.7x10^{4} cm^{-3}, N(CO) = 5.6x10^{16} cm^{-2}, and T = 75\nK can reproduce the observed millimeter CO brightnesses.\n", "  The magnetic field (B-field) of the starless dark cloud L1544 has been\nstudied using near-infrared (NIR) background starlight polarimetry (BSP) and\narchival data in order to characterize the properties of the plane-of-sky\nB-field. NIR linear polarization measurements of over 1,700 stars were obtained\nin the H-band and 201 of these were also measured in the K-band. The NIR BSP\nproperties are correlated with reddening, as traced using the RJCE (H-M)\nmethod, and with thermal dust emission from the L1544 cloud and envelope seen\nin Herschel maps. The NIR polarization position angles change at the location\nof the cloud and exhibit their lowest dispersion of position angles there,\noffering strong evidence that NIR polarization traces the plane-of-sky B-field\nof L1544. In this paper, the uniformity of the plane-of-sky B-field in the\nenvelope region of L1544 is quantitatively assessed. This allowed evaluating\nthe approach of assuming uniform field geometry when measuring relative\nmass-to-flux ratios in the cloud envelope and core based on averaging of the\nenvelope radio Zeeman observations, as in Crutcher et al. (2009). In L1544, the\nNIR BSP shows the envelope B-field to be significantly non-uniform and likely\nnot suitable for averaging Zeeman properties without treating intrinsic\nvariations. Deeper analyses of the NIR BSP and related data sets, including\nestimates of the B-field strength and testing how it varies with position and\ngas density, are the subjects of later papers in this series.\n", "  Penumbrae are the manifestation of magnetoconvection in highly inclined (to\nthe vertical direction) magnetic field. The penumbra of a sunspot tends to\nform, initially, along the arc of the umbra antipodal to the main region of\nflux emergence. The question of how highly inclined magnetic field can\nconcentrate along the antipodal curves of umbrae, at least initially, remains\nto be answered. Previous observational studies have suggested the existence of\nsome form of overlying magnetic canopy which acts as the progenitor for\npenumbrae. We propose that such overlying magnetic canopies are a consequence\nof how the magnetic field emerges into the atmosphere and are, therefore, part\nof the emerging region. We show, through simulations of twisted flux tube\nemergence, that canopies of highly inclined magnetic field form preferentially\nat the required locations above the photosphere.\n", "  The two-dimensional two-orbital Hubbard model is studied with the use of\nfinite-size cluster worldline quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. This model is\nwidely used for simulation of the band structure of FeAs clusters, which are\nstructure elements of Fe-based high-temperature superconductors. The choice of\na special basis set of hyper-sites allowed to take into account four-fermion\noperator terms and to overcome partly the sign problem. Spectral functions and\nthe density of states for various parameters of the model are obtained in the\nundoped and low-doped regimes. The correlated distortion of the spectral\ndensity with the change of doping is observed, and the applicability of the\n\"hard-band\" approximation in the doped regime is demonstrated. Profiles of the\nmomentum distribution are obtained for the first Brillouin zone; they have\npronounced jump near the Fermi level, which decreases with the growth of the\nstrength of the interaction. The invariance of the Fermi surface with respect\nto the strength of the interaction is testified. Nesting is found in the case\nof electron and hole doping. Fermi-liquid parameters of the model are derived.\nZ-factor grows sharply with the increasing the level of doping, and\nmonotonously decreases with the growth of the strength of the interaction.\nMoreover, electron-hole doping asymmetry of the Z-factor is revealed. The\nnon-Fermi liquid behaviour and the deviation from Luttinger theorem are\nobserved.\n", "  It is crucial to understand how the Milky Way, the galaxy we can study in the\nmost intimate detail, fits in amongst other galaxies. Key examples include the\nTully-Fisher relation (TFR) --- i.e., the tight correlation between luminosity\n($L$) and rotational velocity ($V_\\textrm{rot}$) --- and the 3-dimensional\nluminosity-velocity-radius ($LVR$) scaling relation. Several past studies have\ncharacterized the MW as a 1--1.5$\\sigma$ outlier to the TFR. This study\nreexamines such comparisons using new estimates of MW properties that are\nrobust to many of the systematic uncertainties that have been a problem in the\npast and are based on assumptions consistent with those used for other spiral\ngalaxies. Comparing to scaling relations derived from modern extragalactic\ndata, we find that our Galaxy's properties are in excellent agreement with TFRs\ndefined using any SDSS-filter absolute magnitude, stellar mass, or baryonic\nmass as the $L$ proxy. We next utilize disk scale length ($R_\\textrm{d}$)\nmeasurements to extend this investigation to the $LVR$ relation. Here we find\nthat our Galaxy lies farther from the relation than $\\sim$90\\% of other spiral\ngalaxies, yielding $\\sim$9.5$\\sigma$ evidence that it is unusually compact for\nits $L$ and $V_\\textrm{rot}$ (based on MW errors alone), a result that holds\nfor all of the $L$ proxies considered. The expected $R_\\textrm{d}$ for the MW\nfrom the $LVR$ relation is $\\sim$5 kpc, nearly twice as large as the observed\nvalue, with error estimates placing the two in tension at the $\\sim$1.4$\\sigma$\nlevel. The compact scale length of the Galactic disk could be related to other\nways in which the MW has been found to be anomalous.\n", "  The backside coronal mass ejection (CME) of 2012 July 23 had a short Sun to\nEarth shock transit time (18.5 hours). The associated solar energetic particle\n(SEP) event had a >10 MeV proton flux peaking at ~5000 pfu, and the energetic\nstorm particle (ESP) event was an order of magnitude larger, making it the most\nintense event in the space era at these energies. By a detailed analysis of the\nCME, shock, and SEP characteristics, we find that the July 23 event is\nconsistent with a high-energy SEP event (accelerating particles to GeV\nenergies). The time of maximum and fluence spectra in the range 10-100 MeV were\nvery hard, similar to those of ground level enhancement (GLE) events. We found\na hierarchical relationship between the CME initial speeds and the fluence\nspectral indices: CMEs with low initial speeds had SEP events with the softest\nspectra, while those with highest initial speeds had SEP events with the\nhardest spectra. CMEs attaining intermediate speeds result in moderately hard\nspectra. The July 23 event was in the group of hard-spectrum events. During the\nJuly 23 event, the shock speed (>2000 km s^-1), the initial acceleration (~1.70\nkm s^-2), and the shock formation height (~1.5 solar radii) were all typical of\nGLE events. The associated type II burst had emission components from metric to\nkilometric wavelengths suggesting a strong shock. These observation confirm\nthat the 2012 July 23 event is likely to be an extreme event in terms of the\nenergetic particles it accelerated.\n", "  Despite its prediction over two decades ago, the detection of faint,\nhigh-temperature (\"hot\") emission due to nanoflare heating in non-flaring\nactive region cores has proved challenging. Using an efficient two-fluid\nhydrodynamic model, this paper investigates the properties of the emission\nexpected from repeating nanoflares (a nanoflare train) of varying frequency as\nwell as the separate heating of electrons and ions. If the emission measure\ndistribution ($\\mathrm{EM}(T)$) peaks at $T = T_m$, we find that\n$\\mathrm{EM}(T_m)$ is independent of details of the nanoflare train, and\n$\\mathrm{EM}(T)$ above and below $T_m$ reflects different aspects of the\nheating. Below $T_m$ the main influence is the relationship of the waiting time\nbetween successive nanoflares to the nanoflare energy. Above $T_m$ power-law\nnanoflare distributions lead to an extensive plasma population not present in a\nmonoenergetic train. Furthermore, in some cases characteristic features are\npresent in $\\mathrm{EM}(T)$. Such details may be detectable given adequate\nspectral resolution and a good knowledge of the relevant atomic physics. In the\nabsence of such resolution we propose some metrics that can be used to infer\nthe presence of \"hot\" plasma.\n", "  We report on Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) observations of the pulsar wind\nnebula (PWN) associated with PSR B0355+54 (eight observations with a 395 ks\ntotal exposure, performed over an 8 month period). We investigated the spatial\nand spectral properties of the emission coincident with the pulsar, compact\nnebula (CN), and extended tail. We find that the CN morphology can be\ninterpreted in a way that suggests a small angle between the pulsar spin axis\nand our line-of-sight, as inferred from the radio data. On larger scales,\nemission from the 7' (2 pc) tail is clearly seen. We also found hints of two\nfaint extensions nearly orthogonal to the direction of the pulsar's proper\nmotion. The spectrum extracted at the pulsar position can be described with an\nabsorbed power-law + blackbody model. The nonthermal component can be\nattributed to magnetospheric emission, while the thermal component can be\nattributed to emission from either a hot spot (e.g., a polar cap) or the entire\nneutron star surface. Surprisingly, the spectrum of the tail shows only a\nslight hint of cooling with increasing distance from the pulsar. This implies\neither a low magnetic field with fast flow speed, or particle re-acceleration\nwithin the tail. We estimate physical properties of the PWN and compare the\nmorphologies of the CN and the extended tail with those of other bow shock PWNe\nobserved with long CXO exposures.\n", "  The processes that govern the evolution of dust and water (in the form of\nvapor or ice) in protoplanetary disks are intimately connected. We have\ndeveloped a model that simulates dust coagulation, dust dynamics (settling,\nturbulent mixing), vapor diffusion, and condensation/sublimation of volatiles\nonto grains in a vertical column of a protoplanetary disk. We employ the model\nto study how dust growth and dynamics influence the vertical distribution of\nwater vapor and water ice in the region just outside the radial snowline. Our\nmain finding is that coagulation (boosted by the enhanced stickiness of icy\ngrains) and the ensuing vertical settling of solids results in water vapor\nbeing depleted, but not totally removed, from the region above the snowline on\na timescale commensurate with the vertical turbulent mixing timescale.\nDepending on the strength of the turbulence and the temperature, the depletion\ncan reach factors of up to ${\\sim}50$ in the disk atmosphere. In our isothermal\ncolumn, this vapor depletion results in the vertical snowline moving closer to\nthe midplane (by up to 2 gas scale heights) and the gas-phase C/O ratio above\nthe vertical snowline increasing. Our findings illustrate the importance of\ndynamical effects and the need for understanding coevolutionary dynamics of gas\nand solids in planet-forming environments.\n", "  We investigate the potential for the LISA space-based interferometer to\ndetect the stochastic gravitational wave background produced from different\nmechanisms during inflation. Focusing on well-motivated scenarios, we study the\nresulting contributions from particle production during inflation, inflationary\nspectator fields with varying speed of sound, effective field theories of\ninflation with specific patterns of symmetry breaking and models leading to the\nformation of primordial black holes. The projected sensitivities of LISA are\nused in a model-independent way for various detector designs and\nconfigurations. We demonstrate that LISA is able to probe these well-motivated\ninflationary scenarios beyond the irreducible vacuum tensor modes expected from\nany inflationary background.\n", "  Thin films of perovskite oxides offer the possibility of combining emerging\nconcepts of strongly correlated electron phenomena and spin current in magnetic\ndevices. However, spin transport and magnetization dynamics in these complex\noxide materials are not well understood. Here, we experimentally quantify spin\ntransport parameters and magnetization damping in epitaxial perovskite\nferromagnet/paramagnet bilayers of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$/SrRuO$_3$\n(LSMO/SRO) by broadband ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy. From the SRO\nthickness dependence of Gilbert damping, we estimate a short spin diffusion\nlength of $\\lesssim$1 nm in SRO and an interfacial spin-mixing conductance\ncomparable to other ferromagnet/paramagnetic-metal bilayers. Moreover, we find\nthat anisotropic non-Gilbert damping due to two-magnon scattering also\nincreases with the addition of SRO. Our results demonstrate LSMO/SRO as a\nspin-source/spin-sink system that may be a foundation for examining\nspin-current transport in various perovskite heterostructures.\n", "  Prediction of the effects of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on Earth strongly\ndepends on knowledge of the interplanetary magnetic field southward component,\nBz. Predicting the strength and duration of Bz inside a CME with sufficient\naccuracy is currently impossible, which forms the so-called Bz problem. Here,\nwe provide a proof-of-concept of a new method for predicting the CME arrival\ntime, speed, Bz and the resulting Dst index at Earth based only on magnetic\nfield data, measured in situ in the inner heliosphere (< 1AU). On 2012 June\n12-16, three approximately Earthward-directed and interacting CMEs were\nobserved the by the STEREO imagers, and by Venus Express (VEX) in situ at 0.72\nAU, 6 degree away from the Sun Earth line. The CME kinematics are calculated\nusing the drag-based and WSA-Enlil models, constrained by the arrival time at\nVEX, resulting in the CME arrival time and speed at Earth. The CME magnetic\nfield strength is scaled with a power law from VEX to Wind. Our investigation\nshows promising results for the Dst forecast (predicted: -96 and -114 nT (from\n2 Dst models), observed: -71 nT), for the arrival speed (predicted: 531 +- 23\nkm s-1, observed: 488 +- 30 km s-1) and timing (6 +- 1 hours after actual\narrival time). The prediction lead time is 21 hours. The method may be applied\nto vector magnetic field data from a spacecraft at an artificial Lagrange point\nbetween the Sun and Earth, or to data taken by any spacecraft temporarily\ncrossing the Sun--Earth line.\n", "  We present a detailed modeling of the two broad bands observed at 6825 \\AA\\\nand 7082 \\AA\\ in Sanduleak's star, a controversial object in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. These bands are known to originate from Raman-scattering of O\nVI $\\lambda\\lambda$ 1032 and 1038 photons with atomic hydrogen and are only\nobserved in bona fide symbiotic stars. Our high-resolution spectrum obtained\nwith the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) spectrograph at the\nMagellan-Clay Telescope reveals, quite surprisingly, that the profiles of the\ntwo bands look very different: while the Raman 6825 \\AA\\ band shows a single\nbroad profile with a redward extended bump, the Raman 7082 \\AA\\ band exhibits a\ndistinct triple-peak profile. Our model suggests that the O VI emission nebula\ncan be decomposed into a red, blue and central emission regions from an\naccretion disk, a bipolar outflow and a further compact, optically thick\nregion. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations with the aim of fitting the\nobserved flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082) \\sim 4.5$, which indicate that the neutral\nregion in Sanduleak's star is characterized by the column density $N_{HI} \\sim\n1 \\times 10^{23} {\\rm\\ cm^{-2}}$.\n", "  Critical collapse of a spherically symmetric domain wall is investigated. The\ndomain wall is made of a minimally coupled scalar field with a double well\npotential. We consider a sequence of the initial data which describe a\nmomentarily static domain wall characterized by its initial radius. The time\nevolution is performed by a full general relativistic numerical code for\nspherically symmetric systems. In this paper, we use the maximal slice gauge\ncondition, in which spacelike time slices may penetrate the black hole horizon\ndifferently from other widely used procedures. In this paper, we consider two\nspecific shapes of the double well potential, and observe the Type II critical\nbehavior in both cases. The mass scaling, sub-critical curvature scaling, and\nthose fine structures are confirmed. The index of the scaling behavior agrees\nwith the massless scalar case.\n", "  We study the Einstein-SO(3)Yang-Mills-Higgs system with a negative\ncosmological constant, and find the monopole black hole solutions as well as\nthe trivial Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole. We discuss thermodynamical\nstability of the monopole black hole in an isolated system. We expect a phase\ntransition between those two black holes when the mass of a black hole\nincreases or decreases. The type of phase transition depends on the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ as well as the vacuum expectation value $v$ and\nthe coupling constant $\\lambda$ of the Higgs field. Fixing $\\lambda$ small, we\nfind there are two critical values of the cosmological constant $\\Lambda_{\\rm\ncr (1)}(v)$ and $\\Lambda_{\\rm cr(2)}(v)$, which depend on $v$. If $\\Lambda_{\\rm\ncr(1)}(v)<\\Lambda (<0)$, we find the first order transition, while if\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm cr(2)}(v)<\\Lambda<\\Lambda_{\\rm cr(1)}(v)$, the transition becomes\nsecond order. For the case of $\\Lambda_{b}(v)<\\Lambda<\\Lambda_{\\rm (2)}(v)$, we\nagain find the first order irreversible transition from the monopole black hole\nto the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole. Beyond $\\Lambda_{b}(v)$, no\nmonopole black hole exists. We also discuss thermodynamical properties of the\nmonopole black hole in a thermal bath system.\n", "  The nature of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares is poorly\nconstrained, and critically the general prevalence of such signals in solar\nflares is unknown. Therefore, we perform a large-scale search for evidence of\nsignals consistent with quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares, focusing on\nthe 1 - 300s timescale. We analyse 675 M- and X-class flares observed by GOES\nin 1-8\\AA\\ soft X-rays between 2011 February 1 and 2015 December 31.\nAdditionally, over the same era we analyse Fermi/GBM 15-25 keV X-ray data for\neach of these flares that was associated with a Fermi/GBM solar flare trigger,\na total of 261 events. Using a model comparison method, we determine whether\nthere is evidence for a substantial enhancement in the Fourier power spectrum\nthat may be consistent with a QPP signature, based on three tested models; a\npower-law plus a constant, a broken power-law plus constant, and a\npower-law-plus-constant with an additional QPP signature component. From this,\nwe determine that ~30% of GOES events and ~8% of Fermi/GBM events show strong\nsignatures consistent with classical interpretations of QPP. For the remaining\nevents either two or more tested models cannot be strongly distinguished from\neach other, or the events are well-described by single power-law or broken\npower-law Fourier power spectra. For both instruments, a preferred\ncharacteristic timescale of ~5-30 s was found in the QPP-like events, with no\ndependence on flare magnitude in either GOES or GBM data. We also show that\nindividual events in the sample show similar characteristic timescales in both\nGBM and GOES datasets. We discuss the implications of these results for our\nunderstanding of solar flares and possible QPP mechanisms.\n", "  Recently, it has been observed that the Noether-Gaillard-Zumino (NGZ)\nidentity holds order by order in $\\alpha'$ expansion in nonlinear\nelectrodynamics theories as Born-Infeld (BI) and Bossard-Nicolai (BN). The\nnonlinear electrodynamics theory that couples to an axion field is invariant\nunder the $SL(2,R)$ duality in all orders of $\\alpha'$ expansion in the\nEinstein frame. In this paper we show that there are the $SL(2,R)$ invariant\nforms of the energy momentum tensors of axion-nonlinear electrodynamics\ntheories in the Einstein frame. These $SL(2,R)$ invariant structures appear in\nthe energy momentum tensors of BI and BN theories at all orders of $\\alpha'$\nexpansion. The $SL(2,R)$ symmetry appears in the BI and BN Lagrangians as a\nmultiplication of Maxwell Lagrangian and a series of $SL(2,R)$ invariant\nstructures.\n", "  We study theoretically the effect of the giant resonance in Xe on the phase\ndifference between the consecutive high order resonantly-enhanced harmonics and\ncalculate the duration of the attosecond pulses produced by these harmonics.\nFor certain conditions resonantly-induced dephasing compensates the phase\ndifference which is intrinsic for the off-resonance harmonics. We find these\nconditions analytically and compare them with the numerical results. This\nharmonic synchronization allows attosecond pulse shortening in conjunction with\nthe resonance-induced intensity increase by more than an order of magnitude;\nthe latter enhancement relaxes the requirements for the UV filtering needed for\nthe attosecond pulse production. Using a two-color driving field allows further\nincrease of the intensity. In particular, a caustic-like feature in the\nharmonic spectrum leads to the generation efficiency growth up to two orders of\nmagnitude, however accompanied by an elongation of the XUV pulse.\n", "  A compact X-class flare on 2004-Feb-26 showed a concentrated source of hard\nX-rays at the tops of the flare's loops. This was analyzed in previous work\n(Longcope et al. 2010), and interpreted as plasma heated and compressed by slow\nmagnetosonic shocks generated during post-reconnection retraction of the flux.\nThat work used analytic expressions from a thin flux tube (TFT) model, which\nneglected many potentially important factors such as thermal conduction and\nchromospheric evaporation. Here we use a numerical solution of the TFT\nequations to produce a more comprehensive and accurate model of the same flare,\nincluding those effects previously omitted. These simulations corroborate the\nprior hypothesis that slow mode shocks persist well after the retraction has\nended, thus producing a compact, loop-top source instead of an elongated jet,\nas steady reconnection models predict. Thermal conduction leads to densities\nhigher than analytic estimates had predicted, and evaporation enhances the\ndensity still higher, but at lower temperatures. X-ray light curves and spectra\nare synthesized by convolving the results from a single TFT simulation with the\nrate at which flux is reconnected, as measured through motion of flare ribbons,\nfor example. These agree well with light curves observed by RHESSI and GOES and\nspectra from RHESSI. An image created from a superposition of TFT model runs\nresembles one produced from RHESSI observations. This suggests that the HXR\nloop-top source, at least the one observed in this flare, could be the result\nof slow magnetosonic shocks produced in fast reconnection models like\nPetschek's.\n", "  We present spectroscopic observations of the dust- and gas-enshrouded,\npolluted, single white dwarf star SDSSJ104341.53+085558.2 (hereafter\nSDSSJ1043+0855). Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph\nfar-ultraviolet spectra combined with deep Keck HIRES optical spectroscopy\nreveal the elements C, O, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni and enable useful\nlimits for Sc, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn in the photosphere of SDSSJ1043+0855. From\nthis suite of elements we determine that the parent body being accreted by\nSDSSJ1043+0855 is similar to the silicate Moon or the outer layers of Earth in\nthat it is rocky and iron-poor. Combining this with comparison to other heavily\npolluted white dwarf stars, we are able to identify the material being accreted\nby SDSSJ1043+0855 as likely to have come from the outermost layers of a\ndifferentiated object. Furthermore, we present evidence that some polluted\nwhite dwarfs (including SDSSJ1043+0855) allow us to examine the structure of\ndifferentiated extrasolar rocky bodies. Enhanced levels of carbon in the body\npolluting SDSSJ1043+0855 relative to the Earth-Moon system can be explained\nwith a model where a significant amount of the accreted rocky minerals took the\nform of carbonates; specifically, through this model the accreted material\ncould be up to 9% calcium-carbonate by mass.\n", "  We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively\nisolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf\nirregular galaxy. The three galaxies--but especially Leo A and Aquarius--share\nin common delayed star formation histories relative to many other isolated\ndwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We\nfound no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has\nrotating HI gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are\ndark matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from\n$4.4^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$ (SagDIG) to $9.6^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ (Aquarius). Leo A and\nSagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have\nhigher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were farther\nalong in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is\ninconsistent with a Closed or Leaky Box model of chemical evolution, suggesting\nthat the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star\nformation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three\ngalaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios at a given\n[Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which\nindicates more extended star formation histories than Sculptor, consistent with\nphotometrically derived star formation histories. Overall, the bulk kinematic\nand chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge\nsignificantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies.\n", "  We have performed a dense core survey toward the Infrared Dark Cloud\nG14.225-0.506 at 3 mm continuum emission with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). This survey covers the two hub-filament\nsystems with an angular resolution of $\\sim3$\\arcsec ($\\sim0.03$ pc). We\nidentified 48 dense cores. Twenty out of the 48 cores are protostellar due to\ntheir association with young stellar objects (YSOs) and/or X-ray point-sources,\nwhile the other 28 cores are likely prestellar and unrelated with known IR or\nX-ray emission. Using APEX 870 $\\mu$m continuum emission, we also identified\nthe 18 clumps hosting these cores. Through virial analysis using the ALMA\nN$_2$H$^+$ and VLA/Effelsberg NH$_3$ molecular line data, we found a decreasing\ntrend in the virial parameter with decreasing scales from filaments to clumps,\nand then to cores. The virial parameters of $0.1-1.3$ in cores, indicate that\ncores are likely undergoing dynamical collapse. The cumulative Core Mass\nFunction (CMF) for the prestellar cores candidates has a power law index of\n$\\alpha=1.6$, with masses ranging from 1.5 to 22 $M_\\odot$. We find no massive\nprestellar or protostellar cores. Previous studies suggest that massive O-tpye\nstars have not been produced yet in this region. Therefore, high-mass stars\nshould be formed in the prestellar cores by accreting a significant amount of\ngas from the surrounding medium. Another possibility is that low-mass YSOs\nbecome massive by accreting from their parent cores that are fed by filaments.\nThese two possibilities might be consistent with the scenario of global\nhierarchical collapse.\n", "  A study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and cosmic rays (CRs) using Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) data, in a region encompassing the nearby molecular\nclouds MBM 53, 54, and 55 and a far-infrared loop-like structure in Pegasus, is\nreported. By comparing Planck dust thermal emission model with Fermi-LAT\ngamma-ray data, it was found that neither the dust radiance (R) nor the dust\nopacity at 353 GHz (tau353) were proportional to the total gas column density\nN(Htot) primarily because N(Htot)/R and N(Htot)/tau353 depend on the dust\ntemperature (Td). The N(Htot) distribution was evaluated using gamma-ray data\nby assuming the regions of high Td} to be dominated by optically thin atomic\nhydrogen (HI) and by employing an empirical linear relation of N(Htot)/R to Td.\nIt was determined that the mass of the gas not traced by the 21-cm or 2.6-mm\nsurveys is ~25% of the mass of HI in the optically thin case and is larger than\nthe mass of the molecular gas traced by carbon monoxide by a factor of up to 5.\nThe measured gamma-ray emissivity spectrum is consistent with a model based on\nCR spectra measured at the Earth and the nuclear enhancement factor of <=1.5.\nIt is, however, lower than local HI emissivities reported by previous Fermi-LAT\nstudies employing different analysis methods and assumptions on ISM properties\nby 15%-20% in energies below a few GeV, even if we take account of the\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties. The origin of the discrepancy is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a multi-scale and multi-wavelength study to investigate the star\nformation process around IRAS 17599$-$2148 that is part of an elongated\nfilamentary structure (EFS) (extension $\\sim$21 pc) seen in the {\\it Herschel}\nmaps. Using the {\\it Herschel} data analysis, at least six massive clumps\n(M$_{clump}$ $\\sim$777 -- 7024 M$_{\\odot}$) are found in the EFS with a range\nof temperature and column density of $\\sim$16--39~K and\n$\\sim$0.6--11~$\\times$~10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{V}$ $\\sim$7--117 mag),\nrespectively. The EFS hosts cold gas regions (i.e. infrared dark cloud) without\nany radio detection and a bipolar nebula (BN) linked with the H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion IRAS 17599$-$2148, tracing two distinct environments inferred through\nthe temperature distribution and ionized emission. Based on virial analysis and\nhigher values of self-gravitating pressure, the clumps are found unstable\nagainst gravitational collapse. We find 474 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the\nselected region and $\\sim$72\\% of these YSOs are found in the clusters\ndistributed mainly toward the clumps in the EFS. These YSOs might have\nspontaneously formed due to processes not related to the expanding H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion. At the edges of BN, four additional clumps are also associated with\nYSOs clusters, which appear to be influenced by the expanding H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion. The most massive clump in the EFS contains two compact radio sources\ntraced in the GMRT 1.28 GHz map and a massive protostar candidate, IRS~1 prior\nto an ultracompact H\\,{\\sc ii} phase. Using the VLT/NACO near-infrared images,\nIRS~1 is resolved with a jet-like feature within a 4200~AU scale.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments we study the influence of thermal noise on\nthe phase slips in toroidal Bose-Einstein condensates with a rotating weak\nlink. We derive a generalized Arrhenius-like expression for the rate of\nstochastic phase slips. We develop a method to estimate the energy barrier\nseparating different superflow states. The parameters at which the energy\nbarrier disappears agree with the critical parameters for deterministic phase\nslips obtained from dynamics simulations, which confirms the validity of our\nenergetic analysis. We reveal that adding thermal noise lowers the phase-slip\nthreshold. However, the quantitative impact of the stochastic phase slips turns\nout to be too small to explain the significant discrepancy between theoretical\nand the experimental results.\n", "  We analyse high-quality NuSTAR observations of the local (z = 0.011) Seyfert\n2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) IC 3639, in conjunction with archival Suzaku\nand Chandra data. This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of\nthe source, spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray\nobservations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration\non the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray\nenergy coverage of NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing\nmodels, enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of\nthe source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an\nobscuring column in excess of $3.6\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, unconstrained at\nthe upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of\n$\\textrm{log}_{10}(L_{\\textrm{2-10 keV}} \\textrm{[erg s}^{-1}]) =\n43.4^{+0.6}_{-1.1}$ to 90% confidence, almost 400 times the observed flux, and\nconsistent with various multi-wavelength diagnostics. Such a high intrinsic to\nobserved flux ratio in addition to an Fe-K$\\alpha$ fluorescence line equivalent\nwidth exceeding 2 keV is extreme amongst known bona fide CTK AGN, which we\nsuggest are both due to the high level of obscuration present around IC 3639.\nOur study demonstrates that broadband spectroscopic modelling with NuSTAR\nenables large corrections for obscuration to be carried out robustly, and\nemphasises the need for improved modelling of AGN tori showing intense iron\nfluorescence.\n", "  [Methods]. We obtained high-precision radial velocities with HARPS on the ESO\n3.6 m telescope and determined precise stellar elemental abundances (~0.01 dex)\nusing MIKE spectra on the Magellan 6.5m telescope. [Results]. Our data indicate\nthe presence of a planet with a minimum mass of 26 Earth masses around the\nsolar twin HIP 68468. The planet is a super-Neptune, but unlike the distant\nNeptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major\naxis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus. The data also suggest the presence\nof a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 2.9 Earth masses at 0.03 AU; if the\nplanet is confirmed, it will be the fifth least massive radial velocity planet\ndiscovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin. Both\nisochrones (5.9 Gyr) and the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 Gyr) indicate an age\nof about 6 billion years. The star is enhanced in refractory elements when\ncompared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after\ncorrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance\nof 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age\nof HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log(R'HK) (-5.05) and\nlow jitter. Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the\nenhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. [Conclusions]. The\nsuper-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and\ntherefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration\nthat could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus\nthe abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing\nevidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the\nexistence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain\nthe nature of the planetary system around this unique star.\n", "  The present work reports results from systematic multiconfiguration\nDirac-Hartree-Fock calculations of electronic isotope shift factors for a set\nof transitions between low-lying states in neutral aluminium. These electronic\nquantities together with observed isotope shifts between different pairs of\nisotopes provide the changes in mean-square charge radii of the atomic nuclei.\nTwo computational approaches are adopted for the estimation of the mass- and\nfield shift factors. Within these approaches, different models for electron\ncorrelation are explored in a systematic way to determine a reliable\ncomputational strategy and estimate theoretical error bars of the isotope shift\nfactors.\n", "  Solar flares are the most powerful explosions occurring in the solar system,\nwhich may lead to disastrous space weather events and impact various aspects of\nour Earth. So far, it is still a big challenge in modern astrophysics to\nunderstand the origin of solar flares and predict their onset. Based on the\nanalysis of soft X-ray emission observed by the Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite (GOES), this work reported a new discovery of very\nlong-periodic pulsations occurred in the preflare phase before the onset of\nsolar flares (preflare-VLPs). These pulsations are typically with period of 8 -\n30 min and last for about 1 - 2 hours. They are possibly generated from LRC\noscillations of plasma loops where electric current dominates the physical\nprocess during magnetic energy accumulation in the source region. The\npreflare-VLP provides an essential information for understanding the triggering\nmechanism and origin of solar flares, and may help us to response to solar\nexplosions and the corresponding disastrous space weather events as a\nconvenient precursory indicator.\n", "  We use radial velocities from spectra of giants obtained with the WIYN\ntelescope, coupled with existing chemical abundance measurements of Na and O\nfor the same stars, to probe the presence of kinematic differences among the\nmultiple populations of the globular cluster (GC) M13. To characterise the\nkinematics of various chemical subsamples, we introduce a method using Bayesian\ninference along with an MCMC algorithm to fit a six-parameter kinematic model\n(including rotation) to these subsamples. We find that the so-called \"extreme\"\npopulation (Na-enhanced and extremely O-depleted) exhibits faster rotation\naround the centre of the cluster than the other cluster stars, in particular\nwhen compared to the dominant \"intermediate\" population (moderately Na-enhanced\nand O-depleted). The most likely difference between the rotational amplitude of\nthis extreme population and that of the intermediate population is found to be\n$\\sim$4 km s$^{-1}$, with a 98.4% probability that the rotational amplitude of\nthe extreme population is larger than that of the intermediate population. We\nargue that the observed difference in rotational amplitudes, obtained when\nsplitting subsamples according to their chemistry, is not a product of the\nlong-term dynamical evolution of the cluster, but more likely a surviving\nfeature imprinted early in the formation history of this GC and its multiple\npopulations. We also find an agreement (within uncertainties) in the inferred\nposition angle of the rotation axis of the different subpopulations considered.\nWe discuss the constraints that these results may place on various formation\nscenarios.\n", "  We report a study of the three-dimensional (3D) outflow structure of a\n15$\\arcsec$ $\\times$ 13$\\arcsec$ area around H$_{2}$ peak 1 in Orion KL with\nslit-scan observations (13 slits) using the Immersion Grating Infrared\nSpectrograph. The datacubes, with high velocity-resolution ($\\sim$ 7.5 {\\kms})\nprovide high contrast imaging within ultra-narrow bands, and enable the\ndetection of the main stream of the previously reported H$_{2}$ outflow\nfingers. We identified 31 distinct fingers in H$_{2}$ 1$-$0 S(1) $\\lambda$2.122\n$\\micron$ emission. The line profile at each finger shows multiple-velocity\npeaks with a strong low-velocity component around the systemic velocity at\n${\\VLSR}$ = $+$8 {\\kms} and high velocity emission ($|$${\\VLSR}$$|$ = 45$-$135\n{\\kms}) indicating a typical bow-shock. The observed radial velocity gradients\nof $\\sim$ 4 {\\kms} arcsec$^{-1}$ agree well with the velocities inferred from\nlarge-scale proper motions, where the projected motion is proportional to\ndistance from a common origin. We construct a conceptual 3D map of the fingers\nwith the estimated inclination angles of 57$\\degree$$-$74$\\degree$. The\nextinction difference ($\\Delta$$A_{\\rm v}$ $>$ 10 mag) between blueshifted and\nredshifted fingers indicates high internal extinction. The extinction, the\noverall angular spread and scale of the flow argue for an ambient medium with\nvery high density (10$^{5}$$-$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$), consistent with molecular\nline observations of the OMC core. The radial velocity gradients and the 3D\ndistributions of the fingers together support the hypothesis of simultaneous,\nradial explosion of the Orion KL outflow.\n", "  M-dwarfs are known to commonly host high-multiplicity planetary systems.\nTherefore M-dwarf planetary systems with a known transiting planet are expected\nto contain additional small planets ($r_p \\le 4$ R$_{\\oplus}$, $m_p \\lesssim\n20$ M$_{\\oplus}$) that are not seen in transit. In this study we investigate\nthe effort required to detect such planets using precision velocimetry around\nthe sizable subset of M-dwarfs which are slowly rotating ($P_{\\mathrm{rot}}\n\\gtrsim 40$ days) and hence more likely to be inactive. We focus on the test\ncase of GJ 1132. Specifically, we perform a suite of Monte-Carlo simulations of\nthe star's radial velocity signal featuring astrophysical contributions from\nstellar jitter due to rotationally modulated active regions and keplarian\nsignals from the known transiting planet and hypothetical additional planets\nnot seen in transit. We then compute the detection completeness of\nnon-transiting planets around GJ 1132 and consequently estimate the number of\nRV measurements required to detect those planets. We show that with 1 m\ns$^{-1}$ RV precision per measurement, only $\\sim 50$ measurements are required\nto achieve a 50\\% detection completeness to all non-transiting planets in the\nsystem and to planets which are potentially habitable. Throughout we advocate\nthe use of Gaussian process regression as an effective tool for mitigating the\neffects of stellar jitter including stars with high activity. Given that GJ\n1132 is representative of a large population of slowly rotating M-dwarfs, we\nconclude with a discussion of how our results may be extended to other systems\nwith known transiting planets such as those which will be discovered with TESS.\n", "  We investigate the role of radial migration history of stars in chemical\nevolution of a disk galaxy, in particular in understanding the origin of their\nbimodal distribution on the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. For this purpose, we\nexamine the three different models with no, continuous, and discontinuous\nradial migration, respectively. We find that for the model with radial\nmigration, the [alpha/Fe] ratios of stars in outer disk regions decrease more\nrapidly with time than the model without radial migration, because the\nassociated net transfer of intermediate and old disk stars from inner to outer\ndisk regions increases the rate of Type Ia relative to that of Type II\nsupernovae in the latter regions. Moreover, in the model assuming rapid and\ndiscontinuous radial migration, its effect on the stellar abundances at larger\nradii is significant enough to provide the large difference in the evolution of\nstars on the [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane between inner and outer disk regions. As a\nresult we obtain the bimodal distribution of disk stars on the\n[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane as observed in the Galactic stellar disk, thereby\nimplying that the event of discontinuous radial migration may play a key role\nin reproducing the observed bimodality of stars on this abundance-ratio\ndiagram. We discuss possible mechanisms causing such discontinuous radial\nmigration in the early evolution of the Galactic disk, including the event of\nminor merging of a relatively massive satellite onto the stellar disk.\n", "  The clathrate compound Ce3Pd20Si6 is a heavy-fermion metal that exhibits\nmagnetically hidden order at low temperatures. Reputedly, this exotic type of\nmagnetic ground state, known as \"phase II\", could be associated with the\nordering of Ce 4f quadrupolar moments. In contrast to conventional (dipolar)\norder, it has vanishing Bragg intensity in zero magnetic field and, as a\nresult, has escaped direct observation by neutron scattering until now. Here we\nreport the observation of diffuse magnetic neutron scattering induced by an\napplication of magnetic field along either the [110] or the [001] direction\nwithin phase II. The broad elastic magnetic signal that surrounds the (111)\nstructural Bragg peak can be attributed to a short-range G-type\nantiferromagnetic arrangement of field-induced dipoles modulated by the\nunderlying multipolar order on the simple-cubic sublattice of Ce ions occupying\nthe 8c Wyckoff site. In addition, for magnetic fields applied along the [001]\ndirection, the diffuse magnetic peaks in Ce3Pd20Si6 become incommensurate,\nsuggesting a more complex modulated structure of the underlying multipolar\norder that can be continuously tuned by a magnetic field.\n", "  Filamentary structures are ubiquitous in molecular clouds, and have been\nrecently argued to play an important role in regulating the size and mass of\nembedded clumps through fragmentation and mass accretion. Here, we reveal the\ndynamical state and fragmentation of filamentary molecular gas associated with\nthe Serpens South protocluster through analysis of wide (~4 x 4 pc)\nobservations of NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions with the Green Bank\nTelescope. Detailed modeling of the NH3 lines reveals that the kinematics of\nthe cluster and surrounding filaments are complex. We identify hierarchical\nstructure using a dendrogram analysis of the NH3 emission. The distance between\nneighbour structures that are embedded within the same parent structure is\ngenerally greater than expected from a spherical Jeans analysis, and is in\nbetter agreement with cylindrical fragmentation models. The NH3 line width-size\nrelation is flat, and average gas motions are sub- or trans-sonic over all\nphysical scales observed. Subsonic regions extend far beyond the typical 0.1 pc\nscale previously identified in star-forming cores. As a result, we find a\nstrong trend of decreasing virial parameter with increasing structure mass in\nSerpens South. Extremely low virial parameters on the largest scales probed by\nour data suggest that the previously observed, ordered magnetic field is\ninsufficient to support the region against collapse, in agreement with large\nradial infall motions previously measured toward some of the filaments. A more\ncomplex magnetic field configuration in the dense gas, however, may be able to\nsupport the filaments.\n", "  Understanding the diversity of planets requires to study the morphology and\nthe physical conditions in the protoplanetary disks in which they form. We\nobserved and spatially resolved the disk around the ~10 Myr old protoplanetary\ndisk HD 100453 in polarized scattered light with SPHERE/VLT at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of ~0.02\", and an\ninner working angle of ~0.09\". We detect polarized scattered light up to ~0.42\"\n(~48 au) and detect a cavity, a rim with azimuthal brightness variations at an\ninclination of 38 degrees, two shadows and two symmetric spiral arms. The\nspiral arms originate near the location of the shadows, close to the semi major\naxis. We detect a faint spiral-like feature in the SW that can be interpreted\nas the scattering surface of the bottom side of the disk, if the disk is\ntidally truncated by the M-dwarf companion currently seen at a projected\ndistance of ~119 au. We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for\nthe main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk\nmisaligned by ~72 degrees. The azimuthal brightness variations along the rim\nare well reproduced with the scattering phase function of the model. While\nspirals can be triggered by the tidal interaction with the companion, the close\nproximity of the spirals to the shadows suggests that the shadows could also\nplay a role. The change in stellar illumination along the rim, induces an\nazimuthal variation of the scale height that can contribute to the brightness\nvariations. Dark regions in polarized images of transition disks are now\ndetected in a handful of disks and often interpreted as shadows due to a\nmisaligned inner disk. The origin of such a misalignment in HD 100453, and of\nthe spirals, is unclear, and might be due to a yet-undetected massive companion\ninside the cavity, and on an inclined orbit.\n", "  Using a sample of nearly half million galaxies, intersected by over 7 million\nlines of sight from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12, we trace\nH$\\alpha$ + [N{\\small II}] emission from a galactocentric projected radius,\n$r_p$, of 5 kpc to more than 100 kpc. The emission flux surface brightness is\n$\\propto r_p^{-1.9 \\pm 0.4}$. We obtain consistent results using only the\nH$\\alpha$ or [N{\\small II}] flux. We measure a stronger signal for the bluer\nhalf of the target sample than for the redder half on small scales, $r_p <$ 20\nkpc. We obtain a $3\\sigma$ detection of H$\\alpha$ + [N{\\small II}] emission in\nthe 50 to 100 kpc $r_p$ bin. The mean emission flux within this bin is $(1.10\n\\pm 0.35) \\times 10^{-20}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$, which corresponds\nto $1.87 \\times 10^{-20}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ or 0.0033\nRayleigh. This detection is 34 times fainter than a previous strict limit\nobtained using deep narrow-band imaging. The faintness of the signal\ndemonstrates why it has been so difficult to trace recombination radiation out\nto large radii around galaxies. This signal, combined with published estimates\nof n$_{\\rm H}$, lead us to estimate the temperature of the gas to be 12,000 K,\nconsistent with independent empirical estimates based on metal ion absorption\nlines and expectations from numerical simulations.\n", "  We conducted systematic observations of the HI Br-alpha line (4.05 micron)\nand the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) feature (3.3 micron) in 50 nearby\n(z<0.3) ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with AKARI. The Br-alpha line\nis predicted to be the brightest among the HI lines under high dust-extinction\nconditions (A_V>15 mag). The Br-alpha line traces ionizing photons from OB\nstars and so is used as an indicator of star formation on the assumption of the\ninitial mass function. We detected the Br-alpha line in 33 ULIRGs. The\nluminosity of the line (L_BrA) correlates well with that of the 3.3 micron PAH\nemission (L_3.3). Thus we utilize L_3.3 as an indicator of star formation in\nfainter objects where the Br-alpha line is undetected. The mean L_BrA/L_IR\nratio in LINERs/Seyferts is significantly lower than that in HII galaxies. This\ndifference is reconfirmed with the L_3.3/L_IR ratio in the larger sample (46\ngalaxies). Using the ratios, we estimate that the contribution of starburst in\nLINERs/Seyferts is ~67%, and active galactic nuclei contribute to the remaining\n~33%. However, comparing the number of ionizing photons, Q_BrA, derived from\nL_BrA with that, Q_IR, expected from star formation rate required to explain\nL_IR, we find that the mean Q_BrA/Q_IR ratio is only 55.5+/-7.5% even in HII\ngalaxies which are thought to be energized by pure starburst. This deficit of\nionizing photons traced by the Br-alpha line is significant even taking heavy\ndust extinction into consideration. We propose that dust within HII regions\nabsorbs a significant fraction of ionizing photons.\n", "  Model-independent estimations for the spatial curvature not only provide a\ntest for the fundamental Copernican principle assumption, but also can\neffectively break the degeneracy between curvature and dark energy properties.\nIn this paper, we propose to achieve model-independent constraints on the\nspatial curvature from observations of standard candles and standard clocks,\nwithout assuming any fiducial cosmology and other priors. We find that, for the\npopular Union2.1 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia ) observations, the spatial\ncurvature is constrained to be $\\Omega_K=-0.045_{-0.172}^{+0.176}$. For the\nlatest joint light-curve analysis (JLA) of SNe Ia observations, we obtain\n$\\Omega_K=-0.140_{-0.158}^{+0.161}$. It is suggested that these results are in\nexcellent agreement with the spatially flat Universe. Moreover, compared to\nother approaches aiming for model-independent estimations of spatial curvature,\nthis method also achieves constraints with competitive precision.\n", "  We report the discovery of an extremely red planetary-mass companion to 2MASS\nJ22362452+4751425, a $\\approx$0.6 $M_{\\odot}$ late-K dwarf likely belonging to\nthe $\\sim$120 Myr AB Doradus moving group. 2M2236+4751 b was identified in\nmulti-epoch NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging at Keck Observatory at a separation\nof 3.7$\"$, or 230 $\\pm$ 20 AU in projection at the kinematic distance of 63\n$\\pm$ 5 pc to its host star. Assuming membership in the AB Dor group, as\nsuggested from its kinematics, the inferred mass of 2M2236+4751 b is 11-14\n$M_\\mathrm{Jup}$. Follow-up Keck/OSIRIS $K$-band spectroscopy of the companion\nreveals strong CO absorption similar to other faint red L dwarfs and lacks\nsigns of methane absorption despite having an effective temperature of\n$\\approx$900-1200 K. With a ($J$-$K$)$_\\mathrm{MKO}$ color of 2.69 $\\pm$ 0.12\nmag, the near-infrared slope of 2M2236+4751 b is redder than all of the HR 8799\nplanets and instead resembles the $\\approx$23 Myr isolated planetary-mass\nobject PSO J318.5-22, implying that similarly thick photospheric clouds can\npersist in the atmospheres of giant planets at ages beyond 100 Myr. In\nnear-infrared color-magnitude diagrams, 2M2236+4751 b is located at the tip of\nthe red L dwarf sequence and appears to define the \"elbow\" of the AB Dor\nsubstellar isochrone separating low-gravity L dwarfs from the cooler young T\ndwarf track. 2M2236+4751 b is the reddest substellar companion to a star and\nwill be a valuable benchmark to study the shared atmospheric properties of\nyoung low-mass brown dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets.\n", "  We revisit the filamentary structures of galaxies around the Virgo cluster,\nexploiting a larger dataset based on the HyperLeda database than previous\nstudies. In particular, this includes a large number of low-luminosity\ngalaxies, resulting in better sampled individual structures. We confirm seven\nknown structures in the distance range 4~$h^{-1}$~Mpc~$<$ SGY~$<$ 16~$h^{-1}$\nMpc, now identified as filaments, where SGY is the axis of the supergalactic\ncoordinate system roughly along the line of sight. The Hubble diagram of the\nfilament galaxies suggests they are infalling toward the main-body of the Virgo\ncluster. We propose that the collinear distribution of giant elliptical\ngalaxies along the fundamental axis of the Virgo cluster is smoothly connected\nto two of these filaments (Leo~II~A and B). Behind the Virgo cluster\n(16~$h^{-1}$~Mpc~$<$ SGY~$<$ 27~$h^{-1}$~Mpc), we also identify a new filament\nelongated toward the NGC 5353/4 group (\"NGC 5353/4 filament\") and confirm a\nsheet that includes galaxies from the W and M clouds of the Virgo cluster (\"W-M\nsheet\"). In the Hubble diagram, the NGC 5353/4 filament galaxies show infall\ntoward the NGC 5353/4 group, whereas the W-M sheet galaxies do not show hints\nof gravitational influence from the Virgo cluster. The filamentary structures\nidentified can now be used to better understand the generic role of filaments\nin the build-up of galaxy clusters at z~$\\approx$~0.\n", "  The elemental compositions of planets define their chemistry, and could\npotentially be used as beacons for their formation location if the elemental\ngas and grain ratios of planet birth environments, i.e. protoplanetary disks,\nare well understood. In disks, the ratios of volatile elements, such as C/O and\nN/O, are regulated by the abundance of the main C, N, O carriers, their ice\nbinding environment, and the presence of snowlines of major volatiles at\ndifferent distances from the central star. We explore the effects of disk\ndynamical processes, molecular compositions and abundances, and ice\ncompositions on the snowline locations of the main C, O and N carriers, and the\nC/N/O ratios in gas and dust throughout the disk. The gas-phase N/O ratio\nenhancement in the outer disk (exterior to the H2O snowline) exceeds the C/O\nratio enhancement for all reasonable volatile compositions. Ice compositions\nand disk dynamics individually change the snowline location of N2, the main\nnitrogen carrier, by a factor of 2-3, and when considered together the range of\npossible N2 snowline locations is ~11- ~79 AU in a standard disk model.\nObservations that anchor snowline locations at different stages of planet\nformation are therefore key to develop C/N/O ratios as a probe of planet\nformation zones.\n", "  All molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin, means of\nsustenance, and evolution of the turbulence remain debated. One possibility is\nthat stellar feedback injects enough energy into the cloud to drive observed\nmotions on parsec scales. Recent numerical studies of molecular clouds have\nfound that feedback from stars, such as protostellar outflows and winds,\ninjects energy and impacts turbulence. We expand upon these studies by\nanalyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including\nstellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field\nstrengths. We generate synthetic $^{12}$CO(1-0) maps assuming that the\nsimulations are at the distance of the nearby Perseus molecular cloud. By\ncomparing the outputs from different initial conditions and evolutionary times,\nwe identify differences in the synthetic observations and characterize these\nusing common astrostatistics. We quantify the different statistical responses\nusing a variety of metrics proposed in the literature. We find that multiple\nastrostatistics, including principal component analysis, the spectral\ncorrelation function and the velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive to\nchanges in stellar mass-loss rates and/or time evolution. A few statistics,\nincluding the Cramer statistic and velocity coordinate spectrum, are sensitive\nto the magnetic field strength. These findings demonstrate that stellar\nfeedback influences molecular cloud turbulence and can be identified and\nquantified observationally using such statistics.\n", "  A magnetic power spectral analysis is performed on 53 solar active regions,\nobserved from August 2011 to July 2012. Magnetic field data obtained from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager, inverted as Active Region Patches, are used\nto study the evolution of the magnetic power index as each region rotates\nacross the solar disk. Active regions are classified based on the number, and\nsizes, of solar flares they produce, in order to study the relationship between\nflare productivity and the magnetic power index. The choice of window size and\ninertial range plays a key role in determining the correct magnetic power\nindex. The overall distribution of magnetic power indices has a range of\n$1.0-2.5$. Flare-quiet regions peak at a value of 1.6, however flare-productive\nregions peak at a value of 2.2. Overall, the histogram of the distribution of\npower indices of flare-productive active regions is well separated from\nflare-quiet active regions. Only 12\\% of flare-quiet regions exhibit an index\ngreater than 2, whereas 90\\% of flare-productive regions exhibit an index\ngreater than 2. Flare-quiet regions exhibit a high temporal variance (i.e, the\nindex fluctuates between high and low values), whereas flare-productive regions\nmaintain an index greater than 2 for several days. This shows the importance of\nincluding the temporal evolution of active regions in flare prediction studies,\nand highlights the potential of a 2-3 day prediction window for space weather\napplications.\n", "  A recent survey toward the Milky Way bulge has discovered two sequences of RR\nLyrae stars on the period-amplitude diagram with a maximum period-shift of\n{\\Delta}log P = 0.015 between the two populations. Here we show, from our\nsynthetic horizontal-branch models, that this period-shift is most likely due\nto the small difference in helium abundance ({\\Delta}Y = 0.012) between the\nfirst and second-generation stars (G1 and G2), as is the case in our models for\nthe inner halo globular clusters with similar metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.1). We\nfurther show that the observed double red clump (RC) in the bulge is naturally\nreproduced when these models are extended to solar metallicity following\n{\\Delta}Y/{\\Delta}Z = 6 for G2, as would be expected from the chemical\nevolution models. Therefore, the two populations of RR Lyrae stars and the\ndouble RC observed in the bulge appear to be different manifestations of the\nsame multiple population phenomenon in the metal-poor and metal-rich regimes\nrespectively.\n", "  We report the detection of two CH$_3$OH lines (J$_K$ = 2$_K$-1$_K$ and\n3$_K$-2$_K$) between the progenitor's disks (\"Overlap\") of the mid-stage\nmerging galaxy VV 114 obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) Band 3 and Band 4. The detected CH$_3$OH emission show an extended\nfilamentary structure (~ 3 kpc) across the progenitor's disks with relatively\nlarge velocity width (FWZI ~ 150 km/s). The emission is only significant in the\n\"overlap\" and not detected in the two merging nuclei. Assuming optically-thin\nemission and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), we found the CH$_3$OH\ncolumn density relative to H$_2$ ($X_{\\rm CH_3OH}$) peaks at the \"Overlap\" (~ 8\n$\\times$ 10$^{-9}$), which is almost an order of magnitude larger than that at\nthe eastern nucleus. We suggest that kpc-scale shocks driven by galaxy-galaxy\ncollision may play an important role to enhance the CH$_3$OH abundance at the\n\"Overlap\". This scenario is consistent with that shock-induced large velocity\ndispersion components of ionized gas have been detected in optical wavelength\nat the same region. Conversely, low $X_{\\rm CH_3OH}$ at the nuclear regions\nmight be attributed to the strong photodissociation by nuclear starbursts\nand/or putative active galactic nucleus (AGN), or inefficient production of\nCH$_3$OH on dust grains due to initial high temperature conditions (i.e.,\ndesorption of the precursor molecule, CO, into gas-phase before forming\nCH$_3$OH on dust grains). These ALMA observations demonstrate that CH$_3$OH is\na unique tool to address kpc-scale shock-induced gas dynamics and star\nformation in merging galaxies.\n", "  Lyman-Alpha (Ly$\\alpha$) is the strongest emission line in the Universe and\nis frequently used to detect and study the most distant galaxies. Because Lya\nis a resonant line, photons typically scatter prior to escaping; this\nscattering process complicates the interpretation of Ly$\\alpha$ spectra, but\nalso encodes a wealth of information about the structure and kinematics of\nneutral gas in the galaxy. Modeling the Ly$\\alpha$ line therefore allows us to\nstudy tiny-scale features of the gas, even in the most distant galaxies.\nCuriously, observed Ly$\\alpha$ spectra can be modeled successfully with very\nsimple, homogeneous geometries (such as an expanding, spherical shell), whereas\nmore realistic, multiphase geometries often fail to reproduce the observed\nspectra. This seems paradoxical since the gas in galaxies is known to be\nmultiphase. In this Letter, we show that spectra emerging from extremely clumpy\ngeometries with many clouds along the line of sight converge to the predictions\nfrom simplified, homogeneous models. We suggest that this resolves the apparent\ndiscrepancy, and may provide a way to study the gas structure in galaxies on\nscales far smaller than can be probed in either cosmological simulations or\ndirect (i.e., spatially-resolved) observations.\n", "  The dwarf carbon (dC) star SDSS J112801.67+004034.6 has an unusually high\nradial velocity, 531$\\pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$. We present proper motion and new\nspectroscopic observations which imply a large Galactic rest frame velocity,\n425$\\pm 9$ km s$^{-1}$. Several other SDSS dC stars are also inferred to have\nvery high galactocentric velocities, again each based on both high heliocentric\nradial velocity and also confidently detected proper motions. Extreme\nvelocities and the presence of $C_2$ bands in the spectra of dwarf stars are\nboth rare. Passage near the Galactic center can accelerate stars to such\nextreme velocities, but the large orbital angular momentum of SDSS J1128\nprecludes this explanation. Ejection from a supernova in a binary system or\ndisruption of a binary by other stars are possibilities, particularly as dC\nstars are thought to obtain their photospheric $C_2$ via mass transfer from an\nevolved companion.\n", "  The galaxy formation process in the $\\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter scenario can\nbe constrained from the analysis of stars in the Milky Way's halo system. We\nexamine the variation of chemical abundances in distant halo stars observed by\nthe Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), as a function of\ndistance from the Galactic center ($r$) and iron abundance ([M/H]), in the\nrange 5 $\\lesssim r \\lesssim$ 30 kpc and $-2.5 <$ [M/H] $<$ 0.0. We perform a\nstatistical analysis of the abundance ratios derived by the APOGEE pipeline\n(ASPCAP) and distances calculated by several approaches. Our analysis reveals\nsignatures of a different chemical enrichment between the inner and outer\nregions of the halo, with a transition at about 15 kpc. The derived metallicity\ndistribution function exhibits two peaks, at [M/H] $\\sim -1.5$ and $\\sim -2.1$,\nconsistent with previously reported halo metallicity distributions. We obtain a\ndifference of $\\sim 0.1$ dex for $\\alpha$-element-to-iron ratios for stars at\n$r > 15$ kpc and [M/H] $> -1.1$ (larger in the case of O, Mg and S) with\nrespect to the nearest halo stars. This result confirms previous claims for\nlow-$\\alpha$ stars found at larger distances. Chemical differences in elements\nwith other nucleosynthetic origins (Ni, K, Na, and Al) are also detected. C and\nN do not provide reliable information about the interstellar medium from which\nstars formed because our sample comprises RGB and AGB stars and can experience\nmixing of material to their surfaces.\n", "  We present [CII] 158um measurements from over 15,000 resolved regions within\n54 nearby galaxies of the KINGFISH program to investigate the so-called [CII]\n\"line cooling deficit\" long known to occur in galaxies with different\nluminosities. The [CII]/TIR ratio ranges from above 1% to below 0.1% in the\nsample, with a mean value of 0.48+-0.21%. We find that the surface density of\n24um emission dominates this trend, with [CII]/TIR dropping as nuInu{24um}\nincreases. Deviations from this overall decline are correlated with changes in\nthe gas phase metal abundance, with higher metallicity associated with deeper\ndeficits at a fixed surface brightness. We supplement the local sample with\nresolved [CII] measurements from nearby luminous infrared galaxies and high\nredshift sources from z=1.8-6.4, and find that star formation rate density\ndrives a continuous trend of deepening [CII] deficit across six orders of\nmagnitude in SFRD. The tightness of this correlation suggests that an\napproximate star formation rate density can be estimated directly from global\nmeasurements of [CII]/TIR, and a relation is provided to do so. Several\nlow-luminosity AGN hosts in the sample show additional and significant central\nsuppression of [CII]/TIR, but these deficit enhancements occur not in those AGN\nwith the highest X-ray luminosities, but instead those with the highest central\nstarlight intensities. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the [CII]\ncooling line deficit in galaxies likely arises from local physical phenomena in\ninterstellar gas.\n", "  Recently Jin et al. (2016) reanalyzed the optical observation data of GRB\n050709 and reported a line-like spectral energy distribution (SED) component\nobserved by the Very Large Telescope at $t\\sim 2.5$ days after the trigger of\nthe burst, which had been interpreted as a broadened line signal arising from a\nmacronova dominated by iron group. In this work we show that an optical flare\norigin of such a peculiar optical SED is still possible. Interestingly, even in\nsuch a model, an \"unusual\" origin of the late-time long-lasting Hubble Space\nTelescope F814W-band emission is still needed and a macronova/kilonova is the\nnatural interpretation.\n", "  We evaluate the elliptic gluon Generalized Transverse Momentum\nDependent(GTMD) distribution inside a large nucleus using the\nMcLerran-Venugopalan model. We further show that this gluon distribution can be\nprobed through the angular correlation in virtual photon quasi-elastic\nscattering on a nucleus.\n", "  We study different incarnations of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation for the\nLocal Volume (LV) galaxies taken from Updated Nearby Galaxy Catalog. The UNGC\nsample contains 656 galaxies with $W_{50}$ HI-line-width estimates, mostly\nbelonging to low mass dwarfs. Of them, 296 objects have distances measured with\naccuracy better than 10%. For the sample of 331 LV galaxies having baryonic\nmasses $\\log M_{bar} > 5.8 \\log M_\\odot$ we obtain a relation $\\log M_{bar}=\n2.49 \\log W_{50} + 3.97$ with observed scatter of 0.38 dex. The largest factors\naffecting the scatter are observational errors in $K$-band magnitudes and\n$W_{50}$ line widths for the tiny dwarfs, as well as uncertainty of their\ninclinations. We find that accounting for the surface brightness of the LV\ngalaxies, or their gas fraction, or specific star formation rate, or the\nisolation index do not reduce essentially the observed scatter on the baryonic\nTF-diagram. We also notice that a sample of 71 dSph satellites of the Milky Way\nand M31 with known stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma^*$ tends to follow\nnearly the same bTF relation, having slightly lower masses than that of\nlate-type dwarfs.\n", "  There is an active debate about whether the properties of comets as observed\ntoday are primordial or, alternatively, if they are a result of collisional\nevolution or other processes. We investigate the effects of collisions on a\ncomet with a structure like 67P/C-G. We develop scaling laws for the critical\nspecific impact energies required for a significant shape alteration. These are\nthen used in simulations of the combined dynamical and collisional evolution of\ncomets in order to study the survival probability of a primordially formed\nobject with a shape like 67P/C-G. The effects of impacts on comet 67P/C-G are\nstudied using a SPH shock physics code. The resulting critical specific impact\nenergy defines a minimal projectile size which is used to compute the number of\nshape-changing collisions in a set of dynamical simulations. These simulations\nfollow the dispersion of the trans-Neptunian disk during the giant planet\ninstability, the formation of a scattered disk, and produce 87 objects that\npenetrate into the inner solar system with orbits consistent with the observed\nJFC population. The collisional evolution before the giant planet instability\nis not considered here. Hence, our study is conservative in its estimation of\nthe number of collisions. We find that in any scenario considered here, comet\n67P/C-G would have experienced a significant number of shape-changing\ncollisions, if it formed primordially. This is also the case for generic\nbi-lobe shapes. Our study also shows that impact heating is very localized and\nthat collisionally processed bodies can still have a high porosity. Our study\nindicates that the observed bi-lobe structure of comet 67P/C-G may not be\nprimordial, but might have originated in a rather recent event, possibly within\nthe last 1 Gy. This may be the case for any kilometer-sized two-component\ncometary nuclei.\n", "  The origin of the particular shape of a small body like comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G) is a topic of active research. How and when\nit acquired its peculiar characteristics has distinct implications on the\norigin of the solar system and its dynamics. We investigate how shapes like the\none of comet 67P/C-G can result from a new type of low-energy, sub-catastrophic\nimpacts involving elongated, rotating bodies. We focus on parameters\npotentially leading to bi-lobed structures. We also estimate the probability\nfor such structures to survive subsequent impacts. We use a smooth particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) shock physics code to model the impacts, the subsequent\nreaccumulation of material and the reconfiguration into a stable final shape.\nThe energy increase as well as the degree of compaction of the resulting bodies\nare tracked in the simulations. Our modelling results suggest that the\nformation of bi-lobed structures like 67P/C-G is a natural outcome of the low\nenergy, sub-catastrophic collisions considered here. Sub-catastrophic impacts\nhave the potential to alter the shape of a small body significantly, without\nleading to major heating or compaction. The currently observed shapes of\ncometary nuclei, such as 67P/C-G, maybe a result of such a last major shape\nforming impact.\n", "  We study the $D$-wave charmed baryons of $SU(3)$ flavor $\\mathbf{\\bar3}_F$\nusing the method of QCD sum rule in the framework of heavy quark effective\ntheory (HQET). We find that the $\\Lambda_c(2880)$, $\\Xi_c(3055)$ and\n$\\Xi_c(3080)$ can be well described by the $D$-wave $SU(3)$ $\\mathbf{\\bar 3}_F$\ncharmed baryon multiplets of $J^P=3/2^+$ and $5/2^+$, which contain two\n$\\lambda$-mode orbital excitations, i.e., the $\\Lambda_c(2880)$ has\n$J^P=5/2^+$, and the $\\Xi_c(3055)$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)$ have $J^P = 3/2^+$ and\n$5/2^+$, respectively. Our results also suggest that the $\\Lambda_c(2880)$ has\na partner state, the $\\Lambda_c(3/2^+)$ of $J^P=3/2^+$. Its mass is around\n$2.81 ^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$ GeV, and the mass difference between it and the\n$\\Lambda_c(2880)$ is $28^{+45}_{-24}$ MeV. We also evaluate the masses of their\nbottom partners.\n", "  The chemical abundances for five metal-poor stars in and towards the Galactic\nbulge have been determined from H-band infrared spectroscopy taken with the\nRAVEN multi-object adaptive optics science demonstrator and the IRCS\nspectrograph at the Subaru 8.2-m telescope. Three of these stars are in the\nGalactic bulge and have metallicities between -2.1 < [Fe/H] < -1.5, and high\n[alpha/Fe] ~+0.3, typical of Galactic disk and bulge stars in this metallicity\nrange; [Al/Fe] and [N/Fe] are also high, whereas [C/Fe] < +0.3. An examination\nof their orbits suggests that two of these stars may be confined to the\nGalactic bulge and one is a halo trespasser, though proper motion values used\nto calculate orbits are quite uncertain. An additional two stars in the\nglobular cluster M22 show [Fe/H] values consistent to within 1 sigma, although\none of these two stars has [Fe/H] = -2.01 +/- 0.09, which is on the low end for\nthis cluster. The [alpha/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] values differ by 2 sigma, with the\nmost metal-poor star showing significantly higher values for these elements.\nM22 is known to show element abundance variations, consistent with a\nmulti-population scenario (i.e. Marino et al. 2009, 2011; Alves-Brito et al.\n2012) though our results cannot discriminate this clearly given our abundance\nuncertainties. This is the first science demonstration of multi-object adaptive\noptics with high resolution infrared spectroscopy, and we also discuss the\nfeasibility of this technique for use in the upcoming era of 30-m class\ntelescope facilities.\n", "  X-ray behavior of the dwarf novae (DNe) outside the quiescent state has not\nbeen fully understood. We thus assembled 21 data sets of the 15 DNe observed by\nthe Suzaku satellite by the end of 2013, which include spectra taken during not\nonly the quiescence, but also the transitional, outburst, and super-outburst\nstates. Starting with the traditional cooling flow model to explain the X-ray\nemission from the boundary layer, we made several modifications to account for\nthe observed spectra. As a result, we found that the best-fit spectral model\ndepends strongly on the state of the DNe with only a few exceptions. Spectra in\nthe quiescent state are explained by the cooling flow model plus a Fe\nfluorescent line emission attenuated by an interstellar extinction. Spectra in\nthe transitional state require an additional partial covering extinction.\nSpectra in the outburst and super-outburst state require additional\nlow-temperature thin-thermal plasma component(s). Spectra in the super-outburst\nstate further require a high value of the minimum temperature of the boundary\nlayer. We present an interpretation on the required modifications to the\ncooling flow model for each state.\n", "  Parameters and abundances for 1002 stars of spectral types F, G, and K of\nluminosity class IV and V have been derived. After culling the sample for\nrotational velocity and effective temperature, 867 stars remain for discussion.\n  Twenty-eight elements are considered in the analysis. The {\\alpha},\niron-peak, and Period 5 transition metal abundances for these stars show a\nmodest enhancement over solar averaging about 0.05 dex. The lanthanides are\nmore abundant averaging about +0.2 dex over solar. The question is: Are these\nstars enhanced or is the Sun somewhat metal-poor relative to these stars? The\nconsistency of the abundances derived here argues for the latter view.\n  Lithium, carbon, and oxygen abundances have been derived. The stars show the\nusual lithium astration as a function of mass / temperature. There are more\nthan 100 planet-hosts in the sample, and there is no discernible difference in\ntheir lithium content relative to the remaining stars. The carbon and oxygen\nabundances show the well-known trend of decreasing [x/Fe] ratio with increasing\n[Fe/H].\n", "  The mechanism for triggering the universe inflation could be that at very\nearly periods the time variable was discrete instead of smooth. Alternatively,\nand perhaps equivalently, it could be the consequence that the metrics of the\nearly universe was a strongly concentrated gravitational coherent state with\nvery high frequency oscillations, allowing local pair creations by a\ngeneralisation to gravity of the Schwinger mechanism, perhaps by creation of\nblack holes of masses superior to the Planck scale. The lattice spacing between\ntwo clicks in the discrete time picture corresponds to the inverse frequency of\nthe gravitational coherent state in the other picture. In both cases, a much\nlower time than the Planck time might represent a new fundamental scale, giving\nnew type of physics. To make possible a concrete estimation of the pair\nproduction probability, we propose that the oscillating coherent state metrics\nthat defines this very early geometry minimises the Einstein gravity action\ncoupled to interacting 1-,2- and 3-forms. Part of our intuition relies on a\ncondensed matter analogy with laser-induced superconductivity. An independent\nsection suggests that the new physical time scale we introduce for the\nMarkovian discret time of the pre-inflation epoch can be identified with the\nstochastic time one uses for standard quantisation in the post-inflation limit.\nIn the pre-inflation phase its discreteness is the observable driving force for\nthe universe evolution, while in the post inflation phase it becomes\nunobservable and it can can effectively replaced by the continuous time\ncoordinate of standard quantum field theory.\n", "  We have developed a method for deriving the distribution of the Milky Way's\ninterstellar medium as a function of longitude, latitude, distance and\nline-of-sight velocity. This method takes as input maps of reddening as a\nfunction of longitude, latitude, and distance and maps of line emission as a\nfunction of longitude, latitude, and line-of-sight velocity. We have applied\nthis method to datasets covering much of the Galactic plane. The output of this\nmethod correctly reproduces the line-of-sight velocities of high-mass star\nforming regions with known distances from Reid et al. (2014) and qualitatively\nagrees with results from the Milky Way kinematics literature. These maps will\nbe useful for measuring flows of gas around the Milky Way's spiral arms and\ninto and out of giant molecular clouds.\n", "  We use a sample of Milky Way (MW) analogs for which we have stellar and disk\ngas mass measurements, published measurements of halo gas masses of the MW and\nof similar galaxies, and the well-established value of the cosmological baryon\nfraction to place a lower bound on the mass of the Galaxy of $7.7\\times10^{11}\nM_\\odot$ and estimate that the mass is likely to be $\\ge 1.2\\times10^{12}$\nM$_\\odot$. Although most dynamical analyses yield measurements consistent with\nthese results, several recent studies have advocated for a total mass well\nbelow $10^{12} M_\\odot$. We reject such low mass estimates because they imply a\nGalactic baryon matter fraction significantly above the universal value.\nConvergence between dynamical mass estimates and those based on the baryonic\nmass is an important milestone in our understanding of galaxies.\n", "  Blazars are variable emitters across all wavelengths over a wide range of\ntimescales, from months down to minutes. It is therefore essential to observe\nblazars simultaneously at different wavelengths, especially in the X-ray and\ngamma-ray bands, where the broadband spectral energy distributions usually\npeak.\n  In this work, we report on three \"target-of-opportunity\" (ToO) observations\nof Mrk 421, one of the brightest TeV blazars, triggered by a strong flaring\nevent at TeV energies in 2014. These observations feature long, continuous, and\nsimultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering X-ray and optical/ultraviolet\nbands) and VERITAS (covering TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous\nobservations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-LAT) and a number\nof radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant\nX-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in\nthe X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the\nsimultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time\ndelays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source\nproperties (e.g. the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the\nmagnetic field, and related timescales). The observed broadband spectra are\nconsistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We find that the\npower spectral density distribution at $\\gtrsim 4\\times 10^{-4}$ Hz from the\nX-ray data can be described by a power-law model with an index value between\n1.2 and 1.8, and do not find evidence for a steepening of the power spectral\nindex (often associated with a characteristic length scale) compared to the\npreviously reported values at lower frequencies.\n", "  We continue here the study of Lax integrable equations. We consider four\nthree-dimensional equations: (1) the rdDym equation $u_{ty} = u_x u_{xy} - u_y\nu_{xx}$, (2) the 3D Pavlov equation $u_{yy} = u_{tx} + u_y u_{xx} - u_x\nu_{xy}$; (3) the universal hierarchy equation $u_{yy} = u_t u_{xy} - u_y\nu_{tx}$, and (4) the modified Veronese web equation $u_{ty} = u_t u_{xy} - u_y\nu_{tx}$. For each equation, using the know Lax pairs and expanding the latter\nin formal series in spectral parameter, we construct two infinite-dimensional\ndifferential coverings and give a full description of nonlocal symmetry\nalgebras associated to these coverings. For all the for pairs of coverings, the\nobtained Lie algebras of symmetries manifest similar (but not the same)\nstructures: the are (semi) direct sums of the Witt algebra, the algebra of\nvector fields on the line, and loop algebras; all of them contain a component\nof finite grading. We also discuss actions of recursion operators on shadows\n(in the sense of [I.S.Krasil'shchik, A.M. Vinogradov, Acta Appl. Math., 15\n(1989) 1-2, 161--209.]) of nonlocal symmetries.\n", "  Non-standard neutrino-nucleon interaction is formulated and explored within\nthe energy range of quasi-elastic scattering. In particular, the study focuses\non the neutral-current elastic (anti)neutrino scattering off nucleons described\nby the exotic reactions $\\nu_\\alpha ({\\bar \\nu}_\\alpha) + n \\rightarrow\n\\nu_\\beta ({\\bar \\nu}_\\beta) + n $ and $ \\nu_\\alpha ({\\bar \\nu}_\\alpha) + p\n\\rightarrow \\nu_\\beta ({\\bar \\nu}_\\beta) + p$, which provide corrections to the\ndominant Standard Model processes. In this context, it is shown that the\nrequired exotic nucleon form factors may have a significant impact on the\nrelevant cross sections. Besides cross sections, the event rate is expected to\nbe rather sensitive to the magnitude of the lepton-flavour violating parameters\nresulting in an excess of events. The overlap of non-standard interactions and\nstrange quark contributions, in the region of few GeV neutrino energies, is\nalso examined. The formalism is applied for the case of the relevant\nneutrino-nucleon scattering experiments (LSND, MiniBooNE, etc.) and motivates\nthe notion that such facilities have high potential to probe NSI.\n", "  We present a simplified model of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) continuum\nemission designed for photoionization modeling. The new model {\\sc oxaf}\nreproduces the diversity of spectral shapes that arise in physically-based\nmodels. We identify and explain degeneracies in the effects of AGN parameters\non model spectral shapes, with a focus on the complete degeneracy between the\nblack hole mass and AGN luminosity. Our re-parametrized model {\\sc oxaf}\nremoves these degeneracies and accepts three parameters which directly describe\nthe output spectral shape: the energy of the peak of the accretion disk\nemission $E_\\mathrm{peak}$, the photon power-law index of the non-thermal\nemission $\\Gamma$, and the proportion of the total flux which is emitted in the\nnon-thermal component $p_\\mathrm{NT}$. The parameter $E_\\mathrm{peak}$ is\npresented as a function of the black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and `coronal\nradius' of the {\\sc optxagnf} model upon which {\\sc oxaf} is based. We show\nthat the soft X-ray excess does not significantly affect photoionization\nmodeling predictions of strong emission lines in Seyfert narrow-line regions.\nDespite its simplicity, {\\sc oxaf} accounts for opacity effects where the\naccretion disk is ionized because it inherits the `color correction' of {\\sc\noptxagnf}. We use a grid of {\\sc mappings} photoionization models with {\\sc\noxaf} ionizing spectra to demonstrate how predicted emission-line ratios on\nstandard optical diagnostic diagrams are sensitive to each of the three {\\sc\noxaf} parameters. The {\\sc oxaf} code is publicly available in the Astrophysics\nSource Code Library.\n", "  We characterize the non-sphericity of galaxy clusters by the projected axis\nratio of spatial distribution of star, dark matter, and X-ray surface\nbrightness (XSB). We select 40 simulated groups and clusters of galaxies with\nmass larger than 5E13 Msun from the Horizon simulation that fully incorporates\nthe relevant baryon physics, in particular, the AGN feedback. We find that the\nbaryonic physics around the central region of galaxy clusters significantly\naffects the non-sphericity of dark matter distribution even beyond the central\nregion, approximately up to the half of the virial radius. Therefore it is very\ndifficult to predict the the probability density function (PDF) of the\nprojected axis ratio of XSB from dark-matter only N-body simulations as\nattempted in previous studies. Indeed we find that the PDF derived from our\nsimulated clusters exhibits much better agreement with that from the observed\nX-ray clusters. This indicates that our present methodology to estimate the\nnon-sphericity directly from the Horizon simulation is useful and promising.\nFurther improvements in both numerical modeling and observational data will\nestablish the non-sphericity of clusters as a cosmological test complementary\nto more conventional statistics based on spherically averaged quantities.\n", "  Doppler imaging (DI) is a powerful spectroscopic inversion technique that\nenables conversion of a line profile time series into a two-dimensional map of\nthe stellar surface inhomogeneities. In this paper we investigate the accuracy\nof chemical abundance DI of Ap/Bp stars and assess the impact of several\ndifferent systematic errors on the reconstructed spot maps. We simulate\nspectroscopic observational data for different spot distributions in the\npresence of a moderately strong dipolar magnetic field. We then reconstruct\nchemical maps using different sets of spectral lines and making different\nassumptions about line formation in the inversion calculations. Our numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that a modern DI code successfully recovers the input\nchemical spot distributions comprised of multiple circular spots at different\nlatitudes or an element overabundance belt at the magnetic equator. For the\noptimal reconstruction the average reconstruction errors do not exceed ~0.10\ndex. The errors increase to about 0.15 dex when abundance distributions are\nrecovered from a few and/or blended spectral lines. Ignoring a 2.5 kG dipolar\nmagnetic field in chemical abundance DI leads to an average relative error of\n0.2 dex and maximum errors of 0.3 dex. Similar errors are encountered if a DI\ninversion is carried out neglecting a non-uniform continuum brightness\ndistribution and variation of the local atmospheric structure. This series of\nnumerical DI simulations proves that inversions with simplifying assumptions of\nthe non-magnetic radiative transfer and a single model atmosphere are generally\nreliable. We assess magnetic field strengths of several dozen Ap/Bp stars\npreviously studied with DI methods, concluding that the vast majority of the\npublished chemical spot maps are unaffected by the systematic errors addressed\nin this paper. (Abridged)\n", "  We make an inventory of the interstellar medium material in three\nlow-metallicity dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group (NGC147, NGC185\nand NGC205). Ancillary HI, CO, Spitzer IRS spectra, H{\\alpha} and X-ray\nobservations are combined to trace the atomic, cold and warm molecular, ionised\nand hot gas phases. We present new Nobeyama CO(1-0) observations and Herschel\nSPIRE FTS [CI] observations of NGC205 to revise its molecular gas content.\n  We derive total gas masses of M_gas = 1.9-5.5x10^5 Msun for NGC185 and M_gas\n= 8.6-25.0x10^5 Msun for NGC205. Non-detections combine to an upper limit on\nthe gas mass of M_gas =< 0.3-2.2x10^5 Msun for NGC147. The observed gas\nreservoirs are significantly lower compared to the expected gas masses based on\na simple closed-box model that accounts for the gas mass returned by planetary\nnebulae and supernovae. The gas-to-dust mass ratios GDR~37-107 and GDR~48-139\nare also considerably lower compared to the expected GDR~370 and GDR~520 for\nthe low metal abundances in NGC 185 (0.36 Zsun) and NGC205 (0.25 Zsun),\nrespectively.\n  To simultaneously account for the gas deficiency and low gas-to-dust ratios,\nwe require an efficient removal of a large gas fraction and a longer dust\nsurvival time (~1.6 Gyr). We believe that efficient galactic winds (combined\nwith heating of gas to sufficiently high temperatures in order for it to escape\nfrom the galaxy) and/or environmental interactions with neighbouring galaxies\nare responsible for the gas removal from NGC147, NGC185 and NGC205.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate\nbeyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and\ntheir propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as\ncosmological probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure\n266.5+-0.1 pc cm^-3), exceptionally intense (120+-30 Jy), linearly polarized,\nscintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 arcmin^2. Based\non a low Faraday rotation (12.0+-0.7 rad m^-2), we infer negligible\nmagnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of\nthe cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nG, parallel to the line-of-sight.\nThe burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic\nmedium.\n", "  In 1859, Le Verrier discovered the Mercury perihelion advance anomaly. This\nanomaly turned out to be the first relativistic-gravity effect observed. During\nthe 157 years to 2016, the precisions and accuracies of laboratory and space\nexperiments, and of astrophysical and cosmological observations on relativistic\ngravity have been improved by 3-4 orders of magnitude. The improvements have\nbeen mainly from optical observations at first followed by radio observations.\nThe achievements for the past 50 years are from radio Doppler tracking and\nradio ranging together with lunar laser ranging. At the present, the radio\nobservations and lunar laser ranging experiments are similar in the accuracy of\ntesting relativistic gravity. We review and summarize the present status of\nsolar-system tests of relativistic gravity. With planetary laser ranging,\nspacecraft laser ranging and interferometric laser ranging (laser Doppler\nranging) together with the development of drag-free technology, the optical\nobservations will improve the accuracies by another 3-4 orders of magnitude in\nboth the equivalence principle tests and solar-system dynamics tests of\nrelativistic gravity. Clock tests and atomic interferometry tests of\nrelativistic gravity will reach an ever-increasing precision. These will give\ncrucial clues in both experimental and theoretical aspects of gravity, and may\nlead to answers to some profound issues in gravity and cosmology.\n", "  Twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the X-ray\npower-density spectra of several accreting low-mass neutron star (NS) binaries.\nIn our previous work we have considered several QPO models. We have identified\nand explored mass-angular-momentum relations implied by individual QPO models\nfor the atoll source 4U 1636-53. In this paper we extend our study and confront\nQPO models with various NS equations of state (EoS). We start with simplified\ncalculations assuming Kerr background geometry and then present results of\ndetailed calculations considering the influence of NS quadrupole moment\n(related to rotationally induced NS oblateness) assuming Hartle-Thorne\nspacetimes. We show that the application of concrete EoS together with a\nparticular QPO model yields a specific mass-angular-momentum relation. However,\nwe demonstrate that the degeneracy in mass and angular momentum can be removed\nwhen the NS spin frequency inferred from the X-ray burst observations is\nconsidered. We inspect a large set of EoS and discuss their compatibility with\nthe considered QPO models. We conclude that when the NS spin frequency in 4U\n1636-53 is close to 580Hz we can exclude 51 from 90 of the considered\ncombinations of EoS and QPO models. We also discuss additional restrictions\nthat may exclude even more combinations. Namely, there are 13 EOS compatible\nwith the observed twin peak QPOs and the relativistic precession model.\nHowever, when considering the low frequency QPOs and Lense-Thirring precession,\nonly 5 EOS are compatible with the model.\n", "  A catalog of 8472 white dwarf (WD) candidates is presented, selected using\nreduced proper motions from the deep proper motion catalog of Munn et al. 2014.\nCandidates are selected in the magnitude range 16 < r < 21.5 over 980 square\ndegrees, and 16 < r < 21.3 over an additional 1276 square degrees, within the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging footprint. Distances, bolometric\nluminosities, and atmospheric compositions are derived by fitting SDSS ugriz\nphotometry to pure hydrogen and helium model atmospheres (assuming surface\ngravities log g = 8). The disk white dwarf luminosity function (WDLF) is\nconstructed using a sample of 2839 stars with 5.5 < M_bol < 17, with\nstatistically significant numbers of stars cooler than the turnover in the\nluminosity function. The WDLF for the halo is also constructed, using a sample\nof 135 halo WDs with 5 < M_bol < 16. We find space densities of disk and halo\nWDs in the solar neighborhood of 5.5 +- 0.1 x 10^-3 pc^-3 and 3.5 +- 0.7 x\n10^-5 pc^-3, respectively. We resolve the bump in the disk WDLF due to the\nonset of fully convective envelopes in WDs, and see indications of it in the\nhalo WDLF as well.\n", "  The absorption of TeV $\\gamma$-ray photons produced in relativistic jets by\nsurrounding soft photon fields is a long-standing problem of jet physics. In\nsome cases the most likely emission site close to the central black hole is\nruled out because of the high opacity caused by strong optical and infrared\nphoton sources, such as the broad line region. Mostly neglected for jet\nmodeling is the absorption of $\\gamma$-rays in the starlight photon field of\nthe host galaxy. Analyzing the absorption for arbitrary locations and\nobservation angles of the $\\gamma$-ray emission site within the host galaxy we\nfind that the distance to the galaxy center, the observation angle, and the\ndistribution of starlight in the galaxy are crucial for the amount of\nabsorption. We derive the absorption value for a sample of $20$ TeV detected\nblazars with a redshift $z_r<0.2$. The absorption value of the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission located in the galaxy center may be as high as $20\\%$ with an average\nvalue of $6\\%$. This is important in order to determine the intrinsic blazar\nparameters. We see no significant trends in our sample between the degree of\nabsorption and host properties, such as starlight emissivity, galactic size,\nhalf-light radius, and redshift. While the uncertainty of the spectral\nproperties of the extragalactic background light exceeds the effect of\nabsorption by stellar light from the host galaxy in distant objects, the latter\nis a dominant effect in nearby sources. It may also be revealed in a\ndifferential comparison of sources with similar redshifts.\n", "  We present a study of the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon in the 2016\napparition using the STEREO spacecraft and compare the results with data from\nthe previous two perihelia in 2009 and 2012. Once again, Phaethon brightened by\n$\\sim$2 mag soon after its perihelion passage, contradicting expectations from\nthe phase function of a macroscopic monolithic body. Subsequently, a short\nantisolar tail of $\\sim$0{\\deg}.1 in length was formed within $\\sim$1 day and\nquickly disappeared. No trail was seen. Our syndyne-synchrone analysis\nindicates that the tail was comprised of submicron to micron particles and can\nbe approximated by a synchrone coinciding with the outburst. We estimate that\nthe outburst has released a mass of $\\sim$10$^{4}$--10$^{5}$ kg, comparable to\nthe two mass ejections in 2009 and 2012, and that the average mass-loss rate is\n$\\sim$0.1--1 kg s$^{-1}$. The forward-scattering effect hinted at low level\nactivity of Phaethon prior to the outburst, which increased the effective cross\nsection by merely $\\lesssim$1 km$^2$. Without the forward-scattering\nenhancement, detecting such activity at side-scattering phase angles is very\ndifficult. The forward-scattering effect also reinforces that the ejected dust\ngrains rather than gas emissions were responsible for the activity of Phaethon.\nDespite Phaethon's reactivation, it is highly unlikely that the Geminid\nmeteoroid stream can be sustained by similar perihelion mass-loss events.\n", "  We present a general surface brightness correction method for compact\nextended sources imaged in the slow-scan pointed observation mode of the\nFar-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) aboard the AKARI Infrared Astronomical Satellite.\nOur method recovers correct surface brightness distribution maps by re-scaling\narchived raw FIS maps using the surface-brightness-dependent inverse FIS\nresponse function. The flux of a target source is then automatically corrected\nfor as the simple sum of surface brightnesses within the adopted contour\nencircling the perimeter of the target (i.e., contour photometry). This\ncorrection method is contrasted to the previous aperture photometry method for\npoint sources, which directly corrects for the target flux with a\nflux-dependent scaling law. The new surface brightness correction scheme is\napplicable to objects of any shape from unresolved point sources to resolved\nextended objects, as long as the target is not deemed diffuse, i.e., the total\nextent of the target source does not exceed too much more than a single FIS\nscan width of 10 arcmin. The new correction method takes advantage of the\nwell-defined shape (i.e., the scale invariance) of the point-spread function,\nwhich enables us to adopt a power-law FIS response function. We analyze the\npoint-source photometric calibrator data using the FIS AKARI Slow-scan Tool\n(FAST) and constrained the parameters of the adopted power-law FIS response\nfunction. We conclude that the photometric accuracy of the new correction\nmethod is better than 10% error based on comparisons with the expected fluxes\nof the photometric calibrators and that resulting fluxes without the present\ncorrection method can lead up to 230% overestimates or down to 50%\nunderestimates.\n", "  We develop a quantum-mechanical theory for Landau damping of surface plasmons\nin metal nanostructures larger that the characteristic length for nonlocal\neffects. We show that the electron surface scattering, which facilitates\nplasmon decay in small nanostructures, can be incorporated into the metal\ndielectric function on par with phonon and impurity scattering. The derived\nsurface scattering rate is determined by the plasmon local field polarization\nrelative to the metal-dielectric interface and is highly sensitive to the\nsystem geometry. We illustrate our model by providing analytical results for\nsurface scattering rate in some common shape nanostructures.\n", "  We measure the 4.5 $\\mu$m thermal emission of five transiting hot Jupiters,\nWASP-13b, WASP-15b, WASP-16b, WASP-62b and HAT-P-22b using channel 2 of the\nInfrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the {\\sl Spitzer Space Telescope}. Significant\nintrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer IRAC data require careful\ncorrection in order to achieve precision on the order of several hundred parts\nper million (ppm) for the measurement of exoplanet secondary eclipses. We\ndetermine eclipse depths by first correcting the raw data using three\nindependent data reduction methods. The Pixel Gain Map (PMAP), Nearest\nNeighbors (NNBR), and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) each correct for the\nintrapixel sensitivity effect in Spitzer photometric time-series observations.\nThe results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish\nif they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate\ntheir ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all\nthree methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and\nPLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method\nappears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar\ncentroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the\ndetector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the\nresiduals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR\nand PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and\nshould be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span\nequilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000~K and have brightness temperatures\nthat require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is\npossible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may\nalso be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.\n", "  Single-ion lanthanide-organic complexes can provide stable magnetic moments\nwith well-defined orientation for spintronic applications on the atomic level.\nHere, we show by a combined experimental approach of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy that\ndysprosium-tris(1,1,1-trifluoro-4-(2-thienyl)-2,4butanedionate) (Dy(tta)$_3$)\ncomplexes deposited on a Au(111) surface undergo a molecular distortion,\nresulting in distinct crystal field symmetry imposed on the Dy ion. This leads\nto an easy-axis magnetization direction in the ligand plane. Furthermore, we\nshow that tunneling electrons hardly couple to the spin excitations, which we\nascribe to the shielded nature of the $4f$ electrons.\n", "  Kibble-Zurek Mechanism (KZM) is applied broadly on the cosmology and\ncondensed matter field to analyze topological defects. However, it is just\nmainly used to deal with the defects formed in linear and global quenching\nconditions, which greatly limits its application field. There is blank in\nnonlinear or local quenching area for KZM. Even for the seemingly \"had been\nsolved\" in homogeneous structure, it is hard to say satisfactory. We propose a\nnew extended formulation that can well predict the scale of topological defects\nin both nonlinear and local quenching conditions. We show it is not necessary\nto deal with different cases with different approximation methods, the defects\nvarying with quenching rate has unified form, which is in better agreement with\nexperimental and simulation results. Additionally, guiding with this theory, we\nfind oscillation quenching methods that can effectively suppress the defects\nproduced in ion trap. This work will support a new way for us to find an\neffective method about very fast quantum state manipulations on adiabatic\nquantum computation besides the broad applications on continue phase transition\nareas.\n", "  We discuss X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from Crab-like pulsars,\nPSRs~J0537-6910 and~J0540-6919, in Large Magellanic Cloud. Fermi-LAT\nobservations have resolved the gamma-ray emissions from these two pulsars and\nfound the pulsed emissions from PSR~J0540-6919. The total pulsed radiation in\nthe X-ray/gamma-ray energy bands of PSR~J0540-6919 is observed with the\nefficiency $\\eta_{J0540}\\sim 0.06$ (in 4$\\pi$ sr), which is about a factor of\nten larger than $\\eta_{Crab}\\sim 0.006$ of the Crab pulsar. Although\nPSR~J0537-6910 has the highest spin-down power among currently known pulsars,\nthe efficiency of the observed X-ray emissions is about two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than that of PSR~J0540-6919. This paper mainly discusses what causes\nthe difference in the radiation efficiencies of these three energetic Crab-like\npulsars. We discuss electron/positron acceleration and high-energy emission\nprocesses within the outer gap model. By solving the outer gap structure with\nthe dipole magnetic field, we show that the radiation efficiency decreases as\nthe inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis\nincreases. To explain the difference in the pulse profile and in the radiation\nefficiency, our model suggests that PSR~J0540-6919 has an inclination angle\nmuch smaller than the that of Crab pulsar (here we assume the inclination\nangles of both pulsars are $\\alpha<90^{\\circ}$). On the other hand, we\nspeculate that the difference in the radiation efficiencies between\nPSRs~J0537-6910 and J0549-6919 is mainly caused by the difference in the Earth\nviewing angle, and that we see PSR~J0537-6910 with an Earth viewing angle\n$\\zeta>>90^{\\circ}$ (or $<<90^{\\circ}$) measured from the spin axis, while we\nsee PSR~J0540-6919 with $\\zeta\\sim 90^{\\circ}$.\n", "  In this paper we show that the Craik-Leibovich (CL) equation in hydrodynamics\nis the Euler equation on the dual of a certain central extension of the Lie\nalgebra of divergence-free vector fields. From this geometric viewpoint, one\ncan give a generalization of CL equation on any Riemannian manifold with\nboundary. We also prove a stability theorem for 2-dimensional steady flows of\nthe Craik-Leibovich equation.\n", "  We use polarized inelastic neutron scattering to study the temperature and\nenergy dependence of spin space anisotropies in the optimally hole-doped iron\npnictide Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{{\\rm c}}=38$ K). In the\nsuperconducting state, while the high-energy part of the magnetic spectrum is\nnearly isotropic, the low-energy part displays a pronouced anisotropy,\nmanifested by a $c$-axis polarized resonance. We also observe that the spin\nanisotropy in superconducting Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ extends to\nhigher energies compared to electron-doped BaFe$_{2-x}TM_{x}$As$_{2}$ ($TM=$Co,\nNi) and isovalent-doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{1.4}$P$_{0.6}$, suggesting a connection\nbetween $T_{\\rm c}$ and the energy scale of the spin anisotropy. In the normal\nstate, the low-energy spin anisotropy for optimally hole- and electron-doped\niron pnictides onset at temperatures similar to the temperatures at which the\nelastoresistance deviate from Curie-Weiss behavior, pointing to a possible\nconnection between the two phenomena. Our results highlight the relevance of\nthe spin-orbit coupling to the superconductivity of the iron pnictides.\n", "  The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular\nClusters (GO-13297) has been specifically designed to complement the existing\nF606W and F814W observations of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Globular\nCluster Survey (GO-10775) by observing the most accessible 47 of the previous\nsurvey's 65 clusters in three WFC3/UVIS filters F275W, F336W, and F438W. The\nnew survey also adds super-solar metallicity open cluster NGC 6791 to increase\nthe metallicity diversity. The combined survey provides a homogeneous 5-band\ndata set that can be used to pursue a broad range of scientific investigations.\nIn particular, the chosen UV filters allow the identification of multiple\nstellar populations by targeting the regions of the spectrum that are sensitive\nto abundance variations in C, N, and O. In order to provide the community with\nuniform preliminary catalogs, we have devised an automated procedure that\nperforms high-quality photometry on the new UV observations (along with similar\nobservations of seven other programs in the archive). This procedure finds and\nmeasures the potential sources on each individual exposure using library\npoint-spread functions and cross-correlates these observations with the\noriginal ACS-Survey catalog. The catalog of 57 clusters we publish here will be\nuseful to identify stars in the different stellar populations, in particular\nfor spectroscopic follow-up. Eventually, we will construct a more sophisticated\ncatalog and artificial-star tests based on an optimal reduction of the UV\nsurvey data, but the catalogs presented here give the community the chance to\nmake early use of this HST Treasury survey.\n", "  We find the central stars of the planetary nebulae (PNe) HaTr 7 and ESO 330-9\nto be close binary systems. Both have orbital periods of less than half a day\nand contain an irradiated cool companion to the hot central star. We provide\nlight curves, spectra, radial velocity curves, orbital periods, and binary\nmodeling results for both systems. The binary modeling leads to system\nparameters, or ranges of allowed parameters for each system. We find that for\nthe CS of HaTr 7 we need to use limb-darkening values for the cool companion\nthat are different than the expected values for an isolated star. We also fit\nthe central star spectrum to determine $\\log g$ and temperature values\nindependent of the binary modeling. For ESO 330-9 we find that based on our\nbinary modeling the hot central star is most likely a post-RGB star with a mass\nof around 0.4 M$_\\odot$. We discuss our derived stellar and nebular parameters\nin the broader context of close binary central stars and their surrounding PNe.\nWe also discuss the present status of known or suspected post-RGB stars in PNe.\n", "  We estimate the $\\Lambda$-parameter in the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme\nfor the SU(3) pure gauge theory with the twisted gradient flow method\nnon-perturbatively. We obtain\n$\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}/\\sqrt{\\sigma}=0.527(13)(10)$ and\n$r_{0}\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}}=0.605(15)(5)$ which are consistent with\nthe known values.This demonstrates the validity of the present method.\n", "  We recently presented evidence that stable umbra-penumbra boundaries are\ncharacterised by a distinct canonical value of the vertical component of the\nmagnetic field, $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$. In order to trigger the formation\nof a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In\nsunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas\nand granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral\nregions with $B_{\\rm ver} < B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, as well as in granular\nconvective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at\n$B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$. Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra\ninitiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire\npore ultimately. We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution\nof the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the\nmagnetic field properties in the studied region. The penumbra forms at the\nboundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA\\,10960.\nAs the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the\nforming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux.\nConsequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra.\nAt all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is\nsmaller than $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver} \\approx 1.8$~kG. Our findings are in an\nagreement with the need of $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$ for establishing a stable\numbra-penumbra boundary: while $B_{\\rm ver}$ in the pore is smaller than\n$B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, the protrusion of penumbral grains into the pore\narea is not blocked, a stable pore-penumbra boundary does not establish, and\nthe pore is fully overtaken by the penumbral magneto-convective mode. This\nscenario could also be one of the mechanisms giving rise to orphan penumbrae.\n", "  Measurements of the electric resistivity $\\rho(T)$ under pressure up to 8 GPa\nwere performed on high-quality single-crystals of the Yb-based heavy fermion\nsystem $\\beta$-YbAlB$_4$ in the temperature range $2<T<$ 300 K. In the\nresistivity data, we observed pressure-induced magnetic ordering above the\ncritical pressure $P_{\\rm c} \\sim$ 2 GPa. Clear difference in the phase diagram\nunder pressure using two types of pressure mediums indicates that the\ntransition temperature may be further enhanced under application of uniaxial\npressure. With pressure, this phase transition temperature $T_{\\rm M}$ is\nenhanced reaching 32 K at 8 GPa, which is the highest transition temperature so\nfar recorded for the Yb-based heavy fermion compounds. The power-law exponent\n$\\alpha$ in $\\rho=\\rho_0+ AT^{\\alpha}$ below $T_{\\rm M}$ gradually changes from\n3/2 to 5/2 with increasing pressure from 2 to 8 GPa. In contrast, the\nresistivity exhibits a $T$-linear behavior in the temperature range 2 $\\le T\n\\le$ 20 K and is insensitive to pressure below $P_{\\rm c}$. In this pressure\nregime, the magnetization is also nearly independent of pressure and shows no\nanomaly above 2 K. Our results indicate that a quantum critical point for\n$\\beta$-YbAlB$_4$ is also located near $P_{\\rm c}$ in addition to the strange\nmetal region near the ambient pressure.\n", "  Projection error limits the use of vector magnetograms of active regions\n(ARs) far from disk center. In this Letter, for ARs observed up to 60o from\ndisk center, we demonstrate a method of measuring and reducing the projection\nerror in the magnitude of any whole-AR parameter derived from a vector\nmagnetogram that has been deprojected to disk center. The method assumes that\nthe center-to-limb curve of the average of the parameter's absolute values\nmeasured from the disk passage of a large number of ARs and normalized to each\nAR's absolute value of the parameter at central meridian, gives the average\nfractional projection error at each radial distance from disk center. To\ndemonstrate the method, we use a large set of large-flux ARs and apply the\nmethod to a whole-AR parameter that is among the simplest to measure: whole-AR\nmagnetic flux. We measure 30,845 SDO/HMI vector magnetograms covering the disk\npassage of 272 large-flux ARs, each having whole-AR flux >1022 Mx. We obtain\nthe center-to-limb radial-distance run of the average projection error in\nmeasured whole-AR flux from a Chebyshev fit to the radial-distance plot of the\n30,845 normalized measured values. The average projection error in the measured\nwhole-AR flux of an AR at a given radial distance is removed by multiplying the\nmeasured flux by the correction factor given by the fit. The correction is\nimportant for both the study of evolution of ARs and for improving the accuracy\nof forecasting an AR's major flare/CME productivity.\n", "  Geometric phase in the wave function is important with regard to quantum\nnon-locality and adiabatic evolution. We study the confinement of a particle by\nthree-dimensional isotropically moving walls, of relevance to experimental\ntrapping techniques, via a proposed approach that explains the physical origin\nof the geometric Dirac phase induced in the wave function. This phase depends\nonly on the relative rate of change of the spatial scale factor. The approach\nalso yields the class of external potentials that replicate adiabatic evolution\nin finite time. As illustrative examples, we consider uniform and accelerating\nwalls, and the case where the Dirac phase is due to cosmic expansion.\n", "  Stars form out of the densest parts of molecular clouds. Far-IR emission can\nbe used to estimate the Star Formation Rate (SFR) and high dipole moment\nmolecules, typically HCN, trace the dense gas. A strong correlation exists\nbetween HCN and Far-IR emission, with the ratio being nearly constant, over a\nlarge range of physical scales. A few recent observations have found HCN to be\nweak with respect to the Far-IR and CO in subsolar metallicity (low-Z) objects.\nWe present observations of the Local Group galaxies M33, IC10, and NGC6822 with\nthe IRAM 30meter and NRO 45m telescopes, greatly improving the sample of low-Z\ngalaxies observed. HCN, HCO$^+$, CS, C$_2$H, and HNC have been detected.\nCompared to solar metallicity galaxies, the Nitrogen-bearing species are weak\n(HCN, HNC) or not detected (CN, HNCO, N$_2$H$^+$) relative to Far-IR or CO\nemission. HCO$^+$ and C$_2$H emission is normal with respect to CO and Far-IR.\nWhile $^{13}$CO is the usual factor 10 weaker than $^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O\nemission was not detected down to very low levels. Including earlier data, we\nfind that the HCN/HCO$^+$ ratio varies with metallicity (O/H) and attribute\nthis to the sharply decreasing Nitrogen abundance. The dense gas fraction,\ntraced by the HCN/CO and HCO$^+$/CO ratios, follows the SFR but in the low-Z\nobjects the HCO$^+$ is much easier to measure. Combined with larger and smaller\nscale measurements, the HCO$^+$ line appears to be an excellent tracer of dense\ngas and varies linearly with the SFR for both low and high metallicities.\n", "  Context. Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) typically display periodic and\nregular peaks in the light curves during the flare emissions. Sometimes, QPPs\nshow multiple periods at the same wavelength. However, changing periods in\nvarious channels are rare. Aims. We report QPPs in a solar flare on 2014\nOctober 27. They showed a period change that depended on whether thermal or\nnonthermal components were included. The flare was simultaneously observed by\nmany instruments. Methods. Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), we\ndecomposed the light curves at multiple wavelengths into slowly varying and\nrapidly varying signals. Then we identified the QPPs as the regular and\nperiodic peaks from the rapidly varying signals. The periods are derived with\nthe wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly\nvarying signals. Results. We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions\nduring the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At\nthe same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal\nemissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is\nexactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection\nrate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our\nresults further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength,\nsuch as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the\nperiodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. Conclusions. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal\ncomponents in a single flare that occur at almost the same time. This new\nobservational finding could be a challenge to the theory of flare QPPs.\n", "  Graphene has been identified as a promising material with numerous\napplications, particularly in spintronics. In this paper we investigate the\npeculiar features of spin excitations of magnetic units deposited on graphene\nnanoribbons and how they can couple through a dynamical interaction mediated by\nspin currents. We examine in detail the spin lifetimes and identify a pattern\ncaused by vanishing density of states sites in pristine ribbons with armchair\nborders. Impurities located on these sites become practically invisible to the\ninteraction, but can be made accessible by a gate voltage or doping. We also\ndemonstrate that the coupling between impurities can be turned on or off using\nthis characteristic, which may be used to control the transfer of information\nin transistor-like devices.\n", "  The higher-order Landau-Devonshire theory for BaTiO3 is proposed. The\nstructural stabilities of some Landau potentials proposed for the phenomenology\nof BaTiO3 until now are discussed in the framework of the singularity theory.\nWe confirm that the structurally stable Landau potential has to contain at\nleast all the invariants up to eighth power when the three parameters vary in\nthe experiment. We propose the tenth order Landau potential for adequate\ndescription of the various experimental data for BaTiO3 crystal. We show that\nthe results of the phenomenology based on the tenth potential are in good\nagreement with experimental data on the spontaneous polarization, dielectric\nconstants, dielectric susceptibility and piezoelectric coefficients versus the\ntemperature and the electric field.\n", "  In this work, according to the electromagnetic field tensor in the framework\nof generalized uncertainty principle (GUP), we obtain the Lorentz force and\nFaraday's law of induction in the presence of a minimal length. Also, the\nponderomotive force and pomderomotive pressure in the presence of a measurable\nminimal length are found.\n", "  We investigate the eruption of a quiescent filament located close to an\nactive region. Large-scale activation was observed in only half of the filament\nin the form of pre-eruption oscillations. Consequently only this half erupted\nnearly 30 hr after the oscillations commenced. Time-slice diagrams of 171 \\AA\\\nimages from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly were used to study the oscillations.\nThe oscillations were observed in several thin and long features connecting the\nfilament spine to the chromosphere below. This study traces the origin of such\nfeatures and proposes their possible interpretation. Small-scale magnetic flux\ncancellation accompanied by a brightening was observed at the footpoint of the\nfeatures shortly before their appearance, in images recorded by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Slow rise of the filament was detected in\naddition to the oscillations, indicating a gradual loss of equilibrium. Our\nanalysis indicates that a change in magnetic field connectivity between two\nneighbouring active regions and the quiescent filament resulted in weakening of\nthe overlying arcade of the filament leading to its eruption. It is also\nsuggested that the oscillating features are filament barbs, and the\noscillations are a manifestation during the pre-eruption phase of filaments.\n", "  Equations of state for hydrogen bonding fluids are typically described by two\nenergy scales. A short range highly directional hydrogen bond energy scale, as\nwell as a reference energy scale which accounts for dispersion and\norientationally averaged multi-pole attractions. These energy scales are always\ntreated independently. In recent years, extensive first principles quantum\nmechanics calculations on small water clusters have shown that both hydrogen\nbond and reference energy scales depend on the number of incident hydrogen\nbonds of the water molecule. In this work we propose a new methodology to\ncouple the reference energy scale to the degree of hydrogen bonding in the\nfluid. We demonstrate the utility of the new approach by showing that it gives\nimproved predictions of water-hydrocarbon mutual solubilities.\n", "  In this work, we study the critical behavior of second order points and\nspecifically of the Lifshitz point (LP) of a three-dimensional Ising model with\naxial competing interactions (ANNNI model), using time-dependent Monte Carlo\nsimulations. First of all, we used a recently developed technique that helps us\nlocalize the critical temperature corresponding to the best power law for\nmagnetization decay over time: $\\left\\langle M\\right\\rangle _{m_{0}=1}\\sim\nt^{-\\beta /\\nu z}\\ $ which is expected of simulations starting from initially\nordered states. Secondly, we obtain original results for the dynamic critical\nexponent $z$, evaluated from the behavior of the ratio $F_{2}(t)=\\left\\langle\nM^{2}\\right\\rangle _{m_{0}=0}/\\left\\langle M\\right\\rangle _{m_{0}=1}^{2}\\sim\nt^{3/z}$, along the critical line up to the LP. Finally, we explore all the\ncritical exponents of the LP in detail, including the dynamic critical exponent\n$\\theta $ that characterizes the initial slip of magnetization and the global\npersistence exponent $\\theta _{g}$ associated to the probability $P(t)$ that\nmagnetization keeps its signal up to time $t$. Our estimates for the dynamic\ncritical exponents at the Lifshitz point are $z=2.34(2)$ and $\\theta\n_{g}=0.336(4)$, values very different from the 3D Ising model (ANNNI model\nwithout the next-nearest-neighbor interactions at $z$-axis, i.e., $J_{2}=0$)\n$z\\approx 2.07$ and $\\theta _{g}\\approx 0.38$. We also present estimates for\nthe static critical exponents $\\beta $ and $\\nu $, obtained from extended\ntime-dependent scaling relations. Our results for static exponents are in good\nagreement with previous works\n", "  This article describes a simplified reconstruction algorithm for frequency\nresolved optical gating (FROG) measurements of highly (monotonically) chirped\npulses. The FROG traces are calculated using the stationary phase\napproximation, significantly reducing the data size and convergence time\ncompared to discrete Fourier transform based methods. The method is verified\nvia second harmonic generation FROG simulations and measurements of pulses\ncentred at 800nm with a bandwidth of 55nm stretched to 32ps at the 1% intensity\nlevel, corresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 830.\n", "  In the near future, there will likely be special-purpose quantum computers\nwith 40-50 high-quality qubits. This paper lays general theoretical foundations\nfor how to use such devices to demonstrate \"quantum supremacy\": that is, a\nclear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the\nExtended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the\nhardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along\nthe lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show\nthat there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with\nsampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a\nstatistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.\nCompared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk\ndirectly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being\nsampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new\nalgorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates\nin polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known\nalgorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of\nAaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of\nthe form \"if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH\ncollapses\"--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson\nand Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant\nversus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities.\nFifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly. Previous work\nimplies that, if OWFs exist, then quantum supremacy is possible relative to\nsuch oracles. We show that some assumption is needed: if SampBPP=SampBQP and NP\nis in BPP, then quantum supremacy is impossible relative to such oracles.\n", "  A unitary dynamical state-locking (UNIDYSLOCK) process is a unitary process\nthat can transform two orthogonal states to two non-orthogonal states. Its\ninverse process, i.e., the QUANSDAM process could realize an exponential QC\nspeedup in solving an unstructured search problem in the quantum-computing (QC)\nspeedup theory (X. Miao, arXiv:1105.3573 [quant-ph] (2011)). In this paper the\nprinciple of how a UNIDYSLOCK process works is described on the basis of the QC\nspeedup theory. A UNIDYSLOCK process does not exist at all in pure quantum\nmechanics. That it can change the quantum-state difference is original from the\nfundamental interaction between the quantum physical laws (i.e., the unitary\nquantum dynamics and the Hilbert-space symmetric structure) and the\nmathematical-logical principle of the search problem. It is characteristic for\nthe QC speedup theory. Even if a usual quantum computational (Qc) process that\nis reversible or unitary contained a UNIDYSLOCK (or QUANSDAM) process, the\ncontribution of the UNIDYSLOCK (or QUANSDAM) process to the QC speedup of the\nusual Qc process would be secondary or negligible. Whether or not a UNIDYSLOCK\n(or QUANSDAM) process can make an essential contribution to a QC speedup can\ndistinguish the QC speedup theory from any usual Qc theory. In the paper the QC\nspeedup mechanism of the HSSS quantum search process is also studied. The\nsearch process is essentially different from a usual quantum search algorithm.\nIt works in both the usual Hilbert space and the math Hilbert space. Due to the\nmath Hilbert space a mathematical-parallel operation is characteristic for the\nQC speedup theory, while a quantum-parallel operation is characteristic for the\nusual Qc theory. The fundamental interaction mentioned above and the\nfundamental quantum-computing resource play the main role in speeding up the\nsearch process.\n", "  The charge dynamics of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$TM$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ (TM = Mn and Cr) has\nbeen investigated by optical spectroscopy. It was found that in addition to the\nstrong suppression of the coherent charge transport, the magnetic impurity\ninduces a novel spectral feature related to the carrier localization in the\nfar-infrared region above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We\nattribute it to the cooperative effect between conduction electrons and local\nmagnetic order induced by magnetic impurities. The present results demonstrate\nthat Mn and Cr are not conventional magnetic pair-breakers in iron pnictides.\n", "  We investigate the maximum caliber variational principle as an inference\nalgorithm used to predict dynamical properties of complex nonequilibrium,\nstationary, statistical systems in the presence of incomplete information.\nSpecifically, we maximize the path entropy over discrete time step trajectories\nsubject to normalization, stationarity, and detailed balance constraints\ntogether with a path-dependent dynamical information constraint reflecting a\ngiven average global behavior of the complex system. A general expression for\nthe transition probability values associated with the stationary random Markov\nprocesses describing the nonequilibrium stationary system is computed. By\nvirtue of our analysis, we uncover that a convenient choice of the dynamical\ninformation constraint together with a perturbative asymptotic expansion with\nrespect to its corresponding Lagrange multiplier of the general expression for\nthe transition probability leads to a formal overlap with the well-known\nGlauber hyperbolic tangent rule for the transition probability for the\nstochastic Ising model in the limit of very high temperatures of the heat\nreservoir.\n", "  The influence of long-term ageing (about one year) on the Raman scattering\n(RS) spectra and the temperature dependence of conductivity has been studied in\ntwo series of monolayer graphene samples irradiated by different doses of\nC$^{+}$ and Xe$^{+}$ ions. It is shown that the main result of ageing consists\nof changes in the intensity and position of D- and G- and 2D-lines in RS\nspectra and in an increase of the conductivity. The observed effects are\nexplained in terms of an increase of the radius of the \\textquotedblleft\nactivated\\textquotedblright{} area around structural defects.\n", "  A generalized phenomenological (3 + 2 + 1)-model with three active and three\nsterile neutrinos is considered for the calculation of the neutrino oscillation\ncharacteristics at normal mass hierarchy of active neutrinos and significant\nsplitting between the mass of one sterile neutrino and the masses of other two\nsterile neutrinos. A new parametrization and a certain form of the general\nneutrino mixing matrix for active and sterile neutrinos are suggested taking\ninto account the possible violation of CP invariance in the lepton sector. The\ntest values of the neutrino masses and the mixing parameters are chosen. The\ntransition probabilities for the different flavors of neutrino, which can be\ntransformed into each other, are calculated, and the graphical dependences are\nobtained for the disappearance probability of muon neutrino/antineutrino and\nappearance probability of electron neutrino/antineutrino in the muon\nneutrino/antineutrino jet as a function of distance and other model parameters\nat their acceptable values and at neutrino energies not higher than 50 MeV, as\nwell as a function of the ratio of the distance to the neutrino energy. It is\nshown that in the case of the mixing matrix of a definite type (of the a_2\ntype) between active and sterile neutrinos the explanation of the acceleration\nanomaly on small distances in the neutrino data (LSND anomaly) is possible, as\nwell as the reactor and gallium anomalies. The theoretical results obtained can\nbe used for the interpretation and prediction of results of the ground-based\nneutrino experiments on searching for the sterile neutrinos, and also for the\nanalysis of certain astrophysical observation data.\n", "  A D-dimensional gravitational model with a Gauss-Bonnet term and the\ncosmological term Lambda is considered. Assuming diagonal cosmological metrics,\nwe find, for certain non-zero Lambda new examples of solutions with an\nexponential time dependence of two scale factors, governed by two Hubble-like\nparameters H > 0 and h < 0, corresponding to submanifolds of dimensions m and\nl, respectively, with (m,l) = (4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6) and D =\n1 + m + l. Any of these solutions describes an exponential expansion of \"our\"\n3-dimensional factor-space with Hubble parameter H and zero variation of the\neffective gravitational constant G. We also prove the stability of these\nsolutions in the class of cosmological solutions with diagonal metrics.\n", "  The eccentricity, periastron angle, orbital inclination, mass ratio, stellar\ntemperatures and relative stellar radii of 12 eclipsing eccentric binaries were\ndetermined on the basis of Kepler data. The analysis of their out-of-eclipse\nvariability led to the following results: (i) KIC 10490980 exhibits rotational\n(spot-type) variability; (ii) Four new heartbeat stars were found: KIC 9344623\nand KIC 10296163, which have wide tidally induced light humps and KIC 9119405\nand KIC 9673173, which have narrow \"W-shape\" features; (iii) KIC 4932691 shows\noscillations with approximately the 18th harmonic of the orbital period. We\nestablished that the eccentric Kepler binaries fall below the envelope\nP(1-e^2)^{3/2} = 5 days on the period-eccentricity diagram and that there is a\nsurprising lack of eccentric binaries with periods of 25-35 days.\n", "  We here elaborate on a quantitative argument to support the validity of the\nCollatz conjecture, also known as the (3x + 1) or Syracuse conjecture. The\nanalysis is structured as follows. First, three distinct fixed points are found\nfor the third iterate of the Collatz map, which hence organise in a period 3\norbit of the original map. These are 1, 2 and 4, the elements which define the\nunique attracting cycle, as hypothesised by Collatz. To carry out the\ncalculation we write the positive integers in modulo 8 (mod8 ), obtain a closed\nanalytical form for the associated map and determine the transitions that yield\ncontracting or expanding iterates in the original, infinite-dimensional, space\nof positive integers. Then, we consider a Markov chain which runs on the\nreduced space of mod8 congruence classes of integers. The transition\nprobabilities of the Markov chain are computed from the deterministic map, by\nemploying a measure that is invariant for the map itself. Working in this\nsetting, we demonstrate that the stationary distribution sampled by the\nstochastic system induces a contracting behaviour for the orbits of the\ndeterministic map on the original space of the positive integers. Sampling the\nequilibrium distribution on the congruence classes mod8^m for any m, which\namounts to arbitrarily reducing the degree of imposed coarse graining, returns\nan identical conclusion.\n", "  It has been shown that the adjacency eigenspace of a network contains key\ninformation of its underlying structure. However, there has been no study on\nspectral analysis of the adjacency matrices of directed signed graphs. In this\npaper, we derive theoretical approximations of spectral projections from such\ndirected signed networks using matrix perturbation theory. We use the derived\ntheoretical results to study the influences of negative intra cluster and inter\ncluster directed edges on node spectral projections. We then develop a spectral\nclustering based graph partition algorithm, SC-DSG, and conduct evaluations on\nboth synthetic and real datasets. Both theoretical analysis and empirical\nevaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n", "  The understanding of the nature of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is one of\nthe most intriguing open questions for current and future observatories. These\nparticles are expected to be accelerated in extragalactic sources. Because of\ntheir low flux, their detection is done indirectly observing extensive\nair-showers, with ground-based experiments. A review of the detection technique\nand the most recent results is presented with a look to the perspectives for\nthe future.\n", "  A generic expression to compute triple parton scattering (TPS) cross sections\nin high-energy proton-nucleus (pA) collisions is derived as a function of the\ncorresponding single-parton cross sections and an effective parameter encoding\nthe transverse parton profile of the proton. The TPS cross sections are\nenhanced by a factor of $9\\,A\\approx 2000$ in pPb compared to those in\nproton-nucleon collisions at the same center-of-mass energy. Estimates for\ntriple charm ($c\\overline{c}$) and bottom ($b\\overline{b}$) production in pPb\ncollisions at LHC and FCC energies are presented based on\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations for $c\\overline{c},\nb\\overline{b}$ single-parton cross sections. At $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 8.8$ TeV,\nabout 10% of the pPb events have three $c\\overline{c}$ pairs produced in\nseparate partonic interactions. At $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 63$ TeV, the pPb cross\nsections for triple-J$/\\psi$ and triple-$b\\overline{b}$ are ${\\cal O}$(1--10\nmb). In the most energetic cosmic-ray collisions observed on earth, TPS\n$c\\overline{c}$-pair cross sections equal the total p-Air inelastic cross\nsection.\n", "  The absence of ionization and observation of white continuum in the initial\nmoment of filamentation of powerful femtosecond laser pulses, propagating in\nsilica glasses, as well as the filamentation without plasma channels observed\nin the experiments in air, forced us to look for other nonlinear mechanisms of\ndescription the above mentioned effects. For this reason we present in this\npaper new parametric conversion mechanism for asymmetric spectrum broadening of\nfemtosecond laser pulses towards the higher frequencies in isotropic media.\nThis mechanism includes cascade generation with THz spectral shift for solids\nand GHz spectral delay for gases. The process works simultaneously with the\nfour-photon parametric wave mixing. The proposed theoretical model gives very\ngood coincidence with the experimental data. In addition we demonstrate that\nthe nonlinear model describes the process of reduction of the number of\nfilaments trough two mechanisms of nonlinear interaction: attraction due to\ncross-phase modulation and energy exchange due to four-photon parametric wave\nmixing.\n", "  In mixing highly viscous materials, like polymers, foods, and rubbers, the\ngeometric structure of the mixing device is a determining factor for the\nquality of the mixing process. In pitched-tip kneading disks (ptKD), a novel\ntype of mixing element, based on conventional kneading disks (KD), the tip\nangle is modified to change the channel geometry as well as the drag ability of\nKD. We discuss the effects of the tip angle in ptKD on mixing characteristics\nbased on numerical simulation of the flow in the melt-mixing zone under\ndifferent feed rates and a screw rotation speed. It turns out that the passage\nof fluid through the high-stress regions increases in ptKD compared to\nconventional KD regardless of the directions and sizes of the tip angle, while\nthe fluctuation in residence time stays at the same level as the conventional\nKD. Furthermore, pitched tips of backward direction increase the mean applied\nstress on the fluid elements during its residence in the melt-mixing zone,\nsuggesting the enhancement of dispersive mixing quality in ptKD. These\nunderstandings of the role of the tip angle on KD can give a basic guide in\nselecting and designing suitable angle parameters of ptKD for different mixing\npurposes.\n", "  We study mutual alignment and interactions between colloidal particles of\ndissimilar shapes and dimensions when dispersed in a nematic host fluid. Convex\npentagonal and concave starfruit-shaped nanoprisms and microspheres induce\ndipolar or quadrupolar director structures. The ensuing elastic pair\ninteractions between microspheres and nanoprisms are highly dependent on the\nnanoparticle shape being omnidirectionally attractive for convex prisms but\nstrongly anisotropic for concave prisms. Elastic deformations due to spherical\nparticles cause well-defined alignment of complex-shaped nanoparticles at\ndistances much larger than the microsphere size. We characterize distance and\nangular dependencies of elastic pair interaction forces, torques, and binding\nenergies. The studied elasticity-mediated self-assembly of metal and dielectric\nnanoparticles with dissimilar shapes and sizes opens new possibilities for\nself-assembly based fabrication of structured mesoscopic composites with\npredesigned properties.\n", "  The progress of realizing colloidal structures mimicking natural forms of\norganization in condensed matter is inherently limited by the availability of\nsuitable colloidal building blocks. To enable new forms of crystalline and\nquasicrystalline self-organization of colloids, we develop truncated pyramidal\nparticles that form nematic elastic dipoles with long-range electrostaticlike\nand geometry-guided low-symmetry short-range interactions. Using a combination\nof nonlinear optical imaging, laser tweezers, and video microscopy, we\ncharacterize colloidal pair interactions and demonstrate unusual forms of\nself-tiling of these particles into crystalline, quasicrystalline, and other\narrays. Our findings are explained using an electrostatics analogy along with\nliquid crystal elasticity and symmetry breaking considerations, potentially\nexpanding photonic and electro-optic applications of colloids.\n", "  One of the central experimental efforts in nematic colloids research aims to\nexplore how the interplay between the geometry of particles along with the\naccompanying nematic director deformations and defects around them can provide\na means of guiding particle self-assembly and controlling the structure of\nparticle-induced defects. In this work, we design, fabricate, and disperse\nlow-symmetry colloidal particles with shapes of spirals, double spirals, and\ntriple spirals in a nematic fluid. These spiral-shaped particles, which are\ncontrolled by varying their surface functionalization to provide tangential or\nperpendicular boundary conditions of the nematic molecular alignment, are found\ninducing director distortions and defect configurations with non-chiral or\nchiral symmetry. Colloidal particles also exhibit both stable and metastable\nmultiple orientational states in the nematic host, with a large number of\ndirector configurations featuring both singular and solitonic nonsingular\ntopological defects accompanying them, which can result in unusual forms of\ncolloidal self-assembly. Our findings directly demonstrate how the symmetry of\nparticle-generated director configurations can be further lowered, or not, as\ncompared to the low point group symmetry of solid micro-inclusions, depending\non the nature of induced defects while satisfying topological constraints. We\nshow that achiral colloidal particles can cause chiral symmetry breaking of\nelastic distortions, which is driven by complex three-dimensional winding of\ninduced topological line defects and solitons.\n", "  Plasmonic photoconductive antennas have great promise for increasing\nresponsivity and detection sensitivity of conventional photoconductive\ndetectors in time-domain terahertz imaging and spectroscopy systems. However,\noperation bandwidth of previously demonstrated plasmonic photoconductive\nantennas has been limited by bandwidth constraints of their antennas and\nphotoconductor parasitics. Here, we present a powerful technique for realizing\nbroadband terahertz detectors through large-area plasmonic photoconductive\nnano-antenna arrays. A key novelty that makes the presented terahertz detector\nsuperior to the state-of-the art is a specific large-area device geometry that\noffers a strong interaction between the incident terahertz beam and optical\npump at the nanoscale, while maintaining a broad operation bandwidth. The large\ndevice active area allows robust operation against optical and terahertz beam\nmisalignments. We demonstrate broadband terahertz detection with\nsignal-to-noise ratio levels as high as 107 dB.\n", "  A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) miniaturized into\nnanoscale is promising in the inductive detection of a single electron spin. A\nnano-SQUID with a strong spin coupling coefficient, a low flux noise, and a\nwide working magnetic field range is highly desired in a single spin resonance\nmeasurement. Nano-SQUIDs with Dayem-bridge junctions excel in a high working\nfield range and in the direct coupling from spins to the bridge. However, the\ncommon planar structure of nano-SQUIDs is known for problems such as a shallow\nflux modulation depth and a troublesome hysteresis in current-voltage curves.\nHere, we developed a fabrication process for creating three-dimensional (3-D)\nniobium (Nb) nano-SQUIDs with nano-bridge junctions that can be tuned\nindependently. Characterization of the device shows up to 45.9 % modulation\ndepth with a reversible current-voltage curve. Owning to the large modulation\ndepth, the measured flux noise is as low as 0.34 \\mu\\Phi$_0$/Hz$^{1/2}$. The\nworking field range of the SQUID is greater than 0.5 T parallel to the SQUID\nplane. We believe that 3-D Nb nano-SQUIDs provide a promising step toward\neffective single-spin inductive detection.\n", "  We study the influence of the interface quality of\nPt/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$(111) hybrids on their spin Hall magnetoresistance. This\nis achieved by exposing Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$(111) single crystal substrates to\ndifferent well-defined surface treatments prior to the Pt deposition. The\nquality of the Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$(YIG) surface, the Pt/YIG interface and the\nPt layer is monitored \\textit{in-situ} by reflection high-energy electron\ndiffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy as well as \\textit{ex-situ} by\natomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction. To identify the impact of the\ndifferent surface treatments on the spin Hall magnetoresistance,\nangle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements are carried out at room\ntemperature. The largest spin Hall magnetoresistance is found in Pt/YIG\nfabricated by a two-step surface treatment consisting of a \"piranha\" etch\nprocess followed by an annealing step at $500^\\circ$C in pure oxygen\natmosphere. Our data suggest that the small SMR in Pt/YIG without any surface\ntreatments of the YIG substrate prior to Pt deposition is caused by a\nconsiderable carbon agglomeration at the Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ surface.\n", "  We investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of a 2D ensemble of nonlocally\ncoupled chaotic cubic maps in a bistability regime. In particular, we perform a\ndetailed study on the transition \"coherence -- incoherence\" for varying\ncoupling strength for a fixed interaction radius. For the 2D ensemble we show\nthe appearance of amplitude and phase chimera states previously reported for 1D\nensembles of nonlocally coupled chaotic systems. Moreover, we uncover a novel\ntype of chimera state, double-well chimera, which occurs due to the interplay\nof the bistability of the local dynamics and the 2D ensemble structure.\nAdditionally, we find double-well chimera behaviour for steady states which we\ncall double-well chimera death. A distinguishing feature of chimera patterns\nobserved in the lattice is that they mainly combine clusters of different\nchimera types: phase, amplitude and double-well chimeras.\n", "  A study of the deuteron structure in the framework of relativistic quantum\nmechanics is presented. Point-form (PF) relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) is\napplied to the elastic eD scattering. The deuteron wave function and neutron\nform factors are fitted to the electromagnetic deuteron form factors. We also\ncompare results obtained by different realistic deuteron wave functions\nstemming from Nijmegen-I, Nijmegen-II, JISP16, CD-Bonn, Paris, Argonne, Idaho\nand Moscow (with forbidden states) potentials. It is shown that the\nelectromagnetic deuteron form factors may be described without exchange\ncurrents.\n", "  We numerically investigate the ratchet transport of mixtures of active and\npassive particles in a transversal asymmetric channel.A big passive particle is\nimmersed in a 'sea' of active particles. Due to the chirality of active\nparticles, the longitudinal directed transport is induced by the transversal\nasymmetry. For the active particles, the chirality completely determines the\ndirection of the ratchet transport, the counterclockwise and clockwise\nparticles move to the opposite directions and can be separated. However, for\nthe passive particle, the transport behavior becomes complicated, the direction\nis determined by competitions among the chirality, the self-propulsion speed,\nand the packing fraction. Interestingly, within certain parameters, the passive\nparticle moves to the left,while active particles move to the right. In\naddition, there exist optimal parameters(the chirality, the height of the\nbarrier, the self-propulsion speed and the packing fraction) at which the\nrectified efficiency takes its maximal value. Our findings could be used for\nthe experimental pursuit of the ratchet transport powered by chiral active\nparticles.\n", "  Deterministic techniques enabling the implementation and engineering of\nbright and coherent solid-state quantum light sources are key for the reliable\nrealization of a next generation of quantum devices. Such a technology, at\nbest, should allow one to significantly scale up the number of implemented\ndevices within a given processing time. In this work, we discuss a possible\ntechnology platform for such a scaling procedure, relying on the application of\nnanoscale quantum dot imaging to the pillar microcavity architecture, which\npromises to combine very high photon extraction efficiency and\nindistinguishability. We discuss the alignment technology in detail, and\npresent the optical characterization of a selected device which features a\nstrongly Purcell-enhanced emission output. This device, which yields an\nextraction efficiency of $\\eta=(49\\pm4)~\\%$, facilitates the emission of\nphotons with $(94\\pm2.7)~\\%$ indistinguishability.\n", "  Sorting of microswimmers based on their mobility properties is of utmost\nimportance for various branches of science and engineering. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel sorting method, where the mixed chiral particles can be\nseparated by applying two opposite rotary obstacles. It is found that when the\nangular speed of the obstacles, the angular speed of active particles and the\nself-propulsion speed satisfy a certain relation, the mixed particles can be\ncompletely separated and the capture efficiency takes its maximal value. Our\nresults may have application in capture or sorting of chiral active particles,\nor even measuring the chirality of active particles.\n", "  Time-evolution of the vibrational states of two interacting harmonic\noscillators in the local mode scheme is presented. A local-to-normal mode\ntransition (LNT) is identified and studied from the time dependent point of\nview. The LNT is established as a polyad breaking phenomenon from the local\npoint of view for the stretching degrees of freedom in a triatomic molecule.\nThis study is carried out in the algebraic representation of bosonic operators.\nThe dynamics of the states are determined via the solutions of the\ncorresponding nonlinear Ermakov equation. Application of this formalism to\nH$_2$O, CO$_2$, O$_3$ and NO$_2$ molecules in the adiabatic, sudden and linear\nregime is considered.\n", "  Graphene exhibits promise as a plasmonic material with high mode confinement\nthat could enable efficient hot carrier extraction. We investigate the\nlifetimes and mean free paths of energetic carriers in free-standing graphene,\ngraphite and a heterostructure consisting of alternating graphene and hexagonal\nboron nitride layers using ab initio calculations of electron-electron and\nelectron-phonon scattering in these materials. We find that the extremely high\nlifetimes (3 ps) of low-energy carriers near the Dirac point in graphene, which\nare a hundred times larger than that in noble metals, are reduced by an order\nof magnitude due to inter-layer coupling in graphite, but enhanced in the\nheterostructure due to phonon mode clamping. However, these lifetimes drop\nprecipitously with increasing carrier energy, and are smaller than those in\nnoble metals at energies exceeding 0.5 eV. By analysing the contribution of\ndifferent scattering mechanisms and inter-layer interactions, we identify\ndesirable spacer layer characteristics - high dielectric constant and heavy\natoms - that could pave the way for plasmonic heterostructures with improved\nhot carrier transport.\n", "  We study a model of an infinite system of point particles in $\\mathds{R}^d$\nperforming random jumps with attraction. The system's states are probability\nmeasures on the space of particle configurations, and their evolution is\ndescribed by means of Kolmogorov and Fokker-Planck equations. Instead of\nsolving these equations directly we deal with correlation functions evolving\naccording to a hierarchical chain of differential equations, derived from the\nKolmogorov equation. Under quite natural conditions imposed on the jump kernels\n-- and analyzed in the paper -- we prove that this chain has a unique classical\nsub-Poissonian solution on a bounded time interval. This gives a partial answer\nto the question whether the sub-Poissonicity is consistent with any kind of\nattraction. We also discuss possibilities to get a complete answer to this\nquestion.\n", "  In numerous physical models on networks, dynamics are based on interactions\nthat exclusively involve properties of a node's nearest neighbors. However, a\nnode's local view of its neighbors may systematically bias perceptions of\nnetwork connectivity or the prevalence of certain traits. We investigate the\nstrong friendship paradox, which occurs when the majority of a node's neighbors\nhave more neighbors than does the node itself. We develop a model to predict\nthe magnitude of the paradox, showing that it is enhanced by negative\ncorrelations between degrees of neighboring nodes. We then show that by\nincluding neighbor-neighbor correlations, which are degree correlations one\nstep beyond those of neighboring nodes, we accurately predict the impact of the\nstrong friendship paradox in real-world networks. Understanding how the paradox\nbiases local observations can inform better measurements of network structure\nand our understanding of collective phenomena.\n", "  We briefly review the current status and future prospects of testing the\nlow-scale seesaw models of neutrino mass generation at the energy frontier,\nwith particular emphasis on the ongoing searches at the LHC.\n", "  The study of ion transport in electrochemically active materials for energy\nstorage systems requires simulations on quantum- atomistic- and mesoscales. The\nmethods accessing these scales not only have to be effective but also well\ncompatible to provide a full description of the underlying processes. We\npropose to adapt the Generalized Shadow Hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method to\natomistic simulation of ion intercalation electrode materials for batteries.\nThe method has never been applied to simulations in solid state chemistry but\nit has been successfully used for simulation of biological macromolecules,\ndemonstrating better performance and accuracy than can be achieved with the\npopular molecular dynamics (MD) method. It has been also extended to\nsimulations on meso-scales, making it even more attractive for simulation of\nbattery materials. We combine GSHMC with the dynamical Core-Shell model to\nincorporate polarizability into the simulation and apply the new Modified\nAdaptive Integration Approach, MAIA, which allows for a larger time step due to\nits excellent conservation properties. Also, we modify the GSHMC method,\nwithout losing its performance and accuracy, to reduce the negative effect of\nintroducing a shell mass within a dynamical shell model. The proposed approach\nhas been tested on olivine NaFePO4, which is a promising cathode material for\nNa-ion batteries. The calculated Na-ion diffusion and structural properties\nhave been compared with the available experimental data and with the results\nobtained using MD and the original GSHMC method. Based on these tests, we claim\nthat the new technique is advantageous over MD and the conventional GSHMC and\ncan be recommended for studies of other solid-state electrode and electrolyte\nmaterials whenever high accuracy and efficient sampling are critical for\nobtaining tractable simulation results.\n", "  We review that the heavy CP-even MSSM Higgs boson is still a viable candidate\nto explain the Higgs signal at 125 GeV. This is possible in a highly\nconstrained parameter region, that will be probed by LHC searches for the\nCP-odd Higgs boson and the charged Higgs boson in the near future. We briefly\ndiscuss the new benchmark scenarios that can be employed to maximize the\nsensitivity of the experimental analysis to this interpretation.\n", "  For the first time the electrohydrodynamic convection (EHC) of nematic liquid\ncrystals is studied via fully nonlinear simulation. As a system of rich\npattern-formation the EHC is mostly studied with negative nematic liquid\ncrystals experimentally, and sometimes with the help of theoretical instability\nanalysis in the linear regime. Up to now there is only weakly nonlinear\nsimulation for a step beyond the emergence of steady convection rolls. In this\nwork we modify the liquid crystal stochastic rotational model (LC SRD) [Lee et\nal., J. Chem. Phys., 2015, 142, 164110] to incorporate the field alignment\nmechanism for positive and negative nematic liquid crystals. The convection\npatterns and their flow dynamics in the presence of external electric field are\nstudied. Our results predict the similar optical convection patterns in the\nreflected polarized light when one uses positive and negative types of nematic\nliquid crystals. However in the emerged flow fields, surprisingly, the driving\nareas of convection rolls are different for different types of LCs. Their\napplication for nematic colloidal transportation in microfluidics is discussed.\n", "  For over 70 years, ferroelectric materials have been remaining one of the\ncentral research topics for condensed matter physics and material science, the\ninterest driven both by fundamental science and applications. However,\nferroelectric surfaces, the key component of ferroelectric films and\nnanostructures, still present a significant theoretical and even conceptual\nchallenge. Indeed, stability of ferroelectric phase per se necessitates\nscreening of polarization charge. At surfaces, this can lead to coupling\nbetween ferroelectric and semiconducting properties of material, or with\nsurface (electro) chemistry, going well beyond classical models applicable for\nferroelectric interfaces. In this review, we summarize recent studies of\nsurface screening phenomena in ferroelectrics. We provide a brief overview of\nthe historical understanding of physics of ferroelectric surfaces, and existing\ntheoretical models that both introduce screening mechanisms and explore the\nrelationship between screening and relevant aspects of ferroelectric\nfunctionalities starting from phase stability itself. Given that majority of\nferroelectrics exist in multiple-domain states, we focus on local studies of\nscreening phenomena using scanning probe microscopy techniques. We discuss\nrecent studies of static and dynamic phenomena on ferroelectric surfaces, as\nwell as phenomena observed under lateral transport, light, chemical, and\npressure stimuli. We also note that the need for ionic screening renders\npolarization switching a coupled physical-electrochemical process, and discuss\nthe non-trivial phenomena such as chaotic behavior during domain switching that\nstem from this.\n", "  Water scarcity is a dilemma facing much of the global population. Cation\nintercalation desalination (CID) cells, which use intercalation host compounds\n(IHCs) in combination with ion-exchange membranes (IEMs), could aid in\naddressing this challenge by treating saline water sources. Originally, the\nperformance of such cells was predicted utilizing continuous flow of saline\nwater through porous IHC electrodes. Here, we use two-dimensional\nporous-electrode theory with concentrated solution transport to evaluate the\nperformance of various cell architectures where flow occurs through open flow\nchannels (OFCs) when two IHC electrodes comprised of nickel hexacyanoferrate\n(NiHCF) are used to store Na+ ions. We show that, when two OFCs are used,\ncation exchange membranes (CEMs) are adjoined at flow-channel/electrode\ninterfaces, and an anion exchange membrane (AEM) is arranged between flow\nchannels, salt removal increases relative to the original design with\nflow-through (FT) electrodes. The IEM stacking sequence within such a membrane\nflow-by (MFB) cell is the fundamental repeat unit for electrodialysis (ED)\nstacks using many IEMs (CEM/AEM/.../CEM/AEM/CEM) with many diluate streams.\nAccordingly, we simulate the performance of such ED stacks using NiHCF IHCs,\nand we predict that salt adsorption capacity (per unit NiHCF mass) is amplified\nby twenty-fold relative to MFB and FT cells, while simultaneously decreasing\n0.7 M NaCl feed water to 0.2-0.3 M within diluate streams. The generality of\nthese findings is further supported by simulations using Na0.44MnO2 IHC instead\nof NiHCF. Thus, we propose the use of cation IHCs as alternatives to the\ngas-evolution reactions used in conventional ED.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that the transmission of a 1030~nm, 1.3~ps\nlaser beam of 100 mJ energy through fog increases when its repetition rate\nincreases to the kHz range. Due to the efficient energy deposition by the laser\nfilaments in the air, a shockwave ejects the fog droplets from a substantial\nvolume of the beam, at a moderate energy cost. This process opens prospects for\napplications requiring the transmission of laser beams through fogs and clouds.\n", "  We calculate the drag coefficient of a liquid domain in a flat fluid membrane\nsurrounded by three-dimensional fluids on both sides. In the membrane, the\ntangential stress should be continuous across the domain perimeter, which makes\nthe velocity gradient discontinuous there unless the ratio of the membrane\nviscosity inside the domain to the one outside the domain equals unity. The\ngradient of the velocity field in the three-dimensional fluids is continuous.\nThis field, in the limit that the spatial point approaches the membrane, should\nagree with the velocity field of the membrane. Thus, unless the ratio of the\nmembrane viscosities is unity, we need to assume some additional singularity at\nthe domain perimeter in solving the governing equations. In our result, the\ndrag coefficient is given in a series expansion with respect to a dimensionless\nparameter, which equals zero when the ratio of the membrane viscosities is\nunity and approaches unity when the ratio tends to infinity. We derive the\nrecurrence equations for the coefficients of the series. In the limit of the\ninfinite ratio, our numerical results agree with the previous results for the\ndisk.\n", "  Understanding the mechanism of martensitic transformation is of great\nimportance in developing advanced high strength steels, especially\nTRansformation-Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels. The TRIP effect leads to\nenhanced work-hardening rate, postponed onset of necking and excellent\nformability. In-situ transmission electron microscopy has been performed to\nsystematically investigate the dynamic interactions between dislocations and\nalpha martensite at microscale. Local stress concentrations, e.g. from notches\nor dislocation pile-ups, render free edges and grain boundaries favorable\nnucleation sites for alpha martensite. Its growth leads to partial dislocation\nemission on two independent slip planes from the hetero-interface when the\naustenite matrix is initially free of dislocations. The kinematic analysis\nreveals that activating slip systems on two independent {111} planes of\naustenite are necessary in accommodating the interfacial mismatch strain. Full\ndislocation emission is generally observed inside of austenite regions that\ncontain high density of dislocations. In both situations, phase boundary\npropagation generates large amounts of dislocations entering into the matrix,\nwhich renders the total deformation compatible and provide substantial strain\nhardening of the host phase. These moving dislocation sources enable plastic\nrelaxation and prevent local damage accumulation by intense slipping on the\nsofter side of the interfacial region. Thus, finely dispersed martensite\ndistribution renders plastic deformation more uniform throughout the austenitic\nmatrix, which explains the exceptional combination of strength and ductility of\nTRIP steels.\n", "  In this article, after introducing a kind of q-deformation in quantum\nmechanics, first, q-deformed form of Dirac equation in relativistic quantum\nmechanics is derived. Then three important scat erring problem in physics are\nstudied. All results have satisfied what we had expected before. Furthermore,\neffects of all parameters in the problems on the reflection and transmission\ncoefficients are calculated and shown graphically.\n", "  We introduce a new color index consisting of two spectral band width to\nmeasure TiO absorption band strength centered at 567 nm. Based on the most\nup-to-date line list for TiO we regenerate a grid of synthesized spectra and\ninvestigate the temperature sensitivity of the index. The new index behave\nsimilar to older Wing TiO-index where itdecreas emonotonically from coolest\natmosphere with Teff =2800 up to Teff =4000 where the TiO molecules\ndisassociate. To further examine the feasibility of the new index we reproduce\nthe calibration using a list of observed high resolution spectra and found\nsimilar results. This index extend TiO absorption band capability to measure\neffective temperature of late K to M stars to visual spectrum where it is more\naccessible to small telescopes for long term dedicated observation.\n", "  In this talk, I give an overview on recent theoretical and phenomenological\nstudies of massive neutrinos. First of all, the present status of neutrino\nmixing parameters is summarized. The phenomenology of neutrino oscillations is\nthen discussed, and current understanding of lepton flavor mixing is presented.\nFinally, I consider the seesaw models of neutrino masses and briefly mention\nthe direct searches at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  In our daily lives, we observe objects sinking, floating, or rising when\nimmersed in a fluid. The Archimedes principle, which explains an object's\nbehavior when immersed in a fluid, is important in fluid mechanics; however, it\nis a relatively complex concept for middle school students to grasp, as they\noften harbor misconceptions. To initiate conceptual change among students\nregarding the misconception \"heavy objects sink and light objects float,\" I\ncreated a project during which students build a stable submarine that uses\nfluid transfers to move up, down, and forward while carrying a load. Students\nmust take into account several variables, from the design of the submarine to\nthe choice of materials. Additionally, students write a report that includes a\nuser manual, challenges they encountered and how they overcame those\nchallenges, and a detailed text that links theory to their submarine.\n", "  The PTOLEMY experiment, implementing a $100~{\\rm g}$ surface-deposition\ntritium target, is promising to detect cosmic neutrino background via $\\nu^{}_e\n+ {^3}{\\rm H} \\to {^3}{\\rm He} + e^-$. In this talk, I consider a thermal\nproduction of right-handed Dirac neutrinos in the early Universe, and\ninvestigate their impact on the capture rate of cosmic relic neutrinos at\nPTOLEMY.\n", "  Stealth coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are events in which there are almost no\nobservable signatures of the CME eruption in the low corona but often a\nwell-resolved slow flux rope CME observed in the coronagraph data. We present\nresults from a three-dimensional numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulation of the 1--2 June 2008 slow streamer blowout CME that Robbrecht et\nal. (2009) called \"the CME from nowhere.\" We model the global coronal structure\nusing a 1.4 MK isothermal solar wind and a low-order potential field source\nsurface representation of the Carrington Rotation 2070 magnetogram synoptic\nmap. The bipolar streamer belt arcade is energized by simple shearing flows\napplied in the vicinity of the helmet streamer's polarity inversion line. The\nflows are large scale and impart a shear typical of that expected from the\ndifferential rotation. The slow expansion of the energized helmet streamer\narcade results in the formation of a radial current sheet. The subsequent onset\nof expansion-induced flare reconnection initiates the stealth CME while\ngradually releasing the stored magnetic energy. We present favorable\ncomparisons between our simulation results and the multiviewpoint SOHO-LASCO\n(Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph) and STEREO-SECCHI (Sun Earth\nConnection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation) coronagraph observations of\nthe preeruption streamer structure and the initiation and evolution of the\nstealth streamer blowout CME.\n", "  A new experiment, called DeeMe, which is designed to search for $\\mu$-e\nconversions with a sensitivity of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-14})$, is in preparation at\nthe Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). It utilizes a\nhigh-quality pulsed proton beam from the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron at J-PARC.\nThe detector for DeeMe must tolerate large pulses of prompt charged particles\nwhose instantaneous hit rate is as large as 70 GHz/mm$^2$ in a time width of\n200 ns and detect a single electron that arrives with delayed timing on the\norder of microseconds. A special wire chamber has been developed with a new\ndynamic gain control technique that reduces space charge effects. In this\npaper, we detail the novel detector scheme and operation verification.\n", "  Measures of wealth and production have been found to scale superlinearly with\nthe population of a city. Therefore, it makes economic sense for humans to\ncongregate together in dense settlements. A recent model of population dynamics\nshowed that population growth can become superexponential due to the\nsuperlinear scaling of production with population in a city. Here, we\ngeneralize this population dynamics model and demonstrate the existence of\nmultiple stable equilibrium points, showing how population growth can be\nstymied by a poor economic environment. This occurs when the goods and services\nproduced by the city become less profitable due to a lack of diversification in\nthe city's economy. Then, relying on critical slowing down signals related to\nthe stability of an equilibrium point, we present an algorithm for engineering\nregime shifts such that a city at a stable equilibrium point may continue to\ngrow again. The generality of the model and the algorithm used here implies\nthat the model and algorithm need not be restricted to urban systems; they are\neasily applicable to other types of systems where the assumptions used are\nvalid.\n", "  We have constructed a non-Hermitian two-level system (a PT -symmetric system)\nin dissipative environments, and investigated the quantum coherence in the\nnon-Hermitian two-level system. Our results show that, quantum coherence can be\ncreated by PT -symmetric systems, even if the initial state of the twolevel\nsystem is incoherent state. Even though two-level system is interacted with\ndissipative environments, the quantum coherence exhibits a long-lived revival,\nand can be protected. We find that the two-level system can obtain more\ncoherence with the coupling strength {\\Omega} increases. And we should point\nout that the PT -symmetric system can be regarded as a good candidate system\nfor creation of the long-lived quantum coherence in dissipative environments.\n", "  In the frame of the comprehensive knowledge, detection and forecasting of the\nsolar terrestrial relations as well as space weather events, the ground based\nmeasurements of the network of neutron monitor constitutes a vital tool for\nthese studies. This is mainly the reason that Athens Neutron Monitor Station\n(A.Ne.Mo.S.) beyond of the provision of its real time data, has also developed\nseveral research applications. More specifically, applications such as a) an\noptimized automated Ground Level Enhancement Alert (GLE Alert Plus) b) a web\ninterface, providing data from mul- tiple Neutron Monitor stations\n(Multi-Station tool) and c) a simulation model, named DYnamic Atmospheric\nShower Tracking Interactive Model Application (DYASTIMA), which allows the\nstudy of the cosmic ray showers resulted when primary cosmic ray particles\nenters the atmosphere, have been developed. The two first applications are\ncurrently federated products in European Space Agency (ESA) and actually\navailable via the Space Weather Portal operated by ESA. On the other hand, the\ncontribution of the simulation tool DYASTIMA, based on the well known Geant4\ntoolkit, to the calculations of the radiation dose received by air crews and\npassengers within the Earth's atmosphere led us to develop an extended\napplication of DYASTIMA named DYASTIMA-R. This new application calculates the\nenergy that is deposited on the phantom and moreover the equivalent dose.\nFurthermore, a Space Weather Forecasting Center which provides a three day\ngeomagnetic activity report on a daily basis has been set up and is operating\nat the Athens Neutron Monitor Sta- tion. Finally, all above developed services\nare in essential importance for the fundamental research as well as for\npractical applications concerning Space Weather.\n", "  This article describes an interferometric method, called \"Chirped Heterodyne\nInterferometry for Measuring Pulses\" (CHIMP), for the complete characterization\nof highly (monotonically) chirped ultrabroadband optical pulses. CHIMP provides\nthe spectrally dependent group delay dispersion (GDD) of the a chirped test\npulse (CTP) via a simple direct algorithm and is verified via second harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) simulations and experimental measurements of pulses centred at\n800nm with a bandwidth of 55nm stretched to 32ps at the 1% intensity level,\ncorresponding to a time-bandwidth product of 830.\n", "  We present the results of spectroscopic redshift measurements for the galaxy\nclusters from the first all-sky Planck catalogue of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich\nsources, that have been mostly identified by means of the optical observations\nperformed previously by our team (Planck Collaboration, 2015a). The data on 13\ngalaxy clusters at redshifts from z=~0.2 to z=~0.8, including the improved\nidentification and redshift measurement for the cluster PSZ1 G141.73+14.22 at\nz=0.828, are provided. The measurements were done using the data from\nRussian-Turkish 1.5-m telescope (RTT-150), 2.2-m Calar Alto Observatory\ntelescope, and 6-m SAO RAS telescope (Bolshoy Teleskop Azimutalnyi, BTA).\n", "  High-resolution mid-infrared observations of astrospheres show that many of\nthem have filamentary (cirrus-like) structure. Using numerical models of dust\ndynamics in astrospheres, we suggest that their filamentary structure might be\nrelated to specific spatial distribution of the interstellar dust around the\nstars, caused by a gyrorotation of charged dust grains in the interstellar\nmagnetic filed. Our numerical model describes the dust dynamics in astrospheres\nunder an influence of the Lorentz force and assumption of a constant dust\ncharge. Calculations are performed for the dust grains with different sizes\nseparately. It is shown that non-monotonic spatial dust distribution (viewed as\nfilaments) appears for dust grains with the period of gyromotion comparable\nwith the characteristic time scale of the dust motion in the astrosphere.\nNumerical modelling demonstrates that number of filaments depends on\ncharge-to-mass ratio of dust.\n", "  We give the explicit formulas of the flag curvatures of left invariant\nMatsumoto and Kropina metrics of Berwald type. We can see these formulas are\ndifferent from previous results given recently. Using these formulas, we prove\nthat at any point of an arbitrary connected non-commutative nilpotent Lie\ngroup, the flag curvature of any left invariant Matsumoto and Kropina metrics\nof Berwald type admits zero, positive and negative values, this is a\ngeneralization of Wolf's theorem. Then we study $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-metrics of\nBerwald type and also Randers metrics of Douglas type on two interesting\nfamilies of Lie groups considered by Milnor and Kaiser, containing Heisenberg\nLie groups. On these spaces, we present some necessary and sufficient\nconditions for $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-metrics to be of Berwald type and also some\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for Randers metrics to be of Douglas type.\nAll left invariant non-Berwaldian Randers metrics of Douglas type are given and\nthe flag curvatures are computed.\n", "  In this thesis we are interested in understanding how Lorentz symmetry\nviolation can affect some features of fermion dynamics and, perhaps, help to\nsolve some well-known problems in particle physics, such as the origin of\nneutrino masses and oscillations.\n  Firstly, we consider two Lorentz-Invariance-Violating (LIV) models and\ninvestigate the possibility of generating masses and oscillations dynamically\nfor both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos, using non-perturbative methods, such as\nthe Schwinger-Dyson and the effective potential approaches. In our studies,\nLorentz symmetric models are extended by the inclusion of higher-order LIV\noperators, which improve the convergence of loop integrals and introduce a\nnatural mass scale to the theories. We then present how Lorentz invariance can\nbe recovered, for both models, after quantisation, in such a way that the\ndynamical masses and mixing are the only quantum effects that remain finite.\n  Additionally, we study how matter fields, especially fermions, behave when\ncoupled to two modified gravity models. Such modified gravity models break the\n4-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and, consequently, induce local Lorentz\nviolation. In particular, we consider Horava-Lifshitz gravity, which presents\nan improved ultraviolet behaviour when compared to General Relativity (GR), and\nthus addresses a fundamental problem in physics: the\nnon-(perturbative-)renormalisability of the theory of GR. We calculate the LIV\none-loop corrections to the matter sector dispersion relations, after\nintegration over graviton components, and show that, by imposing reasonable\nconstraints on the energy scales of our gravity models, our results are\nconsistent with the current bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation.\n", "  The study of human mobility patterns is of both theoretical and practical\nvalues in many aspects. For long-distance travels, a few research endeavors\nhave shown that the displacements of human travels follow the power-law\ndistribution. However, controversies remain in the issue of the scaling law of\nhuman mobility in intra-urban areas. In this work we focus on the mobility\npattern of taxi passengers by examining five datasets of the three\nmetropolitans of New York, Dalian and Nanjing. Through statistical analysis, we\nfind that the lognormal distribution with a power-law tail can best approximate\nboth the displacement and the duration time of taxi trips, as well as the\nvacant time of taxicabs, in all the examined cities. The universality of\nscaling law of human mobility is subsequently discussed, in accordance with the\ndata analytics.\n", "  Recently proposed formulation of the Boundary Element Method for adhesive\ncontacts has been generalized for contacts of functionally graded materials\nwith and without adhesion. First, proceeding from the fundamental solution for\nsingle force acting on the surface of a half space with a power-law varying\nelastic modulus, the deformation produced by constant pressure acting on a\nrectangular element was calculated and the influence matrix was obtained for a\nrectangular grid. The inverse problem for the calculation of required stress in\ncontact area from a known surface deformation was solved by use of\nconjugate-gradient technique. For the transformation between the stresses and\ndisplacements, the Fast Fourier Transformation is used which drastically\nreduces the computation time. For the adhesive contact of graded material, the\ndetachment criterion based on the method of Pohrt and Popov was proposed. A\nnumber of numerical test for the problem having exact analytical solution have\nbeen carried out confirming the correctness of underlying ideas and numerical\nimplementation.\n", "  Entanglement distribution between distant parties is an essential component\nto most quantum communication protocols. Unfortunately, decoherence effects\nsuch as phase noise in optical fibers are known to demolish entanglement.\nIterative (multistep) entanglement distillation protocols have long been\nproposed to overcome decoherence, but their probabilistic nature makes them\ninefficient since the success probability decays exponentially with the number\nof steps. Quantum memories have been contemplated to make entanglement\ndistillation practical, but suitable quantum memories are not realised to date.\nHere, we present the theory for an efficient iterative entanglement\ndistillation protocol without quantum memories and provide a proof-of-principle\nexperimental demonstration. The scheme is applied to phase-diffused\ntwo-mode-squeezed states and proven to distill entanglement for up to three\niteration steps. The data are indistinguishable from those an efficient scheme\nusing quantum memories would produce. Since our protocol includes the final\nmeasurement it is particularly promising for enhancing continuous-variable\nquantum key distribution.\n", "  In this review, we attempt to present the most notable aspects of the story\nof the two chain, highly one-dimensional, organic conductors of the perylene\nmetal-dithiolate series, which have been under investigation since the end of\nthe 1960's until the present time, with the recent discovery of a\nsuperconducting phase. We will start with an overview of the developments of\nthe research on this materials and then, after a brief introduction and a\nsurvey of the theoretical background, we will describe and discuss the\nstructure, transport and magnetic properties, as well as the low temperature\ninstabilities and phase transitions. Finally we will focus on the study of\ntheir behaviour under extreme conditions of low temperatures, high pressures\nand high magnetic fields up to 45 tesla.\n", "  Riemannian Manifolds may be $C^{1,1}$ and the geometry of these manifolds is\ninvestigated in \\cite{Groah1}. Here, a similar analysis is given for\npseudohermitian, torsion-free manifolds whereby, instead of assuming that the\nmetric is parallel, it is assumed that the metric is pseudohermitian, a\ncondition adopted by Einstein and elaborated upon in \\cite{Hlavaty}. At the\nlevel of regularity assumed here, Einstein's formulation of the pseudohermitian\ncondition is not tensorial and so a reformulation of this condition is given\nhere. It is shown that a $C^{1,1}$ manifold is pseudohermitian and torsion-free\nif and only if it is Riemannian.\n", "  We study an asymptotic behaviour of parametric autoresonance for non-linear\nequation. Main result of this work is statement about asymptotic behaviour of\nmeasure for captured trajectories. To find this we obtain an asymptotic\nexpansion for capture and asymptotic behaviour of splitted separatrices for\nintermediate small amplitudes.\n", "  We use first-principles calculations to investigate the band structure\nevolution of W$X_2$/Mo$X_2$ ($X$ = S, Se) heterobilayers under a perpendicular\nelectric field. We characterize the extent to which the type-II band alignment\nin these compounds can be tuned or inverted electrostatically. Our results\ndemonstrate two effects of stacking configuration. First, different stackings\nproduce different net dipole moments, resulting in band offset variations that\nare larger than 0.1 eV. Second, based on symmetry constraints that depend on\nstacking, a perpendicular electric field may hybridize W$X_2$ and Mo$X_2$ bands\nthat cross at the Brillouin Zone corner $K$. Our results suggest that external\nelectric fields can be used to tune the physics of intralayer and interlayer\nexcitons in heterobilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  The quark chromo-electric dipole moment operator and the pseudo-scalar\nfermion bilinear with which it mixes under renormalization can both be included\nin a calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon using the\nSchwinger source method. A preliminary calculation of these operators using\nclover quarks on HISQ lattices generated by MILC collaboration will be\npresented showing the quality of the signal in the correlators necessary for\ncalculating the neutron electric dipole moment.\n", "  AMS-02 is a wide acceptance high-energy physics experiment installed on the\nInternational Space Station in May 2011 and operating continuously since then.\nUsing the largest number of detected particles in space of any space-borne\nexperiment, it performs precision measurements of galactic cosmic rays fluxes.\nDetailed time variation studies of Protons, Heliums, Electron and Positron\nfluxes were presented. The low-rigidity range exhibits a decreasing general\ntrend strongly related to the increase of solar activity, as well local\ndecreases associated with strong solar events.\n", "  HIV-1 virions assemble as immature particles containing Gag polyproteins that\nare processed by the viral protease into individual components, resulting in\nthe formation of mature infectious particles. There are two competing models\nfor the process of forming the mature HIV-1 core: the disassembly and de novo\nreassembly model and the non-diffusional displacive model. To study the\nmaturation pathway, we simulate HIV-1 maturation in vitro by digesting immature\nparticles and assembled virus-like particles with recombinant HIV-1 protease\nand monitor the process with biochemical assays and cryoEM structural analysis\nin parallel. Processing of Gag in vitro is accurate and efficient and results\nin both soluble capsid protein and conical or tubular capsid assemblies,\nseemingly converted from immature Gag particles. Computer simulations further\nreveal probable assembly pathways of HIV-1 capsid formation. Combining the\nexperimental data and computer simulations, our results suggest a sequential\ncombination of both displacive and disassembly/reassembly processes for HIV-1\nmaturation.\n", "  HelMod is a code evaluating the transport of Galactic cosmic rays through the\ninner heliosphere down to Earth. It is based on a 2-D Monte Carlo approach and\nincludes a general description of the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the\ndiffusion tensor, thus, properly treating the particle drift effects. The model\nhas been tuned in order to fit the data observed outside the ecliptic plane at\nseveral distances from the Earth and the spectra observed near the Earth for\nboth, high and low solar activity levels. A stand-alone python module, fully\ncompatible with GalProp, was developed for a comprehensive calculation of solar\nmodulation effects, resulting in a newly suggested set of local interstellar\nspectra.\n", "  Efficient replication and assembly of virus particles are integral to the\nestablishment of infection. In addition to the primary role of the capsid\nprotein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on\npositive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates\nRNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that replication of Satellite tobacco\nmosaic virus (STMV) is controlled by the cooperative interaction between STMV\nCP and the helper virus (HV) Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replicase. We\nidentified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively\ncharged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa)\nmotif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between\nHV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine\nsubstitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP\nbinding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for\npositively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective\nin packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the\n3' terminal 150 nt region. These findings provide insights into the mechanism\nunderlying the regulation of STMV replication and packaging.\n", "  In the current work we present a new modelling approach for simulating\nmeso-scopic phenomena related to lubrication of the piston ring-cylinder liner\ncontact. Our geometry allows a variable confinement gap and a varying amount of\nlubricant in the gap, while avoiding the squeeze-out of the lubricant into\nvacuum. We have implemented a coarse grain molecular dynamics description of an\nionic liquid as a lubricant which can expand into lateral reservoirs. The\nresults have revealed two regimes of lubrication, an elasto-hydrodynamic one\nunder low loads and one with low, velocity-independent specific friction, under\nhigh loads. The observed steep rise of normal forces at small plate-to-plate\ndistances is an interesting behaviour that could potentially be exploited for\npreventing solid-solid contact and wear.\n", "  The enchanting Dirac fermions in graphene stimulated us to seek for other\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Dirac materials, and boron monolayers may be a good\ncandidate. So far, a number of monolayer boron sheets have been theoretically\npredicted, and three have been experimentally prepared. However, none of them\npossesses Dirac electrons. Herein, by means of density functional theory (DFT)\ncomputations, we identified a new boron monolayer, namely hr-sB, with two types\nof Dirac fermions coexisting in the sheet: one type is related to Dirac nodal\nlines traversing Brillouin zone (BZ) with velocities approaching 106 m/s, the\nother is related to tilted semi-Dirac cones with strong anisotropy. This newly\npredicted boron monolayer consists of hexagon and rhombus stripes. With an\nexceptional stability comparable to the experimentally achieved boron sheets,\nit is rather optimistic to grow hr-sB on some suitable substrates such as the\nAg (111) surface. The unique electronic properties induced by special bond\ncharacteristics also imply that this boron monolayer may be a good\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Recently, type-II Dirac fermions characterized by strongly titled Dirac cones\nhave been proposed. The new fermions exhibit unique physical properties\ndifferent from the type-I Dirac fermions in graphene, and thus attract\ntremendous attentions. Up to date, all type-II fermions are only found in the\nheavy compounds with strong spin obit coupling. Here, we propose that both\ntype-I and type-II Dirac fermions can exist in the graphene embedding\nnitrogen-molecule line defects (NMLDs). While the types of Dirac fermions are\ndetermined by the size W of graphene nanoribbons between the line defects. By\ncomparing the two types of Dirac fermions, their different physical properties\nand originations are revealed directly. Remarkably, the type-I Dirac points\ninduce one Fermi arc corresponding to edge states along the armchair direction,\nwhile the type-II Dirac points induce two Fermi arcs corresponding to two sets\nof edge states along the zigzag direction. These results not only expand our\nviews on the Dirac fermions in two-dimensional structures, but also extend\ntheir applications in electronics.\n", "  Dynamical error suppression techniques are commonly used to improve coherence\nin quantum systems. They reduce dephasing errors by applying control pulses\ndesigned to reverse erroneous coherent evolution driven by environmental noise.\nHowever, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy\nrelaxation. In this work, we investigate a complementary, stochastic approach\nto reducing errors: instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit\nevolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In\nthe context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to\nreduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to\nthe device. We report a 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density, resulting\nin a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times, and a comparable\nreduction in coherence variability.\n", "  Coupled, dynamical spin-lattice models provide a unique test ground for\nsimulations investigating the finite-temperature magnetic properties of\nmaterials under the direct influence of the lattice vibrations. These models\nare constructed by combining a coordinate-dependent interatomic potential with\na Heisenberg-like spin Hamiltonian, facilitating the treatment of both the\natomic coordinates and spins as explicit phase variables. Using a model\nparameterized for bcc iron, we study the magnetic phase transition in these\ncomplex systems via the recently introduced, massively parallel\nreplica-exchange Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method. Comparison with the results\nobtained from rigid lattice (spin only) simulations show that the transition\ntemperature as well as the amplitude of the peak in the specific heat curve is\nmarginally affected by the lattice vibrations. Moreover, the results were found\nto be sensitive to the particular choice of the interatomic potential.\n", "  We employ data from the recently observed high-energy neutrino events at the\nIceCube Neutrino Observatory to constrain interactions between the dark matter\n(DM) in the Milky Way and the neutrino sector. We construct an extended\nun-binned likelihood in order to explore the parameter space of allowed\ninteractions. We present results in the specific case of a scalar DM candidate\ninteracting via a scalar mediator, and show that due to the energy dependence\nof the interaction cross section, this approach can constrain the coupling more\nstrongly than traditional cosmological probes for some regions of the parameter\nspace.\n", "  The light emitting diode (LED) nonlinearities distortion induced degradation\nin the performance of visible light communication (VLC) systems can be\ncontrolled by optimizing the DC bias point of the LED. In this paper, we\ntheoretically analyze and experimentally demonstrate the effect of white LED DC\nbias on nonlinear modulation bandwidth and dynamic range of the VLC system. The\nlinear dynamic range is enhanced by using series-connected LED chips, and the\nmodulation bandwidth is extended to 40 MHz by post-equalization without using a\nblue filter. The experimental results well match the theoretical model of LED\nnonlinear modulation characteristics. The results show that the modulation\nbandwidth increases and saturates with an increase in LED DC bias current due\nto nonlinear effect of carrier lifetime and junction capacitance. The optimized\nDC-bias current that corresponds to the minimum BER increases with the increase\nof data rate. A 60-Mbps NRZ transmission can be achieved with BER threshold of\n10-3 by properly adjusting LED DC bias point.\n", "  Lattice thermal conductivities (LTCs) of \\alpha-, \\beta-, and\n\\gamma-Si$_3$N$_4$ single crystals are investigated from ab initio anharmonic\nlattice dynamics, within the single-mode relaxation-time approximation of the\nlinearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. At a temperature of 300 K, a\n\\kappa$_{xx}$ of 70 and a \\kappa$_{zz}$ of 98 (in units of Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$)\nare obtained for \\alpha-Si$_3$N$_4$. For \\beta-Si$_3$N$_4$, \\kappa$_{xx}$ and\n\\kappa$_{zz}$ are found to be 71 and 194, respectively, which are consistent\nwith the reported experimental values of 69 and 180 for individual\n\\beta-Si$_3$N$_4$ grains in a ceramic. The theoretical \\kappa$_{xx}$ values of\n\\alpha- and \\beta-Si$_3$N$_4$ are comparable, while the \\kappa$_{zz}$ value of\n\\beta-Si$_3$N$_4$ is almost twice that of \\alpha-Si$_3$N$_4$, which\ndemonstrates the very large anisotropy in the LTC of the \\beta phase. It is\nfound that the large anisotropy in the LTC of \\beta-Si$_3$N$_4$ was caused by\nthe elongated Brillouin zone along the c* axis, where the acoustic phonons\nmostly contribute to LTC and have large group velocities even near the\nBrillouin zone boundary. The LTC of \\gamma-Si$_3$N$_4$ is 81, which is as small\nas that of \\alpha-Si$_3$N$_4$, although \\gamma-Si$_3$N$_4$ has much larger\nelastic constants. This means that elastic constants are not always a good\nindicator of LTC. We show that knowing the detailed distributions of both the\ngroup velocities and phonon lifetimes in the Brillouin zones is important for\ncharacterizing the LTC of the three phases.\n", "  We developed highly-sensitive image-current detection systems based on\nsuperconducting toroidal coils and ultra-low noise amplifiers for\nnon-destructive measurements of the axial frequencies (550$\\sim$800$\\,$kHz) of\nsingle antiprotons stored in a cryogenic multi-Penning-trap system. The\nunloaded superconducting tuned circuits show quality factors of up to\n500$\\,$000, which corresponds to a factor of 10 improvement compared to our\npreviously used solenoidal designs. Connected to ultra-low noise amplifiers and\nthe trap system, signal-to-noise-ratios of 30$\\,$dB at quality factors of >\n20$\\,$000 are achieved. In addition, we have developed a superconducting switch\nwhich allows continuous tuning of the detector's quality factor, and to\nsensitively tune the particle-detector interaction. This allowed us to improve\nfrequency resolution at constant averaging time, which is crucial for single\nantiproton spin-transition spectroscopy experiments, as well as improved\nmeasurements of the proton-to-antiproton charge-to-mass ratio.\n", "  The main resonance frequency is shown to depend on the initial conditions of\nthe electron, and in particular on its initial transversal coordinate xo. This\ndependence is shown to give rise to a very strong inhomogeneous broadening of\nthe spectral lines. The broadening can become large enough for the spectral\nlines to overlap with each other. The spectral intensity of a spontaneous\nemission is averaged over xo. The averaged spectral intensity is shown to have\nonly a very weakly expressed resonance structure.\n", "  The research of one-dimensional Ising model with the different number of\nneighbors and the different sign of the exchange integral were performed.\nMagnetization shows the transition from disorder to order (in finite systems)\nonly at positive exchange integral $J$ but clustered order parameter describes\nthe transition regardless of the sign of the exchange integral and the number\nof neighbors.\n", "  We study the phase transition from Mott insulator (MI) to Bose glass (BG) of\na disordered Bose-Hubbard model within the framework of Ginzburg-Landau\neffective action approach. By treating MI as unperturbed ground state and\nperforming a systematic expansion with respect to tunneling matrix element, we\nextend such a field-theoretic method into the disordered lattice Bose systems.\nTo the lowest order, a second order phase transition is confirmed to happen\nhere and the corresponding phase boundary equation coincides with the previous\nmean-field approximation result. Keeping all the terms second order in hopping\nparameter, we obtain the beyond mean-field results of MI-BG phase boundary of\n2D and 3D disordered Bose-Hubbard models. Our analytic predictions are in\nagreement with recent semianalytic results.\n", "  We propose a powerful extension to combined molecular and spin dynamics that\nfully captures the coupling between the atomic and spin subsystems via\nspin-orbit interactions. Its foundation is the inclusion of the local magnetic\nanisotropies that arise as a consequence of the lattice symmetry breaking due\nto phonons or defects. We demonstrate that our extension enables the exchange\nof angular momentum between the atomic and spin subsystems, which is critical\nto the challenges arising in the study of fluctuations and non-equilibrium\nprocesses in complex, natural, and engineered magnetic materials.\n", "  We theoretically investigated the dependence of higher-order harmonic\ngeneration (HHG) in solid-state materials on the ellipticity of the electric\nfield. We found that in the multiphoton absorption and ac Zener regimes, the\nintensity of HHG monotonically decreases with increasing ellipticity of the\nincident electric field, while in the semimetal regime, the intensity reaches a\nmaximum for finite values of ellipticity. Moreover, the characteristics of the\npolarization of the emitted HHG change depending on the field intensity; only\nparallel emissions with respect to the major axis exist in the multiphoton\nabsorption and ac Zener regimes, while both parallel and perpendicular\nemissions exist in the semimetal regime. These peculiar characteristics of the\nsemimetal regime can be understood on the basis of changes in the HHG mechanism\nand may be able to be identified in experiments utilizing solid-state materials\nsuch as narrow-gap semiconductors.\n", "  One-dimensional Cr2NO2 nanoribbons cutting from the oxygen-passivated Cr2NO2\nMXene are investigated by using density functional theory. The wide nanoribbons\nhave ferromagnetic ground states and are half-metals, independent of their\nchirality. The half-metallic band gaps of the wide nanoribbons are larger than\n1 eV, which are large enough for avoiding thermally activated spin flip. The\nmagnetism does not rely on the edge states but originates from all the Cr\natoms. Furthermore, the half-metallicity is still robust in an electronic\ndevice even if the bias is up to 1 V. Therefore, one-dimensional Cr2NO2\nnanoribbons are good candidates for spintronics.\n", "  We present quantum Lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Dirac equation for\nquantum-relativistic particles with random mass. By choosing zero-average\nrandom mass fluctuation, the simulations show evidence of localization and\nultra-slow Sinai diffusion, due to the interference of oppositely propagating\nbranches of the quantum wavefunction which result from random sign changes of\nthe mass around a zero-mean. The present results indicate that the quantum\nlattice Boltzmann scheme may offer a viable tool for the numerical simulation\nof quantum-relativistic transport phenomena in topological materials.\n", "  We consider the solvability of the Fokker-Planck equation with both\ntime-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients by means of the similarity\nmethod. By the introduction of the similarity variable, the Fokker-Planck\nequation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation. Adopting the natural\nrequirement that the probability current density vanishes at the boundary, the\nresulting ordinary differential equation turns out to be integrable, and the\nprobability density function can be given in closed form. New examples of\nexactly solvable Fokker-Planck equations are presented.\n", "  We describe a hybrid agent-based model and simulation of urban morphogenesis.\nIt consists of a cellular automata grid coupled to a dynamic network topology.\nThe inherently heterogeneous properties of urban structure and function are\ntaken into account in the dynamics of the system. We propose various layout and\nperformance measures to categorize and explore the generated configurations. An\neconomic evaluation metric was also designed using the sensitivity of\nsegregation models to spatial configuration. Our model is applied to a\nreal-world case, offering a means to optimize the distribution of activities in\na zoning context.\n", "  High temperature superconducting coated conductor (CC) could be practically\napplied in electric equipment due to its favorable mechanical properties and\nthe critical current performance of YBCO superconducting layer. It is well\nknown that CC could be easily delaminated because of its poor stress tolerance\nin thickness direction, i.e. along the c-axis of YBCO. Commonly, a stack\nincluding YBCO layer and silver stabilizer could be obtained after the\ndelamination. It would be interesting to investigate the superconducting\nproperties of the delaminated stack, since it could also be considered as a new\ntype of CC with the silver stabilizer as the buffer layer, which is quite\ndifferent from the oxide buffer layers in the traditional CC and might lead to\nnew applications. In this study, a CC sample was delaminated by liquid nitrogen\nimmersing. A Hall probe scanning system was employed to measure the critical\ncurrent (IC) distribution of the original sample and the obtained stack. It was\nfound that IC could be partially preserved after the delamination. Dense and\ncrack-free morphologies of the delaminated surfaces were observed by scanning\nelectron microscopy, and the potential application of the obtained stack in\nsuperconducting joint technology was discussed.\n", "  The computational complexity conjecture of NP $\\nsubseteq$ BQP implies that\nthere should be an exponentially small energy gap for Quantum Annealing (QA) of\nNP-hard problems. We aim to verify how this computation originated gapless\npoint could be understood based on physics, using the quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod. As a result, we found a phase transition detectable only by the\ndivergence of fidelity susceptibility. The exponentially small gapless points\nof each instance are all located in the phase found in this study, which\nsuggests that this phase transition is the physical cause of the failure of QA\nfor NP-hard problems.\n", "  The innovation process is always required to produce more advanced technology\nand increasing productivity. PDM (Probes Distance Meter) comes as a\ntechnological innovation in measurement, PDM is a digital distance measuring\ninstrument uses a pair of probes. PDM consists of ultrasonic transducers, a\nmicrocontroller, and screen which shows the measurement result. PDM utilizes\nultrasonic wave principle by using two probes as reference points. A\nmicrocontroller is used for performing calculation that uses the distance\nequation. Innovation and Excellence of PDM are simple, ergonomic, modern, and\nable to show the measurement result automatically. PDM has additional features\nthose are the storage media to save the measurement result with a micro-SD\ncard, sound generation, and braille for the blinds. Those tools are expected to\nbe suitable for common people, academics, or technicians to perform the\nmeasurement. The results from the laboratory testing show that the prototype of\nPDM has resolution of 1 cm, full scale of 200 cm, 11.1% repeatability, 77.6%\naccuracy, and a nonlinearity parameter of 0.16%. PDM is in development and it\nis potential to be a model of digital measuring instrument in the future that\nis simple, fast, and its additional features are capable to be used by the\nblind.\n", "  A precision measurement of the proton flux in primary cosmic rays with\nrigidity from 1 GV to 1.8 TV is presented based on 300 million events. The\nresults show that the proton flux is smooth and exhibits no sharp structures\nwith rigidity. The detailed variation with rigidity of the flux spectral index\nis presented. The spectral index is progressively hardening at high rigidities.\nSolar effects are also discussed.\n", "  We obtain a pair of second order differential equations in two variables $x$\nand $t$ from the coupled DGLAP QCD evolution equations at small $x$ using the\nstandard Taylor series expansion method.To that end we keep terms upto $O(x^2\n)$.We use the standard assumption about the relationship between the singlet\nStructure Function and the gluon distributions available in current literature.\nWe solve the taylor approximated $O(x)$ DGLAP equations by Lagrange's auxiliary\nmethod and $O(x^2)$ equation by Method of Separation of Variables and then show\nthat the two solutions obtained in each for $O(x)$ and $O(x^2)$ are not\nidentical in general.Analysis of the results obtained are done in the range of\nthe recent HERA data.\n", "  A simple protocol for complete and deterministic Bell state measurement is\nproposed. It consists of measurements of nonlocal spin product operators with\nthe help of shared entanglement as an ancillary resource. The protocol realizes\nnot only nonlocal Bell state measurement between a pair of distant qubits but\nalso a complete Bell filter that transmits either one of the Bell states\nindicated by the measurement outcome. These schemes will be useful in quantum\ntechnologies where nonlocal Bell state measurement is indispensable.\n", "  By a detector, one has in mind a point particle with internal energy levels,\nwhich when set in motion on a generic trajectory can get excited due to its\ninteraction with a quantum field. Detectors have often been considered as a\nhelpful tool to understand the concept of a particle in a curved spacetime.\nSpecifically, they have been used extensively to investigate the thermal\neffects that arise in the presence of horizons. In this article, I review the\nconcept of detectors and discuss their response when they are coupled linearly\nas well as non-linearly to a quantum scalar field in different situations. In\nparticular, I discuss as to how the response of detectors does not necessarily\nreflect the particle content of the quantum field. I also describe an\ninteresting `inversion of statistics' that occurs in odd spacetime dimensions\nfor `odd couplings', i.e. the response of a uniformly accelerating detector is\ncharacterized by a Fermi-Dirac distribution even when it is interacting with a\nscalar field. Moreover, by coupling the detector to a quantum field that is\ngoverned by a modified dispersion relation arising supposedly due to quantum\ngravitational effects, I examine the possible Planck scale modifications to the\nresponse of a rotating detector in flat spacetime. Lastly, I discuss as to why\ndetectors that are switched on for a finite period of time need to be turned on\nsmoothly in order to have a meaningful response.\n", "  We study the driven translocation of a semi-flexible polymer through a\nnanopore by means of a modified version of the iso-flux tension propagation\ntheory (IFTP), and extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that\nin contrast to fully flexible chains, for semi-flexible polymers with a finite\npersistence length $\\tilde{\\ell}_p$ the {\\it trans} side friction must be\nexplicitly taken into account to properly describe the translocation process.\nIn addition, the scaling of the end-to-end distance $R_N$ as a function of the\nchain length $N$ must be known. To this end, we first derive a semi-analytic\nscaling form for $R_N$, which reproduces the limits of a rod, an ideal chain,\nand an excluded volume chain in the appropriate limits. We then quantitatively\ncharacterize the nature of the {\\it trans} side friction based on MD\nsimulations of semi-flexible chains. Augmented with these two factors, the\nmodified IFTP theory shows that there are three main regimes for the scaling of\nthe average translocation time $\\tau \\propto N^{\\alpha}$. In the stiff chain\n(rod) limit $N/\\tilde{\\ell}_p \\ll 1$, {$\\alpha = 2$}, which continuously\ncrosses over in the regime $ 1 < N/\\tilde{\\ell}_p < 4$ towards the ideal chain\nbehavior with {$\\alpha = 3/2$}, which is reached in the regime\n$N/\\tilde{\\ell}_p \\sim 10^2$. Finally, in the limit $N/\\tilde{\\ell}_p \\gg 10^6$\nthe translocation exponent approaches its symptotic value $1+\\nu$, where $\\nu$\nis the Flory exponent. Our results are in good agreement with available\nsimulations and experimental data.\n", "  This is an entry for Physics Today's recent essay contest, written as a\n\"Search and Discovery\" news story, imagining what major breakthroughs might be\nshaking the physics world one hundred years from now.\n", "  Fibrous networks are ideal functional materials since they provide mechanical\nrigidity at low weight. Such structures are omnipresent in natural biomaterials\nfrom cells to tissues, as well as in man-made materials from polymeric\ncomposites to paper and textiles. Here, we demonstrate that fibrous networks of\nthe blood clotting protein fibrin undergo a strong and irreversible increase in\ntheir mechanical rigidity in response to compression. This rigidification can\nbe precisely predetermined from the level of applied compressive strain,\nproviding a means to program the network rigidity without having to change its\ncomposition. To identify the mechanism underlying this programmable\nrigidification, we measure single fiber-fiber interactions using optical\ntweezers. We further develop a minimal computational model of adhesive fiber\nnetworks that shows that load-induced bond formation can explain the adaptation\nof the fibrin networks to compressive loading. The model predicts that the\nnetwork stiffness after compressive programming obeys a universal power-law\ndependence on the prestress built in by new bond formation, which we confirm\nexperimentally. The generality of this functional stiffening mechanism together\nwith our ability to quantitatively predict it provides a new powerful approach\nto program the stiffness of fibrous materials and dynamically adapt them to\ndifferent loading conditions.\n", "  Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (CLLDF) in Extensive Air\nShowers (EAS) for different primary particles (e-, n , p, F, K and Fe) was\nsimulated using CORSIKA code for conditions and configurations of Yakutsk EAS\narray with the fixed primary energy 3 PeV around the knee region at different\nzenith angles. Basing on the results of CLLDF numerical simulation, sets of\napproximated functions are reconstructed for different primary particles as a\nfunction of the zenith angle. A comparison of the parameterized CLLDF with that\nsimulated with Yakutsk EAS array is verified. The parameterized CLLDF also is\ncompared with that measured on the Yakutsk EAS array.\n", "  Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (CLLDF) simulation was\nfulfilled using CORSIKA code for configurations of Tunka EAS array of different\nzenith angles. The parameterization of the CLLDF was carried out as a function\nof the distance from the shower core in extensive air showers (EAS) and zenith\nangle on the basis of the CORSIKA simulation of primary proton around the knee\nregion with the energy 3.10^15 eV at different zenith angles. The parameterized\nCLLDF is verified in comparison with the simulation that performed using\nCORSIKA code for two zenith angles.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Consortium is developing the new\ngeneration of ground observatories for the detection of ultra-high energy\ngamma-rays. The Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) is participating to\nthe R&D of a possible solution for the Cherenkov photon cameras based on\nSilicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) detectors sensitive to Near Ultraviolet (NUV)\nenergies. The latest NUV-HD SiPM technology achieved by the collaboration of\nINFN with Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) is based on\n$30\\mu\\mbox{m}\\times30\\mu\\mbox{m}$ micro-cell sensors arranged in a\n$6\\times6\\;\\mbox{mm}^2$ area. Single SiPMs produced by FBK have been tested and\ntheir performances have been found to be suitable to equip the CTA cameras.\nCurrently, INFN is developing the concept, mechanics and electronics for\nprototype modules made of 64 NUV-HD SiPMs intended to equip a possible update\nof the CTA Prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT) telescope. The\nperformances of NUV-HD SiPMs and the design and tests of multi-SiPM modules are\nreviewed in this contribution.\n", "  Today's unrelenting increase in demand for information processing creates the\nneed for novel computing concepts. Reservoir computing is such a concept that\nlends itself particularly well to photonic hardware implementations. Over\nrecent years, these hardware implementations have gained maturity and now\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. However,\nimplementations so far are essentially all based on sequential data processing,\nleaving the inherent parallelism of photonics unexploited. Parallel\nimplementations process all neurons simultaneously, and therefore have the\npotential of reducing computation time by a factor equal to the number of\nneurons, compared to sequential architectures. Here, we report a parallel\nreservoir computer that uses frequency domain multiplexing of neuron states. We\nillustrate its performance on standard benchmark tasks such as nonlinear\nchannel equalization, the reproduction of a nonlinear 10th-order system, and\nspeech recognition, obtaining error rates similar to previous optical\nexperiments. The present experiment is thus an important step towards high\nspeed, low footprint, all optical photonic information processing.\n", "  Operations on a pair of entangled qubits are conventionally presented as the\napplication of the tensor product of operations. The tensor product is linearly\nextended to act synchronously across the entire entangled system. When\nsimulating an entangled system, the conventional approach is possible and\npractical if both parts of the entangled system exist within the same physical\nsimulator. However, if we wish to simulate an entangled system across a\ndistributed network, sending half of the entangled pair to another simulator on\nanother computer system, the synchronous approach becomes difficult. In the\nfirst part of this paper, we demonstrate a method of simulating operations on\nentangled states in a distributed environment which is equivalent to the\nconventional approach. The advantage to our approach is that we can simulate\ndistributed quantum systems on physically distributed hardware. Such a system\nadvances the possibilities of demonstrating distributed quantum algorithms for\nresearch, teaching, and learning.\n  Further, the security of quantum key exchange depends on successfully\ndetecting the presence of an eavesdropper. In most cases this is done by\ncomparing the errors introduced by an eavesdropper with the channel error rate.\nIn other words, the communicating parties must tolerate some errors without\nlosing a significant amount of key information. In the second part of this\npaper, we characterize the effects of amplitude damping errors on quantum key\ndistribution protocols and explore allowable tolerances. Through simulations we\nobserve that the effect of these errors, in some cases, is highly dependent on\nwhere the eavesdropper is located on the channel.\n  In this paper, we also briefly describe the development of a new quantum\nsimulation library called QooSim.\n", "  We develop a model for a random walker with long-range hops on general\ngraphs. This random multi-hopper jumps from a node to any other node in the\ngraph with a probability that decays as a function of the shortest-path\ndistance between the two nodes. We consider here two decaying functions in the\nform of the Laplace and Mellin transforms of the shortest-path distances.\nRemarkably, when the parameters of these transforms approach zero\nasymptotically, the multi-hopper's hitting times between any two nodes in the\ngraph converge to their minimum possible value, given by the hitting times of a\nnormal random walker on a complete graph. Stated differently, for small\nparameter values the multi-hopper explores a general graph as fast as possible\nwhen compared to a random walker on a full graph. Using computational\nexperiments we show that compared to the normal random walker, the multi-hopper\nindeed explores graphs with clusters or skewed degree distributions more\nefficiently for a large parameter range. We provide further computational\nevidence of the speed-up attained by the random multi-hopper model with respect\nto the normal random walker by studying deterministic, random and real-world\nnetworks.\n", "  The search of new two-dimensional (2D) materials with novel optical and\nelectronic properties is always desirable for material development. Here, we\nreport a comprehensive theoretical prediction of 2D SiC compounds with\ndifferent stoichiometries from C-rich to Si-rich. Besides the previously known\nhexagonal SiC sheet, we identified two types of hitherto-unknown structural\nmotifs with distinctive bonding features. The first type of 2D SiC monolayer,\nincluding t-SiC and t-Si$_2$C sheet, can be described by tetragonal lattice.\nAmong them,t-SiC monolayer sheet is featured by each carbon atom binds with\nfour neighboring silicon atoms in almost the same plane, constituting a\nquasi-planar four-coordinated rectangular moiety. More interestingly, our\ncalculations demonstrate that this structure exhibits a strain-dependent\ninsulator-semimetal transition, suggesting promising applications in\nstrain-dependent optoelectronic sensors. The second type of 2D SiC sheet is\nfeatured by silagraphyne with acetylenic linkages(-C$\\equiv$C-). Silagraphyne\nshows both high pore sizes and Poisson's ratio. These properties make them a\npotentially important material for applications in separation membranes and\ncatalysis. Moreover, one of the proposed structures, $\\gamma$-silagraphyne, is\na direct-band-gap semiconductor with a bandgap of 0.89 eV, which has a strong\nabsorption peak in the visible-light region, giving a promising application in\nultra-thin transistors, optical sensor devices and solar cell devices.\n", "  We comment on an expression for positive sound dispersion (PSD) in fluids and\nanalysis of PSD from molecular dynamics simulations reported in the Letter by\nFomin et al (J.Phys.:Condens.Matt. v.28, 43LT01, 2016)\n", "  The general features of the light scattering resulting in the so-called\nresonant Wood's anomalies in the reflection and transmission spectra are\ndescribed using the effective parameters of a quasi-guided mode. The expression\ndetermining the spectral angular dependence of Wood's anomaly in the case of\nplasmonic grating structures is given and compared to the analogous expression\nfor dielectric grating structures. Comparison of the resonant Wood's anomalies\n(RWA) with the surface plasmon-polariton resonances (SPPRs) is discussed as\nwell.\n", "  Nano-structures with giant magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE) are\ndesired in designing miniaturized magnetic storage and quantum computing\ndevices. Through ab initio and model calculations, we propose that special\np-element dimers and single-adatom on symmetry-matched substrates possess giant\natomic MAE of 72-200 meV with room temperature structural stability. The huge\nMAE originates from degenerate orbitals around Fermi level. More importantly,\nwe developed a simplified quantum mechanical model to understand the principle\non how to obtain giant MAE for supported magnetic structures. These discoveries\nand mechanisms provide a paradigm to design giant atomic MAE in nanostructures.\n", "  Calculations of the entanglement entropy of a spatial region in continuum\nquantum field theory require boundary conditions on the fields at the\nfictitious boundary of the region. These boundary conditions impact the\ntreatment of the zero modes of the fields and their contribution to the\nentanglement entropy. We explore this issue in the simplest example, the c=1\ncompact-boson conformal field theory in 1+1 dimensions. We consider three\ndifferent types of boundary conditions: spatial Neumann, temporal Neumann, and\nDirichlet. We argue that the first two are well motivated, and show that they\nlead to the same result for the Renyi entropies as well as the entanglement\nentropy, including a constant term that corresponds to the Affleck-Ludwig\nboundary entropy. The last set of boundary conditions is less well motivated,\nand leads to a different value of the constant term. The two values are related\nby a duality transformation on the compact boson. We also verify some of our\nresults with heat-kernel methods.\n", "  We provide a brief review of some of the recent developments in our\nunderstanding of the initial state in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  Spin-dependent observables in intermediate-energy $pd$ elastic scattering\nwithin the framework of the refined Glauber model are considered. The\nimprovements include an account of all ten $pp$ and $pn$ helicity amplitudes at\nrespective energies constructed on the basis of modern phase-shift analysis,\naccurate deuteron wave functions taken from the modern $NN$ force model and\naccount of charge-exchange effects. Predictions of the refined diffraction\nmodel for the differential cross section and analyzing powers are compared with\nexact three-body Faddeev calculations and the recent experimental data. An\namazingly good agreement between the results of both theoretical approaches as\nwell as between the refined Glauber model and experiment in a wide angular\nrange not only for differential cross section but also for vector and tensor\nanalyzing powers has been found in the first time. Possible reasons for this\nagreement are discussed.\n", "  We survey results about exact cylindrically symmetric models of gravitational\ncollapse in General Relativity. We focus on models which result from the\nmatching of two spacetimes having collapsing interiors which develop trapped\nsurfaces and vaccum exteriors containing gravitational waves. We collect some\ntheorems from the literature which help to decide a priori about eventual\nspacetime matchings. We revise, in more detail, some toy models which include\nsome of the main mathematical and physical issues that arise in this context,\nand compute the gravitational energy flux through the matching boundary of a\nparticular collapsing region. Along the way, we point out several interesting\nopen problems.\n", "  An important ingredient for applications of nuclear physics to e.g.\nastrophysics or nuclear energy are the cross sections for reactions of neutrons\nwith rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are often not possible, indirect\nmethods like $(d,p)$ reactions must be used instead. Those $(d,p)$ reactions\nmay be viewed as effective three-body reactions and described with Faddeev\ntechniques. An additional challenge posed by $(d,p)$ reactions involving\nheavier nuclei is the treatment of the Coulomb force. To avoid numerical\ncomplications in dealing with the screening of the Coulomb force, recently a\nnew approach using the Coulomb distorted basis in momentum space was suggested.\nIn order to implement this suggestion separable representations of neutron- and\nproton-nucleus optical potentials, which are not only complex but also energy\ndependent, need to be introduced. Including excitations of the nucleus in the\ncalculation requires a multichannel optical potential, and thus separable\nrepresentations thereof.\n", "  Despite their fundamentally non-equilibrium nature, the individual and\ncollective behavior of active systems with polar propulsion and isotropic\ninteractions (polar-isotropic active systems) are remarkably well captured by\nequilibrium mapping techniques. Here we examine two signatures of equilibrium\nsystems -- the existence of a local free energy function and the independence\nof the coarse- grained behavior on the details of the microscopic dynamics --\nin polar-isotropic active particles confined by hard walls of arbitrary\ngeometry at the one-particle level. We find that boundaries that possess\nconcave regions make the density profile strongly dynamics-dependent and give\nit a nonlocal dependence on the geometry of the confining box. This in turn\nconstrains the scope of equilibrium mapping techniques in polar-isotropic\nactive systems.\n", "  We investigate the radiolysis of liquid water confined in a porous silica\nmatrix by means of an event-by-event Monte Carlo simulation of electron\npenetration in this composite system. We focus on the physical and\nphysicochemical effects that take place in the picosecond range, before the\nradicals start to diffuse and react. We determine the radiolytic yields of the\nprimary species for a system made of cylindrical pores filled with water over a\nwide range of pore radii $R_{\\rm C}$. We show that the relative position of the\nconduction band edge $V_0$ in both materials plays a major role in the\nradiolysis of composite systems. Due to its lower $V_0$ as compared to that of\nsilica, water acts as a collector of low-energy electrons, which leads to a\nhuge enhancement of the solvated electron yields for $R_{\\rm C} \\leq$ 100 nm.\nThe confinement has also a marked effect on the spatial distribution of the\nradicals, which become isolated in a very large number of pores as $R_{\\rm C}$\ndecreases.\n", "  We study the asymptotics of recurrence coefficients for monic orthogonal\npolynomials $\\pi_n(z)$ with the quartic exponential weight $\\exp[-N(\\frac 12\nz^2+\\frac 14 tz^4)]$, where $t\\in {\\mathbb C}$ and $N\\in{\\mathbb N}$,\n$N\\to\\infty$. Our goal is to describe these asymptotic behaviors globally for\n$t\\in {\\mathbb C}$ in different regions. We also describe the \"breaking\" curves\nseparating these regions, and discuss their special (critical) points. All\nthese pieces of information combined provide the global asymptotic \"phase\nportrait\" of the recurrence coefficients of $\\pi_n(z)$, which was studied\nnumerically in [Constr. Approx. 41 (2015), 529-587, arXiv:1108.0321]. The main\ngoal of the present paper is to provide a rigorous framework for the global\nasymptotic portrait through the nonlinear steepest descent analysis (with the\n$g$-function mechanism) of the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem (RHP) and\nthe continuation in the parameter space principle. The latter allows to extend\nthe nonlinear steepest descent analysis from some parts of the complex\n$t$-plane to all noncritical values of $t$. We also provide explicit solutions\nfor recurrence coefficients in terms of the Riemann theta functions. The\nleading order behaviour of the recurrence coefficients in the full scaling\nneighbourhoods the critical points (double and triple scaling limits) was\nobtained in [Constr. Approx. 41 (2015), 529-587, arXiv:1108.0321] and\n[Asymptotics of complex orthogonal polynomials on the cross with varying\nquartic weight: critical point behaviour and the second Painlev\\'e\ntranscendents, in preparation].\n", "  A recurring topic in interstellar exploration and the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is the role of artificial intelligence.\nMore precisely, these are programs or devices that are capable of performing\ncognitive tasks that have been previously associated with humans such as image\nrecognition, reasoning, decision-making etc. Such systems are likely to play an\nimportant role in future deep space missions, notably interstellar exploration,\nwhere the spacecraft needs to act autonomously. This article explores the\ndrivers for an interstellar mission with a computation-heavy payload and\nprovides an outline of a spacecraft and mission architecture that supports such\na payload. Based on existing technologies and extrapolations of current trends,\nit is shown that AI spacecraft development and operation will be constrained\nand driven by three aspects: power requirements for the payload, power\ngeneration capabilities, and heat rejection capabilities. A likely mission\narchitecture for such a probe is to get into an orbit close to the star in\norder to generate maximum power for computational activities, and then to\nprepare for further exploration activities. Given current levels of increase in\ncomputational power, such a payload with a similar computational power as the\nhuman brain would have a mass of hundreds to dozens of tons in a 2050 - 2060\ntimeframe.\n", "  We present the results of 20 ksec Chandra observations for each of 5 radio\ngalaxies in the redshift range 2.0 < z < 2.6. For 4 of the 5 targets we detect\nunresolved X-ray components coincident with the radio nuclei. From spectral\nanalysis of one of the cores and comparison to the empirical radio to X-ray\nluminosity ratio correlation, we find that obscuring material (n(HI)~10^22\ncm^-2) may be surrounding the nuclei.\n  We detect X-ray emission coincident with the radio hotspots or lobes in 4 of\nthe 5 targets, which can be explained by Inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB\nphotons. The magnetic field strengths of ~100-200 muG that we derive agree with\nthe equipartition magnetic field strengths. The relative ease with which the\nlobe X-ray emission is detected is a consequence of the (1+z)^4 increase in the\nenergy density of the CMB. An HST image of one of the sources shows that the\nX-ray emission could also be produced by a reservoir of hot, shocked gas, as\nevidenced by a bright, optical bow-shock.\n  By stacking our data we created a deep, 100 ksec exposure to search for\ndiffuse X-ray emission from intra-cluster gas. We detect no diffuse emission\nand derive upper limits of ~1e+44 erg/s, thereby ruling out a virialized\nstructure of cluster-size scale at z~2.\n  The average number of soft X-ray sources in our fields is consistent with the\nnumber density of AGN in the Chandra Deep Fields. Their angular distribution\nshows no evidence for large-scale structure associated with the radio galaxies.\n", "  Intriguing parallels between density fluctuation power versus wavenumber on\nsmall (mm) and large (Mpc) scales are presented. The comparative study is\ncarried out between fusion plasma measurements and cosmological data. Based on\npredictions from classical fluid turbulence theory, we argue that our\nobservations are consistent with 2D turbulence. The similar dependencies of\ndensity fluctuations on these disparate scales might indicate that primordial\nturbulence has been expanded to cosmological proportions.\n", "  We explore a broad class of three-parameter inflationary models, called the\n$\\Lambda$-inflation, and its observational predictions: high abundance of\ncosmic gravitational waves consistent with the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum of\nprimordial cosmological perturbations, the non-power-law wing-like spectrum of\nmatter density perturbations, high efficiency of these models to meet current\nobservational tests, and others. We show that a parity contribution of the\ngravitational waves and adiabatic density perturbations into the large-scale\ntemperature anisotropy, T/S $\\sim 1$, is a common feature of\n$\\Lambda$-inflation; the maximum values of T/S (basically not larger than 10)\nare reached in models where (i) the local spectrum shape of density\nperturbations is flat or slightly red ($n_S{}_\\sim^< 1$), and (ii) the residual\npotential energy of the inflaton is near the GUT scale ($V_0^{{1/4}} \\sim\n10^{16} GeV$). The conditions to find large T/S in the paradigm of cosmic\ninflation and the relationship of T/S to the ratio of the power spectra, $r$,\nand to the inflationary $\\gamma$ and Hubble parameters, are discussed. We argue\nthat a simple estimate, T/S$\\simeq 3r\\simeq 12\\gamma \\simeq (\\frac{H}{6\\times\n10^{13}{\\rm GeV}})^2$, is true for most known inflationary solutions and allows\nto relate straightforwardly the important parameters of observational and\nphysical cosmology.\n", "  The recent progress in string theory strongly suggests that formation and\nevaporation of black holes is a unitary process. This fact makes it imperative\nthat we find a flaw in the semiclassical reasoning that implies a loss of\ninformation. We propose a new criterion that limits the domain of classical\ngravity: the hypersurfaces of a foliation cannot be stretched too much. This\nconjectured criterion may have important consequences for the early Universe.\n", "  Quantum geometrodynamics in extended phase space describes phenomenologically\nthe integrated system ``a physical object + observation means (a gravitational\nvacuum condensate)''. The central place in this version of QGD belongs to the\nSchrodinger equation for a wave function of the Universe. An exact solution to\nthe ``conditionally-classical'' set of equations in extended phase space for\nthe Bianchi-IX model and the appropriate solution to the Schrodinger equation\nare considered. The physical adequacy of the obtained solutions to existing\nconcepts about possible cosmological scenarios is demonstrated. The\ngravitational vacuum condensate is shown to be a cosmological evolution factor.\n", "  In this paper we obtain the energy distribution associated with the Ernst\nspace-time (geometry describing Schwarzschild black hole in Melvin's magnetic\nuniverse) in Einstein's prescription. The first term is the rest-mass energy of\nthe Schwarzschild black hole, the second term is the classical value for the\nenergy of the uniform magnetic field and the remaining terms in the expression\nare due to the general relativistic effect. The presence of the magnetic field\nis found to increase the energy of the system.\n", "  We examine the question of collapse of Turok's two-parameter family of cosmic\nstrings. We first perform a classification of the strings according to the\nspecific time(s) at which the minimal string size is reached during one period.\nWe then obtain an exact analytical expression for the probability of collapse\nto black holes for the Turok strings. Our result has the same general behavior\nas previously obtained in the literature but we find, in addition, a numerical\nprefactor that changes the result by three orders of magnitude. Finally we show\nthat our careful computation of the prefactor helps to understand the\ndiscrepancy between previously obtained results and, in particular, that for\n\"large\" values of $G\\mu$, there may not even be a discrepancy. We also give a\nsimple physical argument that can immediately rule out some of the previously\nobtained results.\n", "  We use the energy-momentum complexes of Landau and Lifshitz and Papapetrou to\nobtain the energy distribution in Melvin's magnetic universe. For this\nspace-time we find that these definitions of energy give the same and\nconvincing results. The energy distribution obtained here is the same as we\nobtained earlier for the same space-time using the energy-momentum complex of\nEinstein. These results uphold the usefulness of the energy-momentum complexes.\n", "  This presentation briefly summarizes the recent measurements of R-values in\nlow energy e^+e^- annihilation. The new experiments aimed at reducing the\nuncertainties in R-values and performed with the upgraded Beijing Spectrometer\n(BESII) at Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC) in Beijing and with CMD-2\nand SND at VEEP-2M in Novosibirsk are reviewed and discussed.\n", "  We calculate one-loop renormalization factors of three-quark operators, which\nappear in the low energy effective Lagrangian of the nucleon decay, for\n$O(a)$-improved quark action and gauge action including six-link loops. This\ncalculation is required to predict the hadronic nucleon decay matrix elements\nin the continuum regularization scheme using lattice QCD. We present detailed\nnumerical results of the one-loop coefficients for general values of the clover\ncoefficients employing the several improved gauge actions in the Symanzik\napproach and in the Wilson's renormalization group approach. The magnitudes of\nthe one-loop coefficients for the improved gauge actions show sizable reduction\ncompared to those for the plaquette action.\n", "  It is an old speculation that SU(N) gauge theory can alternatively be\nformulated as a string theory. Recently this subject has been revived, in the\nwake of the discovery of D-branes. In particular, it has been argued that at\nleast some conformally invariant cousins of the theory have such a string\nrepresentation. This is a pedagogical introduction to these developments for\nnon-string theorists. Some of the existing arguments are simplified.\n", "  We perform renormalization group transformations to construct optimally local\nperfect lattice actions for free scalar fields of any mass. Their couplings\ndecay exponentially. The spectrum is identical to the continuum spectrum, while\nthermodynamic quantities have tiny lattice artifacts. To make such actions\napplicable in simulations, we truncate the couplings to a unit hypercube and\nobserve that spectrum and thermodynamics are still drastically improved\ncompared to the standard lattice action. We show how preconditioning techniques\ncan be applied successfully to this type of action. We also consider a number\nof variants of the perfect lattice action, such as the use of an anisotropic or\ntriangular lattice, and modifications of the renormalization group\ntransformations motivated by wavelets. Along the way we illuminate the\nconsistent treatment of gauge fields, and we find a new fermionic fixed point\naction with attractive properties.\n", "  Exact solutions are found to the Dirac equation for a combination of Lorentz\nscalar and vector Coulombic potentials with additional non-Coulombic parts. An\nappropriate linear combination of Lorentz scalar and vector non-Coulombic\npotentials, with the scalar part dominating, can be chosen to give exact\nanalytic Dirac wave functions. The method works for the ground state or for the\nlowest orbital state with l=j-{1/2}, for any j.\n", "  The consequences of large radius extra space-time compactified dimensions on\nthe four dimensional one loop effective potential are investigated for a model\nwhich includes scalar self interactions and Yukawa coupling to fermions. The\nKaluza-Klein tower of states associated with the extra compact dimensions\nshifts the location of the effective potential minimum and modifies its\ncurvature. The dependence of these effects on the radius of the extra dimension\nis illustrated for various choices of coupling constants and masses. For large\nradii, the consequence of twisting the fermion boundary condition on the\ncompactified dimensions is numerically found to produce but a negligible effect\non the effective potential.\n", "  We generalize a previous construction of a fermiophobic model to the case of\nmore than one extra $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons. We focus in particular on the\nexistence of screening configurations and their implication on the gauge boson\nmass spectrum. One of these configurations allows for the existence of a set of\nrelatively light new gauge bosons, without violation of the quite restrictive\nbounds coming from the $\\rho_{\\rm NC}$ parameter. The links with Bess and\ndegenerate Bess models are also discussed. Also the signal given here by this\nmore traditional gauge extension of the SM could help to disentangle it from\nthe towers of Kaluza-Klein states over $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons in extra\ndimensions.\n", "  We propose a neutrino mass matrix model in which five neutrino species remain\nlight through the seesaw mechanism within a supersymmetric $3\\nu_L+3\\nu_R$\nframework. We construct such a model based on the nonrenormalizable terms in\nthe superpotential constrained by the discrete symmetry which may be expected\nin the models at the high energy scale such as superstring. We study the\npossible oscillation phenomena by fixing mass parameters so as to explain the\nsolar and atmospheric neutrino deficits and also include a candidate of the\nsuitable dark matter. We also discuss the charged lepton mass matrix based on\nthis neutrino model. LSND results may be consistently explained within this\nmodel.\n", "  The massless fermion limit of QED is discussed. For on-shell renormalisation\nthe high energy behaviour fixes no lower limit on the mass of the lightest\nfermion if the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ is allowed to vary. The choice\nof an arbitary (space-like) subtraction point does, however, fix a lower limit\non the mass of the lightest fermion, for any subtraction scale $\\mu$, if the\neffective charge $\\aefmu$ respects both quantum mechanical superposition and\nrenormalisation scale invariance. Limits on the values of $\\alpha$ or the\nelectron mass are obtained within the Standard Electroweak Model by requiring\nconvergence of $\\aefmz$.\n", "  We study CP-violating effects in $B\\to \\psi K_{s}$ decay within minimal\nsupersymmetric models with spontaneous CP-violation. We find that the\nCP-asymmetry predicted by the Standard Model in this decay, $\\sin 2\\beta \\geq\n0.4$, cannot be accommodated in these models without violating the bound on the\nneutron electric dipole moment. This result holds for NMSSM-like models with an\narbitrary number of sterile superfields. Further implications of the scenario\nare discussed.\n", "  We apply the new formulation of heavy quark effective field theory (HQEFT) to\nthe inclusive decays of bottom hadrons. The long-term ambiguity of using heavy\nquark mass or heavy hadron mass for inclusive decays is clarified within the\nframework of the new formulation of HQEFT. The $1/m_b$ order corrections are\nabsent and contributions from $1/m_b^2$ terms are calculated in detail. This\nenables us to reliably extract the important CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from\nthe inclusive semileptonic decay rates. The resulting lifetime ratios\n$\\tau(B^0_s)/\\tau(B^0)$ and $\\tau(\\Lambda_b)/\\tau(B^0)$ are found to well agree\nwith the experimental data. We also calculate in detail the inclusive\nsemileptonic branching ratios and the ratios of the $\\tau$ and $\\beta$ decay\nrates as well as the charm countings in the $B^0$, $B^0_s$ and $\\Lambda_b$\nsystems. For $B^0$ decays, all the observables are found to be consistent with\nthe experimental data. More precise data for the $B^0$ decays and further\nexperimental measurements for the $B^0_s$ and $\\Lambda_b$ systems will be very\nuseful for testing the framework of new formulation of HQEFT at the level of\nhigher order corrections.\n", "  Besides perturbation theory, which requires, of course, the knowledge of the\nexact unperturbed solution, variational techniques represent the main tool for\nany investigation of the eigenvalue problem of some semibounded operator H in\nquantum theory. For a reasonable choice of the employed trial subspace of the\ndomain of H, the lowest eigenvalues of H usually can be located with acceptable\nprecision whereas the trial-subspace vectors corresponding to these eigenvalues\napproximate, in general, the exact eigenstates of H with much less accuracy.\nAccordingly, various measures for the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates\nderived by variational techniques are scrutinized. In particular, the matrix\nelements of the commutator of the operator H and (suitably chosen) different\noperators, with respect to degenerate approximate eigenstates of H obtained by\nsome variational method, are proposed here as new criteria for the accuracy of\nvariational eigenstates. These considerations are applied to that Hamiltonian\nthe eigenvalue problem of which defines the \"spinless Salpeter equation.\" This\n(bound-state) wave equation may be regarded as the most straightforward\nrelativistic generalization of the usual nonrelativistic Schroedinger\nformalism, and is frequently used to describe, e.g., spin-averaged mass spectra\nof bound states of quarks.\n", "  We have investimated the effect of the isospin 1/2, J^P = 0^+ resonant state\nK^*_0(1950) on the decays D^0 ->\\bar{K}^{0}\\eta and D^0 ->\\bar{K}^0 \\eta' as a\nfunction of the branching ratio sum r =Br(K^*_0(1950)->\\bar{K}^0\\eta)+\nBr(K^*_0(1950)->\\bar{K}^0 \\eta' and coupling constants g_{K^*_0\\bar{K}^0\\eta},\ng_{K^*_0\\bar{K}^0\\eta'}. We have used a factorized input for D^0 -> K^*_0(1950)\nweak transition through a \\pi K loop. We estimated both on- and off-shell\ncontributions from the loop. Our calculation shows that the off-shell effects\nare significant. For $r\\geq 30%$ a fit to the decay amplitude A(D^0 ->\n\\bar{K}^0 \\eta') was possible, but the amplitude A(D^0 ->\\bar{K}^0 \\eta)\nremained at its factorized value. For small values of r, $r\\leq 18 %$, we were\nable to fit A(D^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 \\eta), and despite the fact that A(D^0 ->\n\\bar{K}^0 \\eta') could be raised by almost 100 % over its factorized value, it\nstill falls short of its experimental value. A simultaneous fit to both\namplitudes A(D^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 \\eta') and A(D^0 -> \\bar{K}^0 \\eta) was not\npossible. We have also determined the strong phase of the resonant amplitudes\nfor both decays.\n  PACS numbers:13.25.Ft, 13.25.-k, 14.40.Lb\n", "  The two-loop invariant (running) coupling of QCD is written in terms of the\nLambert W function. The analyticity structure of the coupling in the complex\nQ^2-plane is established. The corresponding analytic coupling is reconstructed\nvia a dispersion relation. We also consider some other approximations to the\nQCD beta-function, when the corresponding couplings are solved in terms of the\nLambert function. The Landau gauge gluon propagator has been considered in the\nrenormalization group invariant analytic approach (IAA). It is shown that there\nis a nonperturbative ambiguity in determination of the anomalous dimension\nfunction of the gluon field. Several analytic solutions for the propagator at\nthe one-loop order are constructed. Properties of the obtained analytical\nsolutions are discussed.\n", "  The fundamental laws of physics can be derived from the requirement of\ninvariance under suitable classes of transformations on the one hand, and from\nthe need for a well-posed mathematical theory on the other hand. As a part of\nthis programme, the present paper shows under which conditions the introduction\nof pseudo-differential boundary operators in one-loop Euclidean quantum gravity\nis compatible both with their invariance under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms\nand with the requirement of a strongly elliptic theory. Suitable assumptions on\nthe kernel of the boundary operator make it therefore possible to overcome\nproblems resulting from the choice of purely local boundary conditions.\n", "  We discuss geometry underlying orientifolds with non-trivial NS-NS B-flux. If\nD-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to\nnon-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the case\nof D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to a\nsmaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in the\npresence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the opposite\norientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux\nis more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely\nconsistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two\nsetups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the\nmixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,\nwhich we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and\nconstruct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these results\nwe revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) and\npoint out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, in\nthe Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be the\nconsistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This is\nrelated to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- as\nwell as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to be\ninconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal field\ntheory orbifold. We also consider four dimensional N=2 and N=1 supersymmetric\norientifolds. We construct consistent four dimensional models with B-flux which\ndo not suffer from difficulties encountered in the K3 cases.\n", "  The sinh-Gordon model is restricted to a half-line by boundary conditions\nmaintaining integrability. A perturbative calculation of the reflection factor\nis given to one loop order in the bulk coupling and to first order in the\ndifference of the two parameters introduced at the boundary, providing a\nfurther verification of Ghoshal's formula. The calculation is consistent with a\nconjecture for the general dependence of the reflection factor on the boundary\nparameters and the bulk coupling.\n", "  The general model of an arbitrary spin massive particle in any dimensional\nspace-time is derived on the basis of Kirillov - Kostant - Souriau approach. It\nis shown that the model allows consistent coupling to an arbitrary background\nof electromagnetic and gravitational fields.\n", "  For perfect fluids with equation of state $\\rho = \\rho (n,s)$, Brown gave an\naction principle depending only on their Lagrange coordinates $\\alpha^i(x)$\nwithout Clebsch potentials. After a reformulation on arbitrary spacelike\nhypersurfaces in Minkowski spacetime, the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant\nform of these perfect fluids is given. Their Hamiltonian invariant mass can be\ngiven in closed form for the dust and the photon gas. The action for the\ncoupling to tetrad gravity is given. Dixon's multipoles for the perfect fluids\nare studied on the rest-frame Wigner hyperplane. It is also shown that the same\nformalism can be applied to non-dissipative relativistic elastic materials\ndescribed in terms of Lagrangian coordinates.\n", "  We revise the problem of the quantization of relativistic particle models\n(spinless and spinning), presenting a modified consistent canonical scheme. One\nof the main point of the modification is related to a principally new\nrealization of the Hilbert space. It allows one not only to include arbitrary\nbackgrounds in the consideration but to get in course of the quantization a\nconsistent relativistic quantum mechanics, which reproduces literally the\nbehavior of the one-particle sector of the corresponding quantum field. In\nparticular, in a physical sector of the Hilbert space a complete positive\nspectrum of energies of relativistic particles and antiparticles is reproduced,\nand all state vectors have only positive norms.\n", "  This is the write-up of a set of lectures on the comparison between Lattice\nGauge Theories and AdS/CFT results for the non-perturbative behaviour of\nnon-supersymmetric Yang Mills theories. These notes are intended for students\nwhich are assumed not to be experts in L.G.T. For this reason the first part is\ndevoted to a pedagogical introduction to the Lattice regularization of QCD. In\nthe second part we discuss some basic features of the AdS/CFT correspondence\nand compare the results obtained in the non-supersymmetric limit with those\nobtained on the Lattice. We discuss in particular the behaviour of the string\ntension and of the glueball spectrum. Lectures delivered at the School of\nTheoretical Physics (S.N.F.T.), Parma, September 1999.\n", "  An irreducible Hamiltonian BRST quantization method for reducible first-class\nsystems is proposed. The general theory is illustrated on a two-stage reducible\nmodel, the link with the standard reducible BRST treatment being also\nemphasized.\n", "  The one loop quantum corrections to the classical reflection factor of the\nsinh-Gordon model are calculated partially for general boundary conditions. The\nmodel is studied under boundary conditions which are compatible with\nintegrability, and in the framework of the conventional perturbation theory\ngeneralized to the affine Toda field theory. It is found that the general form\nof the related quantum corrections are hypergeometric functions.\n", "  We discuss the properties of matter in a D-dimensional anti-de-Sitter-type\nspace time induced dynamically by the recoil of a very heavy\nD(irichlet)-particle defect embedded in it. The particular form of the recoil\ngeometry, which from a world-sheet view point follows from logarithmic\nconformal field theory deformations of the pertinent sigma-models, results in\nthe presence of both infrared and ultraviolet (spatial) cut-offs. These are\ncrucial in ensuring the presence of mass gaps in scalar matter propagating in\nthe D-particle recoil space time. The analogy of this problem with the\nLiouville-string approach to QCD, suggested earlier by John Ellis and one of\nthe present authors, prompts us to identify the resulting scalar masses with\nthose obtained in the supergravity approach based on the Maldacena's\nconjecture, but without the imposition of any supersymmetry in our case. Within\nreasonable numerical uncertainties, we observe that agreement is obtained\nbetween the two approaches for a particular value of the ratio of the two\ncut-offs of the recoil geometry. Notably, our approach does not suffer from the\nambiguities of the supergravity approach as regards the validity of the\ncomparison of the glueball masses computed there with those obtained in the\ncontinuum limit of lattice gauge theories.\n", "  In the first part of this paper we find supergravity solutions corresponding\nto branes on worldvolumes of the form $R^d \\times \\Sigma$ where $\\Sigma$ is a\nRiemann surface. These theories arise when we wrap branes on holomorphic\nRiemann surfaces inside $K3$ or CY manifolds. In some cases the theory at low\nenergies is a conformal field theory with two less dimensions. We find some\nnon-singular supersymmetric compactifications of M-theory down to $AdS_5$. We\nalso propose a criterion for permissible singularities in supergravity\nsolutions.\n  In the second part of this paper, which can be read independently of the\nfirst, we show that there are no non-singular Randall-Sundrum or de-Sitter\ncompactifications for large class of gravity theories.\n", "  In this article we propose a `second quantization' scheme especially suitable\nto deal with non-trivial, highly symmetric phase spaces, implemented within a\nmore general Group Approach to Quantization, which recovers the standard\nQuantum Field Theory (QFT) for ordinary relativistic linear fields. We\nemphasize, among its main virtues, greater suitability in characterizing vacuum\nstates in a QFT on a highly symmetric curved space-time and the absence of the\nusual requirement of global hyperbolicity. This can be achieved in the special\ncase of the Anti-de Sitter universe, on which we explicitly construct a QFT.\n", "  The quadratic form of the Dirac equation in a Riemann spacetime yields a\ngravitational gyromagnetic ratio \\kappa_S = 2 for the interaction of a Dirac\nspinor with curvature. A gravitational gyromagnetic ratio \\kappa_S = 1 is also\nfound for the interaction of a vector field with curvature. It is shown that\nthe Dirac equation in a curved background can be obtained as the square--root\nof the corresponding vector field equation only if the gravitational\ngyromagnetic ratios are properly taken into account.\n", "  We consider the detailed renormalization of two (1+1)-dimensional gauge\ntheories which are quantized without preserving gauge invariance: the chiral\nand the \"anomalous\" Schwinger models. By regularizing the non-perturbative\ndivergences that appear in fermionic Green's functions of both models, we show\nthat the \"tree level\" photon propagator is ill-defined, thus forcing one to use\nthe complete photon propagator in the loop expansion of these functions. We\nperform the renormalization of these divergences in both models to one loop\nlevel, defining it in a consistent and semi-perturbative sense that we propose\nin this paper.\n", "  We derive a first order formalism for solving the scattering of point sources\nin (2+1) gravity with negative cosmological constant. We show that their\nphysical motion can be mapped, with a polydromic coordinate transformation, to\na trivial motion, in such a way that the point sources move as time-like\ngeodesics (in the case of particles) or as space-like geodesics (in the case of\nBTZ black holes) of a three-dimensional hypersurface immersed in a\nfour-dimensional Minkowskian space-time, and that the two-body dynamics is\nsolved by two invariant masses, whose difference is simply related to the total\nangular momentum of the system.\n", "  We investigate the issue of electromagnetic duality on the light front. We\nwork with Zwanziger's theory of electric and magnetic sources which is\nappropriate for treating duality. When quantized on the light-front in the\nlight front gauge, this theory yields two independent phase space degrees of\nfreedom, namely the two transverse field components, the right number to\ndescribe the gauge field sector of normal light-front QED and also the\nappropriate commutator between them. The electromagnetic duality transformation\nformulated in terms of them is similar in form to the Susskind transformation\nproposed for the free theory, provided one identifies them as the dynamical\nfield components of the photon on the light-front in the presence of magnetic\nsources. The Hamiltonian density written in terms of these components is\ninvariant under the duality transformation.\n", "  We continue to explore the possibility that the graviton in two dimensions is\nrelated to a quadratic differential that appears in the anomalous contribution\nof the gravitational effective action for chiral fermions. A higher dimensional\nanalogue of this field might exist as well. We improve the defining action for\nthis diffeomorphism tensor field and establish a principle for how it interacts\nwith other fields and with point particles in any dimension. All interactions\nare related to the action of the diffeomorphism group. We discuss possible\ninterpretations of this field.\n", "  Gorsky et al. presented an explicit construction of Whitham deformations of\nthe Seiberg-Witten curve for the $SU(N+1)$ $\\calN = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory.\nWe extend their result to all classical gauge groups and some other cases such\nas the spectral curve of the $A^{(2)}_{2N}$ affine Toda Toda system. Our\nconstruction, too, uses fractional powers of the superpotential $W(x)$ that\ncharacterizes the curve. We also consider the $u$-plane integral of\ntopologically twisted theories on four-dimensional manifolds $X$ with\n$b_2^{+}(X) = 1$ in the language of these explicitly constructed Whitham\ndeformations and an integrable hierarchy of the KdV type hidden behind.\n", "  We present a theta function representation of the twisted characters for the\nrational N=2 superconformal field theory, and discuss the Jacobi-form like\nfunctional properties of these characters for a fixed central charge under the\naction of a finite Heisenberg group and modular transformations.\n", "  The canonical decomposition of a real Klein-Gordon field in collective and\nrelative variables proposed by Longhi and Materassi is reformulated on\nspacelike hypersurfaces. This allows to obtain the complete canonical reduction\nof the system on Wigner hyperplanes, namely in the rest-frame Wigner-covariant\ninstant form of dynamics. From the study of Dixon's multipoles for the\nenergy-momentum tensor on the Wigner hyperplanes we derive the definition of\nthe canonical center-of-mass variable for a Klein-Gordon field configuration:\nit turns out that the Longhi-Materassi global variable should be interpreted as\na center of phase of the field configuration. A detailed study of the\nkinematical \"external\" and \"internal\" properties of the field configuration on\nthe Wigner hyperplanes is done. The construction is then extended to charged\nKlein-Gordon fields: the centers of phase of the two real components can be\ncombined to define a global center of phase and a collective relative variable\ndescribing the action-reaction between the two Feshbach-Villars components of\nthe field with definite sign of energy and charge. The Dixon multipoles for\nboth the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current are given. Also the\ncoupling of the Klein-Gordon field to scalar relativistic particles is studied\nand it is shown that in the reduced phase space, besides the particle and field\nrelative variables, there is also a collective relative variable describing the\nrelative motion of the particle subsytem with respect to the field one.\n", "  We consider non-perturbative four dimensional N=1 space-time supersymmetric\norientifolds corresponding to Type I compactifications on (generalized)\nVoisin-Borcea orbifolds. Some states in such compactifications arise in\n``twisted'' open string sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms of\nD-branes. Using Type I-heterotic duality as well as the map between Type IIB\norientifolds and F-theory we are able to obtain the massless spectra of such\norientifolds. The four dimensional compactifications we discuss in this context\nare examples of chiral N=1 supersymmetric string vacua which are\nnon-perturbative from both orientifold and heterotic points of view. In\nparticular, they contain both D9- and D5-branes as well as non-perturbative\n``twisted'' open string sector states. We also explain the origins of various\ninconsistencies arising in such compactifications for certain choices of the\ngauge bundle.\n", "  Quantum group Fourier transform methods are applied to the study of processes\non noncommutative Minkowski spacetime $[x^i,t]=\\imath\\lambda x^i$. A natural\nwave equation is derived and the associated phenomena of {\\it in vacuo}\ndispersion are discussed. Assuming the deformation scale $\\lambda$ is of the\norder of the Planck length one finds that the dispersion effects are large\nenough to be tested in experimental investigations of astrophysical phenomena\nsuch as gamma-ray bursts. We also outline a new approach to the construction of\nfield theories on the noncommutative spacetime, with the noncommutativity\nequivalent under Fourier transform to non-Abelianness of the `addition law' for\nmomentum in Feynman diagrams. We argue that CPT violation effects of the type\ntestable using the sensitive neutral-kaon system are to be expected in such a\ntheory.\n", "  Symmetric vacua of heterotic M-theory, characterized by vanishing cohomology\nclasses of individual sources in the three-form Bianchi identity, are analyzed\non smooth Calabi-Yau three-folds. We show that such vacua do not exist for\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau spaces. However, explicit examples are found\nfor Calabi-Yau three-folds arising as intersections in both unweighted and\nweighted projective space. We show that such symmetric vacua can be combined\nwith attractive phenomenological features such as three generations of quarks\nand leptons. Properties of the low energy effective actions associated with\nsymmetric vacua are discussed. In particular, the gauge kinetic functions\nreceive no perturbative threshold corrections, there are no corrections to the\nmatter field Kahler metric and the associated five-dimensional effective theory\nadmits flat space as its vacuum.\n", "  We develop the general theory of Noether symmetries for constrained systems.\nIn our derivation, the Dirac bracket structure with respect to the primary\nconstraints appears naturally and plays an important role in the\ncharacterization of the conserved quantities associated to these Noether\nsymmetries. The issue of projectability of these symmetries from tangent space\nto phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical interpretation of\nthe projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the Noether\nconserved quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form defined on it.\nWe also examine the enlarged formalism that results from taking the Lagrange\nmultipliers as new dynamical variables; we find the equation that characterizes\nthe Noether symmetries in this formalism. The algebra of generators for Noether\nsymmetries is discussed in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. We\nfind that a frequent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact\nthat the transformations of momenta in phase space and tangent space only\ncoincide on shell. Our results apply with no distinction to rigid and gauge\nsymmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of Noether\ngauge symmetries for theories with first and second class constraints that do\nnot exhibit tertiary constraints in the stabilization algorithm. Among some\nexamples that illustrate our results, we study the Noether gauge symmetries of\nthe Abelian Chern-Simons theory in $2n+1$ dimensions. An interesting feature of\nthis example is that its primary constraints can only be identified after the\ndetermination of the secondary constraint. The example is worked out retaining\nall the original set of variables.\n", "  We consider the AdS space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving from\nthe Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The on-shell action is shown to be free of\ninfrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. In this limit\nthe model becomes Maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge.\nThen we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the two-point correlation\nfunctions on the boundary. It is shown that the gauge dependence concentrates\non the contact terms.\n", "  Starting from the Dirac equation in external electromagnetic and torsion\nfields we derive a path integral representation for the corresponding\npropagator. An effective action, which appears in the representation, is\ninterpreted as a pseudoclassical action for a spinning particle. It is just a\ngeneralization of Berezin-Marinov action to the background under consideration.\nPseudoclassical equations of motion in the nonrelativistic limit reproduce\nexactly the classical limit of the Pauli quantum mechanics in the same case.\nQuantization of the action appears to be nontrivial due to an ordering problem,\nwhich needs to be solved to construct operators of first-class constraints, and\nto select the physical sector. Finally the quantization reproduces the Dirac\nequation in the given background and, thus, justifies the interpretation of the\naction.\n", "  We show in a precise group theoretical fashion how the generating solution of\nregular BPS black holes of N=8 supergravity, which is known to be a solution\nalso of a simpler N=2 STU model truncation, can be characterized as NS-NS or\nR-R charged according to the way the corresponding STU model is embedded in the\noriginal N=8 theory. Of particular interest is the class of embeddings which\nyield regular BPS black hole solutions carrying only R-R charge and whose\nmicroscopic description can possibly be given in terms of bound states of\nD-branes only. The microscopic interpretation of the bosonic fields in this\nclass of STU models relies on the solvable Lie algebra (SLA) method. In the\npresent article we improve this mathematical technique in order to provide two\ndistinct descriptions for type IIA and type IIB theories and an algebraic\ncharacterization of S*T--dual embeddings within the N=8,d=4 theory. This\nanalysis will be applied to the particular example of a four parameter\n(dilatonic) solution of which both the full macroscopic and microscopic\ndescriptions will be worked out.\n", "  A field model on fibre bundles can be extended in a standard way to the\nBRS-invariant SUSY field model which possesses the Lie supergroup ISp(2) of\nsymmetries.\n", "  The complete proof of a theorem announced in [1] on the consistent\ninteractions for (non-chiral) exterior form gauge fields is given. The theorem\ncan be easily generalized to the analysis of anomalies. Its proof amounts to\ncomputing the local BRST cohomology H^0(s|d) in the space of local n-forms\ndepending on the fields, the ghosts, the antifields and their derivatives.\n", "  We apply the new orbifold duality transformations to discuss the special case\nof cyclic coset orbifolds in further detail. We focus in particular on the case\nof the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds, whose untwisted sectors are\nZ_\\lambda(permutation)-invariant g/h coset constructions which are not \\lambda\ncopies of coset constructions. Because \\lambda copies are not involved, the\naction of Z_\\lambda(permutation) in the interacting cyclic coset orbifolds can\nbe quite intricate. The stress tensors and ground state conformal weights of\nall the sectors of a large class of these orbifolds are given explicitly and\nspecial emphasis is placed on the twisted h subalgebras which are generated by\nthe twisted (0,0) operators of these orbifolds. We also discuss the systematics\nof twisted (0,0) operators in general coset orbifolds.\n", "  We study the action of picture-changing and spectral flow operators on a\nground ring of ghost number zero operators in the chiral BRST cohomology of the\nclosed N=2 string and describe an infinite set of symmetry charges acting on\nphysical states. The transformations of physical string states are compared\nwith symmetries of self-dual gravity which is the effective field theory of the\nclosed N=2 string. We derive all infinitesimal symmetries of the self-dual\ngravity equations in 2+2 dimensional spacetime and introduce an infinite\nhierarchy of commuting flows on the moduli space of self-dual metrics. The\ndependence on moduli parameters can be recovered by solving the equations of\nthe SDG hierarchy associated with an infinite set of abelian symmetries\ngenerated recursively from translations. These non-local abelian symmetries are\nshown to coincide with the hidden abelian string symmetries responsible for the\nvanishing of most scattering amplitudes. Therefore, N=2 string theory\n\"predicts\" not only self-dual gravity but also the SDG hierarchy.\n", "  We define quantum bi-Hamiltonian systems, by analogy with the classical case,\nas derivations in operator algebras which are inner derivations with respect to\ntwo compatible associative structures. We find such structures by means of the\nassociative version of Nijenhuis tensors. Explicit examples, e.g. for the\nharmonic oscillator, are given.\n", "  The higher rank analogue of the XXZ model with a boundary is considered on\nthe basis of the vertex operator approach. We derive difference equations of\nthe quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type for 2N-point correlations of the model.\nWe present infinite product formulae of two point functions with free boundary\ncondition by solving those difference equations with N=1.\n", "  We solve the spectrum of quantum spin chains based on representations of the\nTemperley-Lieb algebra associated with the quantum groups ${\\cal U}%\n_{q}(X_{n})$ for $X_{n}=A_{1},$ $B_{n},$ $C_{n}$ and $D_{n}$. The tool is a\nmodified version of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz through a suitable choice of\nthe Bethe states which give to all models the same status relative to their\ndiagonalization. All these models have equivalent spectra up to degeneracies\nand the spectra of the lower dimensional representations are contained in the\nhigher-dimensional ones. Periodic boundary conditions, free boundary conditions\nand closed non-local boundary conditions are considered. Periodic boundary\nconditions, unlike free boundary conditions, break quantum group invariance.\nFor closed non-local cases the models are quantum group invariant as well as\nperiodic in a certain sense.\n", "  We will in this paper report on suggestive similarities between density\nfluctuation power versus wavenumber on small (mm) and large (Mpc) scales. The\nsmall scale measurements were made in fusion plasmas and compared to\npredictions from classical fluid turbulence theory. The data is consistent with\nthe dissipative range of 2D turbulence. Alternatively, the results can be\nfitted to a functional form that can not be explained by turbulence theory. The\nlarge scale measurements were part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy\nredshift examination. We found that the equations describing fusion plasmas\nalso hold for the galaxy data. The comparable dependency of density fluctuation\npower on wavenumber in fusion plasmas and galaxies might indicate a common\norigin of these fluctuations.\n", "  I introduce a reality structure on the Heisenberg double of Fun_q(SL(N,C))\nfor q phase, which for N=2 can be interpreted as the quantum phase space of the\nparticle on the q-deformed mass-hyperboloid. This construction is closely\nrelated to the q-deformation of the symmetric top. Finally, I conjecture that\nthe above real form describes zero modes of certain non-compact WZNZ-models.\n", "  The general construction of self-adjoint configuration space representations\nof the Heisenberg algebra over an arbitrary manifold is considered. All such\ninequivalent representations are parametrised in terms of the topology classes\nof flat U(1) bundles over the configuration space manifold. In the case of\nRiemannian manifolds, these representations are also manifestly diffeomorphic\ncovariant. The general discussion, illustrated by some simple examples in non\nrelativistic quantum mechanics, is of particular relevance to systems whose\nconfiguration space is parametrised by curvilinear coordinates or is not simply\nconnected, which thus include for instance the modular spaces of theories of\nnon abelian gauge fields and gravity.\n", "  The SU(2) invariant massive Thirring model with a boundary is considered on\nthe basis of the vertex operator approach. The bosonic formulae are presented\nfor the vacuum vector and its dual in the presence of the boundary. The\nintegral representations are also given for form factors of the present model.\n"]}
