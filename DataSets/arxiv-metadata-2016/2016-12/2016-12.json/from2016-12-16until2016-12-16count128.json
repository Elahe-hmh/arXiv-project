Then we will classify them\ninto real solution hierarchies and also the complex solution hierarchies, which\nare hardly studied.\n", "  We approach the biexciton Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation not through the\nfree-carrier basis as usually done, but through the free-exciton basis,\nexciton-exciton interactions being treated according to the recently developed\ncomposite boson many-body formalism which allows an exact handling of carrier\nexchange between excitons, as induced by the Pauli exclusion principle. We\nnumerically solve the resulting biexciton Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with the\nexciton levels restricted to the ground state and we derive the biexciton\nground state as well as the bound and unbound excited states as a function of\nhole-to-electron mass ratio. The biexciton ground-state energy we find, agrees\nreasonably well with variational results. Next, we use the obtained biexciton\nwave functions to calculate optical absorption in the presence of a dilute\nexciton gas in quantum well. We find a small asymmetric peak with a\ncharacteristic low-energy tail, identified with the biexciton ground state, and\na set of large peaks associated with biexciton unbound states, i.e.,\nexciton-exciton scattering states.\n", "  A novel version of the Continuous-Time Random Walk (CTRW) model with memory\nis developed. This memory means the dependence between arbitrary number of\nsuccessive jumps of the process, while waiting times between jumps are\nconsidered as i.i.d. random variables. The dependence was found by analysis of\nempirical histograms for the stochastic process of a single share price on a\nmarket within the high frequency time scale, and justified theoretically by\nconsidering bid-ask bounce mechanism containing some delay characteristic for\nany double-auction market. Our model turns out to be exactly analytically\nsolvable, which enables a direct comparison of its predictions with their\nempirical counterparts, for instance, with empirical velocity autocorrelation\nfunction. Thus this paper significantly extends the capabilities of the CTRW\nformalism.\n", "  We investigated both numerically and experimentally the dynamics of\nindividual ZnO nanowires immersed in an in-plane switching (IPS)\n4-Cyano-4-pentylbiphenyl (5CB) liquid crystal cell under switching electric\nfields. Comparing the motion of nanowires captured by a high-speed CCD camera\nwith the simulated results allows the interaction among nanowires, liquid\ncrystals and external electric field to be studied. Our results show that in\nthe nematic phase, the relaxation and response of a nanowire are both\ncontrolled by both the dielectrophoretic torque induced by the external\nelectric field and the elastic torque arising from the liquid crystals.\n", "  For energy efficiency and material cost reduction it is preferred to drive\nhigh-intensity discharge lamps at frequencies of approximately 300 kHz.\nHowever, operating lamps at these high frequencies bears the risk of\nstimulating acoustic resonances inside the arc tube, which can result in low\nfrequency light flicker and even lamp destruction. The acoustic streaming\neffect has been identified as the link between high frequency resonances and\nlow frequency flicker. A highly coupled 3D multiphysics model has been set up\nto calculate the acoustic streaming velocity field inside the arc tube of\nhigh-intensity discharge lamps. It has been found that the velocity field\nsuffers a phase transition to an asymmetrical state at a critical acoustic\nstreaming force. The system behaves similar to a ferromagnet near the Curie\npoint. Furthermore, it is discussed how the model allows to investigate the\nlight flicker phenomenon. Concerning computer resources the procedure is\nconsiderably less demanding than a direct approach with a transient model.\n", "  Randomness is an unavoidable notion in discussing quantum physics, and this\nmay trigger the curiosity to know more of its cultural history. This text is an\ninvitation to explore the position on the matter of Thomas Aquinas, one of the\nmost prominent philosophers and theologians of the European Middle Ages.\n", "  We propose a quasi-particle model for the thermodynamic description of the\ngluon plasma which takes into account non-abelian characteristics of the\ngluonic field. This is accomplished utilizing massive non-linear plane wave\nsolutions of the classical equations of motion with a variable mass parameter,\nreflecting the scale invariance of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian. For the\nstatistical description of the gluon plasma we interpret these non-linear waves\nas quasi-particles with a temperature dependent mass distribution.\nQuasi-Gaussian distributions with a common variance but different temperature\ndependent mean masses for the longitudinal and transverse modes are employed.\nWe use recent Lattice results to fix the mean transverse and longitudinal\nmasses while the variance is fitted to the equation of state of pure $SU(3)$ on\nthe Lattice. Thus, our model succeeds to obtain both a consistent description\nof the gluon plasma energy density as well as a correct behaviour of the mass\nparameters near the critical point.\n", "  We estimate the thermalization time in two colliding shock waves holographic\nmodel of heavy-ion collisions. For this purpose we model the process by the\nVaidya metric with a horizon defined by the trapped surface location. We\nconsider two bottom-up AdS/QCD models that give, within the colliding shock\nwaves approach, the dependence of multiplicity on the energy compatible with\nRHIC and LHC results. One model is a bottom-up AdS/QCD confining model and the\nother is related to an anisotropic thermalization. We estimate the\nthermalization time and show that increasing the confining potential decreases\nthe thermalization time as well as an anisotropy accelerates the\nthermalization.\n", "  The Multigap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) are gas ionization detectors\nwith multiple gas sub-gaps made of resistive electrodes. The high voltage (HV)\nis applied on the outer surfaces of outermost resistive plates only, while the\ninterior plates are left electrically floating. The presence of multiple narrow\nsub--gaps with high electric field results in faster signals on the outer\nelectrodes, thus improving the detector's time resolution. Due to their\nexcellent performance and relatively low cost, the MRPC detector has found\npotential application in Time-of-Flight (TOF) systems. Here we present the\ndesign, fabrication, optimization of the operating parameters such as the HV,\nthe gas mixture composition, and, performance of six--gap glass MRPC detectors\nof area 27cm $\\times$ 27 cm, which are developed in order to find application\nas trigger detectors, in TOF measurement etc. The design has been optimized\nwith unique spacers and blockers to ensure a proper gas flow through the narrow\nsub-gaps, which are 250 $\\mu$m wide. The gas mixture consisting of R134A,\nIsobutane and SF$_{6}$, and the fraction of each constituting gases has been\noptimized after studying the MRPC performance for a set of different\nconcentrations. The counting efficiency of the MRPC is about 95% at $17.9$ kV.\nAt the same operating voltage, the time resolution, after correcting for the\nwalk effect, is found to be about $219$ ps.\n", "  The linear and non-linear behavior of the top reduced cross section in the\nLHeC region is considered concerning the boson-gluon fusion (BGF) model at the\ndeep inelastic scattering leptoproduction. We will show that the nonlinear\nbehavior, at this region, for the $t\\overline{t}$ production is very small.\nAlso the behavior of the top reduced cross section and the ratio $R^{t}$ in\nthis processes is considered.\n", "  We apply microcanonical ensemble considerations to suggest that, whenever it\nmay thermalize, a general disorder-free many-body Hamiltonian of a typical\natomic system has solid-like eigenstates at low energies and fluid-type (and\ngaseous, plasma) eigenstates associated with energy densities exceeding those\npresent in the melting (and, respectively, higher energy) transition(s). In\nparticular, the lowest energy density at which the eigenstates of such a clean\nmany body atomic system undergo a non-analytic change is that of the melting\n(or freezing) transition. We invoke this observation to analyze the evolution\nof a liquid upon supercooling (i.e., cooling rapidly enough to avoid\nsolidification below the freezing temperature). Expanding the wavefunction of a\nsupercooled liquid in the complete eigenbasis of the many-body Hamiltonian,\nonly the higher energy liquid-type eigenstates contribute significantly to\nmeasurable hydrodynamic relaxations (e.g., those probed by viscosity) while\nstatic thermodynamic observables become weighted averages over both solid- and\nliquid-type eigenstates. Consequently, when extrapolated to low temperatures,\nhydrodynamic relaxation times of deeply supercooled liquids (i.e., glasses) may\nseem to diverge at nearly the same temperature at which the extrapolated\nentropy of the supercooled liquid becomes that of the solid. In this formal\nquantum framework, the increasingly sluggish (and spatially heterogeneous)\ndynamics in supercooled liquids as their temperature is lowered stems from the\nexistence of the single non-analytic change of the eigenstates of the clean\nmany-body Hamiltonian at the equilibrium melting transition present in low\nenergy solid-type eigenstates. We derive a single (possibly computable)\ndimensionless parameter fit to the viscosity and suggest other testable\npredictions of our approach.\n", "  We derive the dynamical equations for a non-local gravity model in the\nPalatini formalism and we discuss some of the properties of this model. We have\nshown that, in some specific cases, the vacuum solutions of general relativity\nare also vacuum solutions of the non-local model, so we conclude that, at least\nin this case, the singularities of Einstein's gravity are not removed.\n", "  We analyze Cooper pairing instabilities in strongly driven electron-phonon\nsystems. The light-induced non-equilibrium state of phonons results in a\nsimultaneous increase of the superconducting coupling constant and the electron\nscattering. We demonstrate that the competition between these effects leads to\nan enhanced superconducting transition temperature in a broad range of\nparameters. Our results may explain the observed transient enhancement of\nsuperconductivity in several classes of materials upon irradiation with high\nintensity pulses of terahertz light, and may pave new ways for engineering\nhigh-temperature light-induced superconducting states.\n", "  Bipartite quantum systems from the chiral universality classes admit\ntopologically protected zero modes at point defects. However, in\ntwo-dimensional systems these states can be difficult to separate from\ncompacton-like localized states that arise from flat bands, formed if the two\nsublattices support a different number of sites within a unit cell. Here we\nidentify a natural reduction of chiral symmetry, obtained by coupling sites on\nthe majority sublattice, which gives rise to spectrally isolated point-defect\nstates, topologically characterized as zero modes supported by the\ncomplementary minority sublattice. We observe these states in a microwave\nrealization of a dimerized Lieb lattice with next-nearest neighbour coupling,\nand also demonstrate topological mode selection via sublattice-staggered\nabsorption.\n", "  The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg three-leg tube composed of the Heisenberg spin\ntriangles mutually coupled through the Ising inter-triangle interaction is\nexactly solved in a zero magnetic field. By making use of the local\nconservation for the total spin on each Heisenberg spin triangle the model can\nbe rigorously mapped onto a classical composite spin-chain model, which is\nsubsequently exactly treated through the transfer-matrix method. The\nground-state phase diagram, correlation functions, concurrence, Bell function,\nentropy and specific heat are examined in detail. It is shown that the spin\nfrustration represents an indispensable ground for a thermal entanglement,\nwhich is quantified with the help of concurrence. The specific heat displays\ndiverse temperature dependences, which may include a sharp low-temperature peak\nmimicking a temperature-driven first-order phase transition. It is convincingly\nevidenced that this anomalous peak originates from massive thermal excitations\nfrom the doubly degenerate ground state towards an excited state with a high\nmacroscopic degeneracy due to chiral degrees of freedom of the Heisenberg spin\ntriangles.\n", "  In this work, we report analytical results on transverse domain wall (TDW)\nstatics and field-driven dynamics in quasi one-dimensional biaxial nanowires\nunder arbitrary uniform transverse magnetic fields (TMFs) based on the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Without axial driving fields, the static TDW\nshould be symmetric about its center meanwhile twisted in its azimuthal angle\ndistribution. By decoupling of polar and azimuthal degrees of freedom, an\napproximate solution is provided which reproduces these features to a great\nextent. When an axial driving field is applied, the dynamical behavior of a TDW\nis viewed as the response of its static profile to external excitations. By\nmeans of the asymptotic expansion method, the TDW velocity in traveling-wave\nmode is obtained, which provides the extent and boundary of the\n\"velocity-enhancement\" effect of TMFs to TDWs in biaxial nanowires. Finally\nnumerical simulations are performed and strongly support our analytics.\n", "  The problem of constructing physically and mathematically well-defined Wigner\nfunctions for the canonical pair angle and angular momentum is solved. While a\nkey element for the construction of Wigner functions for the planar phase space\n(q,p) in R^2 is the Heisenberg-Weyl group, the corresponding group for the\ncylindrical phase space (theta,p) in S^1 x R is the Euclidean group E(2) of the\nplane and its unitary representations. Here the angle theta is replaced by the\npair (cos theta, sin theta) which corresponds uniquely to the points on the\nunit circle. The main structural properties of the Wigner functions for the\nplanar and the cylindrical phase spaces are strikingly similar. A crucial role\nplays the sinc function which provides the interpolation for the discontinuous\nquantized angular momenta in terms of the continuous classical ones, in\naccordance with the famous Whittaker cardinal function, well-known from\ninterpolation and sampling theories. The quantum mechanical marginal\ndistributions for angle (continuous) and angular momentum (discontinuous) are\nas usual uniquely obtained by appropriate integrations of the (theta,p) Wigner\nfunction. Among the examples discussed is an elementary system of simple \"cat\"\nstates.\n", "  Decades of research on thermoelectrics stimulated by the fact that nano- and\nmeso-scale thermoelectric transport could yield higher energy conversion\nefficiency and output power has recently uncovered a new direction on inelastic\nthermoelectric effects. We introduce the history, motivation, and perspectives\non mesoscopic inelastic thermoelectric effects.\n", "  The search for new significant peaks over a energy spectrum often involves a\nstatistical multiple hypothesis testing problem. Separate tests of hypothesis\nare conducted at different locations producing an ensemble of local p-values,\nthe smallest of which is reported as evidence for the new resonance.\nUnfortunately, controlling the false detection rate (type I error rate) of such\nprocedures may lead to excessively stringent acceptance criteria. In the recent\nphysics literature, two promising statistical tools have been proposed to\novercome these limitations. In 2005, a method to \"find needles in haystacks\"\nwas introduced by Pilla et al. [1], and a second method was later proposed by\nGross and Vitells [2] in the context of the \"look elsewhere effect\" and trial\nfactors. We show that, for relatively small sample sizes, the former leads to\nan artificial inflation of statistical power that stems from an increase in the\nfalse detection rate, whereas the two methods exhibit similar performance for\nlarge sample sizes. We apply the methods to realistic simulations of the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope data, in particular the search for dark matter\nannihilation lines. Further, we discuss the counter-intutive scenario where the\nlook-elsewhere corrections are more conservative than much more computationally\nefficient corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. Finally, we provide\ngeneral guidelines for navigating the tradeoffs between statistical and\ncomputational efficiency when selecting a statistical procedure for signal\ndetection.\n", "  Systematic and automatic calculations of the electronic band structure are a\ncrucial component of computationally-driven high-throughput materials\nscreening. An algorithm, for any crystal, to derive a unique description of the\ncrystal structure together with a recommended band path is indispensable for\nthis task. The electronic band structure is typically sampled along a path\nwithin the first Brillouin zone including the surface in reciprocal space. Some\npoints in reciprocal space have higher site symmetries and/or have higher\nconstraints than other points regarding the electronic band structure and\ntherefore are likely to be more important than other points. This work\ncategorizes points in reciprocal space according to their symmetry and provides\nrecommended band paths that cover all special wavevector (k-vector) points and\nlines necessarily and sufficiently. Points in reciprocal space are labeled such\nthat there is no conflict with the crystallographic convention. The k-vector\ncoefficients of labeled points, which are located at Brillouin zone face and\nedge centers as well as vertices, are derived based on a primitive cell\ncompatible with the crystallographic convention, including those with axial\nratio-dependent coordinates. Furthermore, we provide an open-source\nimplementation of the algorithms within our SeeK-path python code, to allow\nresearchers to obtain k-vector coefficients and recommended band paths in an\nautomated fashion. Finally, we created a free online service to compute and\nvisualise Brillouin Zone, labeled k-points and suggested band paths for any\ncrystal structure, that we made available at\nhttp://www.materialscloud.org/tools/seekpath/ .\n", "  We present a method for the nonparametric estimation of the drift function of\ncertain types of stochastic differential equations from the empirical density.\nIt is based on a variational formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation. The\nminimization of an empirical estimate of the variational functional using\nkernel based regularization can be performed in closed form. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the method on second order, Langevin-type equations and show how\nthe method can be generalized to other noise models.\n", "  Quantum geometrodynamics with intrinsic time development is presented.\nParadigm shift from full space-time covariance to spatial diffeomorphism\ninvariance yields a non-vanishing Hamiltonian, a resolution of the `problem of\ntime', and gauge-invariant temporal ordering in an ever expanding universe.\nEinstein's general relativity is a particular realization of a wider class of\ntheories; and the framework prompts natural extensions and improvements, with\nthe consequent dominance of Cotton-York potential at early times when the\nuniverse was small.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigate the quantum trajectories of\njointly monitored transmon qubits embedded in spatially separated microwave\ncavities. Using nearly quantum-noise limited superconducting amplifiers and an\noptimized setup to reduce signal loss between cavities, we can efficiently\ntrack measurement-induced entanglement generation as a continuous process for\nsingle realizations of the experiment. The quantum trajectories of transmon\nqubits naturally split into low and high entanglement classes corresponding to\nhalf-parity collapse. The distribution of concurrence is found at any given\ntime and we explore the dynamics of entanglement creation in the state space.\nThe distribution exhibits a sharp cut-off in the high concurrence limit,\ndefining a maximal concurrence boundary. The most likely paths of the qubits'\ntrajectories are also investigated, resulting in three probable paths,\ngradually projecting the system to two even subspaces and an odd subspace. We\nalso investigate the most likely time for the individual trajectories to reach\ntheir most entangled state, and find that there are two solutions for the local\nmaximum, corresponding to the low and high entanglement routes. The theoretical\npredictions show excellent agreement with the experimental entangled qubit\ntrajectory data.\n", "  We give a solution to the long-standing problem of constructing the\ngenerators of hidden symmetries of the quantum Higgs oscillator, a particle on\na d-sphere moving in a central potential varying as the inverse cosine-squared\nof the polar angle. This superintegrable system is known to possess a rich\nalgebraic structure, including a hidden SU(d) symmetry that can be deduced from\nclassical conserved quantities and degeneracies of the quantum spectrum. The\nquantum generators of this SU(d) have not been constructed thus far, except at\nd=2, and naive quantization of classical conserved quantities leads to deformed\nLie algebras with quadratic terms in the commutation relations. The nonlocal\ngenerators we obtain here satisfy the standard su(d) Lie algebra, and their\nconstruction relies on a recently discovered realization of the conformal\nalgebra, which contains a complete set of raising and lowering operators for\nthe Higgs oscillator. This operator structure has emerged from a relation\nbetween the Higgs oscillator Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon\nequation in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. From such a point-of-view, the\nconstruction of the hidden symmetry generators reduces to manipulations within\nthe abstract conformal algebra so(d,2).\n", "  The theory of quantum Brownian motion describes the properties of a large\nclass of open quantum systems. Nonetheless, its description in terms of a\nBorn-Markov master equation, widely used in the literature, is known to violate\nthe positivity of the density operator at very low temperatures. We study an\nextension of existing models, leading to an equation in the Lindblad form,\nwhich is free of this problem. We study the dynamics of the model, including\nthe detailed properties of its stationary solution, for both constant and\nposition-dependent coupling of the Brownian particle to the bath, focusing in\nparticular on the correlations and the squeezing of the probability\ndistribution induced by the environment\n", "  Complete set of cylindrical modes is constructed for the electromagnetic\nfield inside and outside a cylindrical shell in the background of $(D+1)$%\n-dimensional dS spacetime. On the shell, the field obeys the generalized\nperfect conductor boundary condition. For the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, we\nevaluate the expectation values (VEVs) of the electric field squared and of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. The shell-induced contributions are explicitly\nextracted. In this way, for points away from the shell, the renormalization is\nreduced to the one for the VEVs in the boundary-free dS bulk. As a special\ncase, the VEVs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the $(D+1)$%\n-dimensional Minkowski bulk. We show that the shell-induced contribution in the\nelectric field squared is positive for both the interior and exterior regions.\nThe corresponding Casimir-Polder forces are directed toward the shell. The\nvacuum energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the diagonal components, has a\nnonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the\ndirection normal to the shell. This flux is directed from the shell in both the\nexterior and interior regions. For points near the shell, the leading terms in\nthe asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal\ncomponents of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding\nexpressions in the Minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the\nproper distance in the dS bulk. The influence of the gravitational field on the\nlocal characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell\nlarger than the dS curvature radius. The results are extended for confining\nboundary conditions of flux tube models in QCD.\n", "  We study the possible rotation of cluster galaxies, developing, testing and\napplying a novel algorithm which identifies rotation, if such does exist, as\nwell as its rotational centre, its axis orientation, rotational velocity\namplitude and, finally, the clockwise or counterclockwise direction of rotation\non the plane of the sky. To validate our algorithms we construct realistic\nMonte Carlo mock rotating clusters and confirm that our method provides robust\nindications of rotation. We then apply our methodology on a sample of Abell\nclusters with z<~0.1 with member galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) DR10 spectroscopic data base. After excluding a number of\nsubstructured clusters, which could provide erroneous indications of rotation,\nand taking into account the expected fraction of misidentified coherent\nsubstructure velocities for rotation, provided by our Monte-Carlo simulation\nanalysis, we find that ~23% of our clusters are rotating under a set of strict\ncriteria. Loosening the strictness of the criteria, on the expense of\nintroducing spurious rotation indications, we find this fraction increasing to\n~28%. We correlate our rotation indicators with the cluster dynamical state,\nprovided either by their Bautz-Morgan type or by their X-ray isophotal shape\nand find for those clusters showing rotation within 1.5 h -1 70 Mpc that the\nsignificance of their rotation is related to the dynamically younger phases of\ncluster formation but after the initial anisotropic accretion and merging has\nbeen completed. Finally, finding rotational modes in galaxy clusters could lead\nto the necessity of correcting the dynamical cluster mass calculations.\n", "  The fastest possible collective response of a quantum many-body system is\nrelated to its excitations at the highest possible energy. In condensed-matter\nsystems, the corresponding timescale is typically set by the Fermi energy.\nTaking advantage of fast and precise control of interactions between ultracold\natoms, we report on the observation of ultrafast dynamics of impurities coupled\nto an atomic Fermi sea. Our interferometric measurements track the\nnon-perturbative quantum evolution of a fermionic many-body system, revealing\nin real time the formation dynamics of quasiparticles and the quantum\ninterference between attractive and repulsive states throughout the full depth\nof the Fermi sea. Ultrafast time-domain methods to manipulate and investigate\nstrongly interacting quantum gases open up new windows on the dynamics of\nquantum matter under extreme non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  Highly connected recurrent neural networks often produce chaotic dynamics,\nmeaning their precise activity is sensitive to small perturbations. What are\nthe consequences for how such networks encode streams of temporal stimuli? On\nthe one hand, chaos is a strong source of randomness, suggesting that small\nchanges in stimuli will be obscured by intrinsically generated variability. On\nthe other hand, recent work shows that the type of chaos that occurs in spiking\nnetworks can have a surprisingly low-dimensional structure, suggesting that\nthere may be \"room\" for fine stimulus features to be precisely resolved. Here\nwe show that strongly chaotic networks produce patterned spikes that reliably\nencode time-dependent stimuli: using a decoder sensitive to spike times on\ntimescales of 10's of ms, one can easily distinguish responses to very similar\ninputs. Moreover, recurrence serves to distribute signals throughout chaotic\nnetworks so that small groups of cells can encode substantial information about\nsignals arriving elsewhere. A conclusion is that the presence of strong chaos\nin recurrent networks does not prohibit precise stimulus encoding.\n", "  We present an XMM-Newton X-ray observation of TRAPPIST-1, which is an\nultracool dwarf star recently discovered to host three transiting and temperate\nEarth-sized planets. We find the star is a relatively strong and variable\ncoronal X-ray source with an X-ray luminosity similar to that of the quiet Sun,\ndespite its much lower bolometric luminosity. We find L_x/L_bol=2-4x10^-4, with\nthe total XUV emission in the range L_xuv/L_bol=6-9x10^-4, and XUV irradiation\nof the planets that is many times stronger than experienced by the present-day\nEarth. Using a simple energy-limited model we show that the relatively close-in\nEarth-sized planets, which span the classical habitable zone of the star, are\nsubject to sufficient X-ray and EUV irradiation to significantly alter their\nprimary and any secondary atmospheres. Understanding whether this high-energy\nirradiation makes the planets more or less habitable is a complex question, but\nour measured fluxes will be an important input to the necessary models of\natmospheric evolution.\n", "  Hadronic states composed of multi-quark flavors may exist in reality since\nthey are not prohibited by QCD. Compact four quark systems of color singlet are\nclassified as tetraquarks. To understand the properties of these states, more\ntheoretical and experimental efforts are needed. In this work, we study charmed\ntetraquarks with three light flavors using flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry. States with\nthree different light quarks must be in a ${\\bf \\bar 6 }$ or a ${\\bf 15}$\nmultiplet. We investigate the production of charmed tetraquarks $X_c$ in $B\\to\nX_c (\\overline {X}_c) P$ and $B_c \\to X_c P$ decays. Whether the states with\nthree light quarks belong to ${\\bf \\bar 6}$ or ${\\bf 15}$ can be determined by\nstudying various tetraquark $B$ and $B_c$ decays. We demonstrate that the decay\namplitudes for these decays can be parametrized by a few irreducible SU(3)\ninvariant amplitudes. We then derive relations for decay widths and CP\nviolating rate difference which can be examined experimentally. Although no\nexperimental measurement is available yet, they might be accessed at the\nongoing and forthcoming experiments like the LHCb and Belle-II. Measurements of\nthese observables can not only provide useful information for the study of\nexotics spectroscopy but are also valuable information towards a better\nunderstanding of some non-perturbative aspects of QCD.\n", "  Metallic nanoparticles offer possibilities to build basic electric devices\nwith new functionality and improved performance. Due to the small volume and\nthe resulting low self-capacitance, each single nanoparticle exhibits a high\ncharging energy. Thus, a Coulomb-energy gap emerges during transport\nexperiments that can be shifted by electric fields, allowing for charge\ntransport whenever energy levels of neighboring particles match. Hence, the\nstate of the device changes sequentially between conducting and non-conducting\ninstead of just one transition from conducting to pinch-off as in\nsemiconductors. To exploit this behavior for field-effect transistors, it is\nnecessary to use uniform nanoparticles in ordered arrays separated by\nwell-defined tunnel barriers. In this work, CoPt nanoparticles with a narrow\nsize distribution are synthesized by colloidal chemistry. These particles are\ndeposited via the scalable Langmuir-Blodgett technique as ordered, homogeneous\nmonolayers onto Si/SiO2 substrates with pre-patterned gold electrodes. The\nresulting nanoparticle arrays are limited to stripes of adjustable lengths and\nwidths. In such a defined channel with a limited number of conduction paths the\ncurrent can be controlled precisely by a gate voltage. Clearly pronounced\nCoulomb oscillations are observed up to temperatures of 150 K. Using such\nsystems as field-effect transistors yields unprecedented oscillating current\nmodulations with on/off-ratios of around 70 %.\n", "  On the basis of many-body {\\it ab-initio} calculations, using single-shot\nG$_0$W$_0$ method and Bethe-Salpeter equation, we study phosphorene nanoribbons\n(PNRs) in the two typical zigzag and armchair directions. The electronic\nstructure, optical absorption, electron-hole (exciton) binding energy, exciton\nexchange splitting, and exciton wave functions are calculated for different\nsize of PNRs. The typically strong splitting between singlet and triplet\nexcitonic states make PNRs favorable systems for application in optoelectronic.\nQuantum confinement occurs in both kinds of PNRs, and it is stronger in the\nzPNRs, as behave like quasi-zero-dimensional systems. Scaling laws are\ninvestigated for the size-dependent behaviors of PNRs. The first bright\nexcitonic state in PNRs is explored in detail.\n", "  We analyze the quantum evolution represented by a time-dependent family of\ngeneralized Pauli channels. This evolution is provided by the random\ndecoherence channels with respect to the maximal number of mutually unbiased\nbases. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the vanishing\nback-flow of information.\n", "  We develop a new off-shell formulation for six-dimensional conformal\nsupergravity obtained by gauging the 6D ${\\cal N} = (1, 0)$ superconformal\nalgebra in superspace. This formulation is employed to construct two invariants\nfor 6D ${\\cal N} = (1, 0)$ conformal supergravity, which contain $C^3$ and\n$C\\Box C$ terms at the component level. Using a conformal supercurrent\nanalysis, we prove that these exhaust all such invariants in minimal conformal\nsupergravity. Finally, we show how to construct the supersymmetric $F \\Box F$\ninvariant in curved superspace.\n", "  Hot Jupiters (HJs) are Jupiter-like planets that reside very closely to their\nhost star, within $\\sim 0.1\\,\\mathrm{AU}$. Their formation is not well\nunderstood. It is generally believed that they cannot have formed in situ,\nimplying that some form of migration must have occurred after their initial\nformation. We study the production of HJs through secular evolution in\nmultiplanet systems with three to five planets. In this variant of high-$e$\nmigration, the eccentricity of the orbit of the innermost planet is excited on\nsecular time-scales, triggering orbital migration due to tidal dissipation. We\nuse a secular dynamics code and carry out a population synthesis study. We find\nthat HJs are only produced if the viscous time-scale is short ($\\approx 0.014$\nyr). In contrast, in up to $\\approx 0.3$ of systems, the innermost planet is\ntidally disrupted. The orbital period distribution is peaked around 5 d,\nconsistent with observations. The median HJ mass is $1\\,M_\\mathrm{J}$ with a\nmaximum of $\\approx 2 \\, M_\\mathrm{J}$, similar to observed HJs. Approximately\n0.1 of the HJs have retrograde orbits with respect to the stellar spin. We do\nnot find any warm Jupiters in our simulations, i.e. planets with semimajor axes\nbetween 0.1 and 1 AU.\n", "  Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) can release\ntheir enormous rotational energy via magnetic spin-down, providing a power\nsource for bright transients such as superluminous supernovae. On the other\nhand, particularly massive (so-called supramassive) neutron stars require a\nminimum rotation rate to support their mass against gravitational collapse,\nbelow which the neutron star collapses to a black hole. We model the light\ncurves of supernovae powered by magnetars which transform into black holes.\nAlthough the peak luminosities can reach high values in the range of\nsuperluminous supernovae, their post maximum light curves can decline very\nrapidly because of the sudden loss of the central energy input. Early black\nhole transformation also enhances the shock breakout signal from the\nmagnetar-driven bubble relative to the main supernova peak. Our synthetic light\ncurves of supernovae powered by magnetars transforming to black holes are\nconsistent with those of some rapidly evolving bright transients recently\nreported by Arcavi et al. (2016).\n", "  Bismuth-doped luminescent materials have gained significant attention in the\npast years owing to their huge potential for the applications in\ntelecommunications, biomedicine, and displays. However, the controlled\nsynthesis of these materials, in particular for those luminescing in the\nnear-infrared (NIR), remains a challenging subject of continuous research\neffort. Herein, we show that the low-temperature topotactic reduction by using\nAl metal powders as oxygen getters can be adopted as a powerful technique for\nthe conversion of bismuth-doped red-emitting systems into NIR-emitting cousins\nas a result of the creation of unique crystalline networks. Thorough\nexperimental characterization indicates that the framework oxygen of hosts can\nbe topotactically extracted, thus producing unique metal-oxygen-metal networks\nin the reduced phases while preserving the crystalline structure of the\nprecursor. We anticipate that this low-temperature topotactic reduction\nstrategy can be applied to the development of more novel Bi-doped luminescent\nmaterials in various forms that can find a broad range of functional\napplications.\n", "  We consider limits on the local ($z=0$) density ($n_0$) of extragalactic\nneutrino sources set by the nondetection of steady high-energy neutrino sources\nproducing $\\gtrsim50$ TeV muon multiplets in the present IceCube data, taking\ninto account the redshift evolution, luminosity function and neutrino spectrum\nof the sources. We show that the lower limit depends moderately on source\nspectra and strongly on redshift evolution. We find\n$n_0\\gtrsim{10}^{-8}-{10}^{-7}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ for standard candle sources\nevolving rapidly, $n_s\\propto{(1+z)}^3$, and\n$n_0\\gtrsim{10}^{-6}-{10}^{-5}~{\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ for nonevolving sources. The\ncorresponding upper limits on their neutrino luminosity are $L_{{\\nu_\\mu}}^{\\rm\neff}\\lesssim10^{42}-10^{43}~{\\rm erg}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ and $L_{{\\nu_\\mu}}^{\\rm\neff}\\lesssim10^{41}-10^{42}~{\\rm erg}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$, respectively. Applying\nthese results to a wide range of classes of potential sources, we show that\npowerful blazar jets associated with active galactic nuclei are unlikely to be\nthe dominant sources. For almost all other steady candidate source classes\n(including starbursts, radio galaxies, and galaxy clusters and groups), an\norder of magnitude increase in the detector sensitivity at $\\sim0.1-1$ PeV will\nenable a detection (as point sources) of the few brightest objects. Such an\nincrease, which may be provided by next-generation detectors like IceCube-Gen2\nand an upgraded KM3NET, can improve the limit on $n_0$ by more than two orders\nof magnitude. Future gamma-ray observations (by Fermi, HAWC and CTA) will play\na key role in confirming the association of the neutrinos with their sources.\n", "  A search for supersymmetry in events with large missing transverse momentum,\njets, and at least one hadronically decaying tau lepton has been performed\nusing 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Two\nexclusive final states are considered, with either exactly one or at least two\ntau leptons. No excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed in the\ndata. Results are interpreted in the context of gauge-mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking and a simplified model of gluino pair production with tau-rich cascade\ndecays, substantially improving on previous limits. In the GMSB model\nconsidered, supersymmetry-breaking scale ($\\Lambda$) values below 92 TeV are\nexcluded at the 95% confidence level, corresponding to gluino masses below 2000\nGeV. For large values of $\\tan\\beta$, values of $\\Lambda$ up to 107 TeV and\ngluino masses up to 2300 GeV are excluded. In the simplified model, gluino\nmasses are excluded up to 1570 GeV for neutralino masses around 100 GeV.\nNeutralino masses up to 700 GeV are excluded for all gluino masses between 800\nGeV and 1500 GeV, while the strongest exclusion of 750 GeV is achieved for\ngluino masses around 1400 GeV.\n", "  We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework to characterise the\npredictions from two independent galaxy formation models for the galactic\ncontent of dark matter haloes and its evolution with redshift. Our galaxy\nsamples correspond to a range of fixed number densities defined by stellar mass\nand span $0 \\le z \\le 3$. We find remarkable similarities between the model\npredictions. Differences arise at low galaxy number densities which are\nsensitive to the treatment of heating of the hot halo by active galactic\nnuclei. The evolution of the form of the HOD can be described in a relatively\nsimple way, and we model each HOD parameter using its value at $z=0$ and an\nadditional evolutionary parameter. In particular, we find that the ratio\nbetween the characteristic halo masses for hosting central and satellite\ngalaxies can serve as a sensitive diagnostic for galaxy evolution models. Our\nresults can be used to test and develop empirical studies of galaxy evolution\nand can facilitate the construction of mock galaxy catalogues for future\nsurveys.\n", "  In an earlier paper it was demonstrated that the hypothesized electrostatic\nversion of the Aharonov-Bohm (\"AB\") effect does not exist. The conclusion\nfollows straightforwardly once one recognizes that interference takes place in\nthe configuration space of the entire system, including the experimental\napparatus, and the wavefunction of the apparatus cannot be ignored. Two\nadditional results are presented here. 1. Observations of interference that had\nbeen attributed to an analogue of the electrostatic AB effect (or \"scalar\neffect\") are actually due to a magnetic AB effect. 2. In the original magnetic\nAB effect itself, there is no phase shift if it is possible effectively to\nshield the solenoid from the influence of the passing electron. This result is\nnot in conflict with the landmark experiments of Tonomura and colleagues if\nWang's recent claim is correct, that superconductive shielding could not have\nisolated the toroidal magnet from the magnetic pulse of the passing electron.\n", "  We introduce a new matrix function for studying graphs and real-world\nnetworks based on a double-factorial penalization of walks between nodes in a\ngraph. This new matrix function is based on the matrix error function. We find\na very good approximation of this function using a matrix hyperbolic tangent\nfunction. We derive a communicability function, a subgraph centrality and a\ndouble-factorial Estrada index based on this new matrix function. We obtain\nupper and lower bounds for the double-factorial Estrada index of graphs,\nshowing that they are similar to those of the single-factorial Estrada index.\nWe then compare these indices with the single-factorial one for simple graphs\nand real-world networks. We conclude that for networks containing chordless\ncycles---holes---the two penalization schemes produce significantly different\nresults. In particular, we study two series of real-world networks representing\nurban street networks, and protein residue networks. We observe that the\nsubgraph centrality based on both indices produce significantly different\nranking of the nodes. The use of the double factorial penalization of walks\nopens new possibilities for studying important structural properties of\nreal-world networks where long-walks play a fundamental role, such as the cases\nof networks containing chordless cycles.\n", "  We calculate the $\\pi^0\\to \\gamma^*\\gamma^*$ transition form factor ${\\cal\nF}_{\\pi^0\\gamma^*\\gamma^*}(q_1^2,q_2^2)$ in lattice QCD with two flavors of\nquarks. Our main motivation is to provide the input to calculate the\n$\\pi^0$-pole contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon\n$(g-2)$, $a_\\mu^{\\rm HLbL;\\pi^0}$. We therefore focus on the region where both\nphotons are spacelike up to virtualities of about $1.5~$GeV$^2$, which has so\nfar not been experimentally accessible. Results are obtained in the continuum\nat the physical pion mass by a combined extrapolation. We reproduce the\nprediction of the chiral anomaly for real photons with an accuracy of about\n$8-9\\%$. We also compare to various recently proposed models and find\nreasonable agreement for the parameters of some of these models with their\nphenomenological values. Finally, we use the parametrization of our lattice\ndata by these models to calculate $a_\\mu^{\\rm HLbL;\\pi^0}$.\n", "  We consider the sub-gap physics of a hybrid double-quantum dot Cooper-pair\nsplitter with large single-level spacings, in the presence of tunnelling\nbetween the dots and finite Coulomb intra- and inter-dot Coulomb repulsion. In\nthe limit of a large superconducting gap, we treat the coupling of the dots to\nthe superconductor exactly. We employ a generalized master-equation method\nwhich easily yields currents, noise and cross-correlators. In particular, for\nfinite inter- and intra-dot Coulomb interaction, we investigate how the\ntransport properties are determined by the interplay between local and nonlocal\ntunneling processes between the superconductor and the dots. We examine the\neffect of inter-dot tunneling on the particle-hole symmetry of the currents\nwith and without spin-orbit interaction. We show that spin-orbit interaction in\ncombination with finite Coulomb energy opens the possibility to control the\nnonlocal entanglement and its symmetry (singlet/triplet). We demonstrate that\nthe generation of nonlocal entanglement can be achieved even without any direct\nnonlocal coupling to the superconducting lead.\n", "  The internal degrees of freedom provided by ultracold atoms give a route for\nrealizing higher dimensional physics in systems with limited spatial\ndimensions. Non-spatial degrees of freedom in these systems are dubbed\n\"synthetic dimensions\". This connection is useful from an experimental\nstandpoint but complicated by the fact that interactions alter the condensate\nground state. Here we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation to study ground state\nproperties of a spin-1 Bose gas under the combined influence of an optical\nlattice, spin-orbit coupling, and interactions at the mean field level. The\nassociated phases depend on the sign of the spin-dependent interaction\nparameter and the strength of the optical lattice potential. We find \"charge\"\nand spin density wave phases which are directly related to helical spin order\nin real space and affect the behavior of edge currents in the synthetic\ndimension. We determine the resulting phase diagram as a function of the\nspin-orbit coupling and spin-dependent interaction strength, considering both\nattractive (ferromagnetic) and repulsive (polar) spin-dependent interactions.\nOur results are applicable to current and future experiments, specifically with\n$^{87}$Rb, $^{7}$Li, $^{41}$K, and $^{23}$Na.\n", "  Relativistic cryptography exploits the fact that no information can travel\nfaster than the speed of light in order to obtain security guarantees that\ncannot be achieved from the laws of quantum mechanics alone. Recently, Lunghi\net al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2015] presented a bit commitment scheme where each\nparty uses two agents that exchange classical information in a synchronized\nfashion, and that is both hiding and binding. A caveat is that the commitment\ntime is intrinsically limited by the spatial configuration of the players, and\nincreasing this time requires the agents to exchange messages during the whole\nduration of the protocol. While such a solution remains computationally\nattractive, its practicality is severely limited in realistic settings since\nall communication must remain perfectly synchronized at all times.\n  In this work, we introduce a robust protocol for relativistic bit commitment\nthat tolerates failures of the classical communication network. This is done by\nadding a third agent to both parties. Our scheme provides a quadratic\nimprovement in terms of expected sustain time compared to the original\nprotocol, while retaining the same level of security.\n", "  Spin-bearing molecules can be stabilized on surfaces and in junctions with\ndesirable properties such as a net spin that can be adjusted by external\nstimuli. Using scanning probes, initial and final spin states can be deduced\nfrom topographic or spectroscopic data, but how the system transitioned between\nthese states is largely unknown. Here we address this question by manipulating\nthe total spin of magnetic cobalt hydride complexes on a corrugated boron\nnitride surface with a hydrogen- functionalized scanning probe tip by\nsimultaneously tracking force and conductance. When the additional hydrogen\nligand is brought close to the cobalt monohydride, switching between a corre-\nlated S = 1 /2 Kondo state, where host electrons screen the magnetic moment,\nand a S = 1 state with magnetocrystalline anisotropy is observed. We show that\nthe total spin changes when the system is transferred onto a new potential\nenergy surface defined by the position of the hydrogen in the junction. These\nresults show how and why chemically functionalized tips are an effective tool\nto manipulate adatoms and molecules, and a promising new method to selectively\ntune spin systems.\n", "  Quantum magnets on kagome lattice geometries in two and three spatial\ndimensions are archetypal examples of spin systems in which geometric\nfrustration inhibits conventional magnetic ordering and instead benefits the\nemergence of long-range entangled spin liquids at low temperature. Here we\nemploy a recently developed pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group\n(pf-FRG) approach to study the low-temperature quantum magnetism of kagome and\nhyperkagome spin systems with exchange interactions beyond the nearest neighbor\ncoupling. We find that next-nearest neighbor couplings stabilize a variety of\nmagnetic orders as well as induce additional spin liquid regimes giving rise to\nrather rich phase diagrams, which we characterize in detail. On a technical\nlevel, we find that the pf-FRG approach is in excellent quantitative agreement\nwith high-temperature series expansions over their range of validity and it\nexhibits a systematic finite-size convergence in the temperature regime below.\nWe discuss notable advantages and some current limitations of the pf-FRG\napproach in the ongoing search for unconventional forms of quantum magnetism.\n", "  This paper applies the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) statistical ensemble\ntechnique to estimate small molecule solvation free energies. There is a wide\nrange of methods available for predicting solvation free energies, ranging from\nempirical statistical models to ab initio quantum mechanical approaches. Each\nof these methods is based on a set of conceptual assumptions that can affect\npredictive accuracy and transferability. Using an iterative statistical\nprocess, we have selected and combined solvation energy estimates using an\nensemble of 17 diverse methods from the fourth Statistical Assessment of\nModeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) blind prediction study to form a\nsingle, aggregated solvation energy estimate. The ensemble design process\nevaluates the statistical information in each individual method as well as the\nperformance of the aggregate estimate obtained from the ensemble as a whole.\nMethods that possess minimal or redundant information are pruned from the\nensemble and the evaluation process repeats until aggregate predictive\nperformance can no longer be improved. We show that this process results in a\nfinal aggregate estimate that outperforms all individual methods by reducing\nestimate errors by as much as 91% to 1.2 kcal/mol accuracy. We also compare our\niterative refinement approach to other statistical ensemble approaches and\ndemonstrate that this iterative process reduces estimate errors by as much as\n61%. This work provides a new approach for accurate solvation free energy\nprediction and lays the foundation for future work on aggregate models that can\nbalance computational cost with prediction accuracy.\n", "  We explore interactions of elastic waves propagating in plates (with soil\nparameters) structured with concrete pillars buried in the soil. Pillars are 2\nm in diameter, 30 m in depth and the plate is 50 m in thickness. We study the\nfrequency range 5 to 10 Hz, for which Rayleigh wave wavelengths are smaller\nthan the plate thickness. This frequency range is compatible with frequency\nranges of particular interest in earthquake engineering. It is demonstrated in\nthis paper that two seismic cloaks' configurations allow for an unprecedented\nflow of elastodynamic energy associated with Rayleigh surface waves. The first\ncloak design is inspired by some approximation of ideal cloaks' parameters\nwithin the framework of thin plate theory. The second, more accomplished but\nmore involved, cloak design is deduced from a geometric transform in the full\nNavier equations that preserves the symmetry of the elasticity tensor but leads\nto Willis' equations, well approximated by a homogenization procedure, as\ncorroborated by numerical simulations. The two cloaks's designs are strikingly\ndifferent, and the superior efficiency of the second type of cloak emphasizes\nthe necessity for rigor in transposition of existing cloaks's designs in thin\nplates to the geophysics setting. Importantly, we focus our attention on\ngeometric transforms applied to thick plates, which is an intermediate case\nbetween thin plates and semi-infinite media, not studied previously. Cloaking\nefficiency (reduction of the disturbance of the wave wavefront and its\namplitude behind an obstacle) and protection (reduction of the wave amplitude\nwithin the center of the cloak) are studied for ideal and approximated cloaks'\nparameters. These results represent a preliminary step towards designs of\nseismic cloaks for surface Rayleigh waves propagating in sedimentary soils\nstructured with concrete pillars.\n", "  We explore the possible Proxima Centauri b's interiors assuming the planet\nbelongs to the class of dense solid planets (rocky with possible addition of\nwater) and derive the corresponding radii. To do so, we use an internal\nstructure model that computes the radius of the planet along with the locations\nof the different layers of materials, assuming that its mass and bulk\ncomposition are known. Lacking detailed elementary abundances of the host star\nto constrain the planet's composition, we base our model on solar system\nvalues. We restrained the simulations to the case of solid planets without\nmassive atmospheres. With these assumptions, the possible radius of Proxima\nCentauri b spans the 0.94--1.40 $R_\\oplus$ range. The minimum value is obtained\nconsidering a 1.10 $M_\\oplus$ Mercury-like planet with a 65% core mass\nfraction, whereas the highest radius is reached for 1.46 $M_\\oplus$ with 50%\nwater in mass, constituting an ocean planet. Although this range of radii still\nallows very different planet compositions, it helps characterizing many aspects\nof Proxima Centauri b, such as the formation conditions of the system or the\ncurrent amount of water on the planet. This work can also help ruling out\nfuture measurements of the planet's radius that would be physically\nincompatible with a solid planetary body.\n", "  Static configurations and a dynamical evolution of the system composed of a\nhigher-dimensional spherically symmetric dilaton black hole and the\nDirac-Goto-Nambu brane were investigated. The studies were conducted for three\nvalues of the dilaton coupling constant, describing the uncoupled case, the\nlow-energy limit of the string theory and dimensionally reduced Klein-Kaluza\ntheories. When the black hole is nonextremal, two types of static\nconfigurations are observed, a brane which intersects the black hole horizon\nand a brane not having any common points with the accompanying black hole. As\nthe number of spacetime dimensions increases, the brane bend in the vicinity of\nthe black hole disappears closer to its horizon. Dynamical evolution of the\nsystem results in an expulsion of the black hole from the brane. It proceeds\nfaster for bigger values of the bulk spacetime dimension and thicker branes.\nThe value of the dilatonic coupling constant does not influence neither the\nstatic configurations nor the dynamical behavior of the examined nonextremal\nsystem. In the extremal dilaton black hole case one obtains expulsion of the\nbrane which is independent on the spacetime dimensionality and the value of the\ncoupling constant. Dynamical studies of the configurations in the extremal case\nreveal that the course of evolution of the system is similar to the nonextremal\none, except for a slightly earlier expulsion of the black hole from the brane.\n", "  The boson peak appears in all amorphous solids and is an excess of\nvibrational states at low frequencies compared to the phonon spectrum of the\ncorresponding crystal. Until recently, the consensus was that it originated\nfrom \"defects\" in the glass. The nature of these defects is still under\ndiscussion, but the picture of regions with locally disturbed short-range order\nand/or decreased elastic constants has gained some traction. Recently, a\ndifferent theory was proposed: The boson peak was attributed to the first van\nHove singularity of crystal lattices which is only smeared out by the disorder.\nThis new viewpoint assumes that the van Hove singularity is simply shifted by\nthe decreased density of the amorphous state and is therefore not a\nglass-specific anomaly. In order to resolve this issue, we use computer models\nof a four-component alloy, alternatively with chemical disorder (high-entropy\nalloy), structural disorder, and reduced density. Comparison to a reference\nglass of the same composition reveals that the boson peak consists of\nadditional vibrational modes which can be induced solely by structural\ndisorder. While chemical disorder introduces fluctuations of the elastic\nconstants, we find that those do not lead to sufficient local softening to\ninduce these modes. A boson peak due to a reduction of density could be\nexcluded for the present metallic system.\n", "  We investigated coercive fields of 200nm x 1200nm x 5nm rectangular\nnanocrystalline thin films as a function of grain size D using finite elements\nsimulations. To this end, we created granular finite element models with grain\nsizes ranging from 5nm to 60nm, and performed micromagnetic hysteresis\ncalculations along the y-axis (easy direction) as well as along the x-axis\n(hard direction). We then used an extended Random Anisotropy model to interpret\nthe results and to illustrate the interplay of random anisotropy and shape\ninduced anisotropy, which is coherent on a much larger scale, in thin films.\n", "  Side and top silicon nitride stressors were proposed and shown to be\neffective ways to reduce the threshold current Ith and improve the wall-plug\nefficiency {\\eta}wp of Ge-on-Si lasers. Side stressors only turned out to be a\nmore efficient way to increase {\\eta}wp than using top and side stressors\ntogether. With the side stressors only and geometry optimizations, a {\\eta}wp\nof 30.5% and an Ith of 50 mA (Jth of 37 kA/cm2) can be achieved with the defect\nlimited carrier lifetime of 1 nsec. With the defect limited carrier lifetime of\n10 nsec, an Ith of 7.8 mA (Jth of 5.8 kA/cm2) and a wall-plug efficiency of\n38.7% can be achieved. These are tremendous improvements from the case without\nany stressors. These results give strong support to the Ge-on-Si laser\ntechnology and provide an effective way to improve the Ge laser performance.\n", "  The dipole excitations for calcium and zirconium isotopes are studied within\nthe fully self-consistent Hartree-Fock mean field incorporated with the\nrenormalized random-phase approximation (RRPA) using the Skyrme interaction\nSLy5. The RRPA takes into account the effect of ground-state correlations\nbeyond RPA owing to the Pauli principle between the particle-hole pairs that\nform the RPA excitations as well as the correlations due to the\nparticle-particle and hole-hole transitions, whose effects are treated here in\nan effective way. By comparing the RPA results with the RRPA ones, which are\nobtained for isoscalar (IS) and isovector (IV) dipole excitations in $^{48, 52,\n58}$Ca and $^{90, 96, 110}$Zr, it is shown that ground-state correlations\nbeyond the RPA reduce the IS transition strengths. They also shift up the\nenergy of the lowest IV dipole state and slightly push down the peak energy of\nthe IV giant dipole resonance. As the result, the energy-weighted sums of\nstrengths of both IS and IV modes decrease, causing the violation of the\ncorresponding energy-weight sum rules (EWSR). It is shown that this sum rule\nviolation can be eliminated by taking into account the contribution of the\nparticle-particle and hole-hole excitations together with the particle-hole\nones in a simple and perturbative way. Consequently, the ratio of the\nenergy-weighted sum of strengths of the pygmy dipole resonance to that of the\ngiant dipole resonance increases.\n", "  Recently, a significant carbon-14 enhancement in the year 994 in tree rings\nhas been found, suggesting an extremely large cosmic ray flux event during a\nshort period. The origin of this particular cosmic ray event has not been\nconfirmed, but one possibility is that it is of solar origin. Contemporary\nhistorical records of low latitude auroras can be used as supporting evidence\nfor intense solar activity around that time. We investigated the previously\nreported as well as the new records found in contemporary observations from the\n990s to determine potential auroras. Records of potential red auroras in the\nlate 992 and early 993 were found around the world, i.e. in the Korean\nPeninsula, Germany, and the Island of Ireland, suggesting the occurrence of an\nintense geomagnetic storm driven by solar activity.\n", "  Environmental effects and intrinsic energy-loss processes lead to\nfluctuations in the operational temperature of solar cells, which can\nprofoundly influence their power conversion efficiency. Here we determine from\nfirst principles the effects of temperature on the band gap and band edges of\nthe hybrid pervoskite CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ by accounting for electron-phonon\ncoupling and thermal expansion. From $290$ to $380$ K, the computed band gap\nchange of $40$ meV coincides with the experimental change of $30$-$40$ meV. The\ncalculation of electron-phonon coupling in CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ is particularly\nintricate, as the commonly used Allen-Heine-Cardona theory overestimates the\nband gap change with temperature, and excellent agreement with experiment is\nonly obtained when including high-order terms in the electron-phonon\ninteraction. We also find that spin-orbit coupling enhances the electron-phonon\ncoupling strength, but that the inclusion of nonlocal correlations using hybrid\nfunctionals has little effect. We reach similar conclusions in the metal-halide\nperovskite CsPbI$_3$. Our results unambiguously confirm for the first time the\nimportance of high-order terms in the electron-phonon coupling by direct\ncomparison with experiment.\n", "  Using the concept of strong necessary conditions (CSNC), we derive Bogomolny\nequations and BPS bounds for two modifications of the gauged baby BPS Skyrme\nmodel: the nonminimal coupling to the gauge field and k-deformed model. In\nparticular, we study, how the Bogomolny equations and the equation for the\npotential, reflect these two modifications. In both examples, the CSNC method\nshows to be a very useful tool.\n", "  At present, there are theoretical models of radio pulsar evolution which\npredict both the alignment, i.e., evolution of inclination angle $\\chi$ between\nmagnetic and rotational axes to $0^{\\circ}$, and its counter-alignment, i.e.,\nevolution to $90^{\\circ}$. At the same time, both models well describe the\npulsar distribution on $P$-$\\dot P$ diagram. For this reason, up to now it was\nimpossible to determine the braking mechanisms since it was rather difficult to\nestimate inclination angle evolution on the basis of observation. In this paper\nwe demonstrate that statistics of interpulse pulsars can give us the key to\nsolve alignment/counter-alignment problem as the number of interpulse pulsars\n(both, having $\\chi \\sim 0^{\\circ}$ and $\\chi \\sim 90^{\\circ}$) drastically\ndepends on evolution of inclination angle.\n", "  Our understanding of the cosmic evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\nhas been revolutionized by the advent of large multiwavelength extragalactic\nsurveys, which have enabled detailed statistical studies of the host galaxies\nand large-scale structures of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We give an overview\nof some recent results on SMBH evolution, including the connection between AGN\nactivity and star formation in galaxies, the role of galaxy mergers in fueling\nAGN activity, the nature of luminous obscured AGN, and the connection between\nAGN and their host dark matter halos. We conclude by looking to the future of\nlarge-scale extragalactic X-ray and spectroscopic surveys.\n", "  Learning from the crowd has become increasingly popular in the Web and social\nmedia. There is a wide variety of crowdlearning sites in which, on the one\nhand, users learn from the knowledge that other users contribute to the site,\nand, on the other hand, knowledge is reviewed and curated by the same users\nusing assessment measures such as upvotes or likes.\n  In this paper, we present a probabilistic modeling framework of\ncrowdlearning, which uncovers the evolution of a user's expertise over time by\nleveraging other users' assessments of her contributions. The model allows for\nboth off-site and on-site learning and captures forgetting of knowledge. We\nthen develop a scalable estimation method to fit the model parameters from\nmillions of recorded learning and contributing events. We show the\neffectiveness of our model by tracing activity of ~25 thousand users in Stack\nOverflow over a 4.5 year period. We find that answers with high knowledge value\nare rare. Newbies and experts tend to acquire less knowledge than users in the\nmiddle range. Prolific learners tend to be also proficient contributors that\npost answers with high knowledge value.\n", "  We numerically study two non-interacting fermion models, a quantum wire model\nand a Cherninsulator model, governed by open system Linblad dynamics. The\nphysical setup consists of a unitarilyevolving \"bulk\" coupled via its\nboundaries to two dissipative \"leads\". The open system dynamics ischosen to\ndrive the leads to thermal equilibrium, and by choosing different temperatures\nand chemicalpotentials for the two leads we may drive the bulk into a\nnon-equilibrium current carrying steady state.We report two main results in\nthis context. First, we show that for an appropriate choice of dynamicsof the\nleads, the bulk state is also driven to thermal equilibrium even though the\nopen system dynamicsdoes not act directly on it. Second, we show that the\nsteady state which emerges at late time, even in thepresence of currents, is\nlightly entangled in the sense of having small mutual information and\nconditionalmutual information for appropriate regions. We also report some\nresults for the rate of approach to thesteady state. These results have bearing\non recent attempts to formulate a numerically tractable methodto compute\ncurrents in strongly interacting models; specifically, they are relevant for\nthe problem ofdesigning simple leads that can drive a target system into\nthermal equilibrium at low temperature.\n", "  The mixed spin-(1,1/2) Ising-Heisenberg model on a distorted diamond chain\nwith the spin-1 nodal atoms and the spin-1/2 interstitial atoms is exactly\nsolved by the transfer-matrix method. An influence of the geometric spin\nfrustration and the parallelogram distortion on the ground state,\nmagnetization, susceptibility and specific heat of the mixed-spin\nIsing-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain are investigated in detail. It is\ndemonstrated that the zero-temperature magnetization curve may involve\nintermediate plateaus just at zero and one-half of the saturation\nmagnetization. The temperature dependence of the specific heat may have up to\nthree distinct peaks at zero magnetic field and up to four distinct peaks at a\nnon-zero magnetic field. The origin of multipeak thermal behavior of the\nspecific heat is comprehensively studied.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss the future of the global long-baseline\nneutrino oscillation program. The case is made that our current lack of\nunderstanding of neutrino-nucleus interactions is a serious challenge which\nwill need to be met with new experimental initiatives in neutrino scattering.\n", "  Strong quasar-galaxy lensing provides a powerful tool to probe the\ninter-stellar medium (ISM) of the lens galaxy using radiation from the\nbackground quasar. Using the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) on board the\nHubble Space Telescope, we study the cold ISM properties of the lens galaxy in\nB1152+199 at a redshift of z=0.4377. Since existing optical extinction and\nX-ray absorption measurements of the lens have revealed a large amount of cold\nISM, we expected to detect a damped Lya absorption (DLA) system in the near\nultraviolet spectrum; however, our upper limit on the HI column density is\nseveral orders of magnitude below the expectation. We also marginally detect OI\nand CII absorption lines associated with the lens galaxy in the COS spectrum.\nThus, the lens galaxy is identified as a ghostly DLA system, and further\ninvestigations of these ghostly DLA systems would be important to characterize\nthe biases of using DLAs to probe the matter density of the universe. Although\npreliminary, the most likely explanation of the non-detection of the DLA is\nbecause of the Lya emission of the lens galaxy that fills in the absorption\ntrough, with a Lya luminosity of 4e42 erg/s.\n", "  Higgs pair production is one of the primary goals of the LHC program.\nInvestigating the effects beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is then of high\ninterest. Two cases are presented to exemplify the impact of BSM physics on\nHiggs pair production and on the triple Higgs coupling: first a review on\ncharged Higgs pair production mostly in the context of Two-Higgs-Doublet of\ntype II and in particular the Minimal Supersymmetric SM, second a study of the\none-loop effects of a heavy neutrino on the triple Higgs coupling.\n", "  In this paper we study the holographic entanglement entropy in a large N\nnoncommutative gauge field theory with two $\\theta$ parameters by\nRyu-Takayanagi prescription (RT-formula). We discuss what contributions the\npresence of noncommutativity will make to the entanglement entropy in two\ndifferent circumstances: 1) a rectangular strip and 2) a cylinder. Since we\nwant to investigate the entanglement entropy only, we will not be discussing\nthe finite temperature case in which the entropy calculated by the area of\nminimal surface will largely be the thermal part rather than the entanglement\npart. We find that divergence of the holographic entanglement entropy will be\nworse in the presence of noncommutativity. In future study, we are going to\nexplore the concrete way of computing holographic entanglement entropy in\nhigher dimensional field theory and investigate more about the entanglement\nentropy in the presence of black holes/black branes.\n", "  Ferroelectric belongs to an important class of materials showing very\ninteresting nonlinear optical properties that have a variety of application in\nphotonic devices In a discrete Hamiltonian, if we consider the space and time\ndependence of polarization vectors with an interaction term between two\npolarization domains, it gives rise to a nonlinear Klein-Gordon (K-G) equation\nthat has been shown in some systems [1]. This equation as a governing equation\nenables multiple time-scale analysis (MTSA) to be performed on a real\nferroelectric material that reveals new type of information on both linear\n(known as soft modes) and the nonlinear parts of frequencies and amplitudes of\noscillations. MTSA was described in a K-G system based on staggered\npolarization where more emphasis was given to reveal the presence of intrinsic\nlocalized modes (ILM). Here, detailed results for the first three linear modes\nand their frequencies as a 2 function of a wide range of niobium antisite\ndefects or, impurities in lithium niobate ferroelectric are presented. It is\nfound that when an external excitation (i.e. the input) is only harmonic in\nnature, it could not be ascertained whether the even modes of the solitonic\nwaves (i.e. the output) will have phase-locking with this type of harmonic\nexternal force.\n", "  The equation of state of an energy density may be significantly modified by\ncoupling it to another energy density. In the light of this observation we\ncheck the possibility of producing cosmic accelerated expansion in this way. In\nparticular we consider the case where matter is converted to radiation (or vice\nversa by particle physics processes). We find that cosmic accelerated expansion\ncan be obtained in this way only if an intermediate state with negative\nequation of state forms during the conversion.\n", "  Porous silicon (PSi) layers has been prepared in this work via\nphotoelectrochemical (PEC) etching process of an n type silicon wafers of two\nresistivities (3.5 \u007fohm.cm and 0.02 \u007fohm.cm) in hydrofluoric (HF) acid of 24.5\nprecent concentration at different etching times (5 to 25 min). The irradiation\nhas been achieved using laser beam of 2W power and 810 nm wavelength. We have\nstudied the morphological and structural properties of PSi layers using the\ntechniques of Xray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and\nGravimetric method. The Xray Diffraction data shows that the structure aspect\nof PSi layers remains crystalline as well as the decreasing of diffraction\nangle (thetaB) of Xray from PSi layers (29 to 26 degree) and increasing of the\nlattice parameter values of PSi structures with increasing of etching times\nfrom 5 to 25 min., and the resistivity of silicon substrates from 0.02 to 3.5\nohm.cm. The nanocrystallite size is decreasing from (20.72 to 5.13 nm) with\nincreasing of etching times, and the resistivity of silicon substrates. The SEM\nimages shows that the values of pore width and PSi layer thickness increases\nfrom (0.5 to 6.25 micrometer) and (6.7 to 47 micrometer) respectively with\nincreasing of etching times and silicon substrates resistivities, while the\nvalues of the thickness of walls between pores has been varied from (1.25 to\n0.03 micrometer) with increasing of etching times and silicon substrates\nresistivities. The pore shape of pores has been varied from Cylindrical to\nRectangular and to Starful with varied of etching conditions. Further the\nmeasured specific surface area of PSi layers has been increased from (7.43 to\n235.35 m2/cm3) with increasing of etching times and silicon substrates\nresistivities.\n", "  Solving phenomenological macroscopic equations instead of microscopic\nGinzburg-Landau equations for superconductors is much easier and can be\nadvantageous in a variety of applications. However, till now, only Bean's\ncritical state model is available for the description of irreversible\nproperties. Here we propose a plausible overall macroscopic model for both\nreversible and irreversible properties, combining London theory and Bean's\nmodel together based on superposition principle. First, a simple case where\nthere is no pinning is discussed, from which a microscopic basis for Bean's\nmodel is explored. It is shown that a new concept of 'flux share' is needed\nwhen the field is increased above the lower critical field. A portion of\nmagnetic flux is completely shielded, named as 'Meissner share' and the rest\npenetrates through vortices, named as 'vortices share'. We argue that the flux\nshares are irreversible if there is pinning. It is shown that the irreversible\nflux shares can be the reason for observed peculiar reversible magnetization\nbehavior near zero field. The overall macroscopic model seems to be valuable\nfor the analysis of fundamental physical properties as well. As an example, it\nis shown the origin of paramagnetic Meissner effect can be explained by the\nphenomenological macroscopic model.\n", "  We present a machine learning approach to the inversion of Fredholm integrals\nof the first kind. The approach provides a natural regularization in cases\nwhere the inverse of the Fredholm kernel is ill-conditioned. It also provides\nan efficient and stable treatment of constraints. The key observation is that\nthe stability of the forward problem permits the construction of a large\ndatabase of outputs for physically meaningful inputs. We apply machine learning\nto this database to generate a regression function of controlled complexity,\nwhich returns approximate solutions for previously unseen inputs; the\napproximate solutions are then projected onto the subspace of functions\nsatisfying relevant constraints. We also derive and present uncertainty\nestimates. We illustrate the approach by applying it to the analytical\ncontinuation problem of quantum many-body physics, which involves\nreconstructing the frequency dependence of physical excitation spectra from\ndata obtained at specific points in the complex frequency plane. Under standard\nerror metrics the method performs as well or better than the Maximum Entropy\nmethod for low input noise and is substantially more robust to increased input\nnoise. We expect the methodology to be similarly effective for any problem\ninvolving a formally ill-conditioned inversion, provided that the forward\nproblem can be efficiently solved.\n", "  We use a seismic diagnostic, based on the derivative of the phase shift of\nthe reflected by the surface acoustic waves, to probe the outer layers of the\nstar HD 49933. This diagnostic is particularly sensitive to partial ionization\nprocesses occurring above the base of the convective zone. The regions of\npartial ionization of light elements, hydrogen and helium, have well known\nseismological signatures. In this work we detect a different seismic signature\nin the acoustic frequencies, that we showed to correspond to the location where\nthe partial ionization of heavy elements occurs. The location of the\ncorresponding acoustic glitch lies between the region of the second ionization\nof helium and the base of the convective zone, approximately 5% below the\nsurface of the stars.\n", "  Thermal displacement fluctuations in a crystal may be classified as either\n\"affine\" or \"non-affine\". While the former couples to external stress with\nfamiliar consequences, the response of a crystal when {\\em non-affine}\ndisplacements are enhanced using the thermodynamically conjugate field, is\nrelatively less studied. We examine this using a simple model of a crystal in\ntwo dimensions for which analytical calculations are possible. Enhancing\nnon-affine fluctuations destabilises the crystal. The population of small\nfrequency phonon modes increases, with the phonon density of states shifting,\nas a whole, towards zero frequency. Even though the crystal is free of\ndisorder, we observe growing length and time scales. Our results, which may\nhave implications for the glass transition and structural phase transitions in\nsolids, are compared to molecular dynamics simulations. Possibility of\nexperimental verification of these results is also discussed.\n", "  The paper describes a time- and angle-resolved photoemission apparatus\nconsisting of a hemispherical analyzer and a pulsed laser source. We\ndemonstrate 1.48-eV pump and 5.90-eV probe measurements at the >10.5-meV and\n>240-fs resolutions by use of fairly monochromatic 170-fs pulses delivered from\na regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser system operating typically at 250\nkHz. The apparatus is capable to resolve the optically filled superconducting\npeak in the unoccupied states of a cuprate superconductor, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d. A\ndataset recorded on Bi(111) surface is also presented. Technical descriptions\ninclude the followings: A simple procedure to fine-tune the spatio-temporal\noverlap of the pump-and-probe beams and their diameters; achieving a long-term\nstability of the system that enables a normalization-free dataset acquisition;\nchanging the repetition rate by utilizing acoustic optical modulator and\nfrequency-division circuit.\n", "  In 1988, Aharonov, Albert, and Vaidman introduced a new paradigm of quantum\nmeasurement in a paper which had the unwieldy but provocative title \"How the\nresult of a measurement of a component of the spin of a spin-1=2 particle can\nturn out to be 100.\" This paradigm, so-called \"weak measurement,\" has since\nbeen the subject of widespread theoretical and experimental attention, both for\nthe perspective it offers on quantum reality and for possible applications to\nprecision measurement. Yet almost all of the weak-measurement experiments\ncarried out so far could be alternatively understood in terms of the classical\n(electro-magnetic wave) theory of optics. Here we present a truly quantum\nversion, the first in which a measurement apparatus deterministically entangles\ntwo distinct optical beams, enabling us to experimentally ask a question\ndirectly analogous to that of the original proposal: \"In a two-arm\ninterferometer containing one photon in total, can the result of a measurement\nof the photon number in one arm turn out to be greater than 1?\" Specifically,\nwe show that a single photon, when properly post-selected, can have an effect\nequal to that of eight photons: that is, in a system where a single photon has\nbeen calibrated to write a nonlinear phase shift of \\phi_0 on a probe beam, we\nmeasure phase shifts as large as 8\\phi_0 for appropriately post-selected single\nphotons. This is the first deterministic weak-value experiment in optics which\ndefies classical explanation, and constitutes a realization of our proposal for\nweak-value amplification (WVA) of the small optical nonlinearity at the\nsingle-photon level. It opens up a new regime for the study of entanglement of\noptical beams, as well as further investigations of the power of WVA for the\nmeasurement of small quantities.\n", "  We present a long-slit spectroscopic analysis of Herbig-Haro 202 and the\nsurrounding gas of the Orion Nebula using data from the Very Large Telescope.\nGiven the characteristics of the Orion Nebula, it is the ideal object to study\nthe mechanisms that play a role in the evolution of H II regions, notably dust\ndestruction by interstellar shocks, which is a poorly understood subject. The\nuse of long-slit allowed us to determine the spatial variation in its physical\nconditions and chemical abundances observing a broad area of the Orion Nebula;\nour results are consistent with those from previous studies albeit with\nimproved uncertainties in some determinations. Special attention is paid to\nIron (Fe) and Oxygen (O) abundances, which show a peak at the apex of the\nshock, allowing us to estimate that 57% of the dust is the destroyed at this\nposition; we also calculate the amount of depletion of oxygen in dust grains,\nwhich amounts to 0.126 +/- 0.024 dex. Finally we show that O abundances\ndetermined from collisionally excited lines and recombination lines are\nirreconcilable at the center of the shock unless thermal inhomogeneities are\nconsidered along the line of sight in the form of the t^2 parameter proposed by\nPeimbert (1967).\n", "  Feynman once asked physicists to build better electron microscopes to be able\nto watch biology at work. While electron microscopes can now provide atomic\nresolution, electron beam induced specimen damage precludes high resolution\nimaging of sensitive materials, such as single proteins or polymers. Here, we\nuse simulations to show that an electron microscope based on a simplemulti-pass\nmeasurement protocol enables imaging of single proteins at reduced damage and\nat nanometer resolution, without averaging structures overmultiple images.\nWhilewe demonstrate the method for particular imaging targets, the approach is\nbroadly applicable and is expected to improve resolution and sensitivity for a\nrange of electron microscopy imaging modalities, including, for example,\nscanning and spectroscopic techniques. The approach implements a quantum\nmechanically optimal strategy which under idealized conditions can be\nconsidered interaction-free. In practice, an order-of-magnitude reduction in\ndamage at equivalent resolution appears feasible.\n", "  Observations of TeV--PeV-energy cosmic neutrinos by the IceCube observatory\nhave suggested that extragalactic cosmic-ray sources should have an optical\ndepth greater than $\\sim$0.01 and contribute to more than 10\\% of the observed\nbulk of cosmic rays at 10 PeV. If the spectrum of cosmic rays from these\nextragalactic sources extends well beyond 1 EeV, the neutrino flux indicates\nthat extragalactic cosmic-ray protons are dominant in the observed total\ncosmic-ray flux at 1 EeV. Among known powerful astronomical objects, including\ngamma-ray bursters (GRBs), only flat-spectrum radio quasars could (barely)\nsatisfy these conditions. On the other hand, the null detection of neutrinos\nwith energies well beyond PeV has excluded the possibility that radio-loud\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) and/or GRBs, the popular source candidates\ndiscussed in the literature, are the origins of the highest-energy cosmic rays\n($\\sim100 {\\rm EeV}$) if they are composed mainly of protons. Their origins\nmust be objects that have evolved on time scales comparable to or slower than\nthe star formation rate. These considerations indicate that none of the known\nextragalactic astronomical objects can be simultaneously a source of both PeV-\nand trans-EeV-energy cosmic rays. As a result of the stringent limits on\nEeV-energy neutrino fluxes, a significant part of the parameter space for the\nAGN and new-born pulsar models is starting to seem unfavorable, even for\nscenarios of mixed and heavy cosmic-ray compositions at the highest energies.\n", "  We study a pulsating variable post-AGB star V534 Lyr = HD172324 based on five\nhigh resolution spectra (R = 60 000) obtained with the NES echelle spectrograph\nof the 6--meter Russian telescope (BTA) in 2010 and 2013. Using the atmosphere\nmodeling method and the Kurucz model set, we obtained the effective temperature\nT$_{\\rm eff}$ = 10500 K, surface gravity log g = 2.5, and microturbulent\nvelocity ${\\rm \\xi_t}$=4.0 km/s. The underabundance of the iron group elements\n${\\rm [Met/H]_{\\odot} = -0.50}$ was detected. This fact in combination with\nhigh spatial velocity indicates that V534 Lyr does not belong to the disk\npopulation. The radial velocity gradient in the V534 Lyr atmosphere is minimum:\ndifferential shifts of lines are close to measurement errors The spectral class\nA0 Iab corresponds to the distance to V534 Lyr, d$\\approx$6 kpc.\n", "  Asteroid families are groups of minor planets that have a common origin in\nbreakup events. The very young compact asteroid clusters are the natural\nlaboratory to study resonance related chaotic and nonlinear dynamics. The\npresent dynamical configurations and evolution of asteroid associations\nstrongly depends on their ages. In present paper we allocate subclass of very\nyoung asteroid families (younger than 1 Myr). We show that resonance-related\nchaos can play a very important role in dynamics of very young asteroid\nfamilies. In case of Datura family chaos may be explained by high order mean\nmotion resonance 9:16 with Mars. In case Hobson family chaos is affected by\nsecular resonance. In other considered cases (Kapbos cluster and Lucascavin\ncluster) origin of chaotic behavior is still unknown. The effect of resonance\nis very selective in all cases: we see very stable orbits in the vicinity of\nchaotic ones. In the high order resonance transfer from initial to final orbit\ntake place by temporary capture in exact resonance. The large asteroids (Ceres,\nVesta) can made significant effect on dynamic of small bodies in resonance. In\nsome cases (as for Datura and Lucascavin family), their perturbations can\nextend area of chaotic motion.\n", "  Perturbative calculations of gradient flow observables are technically\nchallenging. Current results are limited to a few quantities and, in general,\nto low perturbative orders. Numerical stochastic perturbation theory is a\npotentially powerful tool that may be applied in this context. Precise results\nusing these techniques, however, require control over both statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties. In this contribution, we discuss some recent\nalgorithmic developments that lead to a substantial reduction of the cost of\nthe computations. The matching of the ${\\overline{\\rm MS}}$ coupling with the\ngradient flow coupling in a finite box with Schr\\\"odinger functional boundary\nconditions is considered for illustration.\n", "  A coupled spin-electron chain composed of localized Ising spins and mobile\nelectrons is exactly solved in an external magnetic field within the\ntransfer-matrix method. The ground-state phase diagram involves in total seven\ndifferent ground states, which differ in the number of mobile electrons per\nunit cell and the respective spin arrangements. A rigorous analysis of the\nlow-temperature magnetization process reveals doping-dependent magnetization\nplateaus, which may be tuned through the density of mobile electrons. It is\ndemonstrated that the fractional value of the electron density is responsible\nfor an enhanced magnetocaloric effect due to an annealed bond disorder of the\nmobile electrons.\n", "  Thanks to high precision long baseline neutrino experiments such as NO$\\nu$A\nand DUNE, possible effects of Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI) on\nneutrino oscillation data have received renewed interest in the last two years.\nIt is however challenging to build models that can give rise to NSI with\nsizeable couplings discernible at neutrino oscillation experiments without\nviolating the various existing experimental bounds. We introduce two viable\nmodels that can lead to neutral current NSI with sizable couplings. Both models\nare based on a new $U(1)^\\prime$ gauge symmetry with $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson of\nmass $O(10~{\\rm MeV})$. We will highlight the common phenomenological features\nof these models and suggest ways to test them.\n", "  We investigate implications of the use of the point-split axial vector\ncurrent derived from a Wilson like fermionic action. We compute the\ncorresponding renormalization factor nonperturbatively for one beta value. The\naxial charge gA calculated from this nonlocal current is found to be nearer to\nthe physical value than computed with the local axial vector current --\ncomputed both on the same lattice with the same action.\n", "  This document highlights a number of top-quark mass measurements carried out\nby the ATLAS and CMS collaborations based on the combined LHC Run 1 datasets at\ncentre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}=$7 and 8 TeV. A wide range of analysis\nstrategies are employed for a number of final-state signatures. Measurements of\nboth the pole mass as well as the value of the top-quark mass as defined by the\nMonte Carlo generator in simulated signal samples are discussed.\n", "  We address the problem of semi-supervised learning in relational networks,\nnetworks in which nodes are entities and links are the relationships or\ninteractions between them. Typically this problem is confounded with the\nproblem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems\nrepresent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.\nHowever, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,\noften from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to\nconnect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can\nbe more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For\ninstance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same\nclass label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class\nlabels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not\nnecessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network\n(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe\nlinks between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the\nsame genders in others. Performing classification in networks with different\ntypes of heterogeneity is a hard problem that is made harder still when we do\nnot know a-priori the type or level of heterogeneity. Here we present two\nscalable approaches for graph-based semi-supervised learning for the more\ngeneral case of relational networks. We demonstrate these approaches on\nsynthetic and real-world networks that display different link patterns within\nand between classes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ours give better\nclassification performance without prior knowledge of how classes interact. In\nparticular, our two-step label propagation algorithm gives consistently good\naccuracy and runs on networks of over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges in\naround 12 seconds.\n", "  We present a measurement of angular observables and a test of lepton flavor\nuniversality in the $B\\to K^\\ast \\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay, where $\\ell$ is either\n$e$ or $\\mu$. The analysis is performed on a data sample corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of $711~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ containing $772\\times 10^{6}$\n$B\\bar B$ pairs, collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle\ndetector at the asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider KEKB. The result is\nconsistent with Standard Model (SM) expectations, where the largest discrepancy\nfrom a SM prediction is observed in the muon modes with a local significance of\n$2.6\\sigma$.\n", "  We report lattice simulations of $\\phi^4_2$ and $O(N)\\,\\phi^4$ models,\nperformed by means of a Monte Carlo method based on the all-order strong\ncoupling expansion (worm algorithm). The investigation of the non-perturbative\nfeatures of the $\\phi^4$ continuum limit in two dimensions lead us to the\nresult $g/\\mu^2 = 11.15 \\pm 0.06_{stat} \\pm 0.03_{syst}$ for the critical\ncoupling. Furthermore we present preliminary results for the three-dimensional\n$O(2)\\phi^4\\,$ model using the worm algorithm with the extention to\n$O(N)\\phi^4\\,$ in $D$ dimensions.\n", "  We study the particles emitted in the fireball following a Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collision with the traditional angular analysis employed in cosmology and\nearth sciences, producing Mollweide plots of the p_t distribution of a few\nactual, publically released ALICE-collaboration events and calculating their\nangular power spectrum. With the limited statistics at hand, we do not find\nevidence for acoustic peaks but a decrease of C_l that is reminiscent of\nviscous attenuation, but subject to a strong effect from the rapidity\nacceptance which probably dominates (so we also subtract the m=0 component). As\nan exercise, we still extract a characteristic Silk damping length\n(proportional to the square root of the viscosity over entropy density ratio).\nThe absence of acoustic-like peaks is also compatible with a crossover from the\nQGP to the hadron gas (because a surface tension at domain boundaries would\neffect a restoring force that could have driven acoustic oscillations).\nPresently an unexpected depression appears in the l=6 multipole strength, which\nshould be revisited by the ALICE collaboration with full statistics to confirm\nor discard it.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study of the Galactic Luminous Blue Variable HR\nCarinae, based on new high resolution mid-infrared (IR) and radio images\nobtained with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA), which have been complemented by far-infrared\nHerschel-PACS observations and ATCA archive data. The Herschel images reveal\nthe large-scale distribution of the dusty emitting nebula, which extends mainly\nto the North-East direction, up to 70 arcsec from the central star, and is\noriented along the direction of the space motion of the star. In the\nmid-infrared images, the brightness distribution is characterized by two\narc-shaped structures, tracing an inner envelope surrounding the central star\nmore closely. At radio wavelengths, the ionized gas emission lies on the\nopposite side of the cold dust with respect to the position of the star, as if\nthe ionized front was confined by the surrounding medium in the North-South\ndirection. The comparison with previous data indicates significant changes in\nthe radio nebula morphology and in the mass-loss rate from the central star,\nwhich has increased from 6.1$\\times10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in 1994-1995\nto $1.17\\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ in 2014. We investigate possible\nscenarios that could have generated the complex circumstellar environment\nrevealed by our multi-wavelength data.\n", "  There is a mismatch between modelled and observed distributions of optical\nstars masses in BH LMXB. Companion masses in BH LMXB are found in the mass\nrange 0.1 - 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$ with the peak at 0.6 $M_{\\odot}$. The standard\nevolutionary scenarios require the donor mass distribution peaks to be at least\n$\\sim 1\\, M_{\\odot}$ to eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor.\nImperfect of the methods of optical stars masses determination may cause this\ndifference.\n  Two common used approximations of real Roche lobe filling star as distortion\nsources have been tested. On the one hand, there is the a approximation of real\nRoche lobe filling optical stars as sphere. We tested rotational broadening of\nabsorption lines based on an exact calculation of CaI $\\lambda 6439.075 \\, \\AA$\nabsorption profiles in the spectra of Roche lobe filling optical stars. There\nis overestimation of projected equatorial rotational velocity $V_{rot} \\sin i$\nand, accordingly, underestimation of mass ratio $q=M_x/M_v$ in the spherical\nstar model. On the other hand, the approximation of a real Roche lobe filling\nstar as disk with uniform local profile and linear limb darkening law is more\nrough. In this case overestimation of projected equatorial rotational velocity\n$V_{rot} \\sin i$ is $ \\sim 20\\%$. Such overestimation of $V_{rot} \\sin i$ can\nresult in significant underestimation of mass ratio $q=M_x/M_v$ at hight value\nof $q=M_x/M_v$. Refined value of $q$ does not affect the mass of a black hole,\nbut the mass of an optical star has shrunk 1.5 times. Hence, the masses of\noptical stars in BH LMXB must be corrected downward, despite the contradictions\nto the standard evolutionary scenarios.\n", "  Electron transfer (ET) in molecular donor-acceptor dye systems is crucial for\ncharge transport in organic semiconductors. Classically, ET rates should\ndecrease with increasing donor-acceptor distance while the microscopic\nmechanism is more complex and shows intricate dependencies on the excitation\nconditions. In this paper, we introduce highly soluble N,N'-dialkyl perylene\ndihydrazides (PDH) - perylene dyes with a dialkylamino -NR$_2$ donor\nfunctionality directly bonded to both of their imide nitrogen atoms. We compare\nthe PDH electron-transfer dynamics with a group of classical\nN,N'-bisalkylperylene diimides (PDI) equipped with a -NR$_2$ donor linked to\nthe PDI acceptor core via a varying number of alkylene -(CH$_2$)- spacer\ngroups, thus at distinctively different distance. Special physicochemical\ndesign features of our study objects include: i) amine moieties as donor group\nto minimize spin-orbit coupling; ii) substitution solely at both imide\npositions to avoid major impact on HOMO and LUMO levels and distortions of the\nPDI backbone; iii) control of donor-acceptor separation by non-conjugated\nalkylene groups to exclude any additional effects due to delocalized $\\pi$\nelectron systems. All materials show non-single-exponential photoluminescence\ndecay dynamics. A rate equation analysis supported by electrochemical and\nabsolute photoluminescence efficiency measurements yields evidence for\nefficient intersystem-crossing without heavy elements and reveals that the\ncharge-transfer efficiency across the intramolecular interface strongly depends\non the surplus excitation energy.\n", "  We study biorthogonal functions related to basic hypergeometric integrals\nwith coupled continuous and discrete components. Such integrals appear as\nsuperconformal indices for three-dimensional quantum field theories and also in\nthe context of solvable lattice models. We obtain explicit biorthogonal systems\ngiven by products of two of Rahman's biorthogonal rational\n${}_{10}W_9$-functions or their degenerate cases. We also give new bilateral\nextensions of the Jackson and $q$-Saalsch\\\"utz summation formulas and new\ncontinuous and discrete biorthogonality measures for Rahman's functions.\n", "  We investigated how a target's porosity affects the outcome of a collision,\nwith respect to the impactor's fate. Laboratory impact experiments using\nperidot projectiles were performed at a speed range between 0.3 and 3.0 km/s,\nonto high porosity water-ice (40%) and fine-grained calcium carbonate (70%)\ntargets. We report that the amount of implanted material in the target body\nincreases with increasing target's porosity, while the size frequency\ndistribution of the projectile's ejecta fragments becomes steeper. A\nsupplementary Raman study showed no sign of change of the Raman spectra of the\nrecovered olivine projectile fragments indicate minimal physical change.\n", "  Stellar spectroscopy provides useful information on the physical properties\nof stars such as effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity (log\ng). However, those photospheric characteristics are often hampered by\nsystematic uncertainties. The joint spectro-seismo project (APOKASC) of field\nred giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the log g determined\nspectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely\ndependent on the stellar evolutionary status. Therefore, in this letter, we aim\nto shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset using the APOKASC\nsample. We analyse the log g discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and\nevolutionary status and discuss the impact of He and carbon isotopic ratio.\n  We first show that for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch, the\ndiscrepancy between spectroscopic and asteroseismic log g depends on stellar\nmass. This indicates that the discrepancy is related to CN cycling. We\ndemonstrate that the C isotopic ratio ($\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$) has the largest\nimpact on the stellar spectrum. We find that this log g discrepancy shows a\nsimilar trend in mass as the $\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios expected by stellar\nevolution theory. Although we do not detect a direct signature of $\\rm ^{13}C$,\nthe data suggests that the discrepancy is tightly correlated to the production\nof $\\rm ^{13}C$. Moreover, by running a data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a\nsynthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we quantitatively evaluate the\nimpact of various $\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. While we have demonstrated that\n$\\rm ^{13}C$ impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the\nobserved offset in log g. If further tests confirm that $\\rm ^{13}C$ is not the\nmain element responsible of the log g problem, the number of spectroscopic\neffects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited. [Abridged]\n", "  The effect of electromagnetic retardation on the spectrum of edge plasmons in\na semi-infinite two-dimensional electron system is considered. The problem is\nreduced to complicated integral equations for the potentials, which are solved\nupon a major simplification of the kernel. The spatial distribution of the\npotentials, charges, and currents is analyzed. It is shown that edge plasmon\npolaritons in the high-conductivity two dimensional system are characterized by\na high Q factor at all frequencies, including those lower than the inverse\nelectron relaxation time.\n", "  The scheme with quadrupole lenses is presented for realization relativistic\nstrophotron type Free electron laser. Equations of motion are solved and\ntrajectories are found. It is shown, that movement of electrons in presented\nscheme is stable in both transverse directions.\n", "  Tidal interactions in close star-planet or binary star systems may excite\ninertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis force) in the convective\nregion of the stars. The dissipation of these waves plays a prominent role in\nthe long-term orbital and rotational evolution of the bodies involved. If the\nprimary star rotates as a solid body, inertial waves have a Doppler-shifted\nfrequency restricted to the range $[-2\\Omega, 2\\Omega]$ ($\\Omega$ being the\nangular velocity of the star), and they can propagate in the entire convective\nregion. However, turbulent convection can sustain differential rotation with an\nequatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration that modifies the\nfrequency range and propagation domain of inertial waves and allows corotation\nresonances for non-axisymmetric oscillations. In this work, we perform\nnumerical simulations of tidally excited inertial waves in a differentially\nrotating convective envelope with a conical (or latitudinal) rotation profile.\nThe tidal forcing that we adopt contains spherical harmonics that correspond to\nthe case of a circular and coplanar orbit. We study the viscous dissipation of\nthe waves as a function of tidal frequency for various stellar masses and\ndifferential rotation parameters, as well as its dependence on the turbulent\nviscosity coefficient. We compare our results with previous studies assuming\nsolid-body rotation and point out the potential key role of corotation\nresonances in the dynamical evolution of close-in star-planet or binary\nsystems.\n", "  While conventional semiconductor technology relies on the manipulation of\nelectrical charge for the implementation of computational logic, additional\ndegrees of freedom such as spin and valley offer alternative avenues for the\nencoding of information. In transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers,\nwhere spin-valley locking is present, strong retention of valley chirality has\nbeen reported for MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ while MoSe$_2$ shows anomalously\nlow valley polarisation retention. In this work, chiral selectivity of MoSe$_2$\ncavity polaritons under helical excitation is reported with a polarisation\ndegree that can be controlled by the exciton-cavity detuning. In contrast to\nthe very low circular polarisation degrees seen in MoSe$_2$ exciton and trion\nresonances, we observe a significant enhancement of up to 7 times when in the\npolaritonic regime. Here, polaritons introduce a fast decay mechanism which\ninhibits full valley pseudospin relaxation and thus allows for increased\nretention of injected polarisation in the emitted light. A dynamical model\napplicable to cavity-polaritons in any TMD semiconductor, reproduces the\ndetuning dependence through the incorporation of the cavity-modified exciton\nrelaxation, allowing an estimate of the spin relaxation time in MoSe$_2$ which\nis an order of magnitude faster than those reported in other TMDs. The valley\naddressable exciton-polaritons reported here offer robust valley polarised\nstates demonstrating the prospect of valleytronic devices based upon TMDs\nembedded in photonic structures, with significant potential for\nvalley-dependent nonlinear polariton-polariton interactions.\n", "  We study the evolutions of 4D universe on the M2-M5 BIon in the thermal\nbackground. The BIon consists of a D-brane and a parallel anti-D-brane which a\nwormhole connects them. When the branes and antibranes are far from each other\nand the brane's spike and the antibrane's spike are well separated, the\nwormhole cannot be built. However, when the branes and anti-branes are close to\neach other, a wormhole can be formed between them. Under this condition, there\nare many ways for flowing energy from transverse dimensions into our universe.\nThis energy overcomes all other forms of energy, such as the gravitational\nrepulsion and causes that our epoch is terminated at a Big-Rip singularity. We\nshow that at this point, universe would be disappeared and one black M2-brane\nis formed. Finally, we examine our model against WMAP, Planck and BICEP2\nexperiments and get the ripping time. Comparing the model with experimental\ndata, we obtain $N\\simeq 50$ and $n_{s}\\simeq 0.96$, where \\emph{N} and $n_{s}$\nare the number e-folds and the spectral index respectively. These results could\nbe located in $0.01 < R_{Tensor-scalar} < 0.3$, where $R_{Tensor-scalar}$ is\nthe tensor-scalar ratio. In this epoch, the Big Rip singularity happens in a\nfinite time $t_{rip}=31(Gyr)$ for WMAP and Planck experimnts and\n$t_{rip}=28(Gyr)$ for BICEP2 experiment. By comparing this time with the time\nof the Big Rip in brane-antibrane, we observe that the wormhole in BIonic\nsystem causes that the destruction of the universe becomes faster.\n", "  The purpose of this note, as a compendium, is to extend the results on\nentropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation\n(without external force) in \\cite{Levermore} by Levermore to the case of the\nBoltzmann equation with external force. More specifically, starting from the\nBoltzmann equation with an external force introduced in \\cite{DL16} by\nArs\\'{e}nio and Saint-Raymond, we find conditions on the force, to maintain the\nresult in \\cite{Levermore} (as an important application of the theory of\nDiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions) about the validity of the linearization\napproximation when the initial datum approaches a global Maxwellian.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is twofold: First lending more support to torsion\nalternative gravity theories to General Relativity and cosmology and torsion\ndetection by showing how they can simply used in the investigation of helicity\nand magnetic energy spectra of primordial fields by using a strong value of\ntorsion of $10MeV$ previously computed by the author. dynamo mechanism seeds in\nthe Primordial Universe has been a matter of intense investigation lately. The\nsecond purpose is to apply these torsion theories in the special random spins\ngauge where its time component torsion gauge $T^{0}=0$, which implies that\nspins of the nucleons are polarised orthogonal to QCD domain walls. A\nmodification of circular polarization at $1Mpc$ scale, give rise to left\ntorsion helicity which using a QCD seed $B_{QCD}\\sim{10^{16}G}$ yields MF of\n$B_{-}\\sim{10^{30}Gauss}$ which was the value obtained by Enqvist et al using\nneutrinos and galactic dynamos at QED scales. The $B_{+}$ mode can be shown to\nconstrain torsion to $T\\sim{10^{7}Mev}$ at $1pc$ which can be detected at LHC\nscales. These constraints at 1Mpc reach only $10^{-10}MeV$\n", "  Semi-leptonic $B$ decays provide promising channels to test the Standard\nModel, search for signs of new physics, or determine fundamental parameters\nlike CKM matrix elements. We present an update on our calculation of short\ndistance contributions to GIM suppressed rare $B$ decays focusing in particular\non $B_s\\to \\phi \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays. Furthermore we show first results for\nour calculation of $B_{(s)}\\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}\\ell\\nu$ semi-leptonic decays\ninvolving $b\\to c$ transitions. Our calculations are based on RBC-UKQCD's 2+1\nflavor domain-wall fermion and Iwasaki gauge field configurations featuring\nthree lattice spacings in the range $1.73$ GeV $\\le a^{-1} \\le 2.77$ GeV and\npion masses down to the physical value. We calculate the form factors by\nsimulating $b$-quarks using the relativistic heavy quark action, create light\n$u/d$ and $s$ quarks with standard domain-wall kernel, and use optimised\nM\\\"obius domain-wall fermions for charm quarks.\n", "  \\textsc{Jewel} is a fully dynamical event generator for jet evolution in a\ndense QCD medium, which has been validated for multiple jet and jet-like\nobservables. Jet constituents (partons) undergo collisions with thermal partons\nfrom the medium, leading to both elastic and radiative energy loss. The\nrecoiling medium scattering centers carry away energy and momentum from the\njet. Keeping track of these recoils is essential for the description of\nintra-jet observables. Since the thermal component of the recoils is part of\nthe soft background activity, comparison with data on jet observables requires\nthe implementation of a background subtraction procedure. We will show two\nindependent procedures through which background subtraction can be performed\nand discuss the impact of the medium recoil on jet shape observables and\njet-background correlations. Keeping track of the medium recoil significantly\nimproves the \\textsc{Jewel} description of jet shape measurements.\n", "  Using numerical simulations we study the accretion of a phantom scalar field\ninto a black hole and track the black hole horizon shrinking process. We\nintegrate the amount of field left outside the black hole during the process in\nterms of the properties of the wave packet sent toward the black hole. Our\nresults indicate that the accretion of thick wave packets with small wave\nnumber is inefficient and a portion of the scalar field remains outside the\nblack hole.\n", "  In this talk, we report unitarity constraints and phenomenological studies at\nthe Large Hadron Collider for the extra Higgs bosons of a Composite 2-Higgs\nDoublet Model.\n", "  Automated computational materials science frameworks rapidly generate large\nquantities of materials data useful for accelerated materials design. We have\nextended the data oriented AFLOW-repository API (Application-Program-Interface,\nas described in Comput. Mater. Sci. 93, 178 (2014)) to enable programmatic\naccess to search queries. A URI-based search API (Uniform Resource Identifier)\nis proposed for the construction of complex queries with the intent of allowing\nthe remote creation and retrieval of customized data sets. It is expected that\nthe new language AFLUX, acronym for Automatic Flow of LUX (light), will\nfacilitate the creation of remote search operations on the AFLOW.org set of\ncomputational materials science data repositories.\n", "  An extension of the rope hadronization model, which has previously provided\ngood descriptions of hadrochemistry in high multiplicity pp collisions, is\npresented. The extension includes a dynamically generated transverse pressure,\nproduced by the excess energy from overlapping strings. We find that this model\ncan qualitatively reproduce soft features of Quark Gluon Plasma in small\nsystems, such as higher $\\langle p_\\perp \\rangle$ for heavier particles and\nlong range azimuthal correlations forming a ridge. The effects are similar to\nthose obtained from a hydrodynamic expansion, but without assuming a\nthermalized medium.\n", "  The connection between domain relaxations at individual scales and the\ncollective heterogeneous response in non-equilibrium systems is a topic of\nprofound interest in recent times. In a model sys- tem of constantly driven\noppositely charged binary colloidal suspension, we probe such relaxations as\nthe elongated lanes of likely charges interact with increasing field in the\northogonal plane using Brownian Dynamics simulations. We show that the system\nundergoes a structural and dynamical cross-over: from an initial fast-relaxing\nhomogeneous phase to a heterogeneous lane phase following a slow relaxation via\nan intermediate phase with mixed relaxation. Our observations also affirm the\ncoexistence of multiple time and length scales in this phase. Unlike glasses,\nthese time and length scales are not separated by orders of magnitude, they are\ncomparable in magnitudes. Using a phenomenological model, we, further,\nreinforce that these competing relaxations are a manifesta- tion of\nheterogeneity in diffusion which is rather generic in systems with such\ncompeting relaxations.\n", "  We present the design of a new $\\mu$TCA-based waveform digitizer, which will\nbe deployed in the Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab and will allow our pileup\nidentification requirement to be met. This digitizer features five independent\nchannels, each with 12-bit, 800-MSPS digitization and a 1-Gbit memory buffer.\nThe data storage and readout along with configuration are handled by six Xilinx\nKintex-7 FPGAs. In addition, the digitizer is equipped with a mezzanine card\nfor analog signal conditioning prior to digitization, further widening its\nrange of possible applications. The performance results of this design are also\npresented, highlighting its $0.51 \\pm 0.13$ mV intrinsic noise level and $< 22$\nps intrinsic timing resolution between channels. We believe that its\nperformance, together with its flexible design, could be of interest to future\nexperiments in search of a cost-effective waveform digitizer.\n", "  Rayleigh-Brillouin spectral profiles are measured with a laser-based\nscatterometry setup for a 90 degrees scattering angle at a high signal-to-noise\nratio (r.m.s. noise below 0.15 \\% w.r.t. peak intensity) in\nsulphur-hexafluoride gas for pressures in the range 0.2 -- 5 bar and for a\nwavelength of $\\lambda=403.0$ nm. The high quality data are compared to a\nnumber of light scattering models in order to address the effects of rotational\nand vibrational relaxation. While the vibrational relaxation rate is so slow\nthat vibration degrees of freedom remain frozen, rotations relax on time scales\ncomparable to those of the density fluctuations. Therefore, the heat capacity,\nthe thermal conductivity and the bulk viscosity are all frequency-dependent\ntransport coefficients. This is relevant for the Tenti model that depends on\nthe values chosen for these transport coefficients. This is not the case for\nthe other two models considered: a kinetic model based on rough-sphere\ninteractions, and a model based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. The deviations\nwith the experiment are similar between the three different models, except for\nthe hydrodynamic model at pressures $p \\lesssim 2\\;{\\rm bar}$. As all models\nare in line with the ideal gas law, we hypothesize the presence of real gas\neffects in the measured spectra.\n", "  Nearly two-orders of magnitude increase in room-temperature band-to-band\n(1.067 eV) infrared emission from crystalline silicon, coated with erbium-doped\nsol-gel films, have been achieved. Phonon-assisted band-to-band emission from\ncoated and annealed p-Si is strongest for the sample annealed at\n700$^{\\circ}$C. In this paper, evidence of the origin of the emission band from\nthe band edge recombination activities is established. Enhancement of radiative\nrecombination of free carriers is reasoned by stresses at the interface due to\nthe annealed sol-gel deposited silica. Comparative studies with other strained\nsilicon samples are presented.\n", "  Young stars are associated with prominent outflows of molecular gas. The\nejection of gas via these outflows is believed to remove angular momentum from\nthe protostellar system, thus permitting young stars to grow by accretion of\nmaterial from the protostellar disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow\nejection is not yet understood, but is believed to be closely linked to the\nprotostellar disk. Assorted scenarios have been proposed to explain\nprotostellar outflows; the main difference between these models is the region\nwhere acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself\n('X-wind', or stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar\ndisk (disk wind), or at the interface between. Because of the limits of\nobservational studies, outflow launching regions have so far only been probed\nby indirect extrapolation. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide\ntoward the outflow associated with the TMC1A protostellar system. These data\nshow that gas is ejected from a region extending up to a radial distance of 25\nastronomical units from the central protostar, and that angular momentum is\nremoved from an extended region of the disk. This demonstrates that the\noutflowing gas is launched by an extended disk wind from a Keplerian disk.\nHence, we rule out X-wind and stellar wind launching scenarios as the source of\nthe emission on the scales we observe.\n", "  Designing chaotic maps with complex dynamics is a challenging topic. This\npaper introduces the nonlinear chaotic processing (NCP) model, which contains\nsix basic nonlinear operations. Each operation is a general framework that can\nuse existing chaotic maps as seed maps to generate a huge number of new chaotic\nmaps. The proposed NCP model can be easily extended by introducing new\nnonlinear operations or by arbitrarily combining existing ones. The properties\nand chaotic behaviors of the NCP model are investigated. To show its\neffectiveness and usability, as examples, we provide four new chaotic maps\ngenerated by the NCP model and evaluate their chaotic performance using\nLyapunov exponent, Shannon entropy, correlation dimension and initial state\nsensitivity. The experimental results show that these chaotic maps have more\ncomplex chaotic behaviors than existing ones.\n", "  For 4$d^1$ and 5$d^1$ spin-orbit-coupled electron configurations, the notion\nof nonmagnetic j=3/2 quartet ground state discussed in classical textbooks is\nat odds with the observed variety of magnetic properties. Here we throw fresh\nlight on the electronic structure of 4$d^1$ and 5$d^1$ ions in molybdenum- and\nosmium-based double-perovskite systems and reveal different kinds of on-site\nmany-body physics in the two families of compounds: while the sizable magnetic\nmoments and $g$ factors measured experimentally are due to both metal\n$d$-ligand $p$ hybridization and dynamic Jahn-Teller interactions for 4$d$\nelectrons, it is essentially $d$-$p$ covalency for the 5$d^1$ configuration.\nThese results highlight the subtle interplay of spin-orbit interactions,\ncovalency and electron-lattice couplings as the major factor in deciding the\nnature of the magnetic ground states of 4$d$ and 5$d$ quantum materials. Cation\ncharge imbalance in the double-perovskite structure is further shown to allow a\nfine tuning of the gap between the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ levels, an effect of much\npotential in the context of orbital engineering in oxide electronics.\n", "  Geant4 is a complex and widely-used software toolkit for the simulation of\nthe passage of particles through matter and the interactions they undergo. It\ncontains very extensive and flexible optical physics capabilities. These allow\nfor the specification of a lot of properties for materials and surfaces as well\nas for the optical physics process itself.\n  Because of this large variety of possible adjustments, there is a number of\npeculiarities of the optical physics in Geant4, which the user has to be aware\nof in order to avoid incorrect simulation results due to user mistakes. As\nthese peculiarities are not always easy to recognise, this can be a serious\nproblem, especially for less experienced users of Geant4.\n  In order to assist users of optical physics in Geant4 in avoiding mistakes,\nthis paper gives a summary of peculiarities of the optical physics in Geant4.\n", "  Many real complex systems cannot be represented by a single network, but due\nto multiple sub-systems and types of interactions, must be represented as a\nmultiplex network. This is a set of nodes which exist in several layers, with\neach layer having its own kind of edges, represented by different colours. An\nimportant fundamental structural feature of networks is their resilience to\ndamage, the percolation transition. Generalisation of these concepts to\nmultiplex networks requires careful definition of what we mean by connected\nclusters. We consider two different definitions. One, a rigorous generalisation\nof the single-layer definition leads to a strong non-local rule, and results in\na dramatic change in the response of the system to damage. The giant component\ncollapses discontinuously in a hybrid transition characterised by avalanches of\ndiverging mean size. We also consider another definition, which imposes weaker\nconditions on percolation and allows local calculation, and also leads to\ndifferent sized giant components depending on whether we consider an activation\nor pruning process. This 'weak' process exhibits both continuous and\ndiscontinuous transitions.\n", "  Carrier multiplication by singlet exciton fission enhances photovoltaic\nconversion efficiencies in organic solids. This decay of one singlet exciton\ninto two triplet states promises to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit as up\nto two electrons may be harvested per absorbed photon. Intermolecular coupling\nis deemed mandatory for both, singlet exciton fission and a band-like\ntransport. Such a coupling is manifested, $e.g.$, by the Davydov-splitting of\nthe lowest-energy exciton transition in crystalline organic solids. For the\nmodel system perfluoropentacene, the corresponding transitions in the\nexperimental, polarisation-resolved absorption spectra are identified by\ntheoretical calculations based on the concept of H- and J- aggregation. Optical\ninjection into the first vibronic progression of the fundamental exciton\ntransitions significantly perturbs the higher-energy transitions that are\nassociated to H-type aggregates of the $S_0 \\rightarrow S_3$ transition during\nand following efficient singlet exciton fission. These findings underline the\nnecessity for efficient carrier extraction as triplet accumulation may be\ndetrimental to both, singlet exciton fission and any potentially band like\ntransport. More generally, our observations indicate that electronic\nexcitations can perturb the electronic band structure in organic crystals and\nhighlight their correlated nature by potentially distorting the lattice.\n", "  NGC 7067 is a young open cluster located in the direction between the first\nand the second Galactic quadrants and close to the Perseus spiral arm. This\nmakes it useful for studies of the nature of the Milky Way spiral arms.\nStromgren photometry taken with the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton\nTelescope allowed us to compute individual physical parameters for the observed\nstars and hence to derive cluster's physical parameters. Spectra from the\n1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence helped to check and\nimprove the results. We obtained photometry for 1233 stars, individual physical\nparameters for 515 and spectra for 9 of them. The 139 selected cluster members\nlead to a cluster distance of 4.4+/-0.4 kpc, with an age below log10(t(yr))=7.3\nand a present Mass of 1260+/-160Msun. The morphology of the data reveals that\nthe centre of the cluster is at (ra,dec)=(21:24:13.69,+48:00:39.2) J2000, with\na radius of 6.1arcsec. Stromgren and spectroscopic data allowed us to improve\nthe previous parameters available for the cluster in the literature.\n", "  The measurement of the $B\\to X_s\\gamma$ process gives important constraints\non physics related to charged Higgs bosons ($H^\\pm$). In 2-Higgs Doublet Models\n(2HDMs) with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry, a light $H^\\pm$ scenario, in which\n$H^\\pm$ can be produced via the top decay, is possible in two of four types of\nYukawa interactions (the so-called Type-I and Type-X). In these types of 2HDMs,\nthe $H^\\pm \\to \\tau^\\pm \\nu$ decay mode is dominant in wide regions of the\nparameter space. In this report, we discuss the other possibility of a light\ncharged Higgs boson scenario in 3-Higgs-Doublet Models (3HDMs) based on the\nresults obtained in Ref. [1]. We show that charged Higgs bosons can mainly\ndecay into $cb$ without contradiction with the $B\\to X_s\\gamma$ data and the\ndirect searches for charged Higgs bosons at the LHC, and this scenario cannot\nbe realized in the 2HDMs.\n", "  We report our direct study of the compressibility on ultrahigh mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron system ($\\mu_{e} \\sim 1 \\times 10^{7}$ cm$^{2}$/Vs) in\nGaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells under microwave (MW) irradiation. The field\npenetration current results show that the quantum capacitance oscillates with\nmicrowave induced resistance oscillations (MIRO), however, the trend is\nopposite with respect to the compressibility for usual equilibrium states in\nprevious theoretical explanations. The anomalous phenomena provide a platform\nfor study on the non-equilibrium system under microwave, and point to the\ncurrent domains and inhomogeneity induced by radiation. Moreover, the quantum\ncapacitance indication for multi-photon process around $j = 1/2$ is detected\nunder intensive microwave below 30 GHz.\n", "  We find a new duality for form factors of lightlike Wilson loops in planar\n$\\mathcal N=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. The duality maps a form factor\ninvolving an $n$-sided lightlike polygonal super-Wilson loop together with $m$\nexternal on-shell states, to the same type of object but with the edges of the\nWilson loop and the external states swapping roles. This relation can\nessentially be seen graphically in Lorentz harmonic chiral (LHC) superspace\nwhere it is equivalent to planar graph duality. However there are some crucial\nsubtleties with the cancellation of spurious poles due to the gauge fixing.\nThey are resolved by finding the correct formulation of the Wilson loop and by\ncareful analytic continuation from Minkowski to Euclidean space. We illustrate\nall of these subtleties explicitly in the simplest non-trivial NMHV-like case.\n", "  This work explores a structure of the Deprit perturbation series and its\nconnection to a Kato resolvent expansion. It extends the formalism previously\ndeveloped for the Hamiltonians linearly dependent on perturbation parameter to\na nonlinear case. We construct a canonical intertwining of perturbed and\nunperturbed averaging operators. This leads to an explicit expression for the\ngenerator of the Lie-Deprit transform in any perturbation order. Using this\nexpression, we discuss a regular pattern in the series, non-uniqueness of the\ngenerator and normalised Hamiltonian, and the uniqueness of the Gustavson\nintegrals. Comparison of the corresponding computational algorithm with\nclassical perturbation methods demonstrates its competitiveness for\nHamiltonians with a limited number of perturbation terms.\n", "  We develop a high-fidelity numerical solver for the compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations, with the main aim of highlighting the predictive\ncapabilities of low-diffusive numerics for flows in complex geometries. The\nspace discretization of the convective terms in the Navier-Stokes equations\nrelies on a robust energy-preserving numerical flux, and numerical diffusion\ninherited from the AUSM scheme is added limited to the vicinity of shock waves,\nor wherever spurious numerical oscillations are sensed. The solver is capable\nof conserving the total kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, and it bears\nsensibly less numerical diffusion than typical industrial solvers, with\nincurred greater predictive power, as demonstrated through a series of test\ncases including DNS, LES and URANS of turbulent flows. Simplicity of\nimplementation in existing popular solvers such as OpenFOAM is also\nhighlighted.\n", "  It is speculated that the correct theory of fundamental physics includes a\nlarge landscape of states, which can be described as a potential which is a\nfunction of N scalar fields and some number of discrete variables. The\nproperties of such a landscape are crucial in determining key cosmological\nparameters including the dark energy density, the stability of the vacuum, the\nnaturalness of inflation and the properties of the resulting perturbations, and\nthe likelihood of bubble nucleation events. We codify an approach to landscape\ncosmology based on specifications of the overall form of the landscape\npotential and illustrate this approach with a detailed analysis of the\nproperties of N-dimensional Gaussian random landscapes. We clarify the\ncorrelations between the different matrix elements of the Hessian at the\nstationary points of the potential. We show that these potentials generically\ncontain a large number of minima. More generally, these results elucidate how\nrandom function theory is of central importance to this approach to landscape\ncosmology, yielding results that differ substantially from those obtained by\ntreating the matrix elements of the Hessian as independent random variables.\n"]}
