Our\nmain conclusion, similarly in the analysis of the determinant itself, is that\nthe derivative of the characteristic Fredholm determinant may be efficiently\ncomputed from first principles for integral operators with semi-separable\nintegral kernels, which include in particular the general one-dimensional case,\nand for sums thereof, which latter possibility appears to offer applications in\nthe multi-dimensional case.\n  A second main result is to show that the multi-dimensional characteristic\nFredholm determinant is the renormalized limit of a sequence of Evans functions\ndefined in [23] on successive Galerkin subspaces, giving a natural extension of\nthe one-dimensional results of [11] and answering a question of [27] whether\nthis sequence might possibly converge (in general, no, but with\nrenormalization, yes). Convergence is useful in practice for numerical error\ncontrol and acceleration.\n", "  It is explained on a physical basis how contextuality allows Bell\ninequalities to be violated, without bringing an implication on locality or\nrealism. The point is that the initial values of the hidden variables of the\ndetectors are mutually exclusive for different detector settings. Therefore\nthey have no reason to possess a common probability distribution and hence no\nreason to satisfy Bell inequalities. To motivate this, we connect first to the\nlocal realistic theory Stochastic Electrodynamics, and then put the argument\nmore broadly. Thus even if Bell Inequality Violation is demonstrated beyond\nreasonable doubt, it will have no say on local realism.\n", "  In this work we suggest very simple solution of the two capacitors paradox in\nthe completely ideal (without any electrical resistance or inductive)\nelectrical circuit. Namely, it is shown that electrical field energy loss\ncorresponds to works done by electrical fields of both capacitors by movement\nof the electrical charge. It is all and nothing more (some dissipation\nprocesses, e.g. Joule heating and electromagnetic wave emission effects) is\nnecessary. Additionally, we shortly demonstrate a simple mechanical analogy of\nmentioned paradox and its solution. Concretely we consider two water buckets\nconnected by a valve where is a seeming loss of the gravitational potential\nenergy that can be explained by the work in the gravitational field.\n", "  We give a unified proof for the well-posedness of a class of linear\nhalf-space equations with general incoming data and construct a Galerkin method\nto numerically resolve this type of equations in a systematic way. Our main\nstrategy in both analysis and numerics includes three steps: adding damping\nterms to the original half-space equation, using an inf-sup argument and\neven-odd decomposition to establish the well-posedness of the damped equation,\nand then recovering solutions to the original half-space equation. The proposed\nnumerical methods for the damped equation is shown to be quasi-optimal and the\nnumerical error of approximations to the original equation is controlled by\nthat of the damped equation. This efficient solution to the half-space problem\nis useful for kinetic-fluid coupling simulations.\n", "  Baryon-to-meson Transition Distribution Amplitudes (TDAs) encoding valuable\nnew information on hadron structure appear as building blocks in the collinear\nfactorized description for several types of hard exclusive reactions. In this\npaper, we address the possibility of accessing nucleon-to-pion ($\\pi N$) TDAs\nfrom $\\bar{p}p \\to e^+e^- \\pi^0$ reaction with the future \\={P}ANDA detector at\nthe FAIR facility. At high center of mass energy and high invariant mass\nsquared of the lepton pair $q^2$, the amplitude of the signal channel $\\bar{p}p\n\\to e^+e^- \\pi^0$ admits a QCD factorized description in terms of $\\pi N$ TDAs\nand nucleon Distribution Amplitudes (DAs) in the forward and backward kinematic\nregimes. Assuming the validity of this factorized description, we perform\nfeasibility studies for measuring $\\bar{p}p \\to e^+e^- \\pi^0$ with the\n\\={P}ANDA detector. Detailed simulations on signal reconstruction efficiency as\nwell as on rejection of the most severe background channel, i.e. $\\bar{p}p \\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^- \\pi^0$ were performed for the center of mass energy squared $s = 5$\nGeV$^2$ and $s = 10$ GeV$^2$, in the kinematic regions $3.0 < q^2 < 4.3$\nGeV$^2$ and $5 < q^2 < 9$ GeV$^2$, respectively, with a neutral pion scattered\nin the forward or backward cone $| \\cos\\theta_{\\pi^0}| > 0.5 $ in the\nproton-antiproton center of mass frame. Results of the simulation show that the\nparticle identification capabilities of the \\={P}ANDA detector will allow to\nachieve a background rejection factor of $5\\cdot 10^7$ ($1\\cdot 10^7$) at low\n(high) $q^2$ for $s=5$ GeV$^2$, and of $1\\cdot 10^8$ ($6\\cdot 10^6$) at low\n(high) $q^2$ for $s=10$ GeV$^2$, while keeping the signal reconstruction\nefficiency at around $40\\%$. At both energies, a clean lepton signal can be\nreconstructed with the expected statistics corresponding to $2$ fb$^{-1}$ of\nintegrated luminosity. (.../...)\n", "  The main result of this paper is that determinantal point processes on the\nreal line corresponding to projection operators with integrable kernels are\nquasi-invariant, in the continuous case, under the group of diffeomorphisms\nwith compact support (Theorem 1.4); in the discrete case, under the group of\nall finite permutations of the phase space (Theorem 1.6). The Radon-Nikodym\nderivative is computed explicitly and is given by a regularized multiplicative\nfunctional. Theorem 1.4 applies, in particular, to the sine-process, as well as\nto determinantal point processes with the Bessel and the Airy kernels; Theorem\n1.6 to the discrete sine-process and the Gamma kernel process. The paper\nanswers a question of Grigori Olshanski.\n", "  We study the effect of T-duality on supersymmetry in the context of type II\nsupergravity. For both U(1) Abelian and SU(2) non-Abelian T-duality, we\ndemonstrate that the supersymmetry variations after T-duality are related to\nthe variations before T-duality through the Kosmann spinorial Lie derivative,\nwhich vanishes when the Killing spinors are independent of the T-duality\ndirections. As a byproduct of our analysis, we present closed expressions for\nSU(2) T-duality in a class of spacetimes with diagonal Bianchi IX symmetry and\ncomment on specific examples of T-dual geometries, including a novel AdS3\ngeometry with large N = (0,4) superconformal symmetry.\n", "  We study determinantal point processes on $\\mathbb{C}$ induced by the\nreproducing kernels of generalized Fock spaces as well as those on the unit\ndisc $\\mathbb{D}$ induced by the reproducing kernels of generalized Bergman\nspaces. In the first case, we show that all reduced Palm measures $\\textit{of\nthe same order}$ are equivalent. The Radon-Nikodym derivatives are computed\nexplicitly using regularized multiplicative functionals. We also show that\nthese determinantal point processes are rigid in the sense of Ghosh and Peres,\nhence reduced Palm measures $\\textit{of different orders}$ are singular. In the\nsecond case, we show that all reduced Palm measures, $\\textit{of all orders}$,\nare equivalent. The Radon-Nikodym derivatives are computed using regularized\nmultiplicative functionals associated with certain Blaschke products. The\nquasi-invariance of these determinantal point processes under the group of\ndiffeomorphisms with compact supports follows as a corollary.\n", "  Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) provide a natural ansatz for the\nground states of gapped, local Hamiltonians in which global characteristics of\na quantum state are encoded in properties of local tensors. We develop a\nframework to describe on-site symmetries, as occurring in systems exhibiting\nsymmetry-protected topological (SPT) quantum order, in terms of virtual\nsymmetries of the local tensors expressed as a set of matrix product operators\n(MPOs) labeled by distinct group elements. These MPOs describe the possibly\nanomalous symmetry of the edge theory, whose local degrees of freedom are\nconcretely identified in a PEPS. A classification of SPT phases is obtained by\nstudying the obstructions to continuously deforming one set of MPOs into\nanother, recovering the results derived for fixed-point models [X. Chen et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 87, 155114 (2013)]. Our formalism accommodates perturbations away\nfrom fixed point models, opening the possibility of studying phase transitions\nbetween different SPT phases. We also demonstrate that applying the recently\ndeveloped quantum state gauging procedure to a SPT PEPS yields a PEPS with\ntopological order determined by the initial symmetry MPOs. The MPO framework\nthus unifies the different approaches to classifying SPT phases, via\nfixed-points models, boundary anomalies, or gauging the symmetry, into the\nsingle problem of classifying inequivalent sets of matrix product operator\nsymmetries that are defined purely in terms of a PEPS.\n", "  In this work we generalize the quantum trajectory (QT) theory from Markovian\nto non-Markovian environments. We model the non-Markovian environment by using\na Lorentzian spectral density function with bandwidth ($\\Lambda$), and find\nperfect \"scaling\" property with the measurement frequency ($\\tau^{-1}$) in\nterms of the scaling variable $x=\\Lambda\\tau$. Our result bridges the gap\nbetween the existing QT theory and the Zeno effect, by rendering them as two\nextremes corresponding to $x\\to\\infty$ and $x\\to 0$, respectively. This\n$x$-dependent criterion improves the idea of using $\\tau$ alone, and\nquantitatively identifies the validity condition of the conventional QT theory.\n", "  Combining the stochastic and $\\delta N$ formalisms, we derive non\nperturbative analytical expressions for all correlation functions of scalar\nperturbations in single-field, slow-roll inflation. The standard, classical\nformulas are recovered as saddle-point limits of the full results. This yields\na classicality criterion that shows that stochastic effects are small only if\nthe potential is sub-Planckian and not too flat. The saddle-point approximation\nalso provides an expansion scheme for calculating stochastic corrections to\nobservable quantities perturbatively in this regime. In the opposite regime, we\nshow that a strong suppression in the power spectrum is generically obtained,\nand comment on the physical implications of this effect.\n", "  A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is an unusual localized state that is\nembedded in a continuum of extended states. Here, we present the general\ncondition for BICs to arise from wave equation separability and show that the\ndirectionality and dimensionality of their resonant radiation can be controlled\nby exploiting perturbations of certain symmetry. Using this general framework,\nwe construct new examples of separable BICs in realistic models of optical\npotentials for ultracold atoms, photonic systems, and systems described by\ntight binding. Such BICs with easily reconfigurable radiation patterns allow\nfor applications such as the storage and release of waves at a controllable\nrate and direction, systems that switch between different dimensions of\nconfinement, and experimental realizations in atomic, optical, and electronic\nsystems.\n", "  Exploiting quantum properties to outperform classical ways of\ninformation-processing is an outstanding goal of modern physics. A promising\nroute is quantum simulation, which aims at implementing relevant and\ncomputationally hard problems in controllable quantum systems. Here we\ndemonstrate that in a trapped ion setup, with present day technology, it is\npossible to realize a spin model of the Mattis type that exhibits spin glass\nphases. Remarkably, our method produces the glassy behavior without the need\nfor any disorder potential, just by controlling the detuning of the spin-phonon\ncoupling. Applying a transverse field, the system can be used to benchmark\nquantum annealing strategies which aim at reaching the ground state of the spin\nglass starting from the paramagnetic phase. In the vicinity of a phonon\nresonance, the problem maps onto number partitioning, and instances which are\ndifficult to address classically can be implemented.\n", "  We model the dynamics of attractively interacting ultracold bosonic atoms in\na quasi-one-dimensional wave-guide with additional harmonic trapping.\nInitially, we prepare the system in its ground state and then shift the zero of\nthe harmonic trap and switch on an additional narrow scattering potential near\nthe center of the trap. After colliding with the barrier twice, we propose to\nmeasure the number of atoms opposite to the initial condition. Quantum-enhanced\ninterferometry with quantum bright solitons allows us to predict detection of\nan offset of the scattering potential with considerably increased precision as\ncompared to single-particle experiments. In a future experimental realization\nthis might lead to measurement of weak forces caused, for example, by small\nhorizontal gradients in the gravitational potential - with a resolution of\nseveral micrometers given essentially by the size of the solitons. Our\nnumerical simulations are based on the rigorously proved effective potential\napproach developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 010403 (2009) and Phys. Rev. Lett.\n103, 210402 (2009)]. We choose our parameters such that the prerequisite of the\nproof (that the solitons cannot break apart, for energetic reasons) is always\nfulfilled, thus exploring a parameter regime inaccessible to the mean-field\ndescription via the Gross-Pitaevskii equation due to Schrodinger-cat states\noccurring in the many-particle quantum dynamics.\n", "  A first principles phase diagram calculation, that included van der Waals\ninteractions, was performed for the system\n(1-X)$\\cdot$MoS$_{2}$-(X)$\\cdot$MoTe$_{2}$. Surprisingly, the predicted phase\ndiagram has at least two ordered solid-solution phases, at $X \\approx 0.46$,\neven though all calculated formation energies are positive, in a ground-state\nanalysis that examined all configurations with 16 or fewer anion sites. The\nlower-temperature {\\bf $I$}-phase is predicted to transform to a\nhigher-temperature {\\bf $I^{\\prime}$}-phase at $T \\approx 500K$, and {\\bf\n$I^{\\prime}$} disorders at $T \\approx 730K$. Both these transitions are\npredicted to be first-order, and there are broad miscibility gaps on both sides\nof the ordered regions. Both the {\\bf $I$}- and {\\bf $I^{\\prime}$}-phases are\npredicted to be incommensurate: {\\bf $I$}-phase in three dimensions; and {\\bf\n$I^{\\prime}$}-phase in two dimensions.\n", "  In quantum communication protocols the existence of a shared reference frame\nbetween two spatially separated parties is normally presumed. However, in many\npractical situations we are faced with the problem of misaligned reference\nframes. In this paper, we study communication between two inertial observers\nwho have partial knowledge about the Lorentz transformation that relates their\nframes of reference. Since every Lorentz transformation can be decomposed into\na pure boost followed by a rotation, we begin by analysing the effects on\ncommunication when the parties have partial knowledge about the transformation\nrelating their frames, when the transformation is either a rotation or pure\nboost. This then enables us to investigate how the efficiency of communication\nis affected due to partially correlated inertial reference frames related by an\narbitrary Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, we show how the results of\nprevious studies where reference frames are completely uncorrelated are\nrecovered from our results in appropriate limits.\n", "  Measurements of multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations of charged\nparticles were performed in inelastic p+p interactions at 20, 31, 40, 80 and\n158 GeV/c beam momentum. Results for the scaled variance of the multiplicity\ndistribution and for three strongly intensive measures of multiplicity and\ntransverse momentum fluctuations \\$\\Delta[P_{T},N]\\$, \\$\\Sigma[P_{T},N]\\$ and\n\\$\\Phi_{p_T}\\$ are presented. For the first time the results on fluctuations\nare fully corrected for experimental biases. The results on multiplicity and\ntransverse momentum fluctuations significantly deviate from expectations for\nthe independent particle production. They also depend on charges of selected\nhadrons. The string-resonance Monte Carlo models EPOS and UrQMD do not describe\nthe data. The scaled variance of multiplicity fluctuations is significantly\nhigher in inelastic p+p interactions than in central Pb+Pb collisions measured\nby NA49 at the same energy per nucleon. This is in qualitative disagreement\nwith the predictions of the Wounded Nucleon Model. Within the statistical\nframework the enhanced multiplicity fluctuations in inelastic p+p interactions\ncan be interpreted as due to event-by-event fluctuations of the fireball energy\nand/or volume.\n", "  We prove the approach to equilibrium of quenched isolated quantum systems for\nwhich the change in the Hamiltonian brought about by the quench satisfies a\ncertain closed commutator algebra with all the extensive integrals of motion of\nthe system before the quench. The proof is carried out by following the exact\nunitary evolution of the entropy operator, defined as the negative of the\nlogarithm of the nonequilibrium density matrix, and showing that, under the\nconditions implied by the assumed algebra, this entropy operator becomes, at\ninfinite times, a linear combination of integrals of motion of the perturbed\nsystem. That is, we show how the nonequilibrium density matrix approaches a\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble. The restricted class of systems for which the\npresent results apply turn out to have degenerate spectra in general, as\nopposed to some generic systems for which a kind of ergodicity is expected,\nwith a nontrivial dynamics believed to find instances in one-dimensional\ninfinite super-integrable systems. Our findings constitute a direct\ndemonstration of how a non-ergodic isolated quantum system may get to\nstatistical equilibrium.\n", "  We study the limiting degree distribution of the vertex splitting model\nintroduced in \\cite{DDJS:2009}. This is a model of randomly growing ordered\ntrees, where in each time step the tree is separated into two components by\nsplitting a vertex into two, and then inserting an edge between the two new\nvertices. Under some assumptions on the parameters, related to the growth of\nthe maximal degree of the tree, we prove that the vertex degree densities\nconverge almost surely to constants which satisfy a system of equations. Using\nthis we are also able to strengthen and prove some previously non-rigorous\nresults mentioned in the literature.\n", "  There are a few methodologies to monitoring the Porous Silicon (PS) formation\nin-situ. One of these methodologies is photoacoustic. Previous works that\nreported the use of photoacoustic to study the PS formation do not provide the\nphysical explanation of the origin of the signal. In this paper, a physical\nexplanation is provided of the origin of the photoacoustic signal during the PS\netching. The incident modulated radiation and changes in the reflectance are\ntaken as thermal sources. In this paper, a useful methodology is proposed to\ndetermine the etching rate, porosity, and refractive index of a PS film by the\ndetermination of the sample thickness, using SEM images. This method was\ndeveloped by carrying out two different experiments using the same anodization\nconditions. The first experiment consisted of the growth of samples with\ndifferent etching times to prove the periodicity of the photoacoustic signal\nand the second considered the growth samples using three different wavelengths\nthat are correlated with the period of the photoacoustic signal. The last\nexperiment showed that the period of the photoacoustic signal is proportional\nto the laser wavelength.\n", "  In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the Electroweak Precision\nObservables (EWPO) in composite Higgs models based on the coset $SO(5)/SO(4)$.\nIn our study we include both the fermionic top partners and the spin-1\nresonances and consider their possible interplay as well. In order to achieve\ncalculability we use the assumptions of i) partial Ultra Violet Completion\n(PUVC) following arXiv:1109.1570 and, ii) absence of sizeable effects from\nphysics above the cut-off. Apart from the EWPO, we also take into account the\nconstraints from the top quark, $Z$ and the Higgs boson masses whenever they\ncan be predicted in terms of the model parameters. After presenting our\nanalytic results (often, in certain limits) and discussing their symmetry\nproperties, we also perform detailed fits of the model parameters following the\nBayesian approach. We show the posterior probability distributions of the\nparameters in various scenarios and provide with analytic understanding\nwhenever possible. We find that in certain cases the EWPO allow the\ncompositeness scale to lie well below $1$ TeV. Moreover, fermionic top partners\nof mass around $1$ TeV and spin-1 resonances of mass around $2-3$ TeV are\nconsistent with the precision data.\n", "  Two partial orderings among communication channels, namely, `being degradable\ninto' and `being less noisy than,' are reconsidered in the light of recent\nresults about statistical comparisons of quantum channels. Though our analysis\ncovers at once both classical and quantum channels, we also provide a separate\ntreatment of classical noisy channels, and show how, in this case, an\nalternative self-contained proof can be constructed, with its own particular\nmerits with respect to the general result.\n", "  Traditionally, photonic crystal slabs can support resonances that are\nstrongly confined to the slab but also couple to external radiation. However,\nwhen a photonic crystal slab is placed on a substrate, the resonance modes\nbecome less confined, and as the index contrast between slab and substrate\ndecreases, they eventually disappear. Using the scale structure of the Dione\njuno butterfly wing as an inspiration, we present a low-index zigzag surface\nstructure that supports resonance modes even without index contrast with the\nsubstrate. The zigzag structure supports resonances that are contained away\nfrom the substrate, which reduces the interaction between the resonance and the\nsubstrate. We experimentally verify the existence of substrate-independent\nresonances in the visible wavelength regime. Potential applications include\nsubstrate-independent structural color and light guiding.\n", "  The iso-frequency contours of a photonic crystal are important for predicting\nand understanding exotic optical phenomena that are not apparent from\nhigh-symmetry band structure visualizations. Here, we demonstrate a method to\ndirectly visualize the iso-frequency contours of high-quality photonic crystal\nslabs that shows quantitatively good agreement with numerical results\nthroughout the visible spectrum. Our technique relies on resonance-enhanced\nphoton scattering from generic fabrication disorder and surface roughness, so\nit can be applied to general photonic and plasmonic crystals, or even\nquasi-crystals. We also present an analytical model of the scattering process,\nwhich explains the observation of iso-frequency contours in our technique.\nFurthermore, the iso-frequency contours provide information about the\ncharacteristics of the disorder and therefore serve as a feedback tool to\nimprove fabrication processes.\n", "  Motor coordination is an important feature of intra- and inter-personal\ninteractions, and several scenarios --- from finger tapping to human-computer\ninterfaces --- have been investigated experimentally. In the 1980, Haken, Kelso\nand Bunz formulated a coupled nonlinear two-oscillator model, which has been\nshown to describe many observed aspects of coordination tasks. We present here\na bifurcation study of this model, where we consider a delay in the coupling.\nThe delay is shown to have a significant effect on the observed dynamics. In\nparticular, we find a much larger degree of bistablility between in-phase and\nanti-phase oscillations in the presence of a frequency detuning.\n", "  We propose a device architecture capable of direct quantum electro-optical\nconversion of microwave to optical photons. The hybrid system consists of a\nplanar superconducting microwave circuit coupled to an integrated\nwhispering-gallery-mode microresonator made from an electro-optical material.\nWe show that electro-optical (vacuum) coupling rates $g_0$ as large as$\\sim\n2\\pi \\, \\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ kHz are achievable with currently available\ntechnology, due to the small mode volume of the planar microwave resonator.\nOperating at millikelvin temperatures, such a converter would enable\nhigh-efficiency conversion of microwave to optical photons. We analyze the\nadded noise, and show that maximum conversion efficiency is achieved for a\nmulti-photon cooperativity of unity which can be reached with optical power as\nlow as $ \\mathcal{O}(1)\\,\\mathrm{mW} $.\n", "  We consider the diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC in the context of SU(5)\ngrand unification. A leading candidate to explain this resonance is a standard\nmodel singlet scalar decaying to a pair of photon by means of vector-like\nfermionic loops. We demonstrate the effect of the vector-like multiplets (5, 5\nbar) and (10, 10 bar) on the evolution of the gauge couplings and\nperturbatively evaluate the weak scale values of the new couplings and masses\nrun down from the unification scale. We use these masses and couplings to\nexplain the diphoton resonance after considering the new dijet constraints. We\nshow how to accommodate the larger decay width of the resonance particle, which\nseems to be preferred by the experimental data. In addition, we consider new\ncouplings relating various components of (5, 5 bar) and (10, 10 bar) in the\ncontext of the orbifold GUTs, where the resonance scalar can be a part of the\nnew vector-like lepton doublets. We also calculate the Higgs mass and proton\ndecay rate to positron and neutral pion in the context of SU(5) grand\nunification, including effects of the new vector-like multiplets.\n", "  We study the impact on electroweak baryogenesis from a swifter cosmological\nexpansion induced by dark matter. We detail the experimental bounds that one\ncan place on models that realize it, and we investigate the modifications of\nthese bounds that result from a non-standard cosmological history. The\nmodifications can be sizeable if the expansion rate of the Universe increases\nby several orders of magnitude. We illustrate the impact through the example of\nscalar field dark matter, which can alter the cosmological history enough to\nenable a strong-enough first-order phase transition in the Standard Model when\nit is supplemented by a dimension six operator directly modifying the Higgs\nboson potential. We show that due to the modified cosmological history,\nelectroweak baryogenesis can be realized, while keeping deviations of the\ntriple Higgs coupling below HL-LHC sensitivies. The required scale of new\nphysics to effectuate a strong-enough first order phase transition can change\nby as much as twenty percent as the expansion rate increases by six orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  Understanding the reason for the observed accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse represents one of the fundamental open questions in physics. In\ncosmology, a classification has emerged among physical models for the\nacceleration, distinguishing between Dark Energy and Modified Gravity. In this\nreview, we give a brief overview of models in both categories as well as their\nphenomenology and characteristic observable signatures in cosmology. We also\nintroduce a rigorous distinction between Dark Energy and Modified Gravity based\non the strong and weak equivalence principles.\n", "  Over the past few decades, an anomalous 511 keV gamma-ray line has been\nobserved from the centre of the Milky Way. Dark matter (DM) in the form of\nlight weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) annihilating into\nelectron-positron pairs has been one of the leading hypotheses of the observed\nemission. Given the small required cross section, a further coupling to lighter\nparticles is required to produce the correct relic density. Here, we derive\nconstraints from the Planck satellite on light WIMPs that were in equilibrium\nwith either the neutrino or electron sector in the early universe. For the\nneutrino sector, we obtain a lower bound on the WIMP mass of 4 MeV for a real\nscalar and 10 MeV for a Dirac fermion DM particle, at 95% CL. For the electron\nsector, we find even stronger bounds of 7 and 11 MeV, respectively. Using these\nresults, we show that, in the absence of additional ingredients such as dark\nradiation, the light thermally produced WIMP explanation of the 511 keV excess\nis strongly disfavoured by the latest cosmological data. This suggests an\nunknown astrophysical or more exotic DM source of the signal.\n", "  A thermally decoupled hidden sector of particles, with a mass gap,\ngenerically enters a phase of cannibalism in the early Universe. The Standard\nModel sector becomes exponentially colder than the hidden sector. We propose\nthe Cannibal Dark Matter framework, where dark matter resides in a\ncannibalizing sector with a relic density set by 2-to-2 annihilations.\nObservable signals of Cannibal Dark Matter include a boosted rate for indirect\ndetection, new relativistic degrees of freedom, and warm dark matter.\n", "  Weyl fermions have recently been observed in several time-reversal-invariant\nsemimetals and photonics materials with broken inversion symmetry. These\nsystems are expected to have exotic transport properties such as the chiral\nanomaly. However, most discovered Weyl materials possess a substantial number\nof Weyl nodes close to the Fermi level that give rise to complicated transport\nproperties. Here we predict, for the first time, a new family of Weyl systems\ndefined by broken time-reversal symmetry, namely, Co-based magnetic Heusler\nmaterials XCo2Z (X = IVB or VB; Z = IVA or IIIA). To search for Weyl fermions\nin the centrosymmetric magnetic systems, we recall an easy and practical\ninversion invariant, which has been calculated to be -1, guaranteeing the\nexistence of an odd number of pairs of Weyl fermions. These materials exhibit,\nwhen alloyed, only two Weyl nodes at the Fermi level - the minimum number\npossible in a condensed matter system. The Weyl nodes are protected by the\nrotational symmetry along the magnetic axis and separated by a large distance\n(of order 2$\\pi$) in the Brillouin zone. The corresponding Fermi arcs have been\ncalculated as well. This discovery provides a realistic and promising platform\nfor manipulating and studying the magnetic Weyl physics in experiments.\n", "  Plasmonics enables deep-subwavelength concentration of light and has become\nimportant for fundamental studies as well as real-life applications. Two major\nexisting platforms of plasmonics are metallic nanoparticles and metallic films.\nMetallic nanoparticles allow efficient coupling to far field radiation, yet\ntheir synthesis typically leads to poor material quality. Metallic films offer\nsubstantially higher quality materials, but their coupling to radiation is\ntypically jeopardized due to the large momentum mismatch with free space. Here,\nwe propose and theoretically investigate optically thin metallic films as an\nideal platform for high-radiative-efficiency plasmonics. For far-field\nscattering, adding a thin high-quality metallic substrate enables a higher\nquality factor while maintaining the localization and tunability that the\nnanoparticle provides. For near-field spontaneous emission, a thin metallic\nsubstrate, of high quality or not, greatly improves the field overlap between\nthe emitter environment and propagating surface plasmons, enabling high-Purcell\n(total enhancement > $10^4$), high-quantum-yield (> 50 %) spontaneous emission,\neven as the gap size vanishes (3$\\sim$5 nm). The enhancement has almost\nspatially independent efficiency and does not suffer from quenching effects\nthat commonly exist in previous structures.\n", "  It was suggested by dimensional analysis that there exists a limit called the\nPlanck energy scale coming close to which the gravitational effects of physical\nprocesses would inflate and struggle for equal rights so as to spoil the\nvalidity of pure non-gravitational physical theories that governed well below\nthe Planck energy. Near the Planck scale, the Planck charges, Planck currents,\nor Planck parameters can be defined and assigned to physical quantities such as\nthe single particle electric charge and magnetic charge as the ceiling value\nobeyed by the low energy ordinary physics. The Dirac electric-magnetic charge\nquantization relation as one form of electric-magnetic duality dictates that,\nthe present low value electric charge corresponds to a huge magnetic charge\nvalue already passed the Planck limit so as to render theories of magnetic\nmonopoles into the strong coupling regime, and vice versa, that small and\ntractable magnetic charge values correspond to huge electric charge values. It\nsuggests that for theoretic models in which the renormalization group equation\nprovides rapid growth for the running electric coupling constant, it is easier\nfor the dual magnetic monopoles to emerge at lower energy scales. Allowing\ncharges to vary with the Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation\nwhile keeping values under the Planck limit informs that the magnetic charge\nvalue drops below the Planck ceiling value into the manageable region when the\nelectric coupling constant grows to one fourth at a model dependent energy\nscale, and continues dropping towards half the value of the Planck magnetic\ncharge as the electric coupling constant continues growing at the model\ndependent rate towards one near Planck energy scale.\n", "  The ability to control a complex network towards a desired behavior relies on\nour understanding of the complex nature of these social and technological\nnetworks. The existence of numerous control schemes in a network promotes us to\nwonder: what is the underlying relationship of all possible input nodes? Here\nwe introduce input graph, a simple geometry that reveals the complex\nrelationship between all control schemes and input nodes. We prove that the\nnode adjacent to an input node in the input graph will appear in another\ncontrol scheme, and the connected nodes in input graph have the same type in\ncontrol, which they are either all possible input nodes or not. Furthermore, we\nfind that the giant components emerge in the input graphs of many real\nnetworks, which provides a clear topological explanation of bifurcation\nphenomenon emerging in dense networks and promotes us to design an efficient\nmethod to alter the node type in control. The findings provide an insight into\ncontrol principles of complex networks and offer a general mechanism to design\na suitable control scheme for different purposes.\n", "  The finite-time operation of a quantum heat engine that uses a single\nparticle as a working medium generally increases the output power at the\nexpense of inducing friction that lowers the cycle efficiency. We propose to\nscale up a quantum heat engine utilizing a many-particle working medium in\ncombination with the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity to boost the nonadiabatic\nperformance by eliminating quantum friction and reducing the cycle time. To\nthis end, we first analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of a quantum Otto\ncycle implemented with a quantum fluid confined in a time-dependent harmonic\ntrap. We show that nonadiabatic effects can be controlled and tailored to match\nthe adiabatic performance using a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As a\nresult, the nonadiabatic dynamics of the scaled-up many-particle quantum heat\nengine exhibits no friction and the cycle can be run at maximum efficiency with\na tunable output power. We demonstrate our results with a working medium\nconsisting of particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions, that\nincludes noninteracting and hard-core bosons as limiting cases.\n", "  The one- and two-photon scattering matrix S is obtained analytically for a\none-dimensional waveguide and a point-like scatterer with N excited levels\n(generalized V -type atom). We argue that the two-photon scattering matrix\ncontains sufficient information to distinguish between different level\nstructures which are equivalent for single-photon scattering, such as a V -atom\nwith N = 2 excited levels and two two-level systems. In particular, we show\nthat the scattering with the V -type atom exhibits a destructive interference\neffect leading to two-photon Coupled-Resonator-Induced Transparency, where the\nnonlinear part of the two-photon scattering matrix vanishes when each incident\nphoton fulfills a single-photon condition for transparency.\n", "  We investigate the cost of Grover's quantum search algorithm when used in the\ncontext of pre-image attacks on the SHA-2 and SHA-3 families of hash functions.\nOur cost model assumes that the attack is run on a surface code based\nfault-tolerant quantum computer. Our estimates rely on a time-area metric that\ncosts the number of logical qubits times the depth of the circuit in units of\nsurface code cycles. As a surface code cycle involves a significant classical\nprocessing stage, our cost estimates allow for crude, but direct, comparisons\nof classical and quantum algorithms.\n  We exhibit a circuit for a pre-image attack on SHA-256 that is approximately\n$2^{153.8}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately $2^{12.6}$\nlogical qubits. This yields an overall cost of $2^{166.4}$\nlogical-qubit-cycles. Likewise we exhibit a SHA3-256 circuit that is\napproximately $2^{146.5}$ surface code cycles deep and requires approximately\n$2^{20}$ logical qubits for a total cost of, again, $2^{166.5}$\nlogical-qubit-cycles. Both attacks require on the order of $2^{128}$ queries in\na quantum black-box model, hence our results suggest that executing these\nattacks may be as much as $275$ billion times more expensive than one would\nexpect from the simple query analysis.\n", "  The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system\nis non-decreasing. Discussing the Second Law in the quantum world poses new\nchallenges and provides new opportunities, involving fundamental\nquantum-information-theoretic questions and novel quantum-engineered devices.\nIn quantum mechanics, systems with an evolution described by a so-called unital\nquantum channel evolve with a non-decreasing entropy. Here, we seek the\nopposite, a system described by a non-unital and, furthermore,\nenergy-conserving channel that describes a system whose entropy decreases with\ntime. We propose a setup involving a mesoscopic four-lead scatterer augmented\nby a micro-environment in the form of a spin that realizes this goal. Within\nthis non-unital and energy-conserving quantum channel, the micro-environment\nacts with two non-commuting operations on the system in an autonomous way. We\nfind, that the process corresponds to a partial exchange or swap between the\nsystem and environment quantum states, with the system's entropy decreasing if\nthe environment's state is more pure. This entropy-decreasing process is\nnaturally expressed through the action of a quantum Maxwell demon and we\npropose a quantum-thermodynamic engine with four qubits that extracts work from\na single heat reservoir when provided with a reservoir of pure qubits. The\nspecial feature of this engine, which derives from the energy-conservation in\nthe non-unital quantum channel, is its separation into two cycles, a working\ncycle and an entropy cycle, allowing to run this engine with no local waste\nheat.\n", "  On July 14th 2015, NASA's New Horizons mission gave us an unprecedented\ndetailed view of the Pluto system. The complex compositional diversity of\nPluto's encounter hemisphere was revealed by the Ralph/LEISA infrared\nspectrometer on board of New Horizons. We present compositional maps of Pluto\ndefining the spatial distribution of the abundance and textural properties of\nthe volatiles methane and nitrogen ices and non-volatiles water ice and tholin.\nThese results are obtained by applying a pixel-by-pixel Hapke radiative\ntransfer model to the LEISA scans. Our analysis focuses mainly on the large\nscale latitudinal variations of methane and nitrogen ices and aims at setting\nobservational constraints to volatile transport models. Specifically, we find\nthree latitudinal bands: the first, enriched in methane, extends from the pole\nto 55deg N, the second dominated by nitrogen, continues south to 35deg N, and\nthe third, composed again mainly of methane, reaches 20deg N. We demonstrate\nthat the distribution of volatiles across these surface units can be explained\nby differences in insolation over the past few decades. The latitudinal pattern\nis broken by Sputnik Planitia, a large reservoir of volatiles, with nitrogen\nplaying the most important role. The physical properties of methane and\nnitrogen in this region are suggestive of the presence of a cold trap or\npossible volatile stratification. Furthermore our modeling results point to a\npossible sublimation transport of nitrogen from the northwest edge of Sputnik\nPlanitia toward the south.\n", "  In this work, we probe a class of neutrino mass models through the lepton\nflavor violating interactions of a singlet charged scalar, $S^{\\pm}$ at the LHC\nproton-proton collisions with 8 TeV and 14 TeV energies. This scalar couples to\nthe leptons and induces many processes such as\n$pp\\rightarrow\\ell^{\\pm}\\ell^{\\pm}\\ell^{\\mp}+\\slashed{E}_{T}$. In our analysis\nwe discuss the opposite sign same flavor leptons signal, as well as the\nbackground free channel with the tau contribution which can enhance the\nsignal/background ratio for center of mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$= 8 TeV and\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV.\n", "  In many applications it is of interest to identify anomalous behavior within\na dynamic interacting system. Such anomalous interactions are reflected by\nstructural changes in the network representation of the system. We propose and\ninvestigate the use of a dynamic version of the degree corrected stochastic\nblock model (DCSBM) to model and monitor dynamic networks that undergo a\nsignificant structural change. We apply statistical process monitoring\ntechniques to the estimated parameters of the DCSBM to identify significant\nstructural changes in the network. Application of our surveillance strategy to\nthe dynamic U.S. Senate co-voting network reveals that we are able to detect\nsignificant changes in the network that reflect both times of cohesion and\ntimes of polarization among Republican and Democratic party members. These\nfindings provide valuable insight about the evolution of the bipartisan\npolitical system in the United States. Our analysis demonstrates that the\ndynamic DCSBM monitoring procedure effectively detects local and global\nstructural changes in dynamic networks. The DCSBM approach is an example of a\nmore general framework that combines parametric random graph models and\nstatistical process monitoring techniques for network surveillance.\n", "  Strong interaction between light and a single quantum emitter is essential to\na great number of applications, including single photon sources. Microcavities\nand plasmonic antennas have been used frequently to enhance these interactions\nthrough the Purcell effect. Both can provide large emission enhancements: the\ncavity typically through long photon lifetimes (high $Q$), and the antenna\nmostly through strong field enhancement (low mode volume $V$). In this work, we\ndemonstrate that a hybrid system, which combines a cavity and a dipolar\nantenna, can achieve stronger emission enhancements than the cavity or antenna\nalone. We show that such systems can be used as a versatile platform to tune\nthe bandwidth of enhancement to any desired value, while simultaneously\nboosting emission enhancement. Our fully consistent analytical model allows to\nidentify the underlying mechanisms of boosted emission enhancement in hybrid\nsystems, which include radiation damping and constructive interference between\nmultiple-scattering paths. Additionally, we find excellent agreement between\nstrongly boosted enhancement spectra from our analytical model and from\nfinite-element simulations on a realistic cavity-antenna system. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that hybrid systems can simultaneously boost emission enhancement\nand maintain a near-unity outcoupling efficiency into a single cavity decay\nchannel, such as a waveguide.\n", "  We have characterized the one-dimensional (1D) to three-dimensional (3D)\ncrossover of a two-component spin-imbalanced Fermi gas of 6-lithium atoms in a\n2D optical lattice by varying the lattice tunneling and the interactions. The\ngas phase separates, and we detect the phase boundaries using in situ imaging\nof the inhomogeneous density profiles. The locations of the phases are inverted\nin 1D as compared to 3D, thus providing a clear signature of the crossover. By\nscaling the tunneling rate with respect to the pair binding energy, we observe\na collapse of the data to a universal crossover point at a scaled tunneling\nvalue of 0.025(7).\n", "  We examine the effectiveness of the Generalised Quasilinear (GQL)\nApproximation introduced by Marston et al (2016). This approximation splits the\nvariables into large and small scales in directions where there is a\ntranslational symmetry and removes nonlinear interactions involving only small\nscales. We utilise as a paradigm problem three-dimensional, turbulent, rotating\nCouette flow. We compare the results obtained from Direct Numerical Solution of\nthe equations with those from Quasilinear (QL) and GQL calculations. In this\nthree-dimensional setting, there is a choice of cut-off wavenumber for the GQL\napproximation both in the streamwise and in the spanwise directions. We\ndemonstrate that the GQL approximation significantly improves the accuracy of\nmean flows, spectra and two-point correlation functions over models that are\nquasilinear in any of the translationally invariant directions, even if only a\nfew streamwise and spanwise modes are included. We argue that this provides\nsignificant support for a programme of Direct Statistical Simulation utilising\nthe GQL approximation.\n", "  Dynamical reduction models propose a solution to the measurement problem in\nquantum mechanics: the collapse of the wave function becomes a physical\nprocess. We compute the predictions to decaying and Dynamical reduction models\npropose a solution to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics: the\ncollapse of the wave function becomes a physical process. We compute the\npredictions to decaying and flavor--oscillating neutral mesons for the two most\npromising collapse models, the QMUPL (Quantum Mechanics with Universal Position\nLocalization) model and the mass-proportional CSL (Continuous Spontaneous\nLocalization) model. Our results are showing (i) a strong sensitivity to the\nvery assumptions of the noise field underlying those two collapse models and\n(ii) under particular assumptions the CSL case allows even to recover the decay\ndynamics. This in turn allows to predict the effective collapse rates solely\nbased on the measured values for the oscillation (mass differences) and the\nmeasured values of the decay constants. The four types of neutral mesons\n($K$-meson, $D$-meson, $B_d$-meson, $B_s$-meson) lead surprisingly to ranges\ncomparable to those put forward by Adler (2007) and Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber\n(1986). Our results show that these systems at high energies are very sensitive\nto possible modifications of the standard quantum theory making them a very\npowerful laboratory to rule out certain collapse scenarios and studying the\ndetailed physical processes solving the measurement problem.\n", "  Cooperation can be supported by indirect reciprocity via reputation.Thanks to\ngossip, reputations are built and circulated and humans can identify defectors\nand ostracise them. However, the evolutionary stability of gossip is allegedly\nundermined by the fact that it is more error-prone that direct observation,\nwhereas ostracism could be ineffective if the partner selection mechanism is\nnot robust. The aim of this work is to investigate the conditions under which\nthe combination of gossip and ostracism might support cooperation in groups of\ndifferent sizes. We are also interested in exploring the extent to which errors\nin transmission might undermine the reliability of gossip as a mechanism for\nidentifying defectors. Our results show that a large quantity of gossip is\nnecessary to support cooperation, and that group structure can mitigate the\neffects of errors in transmission.\n", "  We consider Bell tests in which the distant observers can perform local\nfiltering before testing a Bell inequality. Notably, in this setup, certain\nentangled states admitting a local hidden variable model in the standard Bell\nscenario can nevertheless violate a Bell inequality after filtering, displaying\nso-called hidden nonlocality. Here we ask whether all entangled states can\nviolate a Bell inequality after well-chosen local filtering. We answer this\nquestion in the negative by showing that there exist entangled states without\nhidden nonlocality. Specifically, we prove that some two-qubit Werner states\nstill admit a local hidden variable model after any possible local filtering on\na single copy of the state.\n", "  We assign the chiral fermion fields of the Standard model to triplets of\nflavor (family, generation, horizontal) $SU(3)_f$ symmetry, for anomaly freedom\nadd one triplet of sterile right-handed neutrino fields, and gauge that\nsymmetry. First we demonstrate that the resulting quantum flavor $SU(3)_f$\ndynamics completely spontaneously self-breaks: Both the Majorana masses of\nsterile neutrinos and the masses of all eight flavor gluons come out\nproportional to the $SU(3)_f$ scale $\\Lambda$. Mixing of sterile neutrinos\nyields new CP-violating phases needed for understanding the baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe. Second, the $SU(3)_f$ dynamics with weak hypercharge radiative\ncorrections spontaneously generates the lepton and quark masses exponentially\nsuppressed with respect to $\\Lambda$. Three active neutrinos come out as\nMajorana particles extremely light by seesaw. The Goldstone theorem implies:\n(i) The electroweak bosons $W$ and $Z$ acquire masses. (ii) There are three\naxions, decent candidates for dark matter. Invisibility of the Weinberg-Wilczek\naxion $a$ with mass $m_a \\sim \\rm m^2_{\\pi}/\\Lambda$ restricts the scale\n$\\Lambda$ from $\\Lambda \\sim \\rm 10^{10} GeV$ upwards. Third, the composite\n'would-be' Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons of all spontaneously broken gauge\nsymmetries have their {\\it genuine composite} massive partners: (i) One $0^{+}$\nflavorless Higgs-like particle $h$ accompanying three electroweak 'would-be' NG\nbosons. (ii) Two $0^{+}$ flavored Higgs-like particles $h_3$ and $h_8$\naccompanying six flavored electroweak 'would-be' NG bosons. (iii) Three\nsuperheavy spin-zero sterile-neutrino-composites $\\chi_i$ accompanying eight\nflavored sterile-neutrino-composite 'would-be' NG bosons. We identify $\\chi_i$\nwith inflatons.\n", "  Experiments in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics rely on lasers at\nmany different wavelengths and with varying requirements on spectral linewidth,\npower, and intensity stability. Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting\nlasers (VECSELs), when combined with nonlinear frequency conversion, can\npotentially replace many of the laser systems currently in use. Here we present\nand characterize VECSEL systems that can perform all laser-based tasks for\nquantum information processing experiments with trapped magnesium ions. For\nphotoionization of neutral magnesium, 570.6$\\,$nm light is generated with an\nintracavity frequency-doubled VECSEL containing a lithium triborate (LBO)\ncrystal for second harmonic generation. External frequency doubling produces\n285.3$\\,$nm light for resonant interaction with the $^{1}S_{0}\\leftrightarrow$\n$^{1}P_{1}$ transition of neutral Mg. Using an externally frequency-quadrupled\nVECSEL, we implement Doppler cooling of $^{25}$Mg$^{+}$ on the 279.6$\\,$nm\n$^{2}S_{1/2}\\leftrightarrow$ $^{2}P_{3/2}$ cycling transition, repumping on the\n280.4$\\,$nm $^{2}S_{1/2}\\leftrightarrow$ $^{2}P_{1/2}$ transition, coherent\nstate manipulation, and resolved sideband cooling close to the motional ground\nstate. Our systems serve as prototypes for applications in AMO requiring\nsingle-frequency, power-scalable laser sources at multiple wavelengths.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a possibility to establish multi-qubit quantum\ncorrelations in one-dimensional chains of qubits. We combine a reservoir\nengineering strategy with coherent dynamics to generate multi-qubit entangled\nstates. We find that an interplay between the coherent and incoherent dynamics\nresult in the generation of stable (time-independent) many-body entangled\nsteady states. Our results will be relevant in the context of the dissipative\ngeneration of quantum states, with applications in short-distance quantum\ncomputation and for exploring the emergence of collective phenomena in\nmany-body open quantum systems.\n", "  A search for $W^\\prime$ bosons in events with one lepton (electron or muon)\nand missing transverse momentum is presented. The search uses 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of\n$pp$ collision data collected at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV by the ATLAS experiment at\nthe LHC in 2015. The transverse mass distribution is examined and no\nsignificant excess of events above the level expected from Standard Model\nprocesses is observed. Upper limits on the $W^\\prime$ boson cross-section times\nbranching ratio to leptons are set as a function of the $W^\\prime$ mass.\nAssuming a $W^\\prime$ boson as predicted by the Sequential Standard Model,\n$W^\\prime$ masses below 4.07 TeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level. This\nextends the limit set using LHC data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV by around 800 GeV.\n", "  Strong electron correlations lie at the origin of transformative phenomena\nsuch as colossal magneto-resistance and high-temperature superconductivity.\nAlready near room temperature, doped copper oxide materials display remarkable\nfeatures such as a pseudo-gap and a \"strange metal\" phase with unusual\ntransport properties. The essence of this physics is believed to be captured by\nthe Fermi-Hubbard model of repulsively interacting, itinerant fermions on a\nlattice. Here we report on the site-resolved observation of charge and spin\ncorrelations in the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi-Hubbard model realized with\nultracold atoms. Antiferromagnetic spin correlations are maximal at\nhalf-filling and weaken monotonically upon doping. Correlations between singly\ncharged sites are negative at large doping, revealing the Pauli and correlation\nhole\\textemdash a suppressed probability of finding two fermions near each\nother. However, as the doping is reduced below a critical value, correlations\nbetween such local magnetic moments become positive, signaling strong bunching\nof doublons and holes. Excellent agreement with numerical linked-cluster\nexpansion (NLCE) and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations is\nfound. Positive non-local moment correlations directly imply potential energy\nfluctuations due to doublon-hole pairs, which should play an important role for\ntransport in the Fermi-Hubbard model.\n", "  Strongly irradiated giant planets are observed to have radii larger than\nthermal evolution models predict. Although these inflated planets have been\nknown for over fifteen years, it is unclear whether their inflation is caused\nby deposition of energy from the host star, or inhibited cooling of the planet.\nThese processes can be distinguished if the planet becomes highly irradiated\nonly when the host star evolves onto the red giant branch. We report the\ndiscovery of K2-97b, a 1.31 $\\pm$ 0.11 R$_\\mathrm{J}$, 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.11\nM$_\\mathrm{J}$ planet orbiting a 4.20 $\\pm$ 0.14 R$_\\odot$, 1.16 $\\pm$ 0.12\nM$_\\odot$ red giant star with an orbital period of 8.4 days. We precisely\nconstrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology,\nspectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial\nvelocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by\nsystematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30%\nbetween different lightcurve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the\nincident flux on this planet was 170$^{+140}_{-60}$ times the incident flux on\nEarth while the star was on the main sequence. Previous studies suggest that\nthis incident flux is insufficient to delay planetary cooling enough to explain\nthe present planet radius. This system thus provides the first evidence that\nplanets may be inflated directly by incident stellar radiation rather than by\ndelayed loss of heat from formation. Further studies of planets around red\ngiant branch stars will confirm or contradict this hypothesis, and may reveal a\nnew class of re-inflated planets.\n", "  Transition metal pentatelluride ZrTe5 is a versatile material in\ncondensed-matter physics and has been intensively studied since the 1980s. The\nmost fascinating feature of ZrTe5 is that it is a 3D Dirac semimetal which has\nlinear energy dispersion in all three dimensions in momentum space.\nStructure-wise, ZrTe5 is a layered material held together by weak interlayer\nvan der Waals force. The combination of its unique band structure and 2D atomic\nstructure provides a fertile ground for more potential exotic physical\nphenomena in ZrTe5 related to 3D Dirac semimentals. However the physical\nproperties of its few-layer form have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here we\nreport strong optical and electrical in-plane anisotropy of mechanically\nexfoliated few-layer ZrTe5. Raman spectroscopy shows significant intensity\nchange with sample orientations, and the behavior of angle-resolved phonon\nmodes at the gamma point is explained by theoretical calculation. DC\nconductance measurement indicates a 50% of difference along different in-plane\ndirections. The diminishing of resistivity anomaly in few-layer samples\nindicates the evolution of band structure with reduced thickness.\nLow-temperature Hall experiment sheds lights on more intrinsic anisotropic\nelectrical transport, with hole mobility of 3,000 and 1,500 cm2/Vs along a-axis\nand c-axis respectively. Pronounced quantum oscillations in magneto-resistance\nare observed at low temperatures with highest electron mobility up to 44,000\ncm2/Vs.\n", "  We consider a scenario of Low Scale Seesaw where the masses of its heavy\nMajorana neutrinos are arranged in a pattern of three pairs of quasi degenerate\nones, in the range of O(1-6 GeV). Since they can violate lepton number by two\nunits, they contribute to rare decays of Ds and Bc mesons, providing, besides,\nconditions for maximal CP violation. We found that new phenomenology is\npossible depending on how many of on-shell pairs mediate these decays. In\nparticular, we present new constraints on muon-heavy neutrinos mixing\nparameters.\n", "  Dissipation can be used as a resource to control and simulate quantum\nsystems. We discuss a modular model based on fast dissipation capable of\nperforming universal quantum computation, and simulating arbitrary Lindbladian\ndynamics. The model consists of a network of elementary dissipation-generated\nmodules and it is in principle scalable. In particular, we demonstrate the\nability to dissipatively prepare all single qubit gates, and the CNOT gate;\nprerequisites for universal quantum computing. We also show a way to implement\na type of quantum memory in a dissipative environment, whereby we can\narbitrarily control the loss in both coherence, and concurrence, over the\nevolution. Moreover, our dissipation-assisted modular construction exhibits a\ndegree of inbuilt robustness to Hamiltonian, and indeed Lindbladian errors, and\nas such is of potential practical relevance.\n", "  GaSb/InAs heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistors are strong\ncandidates in building future low-power integrated circuits, as they could\nprovide both steep subthreshold swing and large ON-state current\n($I_{\\rm{ON}}$). However, at short channel lengths they suffer from large\ntunneling leakage originating from the small band gap and small effective\nmasses of the InAs channel. As proposed in this article, this problem can be\nsignificantly mitigated by reducing the channel thickness meanwhile retaining a\nthick source-channel tunnel junction, thus forming a design with a non-uniform\nbody thickness. Because of the quantum confinement, the thin InAs channel\noffers a large band gap and large effective masses, reducing the ambipolar and\nsource-to-drain tunneling leakage at OFF state. The thick GaSb/InAs tunnel\njunction, instead, offers a low tunnel barrier and small effective masses,\nallowing a large tunnel probability at ON state. In addition, the confinement\ninduced band discontinuity enhances the tunnel electric field and creates a\nresonant state, further improving $I_{\\rm{ON}}$. Atomistic quantum transport\nsimulations show that ballistic $I_{\\rm{ON}}=284$A/m is obtained at 15nm\nchannel length, $I_{\\rm{OFF}}=1\\times10^{-3}$A/m, and $V_{\\rm{DD}}=0.3$V. While\nwith uniform body thickness, the largest achievable $I_{\\rm{ON}}$ is only\n25A/m. Simulations also indicate that this design is scalable to sub-10nm\nchannel length.\n", "  This Letter presents a search for new resonances with mass larger than 250\nGeV, decaying to a $Z$ boson and a photon. The dataset consists of an\nintegrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions collected at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The\n$Z$ bosons are identified through their decays either to charged, light, lepton\npairs ($e^+e^-$, $\\mu^+\\mu^-$) or to hadrons. The data are found to be\nconsistent with the expected background in the whole mass range investigated\nand upper limits are set on the production cross section times decay branching\nratio to $Z\\gamma$ of a narrow scalar boson with mass between 250 GeV and 2.75\nTeV.\n", "  The recent discovery of topological Kondo insulating behaviour in strongly\ncorrelated electron systems has generated considerable interest in Kondo\ninsulators both experimentally and theoretically. The Kondo semiconductors\nCeT2Al10 (T=Fe, Ru and Os) possessing a c-f hybridization gap have received\nconsiderable attention recently because of the unexpected high magnetic\nordering temperature of CeRu2Al10 (TN=27 K) and CeOs2Al10 (TN=28.5 K) and the\nKondo insulating behaviour observed in the valence fluctuating compound\nCeFe2Al10 with a paramagnetic ground state down to 50 mK. We are investigating\nthis family of compounds, both in polycrystalline and single crystal form,\nusing inelastic neutron scattering to understand the role of anisotropic c-f\nhybridization on the spin gap formation as well as on their magnetic\nproperties. We have observed a clear sign of a spin gap in all three compounds\nfrom our polycrystalline study as well as the existence of a spin gap above the\nmagnetic ordering temperature in T=Ru and Os. Our inelastic neutron scattering\nstudies on single crystals of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 revealed dispersive\ngapped spin wave excitations below TN. Analysis of the spin wave spectrum\nreveals the presence of strong anisotropic exchange, along the c-axis (or\nz-axis) stronger than in the ab-plane. These anisotropic exchange interactions\nforce the magnetic moment to align along the c-axis, competing with the single\nion crystal field anisotropy, which prefers moments along the a-axis. In the\nparamagnetic state (below 50 K) of the Kondo insulator CeFe2Al10, we have also\nobserved dispersive gapped magnetic excitations which transform into\nquasi-elastic scattering on heating to 100 K. We will discuss the origin of the\nanisotropic hybridization gap in CeFe2Al10 based on theoretical models of\nheavy-fermion semiconductors.\n", "  We study in this paper a dilute gas in a gravitational field and present a\nrelation of the molecular distribution function with respect to position and\nvelocity. The relation is obtained from the principle of detailed balance and\ncan be used to study temperature distribution and density distribution.\n", "  We demonstrate monolayer MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with\ntransport properties comparable to those of the best exfoliated devices over a\nwide range of carrier densities (up to ~10^13 1/cm^2) and temperatures (80-500\nK). Transfer length measurements reveal monolayer mobility of ~20 cm2/V/s on\nSiO2 substrates at 300 K and practical carrier densities (>2x10^12 1/cm^2). We\nalso demonstrate the highest current density reported to date (~270 uA/um or 44\nMA/cm^2) at 300 K for an 80 nm device from CVD-grown monolayer MoS2. Using\nsimulations, we discuss what improvements of monolayer MoS2 are still required\nto meet technology roadmap requirements for low power (LP) and high performance\n(HP) applications. Such results are an important step towards large-area\nelectronics based on monolayer semiconductors.\n", "  We study theoretically the transport properties of a three-dimensional spin\ntexture made from three orthogonal helices, which is essentially a lattice of\nmonopole-antimonopole pairs connected by Skyrmion strings. This spin structure\nis proposed for MnGe based on the neutron scattering experiment as well as the\nLorentz transmission electron microscopy observation. Equipped with a\nsophisticated spectral analysis method, we adopt finite temperature Green's\nfunction technique to calculate the longitudinal dc electric transport in such\nsystem. We consider conduction electrons interacting with spin waves of the\ntopologically nontrivial spin texture, wherein fluctuations of monopolar\nemergent magnetic field enter. We study in detail the behavior of electric\nresistivity under the influence of temperature, external magnetic field and a\ncharacteristic monopole motion, especially a novel magnetoresistivity effect\ndescribing the latest experimental observations in MnGe, wherein a topological\nphase transition signifying strong correlation is identified.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the abundance and distribution of metals in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) at $\\langle z \\rangle \\simeq 2.8$ through the\nanalysis of an ultra-high signal-to-noise ratio UVES spectrum of the quasar\nHE0940-1050. In the CIV forest, our deep spectrum is sensitive at $3\\,\\sigma$\nto lines with column density down to $\\log N_{\\rm CIV} \\simeq 11.4$ and in 60\nper cent of the considered redshift range down to $\\simeq11.1$. In our sample,\nall HI lines with $\\log N_{\\rm HI} \\ge 14.8$ show an associated CIV absorption.\nIn the range $14.0 \\le \\log N_{\\rm HI} <14.8$, 43 per cent of HI lines has an\nassociated CIV absorption. At $\\log N_{\\rm HI} < 14.0$, the detection rates\ndrop to $<10$ per cent, possibly due to our sensitivity limits and not to an\nactual variation of the gas abundance properties. In the range $\\log N_{\\rm HI}\n\\ge 14$, we observe a fraction of HI lines with detected CIV a factor of 2\nlarger than the fraction of HI lines lying in the circum-galactic medium (CGM)\nof relatively bright Lyman-break galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes with\n$\\langle M\\rangle \\sim10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. The comparison of our results with\nthe output of a grid of photoionization models and of two cosmological\nsimulations implies that the volume filling factor of the IGM gas enriched to a\nmetallicity $\\log Z/Z_{\\odot} \\ge -3$ should be of the order of $\\sim 10-13$\npercent. In conclusion, our results favour a scenario in which metals are found\nalso outside the CGM of bright star-forming galaxies, possibly due to pollution\nby lower mass objects and/or to an early enrichment by the first sources.\n", "  The growth of several biological tissues is known to be controlled in part by\nlocal geometrical features, such as the curvature of the tissue interface. This\ncontrol leads to changes in tissue shape that in turn can affect the tissue's\nevolution. Understanding the cellular basis of this control is highly\nsignificant for bioscaffold tissue engineering, the evolution of bone\nmicroarchitecture, wound healing, and tumour growth. While previous models have\nproposed geometrical relationships between tissue growth and curvature, the\nrole of cell density and cell vigor remains poorly understood. We propose a\ncell-based mathematical model of tissue growth to investigate the systematic\ninfluence of curvature on the collective crowding or spreading of\ntissue-synthesising cells induced by changes in local tissue surface area\nduring the motion of the interface. Depending on the strength of diffusive\ndamping, the model exhibits complex growth patterns such as undulating motion,\nefficient smoothing of irregularities, and the generation of cusps. We compare\nthis model with in-vitro experiments of tissue deposition in bioscaffolds of\ndifferent geometries. By accounting for the depletion of active cells, the\nmodel is able to capture both smoothing of initial substrate geometry and\ntissue deposition slowdown as observed experimentally.\n", "  We give the most general conditions to date which lead to uniqueness of the\ngeneral relativistic Hamiltonian. Namely, we show that all spatially covariant\ngeneralizations of the scalar constraint which extend the standard one while\nremaining quadratic in the momenta are second class. Unlike previous\ninvestigations along these lines, we do not require a specific Poisson bracket\nalgebra, and the quadratic dependence on the momenta is completely general,\nwith an arbitrary local operator as the kinetic term.\n", "  Historically, infectious diseases caused considerable damage to human\nsocieties, and they continue to do so today. To help reduce their impact,\nmathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help\nunderstand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination - one\nof the most important preventive measures of modern times - is of great\ninterest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional\napproaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of\nindividual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our\nreport reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis\non vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing\n(mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that\naccount for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure.\nMany of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and\nnetwork models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the\nfeedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a\ncoupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new\nparadigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as\nonline social media are mined for high-resolution information on\nepidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and\nconcepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital\ndata, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease\ndynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help\nimprove health outcomes. We conclude the review by discussing open problems in\nthe field and promising directions for future research.\n", "  We show that Schwarzschild black hole solutions in asymptotically Anti-de\nSitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) spaces may, up to a conformal factor, be\nreproduced in the framework of analogue gravity. The aforementioned derivation\nis performed using relativistic and non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensates.\nIn addition, we demonstrate that the (2+1) planar AdS black hole can be mapped\ninto the non-relativistic acoustic metric. Given that AdS black holes are\nextensively employed in the gauge/gravity duality, we then comment on the\npossibility to study the AdS/CFT correspondence and gravity/fluid duality from\nan analogue gravity perspective.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations of a quasi-harmonic solid are conducted to\nelucidate the meaning of temperature fluctuations in canonical systems and\nvalidate a well-known but frequently contested equation predicting the mean\nsquare of such fluctuations. The simulations implement two virtual and one\nphysical (natural) thermostat and examine the kinetic, potential and total\nenergy correlation functions in the time and frequency domains. The results\nclearly demonstrate the existence of quasi-equilibrium states in which the\nsystem can be characterized by a well-defined temperature that follows the\nmentioned fluctuation equation. The emergence of such states is due to the wide\nseparation of timescales between thermal relaxation by phonon scattering and\nslow energy exchanges with the thermostat. The quasi-equilibrium states exist\nbetween these two timescales when the system behaves as virtually isolated and\nequilibrium.\n", "  We report a search for a dark vector gauge boson $U^\\prime$ that couples to\nquarks in the decay chain $D^{*+} \\to D^0 \\pi^+, D^0 \\to K^0_S \\eta, \\eta \\to\nU^\\prime \\gamma$, $U^\\prime \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$. No signal is found and we set a\nmass-dependent limit on the baryonic fine structure constant of $10^{-3} -\n10^{-2}$ in the $U^\\prime$ mass range of 290 to 520 MeV/$c^2$. This analysis is\nbased on a data sample of 976 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the Belle experiment at\nthe KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider.\n", "  Understanding the nature of dark energy, the mysterious force driving the\naccelerated expansion of the Universe, is a major challenge of modern\ncosmology. The next generation of cosmological surveys, specifically designed\nto address this issue, rely on accurate measurements of the apparent shapes of\ndistant galaxies. However, shape measurement methods suffer from various\nunavoidable biases and therefore will rely on a precise calibration to meet the\naccuracy requirements of the science analysis. This calibration process remains\nan open challenge as it requires large sets of high quality galaxy images. To\nthis end, we study the application of deep conditional generative models in\ngenerating realistic galaxy images. In particular we consider variations on\nconditional variational autoencoder and introduce a new adversarial objective\nfor training of conditional generative networks. Our results suggest a reliable\nalternative to the acquisition of expensive high quality observations for\ngenerating the calibration data needed by the next generation of cosmological\nsurveys.\n", "  One of the remaining challenges within the standard model is to gain a good\nunderstanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime. A key step towards this\naim is baryon spectroscopy, investigating the spectrum and the properties of\nbaryon resonances. To gain access to resonances with small $\\pi N$ partial\nwidth, photoproduction experiments provide essential information. Partial wave\nanalyses need to be performed to extract the contributing resonances. Here, a\ncomplete experiment is required to unambiguously determine the contributing\namplitudes. This involves the measurement of carefully chosen single and double\npolarisation observables. In a joint endeavour by MAMI, ELSA, and Jefferson\nLaboratory, a new generation of experiments with polarised beams, polarised\nproton and neutron targets, and $4\\pi$ particle detectors have been performed\nin recent years. Many results of unprecedented quality were recently published\nby all three experiments, and included by the various partial wave analysis\ngroups in their analyses, leading to substantial improvements, e.g. a more\nprecise determination of resonance parameters. An overview of recent results is\ngiven, with an emphasis on results from the CBELSA/TAPS experiment, and their\nimpact on our understanding of the nucleon excitation spectrum is discussed.\n", "  Axelrod's model with $F=2$ cultural features, where each feature can assume\n$k$ states drawn from a Poisson distribution of parameter $q$, exhibits a\ncontinuous nonequilibrium phase transition in the square lattice. Here we use\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite size scaling to study the critical\nbehavior of the order parameter $\\rho$, which is the fraction of sites that\nbelong to the largest domain of an absorbing configuration averaged over many\nruns. We find that it vanishes as $\\rho \\sim \\left (q_c^0 - q \\right)^\\beta$\nwith $\\beta \\approx 0.25$ at the critical point $q_c^0 \\approx 3.10$ and that\nthe exponent that measures the width of the critical region is $\\nu^0 \\approx\n2.1$. In addition, we find that introduction of long-range links by rewiring\nthe nearest-neighbors links of the square lattice with probability $p$ turns\nthe transition discontinuous, with the critical point $q_c^p$ increasing from\n$3.1$ to $27.17$, approximately, as $p$ increases from $0$ to $1$. The\nsharpness of the threshold, as measured by the exponent $\\nu^p \\approx 1$ for\n$p>0$, increases with the square root of the number of nodes of the resulting\nsmall-world network.\n", "  We propose a noble physical model obtained from a Hamiltonian with periodic\npotential. This model is canonical, reversible and brings about chaotic\nsuperdiffusion with energy fluctuation divergence. The analytical formula of\ninvariant density can be obtained in some parameter range. In the range it is\nproved that the map is Anosov diffeomorphism and the invariant measure is a SRB\nmeasure. We calculate the analytical formula of Lyapunov exponent.\n", "  We derive the scattering length of composite bosons (cobosons) within the\nframework of the composite boson many-body formalism that uses correlated-pair\nstates as a basis, instead of free fermion states. The integral equation\nconstructed from this physically relevant basis makes transparent the role of\nfermion exchange in the coboson-coboson effective scattering. Three potentials\nused for Cooper pairs, fermionic-atom dimers, and semiconductor excitons are\nconsidered. While the s-wave scattering length for the BCS-like potential is\njust equal to its Born value, the other two are substantially smaller. For\nfermionic-atom dimers and semiconductor excitons, our results, calculated\nwithin a restricted correlated-pair basis, are in good agreement with those\nobtained from procedures numerically more demanding. We also propose model\ncoboson-coboson scatterings that are separable and thus easily workable, and\nthat produce scattering lengths which match quantitatively well with the\nnumerically-obtained values for all fermion mass ratios. These separable model\nscatterings can facilitate future works on many-body effects in coboson gases.\n", "  DyB4 has a two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland (Sh-S) lattice with strong\nIsing character of the Dy ions. Despite the intrinsic frustrations,\nsurprisingly, it undergoes two successive transitions: a magnetic ordering at\nTN = 20K, and a quadrupole ordering at TQ=12.5 K. From high-resolution neutron\nand synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction studies, we have obtained full\nstructural information on this material in all phases, and demonstrate that\nstructural modifications occurring at quadrupolar transition lead to the\nlifting of frustrations inherent in the Sh-S model. Our study thus provides a\ncomplete experimental picture of how the intrinsic frustration of the Sh-S\nlattice can be lifted by the coupling to quadrupole moments. We show that two\nother factors, i.e. strong spin-orbit coupling and long-range RKKY interaction\nin metallic DyB4, play an important role in this behavior.\n", "  Thin epitaxial films of Tb metal were grown on a clean W(110) substrate in\nultra-high vacuum and studied in-situ by low-energy electron microscopy.\nAnnealed films present magnetic contrast in spin-polarized low-energy electron\nmicroscopy. The energy dependence of the electron reflectivity was determined\nand a maximum value of its spin asymmetry of about 1\\% was measured. The\nmagnetization direction of the Tb films is in-plane. Upon raising the\ntemperature, no change in the domain distribution is observed, while the\nasymmetry in the electron reflectivity decreases when approaching the critical\ntemperature, following a power law $ \\sim (1 - T/T_C)^\\beta$ with a critical\nexponent $\\beta$ of 0.39.\n", "  It has recently been claimed by De Zela that Gleason's theorem, for\nprobability measures on the lattice of projection operators, can be extended to\nqubits by adding assumptions related to continuity and the existence of\n'eigenstates'. This amounts to a claim of the derivation of Born's rule for\nHermitian qubit observables. I point out a simple counterexample, and the flaw\nin De Zela's derivation (these are equally applicable to the repetition of the\nderivation given in a recent Reply). I also briefly discuss a valid extension\nto qubits given by Busch.\n", "  Background: The breakout from the hot Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxigen (CNO) cycles can\ntrigger the rp-process in type I x-ray bursts. In this environment, a\ncompetition between $^{15}\\text{O}(\\alpha,\\gamma){^{19}\\text{Ne}}$ and the\ntwo-proton capture reaction $^{15}\\text{O}(2p,\\gamma){^{17}\\text{Ne}}$ is\nexpected.\n  Purpose: Determine the three-body radiative capture reaction rate for\n${^{17}\\text{Ne}}$ formation including sequential and direct, resonant and\nnon-resonant contributions on an equal footing.\n  Method: Two different discretization methods have been applied to generate\n$^{17}$Ne states in a full three-body model: the analytical transformed\nharmonic oscillator method and the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method.\nThe binary $p$--$^{15}$O interaction has been adjusted to reproduce the known\nspectrum of the unbound $^{16}$F nucleus. The dominant $E1$ contributions to\nthe $^{15}\\text{O}(2p,\\gamma){^{17}\\text{Ne}}$ reaction rate have been\ncalculated from the inverse photodissociation process.\n  Results: Three-body calculations provide a reliable description of $^{17}$Ne\nstates. The agreement with the available experimental data on $^{17}$Ne is\ndiscussed. It is shown that the $^{15}\\text{O}(2p,\\gamma){^{17}\\text{Ne}}$\nreaction rates computed within the two methods agree in a broad range of\ntemperatures. The present calculations are compared with a previous theoretical\nestimation of the reaction rate.\n  Conclusions: It is found that the full three-body model provides a reaction\nrate several orders of magnitude larger than the only previous estimation. The\nimplications for the rp-process in type I x-ray bursts should be investigated.\n", "  Belitz-Kirkpatrick-Vojta (BKV) theory shows in excellent agreement with\nexperiment that ferromagnetic quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in clean metals\nare generally first-order due to the coupling of the magnetization to\nelectronic soft modes, in contrast to the classical analogue that is an\narchetypical second-order phase transition. For disordered metals BKV theory\npredicts that the second order nature of the QPT is restored because the\nelectronic soft modes change their nature from ballistic to diffusive. Our\nlow-temperature magnetization study identifies the ferromagnetic QPT in the\ndisordered metal UCo$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge as the first clear example that exhibits\nthe associated critical exponents predicted by BKV theory.\n", "  We test a general method to detect lower bounds of the quantum channel\ncapacity for two-qubit correlated channels. We consider in particular\ncorrelated dephasing, depolarising and amplitude damping channels. We show that\nthe method is easily implementable, it does not require a priori knowledge\nabout the channels, and it is very efficient, since it does not rely on full\nquantum process tomography.\n", "  In this article we first review the past decade of efforts in detecting the\nmissing baryons in the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) and summarize the\ncurrent state of the art by updating the baryon census and physical state of\nthe detected baryons in the local Universe. We then describe observational\nstrategies that should enable a significant step forward in the next decade,\nwhile waiting for the step-up in quality offered by future missions. In\nparticular we design a multi-mega-second and multiple cycle XMM-Newton legacy\nprogram (which we name the Ultimate Roaming Baryon Exploration, or URBE) aimed\nto secure detections of the peaks in the density distribution of the Universe\nmissing baryons over their entire predicted range of temperatures.\n", "  We propose a variational wavefunction containing parameters to tune the\nprobabilities of all the possible onsite configurations for the periodic\nAnderson model. We call it the full onsite-correlation wavefunction (FOWF).\nThis is a simple extension of the Gutzwiller wavefunction (GWF), in which one\nparameter is included to tune the double occupancy of the f electrons at the\nsame site. We compare the energy of the GWF and the FOWF evaluated by the\nvariational Monte Carlo method and that obtained with the density-matrix\nrenormalization group method. We find that the energy is considerably improved\nin the FOWF. On the other hand, the physical quantities do not change\nsignificantly between these two wavefunctions as long as they describe the same\nphase, such as the paramagnetic phase. From these results, we not only\ndemonstrate the improvement by the FOWF, but we also gain insights on the\napplicability and limitation of the GWF to the periodic Anderson model.\n", "  We show that the Virasoro Gibbs state accurately describes the thermodynamics\nof BTZ black holes at large temperatures and in the strong-coupling regime\n$c<1$. We first give a simple heuristic argument by showing that at high\ntemperatures and arbitrary $c$, the energies are much larger than Planck mass.\nThen we give a detailed analysis of the quantum fluctuations of the Gibbs state\non unitary irreducible representations of Virasoro group and explicitly show\nthat they go to zero in the high-temperature limit by means of representation\ntheory results. This implies the state has a sensible thermodynamic limit which\nactually holds for any $c$. Finally, the matching with BTZ thermodynamics for\n$c<1$ is obtained by using the known asymptotic behaviour of the characters of\nthe Virasoro discrete series. This result supports the idea that minimal models\ncould describe quantum gravity at strong coupling. We make no use of the\nEuclidean path integral nor assume modular invariance of the partition\nfunctions, although we comment on them along the way.\n", "  We study a model of an ionic conductor having interstitial ions that jump\nfrom site to site. The conductor is subject to an external electric field.\nAccording to classical mechanics, the ion number density follows the Boltzmann\ndistribution. But according to quantum mechanics, we show that the Boltzmann\ndistribution is violated by a factor of 2. And the violation provides a\nmechanism to explain the Haven ratio observed in some experiments.\n", "  In a recent paper, Ooguri and Vafa [arXiv:1610.04564] argued that a mild\nextension of the Weak Gravity conjecture\\cite{weakgrav} led to the conclusion\nthat the only models of quantum gravity in AdS space with \"radius large\ncompared to the string scale\" were models with exact AdS-SUSY. This note\nclarifies certain obscure parts of their argument by reinterpreting it as a\nstatement about brane configurations in flat space. In that context the\nstatement is that stable non-supersymmetric configurations of branes are\ncharacterized by charges in the torsion subgroup of K-theory and their only\nlong range fields are gravitational and scalar. The field equations do not have\nlarge radius near horizon AdS solutions. Instead the horizons are Schwarzschild\nblack branes. This leads us to conjecture that for $d \\leq 11$ the K theory\ncharges are bounded by a small integer, and there can be no large gravitational\nback reaction in the near horizon limit, for stable configurations. Unbounded\nvalues of these discrete charges would violate the Covariant Entropy Bound. We\ndiscuss a counterexample to the conjecture in $AdS_3$. We find similar\ncounterexamples in higher dimensional AdS spaces, but argue that none of them\nlead to SUSY violating models of quantum gravity in Minkowski space.\n", "  The final step of the water formation network on interstellar grain surfaces\nstarting from the H + O$_2$ route is the reaction between H and H$_2$O$_2$.\nThis reaction is known to have a high activation energy and therefore at low\ntemperatures it can only proceed via tunneling. To date, however, no rate\nconstants are available at temperatures below 200 K. In this work, we use\ninstanton theory to compute rate constants for the title reaction with and\nwithout isotopic substitutions down to temperatures of 50 K. The calculations\nare based on density functional theory, with additional benchmarks for the\nactivation energy using unrestricted single-reference and multireference\ncoupled-cluster single-point energies. Gas-phase bimolecular rate constants are\ncalculated and compared with available experimental data not only for H +\nH$_2$O$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ H$_2$O + OH, but also for H + H$_2$O$_2$ $\\rightarrow$\nH$_2$ + HO$_2$. We find a branching ratio where the title reaction is favored\nby at least two orders of magnitude at 114 K. In the interstellar medium this\nreaction predominantly occurs on water surfaces, which increases the\nprobability that the two reactants meet. To mimic this one, two, or three\nspectator H2O molecules are added to the system. Eley-Rideal bimolecular and\nLangmuir-Hinshelwood unimolecular rate constants are presented here. The\nkinetic isotope effects for the various cases are compared to experimental data\nas well as to expressions commonly used in astrochemical models. Both the\nrectangular barrier and the Eckart approximations lead to errors of about an\norder of magnitude. Finally, fits of the rate constants are provided as input\nfor astrochemical models.\n", "  Plant electrical signals often contains low frequency drifts with or without\nthe application of external stimuli. Quantification of the randomness in plant\nsignals in a stimulus-specific way is hindered because the knowledge of vital\nfrequency information in the actual biological response is not known yet. Here\nwe design an optimum Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter which removes the\nlow frequency drifts and preserves the frequency spectrum corresponding to the\nrandom component of the unstimulated plant signals by bringing the bias due to\nunknown artifacts and drifts to a minimum. We use energy criteria of wavelet\npacket transform (WPT) for optimization based tuning of the IIR filter\nparameters. Such an optimum filter enforces that the energy distribution of the\npre-stimulus parts in different experiments are almost overlapped but under\ndifferent stimuli the distributions of the energy get changed. The reported\nresearch may popularize plant signal processing, as a separate field, besides\nother conventional bioelectrical signal processing paradigms.\n", "  This paper investigates the operation of a hybrid power system through a\nnovel fuzzy control scheme. The hybrid power system employs various autonomous\ngeneration systems like wind turbine, solar photovoltaic, diesel engine,\nfuel-cell, aqua electrolyzer etc. Other energy storage devices like the\nbattery, flywheel and ultra-capacitor are also present in the network. A novel\nfractional order (FO) fuzzy control scheme is employed and its parameters are\ntuned with a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm augmented with two\nchaotic maps for achieving an improved performance. This FO fuzzy controller\nshows better performance over the classical PID, and the integer order fuzzy\nPID controller in both linear and nonlinear operating regimes. The FO fuzzy\ncontroller also shows stronger robustness properties against system parameter\nvariation and rate constraint nonlinearity, than that with the other controller\nstructures. The robustness is a highly desirable property in such a scenario\nsince many components of the hybrid power system may be switched on/off or may\nrun at lower/higher power output, at different time instants.\n", "  We reexamine the dynamical evolution of the mass and luminosity functions of\nglobular star clusters (GCMF and GCLF). Fall & Zhang (2001, hereafter FZ01)\nshowed that a power-law MF, as commonly seen among young cluster systems, would\nevolve by dynamical processes over a Hubble time into a peaked MF with a shape\nvery similar to the observed GCMF in the Milky Way and other galaxies. To\nsimplify the calculations, the semi-analytical FZ01 model adopted the\n\"classical\" theory of stellar escape from clusters, and neglected variations in\nthe $M/L$ ratios of clusters. Kruijssen & Portegies Zwart (2009, hereafter\nKPZ09) modified the FZ01 model to include \"retarded\" and mass-dependent stellar\nescape, the latter causing significant $M/L$ variations. KPZ09 asserted that\ntheir model was compatible with observations whereas the FZ01 model was not. We\nshow here that this claim is not correct; the FZ01 and KPZ09 models fit the\nobserved Galactic GCLF equally well. We also show that there is no detectable\ncorrelation between $M/L$ and $L$ for GCs in the Milky Way and Andromeda\ngalaxies, in contradiction with the KPZ09 model. Our comparisons of the FZ01\nand KPZ09 models with observations can be explained most simply if stars escape\nat rates approaching the classical limit for high-mass clusters, as expected on\ntheoretical grounds.\n", "  In this paper, an efficient control strategy for physiological interaction\nbased anaesthetic drug infusion model is explored using the fractional order\n(FO) proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. The dynamic model is\ncomposed of several human organs by considering the brain response to the\nanaesthetic drug as output and the drug infusion rate as the control input.\nParticle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is employed to obtain the optimal set of\nparameters for PID/FOPID controller structures. With the proposed FOPID control\nscheme much less amount of drug-infusion system can be designed to attain a\nspecific anaesthetic target and also shows high robustness for +/-50%\nparametric uncertainty in the patient's brain model.\n", "  We report the observation of cluster (local) superconductivity in the\nmagnetoelectric Pb(Fe1/2Sb1/2)O3 ceramics prepared at a hydrostatic pressure of\n6 GPa and temperatures 1200-1800 K to stabilize the perovskite phase. The\nsuperconductivity is manifested by an abrupt drop of the magnetic\nsusceptibility at the critical temperature TC 7 K. Both the magnitude of this\ndrop and TC decrease with magnetic field increase. Similarly, the low-field\nparamagnetic absorption measured by EPR spectrometer drops significantly below\nTC as well. The observed effects and their critical magnetic field dependence\nare interpreted as manifestation of the superconductivity and Meissner effect\nin metallic Pb nanoclusters existing in the ceramics. Their volume fraction and\naverage size were estimated as 0.1-0.2% and 140-150 nm, respectively. The\nsuperconductivity related effects disappear after oxidizing annealing of the\nceramics.\n", "  In this paper, we review a few known facts on the coordinate Bethe ansatz. We\npresent a detailed construction of the Bethe ansatz vector $\\psi$ and energy\n$\\Lambda$, which satisfy $V \\psi = \\Lambda \\psi$, where $V$ is the the transfer\nmatrix of the six-vertex model on a finite square lattice with periodic\nboundary conditions for weights $a= b=1$ and $c > 0$. We also show that the\nsame vector $\\psi$ satisfies $H \\psi = E \\psi$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian of\nthe XXZ model (which is the model for which the Bethe ansatz was first\ndeveloped), with a value $E$ computed explicitly.\n  Variants of this approach have become central techniques for the study of\nexactly solvable statistical mechanics models in both the physics and\nmathematics communities. Our aim in this paper is to provide a\npedagogically-minded exposition of this construction, aimed at a mathematical\naudience. It also provides the opportunity to introduce the notation and\nframework which will be used in a subsequent paper by the authors that amounts\nto proving that the random cluster model on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with cluster weight\n$q >4$ exhibits a first-order phase transition.\n", "  Combining topology and plasmonics paradigms in nanocolloidal systems may\nenable new means of pre-engineering desired composite material properties. Here\nwe design and realize orientationally ordered assemblies of noble metal\nnanoparticles with genus-one topology and unusual long-range ordering mediated\nby their interactions with the surrounding nematic fluid host. Facile electric\nswitching of these composites is reminiscent to that of pristine liquid\ncrystals (LCs), but provides a means of reconfiguring the nanoparticle assembly\nand thus also the ensuing composite medium's optical properties. Our findings\nmay lead to formation of new molecular-colloidal soft matter phases with\nunusual optical properties as well as optical metamaterials.\n", "  The hydrogen and helium accreted by X-ray bursting neutron stars is\nperiodically consumed in runaway thermonuclear reactions that cause the entire\nsurface to glow brightly in X-rays for a few seconds. With models of the\nemission, the mass and radius of the neutron star can be inferred from the\nobservations. By simultaneously probing neutron star masses and radii, X-ray\nbursts are one of the strongest diagnostics of the nature of matter at\nextremely high densities. Accurate determinations of these parameters are\ndifficult, however, due to the highly non-ideal nature of the atmospheres where\nX-ray bursts occur. Observations from X-ray telescopes such as RXTE and NuStar\ncan potentially place strong constraints on nuclear matter once uncertainties\nin atmosphere models have been reduced. Here we discuss current progress on\nmodeling atmospheres of X-ray bursting neutron stars and some of the challenges\nstill to be overcome.\n", "  The gas in galaxies is both the fuel for star formation and a medium that\nattenuates the light of the young stars. We study the relations between UV\nattenuation, spectral slope, star formation rates, and molecular gas surface\ndensities in a sample of 28 z$\\sim$1 and a reference sample of 32 z$\\sim$0\ngalaxies that are detected in CO, far-infrared, and rest frame UV. The samples\nare dominated by disc-like galaxies close to the main SFR--mass relation. We\nfind that the location of the z$\\sim$1 galaxies on the IRX-$\\beta$ plane is\ncorrelated with their gas-depletion time-scale $\\tau_{dep}$ and can predict\n$\\tau_{dep}$ with a standard deviation of 0.16 dex. We use IRX-$\\beta$ to\nestimate the mean total gas column densities at the locations of star formation\nin the galaxies, and compare them to the mean molecular gas surface densities\nas measured from CO. We confirm previous results regarding high $N_H/A_V$ in\nz$\\sim$1 galaxies. We estimate an increase in the gas filling factor by a\nfactor of 4--6 from z$\\sim$0 to z$\\sim$1 and a corresponding increase of factor\n3--2 in the mean column densities of the star forming clouds. After accounting\nfor the filling factor, the z$\\sim$1 and the z$\\sim$0 samples exhibit similar\nattenuation properties. These indicate to similar porous geometries to the\nmolecular clouds in star-forming disc galaxies at 0<z<1.\n", "  In recent years, impressive advances in harvesting renewable energy have led\nto pressing demand for the complimentary energy storage technology. Here, a\nhigh coulombic efficiency (~ 99.7%) Al battery is developed using\nearth-abundant aluminum as the anode, graphite as the cathode, and a cheap\nionic liquid analogue electrolyte made from a mixture of AlCl3 and urea in 1.3\n: 1 molar ratio. The battery displays discharge voltage plateaus around 1.9 V\nand 1.5 V (average discharge = 1.73 V) and yielded a specific cathode capacity\nof ~73 mAh g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 (~ 1.4 C). High coulombic\nefficiency over a range of charge-discharge rates and stability over ~150-200\ncycles was easily demonstrated. In-situ Raman spectroscopy clearly showed\nchloroaluminate anion intercalation/deintercalation of graphite in the cathode\nside during charge/discharge and suggested the formation of a stage 2 graphite\nintercalation compound when fully charged. Raman spectroscopy and nuclear\nmagnetic resonance suggested the existence of AlCl4-, Al2Cl7- anions, and\n[AlCl2. (urea)n]+ cations in the urea/AlCl3 electrolyte when an excess of AlCl3\nwas present. Aluminum deposition therefore proceeded through two pathways, one\ninvolving Al2Cl7- anions and the other involving [AlCl2.(urea)n]+ cations. This\nbattery is a promising prospect for a future high performance, low cost energy\nstorage device.\n", "  We review the studies on the scaling of the minimal step-step distance lmin\nin the bunch with the bunch size N, l_min~N^(-{\\gamma}). We build our\nretrospective around the different values of the exponent {\\gamma} obtained\nfrom models and experiments. It was mainly studied in the context of the\nelectromigration driven instability on Si(111) vicinal surfaces. In this\ncontext the full scaling relation is given in general form as l_min ~\n(A/l_cFN^2)^[1/(n+1)], where A is the magnitude of the step-step repulsions\nwith range n, F is the electromigration force acting on the charged surface\natoms and l_c is a length-scale, characteristic for the regime of step\nbunching, diffusion-limited (DL) or attachment-detachment limited (KL).\n", "  We study the optical conductivity of 1+1 dimensional systems using soft wall\nmodel in the bottom up approach of AdS/CFT (anti-de Sitter/conformal field\ntheory) duality. We find the numerical results for optical conductivity and\ninvestigate the system using holographic model in the probe limit. The\ndependence of conductivity on chemical potential is also investigated. Further,\nwe extend the soft wall model as a `no-wall' model by eliminating the dilaton\nbackground and study the response of the system in a simplified approach.\n", "  The material properties selection for designing acoustic filters with optimal\nperformance over a range of frequencies requires considerable effort to\nfabricate and test laboratory samples. To simplify this procedure, one may test\na single sample at various temperatures to design an acoustic filter for a\ndesired band-width. The essential idea is to fabricate a single layered\nperiodic elastic composite with constituent materials that have\ntemperature-dependent properties. As temperature is changed, such a composite\nexhibits a band structure that changes with the change in temperature. Once a\ndesired band structure is attained and the corresponding constituent properties\nare identified, then new constituents that have those properties at the\nrequired temperature can be selected and new sample fabricated. We fabricated a\n2-phase composite with periodic layers of polyurea and steel. The temperature\nis changed from -20{\\deg}C to 60{\\deg}C and ultrasonic measurements are\nperformed on the sample over 0.15 to 2.2MHz at each temperature. The first\nthree pass bands are captured experimentally and significant change in the band\nstructure is observed over the test temperature range. Experimental\ntransmission spectrum at each temperature is compared with the theoretical band\nstructure and it is shown that good agreement exists for the observed variation\nin the band structure.\n", "  We study the discrete Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators $H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}$\non $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}^{d+1})$ with surface potential of the form\n$V(n,x)=\\lambda \\delta(x)\\tan\\pi(\\alpha\\cdot n+\\theta)$, and\n$H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}^{+}$ on $\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}^{d}\\times \\mathbb{Z}_+)$\nwith the boundary condition $ \\psi_{(n,-1)}=\\lambda \\tan\\pi(\\alpha\\cdot\nn+\\theta)\\psi_{(n,0)} $, where $\\alpha\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is rationally\nindependent. We show that the spectra of $H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}$ and\n$H_{\\lambda,\\alpha,\\theta}^{+}$ are $(-\\infty,\\infty)$ for all parameters. We\ncan also determine the absolutely continuous spectra and Hausdorff dimension of\nthe spectral measures if $d=1$.\n", "  A review of the recent results on measurements of top quark properties in\nsingle top quark events using data samples of proton proton collisions produced\nby the LHC at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV and collected by ATLAS and CMS detectors is\npresented, including the top quark polarization, the W boson helicity, searches\nfor anomalous Wtb couplings and the top quark mass. The measurements are in\ngood agreement with predictions and no deviations from Standard Model\nexpectations have been observed.\n", "  We present a Surface Evolver framework for simulating single bubbles and\nmulticellular foams trapped between curved parallel surfaces. We are able to\nexplore a range of geometries using level set constraints to model the bounding\nsurfaces. Unlike previous work, in which the bounding surfaces are flat (the so\ncalled Hele-Shaw geometry), we consider surfaces with non- vanishing Gaussian\ncurvature, specifically the sphere, the torus and the Schwarz\nPrimitive-surface. In the case of multi-cellular foams - our method is to first\ndistribute a set of N points evenly over the surface (using an en- ergy\nminimisation approach), these seed points are then used to generate a Voronoi\npartition, that is clipped to the confining space, which in turn forms the\nbasis of a Surface Evolver simulation. In addition we describe our ex-\nperimental attempt to generate a honeycomb on a negatively curved surface, by\ntrapping bees between two Schwarz Primitive-surfaces. Our aim is to understand\nhow bees adapt the usual hexagonal motif of the honeycomb to cope with a curved\nsurface. To our knowledge this is the first time that an attempt has been made\nto realise a biological cellular structure of this type.\n", "  In this paper, we firstly establish the multi-Hamiltonian structure and\ninfinite many conservation laws for the vector Kaup-Newell hierarchy of the\npositive and negative orders. The first nontrivial negative flow corresponds to\na coupled Fokas-Lenells equation. By constructing a generalized Darboux\ntransformation and using a limiting process, all kinds of one-soliton solutions\nare constructed including the bright-dark soliton, the dark-anti-dark soliton\nand the breather-like solutions. Furthermore, multi-bright and multi-dark\nsoliton solutions are derived and their asymptotic behaviors are investigated.\n", "  We report on progress on the free surface flow in the presence of submerged\noscillating line sources (2D) or point sources (3D) when a simple shear flow is\npresent varying linearly with depth. Such sources are in routine use as Green\nfunctions in the realm of potential theory for calculating wave-body\ninteractions, but no such theory exists in for rotational flow. We solve the\nlinearized problem in 2D and 3D from first principles, based on the Euler\nequations, when the sources are at rest relative to the undisturbed surface.\nBoth in 2D and 3D a new type of solution appears compared to irrotational case,\na critical layer-like flow whose surface manifestation (\"wave\") drifts\ndownstream from the source at the velocity of the flow at the source depth. We\nanalyse the additional vorticity in light of the vorticity equation and provide\na simple physical argument why a critical layer is a necessary consequence of\nKelvin's circulation theorem. In 3D a related critical layer phenomenon occurs\nat every depth, whereby a street of counter-rotating vortices in the horizontal\nplane drift downstream at the local flow velocity.\n", "  The right performance of a supply chain depends on the pattern of\nrelationships among firms. Although there is not a general consensus among\nresearchers yet, many studies point that scale-free topologies, where few\nhighly related firms are combined with many low-related firms, assure the\nhighest efficiency of a supply chain. This paper studies the network topology\nthat leads to the highest agility of the supply chain when sudden demand\nchanges occur. To do this, an agent-based model of a supply chain with\nrestricted relationship between agents is built. The model includes three\ntiers, where the flow of material is distributed from the bottom supplier to\nthe final customer passing necessarily through firms in every tier. Agility is\nmeasured in the model simulations through the order fulfillment rate. Unlike to\nprevious theoretical and lab results, the simulation of the model shows that\nthe highest levels of agility are not obtained with a scale-free topology.\nInstead, homogeneous distribution of links, such as those induced by regular or\nPoisson probability laws, shows higher agility values than heterogeneous\ndistributions. Other previous recommendations, such as redundancy or having\nmultiple suppliers, are confirmed by the simulations. The general conclusion is\nthat the most suitable network topology in terms of agility depends on the\nspecific conditions of the supply chain and the aspects of the performance to\nbe analyzed.\n", "  Quantum technologies hold the promise of not only faster algorithmic\nprocessing of data, via quantum computation, but also of more secure\ncommunications, in the form of quantum cryptography. In recent years, a number\nof protocols have emerged which seek to marry these concepts for the purpose of\nsecuring computation rather than communication. These protocols address the\ntask of securely delegating quantum computation to an untrusted device while\nmaintaining the privacy, and in some instances the integrity, of the\ncomputation. We present a review of the progress to date in this emerging area.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the implementation of leakage radiation microscopy\n(LRM) to probe the chirality of plasmonic nanostructures. We demonstrate\nexperimentally spin-driven directional coupling as well as vortex generation of\nsurface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) by nanostructures built with T-shaped and\n$\\Lambda$- shaped apertures. Using this far-field method, quantitative\ninspections, including directivity and extinction ratio measurements, are\nachieved via polarization analysis in both image and Fourier planes. To support\nour experimental findings, we develop an analytical model based on a\nmultidipolar representation of $\\Lambda$- and T-shaped aperture plasmonic\ncoupler allowing a theoretical explanation of both directionality and singular\nSPP formation. Furthermore, the roles of symmetry breaking and phases are\nemphasized in this work. This quantitative characterization of spin-orbit\ninteractions paves the way for developing new directional couplers for\nsubwavelength routing.\n", "  A method for solving a quasilinear nonelliptical equation of the second order\nis developed and we give classification and parametrization of simple elements\nof the equation.We find exact solutions of an equation for potential stationary\nflow of a compressible gas in a supersonic region as an example of the method.\n", "  In stellar interiors shear flows play an important role in many physical\nprocesses. So far helioseismology provides only large-scale measurements, and\nso the small-scale dynamics remains insufficiently understood. To draw a\nconnection between observations and three-dimensional DNS of shear driven\nturbulence, we investigate horizontally averaged profiles of the numerically\nobtained mean state. We focus here on just one of the possible methods that can\nmaintain a shear flow, namely the average relaxation method. We show that\nalthough some systems saturate by restoring linear marginal stability this is\nnot a general trend. Finally, we discuss the reason that the results are more\ncomplex than expected.\n", "  A challenge in precision measurement with squeezed spin state arises from the\nspin dephasing due to stray magnetic fields. To suppress such environmental\nnoises, we employ a continuous driving protocol, rotary echo, to enhance the\nspin coherence of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in stray magnetic fields.\nOur analytical and numerical results show that the coherent and the squeezed\nspin states are preserved for a significantly long time, compared to the free\ninduction decay time, if the condition $h\\tau = m\\pi$ is met with $h$ the pulse\namplitude and $\\tau$ pulse width. In particular, both the spin average and the\nspin squeezing, including the direction and the amplitude, are simultaneously\nfixed for a squeezed spin state. Our results point out a practical way to\nimplement quantum measurements based on a spin-1 condensate beyond the standard\nquantum limit.\n", "  I review recent progress in the computation of processes involving top quarks\nin the framework of Standard Model Effective Theory at NLO in QCD. In\nparticular I discuss the impact of higher-dimensional operators on top pair\nproduction in association with a photon, a Z boson and a Higgs. Results are\nobtained within the automated framework of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.\n", "  In this study, capillary-driven flow of different pure liquids and diluted\nbitumen samples were studied using microfluidic channel (width of 30 um and\ndepth of 9 um). Capillary filling kinetics of liquids as a function of time\nwere evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions. For pure liquids\nincluding water, toluene, hexane, and methanol experimental results agreed well\nwith theoretical predictions. However, for bitumen samples, as concentration of\nbitumen increased the deviation between theoretical and experimental results\nbecame larger. The higher deviation for high concentrations (i.e. above 30%)\ncan be due to the difference between dynamic contact angle and bulk contact\nangle. Microchannels are suitable experimental devices to study the flow of\nheavy oil and bitumen in porous structure such as those of reservoirs.\n", "  The complex Langevin method (CLM) provides a promising way to perform the\npath integral with a complex action using a stochastic equation for\ncomplexified dynamical variables. It is known, however, that the method gives\nwrong results in some cases, while it works, for instance, in finite density\nQCD in the deconfinement phase or in the heavy dense limit. Here we revisit the\nargument for justification of the CLM and point out a subtlety in using the\ntime-evolved observables, which play a crucial role in the argument. This\nsubtlety requires that the probability distribution of the drift term should\nfall off exponentially or faster at large magnitude. We demonstrate our claim\nin some examples such as chiral Random Matrix Theory and show that our\ncriterion is indeed useful in judging whether the results obtained by the CLM\nare trustable or not.\n", "  An exact solution of a forced Burgers' equation representing the dynamics of\na \"dust fluid\" in a one-dimensional flow is presented. The test case considered\nstarts with a steady (time independent) two-fluid flow in one dimension, where\nthe two fluid components represent gas and dust. It is then assumed that a\nshock wave travels through the gas at a constant speed and without radiative\nenergy losses and diffusion. Then, adopting a constant stopping time for the\ndust particles in the dust fluid (mono-dispersed grain sizes), the equation of\nmotion for the dust fluid can be transformed into a simple ordinary\ndifferential equation, which is satisfied by the Wright omega function.\nImplications for the formation of detached shells around carbon stars are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  The electromagnetic shift of energy levels of H-atom electrons is determined\nby calculating an electron coupling to the Gibbons-Hawking electromagnetic\nfield thermal bath. Energy shift of electrons in H-atom is determined in the\nframework of the non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  Statistical analysis of Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) maps of the\nintracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters provides a unique tool to evaluate\nsome spatial features of the magnetic fields there. Its combination with\nnumerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence allows the\ndiagnosis of the ICM turbulence. Being the ICM plasma weakly collisional, the\nthermal velocity distribution of the particles naturally develops anisotropies\nas a consequence of the large scale motions and the conservation of the\nmagnetic moment of the charged particles. A previous study (Paper I) analyzed\nthe impact of large scale thermal anisotropy on the statistics of RM maps\nsynthesized from simulations of turbulence; these simulations employed a\ncollisionless MHD model which considered a tensor pressure with uniform\nanisotropy. In the present work, we extend that analysis to a collisionless MHD\nmodel in which the thermal anisotropy develops according to the conservation of\nthe magnetic moment of the thermal particles. We also consider the effect of\nanisotropy relaxation caused by the micro-scale mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. We show that if the relaxation rate is fast enough to keep the\nanisotropy limited by the threshold values of the instabilities, the dispersion\nand power spectrum of the RM maps are indistinguishable from those obtained\nfrom collisional MHD. Otherwise, there is a reduction in the dispersion and\nsteepening of the power spectrum of the RM maps (compared to the collisional\ncase). Considering the first scenario, the use of collisional MHD simulations\nfor modeling the RM statistics in the ICM becomes better justified.\n", "  The kinematic and dynamical properties of galaxy stellar halos are difficult\nto measure because of the faint surface brightness that characterizes these\nregions. Spiral galaxies can be probed using the radio HI emission; on the\ncontrary, early-type galaxies contain less gas, therefore alternative kinematic\ntracers need to be used. Planetary nebulae (PNe) can be easily detected far out\nin the halo thanks to their bright emission lines. It is therefore possible to\nmap the halo kinematics also in early-type galaxies, typically out to 5\neffective radii or beyond. Thanks to the recent spectroscopic surveys targeting\nextra-galactic PNe, we can now rely on a few tens of galaxies where the\nkinematics of the stellar halos are measured. Here, I will review the main\nresults obtained in this field in the last decades.\n", "  We analytically study the role of nonconservative forces, namely viscous\ncouplings, on the statistical properties of the energy flux between two\nBrownian particles kept at different temperatures. From the dynamical model\ndescribing the system, we identify an energy flow that satisfies a fluctuation\ntheorem both in the stationary and in transient states. In particular, for the\nspecific case of a linear nonconservative interaction, we derive an exact\nfluctuation theorem that holds for any measurement time in the transient\nregime, and which involves the energy flux alone. Moreover, in this regime the\nsystem presents an interesting asymmetry between the hot and cold particles.\nThe theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results\nalready presented in our previous article [B{\\'e}rut et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n116, 068301 (2016)], where we investigated the thermodynamic properties of two\nBrownian particles, trapped with optical tweezers, interacting through a\ndissipative hydrodynamic coupling.\n", "  Nuclear pasta, with nucleons arranged into tubes, sheets, or other complex\nshapes, is expected in core collapse supernovae (SNe) at just below nuclear\ndensity. We calculate the additional opacity from neutrino-pasta coherent\nscattering using molecular dynamics simulations. We approximately include this\nopacity in simulations of SNe. We find that pasta slows neutrino diffusion and\ngreatly increases the neutrino signal at late times of 10 or more seconds after\nstellar core collapse. This signal, for a galactic SN, should be clearly\nvisible in large detectors such as Super-Kamiokande.\n", "  In this paper, we examine theoretical and practical aspects of several\nversions of couple stress theory. This includes indeterminate\nMindlin-Tiersten-Koiter couple stress theory (MTK-CST), indeterminate symmetric\nmodified couple stress theory (M-CST) and determinate skew-symmetric consistent\ncouple stress theory (C-CST). We observe that MTK-CST and M-CST not only suffer\nfrom inconsistencies, these theories also cannot describe properly several\nelementary deformations, such as pure torsion of a circular bar and pure\nbending of a plate. By using an energy method, we also demonstrate another\naspect of the inconsistency of the indeterminate MTK-CST and M-CST for elastic\nsolids. This is achieved by deriving the governing equilibrium equations for\nelastic bodies in MTK-CST, M-CST and C-CST. This development shows that the\ndirect minimization of the total potential energy for MTK-CST and M-CST\nviolates the divergence free compatibility condition of the rotation vector\nfield. On the other hand, the direct minimization of the total potential energy\nfor C-CST satisfies this compatibility condition automatically. This result\ndemonstrates another aspect of the inner consistency of C-CST.\n", "  We study the $(3+1)$-dimensional eight-order nonlinear wave equation\nassociated with the principal representation of the exceptional affine Lie\nalgebra $E_6^{(1)}$, which was constructed by Kac and Wakimoto and stated that\n$N$-soliton solution of the equation can be formulated. We show that the\nequation is not Hirota integrable since it does not have three-soliton\nsolution, even it has one- and two-soliton solutions.\n", "  We demonstrate that GaN formed in a Nanowall Network (NwN) morphology can\novercome fundamental limitations in optoelectronic devices, and enable high\nlight extraction and effective Mg incorporation for efficient p-GaN. We report\nthe growth of Mg doped GaN Nanowall network (NwN) by plasma assisted molecular\nbeam epitaxy (PA-MBE) that is characterized by Photoluminescence (PL)\nspectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD),\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Secondary ion mass spectroscopy\n(SIMS). We record a photo-luminescence enhancement ($ \\approx $3.2 times) in\nlightly doped GaN as compared to that of undoped NwN. Two distinct (and broad)\nblue luminescence peaks appears at 2.95 and 2.7 eV for the heavily doped GaN\n(Mg $>10^{20}$ atoms $cm^{-3}$), of which the 2.95 eV peak is sensitive to\nannealing is observed. XPS and SIMS measurements estimate the incorporated Mg\nconcentration to be $10^{20}$ atoms $cm^{-3}$ in GaN NwN morphology, while\nretaining its band edge emission at $\\approx$ 3.4 eV. A higher Mg accumulation\ntowards the GaN/Al$_2$O$_3$ interface as compared to the surface was observed\nfrom SIMS measurements.\n", "  Phytoplankton are the foundation of aquatic food webs. Through\nphotosynthesis, phytoplankton draw down CO2 at magnitudes equivalent to forests\nand other terrestrial plants and convert it to organic material that is then\nconsumed by other organisms of phytoplankton in higher trophic levels.\nMechanisms that affect local concentrations and velocities are of primary\nsignificance to many encounter-based processes in the plankton including\nprey-predator interactions, fertilization and aggregate formation. We report\nresults from simulations of sinking phytoplankton, considered as elongated\nspheroids, in homogenous isotropic turbulence to answer the question of whether\ntrajectories and velocities of sinking phytoplankton are altered by turbulence.\nWe show in particular that settling spheroids with physical characteristics\nsimilar to those of diatoms weakly cluster and preferentially sample regions of\ndown-welling flow, corresponding to an increase of the mean settling speed with\nrespect to the mean settling speed in quiescent fluid. We explain how different\nparameters can affect the settling speed and what underlying mechanisms might\nbe involved. Interestingly, we observe that the increase in the aspect ratio of\nthe prolate spheroids can affect the clustering and the average settling speed\nof particles by two mechanisms: first is the effect of aspect ratio on the\nrotation rate of the particles, which saturates faster than the second\nmechanism of increasing drag anisotropy.\n", "  The interplay of such cornerstones of modern nonlinear fiber optics as a\nnonlinearity, stochasticity and polarization leads to variety of the noise\ninduced instabilities including polarization attraction and escape phenomena\nharnessing of which is a key to unlocking the fiber optic systems\nspecifications required in high resolution spectroscopy, metrology, biomedicine\nand telecommunications. Here, by using direct stochastic modeling, the mapping\nof interplay of the Raman scattering-based nonlinearity, the random\nbirefringence of a fiber, and the pump-to-signal intensity noise transfer has\nbeen done in terms of the fiber Raman amplifier parameters, namely polarization\nmode dispersion, the relative intensity noise of the pump laser, fiber length,\nand the signal power. The obtained results reveal conditions for emergence of\nthe random birefringence-induced resonance-like enhancement of the gain\nfluctuations (stochastic anti-resonance) accompanied by pulse broadening and\nrare events in the form of low power output signals having probability heavily\ndeviated from the Gaussian distribution.\n", "  Density functional theory is applied to study the mechanism of the\nStone-Wales defect formation in pure and nitrogen-doped dodecahedral C$_{20}$\nfullerenes. The molecular structures of initial and defected cages as well as\ntransition states dividing them are obtained. Depending on the number of\nnitrogen atoms and their relative position in the cage, Stone-Wales defect is\nformed through the single additional intermediate state or directly. The\nactivation energy barrier of the defect formation reduces from 4.93 eV in pure\nC$_{20}$ to 2.98 eV in single-doped C$_{19}$N, and reaches $\\sim$ 2 eV under\nfurther doping. All nitrogen-doped fullerenes considered possess high kinetic\nstability at room temperature. However, they become much less stable at\ntemperatures of about 750 K that are typical for the fullerene annealing\nprocess.\n", "  We analyse the properties of wave functions $\\psi(x,t;y,s)$ that depend at\nonce on two time-position vectors $(x,t)$ and $(y,s)$ with different time\nentries $t\\neq{s}$. In particular, we prove that the existence of such wave\nfunctions is indeed incompatible with the superposition property and the\ntechnique of separation of variables.\n", "  Geospace phenomena such as the aurora, plasma motion, ionospheric currents\nand associated magnetic field disturbances are highly organized by Earth's main\nmagnetic field. This is due to the fact that the charged particles that\ncomprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but\nnot across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena\nrelative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate\nsystems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the\nmagnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common\nmagnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are\nused, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on\nthe spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic\nReference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of\nthe Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most\ndetailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic\nlatitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These\ncoordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are\nnon-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such\ncoordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done\ncorrectly.\n", "  Forests are complex systems, and it is necessary to include this\ncharacteristic in every forest definition, in order to consider the restriction\nthat this imposes in terms of prediction and control. This lost of\npredictability and controllability should be incorporated in every\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment or management program. We present two\ncase-studies located in Mexico and one in the US to illustrate three relevant\nindicators of complexity. First, we introduce an informational framework to\nmeasure the Zoquiapan forest systemic complexity. Then, we analyze complexity\nchanges among different types of forest and management systems, related with\nspatial distributions, using data from a floristic study in the Montes Azules\nNational Park. Finally, we analyze time series of $CO_{2}$ fluctuations taken\nfrom AMERIFLUX data bases. Our results show firstly that it is possible to\nmeasure the systemic complexity of different forests, characteized by a\ncriticality state (1/f noise) which has been proposed as a finger print of\ncomplexity. And secondly, that this characteristic can be used as a proxy of\ntheir state of conservation, where the lowest complexity values are found in\nperturbed areas showing the relevance of the concept and its measurement for\nforest conservation and management.\n", "  A simple and effective method for the junction termination design was\nsuggested. Optimization method uses lateral charge function F(x) which depends\nfrom two arguments and can be changed in wide range of shapes. To demonstrate\nmethod effectiveness, design and optimization example for the HV diode (1800 V)\nedge termination was shown. Achieved breakdown voltage is 93% of the\ncorresponding 1D structure breakdown voltage.\n", "  Structural disorder results in multiple scattering in real photonic crystals,\nwhich have been widely used for applications and studied for fundamental\ninterests. The interaction of light with such complex photonic media is\nexpected to show interplay between disorder and order. For a completely\ndisordered medium, the intensity statistics is well-known to obey Rayleigh\nstatistics with a negative exponential distribution function, corresponding to\nabsence of correlations. Intensity statistics is unexplored however for complex\nmedia with both order and disorder. We study experimentally the intensity\nstatistics of light reflected from photonic crystals with various degree of\ndisorder. We observe deviations from the Rayleigh distribution and the\ndeviations increase with increasing long-range order.\n", "  The possible time variation of dimensionless fundamental constants of nature,\nsuch as the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$, is a legitimate subject of\nphysical enquiry. By contrast, the time variation of dimensional constants,\nsuch as $\\hbar$, $c$, $G$, $e$, $k$,... which are merely human constructs whose\nnumber and values differ from one choice of units to the next, has no\noperational meaning. To illustrate this, we refute a recent claim of Davies et\nal that black holes can discriminate between two contending theories of varying\n$\\alpha$, one with varying $c$ and the other with varying $e$. In Appendix A we\nrespond to criticisms by P. Davies and two Nature referees. In Appendix B we\nrespond to remarks by Magueijo and by T. Davis. In Appendix C we critique\nrecent claims by Copi, A. Davis and Krauss to have placed constraints on\n$\\Delta G/G$.} In Appendix D we provide extracts of a lecture by Dirac, of\nwhich we have only recently become aware, which includes the comment \"Talking\nabout whether a thing is constant or not does not have any absolute meaning\nunless that quantity is dimensionless\".\n"]}
