Analysis of obtained\nresults of experimental study from four different laboratories shows that\nrelative bias between the experimentally measured concentrations calculated in\naccordance with proposed method and the values of concentrations assigned\nduring the preparation by gravimetric method for all analyzed compounds does\nnot exceed 10 %. It is shown that relative response factors (RRF) between\nanalyzed volatile compounds and ethanol do not depend on time of analysis and\nare constant for every model of GC. It is shown the possibility to use\npredetermined RRF in daily practice of testing laboratories and to implement\nthis new method in the international standards of measurement procedure.\n"]}
