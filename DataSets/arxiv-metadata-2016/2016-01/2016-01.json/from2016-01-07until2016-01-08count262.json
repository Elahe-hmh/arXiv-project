energy asymptotics of periodic and random Laplace operators\non Cayley graphs of amenable, finitely generated groups. For the periodic\noperator the asymptotics is characterised by the van Hove exponent or zeroth\nNovikov-Shubin invariant. The random model we consider is given in terms of an\nadjacency Laplacian on site or edge percolation subgraphs of the Cayley graph.\nThe asymptotic behaviour of the spectral distribution is exponential,\ncharacterised by the Lifshitz exponent. We show that for the adjacency\nLaplacian the two invariants/exponents coincide. The result holds also for more\ngeneral symmetric transition operators. For combinatorial Laplacians one has a\ndifferent universal behaviour of the low energy asymptotics of the spectral\ndistribution function, which can be actually established on quasi-transitive\ngraphs without an amenability assumption. The latter result holds also for long\nrange bond percolation models.\n", "  We study homogeneous, independent percolation on general quasi-transitive\ngraphs. We prove that in the disorder regime where all clusters are finite\nalmost surely, in fact the expectation of the cluster size is finite. This\nextends a well-known theorem by Menshikov and Aizenman & Barsky to all\nquasi-transitive graphs. Moreover we deduce that in this disorder regime the\ncluster size distribution decays exponentially, extending a result of Aizenman\n& Newman. Our results apply to both edge and site percolation, as well as long\nrange (edge) percolation. The proof is based on a modification of the Aizenman\n& Barsky method.\n", "  Schematic su(2)+h3 interaction Hamiltonians, where su(2) plays the role of\nthe pseudo-spin algebra of fermion operators and h3 is the Heisenberg algebra\nfor bosons, are shown to be closely related to certain nonlinear models defined\non a single quantum algebra q-su(2) of quasifermions. In particular, q-su(2)\nanalogues of the Da Providencia-Schutte and extended Lipkin models are\npresented. The connection between q and the physical parameters of the\nfermion-boson system is analysed, and the integrability properties of the\ninteraction Hamiltonians are discussed by using polynomial algebras.\n", "  The new photometric space-borne survey missions CoRoT and Kepler will be able\nto detect minute flux variations in binary stars due to relativistic beaming\ncaused by the line-of-sight motion of their components. In all but very short\nperiod binaries (P>10d), these variations will dominate over the ellipsoidal\nand reflection periodic variability. Thus, CoRoT and Kepler will discover a new\nobservational class: photometric beaming binary stars. We examine this new\ncategory and the information that the photometric variations can provide. The\nvariations that result from the observatory heliocentric velocity can be used\nto extract some spectral information even for single stars.\n", "  CoRoT-7 is an 11th magnitude K-star whose light curve shows transits with\ndepth of 0.3 mmag and a period of 0.854 d, superimposed on variability at the\n1% level, due to the modulation of evolving active regions with the star's 23 d\nrotation period. In this paper, we revisit the published HARPS radial velocity\nmeasurements of the object, which were previously used to estimate the\ncompanion mass, but have been the subject of ongoing debate.\n  We build a realistic model of the star's activity during the HARPS\nobservations, by fitting simultaneously the line width and the line bisector,\nand use it to evaluate the contribution of activity to the RV variations. The\ndata show clear evidence of errors above the level of the formal uncertainties,\nwhich are accounted for either by activity, nor by any plausible planet model,\nand which increase rapidly with decreasing signal-to-noise of the spectra. We\ncite evidence of similar systematics in mid-SNR spectra of other targets\nobtained with HARPS and other high-precision RV spectrographs, and discuss\npossible sources. Allowing for these, we re-evaluate the semi-amplitude of the\nCoRoT-7b signal, finding Kb=1.6 +-1.3 m/s, a tentative detection with a much\nreduced significance (1.2-sigma) compared to previous estimates. We also argue\nthat the combined presence of activity and additional errors preclude a\nmeaningful search for additional low-mass companions, despite previous claims\nto the contrary.\n  Our analysis points to a lower density for CoRoT-7b, the 1-sigma mass range\nspanning 1-4 MEarth, allowing for a wide range of bulk compositions. In\nparticular, an ice-rich composition is compatible with the RV constraints. This\nstudy highlights the importance of a realistic treatment of both activity and\nuncertainties, particularly in the medium signal-to-noise ratio regime, which\napplies to most small planet candidates from CoRoT and Kepler.\n", "  The discovery of 9 new brown-dwarf candidates orbiting stars in the CORALIE\nand HARPS radial-velocity surveys is reported. New CORALIE radial velocities\nyielding accurate orbits of 6 previously-known hosts of potential brown-dwarf\ncompanions are presented. Including targets selected from the literature, 33\nhosts of potential brown-dwarf companions are examined. Employing innovative\nmethods, we use the new reduction of the Hipparcos data to fully characterise\nthe astrometric orbits of 6 objects, revealing M-dwarf companions with masses\nbetween 90 M_Jup and 0.52 M_Sun. Additionally, the masses of two companions can\nbe restricted to the stellar domain. The companion to HD 137510 is found to be\na brown dwarf. At 95 % confidence, the companion of HD 190228 is also a brown\ndwarf. The remaining 23 companions persist as brown-dwarf candidates. Based on\nthe CORALIE planet-search sample, we obtain an upper limit of 0.6 % for the\nfrequency of brown-dwarf companions around Sun-like stars. We find that the\ncompanion-mass distribution function is rising at the lower end of the\nbrown-dwarf mass range, suggesting that in fact we are detecting the high-mass\ntail of the planetary distribution.\n", "  Complex networks have recently attracted much interest due to their\nprevalence in nature and our daily lives [1, 2]. A critical property of a\nnetwork is its resilience to random breakdown and failure [3-6], typically\nstudied as a percolation problem [7-9] or by modeling cascading failures\n[10-12]. Many complex systems, from power grids and the Internet to the brain\nand society [13-15], can be modeled using modular networks comprised of small,\ndensely connected groups of nodes [16, 17]. These modules often overlap, with\nnetwork elements belonging to multiple modules [18, 19]. Yet existing work on\nrobustness has not considered the role of overlapping, modular structure. Here\nwe study the robustness of these systems to the failure of elements. We show\nanalytically and empirically that it is possible for the modules themselves to\nbecome uncoupled or non-overlapping well before the network disintegrates. If\noverlapping modular organization plays a role in overall functionality,\nnetworks may be far more vulnerable than predicted by conventional percolation\ntheory.\n", "  We consider a dynamics generated by families of maps whose invariant density\ndepends on a parameter a and where a itself obeys a stochastic or periodic\ndynamics. For slowly varying a the long-term behavior of iterates is described\nby a suitable superposition of local invariant densities. We provide rigorous\nerror estimates how good this approximation is. Our method generalizes the\nconcept of superstatistics, a useful technique in nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics, to maps. Our main example are Blaschke products, for which we\nprovide rigorous bounds on the difference between Birkhoff density and the\nsuperstatistical composition.\n", "  We present preliminary though statistically significant evidence that shows\nthat multiplanetary systems that exhibit a 2/1 period commensurability are in\ngeneral younger than multiplanetary systems without commensurabilities, or even\nsystems with other commensurabilities. An immediate possible conclusion is that\nthe 2/1 mean-motion resonance in planetary systems, tends to be disrupted after\ntypically a few Gyrs.\n", "  A difficult challenge in physics education is to design professional\ndevelopment programs for teachers, which can lead to fundamental changes in\ntheir practise. We report all activities for physics teachers in the context of\nthe National Plan for Scientific Degrees in Southern Tuscany. Research and\npractice have shown that physics teaching in school is inadequate. The main\nconsequences are limited achievements in school, decrease of students'\ninterests in learning physics and decrease of enrolments in physics in many\ncountries. In recent years, the decline in enrolments was faced up with the\nlaunch of a wide national project addressed to secondary school students and\nteachers. The active involvement of teachers in the design of laboratories was\nfound to be essential for obtaining actions which were not transitory and\nentered permanently in classroom practice. We describe some advanced courses in\nPhysics and Mathematics Education realized few years ago and courses designed\nfor a Master in Physics Educational Innovation and Orienting performed jointly\nby many Italian universities. Other activities are less formal but equally\nrelevant, such as the active involvement of expert, young and in training\nteachers in designing and implementation of laboratory activities for a summer\nschool of physics. Recently, we developed a workshop for teachers of physics\nand mathematics on modelling. which continued in an updating course for\nteachers in which selected topics, named in the same way in both disciplines,\nwere discussed in order to design interdisciplinary learning paths. The purpose\nis to clarify these topics by using specific tools from physics and mathematics\nand to outline the similarities and the differences in both contexts. We\ndescribe teacher reactions and the more significant difficulties we\nencountered. Finally, we discuss which kind of activity seems more effective.\n", "  We describe an extracurricular learning path on waves focused on energy\ntransfer. The advantages of introducing mechanical waves by using the Shive\nwave machine and laboratory activities are presented. Laboratories are realized\nby inquiry, i.e. students explore waves behavior in qualitative way, guess what\ncan happen and suddenly test their hypothesis. Recently, we presented some\ndisciplinary knots that arise usually in empirical investigation, according to\nthe Model of Educational Reconstruction and discussed methodological choices\nmade in designing the learning path and preliminary result about its\nrealization with few, interested and talented pupils. We report the second year\nof this learning path performed with the same students that are introduced to\nmore complex topics such as analogy in wave phenomena and resonance.\nLaboratories are described with particular attention for the energy\ntransformation. We designed the activities in order to propose a complementary\nexperience compared to what was done in class. Despite resonance is a relevant\nphenomenon which runs through almost every branch of physics, many students\nhave never studied it. Yet, resonance is one of the most striking and\nunexpected phenomenon in all physics and it easy to observe but difficult to\nunderstand. Students performed activities in laboratory on several resonant\nsystems. Our purpose was to outline how it is possible to tune a system or a\ndevice in order to obtain resonance and an efficient energy transfer from\ndifferent physical systems, such as a mechanical one and an electrical one.\nThis year, the final task was to analyze different natural phenomena in order\nof choosing one suitable for energy transfer. We present our considerations on\nthe students' learning process and on the possibility of extend a similar path\nin a classroom.\n", "  The relativistic corrections to the productions of double J/psi, double\nUpsilon, and J/psi+Upsilon at the Tevatron and the LHC were investigated within\nthe frame of nonrelativistic QCD. The ratios of short distance coefficients\nbetween relativistic correction and leading order result for color singlet and\ncolor octet states in large p_T limit are approximately -1,-11/3, respectively,\nfor pair production. And for J/psi+Upsilon process the ratio is -11/6 for the\nCO channel. The K factors of relativistic corrections for color singlet and\ncolor octet double J/psi production are -0.23 and -0.84 with adopting v^2=0.23.\nThe relativistic corrections significantly dilute the difference between the\nshape of color-singlet differential cross sections and the color-octet's at\nleading order. Also our results show that the single parton scattering model\nmay be enough to explain the LHCb data for the J/psi pair production.\n", "  Inspired by the construction of the Gribov-Zwanziger action in the Landau\ngauge, we introduce a quark model exhibiting both confinement and chiral\nsymmetry aspects. An important feature is the incorporation of spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking in a renormalizable fashion. The quark propagator in\nthe condensed vacuum turns out to be of a confining type. Besides a real pole,\nit exhibits complex conjugate poles. The resulting spectral form is explicitly\nshown to violate positivity, indicative of its unphysical character. Moreover,\nthe ensuing quark mass function fits well to existing lattice data. To further\nvalidate the physical nature of the model, we identify a massless pseudoscalar\n(i.e. a pion) in the chiral limit and present estimates for the rho meson mass\nand decay constant.\n", "  We present the first wide-range measurement of the charged-particle\npseudorapidity density distribution, for different centralities (the 0-5%,\n5-10%, 10-20%, and 20-30% most central events) in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV at the LHC. The measurement is performed using\nthe full coverage of the ALICE detectors, $-5.0 < \\eta < 5.5$, and employing a\nspecial analysis technique based on collisions arising from LHC \"satellite\"\nbunches. We present the pseudorapidity density as a function of the number of\nparticipating nucleons as well as an extrapolation to the total number of\nproduced charged particles ($N_{\\rm ch} = 17165 \\pm 772$ for the 0-5% most\ncentral collisions). From the measured ${\\rm d}N_{\\rm ch}/{\\rm d}\\eta$\ndistribution we derive the rapidity density distribution, ${\\rm d}N_{\\rm\nch}/{\\rm d}y$, under simple assumptions. The rapidity density distribution is\nfound to be significantly wider than the predictions of the Landau model. We\nassess the validity of longitudinal scaling by comparing to lower energy\nresults from RHIC. Finally the mechanisms of the underlying particle production\nare discussed based on a comparison with various theoretical models.\n", "  An overview of maximally superintegrable classical Hamitonians on spherically\nsymmetric spaces is presented. It turns out that each of these systems can be\nconsidered either as an oscillator or as a Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonian. We show\nthat two possible quantization prescriptions for all these curved systems arise\nif we impose that superintegrability is preserved after quantization, and we\nprove that both possibilities are gauge equivalent.\n", "  We derive the cubic defocusing GP hierarchy in ${\\mathbb R}^3$ from a bosonic\n$N$-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, in the strong\ntopology corresponding to the space ${\\mathcal H}_\\xi^1$ introduced in\n\\cite{chpa}. In particular, we thereby eliminate the requirement of regularity\n${\\mathcal H}_\\xi^{1+}$ for the initial data used in \\cite{CPBBGKY}. Moreover,\nthe marginal density matrices obtained in this strong limit are allowed to be\nof infinite rank. This contrasts previous results where weak-* limits were\nderived, and subsequently enhanced to strong limits based on the condition that\nthe limiting density matrices have finite rank. Furthermore, we prove that\npositive semidefiniteness of marginal density matrices is preserved over time,\nwhich we combine with results in \\cite{CPHE}, to obtain the global\nwell-posedness of solutions.\n", "  We present a new, simpler proof of the unconditional uniqueness of solutions\nto the cubic Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy in $\\R^3$. One of the main tools in our\nanalysis is the quantum de Finetti theorem. Our uniqueness result is equivalent\nto the one established in the celebrated works of Erd\\\"os, Schlein and Yau,\n\\cite{esy1,esy2,esy3,esy4}.\n", "  A new, general formalism to include experimental data in revised stellar\nrates is discussed, containing revised uncertainties. Application to the\ns-process shows that the actual uncertainties in the neutron capture rates can\nbe larger than would be expected from the experimental errors alone. As a\nspecific example for how astrophysical conclusions can depend on the approach\nselected to derive stellar rates, the 151Eu/(151Eu+153Eu) abundance ratio from\nAGB star models is presented. Finally, a recommended workflow for the\nderivation of stellar rates from experiment is laid out.\n", "  We present a single-quadrature feedback scheme able to overcome the\nconventional 3 dB limit on parametric squeezing. The method is experimentally\ndemonstrated in a micromechanical system based on a cantilever with a magnetic\ntip. The cantilever is detected at low temperature by a SQUID susceptometer,\nwhile parametric pumping is obtained by modulating the magnetic field gradient\nat twice the cantilever frequency. A maximum squeezing of 11.5 dB and 11.3 dB\nis observed, respectively in the response to a sinusoidal test signal and in\nthe thermomechanical noise. The maximum squeezing factor is limited only by the\nmaximum achievable parametric modulation. The proposed technique can be used to\nsqueeze one quadrature of a mechanical resonator below the quantum noise level,\neven without the need for a quantum limited detector.\n", "  Sliding friction is usually introduced in high school, but rarely through\nactivities in laboratory. A qualitative introduction to friction is presented\nby proposing exploration of different kind of materials in order to suggest\nwhich aspects can be relevant and which interaction is involved. Different\nquantitative experiments are proposed for studying Leonardo's laws for\nfriction. The learning path was tested with two high school classes during an\ninstruction trip at department. Students were engaged in the inquiry-based\nintroductory activity and seemed to realize with care the measurements.\nHowever, the analysis of their reports shows some learning difficulties.\n", "  We report a course on teaching in physics lab for teachers enrolled in\nFormative Active Training, which actually allows to obtain the teacher\nqualification in Italy. The course was designed with the purpose of showing in\npractice what means active learning in physics and how effective activities can\nbe realized in practice. Two different type of teachers attended to the course,\na small group, with physics or mathematics degree, for teacher qualification in\nsecondary school of second grade (age 14-19) and a more numerous group for\nqualification in secondary school of first grade (age 11-14), usually with a\ndifferent science degree such as biology, environmental sciences and so on. We\ncompare this training in physics lab between the two groups and with other\nexperiences we performed in previous years in pre-service education and\nupdating courses for teachers in-service.\n", "  The reform of the upper secondary school in Italy has recently introduced\nphysics in the curricula of professional schools, in realities where it was\npreviously absent. Many teachers, often with a temporary position, are obliged\nto teaching physics in schools where the absence of the laboratory is added to\nthe lack of interest of students who feel this matter as very far from their\npersonal interests and from the preparation for the work which could expect\nfrom a professional school. We report a leaning path for introducing students\nto the measurement of simple physical quantities, which continued with the\nstudy of some properties of matter (volume, mass, density) and ending with some\nelements of thermodynamics. Educational materials designed in order to involve\nstudents in an active learning, actions performed for improving the quality of\nlaboratory experience and difficulties encountered are presented. Finally, we\ncompare the active engagement of these students with a similar experience\nperformed in a very different vocational school.\n", "  We prove the existence of scattering states for the defocusing cubic\nGross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchy in ${\\mathbb R}^3$. Moreover, we show that an\nenergy growth condition commonly used in the well-posedness theory of the GP\nhierarchy is, in a specific sense, necessary. In fact, we prove that without\nthe latter, there exist initial data for the focusing cubic GP hierarchy for\nwhich instantaneous blowup occurs.\n", "  We present a simple derivation of the integral fluctuation theorems for\nexcess housekeeping heat for an underdamped Langevin system, without using the\nconcept of dual dynamics. In conformity with the earlier results, we find that\nthe fluctuation theorem for housekeeping heat holds when the steady state\ndistributions are symmetric in velocity, whereas there is no such requirement\nfor the excess heat. We first prove the integral fluctuation theorem for the\nexcess heat, and then show that it naturally leads to the integral fluctuation\ntheorem for housekeeping heat. We also derive the modified detailed fluctuation\ntheorems for the excess and housekeeping heats.\n", "  Graphene-like materials can be effectively described by Quantum\nElectrodynamics in (2+1)-dimensions. In a pristine state, these systems exhibit\na symmetry between the nonequivalent Dirac points in the honeycomb lattice.\nRealistic samples which include distortions and crystalline anisotropies are\nconsidered through mass gaps of topological and dynamical nature. In this work\nwe show that the incorporation of an in-plane uniform external magnetic field\non this pseudochiral asymmetric configuration generates a non-dissipative\nelectric current aligned with the magnetic field: The pseudo chiral magnetic\neffect. This scenario resembles the chiral magnetic effect in Quantum\nChromodynamics.\n", "  The exchange fluctuation theorem for heat exchanged between two systems at\ndifferent temperatures, when kept in direct contact, has been investigated by\nC. Jarzynski and D. K. W\\'ojcik, in Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 92}, 230602 (2004).\nWe extend this result to the case where two Langevin reservoirs at different\ntemperatures are connected via a conductor made of interacting particles, and\nare subjected to an external drive or work source. The Langevin reservoirs are\ncharacterized by Gaussian white noise fluctuations and concomitant friction\ncoefficients. We first derive the Crooks theorem for the ratio between forward\nand reverse paths, and discuss the first law in this model. Then we derive the\nmodified detailed fluctuation theorems (MDFT) for the heat exchanged at each\nend. These theorems differ from the usual form of the detailed fluctuation\ntheorems (DFT) in literature, due the presence of an extra multiplicative\nfactor. This factor quantifies the deviation of our MFDT from the DFT. Finally,\nwe numerically study our model, with only two interacting particles for\nsimplicity.\n", "  Since 2006, forty students from high school are selected to attend a full\nimmersion summer school of physics in the Pigelleto Natural Reserve, on the\nsouth east side of Mount Amiata in the province of Siena. Topics are chosen so\nthat students are involved in activities rarely pursued in high school, aspects\nand relationship with society are underlined and discussed. Our purpose is\noffering to really motivated students an opportunity of testing the scientific\nmethod, the laboratory experience in a stimulating context, by deepening an\ninteresting and relevant topic in order to orienting them towards physics.\nStudents are encouraged in cooperating in small groups in order to present and\nshare the achieved results. Starting from the third edition of the school, the\nschool became a training opportunity for younger teachers which are involved in\nprogramming and realization of selected activities. The laboratory activities\nwith students are usually supervised by a young and an expert teacher in order\nto fix the correct methodology. Recently, young teachers enrolled in a master\nin Physics Education tested in the summer school some activity designed in\ntheir courses.\n", "  In order to describe natural phenomena, science develops sophisticated models\nthat use mathematical and formal languages which seem, and often are, very far\nfrom common experience. When a phenomenon is not accessible to our senses, its\ndescription is indirect and understanding can be difficult for those who are\nnot trained to understand the consequences of formal languages used by\nscientists. When one succeed to obtain a direct visualization of a phenomenon\ninaccessible to senses, it is possible to get a deeper understanding since a\nvery effective channel of learning is involved. A wider and more profound\nresult in learning process can be obtained if the physical system utilized for\nvisualization enables direct interaction with the phenomenon. From the infrared\nvision to cosmic rays, from the magnetic field to the flow of energy, many\nphenomena can be suitable for building systems that allow capturing a greater\nawareness of the physical world. Some examples of such systems are given for\nrelevant topics in physics and for mathematical tools. They were designed for a\nsummer school for students in the last years of high school or for deepening\nlaboratories addressed to talented students in secondary school, but with some\nattention it is possible to adapt them to other cases like high school classes\nor undergraduate students.\n", "  We consider two random walkers starting at the same time $t=0$ from different\npoints in space separated by a given distance $R$. We compute the average\nvolume of the space visited by both walkers up to time $t$ as a function of $R$\nand $t$ and dimensionality of space $d$. For $d<4$, this volume, after proper\nrenormalization, is shown to be expressed through a scaling function of a\nsingle variable $R/\\sqrt{t}$. We provide general integral formulas for scaling\nfunctions for arbitrary dimensionality $d<4$. In contrast, we show that no\nscaling function exists for higher dimensionalities $d \\geq 4$\n", "  The detailed fluctuation theorems of the exact form $P(A)/P(-A)=e^A$ exist\nonly for a handful of variables $A$, namely for work (Crooks theorem), for\ntotal entropy change (Seifert's theorem), etc. However, the so-called modified\ndetailed fluctuation theorems can be formulated for several other thermodynamic\nvariables as well. The difference is that the modified relations contain an\nextra factor, which is dependent on $A$. This factor is usually an average of a\nquantity $e^{-B}$, where $B\\neq A$, with repect to the conditional probability\ndistribution $P(B|A)$. The corresponding modified integral fluctuation theorems\nalso differ from their original counterparts, by not having the usual form\n$\\left<e^{-A}\\right>=1$. The generalization of these relations in presence of\nfeedback has been discussed briefly. The results derived here serve to\ncomplement the already existing results in fluctuation theorems. The steps\nleading to the quantum version of these derivations have been outlined in the\nappendix.\n", "  A learning path is proposed starting from the characterization of a sound\nwave, showing how human beings emit articulate sounds in the language,\nintroducing psychoacoustics, i.e. how the sound interacts with ears and it is\ntransduced into an electrical signal for transmission to the brain. What is\nperceived as noise is presented and the concept is extended to physical\nmeasurements. The interdisciplinary teaching process is focused on active\nlearning through activities at school and outside performed with an open source\nsoftware which allows to record sounds and analyze spectral components.\n", "  We consider discrete random Schr\\\"odinger operators on $\\ell^2\n(\\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a potential of discrete alloy-type structure. That is, the\npotential at lattice site $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^d$ is given by a linear combination\nof independent identically distributed random variables, possibly with\nsign-changing coefficients. In a first part we show that the discrete\nalloy-type model is not uniformly $\\tau$-H\\\"older continuous, a frequently used\ncondition in the literature of Anderson-type models with general random\npotentials. In a second part we review recent results on regularity properties\nof spectral data and localization properties for the discrete alloy-type model.\n", "  The fractal globule state is a popular model for describing chromatin packing\nin eukaryotic nuclei. Here we provide a scaling theory and dissipative particle\ndynamics (DPD) computer simulation for the thermal motion of monomers in the\nfractal globule state. Simulations starting from different entanglement-free\ninitial states show good convergence which provides evidence supporting the\nexistence of unique metastable fractal globule state. We show monomer motion in\nthis state to be sub-diffusive described by $\\langle X^2 (t)\\rangle \\sim\nt^{\\alpha_F}$ with $\\alpha_F$ close to 0.4. This result is in good agreement\nwith existing experimental data on the chromatin dynamics which makes an\nadditional argument in support of the fractal globule model of chromatin\npacking.\n", "  In this work we explore ideas in quantizing AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity. We\nstart with the most general solution to the 3d gravity theory which respects\nBrown-Henneaux boundary conditions. These solutions are specified by two\nholomorphic functions and satisfy simple superposition rule. These geometries\ngenerically have a bifurcate Killing horizon (with a noncompact bifurcation\ncurve) which is not an event horizon and are hence not black holes.\nNonetheless, there are superpositions of these geometries which have event\nhorizon. We propose to view these geometries as \"semiclassical fuzzball\nmicrostates\" of BTZ black holes appearing as superposition of these geometries.\nThe details of quantization of these semiclassical microstates will be\ndiscussed in an upcoming work.\n", "  We demonstrate a superconducting inductive technique to measure the\ndisplacement of a micromechanical resonator. In our scheme, a type I\nsuperconducting microsphere is attached to the free end of a microcantilever\nand approached to the loop of a dc Superconducting Quantum Interference Device\n(SQUID) microsusceptometer. A local magnetic field as low as 100 $\\mu$T,\ngenerated by a field coil concentric to the SQUID, enables detection of the\ncantilever thermomechanical noise at $4.2$ K. The magnetomechanical coupling\nand the magnetic spring are in good agreement with image method calculations\nassuming pure Meissner effect. These measurements are relevant to recent\nproposals of quantum magnetomechanics experiments based on levitating\nsuperconducting microparticles.\n", "  Richardson's theory of turbulent particle pair diffusion [Richardson, L. F.\nProc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A 100, 709--737, 1926], based upon observational data, is\nequivalent to a locality hypothesis in which the turbulent pair diffusivity\n$(K)$ scales with the pair separation $(\\sigma_l)$ with a 4/3-power law, $K\\sim\n\\sigma_l^{4/3}$. Here, a reappraisal of the 1926 dataset reveals that one of\nthe data-points is from a molecular diffusion context; the remaining data from\ngeophysical turbulence display an unequivocal non-local scaling, $K \\sim\n\\sigma_l^{1.564}$. Consequently, the foundations of pair diffusion theory have\nbeen re-examined, leading to a new theory based upon the principle that both\nlocal and non-local diffusional processes govern pair diffusion in homogeneous\nturbulence. Through a novel mathematical approach the theory is developed in\nthe context of generalised power law energy spectra, $E(k)\\sim k^{-p}$ for\n$1<p\\le 3$, over extended inertial subranges. The theory predicts the scaling,\n$K(p)\\sim \\sigma_l^{\\gamma_p}$, with $\\gamma_p$ intermediate between the purely\nlocal and the purely non-local scalings, i.e. $(1+p)/2<\\gamma_p\\le 2$. A\nLagrangian diffusion model, Kinematic Simulations [Kraichnan, R. H., Phys.\nFluids 13, 22-31, 1970; Fung et al., J. Fluid Mech. 236, 281-318, 1992], is\nused to examine the predictions of the new theory all of which are confirmed.\nThe simulations produce the scalings, $K\\sim \\sigma_l^{1.545}$ to $\\sim\n\\sigma_l^{1.570}$, in the accepted range of intermittent turbulence spectra,\n$E(k)\\sim k^{-1.72}$ to $\\sim k^{-1.74}$, in close agreement with the revised\n1926 dataset.\n", "  Low-rank tensor approximation techniques attempt to mitigate the overwhelming\ncomplexity of linear algebra tasks arising from high-dimensional applications.\nIn this work, we study the low-rank approximability of solutions to linear\nsystems and eigenvalue problems on Hilbert spaces. Although this question is\ncentral to the success of all existing solvers based on low-rank tensor\ntechniques, very few of the results available so far allow to draw meaningful\nconclusions for higher dimensions. In this work, we develop a constructive\nframework to study low-rank approximability. One major assumption is that the\ninvolved linear operator admits a low-rank representation with respect to the\nchosen tensor format, a property that is known to hold in a number of\napplications. Simple conditions, which are shown to hold for a fairly general\nproblem class, guarantee that our derived low-rank truncation error estimates\ndo not deteriorate as the dimensionality increases.\n", "  We consider the production of the $\\eta_c$ and $\\chi_{cJ}$ states recoiled\nwith a photon up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s v^2)$ at BESIII and B-factories\nwithin the frame of NRQCD factorization. With the corrections, we revisit the\nnumerical calculations to the cross sections for the $\\eta_c(nS)$ and the\n$\\chi_{cJ}(mP)$ states. We argue that the search for $XYZ$ states with even\ncharge conjugation such as $X(3872)$, $X(3940)$, $X(4160)$, and $X(4350)$\nrecoiled with a photon at BESIII may help clarify the nature of these states.\nFor completeness, the production of charmonium with even charge conjugation\nrecoiled with a photon at B factories is also discussed.\n", "  The possibility of attaining current position of the message sender without\nperson's consent seriously compromises the secrecy of correspondence. Classical\ncommunication systems cannot guarantee the security of communication against\nunwanted location tracking, because the sender must broadcast a signal at the\nmoment of sending the message. The source of the signal could be always\nlocated, at least in principle. We show that quantum communication enables\nsending the message with pre-distributed entangled quantum systems, local weak\nmeasurements, time synchronization between the sender and the receiver and\nclassical communication by the message receiver alone, therefore, physically\nsecuring the sender's location.\n", "  We study a theoretical model of closed quasi-hermitian chain of spins which\nexhibits quantum analogues of chimera states, i.e. long life classical states\nfor which a part of an oscillator chain presents an ordered dynamics whereas\nanother part presents a disordered chaotic dynamics. For the quantum analogue,\nthe chimera behavior deals with the entanglement between the spins of the\nchain. We discuss the entanglement properties, quantum chaos, quantum disorder\nand semi-classical similarity of our quantum chimera system. The quantum\nchimera concept is novel and induces new perspectives concerning the\nentanglement of multipartite systems.\n", "  We observe a dc voltage peak at ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in samples\nconsisting of a single ferromagnetic (FM) layer grown epitaxially on the\n$\\mathit{n-}$GaAs (001) surface. The FMR peak is detected as an interfacial\nvoltage with a symmetric line shape and is present in samples based on various\nFM/$n$-GaAs hetrostructures, including Co$_{2}$MnSi/$n$-GaAs,\nCo$_{2}$FeSi/$n$-GaAs and Fe/$n$-GaAs. We show that the interface bias voltage\ndependence of the FMR signal is identical to that of the tunneling anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (TAMR) over most of the bias range. Furthermore, we show how\nthe precessing magnetization yields a dc FMR signal through the TAMR effect and\nhow the TAMR phenomenon can be used to predict the angular dependence of the\nFMR signal. This TAMR-induced FMR peak can be observed under conditions where\nno spin accumulation is present and no spin-polarized current flows in the\nsemiconductor.\n", "  We establish interpolation problems related to all the $q$-Painlev\\'e\nequations of types from $E_7^{(1)}$ to $(A_2+A_1)^{(1)}$. By solving those\nproblems, we can derive the evolution equations, the scalar Lax pairs and the\ndeterminant formulae of special solutions for the corresponding $q$-Painlev\\'e\nequations.\n", "  To date, spin generation in three-dimensional topological insulators is\nprimarily modeled as a single-surface phenomenon, attributed to the\nmomentum-spin locking on each individual surface. In this article we propose a\nmechanism of spin generation where the role of the insulating yet topologically\nnon-trivial bulk becomes explicit: an external electric field creates a\ntransverse pure spin current through the bulk of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator, which transports spins between the top and bottom\nsurfaces. Under sufficiently high surface disorder, the spin relaxation time\ncan be extended via the Dyakonov-Perel mechanism. Consequently both the spin\ngeneration efficiency and surface conductivity are largely enhanced. Numerical\nsimulation confirms that this spin generation mechanism originates from the\nunique topological connection of the top and bottom surfaces and is absent in\nother two dimensional systems such as graphene, even though they possess a\nsimilar Dirac cone-type dispersion.\n", "  Two port s-matrix for a complex PT-symmetric potential may have uni-modular\neigenvalues. If this happens for all energies, there occurs a perfect emission\nof waves at both ends. We call this phenomenon transparency which is distinctly\ndifferent from coherent perfect absorption with or without lasing. Using the\nversatile PT-symmetric complex Scarf II (scattering) potential, we demonstrate\nanalytically that the transparency can occur regardless of whether PT-symmetry\nis unbroken or broken or if there are only scattering states. In these three\ncases, for a given value of the strength of the real part; the strength of the\nimaginary part $|V_2|$ of the potential lies in $(0, V_{\\alpha}), (V_{\\alpha},\nV_{\\beta})$ and $(0,V_{\\beta})$ respectively. Several other numerically solved\npotentials also support our findings.\n", "  We perform a numerical investigation of the Lyapunov spectra of chaotic\ndynamics in lattices of classical spins in the vicinity of second-order\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase transitions. On the basis of this\ninvestigation, we identify a characteristic of the shape of the Lyapunov\nspectra, the \"G-index\", which exhibits a sharp peak as a function of\ntemperature at the phase transition, provided the order parameter is capable of\nsufficiently strong dynamic fluctuations. As a part of this work, we also\npropose a general numerical algorithm for determining the temperature in\nmany-particle systems, where kinetic energy is not defined.\n", "  We reveal and explain a scaling behavior of the thermopower $S/T$ exhibiting\nby the archetypical heavy-fermion (HF) metal $\\rm{YbRh_2Si_2}$ under the\napplication of magnetic field $B$ at temperatures $T$. We show that the same\nscaling is demonstrated by such different HF compounds as $\\beta$-${\\rm\nYbAlB_4}$ and the strongly correlated layered cobalt oxide $\\rm\n[BiBa_{0.66}K_{0.36}O_{2}]CoO_{2}$. Using $\\rm{YbRh_2Si_2}$ as an example, we\ndemonstrate that the scaling behavior of $S/T$ is violated at the\nantiferromagnetic phase transition, while both the residual resistivity\n$\\rho_0$ and the density of states $N$ experience jumps at the phase\ntransition, making the thermopower experience two jumps and change its sign.\nOur elucidation is based on flattening of the single-particle spectrum that\nprofoundly affects $\\rho_0$ and $N$. To depict the main features of the $S/T$\nbehavior, we construct the $T-B$ schematic phase diagram of $\\rm{YbRh_2Si_2}$.\nOur calculated $S/T$ for the HF compounds are in good agreement with\nexperimental facts and support our observations.\n", "  Aperture based scanning near field optical microscopes are important\ninstruments to study light at the nanoscale and to understand the optical\nfunctionality of photonic nanostructures. In general, a detected image is\naffected by both, the transverse electric and magnetic field components of\nlight. The discrimination of the individual field components is challenging, as\nthese four field components are contained within two signals in the case of a\npolarization-resolved measurement. Here, we develop a methodology to solve the\ninverse imaging problem and to retrieve the vectorial field components from\npolarization- and phase-resolved measurements. Our methodology relies on the\ndiscussion of the image formation process in aperture based scanning near field\noptical microscopes. On this basis, we are also able to explain how the\nrelative contributions of the electric and magnetic field components within\ndetected images depend on the probe geometry, its material composition, and the\nillumination wavelength. This allows to design probes that are dominantly\nsensitive either to the electric or magnetic field components of light.\n", "  This article reviews the use of DeConcini-Procesi wonderful models in\nrenormalization of ultraviolet divergences in position space as introduced by\nBergbauer, Brunetti and Kreimer. In contrast to the exposition there we employ\na slightly different approach; instead of the subspaces in the arrangement of\ndivergent loci, we use the poset of divergent subgraphs as the main tool to\ndescribe the whole renormalization process. This is based on an article by\nFeichtner, where wonderful models were studied from a purely combinatorial\nviewpoint. The main motivation for this approach is the fact that both,\nrenormalization and the model construction, are governed by the combinatorics\nof this poset. Not only simplifies this the exposition considerably, but also\nallows to study the renormalization operators in more detail. Moreover, we\nexplore the renormalization group in this setting by studying how the\nrenormalized distributions behave under a change of renormalization points.\n", "  There are several possible applications of quantum electrodynamics in\ndielectric media which require a quantum description for the electromagnetic\nfield interacting with matter fields. The associated quantum models can refer\nto macroscopic electromagnetic fields or, in alternative, to mesoscopic fields\n(polarization fields) describing an effective interaction between\nelectromagnetic field and matter fields. We adopt the latter approach, and\nfocus on the Hopfield model for the electromagnetic field in a dielectric\ndispersive medium in a framework in which space-time dependent mesoscopic\nparameters occur, like susceptibility, matter resonance frequency, and also\ncoupling between electromagnetic field and polarization field. Our most direct\ngoal is to describe in a phenomenological way a space-time varying dielectric\nperturbation induced by means of the Kerr effect in nonlinear dielectric media.\nThis extension of the model is implemented by means of a Lorentz-invariant\nLagrangian which, for constant microscopic parameters, and in the rest frame,\ncoincides with the standard one. Moreover, we deduce a covariant scalar product\nand provide a covariant quantization scheme which keeps into account the\nconstraints implicit in the model. Examples of viable applications are\nindicated.\n", "  We consider the so-called Hopfield model for the electromagnetic field in a\ndielectric dispersive medium in a framework in which one allows a space-time\ndependence of microscopic parameters, aimed to a phenomenological description\nof a space-time varying dielectric perturbation induced by means of the Kerr\neffect. We discuss the analogue Hawking effect, by first analyzing the\ngeometrical optics for the Hopfield model, and then by introducing a simplified\nmodel which has the bonus to avoid many difficulties which are involved in the\nfull Hopfield model, still keeping the same dispersion relation. Amplitude\ncalculations are indicated, and generalized Manley-Rowe identities are derived\nin a quantum scattering theory framework. Our main result is an analytical\ncalculation of the spontaneous thermal emission in the single-branch case,\nwhich is provided non perturbatively for the first time in the framework of\ndielectric black holes. An universal mechanism for thermality between optical\nblack holes and acoustic black holes is also pointed out.\n", "  We studied solid solution effects on the mechanical properties of\nnanocrystalline (NC) $\\mathrm{Pd}_{\\mathrm{100-x}} \\mathrm{Au}_{\\mathrm{x}}$\nalloys ($0 \\leq \\mathrm{x} < 50 \\mathrm{at.\\%}$) at the low end of the\nnanoscale. Concentration has been used as control parameter to tune material\nproperties (elastic moduli, Burgers vector, stacking fault energies) at\nbasically unaltered microstructure (grain size $D\\approx 10\\mathrm{ nm}$). In\nstark contrast to coarse grained fcc alloys, we observe solid solution\nsoftening for increasing Au-content. The available predictions from models and\ntheories taking explicitly into account the effect of the nanoscale\nmicrostructure on the concentration-dependent shear strength have been\ndisproved without exception. As a consequence, it is implied that dislocation\nactivity contributes only marginally to strength. In fact, we find a linear\ncorrelation between shear strength and shear modulus which quantitatively\nagrees with the universal behavior of metallic glasses discovered by Johnson\nand Samwer [W.L. Johnson and K. Samwer, PRL 95, 195501 (2005)].\n", "  Among several tasks in Machine Learning, a specially important one is that of\ninferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the\nobserved behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process\nis a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP\nand its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and\ncontrol theory, and positive systems theory.\n  We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and\nthe system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the\nquantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum\ninstrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any--\nyields the process at hand by iterative application.\n  We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a\ndescription of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on\nstate vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state\nvectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden\nMarkov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any\nstochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy\nany positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then\nconsists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of\nthe same process exists.\n  We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show\nthat the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding\npossible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our\nresults have potential applications in quantum machine learning,\ndevice-independent characterization and reverse-engineering of stochastic\nprocesses and quantum processors, and dynamical processes with quantum memory.\n", "  We discuss the forces on the internal constituents of the hadrons based on\nthe bag model. The ground state of the hadrons forms a color singlet so that\nthe effects of the colored internal states are neutralized. From the breaking\nof the dilatation and conformal symmetries under the strong interactions the\ncorresponding currents are not conserved. These currents give rise to the\nforces changing the motion of the internal particles which causes confinement.\n", "  Controlling quantum entanglement between parts of a many-body system is the\nkey to unlocking the power of quantum information processing for applications\nsuch as quantum computation, high-precision sensing, and simulation of\nmany-body physics. Spin degrees of freedom of ultracold neutral atoms in their\nground electronic state provide a natural platform given their long coherence\ntimes and our ability to control them with magneto-optical fields, but creating\nstrong coherent coupling between spins has been challenging. We demonstrate a\nRydberg-dressed ground-state blockade that provides a strong tunable\ninteraction energy ($\\sim$1 MHz in units of Planck's constant) between spins of\nindividually trapped cesium atoms. With this interaction we directly produce\nBell-state entanglement between two atoms with a fidelity $\\geq$ 81(2)%,\nexcluding atom loss events, and $\\geq$ 60(3)% when loss is included.\n", "  In this article, I calculate the contributions of the nuclear matter induced\ncondensates up to dimension 5, take into account the next-to-leading order\ncontributions of the nuclear matter induced quark condensate, study the\nproperties of the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector heavy mesons in\nthe nuclear matter with the QCD sum rules in a systematic way, and obtain the\nshifts of the masses and decay constants. Furthermore, I study the\nheavy-meson-nucleon scattering lengths as a byproduct, and obtain the\nconclusion qualitatively about the possible existence of heavy-meson-nucleon\nbound states.\n", "  Metamaterials and plasmonics are powerful tools for unconventional\nmanipulation and harnessing of light. Metamaterials can be engineered to\npossess intriguing properties lacking in natural materials, such as negative\nrefractive index. Plasmonics offers capabilities to confine light in\nsubwavelength dimensions and to enhance light-matter interactions.\nRecently,graphene-based plasmonics has revealed emerging technological\npotential as it features large tunability, higher field-confinement and lower\nloss compared to metal-based plasmonics. Here,we introduce hybrid structures\ncomprising graphene plasmonic resonators efficiently coupled to conventional\nsplit-ring resonators, thus demonstrating a type of highly tunable\nmetamaterial, where the interaction between the two resonances reaches the\nstrong-coupling regime. Such hybrid metamaterials are employed as high-speed\nTHz modulators, exhibiting over 60% transmission modulation and operating speed\nin excess of 40 MHz. This device concept also provides a platform for exploring\ncavity-enhanced light-matter interactions and optical processes in graphene\nplasmonic structures for applications including sensing, photo-detection and\nnonlinear frequency generation.\n", "  We consider a Brownian motion (BM) $x(\\tau)$ and its maximal value $x_{\\max}\n= \\max_{0 \\leq \\tau \\leq t} x(\\tau)$ on a fixed time interval $[0,t]$. We study\nfunctionals of the maximum of the BM, of the form ${\\cal\nO}_{\\max}(t)=\\int_0^t\\, V(x_{\\max} - x(\\tau)) {\\rm d} \\tau$ where $V(x)$ can be\nany arbitrary function and develop various analytical tools to compute their\nstatistical properties. These tools rely in particular on (i) a \"counting\npaths\" method and (ii) a path-integral approach. In particular, we focus on the\ncase where $V(x) = \\delta(x-r)$, with $r$ a real parameter, which is relevant\nto study the density of near-extreme values of the BM (the so called density of\nstates), $\\rho(r,t)$, which is the local time of the BM spent at given distance\n$r$ from the maximum. We also provide a thorough analysis of the family of\nfunctionals ${T}_{\\alpha}(t)=\\int_0^t (x_{\\max} - x(\\tau))^\\alpha \\, {\\rm\nd}\\tau$, corresponding to $V(x) = x^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha$ real. As $\\alpha$ is\nvaried, $T_\\alpha(t)$ interpolates between different interesting observables.\nFor instance, for $\\alpha =1$, $T_{\\alpha = 1}(t)$ is a random variable of the\n\"area\", or \"Airy\", type while for $\\alpha=-1/2$ it corresponds to the maximum\ntime spent by a ballistic particle through a Brownian random potential. On the\nother hand, for $\\alpha = -1$, it corresponds to the cost of the optimal\nalgorithm to find the maximum of a discrete random walk, proposed by Odlyzko.\nWe revisit here, using tools of theoretical physics, the statistical properties\nof this algorithm which had been studied before using probabilistic methods.\nFinally, we extend our methods to constrained BM, including in particular the\nBrownian bridge, i.e., the Brownian motion starting and ending at the origin.\n", "  We introduce and test several novel approaches for periodicity detection in\nunevenly-spaced sparse datasets. Specifically, we examine five different kinds\nof periodicity metrics, which are based on non-parametric measures of serial\ndependence of the phase-folded data. We test the metrics through simulations in\nwhich we assess their performance in various situations, including various\nperiodic signal shapes, different numbers of data points and different signal\nto noise ratios. One of the periodicity metrics we introduce seems to perform\nsignificantly better than the classical ones in some settings of interest to\nastronomers. We suggest that this periodicity metric - the Hoeffding-test\nperiodicity metric - should be used in addition to the traditional methods, to\nincrease periodicity detection probability.\n", "  This is the second of a series of three papers examining how viable it is for\nentanglement to be sustained at high temperatures for quantum systems in\nthermal equilibrium (Case A), in nonequilibrium (Case B) and in nonequilibrium\nsteady state conditions (Case C). The system we analyze here consists of two\ncoupled quantum harmonic oscillators each interacting with its own bath\ndescribed by a scalar field, set at temperatures $T_1 > T_2$. For\n\\textit{constant bilinear inter-oscillator coupling} studied here (Case C1)\nowing to the Gaussian nature, the problem can be solved exactly at arbitrary\ntemperatures even for strong coupling. We find that the valid entanglement\ncriterion in general is not a function of the bath temperature difference, in\ncontrast to thermal transport in the same NESS setting [1]. Thus lowering the\ntemperature of one of the thermal baths does not necessarily help to safeguard\nthe entanglement between the oscillators. Indeed, quantum entanglement will\ndisappear if any one of the thermal baths has a temperature higher than the\ncritical temperature $T_c$. With the Langevin equations derived we give a full\ndisplay of how entanglement dynamics in this system depends on $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$\n, the inter-oscillator coupling and the system-bath coupling strengths. For\nweak oscillator-bath coupling the critical temperature $T_c$ is about the order\nof the inverse oscillator frequency, but for strong oscillator-bath coupling it\nwill depend on the bath cutoff frequency. We conclude that in most realistic\ncircumstances, for bosonic systems in NESS with constant bilinear coupling,\n`hot entanglement' is largely a fiction. In Paper III we will examine the case\n(C2) of \\textit{time-dependent driven coupling } which contains the parametric\npumping type described in [2] wherein entanglement was first shown to sustain\nat high temperatures.\n", "  We investigate the heat conductivity $\\kappa$ of the Heisenberg spin-1/2\nladder at finite temperature covering the entire range of inter-chain coupling\n$J_\\perp$, by using several numerical methods and perturbation theory within\nthe framework of linear response. We unveil that a perturbative prediction\n$\\kappa \\propto J_\\perp^{-2}$, based on simple golden-rule arguments and valid\nin the strict limit $J_\\perp \\to 0$, applies to a remarkably wide range of\n$J_\\perp$, qualitatively and quantitatively. In the large $J_\\perp$-limit, we\nshow power-law scaling of opposite nature, namely, $\\kappa \\propto J_\\perp^2$.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the weak and strong coupling regimes to be connected\nby a broad minimum, slightly below the isotropic point at $J_\\perp =\nJ_\\parallel$. As a function of temperature $T$, this minimum scales as $\\kappa\n\\propto T^{-2}$ down to $T$ on the order of the exchange coupling constant.\nThese results provide for a comprehensive picture of $\\kappa(J_\\perp,T)$ of\nspin ladders.\n", "  A four-dimensional static Schwarzschild-like solution obtained in [3]-[6] in\nthe frames of the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity at the Kaluza-Klein split is\nanalyzed. The matter in these solutions is created by auxiliary dimensions. The\nmain goal of our work is to study physically sensible characteristics, which\ncould be observable. Study of the perturbed equations demonstrates their\nstability under linear perturbations. The specific combinations of the\nparameters, permitting to construct black hole-like objects with one or two\nhorizons or naked singularities are determined. Stable orbits of test particles\naround these black holes are presented. We show the exotic thermodynamical\nproperties of the solution, when the Hawking evaporation law has the behavior\nopposite to usual one in General Relativity.\n", "  Based on an extension of the holographic principle to superspace, we provide\na strong-coupling description of smooth super Wilson loops in terms of minimal\nsurfaces of the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ superstring. We employ the classical\nintegrability of the Green-Schwarz superstring on $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ to derive\nthe superconformal and Yangian $Y[\\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)]$ Ward identities for\nthe super Wilson loop, thus extending the strong coupling results obtained for\nthe Maldacena-Wilson loop. In the course of the derivation, we determine the\nminimal surface solution up to third order in an expansion close to the\nconformal boundary.\n", "  We examine the circular velocity profiles of galaxies in {\\Lambda}CDM\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the EAGLE and LOCAL GROUPS\nprojects and compare them with a compilation of observed rotation curves of\ngalaxies spanning a wide range in mass. The shape of the circular velocity\nprofiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy\nmass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity.\nThis is especially true for low-mass dark matter-dominated systems, reflecting\nthe expected similarity of the underlying cold dark matter haloes. This is at\nodds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotation\ncurve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. Some dwarfs have rotation\ncurves that agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are systems\nwhere the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower than\nexpected for cold dark matter haloes and include many galaxies where previous\nwork claims the presence of a constant density \"core\". The \"cusp vs core\" issue\nis thus better characterized as an \"inner mass deficit\" problem than as a\ndensity slope mismatch. For several galaxies the magnitude of this inner mass\ndeficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where cores\nresult from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. We\nconclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) the\ndark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) current\nsimulations fail to reproduce the effects of baryons on the inner regions of\ndwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of \"inner mass deficit\" galaxies\ninferred from kinematic data are incorrect.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze 48 signals of rest tremor velocity related to 12\ndistinct subjects affected by Parkinson's disease. The subjects belong to two\ndifferent groups, formed by four and eight subjects with, respectively, high-\nand low-amplitude rest tremors. Each subject is tested in four settings, given\nby combining the use of deep brain stimulation and L-DOPA medication. We\ndevelop two main feature-based representations of such signals, which are\nobtained by considering (i) the long-term correlations and multifractal\nproperties, and (ii) the power spectra. The feature-based representations are\ninitially utilized for the purpose of characterizing the subjects under\ndifferent settings. In agreement with previous studies, we show that deep brain\nstimulation does not significantly characterize neither of the two groups,\nregardless of the adopted representation. On the other hand, the medication\neffect yields statistically significant differences in both high- and\nlow-amplitude tremor groups. We successively test several different instances\nof the two feature-based representations of the signals in the setting of\nsupervised classification and (nonlinear) feature transformation. We consider\nthree different classification problems, involving the recognition of (i) the\npresence of medication, (ii) the use of deep brain stimulation, and (iii) the\nmembership to the high- and low-amplitude tremor groups. Classification results\nshow that the use of medication can be discriminated with higher accuracy,\nconsidering many of the feature-based representations. Notably, we show that\nthe best results are obtained with a parsimonious, two-dimensional\nrepresentation encoding the long-term correlations and multifractal character\nof the signals.\n", "  We present details of numerical simulations of the gravitational radiation\nproduced by a first order thermal phase transition in the early universe. We\nconfirm that the dominant source of gravitational waves is sound waves\ngenerated by the expanding bubbles of the low-temperature phase. We demonstrate\nthat the sound waves have a power spectrum with a power-law form between the\nscales set by the average bubble separation (which sets the length scale of the\nfluid flow $L_\\text{f}$) and the bubble wall width. The sound waves generate\ngravitational waves whose power spectrum also has a power-law form, at a rate\nproportional to $L_\\text{f}$ and the square of the fluid kinetic energy\ndensity. We identify a dimensionless parameter $\\tilde\\Omega_\\text{GW}$\ncharacterising the efficiency of this \"acoustic\" gravitational wave production\nwhose value is $8\\pi\\tilde\\Omega_\\text{GW} \\simeq 0.8 \\pm 0.1$ across all our\nsimulations. We compare the acoustic gravitational waves with the standard\nprediction from the envelope approximation. Not only is the power spectrum\nsteeper (apart from an initial transient) but the gravitational wave energy\ndensity is generically larger by the ratio of the Hubble time to the phase\ntransition duration, which can be 2 orders of magnitude or more in a typical\nfirst order electroweak phase transition.\n", "  We study the near horizon structure of Extremal Vanishing Horizon (EVH) black\nholes, extremal black holes with vanishing horizon area with a vanishing\none-cycle on the horizon. We construct the most general near horizon EVH and\nnear-EVH ansatz for the metric and other fields, like dilaton and gauge fields\nwhich may be present in the theory. We prove that (1) the near horizon EVH\ngeometry for generic gravity theory in generic dimension has a three\ndimensional maximally symmetric subspace; (2) if the matter fields of the\ntheory satisfy strong energy condition either this 3d part is AdS$_3$, or the\nsolution is a direct product of a locally 3d flat space and a $d-3$ dimensional\npart; (3) these results extend to the near horizon geometry of near-EVH black\nholes, for which the AdS$_3$ part is replaced with BTZ geometry. We present\nsome specific near horizon EVH geometries in 3, 4 and 5 dimensions for which\nthere is a classification. We also briefly discuss implications of these\ngeneric results for generic (gauged) supergravity theories and also for the\nthermodynamics of near-EVH black holes and the EVH/CFT proposal.\n", "  Entanglement is a ubiquitous feature of low temperature systems and believed\nto be highly relevant for the dynamics of condensed matter properties and\nquantum computation even at higher temperatures. The experimental certification\nof this paradigmatic quantum effect in macroscopic high temperature systems is\nconstrained by the limited access to the quantum state of the system. In this\npaper we show how macroscopic observables beyond the energy of the system can\nbe exploited as proxy witnesses for entanglement detection. Using linear and\nsemi-definite relaxations we show that all previous approaches to this problem\ncan be outperformed by our proxies, i.e. entanglement can be certified at\nhigher temperatures without access to any local observable. For an efficient\ncomputation of proxy witnesses one can resort to a generalized grand canonical\nensemble, enabling entanglement certification even in complex systems with\nmacroscopic particle numbers.\n", "  We investigated the effect of charge on the membrane morphology of giant\nunilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of various mixtures containing charged\nlipids. We observed the membrane morphologies by fluorescent and confocal laser\nmicroscopy in lipid mixtures consisting of a neutral unsaturated lipid\n[dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)], a neutral saturated lipid\n[dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)], a charged unsaturated lipid\n[dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$)], a charged saturated\nlipid [dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$)], and\ncholesterol (Chol). In binary mixtures of neutral DOPC/DPPC and charged\nDOPC/DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$, spherical vesicles were formed. On the other\nhand, pore formation was often observed with GUVs consisting of\nDOPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$ and DPPC. In a DPPC/DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$/Chol\nternary mixture, pore-formed vesicles were also frequently observed. The\npercentage of pore-formed vesicles increased with the DPPG$^{\\scriptsize{(-)}}$\nconcentration. Moreover, when the head group charges of charged lipids were\nscreened by the addition of salt, pore-formed vesicles were suppressed in both\nthe binary and ternary charged lipid mixtures. We discuss the mechanisms of\npore formation in charged lipid mixtures and the relationship between phase\nseparation and the membrane morphology. Finally, we reproduce the results seen\nin experimental systems by using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the collision between two fermions in Hubbard model\nwith on-site interaction strength $U$. The exact solution shows that the\nscattering matrix for two-wavepacket collision is separable into two\nindependent parts, operating on spatial and spin degrees of freedom,\nrespectively. The S-matrix for spin configuration is equivalent to that of\nHeisenberg-type pulsed interaction with the strength depending on $U$ and\nrelative group velocity $\\upsilon _{r}$. This can be applied to create distant\nEPR pair, through a collision process for two fermions with opposite spins in\nthe case of $\\left\\vert \\upsilon _{r}/U\\right\\vert =1$,\\ without the need for\ntemporal control and measurement process. Multiple collision process for many\nparticles is also discussed.\n", "  The cross sections of the Higgs production and the corresponding backgrounds\nof $e^+e^-$ annihilations at the CEPC (Circular Electron and Positron Collider)\nare calculated by a Monte-Carlo method, and the beamstruhlung effect at the\nCEPC is carefully investigated. The potential for new physics beyond the\nStandard Model at the CEPC is discussed.\n", "  The free particle Schrodinger equation admits a non-trivial self-accelerating\nAiry wave packet solution. Recently, the Airy beams that freely accelerate in\nspace was experimentally realized in photonics community. Here we present\nself-accelerating waves for the Bose-Einstein condensate in a time dependent\nharmonic oscillator potential. We show that parity and time reversal symmetries\nfor self accelerating waves are spontaneously broken.\n", "  We briefly discuss some of the known and new properties of rotating\ngeometries that are relevant to this work. We generalize the analytical method\nof superposition of fields, known for generating nonrotating solutions, and\napply it to construct massless and massive rotating physical wormholes sourced\nby a source-free electromagnetic field and an exotic fluid both anisotropic.\nTheir stress-energy tensors are presented in compact and general forms. For the\nmassive rotating wormholes there exists a mass-charge constraint yielding\nalmost no more dragging effects than ordinary stars. There are conical spirals\nthrough the throat along which no local negative energy densities are noticed\nfor these rotating wormholes. This conclusion extends to nonrotating massive\ntype I wormholes derived previously by the author that seem to be the first\nkind of nonrotating wormholes with this property. Based on the classification\nmade in J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 07 (2015) 037 [arXiv:1412.8282]: \"Type I\nwormholes have their radial pressure dying out faster, as one moves away from\nthe throat, than any other component of the stress-energy and thus violate the\nleast the local energy conditions. In type II (resp. III) the radial and\ntransverse pressures are asymptotically proportional and die out faster (resp.\nslower) than the energy density\".\n", "  The ground state properties of $N$ spinless free fermions in a\n$d$-dimensional confining potential are studied. We find that any $n$-point\ncorrelation function has a simple determinantal structure that allows us to\ncompute several properties exactly for large $N$. We show that the average\ndensity has a finite support with an edge, and near this edge the density\nexhibits a universal (valid for a wide class of potentials) scaling behavior\nfor large $N$. The associated edge scaling function is computed exactly and\ngeneralizes to any $d$ the edge electron gas result of Kohn and Mattsson in\n$d=3$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 3487 (1998)]. In addition, we calculate the kernel\n(that characterizes any $n$-point correlation function) for large $N$ and show\nthat, when appropriately scaled, it depends only on dimension $d$, but has\notherwise universal scaling forms, at the edges. The edge kernel, for higher\n$d$, generalizes the Airy kernel in one dimension, well known from random\nmatrix theory.\n", "  We present a new selection technique of producing spectroscopic target\ncatalogues for massive spectroscopic surveys for cosmology. This work was\nconducted in the context of the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (eBOSS), which will use ~200 000 emission line galaxies (ELGs) at\n0.6<zspec<1.0 to obtain a precise baryon acoustic oscillation measurement. Our\nproposed selection technique is based on optical and near-infrared broad-band\nfilter photometry. We used a training sample to define a quantity, the Fisher\ndiscriminant (linear combination of colours), which correlates best with the\ndesired properties of the target: redshift and [OII] flux. The proposed\nselections are simply done by applying a cut on magnitudes and this Fisher\ndiscriminant. We used public data and dedicated SDSS spectroscopy to quantify\nthe redshift distribution and [OII] flux of our ELG target selections. We\ndemonstrate that two of our selections fulfil the initial eBOSS/ELG redshift\nrequirements: for a target density of 180 deg^2, ~70% of the selected objects\nhave 0.6<zspec<1.0 and only ~1% of those galaxies in the range 0.6<zspec<1.0\nare expected to have a catastrophic zspec estimate. Additionally, the stacked\nspectra and stacked deep images for those two selections show characteristic\nfeatures of star-forming galaxies. The proposed approach using the Fisher\ndiscriminant could, however, be used to efficiently select other galaxy\npopulations, based on multi-band photometry, providing that spectroscopic\ninformation is available. This technique could thus be useful for other future\nmassive spectroscopic surveys such as PFS, DESI, and 4MOST.\n", "  In a previous paper it was shown that the recently constructed action for\nopen superstring field theory based on $A_\\infty$ algebras can be re-written in\nWess-Zumino-Witten-like form, thus establishing its relation to Berkovits' open\nsuperstring field theory. In this paper we explain the relation between these\ntwo theories from a different perspective which emphasizes the small Hilbert\nspace, and in particular the relation between the $A_\\infty$ structures on both\nsides.\n", "  We report two theoretical discoveries for $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-topological metals\nand semimetals. It is shown first that any dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fermi\nsurface is topologically equivalent to a Fermi point. Then the famous\nconventional no-go theorem, which was merely proven before for $\\mathbb{Z}$\nFermi points in a periodic system without any discrete symmetry, is generalized\nto that the total topological charge is zero for all cases. Most remarkably, we\nfind and prove an unconventional strong no-go theorem: all $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fermi\npoints have the same topological charge $\\nu_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} =1$ or $0$ for\nperiodic systems. Moreover, we also establish all six topological types of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ models for realistic physical dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the statistics of records in a random sequence\n$\\{x_B(0)=0,x_B(1),\\cdots, x_B(n)=x_B(0)=0\\}$ of $n$ time steps. The sequence\n$x_B(k)$'s represents the position at step $k$ of a random walk `bridge' of $n$\nsteps that starts and ends at the origin. At each step, the increment of the\nposition is a random jump drawn from a specified symmetric distribution. We\nstudy the statistics of records and record ages for such a bridge sequence, for\ndifferent jump distributions. In absence of the bridge condition, i.e., for a\nfree random walk sequence, the statistics of the number and ages of records\nexhibits a `strong' universality for all $n$, i.e., they are completely\nindependent of the jump distribution as long as the distribution is continuous.\nWe show that the presence of the bridge constraint destroys this strong `all\n$n$' universality. Nevertheless a `weaker' universality still remains for large\n$n$, where we show that the record statistics depends on the jump distributions\nonly through a single parameter $0<\\mu\\le 2$, known as the L\\'evy index of the\nwalk, but are insensitive to the other details of the jump distribution. We\nderive the most general results (for arbitrary jump distributions) wherever\npossible and also present two exactly solvable cases. We present numerical\nsimulations that verify our analytical results.\n", "  It is shown that in the noncommutative version of QED (NCQED) Gribov copies\ninduced by the noncommutativity of space-time appear in the Landau gauge. This\nis a genuine effect of noncommutative geometry which disappears when the\nnoncommutative parameter vanishes.\n", "  A high luminosity Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) as a Higgs\nFactory will be helpful to the precision measurement of the Higgs mass. The\nsignal-background interference effect is carefully studied for the Higgs\ndiphoton decay mode in the associated Z boson production at the future $e^+e^-$\ncolliders at energy $246 {\\rm GeV}$. The mass shifts go up from about $20 {\\rm\nMeV}$ to $50 {\\rm MeV}$ for the experimental mass resolution ranging from $0.8\n{\\rm GeV}$ to $2 {\\rm GeV}$.\n", "  (abridged) We analyse the clustering features of Large Scale Structures (LSS)\nin the presence of massive neutrinos, employing a set of large-volume,\nhigh-resolution cosmological N-body simulations, where neutrinos are treated as\na separate collisionless fluid. The volume of 8$\\cGpc$, combined with a\nresolution of about $8\\times 10^{10}\\Ms$ for the cold dark matter (CDM)\ncomponent, represents a significant improvement over previous N-body\nsimulations in massive neutrino cosmologies. We show that most of the nonlinear\nevolution is generated exclusively by the CDM component. We find that\naccounting only for the nonlinear evolution of the CDM power spectrum allows to\nrecover the total matter power spectrum with the same accuracy as the massless\ncase. Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the \\halofit\\ formula\ncalibrated on $\\Lambda$CDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear\nCDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the\nmassive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering\nproperties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the\nproper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the {\\em\ncold} rather than the {\\em total} matter distribution, as recently shown in the\nliterature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that,\nwhen accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear\nbias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-$2 \\%$ in the determination of\nthe linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering. This result is quite\nimportant if we consider that future spectroscopic galaxy surveys, as \\eg\\\nEuclid, are expected to measure the linear growth-rate with statistical errors\nless than about $3 \\%$ at $z\\lesssim1$.\n", "  Next generation multi-ton scale noble liquid experiments have the unique\nopportunity to discover dark matter particles at the TeV scale, reaching the\nsensitivity of 10^-48 cm2 in the WIMP nucleon scattering cross-section. A\nprerequisite will be the reduction of radiogenic background sources to\nnegligible levels. This is only possible if ultra pure high efficiency\nphotosensors are available for the scintillation light readout. Current\nexperiments (e.g. Xenon, LUX, Darkside, ArDM) use cryogenic PMTs as\nphotosensors. An attractive alternative is represented by silicon\nphotomultiplier arrays (SiPM arrays), which show unrivalled performances in\nsingle photon detection. This paper reports on the performance of the\nSensL-30035-16P SiPM array and a custom made cryogenic front-end board at the\nliquid argon temperature.\n", "  The ability to monitor nutrient and other environmental conditions with high\nsensitivity is crucial for cell growth and survival. Sensory adaptation allows\na cell to recover its sensitivity after a transient response to a shift in the\nstrength of extracellular stimulus. The working principles of adaptation have\nbeen established previously based on rate equations which do not consider\nfluctuations in a thermal environment. Recently, G. Lan et al. (Nature Phys.,\n8:422-8, 2012) performed a detailed analysis of a stochastic model for the E.\ncoli sensory network. They showed that accurate adaptation is possible only\nwhen the system operates in a nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS). They further\nproposed an energy-speed-accuracy (ESA) trade-off relation. We present here\nanalytic results on the NESS of the model through a mapping to a\none-dimensional birth-death process. An exact expression for the entropy\nproduction rate is also derived. Based on these results, we are able to discuss\nthe ESA relation in a more general setting. Our study suggests that the\nadaptation error can be reduced exponentially as the methylation range\nincreases. Finally, we show that a nonequilibrium phase transition exists in\nthe infinite methylation range limit, despite the fact that the model contains\nonly two discrete variables.\n", "  One of the less well understood ambiguities of quantization is emphasized to\nresult from the presence of higher-order time derivatives in the Lagrangians\nresulting in multiple-valued Hamiltonians. We explore certain classes of\nbranched Hamiltonians in the context of nonlinear autonomous differential\nequation of Lienard type. Two eligible elementary nonlinear models that emerge\nare shown to admit a feasible quantization along these lines.\n", "  We characterize the phenomenon of \"crowding\" near the largest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_{\\max}$ of random $N \\times N$ matrices belonging to the Gaussian\n$\\beta$-ensemble of random matrix theory, including in particular the Gaussian\northogonal ($\\beta=1$), unitary ($\\beta=2$) and symplectic ($\\beta = 4$)\nensembles. We focus on two distinct quantities: (i) the density of states (DOS)\nnear $\\lambda_{\\max}$, $\\rho_{\\rm DOS}(r,N)$, which is the average density of\neigenvalues located at a distance $r$ from $\\lambda_{\\max}$ (or the density of\neigenvalues seen from $\\lambda_{\\max}$) and (ii) the probability density\nfunction of the gap between the first two largest eigenvalues, $p_{\\rm\nGAP}(r,N)$. Using heuristic arguments as well as well numerical simulations, we\ngeneralize our recent exact analytical study of the Hermitian case\n(corresponding to $\\beta = 2$). We also discuss some applications of these two\nquantities to statistical physics models.\n", "  Topologically stable matters can have a long lifetime, even if\nthermodynamically costly, when the thermal agitation is sufficiently low. A\nmagnetic skyrmion lattice (SkL) represents a unique form of long-range magnetic\norder that is topologically stable, and therefore, a long-lived, metastable SkL\ncan form. Experimental observations of the SkL in bulk crystals, however, have\nmostly been limited to a finite and narrow temperature region in which the SkL\nis thermodynamically stable; thus, the benefits of the topological stability\nremain unclear. Here, we report a metastable SkL created by quenching a\nthermodynamically stable SkL. Hall-resistivity measurements of MnSi reveal\nthat, although the metastable SkL is short-lived at high temperatures, the\nlifetime becomes prolonged (>> 1 week) at low temperatures. The manipulation of\na delicate balance between thermal agitation and the topological stability\nenables a deterministic creation/annihilation of the metastable SkL by\nexploiting electric heating and subsequent rapid cooling, thus establishing a\nfacile method to control the formation of a SkL.\n", "  The spin orbit effect in graphene is too muted to have any observable\nsignificance with respect to its application in spintronics. However, graphene\ntechnology is too valuable to be rendered impotent to spin transport. In this\ncommunication we look at the effect of adiabatically twisting a single molecule\nmagnet embedded in a graphene monolayer. Surprisingly, we see that pure spin\ncurrents (zero charge current) can be generated from the system via quantum\npumping. In addition we also see spin selective current can also be pumped from\nthe system. The pure spin current seen is quite resilient to temperature while\ndisorder has a limited effect. Further the direction of these spin pumped\ncurrents can be easily and exclusively controlled by the magnetization of the\nsingle molecule magnet with disorder having no effect on the magnetization\ncontrol of the pumped spin currents.\n", "  The present knowledge of Lamb shift, fine- and hyperfine structure of the\n$\\mathrm{2S}$ and $\\mathrm{2P}$ states in muonic deuterium is reviewed in\nanticipation of the results of a first measurement of several $\\mathrm{2S-2P}$\ntransition frequencies in muonic deuterium ($\\mu\\mathrm{d}$). A term-by-term\ncomparison of all available sources reveals reliable values and uncertainties\nof the QED and nuclear structure-dependent contributions to the Lamb shift,\nwhich are essential for a determination of the deuteron rms charge radius from\n$\\mu\\mathrm{d}$. Apparent discrepancies between different sources are resolved,\nin particular for the difficult two-photon exchange contributions. Problematic\nsingle-sourced terms are identified which require independent recalculation.\n", "  Sensors based on whispering gallery resonators have minute footprints and can\npush achievable sensitivities and resolutions to their limits. Here, we use a\nmicrobubble resonator, with a wall thickness of 500 nm and an intrinsic\nQ-factor of $10^7$ in the telecommunications C-band, to investigate aerostatic\npressure sensing via stress and strain of the material. The microbubble is made\nusing two counter-propagating CO$_2$ laser beams focused onto a microcapillary.\nThe measured sensitivity is 19 GHz/bar at 1.55 $\\mu$m. We show that this can be\nfurther improved to 38 GHz/bar when tested at the 780 nm wavelength range. In\nthis case, the resolution for pressure sensing can reach 0.17 mbar with a\nQ-factor higher than $5\\times10^7$.\n", "  In this paper we study the Einstein-Boltzmann system with Bianchi I symmetry.\nIsotropization of Bianchi I spacetimes was proved in [13] in the Vlasov case,\nand asymptotic behaviour of the relativistic Boltzmann equation was studied in\n[9] in the isotropic case. These results are generalized in the present paper\nto the non-isotropic and Boltzmann case. We assume that the initial data are\nsmall in a suitable sense, and show that solutions of the Einstein-Boltzmann\nsystem are future geodesically complete, that they isotropize and have a\ndust-like behaviour at late times. Detailed information about the metric and\nthe matter terms is obtained. In short, the solution is asymptotically the\nEinstein-de Sitter solution.\n", "  Despite the discovery of a Higgs boson h(125GeV) at the LHC Run-1, its\nself-interaction has fully evaded direct experimental probe so far. Such\nself-interaction is vital for electroweak symmetry breaking, vacuum stability\nand electroweak phase transition, and Higgs inflation. It is a most likely\nplace to encode new physics beyond the standard model. We parametrize such new\nphysics by model-independent dimension-6 effective operators, and study their\ntests via Higgs pair production at hadron colliders. We analyze three major\ndi-Higgs production channels at parton level, and compare the\nparameter-dependence of total cross sections and kinematic distributions at the\nLHC(14TeV) and pp(100TeV) hadron collider. We further perform full simulations\nfor the di-Higgs production channel $gg\\to hh \\to b\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ and its\nbackgrounds at the pp(100TeV) hadron collider. We construct four kinds of\nbenchmark points, and study the sensitivities to probing different regions of\nthe parameter space of cubic Higgs interactions. We find that for one-parameter\nanalysis and with a 3/ab (30/ab) integrated luminosity, the $gg\\to hh \\to\nb\\bar{b}\\gamma\\gamma$ channel can measure the SM cubic Higgs coupling and the\nderivative cubic Higgs coupling to an accuracy of about 13% (4.2%) and 5%\n(1.6%), respectively.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg inequality is a widely used test of the \"quantumness\" of a\nsystem, and involves correlations between measurements realized at different\ntimes. According to its widespread interpretation, a violation of the\nLegget-Garg inequality disproofs macroscopic realism and non-invasiveness.\nNevertheless, recent results point out that macroscopic realism is a model\ndependent notion and that one should always be able to attribute to\ninvasiveness a violation of a Legget-Garg inequality. This opens some natural\nquestions: how to provide such an attribution in a systematic way? How can\napparent macroscopic realism violation be recast into a dimensional independent\ninvasiveness model? The present work answers these questions by introducing an\noperational model where the effects of invasiveness are controllable through a\nparameter associated with what is called the {\\it measurability} of the\nphysical system. Such a parameter leads to different generalized measurements\nthat can be associated with the dimensionality of a system, to measurement\nerrors or to back action.\n", "  These two accompanying papers treat two mode entanglement for systems of\nidentical massive bosons and the relationship to spin squeezing and other\nquantum correlation effects. Entanglement is a key quantum feature of composite\nsystems where the probabilities for joint measurements on the composite\nsub-systems are no longer determined from measurement probabilities on the\nseparate sub-systems. We focus on the meaning of entanglement, the quantum\nparadoxes associated with entangled states, and important tests that allow an\nexperimentalist to determine whether a quantum state - in particular, one for\nmassive bosons is entangled. Our tests for entanglement fully utilise the\nsymmetrisation principle and super-selection rules for bosonic massive\nparticles. These papers provides detailed arguments necessary for the\nconclusions of a recent paper which presented results for rigorously\ndemonstrating the entanglement of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).\n  In the first paper (I), we discuss the meaning of entanglement for systems of\nidentical particles. For such systems, the relevant quantum density operators\nmust satisfy the symmetrisation principle and global and local super-selection\nrules prohibiting states in which there are coherences between differing\nparticle numbers. We fully justify these requirements. In the second\nquantisation approach, both the system and sub-systems are modes (or sets of\nmodes) rather than particles, particles being associated with different mode\noccupancies.\n  In the accompanying review paper (II), we consider spin squeezing and other\ntests for entanglement for two-mode bosonic systems. Starting from paper (I) we\ndetermine which tests are useful for detecting entanglement in massive bosonic\n(BEC), as opposed to photonic, systems. Several new inequalities are derived,\nand recent key experiments are analysed.\n", "  The exchange contribution, $\\Pi_1 ({\\bf k}, 0)$, to the static dielectric\nfunction in the electron liquid is evaluated exactly. Expression for it is\nderived analytically in terms of one quadrature. The expression, as presented\nin Eq. (3) in the Introduction, turns out to be very simple. A fully explicit\nexpression (with no more integral in it) for $\\Pi_1 ({\\bf k}, 0)$ is further\ndeveloped in terms of series. Equation (3) is proved to be equal to the\nexpression obtained before under some mathematical assumption by Engel and\nVosko, thus in the meanwhile putting the latter on a rigorous basis. The\nexpansions of $\\Pi_1 ({\\bf k}, 0)$ at the wavectors of $k=0$, $k=2k_F$, and at\nlimiting large $k$ are derived. The results all verify those obtained by Engel\nand Vosko.\n", "  In the present paper we develop a model of the Higgs inflation based on the\nnon-minimal coupling of the Higgs boson to gravity predicted by Graviweak\nUnification. But later we get rid of the non-minimal coupling to gravity by\nmaking the conformal transformation from the Jordan frame to the Einstein\nframe. We construct a self-consistent $Spin(4,4)$-invariant model of the\nunification of gravity with weak $SU(2)$ interactions in the assumption of the\nexistence of visible and invisible sectors of the Universe. Assuming the\ninteraction between the ordinary and mirror Higgs fields, we develop a special\nHybrid model of inflation. According to this model, the inflaton starts trapped\nfrom the \"false vacuum\" of the Universe at the Higgs field VEV $v\\sim 10^{18}$\nGeV (in the visible world). Then the inflations of the two Higgs doublet\nfields, visible $\\phi$ and mirror $\\phi'$, lead to the emergence of the\nStandard Model vacua at the Electroweak scales with the Higgs boson VEVs\n$v_1\\approx 246$ GeV and $v'_1=\\zeta v_1$ in the visible and invisible worlds,\nrespectively. Considering the results of cosmology and calculating the number\nof e-folds $N^*$, we predict $\\zeta\\simeq 100-115$ for $N^*\\simeq 50-60$, in\nagreement with previous results of the model with broken mirror parity. We also\nconsider RGEs, taking into account the mixing term - the interaction between\nthe ordinary and mirror Higgs bosons, assuming the smallness of the mixing\ncoupling.\n", "  The inconclusive results of the previous first-principles studies on the \\S3\n\\ grain boundaries (GBs) in \\CISe\\ reveal the importance of employing a method\nthat can correctly describe the electronic structure of this solar-cell\nmaterial. We have employed hybrid functional calculations to study the \\S3\n(112) and \\S3 (114) GBs in \\CISe\\ and \\CGSe. The electronic structure changes\nintroduced by the formation of GBs are threefold: creation of gap states, shift\nin band edges, and alteration of bandgap sizes. Gap states commonly behave as\nrecombination centers, but the band alignment and the change in the bandgap\nsize induced by GBs mitigate the destructive effect of these states in \\CISe.\nThat means, \\S3 \\ GBs are not detrimental for the carrier transport in devices\nbased on \\CISe. Conversely, these GBs are destructive for the carrier transport\nin \\CGSe. The different behaviors of the \\S3 \\ GBs in CISe and CGSe might be\nconsidered by experimentalists to optimize the device fabrication to achieve\nhigh-performance solar cells.\n", "  We study an autonomous quantum system which exhibits refrigeration under an\ninformation-work trade-off like a Maxwell demon. The system becomes correlated\nas a single \"demon\" qubit interacts sequentially with memory qubits while in\ncontact with two heat reservoirs of different temperatures. Using strong\nsubadditivity of the von Neumann entropy, we derive a global Clausius\ninequality to show thermodynamic advantages from access to correlated\ninformation. It is demonstrated, in a matrix product density operator\nformalism, that our demon can simultaneously realize refrigeration against a\nthermal gradient and erasure of information from its memory, which is\nimpossible without correlations. The phenomenon can be even enhanced by the\npresence of quantum coherence.\n", "  Based on the monitoring of the Dusty S-cluster Object (DSO/G2) during its\nclosest approach to the Galactic Center supermassive black hole in 2014 and\n2015 with ESO VLT/SINFONI, we further explore the model of a young, accreting\nstar to explain observed spectral and morphological features. The stellar\nscenario is supported by our findings, i.e. ionized-hydrogen emission from the\nDSO that remains spatially compact before and after the peribothron passage.\nThe detection of DSO/G2 object as a compact single-peak emission-line source is\nnot consistent with the original hypothesis of a core-less cloud that is\nnecessarily tidally stretched, hence producing a double-peak emission line\nprofile around the pericentre passage. This strengthens the evidence that the\nDSO/G2 source is a dust-enshrouded young star that appears to be in an\naccretion phase. The infall of material from the circumstellar disc onto the\nstellar surface can contribute significantly to the emission of Br$\\gamma$ line\nas well as the observed large line width of the order of 10 angstrom.\n", "  An appealing explanation for the Planck data is provided by inflationary\nmodels with a singular non-canonical kinetic term: a Laurent expansion of the\nkinetic function translates into a potential with a nearly shift-symmetric\nplateau in canonical fields. The shift symmetry can be broken at large field\nvalues by including higher-order poles, which need to be hierarchically\nsuppressed in order not to spoil the inflationary plateau. The herefrom\nresulting corrections to the inflationary dynamics and predictions are shown to\nbe universal at lowest order and possibly to induce power loss at large angular\nscales. At lowest order there are no corrections from a pole of just one order\nhigher and we argue that this phenomenon is related to the well-known extended\nno-scale structure arising in string theory scenarios. Finally, we outline\nwhich other corrections may arise from string loop effects.\n", "  The influence of power-law interactions on the dynamics of many-body systems\nfar from equilibrium is much less explored than their effect on static and\nthermodynamic properties. To gain insight into this problem we introduce and\nanalyze here an out-of-equilibrium deposition process in which the deposition\nrate of a given particle depends as a power-law on the distance to previously\ndeposited particles. This model draws its relevance from recent experimental\nprogress in the domain of cold atomic gases which are studied in a setting\nwhere atoms that are excited to high-lying Rydberg states interact through\npower-law potentials that translate into power-law excitation rates. The\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics of this system turns out to be surprisingly rich.\nIt features a self-similar evolution which leads to a characteristic power-law\ntime dependence of observables such as the particle concentration, and results\nin a scale invariance of the structure factor. Our findings show that in\ndissipative Rydberg gases out of equilibrium the characteristic distance among\nexcitations --- often referred to as the blockade radius --- is not a static\nbut rather a dynamic quantity.\n", "  A search is described for a Higgs boson decaying into two photons, one of\nwhich has an internal conversion to a muon or an electron pair (ll gamma). The\nanalysis is performed using proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The events selected have an\nopposite-sign muon or electron pair and a high transverse momentum photon. No\nexcess above background has been found in the three-body invariant mass range\n120 < m[ll gamma] < 150 GeV, and limits have been derived for the Higgs boson\nproduction cross section times branching fraction for the decay H to gamma*\ngamma to ll gamma, where the dilepton invariant mass is less than 20 GeV. For a\nHiggs boson with m[H] = 125 GeV, a 95% confidence level (CL) exclusion observed\n(expected) limit is 6.7 (5.9 +2.8/-1.8) times the standard model prediction.\nAdditionally, an upper limit at 95% CL on the branching fraction of H to J/Psi\ngamma for the 125 GeV Higgs boson is set at 1.5E-3.\n", "  We obtain analytic expressions for the time correlation functions of a liquid\nof spherical particles, exact in the limit of high dimensions $d$. The\nderivation is long but straightforward: a dynamic virial expansion for which\nonly the first two terms survive, followed by a change to generalized spherical\ncoordinates in the dynamic variables leading to saddle-point evaluation of\nintegrals for large $d$. The problem is thus mapped onto a one-dimensional\ndiffusion in a perturbed harmonic potential with colored noise. At high\ndensity, an ergodicity-breaking glass transition is found. In this regime, our\nresults agree with thermodynamics, consistently with the general Random First\nOrder Transition scenario. The glass transition density is higher than the best\nknown lower bound for hard sphere packings in large $d$. Because our\ncalculation is, if not rigorous, elementary, an improvement in the bound for\nsphere packings in large dimensions is at hand.\n", "  In the supplemental materials we justify our choice of the number of\nChebychev moments used within the kernel polynomial method, show some\npreliminary results for the large coupling behavior, discuss possible\ncorrelation effects in the local density of states, estimate the spin\nrelaxation length and introduce the goodness of fit probability that is used to\nassess the quality of the fits.\n", "  We summarize and extend our work on nonsupersymmetric solutions of a 5d\nconsistent truncation of type IIB supergravity, that is relevant for\ngauge/gravity duality. The fields in this 5d theory are the five-dimensional\nmetric and a set of scalars. We find solutions of the 5d equations of motion,\nwhich represent dS_4 foliations over the fifth (radial) dimension. In each\nsolution at least one scalar has a nontrivial radial profile. These scalars are\ninterpreted as glueballs in the dual gauge theory, living in 4d de Sitter\nspace. We explain why this lays a foundation for building gravity duals of\nglueball inflation models.\n", "  We develop numerical methods to calculate electron dynamics in crystalline\nsolids in real-time time-dependent density functional theory employing\nexchange-correlation potentials which reproduce band gap energies of\ndielectrics; a meta generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) proposed by\nTran and Blaha [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 226401 (2009)] (TBm-BJ) and a hybrid\nfunctional proposed by Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof [J. Chem. Phys. 118, 8207\n(2003)] (HSE). In time evolution calculations employing the TB-mBJ potential,\nwe have found it necessary to adopt a predictor-corrector step for stable\ntime-evolution. Since energy functional is not known for the TB-mBJ potential,\nwe propose a method to evaluate electronic excitation energy without referring\nto the energy functional. Calculations using the HSE hybrid functional is\ncomputationally expensive due to the nonlocal Fock-like term. We develop a\ncomputational method for the operation of the Fock-like term in Fourier space,\nfor which we employ massively parallel computers equipped with graphic\nprocessing units. To demonstrate significances of utilizing potentials\nproviding correct band gap energies, we compare electronic excitations induced\nby femtosecond laser pulses using the TB-mBJ, HSE, and a simple local density\napproximation (LDA). At low laser intensities, electronic excitations are found\nto be sensitive to the band gap energy: results using TB-mBJ and HSE are close\nto each other, while the excitation of the LDA calculation is more intensive\nthan the others. At high laser intensities close to a damage threshold, we have\nfound that electronic excitation energies are similar among the three cases.\n", "  Very recently, two hidden-charmed resonances $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$\nconsistent with pentaquark states were observed at the LHCb detector. The two\n$P_c$ states locate just below the $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^*_c$ and $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c$\nthresholds with mass of gaps about 5 and 15 MeV, respectively. Inspired by this\nfact we perform a dynamical investigation about the $\\bar{D}\\Sigma_c^*(2520)$\nand $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$ interactions which are described by the meson\nexchanges. A bound state which carries spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$ is produced from\nthe $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^*_c(2520)$ interaction, which is consistent with the\n$P_c(4380)$ observed at the LHCb detector. From the $D^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$\ninteraction, a bound state with $5/2^+$ is produced, which can be related to\nthe $P_c(4450)$. The results suggest that the $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$ are\ngood candidates of $\\bar{D}\\Sigma_c^*(2520)$ and $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c(2455)$\nmolecular states, respectively.\n", "  The local structure of liquid water as a function of temperature is a source\nof intense research. This structure is intimately linked to the dynamics of\nwater molecules, which can be measured using Raman and infrared spectroscopies.\nThe assignment of spectral peaks depends on whether they are collective modes\nor single molecule motions. Vibrational modes in liquids are usually considered\nto be associated to the motions of single molecules or small clusters. Using\nmolecular dynamics simulations we find dispersive optical phonon-like modes in\nthe librational and OH stretching bands. We argue that on subpicosecond time\nscales these modes propagate through water's hydrogen bond network over\ndistances of up to two nanometers. In the long wavelength limit these optical\nmodes exhibit longitudinal-transverse splitting, indicating the presence of\ncoherent long range dipole-dipole interactions, as in ice. Our results indicate\nthe dynamics of liquid water have more similarities to ice than previously\nthought.\n", "  The chiral anomaly-induced negative magnetoresistance and non-trivial Berry\nphase are two fundamental transport properties associated with the topological\nproperties of Weyl fermions. In this work, we report the quantum transport of\nTaP single crystals in magnetic field up to 31T. Through the analyses of our\nmagnetotransport data, we show TaP has the signatures of a Weyl state,\nincluding light effective quasiparticle masses, ultrahigh carrier mobility, as\nwell as negative longitudinal magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we have\ngeneralized the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula for Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\noscillations with multi-frequencies, and determined the non-trivial Berry phase\nof Pi for multiple Fermi pockets in TaP through the direct fitting of the\nquantum oscillations. In high fields, we also probed signatures of Zeeman\nsplitting, from which the Land\\'e g-factor is extracted.\n", "  We revisit the long time dynamics of the spherical fully connected $p =\n2$-spin glass model when the number of spins $N$ is large but {\\it finite}. At\n$T=0$ where the system is in a (trivial) spin-glass phase, and on long time\nscale $t \\gtrsim {\\cal O}{(N^{2/3})}$ we show that the behavior of physical\nobservables, like the energy, correlation and response functions, is controlled\nby the density of near-extreme eigenvalues at the edge of the spectrum of the\ncoupling matrix $J$, and are thus non self-averaging. We show that the late\ntime decay of these observables, once averaged over the disorder, is controlled\nby new universal exponents which we compute exactly.\n", "  The paper gives full details of the computation within the canonical\nformalism of Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner of the local-in-time part of the\nfourth post-Newtonian, i.e. of power eight in one over speed of light,\nconservative Hamiltonian of spinless compact binary systems. The Hamiltonian\ndepends only on the bodies' positions and momenta. Dirac delta distributions\nare taken as source functions. Their full control is furnished by dimensional\ncontinuation, by means of which the occurring ultraviolet (UV) divergences are\nuniquely regularized. The applied near-zone expansion of the time-symmetric\nGreen function leads to infrared (IR) divergences. Their analytic\nregularization results in one single ambiguity parameter. Unique fixation of it\nwas successfully performed in T.Damour, P.Jaranowski, and G.Sch\\\"afer, Phys.\nRev. D 89, 064058 (2014) through far-zone matching. Technically as well as\nconceptually (backscatter binding energy), the level of the Lamb shift in\nquantum electrodynamics is reached. In a first run a computation of all terms\nis performed in three-dimensional space using analytic Riesz-Hadamard\nregularization techniques. Then divergences are treated locally (i.e., around\nparticles' positions for UV and in the vicinity of spatial infinity for IR\ndivergences) by means of combined dimensional and analytic regularization.\nVarious evolved analytic expressions are presented for the first time. The\nbreakdown of the Leibniz rule for distributional derivatives is addressed as\nwell as the in general nondistributive law when regularizing value of products\nof functions evaluated at their singular point.\n", "  The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has experienced tremendous advances and\nbeen well accepted as a popular method of simulation of various fluid flow\nmechanisms on pore scale in tight formations. With the introduction of an\neffective relaxation time and slip boundary conditions, the LBM has been\nsuccessfully extended to solve micro-gaseous related transport and phenomena.\nAs gas flow in shale matrix is mostly in the slip flow and transition flow\nregimes, given the difficulties of experimental techniques to determine\nextremely low permeability, it appears that the computational methods\nespecially the LBM can be an attractive choice for simulation of these\nmicro-gaseous flows. In this paper an extensive overview on a number of\nrelaxation time and boundary conditions used in LBM-like models for\nmicro-gaseous flow are carried out and their advantages and disadvantages are\ndiscussed. Furthermore, potential application of the LBM in flow simulation in\nshale gas reservoirs on pore scale and representative elementary volume(REV)\nscale is evaluated and summarised. Our review indicates that the LBM is capable\nof capturing gas flow in continuum to slip flow regimes which cover significant\nproportion of the pores in shale gas reservoirs and identifies opportunities\nfor future research.\n", "  In this paper we re-investigate the Bogoliubov transformations which relate\nthe Minkowski inertial vacuum to the vacuum of an accelerated observer. We\nimplement the transformation using a non-unitary operator used in formulations\nof irreversible systems by Prigogine. We derive a Lyapunov function which\nsignifies an irreversible time flow. We extend the formalism to the black hole\nspace-time which has similar near-horizon geometry of an accelerated observer,\nand in addition show that thermalization is due to presence of black hole and\nwhite hole regions. Finally we discuss an attempt to generalize quantum field\ntheory for accelerated frames using this new connection to Prigogine\ntransformations.\n", "  We present an exact diagonalization study of the breathing mode collective\nexcitations for a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate of $N=10$ spinless bosons\ninteracting via repulsive finite-range Gaussian potential and harmonically\nconfined in quasi-two-dimension. The yrast state and the low-lying excited\nstates are variationally obtained in given subspaces of the quantized total\nangular momentum $L$ employing the beyond lowest Landau level approximation in\nslowly rotating regime with $0 \\le L < 2N$. For a given $L$, the low-energy\neigenspectra (bands) are obtained in weakly to moderately interacting regime.\nFurther, for a given interaction, the split in low-lying eigenenergies with\nincreasing $L$ is the precursor to spontaneous symmetry breaking of the\naxisymmetry associated with the entry of the first vortex. With increase in\nrepulsive interaction, the value of the first breathing mode increases for\nstable total angular momentum states $L=0~\\mbox{and}~N$, but decreases for\nintermediate $0<L<N$ metastable states. The position of the observed first\nbreathing modes in the eigenspectrum remains unchanged as the interaction is\nvaried over several orders of magnitude.\n", "  Following the recent theory of Lovelock-Brans-Dicke gravity, we continue to\ninvestigate the conditions to support traversable wormholes by the\ngravitational effects of spacetime parity and topology, which arise from the\nnonminimal couplings of a background scalar field to the Chern-Pontryagin\ndensity and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The flaring-out condition indicates\nthat a Morris-Thorne-type wormhole can be maintained by violating the\ngeneralized null energy condition, and thus also breaking down the generalized\nweak, strong, and dominant energy conditions; meanwhile, analyses of the\nzero-tidal-force solution show that the standard null energy condition in\ngeneral relativity can still be respected by the physical matter threading the\nwormhole. This way, the two topological effects have to dominate over the\nordinary-matter source of gravity, and the scalar field is preferred to be\nnoncanonical. By treating Brans-Dicke gravity as a reduced situation of\nLovelock-Brans-Dicke gravity, we also examine the Brans-Dicke wormholes and\nenergy conditions.\n", "  The D0 collaboration at FermiLab has recently measured the top-quark pair\nforward-backward asymmetry in $\\bar p p \\to t \\bar{t} X$ reactions as a\nfunction of the $t\\bar{t} $ invariant mass $M_{t\\bar{t}}$. The D0 result for\n$A_{\\rm FB}(M_{t\\bar{t}}>650\\, {\\rm GeV})$ is smaller than $A_{\\rm\nFB}(M_{t\\bar{t}})$ obtained for small values of $M_{t\\bar{t}}$, which may\nindicate an \"increasing-decreasing\" behavior for $A_{\\rm\nFB}(M_{t\\bar{t}}>M_{\\rm cut})$. This behavior is not explained using\nconventional renormalization scale-setting, even by a next-to-next-to-leading\norder (N$^2$LO) QCD calculation -- one predicts a monotonically increasing\nbehavior. In the conventional scale-setting method, one simply guesses a single\nrenormalization scale $\\mu_r$ for the argument of the QCD running coupling and\nthen varies it over an arbitrary range. However, the conventional method has\ninherent difficulties. ...... In contrast, if one fixes the scale using the\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), the resulting pQCD predictions are\nrenormalization-scheme independent since all of the scheme-dependent\n$\\{\\beta_i\\}$-terms in the QCD perturbative series are resummed into the QCD\nrunning couplings at each order. ...... In this paper we show that if one\napplies the PMC to determine the top versus anti-top quark forward-backward\nasymmetry by properly using the pQCD predictions up to N$^2$LO level, one\nobtains the predictions without renormalization scheme or scale ambiguities.\n...... In addition, the PMC prediction for $A_{\\rm FB}(M_{t\\bar{t}}> M_{\\rm\ncut})$ shows an \"increasing-decreasing\" behavior for increasing values of\n$M_{\\rm cut}$ which is not observed in the NLO and N$^2$LO predictions for\n$A_{\\rm FB}(M_{t\\bar{t}}> M_{\\rm cut})$ with conventional scale-setting. This\nbehavior could be tested by the future more precise measurements at the LHC.\n", "  The quest for a quantitative characterization of community and modular\nstructure of complex networks produced a variety of methods and algorithms to\nclassify different networks. However, it is not clear if such methods provide\nconsistent, robust and meaningful results when considering hierarchies as a\nwhole. Part of the problem is the lack of a similarity measure for the\ncomparison of hierarchical community structures. In this work we give a\ncontribution by introducing the {\\it hierarchical mutual information}, which is\na generalization of the traditional mutual information, and allows to compare\nhierarchical partitions and hierarchical community structures. The {\\it\nnormalized} version of the hierarchical mutual information should behave\nanalogously to the traditional normalized mutual information. Here, the correct\nbehavior of the hierarchical mutual information is corroborated on an extensive\nbattery of numerical experiments. The experiments are performed on artificial\nhierarchies, and on the hierarchical community structure of artificial and\nempirical networks. Furthermore, the experiments illustrate some of the\npractical applications of the hierarchical mutual information. Namely, the\ncomparison of different community detection methods, and the study of the\nconsistency, robustness and temporal evolution of the hierarchical modular\nstructure of networks.\n", "  We present methods for efficient characterization of an optical coherent\nstate $|\\alpha\\rangle$. We choose measurement settings adaptively and\nstochastically, based on data while it is collected. Our algorithm divides the\nestimation into two distinct steps: (i) before the first detection of a vacuum\nstate, the probability of choosing a measurement setting is proportional to\ndetecting vacuum with the setting, which makes using too similar measurement\nsettings twice unlikely; and (ii) after the first detection of vacuum, we focus\nmeasurements in the region where vacuum is most likely to be detected. In step\n(i) [(ii)] the detection of vacuum (a photon) has a significantly larger effect\non the shape of the posterior probability distribution of $\\alpha$. Compared to\nnonadaptive schemes, our method makes the number of measurement shots required\nto achieve a certain level of accuracy smaller approximately by a factor\nproportional to the area describing the initial uncertainty of $\\alpha$ in\nphase space. While this algorithm is not directly robust against readout\nerrors, we make it such by introducing repeated measurements in step (i).\n", "  We measure the fundamental noise processes associated with a continuous\nlinear position measurement of a micromechanical membrane incorporated in a\nmicrowave cavity optomechanical circuit. We observe the trade-off between the\ntwo fundamental sources of noises that enforce the standard quantum limit: the\nmeasurement imprecision and radiation-pressure backaction from photon shot\nnoise. We demonstrate that the quantum backaction of the measurement can\noverwhelm the intrinsic thermal motion by 24 dB, entering a new regime for\ncavity optomechanical systems.\n", "  Motivated by recent synthesis of the hyper-honeycomb material\n$\\beta$-$\\mathrm{Li_2 Ir O_3}$, we study the dynamical structure factor (DSF)\nof the corresponding 3D Kitaev quantum spin-liquid (QSL), whose fractionalised\ndegrees of freedom are Majorana fermions and emergent flux-loops. Properties of\nthis 3D model are known to differ in important ways from those of its 2D\ncounterpart -- it has finite-temperature phase transition, as well as distinct\nfeatures in Raman response. We show, however, that the qualitative behaviour of\nthe DSF is broadly dimension-independent. Characteristics of the 3D DSF include\na response gap even in the gapless QSL phase and an energy dependence deriving\nfrom the Majorana fermion density of states. Since the majority of the response\nis from states containing a single Majorana excitation, our results suggest\ninelastic neutron scattering as the spectroscopy of choice to illuminate the\nphysics of Majorana fermions in Kitaev QSLs.\n", "  We derive a new class of supersymmetric D3/D7 brane configurations, which\nallow to holographically describe N=4 SYM coupled to massive N=2 flavor degrees\nof freedom on spaces of constant curvature. We systematically solve the\n$\\kappa$-symmetry condition for D7-brane embeddings into AdS$_4$-sliced\nAdS$_5\\times$S$^5$, and find supersymmetric embeddings in a simple closed form.\nUp to a critical mass, these embeddings come in surprisingly diverse families,\nand we present a first study of their (holographic) phenomenology. We carry out\nthe holographic renormalization, compute the one-point functions and attempt a\nfield-theoretic interpretation of the different families. To complete the\ncatalog of supersymmetric D3/D7 configurations, we construct analogous\nembeddings for flavored N=4 SYM on S$^4$ and dS$_4$.\n", "  Hyperbolic plasmonic metamaterials provide numerous opportunities for\ndesigning unusual linear and nonlinear optical properties. We show that the\nmodal overlap of fundamental and second-harmonic light in an anisotropic\nplasmonic metamaterial slab results in the broadband enhancement of radiated\nsecond-harmonic intensity by up to 2 orders of magnitudes for TM- and\nTE-polarized fundamental light, compared to a smooth Au film under TM-polarised\nillumination. The results open up possibilities to design tuneable\nfrequency-doubling metamaterial with the goal to overcome limitations\nassociated with classical phase matching conditions in thick nonlinear\ncrystals.\n", "  Working in the Large Volume Scenario (LVS) of IIB Calabi-Yau flux\ncompactifications, we construct inflationary models from recently computed\nhigher derivative $(\\alpha')^3$-corrections. Inflation is driven by a Kaehler\nmodulus whose potential arises from the aforementioned corrections, while we\nuse the inclusion of string loop effects just to ensure the existence of a\ngraceful exit when necessary. The effective inflaton potential takes a\nStarobinsky-type form $V=V_0(1-e^{-\\nu\\phi})^2$, where we obtain one set-up\nwith $\\nu=-1/\\sqrt{3}$ and one with $\\nu=2/\\sqrt{3}$ corresponding to inflation\noccurring for increasing or decreasing $\\phi$ respectively. The inflationary\nobservables are thus in perfect agreement with PLANCK, while the two scenarios\nremain observationally distinguishable via slightly varying predictions for the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Both set-ups yield $r\\simeq (2\\ldots 7)\\,\\times\n10^{-3}$. They hence realise inflation with moderately large fields\n$\\left(\\Delta\\phi\\sim 6\\thinspace M_{Pl}\\right)$ without saturating the Lyth\nbound. Control over higher corrections relies in part on tuning underlying\nmicroscopic parameters, and in part on intrinsic suppressions. The intrinsic\npart of control arises as a leftover from an approximate effective shift\nsymmetry at parametrically large volume.\n", "  Lack of a consistent metric for generating rotating wormholes motivates us to\npresent a new one endowed with interesting physical and geometrical properties.\nWhen combined with the generalized method of superposition of fields, which\nconsists in attaching a form of matter to each moving frame, it generates\nmassive and charged (charge without charge) two-fluid-sourced, massive and\ntwo-charged three-fluid-sourced, rotating as well as new static wormholes\nwhich, otherwise, can hardly be derived by integration. If the lapse function\nof the static wormhole is bounded from above, no closed timelike curves occur\nin the rotating counterpart. For positive energy densities dying out faster\nthan $1/r$, the angular velocity includes in its expansion a correction term,\nto the leading one that corresponds to ordinary stars, proportional to $\\ln\nr/r^4$. Such a term is not present in the corresponding expansion for the\nKerr-Newman black hole. Based on this observation and our previous work, the\ndragging effects of falling neutral objects may constitute a substitute for\nother known techniques used for testing the nature of the rotating black hole\ncandidates that are harbored in the center of galaxies. We discuss the\npossibility of generating ($n+1$)-fluid-sourced, $n$-charged, rotating as well\nas static wormholes.\n", "  We point out that, for Dirac neutrinos, in addition to the standard thermal\ncosmic neutrino background (C$\\nu$B) there could also exist a non-thermal\nneutrino background with comparable number density. As the right-handed\ncomponents are essentially decoupled from the thermal bath of standard model\nparticles, relic neutrinos with a non-thermal distribution may exist until\ntoday. The relic density of the non-thermal (nt) background can be constrained\nby the usual observational bounds on the effective number of massless degrees\nof freedom $N_\\mathrm{eff}$, and can be as large as\n$n_{\\nu_{\\mathrm{nt}}}\\lesssim 0.5\\,n_\\gamma$. In particular, $N_\\mathrm{eff}$\ncan be larger than 3.046 in the absence of any exotic states. Non-thermal relic\nneutrinos constitute an irreducible contribution to the detection of the\nC$\\nu$B, and, hence, may be discovered by future experiments such as PTOLEMY.\nWe also present a scenario of chaotic inflation in which a non-thermal\nbackground can naturally be generated by inflationary preheating. The\nnon-thermal relic neutrinos, thus, may constitute a novel window into the very\nearly universe.\n", "  We study one-dimensional anisotropic XY-Heisenberg spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chain\nwith weak random fields $h_i^z S^z_i$ by means of Jordan-Wigner transformation\nto spinless Luttinger liquid with disorder and bosonization technique. First we\ninvestigate phase diagram of the system in terms of dimensionless disorder\n$\\gamma = \\left<h^2\\right>/J^2 \\ll 1$ and anisotropy parameter $\\Delta =\nJ_z/J_{xy}$ and find the range of these parameters where disorder is irrelevant\nin the infrared limit and spin-spin correlations are described by power laws.\nThen we use the diagram technique in terms of plasmon excitations to study\nlow-temperature behavior of heat conductivity $\\kappa$ and spin conductivity\n$\\sigma$ in this power-law phase. The obtained Lorentz number $L \\equiv\n\\kappa/\\sigma T$ differs from the value derived earlier by means of memory\nfunction method. We argue also that in the studied region inelastic scattering\nis strong enough to suppress quantum interference in the low-temperature limit.\n", "  Using the Anyon-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we analyze the ground-state properties\nof anyons in a one-dimensional lattice. To this end we map the hopping dynamics\nof correlated anyons to an occupation-dependent hopping Bose-Hubbard model\nusing the fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation. In particular, we calculate\nthe quasi-momentum distribution of anyons, which interpolates between\nBose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Analytically, we apply a modified\nGutzwiller mean-field approach, which goes beyond a classical one by including\nthe influence of the fractional phase of anyons within the many-body\nwavefunction. Numerically, we use the density-matrix renormalization group by\nrelying on the ansatz of matrix product states. As a result it turns out that\nthe anyonic quasi-momentum distribution reveals both a peak-shift and an\nasymmetry which mainly originates from the nonlocal string property. In\naddition, we determine the corresponding quasi-momentum distribution of the\nJordan-Wigner transformed bosons, where, in contrast to the hard-core case, we\nalso observe an asymmetry for the soft-core case, which strongly depends on the\nparticle number density.\n", "  For the investigation of chemical reaction networks, the efficient and\naccurate determination of all relevant intermediates and elementary reactions\nis mandatory. The complexity of such a network may grow rapidly, in particular\nif reactive species are involved that might cause a myriad of side reactions.\nWithout automation, a complete investigation of complex reaction mechanisms is\ntedious and possibly unfeasible. Therefore, only the expected dominant reaction\npaths of a chemical reaction network (e.g., a catalytic cycle or an enzymatic\ncascade) are usually explored in practice. Here, we present a computational\nprotocol that constructs such networks in a parallelized and automated manner.\nMolecular structures of reactive complexes are generated based on heuristic\nrules derived from conceptual electronic-structure theory and subsequently\noptimized by quantum chemical methods to produce stable intermediates of an\nemerging reaction network. Pairs of intermediates in this network that might be\nrelated by an elementary reaction according to some structural similarity\nmeasure are then automatically detected and subjected to an automated search\nfor the connecting transition state. The results are visualized as an\nautomatically generated network graph, from which a comprehensive picture of\nthe mechanism of a complex chemical process can be obtained that greatly\nfacilitates the analysis of the whole network. We apply our protocol to the\nSchrock dinitrogen-fixation catalyst to study alternative pathways of catalytic\nammonia production.\n", "  We present the theoretical study of the process\n$\\chi_{c0}(1P)\\to\\bar\\Sigma\\Sigma\\pi $ decay, by taking into account the\n$\\pi\\Sigma$ and $\\pi\\bar\\Sigma$ final state interactions of the final\nmeson-baryon pair based on the chiral unitary approach. We show that the\nprocess filters the isospin $I=1$ in the $\\pi\\Sigma$ channel and offers a\nreaction to test the existence of an $I=1$ state with strangeness $S=-1$ and\nspin-parity $J^p=1/2^-$ around the $\\bar KN$ threshold predicted by some\ntheories and supported by some experiments.\n", "  We investigate the orbital origin of the Fano-Kondo line shapes measured in\nSTM spectroscopy of magnetic adatoms on metal substrates. To this end we\ncalculate the low-bias tunnel spectra of a Co adatom on the (001) and (111) Cu\nsurfaces with our density functional theory-based ab initio transport scheme\naugmented by local correlations. In order to associate different $d$-orbitals\nwith different Fano line shapes we only correlate individual $3d$-orbitals\ninstead of the full Co $3d$-shell. We find that Kondo peaks arising in\ndifferent $d$-levels indeed give rise to different Fano features in the\nconductance spectra. Hence the shape of measured Fano features allows to draw\nsome conclusions about the orbital responsible for the Kondo resonance,\nalthough the actual shape is also influenced by temperature, effective\ninteraction and charge fluctuations. Comparison with a simplified model shows\nthat line shapes are mostly the result of interference between tunneling paths\nthrough the correlated $d$-orbital and the $sp$-type orbitals on the Co atom.\nVery importantly, the amplitudes of the Fano features vary strongly among\norbitals, with the $3z^2$-orbital featuring by far the largest amplitude due to\nits strong direct coupling to the $s$-type conduction electrons.\n", "  We discuss geometrical picture of hadron interactions and, in particular, the\npresence of energy--invariant edge in elastic scattering resulting from a\ntransition to the reflective scattering mode which is supported by the recent\nLHC data. The energy-invariant edge represents a black ring around the\nreflecting disk.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theoretical study of thermodynamic properties of\nsuperconductors with a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities, with focus\non how the properties of the superconducting host change if the magnetic\nmoments of the impurities order ferromagnetically. Scattering off the magnetic\nimpurities leads to the formation of a band of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states within\nthe superconducting energy gap that drastically influences superconductivity.\nIn the magnetically ordered system, the magnetization displays a sudden drop as\nfunction of impurity density or magnetic moment amplitude. The drop occurs as\nthe spin-polarized impurity band crosses the Fermi level and is associated with\na quantum phase transition first put forward by Sakurai for the single impurity\ncase. Taking into account that the background magnetic field created by the\nordered impurity moments enters as a Zeeman shift, we find that the\nsuperconducting phase transition changes from second order to first order for\nhigh enough impurity concentration.\n", "  If kinematically accessible, hadron collider experiments provide an ideal\nlaboratory for the direct production of heavy lepton partners in Seesaw models.\nIn the context of the Type III Seesaw Mechanism, the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$\nrate and shape corrections are presented for the pair production of\nhypothetical, heavy $SU(2)_L$ triplet leptons in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$\n13, 14, and 100 TeV. The next-to-leading order (NLO) $K$-factors span,\napproximately, $K^{NLO}=1.1 - 1.4$ for both charged current and neutral current\nprocesses over a triplet mass range $m_T = 100~\\text{GeV}-2~\\text{TeV}$. Total\nproduction cross sections exhibit a $^{+5\\%}_{-6\\%}$ scale dependence at 14 TeV\nand $\\pm1\\%$ at 100 TeV. The NLO differential $K$-factors for heavy lepton\nkinematics are largely flat, suggesting that na\\\"ive scaling by the total\n$K^{NLO}$ is reasonably justified. The resummed transverse momentum\ndistribution of the dilepton system is presented at leading logarithmic (LL)\naccuracy. The effects of resummation are large in TeV-scale dilepton systems.\nDiscovery potential to heavy lepton pairs at 14 and 100 TeV is briefly\nexplored: At the High-Luminosity LHC, we estimate a $4.8-6.3\\sigma$ discovery\npotential maximally for $m_T = 1.5-1.6~\\text{TeV}$ after 3000 fb$^{-1}$. With\n300 (3000) fb$^{-1}$, there is $2\\sigma$ sensitivity up to $m_T =\n1.3-1.4~\\text{TeV}~(1.7-1.8~\\text{TeV})$ in the individual channels. At 100 TeV\nand with 10 fb$^{-1}$, a $5\\sigma$ discovery can be achieved for\n$m_T=1.4-1.6~\\text{TeV}$. Due to the factorization properties of Drell-Yan-type\nsystems, the fixed order and resummed calculations reduce to convolutions over\ntree-level quantities.\n", "  We investigate the localization properties of atoms moving in a\nthree-dimensional optical lattice in the presence of an uncorrelated disorder\npotential having the same probability distribution $P(V)$ as laser speckles. We\nfind that the disorder-averaged (single-particle) Green's function, calculated\nvia the coherent potential approximation, is in very good agreement with exact\nnumerics. Using the transfer-matrix method, we compute the phase diagram in the\nenergy-disorder plane and show that its peculiar shape can be understood from\nthe self-consistent theory of localization. In particular, we recover the large\nasymmetry in the position of the mobility edge for blue and red speckles, which\nwas recently observed numerically for correlated speckle potentials.\n", "  We take a two-step theoretical approach to study magnetism of rare earth\nquasicrystals by considering Ising spins on quasiperiodic tilings, coupled via\nRKKY interactions. First, we compute RKKY interactions from a tight-binding\nHamiltonian defined on the two-dimensional quasiperiodic tilings. We find that\nthe magnetic interactions are frustrated and strongly dependent on the local\nenvironment. This results in the formation of clusters with strong bonds at\ncertain patterns of the tilings that repeat quasiperiodically. Second, we\nexamine the statistical mechanics of Ising spins with these RKKY interactions,\nusing extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although models that have frustrated\ninteractions and lack translational invariance might be expected to display\nspin glass behaviour, we show that the spin system has a phase transition to\nlow-temperature states with long-range quasiperiodic magnetic order.\nAdditionally, we find that in some of the systems spin clusters can fluctuate\nmuch below the ordering temperature.\n", "  Using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) that includes both initial\npartonic and hadronic interactions, we study neighboring bin multiplicity\ncorrelations as a function of pseudorapidity in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7-62.4$ GeV. It is observed that for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} <\n$19.6GeV Au+Au collisions, the short-range correlations of final particles have\na trough at central pseudorapidity, while for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} > $19.6GeV AuAu\ncollisions, the short-range correlations of final particles have a peak at\ncentral pseudorapidity. Our findings indicate that the pseudorapidity\ndependence of short-range correlations should contain some new physical\ninformation, and are not a simple result of the pseudorapidity distribution of\nfinal particles. The AMPT results with and without hadronic scattering are\ncompared. It is found that hadron scattering can only increase the short-range\ncorrelations to some level, but is not responsible for the different\ncorrelation shapes for different energies. Further study shows that the\ndifferent pseudorapidity dependence of short-range correlations are mainly due\nto partonic evolution and the following hadronization scheme.\n", "  In baseball games, the coefficient of restitution of baseballs strongly\naffects the flying distance of batted balls, which determines the home-run\nprobability. In Japan, the range of the coefficient of restitution of official\nbaseballs has changed frequently over the past five years, causing the the\nnumber of home runs to vary drastically. We analyzed data from Japanese\nbaseball games played in 2014 to investigate the statistical properties of\npitched balls. In addition, we used the analysis results to develop a\nbaseball-batting simulator for determining the home-run probability as a\nfunction of the coefficient of restitution. Our simulation results are\nexplained by a simple theoretical argument.\n", "  We discuss some of the effects of twisted boundary conditions in finite\nvolume using continuum SU(3) Chiral Perturbation Theory. We point out how\nbroken cubic symmetry affects the definitions of quantities such as\nform-factors. Using the $\\pi^+$ as an example, we give one loop results for the\nmass, decay constants and electromagnetic form-factor and illustrate how the\nrelevant Ward identities are satisfied.\n", "  Learning quantum mechanics is challenging, even for upper-level undergraduate\nand graduate students. Interactive tutorials which build on students' prior\nknowledge can be useful tools to enhance student learning. We have been\ninvestigating student difficulties with the quantum mechanics pertaining to the\ndouble-slit experiment in various situations. Here we discuss the development\nand evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial (QuILT) which makes\nuse of an interactive simulation to improve student understanding. We summarize\ncommon difficulties and discuss the extent to which the QuILT is effective in\naddressing them in two types of courses.\n", "  One attribute of experts is that they are likely to learn from their own\nmistakes. Experts are unlikely to make the same mistakes when asked to solve a\nproblem a second time, especially if they had access to a correct solution.\nHere, we discuss a study spanning several years in which advanced undergraduate\nphysics students in a quantum mechanics course were given incentives to correct\ntheir mistakes in the midterm exam and they could get back up to 50% of the\npoints lost on each midterm exam problem. The solutions to the midterm exam\nproblems were provided to all students in both groups but those who corrected\ntheir mistakes were provided the solution after they submitted their\ncorrections to the instructor. The performance on the final exam on the same\nproblems suggests that students who were given incentives to correct their\nmistakes significantly outperformed those who were not given an incentive. The\nincentive to correct mistakes had the greatest impact on the final exam\nperformance of students who performed poorly on the midterm exam.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems with parity-time (PT) symmetric complex potentials can\nexhibit a phase transition when the degree of non-Hermiticity is increased. Two\neigenstates coalesce at a transition point, which is known as the exceptional\npoint (EP) for a discrete spectrum and spectral singularity for a continuous\nspectrum. The existence of an EP is known to give rise to a great variety of\nnovel behaviors in various fields of physics. In this work, we study the\ncomplex band structures of one-dimensional photonic crystals with PT symmetric\ncomplex potentials by setting up a Hamiltonian using the Bloch states of the\nphotonic crystal without loss or gain as a basis. As a function of the degree\nof non-Hermiticity, two types of PT symmetry transitions are found. One is that\na PT-broken phase can re-enter into a PT-exact phase at a higher degree of\nnon-Hermiticity. The other is that two spectral singularities, one originating\nfrom the Brillouin zone center and the other from the Brillouin zone boundary,\ncan coalesce at some k-point in the interior of the Brillouin zone and create a\nsingularity of higher order. Furthermore, we can induce a band inversion by\ntuning the filling ratio of the photonic crystal, and we find that the\ngeometric phases of the bands before and after the inversion are independent of\nthe amount of non-Hermiticity as long as the PT-exact phase is not broken. The\nstandard concept of topological transition can hence be extended to\nnon-Hermitian systems.\n", "  We study critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse of a radiation\nfluid. We perform numerical simulations in both spherical symmetry and\naxisymmetry, and observe critical scaling in both supercritical evolutions,\nwhich lead to the formation of a black hole, and subcritical evolutions, in\nwhich case the fluid disperses to infinity and leaves behind flat space. We\nidentify the critical solution in spherically symmetric collapse, find evidence\nfor its universality, and study the approach to this critical solution in the\nabsence of spherical symmetry. For the cases that we consider, aspherical\ndeviations from the spherically symmetric critical solution decay in damped\noscillations in a manner that is consistent with the behavior found by Gundlach\nin perturbative calculations. Our simulations are performed with an\nunconstrained evolution code, implemented in spherical polar coordinates, and\nadopting \"moving-puncture\" coordinates.\n", "  The decay rate of aftershocks has been modeled as a power law since the\npioneering work of Omori in the late nineteenth century. Considered the second\nmost fundamental empirical law after the Gutenberg-Richter relationship, the\npower law paradigm has rarely been challenged by the seismological community.\nBy taking a view of aftershock research not biased by prior conceptions of\nOmori power law decay and by applying statistical methods recommended in\napplied mathematics, I show that all aftershock sequences tested in three\nregional earthquake catalogs (Southern and Northern California, Taiwan) and\nwith three declustering techniques (nearest-neighbor, second-order moment,\nwindow methods) follow a stretched exponential instead of a power law. These\nresults infer that aftershocks are due to a simpler relaxation process than\noriginally thought, in accordance with most other relaxation processes observed\nin Nature.\n", "  We update the predictions of the SU(2) baryon chiral perturbation theory for\nthe dipole polarisabilities of the proton,\n$\\{\\alpha_{E1},\\,\\beta_{M1}\\}_p=\\{11.2(0.7),\\,3.9(0.7)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^3$,\nand obtain the corresponding predictions for the quadrupole, dispersive, and\nspin polarisabilities:\n$\\{\\alpha_{E2},\\,\\beta_{M2}\\}_p=\\{17.3(3.9),\\,-15.5(3.5)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$,\n$\\{\\alpha_{E1\\nu},\\,\\beta_{M1\\nu}\\}_p=\\{-1.3(1.0),\\,7.1(2.5)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$,\nand\n$\\{\\gamma_{E1E1},\\,\\gamma_{M1M1},\\,\\gamma_{E1M2},\\,\\gamma_{M1E2}\\}_p=\\{-3.3(0.8),\\,2.9(1.5),\\,0.2(0.2),\\,1.1(0.3)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^4$.\nThe results for the scalar polarisabilities are in significant disagreement\nwith semi-empirical analyses based on dispersion relations, however the results\nfor the spin polarisabilities agree remarkably well. Results for proton\nCompton-scattering multipoles and polarised observables up to the Delta(1232)\nresonance region are presented too. The asymmetries $\\Sigma_3$ and\n$\\Sigma_{2x}$ reproduce the experimental data from LEGS and MAMI. Results for\n$\\Sigma_{2z}$ agree with a recent sum rule evaluation in the forward\nkinematics. The asymmetry $\\Sigma_{1z}$ near the pion production threshold\nshows a large sensitivity to chiral dynamics, but no data is available for this\nobservable. We also provide the predictions for the polarisabilities of the\nneutron:\n$\\{\\alpha_{E1},\\,\\beta_{M1}\\}_n=\\{13.7(3.1),\\,4.6(2.7)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^3$,\n$\\{\\alpha_{E2},\\,\\beta_{M2}\\}_n=\\{16.2(3.7),\\,-15.8(3.6)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$,\n$\\{\\alpha_{E1\\nu},\\,\\beta_{M1\\nu}\\}_n=\\{0.1(1.0),\\,7.2(2.5)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^5$,\nand\n$\\{\\gamma_{E1E1},\\,\\gamma_{M1M1},\\,\\gamma_{E1M2},\\,\\gamma_{M1E2}\\}_n=\\{-4.7(1.1),\\,2.9(1.5),\\,0.2(0.2),\\,1.6(0.4)\\}\\times10^{-4}$fm$^4$.\nThe neutron dynamical polarisabilities and multipoles are examined too. We also\ndiscuss subtleties related to matching dynamical and static polarisabilities.\n", "  We provide an updated recommendation for the usage of sets of parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) and the assessment of PDF and PDF+$\\alpha_s$\nuncertainties suitable for applications at the LHC Run II. We review\ndevelopments since the previous PDF4LHC recommendation, and discuss and compare\nthe new generation of PDFs, which include substantial information from\nexperimental data from the Run I of the LHC. We then propose a new prescription\nfor the combination of a suitable subset of the available PDF sets, which is\npresented in terms of a single combined PDF set. We finally discuss tools which\nallow for the delivery of this combined set in terms of optimized sets of\nHessian eigenvectors or Monte Carlo replicas, and their usage, and provide some\nexamples of their application to LHC phenomenology.\n", "  A search for a light charged Higgs boson, originating from the decay of a top\nquark and subsequently decaying into a charm quark and a strange antiquark, is\npresented. The data used in the analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity\nof 19.7 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8\nTeV by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is performed in the process t\nt-bar to W+/- b H-/+ b-bar, where the W boson decays to a lepton (electron or\nmuon) and a neutrino. The decays lead to a final state comprising an isolated\nlepton, at least four jets and large missing transverse energy. No significant\ndeviation is observed in the data with respect to the standard model\npredictions, and model-independent upper limits are set on the branching\nfraction B(t to H+ b), ranging from 1.2 to 6.5% for a charged Higgs boson with\nmass between 90 and 160 GeV, under the assumption that B(H+ to c s-bar) = 100%.\n", "  We study the direct calculation of total energy derivatives for lattice\ndynamics and electron-phonon coupling calculations using supercell matrices\nwith non-zero off-diagonal elements. We show that it is possible to determine\nthe response of a periodic system to a perturbation characterized by a wave\nvector with reduced fractional coordinates $(m_1/n_1,m_2/n_2,m_3/n_3)$ using a\nsupercell containing a number of primitive cells equal to the least common\nmultiple of $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$. If only diagonal supercell matrices are\nused, a supercell containing $n_1n_2n_3$ primitive cells is required. We\ndemonstrate that the use of non-diagonal supercells significantly reduces the\ncomputational cost of obtaining converged zero-point energies and phonon\ndispersions for diamond and graphite. We also perform electron-phonon coupling\ncalculations using the direct method to sample the vibrational Brillouin zone\nwith grids of unprecedented size, which enables us to investigate the\nconvergence of the zero-point renormalization to the thermal and optical band\ngaps of diamond.\n", "  We construct static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in scalar\nextended ghost-free massive gravity and show the existence of hairy black holes\nin this class of extension. While the existence seems to be a generic feature,\nwe focus on the simplest models of this extension and find that asymptotically\nflat hairy black holes can exist without fine-tuning the theory parameters,\nunlike the bi-gravity extension, where asymptotical flatness requires\nfine-tuning in the parameter space. Like the bi-gravity extension, we are\nunable to obtain asymptotically dS regular black holes in the simplest models\nconsidered, but it is possible to obtain asymptotically AdS black holes.\n", "  We present experimental data and theoretical interpretation of NMR spectra of\nremotely magnetized samples, detected in an unshielded environment by means of\na differential atomic magnetometer. The measurements are performed in an\nultra-low-field at an intermediate regime, where the J-coupling and the Zeeman\nenergies have comparable values and produce rather complex line sets, which are\nsatisfactorily interpreted.\n", "  Hawking's proposal that the Universe has no temporal boundary and hence no\nbeginning depends on the notion of imaginary time and is usually referred to as\nthe \"no-boundary proposal.\" This paper discusses a simple alternative approach\nby means of the five-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model.\n", "  The adiabatic self-consistent collective coordinate (ASCC) method is a\npractical method for the description of large-amplitude collective motion in\natomic nuclei with superfluidity and an advanced version of the adiabatic\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. We investigate the gauge\nsymmetry in the ASCC method on the basis of the theory of constrained systems.\nThe gauge symmetry in the ASCC method is originated from the constraint on the\nparticle number in the collective Hamiltonian, and it is partially broken by\nthe adiabatic expansion. The validity of the adiabatic expansion under the\ngeneral gauge transformation is also discussed.\n", "  We study the nature of entanglement in presence of Deutschian closed timelike\ncurves (D-CTCs) and we observe that qubits traveling along a D-CTC allow\nunambiguous discrimination of Bell states with Local Operations and Classical\nCommunications (LOCC), that is otherwise known to be impossible. A consequence\nof this leads us to discover that localized D-CTCs can create entanglement,\nusing just local operations and classical communication. This contradicts the\nfundamental definition of entanglement.\n", "  Dispersion lies at the heart of real-time signal processing systems across\nthe entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio to optics. However, the\nperformance and applicability of such systems have been severely plagued by\ndistortions due to the frequency dependent nature of the amplitude response of\nthe dispersive media used for processing. This frequency dependence is a\nfundamental consequence of the causality constraint, incarnated by\nKramers-Kronig relations or, equivalently, by the Bode relations. In order to\nresolve this issue, we introduce here the concept of a \\emph{perfect dispersive\nmedium}, which is a loss-gain medium characterized by a perfectly flat\nmagnitude response along with an arbitrary phase response. This unprecedented\nproperty results from equalized electric and magnetic dipole dispersion\nresponses, whence the amplitude and phase of the transmission functions of the\nisolated loss and gain contributions become the inverse and remain the same,\nrespectively, under reversal of the sign of the imaginary part of the equalized\nmagneto-dielectric polarizability. Such a perfect dispersive medium may be\nrealized in the form of a metamaterial, and the paper demonstrates a\ncorresponding stacked loss-gain metasurface structure for illustration. From a\npractical standpoint, perfect dispersive media represent a paradigm shift that\nmay propel real-time signal processing technology to a new dimension, with a\nmyriad of novel ultrafast communication, sensing, imaging and instrumentation\napplications.\n", "  We discuss a possibility that the domain wall problem in the next-to-minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model is alleviated without introducing a small\nexplicit $Z_3$ breaking term by analyzing the evolution of the singlet scalar\nfield within an inflationary paradigm. The singlet scalar field which explains\nthe $\\mu$-term tracks a time-varying minimum of the effective potential after\ninflation and slowly rolls down to its global minimum if there exist\nsufficiently large negative Hubble-induced corrections on the effective\npotential for the singlet field, which arise through supergravity. As a\nconsequence, the whole Universe is confined within a single domain during and\nafter inflation, which prevents the formation of domain walls. This will\nfurther constrain the history of the early Universe along with the\nHiggs-singlet coupling.\n", "  We carry out a systematic qualitative analysis of the two quadratic schemes\nof generalized oscillators recently proposed by C. Quesne\n[J.Math.Phys.\\textbf{56},012903 (2015)]. By performing a local analysis of the\ngoverning potentials we demonstrate that while the first potential admits a\npair of equilibrium points one of which is typically a center for both signs of\nthe coupling strength $\\lambda$, the other points to a centre for $\\lambda < 0$\nbut a saddle $\\lambda > 0$. On the other hand, the second potential reveals\nonly a center for both the signs of $\\lambda$ from a linear stability analysis.\nWe carry out our study by extending Quesne's scheme to include the effects of a\nlinear dissipative term. An important outcome is that we run into a remarkable\ntransition to chaos in the presence of a periodic force term $f\\cos \\omega t$.\n", "  By means of the method of moving Frenet-Serret frame the set of equations of\nmotion is derived for spinning particle in an arbitrary external field, which\nis determined by potential depending from both position and the state of\nmovement, as well as by two pseudo-vectors one of which is easily associated\nwith external magnetic field, and another still remains undetermined. The\nequations give a possibility to describe the motion of both massive and\nmassless particles with spin. All solutions of the equations of motion in the\nabsence of external fields were found, and besides, we give more precise\ndefinition of a free object. It turns out that the massive particles always\npossess a longitudinal polarization. There are possible transversal motions of\nthe following types: 1) oscillatory motion with proper frequency, 2) circular\nmotion, and 3) complicated motion along rosette trajectories round the center\nof inertia with the velocity, varying in finite limits. Free massless particles\ncan either fluctuate or move along complicated paths around fixed centers of\nbalance, when the spin of the particles can have any direction.\n", "  The $\\beta\\gamma$ system on the cone of pure spinors is an integral part of\nthe string theory developed by N. Berkovits. This $\\beta\\gamma$ system offer a\nnumber of questions for pure mathematicians: what is a precise definition of\nthe space of states of the theory? Is there a mathematical explanations for\nvarious dualities (or pairings) predicted by physicists? Can a formula for\npartition function be written? To help me to answer these questions I use local\nalgebra in an essential way.\n", "  We investigate the phase space of topological black hole solutions of\n${\\mathfrak {su}}(N)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in anti-de Sitter space with a\npurely magnetic gauge potential. The gauge field is described by $N-1$ magnetic\ngauge field functions $\\omega_{j}$, $j=1,\\ldots , N-1$. For ${\\mathfrak\n{su}}(2)$ gauge group, the function $\\omega_{1}$ has no zeros. This is no\nlonger the case when we consider a larger gauge group. The phase space of\ntopological black holes is considerably simpler than for the corresponding\nspherically symmetric black holes, but for $N>2$ and a flat event horizon,\nthere exist solutions where at least one of the $\\omega_{j}$ functions has one\nor more zeros. For most of the solutions, all the $\\omega_{j}$ functions have\nno zeros, and at least some of these are linearly stable.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and electrical transport properties of\ngate-tunable superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), made of\nsemiconducting PbS nanowire contacted with PbIn superconducting electrodes.\nApplied with a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the nano-hybrid\nSQUID, periodic oscillations of the critical current due to the flux\nquantization in SQUID are observed up to T = 4.0 K. Nonsinusoidal current-phase\nrelationship is obtained as a function of temperature and gate voltage, which\nis consistent with a short and diffusive junction model.\n", "  The main aspects of a gauge-invariant approach to the description of quark\ndynamics in the nonperturbative regime of QCD are first reviewed. In\nparticular, the role of the parallel transport operation in constructing\ngauge-invariant Green's functions is presented, and the relevance of Wilson\nloops for the representation of the interaction is emphasized. Recent\ndevelopments, based on the use of polygonal lines for the parallel transport\noperation, are then presented. An integro-differential equation is obtained for\nthe quark Green's function defined with a phase factor along a single, straight\nline segment. It is solved exactly and analytically in the case of\ntwo-dimensional QCD in the large $N_c$ limit. The solution displays the\ndynamical mass generation phenomenon for quarks, with an infinite number of\nbranch-cut singularities that are stronger than simple poles.\n", "  Light fields get large scale fluctuations during inflation. If some of them\nare electrically charged, then large scale fluctuations of the electric charge\nwill be generated. As a consequence, any finite portion of the Universe,\nincluding our observable one, will carry a net electric charge. This fact does\nnot require any form of breaking of the gauge symmetry at any time. We discuss\nunder which conditions such a charge is maintained until the end of inflation,\nand we estimate its expected magnitude both in the case of charged fermions and\nof charged scalars. While one charged fermion species yields a charge density\nthat is several orders of magnitude below the observational constraints,\nextremely light charged scalars can exceed those constraints.\n", "  We study the Hall and Nernst effects across the antiferromagnetic transition\nthat reconstructs the quasi-2D Fermi surface of the metallic local moment\nantiferromagnet PdCrO$_2$. We show that non- monotonic temperature dependence\nin the Hall effect and a sign change in the Nernst effect above the ordering\ntemperature cannot be understood within a simple single-band transport model.\nThe inclusion of coherent scattering by critical antiferromagnetic fluctuations\ncan qualitatively account for these features in the transport coefficients. We\ndiscuss the implications of this for the pseudogap phase of the cuprate\nsuperconductors, which have a similar Fermi surface and where the same\ntransport signatures are observed.\n", "  A mathematical framework for relativistic quantum field theory is constructed\nwith natural symmetry $\\mathsf{so}(2,3)= \\mathsf{sp}(2,\\mathbb{ R})$. In this\nframework gravity and electromagnetism unify as aspects of the geometry. The\nsource equation for gravity differs from Einstein's equation and permits\nbehaviour that could explain dark matter.\n", "  The local induction equation, or the binormal flow on space curves is a\nwell-known model of deformation of space curves as it describes the dynamics of\nvortex filaments, and the complex curvature is governed by the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLS). In this paper, we present its discrete analogue,\nnamely, a model of deformation of discrete space curves by the discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (dNLS). We also present explicit formulas for\nboth NLS and dNLS flows in terms of the $\\tau$ function of the 2-component KP\nhierarchy.\n", "  The recent observation of an energy structure in the reactor antineutrino\nspectrum is reviewed. The reactor experiments Daya Bay, Double Chooz and RENO\nhave reported a consistent excess of antineutrinos deviating from the flux\npredictions, with a local significance of about 4$\\sigma$ between 4 and 6 MeV\nof the positron energy spectrum. The possible causes of the structure are\nanalyzed in this work, along with the different experimental approaches\ndeveloped to identify its origin. Considering the available data and results\nfrom the three experiments, the most likely explanation concerns the reactor\nflux predictions and the associated uncertainties. Therefore, the different\ncurrent models are described and compared. The possible sources of\nincompleteness or inaccuracy of such models are discussed, as well as the\nexperimental data required to improve their precision.\n", "  So-called \"Buchert averaging\" is actually a coarse-graining procedure, where\nfine detail is \"smeared out\" due to limited spatio-temporal resolution. For\ntechnical reasons, (to be explained herein), \"averaging\" is not really an\nappropriate term, and I shall consistently describe the process as a\n\"coarse-graining\". Because Einstein gravity is nonlinear the coarse-grained\nEinstein tensor is typically not equal to the Einstein tensor of the\ncoarse-grained spacetime geometry. The discrepancy can be viewed as an\n\"effective\" stress-energy. To keep otherwise messy technical issues firmly\nunder control, I shall work with conformal-FLRW (CFLRW) cosmologies. These\nCFLRW-based models are particularly tractable, and are also particularly\nattractive observationally: the CMB is not distorted. In this CFLRW context one\ncan prove some rigorous theorems regarding the interplay between Buchert\ncoarse-graining, tracelessness of the effective stress-energy, and the\nclassical energy conditions.\n", "  A resonance near 750 GeV has been observed at both the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments in its diphoton decay channel. We propose a possible interpretation\nbased on a simplified model: a 750 GeV singlet scalar resonance, and a minimal\nstealth vector quark are introduced. At the LHC, the scalar is produced through\ngluon fusion, and subsequently decays to diphoton final state. The light\nstealth quarks could enhance the diphoton rate significantly, while still\nkeeping other channels below the current LHC search limits. We find that the\nstealth quarks around 400 ~ 500 GeV with its coupling to scalar around 0.5 ~\n1.5 could explain the diphoton excess, and avoid current di-jet constraints. We\nalso comment on other potential signatures of this stealth model.\n", "  It is generally considered that an atomic nucleus is always compact. Based on\nthe isospin-dependent Boltzmann nuclear transport model, here I show that large\nblock nuclear matter or excited nuclear matter may both be hollow. And the size\nof inner bubble in these matter is affected by the charge number of nuclear\nmatter. Existence of hollow nuclear matter may have many implications in\nnuclear or atomic physics or astrophysics as well as some practical\napplications.\n", "  EVH black holes are Extremal black holes with Vanishing Horizon area, where\nvanishing of horizon area is a result of having a vanishing one-cycle on the\nhorizon. We prove three theorems regarding near horizon geometry of EVH black\nhole solutions to generic Einstein gravity theories in diverse dimensions.\nThese generic gravity theories are Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-Lambda theories,\nand gauged or ungauged supergravity theories with U(1) Maxwell fields. Our\nthree theorems are: (1) The near horizon geometry of any EVH black hole has a\nthree dimensional maximally symmetric subspace. (2) If the energy momentum\ntensor of the theory satisfies strong energy condition either this 3d part is\nan AdS3, or the solution is a direct product of a locally 3d flat space and a\nd-3 dimensional part. (3) These results extend to the near horizon geometry of\nnear-EVH black holes, for which the AdS3 part is replaced with BTZ geometry.\n", "  A method is proposed for the calculation of vibrational quantum and thermal\nexpectation values of physical properties from first principles. Thermal lines\nare introduced: these are lines in configuration space parametrized by\ntemperature, such that the value of any physical property along them is\napproximately equal to the vibrational average of that property. The number of\nsampling points needed to explore the vibrational phase space is reduced by up\nto an order of magnitude when the full vibrational density is replaced by\nthermal lines. Calculations of the vibrational averages of several properties\nand systems are reported, namely the internal energy and the electronic band\ngap of diamond and silicon, and the chemical shielding tensor of L-alanine.\nThermal lines pave the way for complex calculations of vibrational averages,\nincluding large systems and methods beyond semi-local density functional\ntheory.\n", "  Water Cherenkov and scintillator detectors are a critical tool for neutrino\nphysics.Their large size, low threshold, and low operational cost make them\nexcellent detectors for long baseline neutrino oscillations, proton decay,\nsupernova and solar neutrinos, double beta decay, and ultra-high energy\nastrophysical neutrinos. Proposals for a new generation of large detectors rely\non the availability of large format, fast, cost-effective photomultiplier\ntubes. The Electron Tubes Enterprises, Ltd (ETEL) D784KFLB 11 inch\nPhotomultiplier Tube has been developed for large neutrino detectors. We have\nmeasured the timing characteristics, relative efficiency, and magnetic field\nsensitivity of the first fifteen prototypes.\n", "  We discuss an extended scalar model which explains the recent results of\ndiphoton excess at 750 GeV at LHC Run II experiments. An additional singlet\nscalar boson with the mass of 750 GeV, which couples to top quarks via a\ndimension five operator, is produced via gluon fusion and decays into two\nphotons via loop contributions of a number of (multiply) charged scalar bosons.\nOrigin of such a dimension five operator would be, for example, in the context\nof composite Higgs models. The excess can be explained without contradicting\nthe data from LHC Run I and also theoretical consistencies such as perturbative\nunitarity and charge non-breaking.\n", "  We focus on the primary composition of cosmic rays with the highest energies\nthat cause extensive air showers in the Earth's atmosphere. A way of examining\nthe two lowest order moments of the sample distribution of the depth of shower\nmaximum is presented. The aim is to show that useful information about the\ncomposition of the primary beam can be inferred with limited knowledge we have\nabout processes underlying these observations. In order to describe how the\nmoments of the depth of shower maximum depend on the type of primary particles\nand their energies, we utilize a superposition model. Using the principle of\nmaximum entropy, we are able to determine what trends in the primary\ncomposition are consistent with the input data, while relying on a limited\namount of information from shower physics. Some capabilities and limitations of\nthe proposed method are discussed. In order to achieve a realistic description\nof the primary mass composition, we pay special attention to the choice of the\nparameters of the superposition model. We present two examples that demonstrate\nwhat consequences can be drawn for energy dependent changes in the primary\ncomposition.\n", "  In papers published in the 25 years following his famous 1964 proof John Bell\nrefined and reformulated his views on locality and causality. Although his\nformulations of local causality were in terms of probability, he had little to\nsay about that notion. But assumptions about probability are implicit in his\narguments and conclusions. Probability does not conform to these assumptions\nwhen quantum mechanics is applied to account for the particular correlations\nBell argues are locally inexplicable. This account involves no superluminal\naction and there is even a sense in which it is local, but it is in tension\nwith the requirement that the direct causes and effects of events are nearby.\n", "  An extension of the Standard Model with a hidden sector which consists of\ngauge singlets (a Dirac fermion $\\chi$ and a scalar $S$) plus a vector boson\n$V_\\mu$ (dark massive photon) is studied.

The scalar field generates the vector boson's\nmass. Perspectives for future $e^{-}e^{+}$ colliders is considered.\n", "  We study an effective field theory describing CP-violation in a scalar meson\nsector.

The theory describes CP-violation only when it\ncontains scalar fields representing mesons such as the $K^*_0$, sigma, $f_0$ or\n$a_0$. If the fields represent pseudo-scalar mesons, such as B, K and $\\pi$\nmesons then the Lagrangian describes anomalous processes such as $KK\\to\n\\pi\\pi\\pi$. We speculate that the field theory contains long lived excitations\ncorresponding to $Q$-ball type domain walls expanding through space-time. In an\n1+1 dimensional, analogous, field theory we find an exact, analytic solution\ncorresponding to such solitons. The solitons have a U(1) charge $Q$, which can\nbe arbitrarily high, but oddly, the energy behaves as $Q^{2/3}$ for large\ncharge, thus the configurations are stable under disintegration into elementary\ncharged particles of mass $m$ with $Q=1$. We also find analytic complex\ninstanton solutions which have finite, positive Euclidean action.\n", "  The interaction of graphene with metallic substrates reveals phenomena and\nproperties of great relevance for applications in nanotechnology. In this\nreview, the vibrational characterization by means of various inelastic\nscattering spectroscopies are surveyed for graphene epitaxially grown on metals\nand transition carbides. In particular, the manifestations of electron-phonon\ninteraction, such as Kohn anomalies, the evaluation of elastic properties and\nthe nanoscale control of phonon modes are presented and discussed.\n", "  A lock-in amplifier is a versatile instrument frequently used in physics\nresearch. However, many students struggle with the basic operating principles\nof a lock-in amplifier which can lead to a variety of difficulties. To improve\nstudents' understanding, we have been developing and evaluating a\nresearch-based tutorial which makes use of a computer simulation of a lock-in\namplifier. The tutorial is based on a field-tested approach in which students\nrealize their difficulties after predicting the outcome of simulated\nexperiments involving a lock-in amplifier and check their predictions using the\nsimulated lock-in amplifier. Then, the tutorial guides and helps students\ndevelop a coherent understanding of the basics of a lock-in amplifier. The\ntutorial development involved interviews with physics faculty members and\ngraduate students and iteration of many versions of the tutorial with\nprofessors and graduate students. The student difficulties and the development\nand assessment of the research-based tutorial are discussed.\n", "  We report the synthesis of n-type SnSe$_{1-x}$ using a self-sacrificial,\nfacile, solvo-thermal synthesis route. Electrical and thermal transport\nmeasurements suggest a low thermal conductivity and a significant thermopower\nin the temperature range 100 - 400\\,K. We also propose the possibility of\ndeveloping an all SnSe thermoelectric module.\n", "  A simple ansatz is proposed for two-color R-matrix satisfying the tetrahedron\nequation. It generalizes, on one hand, a particular case of the eight-vertex\nmodel to three dimensions, and on another hand - Hietarinta's permutation-type\noperators to their linear combinations. Each separate R-matrix depends on one\nparameter, and the tetrahedron equation holds provided the quadruple of\nparameters belongs to an algebraic set containing five irreducible\ntwo-dimensional components.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment that reported the synthesis of a new 2D\nmaterial nitrogenated holey graphene (C$_2$N) [Mahmood \\textit{et al., Nat.\nComm.}, 2015, \\textbf{6}, 6486], electronic, magnetic, and mechanical\nproperties of nitrogenated (C$_2$N), phosphorated (C$_2$P) and arsenicated\n(C$_2$As) monolayer holey graphene structures are investigated using\nfirst-principles calculations. Our total energy calculations indicate that,\nsimilar to the C$_2$N monolayer, the formation of the other two holey\nstructures are also energetically feasible. Calculated cohesive energies for\neach monolayer show a decreasing trend going from C$_2$N to C$_2$As structure.\nRemarkably, all the holey monolayers are direct band gap semiconductors.\nRegarding the mechanical properties (in-plane stiffness and Poisson ratio), we\nfind that C$_2$N has the highest in-plane stiffness and the largest Poisson\nratio among the three monolayers. In addition, our calculations reveal that for\nthe C$_2$N, C$_2$P and C$_2$As monolayers, creation of N and P defects changes\nthe semiconducting behavior to a metallic ground state while the inclusion of\ndouble H impurities in all holey structures results in magnetic ground states.\nAs an alternative to the experimentally synthesized C$_2$N, C$_2$P and C$_2$As\nare mechanically stable and flexible semiconductors which are important for\npotential applications in optoelectronics.\n", "  We trace the development of elliptic anisotropy (v2) via parton-parton\ncollision history in two transport models. The parton v2 is studied as a\nfunction of the number of collisions of each parton in Au+Au and d+Au\ncollisions at sNN =200 GeV. It is found that the majority of v2 comes from the\nanisotropic escape probability of partons, with no fundamental difference at\nlow and high transverse momenta. The contribution to v2 from hydrodynamic-type\ncollective flow is found to be small. Only when the parton-parton cross-section\nis set unrealistically large does this contribution start to take over. Our\nfindings challenge the current paradigm emerged from hydrodynamic comparisons\nto anisotropy data.\n", "  Rogue waves (RWs) are unexpectedly strong excitations emerging from an\notherwise tranquil background. The nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE), a\nubiquitous model with wide applications to fluid mechanics, optics and plasmas,\nexhibits RWs only in the regime of modulation instability (MI) of the\nbackground. For system of multiple waveguides, the governing coupled NLSEs can\nproduce regimes of MI and RWs, even if each component has dispersion and cubic\nnonlinearity of opposite signs. A similar effect will be demonstrated for a\nsystem of coupled derivative NLSEs (DNLSEs), where the special feature is the\nnonlinear self-steepening of narrow pulses. More precisely, these additional\nregimes of MI and RWs for coupled DNLSEs will depend on the mismatch in group\nvelocities between the components, as well as the parameters for cubic\nnonlinearity and self-steepening. RWs considered in this work differ from those\nof the NLSEs in terms of the amplification ratio and criteria of existence.\nApplications to optics and plasma physics are discussed.\n", "  We have selected a sample of extremely isolated galaxies (EIGs) from the\nlocal Universe ($\\mbox{z} < 0.024$), using a simple isolation criterion: having\nno known neighbours closer than $300\\,{\\rm km\\,s}^{-1}$\n($3\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mbox{Mpc}$) in the three-dimensional redshift space\n$(\\alpha,\\delta,\\mbox{z})$. The sample is unique both in its level of isolation\nand in the fact that it utilizes HI redshifts from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA\nsurvey (ALFALFA).\n  We analysed the EIG sample using cosmological simulations and found that it\ncontains extremely isolated galaxies with normal mass haloes which have evolved\ngradually with little or no \"major events\" (major mergers, or major mass-loss\nevents) in the last $3\\,\\mbox{Gyr}$. The fraction of EIGs which deviate from\nthis definition (false positives) is 5%-10%.\n  For the general population of dark matter haloes it was further found that\nthe mass accretion (relative to the current halo mass) is affected by the halo\nenvironment mainly through strong interactions with its neighbours. As long as\na halo does not experience major events, its Mass Accretion History (MAH) does\nnot depend significantly on its environment. \"Major events\" seem to be the main\nmechanism that creates low-mass subhaloes ($M_{halo} <\n10^{10}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$) that host galaxies (with $\\mbox{M}_{g} \\lesssim\n-14$).\n", "  One might ask why is it important to know the mechanism of fracture in leaves\nwhen Mother Nature is doing her job perfectly. I could list the following\nreasons to address that question: (a) Leaves are natural composite structures,\nduring millions of years of evolution, they have adapted themselves to their\nsurrounding environment and their design is optimized, one can apply the\nknowledge gained from studying the fracture mechanism of leaves to the\ndevelopment of new composite materials; (b) Other soft tissues like skin and\nblood vessel have similar structure at some scales and may possess the same\nfracture mechanism. The gained knowledge can also be applied to these\nmaterials; (c) Global need for food is skyrocketing. There are few countries,\nincluding the United States, that have all the potentials (i.e. water, soil,\nsunlight, and manpower) to play a major role in the future world food supplying\nmarket. If we can increase the output of our farms and forests, by means of\nprotecting them against herbivores [Beck 1965], pathogens [Campbell et al.\n1980], and other physical damages, our share of the future market will be\nhigher. It will also enforce our national food security because we will not be\ndependent on food import. We do not yet know how much of our farms and forests\noutput can be saved if we can genetically design tougher materials, but the\nwhole idea does worth to be studied.\n", "  We study Riesz means of eigenvalues of the Heisenberg Laplacian with\nDirichlet boundary conditions on a cylinder in dimension three. We obtain an\ninequality with a sharp leading term and an additional lower order term.\n", "  Using in-resonator photoconductive heaters to both sense and control the\nintra-cavity light intensity of microring resonators, automatic tuning of a\nsilicon-on-insulator two-ring Vernier filter is demonstrated across the entire\nC-band.\n", "  The recent report on laser cooling of liquid may contradict the law of energy\nconservation.\n", "  Colloidal inclusions in lab-on-a-chip devices can be used to perform analytic\noperations in a non-invasive fashion. We demonstrate here a novel approach to\nrealize fast and reversible micro-sieving operations by manipulating and\ntransporting colloidal chains via mobile domain walls in a magnetic structured\nsubstrate. We show that this technique allows to precisely move and sieve\nnon-magnetic particles, to tweeze microscopic cargos or to mechanically\ncompress highly dense colloidal monolayers.\n", "  We report a quantum study of the carrier scattering induced by graphene\nripples. Crucial differences between the scattering induced by the ripple and\nordinary scattering were found. In contrast to the latter, in which the Born\napproximation is valid for high-energy process, the former is valid for the\nlow-energy process with a quite broad energy range. Furthermore, in polar\nsymmetry ripples, the scattering amplitude exhibits a pseudo-spin structure, an\nadditional factor $\\cos\\theta/2$, which leads to an absence of backward\nscattering. We also elucidate that the scattering cross sections are\nproportional to the energy cubed of the incident carrier.\n", "  The Dirac bands and flat bands are difficult to coexist because they\nrepresent two extreme ends of electronic properties. However, in this paper, we\npropose a carbon-Kagome-lattice (CKL) family based on first-principles\ncalculations, and the coexistence of Dirac and flat bands are observed in this\nseries of three-dimensional carbon structures. The flat bands are originated\nfrom the orbital interactions of the Kagome lattices, while the Dirac bands are\nrelated to the carbon zigzag chains. A tight-binding model is used to explain\nthe various band structures in different CKLs. The coexistence of flat and\nDirac bands around the Fermi level implies that CKL structures maybe can serve\nas superconductors. In addition, electronic properties of the thinnest CKL\nslabs, only consisting of benzene rings, are studied. Flat bands are found in\nthe band spectra of the two-dimensional structures, and split into spin-up and\nspin-down bands because of strong correlated effect in the case of hole doping.\n", "  The JSNS2 (J-PARC E56) experiment aims to search for sterile neutrinos at the\nJ-PARC Materials and Life Sciences Experimental Facility (MLF).After the\nsubmission of a proposal to the J-PARC PAC, stage-1 approval was granted to the\nJSNS2 experiment. The approval followed a series of background measurements\nwhich were performed in 2014. Subsequent for stage-1 approval, the JSNS2\ncollaboration has made continuous efforts to write a Technical Design Report\n(TDR).This TDR will include two major items as discussed in the previous status\nreport for the 20th J-PARC PAC: (1) A realistic detector location (2) Well\nunderstood and realistic detector performance using simulation studies,\nprimarily in consideration of fast neutron rejection. Since August we have been\nin discussions with MLF staff regarding an appropriate detector location. We\nare also in the process of setting up a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation framework\nin order to study detector's performance in realistic conditions. In addition,\nwe have pursued hardware R&D work for the liquid scintillator (LS) and to\nimprove the dynamic range of the 10\" photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The LS R&D\nworks includes Cherenkov studies inside the LS, and a Pulse Shape\nDiscrimination (PSD) study with a test-beam, performed at Tohoku University. We\nalso estimate the PSD performance of a full-sized detector using a detailed MC\nsimulation. In this status report, we describe progress on this work.\n", "  To understand how certain dynamical behaviors can or cannot persist as the\nunderlying network grows is a problem of increasing importance in complex\ndynamical systems as well as sustainability science and engineering. We address\nthe question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain\nits synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real\nworld can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external\ndisturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient\nsynchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a\nlocal perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the\nvicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large\nscale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the\nindividual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading\nmanner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the\nnetworked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the\nsynchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to\nidentify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of\nlinear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the\naddition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose\nsynchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A\nstatistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the\ncollapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations\nin the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized\ncriticality. We demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon of synchronization\ncollapse using a variety of complex network models, and uncover the underlying\ndynamical mechanism through an eigenvector analysis.\n", "  Using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Greens function\ntechnique, we performed theoretical investigations on the structural and\ntransport properties of zigzag silicene nanoribbons with Stone-Wales defect.\nThe calculated formation energy is significantly lower than that of graphene\nand silicene, which implies the high stability of such defect in SiNRs.\nNegative differential resistance can be observed within certain bias voltage\nrange in both perfect and SW defected SiNRs. In order to elucidate the\nmechanism the NDR behavior,the transmission spectra and molecular projected\nself-consistent Hamiltonian states are discussed in details.\n", "  Cosmic strings are a type of cosmic defect formed by a symmetry-breaking\nphase transition in the early universe. Individual strings would have gathered\nto build a network, and their dynamical motion would induce scalar--, vector--\nand tensor--type perturbations. In this paper, we focus on the vector mode\nperturbations arising from the string network based on the one scale model and\ncalculate the time evolution and the power spectrum of the associated magnetic\nfields. We show that the relative velocity between photon and baryon fluids\ninduced by the string network can generate magnetic fields over a wide range of\nscales based on standard cosmology. We obtain the magnetic field spectrum\nbefore recombination as\n$a^2B(k,z)\\sim4\\times10^{-16}G\\mu/((1+z)/1000)^{4.25}(k/{\\rm Mpc}^{-1})^{3.5}$\nGauss on super-horizon scales, and\n$a^2B(k,z)\\sim2.4\\times10^{-17}G\\mu/((1+z)/1000)^{3.5}(k/{\\rm Mpc}^{-1})^{2.5}$\nGauss on sub-horizon scales in co-moving coordinates. This magnetic field grows\nup to the end of recombination, and has a final amplitude of approximately\n$B\\sim10^{-17\\sim -18} G\\mu$ Gauss at the $k\\sim1\\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ scale today.\nThis field might serve as a seed for cosmological magnetic fields.\n", "  I report on the early history of Belle, which was almost entirely focused on\ntesting the Kobayashi Maskawa mechanism for $CP$ violation that predicted large\nmatter-antimatter asymmetries in certain $B$ meson decay modes. Results\nreported by both BaBar and Belle in the summer of 2001 verified the Kobayashi\nMaskawa idea and led to their Nobel prizes in 2008. In addition to studies of\nCP violation, Belle (and BaBar) reported a large number of important results on\na wide variety of other subjects, many of which that had nothing to do with B\nmesons. In this talk I cover three (of many) subjects where Belle measurements\nhave had a significant impact on specific sub-fields of hadron physics but are\nnot generally well know. These include: the discovery of an anomalously large\ncross sections for double charmonium production in continuum e+e- annihilation;\nsensitive probes of the structure of the low-mass scalar mesons; and first\nmeasurements of the Collins spin fragmentation function.\n", "  Australian Indigenous astronomical traditions hint at a relationship between\nanimals in the skyworld and the behaviour patterns of their terrestrial\ncounterparts. In our continued study of Aboriginal astronomical traditions from\nthe Great Victoria Desert, South Australia, we investigate the relationship\nbetween animal behaviour and stellar positions. We develop a methodology to\ntest the hypothesis that the behaviour of these animals is predicted by the\npositions of their celestial counterparts at particular times of the day. Of\nthe twelve animals identified in the Ooldean sky, the nine stellar (i.e.\nnon-planet or non-galactic) associations were analysed and each demonstrated a\nclose connection between animal behaviour and stellar positions. We suggest\nthat this may be a recurring theme in Aboriginal astronomical traditions,\nrequiring further development of the methodology.\n", "  Using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Greens function\ntechnique, we performed theoretical investigations on the transport properties\nof several ZAZ SiNRs junctions,a similar kind of silicene molecules junction\ncombined by zigzag and armchair silicene nanoribbons. It is found that the\ndifferential conductances of the three systems decrease with an order of\n5-ZAZ>4-ZAZ>3-ZAZ.Particularly,the Negative differential resistance can be\nobserved within certain bias voltage range only in 3-ZAZ SiNRs. In order to\nelucidate the mechanism the NDR behavior, the transmission spectra and\nmolecular projected selfconsistent Hamiltonian states are discussed in details.\n", "  We report an experimental study of the motion of magnetized beads driven by a\ntravelling wave magnetic field. For sufficiently large wave speed, we report\nthe existence of a backward motion, in which the sphere can move in the\ndirection opposite to the driving wave. We show that the transition to this new\nstate is strongly subcritical and can lead to chaotic motion of the bead. For\nsome parameters, this counter-propagation of the sphere can be one order of\nmagnitude faster than the driving wave speed. These results are understood in\nthe framework of a model based on the interplay among solid friction, air\nresistance and magnetic torque.\n", "  Most natural and engineered processes, such as biomolecular reactions,\nprotein folding, and population dynamics, occur far from equilibrium and,\ntherefore, cannot be treated within the framework of classical equilibrium\nthermodynamics. The Jarzynski equality holds the promise to calculate the\nfree-energy difference between two states from the Boltzmann-weighted\nstatistics of the irreversible work done along trajectories arbitrarily out of\nequilibrium. This equality is the subject of intense activity. However, the\napplicability of the Jarzynski equality to systems far from equilibrium such as\nliving matter has not been investigated yet. We present an experimental test of\nthe Jarzynski equality predictions on a paradigmatic physical model, i.e. a\nBrownian particle held in an optical potential, coupled either to a thermal\nbath or to an active bath. While in the thermal bath we find that the Jarzynski\nequality correctly retrieves the free-energy difference from nonequilibrium\nmeasurements, in the active bath the Jarzynski equality fails because of the\npresence of non-Boltzmann statistics. We corroborate our experimental findings\nwith theoretical arguments and numerical simulations.\n", "  Using our mathematical framework developed in \\cite{cresson-pierret_scale}\ncalled \\emph{scale dynamics}, we propose in this paper a new way of\ninterpreting the problem of adding or modifying potentials in mechanics and\nspecifically in galactic dynamics. An application is done for the two-body\nproblem with a Keplerian potential showing that the velocity of the orbiting\nbody is constant. This would explain the observed phenomenon in the flat\nrotation curves of galaxies without adding \\emph{dark matter} or modifying\nNewton's law of dynamics.\n", "  A simple prototypical model of aromatic pi-pi stacking system -- benzene\nsandwich dimer is investigated by ab initio calculations based on second-order\nMoller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and Minnesota hybrid functional\nM06-2X.\n", "  Dedispersion, the removal of deleterious smearing of impulsive signals by the\ninterstellar matter, is one of the most intensive processing steps in any radio\nsurvey for pulsars and fast transients. We here present a study of the\nparallelization of this algorithm on many-core accelerators, including GPUs\nfrom AMD and NVIDIA, and the Intel Xeon Phi. We find that dedispersion is\ninherently memory-bound. Even in a perfect scenario, hardware limitations keep\nthe arithmetic intensity low, thus limiting performance. We next exploit\nauto-tuning to adapt dedispersion to different accelerators, observations, and\neven telescopes. We demonstrate that the optimal settings differ between\nobservational setups, and that auto-tuning significantly improves performance.\nThis impacts time-domain surveys from Apertif to SKA.\n", "  The ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI(Tl) Scintillators) experiment aims at\nthe confirmation of the DAMA/LIBRA positive annual modulation signal using the\nsame target and technique at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). A first\nstep, named ANAIS-25 (two 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) modules) taking data from December\n2012 to February 2015, provided interesting outcomes: very high light\ncollection efficiency, that could allow to lower the analysis energy threshold\ndown to the level of 1 keVee, and a good understanding of the different\nbackground components, in particular the cosmogenic activated isotopes in the\ncrystal bulk and other radioactive contaminations of the NaI crystal/powder.\nBut those prototypes clearly pointed to the need for improved crystal\nradiopurity, in particular for $^{210}$Pb contamination. Since then,\nimprovements in the purification and growing procedures in order to reduce\nbackground in the very low energy region have been implemented and a new 12.5\nkg module has been constructed and installed between the former two crystals,\nforming the ANAIS-37 setup. Very preliminary results of this setup evidence the\nimprovement on radiopurity of the new crystal and are presented here. In\naddition, background simulations and prospects for the full experiment are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We establish uniform convergence, with explicit rate, of the solution to the\nThomas--Fermi--von Weizs\\\"acker (TFW) Yukawa model to the solution of the TFW\nCoulomb model, for general condensed nuclear configurations. As a consequence,\nwe show the convergence of forces from the Yukawa to the Coulomb model. These\nresults rely on an extension of Nazar \\& Ortner (2015) to the Yukawa setting.\nAuxiliary results of independent interest shown also include new existence,\nuniqueness and stability results for the Yukawa ground state.\n", "  The review describes the development of ideas Gury Ivanovich Marchuk in the\nfield of variational data assimilation for ocean models applied in particular\nin coupled models for long-range weather forecasts. Particular attention is\npaid to the optimization of boundary conditions on rigid boundaries. As\nidealized and realistic model configurations are considered. It is shown that\nthe optimization allows us to determine the most sensitive model operators and\nbring the model solution closer to the assimilated data.\n", "  The information capacity of double-crossover (DX) tiles was successfully\nincreased beyond a binary representation to higher base representations. By\ncontrolling the length and the position of DNA hairpins on the DX tile, ternary\nand senary (base-3 and base-6) digit representations were realized and verified\nby atomic force microscopy (AFM). Also, normal mode analysis (NMA) was carried\nout to study the mechanical characteristics of each structure.\n", "  The AKARI Deep Field South (ADF-S) is a large extragalactic survey field that\nis covered by multiple instruments, from optical to far-IR and radio. I\nsummarise recent results in this and related fields prompted by the release of\nthe Herschel far-IR/submm images, including studies of cold dust in nearby\ngalaxies, the identification of strongly lensed distant galaxies, and the use\nof colour selection to find candidate very high redshift sources. I conclude\nthat the potential for significant new results from the ADF-S is very great.\nThe addition of new wavelength bands in the future, eg. from Euclid, SKA, ALMA\nand elsewhere, will boost the importance of this field still further.\n", "  We developed a new endogenous approach to reveal subcellular metabolic\ncontrast in fresh ex vivo tissues taking advantage of the time dependence of\nthe full field optical coherence tomography interferometric signals. This\nmethod reveals signals linked with local activity of the endogenous scattering\nelements which can reveal cells where other imaging techniques fail or need\nexogenous contrast agents. We benefit from the micrometric transverse\nresolution of full field OCT to image intracellular features. We used this time\ndependence to identify different dynamics at the millisecond scale on a wide\nrange of organs in normal or pathological conditions.\n", "  We present a measurement of the electron neutrino charged-current inclusive\ncross section per nucleon with a data sample corresponding to 2.6E20\nprotons-on-target collected by NOvA near detector at Fermilab.\n", "  We describe a simple and scalable method for the transfer of CVD graphene for\nthe fabrication of field effect transistors. This is a dry process that uses a\nmodified RCA cleaning step to improve the surface quality. In contrast to\nconventional fabrication routes where lithographic steps are performed after\nthe transfer, here graphene is transferred to a pre-patterned substrate. The\nresulting FET devices display nearly zero Dirac voltage, and the contact\nresistance between the graphene and metal contacts is on the order of 910 +-\n340 Ohm-micrometer. This approach enables formation of conducting graphene\nchannel lengths up to one millimeter. The resist-free transfer process provides\na clean graphene surface that is promising for use in high sensitivity graphene\nFET biosensors.\n", "  A highly sensitive optical capillary electrophoresis measurement method based\non a nanofluidic optical fiber platform is presented. By using scaling\narguments and considering realistic instrument limitations, I underline the\nfeasibility of measuring the electrophoretic mobility of a single\nfreely-diffusing nanoparticle or macromolecule in vitro, continuously and\nindefinitely, with microsecond time resolution. The high speed of this\ntechnique opens up new possibilities for studying reaction kinetics at the\nsingle molecule level.\n", "  We present recent developments in lattice Boltzmann modeling for\nmulti-component flows, implemented on the platform of a general purpose,\narbitrary geometry solver PowerFLOW. Presented benchmark cases demonstrate the\nmethod's accuracy and robustness necessary for handling real world engineering\napplications at practical resolution and computational cost. The key\nrequirements for such approach are that the relevant physical properties and\nflow characteristics do not strongly depend on numerics. In particular, the\nstrength of surface tension obtained using our new approach is independent of\nviscosity and resolution, while the spurious currents are significantly\nsuppressed. Using a much improved surface wetting model, undesirable numerical\nartifacts including thin film and artificial droplet movement on inclined wall\nare significantly reduced.\n", "  (doctoral thesis of Michal Bilek, finished on June 19, 2015)\n  MOND is an observational rule for predicting the acceleration of stars and\ngalaxies from the distribution of the visible matter. It possibly stems from a\nnew law of physics. I list the theoretical aspects of MOND, its achievements\nand problems. MOND has been tested mainly in disc galaxies so far. Its tests in\nelliptical galaxies are rare because the MOND effects are small for them in the\nparts observable by the conventional methods. In the thesis, I explain the\nmethods and ideas I developed for testing MOND in the ellipticals using stellar\nshells. Moreover, the shells enable us to test MOND for stars in radial orbits\nfor the first time. The shells are results of galactic interactions. I discuss\nthe shell formation mechanisms and summarize the findings from shell\nobservations and simulations.\n  The thesis contains as yet unpublished results mainly in: 1) the introduction\nof Sect. 3 (the expected differences in the shell morphology in the Newtonian\ndynamics with dark matter and in MOND), and 2) Sect. 2.4.1 (formulas for\nmodeling the evolution of shell radii).\n", "  One of the most important tasks in understanding the complex spatial\norganization of the genome consists in extracting information about this\nspatial organization, the function and structure of chromatin topological\ndomains from existing experimental data, in particular, from genome\ncolocalization (Hi-C) matrices. Here we present an algorithm allowing to reveal\nthe underlying hierarchical domain structure of a polymer conformation from\nanalyzing the modularity of colocalization matrices. We also test this\nalgorithm on several model polymer structures: equilibrium globules, random\nfractal globules and regular fractal (Peano) conformations. We define what we\ncall a spectrum of cluster borders, and show that these spectra behave\nstrikingly differently for equilibrium and fractal conformations, allowing us\nto suggest an additional criterion to identify fractal polymer conformations.\n", "  In this paper, we study a maximization and a minimization problem associated\nwith a Poisson boundary value problem. Optimal solutions in a set of\nrearrangements of a given function define stationary and stable flows of an\nideal fluid in two dimensions. The main contribution of this paper is to\ndetermine the optimal solutions. At first, we derive the solutions analytically\nwhen the problems are in low contrast regime. Moreover, it is established that\nthe solutions of both problems are unique. Secondly, for the high contrast\nregime, two optimization algorithms are developed. For the minimization\nproblem, we prove that our algorithm converges to the global minimizer\nregardless of the initializer. The maximization algorithm is capable of\nderiving all local maximizers including the global one. Numerical experiments\nleads us to a conjecture about the location of the maximizers in the set of\nrearrangements of a function.\n", "  Dynamics of charged matter in the oblique black hole magnetosphere is\ninvestigated. In particular, we adopt a model consisting of a rotating black\nhole embedded in the external large-scale magnetic field that is inclined\narbitrarily with respect to the rotation axis. Breaking the axial symmetry\nappears to have profound consequences regarding the dynamics of particles and\nit also poses some methodological difficulties. In this contribution we discuss\nthe applicability of the method of effective potential for the non-axisymmetric\nmodel and show that it may only be applied in the appropriate reference frame.\n", "  We study InAs nanowire resonators fabricated on sapphire substrate with a\nlocal gate configuration. The key advantage of using an insulating sapphire\nsubstrate is that it results in a reduced parasitic capacitance thus allowing\nboth wide bandwidth actuation and detection using a network analyzer as well as\nsignal detection at room temperature. Both in-plane and out-of-plane\nvibrational modes of the nanowire can be driven and the non-linear response of\nthe resonators studied. In addition this technique enables the study of\nvariation of thermal strains due to heating in nanostructures\n", "  Graphene pn junction is the brick to build up variety of graphene\nnano-structures. The analytical formula of the conductance of graphene gradual\npn junctions in the whole bipolar region has been absent up to now. In this\npaper, we analytically calculated that pn conductance with the spin-orbit\ncoupling and stagger potential taken into account. Our analytical expression\nindicates that the energy gap causes the conductance to drop a constant value\nwith respect to that without gap in a certain parameter region, and manifests\nthat the curve of the conductance versus the stagger potential consists of two\nGaussian peaks -- one valley contributes one peak. The latter feature allows\none to detect the valley polarization without using double-interface resonant\ndevices.\n", "  We investigated the electronic structure of a silicene-like lattice with a\nline defect under the consideration of spin-orbit coupling. In the bulk energy\ngap, there are defect related bands corresponding to spin helical states\nlocalized beside the defect line: spin-up electrons flow forward on one side\nnear to the line defect and move backward on the other side, and vice verse for\nspin-down electrons. When the system is subjected to random distribution of\nspin-flipping scatterers, electrons suffer much less spin-flipped scattering\nwhen they transport along the line defect than in the bulk. An electric gate\nabove the line defect can tune the spin-flipped transmission, which makes the\nline defect as a spin-controllable waveguide.\n", "  Throughout the last decade sensitive infrared observations obtained by the\nSpitzer Space Telescope significantly increased the known population of YSOs\nassociated with nearby molecular clouds. With such a census recent studies have\ncharacterized pre-main sequence stars (PMS) and determined parame- ters from\ndifferent wavelengths. Given the restricted Spitzer coverage of some of these\nclouds, relative to their extended regions, these YSO populations may represent\na limited view of star formation in these regions. We are taking advantage of\nmid-infrared observations from the NASA Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE), which provides an all sky view and therefore full coverage of the\nnearby clouds, to assess the degree to which their currently known YSO\npopulation may be representative of a more complete population. We extend the\nwell established classification method of the Spitzer Legacy teams to archived\nWISE observations. We have adopted 2MASS photometry as a standard catalogue for\ncomparisons. Besides the massive embedded cluster IC5146 we provide a multiband\nview of five new embedded clusters in its surroundings that we discovered with\nWISE. In short, the analysis in- volves the following for the presently studied\ncluster sample: (1) extraction of 2MASS/WISE/Spitzer photometry in a wide\ncircular region; (2) field-star decontamination to enhance the intrinsic\nColour-magnitude diagram (CMD) morphology (essential for a proper derivation of\nreddening, age, and distance from the Sun); and (3) construction of\nColour-magnitude filters, for more contrasted stellar radial density profiles\n(RDPs).\n", "  The lock-in amplifier is a versatile instrument frequently used in physics\nresearch. However, many students struggle with the basic operating principles\nof a lock-in amplifier which can lead to a variety of difficulties. To improve\nstudents' understanding, we have been developing and evaluating a\nresearch-based tutorial which makes use of a computer simulation of a lock-in\namplifier. The tutorial allows students to realize their conceptual\ndifficulties by comparing their predictions about how a lock-in amplifier will\nbehave with the outcome of simulated experiments. After being confronted with\ndiscrepancies between their predictions and the lock-in amplifier results, the\ntutorial targets the common difficulties that students have and leads them to\ndevelop a deeper understanding of the principles of lock-in amplification.\n", "  A graphene channel field-effect biosensor is demonstrated for detecting the\nbinding of double-stranded DNA and poly-l-lysine. Sensors consist of CVD\ngraphene transferred using a clean, etchant-free transfer method. The presence\nof DNA and poly-l-lysine are detected by the conductance change of the graphene\ntransistor. A readily measured shift in the Dirac Voltage (the voltage at which\nthe graphenes resistance peaks) is observed after the graphene channel is\nexposed to solutions containing DNA or poly-l-lysine. The Dirac voltage shift\nis attributed to the binding/unbinding of charged molecules on the graphene\nsurface. The polarity of the response changes to positive direction with\npoly-l-lysine and negative direction with DNA. This response results in\ndetection limits of 8 pM for 48.5 kbp DNA and 11 pM for poly-l-lysine. The\nbiosensors are easy to fabricate, reusable and are promising as sensors of a\nwide variety of charged biomolecules\n", "  We describe the development and evaluation of a Quantum Interactive Learning\nTutorial (QuILT) on quantum key distribution, a context which involves an\nexciting application of quantum mechanics. The protocol used in the QuILT\ndescribed here uses single photons with non-orthogonal polarization states to\ngenerate a random shared key over a public channel for encrypting and\ndecrypting information. The QuILT helps upper-level undergraduate students\nlearn quantum mechanics using a simple two state system. It actively engages\nstudents in the learning process and helps them build links between the\nformalism and the conceptual aspects of quantum physics without compromising\nthe technical content. The evaluations suggest that the QuILT is helpful in\nimproving students' understanding of relevant concepts.\n", "  A flipped classroom was introduced in pre-service education in order to\npromote MM and the quality of their use in the teaching and learning process in\nlaboratory. The course, Physics Lab Didactics, promoted active learning through\nthe direct experience of young teachers. The flipped classroom approach was\npresented and discussed with the aim of clarifying the teaching process and\nin-training teachers were invited to explore how to implement this methodology\nin a class after their experience. Different open source or free software were\nproposed (Audacity, Algodoo, GeoGebra and Tracker) with some examples of their\nuse in physics teaching. The discussion on their implementation as tools in\nphysics laboratory was postponed to the last lesson of the course. This pilot\nstudy shows a great potentiality of the flipped classroom in pre-service\neducation and it indicates that the use of MM in laboratory learning process\ncan be improved following this approach.\n", "  There is immense scientific interest in the properties of resonant thin films\nembroidered with periodic nanoscale features. This device class possesses\nconsiderable innovation potential. Accordingly, we report unpolarized broadband\nreflectors enabled by a serial arrangement of a pair of polarized subwavelength\ngratings. Optimized with numerical methods, our elemental gratings consist of a\npartially-etched crystalline-silicon film on a quartz substrate. The resulting\nreflectors exhibit extremely wide spectral reflection bands in one\npolarization. By arranging two such reflectors sequentially with orthogonal\nperiodicities, there results an unpolarized spectral band that exceeds those of\nthe individual polarized bands. In the experiments reported herein, we achieve\nzero-order reflectance exceeding 97% under unpolarized light incidence over a\n500-nm-wide wavelength band in the near-infrared domain. Moreover, the resonant\nunpolarized broadband accommodates an ultra-high-reflection band spanning ~85\nnm and exceeding 99.9% in efficiency. The elemental polarization-sensitive\nreflectors based on one-dimensional resonant gratings have simple design,\nrobust performance, and are straightforward to fabricate. Hence, this\ntechnology is a promising alternative to traditional multilayer thin-film\nreflectors especially at longer wavelengths of light where multilayer\ndeposition may be infeasible or impractical.\n", "  The curvature dependence of the physisorption properties of a water molecule\ninside and outside an armchair carbon nanotube (CNTs) is investigated by an\nincremental density-fitting local coupled cluster treatment with single and\ndouble excitations and perturbative triples (DF-LCCSD(T)) study. Our results\nshow that a water molecule outside and inside (n, n) CNTs (n=4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10)\nis stabilized by electron correlation. The adsorption energy of water inside\nCNTs decreases quickly with the decrease of curvature (increase of radius) and\nthe configuration with the oxygen pointing towards the CNT wall is the most\nstable one. However, when the water molecule is adsorbed outside the CNT, the\nadsorption energy varies only slightly with the curvature and the configuration\nwith hydrogens pointing towards the CNT wall is the most stable one. We also\nuse the DF-LCCSD(T) results to parametrize Lennard-Jones (LJ) force fields for\nthe interaction of water both with the inner and outer sides of CNTs and with\ngraphene representing the zero curvature limit. It is not possible to reproduce\nall DF-LCCSD(T) results for water inside and outside CNTs of different\ncurvature by a single set of LJ parameters, but two sets have to be used\ninstead. Each of the two resulting sets can reproduce three out of four minima\nof the effective potential curves reasonably well. These LJ models are then\nused to calculate the water adsorption energies of larger CNTs, approaching the\ngraphene limit, thus bridging the gap between CNTs of increasing radius and\nflat graphene sheets.\n", "  Multifunctional materials composed of ultrathin magnetic films with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy combined with ferroelectric substrates\nrepresent a new approach toward low power, fast, high density spintronics. Here\nwe demonstrate Co/Ni multilayered films with tunable saturation magnetization\nand perpendicular anisotropy grown directly on ferroelectric PZT\n[Pb(Zr_xTi_1-x)O_3] substrate plates. Electric fields up to +/- 2 MV/m expand\nthe PZT by 0.1% and generate at least 0.02% in-plane compression in the Co/Ni\nmultilayered film. Modifying the strain with a voltage can reduce the coercive\nfield by over 30%. We also demonstrate that alternating in-plane tensile and\ncompressive strains (less than 0.01%) can be used to propagate magnetic domain\nwalls. This ability to manipulate high anisotropy magnetic thin films could\nprove useful for lowering the switching energy for magnetic elements in future\nvoltage-controlled spintronic devices.\n", "  Recent high-quality observations of dwarf and low surface brightness (LSB)\ngalaxies have shown that their dark matter (DM) halos prefer flat central\ndensity profiles. On the other hand the standard cold dark matter model\nsimulations predict a more cuspy behavior. Feedback from star formation has\nbeen widely used to reconcile simulations with observations, this might be\nsuccessful in field dwarf galaxies but its success in low mass galaxies remains\nuncertain. One model that have received much attention is the scalar field dark\nmatter model. Here the dark matter is a self-interacting ultra light scalar\nfield that forms a cosmological Bose-Einstein condensate, a mass of\n$10^{-22}$eV/c$^2$ is consistent with flat density profiles in the centers of\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies, reduces the abundance of small halos, might account\nfor the rotation curves even to large radii in spiral galaxies and has an early\ngalaxy formation. The next generation of telescopes will provide better\nconstraints to the model that will help to distinguish this particular\nalternative to the standard model of cosmology shedding light into the nature\nof the mysterious dark matter.\n", "  A common problem in teaching Physics in secondary school is due to the gap in\nterms of difficulty between the physical concepts and the mathematical tools\nwhich are necessary to study them quantitatively. Advanced statistical\nestimators are commonly introduced only a couple of years later than some\ncommon physical topics, such as e.g. the electronic circuit analysis. Filling\nthis gap with alternative methods appears to be opportune, in order to let the\nstudents reach a full comprehension of the issue they are facing with. In this\nwork we use a smartphone camera and GeoGebra to propose a visual method for\nunderstanding the physical meaning of a fitting process. The time constant of\nan RC circuit is estimated by fitting the discharge curve of a capacitor\nvisualized on the screen of an oscilloscope.\n", "  Viable non-perturbative methods for lattice quantum field theories on curved\nmanifolds are difficult. By adapting features from the traditional finite\nelement methods (FEM) and Regge Calculus, a new simplicial lattice Quantum\nFinite Element (QFE) Lagrangian is constructed for fields on a smooth Riemann\nmanifold. To reach the continuum limit additional counter terms must be\nconstructed to cancel the ultraviolet distortions. This is tested by the\ncomparison of phi 4-th theory at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with the exact\nIsing (c =1/2) CFT on a 2D Riemann sphere. The Dirac equation is also\nconstructed on a simplicial lattice approximation to a Riemann manifold by\nintroducing a lattice vierbein and spin connection on each link. Convergence of\nthe QFE Dirac equation is tested against the exact solution for the 2D Riemann\nsphere. Future directions and applications to Conformal Field Theories are\nsuggested.\n", "  By using single-DNA observation with fluorescence microscopy, we observed the\neffects of divalent and trivalent cations on the higher-order structure of\ngiant DNA (T4 DNA with 166 kbp). It was found that divalent cations, such as\nMg(2+) and Ca(2+), inhibit DNA compaction induced by a trivalent cation,\nspermidine (SPD(3+)). On the other hand, in the absence of SPD(3+), divalent\ncations cause the shrinkage of DNA. These experimental observations are\ninconsistent with the well-established Debye-Huckel scheme regarding the\nshielding effect of counter ions, which is given as the additivity of\ncontributions of cations with different valences. We interpreted the\ncompetition between 2+ and 3+ cations in terms of the change in the\ntranslational entropy of the counter ions before and after the folding\ntransition of DNA. For the compaction with SPD(3+), we considered the increase\nin translational entropy due to the ion-exchange of the intrinsic monovalent\ncations condensing on a highly-charged polyelectrolyte, double-stranded DNA, by\nthe 3+ cations. In contrast, the presence of 2+ cation decreases the gain of\nentropy owe to the ion-exchange between monovalent and 3+ ions.\n", "  Subwavelength structured surfaces, known as metasurfaces, hold promise for\nfuture compact and optically thin devices with versatile functionalities. Here,\nby revisiting the concept of detour phase at the basis of the first computer\ngenerated holograms we have designed high-performance transmissive dielectric\nmeta-holograms with new functionalities. In one class of such devices\nwavelength- independent phase masks have been generated by compensating the\ninherent dispersion of the detour phase with that of the subwavelength\nstructures. This leads to broadband operation from the visible to the near\ninfrared with efficiency as high as 75% in the 1000 to 1400 nm range. We have\nalso shown that we can fully control the effective focal length of the imaging\noptical system by incorporating a lens-like function in the meta-hologram. In a\nsecond class of devices we have incorporated in the phase map a geometric phase\nto achieve for the first time chiral imaging: the projection of different\nimages depends on the handedness of the reference beam. The compactness,\nlightweight and ability to produce images even at large angles of our devices\nhave significant potential for important emerging applications such as wearable\noptics.\n", "  Monolayer MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) has drawn much attention recently for\nits possible application possibilities for optoelectronics, spintronics, and\nvalleytronics. Its exotic optical and electronic properties include a direct\nband gap, circular polarization dependent optical transitions, and valence band\n(VB) spin band splitting at the $K$ and $-K$ points. These properties can be\ndescribed within a minimal model, called the massive Dirac fermion model for\nwhich the parameters need to be experimentally determined. We propose that the\nparameters can be obtained from angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) data from\nbulk 2H-MX$_2$, instead of monolayer MX$_2$. Through tight binding\ncalculations, we show how the electronic structure at high symmetry points\nevolves as the system changes from the monolayer to the three dimensional bulk\n2H-MX$_2$ . We find vanishing $k_z$ dispersion and almost no change in the\ndirect band gap at the $K$ and $-K$ points, in sharp contrast to the strong\n$k_z$ dispersion at the $\\Gamma$ point. These facts allow us to extract the gap\nand spin band splitting at the $K$ point as well as the hopping energy from\nbulk ARPES data. We performed ARPES experiments on single crystals of MoS$_2$,\nMoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ at various photon energies and also with\npotassium evaporation. From the data, we determined the parameters for the\nmassive Dirac fermion model for monolayer MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and\nWSe$_2$.\n", "  We treat the question of bottomonia suppression in ultrarelativistic heavy\nion collisions (URHIC) as a dynamical open quantum problem, tackled for the\nfirst time using the Schr\\\"odinger-Langevin equation. Coupling this equation to\nthe EPOS2 event generator, predictions are made for the nuclear modification\nfactor of $\\Upsilon (1S)$ and $\\Upsilon (2S)$.\n", "  We demonstrate a prototype of a Focused Ion Beam machine based on the\nionization of a laser-cooled cesium beam adapted for imaging and modifying\ndifferent surfaces in the few-tens nanometer range. Efficient atomic ionization\nis obtained by laser promoting ground-state atoms into a target excited Rydberg\nstate, then field-ionizing them in an electric field gradient. The method\nallows obtaining ion currents up to 130 pA. Comparison with the standard direct\nphoto-ionization of the atomic beam shows, in our conditions, a 40-times larger\nion yield. Preliminary imaging results at ion energies in the 1-5 keV range are\nobtained with a resolution around 40 nm, in the present version of the\nprototype. Our ion beam is expected to be extremely monochromatic, with an\nenergy spread of the order of 1 eV, offering great prospects for lithography,\nimaging and surface analysis.\n", "  The dynamical phenomena of complex networks are very difficult to predict\nfrom local information due to the rich microstructures and corresponding\ncomplex dynamics. On the other hands, it is a horrible job to compute some\nstochastic parameters of a large network having thousand and thousand nodes. We\ndesign several recursive algorithms for finding spanning trees having maximal\nleaves (MLS-trees) in investigation of topological structures of Sierpinski\ngrowing network models, and use MLS-trees to determine the kernels, dominating\nand balanced sets of the models. We propose a new stochastic method for the\nmodels, called the edge-cumulative distribution, and show that it obeys a power\nlaw distribution.\n", "  We are developing a Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance Detector (LEKID) array\nable to operate in the W-band (75-110 GHz) in order to perform ground-based\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and mm-wave astronomical observations. The\nW-band is close to optimal in terms of contamination of the CMB from Galactic\nsynchrotron, free-free, and thermal interstellar dust. In this band, the\natmosphere has very good transparency, allowing interesting ground-based\nobservations with large (>30 m) telescopes, achieving high angular resolution\n(<0.4 arcmin). In this work we describe the startup measurements devoted to the\noptimization of a W-band camera/spectrometer prototype for large aperture\ntelescopes like the 64 m SRT (Sardinia Radio Telescope). In the process of\nselecting the best superconducting film for the LEKID, we characterized a 40 nm\nthick Aluminum 2-pixel array. We measured the minimum frequency able to break\nCPs (i.e. $h\\nu=2\\Delta\\left(T_{c}\\right)=3.5k_{B}T_{c}$) obtaining $\\nu=95.5$\nGHz, that corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.31 K. This is not suitable\nto cover the entire W-band. For an 80 nm layer the minimum frequency decreases\nto 93.2 GHz, which corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.28 K; this value\nis still suboptimal for W-band operation. Further increase of the Al film\nthickness results in bad performance of the detector. We have thus considered a\nTitanium-Aluminum bi-layer (10 nm thick Ti + 25 nm thick Al, already tested in\nother laboratories), for which we measured a critical temperature of 820 mK and\na cut-on frequency of 65 GHz: so this solution allows operation in the entire\nW-band.\n", "  The phonon spectrum of cubic cadmium metastannate and the crystal structures\nof its distorted phases were calculated from first principles within the\ndensity functional theory. It is shown that the phonon spectrum and the energy\nspectrum of distorted phases in $\\alpha$-CdSnO$_3$ are surprisingly similar to\nthe corresponding spectra of CdTiO$_3$. The ground state of $\\alpha$-CdSnO$_3$\nis the ferroelectric $Pbn2_1$ phase; the energy gain accompanying the phase\ntransition from the nonpolar $Pbnm$ phase to this phase is $\\sim$30 meV and the\nspontaneous polarization in it is 0.25 C/m$^2$. An analysis of the eigenvector\nof the ferroelectric mode in $\\alpha$-CdSnO$_3$ and calculations of the partial\ndensities of states indicates that the ferroelectric instability in this\ncrystal, which does not contain $d$ transition elements, is associated with the\nformation of a covalent bonding between Cd and O atoms.\n", "  Among the magnificent temple complexes built during the Khmer empire, two\nsingle out both for their distance from the Angkor heartland as well as for\ntheir anomalous, not cardinal, orientation: Koh Ker and Preah Khan of Kompong\nSvay. Their orientations are shown here to be connected with two relevant\nastronomical phenomena, namely the zenith passages of the sun and the rising of\nthe Moon at the northern maximal standstill, respectively.\n", "  We briefly discuss the main effects of the presence of a Light Sterile\nNeutrino (LS$\\nu$) in Cosmology and how its properties can be constrained by\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and other cosmological measurements.\n", "  Recent highlights from the HERA experiments, Hermes, H1 and ZEUS, are\nreviewed and ideas for future analyses to fully exploit this unique data set\nare proposed. This document is a summary of a workshop on future physics with\nHERA data held at DESY, Hamburg at the end of 2014. All areas of HERA physics\nare covered and contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are\nincluded. The document outlines areas where HERA physics can still make a\nsignificant contribution, principally in a deeper understanding of QCD, and its\nrelevance to other facilities. Within the framework of the Data Preservation in\nHigh Energy Physics, the HERA data have been preserved for analyses to take\nplace over a timescale of 10 years and more. Therefore, although an extensive\nlist of possibilities is presented here, safe storage of the data ensures that\nit can also be used in the far future should new ideas and analyses be\nproposed.\n", "  With the purpose to devise a novel lasing scheme, we consider a two level\nsystem with both a transversal and longitudinal coupling to the electromagnetic\nfield. If the longitudinal coupling is sufficiently strong, multi-photon\ntransitions become possible. We assume furthermore that the electromagnetic\nenvironment has a spectrum with a single sharp resonance, which serves as a\nlasing cavity. Additionally, the electromagnetic environment should have a very\nbroad resonance around a frequency which differs form the sharp resonance. We\nuse the polaron transformation and derive a rate equation to describe the\ndynamics of such system. We find that lasing at the frequency of the sharp mode\nis possible, if the energy difference of the atomic transition is similar to\nthe sum of the frequencies of both peaks in the spectral function. This allows\nfor the creation of lasing over a large frequency range and may in perspective\nenable THz lasing at room temperature.\n", "  Flexible fiber-optic endoscopes provide a minimally-invasive solution for\nimaging at depths beyond the reach of conventional microscopes. Current\nendoscopes require focusing and/or scanning mechanisms at the distal end, which\nlimit miniaturization and frame-rate, and induce aberrations. Alternative\nlensless solutions are based on adaptive wavefront-correction, but are\nextremely sensitive to fiber bending. Here, we demonstrate a novel endoscopic\napproach, which enables single-shot imaging at a variable working distance\nthrough a conventional fiber bundle, without the use of any distal optics. Our\napproach computationally retrieves the object image from a single speckle\npattern transmitted through the bundle, exploiting phase information preserved\nthrough inherent angular speckle correlations. Unlike conventional fiber-bundle\nendoscopes, the resulting image is unpixelated, the resolution is\ndiffraction-limited, objects can be imaged at variable working distance, and\nthe technique is completely insensitive to fiber bending. Since no optical\nelements are required, miniaturization is limited only by the bundle diameter.\n", "  The aim of this document is to summarise the discussion and the contributions\nfrom the 2nd Academia-Industry Matching Event on Detecting Neutrons with MPGDs\nwhich took place at CERN on the 16th and the 17th of March 2015. These events\nprovide a platform for discussing the prospects of Micro-Pattern Gaseous\nDetectors (MPGDs) for thermal and fast neutron detection, commercial\nconstraints and possible solutions. The aim is to foster the collaboration\nbetween the particle physics community, the neutron detector users, instrument\nscientists and fabricants.\n", "  A theoretical investigation on slow light propagation based on\neletromagnetically induced transparency in a three-level quantum-dot system is\nperformed including non-Markovian effects and correlated dephasing reservoirs.\nIt is demonstraonated that the non-Markovian nature of the process is quite\nessential even for conventional dephasing typical of quantum dots leading to\nsignificant enhancement or inhibition of the group velocity slow-down factor as\nwell as to the shifting and distortion of the transmission window. Furthermore,\nthe correlation between dephasing reservoirs may also either enhance or inhibit\nnon-Markovian effects.\n", "  Domination is the fastest-growing field within graph theory with a profound\ndiversity and impact in real-world applications, such as the recent\nbreakthrough approach that identifies optimized subsets of proteins enriched\nwith cancer-related genes. Despite its conceptual simplicity, domination is a\nclassical NP-complete decision problem which makes analytical solutions elusive\nand poses difficulties to design optimization algorithms for finding a\ndominating set of minimum cardinality in a large network. Here we derive for\nthe first time an approximate analytical solution for the density of the\nminimum dominating set (MDS) by using a combination of cavity method and\nUltra-Discretization (UD) procedure. The derived equation allows us to compute\nthe size of MDS by only using as an input the information of the degree\ndistribution of a given network.\n", "  Associate Editor Manolis Antonoyiannakis discusses the highlighting, as\nEditors' Suggestions, of a small percentage of the papers published each week.\nWe highlight papers primarily for their importance and impact in their\nrespective fields, or because we find them particularly interesting or elegant.\nIt turns out that the additional layer of scrutiny involved in the selection of\npapers as Editors' Suggestions is associated with a significantly elevated and\nsustained citation impact.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the near-ultraviolet visible plasmonic\nproperties of three elemental materials from the p-block: Bi, Sb and Ga, with\nthe aim to achieve and exploit unconventional plasmonic effects beyond those\nprovided by noble metals. At such aim, we review and analyze a broad range of\noptically-determined dielectric functions e of these elemental materials\navailable in the literature, covering a wide photon energy range (from 0.03 to\n24 eV). It is shown that the contribution of Drude-like carriers to e1 (real\npart of e) in the near-ultraviolet visible is negligible for Bi and Sb and\nmoderate for Ga. In contrast, the interband transitions of these elemental\nmaterials show a high oscillator strength that yields a strong negative\ncontribution to e1 in the near-ultraviolet visible. Therefore in these\nmaterials interband transitions are not a mere damping channel detrimental to\nplasmonic properties. Remarkably, these interband transitions induce fully\n(partially) the localized surface plasmon-like resonances taking place in Bi\nand Sb (Ga) nanostructures in the near-ultraviolet visible. Plasmonic\nproperties achieved through interband transitions, without Drude-like carrier\nexcitation, are very attractive phenomena because they may give rise to a rich\nand broad class of nanostructures and metamaterials in which plasmonic effects\nwill be tunable through the tailoring of band structure and by the occupancy of\nelectronic states.\n", "  Using Poisson-Boltzmann equation and linear response theory, we derive an\neffective interaction potential due to a fixed charge distribution in a\nsolution containing polyelectrolytes and point salt. We obtain an expression\nfor the effective potential in terms of static structure factor using the\nintegral equation theories. To demonstrate the theory we apply it to Gaussian\nand rod-like polyelectrolytes and make connections to earlier theoretical works\nin some exact limits. We explore the role of both intra and inter polymer\ncorrelations, and the geometry of the polymers in the development of attractive\nregions in the effective potential as well as their effects on the screening\nlengths.\n", "  Hydrodynamics of gases in the classical domain are examined from the\nperspective that the gas has a well-defined wavefunction description at all\ntimes. Specifically, the internal energy and volume exclusion of decorrelated\nvortex structures are included so that quantum corrections and modifications to\nNavier-Stokes behavior can be derived. This leads to a small deviation in rigid\nbody rotation for a cylindrically bound gas and the internal energy changes\nassociated with vorticity give deviations in the Reynolds' transport theorem.\nSome macroscopic observable features arising from this include variations in\nthe specific heat, an anisotropic correction to thermal conductivity and a\nvariation in optical scattering as a function of the declination from the axis\nof local vorticity. The improvements in magneto-optical traps suggests some\ninteresting experiments to be done in higher temperature regimes where they are\nnot usually employed. It is argued that the finite lifetime of observed\nvortices in ultracold bosonic gases is only apparent and these volume excluding\nstructures persist in generating angular momentum and pressure in the cloud in\na non-imageable form.\n", "  We show that under natural technical conditions, the sum of a $C^2$\ndynamically defined Cantor set with a compact set in most cases (for almost all\nparameters) has positive Lebesgue measure, provided that the sum of the\nHausdorff dimensions of these sets exceeds one. As an application, we show that\nfor many parameters, the Square Fibonacci Hamiltonian has spectrum of positive\nLebesgue measure, while at the same time the density of states measure is\npurely singular.\n", "  We consider the smoothed multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation $$d\nu_{\\eps,t}= \\frac 12 \\Delta u_{\\eps,t} d t+ \\beta \\eps^{\\frac{d-2}{2}}\\, \\,\nu_{\\eps, t} \\, d B_{\\eps,t} , \\;\\;u_{\\eps,0}=1,$$ in dimension $d\\geq 3$, where\n$B_{\\eps,t}$ is a spatially smoothed (at scale $\\eps$) space-time white noise,\nand $\\beta>0$ is a parameter. We show the existence of a $\\bar\\beta\\in\n(0,\\infty)$ so that the solution exhibits weak disorder when $\\beta<\\bar\\beta$\nand strong disorder when $\\beta > \\bar\\beta$. The proof techniques use elements\nof the theory of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos.\n", "  We discuss the current status and future prospects of heavy neutrino searches\nat the energy frontier, which might play an important role in vindicating the\nsimplest seesaw paradigm as the new physics responsible for neutrino mass\ngeneration. After summarizing the current search limits and potential\nimprovements at hadron colliders, we highlight the unparalleled sensitivities\nachievable in the clean environment of future lepton colliders.\n", "  A group theoretical description of the Majorana-Oppenheimer quantum\nelectrodynamics is considered. Different spinor realizations of the Maxwell and\nDirac fields are discussed. A representation of the Majorana-Oppenheimer wave\nequations in terms of the Gel'fand-Yaglom formalism is given.\n", "  We consider the Riemannian universal covering of a compact manifold $M = X /\n\\Gamma$ and assume that $\\Gamma$ is amenable. We show for an ergodic random\nfamily of Schr\\\"odinger operators on $X$ the existence of a (non-random)\nintegrated density of states.\n", "  We consider the quantum site percolation model on graphs with an amenable\ngroup action. It consists of a random family of Hamiltonians. Basic spectral\nproperties of these operators are derived: non-randomness of the spectrum and\nits components, existence of an self-averaging integrated density of states and\nan associated trace-formula.\n", "  We study the family of Hamiltonians which corresponds to the adjacency\noperators on a percolation graph. We characterise the set of energies which are\nalmost surely eigenvalues with finitely supported eigenfunctions. This set of\nenergies is a dense subset of the algebraic integers. The integrated density of\nstates has discontinuities precisely at this set of energies. We show that the\nconvergence of the integrated densities of states of finite box Hamiltonians to\nthe one on the whole space holds even at the points of discontinuity. For this\nwe use an equicontinuity-from-the-right argument. The same statements hold for\nthe restriction of the Hamiltonian to the infinite cluster. In this case we\nprove that the integrated density of states can be constructed using local data\nonly. Finally we study some mixed Anderson-Quantum percolation models and\nestablish results in the spirit of Wegner, and Delyon and Souillard.\n", "  We study spectra of Schr\\\"odinger operators on $\\RR^d$. First we consider a\npair of operators which differ by a compactly supported potential, as well as\nthe corresponding semigroups. We prove almost exponential decay of the singular\nvalues $\\mu_n$ of the difference of the semigroups as $n\\to \\infty$ and deduce\nbounds on the spectral shift function of the pair of operators.\n  Thereafter we consider alloy type random Schr\\\"odinger operators. The single\nsite potential $u$ is assumed to be non-negative and of compact support. The\ndistributions of the random coupling constants are assumed to be H\\\"older\ncontinuous. Based on the estimates for the spectral shift function, we prove a\nWegner estimate which implies H\\\"older continuity of the integrated density of\nstates.\n", "  We prove a localization theorem for continuous ergodic Schr\\\"odinger\noperators $ H_\\omega := H_0 + V_\\omega $, where the random potential $ V_\\omega\n$ is a nonnegative Anderson-type perturbation of the periodic operator $ H_0$.\nWe consider a lower spectral band edge of $ \\sigma (H_0) $, say $ E= 0 $, at a\ngap which is preserved by the perturbation $ V_\\omega $. Assuming that all\nFloquet eigenvalues of $ H_0$, which reach the spectral edge 0 as a minimum,\nhave there a positive definite Hessian, we conclude that there exists an\ninterval $ I $ containing 0 such that $ H_\\omega $ has only pure point spectrum\nin $ I $ for almost all $ \\omega $.\n", "  Stochastic interdependence of a probablility distribution on a product space\nis measured by its Kullback-Leibler distance from the exponential family of\nproduct distributions (called multi-information). Here we investigate\nlow-dimensional exponential families that contain the maximizers of stochastic\ninterdependence in their closure.\n  Based on a detailed description of the structure of probablility\ndistributions with globally maximal multi-information we obtain our main\nresult: The exponential family of pure pair-interactions contains all global\nmaximizers of the multi-information in its closure.\n", "  The modifications of hadronic masses and decay widths at finite temperature\nand baryon density are investigated using a phenomenological model of hadronic\ninteractions in the Relativistic Hartree Approximation. We consider an\nexhaustive set of hadronic reactions and vector meson decays to estimate the\nphoton emission from hot and dense hadronic matter. The reduction in the vector\nmeson masses and decay widths is seen to cause an enhancement in the photon\nproduction. It is observed that the effect of $\\rho$-decay width on photon\nspectra is negligible. The effects on dilepton production from pion\nannihilation are also indicated.\n", "  The formalism of photon and dilepton productions in a thermal bath are\ndiscussed in the frame work of finite temperature field theory. The emission\nrate has been expressed in terms of the discontinuities or imaginary part of\nthe photon self energy in the thermal bath. The photon and dilepton emissions\nhave been computed by taking into account the in-medium modifications of the\nparticles appearing in the internal loop of the self energy diagram using a\nphenomenological effective lagrangian approach. The results has been compared\nwith the photon spectra measured by WA 98 collaboration at CERN SPS energies.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a cold trapped ion coupled to the quantized\nfield inside a high-finesse cavity, considering exact resonance between the\nionic internal levels and the field (carrier transition). We derive an\nintensity-dependent hamiltonian in which terms proportional to the square of\nthe Lamb-Dicke parameter ($\\eta$) are retained. We show that different\nnonclassical effects arise in the dynamics of the ionic population inversion,\ndepending on the initial states of the vibrational motion/field and on the\nvalues of $\\eta$.\n"]}
