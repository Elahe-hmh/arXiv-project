the stack of maps from stable marked\ncurves to the quotient stack [point/GL(1)], and use it to construct some\ngauge-theoretic analogues of the Gromov-Witten invariants. We also indicate the\ngeneralization of these invariants to the quotient stacks [X/GL(1)], where X is\na smooth proper complex algebraic variety.\n", "  Statistical mechanics has proven to be able to capture the fundamental rules\nunderlying phenomena of social aggregation and opinion dynamics, well studied\nin disciplines like sociology and psychology. This approach is based on the\nunderlying paradigm that the interesting dynamics of multi-agent systems emerge\nfrom the correct definition of few parameters governing the evolution of each\nindividual. Into this context, we propose a new model of opinion dynamics based\non the psychological construct named \"cognitive dissonance\". Our system is made\nof interacting individuals, the agents, each bearing only two dynamical\nvariables (respectively \"opinion\" and \"affinity\") self-consistently adjusted\nduring time evolution. We also define two special classes of interacting\nentities, both acting for a peace mediation process but via different course of\naction: \"diplomats\" and \"auctoritates\". The behaviour of the system with and\nwithout peace mediators (PMs) is investigated and discussed with reference to\ncorresponding psychological and social implications.\n", "  Even though neutrinos and antineutrinos are everywhere in the Universe, their\ncritical importance might be overlooked, especially because that at least one\nspecies of neutrinos has the mass 0.058 eV, far larger than the cosmic\nthermalization temperature 1.9^\\circ K. The non-zero mass makes neutrinos\nparticipate the galaxy formation from the very beginning, in view of the\nprocess of clustering. Unlike the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic\nbackground neutrinos (CB\\nu) cannot be uniform. Thus, we wish to examine the\nquestions such as: Is there some new source for neutrinos or antineutrinos,\nthat might be detectible experimentally? Is there some new interaction of\nneutrinos with the visible world, that may be of numerical importance at, e.g.,\nthe ultra high energies (\\ge 10^{13} eV)? One major conclusion is that, on the\nbasis of the Standard Model, neutrinos would eventually become the {\\it only}\ndark-matter species left in our Universe.\n  Our Cosmos is limited in energy for various particles, electrons or photons\nwithout threshold, while protons or neutrinos having the following hurdles to\novercome in reaching extreme energies such as 10^{18} eV. In an electron-rich\nmedium, the threshold is 10^{15} eV for an ultra high energy (UHECR) proton,\ndue to p + e^- \\to n + \\nu_e. On the other hand, the cosmic background\nneutrinos would cut off UHECR neutrinos of greater than 10^{13} eV if at least\none kind of neutrinos has the mass 0.05 eV (as suggested by the experimental\nvalue of 0.058 eV), due to \\nu +{\\bar \\nu}_{CB} \\to e^- + e^+; this, plus the\nclustering due to mass, gives us some hope that this effect might be\ndetectible.\n", "  We revisit the Mittag-Leffler functions of a real variable $t$, with one, two\nand three order-parameters $\\{\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma\\}$, as far as their Laplace\ntransform pairs and complete monotonicty properties are concerned. These\nfunctions, subjected to the requirement to be completely monotone for $t>0$,\nare shown to be suitable models for non--Debye relaxation phenomena in\ndielectrics including as particular cases the classical models referred to as\nCole-Cole, Davidson-Cole and Havriliak-Negami. We show 3D plots of the response\nfunctions and of the corresponding spectral distributions, keeping fixed one of\nthe three order-parameters.\n", "  We present a general theory about electron orbital motions in topological\ninsulators. An in-plane electric field drives spin-up and spin-down electrons\nbending to opposite directions, and skipping orbital motions, a counterpart of\nthe integer quantum Hall effect, are formed near the boundary of the sample.\nThe accompanying Zitterbewegung can be found and controlled by tuning external\nelectric fields. Ultrafast flipping electron spin leads to a quantum side jump\nin the topological insulator, and a snake-orbit motion in two-dimensional\nelectron gas with spin-orbit interactions. This feature provides a way to\ncontrol electron orbital motion by manipulating electron spin.\n", "  Let $\\DD$ be a simply connected, smooth enough domain of $\\bbR^2$. For $L>0$\nconsider the continuous time, zero-temperature heat bath dynamics for the\nnearest-neighbor Ising model on $\\mathbb Z^2$ with initial condition such that\n$\\sigma_x=-1$ if $x\\in L\\DD$ and $\\sigma_x=+1$ otherwise. It is conjectured\n\\cite{cf:Spohn} that, in the diffusive limit where space is rescaled by $L$,\ntime by $L^2$ and $L\\to\\infty$, the boundary of the droplet of \"$-$\" spins\nfollows a \\emph{deterministic} anisotropic curve-shortening flow, where the\nnormal velocity at a point of its boundary is given by the local curvature\ntimes an explicit function of the local slope. The behavior should be similar\nat finite temperature $T<T_c$, with a different temperature-dependent\nanisotropy function. We prove this conjecture (at zero temperature) when $\\DD$\nis convex. Existence and regularity of the solution of the deterministic\ncurve-shortening flow is not obvious \\textit{a priori} and is part of our\nresult. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of mean curvature-type\ndroplet shrinking for a model with genuine microscopic dynamics.\n", "  In this paper, the one-dimensional time-fractional diffusion-wave equation\nwith the fractional derivative of order $1 \\le \\alpha \\le 2$ is revisited. This\nequation interpolates between the diffusion and the wave equations that behave\nquite differently regarding their response to a localized disturbance: whereas\nthe diffusion equation describes a process, where a disturbance spreads\ninfinitely fast, the propagation speed of the disturbance is a constant for the\nwave equation. For the time fractional diffusion-wave equation, the propagation\nspeed of a disturbance is infinite, but its fundamental solution possesses a\nmaximum that disperses with a finite speed. In this paper, the fundamental\nsolution of the Cauchy problem for the time-fractional diffusion-wave equation,\nits maximum location, maximum value, and other important characteristics are\ninvestigated in detail. To illustrate analytical formulas, results of numerical\ncalculations and plots are presented. Numerical algorithms and programs used to\nproduce plots are discussed.\n", "  The problem of galactic formation and evolution should be solved on the basis\nof the Standard Model of particle physics. We believe that we live in the\nquantum 4-dimensional Minkowski space-time with the force-fields gauge-group\nstructure SU_c(3) \\times SU_L(2) \\times U(1) \\times SU_f(3) built-in from the\nvery beginning, i.e., the \"background\" of our world. From this \"background\", we\ncan see the lepton world, of atomic sizes, and also the quark world, of\n(fermi)^3 sizes. Basing on this belief, we study galactic formation and\nevolution, concluding that our Cosmos should end up with \"model\" galaxies. A\nmodel galaxy is the one in which a spiral visible ordinary-matter galaxy, such\nas our Milky Way and satellites, is surrounded by a huge dark-matter neutrino\nhalo. As a byproduct (of studying the Standard Model), we find that neutrinos\nwill be the {\\it only long-lived} dark-matter particles.\n", "  Divertor strike point splitting induced by resonant magnetic perturbations\n(RMPs) has been observed on MAST for a variety of RMP configurations in a\nplasma scenario with Ip=750kA where those configurations all have similar\nresonant components. Complementary measurements have been obtained with\ndivertor Langmuir probes and an infrared camera. Clear splitting consistently\nappears in this scenario only in the even configuration of the perturbation\ncoils, similarly to the density pump-out. These results present a challenge for\nmodels of plasma response to RMPs.\n", "  We demonstrate how adversaries with unbounded computing resources can break\nQuantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols which employ a particular message\nauthentication code suggested previously. This authentication code, featuring\nlow key consumption, is not Information-Theoretically Secure (ITS) since for\neach message the eavesdropper has intercepted she is able to send a different\nmessage from a set of messages that she can calculate by finding collisions of\na cryptographic hash function. However, when this authentication code was\nintroduced it was shown to prevent straightforward Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)\nattacks against QKD protocols.\n  In this paper, we prove that the set of messages that collide with any given\nmessage under this authentication code contains with high probability a message\nthat has small Hamming distance to any other given message. Based on this fact\nwe present extended MITM attacks against different versions of BB84 QKD\nprotocols using the addressed authentication code; for three protocols we\ndescribe every single action taken by the adversary. For all protocols the\nadversary can obtain complete knowledge of the key, and for most protocols her\nsuccess probability in doing so approaches unity.\n  Since the attacks work against all authentication methods which allow to\ncalculate colliding messages, the underlying building blocks of the presented\nattacks expose the potential pitfalls arising as a consequence of non-ITS\nauthentication in QKD-postprocessing. We propose countermeasures, increasing\nthe eavesdroppers demand for computational power, and also prove necessary and\nsufficient conditions for upgrading the discussed authentication code to the\nITS level.\n", "  We describe the design, fabrication and testing of a surface-electrode ion\ntrap, which incorporates microwave waveguides, resonators and coupling elements\nfor the manipulation of trapped ion qubits using near-field microwaves. The\ntrap is optimised to give a large microwave field gradient to allow\nstate-dependent manipulation of the ions' motional degrees of freedom, the key\nto multiqubit entanglement. The microwave field near the centre of the trap is\ncharacterised by driving hyperfine transitions in a single laser-cooled 43Ca+\nion.\n", "  We have implemented a Langevin approach for the transport of heavy quarks in\nthe UrQMD hybrid model. The UrQMD hybrid approach provides a realistic\ndescription of the background medium for the evolution of relativistic heavy\nion collisions. We have used two different sets of drag and diffusion\ncoefficients, one based on a $T$-Matrix approach and one based on a resonance\nmodel for the elastic scattering of heavy quarks within the medium. In case of\nthe resonance model we have investigated the effects of different decoupling\ntemperatures of the heavy quarks from the medium, ranging between\n$130\\,\\text{MeV}$ and $180\\,\\text{MeV}$. We present calculations of the nuclear\nmodification factor $R_{AA}$, as well as of the elliptic flow $v_2$ in Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200\\,\\text{GeV}$ and Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\\,\\text{TeV}$. To make our results comparable to\nexperimental data at RHIC and LHC we have implemented a Peterson fragmentation\nand a quark coalescence approach followed by the semileptonic decay of the D-\nand B-mesons to electrons. We find that our results strongly depend on the\ndecoupling temperature and the hadronization mechanism. At a decoupling\ntemperature of $130\\,\\text{MeV}$ we reach a good agreement with the\nmeasurements at both, RHIC and LHC energies, simultaneously for the elliptic\nflow $v_2$ and the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$.\n", "  All-spin logic devices are promising candidates to augment and complement\nbeyond-CMOS integrated circuit computing due to non-volatility, ultra-low\noperating voltages, higher logical efficiency, and high density integration.\nHowever, the path to reach lower energy-delay product performance compared to\nCMOS transistors currently is not clear. We show that scaling and engineering\nthe nanoscale magnetic materials and interfaces is the key to realizing spin\nlogic devices that can surpass energy-delay performance of CMOS transistors.\nWith validated stochastic nano-magnetic and vector spin transport numerical\nmodels, we derive the target material and interface properties for the\nnanomagnets and channels. We identified promising new directions for material\nengineering/discovery focusing on systematic scaling of magnetic anisotropy\n(Hk) with saturation magnetization (Ms), use of perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy, and interface spin mixing conductance of ferromagnet/spin channel\ninterface (Gmix). We provide systematic targets for scaling spin logic\nenergy-delay product toward a 2 aJ.ns energy-delay product, comprehending the\nstochastic noise for nanomagnets.\n", "  We study the adaptation dynamics of a maladapted asexual population on rugged\nfitness landscapes with many local fitness peaks. The distribution of\nbeneficial fitness effects is assumed to belong to one of the three extreme\nvalue domains, viz. Weibull, Gumbel and Fr{\\'e}chet. We work in the strong\nselection-weak mutation regime in which beneficial mutations fix sequentially,\nand the population performs an uphill walk on the fitness landscape until a\nlocal fitness peak is reached. A striking prediction of our analysis is that\nthe fitness difference between successive steps follows a pattern of\ndiminishing returns in the Weibull domain and accelerating returns in the\nFr{\\'e}chet domain, as the initial fitness of the population is increased.\nThese trends are found to be robust with respect to fitness correlations. We\nbelieve that this result can be exploited in experiments to determine the\nextreme value domain of the distribution of beneficial fitness effects. Our\nwork here differs significantly from the previous ones that assume the\nselection coefficient to be small. On taking large effect mutations into\naccount, we find that the length of the walk shows different qualitative trends\nfrom those derived using small selection coefficient approximation.\n", "  In this paper, we shall be concerned with geometric functionals and excursion\nprobabilities for some nonlinear transforms evaluated on Fourier components of\nspherical random fields. In particular, we consider both random spherical\nharmonics and their smoothed averages, which can be viewed as random wavelet\ncoefficients in the continuous case. For such fields, we consider smoothed\npolynomial transforms; we focus on the geometry of their excursion sets, and we\nstudy their asymptotic behaviour, in the high-frequency sense. We focus on the\nanalysis of Euler-Poincar\\'{e} characteristics, which can be exploited to\nderive extremely accurate estimates for excursion probabilities. The present\nanalysis is motivated by the investigation of asymmetries and anisotropies in\ncosmological data. The statistics we focus on are also suitable to deal with\nspherical random fields which can only be partially observed, the canonical\nexample being provided by the masking effect of the Milky Way on Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) radiation data.\n", "  We analyse some peculiar properties of the function of the Mittag-Leffler\n(M-L) type, e_alpha(t):= E_alpha(-t^alpha) for 0 <alpha < 1 and t > 0, which is\nknown to be completely monotone (CM) with a non negative spectrum of\nfrequencies and times, suitable to model fractional relaxation processes. We\nfirst note that these two spectra coincide so providing a universal scaling\nproperty of this function. Furthermore, we consider the problem of\napproximating our M-L function with simpler CM functions for small and large\ntimes. We provide two different sets of elementary CM functions that are\nasymptotically equivalent to e_alpha(t) as t to 0 and t to infty.\n", "  The fractional Poisson process and the Wright process (as discretization of\nthe stable subordinator) along with their diffusion limits play eminent roles\nin theory and simulation of fractional diffusion processes. Here we have\nanalyzed these two processes, concretely the corresponding counting number and\nErlang processes, the latter being the processes inverse to the former.\nFurthermore we have obtained the diffusion limits of all these processes by\nwell-scaled refinement of waiting times and jumps\n", "  We report on high-field electron spin resonance (ESR) studies of magnetic\nexcitations in the spin-1/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$.\nFrequency-field diagrams of ESR excitations are measured for different\norientations of magnetic fields up to 25 T. We show that the substantial\nzero-field energy gap, $\\Delta\\approx9.5$ K, observed in the low-temperature\nexcitation spectrum of Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$ [Zvyagin $et~al.$, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112,\n077206 (2014)], is present well above $T_N$. Noticeably, the transition into\nthe long-range magnetically ordered phase does not significantly affect the\nsize of the gap, suggesting that even below $T_N$ the high-energy spin dynamics\nin Cs$_2$CuBr$_4$ is determined by short-range-order spin correlations. The\nexperimental data are compared with results of model spin-wave-theory\ncalculations for spin-1/2 triangle-lattice antiferromagnet.\n", "  In this paper, we study rare decays $B_c\\rightarrow D^{(*)}_{s,d}l\\bar{l}$\nwithin the Standard Model. The penguin, box, annihilation, color-favored\ncascade and color-suppressed cascade contributions are included. Based on our\ncalculation, the annihilation and color-favored cascade diagrams play important\nroles in the differential branching fractions, forward-backward asymmetries,\nlongitudinal polarizations of the final vector mesons and leptonic longitudinal\npolarization asymmetries. More importantly, color-favored cascade decays\nlargely enhance the resonance cascade contributions. To avoid the resonance\ncascade contribution pollution, new cutting regions are put forward.\n", "  We study the stationary state of a population evolving under the action of\nrandom genetic drift, selection and recombination in which both deleterious and\nreverse beneficial mutations can occur. We find that the equilibrium fraction\nof deleterious mutations decreases as the population size is increased. We\ncalculate exactly the steady state frequency in a nonrecombining population\nwhen population size is infinite and for a neutral finite population, and\nobtain bounds on the fraction of deleterious mutations. We also find that for\nsmall and very large populations, the number of deleterious mutations depends\nweakly on recombination, but for moderately large populations, recombination\nalleviates the effect of deleterious mutations. An analytical argument shows\nthat recombination decreases disadvantageous mutations appreciably when\nbeneficial mutations are rare as is the case in adapting microbial populations,\nwhereas it has a moderate effect on codon bias where the mutation rates between\nthe preferred and unpreferred codons are comparable.\n", "  We propose a surface ion trap design incorporating microwave control\nelectrodes for near-field single-qubit control. The electrodes are arranged so\nas to provide arbitrary frequency, amplitude and polarization control of the\nmicrowave field in one trap zone, while a similar set of electrodes is used to\nnull the residual microwave field in a neighbouring zone. The geometry is\nchosen to reduce the residual field to the 0.5% level without nulling fields;\nwith nulling, the crosstalk may be kept close to the 0.01% level for realistic\nmicrowave amplitude and phase drift. Using standard photolithography and\nelectroplating techniques, we have fabricated a proof-of-principle electrode\narray with two trapping zones. We discuss requirements for the microwave drive\nsystem and prospects for scalability to a large two-dimensional trap array.\n", "  The nucleosynthesis of elements beyond iron is dominated by neutron captures\nin the s and r processes. However, 32 stable, proton-rich isotopes cannot be\nformed during those processes, because they are shielded from the s-process\nflow and r-process beta-decay chains. These nuclei are attributed to the p and\nrp process.\n  For all those processes, current research in nuclear astrophysics addresses\nthe need for more precise reaction data involving radioactive isotopes.\nDepending on the particular reaction, direct or inverse kinematics, forward or\ntime-reversed direction are investigated to determine or at least to constrain\nthe desired reaction cross sections.\n  The Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) will offer unique,\nunprecedented opportunities to investigate many of the important reactions. The\nhigh yield of radioactive isotopes, even far away from the valley of stability,\nallows the investigation of isotopes involved in processes as exotic as the r\nor rp processes.\n", "  Recently (May-November 2013) highest energy neutrino events have been\npresented by ICECUBE. Most (21) of all these (28) events are cascades shower\nwhose flux exhibits a sharp hardening respect other lower energy atmospheric\nneutrino component, events suggesting an injection of extraterrestrial\nneutrino, mostly nu e, nu tau, making cascades. ICECUBE claimed that a\ncomponent (10:6+5:0 3:6), a third, of these events must be a trace of expected\ndownward muons and-or atmospheric neutrinos (muon track dominated): The\nprobability that this scenario occurs is very poor, about 0.1- 0.5%. The\nparadox might be mitigate as we suggest if nearly all of the 28 events are\noriginated by extraterrestrial sources arriving to us in de-coherent states. At\nfirst sight also a partial solution may rise if highest energy events at E nu >\n60 TeV ( 17 showering versus 4 muon tracks) are mostly of extraterrestrial\nnature. However this solution leaves problematic the earlier 30 - 60 TeV energy\nregion, whose 8 showers versus 3 tracks is in tension with most nearby\natmospheric neutrino signals, by a sharp difference at TeV energy ruled (as\nshown in Deep Core) by ten over one neutrino (muon) events over showers. This\npuzzling (fast) flavor transition from atmospheric nu muon flux at TeV to tens\nTeV showers and muon neutrino absence has deep consequences. Few cascades\nshower events in Antares might also test the nu flavor changes above TeVs up to\na rare one at few tens TeV signal. Higher energy EeV tau air-shower induced by\nUHE nu tau within mountains or Earth skin while skimming terrestrial ground as\nAUGER arrays might be still rare, but the correlated horizontal upward PeVs tau\nair-shower may soon shine into ASHRA crown telescopes at mountain edges by\ntheir Cherenkov flashes.\n", "  We report three new transiting hot-Jupiter planets discovered from the WASP\nsurveys combined with radial velocities from OHP/SOPHIE and Euler/CORALIE and\nphotometry from Euler and TRAPPIST. All three planets are inflated, with radii\n1.7-1.8 Rjup. All orbit hot stars, F5-F7, and all three stars have evolved,\npost-MS radii (1.7-2.2 Rsun). Thus the three planets, with orbits of 1.8-3.9 d,\nare among the most irradiated planets known. This reinforces the correlation\nbetween inflated planets and stellar irradiation.\n", "  A closed equilateral random walk in 3-space is a selection of unit length\nvectors giving the steps of the walk conditioned on the assumption that the sum\nof the vectors is zero. The sample space of such walks with $n$ edges is the\n$(2n-3)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold of equilateral closed polygons in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. We study closed random walks using the symplectic geometry of\nthe $(2n-6)$-dimensional quotient of the manifold of polygons by the action of\nthe rotation group $\\operatorname {SO}(3)$. The basic objects of study are the\nmoment maps on equilateral random polygon space given by the lengths of any\n$(n-3)$-tuple of nonintersecting diagonals. The Atiyah-Guillemin-Sternberg\ntheorem shows that the image of such a moment map is a convex polytope in\n$(n-3)$-dimensional space, while the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem shows that the\npushforward measure on this polytope is Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^{n-3}$.\nTogether, these theorems allow us to define a measure-preserving set of\n\"action-angle\" coordinates on the space of closed equilateral polygons. The new\ncoordinate system allows us to make explicit computations of exact expectations\nfor total curvature and for some chord lengths of closed (and confined)\nequilateral random walks, to give statistical criteria for sampling algorithms\non the space of polygons and to prove that the probability that a randomly\nchosen equilateral hexagon is unknotted is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$. We then use\nour methods to construct a new Markov chain sampling algorithm for equilateral\nclosed polygons, with a simple modification to sample (rooted) confined\nequilateral closed polygons. We prove rigorously that our algorithm converges\ngeometrically to the standard measure on the space of closed random walks, give\na theory of error estimators for Markov chain Monte Carlo integration using our\nmethod and analyze the performance of our method. Our methods also apply to\nopen random walks in certain types of confinement, and in general to walks with\narbitrary (fixed) edgelengths as well as equilateral walks.\n", "  A generalization of the random fluid hydrodynamic fluctuation theory due to\nLandau and Lifshitz is applied to describe cosmological fluctuations in systems\nwith radiation and scalar fields. The viscous pressures, parametrized in terms\nof the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients, and the respective random\nfluctuations in the radiation fluid are combined with the stochastic and\ndissipative scalar evolution equation. This results in a complete set of\nequations describing the perturbations in both scalar and radiation fluids.\nThese derived equations are then studied, as an example, in the context of warm\ninflation. Similar treatments can be done for other cosmological early universe\nscenarios involving thermal or statistical fluctuations.\n", "  The low surface brightness galaxies are gas-rich and yet have a low star\nformation rate, this is a well-known puzzle. The spiral features in these\ngalaxies are weak and difficult to trace, although this aspect has not been\nstudied much. These galaxies are known to be dominated by the dark matter halo\nfrom the innermost regions. Here we do a stability analysis for the galactic\ndisc of UGC 7321, a low surface brightness, superthin galaxy, for which the\nvarious observational input parameters are available. We show that the disc is\nstable against local, linear axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations.\nThe Toomre Q parameter values are found to be large (>> 1) mainly due to the\nlow disc surface density and the high rotation velocity resulting due to the\ndominant dark matter halo, which could explain the observed low star formation\nrate. For the stars-alone case, the disc shows finite swing amplification but\nthe addition of dark matter halo suppresses that amplification almost\ncompletely. Even the inclusion of the low-dispersion gas which constitutes a\nhigh disc mass fraction does not help in causing swing amplification. This can\nexplain why these galaxies do not show strong spiral features. Thus the\ndynamical effect of a halo that is dominant from inner regions can naturally\nexplain why star formation and spiral features are largely suppressed in low\nsurface brightness galaxies, making these different from the high surface\nbrightness galaxies.\n", "  We study Majorana edge states and their topological properties of\none-dimensional(1D) and two-dimensional(2D) Rashba semiconductor deposited on\niron-based superconductor under the applied Zeeman field for various\ndirections. Using the recursive Green's function method, we calculate the local\ndensity of states(LDOS) both for $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$-wave pairings. We\nelucidate that it shows anisotropic response to the applied Zeeman field\nspecific to Majorana edge states. This anisotropy can be understood by the\nwinding number, which shows whether the present system is topological or not.\nThe resulting LDOS and winding numbers for $s_{\\pm}$ and $s_{++}$-wave pairings\nare significantly different at the lower Zeeman field. These results serve as a\nguide to determine the pairing symmetry of iron-pnictide.\n", "  Historically, two complementary approaches to optical quantum information\nprocessing have been pursued: qubits and continuous-variables, each exploiting\neither particle or wave nature of light. However, both approaches have pros and\ncons. In recent years, there has been a significant progress in combining both\napproaches with a view to realizing hybrid protocols that overcome the current\nlimitations. In this chapter, we first review the development of the two\napproaches with a special focus on quantum teleportation and its applications.\nWe then introduce our recent research progress in realizing quantum\nteleportation by a hybrid scheme, and mention its future applications to\nuniversal and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.\n", "  This letter addresses the issue of interfacial crack propagation mechanisms\non various interfaces with using molecular dynamics. Four different interfacial\ncrack propagation manners are recognized by MD simulations: 1, the crack\npropagates along the interface strictly; 2, the nucleation of a twinning at the\ncrack tip leads to the crack tip blunting; 3, the daughter crack appears ahead\nof the main crack and then coalesces to the mother crack; 4, the crack tip\nblunts with stacking fault nucleation at the crack tip. Furthermore, the\nadhesive strength coefficient {\\lambda}is used to identify the type of the\ninterface. Interface with {\\lambda}> 0.9 means an ordered interface, and\ninterfacial crack propagates in mode I or mode II. While {\\lambda}< 0.9\nrepresents a disordered interface, and mode III and mode IV of the interfacial\ncracks are preferred. This work illustrates the effect of adhesive strength of\ninterface on the mechanism of crack propagation along the interface of\nmetal/ceramics nano-composites.\n", "  The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultra-high energy ($>10^{17}$ eV) cosmic\nneutrino detector in phased construction near the South Pole. ARA searches for\nradio Cherenkov emission from particle cascades induced by neutrino\ninteractions in the ice using radio frequency antennas ($\\sim150-800$ MHz)\ndeployed at a design depth of 200 m in the Antarctic ice. A prototype ARA\nTestbed station was deployed at $\\sim30$ m depth in the 2010-2011 season and\nthe first three full ARA stations were deployed in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013\nseasons. We present the first neutrino search with ARA using data taken in 2011\nand 2012 with the ARA Testbed and the resulting constraints on the neutrino\nflux from $10^{17}-10^{21}$ eV.\n", "  Highest energy neutrino events (contained) in cubic km ICECUBE detector\nresulted in last three years to be as many as $37-2=35$ signals (two of those\nhaving been recently discharged); these tens-hundred TeV (32 energetic events)\nup to rarest (only 3) PeV cascade showers, proved to have an extraterrestrial\norigin. The UHE neutrino flavor transition from a $\\nu_{\\mu}$ atmospheric\ndominance (over $\\nu_{e}$ showers at TeV energy), toward a higher energy shower\ncascade ($\\nu_{e}$, $\\nu_{\\tau}$) events at few tens TeV up to PeV energy is a\nhint of such a fast extraterrestrial injection. The majority (28 out of 35) of\nall these events are spherical cascade; their consequent smeared map is\ninconclusive. The additional rarest $9-2=7$ muon tracks, while being sharp in\narrival directions, did not offer any correlated clustering nor any overlapping\nwithin known sources. We recently suggested that the highest energy (tens-TeV)\ncrossing muon along the ICECUBE, mostly at horizons or upcoming, are the ideal\ntool able to reveal soon such clustering or even any narrow angle pointing to\nknown (IR, X, Radio or $\\gamma$) sources or self-correlation in rare doublet or\ntriplet: a last hope for a meaningful and short-time $\\nu$ Astronomy. Any\ncrossing muons clustering along galactic sources or within UHECR arrivals might\nalso probe rarest UHECR event made by nuclei or neutrons. Within three years of\nICECUBE data all the non-contained crossing highest energy muons above few tens\nTeV may be several dozens, possibly around $54$ (27 for upward ones), mostly\nenhanced along horizontal edges, painting known sources and/or self-correlating\nin doublets or rarest triplet (if steady or transient nearby source are at\nsight). Recent preliminary ICECUBE presentation on crossing muons are\nconsistent with present preliminary muon rate estimate.\n", "  We present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poor\nsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of\nTransient Objects (PESSTO). Time series spectroscopy from a few days after\nmaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,\nwith spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly\nover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light\ncurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input\nby magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque\ncircumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our\nsample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the\npossible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to\nbeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading\nsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse\nbehaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic\nparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous\nstudies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be\nviable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase\nluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid\ndrop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or\nthat the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light\ncurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after\nmaximum light. We argue that this could result either from multiple shells of\ncircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of the\nejecta.\n", "  A novel mechanism for the transport of microscale particles in viscous fluids\nis demonstrated. The mechanism exploits the trapping of such particles by\nrotational streaming cells established in the vicinity of an oscillating\ncylinder, recently analyzed in previous work. The present work explores a\nstrategy of transporting particles between the trapping points established by\nmultiple cylinders undergoing oscillations in sequential intervals. It is\ndemonstrated that, by controlling the sequence of oscillation intervals, an\ninertial particle is effectively and predictably transported between the stable\ntrapping points. Arrays of cylinders in various arrangements are investigated,\nrevealing a quite general technique for constructing arbitrary particle\ntrajectories. The timescales for transport are also discussed.\n", "  We consider the adaptation dynamics of an asexual population that walks\nuphill on a rugged fitness landscape which is endowed with large number of\nlocal fitness peaks. We work in a parameter regime where only those mutants\nthat are single mutation away are accessible, as a result of which the\npopulation eventually gets trapped at a local fitness maximum and the adaptive\nwalk terminates. We study how the number of adaptive steps taken by the\npopulation before reaching a local fitness peak depends on the initial fitness\nof the population, the extreme value distribution of the beneficial mutations\nand correlations amongst the fitnesses. Assuming that the relative fitness\ndifference between successive steps is small, we analytically calculate the\naverage walk length for both uncorrelated and correlated fitnesses in all\nextreme value domains for a given initial fitness. We present numerical results\nfor the model where the fitness differences can be large, and find that the\nwalk length behavior differs from that in the former model in the Fr\\'echet\ndomain of extreme value theory. We also discuss the relevance of our results to\nmicrobial experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a natural dynamical analogue of crystalline\norder, which we call choreographic order. In an ordinary (static) crystal, a\nhigh degree of symmetry may be achieved through a careful arrangement of the\nfundamental repeated elements. In the dynamical analogue, a high degree of\nsymmetry may be achieved by having the fundamental elements perform a carefully\nchoreographed dance. For starters, we show how to construct and classify all\nsymmetric satellite constellations. Then we explain how to generalize these\nideas to construct and classify choreographic crystals more broadly. We\nintroduce a quantity, called the \"choreography\" of a given configuration. We\ndiscuss the possibility that some (naturally occurring or artificial) many-body\nor condensed-matter systems may exhibit choreographic order, and suggest\nnatural experimental signatures that could be used to identify and characterize\nsuch systems.\n", "  We obtain exact formulas for moments and generating functions of the height\nfunction of the asymmetric simple exclusion process at one spatial point,\nstarting from special initial data in which every positive even site is\ninitially occupied. These complement earlier formulas of E. Lee [J. Stat. Phys.\n140 (2010) 635-647] but, unlike those formulas, ours are suitable in principle\nfor asymptotics. We also explain how our formulas are related to divergent\nseries formulas for half-flat KPZ of Le Doussal and Calabrese [J. Stat. Mech.\n2012 (2012) P06001], which we also recover using the methods of this paper.\nThese generating functions are given as a series without any apparent Fredholm\ndeterminant or Pfaffian structure. In the long time limit, formal asymptotics\nshow that the fluctuations are given by the Airy$_{2\\to1}$ marginals.\n", "  We have searched for periodicities in our VRIJHK photometry of PKS 2155-304,\nwhich covers the years 2005-2012. A peak of the Fourier spectrum with high\nsignificance is found at T$\\sim$315 days, confirming the recent findings by\n\\cite{Zhang2014}. The examination of the gamma-ray light curves from\nthe\\textit{ Fermi} archives yields a significant signal at $\\sim$ 2T, which,\nwhile nominally significant, involves data spanning only $\\sim$ 6T. Assuming a\nblack hole mass of $10^{9}\\ M_{\\odot}$ the Keplerian distance corresponding to\nthe quasi-period T is $\\sim10^{16}$ cm, about 50 Schwarzschild radii.\n", "  Charge ordering is one of the most intriguing and extensively studied\nphenomena in correlated electronic materials because of its strong impact on\nelectron transport properties including superconductivity. Despite its\nubiquitousness in correlated systems, the occurrence of charge ordering in\niron-based superconductors is still unresolved. Here we use scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy to reveal a long-range charge-stripe order and a highly anisotropic\ndispersion of electronic states in the ground state of stoichiometric FeTe, the\nparent compound of the Fe(Te, Se, S) superconductor family. The formation of\ncharge order in a strongly correlated electron system with integer nominal\nvalence (here Fe$^{2+}$) is unexpected and suggests that the iron-based\nsuperconductors may exhibit more complex charge dynamics than originally\nexpected. We show that the present observations can be attributed to the\nsurpassing of the role of local Coulomb interaction by the poorly screened\nlonger-range Coulomb interactions, facilitated by large Hund's rule coupling.\n", "  At highest energy edges Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray, (UHECR) and PeVs\nneutrino (UHE neutrino), should soon offer new exciting astronomy. The fast and\nsomehow contradictory growth of hundred of antagonist models shows the\nexplosive vitality of those new astronomy frontiers. No conclusive\nunderstanding on the UHECR and UHE neutrino source are at hand. The earliest\nexpectation of GRBs (as a one shoot Fireball model) as the main (UHE neutrino)\nsources has been rejected. The source of UHECR as the expected GZK ones within\nour Super-Galactic Plane (within few tens Mpc) it has been quite disproved.\nHowever alternative models on GRB (as the long life precessing Jets) and the\nnew updated records by AUGER, TA, ICECUBE are offering nevertheless partial\nunderstanding and early hint for point source correlations along our galaxy and\ntoward Cen A, the nearest extragalactic AGN.\n", "  We consider a real periodic Schr\\\"odinger operator and a physically relevant\nfamily of $m \\geq 1$ Bloch bands, separated by a gap from the rest of the\nspectrum, and we investigate the localization properties of the corresponding\ncomposite Wannier functions. To this aim, we show that in dimension $d \\leq 3$\nthere exists a global frame consisting of smooth quasi-Bloch functions which\nare both periodic and time-reversal symmetric. Aiming to applications in\ncomputational physics, we provide a constructive algorithm to obtain such a\nBloch frame. The construction yields the existence of a basis of composite\nWannier functions which are real-valued and almost-exponentially localized.\n  The proof of the main result exploits only the fundamental symmetries of the\nprojector on the relevant bands, allowing applications, beyond the model\nspecified above, to a broad range of gapped periodic quantum systems with a\ntime-reversal symmetry of bosonic type.\n", "  The mixed-chalcogenide compound TlBiSSe realizes a three-dimensional (3D)\nDirac semimetal state. In clean, low-carrier-density single crystals of this\nmaterial, we found Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations to signify its 3D Dirac\nnature. Moreover, we observed very large linear magnetoresistance (MR)\napproaching 10,000% in 14 T at 1.8 K, which diminishes rapidly above 30 K. Our\nanalysis of the magnetotransport data points to the possibility that the linear\nMR is fundamentally governed by the Hall field; although such a situation has\nbeen predicted for highly-inhomogeneous systems, inhomogeneity does not seem to\nplay an important role in TlBiSSe. Hence, the mechanism of large linear MR is\nan intriguing open question in a clean 3D Dirac system.\n", "  The crucial feature of a memoryless stochastic process is that any\ninformation about its state can only decrease as the system evolves. Here we\nshow that such a decrease of information is equivalent to the underlying\nstochastic evolution being divisible. The main result, which holds for both\nclassical and quantum stochastic processes, rely on a quantum version of the\nso-called Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem in classical statistics.\n", "  We present results on the radiative lifetimes of excitons and trions in a\nmonolayer of metal dichalcogenide MoS2. The small exciton radius and the large\nexciton optical oscillator strength result in radiative lifetimes in the\n0.18-0.30 ps range for excitons that have small in-plane momenta and couple to\nradiation. Average lifetimes of thermally distributed excitons depend linearly\non the exciton temperature and can be in the few picoseconds range at small\ntemperatures and more than a nanosecond near room temperature. Localized\nexcitons exhibit lifetimes in the same range and the lifetime increases as the\nlocalization length decreases. The radiative lifetimes of trions are in the\nhundreds of picosecond range and increase with the increase in the trion\nmomentum. Average lifetimes of thermally distributed trions increase with the\ntrion temperature as the trions acquire thermal energy and larger momenta. We\nexpect our theoretical results to be applicable to most other 2D transition\nmetal dichalcogenides.\n", "  With ready access to massive computer clusters we may now study light\npropagation in a dense cold atomic gas by means of basically exact numerical\nsimulations. We report on a direct comparison between traditional optics, that\nis, electrodynamics of a polarizable medium, and numerical simulations in an\nelementary problem of light propagating through a slab of matter. The standard\noptics fails already at quite low atom densities, and the failure becomes\ndramatic when the average interatomic separation is reduced to around $k^{-1}$,\nwhere $k$ is the wave number of resonant light. The difference between the two\nsolutions originates from correlations between the atoms induced by\nlight-mediated dipole-dipole interactions.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamical properties of quantum fields in curved\nspacetime. Our approach is to consider quantum fields in curved spacetime as a\nquantum system undergoing an out-of-equilibrium transformation. The\nnon-equilibrium features are studied by using a formalism which has been\ndeveloped to derive fluctuation relations and emergent irreversible features\nbeyond the linear response regime. We apply these ideas to an expanding\nuniverse scenario, therefore avoiding assumptions on the relation between\nentropy and quantum matter. We provide a fluctuation theorem which allows us to\nunderstand particle production due to the expansion of the universe as an\nentropic increase. Our results pave the way towards a different understanding\nof the thermodynamics of relativistic and quantum systems in our universe.\n", "  The first direct observation of time-reversal (T) violation in the $B\\bar{B}$\nsystem has been reported by the BaBar collaboration, employing the method of\nBa$\\tilde {\\rm n}\\!$uls and Bernab\\'eu. Given this, we generalize their\nanalysis of the time-dependent T-violating asymmetry ($A_{T}$) to consider\ndifferent choices of CP tags for which the dominant amplitudes have the same\nweak phase. As one application, we find that it is possible to measure\ndepartures from the universality of $\\sin(2\\beta)$ directly. If $\\sin(2\\beta)$\nis universal, as in the Standard Model, the method permits the direct\ndetermination of penguin effects in these channels. Our method, although no\nlonger a strict test of T, can yield tests of the $\\sin(2\\beta)$ universality,\nor, alternatively, of penguin effects, of much improved precision even with\nexisting data sets.\n", "  Citations measure the importance of a publication, and may serve as a proxy\nfor its popularity and quality of its contents. Here we study the distributions\nof citations to publications from individual academic institutions for a single\nyear. The average number of citations have large variations between different\ninstitutions across the world, but the probability distributions of citations\nfor individual institutions can be rescaled to a common form by scaling the\ncitations by the average number of citations for that institution. We find this\nfeature seem to be universal for a broad selection of institutions irrespective\nof the average number of citations per article. A similar analysis for\ncitations to publications in a particular journal in a single year reveals\nsimilar results. We find high absolute inequality for both these sets, Gini\ncoefficients being around $0.66$ and $0.58$ for institutions and journals\nrespectively. We also find that the top $25$% of the articles hold about $75$%\nof the total citations for institutions and the top $29$% of the articles hold\nabout $71$% of the total citations for journals.\n", "  We study energy and particle transport for one-dimensional strongly\ninteracting bosons through a single channel connecting two atomic reservoirs.\nWe show the emergence of particle- and energy- current separation, leading to\nthe violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. As a consequence, we predict\ndifferent time scales for the equilibration of temperature and particle\nimbalances between the reservoirs. Going beyond the linear spectrum\napproximation, we show the emergence of ther- moelectric effects, which could\nbe controlled by either tuning interactions or the temperature. Our results\ndescribe in a unified picture fermions in condensed matter devices and bosons\nin ultracold atom setups. We conclude discussing the effects of a controllable\ndisorder.\n", "  The primary goal of entanglement theory is to determine convertibility\nconditions for two quantum states. Up until now, this has always been done with\nthe use of entanglement monotones. With the exception of the negativity, such\nquantities tend to be rather uncomputable. We instead promote the idea of\nconversion witnesses in this paper. A conversion witness is a function on pairs\nof states and whose value determines whether a state can be converted into\nanother. We construct a conversion witness that can be efficiently computed for\narbitrary states in systems of any size. This conversion witness is always\nbetter than the negativity at detecting when two entangled states are not\ninterconvertible. Furthermore, when considering states of two-qubit systems,\nthis new conversion witness is sometimes better than the entanglement of\nformation. This shows that the study of conversion witness is in fact useful,\nand may have applications in resource theories beyond that of entanglement.\n", "  It has been shown recently that the mathematical status of the operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) is better than was expected before: namely considering\nmassive Euclidean $\\varphi^4$-theory in the perturbative loop expansion, the\nOPE converges at any loop order when considering (as is usually done) composite\noperator insertions into correlation functions. In the present paper we prove\nthe same result for the massless theory. While the short-distance properties of\nmassive and massless theories may be expected to be similar on physical\ngrounds, the proof in the massless case requires entirely new techniques. In\nour inductive construction we have to control with sufficient precision the\nexceptional momentum singularities of the massless correlation functions. In\nfact the bounds we state are expressed in terms of weight factors associated to\ncertain tree graphs. Our proof is again based on the flow equations of the\nrenormalisation group.\n", "  In this paper we review all the up-to-date Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays\n(UHECR) events reported by AUGER, by Telescope Array (TA) and by AGASA in\ncommon coordinate maps. We also confirm our earliest (2008-2013) model, where\nUHECR are mostly made by light nuclei (namely He, Be, B), which explains the\nVirgo absence and confirms M82 as the main source for North TA Hot Spot. Many\nmore sources, such as NGC253 and several galactic ones, are possible candidates\nfor most of the 376 UHECR events. Several correlated map, already considered in\nrecent years, are then reported to show all the events, with their statistical\ncorrelation values.\n", "  Processes of one- and two-pion production in $NN$ collisions are considered\nin connection with excitation of intermediate dibaryon resonances. In\nparticular, relative contributions of the conventional meson-exchange and\ndibaryon excitation mechanisms in the reaction $pp \\to d \\pi^+$ are\ninvestigated in detail. Inclusion of the intermediate isovector dibaryon\nresonances is shown to essentially improve the description of experimental data\nfor this reaction, provided the soft meson-baryon form factors consistent with\n$\\pi N$ elastic scattering are used. Manifestation of the intermediate\nisoscalar and isovector dibaryons in the two-pion production processes is also\nstudied. The role of the isovector dibaryon resonances in the reaction $pp \\to\npp \\pi\\pi$ is discussed for the first time. An explanation of the observed\nstrong differences between two-pion production cross sections in $pn$ and $pp$\ncollisions based in part on the analysis of dibaryon structure is suggested.\n", "  In $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, structure formation is halted shortly after dark\nenergy dominates the mass/energy budget of the Universe. A manifestation of\nthis effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius has an upper\nbound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the\nform of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.\nBefore designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of\nmasses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to\nanswer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are\npredicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible\nviolation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale\nto target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter\nformalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped\nforming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very\nclose to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{13} M_\\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a\nstatistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates\nturnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures\nare no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,\nthey asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and\nthey are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with\nstructures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.\nWe call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the\noptimal for the purpose outlined above. As a corollary result, we explain the\ndifferent accretion behavior of small and larger structures observed in already\nconducted numerical simulations.\n", "  It is generally believed that, in the thermodynamic limit, the microcanonical\ndescription as a function of energy coincides with the canonical description as\na function of temperature. However, various examples of systems for which the\nmicrocanonical and canonical ensembles are not equivalent have been identified.\nA complete theory of this intriguing phenomenon is still missing. Here we show\nthat ensemble nonequivalence can manifest itself also in random graphs with\ntopological constraints. We find that, while graphs with a given number of\nlinks are ensemble-equivalent, graphs with a given degree sequence are not.\nThis result holds irrespective of whether the energy is nonadditive (as in\nunipartite graphs) or additive (as in bipartite graphs). In contrast with\nprevious expectations, our results show that: (1) physically, nonequivalence\ncan be induced by an extensive number of local constraints, and not necessarily\nby long-range interactions or nonadditivity; (2) mathematically, nonquivalence\nis determined by a different large-deviation behaviour of microcanonical and\ncanonical probabilities for a single microstate, and not necessarily for almost\nall microstates. The latter criterion, which is entirely local, is not\nrestricted to networks and holds in general.\n", "  Minimal observational evidence exists for fast transition region (TR) upflows\nin the presence of cool loops. Observations of such occurrences challenge\nnotions of standard solar atmospheric heating models, as well as their\ndescription of bright TR emission. Using the {\\it EUV Imaging Spectrometer}\n(EIS) onboard {\\it Hinode}, we observe fast upflows ($v_\\lambda$\\,$\\le$\\,$-$10\nkm s$^{-1}$) over multiple TR temperatures (5.8\\,$\\le$\\,$\\log T$\\,$\\le$ 6.0) at\nthe footpoint sites of a cool loop ($\\log T$\\,$\\le$\\,6.0). Prior to cool loop\nenergizing, asymmetric flows of $+$\\,5 km s$^{-1}$ and $-$\\,60 km s$^{-1}$ are\nobserved at footpoint sites. These flows speeds and patterns occur\nsimultaneously with both magnetic flux cancellation (at site of upflows only)\nderived from the {\\it Solar Dynamics Observatory}'s (SDOs) { \\it Helioseismic\nMagnetic Imager}'s (HMI) line-of-sight magnetogram images, and a 30\\% mass\nin-flux at coronal heights. The incurred non-equilibrium structure of the cool\nloop leads to a catastrophic cooling event, with subsequent plasma evaporation\nindicating the TR as the heating site. From the magnetic flux evolution we\nconclude that magnetic reconnection between the footpoint and background field\nare responsible for observed fast TR plasma upflows.\n", "  We compute the black hole horizon entanglement entropy for a massless scalar\nfield in the brick wall model by incorporating the minimal length. Taking the\nminimal length effects on the occupation number $n(\\omega,l)$ and the Hawking\ntemperature into consideration, we obtain the leading UV divergent term and the\nsubleading logarithmic term in the entropy. The leading divergent term scales\nwith the horizon area. The subleading logarithmic term is the same as that in\nthe usual brick wall model without the minimal length.\n", "  We report a multiwavelength (X-ray, ultraviolet/optical/infrared, radio)\nanalysis of the relativistic tidal disruption event candidate Sw J2058+05 from\n3 months to 3 yr post-discovery in order to study its properties and compare\nits behavior with that of Sw J1644+57. Our main results are as follows. (1) The\nlong-term X-ray light curve of Sw J2058+05 shows a remarkably similar trend to\nthat of Sw J1644+57. After a prolonged power-law decay, the X-ray flux drops\noff rapidly by a factor of $\\gtrsim 160$ within a span of $\\Delta$$t$/$t$ $\\le$\n0.95. Associating this sudden decline with the transition from super-Eddington\nto sub-Eddington accretion, we estimate the black hole mass to be in the range\nof $10^{4-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$. (2) We detect rapid ($\\lesssim 500$ s) X-ray\nvariability before the dropoff, suggesting that, even at late times, the X-rays\noriginate from close to the black hole (ruling out a forward-shock origin). (3)\nWe confirm using HST and VLBA astrometry that the location of the source\ncoincides with the galaxy's center to within $\\lesssim 400$ pc (in projection).\n(4) We modeled Sw J2058+05's ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectral energy\ndistribution with a single-temperature blackbody and find that while the radius\nremains more or less constant at a value of $63.4 \\pm 4.5$ AU ($\\sim 10^{15}$\ncm) at all times during the outburst, the blackbody temperature drops\nsignificantly from $\\sim$ 30,000 K at early times to a value of $\\sim$ 15,000 K\nat late times (before the X-ray dropoff). Our results strengthen Sw J2058+05's\ninterpretation as a tidal disruption event similar to Sw J1644+57.\n", "  The magnetic and transport properties of the metal phthalocyanine (MPc) and\nF$_{16}$MPc (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Ag) families of\nmolecules in contact with S-Au wires are investigated by density functional\ntheory within the local density approximation, including local electronic\ncorrelations on the central metal atom. The magnetic moments are found to be\nconsiderably modified under fluorination. In addition, they do not depend\nexclusively on the configuration of the outer electronic shell of the central\nmetal atom (as in isolated MPc and F$_{16}$MPc) but also on the interaction\nwith the leads. Good agreement between the calculated conductance and\nexperimental results is obtained. For M = Ag, a high spin filter efficiency and\nconductance is observed, giving rise to a potentially high sensitivity for\nchemical sensor applications.\n", "  This paper examines the behaviour of closed `lattice universes' wherein\nmasses are distributed in a regular lattice on the Cauchy surfaces of closed\nvacuum universes. Such universes are approximated using a form of Regge\ncalculus originally developed by Collins and Williams to model closed FLRW\nuniverses. We consider two types of lattice universes, one where all masses are\nidentical to each other and another where one mass gets perturbed in magnitude.\nIn the unperturbed universe, we consider the possible arrangements of the\nmasses in the Regge Cauchy surfaces and demonstrate that the model will only be\nstable if each mass lies within some spherical region of convergence. We also\nbriefly discuss the existence of Regge models that are dual to the ones we have\nconsidered. We then model a perturbed lattice universe and demonstrate that the\nmodel's evolution is well-behaved, with the expansion increasing in magnitude\nas the perturbation is increased.\n", "  We have investigated how the dynamics of a quantum particle initially\nlocalized in the left boundary site under periodic driving can be manipulated\nvia control of the right boundary site of a lattice array. Because of the\nadjustable coupling between the right boundary site and its nearest-neighbor,\nwe can realize either coherent destruction of tunneling to coherent tunneling\n(CDT-CT) transition or coherent tunneling to coherent destruction of tunneling\n(CT-CDT) transition, by driving or moving the right boundary site while keeping\nthe left boundary site driven by a periodically oscillating field with a fixed\ndriving parameter. In particular, the transition direction shows odd-even\nsensitivity to the number of lattice sites. We have also revealed that our\nproposed CDT-CT transition is robust against the second order coupling (SOC)\nbetween next-nearest-neighbor sites in odd-$N$-site systems, whereas\nlocalization can be significantly enhanced by SOC in even-$N$-site systems.\nMore interestingly, it is found destruction and revival of CDT observable in\nnon-high-frequency regimes. Our results can be readily verified within the\ncapacity of current experiments.\n", "  Understanding the structural tendencies of nanoconfined water is of great\ninterest for nanoscience and biology, where nano/micro-sized objects may be\nseparated by very few layers of water. Here we investigate the properties of\nice confined to a quasi-2D monolayer by a featureless, chemically neutral\npotential, in order to characterize its intrinsic behaviour. We use\ndensity-functional theory simulations with a non-local van der Waals density\nfunctional. An ab initio random structure search reveals all the energetically\ncompetitive monolayer configurations to belong to only two of the\npreviously-identified families, characterized by a square or honeycomb\nhydrogen-bonding network, respectively. We discuss the modified ice rules\nneeded for each network, and propose a simple point dipole 2D lattice model\nthat successfully explains the energetics of the square configurations. All\nidentified stable phases for both networks are found to be non-polar (but with\na topologically non-trivial texture for the square) and, hence,\nnon-ferroelectric, in contrast to previous predictions from a five-site\nempirical force-field model. Our results are in good agreement with very\nrecently reported experimental observations.\n", "  We propose a statistical tool to compare the scaling behaviour of turbulence\nin pairs of molecular cloud maps. Using artificial maps with well defined\nspatial properties, we calibrate the method and test its limitations to\nultimately apply it to a set of observed maps. We develop the wavelet-based\nweighted cross-correlation (WWCC) method to study the relative contribution of\nstructures of different sizes and their degree of correlation in two maps as a\nfunction of spatial scale, and the mutual displacement of structures in the\nmolecular cloud maps. We test the WWCC for circular structures having a single\nprominent scale and fractal structures showing a self-similar behavior without\nprominent scales. Observational noise and a finite map size limit the scales\nwhere the cross-correlation coefficients and displacement vectors can be\nreliably measured. For fractal maps containing many structures on all scales,\nthe limitation from the observational noise is negligible for signal-to-noise\nratios >5. (abbrev). Application of the WWCC to the observed line maps of the\ngiant molecular cloud G333 allows to add specific scale information to the\nresults obtained earlier using the principle component analysis. It confirms\nthe chemical and excitation similarity of $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O on all\nscales, but shows a deviation of HCN at scales of up to 7' (~7 pc). This can be\ninterpreted as a chemical transition scale. The largest structures also show a\nsystematic offset along the filament, probably due to a large-scale density\ngradient. The WWCC can compare correlated structures in different maps of\nmolecular clouds identifying scales that represent structural changes such as\nchemical and phase transitions and prominent or enhanced dimensions.\n", "  Using Spitzer observations of classical Cepheids we have measured the true\naverage distance modulus of the SMC to be $18.96 \\pm 0.01_{stat} \\pm\n0.03_{sys}$ mag (corresponding to $62 \\pm 0.3$ kpc), which is $0.48 \\pm 0.01$\nmag more distant than the LMC. This is in agreement with previous results from\nCepheid observations, as well as with measurements from other indicators such\nas RR Lyrae stars and the tip of the red giant branch.\n  Utilizing the properties of the mid--infrared Leavitt Law we measured precise\ndistances to individual Cepheids in the SMC, and have confirmed that the galaxy\nis tilted and elongated such that its eastern side is up to 20 kpc closer than\nits western side. This is in agreement with the results from red clump stars\nand dynamical simulations of the Magellanic Clouds and Stream.\n", "  Rocky planets are thought to comprise compounds of Mg and O as these are\namong the most abundant elements, but knowledge of their stable phases may be\nincomplete. MgO is known to be remarkably stable to very high pressure and\nchemically inert under reduced condition of the Earth's lower mantle. However,\nin 'icy' gas giants as well as in exoplanets oxygen may be a more abundant\nconstituent (Ref. 1,2). Here, using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in\nlaser-heated diamond anvil cells, we show that MgO and oxygen react at\npressures above 94 GPa and T = 2150 K with the formation of the theoretically\npredicted I4/mcm MgO2 (Ref.3). Raman spectroscopy detects the presence of a\nperoxide ion (O22-) in the synthesized material as well as in the recovered\nspecimen. Likewise, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy confirms that the\nrecovered sample has higher oxygen content than pure MgO. Our finding suggests\nthat MgO2 may substitute MgO in rocky mantles and rocky planetary cores under\nhighly oxidizing conditions.\n", "  Kilonovae represent an important electromagnetic counterpart for compact\nbinary mergers, which could become the most commonly detected gravitational\nwave (GW) source. Follow-up observations, triggered by GW events, of kilonovae\nare nevertheless difficult due to poor localization by GW detectors and due to\ntheir faint near-infrared peak emission that has limited observational\ncapability. We show that the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) will be able to detect kilonovae within the relevant\nGW-detection range of $\\sim$ 200 Mpc in short ($\\lesssim$ 12-second) exposure\ntimes for a week following the merger. Despite this sensitivity, a kilonova\nsearch fully covering a fiducial localized area of $10$ $\\mbox{deg}^2$ will not\nbe viable with NIRCam due to its limited field of view. However, targeted\nsurveys may be developed to optimize the likelihood of discovering kilonovae\nefficiently within limited observing time. We estimate that a survey of $10$\n$\\mbox{deg}^2$ focused on galaxies within 200 Mpc would require about 13 hours,\ndominated by overhead times; a survey further focused on galaxies exhibiting\nhigh star-formation rates would require $\\sim$ 5 hours. The characteristic time\nmay be reduced to as little as $\\sim$4 hours, without compromising the\nlikelihood of detecting kilonovae, by surveying sky areas associated with 50%,\nrather than 90%, confidence regions of 3 GW events, rather than a single event.\nOn detection and identification of a kilonova, a limited number of NIRCam\nfollow-up observations could constrain the properties of matter ejected by the\nbinary and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter.\n", "  We critically discuss the recent observations of the binary system at the\ncenter of the bipolar planetary nebula Henize 2-428. We find that the proposed\nexplanation of two equal-mass degenerate objects with a total mass larger than\nthe Chandrasekhar limiting mass that supposedly will merge in less than a\nHubble time, possibly leading to a SN~Ia, is controversial. This hypothesis\nrelies on the assumption that the variability of the He II 5412A spectral line\nis due to two absorption components. Instead, we propose that it can be\naccounted for by a broad absorption line from the central system on top of\nwhich there is a narrow emission line from the nebula. This prompted us to\nstudy if the binary system can be made of a degenerate star and a low-mass main\nsequence companion, or of two degenerate objects of smaller mass. We find that\nalthough both scenarios can account for the existence of two symmetric broad\nminima in the light curve, the second one agrees better with observations. We\nthus argue that the claim that Henize 2-428 provides observational evidence\nsupporting the double-degenerate scenario for SN~Ia is premature.\n", "  In this paper we study the so-called spin-boson system, namely {a two-level\nsystem} in interaction with a distinguished mode of a quantized bosonic field.\nWe give a brief description of the controlled Rabi and Jaynes--Cummings models\nand we discuss their appearance in the mathematics and physics literature. We\nthen study the controllability of the Rabi model when the control is an\nexternal field acting on the bosonic part. Applying geometric control\ntechniques to the Galerkin approximation and using perturbation theory to\nguarantee non-resonance of the spectrum of the drift operator, we prove\napproximate controllability of the system, for almost every value of the\ninteraction parameter.\n", "  We fabricate a free-standing molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) saturable absorber\nby embedding liquid-phase exfoliated few-layer MoSe2 flakes into a polymer\nfilm. The MoSe2-polymer composite is used to Q-switch fiber lasers based on\nytterbium (Yb), erbium (Er) and thulium (Tm) gain fiber, producing trains of\nmicrosecond-duration pulses with kilohertz repetition rates at 1060 nm, 1566 nm\nand 1924 nm, respectively. Such operating wavelengths correspond to sub-bandgap\nsaturable absorption in MoSe2, which is explained in the context of\nedge-states, building upon studies of other semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD)-based saturable absorbers. Our work adds few-layer MoSe2\nto the growing catalog of TMDs with remarkable optical properties, which offer\nnew opportunities for photonic devices.\n", "  Double stage diamond anvil cells (DAC) of two designs have been assembled and\ntested. We used a standard symmetric DAC as a primary stage and CVD microanvils\nmachined by a focused ion beam - as a second. We evaluated pressure, stress,\nand strain distributions in Au and Fe-Au samples as well as in secondary anvils\nusing synchrotron x-ray diffraction with a micro-focused beam. A maximum\npressure of 240 GPa was reached independent of the first stage anvil culet\nsize. We found that the stress field generated by the second stage anvils is\ntypical of conventional DAC experiments. The maximum pressures reached are\nlimited by strains developing in the secondary anvil and by cupping of the\nfirst stage diamond anvil in the presented experimental designs. Also, our\nexperiments show that pressures of several megabars may be reached without\nsacrificing the first stage diamond anvils.\n", "  A Comment on the Letter by P. Jimenez-Delgado, T.J. Hobbs, J.T. Londergan,\nand W. Melnitchouk, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 082002 (2015).\n", "  ZnSnN2 is an Earth-abundant analog to the III-Nitrides with potential as a\nsolar absorber due to its direct bandgap, steep absorption onset, and\ndisorder-driven bandgap tunability. Despite these desirable properties,\ndiscrepancies in the fundamental bandgap and degenerate \\emph{n}-type carrier\ndensity have been prevalent issues in the limited amount of literature\navailable on this material. Using a combinatorial RF co-sputtering approach, we\nhave been able to explore a growth-temperature-composition space for\nZn(1+x)Sn(1-x)N(2) over the ranges 35-340 degrees C and 0.30-0.75 Zn/(Zn+Sn).\nIn this way, we were able to identify an optimal set of deposition parameters\nfor obtaining as-deposited films with wurtzite crystal structure and carrier\ndensity as low as 1.8 x 10^(18) cm^(-3). Films grown at 230 degrees C with\nZn/(Zn+Sn) = 0.60 were found to have the largest grain size overall (70 nm\ndiameter on average) while also exhibiting low carrier density (3 x 10^(18)\ncm^(-3)) and high mobility (8.3 cm^(2) V^(-1) s^(-1)). Furthermore, we report\nevidence of a Burstein-Moss shift widening the apparent bandgap as cation\ncomposition becomes increasingly Sn-rich, and tunable carrier density as a\nfunction of cation composition (lower carrier density for higher Zn content),\nwhich suggests the formation of defect complexes. Collectively, these findings\nprovide important insight into the fundamental properties of the Zn-Sn-N\nmaterial system, and also highlight the potential to utilize ZnSnN2 for\nphotovoltaics.\n", "  We incorporate the effective restoration of $U(1)_{\\rm A}$ symmetry in the\n2+1 flavor entanglement Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (EPNJL)\nmodel by introducing a temperature-dependent strength $K(T)$ to the\nKobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) determinant interaction. $T$ dependence of\n$K(T)$ is well determined from pion and $a_0$-meson screening masses obtained\nby lattice QCD (LQCD) simulations with improved p4 staggered fermions. The\nstrength is strongly suppressed in the vicinity of the pseudocritical\ntemperature of chiral transition. The EPNJL model with the $K(T)$ well\nreproduces meson susceptibilities calculated by LQCD with domain-wall fermions.\nThe model shows that the chiral transition is second order at the \"light-quark\nchiral-limit\" point where the light quark mass is zero and the strange quark\nmass is fixed at the physical value. This indicates that there exists a\ntricritical point. Hence the location is estimated.\n", "  On lattice gauge field configurations with 2+1 dynamical quark flavors, we\ninvestigate the momentum space quark and gluon propagators in the combined\nmaximally Abelian plus $U(1)_3\\times U(1)_8$ Landau gauge. We extract the gluon\nfields from the lattice link variables and study the diagonal and off-diagonal\ngluon propagators. We find that the infrared region of the transverse diagonal\ngluon propagator is strongly enhanced compared to the off-diagonal propagator.\nThe Dirac operator from the Asqtad action is inverted on the diagonal and\noff-diagonal gluon backgrounds separately. In agreement with the hypothesis of\ninfrared Abelian dominance, we find that the off-diagonal gluon background\nhardly gives rise to any non-trivial quark dynamics while the quark propagator\nfrom the diagonal gluon background closely resembles its Landau gauge\ncounterpart.\n", "  We study the properties of the eigenvalues of real random matrices and their\nproducts. It is known that when the matrix elements are Gaussian-distributed\nindependent random variables, the fraction of real eigenvalues tends to unity\nas the number of matrices in the product increases. Here we present numerical\nevidence that this phenomenon is robust with respect to the probability\ndistribution of matrix elements, and is therefore a general property that\nmerits detailed investigation. Since the elements of the product matrix are no\nlonger distributed as those of the single matrix nor they remain independent\nrandom variables, we study the role of these two factors in detail. We study\nnumerically the properties of the Hadamard (or Schur) product of matrices and\nalso the product of matrices whose entries are independent but have the same\nmarginal distribution as that of normal products of matrices, and find that\nunder repeated multiplication, the probability of all eigenvalues to be real\nincreases in both cases, but saturates to a constant below unity showing that\nthe correlations amongst the matrix elements are responsible for the approach\nto one. To investigate the role of the non-normal nature of the probability\ndistributions, we present a thorough analytical treatment of the $2 \\times 2$\nsingle matrix for several standard distributions. Within the class of smooth\ndistributions with zero mean and finite variance, our results indicate that the\nGaussian distribution has the maximum probability of real eigenvalues, but the\nCauchy distribution characterised by infinite variance is found to have a\nlarger probability of real eigenvalues than the normal. We also find that for\nthe two-dimensional single matrices, the probability of real eigenvalues lies\nin the range [5/8,7/8].\n", "  With improved gate calibrations reducing unitary errors, we achieve a\nbenchmarked single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.95% with superconducting qubits in\na circuit quantum electrodynamics system. We present a method for\ndistinguishing between unitary and non-unitary errors in quantum gates by\ninterleaving repetitions of a target gate within a randomized benchmarking\nsequence. The benchmarking fidelity decays quadratically with the number of\ninterleaved gates for unitary errors but linearly for non-unitary, allowing us\nto separate systematic coherent errors from decoherent effects. With this\nprotocol we show that the fidelity of the gates is not limited by unitary\nerrors, but by another drive-activated source of decoherence such as amplitude\nfluctuations.\n", "  All the $n(2n+3)$ mean and covariance parameters of an $n$-mode Gaussian\nstates are expressed in terms of the expectation values of the same number of\nconjugates of the total number observable. This permits a complete tomography\nof the state. The same is applied to outputs of a Gaussian channel\ncorresponding to selected coherent states to perform the complete tomography of\nthe channel. This leads to some interesting problems concerning the\ndistribution of the number operator and also tomographic complexity.\n", "  We have investigated the evaporation of close-in exoplanets irradiated by\nionizing photons. We find that the properties of the flow are controlled by the\nratio of the recombination time to the flow time-scale. When the recombination\ntime-scale is short compared to the flow time-scale the the flow is in\napproximate local ionization equilibrium with a thin ionization front, where\nthe photon mean free path is short compared to flow scale. In this\n\"recombination limited\" flow the mass-loss scales roughly with the square root\nof the incident flux. When the recombination time is long compared to the flow\ntime-scale the ionization front becomes thick and encompasses the entire flow,\nwith the mass-loss rate scaling linearly with flux. If the planet's potential\nis deep the flow is approximately \"energy-limited\"; however, if the planet's\npotential is shallow we identify a new limiting mass-loss regime, which we term\n\"photon-limited\". In this scenario the mass-loss rate is purely limited by the\nincoming flux of ionizing photons. We have developed a new numerical approach\nthat takes into account the frequency dependence of the incoming ionizing\nspectrum and performed a large suite of 1D simulations to characterise UV\ndriven mass-loss around low mass planets. We find the flow is\n\"recombination-limited\" at high fluxes but becomes \"energy-limited\" at low\nfluxes; however, the transition is broad occurring over several order of\nmagnitude in flux. Finally, we point out the transitions between the different\nflow types does not occur at a single flux value, but depends on the planet's\nproperties, with higher mass planets becoming \"energy-limited\" at lower fluxes.\n", "  Questions surround the connection of luminous extragalactic masers to\ngalactic processes. The observation that water and hydroxyl megamasers rarely\ncoexist in the same galaxy has given rise to a hypothesis that the two species\nappear in different phases of nuclear activity. The detection of simultaneous\nhydroxyl and water megamaser emission toward IC694 has called this hypothesis\ninto question but, because many megamasers have not been surveyed for emission\nin the other molecule, it remains unclear whether IC694 occupies a narrow phase\nof galaxy evolution or whether the relationship between megamaser species and\ngalactic processes is more complicated than previously believed. In this paper,\nwe present results of a systematic search for 22 GHz water maser emission among\nOH megamaser hosts to identify additional objects hosting both megamaser. Our\nwork roughly doubles the number of galaxies searched for emission in both\nmolecules which host at least one confirmed maser. We confirm with high degree\nof confidence ($> 8 \\sigma$) the detection of water emission toward IIZw96,\nfirmly establishing it as the second object to co-host both water and hydroxyl\nmegamasers after IC694. We find high luminosity, narrow features in the water\nfeature in IIZw96. All dual megamaser candidates appear in merging galaxy\nsystems suggestive that megamaser coexistance may signal a brief phase along\nthe merger sequence. A statistical analysis of the results of our observations\nprovide possible evidence for an exclusion of H$_2$O kilomasers among OH\nmegamaser hosts.\n", "  We propose and study a new class of superconducting detectors which are\nsensitive to O(meV) electron recoils from dark matter-electron scattering. Such\ndevices could detect dark matter as light as the warm dark matter limit, mX >\nkeV. We compute the rate of dark matter scattering off of free electrons in a\n(superconducting) metal, including the relevant Pauli blocking factors. We\ndemonstrate that classes of dark matter consistent with terrestrial and\ncosmological/astrophysical constraints could be detected by such detectors with\na moderate size exposure.\n", "  Direct production of electron--positron pairs in two photon collisions, the\nBreit--Wheeler process, is one of the basic processes in the Universe. However,\nit has never been observed in laboratory because of absence of the intense\ngamma-ray sources. Laser induced synchrotron sources emission may open for the\nfirst time a way to observe this process. A feasibility of an experimental\nset--up using a MeV photon source is studied in this paper. We compare several\n$\\gamma$--ray sources, estimate the expected number of electron--positron pairs\nand competing processes by using numerical simulations including quantum\nelectrodynamic effects.\n", "  We combine measurements of the longitudinal ($\\rho_{xx}$) and Hall\n($\\rho_{xy}$) resistivities of disordered two dimensional amorphous\nindium-oxide films to study the magnetic-field tuned superconductor to\ninsulator transition (H-SIT) in the $T \\to 0$ limit. At the critical field,\n$H_c$, the full resistivity tensor is $T$ independent with $\\rho_{xx}(H_c) =\nh/4e^2$ and $\\rho_{xy}(H_c)=0$ within experimental uncertainty in all films\n(i.e. these appear to be \"universal\" values), this is strongly suggestive that\nthere is a particle-vortex self-duality at $H=H_c$. The transition separates\nthe (presumably) superconducting state at $H<H_c$ from a \"Hall-insulator\" phase\nin which $\\rho_{xx}\\to \\infty$ as $T\\to 0$ while $\\rho_{xy}$ approaches a\nnon-zero value smaller than its \"classical value\" $H/nec$, i.e.\n$0<\\rho_{xy}<H/nec$. A still higher characteristic magnetic field, $H_c^*>\nH_c$, at which the Hall resistance is $T$ independent and roughly equal to its\nclassical value, $\\rho_{xy}\\approx H/nec$, marks an additional crossover to a\nhighfield regime (probably to a Fermi-insulator) in which $\\rho_{xy} > H/nec$\nand possibly diverges as $T\\to 0$. We also highlight a profound analogy between\nthe H-SIT and quantum-Hall liquid to insulator transitions (QHIT).\n", "  We show the absence of the ABJ anomaly for the Horava-Lifshitz-like QED with\nany even $z$. Besides of this, we study the graph contributing to the ABJ\nanomaly at non-zero temperature and extend the Fujikawa's methodology of\nstudying the integral measure for our model.\n", "  We present data for LSQ14bdq, a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (SLSN)\ndiscovered by the La Silla QUEST survey and classified by the Public ESO\nSpectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects. The spectrum and light curve are\nvery similar to slow-declining SLSNe such as PTF12dam. However, detections\nwithin ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,\nlasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. The\nbroader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellar\ninteraction models. We discuss the implications of the precursor peak in the\ncontext of these models. It is too bright and narrow to be explained as a\nnormal 56Ni-powered SN, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle to\nfit the two peaks simultaneously. We propose that the initial peak may arise\nfrom the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by a\ncentral engine drives the second peak. In this picture, we show that an\nexplosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundred\nsolar radii would be required to power the early emission. The competing engine\nmodels involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-back\naccretion onto a central black hole. The prompt energy required may favour the\nblack hole scenario. The bright initial peak effectively rules out a compact\nWolf-Rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected masses\nbecome unphysical.\n", "  We study the fluctuations of the amplitude (i.e. the Higgs-Anderson) mode in\na superconducting system of coupled Dirac particles proposed as a model for\npossible surface or interface superconductivity in rhombohedral graphite. We\nshow that the absence of Fermi energy and vanishing of the excitation gap of\nthe collective amplitude mode in the model leads to a large fluctuation\ncontribution to thermodynamic quantities such as the heat capacity. As a\nconsequence, the mean-field theory becomes inaccurate indicating that the\ninteractions lead to a strongly correlated state. We also present a microscopic\nderivation of the Ginzburg-Landau theory corresponding to this model.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are primarily studied in systems with\nshort-range interactions. In nature, however, non-relativistic quantum systems\noften exhibit long-range interactions. Under what conditions topological phases\nsurvive such interactions, and how they are modified when they do, is largely\nunknown. By studying the symmetry-protected topological phase of an\nantiferromagnetic spin-1 chain with $1/r^{\\alpha}$ interactions, we show that\ntwo very different outcomes are possible, depending on whether or not the\ninteractions are frustrated. While non-frustrated long-range interactions can\ndestroy the topological phase for $\\alpha\\lesssim3$, the topological phase\nsurvives frustrated interactions for all $\\alpha>0$. Our conclusions are based\non strikingly consistent results from large-scale matrix-product-state\nsimulations and effective-field-theory calculations, and we expect them to hold\nfor more general interacting spin systems. The models we study can be naturally\nrealized in trapped-ion quantum simulators, opening the prospect for\nexperimental investigation of the issues confronted here.\n", "  During the violent relaxation of a self-gravitating system a significant\nfraction of its mass may be ejected. If the time varying gravitational field\nalso breaks spherical symmetry this mass can potentially carry angular\nmomentum. Thus starting initial configurations with zero angular momentum can\nin principle lead to a bound virialized system with non-zero angular momentum.\nWe explore here, using numerical simulations, how much angular momentum can be\ngenerated in a virialized structure in this way, starting from configurations\nof cold particles which are very close to spherically symmetric. For initial\nconfigurations in which spherical symmetry is broken only by the Poissonian\nfluctuations associated with the finite particle number $N$, with $N$ in range\n$10^3$ to $10^5$, we find that the relaxed structures have standard \"spin\"\nparameters $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-3}$, and decreasing slowly with $N$. For slightly\nellipsoidal initial conditions, in which the finite-$N$ fluctuations break the\nresidual reflection symmetries, we observe values $\\lambda \\sim 10^{-2}$, of\nthe same order of magnitude as those reported for elliptical galaxies. The net\nangular momentum vector is typically aligned close to normal to the major\nsemi-axis of the triaxial relaxed structure, and also with that of the ejected\nmass. This simple mechanism may provide an alternative, or complement, to\n\"tidal torque theory\" for understanding the origin of angular momentum in\nastrophysical structures.\n", "  We present statistics of 133 faint 1.2-mm continuum sources detected in about\n120 deep ALMA pointing data that include all the archival deep data available\nby 2015 June. We derive number counts of 1.2 mm continuum sources down to 0.02\nmJy partly with the assistance of gravitational lensing, and find that the\ntotal integrated 1.2 mm flux of the securely identified sources is\n22.9^(+6.7)_(-5.6) Jy deg^(-2) that corresponds to 104^(+31)_(-25) % of the\nextragalactic background light (EBL) measured by COBE observations. These\nresults suggest that the major 1.2 mm EBL contributors are sources with 0.02\nmJy, and that very faint 1.2 mm sources with ~< 0.02 mJy contribute negligibly\nto the EBL with the possible flattening and/or truncation of number counts in\nthis very faint flux regime. To understand the physical origin of our faint\nALMA sources, we measure the galaxy bias bg by the counts-in-cells technique,\nand place a stringent upper limit of bg < 3.5 that is not similar to bg values\nof massive DRGs and SMGs but comparable to those of UV-bright sBzKs and LBGs.\nMoreover, in optical and near-infrared (NIR) deep fields, we identify\noptical-NIR counterparts for 59% of our faint ALMA sources, majority of which\nhave luminosities, colors, and the IRX-beta relation same as sBzKs and LBGs. We\nthus conclude that about a half of our faint ALMA sources are dust-poor high-z\ngalaxies as known as sBzKs and LBGs in optical studies, and that these faint\nALMA sources are not miniature (U)LIRGs simply scaled down with the infrared\nbrightness.\n", "  We develop a frame and dyad gauge-independent formalism for the calculus of\nvariations of functionals involving spinorial objects. As part of this\nformalism we define a modified variation operator which absorbs frame and spin\ndyad gauge terms. This formalism is applicable to both the standard spacetime\n(i.e. SL(2,C)) 2-spinors as well as to space (i.e. SU(2,C)) 2-spinors. We\ncompute expressions for the variations of the connection and the curvature\nspinors.\n", "  The halo dark matter (DM) can be gravitationally captured by the Sun. For\nself-interacting DM (SIDM), we show that the number of DM trapped inside the\nSun remains unsuppressed even if the DM-nucleon cross section is negligible. We\nconsider a SIDM model where $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is introduced to account for\nthe DM self-interaction. Such a model naturally leads to isospin violation for\nDM-nucleon interaction, although isospin symmetry is still allowed as a special\ncase. We show that the detection of neutrino signature from DM annihilation in\nthe Sun can probe those SIDM parameter ranges not reachable by direct\ndetections. Those parameter ranges are either the region with a very small\n$m_{\\chi}$ or the region opened up due to isospin violations.\n", "  We propose a continuous variable analog of quantum controlled-NOT gates based\non a system of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. This can be\nrealized by the engineering of parametric interaction between control and\ntarget polariton modes, which can be varied in time. As an explicit setup we\nuse a system of dipolaritons, which allows for enhancement of parametric\ninteraction by auxiliary classical fields and scalable multigate system\nrealization. The calculated fidelity is shown to exceed 99% for realistic\nsystem parameters.\n", "  Model-independent methods in cosmology has become an essential tool in order\nto deal with an increasing number of theoretical alternatives for explaining\nthe late-time acceleration of the Universe. In principle, this provides a way\nof testing the Cosmological Concordance (or $\\Lambda$CDM) model under different\nassumptions and ruling out whole classes of competing theories. One such\nmodel-independent method is the so-called cosmographic approach, which relies\nonly on the homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe on large scales. We show\nthat this method suffers from many shortcomings, providing biased results\ndepending on the auxiliary variable used in the series expansion and is unable\nto rule out models or adequately reconstruct theories with higher-order\nderivatives in either the gravitational or matter sector. Consequently, in its\npresent form, this method seems unable to provide reliable or useful results\nfor cosmological applications.\n", "  The spectral properties of the adjacency matrix provide a trove of\ninformation about the structure and function of complex networks. In\nparticular, the largest eigenvalue and its associated principal eigenvector are\ncrucial in the understanding of nodes centrality and the unfolding of dynamical\nprocesses. Here we show that two distinct types of localization of the\nprincipal eigenvector may occur in heterogeneous networks. For synthetic\nnetworks with degree distribution $P(q) \\sim q^{-\\gamma}$, localization occurs\non the largest hub if $\\gamma>5/2$; for $\\gamma<5/2$ a new type of localization\narises on a mesoscopic subgraph associated with the shell with the largest\nindex in the $K$-core decomposition. Similar evidence for the existence of\ndistinct localization modes is found in the analysis of real-world networks.\nOur results open a new perspective on dynamical processes on networks and on a\nrecently proposed alternative measure of node centrality based on the\nnon-backtracking matrix.\n", "  Nanostructured materials exhibit low thermal conductivity because of the\nadditional scattering due to phonon-boundary interactions. As these\ninteractions are highly sensitive to the mean free path (MFP) of a given phonon\nmode, MFP distributions in nanostructures can be dramatically distorted\nrelative to bulk. Here we calculate the MFP distribution in periodic nanoporous\nSi for different temperatures, using the recently developed MFP-dependent\nBoltzmann Transport Equation. After analyzing the relative contribution of each\nphonon branch to thermal transport in nanoporous Si, we find that at room\ntemperature optical phonons contribute 18 % to heat transport, compared to 5%\nin bulk Si. Interestingly, we observe a steady thermal conductivity in the\nnanoporous materials over a temperature range 200 K < T < 300 K, which we\nattribute to the ballistic transport of acoustic phonons with long intrinsic\nMFP. These results, which are also consistent with a recent experimental study,\nshed light on the origin of the reduction of thermal conductivity in\nnanostructured materials, and could contribute to multiscale heat transport\nengineering, in which the bulk material and geometry are optimized\nconcurrently.\n", "  Using our population synthesis code, we found that the typical chirp mass of\nPop III BH-BHs is $\\sim30~\\msun$ with the total mass of $\\sim60~\\msun$ so that\nthe inspiral chirp signal as well as quasi normal mode (QNM) of the merging BH\nare interesting targets of KAGRA. The detection rate of the coalescing Pop III\nBH-BHs is $\\sim$180 $\\rm events~yr^{-1}$$(\\rm SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}~\\msun\n\\rm~yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}))\\cdot([f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33)\\cdot Err_{sys}$ in our standard\nmodel where $\\rm SFR_{p},~f_b$ and $\\rm Err_{sys}$ are the peak value of the\nPop III star formation rate, the binary fraction and the systematic error with\n$\\rm Err_{sys}=1$ for our standard model, respectively. To evaluate the\nrobustness of chirp mass distribution and the range of $\\rm Err_{sys}$, we\nexamine the dependence of the results on the unknown parameters and the\ndistribution functions. We found that the chirp mass has a peak at $\\sim 30\n~\\msun$ in most of parameters and distribution functions as well as $\\rm\nErr_{sys}$ ranges from 0.046 to 4. The minimum rate corresponds to the worst\nmodel which we think unlikely so that unless $ {\\rm\n~(SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}~\\msun~yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}))\\cdot([f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33) \\ll 0.1}$,\nwe expect the Pop III BH-BHs merger rate of at least one event per year by\nKAGRA. Nakano, Tanaka \\& Nakamura (2015) show that if S/N of QNM is larger than\n35, we can confirm or refute the General Relativity (GR) more than 5 sigma\nlevel. In our standard model, the detection rate of Pop III BH-BHs whose S/N is\nlarger than 35 is $3.2~\\rm events~yr^{-1}$$(\\rm SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}~\\msun\n\\rm~yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}))\\cdot([f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33)\\cdot Err_{sys}$. Thus, there is\na good chance to check whether GR is correct or not in the strong gravity\nregion.\n", "  During LHC Run 1, the LHCb experiment recorded around $10^{11}$ collision\nevents. This paper describes Event Index - an event search system. Its primary\nfunction is to quickly select subsets of events from a combination of\nconditions, such as the estimated decay channel or number of hits in a\nsubdetector. Event Index is essentially Apache Lucene optimized for read-only\nindexes distributed over independent shards on independent nodes.\n", "  Halos, filaments, sheets and voids in the cosmic web can be defined in terms\nof the eigenvalues of the smoothed shear tensor and a threshold $\\lambda_{\\rm\nth}$. Using analytic methods, we construct mean maps centered on these types of\nstructures for Gaussian random fields corresponding to cosmological initial\nconditions. Each map also requires a choice of shear at the origin; we consider\nthree possibilities. We find characteristic sizes, shapes and other properties\nof the central objects in these mean maps and explore how these properties\nchange with varying the threshold and smoothing scale, i.e. varying the\nseparation of the cosmic web into different kinds of components. The mean maps\nbecome increasingly complex as the threshold $\\lambda_{\\rm th}$ decreases to\nzero. We also describe scatter around these mean maps, subtleties which can\narise in their construction, and some comparisons between halos in the maps and\ncollapsed halos at final times.\n", "  When two sheets of graphene stack in a twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG)\nconfiguration, the resulting constrained overlap between interplanar 2p\norbitals produce angle-tunable electronic absorption resonances. Using a novel\ncombination of multiphoton transient absorption (TA) microscopy and TEM, we\nresolve the resonant electronic structure, and ensuing electronic relaxation\ninside single tBLG domains. Strikingly, we find that the transient electronic\npopulation in resonantly excited tBLG domains is enhanced many fold, forming a\nmajor electronic relaxation bottleneck. 2-photon TA microscopy shows this\nbottleneck effect originates from a strongly bound, dark exciton state lying\n0.37 eV below the 1-photon absorption resonance. This stable coexistence of\nstrongly bound excitons alongside free-electron continuum states has not been\npreviously observed in a metallic, 2D material.\n", "  The density wave theory for the grand-design two-armed spiral pattern in\ngalaxies is successful in explaining several observed features. However, the\nlong-term persistence of this spiral structure is a serious problem since the\ngroup transport would destroy it within about a billion years as shown in a\nclassic paper by Toomre. In this paper we include the low velocity dispersion\ncomponent, namely gas, on an equal footing with stars in the formulation of the\ndensity wave theory, and obtain the dispersion relation for this coupled\nsystem. We show that the inclusion of gas makes the group transport slower by a\nfactor of few, thus allowing the pattern to persist longer - for several\nbillion years. Though still less than the Hubble time, this helps in making the\nspiral structure more long-lived. Further we show that addition of gas is\nessential to get a stable wave for the observed pattern speed for the Galaxy,\nwhich otherwise is not possible for a one-component stellar disc.\n", "  We classify protocols of entanglement distribution as excessive and\nnon-excessive ones. In a non-excessive protocol, the gain of entanglement is\nbounded by the amount of entanglement being communicated between the remote\nparties, while excessive protocols violate such bound. We first present\nexamples of excessive protocols that achieve a significant entanglement gain.\nNext we consider their use in noisy scenarios, showing that they improve\nentanglement achieved in other ways and for some situations excessive\ndistribution is the only possibility of gaining entanglement.\n", "  We propose a change of style for numerical estimations of physical quantities\nfrom measurements to inferences. We estimate the most probable quantities for\nall the parameter region simultaneously by using the raw data cooperatively.\nEstimations with higher precisions are made possible. We can obtain a physical\nquantity as a continuous function, which is differentiated to obtain another\nquantity. We applied the method to the Heisenberg spin-glass model in three\ndimensions. A dynamic correlation-length scaling analysis suggests that the\nspin-glass and the chiral-glass transitions occur at the same temperature with\na common exponent $\\nu$. The value is consistent with the experimental results.\nWe found that a size-crossover effect explains a spin-chirality separation\nproblem.\n", "  A system of two species of fermions of different mass confined in a\none-dimensional harmonic trap is studied with an exact diagonalization\napproach. It is shown independently on the number of particles that a mass\ndifference between fermionic species induces a separation in the lighter flavor\nsystem. The mechanism of emerging of separated phases is explained\nphenomenologically and confirmed with the help of a direct inspection of the\nground-state of the system. Finally, it is shown that the separation driven by\na mass difference, in contrast to the separation induced by a difference of\npopulations, is robust to the interactions with thermal environment.\n", "  Synchrotron radiation is commonly observed in connection with shocks of\ndifferent velocities, ranging from relativistic shocks associated with active\ngalactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts or microquasars to weakly- or\nnon-relativistic flows as those observed in supernova remnants. Recent\nobservations of synchrotron emission in protostellar jets are important not\nonly because they extend the range over which the acceleration process works,\nbut also because they allow to determine the jet and/or interstellar magnetic\nfield structure, thus giving insights on the jet ejection and collimation\nmechanisms. In this paper, we compute for the first time polarized\n(synchrotron) and non polarized (thermal X-ray) synthetic emission maps from\naxisymmetrical simulations of magnetized protostellar jets. We consider models\nwith different jet velocities and variability, as well as toroidal or helical\nmagnetic field. Our simulations show that variable, low-density jets with\nvelocities $\\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and $\\sim$ 10 times lighter than the\nenvironment can produce internal knots with significant synchrotron emission,\nand thermal X-rays in the shocked region of the leading bow shock moving in a\ndense medium. While models with a purely toroidal magnetic field show a very\nlarge degree of polarization, models with helical magnetic field show lower\nvalues and a decrease of the degree of polarization, in agreement with\nobservations of protostellar jets.\n", "  Identifying the true theory of dark matter depends crucially on accurately\ncharacterizing interactions of dark matter (DM) with other species. In the\ncontext of DM direct detection, we present a study of the prospects for\ncorrectly identifying the low-energy effective DM-nucleus scattering operators\nconnected to UV-complete models of DM-quark interactions. We take a census of\nplausible UV-complete interaction models with different low-energy\nleading-order DM-nuclear responses. For each model (corresponding to different\nspin-, momentum-, and velocity-dependent responses), we create a large number\nof realizations of recoil-energy spectra, and use Bayesian methods to\ninvestigate the probability that experiments will be able to select the correct\nscattering model within a broad set of competing scattering hypotheses. We\nconclude that agnostic analysis of a strong signal (such as Generation-2 would\nsee if cross sections are just below the current limits) seen on xenon and\ngermanium experiments is likely to correctly identify momentum dependence of\nthe dominant response, ruling out models with either \"heavy\" or \"light\"\nmediators, and enabling downselection of allowed models. However, a unique\ndetermination of the correct UV completion will critically depend on the\navailability of measurements from a wider variety of nuclear targets, including\niodine or fluorine. We investigate how model-selection prospects depend on the\nenergy window available for the analysis. In addition, we discuss accuracy of\nthe DM particle mass determination under a wide variety of scattering models,\nand investigate impact of the specific types of particle-physics uncertainties\non prospects for model selection.\n", "  Pulsars are good clocks in the universe. One fundamental question is that why\nthey are good clocks? This is related to the braking mechanism of pulsars.\nNowadays pulsar timing is done with unprecedented accuracy. More pulsars have\nbraking indices measured. The period derivative of intermittent pulsars and\nmagnetars can vary by a factor of several. However, during pulsar studies, the\nmagnetic dipole braking in vacuum is still often assumed. It is shown that the\nfundamental assumption of magnetic dipole braking (vacuum condition) does not\nexist and it is not consistent with the observations. The physical torque must\nconsider the presence of the pulsar magnetosphere. Among various efforts, the\nwind braking model can explain many observations of pulsars and magnetars in a\nunified way. It is also consistent with the up-to-date observations. It is time\nfor a paradigm shift in pulsar studies: from magnetic dipole braking to wind\nbraking. As one alternative to the magnetospheric model, the fallback disk\nmodel is also discussed.\n", "  Light top partners are the prime sign of naturalness in composite Higgs\nmodels. We explore here the possibility of non-standard top partner\nphenomenology. We show that even in the simplest extension of the minimal\ncomposite Higgs model, featuring an extra singlet pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson,\nthe branching ratios of the top partners into standard channels can be\nsignificantly altered, with no substantial change in the generated Higgs\npotential. Together with the variety of possible final states from the decay of\nthe pseudo-scalar singlet, this motivates more extensive analyses in the search\nfor the top partners.\n", "  We study the beta functions for four-dimensional conformal gravity using two\ndifferent parametrizations of metric fluctuation, linear split and exponential\nparametrization. We find that after imposing the traceless conditions, the beta\nfunctions are the same in four dimensions though the dependence on the\ndimensions are quite different. This indicates the universality of these\nresults. We also examine the beta functions in general quadratic theory with\nthe Einstein and cosmological terms for exponential parametrization, and find\nthat it leads to results for beta functions of dimensionful couplings different\nfrom linear split, though the fact that there exists nontrivial fixed point\nremains the same and the fixed points also remain the same.\n", "  We develop the single-channel local potential for the KbarN system, which is\napplicable to quantitative studies of Kbar bound states in nuclei. Because the\nhigh precision measurement of the kaonic hydrogen by SIDDHARTA reduces the\nuncertainty of the KbarN amplitude below the KbarN threshold, the local\npotential should be calibrated in a wide energy region. We establish a new\nmethod to construct the local potential focusing on the behavior of the\nscattering amplitude in the complex energy plane. Applying this method, we\nconstruct the KbarN potential based on the chiral coupled-channel approach with\nthe SIDDHARTA constraint. The wave function from the new potential indicates\nthe KbarN molecular structure of Lambda(1405).\n", "  We present the results of two Chandra X-ray Observatory ( CXO) observations\nof TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1741-302A/B. Our analysis also includes GeV\ngamma-ray and radio data. We investigate whether there is any connection\nbetween HESS J1741-302A/B and the sources seen at lower energies. One of the\nbrightest X-ray sources in the HESS J1741-302B field, CXOU J174112.1-302908,\nappears to be associated with a low-mass star (possibly representing a\nquiescent LMXB or CV), hence, it is unlikely to be a source of TeV gamma-rays.\nIn the same field we detected X-rays from WR 98a, which is likely to be a\ncolliding wind binary with massive stars, however, no TeV emission has been\nreported so far from such systems although a predictions have been made.\nFinally, Suzaku source J1740.5-3014 (which is not covered by the CXO\nobservations) appears to be a hard X-ray source detected by INTERGAL ISGRI\nwhich supports the magnetized CV classification and also makes its association\nwith the TeV emission unlikely. The young pulsar, undetected in X-rays and\nlocated near the CV, may be the contributor of relativistic particles\nresponsible for the TeV emission. Alternatively, HESS J1741-302 could be a new\ntype of accelerator, which is dark at lower energies.\n", "  We study the action of the BMS group in critical, bosonic string theory\nliving on a target space of the form $\\mathbb{M}^{d}\\times C$. Here $M^{d}$ is\n$d$-dimensional (asymptotically) flat spacetime and $C$ is an arbitrary\ncompactification. We provide a treatment of generalized Ward--Takahashi\nidentities and derive consistent boundary conditions for any $d$ from string\ntheory considerations. Finally, we derive BMS transformations in higher\ndimensional spacetimes and show that the generalized Ward--Takahashi identity\nof BMS produces Weinberg's soft theorem in string theory.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to test the basic model of negative AGN feedback.\nAccording to this model, once the central black hole accretes at the Eddington\nlimit and reaches a certain critical mass, AGN driven outflows blow out gas,\nsuppressing star formation in the host galaxy and self-regulating black hole\ngrowth. We consider a sample of 224 quasars selected from the SDSS at z<1\nobserved in the infrared band by Herschel. We evaluate the star formation rate\nin relation to several outflow signatures traced by the [OIII]4959,5007 and\n[OII]3726,3729 emission lines in about half of the sample with high quality\nspectra. Most of the quasars show asymmetric and broad wings in [OIII], which\nwe interpret as outflow signatures. We separate the quasars in two groups,\n``weakly'' and ``strongly'' outflowing, using three different criteria. When we\ncompare the mean star formation rate in five redshift bins in the two groups,\nwe find that the SFRs are comparable or slightly larger in the strongly\noutflowing quasars. We estimate the stellar mass from SED fitting and the\nquasars are distributed along the star formation main sequence, although with a\nlarge scatter. The scatter from this relation is uncorrelated with respect to\nthe kinematic properties of the outflow. Moreover, for quasars dominated in the\ninfrared by starburst or by AGN emission, we do not find any correlation\nbetween the star formation rate and the velocity of the outflow, a trend\npreviously reported in the literature for pure starburst galaxies. We conclude\nthat the basic AGN negative feedback scenario seems not to agree with our\nresults. Although we use a large sample of quasars, we did not find any\nevidence that the star formation rate is suppressed in the presence of AGN\ndriven outflows on large scale. A possibility is that feedback is effective\nover much longer timescales than those of single episodes of quasar activity.\n", "  We construct the solutions of slowly rotating gravastars with a thin shell.\nIn the zero-rotation limit, we consider the gravastar composed of a de Sitter\ncore, a thin shell, and Schwarzschild exterior spacetime. The rotational\neffects are treated as small axisymmetric and stationary perturbations. The\nperturbed internal and external spacetimes are matched with a uniformly\nrotating thin shell. We assume that the angular velocity of the thin shell,\n$\\Omega$, is much smaller than the Keplerian frequency of the nonrotating\ngravastar, $\\Omega_k$. The solutions within an accuracy up to the second order\nof $\\Omega/\\Omega_k$ are obtained. The thin shell matter is assumed to be\ndescribed by a perfect fluid and to satisfy the dominant energy condition in\nthe zero-rotation limit. In this study, we assume that the equation of state\nfor perturbations is the same as that of the unperturbed solution. The\nspherically symmetric component of the energy density perturbations,\n$\\delta\\sigma_0$, is assumed to vanish independently of the rotation rate.\nBased on these assumptions, we obtain many numerical solutions and investigate\nproperties of the rotational corrections to the structure of the thin shell\ngravastar.\n", "  When a nonrelativistic particle interacts with a scalar quantum field, the\nstandard perturbation theory leads to a dependence of the energy of its ground\nstate on an undefined parameter---\"momentum cutoff\"---due to the ultraviolet\ndivergence. We show that the use of nonasymptotic states of the system results\nin a calculation scheme in which all observable quantities remain finite and\ncontinuously depend on the coupling constant without any additional parameters.\nIt is furthermore demonstrated that the divergence of traditional perturbation\nseries is caused by the energy being a function with a logarithmic singularity\nfor small values of the coupling constant.\n", "  In a quantum network, distant observers sharing physical resources emitted by\nindependent sources can establish strong correlations, which defy any classical\nexplanation in terms of local variables. We discuss the characterization of\nnonlocal correlations in such a situation, when compared to those that can be\ngenerated in networks distributing independent local variables. We present an\niterative procedure for constructing Bell inequalities tailored for networks:\nstarting from a given network, and a corresponding Bell inequality, our\ntechnique provides new Bell inequalities for a more complex network, involving\none additional source and one additional observer. The relevance of our method\nis illustrated on a variety of networks, for which we demonstrate significant\nquantum violations.\n", "  We introduce a designer approach for extended Brans-Dicke gravity that allows\nus to obtain the evolution of the scalar field by fixing the Hubble parameter\nto that of a $w$CDM model. We obtain analytical approximations for $\\phi$ as a\nfunction of the scale factor and use these to build expressions for the\neffective Newton's constant at the background and at the linear level and the\nslip between the perturbed Newtonian potentials. By doing so, we are able to\nexplore their dependence on the fundamental parameters of the theory.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the quantum uncertainty in the beam width of\ntransverse optical modes and, for this purpose, define a corresponding quantum\noperator. Single mode states are studied as well as multimode states with small\nquantum noise. General relations are derived, and specific examples of\ndifferent modes and quantum states are examined. For the multimode case, we\nshow that the quantum uncertainty in the beam width can be completely\nattributed to the amplitude quadrature uncertainty of one specific mode, which\nis uniquely determined by the field under investigation. This discovery\nprovides us with a strategy for the reduction of the beam width noise by an\nappropriate choice of the quantum state.\n", "  We study the rheology of confined suspensions of neutrally buoyant rigid\nmonodisperse spheres in plane-Couette flow using Direct Numerical Simulations.\nWe find that if the width of the channel is a (small) integer multiple of the\nsphere's diameter, the spheres self-organize into two-dimensional layers that\nslide on each other and the suspension's effective viscosity is significantly\nreduced. Each two-dimensional layer is found to be structurally liquid-like but\ntheir dynamics is frozen in time.\n", "  We propose and study various realizations of a Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a\ncylinder geometry with fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices. The\ncylindrical optical lattice is created by copropagating Laguerre-Gauss beams,\ni.e.~light beams carrying orbital angular momentum. By strong focusing of the\nlight beams we create a real space optical lattice in the form of rings, which\nare offset in energy. A second set of Laguerre-Gauss beams then induces a\nRaman-hopping between these rings, imprinting phases corresponding to a\nsynthetic magnetic field (artificial gauge field). In addition, by rotating the\nlattice potential, we achieve a slowly varying flux through the hole of the\ncylinder, which allows us to probe the Hall response of the system as a\nrealization of Laughlin's thought experiment. We study how in the presence of\ninteractions fractional quantum Hall physics could be observed in this setup.\n", "  We develop two general methods to infer the gravitational potential of a\nsystem using steady-state tracers, i.e., tracers with a time-independent\nphase-space distribution. Combined with the phase-space continuity equation,\nthe time independence implies a universal Orbital Probability Density Function\n(oPDF) $\\mathrm{d} P(\\lambda|{\\rm orbit})\\propto \\mathrm{d} t$, where $\\lambda$\nis the coordinate of the particle along the orbit. The oPDF is equivalent to\nJeans theorem, and is the key physical ingredient behind most dynamical\nmodelling of steady-state tracers. In the case of a spherical potential, we\ndevelop a likelihood estimator that fits analytical potentials to the system,\nand a non-parametric method (\"phase-mark\") that reconstructs the potential\nprofile, both assuming only the oPDF. The methods involve no extra assumptions\nabout the tracer distribution function and can be applied to tracers with any\narbitrary distribution of orbits, with possible extension to non-spherical\npotentials. The methods are tested on Monte Carlo samples of steady-state\ntracers in dark matter haloes to show that they are unbiased as well as\nefficient. A fully documented \\textsc{C/Python} code implementing our method is\nfreely available at a GitHub repository linked from\n\\url{http://icc.dur.ac.uk/data/#oPDF}.\n", "  Using realistic cosmological simulations of Milky Way sized haloes, we study\ntheir dynamical state and the accuracy of inferring their mass profiles with\nsteady-state models of dynamical tracers. We use a new method that describes\nthe phase-space distribution of a steady-state tracer population in a spherical\npotential without any assumption regarding the distribution of their orbits.\nApplying the method to five haloes from the Aquarius $\\Lambda$CDM N-body\nsimulation, we find that dark matter particles are an accurate tracer that\nenables the halo mass and concentration parameters to be recovered with an\naccuracy of $5\\%$. Assuming a potential profile of the NFW form does not\nsignificantly affect the fits in most cases, except for halo A whose density\nprofile differs significantly from the NFW form, leading to a $30\\%$ bias in\nthe dynamically fitted parameters. The existence of substructures in the dark\nmatter tracers only affects the fits by $\\sim 1\\%$. Applying the method to mock\nstellar haloes generated by a particle-tagging technique, we find the stars are\nfarther from equilibrium than dark matter particles, yielding a systematic bias\nof $\\sim 20\\%$ in the inferred mass and concentration parameter. The level of\nsystematic biases obtained from a conventional distribution function fit to\nstars is comparable to ours, while similar fits to DM tracers are significantly\nbiased in contrast to our fits. In line with previous studies, the mass bias is\nmuch reduced near the tracer half-mass radius.\n", "  Recently a new class of 1/8-BPS regular geometries in type IIB string theory\nwas constructed in arXiv:1503.01463. In this paper we provide a precise\ndescription of the semiclassical states dual, in the AdS/CFT sense, to these\ngeometries. In explicit examples we show that the holographic 1-point functions\nand the Ryu-Takayanagi's Entanglement Entropy for a single small interval match\nthe corresponding CFT calculations performed by using the proposed dual states.\nWe also discuss several new examples of such precision holography analysis in\nthe 1/4-BPS sector and provide an explicit proof that the small interval\nderivation of the Entanglement Entropy used in arXiv:1405.6185 is fully\ncovariant.\n", "  A modification of general relativity is presented in which Newton's constant\nand the cosmological constant become a conjugate pair of dynamical variables.\n", "  We study the fermionic Schwinger effect in two dimensional de Sitter\nspacetime. To do so we first present a method to semiclassically compute the\nnumber of pairs created per momentum mode for general time dependent fields. In\naddition the constant electric field is studied in depth. In this case\nsolutions for the Dirac equation can be found and the number of pairs can be\ncomputed using the standard Bogoliubov method. This result is shown to agree\nwith the semiclassical one in the appropriate limit. The solutions are also\nused to compute the expectation value of the induced current. Comparing these\nresults to similar studies for bosons we find that while the results agree in\nthe semiclassical limit they do not generally. Especially there is no\noccurrence of a strong current for small electric fields.\n", "  Massive quiescent galaxies have much smaller physical sizes at high redshift\nthan today. The strong evolution of galaxy size may be caused by progenitor\nbias, major and minor mergers, adiabatic expansion, and/or renewed star\nformation, but it is difficult to test these theories observationally. Herein,\nwe select a sample of 35 massive, compact galaxies ($M_* = 1-3 \\times 10^{11}$\nM$_\\odot$, $M_*/R^{1.5} > 10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$/kpc$^{1.5}$) at $z=2$ in the\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation Illustris and trace them forward to\n$z=0$ to uncover their evolution and identify their descendants. By $z=0$, the\noriginal factor of 3 difference in stellar mass spreads to a factor of 20. The\ndark matter halo masses similarly spread from a factor of 5 to 40. The\ngalaxies' evolutionary paths are diverse: about half acquire an ex-situ\nenvelope and are the core of a more massive descendant, a third survive\nundisturbed and gain very little mass, 15% are consumed in a merger with a more\nmassive galaxy, and a small remainder are thoroughly mixed by major mergers.\nThe galaxies grow in size as well as mass, and only $\\sim$10% remain compact by\n$z=0$. The majority of the size growth is driven by the acquisition of ex-situ\nmass. The most massive galaxies at $z=0$ are the most likely to have compact\nprogenitors, but this trend possesses significant dispersion which precludes a\ndirect linkage to compact galaxies at $z=2$. The compact galaxies' merger rates\nare influenced by their $z=2$ environments, so that isolated or satellite\ncompact galaxies (which are protected from mergers) are the most likely to\nsurvive to the present day.\n", "  We investigate possible end-points of the superradiant instability for a\ncharged black hole with a reflecting mirror. By considering a fully coupled\nsystem of gravity and a charged scalar field, hairy black hole solutions are\nobtained. The linear stability of these black hole solutions is studied.\n", "  The Hawking radiation spectrum of Kerr-Sen axion-dilaton black holes is\nderived, in the context of dark spinors tunnelling across the horizon. Since a\nblack hole has a well defined temperature, it should radiate in principle all\nthe standard model particles, similar to a black body at that temperature. We\ninvestigate the tunnelling of mass dimension one spin-1/2 dark fermions, that\nare beyond the standard model and are prime candidates to the dark matter.\nTheir interactions with the standard model matter and gauge fields are\nsuppressed by at least one power of unification scale, being restricted just to\nthe Higgs field and to the graviton likewise. The tunnelling method for the\nemission and absorption of mass dimension one particles across the event\nhorizon of Kerr-Sen axion-dilaton black holes is shown here to provide further\nevidence for the universality of black hole radiation, further encompassing\nparticles beyond the standard model.\n", "  Warped models with the Higgs confined to the weak brane and the gauge and\nmatter fields accessing the $AdS_5$ bulk provide viable setting to address the\ngauge hierarchy problem. Brane kinetic terms for the bulk fields are known to\nease some of the tensions of these models with precision electroweak\nobservables and flavor constraints. We study the loop-driven Higgs coupling to\nthe gluons that are relevant to the Higgs program at LHC, in this scenario. We\ndemonstrate a partial cancellation in the contribution of the fermionic\nKaluza-Klein (KK) towers within such framework relatively independent of the 5D\nparameters. The entire dependence of this coupling on the new physics arises\nfrom the mixing between the Standard Model states and the KK excitations. We\nfind that the present precision in measurement of these couplings can lead to a\nconstraint on the KK scale up to 1.2 TeV at $95\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  We report charged exciton (trion) formation dynamics in doped monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically molybdenum diselenide\n(MoSe2), using resonant two-color pump-probe spectroscopy. When resonantly\npumping the exciton transition, trions are generated on a picosecond timescale\nthrough exciton-electron interaction. As the pump energy is tuned from the high\nenergy to low energy side of the inhomogeneously broadened exciton resonance,\nthe trion formation time increases by ~ 50%. This feature can be explained by\nthe existence of both localized and delocalized excitons in a disordered\npotential and suggests the existence of an exciton mobility edge in TMDs. The\nquasiparticle formation and conversion processes are important for interpreting\nphotoluminescence and photoconductivity in TMDs.\n", "  We present a derivation of a recently proposed theory for the time dependence\nof density fluctuations in stationary states of strongly interacting, athermal,\nself-propelled particles. The derivation consists of two steps. First, we start\nfrom the equation of motion for the joint distribution of particles' positions\nand self-propulsions and we integrate out the self-propulsions. In this way we\nderive an approximate, many-particle evolution equation for the probability\ndistribution of the particles' positions. Second, we use this evolution\nequation to describe the time dependence of steady-state density correlations.\nWe derive a memory function representation of the density correlation function\nand then we use a factorization approximation to obtain an approximate\nexpression for the memory function. In the final equation of motion for the\ndensity correlation function the non-equilibrium character of the active system\nmanifests itself through the presence of a new steady-state correlation\nfunction that quantifies spatial correlations of the velocities of the\nparticles. This correlation function enters into the frequency term, and thus\nit describes the dependence of the short-time dynamics on the properties of the\nself-propulsions. More importantly, the correlation function of particles'\nvelocities enters into the vertex of the memory function and through the vertex\nit modifies the long-time glassy dynamics.\n", "  The recent discovery by Bachetti et al. (2014) of a pulsar in M82 that can\nreach luminosities of up to 10^40 ergs s^-1, a factor of ~100 the Eddington\nluminosity for a 1.4 Msol compact object, poses a challenge for accretion\nphysics. In order to better understand the nature of this source and its duty\ncycle, and in the light of several physical models that have been subsequently\npublished, we conduct a spectral and temporal analysis of the 0.5-8 keV X-ray\nemission from this source from 15 years of Chandra observations. We fit the\nChandra spectra of the pulsar with a power-law model and a disk black body\nmodel, subjected to interstellar absorption in M82. We carefully assess for the\neffect of pile-up in our observations, where 4/19 observations have a pile-up\nfraction >10%, which we account for during spectral modeling with a convolution\nmodel. When fitted with a power-law model, the average photon index when the\nsource is at high luminosity (L_X>10^39 ergs s^-1) is Gamma=1.33+/-0.15. For\nthe disk black body model, the average temperature is T=3.24+/-0.65 keV,\nconsistent with other luminous X-ray pulsars. We also investigated the\ninclusion of a soft excess component and spectral break, finding that the\nspectra are also consistent with these features common to luminous X-ray\npulsars. In addition, we present spectral analysis from NuSTAR over the 3-50\nkeV range where we have isolated the pulsed component. We find that the pulsed\nemission in this band is best fit by a power-law with a high-energy cut-off,\nwhere Gamma=0.6+/-0.3 and E_C=14^{+5}_{-3} keV. While the pulsar has previously\nbeen identified as a transient, we find from our longer-baseline study that it\nhas been remarkably active over the 15-year period, where for 9/19 (47%)\nobservations that we analyzed, the pulsar appears to be emitting at a\nluminosity in excess of 10^39 ergs s^-1, greater than 10 times its Eddington\nlimit.\n", "  The representation of graph states in the X-basis as well as the calculation\nof graph state overlaps can efficiently be performed by using the concept of\nX-Chains [Phys. Rev. A 92(1) 012322]. We present a necessary and sufficient\ncriterion for X-chains and show that they can efficiently be determined by\nBareiss algorithm. An analytical approach for searching X-chain groups of a\ngraph state is proposed. Furthermore we generalize the concept of X-chains to\nso-called Euler chains, whose induced subgraphs are Eulerian. This approach\nhelps to determine if a given vertex set is an X-chain and we show how Euler\nchains can be used in the construction of multipartite Bell inequalities for\ngraph states.\n", "  A spherical-symmetric gamma-ray emission from the central region of the\nGalaxy has been recently identified in Fermi-LAT data, and initially associated\nto dark matter particle annihilations. Guided by the evidence for a high gas\ndensity in the inner kpc of the Galaxy correlated with a very large Supernova\nrate, and hence with ongoing cosmic-ray acceleration, we investigate instead\nthe possibility of addressing this excess in terms of ordinary cosmic-ray\nsources and standard steady-state diffusion. We alter the source term, and\nconsistently the correlated gamma-ray emissions, in the context of a\ntemplate-fitting analysis. We focus on a region of interest (ROI) defined as:\n$|l|<20^{\\circ}; \\hspace{5mm} 2^{\\circ}<|b|<20^{\\circ},$ with $l$ and $b$ the\nGalactic longitude and latitude coordinates. We analyze in detail the overall\ngoodness of the fit of our framework, and perform a detailed direct comparison\nagainst data examining profiles in different directions. Remarkably, the test\nstatistic of the fit related to our scenario turns out to be as good as the\nDark Matter one in the ROI here considered.\n", "  Constraining mixing processes and chemical composition is a central problem\nin stellar physics as their impact on stellar age determinations leads to\nbiases in our studies of stellar evolution, galactic history and exoplanetary\nsystems. In two previous papers, we showed how seismic inversion techniques\ncould offer strong constraints on such processes by pointing out weaknesses in\ntheoretical models. We now apply our technique to the solar analogues 16CygA\nand 16CygB, being amongst the best targets in the Kepler field to test the\ndiagnostic potential of seismic inversions. The combination of various seismic\nindicators helps to provide more constrained and accurate fundamendal\nparameters for these stars. We use the latest seismic, spectroscopic and\ninterferometric observational constraints in the litterature for this system to\ndetermine reference models independently for both stars. We carry out seismic\ninversions of the acoustic radius, the mean density and a core conditions\nindicator. We note that a degeneracy exists for the reference models. Namely,\nchanging the diffusion coefficient or the chemical composition within the\nobservational values leads to 5% changes in mass, 3% changes in radius and up\nto 8% changes in age. We use acoustic radius and mean density inversions to\nimprove our reference models then carry out inversions for a core conditions\nindicator. Thanks to its sensitivity to microscopic diffusion and chemical\ncomposition mismatches, we are able to reduce the mass dispersion to 2%, namely\n[0.96, 1.0] M_sun, the radius dispersion to 1%, namely [1.188, 1.200] R_sun and\nthe age dispersion to 3%, namely [7.0, 7.4] Gy, for 16CygA. For 16CygB, we can\ncheck the consistency of the models but not reduce independently the age\ndispersion. Nonetheless, assuming consistency with the age of 16CygA helps to\nfurther constrain its mass and radius.\n", "  We show that the pressure-induced metal-insulator transition (MIT) in\nLaMnO$_3$ is fundamentally different from the Mott-Hubbard transition and is\npercolative in nature, with the measured resistivity obeying the percolation\nscaling laws. Using the Gutzwiller method to treat correlation effects in a\nmodel Hamiltonian that includes both Coulomb and Jahn-Teller interactions, we\nshow, One, that the MIT is driven by a competition between electronic\ncorrelation and the electron-lattice interaction, an issue that has been long\ndebated, and Two, that with compressed volume, the system has a tendency\ntowards phase separation into insulating and metallic regions, consisting,\nrespectively, of Jahn-Teller distorted and undistorted octahedra. This tendency\nmanifests itself in a mixed phase of intermixed insulating and metallic regions\nin the experiment. Conduction in the mixed phase occurs by percolation and the\nMIT occurs when the metallic volume fraction, steadily increasing with\npressure, exceeds the percolation threshold $v_c \\approx 0.29$. Measured\nhigh-pressure resistivity follows the percolation scaling laws quite well,\nestablishing the percolative nature of conduction, and the temperature\ndependence follows the Efros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping behavior for\ngranular materials.\n", "  It is presented in this paper a review of one of several interactions between\nthe magnetosphere and the ionosphere through the field-aligned currents (FACs).\nSome characteristics and physical implications of the currents flowing in a\nplane perpendicular to the magnetic field at high latitudes are discussed. The\nbehavior of this system as an electric circuit is explained, where momentum and\nenergy are transferred via Poynting flux from the magnetosphere into the\nionosphere.\n", "  Recently, it has been suggested that the Many-Body Localized phase can be\ncharacterized by local integrals of motion. Here we introduce a Hilbert space\npreserving renormalization scheme that iteratively finds such integrals of\nmotion exactly. Our method is based on the consecutive action of a similarity\ntransformation using displacement operators. We show, as a proof of principle,\nlocalization and the delocalization transition in interacting fermion chains\nwith random onsite potentials. Our scheme of consecutive displacement\ntransformations can be used to study Many Body Localization in any dimension,\nas well as disorder-free Hamiltonians.\n", "  We consider a recursive scheme for defining the coefficients in the operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) of an arbitrary number of composite operators in the\ncontext of perturbative, Euclidean quantum field theory in four dimensions. Our\niterative scheme is consistent with previous definitions of OPE coefficients\nvia the flow equation method, or methods based on Feynman diagrams. It allows\nus to prove that a strong version of the \"associativity\" condition holds for\nthe OPE to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory. Such a condition was\npreviously proposed in an axiomatic setting in [1] and has interesting\nconceptual consequences: 1) One can characterise perturbations of quantum field\ntheories abstractly in a sort of \"Hochschild-like\" cohomology setting, 2) one\ncan prove a \"coherence theorem\" analogous to that in an ordinary algebra: The\nOPE coefficients for a product of two composite operators uniquely determine\nthose for $n$ composite operators. We concretely prove our main results for the\nEuclidean $\\varphi^4_4$ quantum field theory, covering also the massless case.\nOur methods are rather general, however, and would also apply to other, more\ninvolved, theories such as Yang-Mills theories.\n", "  Enhancement and suppression of nonlinear processes in coupled systems of\nplasmonic converters and quantum emitters are well-studied theoretically,\nnumerically and experimentally, in the past decade. Here, in difference, we\nexplicitly demonstrate --with a single equation-- how the presence of a Fano\nresonance leads to cancellation of nonresonant terms in a four-wave mixing\nprocess. Cancellation in the denominator gives rise to enhancement in the\nnonlinearity. The explicit demonstration, we present here, guides us to the\nmethod for achieving more and more orders of magnitude enhancement factors via\npath interference effects. We also study the coupled system of a plasmonic\nconverter with two quantum emitters. We show that the potential for the\nenhancement increases dramatically due to better cancellation of the terms in\nthe denominator.\n", "  The evolution of many kinetic processes in 1+1 (space-time) dimensions\nresults in 2d directed percolative landscapes. The active phases of these\nmodels possess numerous hidden geometric orders characterized by various types\nof large-scale and/or coarse-grained percolative backbones that we define. For\nthe patterns originated in the classical directed percolation (DP) and contact\nprocess (CP) we show from the Monte-Carlo simulation data that these\npercolative backbones emerge at specific critical points as a result of\ncontinuous phase transitions. These geometric transitions belong to the DP\nuniversality class and their nonlocal order parameters are the capacities of\ncorresponding backbones. The multitude of conceivable percolative backbones\nimplies the existence of infinite cascades of such geometric transitions in the\nkinetic processes considered. We present simple arguments to support the\nconjecture that such cascades of transitions is a generic feature of\npercolation as well as many others transitions with nonlocal order parameters.\n", "  We study the superstring inspired $E_{6}$ model motivated $U(1)_{N}$\nextension of the supersymmetric standard model to explore the possibility of\nexplaining the recent excess CMS events and the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse in eight possible variants of the model. In light of the hints from\nshort-baseline neutrino experiments at the existence of one or more light\nsterile neutrinos, we also study the neutrino mass matrices dictated by the\nfield assignments and the discrete symmetries in these variants. We find that\nall the variants can explain the excess CMS events via the exotic slepton\ndecay, while for a standard choice of the discrete symmetry four of the\nvariants have the feature of allowing high scale baryogenesis (leptogenesis).\nFor one other variant three body decay induced soft baryogenesis mechanism is\npossible which can induce baryon number violating neutron-antineutron\noscillation. We also point out a new discrete symmetry which has the feature of\nensuring proton stability and forbidding tree level flavor changing neutral\ncurrent processes while allowing for the possibility of high scale leptogenesis\nfor two of the variants. On the other hand, neutrino mass matrix of the\n$U(1)_{N}$ model variants naturally accommodates three active and two sterile\nneutrinos which acquire masses through their mixing with extra neutral fermions\ngiving rise to interesting textures for neutrino masses.\n", "  We explore the challenges posed by the violation of Bell-like inequalities by\n$d$-dimensional systems exposed to imperfect state-preparation and measurement\nsettings. We address, in particular, the limit of high-dimensional systems,\nnaturally arising when exploring the quantum-to-classical transition. We show\nthat, although suitable Bell inequalities can be violated, in principle, for\nany dimension of given subsystems, it is in practice increasingly challenging\nto detect such violations, even if the system is prepared in a maximally\nentangled state. We characterize the effects of random perturbations on the\nstate or on the measurement settings, also quantifying the efforts needed to\ncertify the possible violations in case of complete ignorance on the system\nstate at hand.\n", "  Light scalar hadrons can be understood as dynamically generated resonances.\nThese arise as `companion poles' in the propagators of quark-antiquark seed\nstates when accounting for meson-loop contributions to the self-energies of the\nlatter. Along this line, we extend previous calculations of T\\\"ornqvist and\nRoos and of Boglione and Pennington, where the resonance $a_{0}(980)$ appears\nas companion pole in the propagator of $a_{0}(1450)$ which is predominantly a\nquark-antiquark state. We also construct an effective Lagrangian where\n$a_{0}(1450)$ couples to pseudoscalar mesons with both non-derivative and\nderivative interactions. Computing the one-loop self-energy, we demonstrate\nthat the propagator has two poles: a companion pole corresponding to\n$a_{0}(980)$ and a pole of the seed state $a_{0}(1450)$. The positions of these\npoles are in quantitative agreement with experimental data.\n", "  The final step of most large-scale structure analyses involves the comparison\nof power spectra or correlation functions to theoretical models. It is clear\nthat the theoretical models have parameter dependence, but frequently the\nmeasurements and the covariance matrix depend upon some of the parameters as\nwell. We show that a very simple interpolation scheme from an unstructured mesh\nallows for an efficient way to include this parameter dependence\nself-consistently in the analysis at modest computational expense. We describe\ntwo schemes for covariance matrices. The scheme which uses the geometric\nstructure of such matrices performs roughly twice as well as the simplest\nscheme, though both perform very well.\n", "  We present a combined analysis of LHC Higgs data (signal strengths) together\nwith LEP-2 WW production measurements. To characterize possible deviations from\nthe Standard Model (SM) predictions, we employ the framework of an Effective\nField Theory (EFT) where the SM is extended by higher-dimensional operators\nsuppressed by the mass scale of new physics $\\Lambda$. The analysis is\nperformed consistently at the order $\\Lambda^{-2}$ in the EFT expansion keeping\nall the relevant operators. While the two data sets suffer from flat\ndirections, together they impose stringent model-independent constraints on the\nanomalous triple gauge couplings. As a side product, we provide the results of\nthe combined fit in different EFT bases.\n", "  Reconstructed mass variables, such as $M_2$, $M_{2C}$, $M_T^\\star$, and\n$M_{T2}^W$, play an essential role in searches for new physics at hadron\ncolliders. The calculation of these variables generally involves constrained\nminimization in a large parameter space, which is numerically challenging. We\nprovide a C++ code, OPTIMASS, which interfaces with the MINUIT library to\nperform this constrained minimization using the Augmented Lagrangian Method.\nThe code can be applied to arbitrarily general event topologies and thus allows\nthe user to significantly extend the existing set of kinematic variables. We\ndescribe this code and its physics motivation, and demonstrate its use in the\nanalysis of the fully leptonic decay of pair-produced top quarks using the\n$M_2$ variables.\n", "  The dynamics of short-lived mRNA results in bursts of protein production in\ngene regulatory networks. We investigate the propagation of bursting noise\nbetween different levels of mathematical modelling, and demonstrate that\nconventional approaches based on diffusion approximations can fail to capture\nbursting noise. An alternative coarse-grained model, the so-called piecewise\ndeterministic Markov process (PDMP), is seen to outperform the diffusion\napproximation in biologically relevant parameter regimes. We provide a\nsystematic embedding of the PDMP model into the landscape of existing\napproaches, and we present analytical methods to calculate its stationary\ndistribution and switching frequencies.\n", "  We propose a new type of a three-loop induced neutrino mass model with dark\nmatter candidates which are required for the neutrino mass generation. The\nsmallness of neutrino masses can be naturally explained without introducing\nsuper heavy particles, namely, much heavier than a TeV scale and quite small\ncouplings as compared to the gauge couplings. We find that as a bonus, the\nanomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment can simultaneously be explained\nby loop effects of new particles. In our model, there are doubly charged scalar\nbosons and leptons from isospin doublet fields which give characteristic\ncollider signatures. In particular, the doubly charged scalar bosons can decay\ninto the same-sign dilepton with its chirality of both right-handed or left-\nand right-handed. This can be a smoking gun signature to identify our model and\nbe useful to distinguish other models with doubly charged scalar bosons at\ncollider experiments.\n", "  Supermassive black hole (BH) mergers produce powerful gravitational wave (GW)\nemission. Asymmetry in this emission imparts a recoil kick to the merged BH,\nwhich can eject the BH from its host galaxy altogether. Recoiling BHs could be\nobserved as offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). Several candidates have been\nidentified, but systematic searches have been hampered by large uncertainties\nregarding their observability. By extracting merging BHs and host galaxy\nproperties from the Illustris cosmological simulations, we have developed a\ncomprehensive model for recoiling AGN. Here, for the first time, we model the\neffects of BH spin alignment and recoil dynamics based on the gas-richness of\nhost galaxies. We predict that if BH spins are not highly aligned,\nseeing-limited observations could resolve offset AGN, making them promising\ntargets for all-sky surveys. For randomly-oriented spins, less than about 10\nspatially-offset AGN may be detectable in HST-COSMOS, and > 10^3 could be found\nwith Pan-STARRS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. Nearly a thousand velocity-offset\nAGN are predicted within the SDSS footprint; the rarity of large broad-line\noffsets among SDSS quasars is likely due in part to selection effects but\nsuggests that spin alignment plays a role in suppressing recoils. Nonetheless,\nin our most physically motivated model where alignment occurs only in gas-rich\nmergers, hundreds of offset AGN should be found in all-sky surveys. Our\nfindings strongly motivate a dedicated search for recoiling AGN.\n", "  A holographic realization for ferromagnetic systems has been constructed.\nOwing to the holographic dictionary proposed on the basis of this realization,\nwe obtained relevant thermodynamic quantities such as magnetization, magnetic\nsusceptibility, and free energy. This holographic model reproduces the behavior\nof the mean field theory near the critical temperature. At low temperatures,\nthe results automatically incorporate the contributions from spin wave\nexcitations and conduction electrons.\n", "  The generation of energetic electron bunches by the interaction of a short,\nultra-intense ($I>10^{19} \\textrm{W/cm}^2$) laser pulse with \"grating\" targets\nhas been investigated in a regime of ultra-high pulse-to-prepulse contrast\n($10^{12}$). For incidence angles close to the resonant condition for Surface\nPlasmon (SP) excitation, a strong electron emission was observed within a\nnarrow cone along the target surface, with energies exceeding 10 MeV. Both the\nenergy and the number of emitted electrons were strongly enhanced with respect\nto simple flat targets. The experimental data are closely reproduced by\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, which provide evidence for the\ngeneration of relativistic SPs and for their role in driving the acceleration\nprocess. Besides the possible applications of the scheme as a compact,\nultra-short source of MeV electrons, these results are a step forward the\ndevelopment of high field plasmonics.\n", "  Application of the nuclear track emulsion technique (NTE) in radioactivity\nand nuclear fission studies is discussed. It is suggested to use a HSP-1000\nautomated microscope for searching for a collinear cluster tri-partition of\nheavy nuclei implanted in NTE. Calibrations of $\\alpha $-particles and ion\nranges in a novel NTE are carried out. Surface exposures of NTE samples to a\n${}^{252}$Cf source started. Planar events containing fragments and long-range\n$\\alpha $-particles as well as fragment triples only are studied. NTE samples\nare calibrated by ions Kr and Xe of energy of 1.2 and 3 A MeV.\n", "  We study the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters due to the excitation and\ndamping of tidally driven $g$-modes within solar-type host stars. Linearly\nresonant $g$-modes (the dynamical tide) are driven to such large amplitudes in\nthe stellar core that they excite a sea of other $g$-modes through weakly\nnonlinear interactions. By solving the dynamics of large networks of\nnonlinearly coupled modes, we show that the nonlinear dissipation rate of the\ndynamical tide is several orders of magnitude larger than the linear\ndissipation rate. We find stellar tidal quality factors $Q \\approx 10^5-10^6$\nfor systems with planet mass $M_p \\geq 0.5 M_\\mathrm{J}$ and orbital period $P\n\\leq 2$ days, which implies that such systems decay on timescales that are\nsmall compared to the main-sequence lifetime of their solar-type hosts.\nAccording to our results, there are $\\approx 10$ currently known exoplanetary\nsystems, including WASP-19b and HAT-P-36-b, with orbital decay timescales\nshorter than a Gyr. Rapid, tidally induced orbital decay may explain the\nobserved paucity of planets with $M_p \\ge M_\\mathrm{J}$ and $P < 2$ days around\nsolar-type hosts and could generate detectable transit-timing variations in the\nnear future.\n", "  The triumph of effective mass theory in describing the energy spectrum of\ndopants does not guarantee that the model wavefunctions will withstand an\nexperimental test. Such wavefunctions have recently been probed by scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy, revealing localized patterns of resonantly enhanced\ntunneling currents. We show that the shape of the conducting splotches resemble\na cut through Kohn-Luttinger (KL) hydrogenic envelopes, which modulate the\ninterfering Bloch states of conduction electrons. All the non-monotonic\nfeatures of the current profile are consistent with the charge density\nfluctuations observed between successive {001} atomic planes, including a\ncounterintuitive reduction of the symmetry - a heritage of the lowered point\ngroup symmetry at these planes. A model-independent analysis of the diffraction\nfigure constrains the value of the electron wavevector to $k_0 = (0.82 \\pm\n0.03)(2\\pi/a_{Si})$. Unlike prior measurements, averaged over a sizeable\ndensity of electrons, this estimate is obtained directly from isolated\nelectrons. We further investigate the model-specific anisotropy of the wave\nfunction envelope, related to the effective mass anisotropy. This anisotropy\nappears in the KL variational wave function envelope as the ratio between Bohr\nradii b=a. We demonstrate that the central cell corrected estimates for this\nratio are encouragingly accurate, leading to the conclusion that the KL theory\nis a valid model not only for energies but for wavefunctions as well.\n", "  The Kepler mission has discovered more than 4000 exoplanet candidates. Many\nare in systems with tightly packed inner planets. Inside-Out Planet Formation\n(IOPF) has been proposed to explain these systems. It involves sequential in\nsitu planet formation at the local pressure maximum of a retreating dead zone\ninner boundary (DZIB). Pebbles accumulate at this pressure trap, which builds\nup a ring, and then a planet. The planet is expected to grow until it opens a\ngap, which helps to both truncate pebble accretion and induce DZIB retreat that\nsets the location of formation of the next planet. This simple scenario may be\nmodified if the planet migrates significantly from its formation location. Thus\nplanet-disk interactions play a crucial role in the IOPF scenario. We present\nnumerical simulations that first assess migration of planets of various masses\nthat are forming at the DZIB of an active accretion disk, where the effective\nviscosity rapidly increases in the radially inward direction. We find that the\ndisk's torques on the planet tend to trap the planet at a location very close\nto the initial pressure maximum where it formed. We then study gap opening by\nthese planets to assess at what mass a significant gap is created. Finally we\npresent a simple model for DZIB retreat due to penetration of X-rays from the\nstar to the disk midplane. Overall, these simulations help to quantify both the\nmass scale of first,\"Vulcan,\" planet formation and the orbital separation to\nthe location of second planet formation.\n", "  We report the detection of 48 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) out of 75 observed\nthus far using the LOFAR in the frequency range 110-188 MHz. We have also\ndetected three MSPs out of nine observed in the frequency range 38-77 MHz. This\nis the largest sample of MSPs ever observed at these low frequencies, and half\nof the detected MSPs were observed for the first time at frequencies below 200\nMHz. We present the average pulse profiles of the detected MSPs, their\neffective pulse widths, and flux densities and compare these with higher\nobserving frequencies. The flux-calibrated, multifrequency LOFAR pulse profiles\nare publicly available via the EPN Database of Pulsar Profiles. We also present\naverage values of dispersion measures (DM) and discuss DM and profile\nvariations. About 35% of the MSPs show strong narrow profiles, another 25%\nexhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. A\nqualitative comparison of LOFAR profiles with those at higher radio frequencies\nshows constant separation between profile components. Similarly, the profile\nwidths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unless\nscattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. This is very different from\nwhat is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region in\nthe MSP magnetosphere. The amplitude ratio of the profile components, on the\nother hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with the\ntrailing component becoming dominant. As previously demonstrated this can be\ncaused by aberration and retardation. This data set enables high-precision\nstudies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, Faraday\nrotation, and scattering in the interstellar medium. Characterising and\ncorrecting these systematic effects may improve pulsar-timing precision at\nhigher observing frequencies, where pulsar timing array projects aim to\ndirectly detect gravitational waves.\n", "  We report on a new source of in-plane anisotropy in nanomagnets due to the\npresence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). This anisotropy depends on\nthe shape of the magnet, and is orthogonal to the demagnetization shape\nanisotropy. This effect originates from the DMI energy reduction due to an\nout-of-plane tilt of the spins at edges oriented perpendicular to the\nmagnetization. Our investigation combining experimental, numerical and\nanalytical results demonstrate that this energy reduction can compensate the\ndemagnetization shape anisotropy energy in magnets of elongated shape, provided\nthat their volumes is small enough and thus that their magnetization is\nquasi-uniform.\n", "  We consider a class of two dimensional dilatonic models, and revisit them\nfrom the perspective of a new set of \"polar type\" variables. These are\nmotivated by recently defined variables within the spherically symmetric sector\nof 4D general relativity. We show that for a large class of dilatonic models,\nincluding the case \\emph{with} matter, one can perform a series of canonical\ntransformations in such a way that the Poisson algebra of the constraints\nbecomes a Lie algebra. Furthermore, we construct Dirac observables and a\nreduced Hamiltonian that accounts for the time evolution of the system. Thus,\nwith our formulation, the systems under consideration are amenable to be\nquantized with loop quantization methods.\n", "  The properties of backward-wave second harmonic meta-reflector operating in\npulse regime are investigated. We show that ratio of the income pulse length to\nthe thickness of the metaslab determines its important operational properties\nwhich are in contrast with those manifested at common second harmonic\ngeneration settings.\n", "  Within a mean field approximation, we study a nontopological soliton solution\nof the Polyakov quark-meson model in the presence of a fermionic vacuum term\nwith two flavors at finite temperature and density. The profile of the\neffective potential exhibits a stable soliton solution below a critical\ntemperature $T\\leq T_{\\chi}^c$ for both the crossover and the first-order phase\ntransitions, and these solutions are calculated here with appropriate boundary\nconditions. However, it is found that only if $T\\leq T^c_d$,the energy of the\nsoliton $M_N$ is less than the energy of the three free constituent quarks\n$3M_q$. As $T> T^c_d$, there is an instant delocalization phase transition from\nhadron matter to quark matter. The phase diagram together with the location of\na critical end point (CEP) has been obtained in $T$ and $\\mu$ plane. We notice\nthat two critical temperatures always satisfy $T^c_d\\leq T_{\\chi}^c$. Finally,\nwe present and compare the result of thermodynamic pressure at zero chemical\npotential with lattice data.\n", "  In this study we present an application which can be accessed via\nwww.excellence-networks.net and which represents networks of scientific\ninstitutions worldwide. The application is based on papers (articles, reviews\nand conference papers) published between 2007 and 2011. It uses (network) data,\non which the SCImago Institutions Ranking is based (Scopus data from Elsevier).\nUsing this data, institutional networks have been estimated with statistical\nmodels (Bayesian multilevel logistic regression, BMLR) for a number of Scopus\nsubject areas. Within single subject areas, we have investigated and visualized\nhow successfully overall an institution (reference institution) has\ncollaborated (compared to all the other institutions in a subject area), and\nwith which other institutions (network institutions) a reference institution\nhas collaborated particularly successfully. The \"best paper rate\"\n(statistically estimated) was used as an indicator for evaluating the\ncollaboration success of an institution. This gives the proportion of highly\ncited papers from an institution, and is considered generally as an indicator\nfor measuring impact in bibliometrics.\n", "  In high-superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\\rm c}$) iron-based\nsuperconductors, interband sign reversal ($s_{\\rm \\pm}$) and sign preserving\n($s_{\\rm ++}$) $s$-wave superconducting states have been primarily discussed as\nthe plausible superconducting mechanism. We study Co impurity scattering\neffects on the superconductivity in order to achieve an important clue on the\npairing mechanism using single crystal Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Se and depict a phase\ndiagram of a FeSe system. Both superconductivity and structural transition /\norbital order are suppressed by the Co replacement on the Fe sites and\ndisappear above $x$ = 0.036. These correlated suppressions represent a common\nbackground physics behind these physical phenomena in the multiband Fermi\nsurfaces of FeSe. By comparing experimental data and theories so far proposed,\nthe suppression of $T_{\\rm c}$ against the residual resistivity is shown to be\nmuch weaker than that predicted in the case of a general sign reversal and a\nfull gap $s_{\\pm}$ models. The origin of the superconducting paring in FeSe is\ndiscussed in terms of its multiband electronic structure.\n", "  A closed-form expression for a lower bound on the per soliton capacity of the\nnonlinear optical fibre channel in the presence of (optical) amplifier\nspontaneous emission (ASE) noise is derived. This bound is based on a\nnon-Gaussian conditional probability density function for the soliton amplitude\njitter induced by the ASE noise and is proven to grow logarithmically as the\nsignal-to-noise ratio increases.\n", "  We show by atomistic simulations that, in the thermodynamic limit, the\nin-plane elastic moduli of graphene at finite temperature vanish with system\nsize $ L $ as a power law $ ~ L^{-\\eta_u} $ with $ \\eta_u \\simeq 0.325 $, in\nagreement with the membrane theory. Our simulations clearly reveal the size and\nstrain dependence of graphene's elastic moduli, allowing comparison to\nexperimental data. Although the recently measured difference of a factor 2\nbetween the asymptotic value of the Young modulus for tensilely strained\nsystems and the value from {\\it ab initio} calculations remains unsolved, our\nresults do explain the experimentally observed increase of more than a factor 2\nfor a tensile strain of only a few permille. We also discuss the scaling of the\nPoisson ratio, for which our simulations disagree with the predictions of the\nself-consistent screening approximation.\n", "  We construct a 2+1 dimensional model that sustains superconductivity at all\ntemperatures. This is achieved by introducing a Chern Simons mixing term\nbetween two Abelian gauge fields A and Z. The superfluid is described by a\ncomplex scalar charged under Z, whereas a sufficiently strong magnetic field of\nA forces the superconducting condensate to form at all temperatures. In fact,\nat finite temperature, the theory exhibits Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase\ntransition due to proliferation of topological vortices admitted by our\nconstruction. However, the critical temperature is proportional to the magnetic\nfield of A, and thus, the phase transition can be postponed to high\ntemperatures by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. This model can\nbe a step towards realizing the long sought room temperature superconductivity.\n", "  Technical means for identifying when tampering occurs is a critical part of\nmany containment and surveillance technologies. Conventional fiber optic seals\nprovide methods for monitoring enclosed inventories, but they are vulnerable to\nspoofing attacks based on classical physics. We address these vulnerabilities\nwith the development of a quantum seal that offers the ability to detect the\nintercept-resend attack using quantum integrity verification. Our approach\nrepresents an application of entanglement to provide guarantees in the\nauthenticity of the seal state by verifying it was transmitted coherently. We\nimplement these ideas using polarization-entangled photon pairs that are\nverified after passing through a fiber-optic channel testbed. Using binary\ndetection theory, we find the probability of detecting inauthentic signals is\ngreater than 0.9999 with a false alarm chance of $10^{-9}$ for a 10 second\nsampling interval. In addition, we show how the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect\nconcurrently provides a tight bound on redirection attack, in which tampering\nmodifies the shape of the seal. Our measurements limit the tolerable path\nlength change to sub-millimeter disturbances. These tamper-indicating features\nof the quantum seal offer unprecedented security for unattended monitoring\nsystems.\n", "  This work reports on the detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission coincident with\nthe supernova remnant (SNR) SNR G5.7-0.1 using data collected by the Large Area\nTelescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The SNR is believed to be\ninteracting with molecular clouds, based on 1720 MHz hydroxyl (OH) maser\nemission observations in its direction. This interaction is expected to provide\ntargets for the production of $\\gamma$-ray emission from $\\pi^0$-decay. A\n$\\gamma$-ray source was observed in the direction of SNR G5.7-0.1, positioned\nnearby the bright $\\gamma$-ray source SNR W28. We model the emission from radio\nto $\\gamma$-ray energies using a one-zone model. Following consideration of\nboth $\\pi^0$-decay and leptonically dominated emission scenarios for the\nMeV-TeV source, we conclude that a considerable component of the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission must originate from the $\\pi^0$-decay channel. Finally, constraints\nwere placed on the reported ambiguity of the SNR distance through X-ray column\ndensity measurements made using XMM-Newton observations. We conclude SNR\nG5.7-0.1 is a significant $\\gamma$-ray source positioned at a distance of $\\sim\n3$ kpc with luminosity in the 0.1--100 GeV range of $L_{\\gamma} \\approx 7.4\n\\times 10^{34}$ erg/s.\n", "  Supermassive black holes (SMBH) of size $10^{6-10}M_{\\odot}$ are common in\nthe Universe and they define the center of the galaxies. A galaxy and the SMBH\nare generally thought to have co-evolved. However, the SMBH cannot evolve so\nfast as commonly observed even at redshift $z>6$. Therefore SMBH must form\nfirst before galaxy. Our goal is to clarify how this mature SMBH forms galaxy.\nFurthermore we clarify the mechanism how the SMBH designs variety of structures\nof galaxies. We explore a natural hypothesis that the SMBH has been formed\nmature at $z\\approx10$ before stars and galaxies. The SMBH forms energetic jets\nand outflows which trigger massive star formation in the ambient gas. They\neventually construct globular clusters and classical bulge as well as the body\nof elliptical galaxies. We propose simple models which implement these\nprocesses along with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM-model. We point out that the\nglobular clusters and classical bulges have a common origin but are in\ndifferent phases. The same is true for the elliptical and spiral galaxies.\nPhysics behind these phase division is the runaway star formation process with\nstrong feedback to SMBH. This is similar to the forest-fire model that displays\nself-organized criticality. Finally we speculate several observational\npredictions that may help to test the present arguments.\n", "  Considering the cubic theory of gravity which has been constructed in\n\\cite{myers}, we study the existence of Lifshitz and hyper scaling violating\nLifshitz solutions. We firstly extend the black hole solution of \\cite{myers}\nand find that such extended solutions are valid for any value of dynamical\nexponent $z$.\n  Next, we examine the existence of the AdS black hole solution with non-zero\nhyperscaling-violating exponent $\\theta$ and general dynamical exponent $z$. We\nfind that the solutions do exist only for $\\theta=0,3$ in 4 dimension and\n$\\theta=0,4$ in 5 dimension. In particular, when $\\theta=3(4)$ in $4(5)$\ndimension, we have Lifshitz and Schwarzschild-AdS black hole solution solution\nfor $z=\\{0,1\\}$.\n", "  After the study of the preclusion of exotic meson states in large-$N_c$ limit\nQCD, combining Weinberg's opposite proposal, we get different counting orders\nfor a tetraquark operator to create or destroy an one-tetraquark state.\nMeanwhile, by comparing tetraquark operator with the mesonic and gluonic\noperators, we find that tetraquark operators are similar with mesonic and\ngluonic operators in the counting. Furthermore, we find a mixing of different\nkinds of operators.\n", "  We examine the real space renormalization group method of finding\n\\textit{excited eigenstate} (RSRG-X) of the XX spin-1/2 chain, from\nentanglement perspectives. Eigenmodes of entanglement Hamiltonian, especially\nthe maximally entangled mode and corresponding entanglement energies are\nstudied and compared with predictions of RSRG-X. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate the accuracy of the RSRG-X method in the strong disorder limit, and\nquantify its error when applied to weak disorder regime. Overall, our results\nvalidate the RSRG-X method qualitatively, but also show that its accuracy\ndecreases with increasing temperature.\n", "  It is shown that the free motion of massive particles moving in static\nspacetimes are given by the geodesics of an energy-dependent Riemannian metric\non the spatial sections analogous to Jacobi's metric in classical dynamics. In\nthe massless limit Jacobi's metric coincides with the energy independent Fermat\nor optical metric. For stationary metrics, it is known that the motion of\nmassless particles is given by the geodesics of an energy independent\nFinslerian metric of Randers type. The motion of massive particles is governed\nby neither a Riemannian nor a Finslerian metric. The properies of the Jacobi\nmetric for massive particles moving outside the horizon of a Schwarschild black\nhole are described. By constrast with the massless case, the Gaussian curvature\nof the equatorial sections is not always negative.\n", "  The magnetic structure and phase diagram of the layered ferromagnetic\ncompound Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ has been investigated by a combination of synthesis,\nx-ray and neutron diffraction, high resolution microscopy, and magnetization\nmeasurements. Single crystals were synthesized by self-flux reactions, and\nsingle crystal neutron diffraction finds ferromagnetic order with moments of\n1.11(5)$\\mu_B$/Fe aligned along the $c$-axis at 4K. These flux-grown crystals\nhave a lower Curie temperature $T_{\\textrm{c}}\\approx$150K compared to crystals\npreviously grown by vapor transport ($T_{\\textrm{c}}$=220K). The difference is\na reduced Fe content in the flux grown crystals, as illustrated by the behavior\nobserved in a series of polycrystalline samples. As Fe-content decreases, so\ndoes the Curie temperature, magnetic anisotropy, and net magnetization. In\naddition, Hall effect and thermoelectric measurements on flux-grown crystals\nsuggest multiple carrier types contribute to electrical transport in\nFe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ and structurally-similar Ni$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$.\n", "  With the physical Higgs mass the Standard Model symmetry restoration phase\ntransition is a smooth cross-over. We study the thermodynamics of the\ncross-over using numerical lattice Monte Carlo simulations of an effective\nSU(2) X U(1) gauge + Higgs theory, significantly improving on previously\npublished results. We measure the Higgs field expectation value, thermodynamic\nquantities like pressure, energy density, speed of sound and heat capacity, and\nscreening masses associated with the Higgs and Z fields. While the cross-over\nis smooth, it is very well defined with a width of only approximately 5 GeV. We\nmeasure the cross-over temperature from the maximum of the susceptibility of\nthe Higgs condensate, with the result $T_c = 159.5 \\pm 1.5$ GeV. Outside of the\nnarrow cross-over region the perturbative results agree well with\nnon-perturbative ones.\n", "  A weak-rate library aimed at investigating the sensitivity of astrophysical\nenvironments to variations of electron-capture rates on medium-heavy nuclei has\nbeen developed. With this library, the sensitivity of the core-collapse and\nearly post-bounce phases of core-collapse supernovae to nuclear\nelectron-capture is examined by systematically and statistically varying\nelectron-capture rates of individual nuclei. The rates are adjusted by factors\nconsistent with uncertainties indicated by comparing theoretical rates to those\ndeduced from charge-exchange and $\\beta$-decay measurements. To ensure a model\nindependent assessment, sensitivity studies across a comprehensive set of\nprogenitors and equations of state are performed. In our systematic study, we\nfind a +16/-4 % range in the mass of the inner-core at the time of shock\nformation and a $\\pm$20% range of peak {\\nu}e-luminosity during the\ndeleptonization burst. These ranges are each five times as large as those seen\nfrom a separate progenitor study in which we evaluated the sensitivity of these\nparameters to 32 presupernova stellar models. It is also found that the\nsimulations are more sensitive to a reduction in the electron-capture rates\nthan an enhancement, and in particular to the reduction in the rates for\nneutron-rich nuclei near the N = 50 closed neutron-shell. As measurements for\nmedium-heavy (A > 65) and neutron-rich nuclei are sparse, and because accurate\ntheoretical models which account for nuclear structure considerations on the\nindividual nucleus level are not readily available, rates for these nuclei may\nbe overestimated. If more accurate estimates confirm this, results from this\nstudy indicate that significant changes to the core-collapse trajectory can be\nexpected. For this reason, experimental and theoretical efforts should focus in\nthis region of the nuclear chart.\n", "  Large top quark flavor changing through neutral currents is expected by many\nextensions of the standard model. Direct and indirect searches for flavor\nchanging neutral currents (FCNC) in the top quark decays to an up type quark\n(up,charm) and a Higgs boson are presented. We probe the observability of the\ntop-Higgs FCNC couplings through the process e$^-$e$^+ \\rightarrow t\n(\\rightarrow \\ell \\nu_{\\ell} b) \\,\\, \\bar{t} (\\rightarrow q H)$, where $\\ell$ =\ne, $\\mu$ and $q$ reflects up and charm quarks. It is shown that the branching\nratio $Br(t\\rightarrow qH)$ can be probed down to $1.12\\times 10^{-3}$ at\n$95\\%$ C.L. at the center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV with the integrated\nluminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$. We also update the constraint on the top-Higgs\nFCNC coupling using the electroweak precision observables related to\n$Z\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ decay.\n", "  En este trabajo, se obtiene una expresi\\'on num\\'erica para calcular el\nespectro de emisi\\'on de un sistema microcavidad-punto cu\\'antico usando una\nteor\\'ia de campo medio en el formalismo de la matriz densidad. El sistema\nmodelado es un micropilar semiconductor que contiene un \\'unico punto\ncu\\'antico en el interior de la microcavidad, este sistema presenta p\\'erdida\nde fotones a trav\\'es de los espejos de la cavidad y bombeo de excitones al\npunto cu\\'antico.

The open system modeled, is a typical semiconductor\nmicropillar that contains a single quantum dot inside a microcavity, this\nsystem presents leakage of photons through cavity mirrors and pumping of\nexcitons to the quantum dot. We obtain a mean field nonlinear master equation\nthat allow us calculate the emission spectrum.\n", "  Predictions are provided for double differential cross sections and\nforward-backward ratios of $D^{0}$ production in $p\\rm Pb$ (forward) and\n$\\rm{Pb}$$p$ (backward) collisions at 5.02~TeV. The effect of nuclear\ncorrections on the ratio of differential cross sections ratios is estimated to\nbe $\\simeq$ (10-30)\\% in the kinematically accessible region of LHCb, and\ninterestingly this ratio is approximately flat with respect to $p_T(D^0)$ due\nto a compensation of shadowing and anti-shadowing effects arising from the\ninput nuclear PDFs. In comparison to $J/\\psi(\\rightarrow\\mu^-\\mu^+)$\nmeasurements which have already been performed with the available data, the\ncross section for $D^{0}(\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+)$ production is expected to be\ntwo-orders of magnitude higher.\n", "  We define new observables sensitive to BFKL dynamics in the context of\nmultijet production at the large hadron collider (LHC). We propose the study of\nthe inclusive production of three jets well separated in rapidity from each\nother, with two of them being very forward. We show that the tagging of a third\njet in the central region of rapidity allows for a very strong test of the BFKL\nformalism. In particular, we have studied two projections on azimuthal angles\nfor the differential cross section which allow for the definition of many\ndifferent observables whose behavior when varying the $p_t$ and rapidity of the\ncentral jet is a distinct signal of BFKL dynamics. In order to reduce the\ntheoretical uncertainties and influence of higher order corrections, we propose\nthe study of ratios of correlation functions of products of cosines of\nazimuthal angle differences among the tagged jets.\n", "  We have measured the reaction of O + H3+ forming OH+ and H2O+. This is one of\nthe key gas-phase astrochemical processes initiating the formation of water\nmolecules in dense molecular clouds. For this work, we have used a novel merged\nfast-beams apparatus which overlaps a beam of H3+ onto a beam of ground-term\nneutral O. Here, we present cross section data for forming OH+ and H2O+ at\nrelative energies from \\approx 3.5 meV to \\approx 15.5 and 0.13 eV,\nrespectively. Measurements were performed for statistically populated O(3PJ) in\nthe ground term reacting with hot H3+ (with an internal temperature of \\approx\n2500-3000 K). From these data, we have derived rate coefficients for\ntranslational temperatures from \\approx 25 K to \\approx 10^5 and 10^3 K,\nrespectively. Using state-of-the-art theoretical methods as a guide, we have\nconverted these results to a thermal rate coefficient for forming either OH+ or\nH2O+, thereby accounting for the temperature dependence of the O fine-structure\nlevels. Our results are in good agreement with two independent flowing\nafterglow measurements at a temperature of \\approx 300 K, and with a\ncorresponding level of H3+ internal excitation. This good agreement strongly\nsuggests that the internal excitation of the H3+ does not play a significant\nrole in this reaction. The Langevin rate coefficient is in reasonable agreement\nwith the experimental results at 10 K but a factor of \\approx 2 larger at 300\nK. The two published classical trajectory studies using quantum mechanical\npotential energy surfaces lie a factor of \\approx 1.5 above our experimental\nresults over this 10-300 K range.\n", "  The lattice dynamics of TiO$_2$ in the rutile crystal structure was studied\nby a combination of thermal diffuse scattering, inelastic x-ray scattering and\ndensity functional perturbation theory. We experimentally confirm the existence\nof an anomalous soft transverse acoustic mode with energy minimum at q = (1/2\n1/2 1/4). The phonon energy landscape of this particular branch is reported and\ncompared to the calculation. The harmonic calculation underestimates the phonon\nenergies but despite this the shape of both the energy landscape and the\nscattering intensities are well reproduced. We find a significant temperature\ndependence in energy of this transverse acoustic mode over an extended region\nin reciprocal space which is in line with a substantially anharmonic mode\npotential-energy surface. The reported low energy branch is quite different\nfrom the ferroelectric mode that softens at the Brillouin zone center and may\nhelp explain anomalous convergence behavior in calculating TiO$_2$ surface\nproperties.\n", "  We consider the D1-D5 CFT near the orbifold point, specifically the\ncomputation of correlators involving twist sector fields using covering surface\ntechniques. As is well known, certain twists introduce spin fields on the\ncover. Here we consider the bosonization of fermions to facilitate computations\ninvolving the spin fields. We find a set of cocycle operators that satisfy\nconstraints coming from various $SU(2)$ symmetries, including the\n$SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry. Using these cocycles, we consider the\ncorrelator of four spin fields on the cover, and show that it is invariant\nunder all of the $SU(2)$ symmetries of the theory. We consider the mutual\nlocality of operators, and compute several three-point functions. These\ncomputations lead us to a notion of radial ordering on the cover that is\ninherited from the original computation before lifting. Further, we note that\nsumming over orbifold images sets certain branch-cut ambiguous correlators to\nzero.\n", "  Axions constitute a well-motivated dark matter candidate, and if PQ symmetry\nbreaking occurred after inflation, it should be possible to make a clean\nprediction for the relation between the axion mass and the axion dark matter\ndensity. We show that axion (or other global) string networks in 3D have a\nnetwork density that depends logarithmically on the string separation-to-core\nratio. This logarithm would be about 10 times larger in axion cosmology than\nwhat we can achieve in numerical simulations. We simulate axion production in\nthe early Universe, finding that, for the separation-to-core ratios we can\nachieve, the changing density of the network has little impact on the axion\nproduction efficiency.\n", "  Recently, a phase transition has been discovered in the network community\ndetection problem below which no algorithm can tell which nodes belong to which\ncommunities with success any better than a random guess. This result has,\nhowever, so far been limited to the case where the communities have the same\nsize or the same average degree. Here we consider the case where the sizes or\naverage degrees are different. This asymmetry allows us to assign nodes to\ncommunities with better-than- random success by examining their local\nneighborhoods. Using the cavity method, we show that this removes the\ndetectability transition completely for networks with four groups or fewer,\nwhile for more than four groups the transition persists up to a critical amount\nof asymmetry but not beyond. The critical point in the latter case coincides\nwith the point at which local information percolates, causing a global\ntransition from a less-accurate solution to a more-accurate one.\n", "  We suggest and demonstrate a protocol which suppresses dephasing due to the\nlow-frequency noise by qubit motion, i.e., transfer of the logical qubit of\ninformation in a system of $n \\geq 2$ physical qubits. The protocol requires\nonly the nearest-neighbor coupling and is applicable to different qubit\nstructures. We further analyze its effectiveness against noises with arbitrary\ncorrelations. Our analysis, together with experiments using up to three\nsuperconducting qubits, shows that for the realistic uncorrelated noises, qubit\nmotion increases the dephasing time of the logical qubit as $\\sqrt{n}$. In\ngeneral, the protocol provides a diagnostic tool to measure the noise\ncorrelations.\n", "  Context. During the last 30 years the surface of Pluto has been\ncharacterized, and its variability has been monitored, through continuous\nnear-infrared spectroscopic observations. But in the visible range only few\ndata are available. Aims. The aim of this work is to define the Pluto's\nrelative reflectance in the visible range to characterize the different\ncomponents of its surface, and to provide ground based observations in support\nof the New Horizons mission. Methods. We observed Pluto on six nights between\nMay and July 2014, with the imager/spectrograph ACAM at the William Herschel\nTelescope (La Palma, Spain). The six spectra obtained cover a whole rotation of\nPluto (Prot = 6.4 days). For all the spectra we computed the spectral slope and\nthe depth of the absorption bands of methane ice between 0.62 and 0.90 $\\mu$m.\nTo search for shifts of the center of the methane bands, associated with\ndilution of CH4 in N2, we compared the bands with reflectances of pure methane\nice. Results. All the new spectra show the methane ice absorption bands between\n0.62 and 0.90 $\\mu$m. The computation of the depth of the band at 0.62 $\\mu$m\nin the new spectra of Pluto, and in the spectra of Makemake and Eris from the\nliterature, allowed us to estimate the Lambert coefficient at this wavelength,\nat a temperature of 30 K and 40 K, never measured before. All the detected\nbands are blue shifted, with minimum shifts in correspondence with the regions\nwhere the abundance of methane is higher. This could be indicative of a\ndilution of CH4:N2 more saturated in CH4. The longitudinal and secular\nvariations of the parameters measured in the spectra are in accordance with\nresults previously reported in the literature and with the distribution of the\ndark and bright material that show the Pluto's albedo maps from New Horizons.\n", "  Classical thermodynamics is unrivalled in its range of applications and\nrelevance to everyday life. It enables a description of complex systems, made\nup of microscopic particles, in terms of a small number of macroscopic\nquantities, such as work and entropy. As systems get ever smaller, fluctuations\nof these quantities become increasingly relevant, prompting the development of\nstochastic thermodynamics. Recently we have seen a surge of interest in\nexploring the quantum regime, where the origin of fluctuations is quantum\nrather than thermal. Many questions, such as the role of entanglement and the\nemergence of thermalisation, lie wide open. Answering these questions may lead\nto the development of quantum heat engines and refrigerators, as well as to\nvitally needed simple descriptions of quantum many-body systems.\n", "  In this work we propose the Amor-type asteroid 2009 WN25 as the likely\nprogenitor of the November i-Draconids (NID, IAU#392), a recently detected weak\nannual meteoroid stream. We first describe our recovery and follow-up effort to\nobtain timely ground based astrometry with large aperture telescopes, and\nensure that 2009 WN25 would not become lost. We then discuss the possible\nparent-stream association, using its updated orbit to model the ejection of\ndust particles from the surface of the parent body and match the observed\nproperties of the stream.\n", "  We propose a versatile strategy for numerical renormalization group solution\nof general channel-mixing Kondo and Anderson models beyond previous reach,\nopening the door toward broad applications in protocol non-perturbative\nmachineries, such as dynamical cluster approximation and cluster dynamical mean\nfield theory, for strongly correlated electron systems. We illustrate the\nstrategy by investigating the quantum phase transitions in two quantum impurity\nmodels with cases untouched before.\n", "  We use shear reversal simulations to explore the rheology of dense,\nnon-Brownian suspensions, resolving lubrication forces between neighbouring\nparticles and modelling particle surface contacts. The transient stress\nresponse to an abrupt reversal of the direction of shear shows\nrate-independent, nonmonotonic behaviour, capturing the salient features of the\ncorresponding classical experiments. Based on analyses of the hydrodynamic and\nparticle contact stresses and related contact networks, we demonstrate distinct\nresponses at small and large strains, associated with contact breakage and\nstructural re-orientation, respectively, emphasising the importance of particle\ncontacts. Consequently, the hydrodynamic and contact stresses evolve over\ndisparate strain scales and with opposite trends, resulting in nonmonotonic\nbehaviour when combined. We further elucidate the roles of particle roughness\nand repulsion in determining the microstructure and hence the stress response\nat each scale.\n", "  In the general bipartite quantum system $m \\otimes n$, Wang \\emph{et al.}\n[Y.-L Wang \\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{92}, 032313 (2015)] presented\n$3(m+n)-9$ orthogonal product states which cannot be distinguished by local\noperations and classical communication (LOCC). In this paper, we aim to\nconstruct less locally indistinguishable orthogonal product states in $m\\otimes\nn $. First, in $3\\otimes n (3< n)$ quantum system, we construct $3n-2$ locally\nindistinguishable orthogonal product states which are not unextendible product\nbases. Then, for $m\\otimes n (4\\leq m\\leq n)$, we present $3n+m-4$ orthogonal\nproduct states which cannot be perfectly distinguished by LOCC. Finally, in the\ngeneral bipartite quantum system $m\\otimes n(3\\leq m\\leq n)$, we show a smaller\nset with $2n-1$ orthogonal product states and prove that these states are LOCC\nindistinguishable using a very simple but quite effective method. All of the\nabove results demonstrate the phenomenon of nonlocality without entanglement.\n", "  Magnetic excitations in the strong-leg quantum spin ladder compound\n(C$_7$H$_{10}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ (known as DIMPY) in the field-induced\nTomonaga-Luttinger spin liquid phase are studied by means of high-field\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The presence of a gapped ESR mode\nwith unusual non-linear frequency-field dependence is revealed experimentally.\nUsing a combination of analytic and exact diagonalization methods, we compute\nthe dynamical structure factor and identify this mode with longitudinal\nexcitations in the antisymmetric channel. We argue that these excitations\nconstitute a fingerprint of the spin dynamics in a strong-leg spin-1/2\nHeisenberg antiferromagnetic ladder and owe its ESR observability to the\nuniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n", "  Projection of Bloch states obtained from quantum-mechanical calculations onto\natomic orbitals is the fastest scheme to construct ab-initio tight-binding\nHamiltonian matrices. However, the presence of spurious states and unphysical\nhybridizations of the tight-binding eigenstates has hindered the applicability\nof this construction. Here we demonstrate that those spurious effects are due\nto the inclusion of Bloch states with low projectability. The mechanism for the\nformation of those effects is derived analytically. We present an improved\nscheme for the removal of the spurious states which results in an efficient\nscheme for the construction of highly accurate ab-initio tight-binding\nHamiltonians.\n", "  We determine the Hubble expansion and the general cosmic perturbations\nequations for a general system consisting of self-conserved matter and\nself-conserved dark energy (DE). While at the background level the two\ncomponents are non-interacting, they do interact at the perturbations level. We\nshow that the coupled system of matter and DE perturbations can be transformed\ninto a single, third order, matter perturbation equation, which reduces to the\n(derivative of the) standard one in the case that the DE is just a cosmological\nconstant. As a nontrivial application we analyze a class of dynamical models\nwhose DE density $\\rho_D$ consists of a constant term, $C_0$, and a series of\npowers of the Hubble rate. These models were previously analyzed from the point\nof view of dynamical vacuum models, but here we treat them as self-conserved DE\nmodels with a dynamical equation of state. We fit them to the wealth of\nexpansion history and linear structure formation data and compare the obtained\nfit quality with that of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. Those with $C_0=0$\ninclude the so-called \"entropic-force\" and \"QCD-ghost\" DE models, as well as\nthe pure linear model $\\rho_D\\sim H$, all of which appear strongly disfavored.\nThe models with $C_0\\neq 0$, in contrast, emerge as promising dynamical DE\ncandidates whose phenomenological performance is highly competitive with the\nrigid $\\Lambda$-term inherent to the $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Heterogeneous adoption thresholds exist widely in social contagions, but were\nalways neglected in previous studies. We first propose a non-Markovian\nspreading threshold model with general adoption threshold distribution. In\norder to understand the effects of heterogeneous adoption thresholds\nquantitatively, an edge-based compartmental theory is developed for the\nproposed model. We use a binary spreading threshold model as a specific\nexample, in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e.,\nactivists) while the remaining ones hold a relatively high adoption threshold\n(i.e., bigots), to demonstrate that heterogeneous adoption thresholds markedly\naffect the final adoption size and phase transition. Interestingly, the\nfirst-order, second-order and hybrid phase transitions can be found in the\nsystem. More importantly, there are two different kinds of crossover phenomena\nin phase transition for distinct values of bigots' adoption threshold: a change\nfrom first-order or hybrid phase transition to the second-order phase\ntransition. The theoretical predictions based on the suggested theory agree\nvery well with the results of numerical simulations.\n", "  A long-lived and multimode quantum memory is a key component needed for the\ndevelopment of quantum communication. Here we present temporally multiplexed\nstorage of 5 photonic polarization qubits encoded onto weak coherent states in\na rare-earth-ion doped crystal. Using spin refocusing techniques we can\npreserve the qubits for more than half a millisecond. The temporal multiplexing\nallows us to increase the effective rate of the experiment by a factor of 5,\nwhich emphasizes the importance of multimode storage for quantum communication.\nThe fidelity upon retrieval is higher than the maximum classical fidelity\nachievable with qubits encoded onto single photons and we show that the memory\nfidelity is mainly limited by the memory signal-to-noise ratio. These results\nshow the viability and versatility of long-lived, multimode quantum memories\nbased on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.\n", "  Using observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we\ninvestigate the physical conditions of star-forming regions in $z\\sim2.3$\ngalaxies, specifically the electron density and ionization state. From\nmeasurements of the [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda$3726,3729 and [S\nII]$\\lambda\\lambda$6716,6731 doublets, we find a median electron density of\n$\\sim250$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\\sim2.3$, an increase of an order of magnitude\ncompared to measurements of galaxies at $z\\sim0$. While $z\\sim2.3$ galaxies are\noffset towards significantly higher O$_{32}$ values relative to local galaxies\nat fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similar\ndistribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in the\nO$_{32}$ vs. R$_{23}$ and O3N2 diagrams. Based on these results, we propose\nthat $z\\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter as\nlocal galaxies at fixed metallicity. In combination with simple photoionization\nmodels, the position of local and $z\\sim2.3$ galaxies in excitation diagrams\nsuggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizing\nspectrum at fixed metallicity from $z\\sim0$ to $z\\sim2.3$. We find that\n$z\\sim2.3$ galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxies\nin emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and\nsulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [N II]$\\lambda$6584.\nWe conclude that the offset of $z\\sim2.3$ galaxies from the local star-forming\nsequence in the [N II] BPT diagram is primarily driven by elevated N/O at fixed\nO/H compared to local galaxies. These results suggest that the local gas-phase\nand stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at\n$z\\sim0$ and $z\\sim2$.\n", "  The exploration of topological states is of significant fundamental and\npractical importance in contemporary condensed matter physics, for which the\nextension to two-dimensional (2D) organometallic systems is particularly\nattractive. Using first-principles calculations, we show that a 2D hexagonal\ntriphenyl-lead lattice composed of only main group elements is susceptible to a\nmagnetic instability, characterized by a considerably more stable\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating state rather than the topologically\nnontrivial quantum spin Hall state proposed recently. Even though this AFM\nphase is topologically trivial, it possesses an intricate emergent degree of\nfreedom, defined by the product of spin and valley indices, leading to Berry\ncurvature-induced spin and valley currents under electron or hole doping.\nFurthermore, such a trivial band insulator can be tuned into a topologically\nnontrivial matter by the application of an out-of-plane electric field, which\ndestroys the AFM order, favoring instead ferrimagnetic spin ordering and a\nquantum anomalous Hall state with a non-zero topological invariant. These\nfindings further enrich our understanding of 2D hexagonal organometallic\nlattices for potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics.\n", "  A new high precision measurement of the reaction pp -> pK+Lambda at a beam\nmomentum of 2.95 GeV/c with more than 200,000 analyzed events allows a detailed\nanalysis of differential observables and their inter-dependencies. Correlations\nof the angular distributions with momenta are examined. The invariant mass\ndistributions are compared for different regions in the Dalitz plots. The cusp\nstructure at the N Sigma threshold is described with the Flatt\\'e formalism and\nits variation in the Dalitz plot is analyzed.\n", "  We have studied the existence of topological Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield\nor self-dual configurations in a Lorentz-violating gauged $O(3)$ nonlinear\nsigma model, where $CPT$-even Lorentz-violating (LV) terms were introduced in\nboth the gauge and $\\sigma $% -field sectors. As happens in the usual gauged\n$\\sigma $ model, purely magnetic self-dual configurations are allowed,\nmaintaining some qualitative features of the standard ones. In a more involved\nconfiguration, Lorentz violation provides new self-dual magnetic solutions\ncarrying an electric field but a null total electric charge. In both cases, the\ntotal energy of the self-dual configurations turns out to be proportional to\nthe topological charge of the model and to the LV parameters introduced in the\n$% \\sigma $ sector. It is shown that the LV terms yield magnetic flux reversion\nas well.\n", "  Solutions of the field equations of theories of gravity which admit distinct\nconformal frame representations can look very different in these frames. We\nshow that Brans class IV solutions describe wormholes in the Jordan frame (in a\ncertain parameter range) but correspond to horizonless geometries in the\nEinstein frame. The reasons for such a change of behaviour under conformal\nmappings are elucidated in general, using Brans IV solutions as an example.\n", "  We discuss the Mass -Radius diagram for static neutron star models obtained\nby the numerical solution of modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in\n$f(R)$ gravity where the Lagrangians $f(R)=R+\\alpha R^2 (1+\\gamma R)$ and\n$f(R)=R^{1+\\epsilon }$ are adopted. Unlike the case of the perturbative\napproach previously reported, the solutions are constrained by the presence of\nan extra degree of freedom, coming from the trace of the field equations. In\nparticular, the stiffness of the equation of state determines an upper limit on\nthe central density $\\rho_c$ above which the the positivity condition of\nenergy-matter tensor trace $T^{\\rm m}=\\rho - 3 p$ holds. In the case of\nquadratic f(R)-gravity, we find higher masses and radii at lower central\ndensities with an inversion of the behavior around a pivoting $\\rho_c$ which\ndepends on the choice of the equation of state. When considering the cubic\ncorrections, we find solutions converging to the required asymptotic behavior\nof flat metric only for $\\gamma < 0$. A similar analysis is performed for\n$f(R)=R^{1+\\epsilon }$ considering $\\epsilon$ as the leading parameter. We work\nstrictly in the Jordan frame in order to consider matter minimally coupled with\nrespect to geometry. This fact allows us to avoid ambiguities that could emerge\nin adopting the Einstein frame.\n", "  We investigate the cores of fossil galaxy groups and clusters (`fossil\nsystems') using archival Chandra data for a sample of 17 fossil systems. We\ndetermined the cool-core fraction for fossils via three observable diagnostics,\nthe central cooling time, cuspiness, and concentration parameter. We quantified\nthe dynamical state of the fossils by the X-ray peak/brightest cluster galaxy\n(BCG), and the X-ray peak/emission weighted centre separations. We studied the\nX-ray emission coincident with the BCG to detect the presence of potential\nthermal coronae. A deprojection analysis was performed for z < 0.05 fossils to\nobtain cooling time and entropy profiles, and to resolve subtle temperature\nstructures. We investigated the Lx-T relation for fossils from the 400d\ncatalogue to see if the scaling relation deviates from that of other groups.\n  Most fossils are identified as cool-core objects via at least two cool-core\ndiagnostics. All fossils have their dominant elliptical galaxy within 50 kpc of\nthe X-ray peak, and most also have the emission weighted centre within that\ndistance. We do not see clear indications of a X-ray corona associated with the\nBCG unlike that has been observed for some other objects. Fossils do not have\nuniversal temperature profiles, with some low-temperature objects lacking\nfeatures that are expected for ostensibly relaxed objects with a cool-core. The\nentropy profiles of the z < 0.05 fossil systems can be well-described by a\npower law model, albeit with indices smaller than 1. The 400d fossils Lx-T\nrelation shows indications of an elevated normalisation with respect to other\ngroups, which seems to persist even after factoring in selection effects.\n", "  In this paper we present the time resolution measurements of the\nLutetium-Yttrium Oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) calorimeter prototype for the Mu2e\nexperiment. The measurements have been performed using the $e^-$ beam of the\nBeam Test Facility (BTF) in Frascati, Italy in the energy range from 100 to 400\nMeV. The calorimeter prototype consisted of twenty five 30x30x130 mm$^3$, LYSO\ncrystals read out by 10x10 mm$^2$ Hamamatsu Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs). The\nenergy dependence of the measured time resolution can be parametrized as\n$\\sigma_{t}(E)=a/\\sqrt{E/\\mathrm{GeV}} \\oplus b$, with the stochastic and\nconstant terms $a=(51\\pm1)$ ps and $b=(10\\pm4)$ ps, respectively. This\ncorresponds to the time resolution of ($162\\pm4$) ps at 100 MeV.\n", "  A recent Chandra observation of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 585 has led\nto the discovery of an extended X-ray jet associated with the high-redshift\nbackground quasar B3 0727+409, a luminous radio source at redshift z=2.5. This\nis one of only few examples of high-redshift X-ray jets known to date. It has a\nclear extension of about 12\", corresponding to a projected length of ~100 kpc,\nwith a possible hot spot located 35\" from the quasar. The archival high\nresolution VLA maps surprisingly reveal no extended jet emission, except for\none knot about 1.4\" from the quasar. The high X-ray to radio luminosity ratio\nfor this source appears consistent with the $\\propto (1+z)^{4}$ amplification\nexpected from the inverse Compton radiative model. This serendipitous discovery\nmay signal the existence of an entire population of similar systems with bright\nX-ray and faint radio jets at high redshift, a selection bias which must be\naccounted for when drawing any conclusions about the redshift evolution of jet\nproperties and indeed about the cosmological evolution of supermassive black\nholes and active galactic nuclei in general.\n", "  We consider a consistent linear effective vielbein matter coupling without\nintroducing the Boulware-Deser ghost in ghost-free massive gravity. This is\nachieved in the partially constrained vielbein formulation. We first introduce\nthe formalism and prove the absence of ghost at all scales. As next we\ninvestigate the cosmological application of this coupling in this new\nformulation. We show that even if the background evolution accords with the\nmetric formulation, the perturbations display important different features in\nthe partially constrained vielbein formulation. We study the cosmological\nperturbations of the two branches of solutions separately. The tensor\nperturbations coincide with those in the metric formulation. Concerning the\nvector and scalar perturbations, the requirement of absence of ghost and\ngradient instabilities yields slightly different allowed parameter space.\n", "  In the adiabatic post-Newtonian (PN) approximation, the phase evolution of\ngravitational waves (GWs) from inspiralling compact binaries in quasicircular\norbits is computed by equating the change in binding energy with the GW flux.\nThis energy balance equation can be solved in different ways, which result in\nmultiple approximants of the PN waveforms. Due to the poor convergence of the\nPN expansion, these approximants tend to differ from each other during the late\ninspiral. Which of these approximants should be chosen as templates for\ndetection and parameter estimation of GWs from inspiraling compact binaries is\nnot obvious. In this paper, we present estimates of the effective higher order\n(beyond the currently available 4PN and 3.5PN) non-spinning terms in the PN\nexpansion of the binding energy and the GW flux that minimize the difference of\nmultiple PN approximants (TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT4, TaylorF2) with\neffective one body waveforms calibrated to numerical relativity (EOBNR). We\nshow that PN approximants constructed using the effective higher order terms\nshow significantly better agreement (as compared to 3.5PN) with the inspiral\npart of the EOBNR. For non-spinning binaries with component masses $m_{1,2} \\in\n[1.4 M_\\odot, 15 M_\\odot]$, most of the approximants have a match\n(faithfulness) of better than 99% with both EOBNR and each other.\n", "  We study W boson scattering in the same- and opposite-sign channels under the\nassumption that no resonances are present in the collider processes\n$pp\\rightarrow l^{\\pm}\\nu_{l}l^{\\pm}\\nu_{l}jj$ and $pp\\rightarrow\nl^{\\pm}\\nu_{l}l^{\\mp}\\nu_{l}jj$, respectively. Basic selection cuts together\nwith a restriction on the combination of the final lepton and jet momenta (the\nWarsaw cut) makes it possible to argue that at the LHC a luminosity of 100\nfb$^{-1}$ and a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}= 13$ TeV will allow to\nconstrain the leading effective lagrangian coefficients at the permil level. We\nalso discuss limits on the other coefficients of the effective lagrangian as\nwell as stronger constraints provided by higher energy and luminosity. We show\nthat the same-sign $WW \\rightarrow WW$ channel suffices in providing the most\nstringent constraints.\n", "  Astrophysical plasmas are subject to a tight connection between magnetic\nfields and the diffusion of particles, which leads to an anisotropic transport\nof energy. Under the fluid assumption, this effect can be reduced to an\nadvection-diffusion equation augmenting the equations of magnetohydrodynamics.\nWe introduce a new method for solving the anisotropic diffusion equation using\nan implicit finite-volume method with adaptive mesh refinement and adaptive\ntime-stepping in the RAMSES code. We apply this numerical solver to the\ndiffusion of cosmic ray energy, and diffusion of heat carried by electrons,\nwhich couple to the ion temperature. We test this new implementation against\nseveral numerical experiments and apply it to a simple supernova explosion with\na uniform magnetic field.\n", "  A possible interplay between the two terms of the general type-II seesaw\nformula is exercised which leads to the generation of nonzero $\\theta_{13}$.\nThe specific flavor structure of the model, guided by the $A_4 \\times Z_4\n\\times Z_3$ symmetry and accompanied with the Standard Model singlet flavons,\nyields the conventional seesaw contribution to produce the tribimaximal lepton\nmixing which is further corrected by the presence of the $SU(2)_L$ triplet\ncontribution to accommodate $\\theta_{13}$. We consider the CP symmetry to be\nspontaneously broken by the complex vacuum expectation value (vev) of a singlet\nfield $S$. While the magnitude of its complex vev is responsible for generating\n$\\theta_{13}$, its phase part induces the low energy CP violating phase\n($\\delta$) and the CP violation required for leptogenesis. Hence the triplet\ncontribution, although sub-dominant, plays crucial role in providing a common\nsource for non-zero $\\theta_{13}$, $\\delta$ and CP-violation required for\nleptogenesis. We find that the recent hint for $\\delta$ close to $3\\pi/2$ is\nsomewhat favored in this set-up though it excludes the exact equality with\n$3\\pi/2$. We also discuss the generation of lepton asymmetry in this scenario.\n", "  The demonstration and use of nonlocality, as defined by Bell's theorem, rely\nstrongly on dealing with non-detection events due to losses and detectors'\ninefficiencies. Otherwise, the so-called detection loophole could be exploited.\nThe only way to avoid this is to have detection efficiencies that are above a\ncertain threshold. We introduce the intermediate assumption of limited\ndetection efficiency, that is, in each run of the experiment, the overall\ndetection efficiency is lower bounded by $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence, in an\nadversarial scenario, the adversaries have arbitrary large but not full control\nover the inefficiencies. We analyse the set of possible correlations that\nfulfill Limited Detection Locality (LDL) and show that they necessarily satisfy\nsome linear Bell-like inequalities. We prove that quantum theory predicts the\nviolation of one of these inequalities for all $\\eta_{min} > 0$. Hence,\nnonlocality can be demonstrated with arbitrarily small limited detection\nefficiencies. We validate this assumption experimentally via a twin-photon\nimplementation in which two users are provided with one photon each out of a\npartially entangled pair. We exploit on each side a passive switch followed by\ntwo measurement devices with fixed settings. Assuming the switches are not\nfully controlled by an adversary, nor by hypothetical local variables, we\nreveal the nonlocality of the established correlations despite a low overall\ndetection efficiency.\n", "  We present a hydrodynamical simulation of the turbulent, magnetized,\nsupernova (SN)-driven interstellar medium (ISM) in a stratified box that\ndynamically couples the injection and evolution of cosmic rays (CRs) and a\nself-consistent evolution of the chemical composition. CRs are treated as a\nrelativistic fluid in the advection-diffusion approximation. The thermodynamic\nevolution of the gas is computed using a chemical network that follows the\nabundances of H+, H, H2, CO, C+, and free electrons and includes\n(self-)shielding of the gas and dust. We find that CRs perceptibly thicken the\ndisk with the heights of 90% (70%) enclosed mass reaching ~1.5 kpc (~0.2 kpc).\nThe simulations indicate that CRs alone can launch and sustain strong outflows\nof atomic and ionized gas with mass loading factors of order unity, even in\nsolar neighborhood conditions and with a CR energy injection per SN of 10^50\nerg, 10% of the fiducial thermal energy of an SN. The CR-driven outflows have\nmoderate launching velocities close to the midplane (~100 km/s) and are denser\n(\\rho~1e-24 - 1e-26 g/cm^3), smoother, and colder than the (thermal) SN-driven\nwinds. The simulations support the importance of CRs for setting the vertical\nstructure of the disk as well as the driving of winds.\n", "  In a previous paper [Blado G, Owens C, and Meyers V 2014 Quantum Wells and\nthe Generalized Uncertainty Principle Eur. J. Phys. 35 065011], we showed that\nquantum gravity effects can be discussed with only a background in\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level by looking at the\neffect of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) on the finite and\ninfinite square wells. In this paper, we derive the GUP corrections to the\ntunneling probability of simple quantum mechanical systems which are accessible\nto undergraduates (alpha decay, simple models of quantum cosmogenesis and\ngravitational tunneling radiation) and which employ the WKB approximation, a\ntopic discussed in undergraduate quantum mechanics classes. It is shown that\nthe GUP correction increases the tunneling probability in each of the examples\ndiscussed.\n", "  We consider lepton flavor violating Higgs decay, specifically $h \\to\n\\mu\\tau$, in a leptoquark model. We introduce two scalar leptoquarks with the\n$SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ quantum numbers, $(3,2,7/6)$ and\n$(3,2,1/6)$, which do not generate the proton decay within renormalizable\nlevel. They can mix with each other by interactions with the standard model\nHiggs. The constraint from the charged lepton flavor violating process,\n$\\tau^{-} \\to \\mu^{-} \\gamma$, is very strong when only one leptoquark\ncontribution is considered. However, we demonstrate that significant\ncancellation is possible between the two leptoquark contributions. We show that\nwe can explain the CMS (ATLAS) excess in $h \\to \\mu \\tau$. We also show that\nmuon $(g-2)$ anomaly can also be accommodated.\n", "  We analyze general properties of the perturbation expansion for\ntwo-dimensional quantum critical metals with singular forward scattering, such\nas metals at an Ising nematic quantum critical point and metals coupled to a\nU(1) gauge field. We derive asymptotic properties of fermion loops appearing as\nsubdiagrams of the contributing Feynman diagrams -- for large and small\nmomenta. Substantial cancellations are found in important scaling limits, which\nreduce the degree of divergence of Feynman diagrams with boson legs.\nImplementing these cancellations we obtain improved power-counting estimates\nthat yield the true degree of divergence. In particular, we find that\nperturbative contributions to the boson self-energy are generally ultraviolet\nconvergent for a dynamical critical exponent $z<3$, and divergent beyond\nthree-loop order for $z \\geq 3$.\n", "  The four-lepton ($4\\ell$, $\\ell = e, \\mu$) production cross section is\nmeasured in the mass range from 80 to 1000 GeV using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data in\n$pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC. The $4\\ell$ events are produced in the decays of resonant $Z$ and Higgs\nbosons and the non-resonant $ZZ$ continuum originating from $q\\bar q$, $gg$,\nand $qg$ initial states. A total of 476 signal candidate events are observed\nwith a background expectation of $26.2 \\pm 3.6$ events, enabling the\nmeasurement of the integrated cross section and the differential cross section\nas a function of the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the four-lepton\nsystem.\n  In the mass range above $180$ GeV, assuming the theoretical constraint on the\n$q\\bar q$ production cross section calculated with perturbative NNLO QCD and\nNLO electroweak corrections, the signal strength of the gluon-fusion component\nrelative to its leading-order prediction is determined to be $\\mu_{gg}=2.4 \\pm\n1.0 (stat.) \\pm 0.5 (syst.)\\pm 0.8 (theory)$.\n", "  We consider a two-component Fermi gas with attractive interactions on a\nsquare optical lattice, and study the interplay of Zeeman field, spin-orbit\ncoupling and next-nearest-neighbor hopping on the ground-state phase diagrams\nin the entire BCS-BEC evolution. In particular, we first classify and\ndistinguish all possible superfluid phases by the momentum-space topology of\ntheir zero-energy quasiparticle/quasihole excitations, and then numerically\nestablish a plethora of quantum phase transitions in between. These transitions\nare further signalled and evidenced by the changes in the corresponding\ntopological invariant of the system, \\textit{i.e.}, its Chern number. Lastly,\nwe find that the superfluid phase exhibits a reentrant structure, separated by\na fingering normal phase, the origin of which is traced back to the changes in\nthe single-particle density of states.\n", "  In the recent times, test of Lorentz Invariance has been used as a means to\nprobe theories of physics beyond the standard model. We describe a simple way\nof utilizing the polarimeters, which are a critical beam instrument at\nprecision and intensity frontier nuclear physics labs such as the erstwhile\nStanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and Jefferson Lab (JLab), to\nconstrain the dependence of vacuum dispersion with the energy of the photons\nand its direction of propagation at unprecedented level of precision. We obtain\na limit of minimal Standard Model extension (MSME) parameters:\n$\\sqrt{\\kappa_X^2 + \\kappa_Y^2} < 4.6 \\times 10^{-10}$ and $\\sqrt{\\left(\n2c_{TX} - (\\tilde{\\kappa}_{0^+}^{YZ} \\right)^2 + \\left( 2c_{TY} -\n(\\tilde{\\kappa}_{0^+}^{ZX} \\right)^2} < 4.6 \\times 10^{-10}$. We also obtain a\nleading constraint for the refractive index of free space $n = 1 +\n(2.44\\times10^{-9} \\pm 6.82\\times 10^{-9})$.\n", "  We present far-infrared spectral line observations of five galaxies from the\nLITTLE THINGS sample: DDO 69, DDO 70, DDO 75, DDO 155, and WLM. While most\nstudies of dwarfs focus on bright systems or starbursts due to observational\nconstraints, our data extend the observed parameter space into the regime of\nlow surface brightness dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and moderate star\nformation rates. Our targets were observed with Herschel at the [CII] 158um,\n[OI] 63um, [OIII] 88um, and NII 122um emission lines using the PACS\nSpectrometer. These high-resolution maps allow us for the first time to study\nthe far-infrared properties of these systems on the scales of larger\nstar-forming complexes. The spatial resolution in our maps, in combination with\nstar formation tracers, allows us to identify separate PDRs in some of the\nregions we observed. Our systems have widespread [CII] emission that is bright\nrelative to continuum, averaging near 0.5% of the total infrared budget -\nhigher than in solar-metallicity galaxies of other types. [NII] is weak,\nsuggesting that the [CII] emission in our galaxies comes mostly from PDRs\ninstead of the diffuse ionized ISM. These systems exhibit efficient cooling at\nlow dust temperatures, as shown by ([OI]+[CII])/TIR in relation to 60um/100um,\nand low [OI]/[CII] ratios which indicate that [CII] is the dominant coolant of\nthe ISM. We observe [OIII]/[CII] ratios in our galaxies that are lower than\nthose published for other dwarfs, but similar to levels noted in spirals.\n", "  Atoms and molecules can become ionized during the scattering of a slow, heavy\nparticle off a bound electron. Such an interaction involving leptophilic weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs) is a promising possible explanation for\nthe anomalous 9 sigma annual modulation in the DAMA dark matter direct\ndetection experiment [R. Bernabei et al., Eur. Phys. J. C 73, 2648 (2013)]. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the Born approximation for such an interaction\nby showing its equivalence to the semiclassical adiabatic treatment of atomic\nionization by slow-moving WIMPs. Conventional wisdom has it that the ionization\nprobability for such a process should be exponentially small. We show, however,\nthat due to nonanalytic, cusp-like behaviour of Coulomb functions close to the\nnucleus this suppression is removed, leading to an effective atomic structure\nenhancement. Crucially, we also show that electron relativistic effects\nactually give the dominant contribution to such a process, enhancing the\ndifferential cross section by up to 1000 times.\n", "  A method for extracting finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems from a class\nof 2+1 Hamiltonian mean field theories is presented. These theories possess\nnoncanonical Poisson brackets, which normally resist Hamiltonian truncation,\nbut a process of beatification by coordinate transformation near a reference\nstate is described in order to perturbatively overcome this difficulty. Two\nexamples of four-wave truncation of Euler's equation for scalar vortex dynamics\nare given and compared: one a direct non-Hamiltonian truncation of the\nequations of motion, the other obtained by beatifying the Poisson bracket and\nthen truncating.\n", "  We demonstrate a velocity selection scheme that mitigates suppression of\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) by Doppler shifts for low--high\nEIT probe--coupling wavelength ordering. An optical pumping beam\ncounter-propagating with the EIT probe beam transfers atoms between hyperfine\nstates in a velocity selective fashion. Measurement of the transmitted probe\nbeam synchronous with chopping of the optical pumping beam enables a\nDoppler-free EIT signal to be detected. Transition frequencies between\n5P$_{1/2}$ and $n$S$_{1/2}$ states for $n=$26, 27, and 28 in $^{39}$K are\nobtained via EIT spectroscopy in a heated vapor cell with a probe beam\nstabilized to the 4S$_{1/2}\\rightarrow$5P$_{1/2}$ transition. Using previous\nhigh-resolution measurements of the 4S$_{1/2}\\rightarrow$nS$_{1/2}$\ntransitions, we make a determination of the absolute frequency of the\n4S$_{1/2}\\rightarrow$5P$_{1/2}$ transition. Our measurement is shifted by 560\nMHz from the currently accepted value with a two-fold improvement in\nuncertainty. These measurements will enable novel experiments with\nRydberg-dressed ultracold Fermi gases composed of $^{40}$K atoms.\n", "  A scenario with two subsequent periods of inflationary expansion in the very\nearly universe is examined. The model is based on a potential motivated by\nsymmetries being found in field theory at high energy. For various parameter\nsets of the potential the spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations that are\nexpected to originate from this scenario are calculated. Also the beginning of\nthe reheating epoch connecting the second inflation with thermal equilibrium is\nstudied. Perturbations with wavelengths leaving the horizon around the\ntransition between the two inflations are special: It is demonstrated that the\npower spectrum at such scales deviates significantly from expectations based on\nmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This supports the\nconclusion that parameters for which this part of the spectrum leaves\nobservable traces in the CMB must be excluded. Parameters entailing a very\nefficient second inflation correspond to standard small-field inflation and can\nmeet observational constraints. Particular attention is paid to the case where\nthe second inflation leads solely to a shift of the observable spectrum from\nthe first inflation. A viable scenario requires this shift to be small.\n", "  Supersymmetric models with radiatively-driven electroweak naturalness require\nlight higgsinos of mass ~ 100-300 GeV. Naturalness in the QCD sector is invoked\nvia the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion leading to mixed axion-higgsino dark matter.\nThe SUSY DFSZ axion model provides a solution to the SUSY mu problem and the\nLittle Hierarchy \\mu << m_{3/2} may emerge as a consequence of a mismatch\nbetween PQ and hidden sector mass scales. The traditional gravitino problem is\nnow augmented by the axino and saxion problems, since these latter particles\ncan also contribute to overproduction of WIMPs or dark radiation, or violation\nof BBN constraints. We compute regions of the T_R vs. m_{3/2} plane allowed by\nBBN, dark matter and dark radiation constraints for various PQ scale choices\nf_a. These regions are compared to the values needed for thermal leptogenesis,\nnon-thermal leptogenesis, oscillating sneutrino leptogenesis and Affleck-Dine\nleptogenesis. The latter three are allowed in wide regions of parameter space\nfor PQ scale f_a~ 10^{10}-10^{12} GeV which is also favored by naturalness:\nf_a~ \\sqrt{\\mu M_P/\\lambda_\\mu }\\sim 10^{10}-10^{12} GeV. These f_a values\ncorrespond to axion masses somewhat above the projected ADMX search regions.\n", "  We study the radiative decays of the $Z_c(3900)^0$ in a hadronic molecule\npicture, where the $Z_c(3900)$ is treated as a $D \\bar{D}^\\ast +c.c$ hadronic\nmolecule. The partial widths of $\\Gamma(Z_c(3900)^0 \\to \\gamma \\eta_c(2S))$ and\n$\\Gamma(Z_c(3900)^0 \\to \\gamma \\chi_{c0})$ are predicted to be of order 10 keV\nand the cross sections for $\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^0 Z_c(3900) \\to \\pi^0 \\gamma\n\\eta_c(2S))$ and $\\sigma(e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^0 Z_c(3900) \\to \\pi^0 \\gamma\n\\chi_{c0})$ are of order 0.1 pb at 4.23 GeV, which may be accessible for the\nBESIII and forthcoming BelleII.\n", "  Invariably, time-reversal symmetry (TRS) violation in a state of matter is\nidentified with static magnetism in it. Here, a directional scalar spin chiral\norder (DSSCO) phase is introduced that disobeys this basic principle: it breaks\nTRS but has no density of static moments. It can be obtained by melting the\nspin moments in a magnetically ordered phase but retaining residual broken TRS.\nOrbital moments are then precluded by the spatial symmetries of the spin\nrotation symmetric state. It can exist in one, two and three dimensions under\ndifferent conditions of temperature and disorder. Recently, polar Kerr effect\nexperiments in the mysterious pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates hinted\nat a strange form of broken TRS below a temperature $T_{K}$, that exhibits a\nhysteretic \"memory effect\" above $T_{K}$ and begs reconciliation with nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (which sees no moments), X-ray diffraction (which finds\ncharge ordering tendencies) and the Nernst effect (which detects nematicity).\nRemarkably, the DSSCO provides a phenomenological route for reconciling all\nthese observations, and it is conceivable that it onsets at the pseudogap\ntemperature $\\sim T^{*}$. A testable prediction of the existence of the DSSCO\nin the cuprates is a Kerr signal above $T_{K}$ triggered and trainable by a\ncurrent driven along one of the in-plane axes, but not by a current along the\nother.\n", "  In the context of two illustrative examples from supersymmetric quantum\nmechanics we show that the semi-classical analysis of the path integral\nrequires complexification of the configuration space and action, and the\ninclusion of complex saddle points, even when the parameters in the action are\nreal. We find new exact complex saddles, and show that without their\ncontribution the semi-classical expansion is in conflict with basic properties\nsuch as positive-semidefiniteness of the spectrum, and constraints of\nsupersymmetry. Generic saddles are not only complex, but also possibly\nmulti-valued, and even singular. This is in contrast to instanton solutions,\nwhich are real, smooth, and single-valued. The multi-valuedness of the action\ncan be interpreted as a hidden topological angle, quantized in units of $\\pi$\nin supersymmetric theories. The general ideas also apply to non-supersymmetric\ntheories.\n", "  Dirac fermions in condensed matter physics hold great promise for novel\nfundamental physics, quantum devices and data storage applications. IV-VI\nsemiconductors, in the inverted regime, have been recently shown to exhibit\nmassless topological surface Dirac fermions protected by crystalline symmetry,\nas well as massive bulk Dirac fermions. Under a strong magnetic field (B), both\nsurface and bulk states are quantized into Landau levels that disperse as\nB^1/2, and are thus difficult to distinguish. In this work, magneto-optical\nabsorption is used to probe the Landau levels of high mobility Bi-doped\nPb0.54Sn0.46Te topological crystalline insulator (111)-oriented films. The high\nmobility achieved in these thin film structures allows us to probe and\ndistinguish the Landau levels of both surface and bulk Dirac fermions and\nextract valuable quantitative information about their physical properties. This\nwork paves the way for future magnetooptical and electronic transport\nexperiments aimed at manipulating the band topology of such materials.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional topology of the 21-cm differential brightness\ntemperature for two hydrodynamic radiative transfer simulations and two\nsemi-numerical models. In each model, we calculate the two dimensional genus\ncurve for the early, middle and late epochs of reionization. It is found that\nthe genus curve depends strongly on the ionized fraction of hydrogen in each\nmodel. The genus curves are significantly different for different reionization\nscenarios even when the ionized faction is the same. We find that the\ntwo-dimensional topology analysis method is a useful tool to constrain the\nreionization models. Our method can be applied to the future observations such\nas those of the Square Kilometer Array.\n", "  Focusing on isotropic elastic networks we propose a novel simple-average\nexpression $G(t) = \\mu_A - h(t)$ for the computational determination of the\nshear-stress relaxation modulus $G(t)$ of a classical elastic solid or fluid\nand its equilibrium modulus $\\G_{eq} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} G(t)$. Here, $\\mu_A\n= G(0)$ characterizes the shear transformation of the system at $t=0$ and\n$h(t)$ the (rescaled) mean-square displacement of the instantaneous shear\nstress $\\hat{\\tau}(t)$ as a function of time $t$. While investigating sampling\ntime effects we also discuss the related expressions in terms of shear-stress\nautocorrelation functions. We argue finally that our key relation may be\nreadily adapted for more general linear response functions.\n", "  The low-energy physics of rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene mainly arises on\nthe external layers, where most of the {\\pi} electrons are located. Their Bloch\nband structure defines a two-band semimetal; the dispersion relation scales as\n$\\pm q^{N}$ with the momentum norm $q$ in the vicinity of two nonequivalent\nvalleys. In this paper, we address the problem of elastic scattering through a\nlocalized impurity located either on the surface of the material or within the\nbulk, and focus on the quantum interferences it induces on the two external\nlayers. It is apprehended in the framework of a $T$-matrix approach, both\nnumerically and analytically, regardless of the impurity magnitude, which\nenables the description of realistic scatters. In rhombohedral multilayer\ngraphene, the impurity induces Friedel oscillations that always decay as $1/r$.\nAs a result, monolayer graphene is the only material of the rhombohedral class\nthat exhibits $1/r^{2}$-decaying Friedel oscillations. The interference\npatterns are subsequently analyzed in momentum space. This analysis enables a\nclear distinction between monolayer graphene and multilayer graphene. It also\nshows that the interference pattern reveals the whole Bloch band structure, and\nhighlights the number of layers stacked in the material, as well as the\n${\\pi}$-quantized Berry phases that characterize the existence of nodal points\nin the semimetallic spectrum. Experimentally, these features may be probed from\nscanning tunneling microscopy, when imaging the local density of states at the\nsurfaces of suspended rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene.\n", "  Recently introduced time-dependent renormalized-natural-orbital theory\n(TDRNOT) is based on the equations of motion for the so-called natural\norbitals, i.e., the eigenfunctions of the one-body reduced density matrix.\nExact TDRNOT can be formulated for any time-dependent two-electron system in\neither spin configuration. In this paper, the method is tested against\nhigh-order harmonic generation (HHG) and Fano profiles in absorption spectra\nwith the help of a numerically exactly solvable one-dimensional model He atom,\nstarting from the spin-singlet ground state. Such benchmarks are challenging\nbecause Fano profiles originate from transitions involving autoionizing states,\nand HHG is a strong-field phenomenon well beyond linear response. TDRNOT with\njust one natural orbital per spin in the helium spin-singlet case is equivalent\nto time-dependent Hartree-Fock or time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) in exact exchange-only approximation. It is not unexpected that TDDFT\nfails in reproducing Fano profiles due to the lack of doubly excited,\nautoionizing states. HHG spectra, on the other hand, are widely believed to be\nwell-captured by TDDFT. However, HHG spectra of helium may display a second\nplateau that originates from simultaneous HHG in He$^+$ and neutral He. It is\nfound that already TDRNOT with two natural orbitals per spin is sufficient to\ncapture this effect as well as the Fano profiles on a qualitative level. With\nmore natural orbitals (6--8 per spin) quantitative agreement can be reached.\nErrors due to the truncation to a finite number of orbitals are identified.\n", "  We used the ARO 12m antenna to observe emission from the J=1-0 lines of\ncarbon monoxide, \\hcop\\ and HNC and the J=2-1 line of CS toward and around the\ncontinuum peak used for absorption studies and we compare them with CH, HNC,\nC\\p\\ and other absorption spectra from PRISMAS. We develop a kinematic analysis\nthat allows a continuous description of the spectral properties and relates\nthem to viewing geometry in the Galaxy. As for CH, HF, C\\p, \\hcop\\ and other\nspecies observed in absorption, mm-wave emission in CO, \\hcop, HNC and CS is\ncontinuous over the full velocity range expected for material between the Sun\nand W31 4.95 kpc away. CO emission is much stronger than average in the\nGalactic molecular ring and the mean \\HH\\ density derived from CH, $4 \\pccc\n\\la$ 2$<$n(\\HH)$>$ $\\la 10 \\pccc$ at 4 $\\la$ R $\\la$ 6.4 kpc, is similarly\nelevated. The CO-\\HH\\ conversion factor falls in a narrow range \\XCO\\ $=\n1-2\\times10^{20}~\\HH\\ \\pcc~({\\rm K}-\\kms)^{-1}$ if the emitting gas is mostly\non the near side of the sub-central point, as we suggest. The brightnesses of\n\\hcop, HNC, and CS are comparable (0.83\\%, 0.51\\% and 1.1\\% respectively\nrelative to CO) and have no variation in galactocentric radius with respect to\nCO. Comparison of the profile-averaged \\hcop\\ emission brightness and optical\ndepth implies local densities n(H) $\\approx 135\\pm25\\pccc$ with most of\nexcitation of \\hcop\\ from electrons. At such density, a consistent picture of\nthe \\HH-bearing gas, accounting also for the CO emission, has a volume filling\nfactor 3\\% and a 5 pc clump or cloud size.\n", "  We present new spectroscopic observations of the double-lined eclipsing\nbinary V2653\\,Oph. The photometric observations obtained by $ASAS$ were\nanalysed and combined with the analysis of radial velocities for deriving the\nabsolute parameters of the components. Masses and radii were determined for the\nfirst time as M$_p$=1.537$\\pm$0.021 M$_{\\odot}$ and R$_p$=2.215$\\pm$0.055\nR$_{\\odot}$, M$_s$=1.273$\\pm$0.019 M$_{\\odot}$ and R$_s$=2.000$\\pm$0.056\nR$_{\\odot}$ for the components of V2653\\,Oph. We estimate an interstellar\nreddening of 0.15$\\pm$0.08\\,mag and a distance of 300$\\pm$50\\,pc for the\nsystem, both supporting the membership of the open cluster Collinder\\,359.\nUsing the out-of-eclipse photometric data we have made frequency analysis and\ndetected a periodic signal at 1.0029$\\pm$0.0019\\,c/d. This frequency and the\nlocation of the more massive star on the HR diagram lead to classification of a\n$\\gamma$ Dor type variable. Up to date only eleven $\\gamma$ Dor type pulsators\nin the eclipsing binaries have been discovered. For six out of 11 systems, the\nphysical parameters were determined. Although a small sample, we find empirical\nrelations that $P_{puls}$ $\\propto$ $P_{orb}^{0.43}$ and $P_{puls}$ $\\propto$\n$g^{-0.83}$. While the pulsation periods increase with longer orbital periods,\nthey decrease with increasing surface gravities of pulsating components and\ngravitational pull exerted by the companions. We present, briefly, the\nunderlying physics behind\n", "  Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD) Galaxies in the nearby Universe provide a means for\nstudying feedback mechanisms and star-formation processes in low-metallicity\nenvironments in great detail. Due to their vicinity, these local analogues to\nyoung galaxies are well suited for high-resolution studies that would be\nunfeasible for primordial galaxies in the high-redshift universe. Here we\npresent HST-WFC3 observations of one such BCD, Mrk 71, one of the most powerful\nlocal starbursts known, in the light of [O II], He II, Hb, [O III], Ha, and [S\nII]. At D=3.44 Mpc, this extensive suite of emission line images enables us to\nexplore the chemical and physical conditions of Mrk 71 on ~2 pc scales. Using\nthese high spatial-resolution observations, we use emission line diagnostics to\ndistinguish ionisation mechanisms on a pixel-by-pixel basis and show that\ndespite the previously reported hypersonic gas and super-bubble blow out, the\ngas in Mrk 71 is photoionised, with no sign of shock-excited emission. Using\nstrong-line metallicity diagnostics, we present the first 'metallicity image'\nof a galaxy, revealing chemically inhomogeneity on scales of <50 pc. We\nadditionally demonstrate that while chemical structure can be lost at large\nspatial scales, metallicity-diagnostics can break down on spatial scales\nsmaller than a HII region. HeII emission line images are used to identify up to\nsix Wolf-Rayet stars in Mrk 71, three of which lie on the edge of blow-out\nregion. This study not only demonstrates the benefits of high-resolution\nspatially-resolved observations in assessing the effects of feedback\nmechanisms, but also the limitations of fine spatial scales when employing\nemission-line diagnostics. Both aspects are especially relevant as we enter the\nera of extremely large telescopes, when observing structure on ~10 pc scales\nwill no longer be limited to the local universe.\n", "  We analyze the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) orders with axial\nmomenta $(Q, 0)$ and $(0,Q)$ ($\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_y$ respectively), detected\nin the underdoped cuprates. The CDW order in real space can be uni-directional\n(either $\\Delta_x$ or $\\Delta_y$ is non-zero) or bi-directional (both\n$\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_y$ are non-zero). To understand which of the two orders\ndevelop, we adopt the magnetic scenario, in which the CDW order appears due to\nspin-fluctuation exchange, and derive the Ginzburg-Landau action to the sixth\norder in $\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_y$. We argue that, at the mean-field level, the\nCDW order is bi-directional at the onset, with equal amplitudes of $\\Delta_x$\nand $\\Delta_y$, but changes to uni-directional inside the CDW phase. This\nimplies that, at a given temperature, CDW order is uni-directional at smaller\ndopings, but becomes bi-directional at larger dopings. This is consistent with\nrecent x-ray data on YBCO, which detected tendency towards bi-directional order\nat larger dopings. We discuss the role of discrete symmetry breaking at a\nhigher temperature for the interplay between bi-directional and uni-directional\nCDW orders and also discuss the role of pair-density-wave (PDW) order, which\nmay appear along with CDW. We argue that PDW with the same momentum as CDW\nchanges the structure of the bi-directional charge order by completely\nreplacing either $\\Delta_x$ or $\\Delta_y$ CDW components by PDW. However, if an\n\"Amperean\" PDW order, which pairs fermions with approximately the same momenta,\nis also present, both $\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_y$ remain non-zero in the\nbi-directional phase, albeit with non-equal amplitudes. This is again\nconsistent with x-ray experiments, which at larger doping found non-equal\n$\\Delta_x$ and $\\Delta_y$ in every domain.\n", "  In peripheral heavy-ion collisions, localized ,short-lived an extremely huge\nmagnetic field can be generated. Its possible influences on the quark-hadron\nphase transition(s) and the transport properties of the hadronic and partonic\nmatter shall be analysed from the Polyakov linear-sigma model. Our calculations\nare compared with recent lattice QCD calculations.\n", "  We address the interaction of single- and two-qubit systems with external\nfluctuating transverse fields and analyze in details the dynamical decoherence\ninduced by Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise, e.g. random telegraph noise (RTN).\nUpon exploiting the exact RTN solution of the time-dependent Von Neumann\nequation, we analyze in details the behavior of quantum correlations and prove\nthe non-Markovianity of the dynamical map in the full parameter range, i.e. for\neither fast or slow noise. The dynamics induced by Gaussian noise is studied\nnumerically and compared to the RTN solution, showing the existence of (state\ndependent) regions of the parameter space where the two noises lead to very\nsimilar dynamics. Our results shows that while the effects of non-Gaussian\nnoise cannot be trivially mapped to that of Gaussian noise and viceversa, i.e.\nthe spectrum alone is not enough to summarize the noise effects, the dynamics\nunder the effect of one kind of noise may be simulated with high fidelity by\nthe other one.\n", "  CALET (Calorimetric Electron Telescope), installed on the ISS in August 2015,\ndirectly measures the electron+positron cosmic rays flux up to 20 TeV. With its\nproton rejection capability of 1:10^5 and an aperture of 1200 cm^2 sr, it will\nprovide good statistics even well above one TeV, while also featuring an energy\nresolution of 2%, which allows it to detect fine structures in the spectrum.\nSuch structures may originate from Dark Matter annihilation or decay, making\nindirect Dark Matter search one of CALET's main science objectives among others\nsuch as identification of signatures from nearby supernova remnants, study of\nthe heavy nuclei spectra and gamma astronomy. The latest results from AMS-02 on\npositron fraction and total electron+positron flux can be fitted with a\nparametrization including a single pulsar as an extra power law source with\nexponential cut-off, which emits an equal amount of electrons and positrons.\nThis single pulsar scenario for the positron excess is extrapolated into the\nTeV region and the expected CALET data for this case are simulated. Based on\nthis prediction for CALET data, the sensitivity of CALET to Dark Matter\nannihilation in the galactic halo has been calculated. It is shown that CALET\ncould significantly improve the limits compared to current data, especially for\nthose Dark Matter candidates that feature a large fraction of annihilation\ndirectly into electron+positron, such as the LKP (Lightest Kaluza-Klein\nParticle).\n", "  Starting from an earlier representation of the independent dimension 6 gluon\noperators in terms of color electric and magnetic fields, we estimate their\nchanges near the critical temperature $T_c$ using the temperature dependence of\nthe dimension 4 electric and magnetic condensates extracted from pure gauge\ntheory on the lattice. We then improve the previous QCD sum rules for the\n$J/\\psi$ mass near $T_c$ based on dimension 4 operators, by including the\ncontribution of the dimension 6 operators to the OPE. We find an enhanced\nstability in the sum rule and confirm that the $J/\\psi$ will undergo an abrupt\nchange in the property across $T_c$.\n", "  We discuss the dominant terms of the relativistic galaxy number counts to\nsecond order in cosmological perturbation theory on sub-Hubble scales and on\nintermediate to large redshifts. In particular, we determine their contribution\nto the bispectrum. In addition to the terms already known from Newtonian second\norder perturbation theory, we find that there are a series of additional\n`lensing-like' terms which contribute to the bispectrum. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the full leading order bispectrum and we evaluate it\nnumerically for different configurations, indicating how they can be measured\nwith upcoming surveys. In particular, the new `lensing-like' terms are not\nnegligible for wide redshift bins and even dominate the bispectrum at well\nseparated redshifts. This offers us the possibility to measure them in future\nsurveys.\n", "  Undoped graphene in a strong, tilted magnetic field exhibits a radical change\nin conduction upon changing the tilt-angle, which can be attributed to a\nquantum phase transition from a canted antiferromagnetic (CAF) to a\nferromagnetic (FM) bulk state at filling factor $\\nu=0$. This behavior\nsignifies a change in the nature of the collective ground state and excitations\nacross the transition. Using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation, we\nstudy the collective neutral (particle-hole) excitations in the two phases,\nboth in the bulk and on the edge of the system. The CAF has gapless neutral\nmodes in the bulk, whereas the FM state supports only gapped modes in its bulk.\nAt the edge, however, only the FM state supports gapless charge-carrying\nstates. Linear response functions are computed to elucidate their sensitivity\nto the various modes. The response functions demonstrate that the two phases\ncan be distinguished by the evolution of a local charge pulse at the edge.\n", "  The interface between a topological insulator and a ferromagnetic insulator\nexhibits an interesting interplay of topological Dirac electrons and magnetism.\nAs has been shown recently, the breaking of time-reversal invariance by\nmagnetic order generates a Chern-Simons term in the action, that in turn leads\nto a Berry phase and a magnetoelectric effect of topological origin. Here, we\nconsider the system in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction between\nthe Dirac electrons, and find that the magnetoelectric effect of the\nfluctuating electric field becomes non-local. We derive a Landau-Lifshitz\nequation for the fluctuation-induced magnetization dynamics and the\nEuler-Lagrange equation of the Coulomb field by explicit one-loop calculations.\nVia the Coulomb interaction, divergences in the in-plane magnetization affect\nthe magnetization dynamics over large distances in a topologically protected\nway.\n", "  We study the Atomtronics Quantum Interference Device employing a\nsemiclassical perspective. We consider an $M$ site ring that is described by\nthe Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Coherent Rabi oscillations in the flow of the\ncurrent are feasible, with an enhanced frequency due to to chaos-assisted\ntunneling. We highlight the consequences of introducing a weak-link into the\ncircuit. In the latter context we clarify the phase-space considerations that\nare involved in setting up an effective \"systems plus bath\" description in\nterms of Josephson-Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian.\n", "  Arnold (2005), Forgan (2013), and Korpela et al. (2015) noted that\nplanet-sized artificial structures could be discovered with Kepler as they\ntransit their host star. We present a general discussion of transiting\nmegastructures, and enumerate ten potential ways their anomalous silhouettes,\norbits, and transmission properties would distinguish them from exoplanets. We\nalso enumerate the natural sources of such signatures.\n  Several anomalous objects, such as KIC 12557548 and CoRoT-29, have\nvariability in depth consistent with Arnold's prediction and/or an asymmetric\nshape consistent with Forgan's model. Since well motivated physical models have\nso far provided natural explanations for these signals, the ETI hypothesis is\nnot warranted for these objects, but they still serve as useful examples of how\nnonstandard transit signatures might be identified and interpreted in a SETI\ncontext. Boyajian et al. 2015 recently announced KIC 8462852, an object with a\nbizarre light curve consistent with a \"swarm\" of megastructures. We suggest\nthis is an outstanding SETI target.\n  We develop the normalized information content statistic $M$ to quantify the\ninformation content in a signal embedded in a discrete series of bounded\nmeasurements, such as variable transit depths, and show that it can be used to\ndistinguish among constant sources, interstellar beacons, and naturally\nstochastic or artificial, information-rich signals. We apply this formalism to\nKIC 12557548 and a specific form of beacon suggested by Arnold to illustrate\nits utility.\n", "  We investigate the contribution of charge puddles to the non-vanishing\nconductivity minimum in disordered graphene flakes at the charge neutrality\npoint. For that purpose, we study systems with a geometry that suppresses the\ntransmission due to evanescent modes allowing to single out the effect of\ncharge fluctuations in the transport properties. We use the recursive Green's\nfunctions technique to obtain local and total transmissions through systems\nthat mimic vanishing density of states at the charge neutrality point in the\npresence of a local disordered local potential to model the charge puddles. Our\nmicroscopic model includes electron-electron interactions via a spin resolved\nHubbard mean field term. We establish the relation between the charge puddle\ndisorder potential and the electronic transmission at the charge neutrality\npoint. We discuss the implications of our findings to high mobility graphene\nsamples deposited on different substrates and provide a qualitative\ninterpretation of recent experimental results.\n", "  We study the performance of a partially correlated amplitude damping channel\nacting on two qubits. We derive lower bounds for the single-shot classical\ncapacity by studying two kinds of quantum ensembles, one which allows to\nmaximize the Holevo quantity for the memoryless channel and the other allowing\nthe same task but for the full-memory channel. In these two cases, we also show\nthe amount of entanglement which is involved in achieving the maximum of the\nHolevo quantity. For the single-shot quantum capacity we discuss both a lower\nand an upper bound, achieving a good estimate for high values of the channel\ntransmissivity. We finally compute the entanglement-assisted classical channel\ncapacity.\n", "  We study a statistical mechanics model of two species of bosons with mutual\nstatistics $\\theta=2\\pi/n$ in (2+1) dimensions. This model realizes a\nfractionalized topological phase of bosons, which is a fractionalized version\nof the boson integer quantum Hall effect. The model can be studied with\nsign-free Monte Carlo simulations. We study the phase transitions between the\nfractionalized topological phase and a trivial insulator, and between different\ntopological phases. We find that these transitions are continuous, and we\nmeasure their critical exponents.\n", "  3C318, a radio-loud quasar at z=1.574, is a subgalactic-sized radio source,\nand a good test-bed for the interplay between black hole and galaxy growth in\nthe high-z Universe. Based on its IRAS, ISO, and SCUBA detections, it has long\nbeen considered as one of the most intrinsically luminous (L$_{\\mathrm{IR}}$ >\n10$^{13}$ L$_{\\odot}$) infrared sources in the Universe. Recent far-infrared\ndata from the Herschel Space Observatory reveal that most of the flux\nassociated with 3C318 measured with earlier instruments in fact comes from a\nbright nearby source. Optical imaging and spectroscopy show that this\ninfrared-bright source is a strongly star-forming pair of interacting galaxies\nat z=0.35. Adding existing Spitzer and SDSS photometry, we perform a spectral\nenergy distribution analysis of the pair, and find that it has a combined\ninfrared luminosity of L$_{\\mathrm{IR}}$ = 1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{12}$ L$_{\\odot}$,\ncomparable to other intermediate-redshift ultra-luminous infrared galaxies\nstudied with Herschel. Isolating the emission from 3C318's host, we robustly\nconstrain the level of star formation to a value a factor of three lower than\nthat published earlier, which is more in line with the star formation activity\nfound in other Herschel-detected 3CR objects at similar redshift.\n", "  OB type stars have strong ionizing radiation, and drive energetic winds. The\nultraviolet (UV) radiation from ionizing stars may heat dust and ionize gas to\nsweep up an expanding bubble shell. This shell may be the result of feedback\nleading to a new generation of stars. N131 is an infrared dust bubble residing\nin a molecular filament. We study the formation and fragmentation of this\nbubble with multi-wavelength dust and gas observations. Towards the bubble\nN131, we analyzed archival multi-wavelength observations including 3.6, 4.5,\n5.8, 8.0, 24, 70, 160, 250, 350, 500 $\\mu$m, 1.1 mm, and 21 cm. In addition, we\nperformed new observations of CO (2-1), CO (1-0), and $^{13}$CO (1-0) with the\nIRAM 30-m telescope. Multi-wavelength dust and gas observations reveal a\nringlike shell with compact fragments, two filamentary structures, and a\nsecondary bubble N131-A. The bubble N131 is a rare object with a large hole at\n24 $\\mu$m and 21 cm in the direction of its center. The dust and gas clumps are\ncompact and might have been compressed at the inner edge of the ringlike shell,\nwhile they are extended and might be pre-existing at the outer edge. The column\ndensity, excitation temperature, and velocity show a potentially hierarchical\ndistribution from the inner to outer edge of the ringlike shell. We also\ndetected the front and back sides of the secondary bubble N131-A in the\ndirection of its center. The derived Lyman-continuum ionizing photon flux\nwithin N131-A is equivalent to an O9.5 star. Based on the above, we suggest\nthat the bubble N131 might be triggered by the strong stellar winds from a\ngroup of massive stars inside the bubble. We propose a scenario in which the\nbubble N131 forms from the disruption of a gas filament by expansion of HII\nregion, strong stellar winds, and fragments under self-gravity.\n", "  A seesaw mechanism is presented in the neutrino sector and a new phase of CP\nviolation ($\\alpha$) emerges in the interplay between the type-I and type-III\nseesaw schemes. This phase is inside the mixing term, and thus it cannot be\nrotated away in the Yukawa Lagrangian and, therefore, the heavy symmetry states\ncannot be in a diagonal weak basis in the broken phase. Some particular\ndescriptions are analyzed suggesting that if the usual Yukawa couplings are\nsuppressed, leptogenesis still occurs due to a new interacting vertex with\nfermion triplet $T$, fermion singlets $N$, and an ad-hoc scalar triplet,\n$\\Sigma$, which now is included to mediate the interactions. The evaluated CP\nviolation is enough to generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry even\nin the minimal $1N+1T$ case (independently of $\\alpha$) or in the $2N+1T$\napproach (controlled by $\\alpha$). The latter introduces more CP contributions\nto leptogenesis due to new diagrams which are now possible even with the\nsuppressed imaginary part of the standard Yukawa couplings and can induce the\nobserved baryon-to-photon ratio.\n", "  Conformal deformations manifest in the AdS/CFT correspondence as boundary\nconditions on the AdS field. Heretofore, double-trace deformations have been\nthe primary focus in this context. To better understand multitrace\ndeformations, we revisit the relationship between the generating AdS partition\nfunction for a free bulk theory and the boundary CFT partition function subject\nto arbitrary conformal deformations. The procedure leads us to a formalism that\nconstructs bulk fields from boundary operators. Using this formalism, we\nindependently replicate the holographic RG flow narrative to go on to interpret\nthe brane used to regulate the AdS theory as a renormalization scale. The\nscale-dependence of the dilatation spectrum of a boundary theory in the\npresence of general deformations can be thus understood on the AdS side using\nthis formalism.\n", "  We model the remarkable thin-film Ba-Ti-O structures formed by heat treatment\nof an initial perovskite BaTiO$_3$ thin film on a Pt(111) surface. All\nstructures contain a rumpled Ti-O network with all Ti threefold coordinated\nwith O, and with Ba occupying the larger. mainly Ti$_7$O$_7$, pores. The\nquasicrystal structure is a simple decoration of three types of tiles: square,\ntriangle and 30 degree rhombus, with edge lengths 6.85 Angstroms, joined\nedge-to-edge in a quasicrystalline pattern; observed crystalline Ba-Ti-O\nstructures are built from these and other tiles. Simulated STM images reproduce\nthe patterns seen experimentally, and identify the bright protrusions as Ba\natoms. The models are consistent with all experimental observations.\n", "  We present the analysis of the entire HARPS observations of three stars that\nhost planetary systems: HD1461, HD40307, and HD204313. The data set spans eight\nyears and contains more than 200 nightly averaged velocity measurements for\neach star. This means that it is sensitive to both long-period and low-mass\nplanets and also to the effects induced by stellar activity cycles. We modelled\nthe data using Keplerian functions that correspond to planetary candidates and\nincluded the short- and long-term effects of magnetic activity. A Bayesian\napproach was taken both for the data modelling, which allowed us to include\ninformation from activity proxies such as $\\log{(R'_{\\rm HK})}$ in the velocity\nmodelling, and for the model selection, which permitted determining the number\nof significant signals in the system. The Bayesian model comparison overcomes\nthe limitations inherent to the traditional periodogram analysis. We report an\nadditional super-Earth planet in the HD1461 system. Four out of the six planets\npreviously reported for HD40307 are confirmed and characterised. We discuss the\nremaining two proposed signals. In particular, we show that when the systematic\nuncertainty associated with the techniques for estimating model probabilities\nare taken into account, the current data are not conclusive concerning the\nexistence of the habitable-zone candidate HD40307 g. We also fully characterise\nthe Neptune-mass planet that orbits HD204313 in 34.9 days.\n", "  We have further developed and extended a method for calculation of atomic\nproperties based on a combination of the configuration interaction and\ncoupled-cluster approach. We have applied this approach to the calculation of\ndifferent properties of atomic lead, including the energy levels, hyperfine\nstructure constants, electric-dipole transition amplitudes, and E1 parity\nnonconserving (PNC) amplitude for the (6p^2) ^3P_0 - (6p^2) ^3P_1 transition.\nThe uncertainty of the E1 PNC amplitude was reduced by a factor of two in\ncomparison with the previous most accurate calculation [V.~A.~Dzuba et.al.,\nEurophys. Lett. 7, 413 (1988)]. Our value for the weak charge Q_W=-117(5) is in\nagreement with the standard model prediction.\n", "  [Abbreviated] We search for scaling relations between the fundamental AGN\nparameters and rest-frame UV/optical variability properties for a sample of\n$\\sim$90 X-ray selected AGNs covering a wide redshift range from the XMM-COSMOS\nsurvey, with optical light curves in four bands provided by the Pan-STARRS1\n(PS1) Medium Deep Field 04 survey. To estimate the variability amplitude we\nutilize the normalized excess variance ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$) and probe\nvariability on rest-frame timescales of several months and years by calculating\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$ from different parts of our light curves. In\naddition, we derive the rest-frame optical PSD for our sources using\ncontinuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. We observe that\nthe excess variance and the PSD amplitude are strongly anti-correlated with\nwavelength, bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio. There is no evidence for\na dependency of the variability amplitude on black hole mass and redshift.\nThese results suggest that the accretion rate is the fundamental physical\nquantity determining the rest-frame UV/optical variability amplitude of quasars\non timescales of months and years. The optical PSD of all of our sources is\nconsistent with a broken power law showing a characteristic bend at rest-frame\ntimescales ranging between $\\sim$100 and $\\sim$300 days. The break timescale\nexhibits no significant correlation with any of the fundamental AGN parameters.\nThe low frequency slope of the PSD is consistent with a value of $-1$ for most\nof our objects, whereas the high frequency slope is characterized by a broad\ndistribution of values between $\\sim-2$ and $\\sim-4$. These findings unveil\nsignificant deviations from the simple \"damped random walk\" model, frequently\nused in previous optical variability studies. We find a weak tendency for AGNs\nwith higher black hole mass having steeper high frequency PSD slopes.\n", "  We study the charmonium dissociation in a strongly coupled chiral plasma in\nthe presence of magnetic field and axial charge imbalance. This type of plasma\ncarries \"anomalous flow\" induced by the chiral anomaly and exhibits novel\ntransport phenomena such as chiral magnetic effect. We found that the\n\"anomalous flow\" would modify the charmonium color screening length by using\nthe gauge/gravity correspondence. We derive an analytical expression\nquantifying the \"anomalous flow\" experienced by a charmonium for a large class\nof chiral plasma with a gravity dual. We elaborate on the similarity and {\\it\nqualitative} difference between anomalous effects on the charmonium color\nscreening length which are {\\it model-dependent} and those on the heavy quark\ndrag force which are fixed by the second law of thermodynamics. We speculate on\nthe possible charmonium dissociation induced by the chiral anomaly in heavy ion\ncollisions.\n", "  In this Letter, we constrain the dust-to-gas ratio in the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) at high redshifts. We employ models for dust in the local Universe\nto contrain the dust-to-gas ratio during the epoch of reionization at redshifts\nz ~ 6-10. The observed level of reddening of high redshift galaxies implies\nthat the IGM was enriched to an intergalactic dust-to-gas ratio of less than 3%\nof the Milky Way value by a redshift of z=10.\n", "  The purport of quantum teleportation is to completely transfer information\nfrom one party to another distant partner. However, from the perspective of\nparameter estimation, it is the information carried by a particular parameter,\nnot the information of total quantum state that needs to be teleported. Due to\nthe inevitable noise in environment, we propose two schemes to enhance quantum\nFisher information (QFI) teleportation under amplitude damping noise with the\ntechnique of partial measurements. We find that post partial measurement can\ngreatly enhance the teleported QFI, while the combination of prior partial\nmeasurement and post partial measurement reversal could completely eliminate\nthe effect of decoherence. We show that, somewhat consequentially, enhancing\nQFI teleportation is more economic than that of improving fidelity\nteleportation. Our work extends the ability of partial measurements as a\nquantum technique to battle decoherence in quantum information processing.\n", "  We obtain, using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, virial expansion and a\nhigh-density perturbation expansion about the fully packed monodispersed phase,\nthe phase diagram of a system of bidispersed hard rods on a square lattice. We\nshow numerically that when the length of the longer rods is $7$, two continuous\ntransitions may exist as the density of the longer rods in increased, keeping\nthe density of shorter rods fixed: first from a low-density isotropic phase to\na nematic phase, and second from the nematic to a high-density isotropic phase.\nThe difference between the critical densities of the two transitions decreases\nto zero at a critical density of the shorter rods such that the fully packed\nphase is disordered for any composition. When both the rod lengths are larger\nthan $6$, we observe the existence of two transitions along the fully packed\nline as the composition is varied. Low-density virial expansion, truncated at\nsecond virial coefficient, reproduces features of the first transition. By\ndeveloping a high-density perturbation expansion, we show that when one of the\nrods is long enough, there will be at least two isotropic-nematic transitions\nalong the fully packed line as the composition is varied.\n", "  We apply the variational method to obtain the universal and analytical lower\nbounds for parameter precision in some noisy systems. We first derive a lower\nbound for phase precision in lossy optical interferometry at non-zero\ntemperature. Then we consider the effect of both amplitude damping and phase\ndiffusion on phase-shift precision. At last, we extend the constant phase\nestimation to the case of continuous fluctuating phase estimation, and find\nthat due to photon losses the corresponding mean square error transits from the\nstochastic Heisenberg limit to the stochastic standard quantum limit as the\ntotal photon flux increases.\n", "  We present an analysis of two different approximations to the scalar field\ntheory on the fuzzy sphere, a nonperturbative and a perturbative one, which are\nboth multitrace matrix models. We show that the former reproduces a phase\ndiagram with correct features in a qualitative agreement with the previous\nnumerical studies and that the latter gives a phase diagram with features not\nexpected in the phase diagram of the field theory.\n", "  Evidence for small amounts of very hot plasma has been found in active\nregions and might be the indication of an impulsive heating, released at\nspatial scales smaller than the cross section of a single loop. We investigate\nthe heating and substructure of coronal loops in the core of one such active\nregion by analyzing the light curves in the smallest resolution elements of\nsolar observations in two EUV channels (94 A and 335 A) from the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly on-board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We model the\nevolution of a bundle of strands heated by a storm of nanoflares by means of a\nhydrodynamic 0D loop model (EBTEL). The light curves obtained from the random\ncombination of those of single strands are compared to the observed light\ncurves either in a single pixel or in a row of pixels, simultaneously in the\ntwo channels and using two independent methods: an artificial intelligent\nsystem (Probabilistic Neural Network, PNN) and a simple cross-correlation\ntechnique. We explore the space of the parameters to constrain the distribution\nof the heat pulses, their duration and their spatial size, and, as a feedback\non the data, their signatures on the light curves. From both methods the best\nagreement is obtained for a relatively large population of events (1000) with a\nshort duration (less than 1 min) and a relatively shallow distribution (power\nlaw with index 1.5) in a limited energy range (1.5 decades). The feedback on\nthe data indicates that bumps in the light curves, especially in the 94 A\nchannel, are signatures of a heating excess that occurred a few minutes before.\n", "  We investigate quantumness of spin-1 states, defined as the Hilbert-Schmidt\ndistance to the convex hull of spin coherent states. We derive its analytic\nexpression in the case of pure states as a function of the smallest eigenvalue\nof the Bloch matrix and give explicitly the closest classical state for an\narbitrary pure state. Numerical evidence is provided that the exact formula for\npure states provides an upper bound on the quantumness of mixed states. Due to\nthe connection between quantumness and entanglement we obtain new insights into\nthe geometry of symmetric entangled states.\n", "  We performed a detailed study of the evolution of the luminosity of\nHe-ignition stage and of the red giant branch bump luminosity during the red\ngiant branch phase transition for various metallicities. To this purpose we\ncalculated a grid of stellar models that sample the mass range of the\ntransition with a fine mass step equal to ${\\rm 0.01M_\\odot}$. We find that for\na stellar population with a given initial chemical composition, there is a\ncritical age (of 1.1-1.2~Gyr) around which a decrease in age of just 20-30\nmillion years causes a drastic drop in the red giant branch tip brightness. We\nalso find a narrow age range (a few $10^7$ yr) around the transition,\ncharacterized by the luminosity of the red giant branch bump being brighter\nthan the luminosity of He ignition. We discuss a possible link between this\noccurrence and observations of Li-rich core He-burning stars.\n", "  Supernovae Type Iax (SNe Iax) are less energetic and less luminous than\ntypical thermonuclear explosions. A suggested explanation for the observed\ncharacteristics of this subclass is a binary progenitor system consisting of a\nCO white dwarf primary accreting from a helium star companion. A\nsingle-degenerate explosion channel might be expected to result in a dense\ncircumstellar medium (CSM), although no evidence for such a CSM has yet been\nobserved for this subclass. Here we present recent Spitzer observations of the\nSN Iax 2014dt obtained by the SPIRITS program nearly one year post-explosion\nthat reveal a strong mid-IR excess over the expected fluxes of more normal SNe\nIa. This excess is consistent with 1E-5 M_solar of newly formed dust, which\nwould be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in a\nnormal Type Ia. The excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty CSM that\nwas likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a single\ndegenerate progenitor system. Compared to other SNe Ia that show significant\nshock interaction (SNe Ia-CSM) and interacting core-collapse events (SNe IIn),\nthis dust shell in SN 2014dt is less massive. We consider the implications that\nsuch a pre-existing dust shell has for the progenitor system, including a\nbinary system with a mass donor that is a red giant, a red supergiant, and an\nasymptotic giant branch star.\n", "  We report the discovery of three low-mass double-lined eclipsing binaries in\nthe pre-main sequence Upper Scorpius association, revealed by $K2$ photometric\nmonitoring of the region over $\\sim$ 78 days. The orbital periods of all three\nsystems are $<$5 days. We use the $K2$ photometry plus multiple Keck/HIRES\nradial velocities and spectroscopic flux ratios to determine fundamental\nstellar parameters for both the primary and secondary components of each\nsystem, along with the orbital parameters. We present tentative evidence that\nEPIC 203868608 is a hierarchical triple system comprised of an eclipsing pair\nof $\\sim$25 $M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ brown dwarfs with a wide M-type companion. If\nconfirmed, it would constitute only the second double-lined eclipsing brown\ndwarf binary system discovered to date. The double-lined system EPIC 203710387\nis composed of nearly identical M4.5-M5 stars with fundamentally determined\nmasses and radii measured to better than 3% precision ($M_1=0.1183\\pm0.0028\nM_\\odot$, $M_2=0.1076\\pm0.0031 M_\\odot$ and $R_1=0.417\\pm0.010 R_\\odot$,\n$R_2=0.450\\pm0.012 R_\\odot$) from combination of the light curve and radial\nvelocity time series. These stars have the lowest masses of any stellar mass\ndouble-lined eclipsing binary to date. Finally, EPIC 203476597 is a compact\nsingle-lined system with a G8-KO primary and a likely mid-K secondary whose\nline are revealed in spectral ratios. Continued measurement of radial\nvelocities and spectroscopic flux ratios will better constrain fundamental\nparameters and should elevate the objects to benchmark status. We also present\nrevised parameters for the double-lined eclipsing binary UScoCTIO 5\n($M_1=0.3336\\pm0.0022 M_\\odot$, $M_2=0.3200\\pm0.0022 M_\\odot$ and\n$R_1=0.862\\pm0.012$, $R_2=0.852\\pm0.013 R_\\odot$). We discuss the implications\nof our results on these $\\sim$0.1-1.5 $M_\\odot$ stars for pre-main-sequence\nevolutionary models.\n", "  We present the analysis of 34 new VLT/X-Shooter spectra of young stellar\nobjects in the Chamaeleon I star forming region, together with four more\nspectra of stars in Taurus and two in Chamaeleon II. The broad wavelength\ncoverage and accurate flux calibration of our spectra allow us to estimate\nstellar and accretion parameters for our targets by fitting the photospheric\nand accretion continuum emission from the Balmer continuum down to 700 nm. The\ndependence of accretion with stellar properties for this sample is consistent\nwith previous results from the literature. The accretion rates for transitional\ndisks are consistent with those of full disks in the same region. The spread of\nmass accretion rates at any given stellar mass is found to be smaller than in\nmany studies, but is larger than that derived in the Lupus clouds using similar\ndata and techniques. Differences in the stellar mass range and in the\nenvironmental conditions between our sample and that of Lupus may account for\nthe discrepancy in scatter between Chamaeleon I and Lupus. Complete samples in\nChamaeleon I and Lupus are needed to determine whether the difference in\nscatter of accretion rates and the lack of evolutionary trends are robust to\nsample selection.\n", "  Context: Effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity are basic\nspectroscopic stellar parameters necessary to characterize a star or a\nplanetary system. Reliable atmospheric parameters for FGK stars have been\nobtained mostly from methods that relay on high resolution and high\nsignal-to-noise optical spectroscopy. The advent of a new generation of high\nresolution near-IR spectrographs opens the possibility of using classic\nspectroscopic methods with high resolution and high signal-to-noise in the NIR\nspectral window. Aims: We aim to compile a new iron line list in the NIR from a\nsolar spectrum to derive precise stellar atmospheric parameters, comparable to\nthe ones already obtained from high resolution optical spectra. The spectral\nrange covers 10 000 {\\AA} to 25 000 {\\AA}, which is equivalent to the Y, J, H,\nand K bands. Methods: Our spectroscopic analysis is based on the iron\nexcitation and ionization balance done in LTE. We use a high resolution and\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the Sun from the Kitt Peak telescope as\na starting point to compile the iron line list. The oscillator strengths (log\ngf) of the iron lines were calibrated for the Sun. The abundance analysis was\ndone using the MOOG code after measuring equivalent widths of 357 solar iron\nlines. Results: We successfully derived stellar atmospheric parameters for the\nSun. Furthermore, we analysed HD20010, a F8IV star, from which we derived\nstellar atmospheric parameters using the same line list as for the Sun. The\nspectrum was obtained from the CRIRES- POP database. The results are compatible\nwith the ones found in the literature, confirming the reliability of our line\nlist. However, due to the quality of the data we obtain large errors.\n", "  Construction of future electron-positron colliders (or dedicated electron\nlinac) and muon colliders close to Future Circular Collider will give\nopportunity to utilize highest energy proton and nucleus beams for\nlepton-hadron and photon-hadron collisions. In this paper we estimate main\nparameters of the FCC based ep and \\mu p colliders.\n", "  Context. Accurate photometry with ground based solar telescopes requires\ncharacterization of straylight. Scattering in Earth's atmosphere and in the\ntelescope optics are potentially significant sources of straylight, for which\nthe point spread function (PSF) has wings that reach very far. This kind of\nstraylight produces an aureola, extending several solar radii off the solar\ndisk. Aims. We want to measure such straylight using the ordinary science\ninstrumentation. Methods. We scanned the intensity on and far off the solar\ndisk by use of the science cameras in several different wavelength bands on a\nday with low-dust conditions. We characterized the far wing straylight by\nfitting a model to the recorded intensities involving a multi-component\nstraylight PSF and the limb darkening of the disk. Results. The measured\nscattered light adds an approximately constant fraction of the local\ngranulation intensity to science images at any position on the disk. The\nfraction varied over the day but never exceeded a few percent. The PSFs have\nweak tails that extend to several solar radii but most of the scattered light\noriginates within ~1'. Conclusions. Far-wing scattered light contributes only a\nsmall amount of straylight in SST data. Other sources of straylight are\nprimarily responsible for the reduced contrast in SST images.\n", "  With the GREAT receiver at the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared\nAstronomy (SOFIA), nine massive molecular clumps have been observed in the\nammonia $3_{2+}- 2_{2-}$ line at 1.8~THz in a search for signatures of infall.\nThe sources were selected from the ATLASGAL submillimeter dust continuum survey\nof our Galaxy. Clumps with high masses covering a range of evolutionary stages\nbased on their infrared properties were chosen. The ammonia line was detected\nin all sources, leading to five new detections and one confirmation of a\nprevious detection of redshifted absorption in front of their strong THz\ncontinuum as a probe of infall in the clumps. These detections include two\nclumps embedded in infrared dark clouds. The measured velocity shifts of the\nabsorptions compared to optically thin \\CSEO\\ (3--2) emission are\n0.3--2.8~km/s, corresponding to fractions of 3\\%\\ to 30\\% of the free-fall\nvelocities of the clumps. The ammonia infall signature is compared with\ncomplementary data of different transitions of HCN, HNC, CS, and HCO$^+$, which\nare often used to probe infall via their blue-skewed line profiles. The best\nagreement with the ammonia results is found for the HCO$^+$ (4--3) transitions,\nbut the latter is still strongly blended with emission from associated\noutflows. This outflow signature is far less prominent in the THz ammonia\nlines, which confirms it as a powerful probe of infall in molecular clumps.\nInfall rates in the range from 0.3 to 16~$10^{-3}\\,M_\\odot/$yr were derived\nwith a tentative correlation with the virial parameters of the clumps. The new\nobservations show that infall on clump scales is ubiquitous through a wide\nrange of evolutionary stages, from $L/M$ covering about ten to several\nhundreds.\n", "  In high-resolution X-ray observations of the hot plasma in clusters of\ngalaxies significant structures caused by AGN feedback, mergers, and turbulence\ncan be detected. Many clusters have been observed by Chandra in great depth and\nat high resolution. Using archival data taken with the Chandra ACIS instrument\nthe aim was to study thermodynamic perturbations of the X-ray emitting plasma\nand to apply this to better understand the thermodynamic and dynamic state of\nthe intra cluster medium (ICM). We analysed deep observations for a sample of\n33 clusters with more than 100 ks of Chandra exposure each at distances between\nredshift 0.025 and 0.45. The combined exposure of the sample is 8 Ms. Fitting\nemission models to different regions of the extended X-ray emission we searched\nfor perturbations in density, temperature, pressure, and entropy of the hot\nplasma. For individual clusters we mapped the thermodynamic properties of the\nICM and measured their spread in circular concentric annuli. Comparing the\nspread of different gas quantities to high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we constrain the average Mach number regime of the sample to\nMach1D ~ 0.16 +- 0.07. In addition we found a tight correlation between\nmetallicity, temperature and redshift with an average metallicity of Z ~ 0.3 +-\n0.1 Z(solar). This study provides detailed perturbation measurements for a\nlarge sample of clusters which can be used to study turbulence and make\npredictions for future X-ray observatories like eROSITA, Astro-H, and Athena.\n", "  Natural and artificial honeycomb lattices are of great interest because the\nband structure of these lattices, if properly constructed, contains a Dirac\npoint. Such lattices occur naturally in the form of graphene and carbon\nnanotubes. They have been created in the lab in the form of semiconductor\n2DEGs, optical lattices, and photonic crystals. We show that, over a wide\nenergy range, gases (of electrons, atoms, or photons) that propagate through\nthese lattices are Lorentz gases and the corresponding classical dynamics is\nchaotic. Thus, honeycomb lattices are also of interest for understanding\neigenstate thermalization and the conductor-insulator transition due to dynamic\nAnderson localization.\n", "  Dark matter with strong self-interactions provides a compelling solution to\nseveral small-scale structure puzzles. Under the assumption that the coupling\nbetween dark matter and the Standard Model particles is suppressed, such\nstrongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs) allow for a successful thermal\nfreeze-out through N-to-N' processes, where N dark matter particles annihilate\nto N' of them. In the most common scenarios, where dark matter stability is\nguaranteed by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, the seemingly leading annihilating\nchannel, i.e. 3-to-2 process, is forbidden, so the 4-to-2 one dominate the\nproduction of the dark matter relic density. Moreover, cosmological\nobservations require that the dark matter sector is colder than the thermal\nbath of Standard Model particles, a condition that can be dynamically generated\nvia a small portal between dark matter and Standard Model particles, \\`a la\nfreeze-in. This scenario is exemplified in the context of the Singlet Scalar\ndark matter model.\n", "  A new iron-based superconductor, Lix(C6H16N2)yFe2-zSe2, with Tc = 38 K has\nsuccessfully been synthesized via the intercalation of lithium and\nhexamethylenediamine into FeSe. The superconducting transition has been\nconfirmed not only by magnetic susceptibility measurements but also by\nelectrical resistivity ones. The interlayer spacing, namely, the dicstance\nbetween neighboring Fe layers, d, is 16.225(5) $\\mathring{\\text{A}}$, which is\nthe largest among those of FeSe-based intercalation compounds. It has been\nfound that the dependence of Tc on d in FeSe-based intercalation\nsuperconductors appears domic.\n", "  We have succeeded in observing zero-resistivity in newly discovered\nintercalation superconductors Ax(C2H8N2)yFe2-zSe2 (A = Li, Na) with Tc = 45 K,\nusing the sintered pellet samples. The electrical resistivity, \\r{ho}, in the\nnormal state is metallic and Tconset defined in the $\\rho$ measurements, is as\nhigh as ~ 57 K. We have also investigated effects of the atmospheric exposure\nin Lix(C2H8N2)yFe2-zSe2. It has been found that both the crystal structure and\nsuperconductivity are maintained at least up to several days, indicating this\nmaterial is comparatively resistant to the atmospheric exposure.\n", "  We simulate the femtosecond laser induced desorption dynamics of a diatomic\nmolecule from a metal surface by including the effect of the electron and\nphonon excitations created by the laser pulse. Following previous models, the\nlaser induced surface excitation is treated through the two temperature model,\nwhile the multidimensional dynamics of the molecule is described by a classical\nLangevin equation, in which the friction and random forces account for the\naction of the heated electrons. In this work, we propose the additional use of\nthe generalized Langevin oscillator model to also include the effect of the\nenergy exchange between the molecule and the heated surface lattice in the\ndesorption dynamics. The model is applied to study the laser induced desorption\nof O$_2$ from the Ag(110) surface, making use of a six-dimensional potential\nenergy surface calculated within density functional theory. Our results reveal\nthe importance of the phonon mediated process and show that, depending on the\nvalue of the electronic density in the surroundings of the molecule adsorption\nsite, its inclusion can significantly enhance or reduce the desorption\nprobabilities.\n", "  We use the Pieri rules to recover the q-boson model and show it is equivalent\nto a discretized version of the relativistic Toda chain. We identify its semi\ninfinite transfer matrix and the corresponding Baxter Q-matrix with half vertex\noperators related by an {\\omega}-duality transformation. We observe that the\nscalar product of two higher spin XXZ wave functions can be expressed with a\nGaudin determinant.\n", "  The presence of debris disks around young main sequence stars hints at the\nexistence and structure of planetary systems. Millimeter-wavelength\nobservations probe large grains that trace the location of planetesimal belts.\nThe FEPS (Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems) $Spitzer$ Legacy survey\nof nearby young solar analogues yielded a sample of five debris disk-hosting\nstars with millimeter flux suitable for interferometric follow-up. We present\nobservations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Combined Array for\nResearch in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) at ~2\" resolution that spatially\nresolve the debris disks around these nearby ($d\\sim$50 pc) stars. Two of the\nfive disks (HD 377, HD 8907) are spatially resolved for the first time and one\n(HD 104860) is resolved at millimeter wavelengths for the first time. We\ncombine our new observations with archival SMA and Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) data to enable a uniform analysis of the\nfull five-object sample. We simultaneously model the broad-band photometric\ndata and resolved millimeter visibilities to constrain the dust temperatures\nand disk morphologies, and perform an MCMC analysis to fit for basic structural\nparameters. We find that the radii and widths of the cold outer belts exhibit\nproperties consistent with scaled-up versions of the Solar System's Kuiper\nBelt. All the disks exhibit characteristic grain sizes comparable to the\nblowout size, and all the resolved observations of emission from large dust\ngrains are consistent with an axisymmetric dust distribution to within the\nuncertainties. These results are consistent with comparable studies carried out\nat infrared wavelengths.\n", "  Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) output genuine random numbers based\nupon the uncertainty principle. A QRNG contains two parts in general --- a\nrandomness source and a readout detector. How to remove detector imperfections\nhas been one of the most important questions in practical randomness\ngeneration. We propose a simple solution, measurement-device-independent QRNG,\nwhich not only removes all detector side channels but is robust against losses.\nIn contrast to previous fully device-independent QRNGs, our scheme does not\nrequire high detector efficiency or nonlocality tests. Simulations show that\nour protocol can be implemented efficiently with a practical coherent state\nlaser and other standard optical components. The security analysis of our QRNG\nconsists mainly of two parts: measurement tomography and randomness\nquantification, where several new techniques are developed to characterize the\nrandomness associated with a positive-operator valued measure.\n", "  We observe trion emission from suspended carbon nanotubes where carriers are\nintroduced electrostatically using field-effect transistor structures. The\ntrion peak emerges below the $E_{11}$ emission energy at gate voltages that\ncoincide with the onset of bright exciton quenching. By investigating nanotubes\nwith various chiralities, we verify that the energy separation between the\nbright exciton peak and the trion peak becomes smaller for larger diameter\ntubes. Trion binding energies that are significantly larger compared to\nsurfactant-wrapped carbon nanotubes are obtained, and the difference is\nattributed to the reduced dielectric screening in suspended tubes.\n", "  R(O,F)BiS2 (R: La, Ce, Pr, Nd) superconducting single crystals with different\nF concentrations are grown using a CsCl/KCl flux. The obtained 1-2 mm-sized\nsingle crystals have a plate-like shape and are cleavable along the ab-plane.\nThe crystal structure is tetragonal of space group P4/nmm (#129). The as-grown\nsingle crystals exhibit superconductivity at around 3-5 K. The superconducting\ntransition temperature increases with decreasing the ionic radius of the R\nelement. The superconducting anisotropies of the R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are\nestimated to be 30-60 according to the effective mass model, whereas the\nanisotropies for Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are 13-21. The c-axis transport\nmeasurements of a single crystal of Pr(O,F)BiS2 under a magnetic field parallel\nto the ab-plane reveal a \"lock-in\" state attributed to the Josephson vortex\nflow. Furthermore, the Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals exhibit a magnetic order at\nthe temperature range of 5-7 K that apparently coexist with superconductivity\nbelow approximately 3 K.\n", "  We have analyzed primary $\\gamma$-ray spectra of the odd-odd $^{238}$Np\nnucleus extracted from $^{237}$Np($d,p\\gamma$)$^{238}$Np coincidence data\nmeasured at the Oslo Cyclotron Laboratory. The primary $\\gamma$ spectra cover\nan excitation-energy region of $0 \\leq E_i \\leq 5.4$ MeV, and allowed us to\nperform a detailed study of the $\\gamma$-ray strength as function of excitation\nenergy. Hence, we could test the validity of the generalized Brink-Axel\nhypothesis, which, in its strictest form, claims no excitation-energy\ndependence on the $\\gamma$ strength. In this work, using the available\nhigh-quality $^{238}$Np data, we show that the $\\gamma$-ray strength function\nis to a very large extent independent on the initial and final states. Thus,\nfor the first time, the generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis has been\nexperimentally verified for $\\gamma$ transitions between states in the\nquasi-continuum region, not only for specific collective resonances, but also\nfor the full strength below the neutron separation energy. Based on our\nfindings, the necessary criteria for the generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis to\nbe fulfilled are outlined.\n", "  We present a five-band Herschel study (100-500um) of three galaxy clusters at\nz~1.2 from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS).\nWith a sample of 120 spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members, we\ninvestigate the role of environment on galaxy properties utilizing the\nprojected cluster phase space (line-of-sight velocity versus clustercentric\nradius), which probes the time-averaged galaxy density to which a galaxy has\nbeen exposed. We divide cluster galaxies into phase-space bins of (r/r200) x\n(v/sigma_v), tracing a sequence of accretion histories in phase space. Stacking\noptically star-forming cluster members on the Herschel maps, we measure average\ninfrared star formation rates, and, for the first time in high-redshift galaxy\nclusters, dust temperatures for dynamically distinct galaxy\npopulations---namely, recent infalls and those that were accreted onto the\ncluster at an earlier epoch. Proceeding from the infalling to virialized\n(central) regions of phase space, we find a steady decrease in the specific\nstar formation rate and increase in the stellar age of star-forming cluster\ngalaxies. We perform a probability analysis to investigate all acceptable\ninfrared spectral energy distributions within the full parameter space and\nmeasure a ~4 sigma drop in the average dust temperature of cluster galaxies in\nan intermediate phase-space bin, compared to an otherwise flat trend with phase\nspace. We suggest one plausible quenching mechanism which may be consistent\nwith these trends, invoking ram-pressure stripping of the warmer dust for\ngalaxies within this intermediate accretion phase.\n", "  Motivated by the previously reported high orbital decay rate of the planet\nWASP-43b, eight newly transit light curves are obtained and presented. Together\nwith other data in literature, we perform a self-consistent timing analysis\nwith data covering a timescale of 1849 epochs. The results give an orbital\ndecay rate dP/dt = -0.02890795\\pm 0.00772547 sec/year, which is one order\nsmaller than previous values. This slow decay rate corresponds to a normally\nassumed theoretical value of stellar tidal dissipation factor. In addition,\nthrough the frequency analysis, the transit timing variations presented here\nare unlikely to be periodic, but could be signals of a slow orbital decay.\n", "  Several methods exist to convert near-infrared (NIR) stellar observations\ninto extinction maps. We present a new method based on NIR multiband\nobservations. The method uses a discretised version of the distribution of\nintrinsic stellar colours. A number of variations of the basic method are\ntested, and the results are compared to NICER calculations. When photometric\nerrors are large, the results are close to those of NICER method but some\nadvantages can be seen when the distribution of intrinsic colours cannot be\ndescribed well with a single covariance matrix. A priori information about\nrelative column density variations at sub-beam scales can result in a\nsignificant increase in accuracy. The results may be further improved by\nconsidering the magnitude dependence of the intrinsic colours. Thus, the new\nmethods are useful mostly when photometric errors are small, the distribution\nof intrinsic colours is well known, or one has prior knowledge of the\nsmall-scale structures.\n", "  We perform general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of dynamical\ncapture binary neutron star mergers, emphasizing the role played by the neutron\nstar spin. Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as\nwell as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.\nWe find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial\nneutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium. Furthermore, we find that the initial\nneutron star spin can strongly affect the already rich phenomenology in the\npostmerger gravitational wave signatures that arise from the oscillation modes\nof the hypermassive neutron star. In several of our simulations, the resulting\nhypermassive neutron star develops the one-arm ($m=1$) spiral instability, the\nmost pronounced cases being those with small but non-negligible neutron star\nspins. For long-lived hypermassive neutron stars, the presence of this\ninstability leads to improved prospects for detecting these events through\ngravitational waves, and thus may give information about the neutron star\nequation of state.\n", "  We present a study of stellar populations in a sample of\nspectroscopically-confirmed Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\n(LAEs) at $5.7<z<7$. These galaxies have deep optical and infrared images from\nSubaru, $HST$, and $Spitzer$/IRAC. We focus on a subset of 27 galaxies with\nIRAC detections, and characterize their stellar populations utilizing galaxy\nsynthesis models based on the multi-band data and secure redshifts. By\nincorporating nebular emission estimated from the observed Ly$\\alpha$ flux, we\nare able to break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxies\nwith prominent nebular emission and older galaxies with strong Balmer breaks.\nThe results show that our galaxies cover a wide range of ages from several to a\nfew hundred million years (Myr), and a wide range of stellar masses from\n$\\sim10^8$ to $\\sim10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$. These galaxies can be roughly divided\ninto an `old' subsample and a `young' subsample. The `old' subsample consists\nof galaxies older than 100 Myr, with stellar masses higher than $10^9$\n$M_{\\odot}$. The galaxies in the `young' subsample are younger than $\\sim$30\nMyr, with masses ranging between $\\sim10^8$ and $\\sim3\\times10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$.\nBoth subsamples display a correlation between stellar mass and star-formation\nrate (SFR), but with very different normalizations. The average specific SFR\n(sSFR) of the `old' subsample is 3--4 Gyr$^{-1}$, consistent with previous\nstudies of `normal' star-forming galaxies at $z\\ge6$. The average sSFR of the\n`young' subsample is an order of magnitude higher, likely due to starburst\nactivity. Our results also indicate little or no dust extinction in the\nmajority of the galaxies, as already suggested by their steep rest-frame UV\nslopes. Finally, LAEs and LBGs with strong Ly$\\alpha$ emission are\nindistinguishable in terms of age, stellar mass, and SFR.\n", "  We present density functional theory calculations of the phonon-limited\nmobility in n-type monolayer graphene, silicene and MoS$_2$. The material\nproperties, including the electron-phonon interaction, are calculated from\nfirst-principles. We provide a detailed description of the normalized full-band\nrelaxation time approximation for the linearized Boltzmann transport equation\n(BTE) that includes inelastic scattering processes. The bulk electron-phonon\ncoupling is evaluated by a supercell method. The method employed is fully\nnumerical and does therefore not require a semi-analytic treatment of part of\nthe problem and, importantly, it keeps the anisotropy information stored in the\ncoupling as well as the band structure. In addition, we perform calculations of\nthe low-field mobility and its dependence on carrier density and temperature to\nobtain a better understanding of transport in graphene, silicene and monolayer\nMoS$_2$. Unlike graphene, the carriers in silicene show strong interaction with\nthe out-of-plane modes. We find that graphene has more than an order of\nmagnitude higher mobility compared to silicene. For MoS$_2$, we obtain several\norders of magnitude lower mobilities in agreement with other recent theoretical\nresults. The simulations illustrate the predictive capabilities of the newly\nimplemented BTE solver applied in simulation tools based on first-principles\nand localized basis sets.\n", "  Context: The Mira variable LX Cyg showed a dramatic increase of its pulsation\nperiod in the recent decades and appears to undergo an important transition in\nits evolution. Aims: We aim at investigating the spectral type evolution of\nthis star over the recent decades as well as during one pulsation cycle in more\ndetail and discuss it in connection with the period evolution. Methods: We\npresent optical, near- and mid-IR low-resolution as well as optical\nhigh-resolution spectra to determine the current spectral type. The optical\nspectrum of LX Cyg has been followed for more than one pulsation cycle. Recent\nspectra are compared to archival spectra to trace the spectral type evolution\nand a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum is analysed for the presence of molecular and\ndust features. Furthermore, the current period is derived from AAVSO data.\nResults: It is found that the spectral type of LX Cyg changed from S to C\nsometime between 1975 and 2008. Currently, the spectral type C is stable during\na pulsation cycle. It is shown that spectral features typical of C-type stars\nare present in its spectrum from ~0.5 to 14 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$. An emission feature\nat 10.7 $\\mu{\\rm{m}}$ is attributed to SiC grains. The period of LX Cyg has\nincreased from ~460 d to ~580 d within only 20 years, and is stable now.\nConclusions: We conclude that the change in spectral type and the increase in\npulsation period happened simultaneously and are causally connected. Both a\nrecent thermal pulse (TP) and a simple surface temperature decrease appear\nunlikely to explain the observations. We therefore suggest that the underlying\nmechanism is related to a recent third dredge-up mixing event that brought up\ncarbon from the interior of the star, i.e. that a genuine abundance change\nhappened. We propose that LX Cyg is a rare transition type object that is\nuniquely suited to study the transformation from O- to C-rich stars in detail.\n", "  As part of the HI Arecibo Galaxy Environments Survey (AGES) we have observed\n5$\\times$4 degrees of sky centred on M33, reaching a limiting column density of\n$\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (line width of 10 km s$^{-1}$ and\nresolution 3.5\\arcmin). We particularly investigate the absence of optically\ndetected dwarf galaxies around M33, something that is contrary to galaxy\nformation models. We identify 22 discrete HI clouds, 11 of which are new\ndetections. The number of objects detected and their internal velocity\ndispersion distribution is consistent with expectations from standard galaxy\nformation models. However, the issue remains open as to whether the observed\nvelocity dispersions can be used as a measure of the HI clouds total mass i.e.\nare the velocities indicative of virialised structures or have they been\ninfluenced by tidal interactions with other structures in the Local Group? We\nidentify one particularly interesting HI cloud, AGESM33-31, that has many of\nthe characteristics of HI distributed in the disc of a galaxy, yet there is no\nknown optical counterpart associated with it. This object has a total HI mass\nof $1.22 \\times 10^{7}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and a diameter of 18 kpc if at the distance\nof M33 ($D_{M33}=840$ kpc). However, we also find that there are numerous other\nHI clouds in this region of sky that have very similar velocities and so it is\nplausible that all these clouds are actually associated with debris from the\nMagellanic stream.\n", "  The coherent production of the nP states of the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ atoms\n($A_{2\\pi}$) in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions is considered as a\npossible source of the $A_{2\\pi}(nP)$ beam for the pionium Lamb-shift\nmeasurement. A general expression for estimation of the $A_{2\\pi}(nP)$ yield is\nderived in the framework of the equivalent photon approximation.\n", "  Control over nuclear spin fluctuations is essential for processes that rely\non preserving the quantum state of an embedded system. For this purpose,\nsqueezing is a viable alternative, so far that has not been properly exploited\nfor the nuclear spins. Of particular relevance in solids is the electric\nquadrupole interaction (QI), which operates on nuclei having spin higher than\n1/2. In its general form, QI involves an electric field gradient (EFG)\nbiaxiality term. Here, we show that as this EFG biaxiality increases, it\nenables continuous tuning of single-particle squeezing from the one-axis\ntwisting to the two-axis countertwisting limits. A detailed analysis of QI\nsqueezing is provided, exhibiting the intricate consequences of EFG biaxiality.\nThe initial states over the Bloch sphere are mapped out to identify those\nfavorable for fast initial squeezing, or for prolonged squeezings. Furthermore,\nthe evolution of squeezing in the presence of a phase-damping channel and an\nexternal magnetic field are investigated. We observe that dephasing drives\ntoward an anti-squeezed terminal state, the degree of which increases with the\nspin angular momentum. Finally, QI squeezing in the limiting case of a\ntwo-dimensional EFG with a perpendicular magnetic field is discussed, which is\nof importance for two-dimensional materials, and the associated beat patterns\nin squeezing are revealed.\n", "  Despite intensive studies of kink oscillations of coronal loops in the last\ndecade, a large scale statistically significant investigation of the\noscillation parameters has not been made using data from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO).\n  We carry out a statistical study of kink oscillations using Extreme\nUltra-Violet (EUV) imaging data from a previously compiled catalogue.\n  We analysed 58 kink oscillation events observed by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) onboard SDO during its first four years of operation\n(2010-2014). Parameters of the oscillations, including the initial apparent\namplitude, period, length of the oscillating loop, and damping are studied for\n120 individual loop oscillations.\n  Analysis of the initial loop displacement and oscillation amplitude leads to\nthe conclusion that the initial loop displacement prescribes the initial\namplitude of oscillation in general. The period is found to scale with the loop\nlength, and a linear fit of the data cloud gives a kink speed of Ck\n=(1330+/-50) km s-1 . The main body of the data corresponds to kink speeds in\nthe range Ck =(800-3300) km s-1. Measurements of 52 exponential damping times\nwere made, and it was noted that at least 22 of the damping profiles may be\nbetter approximated by a combination of non-exponential and exponential\nprofiles, rather than a purely exponential damping envelope. There are an\nadditional 10 cases where the profile appears to be purely non-exponential, and\nno damping time was measured. A scaling of the exponential damping time with\nthe period is found, following the previously established linear scaling\nbetween these two parameters.\n", "  Context. The presence of a small-mass planet (M$_p<$0.1\\,M$_{Jup}$) seems, to\ndate, not to depend on metallicity, however, theoretical simulations have shown\nthat stars with subsolar metallicities may be favoured for harbouring smaller\nplanets. A large, dedicated survey of metal-poor stars with the HARPS\nspectrograph has thus been carried out to search for Neptunes and super-Earths.\nAims. In this paper, we present the analysis of \\object{HD175607}, an old G6\nstar with metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.62. We gathered 119 radial velocity\nmeasurements in 110 nights over a time span of more than nine years. Methods.\nThe radial velocities were analysed using Lomb-Scargle periodograms, a genetic\nalgorithm, a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, and a Gaussian processes\nanalysis. The spectra were also used to derive stellar properties. Several\nactivity indicators were analysed to study the effect of stellar activity on\nthe radial velocities. Results. We find evidence for the presence of a small\nNeptune-mass planet (M$_{p}\\sin i = 8.98\\pm1.10$\\,M$_{\\oplus}$) orbiting this\nstar with an orbital period $P = 29.01\\pm0.02$\\, days in a slightly eccentric\norbit ($e=0.11\\pm0.08$). The period of this Neptune is close to the estimated\nrotational period of the star. However, from a detailed analysis of the radial\nvelocities together with the stellar activity, we conclude that the best\nexplanation of the signal is indeed the presence of a planetary companion\nrather than stellar related. An additional longer period signal ($P\\sim\n1400$\\,d) is present in the data, for which more measurements are needed to\nconstrain its nature and its properties. Conclusions. HD\\,175607 is the most\nmetal-poor FGK dwarf with a detected low-mass planet amongst the currently\nknown planet hosts. This discovery may thus have important consequences for\nplanet formation and evolution theories.\n", "  Besides black holes, the phase space of three-dimensional massive gravity\nabout Warped-Anti de Sitter (WAdS) space contains solutions that decay\nexponentially in time. They describe evanescent graviton configurations that,\nwhile governed by a wave equation with non-vanishing effective mass, do not\ncarry net gravitational energy. Explicit examples of such solutions have been\nfound in the case of Topologically Massive Gravity; here, we generalize them to\na much more general ghost-free massive deformation, with the difference being\nthat the decay rate gets corrected due to the presence of higher-order terms.\n", "  Observed at z = 4.601 and with L_bol = 3.5 x 10^14 Lsun, W2246-0526 is the\nmost luminous galaxy known in the Universe, and hosts a deeply-buried active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN)/super-massive black hole (SMBH). Discovered using the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), W2246-0526 is classified as a Hot\nDust Obscured Galaxy (Hot DOG), based on its luminosity and dust temperature.\nHere we present spatially resolved ALMA [CII]157.7um observations of\nW2246-0526, providing unique insight into the kinematics of its interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The measured [CII]-to-far-infrared ratio is ~2 x 10^-4, implying\nISM conditions that compare only with the most obscured, compact starbursts and\nAGN in the local Universe today. The spatially resolved [CII] line is\nstrikingly uniform and very broad, 500-600 km/s wide, extending throughout the\nentire galaxy over about 2.5 kpc, with modest shear. Such a large, homogeneous\nvelocity dispersion indicates a highly turbulent medium. W2246-0526 is unstable\nin terms of the energy and momentum that are being injected into the ISM,\nstrongly suggesting that the gas is being blown away from the system\nisotropically, likely reflecting a cathartic state on its road to becoming an\nun-obscured quasar. W2246-0526 provides an extraordinary laboratory to study\nand model the properties and kinematics of gas in an extreme environment under\nstrong feedback, at a time when the Universe was 1/10 of its current age: a\nsystem pushing the limits that can be reached during galaxy formation.\n", "  We aim to determine the intrinsic variety, at a given mass, of the properties\nof the intracluster medium in clusters of galaxies. This requires a cluster\nsample selected independently of the intracluster medium content for which\nreliable masses and subsequent X-ray data can be obtained. We present one such\nsample, consisting of 34 galaxy clusters selected independently of their X-ray\nproperties in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe and mostly with $14<\\log\nM_{500}/M_\\odot \\lesssim 14.5$, where masses are dynamically estimated. We\ncollected the available X-ray observations from the archives and then observed\nthe remaining clusters with the low-background Swift X-ray telescope, which is\nextremely useful for sampling a cluster population expected to have low surface\nbrightness. We found that clusters display a large range (up to a factor 50) in\nX-ray luminosities within $r_{500}$ at a given mass, whether or not the central\nemission ($r<0.15 r_{500}$) is excised, unveiling a wider cluster population\nthan seen in Sunayev-Zeldovich surveys or inferred from the population seen in\nX-ray surveys. The measured dispersion is $0.5$ dex in $L_X$ at a given mass.\n", "  Using the most recent releases of WISE and Planck data, we perform updated\nmeasurements of the bias and typical dark matter halo mass of infrared-selected\nobscured and unobscured quasars, using the angular autocorrelation function and\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing cross-correlations. Since our recent\nwork of this kind, the WISE Allwise catalogue was released with improved\nphotometry, and the Planck mission was completed and released improved\nproducts. These new data provide a more reliable measurement of the quasar bias\nand provide an opportunity to explore the role of changing survey pipelines in\nresults downstream. We present a comparison of IR color-selected quasars, split\ninto obscured and unobscured populations based on optical-IR colors, selected\nfrom two versions of the WISE data. Which combination of data is used impacts\nthe final results, particularly for obscured quasars, both because of\nmitigation of some systematics and because the newer catalogue provides a\nslightly different sample. We show that Allwise data is superior in several\nways, though there may be some systematic trends with Moon contamination that\nwere not present in the previous catalogue. We opt currently for the most\nconservative sample that meet our selection criteria in both the previous and\nnew WISE catalogues. We measure a higher bias and halo mass for obscured\nquasars ($b_{\\textrm{obsc}} \\sim 2.1$, $b_{\\textrm{unob}} \\sim 1.8$) --- at\nodds with simple orientation models --- but at a reduced significance\n($\\sim$1.5$\\sigma$) as compared to our work with previous survey data.\n", "  In order to investigate the spatial distribution of the ICM temperature in\ngalaxy clusters in a quantitative way and probe the physics behind, we analyze\nthe X-ray spectra of a sample of 50 galaxy clusters, which were observed with\nthe Chandra ACIS instrument in the past 15 years, and measure the radial\ntemperature profiles out to $0.45r_{500}$. We construct a physical model that\ntakes into account the effects of gravitational heating, thermal history (such\nas radiative cooling, AGN feedback, and thermal conduction) and work done via\ngas compression, and use it to fit the observed temperature profiles by running\nBayesian regressions. The results show that in all cases our model provides an\nacceptable fit at the 68% confidence level. To further validate this model we\nselect nine clusters that have been observed with both Chandra (out to $\\gtrsim\n0.3r_{500}$) and Suzaku (out to $\\gtrsim 1.5r_{500}$), fit their Chandra\nspectra with our model, and compare the extrapolation of the best-fits with the\nSuzaku measurements. We find that the model profiles agree with the Suzaku\nresults very well in seven clusters. In the rest two clusters the difference\nbetween the model and observation is possibly caused by local thermal\nsubstructures. Our study also implies that for most of the clusters the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is safe out to at least $0.5r_{500}$, and\nthe non-gravitational interactions between dark matter and its luminous\ncounterpart is consistent with zero.\n", "  We compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) in 2200\npresent-day central galaxies with M_star > 10^10 M_Sun from the 100 Mpc EAGLE\nReference simulation to observational data. Atomic hydrogen fractions are\ncorrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfer\nsimulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or a\ntheoretical prescription from the literature. The resulting neutral hydrogen\nfractions, M_(HI+H2)/M_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex for\ngalaxies with M_star between 10^10 and 10^11 M_Sun. Our fiducial, empirical H2\nmodel based on gas pressure results in galactic HI mass fractions, M_HI/M_star,\nthat agree with observations from the GASS survey to better than 0.3 dex, but\nthe alternative theoretical H2 formula leads to a negative offset in\nM_HI/M_star of up to 0.5 dex. Visual inspection reveals that most HI disks in\nsimulated HI-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recent\naccretion events. Many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large HI\nholes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementation\nin EAGLE. The HI mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but\n16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holes\nin the HI disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1\ndex). The presence of large HI holes also makes the radial HI surface density\nprofiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \\Sigma_HI > 1 M_Sun pc^-2 (by a\nfactor of <~ 2 compared to data from the Bluedisk survey). In the outer region\n(\\Sigma_HI < 1 M_Sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively with\nobservations. Scaled by HI size, the simulated profiles of HI-rich (M_HI >\n10^9.8 M_Sun) and control galaxies (10^9.1 M_Sun > M_HI > 10^9.8 M_Sun) follow\neach other closely, as observed. (Abridged)\n", "  A significant fraction of main sequence stars observed interferometrically in\nthe near infrared have slightly extended components that have been attributed\nto very hot dust. To match the spectrum appears to require the presence of\nlarge numbers of very small (< 200 nm in radius) dust grains. However,\nparticularly for the hotter stars, it has been unclear how such grains can be\nretained close to the star against radiation pressure force. We find that the\nexpected weak stellar magnetic fields are sufficient to trap nm-sized dust\ngrains in epicyclic orbits for a few weeks or longer, sufficient to account for\nthe hot excess emission. Our models provide a natural explanation for the\nrequirement that the hot excess dust grains be smaller than 200 nm. They also\nsuggest that magnetic trapping is more effective for rapidly rotating stars,\nconsistent with the average vsini measurements of stars with hot excesses being\nlarger (at about 2 sigma) than those for stars without such excesses.\n", "  We construct spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes with a generalized\nChaplygin gas at the throat, in Born-Infeld electrodynamics coupled to Einstein\ngravity. We analyze their stability under radial perturbations.\n", "  We examine the shadow of a rotating Kaluza-Klein black hole in Einstein\ngravity coupled to a Maxwell field and a dilaton. The size and the shape of the\nshadow depend on the mass, the charge, and the angular momentum of the compact\nobject. For a given mass, the size increases with the rotation parameter and\ndecreases with the electric charge. The distortion with respect to the non\nrotating case grows with the charge and the rotation parameter. For fixed\nvalues of these parameters, the shadow is slightly larger and less deformed\nthan in the Kerr-Newman case.\n", "  The distortion of the spacetime structure in the surroundings of black holes\naffects the trajectories of light rays. As a consequence, black holes can act\nas gravitational lenses. Observations of type Ia supernovas, show that our\nUniverse is in accelerated expansion. The usual explanation is that the\nUniverse is filled with a negative pressure fluid called dark energy, which\naccounts for 70 % of its total density, which can be modeled by a\nself-interacting scalar field with a potential. We consider a class of\nspherically symmetric regular phantom black holes as gravitational lenses. We\nstudy large deflection angles, using the strong deflection limit, corresponding\nto an asymptotic logarithmic approximation. In this case, photons passing close\nto the photon sphere of the black hole experiment several loops around it\nbefore they emerge towards the observer, giving place to two infinite sets of\nrelativistic images. Within this limit, we find analytical expressions for the\npositions and the magnifications of these images. We discuss the results\nobtained and make a comparison with the Schwarzschild and Brans-Dicke solutions\nfor the case of the galactic center supermassive black hole.\n", "  Accurate measurements of the physical characteristics of a large number of\nexoplanets are useful to strongly constrain theoretical models of planet\nformation and evolution, which lead to the large variety of exoplanets and\nplanetary-system configurations that have been observed. We present a study of\nthe planetary systems WASP-45 and WASP-46, both composed of a main-sequence\nstar and a close-in hot Jupiter, based on 29 new high-quality light curves of\ntransits events. In particular, one transit of WASP-45 b and four of WASP-46 b\nwere simultaneously observed in four optical filters, while one transit of\nWASP-46 b was observed with the NTT obtaining precision of 0.30 mmag with a\ncadence of roughly three minutes. We also obtained five new spectra of WASP-45\nwith the FEROS spectrograph. We improved by a factor of four the measurement of\nthe radius of the planet WASP-45 b, and found that WASP-46 b is slightly less\nmassive and smaller than previously reported. Both planets now have a more\naccurate measurement of the density (0.959 +\\- 0.077 \\rho Jup instead of 0.64\n+\\- 0.30 \\rho Jup for WASP-45 b, and 1.103 +\\- 0.052 \\rho Jup instead of 0.94\n+\\- 0.11 \\rho Jup for WASP-46 b). We tentatively detected radius variations\nwith wavelength for both planets, in particular in the case of WASP-45 b we\nfound a slightly larger absorption in the redder bands than in the bluer ones.\nNo hints for the presence of an additional planetary companion in the two\nsystems were found either from the photometric or radial velocity measurements.\n", "  Spatially averaged (> 50'') EUV spectral lines in the transition region of\nsolar quiet regions are known to be redshifted. Because the mechanism\nunderlying this phenomenon is unclear, we require additional physical\ninformation on the lower corona for limiting the theoretical models. To acquire\nthis information, we measured the Doppler shifts over a wide coronal\ntemperature range (log T[K]=5.7--6.3) using the spectroscopic data taken by the\nHinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer. By analyzing the data over the center-to-limb\nvariations covering the meridian from the south to the north pole, we\nsuccessfully measured the velocity to an accuracy of 3 km/s. Below log T[K] =\n6.0, the Doppler shifts of the emission lines were almost zero with an error of\n1--3 km/s; above this temperature, they were blueshifted with a gradually\nincreasing magnitude, reaching - 6.3 +/- 2.1 km/s at log T[K]=6.25.\n", "  Context. The analysis of observations of circumstellar disks around young\nstellar objects is often based on models with a smooth and continuous density\ndistribution. However, spatially resolved observations with increasing angular\nresolution and dynamical models indicate that circumstellar disks are\nhighlystructured.\n  Aims. We investigate the influence of different clumpy density distributions\non selected physical properties and observable characteristics of circumstellar\ndisks.\n  Methods. Based on radiative transfer modelling we calculate the temperature\nstructure of the disk and simulate observational quantities in the thermal\nre-emission and scattering regime. We compare our results to those obtained for\na smooth and continuous density distribution to quantify the influence of\nclumps on physical parameters and observable quantities of circumstellar disks.\n  Results. Within the considered model space, the clumpiness has a significant\nimpact on the disk temperature distribution. For instance, in the transition\nregion from the upper disk layers to the disk interior, it causes a decrease of\nthe mean temperature by up to 12 K. In addition, circumstellar disks with\nclumpy density distributions feature a lower spectral index in the submm/mm\nrange of the SED. As a consequence of the lower spectral index, the dust grain\nsize derived from the submm/mm-slope of the SED may be overestimated, if the\ninhomogeneity of the disk density distribution is not taken into account.\nFurthermore, the scattered light brightness distribution of clumpy disks shows\na steeper radial decrease. Additionally, clumpy density distributions change\nthe degree of polarization of the scattered light in the optical.\n", "  Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies form a major class of galaxies, and are\ncharacterized by low disc surface density and low star formation rate. These\nare known to be dominated by dark matter halo from the innermost regions. Here\nwe study the role of dark matter halo on the grand-design, $m=2$, spiral modes\nin a galactic disc by carrying out a global mode analysis in the WKB\napproximation. The Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule is used to determine how\nmany discrete global spiral modes are permitted. First a typical superthin LSB\ngalaxy, UGC 7321 is studied by taking only the galactic disc, modelled as\nfluid; and then the disc embedded in a dark matter halo. We find that both\ncases permit the existence of global spiral modes. This is in contrast to\nearlier results where the inclusion of dark matter halo was shown to nearly\nfully suppress local, swing-amplified spiral features. Although technically\nglobal modes are permitted in the fluid model as shown here, we argue that due\nto lack of tidal interactions, these are not triggered in LSB galaxies. For\ncomparison, we carried out a similar analysis for the Galaxy, for which the\ndark matter halo does not dominate in the inner regions. We show that here too\nthe dark matter halo has little effect, hence the disc embedded in a halo is\nalso able to support global modes. The derived pattern speed of the global mode\nagrees fairly well with the observed value for the Galaxy.\n", "  We compare the science capabilities of different eLISA mission designs,\nincluding four-link (two-arm) and six-link (three-arm) configurations with\ndifferent arm lengths, low-frequency noise sensitivities and mission durations.\nFor each of these configurations we consider a few representative massive black\nhole formation scenarios. These scenarios are chosen to explore two physical\nmechanisms that greatly affect eLISA rates, namely (i) black hole seeding, and\n(ii) the delays between the merger of two galaxies and the merger of the black\nholes hosted by those galaxies. We assess the eLISA parameter estimation\naccuracy using a Fisher matrix analysis with spin-precessing, inspiral-only\nwaveforms. We quantify the information present in the merger and ringdown by\nrescaling the inspiral-only Fisher matrix estimates using the signal-to-noise\nratio from non-precessing inspiral-merger-ringdown phenomenological waveforms,\nand from a reduced set of precessing numerical relativity/post-Newtonian hybrid\nwaveforms. We find that all of the eLISA configurations considered in our study\nshould detect some massive black hole binaries. However, configurations with\nsix links and better low-frequency noise will provide much more information on\nthe origin of black holes at high redshifts and on their accretion history, and\nthey may allow the identification of electromagnetic counterparts to massive\nblack hole mergers.\n", "  One of the most unusual aspects of the X-ray binary LSI +61 303 is that at\neach orbit (P1=26.4960 \\pm 0.0028 d) one radio outburst occurs whose amplitude\nis modulated with Plong, a long-term period of more than 4 yr. It is still not\nclear whether the compact object of the system or the companion Be star is\nresponsible for the long-term modulation. We study here the stability of Plong.\nSuch a stability is expected if Plong is due to periodic (P2) Doppler boosting\nof periodic (P1) ejections from the accreting compact object of the system. On\nthe contrary it is not expected if Plong is related to variations in the mass\nloss of the companion Be star. We built a database of 36.8 yr of radio\nobservations of LSI +61 303 covering more than 8 long-term cycles. We performed\ntiming and correlation analysis. In addition to the two dominant features at P1\nand P2, the timing analysis gives a feature at Plong=1628 \\pm 48 days. The\ndetermined value of Plong agrees with the beat of the two dominant features,\ni.e. Pbeat=1/(\\nu1 -\\nu2)=1626 \\pm 68 d. The correlation coefficient of the\nradio data oscillates at multiples of Pbeat. Cycles in varying Be stars change\nin length and disappear after 2-3 cycles following the well-studied case of the\nbinary system zeta Tau. On the contrary, in LSI +61 303 the long-term period is\nquite stable and repeats itself over the available 8 cycles. The long-term\nmodulation in LSI +61 303 accurately reflects the beat of periodical Doppler\nboosting (induced by precession) with the periodicity of the ejecta. The peak\nof the long-term modulation occurs at the coincidence of the maximum number of\nejected particles with the maximum Doppler boosting of their emission; this\ncoincidence occurs every 1/(\\nu1 - \\nu2) and creates the long-term modulation\nobserved in LSI +61 303.\n", "  Rotation period clustering in prograde/retrograde rotators might indicate the\npreliminary indication of the Slivan state in the Koronis family as a result of\nthe YORP effect. We follow the general scenario of dispersion in semimajor axis\nof the asteroid family members to separate prograde and retrograde rotators in\nthe Koronis family. From the available rotation periods obtained from PTF/iPTF,\nwe can not found the rotation period clustering of objects with H grater than\n12 mag in the Koronis family. This could be the result of the intermittent\ncollisional process of small asteroids (D less than ~20 km) which leads to\nastray Yarkovsky drifting. Measurement of the pole orientations of our sample\nwill verify our preliminary result and validate our method.\n", "  The Galaxy's population of High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) may include a\nsubpopulation that is confined by dark matter minihalos and falling toward the\nGalactic disk. We present the first magnetohydrodynamic simulational study of\ndark matter-dominated HVCs colliding with a weakly magnetized galactic disk.\nOur HVCs have baryonic masses of $5 \\times 10^6\\,$M$_{\\odot}$ and dark matter\nminihalo masses of 0, $3 \\times 10^8$, or $1 \\times 10^9\\,$M$_{\\odot}$. They\nare modeled on the Smith Cloud, which is said to have collided with the disk 70\nMyr ago. We find that, in all cases, the cloud's collision with the galactic\ndisk creates a hole in the disk, completely disperses the cloud, and forms a\nbubble-shaped structure on the far side of the disk. In contrast, when present,\nthe dark matter minihalo continues unimpeded along its trajectory. Later, as\nthe minihalo passes through the bubble structure and galactic halo, it accretes\nup to $6.0 \\times 10^5\\,$M$_{\\odot}$ in baryonic material, depending on the\nstrengths of the magnetic field and minihalo gravity. These simulations suggest\nthat if the Smith Cloud is associated with a dark matter minihalo and collided\nwith the Galactic disk, the minihalo has accreted the observed gas. However, if\nthe Smith Cloud is dark matter-free, it is on its first approach toward the\ndisk. These simulations also suggest that the dark matter is most concentrated\neither at the head of the cloud or near the cloud, depending upon the strength\nof the magnetic field, a point that could inform indirect dark matter searches.\n", "  Lambda Boo stars are predominately A-type stars with solar abundant C, N, O,\nand S, but up to 2 dex underabundances of refractory elements. The stars'\nunusual surface abundances could be due to a selective accretion of volatile\ngas over dust. It has been proposed that there is a correlation between the\nLambda Boo phenomenon and IR-excesses which are the result of a debris disk or\ninterstellar medium (ISM) interaction providing the accreting material. We\nobserve 70 or 100 and 160 $\\mu$m excess emission around 9 confirmed Lambda Boo\nstars with the Herschel Space Observatory, to differentiate whether the dust\nemission is from a debris disk or an ISM bow wave. We find that 3/9 stars\nobserved host well resolved debris disks. While the remaining 6/9 are not\nresolved, they are inconsistent with an ISM bow wave based on the dust emission\nbeing more compact for its temperature and predicted bow wave models produce\nhotter emission than what is observed. We find the incidence of bright\nIR-excesses around Lambda Boo stars is higher than normal A-stars. To explain\nthis given our observations, we explore Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag as a\nmechanism of accretion from a debris disk but find it insufficient. As an\nalternative, we propose the correlation is due to higher dynamical activity in\nthe disks currently underway. Large impacts of planetesimals or a higher influx\nof comets could provide enough volatile gas for accretion. Further study on the\ntransport of circumstellar material in relation to the abundance anomalies are\nrequired to explain the phenomenon through external accretion.\n", "  We analyze the velocity dispersions of individual HI and CO profiles in a\nnumber of nearby galaxies from the high-resolution HERACLES CO and THINGS HI\nsurveys. Focusing on regions with bright CO emission, we find a CO dispersion\nvalue: 7.3 $\\pm$ 1.7 km/s. The corresponding HI dispersion is 11.7 $\\pm$ 2.3\nkm/s, yielding a mean HI/CO dispersion ratio of 1.4 $\\pm$ 0.2, independent of\nradius. We find that the CO velocity dispersion increases towards lower peak\nfluxes. This is consistent with previous work where we showed that when using\nspectra averaged (\"stacked\") over large areas, larger values for the CO\ndispersion are found, and a lower dispersion ratio: 1.0 $\\pm$ 0.2. The stacking\nmethod is more sensitive to low-level diffuse emission, whereas individual\nprofiles trace narrow-line, GMC-dominated, bright emission. These results\nprovide further evidence that disk galaxies contain not only a thin, low\nvelocity dispersion, high density CO disk that is dominated by GMCs, but also a\nfainter, higher dispersion, diffuse disk component.\n", "  In decomposing the HI rotation curves of disc galaxies, it is necessary to\nbreak a degeneracy between the gravitational fields of the disc and the dark\nhalo by estimating the disc surface density. This is done by combining\nmeasurements of the vertical velocity dispersion of the disc with the disc\nscale height. The vertical velocity dispersion of the discs is measured from\nabsorption lines (near the V-band) of near-face-on spiral galaxies, with the\nlight coming from a mixed population of giants of all ages. However, the scale\nheights for these galaxies are estimated statistically from near-IR surface\nphotometry of edge-on galaxies. The scale height estimate is therefore\ndominated by a population of older (> 2 Gyr) red giants. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the importance of measuring the velocity dispersion for the same\nolder population of stars that is used to estimate the vertical scale height.\nWe present an analysis of the vertical kinematics of K-giants in the solar\nvicinity. We find the vertical velocity distribution best fit by two components\nwith dispersions of 9.6 +/- 0.5 km/s and 18.6 +/- 1.0 km/s, which we interpret\nas the dispersions of the young and old disc populations respectively.\nCombining the (single) measured velocity dispersion of the total young + old\ndisc population (13.0 +/- 0.1 km/s) with the scale height estimated for the\nolder population would underestimate the disc surface density by a factor of ~\n2. Such a disc would have a peak rotational velocity that is only 70% of that\nfor the maximal disc, thus making it appear submaximal.\n", "  We present an analytically exact scheme of unraveling a multitude of flat,\ndispersionless photonic bands in a kagome waveguide strip where each elementary\nplaquette hosts a deterministic fractal geometry of arbitrary size. The number\nof non-dispersive eigenmodes grows as higher and higher order fractal geometry\nis embedded in the kagome motif. Such eigenmodes are found to be localized with\nfinite support in the kagome strip and exhibit a hierarchy of localization\nareas. The onset of localization can, in principle, be delayed in space by an\nappropriate choice of frequency of the incident wave. The length scale at which\nthe onset of localization for each mode occurs, can be tuned at will as\nprescribed here using a real space renormalization method. Conventional methods\nof extracting the non-dispersive modes in such geometrically frustrated\nlattices fail as a non-translationally invariant fractal decorates the unit\ncells in the transverse direction. The scheme presented here circumvents this\ndifficulty, and thus may inspire the experimentalists to design similar fractal\nincorporated kagome or Lieb class of lattices to observe a multifractal\ndistribution of flat photonic bands.\n", "  We study theoretically electromagnetic radiation emitted by inelastic\nCooper-pair tunneling. We consider a dc-voltage-biased superconducting\ntransmission line terminated by a Josephson junction. We show that the\ngenerated continuous-mode electromagnetic field can be expressed as a function\nof the time-dependent current across the Josephson junction. The leading-order\nexpansion in the tunneling coupling, similar to the \"$P(E)$-theory\", has\npreviously been used to investigate the photon emission statistics in the limit\nof sequential (independent) Cooper-pair tunneling. By explicitly evaluating the\nsystem characteristics up to the fourth-order in the tunneling coupling, we\naccount for dynamics between consecutively tunneling Cooper pairs. Within this\napproach we investigate how temporal correlations in the charge transport can\nbe seen in the first- and second-order coherences of the emitted microwave\nradiation.\n", "  The mass distribution of the Galactic disk is constructed from the terminal\nvelocity curve and the mass discrepancy-acceleration relation. Mass models\nnumerically quantifying the detailed surface density profiles are tabulated.\nFor $R_0 = 8$ kpc, the models have stellar mass $5 < M_* < 6 \\times 10^{10}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, scale length $2.0 \\le R_d \\le 2.9$ kpc, LSR circular velocity $222\n\\le \\Theta_0 \\le 233$ km s$^{-1}$, and solar circle stellar surface density $34\n\\le \\Sigma_d(R_0) \\le 61$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. The present inter-arm location\nof the solar neighborhood may have a somewhat lower stellar surface density\nthan average for the solar circle. The Milky Way appears to be a normal spiral\ngalaxy that obeys scaling relations like the Tully-Fisher relation, the\nsize-mass relation, and the disk maximality-surface brightness relation. The\nstellar disk is maximal, and the spiral arms are massive. The bumps and wiggles\nin the terminal velocity curve correspond to known spiral features (e.g., the\nCentaurus Arm is a $\\sim 50\\%$ overdensity). The rotation curve switches\nbetween positive and negative over scales of hundreds of parsecs. The rms\namplitude $\\langle$$|$$dV/dR$$|^2$$\\rangle$$^{1/2} \\approx 14$ km s$^{-1}$\nkpc$^{-1}$, implying that commonly neglected terms in the Jeans equations may\nbe non-negligible. The spherically averaged local dark matter density is\n$\\rho_{0,DM} \\approx 0.009$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ (0.3 GeV cm$^{-3}$).\nAdiabatic compression of the dark matter halo may help reconcile the Milky Way\nwith the $c$-$V_{200}$ relation expected in $\\Lambda$CDM while also helping to\nmitigate the too big to fail problem, but it remains difficult to reconcile the\ninner bulge/bar dominated region with a cuspy halo. We note that NGC 3521 is a\nnear twin to the Milky Way, having a similar luminosity, scale length, and\nrotation curve.\n", "  The presence and abundance of the short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) $^{26}$Al\nand $^{60}$Fe during the formation of the Solar System is difficult to explain\nunless the Sun formed in the vicinity of one or more massive star(s) that\nexploded as supernovae. Two different scenarios have been proposed to explain\nthe delivery of SLRs to the protosolar nebula: (i) direct pollution of the\nprotosolar disc by supernova ejecta and (ii) the formation of the Sun in a\nsequential star formation event in which supernovae shockwaves trigger further\nstar formation which is enriched in SLRs.\n  The sequentially triggered model has been suggested as being more\nastrophysically likely than the direct pollution scenario. In this paper we\ninvestigate this claim by analysing a combination of $N$-body and SPH\nsimulations of star formation. We find that sequential star formation would\nresult in large age spreads (or even bi-modal age distributions for spatially\ncoincident events) due to the dynamical relaxation of the first star-formation\nevent(s). Secondly, we discuss the probability of triggering spatially and\ntemporally discrete populations of stars and find this to be only possible in\nvery contrived situations. Taken together, these results suggest that the\nformation of the Solar System in a triggered star formation event is as\nimprobable, if not more so, than the direct pollution of the protosolar disc by\na supernova.\n", "  The magnetic properties of Nd${}_2$Fe${}_{14}$B (NFB)/transition metal (TM =\nFe, Co) multilayer systems are studied on the basis of first-principles density\nfunctional calculations. We optimize the model structure under a variety of\ncrystallographic alignments of the NFB layer, and analyze the mechanism of\ninterface magnetic coupling. Improvements in remanent magnetization compared to\nthat of single NFB are observed in NFB(001)/Fe, NFB(110)/Fe, and NFB(100)/Co.\nOn the other hand, in NFB(100)/Fe, remanence degradation due to the\nanti-parallel magnetization alignment between NFB and Fe layers is observed. In\nthis system, which has the shortest optimized interlayer distance among all\nconsidered systems, an itinerant electron magnetism is required around the\ninterface to lower the total energy, and accordingly, anti-ferromagnetic\ncoupling is preferred. The significant difference in property between\nNFB(100)/Fe and NFB(100)/Co is attributed to the difference between their\ninterface structures, optimized interlayer distances, and magnetic stiffness of\nTM layers.\n", "  We analyzed light curves of five neon novae, QU Vul, V351 Pup, V382 Vel, V693\nCrA, and V1974 Cyg, and determined their white dwarf (WD) masses and distance\nmoduli on the basis of theoretical light curves composed of free-free and\nphotospheric emission. For QU Vul, we obtained a distance of d~2.4 kpc,\nreddening of E(B-V)~0.55, and WD mass of M_WD=0.82-0.96 M_sun. This suggests\nthat an oxygen-neon WD lost a mass of more than ~0.1 M_sun since its birth. For\nV351 Pup, we obtained d~5.5 kpc, E(B-V)~0.45, and M_WD=0.98-1.1 M_sun. For V382\nVel, we obtained d~1.6 kpc, E(B-V)~0.15, and M_WD=1.13-1.28 M_sun. For V693\nCrA, we obtained d~7.1 kpc, E(B-V)~0.05, and M_WD=1.15-1.25 M_sun. For V1974\nCyg, we obtained d~1.8 kpc, E(B-V)~0.30, and M_WD=0.95-1.1 M_sun. For\ncomparison, we added the carbon-oxygen nova V1668 Cyg to our analysis and\nobtained d~5.4 kpc, E(B-V)~0.30, and M_WD=0.98-1.1 M_sun. In QU Vul,\nphotospheric emission contributes 0.4-0.8 mag at most to the optical light\ncurve compared with free-free emission only. In V351 Pup and V1974 Cyg,\nphotospheric emission contributes very little (0.2-0.4 mag at most) to the\noptical light curve. In V382 Vel and V693 CrA, free-free emission dominates the\ncontinuum spectra, and photospheric emission does not contribute to the optical\nmagnitudes. We also discuss the Maximum Magnitude versus Rate of Decline (MMRD)\nrelation for these novae based on the universal decline law.\n", "  We present detailed 3D modeling of a dense, coronal thick target X-ray flare\nusing the GX Simulator tool, photospheric magnetic measurements, and microwave\nimaging and spectroscopy data. The developed model offers a remarkable\nagreement between the synthesized and observed spectra and images in both X-ray\nand microwave domains, which validates the entire model. The flaring loop\nparameters are chosen to reproduce the emission measure, temperature, and the\nnonthermal electron distribution at low energies derived from the X-ray\nspectral fit, while the remaining parameters, unconstrained by the X-ray data,\nare selected such as to match the microwave images and total power spectra. The\nmodeling suggests that the accelerated electrons are trapped in the coronal\npart of the flaring loop, but away from where the magnetic field is minimal,\nand, thus, demonstrates that the data are clearly inconsistent with electron\nmagnetic trapping in the weak diffusion regime mediated by the Coulomb\ncollisions. Thus, the modeling supports the interpretation of the coronal\nthick-target sources as sites of electron acceleration in flares and supplies\nus with a realistic 3D model with physical parameters of the acceleration\nregion and flaring loop.\n", "  Sensitive ground-based submillimeter surveys, such as ATLASGAL, provide a\nglobal view on the distribution of cold dense gas in the Galactic plane. Here\nwe use the 353 GHz maps from the Planck/HFI instrument to complement the\nground-based APEX/LABOCA observations with information on larger angular\nscales. The resulting maps reveal the distribution of cold dust in the inner\nGalaxy with a larger spatial dynamic range. We find examples of elongated\nstructures extending over angular scales of 0.5 degree. Corresponding to >30 pc\nstructures in projection at a distance of 3 kpc, these dust lanes are very\nextended and show large aspect ratios. Furthermore, we assess the fraction of\ndense gas ($f_{\\rm DG}$), and estimate 2-5% (above A$_{\\rm{v}}>$7 mag) on\naverage in the Galactic plane. PDFs of the column density reveal the typically\nobserved log-normal distribution for low- and exhibit an excess at high column\ndensities. As a reference for extragalactic studies, we show the line-of-sight\nintegrated N-PDF of the inner Galaxy, and derive a contribution of this excess\nto the total column density of $\\sim2.2$%, above $N_{\\rm H_2} =\n2.92\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Taking the total flux density, we provide an\nindependent estimate of the mass of molecular gas in the inner Galaxy of\n$\\sim1\\times10^9\\,M_{\\odot}$, which is consistent with previous estimates using\nCO emission. From the mass and $f_{\\rm DG}$ we estimate a Galactic SFR of $\\dot\nM = 1.3\\,M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. While the distribution of diffuse gas is\nhomogenous in the inner Galaxy, the CMZ stands out with a higher dense gas\nfraction. The low star formation efficiency of the Milky Way is well explained\nby the low $f_{\\rm DG}$ in the Galactic ISM, while the high $f_{\\rm DG}$\ntowards the CMZ, despite its low star formation activity, suggests that, in\nthat particular region of our Galaxy, high-density gas is not the bottleneck\nfor star formation.\n", "  We measure carbon radio recombination line (RRL) emission at 5.3 GHz toward\nfour HII regions with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to determine the magnetic\nfield strength in the photodissociation region (PDR) that surrounds the ionized\ngas. Roshi (2007) suggests that the non-thermal line widths of carbon RRLs from\nPDRs are predominantly due to magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves, thus allowing\nthe magnetic field strength to be derived. We model the PDR with a simple\ngeometry and perform the non-LTE radiative transfer of the carbon RRL emission\nto solve for the PDR physical properties. Using the PDR mass density from these\nmodels and the carbon RRL non-thermal line width we estimate total magnetic\nfield strengths of B ~ 100-300 micro Gauss in W3 and NGC6334A. Our results for\nW49 and NGC6334D are less well constrained with total magnetic field strengths\nbetween B ~ 200-1000 micro Gauss. HI and OH Zeeman measurements of the\nline-of-sight magnetic field strength (B_los), taken from the literature, are\nbetween a factor of ~0.5-1 of the lower bound of our carbon RRL magnetic field\nstrength estimates. Since |B_los| <= B, our results are consistent with the\nmagnetic origin of the non-thermal component of carbon RRL widths.\n", "  We study ray optics in the context of double mirror systems, in the limit as\nthe two mirrors approach one another (thin films). This leads to a novel set of\ndifferential equations on a mirror surface which have interesting structure as\nseen from the perspective of symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics.\n", "  We present ALMA detections of the [CII] 158 micron emission line and the\nunderlying far-infrared continuum of three quasars at 6.6<z<6.9 selected from\nthe VIKING survey. The [CII] line fluxes range between 1.6-3.4 Jy km/s ([CII]\nluminosities ~(1.9-3.9)x10^9 L_sun). We measure continuum flux densities of\n0.56-3.29 mJy around 158 micron (rest-frame), with implied far-infrared\nluminosities between (0.6-7.5)x10^12 L_sun and dust masses M_d=(0.7-24)x10^8\nM_sun. In one quasar we derive a dust temperature of 30^+12_-9 K from the\ncontinuum slope, below the canonical value of 47 K. Assuming that the [CII] and\ncontinuum emission are powered by star formation, we find star-formation rates\nfrom 100-1600 M_sun/yr based on local scaling relations. The L_[CII]/L_FIR\nratios in the quasar hosts span a wide range from (0.3-4.6)x10^-3, including\none quasar with a ratio that is consistent with local star-forming galaxies. We\nfind that the strength of the L_[CII] and 158 micron continuum emission in z>~6\nquasar hosts correlate with the quasar's bolometric luminosity. In one quasar,\nthe [CII] line is significantly redshifted by ~1700 km/s with respect to the\nMgII broad emission line. Comparing to values in the literature, we find that,\non average, the MgII is blueshifted by 480 km/s (with a standard deviation of\n630 km/s) with respect to the host galaxy redshift, i.e. one of our quasars is\nan extreme outlier. Through modeling we can rule out a flat rotation curve for\nour brightest [CII] emitter. Finally, we find that the ratio of black hole mass\nto host galaxy (dynamical) mass is higher by a factor 3-4 (with significant\nscatter) than local relations.\n", "  Stochastic acceleration of nonthermal electrons is investigated in the\ncontext of hard photon spectra of blazars. It is well known that this\nacceleration mechanism can produce a hard electron spectrum of $m \\equiv\n\\partial \\ln n_{\\rm e}(\\gamma)/\\partial \\ln \\gamma = 2$ with the high-energy\ncutoff, called an ultrarelativistic Maxwellian-like distribution, where $n_{\\rm\ne}(\\gamma)$ is an electron energy spectrum. We revisit the formation of this\ncharacteristic spectrum, considering a particular situation where the electrons\nare accelerated through gyroresonant interaction with magnetohydrodynamic wave\nturbulence driven by the turbulent cascade. By solving kinetic equations of the\nturbulent fields, electrons, and photons emitted via the synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) process, we demonstrate that in the non-test-particle\ntreatment, the formation of a Maxwellian-like distribution is prevented by the\ndamping effect on the turbulent fields due to the electron acceleration, at\nleast unless an extreme parameter value is chosen. Instead, a softer electron\nspectrum with the index of $m \\approx -1$ is produced if the Kolmogorov-type\ncascade is assumed. The SSC spectrum that originates from the resultant softer\nelectron spectrum is still hard, but somewhat softer and broader than the case\nof $m=2$. This change of achievable hardness should be noted when this basic\nparticle acceleration scenario is tested with observations of hard photon\nspectra accurately.\n", "  HH 211 is a highly collimated jet with a chain of well-defined knots, powered\nby a nearby young Class 0 protostar. We have used 4 epochs (2004, 2008, 2010,\nand 2013) of Submillimeter Array (SMA) archive data to study the properties of\nthe HH 211 jet in SiO (J=8-7). The jet shows similar reflection-symmetric\nwiggle structures in all epochs. The wiggle structures can all be fitted by an\norbiting jet source model that includes a position shift due to proper motion\nof the jet, indicating that the wiggle propagates along the jet axis. Thus,\nthis suggests the wiggle is indeed due to an orbital motion of the jet source.\nProper motions of the knots are measured by using the peak positions of the\nknots in four epochs, and they are roughly the same and independent of the\ndistance from the central source. The mean proper motion of the knots is $\\sim$\n0.087 arcsec per year, resulting in a transverse velocity of $\\sim$ 114 km\ns$^{-1}$, about 30\\% lower than that measured before. Knots BK2 and BK3 have a\nwell-defined linear velocity structure, with the fast jet material upstream to\nthe slow jet material. The gradient of the velocity structure decreases from\nknot BK2 to BK3. In addition, for each knot, the gradient decreases with time,\nas the knot propagates away from the central source. These results are both\nexpected if the two knots trace internal shocks produced by a small periodical\nvariation in ejection velocity of the jet.\n", "  The electronic structure of SrTiO3 and SrHfO3 (001) surfaces with oxygen\nvacancies is studied by means of first-principles calculations. We reveal how\noxygen vacancies within the first atomic layer of the SrTiO3 surface (i) induce\na large antiferrodistortive motion of the oxygen octahedra at the surface, (ii)\ndrive localized magnetic moments on the Ti-3d orbitals close to the vacancies\nand (iii) form a two-dimensional electron gas localized within the first\nlayers. The analysis of the spin-texture of this system exhibits a splitting of\nthe energy bands according to the Zeeman interaction, lowering of the Ti-3dxy\nlevel in comparison with dxz and dyz and also an in-plane precession of the\nspins. No Rashba-like splitting for the ground state neither for ab-initio\nmolecular dynamics trajectory at 400K is recognized as suggested recently by A.\nF. Santander-Syro et al. [1]. Instead, a sizeable Rashba-like splitting is\nobserved when the Ti atom is replaced by a heavier Hf atom with a much larger\nspin-orbit interaction. However, we observe the disappearance of the magnetism\nand the surface two dimensional electron gas when full structural optimization\nof the SrHfO3 surface is performed. Our results uncover the sensitive interplay\nof spin-orbit coupling, atomic relaxations and magnetism when tuning these\nSr-based perovskites.\n", "  The triggering mechanisms for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are still debated.\nSome of the most popular ones include galaxy interactions (IT) and disk\ninstabilities (DI). Using an advanced semi analytic model (SAM) of galaxy\nformation, coupled to accurate halo occupation distribution modeling, we\ninvestigate the imprint left by each separate triggering process on the\nclustering strength of AGN at small and large scales. Our main results are as\nfollows: i) DIs, irrespective of their exact implementation in the SAM, tend to\nfall short in triggering AGN activity in galaxies at the center of halos with\n$M_h>10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\\odot}$. On the contrary, the IT scenario predicts\nabundance of active, central galaxies that generally agrees well with\nobservations at every halo mass. ii) The relative number of satellite AGN in\nDIs at intermediate-to-low luminosities is always significantly higher than in\nIT models, especially in groups and clusters. The low AGN satellite fraction\npredicted for the IT scenario might suggest that different feeding modes could\nsimultaneously contribute to the triggering of satellite AGN. iii) Both\nscenarios are quite degenerate in matching large-scale clustering measurements,\nsuggesting that the sole average bias might not be an effective observational\nconstraint. iv) Our analysis suggests the presence of both a mild luminosity\nand a more consistent redshift dependence in the AGN clustering, with AGN\ninhabiting progressively less massive dark matter halos as the redshift\nincreases. We also discuss the impact of different observational selection cuts\nin measuring AGN clustering, including possible discrepancies between optical\nand X-ray surveys.\n", "  Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics in Galactic\nresearch. For example, they allow accurately tracing the chemical structure of\nthe Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is known only for a rather low\npercentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a\nvariety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is\nhighly desirable. In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of\nhomogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different\nsources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial\nmetallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. We used\nphotometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The\ndifferent sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and\ncorrelations. In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We\nused the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial\nmetallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible\nincrease of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide\nobservational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical\nsignificance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection\neffects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent\nGalactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce\nthe flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of\nradial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional\nmechanism is at work. [abridged]\n", "  Trojan asteroids orbit in the Lagrange points of the system\nSun-planet-asteroid. Their dynamical stability make their physical properties\nimportant proxies for the early evolution of our solar system. To study their\norigin, we want to characterize the surfaces of Jupiter Trojan asteroids and\ncheck possible similarities with objects of the main belt and of the Kuiper\nBelt. We have obtained high-accuracy broad-band linear polarization\nmeasurements of six Jupiter Trojans of the L4 population and tried to estimate\nthe main features of their polarimetric behaviour. We have compared the\npolarimetric properties of our targets among themselves, and with those of\nother atmosphere-less bodies of our solar system. Our sample show approximately\nhomogeneous polarimetric behaviour, although some distinct features are found\nbetween them. In general, the polarimetric properties of Trojan asteroids are\nsimilar to those of D- and P-type main-belt asteroids. No sign of coma activity\nis detected in any of the observed objects. An extended polarimetric survey may\nhelp to further investigate the origin and the surface evolution of Jupiter\nTrojans.\n", "  Phenomenological characteristics of the sample of the Algol-type stars are\nrevised using a recently developed NAV (\"New Algol Variable\") algorithm\n(2012Ap.....55..536A, 2012arXiv 1212.6707A) and compared to that obtained using\ncommon methods of Trigonometric Polynomial Fit (TP) or local Algebraic\nPolynomial (A) fit of a fixed or (alternately) statistically optimal degree\n(1994OAP.....7...49A, 2003ASPC..292..391A). The computer program NAV is\nintroduced, which allows to determine the best fit with 7 \"linear\" and 5\n\"non-linear\" parameters and their error estimates. The number of parameters is\nmuch smaller than for the TP fit (typically 20-40, depending on the width of\nthe eclipse, and is much smaller (5-20) for the W UMa and beta Lyrae - type\nstars. This causes more smooth approximation taking into account the reflection\nand ellipsoidal effects (TP2) and generally different shapes of the primary and\nsecondary eclipses. An application of the method to two-color CCD photometry to\nthe recently discovered eclipsing variable 2MASS J18024395 + 4003309 = VSX\nJ180243.9 +400331 (2015JASS...32..101A) allowed to make estimates of the\nphysical parameters of the binary system based on the phenomenological\nparameters of the light curve. The phenomenological parameters of the light\ncurves were determined for the sample of newly discovered EA and EW - type\nstars (VSX J223429.3+552903, VSX J223421.4+553013, VSX J223416.2+553424,\nUS-NO-B1.0 1347-0483658, UCAC3-191-085589, VSX J180755.6+074711= UCAC3\n196-166827). Despite we have used original observations published by the\ndiscoverers, the accuracy estimates of the period using the NAV method are\ntypically better than the original ones.\n", "  We analyzed data from a shadow observation of the high density molecular\ncloud MBM36 (l~4{\\deg}, b~35{\\deg}) with Suzaku. MBM36 is located in a region\nthat emits relatively weakly in the 3/4~keV band, compared to the surrounding\nNPS/Loop 1 structure and the Galactic Bulge. The contrast between a high and\nlow density targets in the MBM36 area allows one to separate the local and\ndistant contributors to the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background, providing a much\nbetter characterization of the individual components compared to single\npointing observations. We identify two non-local thermal components, one at\nkT~0.12 keV and one at kT~0.29keV. The colder component matches well with\nmodels of emission from the higher latitude region of the Galactic Bulge. The\nemission of the warmer component is in agreement with models predicting that\nthe NPS is due to a hypershell from the center of the Milky Way. Geometrical\nand pressure calculations rule out a nearby bubble as responsible for the\nemission associate with the NPS. Any Galactic Halo/CircumGalactic Halo\nemission, if present, is outshined by the other components. We also report an\nexcess emission around 0.9~keV, likely due to an overabundance of NeIX.\n", "  We report on 0.3-10 keV observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of\neight hard X-ray sources discovered within 8 degrees of the Galactic plane by\nthe INTEGRAL satellite. The short (5 ks) Chandra observations of the IGR source\nfields have yielded very likely identifications of X-ray counterparts for three\nof the IGR sources: IGR J14091-6108, IGR J18088-2741, and IGR J18381-0924. The\nfirst two have very hard spectra in the Chandra band that can be described by a\npower-law with photon indices of Gamma = 0.6+/-0.4 and -0.7(+0.4)(-0.3),\nrespectively (90% confidence errors are given), and both have a unique near-IR\ncounterpart consistent with the Chandra position. IGR J14091-6108 also displays\na strong iron line and a relatively low X-ray luminosity, and we argue that the\nmost likely source type is a Cataclysmic Variable (CV), although we do not\ncompletely rule out the possibility of a High Mass X-ray Binary. IGR\nJ18088-2741 has an optical counterpart with a previously measured 6.84 hr\nperiodicity, which may be the binary orbital period. We also detect five cycles\nof a possible 800-950 s period in the Chandra light curve, which may be the\ncompact object spin period. We suggest that IGR J18088-2741 is also most likely\na CV. For IGR J18381-0924, the spectrum is intrinsically softer with Gamma =\n1.5(+0.5)(-0.4), and it is moderately absorbed, nH = (4+/-1)e22 cm-2. There are\ntwo near-IR sources consistent with the Chandra position, and they are both\nclassified as galaxies, making it likely that IGR J18381-0924 is an Active\nGalactic Nucleus (AGN). For the other five IGR sources, we provide lists of\nnearby Chandra sources, which may be used along with further observations to\nidentify the correct counterparts, and we discuss the implications of the low\ninferred Chandra count rates for these five sources.\n", "  A computer program is introduced, which allows to determine statistically\noptimal approxi-mation using the \"Asymptotic Parabola\" fit, or, in other words,\nthe spline consisting of polynomials of order 1,2,1, or two lines\n(\"asymptotes\") connected with a parabola. The function itself and its\nderivative is continuous. There are 5 parameters: two points, where a line\nswitches to a parabola and vice versa, the slopes of the line and the curvature\nof the parabola. Extreme cases are either the parabola without lines (i.e.the\nparabola of width of the whole interval), or lines without a parabola (zero\nwidth of the parabola), or \"line+parabola\" without a second line. Such an\napproximation is especially effective for pulsating variables, for which the\nslopes of the ascending and descending branches are generally different, so the\nmaxima and minima have asymmetric shapes. The method was initially introduced\nby Marsakova and Andronov (1996OAP.....9..127M) and realized as a computer\nprogram written in QBasic under DOS. It was used for dozens of variable stars,\nparticularly, for the catalogs of the individual characteristics of pulsations\nof the Mira (1998OAP....11...79M) and semi-regular (200OAP....13..116C)\npulsating variables. For the eclipsing variables with nearly symmetric shapes\nof the minima, we use a \"symmetric\" version of the \"Asymptotic parabola\". Here\nwe introduce a Windows-based program, which does not have DOS limitation for\nthe memory (number of observations) and screen resolution. The program has an\nuser-friendly interface and is illustrated by an application to the test signal\nand to the pulsating variable AC Her.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo (MC) code we wrote to simulate the photospheric\nprocess and to study the photospheric spectrum above the peak energy. Our\nsimulations were performed with a photon to electron ratio $N_{\\gamma}/N_{e} =\n10^{5}$, as determined by observations of the GRB prompt emission. We searched\nan exhaustive parameter space to determine if the photospheric process can\nmatch the observed high-energy spectrum of the prompt emission. If we do not\nconsider electron re-heating, we determined that the best conditions to produce\nthe observed high-energy spectrum are low photon temperatures and high optical\ndepths. However, for these simulations, the spectrum peaks at an energy below\n300 keV by a factor $\\sim 10$. For the cases we consider with higher photon\ntemperatures and lower optical depths, we demonstrate that additional energy in\nthe electrons is required to produce a power-law spectrum above the\npeak-energy. By considering electron re-heating near the photosphere, the\nspectrum for these simulations have a peak-energy $\\sim \\mbox{300 keV}$ and a\npower-law spectrum extending to at least 10 MeV with a spectral index\nconsistent with the prompt emission observations. We also performed simulations\nfor different values of $N_{\\gamma}/N_{e}$ and determined that the simulation\nresults are very sensitive to $N_{\\gamma}/N_{e}$. Lastly, in addition to\nComptonizing a Blackbody spectrum, we also simulate the Comptonization of a\n$f_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{-1/2}$ fast cooled synchrotron spectrum. The spectrum for\nthese simulations peaks at $\\sim 10^{4} \\mbox{ keV}$, with a flat spectrum\n$f_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{0}$ below the peak energy.\n", "  The Ophiuchus stellar stream presents a dynamical puzzle: its old stellar\npopulations ($\\sim 12$ Gyr) cannot be reconciled with (1) its orbit in a simple\nmodel for the Milky Way potential and (2) its short angular extent, both of\nwhich imply that the observed stream formed within the last $<1$ Gyr. Recent\ntheoretical work has shown that streams on chaotic orbits may abruptly fan out\nnear their apparent ends; stars in these fans are dispersed in both position\nand velocity and may be difficult to associate with the stream. Here we present\nthe first evidence of such stream-fanning in the Ophiuchus stream, traced by\nfour blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars beyond the apparent end of the stream.\nThese stars stand out from the background by their high velocities ($v_{\\rm\nlos} > 230$ km s$^{-1}$) against $\\sim 40$ other stars: their velocities are\ncomparable to those of the stream, but would be exceptional if they were\nunrelated halo stars. Their positions and velocities are, however, inconsistent\nwith simple extrapolation of the observed cold, high-density portion of the\nstream. These observations suggest that stream-fanning may be a real,\nobservable effect and, therefore, that Ophiuchus may be on a chaotic orbit.\nThey also show that the Ophiuchus stream is more extended and hence dynamically\nolder than previously thought, easing the stellar population vs. dynamical age\ntension.\n", "  We propose that the dynamical axion field can be realized in a magnetic\ntopological insulator superlattice or a topological paramagnetic insulator. The\nmagnetic fluctuations of these systems produce a pseudoscalar field which has\nan axionic coupling to the electromagnetic field, and thus it gives a\ncondensed-matter realization of the axion electrodynamics. Compared to the\npreviously proposed dynamical axion materials where a long range\nantiferromagnetic order is required, the systems proposed here have the\nadvantage that only a uniform magnetization or a paramagnetic state is needed\nfor the dynamic axion. We further propose several experiments to detect such a\ndynamical axion field.\n", "  The change of the distribution function of electron-positron pair beams\ndetermines whether GeV photons can be produced as secondary radiation from TeV\nphotons. We will discuss the instabilities driven by pair beams. The system of\na thermal proton-electron plasma and the electron-positron beam is collision\nfree. We have, therefore, used the Particle-in-Cell simulation approach. It was\nnecessary to alter the physical parameters, but the ordering of growth rates\nhas been retained. We were able to show that plasma instabilities can be\nrecovered in particle-in-cell simulations, but their effect on the pair\ndistribution function is negligible for beam-background energy density ratios\ntypically found in blazars.\n", "  The Feynman path integral does not allow a \"one real path\" interpretation,\nbecause amplitudes contribute to probabilities in a non-separable manner. The\nopposite extreme, \"all paths happen\", is not a useful or informative account.\nIn this paper it is shown that an intermediate parsing of the path integral,\ninto realistic non-interfering possibilities, is always available. Each\nrealistic possibility formally corresponds to numerous particle paths, but is\narguably best interpreted as a spacetime-valued field. Notably, one actual\nfield history can always be said to occur, although it will generally not have\nan extremized action. The most obvious concerns with this approach are\naddressed, indicating necessary follow-up research. But without obvious\nshowstoppers, it seems plausible that the path integral might be reinterpreted\nto explain quantum phenomena in terms of Lorentz covariant field histories.\n", "  Stimulated Brillouin backscattering of light is shown to be drastically\nenhanced in electron-positron plasmas, in contrast to the suppression of\nstimulated Raman scattering. A generalized theory of three-wave coupling\nbetween electromagnetic and plasma waves in two-species plasmas with arbitrary\nmass ratios, confirmed with a comprehensive set of particle-in-cell\nsimulations, reveals violations of commonly-held assumptions about the behavior\nof electron-positron plasmas. Specifically, in the electron-positron limit\nthree-wave parametric interaction between light and the plasma acoustic wave\ncan occur, and the acoustic wave phase velocity differs from its usually\nassumed value.\n", "  We construct multipole moments for stationary, asymptotically flat, spacetime\nsolutions to higher-order curvature theories of gravity. The moments are\ndefined using $3+1$ techniques involving timelike Killing vector constructions\nas in the classic papers by Geroch and Hansen. Using the fact that the\nKerr-Newman metric is a vacuum solution to a particular class of $f(R)$\ntheories of gravity, we compute all its moments, and find that they admit\nrecurrence relations similar to those for the Kerr solution in general\nrelativity. It has been proposed previously that modelling the measured\nfrequencies of quasi-periodic oscillations from galactic microquasars enables\nexperimental tests of the no-hair theorem. We explore the possibility that,\neven if the no-hair relation is found to break down in the context of general\nrelativity, there may be an $f(R)$ counterpart that is preserved. We apply the\nresults to the microquasars GRS $1915$+$105$ and GRO J$1655$-$40$ using the\ndiskoseismology and kinematic resonance models, and constrain the spins and\n`charges' [which are not really electric charges in the $f(R)$ context] of\ntheir black holes.\n", "  We uncover that the breaking point of the PT-symmetry in optical waveguide\narrays has a dramatic impact on light localization induced by the off-diagonal\ndisorder. Specifically, when the gain/loss control parameter approaches a\ncritical value at which PT-symmetry breaking occurs, a fast growth of the\ncoupling between neighboring waveguides causes diffraction to dominate to an\nextent that light localization is strongly suppressed and statistically\naveraged width of the output pattern substantially increases. Beyond the\nsymmetry-breaking point localization is gradually restored, although in this\nregime the power of localized modes grows upon propagation. The strength of\nlocalization monotonically increases with disorder at both, broken and unbroken\nPT-symmetry.\n", "  The spin period (185 ms) and period derivative ($1.8\\times10^{-17}\\,\\rm\ns\\,s^{-1}$) of the double neutron star (DNS) system PSR J1930$-$1852 recently\ndiscovered indicate that the pulsar was mildly recycled through the process of\nRoche-lobe overflow. This system has the longest orbital period (45 days) of\nthe known DNS systems, and can be formed from a helium star-NS binary if the\ninitial mass of the helium star was $ \\lesssim 4.0M_{\\odot} $; otherwise the\nhelium star would never fill its Roche-lobe \\citep{t15}. At the moment of the\nsupernova explosion, the mass of the helium star was $ \\lesssim3.0M_{\\odot} $.\nWe find that the probability distribution of the velocity kick imparted to the\nnew-born neutron star has a maximum at about $30 \\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$ (and a tail\nup to $ 260 \\,\\rm km\\,s^{-1}$), indicating that this NS most probably received\na low kick velocity at birth.\n", "  We have investigated the dependence of the prograde/retrograde temporary\ncapture of asteroids by a planet on their original heliocentric semimajor axes\nthrough analytical arguments and numerical orbital integrations in order to\ndiscuss the origins of irregular satellites of giant planets. We found that\ncapture is mostly retrograde for the asteroids near the planetary orbit and is\nprograde for those from further orbits. An analytical investigation reveals the\nintrinsic dynamics of these dependences and gives boundary semimajor axes for\nthe change in prograde/retrograde capture. The numerical calculations support\nthe idea of deriving the analytical formulae and confirm their dependence. Our\nnumerical results show that the capture probability is much higher for bodies\nfrom the inner region than for outer ones. These results imply that retrograde\nirregular satellites of Jupiter are most likely to be captured bodies from the\nnearby orbits of Jupiter that may have the same origin as Trojan asteroids,\nwhile prograde irregular satellites originate from far inner regions such as\nthe main-belt asteroid region.\n", "  An analytic, asymptotic approximation of the nonlinear steady-state equations\nfor viscoelastic creeping flow, modeled by the Oldroyd-B equations with polymer\nstress diffusion, is derived. Near the extensional stagnation point the flow\nstretches and aligns polymers along the outgoing streamlines of the stagnation\npoint resulting in a stress-island, or birefringent strand. The polymer stress\ndiffusion coefficient is used, both, as an asymptotic parameter and a\nregularization parameter. The structure of the singular part of polymer stress\ntensor is a Gaussian aligned with the incoming streamline of the stagnation\npoint; a smoothed $\\delta$-distribution whose width is proportional to the\nsquare-root of the diffusion coefficient. The amplitude of the stress island\nscales with the Wiessenberg number and, although singular in the limit of\nvanishing diffusion, it is integrable in the cross stream direction due to its\nvanishing width; this yields a convergent secondary flow. The leading order\nvelocity response to this stress island is constructed and shown to be {\\em\nindependent} of the diffusion coefficient in the limit. The secondary\ncirculation counteracts the forced flow and has a vorticity jump at the\nlocation of the stress islands, essentially expelling the background vorticity\nfrom the location of the birefringent strands. The analytic solutions are shown\nto be in excellent quantitative agreement with full numerical simulations and,\ntherefore, the analytic solutions elucidate the salient mechanisms of the flow\nresponse to viscoelasticity and the mechanism for instability.\n", "  We report the discovery of Scl-MM-Dw2, a new dwarf galaxy at a projected\nseparation of $\\sim$50 kpc from NGC 253, as part of the PISCeS (Panoramic\nImaging Survey of Centaurus and Sculptor) project. We measure a tip of the red\ngiant branch distance of $3.12\\pm0.30$ Mpc, suggesting that Scl-MM-Dw2 is\nlikely a satellite of NGC 253. We qualitatively compare the distribution of red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars in the color-magnitude diagram with theoretical\nisochrones and find that it is consistent with an old, $\\sim$12 Gyr, and metal\npoor, $-2.3<$[Fe/H]$<-1.1$, stellar population. We also detect a small number\nof asymptotic giant branch stars consistent with a metal poor $2-3$ Gyr\npopulation in the center of the dwarf. Our non-detection of HI in a deep Green\nBank Telescope spectrum implies a gas fraction $M_{HI}/L_V<0.02$ Msun/Lsun. The\nstellar and gaseous properties of Scl-MM-Dw2 suggest that it is a dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy. Scl-MM-Dw2 has a luminosity of $M_V=-12.1\\pm0.5$ mag and a\nhalf-light radius of $r_h=2.94\\pm0.46$ kpc which makes it moderately larger\nthan dwarf galaxies in the Local Group of the same luminosity. However,\nScl-MM-Dw2 is very elongated ($\\epsilon=0.66\\pm0.06$) and it has an extremely\nlow surface brightness ($\\mu_{0,V}=26.5\\pm0.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Its\nelongation and diffuseness make it an outlier in the ellipticity-luminosity and\nsurface brightness-luminosity scaling relations. These properties suggest that\nthis dwarf is being tidally disrupted by NGC 253.\n", "  We propose that the unified Fano-like interference picture applies to\n$e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- J/\\psi$ and $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- \\psi(3686)$, where\n$Y(4260)$ and $Y(4360)$ are observed, respectively, to provide a reasonable\ninterpretation of the asymmetric lines hapes of $Y(4260)$ and $Y(4360)$\nstructures. Moreover, the Fano-like interference induces an extra broad\nstructure $Y(4008)$ in $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- J/\\psi$ as a companion peak to\n$Y(4260)$. Three charmonium-like states $Y(4008)$, $Y(4260)$ and $Y(4360)$\nobserved in $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes are not genuine resonances. Under\nthis scenario, it is well explained why $Y(4008)$, $Y(4260)$ and $Y(4360)$ are\nabsent in the experimental data of the $R$ value scan and missing in open-charm\ndecay channels. Although the present work presents a typical application of the\nFano-like interference in particle physics at the lower energy region, we have\nreason to believe that the Fano-like phenomena may exist in other processes\nsuch as $e^+e^-\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\psi(3770)$ and $e^+e^-\\to K^+K^- J/\\psi$, which\nwill be accessible at BESIII and forthcoming BelleII.\n", "  The common envelope (CE) phase is an important stage in binary stellar\nevolution. It is needed to explain many close binary stellar systems, such as\ncataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernova progenitors, or X-ray binaries. To\nform the resulting close binary, the initial orbit has to shrink, thereby\ntransferring energy to the primary giant's envelope that is hence ejected. The\ndetails of this interaction, however, are still not understood. Here, we\npresent new hydrodynamic simulations of the dynamical spiral-in forming a CE\nsystem. We apply the moving-mesh code AREPO to follow the interaction of a\n$1M_\\odot$ compact star with a $2M_\\odot$ red giant possessing a $0.4M_\\odot$\ncore. The nearly Lagrangian scheme combines advantages of smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics and traditional grid-based hydrodynamic codes and allows us to\ncapture also small flow features at high spatial resolution. Our simulations\nreproduce the initial transfer of energy and angular momentum from the binary\ncore to the envelope by spiral shocks seen in previous studies, but after about\n20 orbits a new phenomenon is observed. Large-scale flow instabilities are\ntriggered by shear flows between adjacent shock layers. These indicate the\nonset of turbulent convection in the common envelope, thus altering the\ntransport of energy on longer time scales. At the end of our simulation, only\n8% of the envelope mass is ejected. The failure to unbind the envelope\ncompletely may be caused by processes on thermal time scales or unresolved\nmicrophysics.\n", "  In a LCDM cosmology, the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) is expected to\nshow significant intrinsic scatter resulting from the mass-concentration\nrelation of dark matter halos and the baryonic-to-halo mass ratio. We study the\nBTFR using a sample of 118 disc galaxies (spirals and irregulars) with data of\nthe highest quality: extended HI rotation curves (tracing the outer velocity)\nand Spitzer photometry at 3.6 $\\mu$m (tracing the stellar mass). Assuming that\nthe stellar mass-to-light ratio (M*/L) is nearly constant at 3.6 $\\mu$m, we\nfind that the scatter, slope, and normalization of the BTFR systematically vary\nwith the adopted M*/L. The observed scatter is minimized for M*/L > 0.5,\ncorresponding to nearly maximal discs in high-surface-brightness galaxies and\nBTFR slopes close to ~4. For any reasonable value of M*/L, the intrinsic\nscatter is ~0.1 dex, below general LCDM expectations. The residuals show no\ncorrelations with galaxy structural parameters (radius or surface brightness),\ncontrary to the predictions from some semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.\nThese are fundamental issues for LCDM cosmology.\n", "  We mapped the high-velocity compact cloud CO-0.40-0.22 in 21 molecular lines\nin the 3 mm band using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m radio telescope.\nEighteen lines were detected from CO-0.40-0.22. The map of each detected line\nshows that this cloud has a compact appearance (d=~3 pc) and extremely broad\nvelocity width (DV=~100 km/s). The mass and kinetic energy of CO-0.40-0.22 are\nestimated to be 10^{3.6} M_sun and 10^{49.7} erg, respectively. The\nrepresentative position-velocity map along the major axis shows that\nCO-0.40-0.22 consists of an intense region with a shallow velocity gradient and\na less intense high-velocity wing. Here, we show that this kinematical\nstructure can be attributed to a gravitational kick to the molecular cloud\ncaused by an invisible compact object with a mass of ~10^5 M_sun. Its\ncompactness and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that\nthis massive object is an intermediate-mass black hole.\n", "  ULX-7, in the northern spiral arm of M51, demonstrates unusual behaviour for\nan ultraluminous X-ray source, with a hard X-ray spectrum but very high\nshort-term variability. This suggests that it is not in a typical ultraluminous\nstate. We analyse the source using archival data from XMM-Newton, Chandra and\nNuSTAR, and by examining optical and radio data from HST and VLA. Our X-ray\nspectral analysis shows that the source has a hard power-law spectral shape\nwith a photon index Gamma~1.5, which persists despite the source's X-ray\nluminosity varying by over an order of magnitude. The power spectrum of the\nsource features a break at 6.5^{+0.5}_{-1.1}x10^-3 Hz, from a low-frequency\nspectral index of alpha_1=-0.1^{+0.5}_{-0.2} to a high-frequency spectral index\nof alpha_2=0.65^{+0.05}_{-0.14}, making it analogous to the low-frequency break\nfound in the power spectra of low/hard state black holes (BHs). We can take a\nlower frequency limit for a corresponding high-frequency break to calculate a\nBH mass upper limit of 1.6x10^3 solar masses. Using the X-ray/radio fundamental\nplane we calculate another upper limit to the BH mass of 3.5x10^4 solar masses\nfor a BH in the low/hard state. The hard spectrum, high rms variability and\nmass limits are consistent with ULX-7 being an intermediate-mass BH; however we\ncannot exclude other interpretations of this source's interesting behaviour,\nmost notably a neutron star with an extreme accretion rate.\n", "  Recent VLT/SPHERE near-infrared imaging observations revealed two spiral arms\nwith a near m=2 rotational symmetry in the protoplanetary disk around the ~1.7\nsolar mass Herbig star HD 100453. A ~0.3 solar mass M dwarf companion, HD\n100453 B, was also identified at a projected separation of 120 AU from the\nprimary. In this Letter, we carry out hydrodynamic and radiative transfer\nsimulations to examine the scattered light morphology of the HD 100453 disk as\nperturbed by the companion on a circular and coplanar orbit. We find that the\ncompanion truncates the disk at ~45 AU in scattered light images, and excites\ntwo spiral arms in the remaining (circumprimary) disk with a near m=2\nrotational symmetry. Both the truncated disk size and the morphology of the\nspirals are in excellent agreement with the SPHERE observations at Y , J, H,\nand K1-bands, suggesting that the M dwarf companion is indeed responsible for\nthe observed double-spiral-arm pattern. Our model suggests that the disk is\nclose to face on (inclination angle ~5 degree), and that the entire\ndisk-companion system rotates counterclockwise on the sky. The HD 100453\nobservations, along with our modeling work, demonstrate that double spiral arm\npatterns in near-infrared scattered light images can be generically produced by\ncompanions, and support future observations to identify the companions\nresponsible for the arms observed in the MWC 758 and SAO 206462 systems.\n", "  The Smith Cloud is a gaseous high-velocity cloud (HVC) in an advanced state\nof accretion, only 2.9 kpc below the Galactic plane and due to impact the disk\nin 27 Myr. It is unique among HVCs in having a known distance (12.4+/-1.3 kpc)\nand a well-constrained 3D velocity (296 km/s), but its origin has long remained\na mystery. Here we present the first absorption-line measurements of its\nmetallicity, using HST/COS UV spectra of three AGN lying behind the Cloud\ntogether with Green Bank Telescope 21 cm spectra of the same directions. Using\nVoigt-profile fitting of the S II 1250, 1253, 1259 triplet together with\nionization corrections derived from photoionization modeling, we derive the\nsulfur abundance in each direction; a weighted average of the three\nmeasurements gives [S/H]=-0.28+/-0.14, or 0.53+0.21-0.15 solar metallicity. The\nfinding that the Smith Cloud is metal-enriched lends support to scenarios where\nit represents recycled Galactic material rather than the remnant of a dwarf\ngalaxy or accreting intergalactic gas. The metallicity and trajectory of the\nCloud are both indicative of an origin in the outer disk. However, its large\nmass and prograde kinematics remain to be fully explained. If the cloud has\naccreted cooling gas from the corona during its fountain trajectory, as\npredicted in recent theoretical work, its current mass would be higher than its\nlaunch mass, alleviating the mass concern.\n", "  Swift, Chandra and XMM have found a weak but nearly constant X-ray component\nfrom Swift J1644+57 that appeared at ~500 days and was visible at least until ~\n1400 days after the stellar capture, which cannot be explained by standard\ntidal disruption theories. We suggest that this X-ray afterglow component may\nresult from Thomson scattering between the primary X-rays and its surrounding\nplasma, i.e. the Compton echo effect. Similar phenomena has also been observed\nfrom molecular clouds in our Galactic Center, which were caused by the past\nactivity of Srg A*. If this interpretation of Swift J1644+57 afterglow is\ncorrect, this is the first Compton Echo effect observed in the cosmological\ndistances.\n", "  The key ingredient of high critical currents in a type-II superconductor is\ndefect sites that 'pin' vortices. Contrary to earlier understanding on\nnano-patterned artificial pinning, here we show unequivocally the advantages of\na random pinscape over an ordered array in a wide magnetic field range. We\nreveal that the better performance of a random pinscape is due to the variation\nof its local-density-of-pinning-sites (LDOPS), which mitigates the motion of\nvortices. This is confirmed by achieving even higher enhancement of the\ncritical current through a conformally mapped random pinscape, where the\ndistribution of the LDOPS is further enlarged. The demonstrated key role of\nLDOPS in enhancing superconducting critical currents gets at the heart of\nrandom versus commensurate pinning. Our findings highlight the importance of\nrandom pinscapes in enhancing the superconducting critical currents of applied\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We show a scenario for the cooling of compact stars considering the central\nsource of Cassiopeia A (Cas A). The Cas A observation shows that the central\nsource is a compact star with high effective temperature, and it is consistent\nwith the cooling without exotic phases. The Cas A observation also gives the\nmass range of $M \\geq 1.5 M_\\odot$. It may conflict with the current cooling\nscenarios of compact stars that heavy stars show rapid cooling. We include the\neffect of the color superconducting (CSC) quark matter phase on the thermal\nevolution of compact stars. We assume the gap energy of CSC quark phase is\nlarge ($\\Delta \\gtrsim \\mathrm{10 MeV}$), and we simulate the cooling of\ncompact stars. We present cooling curves obtained from the evolutionary\ncalculations of compact stars: while heavier stars cool slowly, and lighter\nones indicate the opposite tendency.\n", "  A quantum field model that incorporates Bose-condensed systems near their\nphase transition into a superfluid phase and velocity fluctuations is proposed.\nThe stochastic Navier-Stokes equation is used for a generation of the velocity\nfluctuations. As such this model generalizes model F of critical dynamics. The\nfield-theoretic action is derived using the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism and\npath integral approach. The regime of equilibrium fluctuations is analyzed\nwithin perturbative renormal- ization group method. The double $(\\epsilon\n,\\delta)$-expansion scheme is employed, where is a deviation from space\ndimension $4$ and $\\delta$ describes scaling of velocity fluctuations. The\nrenormalization procedure is performed to the leading order. The main corollary\ngained from the analysis of the thermal equilibrium regime suggests that\none-loop calculations of the presented models are not sufficient to make a\ndefinite conclusion about the stability of fixed points. We also show that\ncritical exponents are drastically changed as a result of the turbulent\nbackground and critical fluctuations are in fact destroyed by the developed\nturbulence fluctuations. The scaling exponent of effective viscosity is\ncalculated and agrees with expected value $4/3$.\n", "  An expression for the average redshift drift in a statistically homogeneous\nand isotropic dust universe is given. The expression takes the same form as the\nexpression for the redshift drift in FLRW models. It is used for a\nproof-of-principle study of the effects of backreaction on redshift drift\nmeasurements by combining the expression with two-region models. The study\nshows that backreaction can lead to positive redshift drift at low redshifts,\nexemplifying that a positive redshift drift at low redshifts does not require\ndark energy. Moreover, the study illustrates that models without a dark energy\ncomponent can have an average redshift drift observationally indistinguishable\nfrom that of the standard model according to the currently expected precision\nof ELT measurements. In an appendix, spherically symmetric solutions to\nEinstein's equations with inhomogeneous dark energy and matter are used to\nstudy deviations from the average redshift drift and effects of local voids.\n", "  Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that the gas and dust follow\nsignificantly different radial distributions. This finding can be theoretically\nexplained by a combination of radial drift and gas drag of intermediate-sized\ndust grains. Using a simple parametric model to approximate the different\ndistributions of the gas and dust components, we calculate and examine the\nimpact of radial drift on the global dust temperature structure. We find that\nthe removal of large grains beyond the \"truncation radius\" allows this region\nto become significantly warmer from reprocessed stellar radiation shining down\nfrom the disk upper layers, increasing the outer disk temperature by\n$\\sim10-30\\%$. This change is sufficient to raise the local temperature to a\nvalue exceeding the CO desorption temperature. These findings imply that the\ndisk density structures induced by radial drift are able to create multiple CO\nsnow-lines. The inner disk CO is in the gas phase, freezing out near the\nclassical snow-line at $R\\sim20-40$ AU. Moving outward, the CO sublimates once\nagain beyond the truncation radius (80 AU in our models) and subsequently\nre-freezes out at sufficiently large stellar distances, beyond\n$R\\gtrsim130-200$ AU. We find that thermal desorption of CO in the outer disk\nbecomes competitive with external UV photodesorption and that this additional\ntransition from solid state CO to the gas-phase has significant implications\nfor the C/O ratio in the outer disk.\n", "  It is still unclear whether the Sagittarius spiral arm is a major spiral arm\nin the Galaxy or whether it just outlines a region of enhanced star formation\nbecause of the local compression of gas. The best way to separate these\nscenarios out is to study the kinematics across the arm to determine the\nvelocity perturbation it induces. A survey of early-type stars in the direction\nof the Galactic center is performed covering an area of 100 square degrees with\nthe aim of identifying candidates for a radial velocity study. Objective prism\nplates were obtained with the 4deg prism on the ESO Schmidt telescope using\nIIaO, 4415, and IIIaJ emulsions. The plates were digitized and more than 100k\nspectra were extracted down to a limiting magnitude of B = 15m. The spectra\nwere cross-correlated with a template with Balmer lines, which yielded a\ncandidate list of 12675 early-type stars. Magnitudes and equivalent widths of\nstrong lines were calculated from the spectra, which allowed us to estimate the\nindividual extinctions and distances for 11075 stars. The survey identified\n9571 candidate stars with a spectral type earlier than A1 and B < 14.5m out to\ndistances of more than 2kpc, which is beyond the Sagittarius arm. This is\nindicated by the increase of absorption in the plane at distances larger than\n0.5kpc.\n", "  We observed the coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order\nin the single-crystalline ternary pnictide HoPdBi, a plausible topological\nsemimetal. The compound orders antiferromagnetically at $T_N =$1.9 K and\nexhibits superconductivity below $T_c =$0.7 K, which was confirmed by magnetic,\nelectrical transport and specific heat measurements. The specific heat shows\nanomalies corresponding to antiferromagnetic ordering transition and\ncrystalline field effect, but not to superconducting transition. Single-crystal\nneutron diffraction indicates that the antiferromagnetic structure is\ncharacterized by the (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) propagation vector. Temperature variation\nof the electrical resistivity reveals two parallel conducting channels of\nsemiconducting and metallic character. In weak magnetic fields, the\nmagnetoresistance exhibits weak antilocalization effect, while in strong fields\nand temperatures below 50 K it is large and negative. At temperatures below 7 K\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations with two frequencies appear in the resistivity.\nThese oscillations have non-trivial Berry phase, which is a distinguished\nfeature of Dirac fermions.\n", "  We investigate the elastic stop band properties of a theoretical cubic array\nof iron spheres connected to a bulk of concrete via iron or rubber ligaments.\nEach sphere can move freely within a surrounding air cavity, but ligaments\ncouple it to the bulk and further facilitate bending and rotational motions.\nAssociated low frequency local resonances are well predicted by an asymptotic\nformula. We find complete stop bands (for all wave-polarizations) in the\nfrequency range $[16,21]$ Hertz (resp. $[6,11]$ Hertz) for $7.4$-meter (resp.\n$0.74$-meter) diameter iron spheres with a $10$-meter (resp. $1$-meter)\ncenter-to-center spacing, when they are connected to concrete via steel (resp.\nrubber) ligaments. The scattering problem shows that only bending modes are\nresponsible for damping and that rotational modes are totally overwritten by\nbending modes. Regarding seismic applications, we further consider soil as a\nbulk medium, in which case the relative bandwidth of the low frequency stop\nband can be enlarged through ligaments of different sizes that allow for well\nseparated bending and rotational modes. We finally achieve some damping of\nelastodynamic waves from $8$ to $49$ Hertz (relative stop band of $143$\npercent) for iron spheres $0.74$-meter in diameter that are connected to soil\nwith six rubber ligaments of optimized shapes. These results represent a\npreliminary step in the design of seismic shields placed around, or underneath,\nthe foundations of large civil infrastructures.\n", "  We calculate the properties and investigate the stability of stars that burn\nvia strong (and electromagnetic) interactions, and compare their properties\nwith those that, as in our Universe, include a rate-limiting weak interaction.\nIt has been suggested that, if the diproton were bound, stars would burn\n~10^{18} times brighter and faster via strong interactions, resulting in a\nuniverse that would fail to support life. By considering the representative\ncase of a star in our Universe with initially equal numbers of protons and\ndeuterons, we find that stable, \"strong-burning\" stars adjust their central\ndensities and temperatures to have familiar surface temperatures, luminosities\nand lifetimes. There is no \"diproton disaster\". In addition, strong-burning\nstars are stable in a much larger region of the parameter space of fundamental\nconstants, specifically the strength of electromagnetism and gravity. The\nstrongest anthropic bound on stars in such universes is not their stability, as\nis the case for stars limited by the weak interaction, but rather their\nlifetime. Regardless of the strength of electromagnetism, all stars burn out in\nmere millions of years unless the gravitational coupling constant is extremely\nsmall, \\alpha_G < 10^{-30}.\n", "  Spherically-symmetric ground states of alkali-metal atoms do not posses\nelectric quadrupole moments. However, the hyperfine interaction between nuclear\nmoments and atomic electrons distorts the spherical symmetry of electronic\nclouds and leads to non-vanishing atomic quadrupole moments. We evaluate these\nhyperfine-induced quadrupole moments using techniques of relativistic many-body\ntheory and compile results for Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs atoms. For heavy atoms we\nfind that the hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are strongly (two orders of\nmagnitude) enhanced by correlation effects. We further apply the results of the\ncalculation to microwave atomic clocks where the coupling of atomic quadrupole\nmoments to gradients of electric fields leads to clock frequency uncertainties.\nWe show that for $^{133}$Cs atomic clocks, the spatial gradients of electric\nfields must be smaller than $30 \\, \\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$ to guarantee\nfractional inaccuracies below $10^{-16}$.\n", "  Strongly interacting, dynamically disordered and with no small parameter,\nliquids took a theoretical status between gases and solids. We review different\napproaches to liquids and propose that liquids do not need classifying in terms\nof their proximity to gases and solids. Instead, they are a unique system in\ntheir own class with a notably mixed dynamical state in contrast to pure\ndynamical states of solids and gases. We start with explaining how the\nfirst-principles approach to liquids is an intractable, exponentially complex\nproblem of coupled non-linear oscillators with bifurcations. This is followed\nby a reduction of the problem based on liquid relaxation time $\\tau$\nrepresenting non-perturbative treatment of strong interactions. On the basis of\n$\\tau$, solid-like high-frequency modes are predicted and we review related\nrecent experiments. We demonstrate how these modes can be derived by\ngeneralizing either hydrodynamic or elasticity equations. We comment on the\nhistorical trend to approach liquids using hydrodynamics and compare it to an\nalternative solid-like approach. We subsequently discuss how collective modes\nevolve with temperature and how this affects liquid energy and other properties\nsuch as fast sound. Here, our emphasis is on real, rather than model, liquids.\nHighlighting the dominant role of high-frequency modes for liquid energy, we\nreview a wide range of liquids: subcritical low-viscous liquids, supercritical\nstate with two different dynamical and thermodynamic regimes separated by the\nFrenkel line, highly-viscous liquids and liquid-glass transition. We also\ndiscuss liquid-liquid phase transitions where the solid-like properties of\nliquids have become further apparent. We then discuss gas-like and solid-like\napproaches to quantum liquids and persisting theoretical problems. We list\nareas where interesting insights may appear and continue the extraordinary\nliquid story.\n", "  The recent observation of a modest excess in diphoton final states at the\nLHC, by both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations, has sparked off the expected\nrace among theorists to find the right explanation for this proto-resonance,\nassuming that the signal will survive and not prove to be yet another\nstatistical fluctuation. We carry out a general analysis of this `signal' in\nthe case of a scalar which couples only to pairs of gluons (for production) and\nphotons (for diphoton decay modes), and establish that an explanation of the\nobserved resonance, taken together with the null results of new physics\nsearches in all the other channels, requires a scalar with rather exotic\nbehaviour. We then demonstrate that a fairly simple-minded extension of the\nminimal Randall-Sundrum model can yield a radion candidate which might\nreproduce this exotic behaviour.\n", "  Nonlinear second harmonic optical activity of graphene covering a gold photon\nsieve was determined for different polarizations. The photon sieve consists of\na subwavelength gold nanohole array placed on glass. It combines the benefits\nof efficient light trapping and surface plasmon propagation in order to unravel\ndifferent elements of graphene second-order susceptibility \\chi(2). Those\nelements efficiently contribute to second harmonic generation. In fact, the\ngraphene- coated photon sieve produces a second harmonic intensity at least two\norders of magnitude higher compared with a bare, flat gold layer and an order\nof magnitude coming from the plasmonic effect of the photon sieve; the\nremaining enhancement arises from the graphene layer itself. The measured\nsecond harmonic generation yield, supplemented by semianalytical computations,\nprovides an original method to constrain the graphene \\chi(2) elements. The\nvalues obtained are |d_{31} + d_{33}| < 8.1 x 10^3 pm^2/V and |d_{15}| < 1.4 x\n10^6 pm^2/V for a second harmonic signal at 780 nm. This original method can be\napplied to any kind of 2D materials covering such a plasmonic structure.\n", "  The multi-strange baryon yields in Pb--Pb collisions have been shown to\nexhibit an enhancement relative to pp reactions. In this work, $\\Xi$ and\n$\\Omega$ production rates have been measured with the ALICE experiment as a\nfunction of transverse momentum, ${p_{\\rm T}}$, in p-Pb collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of ${\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The results cover\nthe kinematic ranges 0.6 GeV/$c<{p_{\\rm T}} <$7.2 GeV/$c$ and 0.8\nGeV/$c<{p_{\\rm T}}<$ 5 GeV/$c$, for $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ respectively, in the\ncommon rapidity interval -0.5 $<{y_{\\rm CMS}}<$ 0. Multi-strange baryons have\nbeen identified by reconstructing their weak decays into charged particles. The\n${p_{\\rm T}}$ spectra are analysed as a function of event charged-particle\nmultiplicity, which in p-Pb collisions ranges over one order of magnitude and\nlies between those observed in pp and Pb-Pb collisions. The measured ${p_{\\rm\nT}}$ distributions are compared to the expectations from a Blast-Wave model.\nThe parameters which describe the production of lighter hadron species also\ndescribe the hyperon spectra in high multiplicity p-Pb. The yield of hyperons\nrelative to charged pions is studied and compared with results from pp and\nPb-Pb collisions. A statistical model is employed, which describes the change\nin the ratios with volume using a canonical suppression mechanism, in which the\nsmall volume causes a species-dependent relative reduction of hadron\nproduction. The calculations, in which the magnitude of the effect depends on\nthe strangeness content, show good qualitative agreement with the data.\n", "  A relativistic spinor with spin 3/2 is historically called Rarita-Schwinger\nspinor. The right- and left-handed chiral degrees of freedom for the massless\nRarita-Schwinger spinor are independent and are thought of as the left- and\nright-Weyl fermion with helicity \\pm3/2. We study three orbital spin-1/2 Weyl\nsemimetals in the strong spin-orbital coupling limit with time reversal\nsymmetry breaking. We find that in this limit the systems can be a J_{eff}=1/2\nWeyl semimetal or a J_{eff}=3/2 semimetal, depending on the Fermi level\nposition. The latter near Weyl points includes both degrees of freedom of\nRarita-Schwinger-Weyl and Weyl's. A non-local potential separates the Weyl and\nRarita-Schwinger-Weyl degrees of freedom and a relativistic\nRarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal emerges. This recipe can be generalized to\nmulit-Weyl semimetal and Weyl fermions with pairing interaction and obtain high\nmonopole charges.\n  Similarly, a spatial inversion breaking Raita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal may\nalso emerge.\n", "  A unitary gravitational action up to third order of curvature in which\nrespects to the holographic $a-$theorem has been constructed in \\cite{myers}.\nIn particular, its third order term is just the Weyl-cubed term in four\ndimensions.\n  In this paper, we study this theory and find some its exact classical\nsolutions. We show that the theory admits conformally flat, Lifshitz,\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger and also hyperscaling-violating backgrounds as the solutions of\nequations of motion. Our analysis has been done for the pure Weyl-cubed\ngravity, Einstein plus Weyl-cubed term and gravity with matter.\n", "  The decay of top-quark to light quarks and Higgs boson is an extremely rare\nprocess in the Standard Model (SM) framework. Any measurable signal for this\nprocess at the LHC is a smoking gun for new physics. In the framework of\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) there is a possibility that the\nbranching ratio for this process to reach values several orders of magnitude\nlarger than the corresponding of SM. Having as a primary goal the search of\nFlavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) processes that could be measurable at\ncurrent or future LHC runing, we present a calculation in the framework of\nR-parity conserving MSSM for the decay of top quark to light quarks and the\nHiggs boson. Considering different constraints, and carefully looking at the\ncancellations that occur between different contributions, we deduce that there\nare two possible enhanced scenarios for this process: the first arises from the\nholomorphic SUSY breaking terms containing right handed up squark mass\ninsertions and the second comes from the dominance of non-holomorphic SUSY\nbreaking terms in combination with a light Higgs boson sector.\n", "  Electric field control of magnetism is the key to many next generation\nspintronics applications1. Ferroelectric control of spin polarization2,3\nfollowed by the electrically driven repeatable magnetization reversal in the\nabsence of applied magnetic field4 have proven to be the milestones in this\ndirection. This article propose how these phenomena could be utilized in a\nreverse manner to gain control over magnetization even in the absence of\nelectric field. In turn, coexistence of positive5 as well as negative6\nmagnetocaloric effect (MCE) is attained in tri-layered\nPbZr0.53Ti0.47O3-CoFe2O4-PbZr0.53Ti0.47O3 (PZT/CFO/PZT) nanostructures for\nidentical temperature ranges when subjected to different applied magnetic\nfields. Unlike conventional approaches5-9 the present study demonstrate that it\nis possible to obtain giant MCE merely by magneto-pyroelectric coupling.\nConsequently, the MCE entropy changes calculated using Maxwell equations are\nfound to be as large as reported for existing giant MCE values6,9,10.\n", "  The current state of the art in fast timing resolution for existing\nexperiments is of the order of 100 ps on the time of arrival of both charged\nparticles and electromagnetic showers. Current R&D on charged particle timing\nis approaching the level of 10 ps but is not primarily directed at sustained\nperformance at high rates and under high radiation (as would be needed for\nHL-LHC pileup mitigation). We demonstrate a Micromegas based solution to reach\nthis level of performance. The Micromegas acts as a photomultiplier coupled to\na Cerenkov-radiator front window, which produces sufficient UV photons to\nconvert the ~100 ps single-photoelectron jitter into a timing response of the\norder of 10-20 ps per incident charged particle. A prototype has been built in\norder to demonstrate this performance. The first laboratory tests with a\npico-second laser have shown a time resolution of the order of 27 ps for ~50\nprimary photoelectrons, using a bulk Micromegas readout.\n", "  We advance a Bayesian concept of 'intrinsic asymptotic universality' taking\nto its final conclusions previous conceptual and numerical work based upon a\nconcept of a reprogrammability test and an investigation of the complex\nqualitative behaviour of computer programs. Our method may quantify the trust\nand confidence of the computing capabilities of natural and classical systems,\nand quantify computers by their degree of reprogrammability. We test the method\nto provide evidence in favour of a conjecture concerning the computing\ncapabilities of Busy Beaver Turing machines as candidates for Turing\nuniversality. The method has recently been used to quantify the number of\n'intrinsically universal' cellular automata, with results that point towards\nthe pervasiveness of universality due to a widespread capacity for emulation.\nOur method represents an unconventional approach to the classical and seminal\nconcept of Turing universality, and it may be extended and applied in a broader\ncontext to natural computation, by (in something like the spirit of the Turing\ntest) observing the behaviour of a system under circumstances where formal\nproofs of universality are difficult, if not impossible to come by.\n", "  Local magnetic moments can be created in graphene by incorporating different\ndefects. The possibility of regulating dynamics of magnetization in graphene,\nby employing the Purcell effect, is analyzed. The role of the system parameters\nin magnetization reversal is studied. The characteristics of such a reversal\ncan be varied in a wide range, which can be used for various applications in\nspintronics. It is shown that fast magnetization reversal generates coherent\nradiation.\n", "  Let V be a linear subspace of M_n(C) which contains the identity matrix and\nis stable under the formation of Hermitian adjoints. We prove that if n is\nsufficiently large then there exists a rank k orthogonal projection P such that\ndim(PVP) = 1 or k^2.\n", "  Experimental correlation analysis and first-principles theory are used to\nprobe the structure and evolution of Ag-CO-Ag single-molecule junctions, both\nbefore the formation, and after the rupture of the junctions. Two dimensional\ncorrelation histograms and conditional histograms demonstrate that prior to the\nsingle-molecule bridge configuration the CO molecule is already bound parallel\nto the Ag single-atom contact. This molecular precursor configuration is\naccompanied by the opening of additional conductance channels compared to the\nsingle-channel transport in pure Ag monoatomic junctions. To investigate the\npost-rupture evolution of the junction we introduce a cross-correlation\nanalysis between the opening and the subsequent closing conductance traces.\nThis analysis implies that the molecule is bound rigidly to the apex of one\nelectrode, and so the same single-molecule configuration is re-established as\nthe junction is closed. The experimental results are confirmed by ab initio\nsimulations of the evolution of contact geometries, transmission eigenvalues\nand scattering wavefunctions.\n", "  This work formulates a novel song recommender system as a matrix completion\nproblem that benefits from collaborative filtering through Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (NMF) and content-based filtering via total variation (TV) on\ngraphs. The graphs encode both playlist proximity information and song\nsimilarity, using a rich combination of audio, meta-data and social features.\nAs we demonstrate, our hybrid recommendation system is very versatile and\nincorporates several well-known methods while outperforming them. Particularly,\nwe show on real-world data that our model overcomes w.r.t. two evaluation\nmetrics the recommendation of models solely based on low-rank information,\ngraph-based information or a combination of both.\n", "  In case of spinless particles there appear additional (singular) solutions in\nthe framework of relativistic Klein-Gordon equation for Coulomb potential.\nThese solutions obey to all requirements of quantum mechanical general\nprinciples. Observation of such states (hydrino, small hydrogen) should be\nimportant for manifestation of various physical phenomena. In this article the\nsame problem is considered for spin-1/2 particle (electron) in the Dirac\nequation. It is shown that such kind of solutions really occurs, but the rate\nof singularity is more higher than in spinless case. By this reason we have no\ntime- independence of total probability (norm). Moreover the orthogonality\nproperty is also failed, while the total probability is finite in the certain\narea of the model-parameters. Therefore, we are inclined to conclude that this\nadditional solution in the Dirac equation must be ignored and restrict\nourselves only by normal (standard) solutions.\n", "  In the search for a realistic walking technicolor model, QCD with many\nflavors is an attractive candidate. From the series of studies by the LatKMI\ncollaboration, we present updated results of the scaling properties of various\nhadron spectra, including the (pseudo)scalar, vector, and baryon channels, for\n$N_f=8$ QCD analyzed with the HISQ action. By comparing these with $N_f=12$\nQCD, which has properties consistent with conformality, possible signals of\nwalking dynamics are discussed. We also present a preliminary result of the\nflavor-singlet pseudoscalar mass in many-flavor QCD.\n", "  We report the broad-band spectral properties of the X-ray pulsar Cep X-4 by\nusing a Suzaku observation in 2014 July. The 0.8-70 keV spectrum was found to\nbe well described by three continuum models - Negative and Positive power-law\nwith Exponential cutoff (NPEX), high energy cutoff power-law and CompTT models.\nAdditional components such as a cyclotron line at $\\sim$28 keV and two Gaussian\ncomponents for iron lines at 6.4 and 6.9 keV were required in the spectral\nfitting. Apart from these, an additional absorption feature at $\\sim$45 keV was\nclearly detected in residuals obtained from the spectral fitting. This\nadditional feature at $\\sim$45 keV was clearly seen in phase-resolved spectra\nof the pulsar. We identified this feature as the first harmonic of the\nfundamental cyclotron line at $\\sim$28 keV. The ratio between the first\nharmonic and fundamental line energies (1.7) was found to be in disagreement\nwith the conventional factor of 2, indicating that the heights of line forming\nregions are different or viewed at larger angles. The phase-resolved\nspectroscopy of the fundamental and first harmonic cyclotron lines shows\nsignificant pulse-phase variation of the line parameters. This can be\ninterpreted as the effect of viewing angle or the role of complicated magnetic\nfield of the pulsar.\n", "  We consider series solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nBender-Boettcher potentials V(x)=-(ix)^N with integer N. A simple truncation is\nintroduced which provides accurate results regarding the ground state and first\nfew excited states for any N. This is illustrated with explicit computations of\nenergy levels, node structure and expectation values for some integer N.\n", "  Blind quantum computing allows for secure cloud networks of quasi-classical\nclients and a fully fledged quantum server. Recently, a new protocol has been\nproposed, which requires a client to perform only measurements. We demonstrate\na proof-of-principle implementation of this measurement-only blind quantum\ncomputing, exploiting a photonic setup to generate four-qubit cluster states\nfor computation and verification. Feasible technological requirements for the\nclient and the device-independent blindness make this scheme very applicable\nfor future secure quantum networks.\n", "  We have studied the future evolution of a recently discovered ULX source P13\nin NGC7793. This source was shown to contain a 5-15$M_{\\odot}$ black hole and a\nmassive 18-23$M_{\\odot}$ B9Ia companion on a 64 day orbit. For low black hole\nmass (5-10$M_{\\odot}$) and high companion mass $\\gtrsim 20 M_{\\odot}$ the\nbinary is predicted to initiate a common envelope evolution in near future and\nsignificantly decrease the orbital separation (6 hr orbit). This leads to a\nhigh probability ($\\sim70\\%$) of the system surviving a supernova explosion\nthat will form a neutron star out of the companion. About one third of the\nsurviving BH-NS systems will merge within Hubble time and be a source of high\nfrequency gravitational radiation. We estimate that the chances of detection of\nBH-NS systems with advanced LIGO/Virgo that form via P13-evolutionary channel\nare at the level of 0.1 yr$^{-1}$ with wide range of allowed probability $0\n\\div 0.6$yr$^{-1}$. This is the fourth empirical estimate of BH-NS merger rate.\n", "  Let G be the three dimensional connected real semisimple Lie group and let\nKAN be the Iwasawa decomposition of G.Let J be the Jacobi group, which is the\nsemidirect product of the two groups Heisenberg group with G. The Jacobi group\nplays an important role in Quantum Mechanics. The purpose of this paper is to\ndefine the Fourier transform in order to obtain the Plancherel theorem for the\ngroup J. To this end a classification of all left ideals of the group algebra\nfor the Jacobi group\n", "  A boson sampling device could efficiently sample from the output probability\ndistribution of noninteracting bosons undergoing many-body interference. This\nproblem is not only classically intractable, but its solution is also believed\nto be classically unverifiable. Hence, a major difficulty in experiment is to\nensure a boson sampling device performs correctly. We present an experimental\nfriendly scheme to extract useful and robust information from the quantum boson\nsamplers based on coarse-grained measurements. The procedure can be applied to\ncertify the equivalence of boson sampling devices while ruling out alternative\nfraudulent devices. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the method and consider the effects of realistic noise. Our\napproach is expected to be generally applicable to other many-body\ncertification tasks beyond the boson sampling problem.\n", "  Following the discovery of 3:2 resonance quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)\nin M82X-1 (Pasham et al. 2014), we have constructed power density spectra (PDS)\nof all 15 (sufficiently long) {\\it XMM-Newton} observations of the\nultraluminous X-ray source NGC1313X-1 ($L_{X}$ $\\approx$ 2$\\times$10$^{40}$\nerg/sec). We detect a strong QPO at a frequency of 0.29$\\pm$0.01 Hz in data\nobtained on 2012 December 16. Subsequent searching of all the remaining\nobservations for a 3:2/2:3 frequency pair revealed a feature at 0.46$\\pm$0.02\nHz on 2003 Dec 13 (frequency ratio of 1.59$\\pm$0.09). The global significance\nof the 0.29 Hz feature considering all frequencies between 0.1 and 4 Hz is $>$\n3.5 $\\sigma$. The significance of the 0.46$\\pm$0.02 Hz QPO is $>$ 3.5$\\sigma$\nfor a search at 2/3 and 3/2 of 0.29 Hz. We also detect lower frequency QPOs\n(32.9$\\pm$2.6 and 79.7$\\pm$1.2 mHz). All the QPOs are super-imposed on a\ncontinuum consisting of flat-topped, band-limited noise, breaking into a\npower-law at a frequency of 16$\\pm$3 mHz and white noise at $\\gtrsim$ 0.1 Hz.\nNGC1313X-1's PDS is analogous to stellar-mass black holes' (StMBHs) PDS in the\nso-called steep power-law state, but with the respective frequencies (both QPOs\nand break frequencies) scaled down by a factor of $\\sim$ 1000. Using the\ninverse mass-to-high-frequency QPO scaling of StMBHs, we estimate NGC1313X-1's\nblack hole mass to be 5000$\\pm$1300 $M_{\\odot}$, consistent with an inference\nfrom the scaling of the break frequency. However, the implied Eddington ratio,\nL$_{Edd}$ $>$ 0.03$\\pm$0.01, is significantly lower compared to StMBHs in the\nsteep power-law state (L$_{Edd}$ $\\gtrsim$ 0.2).\n", "  A knowledge of stellar ages is crucial for our understanding of many\nastrophysical phenomena, and yet ages can be difficult to determine. As they\nbecome older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed\nslowdown in surface rotation. The technique of 'gyrochronology' uses the\nrotation period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age\nmust be used for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested\nfor old stars (older than 1 gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for\nstars in an open cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5 Gyr old), and for\nold field stars whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data\nfor the cluster agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations\nfail to describe the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary\nmodelling, and confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars\nthat are more evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate\ndramatically weakened magnetic braking for old stars can---unlike existing\nmodels---reproduce both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings\nmight suggest a fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos,\nwith the Sun being close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized\nwinds. This weakened braking limits the diagnostic power of gyrochronology for\nthose stars that are more than halfway through their main-sequence lifetimes.\n", "  We initiate a detailed investigation into the assembly of simple\namplituhedron-like building blocks to obtain spaces of physical interest. In\nparticular, we describe the geometric process through which the building\nblocks, which we call positivity sectors, glue together to form the desired\ngeometries. Positivity sectors are seen to naturally segment the space\ndescribing the Lth power of the one-loop amplitude. In this way, we obtain a\ngood understanding of how the geometric complexity of the building blocks can\nbe washed out in the formation of larger spaces. Conversely, the tools we\ndevelop allow us to form spaces of ever greater complexity, a process which is\ncrucial to the construction of the amplituhedron from its triangulations, which\nremains an important open question. We present the full boundary structure of\nall positivity sectors related to the three-loop amplituhedron. We also\nconstruct a practical algorithm that achieves the desired geometric assembly of\npositivity sectors, and make available supporting Mathematica files containing\nthe full boundary structure of all positivity sectors at three loops.\n", "  Heterostructures comprising different monolayer semiconductors provide a new\nsystem for fundamental science and device technologies, such as in the emerging\nfield of valleytronics. Here, we realize valley-specific interlayer excitons in\nmonolayer WSe2-MoSe2 vertical heterostructures. We create interlayer exciton\nspin-valley polarization by circularly polarized optical pumping and determine\na valley lifetime of 40 nanoseconds. This long-lived polarization enables the\nvisualization of the expansion of a valley-polarized exciton cloud over several\nmicrons. The spatial pattern of the polarization evolves into a ring with\nincreasing exciton density, a manifestation of valley exciton exchange\ninteractions. Our work lays a foundation for quantum optoelectronics and\nvalleytronics based on interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  Dynamical analysis of compact groups provides important tests of models of\ncompact group formation and evolution. By compiling 2066 redshifts from\nFLWO/FAST, from the literature, and from SDSS DR12 in the fields of compact\ngroups in \\citet{McC09}, we construct the largest sample of compact groups with\ncomplete spectroscopic redshifts in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.22$. This\nlarge redshift sample shows that the interloper fraction in the \\citet{McC09}\ncompact group candidates is $\\sim 42\\%$. A secure sample of 332 compact groups\nincludes 192 groups with four or more member galaxies and 140 groups with three\nmembers. The fraction of early-type galaxies in these compact groups is 62\\%,\nslightly higher than for the original Hickson compact groups. The velocity\ndispersions of early- and late-type galaxies in compact groups change little\nwith groupcentric radius; the radii sampled are less than $100 ~h^{-1}$ kpc,\nsmaller than the radii typically sampled by members of massive clusters of\ngalaxies. The physical properties of our sample compact groups include size,\nnumber density, velocity dispersion, and local environment; these properties\nslightly differ from those derived for the original Hickson compact groups and\nfor the DPOSS II compact groups. Differences result from subtle differences in\nthe way the group candidates were originally selected. The space density of the\ncompact groups changes little with redshift over the range covered by this\nsample. The approximate constancy of the space density for this sample is a\npotential constraint on the evolution of compact groups on a few Gigayear\ntimescale.\n", "  Present paper provides a new model for perfect fluid sphere filled with\ncharge in higher dimensional spacetime admitting conformal symmetry. We\nconsider a linear equation of state with coefficients fixed by the matching\nconditions at the boundary of the source corresponding to the exterior\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m higher dimensional spacetime. Several physical features\nfor different dimensions, starting from four up to eleven, are briefly\ndiscussed. It is shown that all the features as obtained from the present model\nare physically desirable and valid as far as the observed data set for the\ncompact star $SAX~J1808.4-3658~(SS2)$ is concerned.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated Bianchi Type-III Dark Energy Model in\nf(R,T) theory of gravity proposed by Harko et al. (Phys. Rev. D84 : 024020,\n2011). To find a determinate solution of the field equations we have used (i)\nthe fact that scalar expansion of the space-time is proportional to the shear\nscalar and (ii) a variable deceleration parameter given by Mishra et al. (Int.\nJ. Theor. Phys. 52: 2546, 2013). Physical and kinematical properties of the\nmodel are also discussed. It is observed that our model is in agreement with\nthe recent cosmological observations.\n", "  In some AGN, nuclear dust lanes connected to kpc-scale dust structures\nprovide all the extinction required to obscure the nucleus, challenging the\nrole of the dusty torus proposed by the Unified Model. In this letter we show\nthe pc-scale dust and ionized gas maps of Circinus constructed using\nsub-arcsec-accuracy registration of infrared VLT AO images with optical\n\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} images. We find that the collimation of the\nionized gas does not require a torus but is caused by the distribution of dust\nlanes of the host galaxy on $\\sim$10 pc scales. This finding questions the\npresumed torus morphology and its role at parsec scales, as one of its main\nattributes is to collimate the nuclear radiation, and is in line with\ninterferometric observations which show that most of the pc-scale dust is in\nthe polar direction. We estimate that the nuclear dust lane in Circinus\nprovides $1/3$ of the extinction required to obscure the nucleus. This\nconstitutes a conservative lower limit to the obscuration at the central\nparsecs, where the dust filaments might get optically thicker if they are the\nchannels that transport material from $\\sim$100 pc scales to the centre.\n", "  A device for absorbing and storing short duration impulses in an initially\nuncompressed one-dimensional granular chain is presented. Simply stated, short\nregions of sufficiently soft grains are embedded in a hard granular chain.\nThese grains exhibit long-lived standing waves of predictable frequencies\nregardless of the timing of the arrival of solitary waves from the larger\nmatrix. We explore the origins, symmetry, and energy content of the soft region\nand its intrinsic modes.\n", "  Self-doping in YBa2Cu3Oy starts to switch from a charge balancing of chain\nmetal reduction and plane oxidation to one of chain ligand oxidation (O-) and\nplane reduction on quenching from >600K. Amongst the responses are plane\nexpansions and types of unusually strong superconductivity such as elevated\ntemperature superconductivity (ETS), observed through laser pulsing (Tc=552K*)\nand upon shot quenching (Tc=200K*). We ascribe ETS to limited 3-D\nsuperconductivity due to a correlated system of bond ordering within\nchain-plane sandwiches and propose how to stabilize it. Accordingly, plane\nexpanding n-doping arises from self-doping charge equilibration with local\nchain Cu of two-fold O coordination (2). The dumbbell type bonds of both apical\nO- are a result of high-energy environment and comparable in their metric with\nelectron pairs on the plane. Following empirical Tc=%(2)x11 we suggest\nincreasing %(2) to cause the observed retrograde rise in Tc (photo-induced\nreflectivity edge) to a theoretical limit of Tc=1100K* at 100%(2). We propose\ncompositions and heat treatments based on charge-lattice commensurability.\nPaired charge concentrations on planes, determined by bond ordering based on\nmagic number counts, suggest several promising candidates such as\nc=0.22=2/3a0x3b0, c=0.17=2/3x4 or c=0.080=2/5x5. The latter could be achieved\nwith 32%(2) and display Tc=352K* not only in laser pulsed but in shot quenched\nmaterials.\n", "  We propose a theoretical framework for evaluating the effect of four-fermion\noperators on the mass of composite particles in confining strongly-coupled\ngauge theories. The confining sector is modelled by a non-local Nambu-Jona\nLasinio action, whereas the four-fermion operators, arising from a different\nsector, are local. In order to illustrate the method, we investigate a simple\ntoy model with a global $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\to SU(2)_V$ symmetry breaking,\nand a four-fermion operator breaking $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$ but preserving\n$SU(2)_V$. In the particle spectrum we only include the pseudoscalar isospin\ntriplet, that is the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with chiral\nsymmetry breaking, and the lightest scalar singlet. After checking that the\nnonlocal model successfully accounts for the experimental results in\ntwo-flavour QCD, we investigate the mass spectrum as a function of the\nfour-fermion coupling. For our specific choice of four-fermion operator, we\nfind that the mass of the pseudoscalar triplet grows, whereas the mass of the\nlightest scalar singlet is approximately unaffected, as the four-fermion\ncoupling grows. We argue that these results can be directly tested on the\nlattice, and briefly discuss possible applications of this technique to models\nof dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.\n", "  Calculations of form factor for the radiative decays $V\\rightarrow\nP\\gamma^{*}$ process are performed in the framework of an instant form of\nrelativistic quantum mechanics. The electromagnetic current operator for this\ndecay is constructed. The transition form factor is obtained in the so called\nrelativistic modified impulse approximation (MIA). The current operator\nsatisfies the conditions of Lorentz-covariance and current conservation in MIA.\nThe results of the calculations are compared with the analogous results in the\nlight-front dynamics and in the model of vector meson dominance\n", "  We provide an alternative formulation of the exact calculation of the\ncurrent-voltage characteristic of solar cells which have been modeled with a\nlumped parameters equivalent circuit with one or two diodes. Such models, for\ninstance, are suitable for describing organic solar cells whose current-voltage\ncharacteristic curve has an inflection point, also known as an S-shaped\nanomaly. Our formulation avoids the risk of numerical overflow in the\ncalculation. It is suitable for implementation in Fortran, C or on\nmicro-controllers.\n", "  This study addresses the issue of whether or not a normal distribution\nappropriately represents permeability variations. To do so, (i) the\ndistribution of local fibre volume fraction for each tow is experimentaly\ndetermined by estimation of each pair of local areal density and thickness,\n(ii) the Kozeny-Carmen equation together with the change of variable technique\nare used to compute the PDF of permeability, (iii) using the local values of\nfibre volume fraction, the distribution of local average permeability is\ncomputed and subsequently the goodness of fit of the computed PDF is compared\nwith the distribution of the permeability at microscale level. Finally\nvariability of local permeability at the microscale level is determined. The\nfirst set of results reveals that (1) the relationship between the local areal\ndensity and local thickness in a woven carbon-epoxy composite is modelled by a\nbivariate normal distribution, (2) while fibre volume fraction follows a normal\ndistribution, permeability follows a gamma distribution, (3) this work also\nshows that there is significant agreement between the analytical approach and\nthe simulation results. The second set of results shows that the coefficient of\nvariation of permeability is one order of magnitude larger than that of fibre\nvolume fraction. Future work will consider other variables, such as type of\nfabrics, the degree of fibre preform compaction to determine whether or not the\nbivariate normal model is applicable for a broad range of fabrics.\n", "  In this contribution I will highlight the new challenges for top quark\nphysics at LHC Run II, focusing in particular on the interplay between\nprecision studies on the top quark and searches for new physics. A new strategy\nto search for subtle scenarios of new physics is envisaged. The ability of\ncompute and measure very accurately top quark properties such as its production\nrate, decay properties, e.g rates and distributions, and variables sensitive to\nthe top quark mass is put at the center of this strategy to probe new physics.\n", "  By using the real-space method, switching of a single plasmon interacting\nwith a hybrid nanosystem composed of a semiconductor quantum dot (SQD) and a\nmetallic nanoparticle (MNP) coupled to one-dimensional surface plasmonic\nwaveguide is investigated theoretically. We discussed that the dipole coupling\nbetween an exciton and a localized surface plasmon results in the formation of\na hybrid exciton and the transmission and reflection of the propagating single\nplasmon could be controlled by changing the interparticle distance between the\nSQD and the MNP and the size of the nanoparticles. The controllable transport\nof the propagating single surface plasmon by such a nanosystem discussed here\ncould find the significant potential in the design of next-generation quantum\ndevices such as plasmonic switch, single photon transistor and nanolaser and\nquantum information.\n", "  In the family of the iron-based superconductors, the $RE$FeAsO-type compounds\n(with $RE$ being a rare-earth metal) exhibit the highest bulk superconducting\ntransition temperatures ($T_{\\mathrm{c}}$) up to $55\\ \\textrm{K}$ and thus hold\nthe key to the elusive pairing mechanism. Recently, it has been demonstrated\nthat the intrinsic electronic structure of SmFe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$AsO\n($T_{\\mathrm{c}}=18\\ \\textrm{K}$) is highly nontrivial and consists of multiple\nband-edge singularities in close proximity to the Fermi level. However, it\nremains unclear whether these singularities are generic to the $RE$FeAsO-type\nmaterials and if so, whether their exact topology is responsible for the\naforementioned record $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$. In this work, we use angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate the inherent electronic\nstructure of the NdFeAsO$_{0.6}$F$_{0.4}$ compound with a twice higher\n$T_{\\mathrm{c}}=38\\ \\textrm{K}$. We find a similarly singular Fermi surface and\nfurther demonstrate that the dramatic enhancement of superconductivity in this\ncompound correlates closely with the fine-tuning of one of the band-edge\nsingularities to within a fraction of the superconducting energy gap $\\Delta$\nbelow the Fermi level. Our results provide compelling evidence that the\nband-structure singularities near the Fermi level in the iron-based\nsuperconductors must be explicitly accounted for in any attempt to understand\nthe mechanism of superconducting pairing in these materials.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations yield large amounts of trajectory data. For\ntheir durable storage and accessibility an efficient compression algorithm is\nparamount. State of the art domain-specific algorithms combine quantization,\nHuffman encoding and occasionally domain knowledge. We propose the high\nresolution trajectory compression scheme (HRTC) that relies on piecewise linear\nfunctions to approximate quantized trajectories. By splitting the error budget\nbetween quantization and approximation, our approach beats the current state of\nthe art by several orders of magnitude given the same error tolerance. It\nallows storing samples at far less than one bit per sample. It is simple and\nfast enough to be integrated into the inner simulation loop, store every time\nstep, and become the primary representation of trajectory data.\n", "  The combination of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and galaxy clustering is a\npromising route to measuring the amplitude of matter clustering and testing\nmodified gravity theories of cosmic acceleration. Halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) modeling can extend the approach down to nonlinear scales, but galaxy\nassembly bias could introduce systematic errors by causing the HOD to vary with\nlarge scale environment at fixed halo mass. We investigate this problem using\nthe mock galaxy catalogs created by Hearin & Watson (2013, HW13), which exhibit\nsignificant assembly bias because galaxy luminosity is tied to halo peak\ncircular velocity and galaxy colour is tied to halo formation time. The\npreferential placement of galaxies (especially red galaxies) in older halos\naffects the cutoff of the mean occupation function $\\langle\nN_\\text{cen}(M_\\text{min}) \\rangle$ for central galaxies, with halos in\noverdense regions more likely to host galaxies. The effect of assembly bias on\nthe satellite galaxy HOD is minimal. We introduce an extended, environment\ndependent HOD (EDHOD) prescription to describe these results and fit galaxy\ncorrelation measurements. Crucially, we find that the galaxy-matter\ncross-correlation coefficient, $r_{gm} \\equiv \\xi_{gm} \\cdot [ \\xi_{mm}\n\\xi_{gg} ]^{-1/2}$, is insensitive to assembly bias on scales $r \\gtrsim 1 \\;\nh^{-1}\\text{Mpc}$, even though $\\xi_{gm} $ and $\\xi_{gg} $ are both affected\nindividually. We can therefore recover the correct $\\xi_{mm} $ from the HW13\ngalaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter correlations using either a standard HOD or\nEDHOD fitting method. For $M_r \\leq -19$ or $M_r \\leq -20$ samples the recovery\nof $\\xi_{mm}$ is accurate to 2% or better. For a sample of red $M_r \\leq -20$\ngalaxies we achieve 2% recovery at $r \\gtrsim 2\\;h^{-1}\\text{Mpc}$ with EDHOD\nmodeling but lower accuracy at smaller scales or with a standard HOD fit.\n", "  We have obtained imaging polarimetry of the comet C/2013 R1 (Lovejoy) with\n2-Channel-Focal-Reducer Rozhen instrument at 2m Ritchey-Chr\\'etien-Coud\\'e\ntelescope of the Bulgarian National Astronomical Observatory Rozhen in two dust\ncontinuum filters covering wavelength intervals clear from molecular emissions\nand centred at $4430\\AA$ in (blue filter) and at $6840\\AA$ in (red filter). In\nimaging mode we measured the degree of linear polarisation $17.01\\pm0.09$% in\nthe blue and $18.81\\pm0.02$% in the red, which is in a very good agreement with\nmeasurements of other comets at the similar phase angle. We have also obtained\npolarisation maps in both filters. We found a strong correlation between the\nspatial distribution of the polarisation and the dust colour.\nSpectropolarimetry of the nucleus region shows an increase of the polarisation\nwith wavelength, and a depolarisation in the spectral regions with gas emission\nlines, most noticeable in C$_2$ emission band, which shows a polarisation of\n$6.0\\pm1.1$%.\n", "  Pyrochlore iridates have attracted growing attention because of a theoretical\nprediction of a possible topological semimetal phase originating from\nall-in-all-out spin ordering. Related to the topological band structure, recent\nfindings of the magnetic domain wall conduction have stimulated investigations\nof magnetic domain distribution in this system. Here, we investigate the size\nof magnetic domains in Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ single crystalline thin films by\nmagnetoresistance (MR) using microscale Hall bars. Two distinct magnetic\ndomains of the all-in-all-out spin structure are known to exhibit linear MR but\nwith opposite signs, which enables us to estimate the ratio of the two domains\nin the patterned channel. The linear MR for 80 ${\\times}$ 60 ${\\mu}$m$^2$\nchannel is nearly zero after zero-field cooling, suggesting random distribution\nof domains smaller than the channel size. In contrast, the wide distribution of\nthe value of the linear MR is detected in 2 ${\\times}$ 2 ${\\mu}$m$^2$ channel,\nreflecting the detectable domain size depending on each cooling-cycle. Compared\nto simulation results, we estimate the average size of a single all-in-all-out\nmagnetic domain as 1-2 ${\\mu}$m.\n", "  Quantum coherence as the fundamental characteristic of quantum physics,\nprovides the valuable resource for quantum computation in exceeding the power\nof classical algorithms. The exploration of quantum coherence in relativistic\nsystems is of significance from both the fundamental points of view and\npractical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes\nof scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers\nby resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative\nentropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a\nconsequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with\nparameters $\\alpha=b$ and $\\alpha=\\sqrt{1-b^2}$ have the same initial relative\nentropy coherence at $a=0$ (with $a$ the acceleration), but degrade along two\ndifferent trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing\nvalue in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing\nvalue in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite\nstate possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the\nrelative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum\ncomputation performed by observers in motion relatively.\n", "  On the basis of the model that was successfully applied to KC8, RbC8, and\nCsC8 in 1982, we have calculated the superconducting transition temperature Tc\nfor CaC6 and YbC6 to find that the same model reproduces the observed Tc in\nthose compounds as well, indicating that it is a standard model for\nsuperconductivity in the graphite intercalation compounds with Tc ranging over\nthree orders of magnitude. Further enhancement of Tc well beyond 10 K is also\npredicted. The present method for calculating Tc from first principles is\ncompared with that in the density functional theory for superconductors, with\npaying attention to the feature of determining Tc without resort to the concept\nof the Coulomb pseudopotential.\n", "  We show that suppression of vortices in the Ashkin Teller ferromagnet on a\nsquare lattice splits the order-disorder transition and opens up an\nintermediate phase where the macroscopic symmetry enhances to U(1). When we\nselectively suppress the formation of non-chiral vortices, chiral vortices\nproliferate and replace the U(1) phase with a new phase where chiral symmetry\nis restored. This result demonstrates a fascinating phenomenon in which the\nsymmetry information encoded in topological defects manifests itself in the\nsymmetry of the phase where the defects proliferate. We also show that this\nphenomenon can occur in all $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ ferromagnets with even values of\n$n$.\n", "  Partitioning of red blood cells (RBCs) at the level of bifurcations in the\nmicrocirculatory system affects many physiological functions yet it remains\npoorly understood. We address this problem by using T-shaped microfluidic\nbifurcations as a model. Our computer simulations and in vitro experiments\nreveal that the hematocrit ($\\phi_0$) partition depends strongly on RBC\ndeformability, as long as $\\phi_0 <20$% (within the normal range in\nmicrocirculation), and can even lead to complete deprivation of RBCs in a child\nbranch. Furthermore, we discover a deviation from the Zweifach-Fung effect\nwhich states that the child branch with lower flow rate recruits less RBCs than\nthe higher flow rate child branch. At small enough $\\phi_0$, we get the inverse\nscenario, and the hematocrit in the lower flow rate child branch is even higher\nthan in the parent vessel. We explain this result by an intricate up-stream RBC\norganization and we highlight the extreme dependence of RBC transport on\ngeometrical and cell mechanical properties. These parameters can lead to\nunexpected behaviors with consequences on the microcirculatory function and\noxygen delivery in healthy and pathological conditions.\n", "  The history of the observations of RR Lyr variables started in the XIXth\ncentury, more than 120 years ago. The very long time baseline of available data\ncombined with the short period of RR Lyrae variables offer an unique\nopportunity to look at their past as a treasure of valuable information. At\nthis purpose, the amateur/professional association Groupe Europeen\nd'Observations Stellaires (GEOS) has built a database aimed to gather all the\npublished maxima. We could study the period changes due to stellar evolution.\nMost of the 123 scrutinized RRab stars does not show any significant period\nvariation. This reflects the fact that the rapid evolution is confined in short\nevolutionary phases. Notwithstanding this, we could put in evidence period\nincreases in 27 stars and decreases in 21 ones. We also used the GEOS database\nto study the Blazhko effect of galactic RRab stars. The closed curves\nrepresenting the Blazhko effect are constructed by plotting the magnitudes at\nmaximum vs. the O-C values. We obtained a variegate family of Blazhko\n\"potatoes\". We could also reconstruct the changes in the pulsational and\nBlazhko periods of RR Lyr itself, resulted to be completely decoupled.\nMoreover, the amplitude of the Blazhko effect decreased so much to be hardly\ndetectable by looking at the maxima collected in 2014 only. The effect seems to\nstart again in the 2015 data.\n", "  We employ nonlinear autocorrelation measurements to investigate\nplasmon-assisted hot carrier dynamics generated in optical gold antennas. We\ndemonstrate that surface plasmons enable a nonlinear formation of hot carriers,\nproviding thus a unique lever to optimize the energy distribution and\ngeneration efficiency of the photo-excited charges. The temporal response of\nthe carriers' relaxation can be controlled within a range extending from 500~fs\nto 2.5~ps. By conducting a quantitative analysis of the dynamics, we determine\nthe nonlinear absorption cross-section of individual optical antennas. As such,\nthis work provides strong insights on the understanding of plasmon-induced hot\ncarrier generation, especially in the view of applications where the time\nresponse plays a preponderant role.\n", "  Stimulated by the recent realization of three dimensional topological\ninsulator nanowire interfer- ometers, a theoretical analysis of quantum\ninterference effects on the low energy spectrum of Bi2Se3 nanowires is\npresented. The electronic properties are analyzed in nanowires with circular,\nsquare and rectangular cross-sections starting from a continuum three\ndimensional model with particular emphasis on magnetic and geometrical effects.\nThe theoretical study is based on numerically exact diagonalizations of the\ndiscretized model for all the geometries. In the case of the cylindrical wire,\nan approximate analytical solution of the continuum model is also discussed.\nAlthough a magnetic field corresponding to half quantum flux is expected to\nclose the band gap induced by Berry phase, in all the studied geometries with\nfinite area cross-sections, the gap closes for magnetic fields typically larger\nthan those expected. Furthermore, unexpectedly, due to geometrical quantum\ninterference effects, for a rectangular wire with a sufficiently large aspect\nratio and smaller side ranging from 50{\\deg}A and 100{\\deg}A, the gap closes\nfor a specific finite area cross-section without the application of a magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The eigenstates of a real or complex cubic anharmonic oscillator are\ninvestigated using original and alternative methods. The procedure consists of\ndetermining global solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation that comply with the\npertinent boundary conditions and allows us to obtain, in a very simple way,\nthe eigenenergies and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. Scattering by a real\ncubic potential is investigated as a specific case.\n", "  In contrast to claims by Barbour, Koslowski and Mercati, their \"Janus point\nsolution\" does require a very improbable selection condition. While\ngravitational contraction in an expanding universe may then represent the\nmaster arrow of time, it would be insufficient by itself to describe the time\nasymmetry of the observed world.\n", "  The Bohrification program is an attempt to interpret Bohr's mature doctrine\nof classical concepts as well as his earlier correspondence principle in the\noperator-algebraic formulation of quantum theory pioneered by von Neumann. In\nparticular, this involves the study of commutative C*-algebras in relationship\nto noncommutative ones. This relationship may take the form of either exact\nBohrification, in which one studies commutative unital C*-subalgebras of a\ngiven noncommutative C*-algebra, or asymptotic Bohrification, which involves\ndeformations of commutative C*-algebras into noncommutative ones. Implementing\nthe doctrine of classical concepts, exact Bohrification is an appropriate\nframework for the Kochen-Specker Theorem and for (intuitionistic) quantum\nlogic, culminating in the topos-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics that\nhas been developed since 1998. Asymptotic Bohrification was inspired by the\ncorrespondence principle and forms the right conceptual and mathematical\nframework for the explanation of the emergence of the classical world from\nquantum theory (incorporating the measurement problem and the closely related\nissue of spontaneous symmetry breaking). The Born rule may be derived from both\nexact and asymptotic Bohrification, which reflects the Janus faces of\nprobability as applying to individual random events and to relative\nfrequencies, respectively. We review the history, the goals, and the\nachievements of this program so far.\n", "  Photon subtraction can enhance the performance of continuous-variable quantum\nkey distribution (CV QKD). However, the enhancement effect will be reduced by\nthe imperfections of practical devices, especially the limited efficiency of a\nsingle-photon detector. In this paper, we propose a non-Gaussian postselection\nmethod to emulate the photon substraction used in coherent-state CV QKD\nprotocols. The virtual photon subtraction not only can avoid the complexity and\nimperfections of a practical photon-subtraction operation, which extends the\nsecure transmission distance as the ideal case does, but also can be adjusted\nflexibly according to the channel parameters to optimize the performance.\nFurthermore, our preliminary tests on the information reconciliation suggest\nthat in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, the performance of reconciliating\nthe postselected non-Gaussian data is better than that of the Gaussian data,\nwhich implies the feasibility of implementing this method practically.\n", "  We have developed a new retrieval approach to modelling near-infrared spectra\nof Uranus that represents a significant improvement over previous modelling\nmethods. We reanalysed IRTF/SpeX observations of Uranus observed in 2009\ncovering the wavelength range 0.8 to 1.8 microns and reported by Tice et al.\n(2013). By retrieving the imaginary refractive index spectra of cloud particles\nwe are able to consistently define the real part of the refractive index\nspectra, through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, and thus determine self-consistent\nextinction cross-section, single-scattering and phase-function spectra for the\nclouds and hazes in Uranus' atmosphere. We tested two different cloud-modelling\nschemes used in conjunction with the temperature/methane profile of Baines et\nal. (1995), a reanalysis of the Voyager-2 radio-occultation observations\nperformed by Sromovsky, Fry and Tomasko (2011), and a recent determination from\nSpitzer (Orton et al., 2014). We find that both cloud-modelling schemes\nrepresent the observed centre-of-disc spectrum of Uranus well, and both require\nsimilar cloud scattering properties of the main cloud residing at approximately\n2 bars. However, a modified version of the Sromovsky, Fry and Tomasko (2011)\nmodel, with revised spectral properties of the lowest cloud layer, fits\nslightly better at shorter wavelengths and is more consistent with the expected\nvertical position of Uranus' methane cloud. We find that the bulk of the\nreflected radiance from Uranus arises from a thick cloud at approximately the 2\nbar level, composed of particles that are significantly more absorbing at\nwavelengths > 1.0 micron than they are at wavelengths < 1.0 micron. This\nspectral information provides a possible constraint on the identity of the main\nparticle type.\n", "  Using repeated Laplace transform, We find an analytical solution for DGLAP\nevolution equations for extracting the pion, kaon and proton Fragmentation\nFunctions (FFs) at NLO approximation. We also study the symmetry breaking of\nthe sea quarks Fragmentation Functions, $D_{\\bar q}^h (z,Q^2)$ and simply\nseparated them according to their mass ratio. Finally, we calculate the total\nFragmentation Functions of these hadrons and compare them with experimental\ndata and those from global fits. Our results show a good agreement with the FFs\nobtained from global parameterizations as well as with the experimental data.\n", "  The technologies of heating, photovoltaics, water photocatalysis and\nartificial photosynthesis depend on the absorption of light and novel\napproaches such as coherent absorption from a standing wave promise total\ndissipation of energy. Extending the control of absorption down to very low\nlight levels and eventually to the single photon regime is of great interest\nyet remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate the coherent absorption of\nsingle photons in a deeply sub-wavelength 50% absorber. We show that while\nabsorption of photons from a travelling wave is probabilistic, standing wave\nabsorption can be observed deterministically, with nearly unitary probability\nof coupling a photon into a mode of the material, e.g. a localised plasmon when\nthis is a metamaterial excited at the plasmon resonance. These results bring a\nbetter understanding of the coherent absorption process, which is of central\nimportance for light harvesting, detection, sensing and photonic data\nprocessing applications.\n", "  The three-dimensional organisation of chromosomes can be probed using methods\nsuch as Capture-C. However it is unclear how such population level data relates\nto the organisation within a single cell, and the mechanisms leading to the\nobserved interactions are still largely obscure. We present a polymer modelling\nscheme based on the assumption that chromosome architecture is maintained by\nprotein bridges which form chromatin loops. To test the model we perform FISH\nexperiments and also compare with Capture-C data. Starting merely from the\nlocations of protein binding sites, our model accurately predicts the\nexperimentally observed chromatin interactions, revealing a population of 3D\nconformations.\n", "  We theoretically report an analog of photon-assisted tunneling (PAT) in a\nperiodically driven lattice array without a static biased potential by studying\na three-channel waveguide system. This analog of PAT can be achieved by only\nperiodically modulating the top waveguide and adjusting the distance between\nthe bottom and its adjacent waveguide. It is numerically shown that the PAT\nresonances also exist in the five-channel waveguide system and probably exist\nin the waveguide arrays with other odd numbers of waveguides, but they will\nbecome weak as the number of waveguides increases. With origin different from\ntraditional PAT, this type of PAT found in our work is closely linked to the\nexistence of the zero-energy (dark) Floquet states. It is readily observable\nunder currently accessible experimental conditions and may be useful for\ncontrolling light propagation in waveguide arrays.\n", "  The longest microlensing events provide enough information to estimate the\nmass and distance of the lens. Among hundreds of millions of stars which were\nmonitored for many years by the OGLE project we selected those with clear\nparallax effect and derived the mass function of lensing objects in the Milky\nWay. We also found candidates for microlensing stellar-mass single black holes.\nWe discuss how Gaia superb astrometry will help in measuring masses of remnants\nin currently on-going and future microlensing events.\n", "  We present the results of optical spectroscopic observations of 54 candidate\nevolved massive stars revealed through the detection of mid-infrared nebulae of\nvarious shapes surrounding them with the {\\it Spitzer Space Telescope} and {\\it\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer}. These observations, carried out with the\nSouthern African Large Telescope (SALT) in 2010-2015, led to the discovery of\nabout two dozens emission-line stars, of which 15 stars we classify as\ncandidate luminous blue variables (cLBVs). Spectroscopic and photometric\nmonitoring revealed significant changes in the spectra and brightness of four\nnewly identified cLBVs, meaning that they are new members of the class of bona\nfide LBVs. We present an updated list of the Galactic bona fide LBVs.\nCurrently, this list contains eighteen stars, of which more than 70 per cent\nare associated with circumstellar nebulae. We also discovered a very rare [WN]\nstar - the central star of the planetary nebula Abell 48, and a WN3 star in a\nclose, eccentric binary system with an O6V star in the Large Magellanic Cloud -\nthe first-ever extragalactic massive star identified via detection of a\ncircular shell around it. Most of the remaining targets are tentatively\nclassified as OB, A and M stars.\n", "  Hard sphere colloidal particles are a basic model system for general research\ninto phase behavior, ordering and out-equilibrium glass transitions.\nExperimentally it has been shown that oscillatory shearing of a monodisperse\nhard sphere glass, produces two different crystal orientations; a Face Centered\nCubic (FCC) crystal with the close packed direction parallel to shear at high\nstrains and an FCC crystal with the close packed direction perpendicular to\nshear at low strains. Here, using Brownian dynamics simulations of hard sphere\nparticles, we have examined high volume fraction shear-induced crystals under\noscillatory shear as well as the same volume fraction glass counterparts. We\nfind that, while the displacements under shear of the glass are isotropic, the\nsheared FCC crystal structures oriented parallel to shear, are anisotropic due\nto the cooperative motion of velocity-vorticity layers of particles sliding\nover each other. These sliding layers generally result in lower stresses and\nless overall particle displacements. Additionally, from the two crystal types,\nthe perpendicular crystal exhibits less stresses and displacements at smaller\nstrains, however at larger strains, the sliding layers of the parallel crystal\nare found to be more efficient in minimizing stresses and displacements, while\nthe perpendicular crystal becomes unstable. The findings of this work suggest\nthat the process of shear-induced ordering for a colloidal glass is facilitated\nby large out of cage displacements, which allow the system to explore the\nenergy landscape and find the minima in energy, stresses and displacements by\nconfiguring particles into a crystal oriented parallel to shear.\n", "  It was recently pointed out that identifiability of quantum random walks and\nhidden Markov processes underlie the same principles. This analogy immediately\nraises questions on the existence of hidden states also in quantum random walks\nand their relationship with earlier debates on hidden states in quantum\nmechanics. The overarching insight was that not only hidden Markov processes,\nbut also quantum random walks are finitary processes. Since finitary processes\nenjoy nice asymptotic properties, this also encourages to further investigate\nthe asymptotic properties of quantum random walks. Here, answers to all these\nquestions are given. Quantum random walks, hidden Markov processes and finitary\nprocesses are put into a unifying model context. In this context, quantum\nrandom walks are seen to not only enjoy nice ergodic properties in general, but\nalso intuitive quantum-style asymptotic properties. It is also pointed out how\nhidden states arising from our framework relate to hidden states in earlier,\nprominent treatments on topics such as the EPR paradoxon or Bell's\ninequalities.\n", "  We show that Lyapunov exponents and stability exponents are equal in the case\nof product of $i.i.d$ isotropic(also known as bi-unitarily invariant) random\nmatrices. We also derive aysmptotic distribution of singular values and\neigenvalues of these product random matrices. Moreover, Lyapunov exponents are\ndistinct, unless the random matrices are random scalar multiples of Haar\nunitary matrices or orthogonal matrices. As a corollary of above result, we\nshow probability that product of $n$ $i.i.d$ real isotropic random matrices has\nall eigenvalues real goes to one as $n \\to \\infty$. Also, in the proof of a\nlemma, we observe that a real (complex) Ginibre matrix can be written as\nproduct of a random lower triangular matrix and an independent truncated Haar\northogonal (unitary) matrix.\n", "  PSR B0919+06 generally radiates radio pulses in a normal phase range. It has\nbeen known for its occasional perplexing abnormal emission events wherein\nindividual pulses come to an earlier phase range for a few tens of periods and\nthen returns to its usual phase. Heretofore, only a few such events have been\navailable for study. We observed PSR B0919+06 for about 30 hours using the\nJiamusi 66-m telescope at Jiamusi Deep Space Station at S-band, and detected 92\nabnormal emission events. We identify four types of events based on the\nabrupted or gradual phase-shifting of individual pulses. The abnormal emission\nevents are seen to occur randomly some every 1000 to 3000 periods, and they\naffect the leading edge of the mean profile by up to 2\\% in amplitude. The\nabnormal emission events are probably related to gradual changes of emission\nprocessing in the pulsar magnetosphere.\n", "  Non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation in decoherence-free subspaces\nprotects quantum information from control imprecisions and decoherence. For the\nnon-collective decoherence that each qubit has its own bath, we show the\nimplementations of two non-commutable holonomic single-qubit gates and one\nholonomic nontrivial two-qubit gate that compose a universal set of\nnon-adiabatic holonomic quantum gates in decoherence-free-subspaces of the\ndecoupling group, with an encoding rate of $\\frac{N-2}{N}$. The proposed scheme\nis robust against control imprecisions and the non-collective decoherence, and\nits non-adiabatic property ensures less operation time. We demonstrate that our\nproposed scheme can be realized by utilizing only two-qubit interactions rather\nthan many-qubit interactions. Our results reduce the complexity of practical\nimplementation of holonomic quantum computation in experiments. We also discuss\nthe physical implementation of our scheme in coupled microcavities.\n", "  We describe some applications of group- and bundle-theoretic methods in solid\nstate physics, showing how symmetries lead to a proof of the localization of\nelectrons in gapped crystalline solids, as e.g. insulators and semiconductors.\nWe shortly review the Bloch-Floquet decomposition of periodic operators, and\nthe related concepts of Bloch frames and composite Wannier functions. We show\nthat the latter are almost-exponentially localized if and only if there exists\na smooth periodic Bloch frame, and that the obstruction to the latter condition\nis the triviality of a Hermitian vector bundle, called the Bloch bundle. The\nrole of additional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, as time-reversal and\nspace-reflection symmetry, is discussed, showing how time-reversal symmetry\nimplies the triviality of the Bloch bundle, both in the bosonic and in the\nfermionic case. Moreover, the same $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry allows to define a\nfiner notion of isomorphism and, consequently, to define new topological\ninvariants, which agree with the indices introduced by Fu, Kane and Mele in the\ncontext of topological insulators.\n", "  We consider low--dimensional dynamical systems with a mixed phase space and\ndiscuss the typical appearance of slow, polynomial decay of correlations: in\nparticular we emphasize how this mixing rate is related to large deviations\nproperties.\n", "  This paper considers the dynamics of edges in a network. The Dynamic Bond\nPercolation (DBP) process models, through stochastic local rules, the\ndependence of an edge $(a,b)$ in a network on the states of its neighboring\nedges. Unlike previous models, DBP does not assume statistical independence\nbetween different edges. In applications, this means for example that failures\nof transmission lines in a power grid are not statistically independent, or\nalternatively, relationships between individuals (dyads) can lead to changes in\nother dyads in a social network. We consider the time evolution of the\nprobability distribution of the network state, the collective states of all the\nedges (bonds), and show that it converges to a stationary distribution. We use\nthis distribution to study the emergence of global behaviors like consensus\n(i.e., catastrophic failure or full recovery of the entire grid) or coexistence\n(i.e., some failed and some operating substructures in the grid). In\nparticular, we show that, depending on the local dynamical rule, different\nnetwork substructures, such as hub or triangle subgraphs, are more prone to\nfailure.\n", "  We analyze star-type networks of phase oscillators by virtue of two methods.\nFor identical oscillators we adopt the Watanabe-Strogatz approach, that gives\nfull an- alytical description of states, rotating with constant frequency. For\nnonidentical oscillators, such states can be obtained by virtue of the\nself-consistent approach in a parametric form. In this case stability analysis\ncannot be performed, however with the help of direct numerical simulations we\nshow which solutions are stable and which not. We consider this system as a\nmodel for a drum orchestra, where we assume that the drummers follow the signal\nof the leader without listening to each other and the coupling parameters are\ndetermined by a geometrical organization of the orchestra.\n", "  Recently, a novel algorithm for computing the density of states in\nstatistical systems and quantum field theories has been proposed. The same\nmethod can be applied to theories at finite density affected by the notorious\nsign problem, reducing a high-dimensional oscillating integral to a more\ntractable one-dimensional one. As an example we applied the method to the\nrelativistic Bose gas.\n", "  We study the thermal evolution of neutron stars containing deconfined quark\nmatter in their core. Such objects are generally referred to as quark-hybrid\nstars. The confined hadronic matter in their core is described in the framework\nof non-linear relativistic nuclear field theory. For the quark phase we use a\nnon-local extension of the SU(3) Nambu Jona-Lasinio model with vector\ninteractions. The Gibbs condition is used to model phase equilibrium between\nconfined hadronic matter and deconfined quark matter. Our study indicates that\nhigh-mass neutron stars may contain between 35 and 40 % deconfined quark-hybrid\nmatter in their cores. Neutron stars with canonical masses of around $1.4\\,\nM_\\odot$ would not contain deconfined quark matter. The central proton\nfractions of the stars are found to be high, enabling them to cool rapidly.\nVery good agreement with the temperature evolution established for the neutron\nstar in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) is obtained for one of our models (based on the\npopular NL3 nuclear parametrization), if the protons in the core of our stellar\nmodels are strongly paired, the repulsion among the quarks is mildly repulsive,\nand the mass of Cas A has a canonical value of $1.4\\, M_\\odot$.\n", "  The mass of the bottom quark can be determined with high precision from\nmoments of the pair-production cross section sigma(e+ e- -> b bbar) near\nthreshold. We present the first complete NNNLO determination from\nnon-relativistic sum rules, obtaining a bottom-quark mass of mb^PS(2 GeV) =\n(4.532 +0.013 -0.039) GeV in the potential-subtracted scheme. For the mass in\nthe MSbar scheme we find mb^MS(mb^MS) = (4.203 +0.016 -0.034) GeV using the\nrecently computed four-loop correction to the scheme conversion.\n", "  Astrophysical tests of the stability of fundamental couplings, such as the\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$, are a powerful probe of new physics. Recently\nthese measurements, combined with local atomic clock tests and Type Ia\nsupernova and Hubble parameter data, were used to constrain the simplest class\nof dynamical dark energy models where the same degree of freedom is assumed to\nprovide both the dark energy and (through a dimensionless coupling, $\\zeta$, to\nthe electromagnetic sector) the $\\alpha$ variation. One caveat of these\nanalyses was that it was based on fiducial models where the dark energy\nequation of state was described by a single parameter (effectively its present\nday value, $w_0$). Here we relax this assumption and study broader dark energy\nmodel classes, including the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder and Early Dark Energy\nparametrizations. Even in these extended cases we find that the current data\nconstrains the coupling $\\zeta$ at the $10^{-6}$ level and $w_0$ to a few\npercent (marginalizing over other parameters), thus confirming the robustness\nof earlier analyses. On the other hand, the additional parameters are typically\nnot well constrained. We also highlight the implications of our results for\nconstraints on violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle and improvements to\nbe expected from forthcoming measurements with high-resolution ultra-stable\nspectrographs.\n", "  We consider a formulation of initial problem for Kolmogorov equation that\ncorresponds a localized source of particles to be scattered by medium with\ngiven scattering amplitude density (scattering indicatrix). The multiple\nscattering expansion and amplitudes are introduced and the corresponding series\nsolution of the equation is constructed. We investigate the multiple integral\nrepresentation for the series terms, transform it into a form, convenient for\nestimations and prove convergence of the series. An application to light beam\nscattering and LIDAR problem solution is outlined.\n", "  We postulate that validity of the Backus (1962) average, whose weights are\nlayer thicknesses, is limited to waves whose incidence is nearly vertical. The\naccuracy of this average decreases with the increase of the source-receiver\noffset. However, if the weighting is adjusted by the distance travelled by a\nsignal in each layer, such a modified average results in accurate predictions\nof traveltimes through these layers.\n", "  We show that the Backus (1962) equivalent-medium average, which is an average\nover a spatial variable, and the Gazis et al. (1963) effective-medium average,\nwhich is an average over a symmetry group, do not commute, in general. They\ncommute in special cases, which we exemplify.\n", "  Various experiments have been conducted to search for the radio emission from\nultra-high-energy particles interacting in the lunar regolith. Although they\nhave not yielded any detections, they have been successful in establishing\nupper limits on the flux of these particles. I present a review of these\nexperiments in which I re-evaluate their sensitivity to radio pulses,\naccounting for effects which were neglected in the original reports, and\ncompare them with prospective near-future experiments. In several cases, I find\nthat past experiments were substantially less sensitive than previously\nbelieved. I apply existing analytic models to determine the resulting limits on\nthe fluxes of ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. In the latter case,\nI amend the model to accurately reflect the fraction of the primary particle\nenergy which manifests in the resulting particle cascade, resulting in a\nsubstantial improvement in the estimated sensitivity to cosmic rays. Although\nthese models are in need of further refinement, in particular to incorporate\nthe effects of small-scale lunar surface roughness, their application here\nindicates that a proposed experiment with the LOFAR telescope would test\npredictions of the neutrino flux from exotic-physics models, and an experiment\nwith a phased-array feed on a large single-dish telescope such as the Parkes\nradio telescope would allow the first detection of cosmic rays with this\ntechnique, with an expected rate of one detection per 140 hours.\n", "  We have developed an affordable, portable college level radio telescope for\namateur radio astronomy which can be used to provide hands-on experience with\nthe fundamentals of a radio telescope and an insight into the realm of radio\nastronomy. With our set-up one can measure brightness temperature and flux of\nthe Sun at 11.2 GHz and calculate the beam width of the antenna. The set-up\nuses commercially available satellite television receiving system and parabolic\ndish antenna. We report the detection of point sources like Saturn and extended\nsources like the galactic arm of the Milky way. We have also developed python\npipeline, which are available for free download, for data acquisition and\nvisualization.\n", "  A description of the proposed detector(s) for DUNE at LBNF\n", "  Existing theoretical models of the interfacial thermal conductance, i.e.,\nKapitza conductance, of insulating solid-fluid interfaces only consider bulk\nproperties, e.g., acoustic mismatch model and diffuse mismatch model. In this\nwork, we propose a classical lattice dynamical model calculation of the Kapitza\nconductance, thereby incorporating interfacial structural details. In our\nmodel, we assume that heat is mostly carried by phonons in the solid, and that\nsound waves carry diffusive heat from the interface into the bulk of the\nliquid, where both longitudinal and transverse sound waves are considered.\nSound wave dispersion is calculated from the fluid pair distribution function,\nevaluated using approximate integral equation theories (i.e., Percus-Yevick,\nHypernetted-chain approximation). The Kapitza conductance of the solid-fluid\ninterface is obtained from the phonon transmission coefficient at the\ninterface. We determine the interfacial phonon transmission coefficient by\nsolving the coupled equations of motion for the interfacial solid and fluid\natoms. As an illustrative example, we derive the Kapitza conductance of solid\nargon-fluid neon interface, with pair-wise Lennard-Jones interactions.\n", "  Resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) can mitigate the edge-localized modes\n(ELMs), i.e. cause a change of the ELM character towards smaller energy loss\nand higher frequency. During mitigation a change of the spatial structure of\nELM loads on divertor was observed on DIII-D and MAST: the power is deposited\npredominantly in the footprint structures formed by the magnetic perturbation.\nIn the present contribution we develop a theory explaining this effect, based\non the idea that part of the ELM loss is caused by parallel transport in the\nhomoclinic tangle formed by the magnetic perturbation of the ELM. The modified\ntangle resulting from the combination of the ELM perturbation and the applied\nRMP has the expected property of bringing open field lines in the same areas as\nthe tangle from the RMP alone. We show that this explanation is consistent with\nfeatures of the mitigated ELMs on MAST.\n  We in addition validated our theory by an analysis of simulations of\nmitigated ELMs using the code JOREK. We produced detailed laminar plots of\nfield lines on the divertor in the JOREK runs with an ELM, an applied RMP, and\nan ELM mitigated by the presence of the RMP. The results for an ELM clearly\nshow a high-n rotating footprint structure appearing during the nonlinear stage\nof the ELM, which is not present in the early stage of the ELM. The results for\na n=2 RMP from the ELM control coils show the expected n=2 footprint structure.\nThe results for the mitigated ELM show a similar structure, modulated by a\nhigher n perturbation of the ELM, consistent with our theory.\n", "  In this work, we explore a new direction by complementing the game-theoretic\napplications of nonlocal correlations through appropriately formulated games\nusing temporal quantum correlations. In the context of Bayesian games, we show\nthe way temporal correlations can be utilized, thereby leading to quantum\nstrategies that are impossible to simulate in a classical world. Furthermore,\nby educing some intriguing characteristics of projective measurements performed\nbetween two temporally separated measurements on a given system, we also\nconstruct some specific types of Biased Bayesian games. Finally, we impart a\nnew dimension to the cooperative Bayesian Nonlocal Game introduced in [Nat.\nComm. 4, 2057 (2013)] through expedient inclusion of temporal correlations in\nthe EPR-Bohm setting.\n", "  We study the flavor structure of the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized parton\ndistributions (transversity GPDs) in the large-N_c limit of QCD. It is found\nthat in the distributions H_T and E_T-tilde the flavor-nonsinglet component u -\nd is leading in the 1/N_c expansion, while in E_T and H_T-tilde it is the\nflavor-singlet component u + d. This pattern is consistent with the flavor\nstructure extracted from hard exclusive pi^0 and eta electroproduction data,\nassuming that the processes are dominated by the twist-3 mechanism involving\nthe chiral-odd pseudoscalar meson distribution amplitudes.\n", "  We study stability of axisymmetric liquid bridges between two axisymmetric\nsolid bodies in the absence of gravity under arbitrary asymmetric perturbations\nwhich are expanded into a set of angular Fourier modes. We determine the\nstability region boundary for every angular mode in case of both fixed and free\ncontact lines. Application of this approach allows us to demonstrate existence\nof stable convex nodoid menisci between two spheres.\n", "  The standard argument for the uniqueness of the Einstein field equation is\nbased on Lovelock's Theorem, the relevant statement of which is restricted to\nfour dimensions. I prove a theorem similar to Lovelock's, with a physically\nmodified assumption: that the geometric object representing curvature in the\nEinstein field equation ought to have the physical dimension of stress-energy.\nThe theorem is stronger than Lovelock's in two ways: it holds in all\ndimensions, and so supports a generalized argument for uniqueness; it does not\nassume that the desired tensor depends on the metric only up second-order\npartial-derivatives, that condition being a consequence of the proof. This has\nconsequences for understanding the nature of the cosmological constant and\ntheories of higher-dimensional gravity. Another consequence of the theorem is\nthat it makes precise the sense in which there can be no gravitational\nstress-energy tensor in general relativity. Along the way, I prove a result of\nsome interest about the second jet-bundle of the bundle of metrics over a\nmanifold.\n", "  This experimental study aims to determine the effect of limestone filler on\nconcrete expansion due to delayed ettringite formation (DEF). Different mortars\nmade with different sizes and percentages of limestone filler and Portland\ncement CEM I 52.5N are conserved in water. The expansion of the specimens is\nmeasured. Results show that DEF is not inhibited by limestone filler. The\nkinetics and the amplitude of the swelling depend on the size of the limestone\nfiller. The volume fraction of aggregates changes only the kinetics: the\nrelation between swelling and water uptake depends only on the size of the\naggregates.\n", "  A recent experiment [W. A. Shelton {\\emph{et\\ al.}}, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ E\n{\\bf{71}}, 036204 (2005)] measured the response of a nanorod trapped in a\nviscous fluid to the torque produced by an incident optical frequency\nelectromagnetic wave. The nonlinear differential equation describing this\nmotion is similar that of a damped, driven pendulum. The overdamped limit of\nthis equation has been solved analytically. We analyze the properties of this\nsolution in comparison to the observations of the experiment and find very\nclose agreement.\n", "  We propose a unified modelling framework that theoretically justifies the\nmain empirical regularities characterizing the international trade network.\nEach country is associated to a Polya urn whose composition controls the\npropensity of the country to trade with other countries. The urn composition is\nupdated through the walk of the Reinforced Urn Process of Muliere et al.\n(2000). The model implies a local preferential attachment scheme and a power\nlaw right tail behaviour of bilateral trade flows. Different assumptions on the\nurns' reinforcement parameters account for local clustering, path-shortening\nand sparsity. Likelihood-based estimation approaches are facilitated by\nfeasible likelihood analytical derivation in various network settings. A\nsimulated example and the empirical results on the international trade network\nare discussed.\n", "  One of the key questions in observational cosmology is the identification of\nthe sources responsible for ionisation of the Universe after the cosmic Dark\nAges, when the baryonic matter was neutral. The currently identified distant\ngalaxies are insufficient to fully reionise the Universe by redshift z~6, but\nlow-mass star-forming galaxies are thought to be responsible for the bulk of\nthe ionising radiation. Since direct observations at high redshift are\ndifficult for a variety of reasons, one solution is to identify local proxies\nof this galaxy population. However, starburst galaxies at low redshifts are\ngenerally opaque to their ionising radiation. This radiation with small escape\nfractions of 1-3% is directly detected only in three low-redshift galaxies.\nHere we present far-ultraviolet observations of a nearby low-mass star-forming\ngalaxy, J0925+1403, selected for its compactness and high excitation. The\ngalaxy is leaking ionising radiation, with an escape fraction of ~8%. The total\nnumber of photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to ionize\nintergalactic medium material, which is about 40 times more massive than the\nstellar mass of the galaxy.\n", "  Two types of penetrating probes, direct photon and QCD jets, are investigated\nin the background of a small and rapidly expanding droplet of quark-gluon\nplasma. The additional thermal electromagnetic radiation results in a\n$\\sim$50\\% enhancement of the direct photons. In high multiplicity p+Pb\ncollisions, jets can lose a sizeable fraction of their initial energy, leading\nto a charged hadron $R_\\mathrm{pA}$ of $\\sim$0.8 at a transverse momentum\naround 10\\,GeV. Those two proposed measurements can help understand the\napparent collective behaviour observed in small collision systems.\n", "  We construct a new subgrid scale (SGS) stress model for representing the\nsmall scale effects in large eddy simulation (LES) of incompressible flows. We\nuse the covariance tensor for representing the Reynolds stress and include\nClark's model for the cross stress. The Reynolds stress is obtained\nanalytically from Cinlar random velocity field, which is based on vortex\nstructures observed in the ocean at the subgrid scale. The validity of the\nmodel is tested with turbulent channel flow computed in OpenFOAM. It is\ncompared with the most frequently used Smagorinsky and one-equation eddy SGS\nmodels through DNS data.\n", "  Discovery of binary systems among RR Lyrae stars belongs to challenges of\npresent astronomy. So far, none of classical RR Lyrae stars was clearly\nconfirmed that it is a part of an eclipsing system. For this reason we studied\ntwo RR Lyrae stars, VX Her and RW Ari, in which changes assigned to eclipses\nwere detected in sixties and seventies of the 20th century. In this paper our\npreliminary results based on analysis of new photometric measurements are\npresented as well as the results from the detailed analysis of original\nmeasurements. A new possible eclipsing system, RZ Cet was identified in the\narchive data. Our analysis rather indicates errors in measurements and\nreductions of the old data than real changes for all three stars.\n", "  Magnetic domain-wall (DW) has been widely investigated for future memory and\ncomputing systems. However, energy efficiency and stability become two major\nchallenges of DW-based systems. In this letter, we first propose exploiting\nskyrmions as on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for DW-based systems, owing\nto the topological stability, small size and ultra-low depinning current\ndensity. In the proposed technique, data are processed in the form of DWs but\nare transmitted instead in the form of skyrmions. The reversible conversion\nbetween a skyrmion and a DW pair can be physically achieved by connecting a\nwide and a narrow magnetic nanowire. Our proposed technique can realize highly\ncompact, robust and energy-efficient on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for\nDW-based systems, enabling the system to take advantages of both the DW and\nskyrmion.\n", "  Self-assembling peptides (SAPs) have the ability to spontaneously assemble\ninto ordered nanostructures enabling the manufacture of \"designer\"\nnanomaterials. The reversible molecular association of SAPs has been shown to\noffer great promise in therapeutics via for example, the design of biomimetic\nassemblies for hard tissue regeneration. This could be further exploited for\nnovel nano/micro diagnostic tools. However, self-assembled peptide gels are\noften associated with inherent weak and transient mechanical properties. Their\nincorporation into polymeric matrices has been considered as a potential\nstrategy to enhance their mechanical stability. This study focuses on the\nincorporation of an 11-residue peptide, P11-8 (peptide sequence:\nCH3CO-Gln-Gln-Arg-Phe-Orn-Trp-Orn-Phe-Glu-Gln-Gln-NH2) within a fibrous\nscaffold of poly ({\\epsilon}-caprolactone) (PCL). In this study an\nelectrospinning technique was used to fabricate a biomimetic porous scaffold\nout of a solution of P11-8 and PCL which resulted in a biphasic structure\ncomposed of submicron fibers (diameter of 100-700 nm) and nanofibers (diameter\nof 10-100 nm). The internal morphology of the fabric and its micro-structure\ncan be easily controlled by changing the peptide concentration. The secondary\nconformation of P11-8 was investigated in the as-spun fibers by ATR-FTIR\nspectroscopy and it is shown that peptide self-assembly into \\{b}eta-sheet\ntapes has taken place during fiber formation and the deposition of the fibrous\nweb.\n", "  Consider the discrete equation $$\ny_{n+1}+y_{n-1}=\\frac{a_n+b_ny_n+c_ny_n^2}{1-y_n^2}, $$ where the right side is\nof degree two in $y_n$ and where the coefficients $a_n$, $b_n$ and $c_n$ are\nrational functions of $n$ with rational coefficients. Suppose that there is a\nsolution such that for all sufficiently large $n$, $y_n\\in\\mathbb{Q}$ and the\nheight of $y_n$ dominates the height of the coefficient functions $a_n$, $b_n$\nand $c_n$. We show that if the logarithmic height of $y_n$ grows no faster than\na power of $n$ then either the equation is a well known discrete Painlev\\'e\nequation ${\\rm dP}_{\\!\\rm II}$ or its autonomous version or $y_n$ is also an\nadmissible solution of a discrete Riccati equation. This provides further\nevidence that slow height growth is a good detector of integrability.\n", "  Plasmonic nanoantennas is a hot and rapidly expanding research field. Here we\noverview basic operating principles and applications of novel magneto-plasmonic\nnanoantennas, which are made of ferromagnetic metals and driven not only by\nlight, but also by external magnetic fields. We demonstrate that\nmagneto-plasmonic nanoantennas enhance the magneto-optical effects, which\nintroduces additional degrees of freedom in the control of light at the\nnano-scale. This property is used in conceptually new devices such as\nmagneto-plasmonic rulers, ultra-sensitive biosensors, one-way subwavelength\nwaveguides and extraordinary optical transmission structures, as well as in\nnovel biomedical imaging modalities. We also point out that in certain cases\n'non-optical' ferromagnetic nanostructures may operate as magneto-plasmonic\nnanoantennas. This undesigned extra functionality capitalises on established\noptical characterisation techniques of magnetic nanomaterials and it may be\nuseful for the integration of nanophotonics and nanomagnetism on a single chip.\n", "  The anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations are known to have reductions to many\nintegrable differential equations. A general B\\\"acklund transformation (BT) for\nthe ASDYM equations generated by a Darboux matrix with an affine dependence on\nthe spectral parameter is obtained, together with its Bianchi permutability\nequation. We give examples in which we obtain BTs of symmetry reductions of the\nASDYM equations by reducing this ASDYM BT. Some discrete integrable systems are\nobtained directly from reductions of the ASDYM Bianchi system.\n", "  We address the role of the phase-insensitive trusted preparation and\ndetection noise in the security of a continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution, considering the Gaussian protocols on the basis of coherent and\nsqueezed states and studying them in the conditions of Gaussian lossy and noisy\nchannels. The influence of such a noise on the security of Gaussian quantum\ncryptography can be crucial, even despite the fact that a noise is trusted, due\nto a strongly nonlinear behavior of the quantum entropies involved in the\nsecurity analysis. We recapitulate the known effect of the preparation noise in\nboth direct and reverse-reconciliation protocols, as well as the detection\nnoise in the reverse-reconciliation scenario. As a new result, we show the\nnegative role of the trusted detection noise in the direct-reconciliation\nscheme. We also describe the role of the trusted preparation or detection noise\nadded at the reference side of the protocols in improving the robustness of the\nprotocols to the channel noise, confirming the positive effect for the\ncoherent-state reverse-reconciliation protocol. Finally, we address the\ncombined effect of trusted noise added both in the source and the detector.\n", "  Hot charge carrier extraction from metallic nanostructures is a very\npromising approach for applications in photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and\nphotodetection. One limitation is that many metallic nanostructures support a\nsingle plasmon resonance thus restricting the light-to-charge-carrier activity\nto a spectral band. Here we demonstrate that a monolayer of plasmonic\nnanoparticles can be assembled on a multi-stack layered configuration to\nachieve broad-band, near-unit light absorption, which is spatially localised on\nthe nanoparticle layer. We show that this enhanced light absorbance leads to\n$\\sim$ 40-fold increases in the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency by the\nplasmonic nanostructures. We developed a model that successfully captures the\nessential physics of the plasmonic hot-electron charge generation and\nseparation in these structures. This model also allowed us to establish that\nefficient hot carrier extraction is limited to spectral regions where the\nphotons possessing energies higher than the Schottky junctions and the\nlocalised light absorption of the metal nanoparticles overlap.\n", "  We study the eigenvalues of Schr\\\"odinger operators with complex potentials\nin odd space dimensions. We obtain bounds on the total number of eigenvalues in\nthe case where $V$ decays exponentially at infinity.\n", "  The perfect vortex is a new class of optical vortex beam having ring radius\nindependent of its topological charge (order). One of the simplest techniques\nto generate such beams is the Fourier transformation of the Bessel-Gauss beam.\nThe variation in ring radius of such vortices require Fourier lenses of\ndifferent focal lengths and or complicated imaging setup. Here we report a\nnovel experimental scheme to generate perfect vortex of any ring radius using a\nconvex lens and an axicon. As a proof of principle, using a lens of focal\nlength f=200mm, we have varied the radius of the vortex beam across 0.3-1.18mm\nsimply by adjusting the separation between the lens and axicon. This is also a\nsimple scheme to measure the apex angle of an axicon with ease. Using such\nvortices we have studied non-collinear interaction of photons having orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process\nand observed that the angular spectrum of the SPDC photons are independent of\nOAM of the pump photons rather depends on spatial profile of the pump beam. In\nthe presence of spatial walk-off effect in nonlinear crystals, the SPDC photons\nhave asymmetric angular spectrum with reducing asymmetry at increasing vortex\nradius.\n", "  In planar structures, the vortex resonance frequency changes little as a\nfunction of an in-plane magnetic field as long as the vortex state persists.\nAltering the topography of the element leads to a vastly different dynamic\nresponse that arises due to the local vortex core confinement effect. In this\nwork, we studied the magnetic excitations in non-planar ferromagnetic dots\nusing a broadband microwave spectroscopy technique. Two distinct resonance\nfrequency ranges were observed depending on the position of the vortex core\ncontrollable by applying a relatively small magnetic field. The micromagnetic\nsimulations are in qualitative agreement with the. experimental results.\n", "  We study nonlinear waves on a plane-wave background in an erbium-doped fiber\nsystem, which is governed by the coupled nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger and the\nMaxwell-Bloch equations. We find that prolific different types of nonlinear\nlocalized and periodic waves do exist in the system, including multi-peak\nsoliton, periodic wave, antidark soliton, and W-shaped soliton (as well as the\nknown bright soliton, breather, and rogue wave). In particular, the dynamics of\nthese waves can be extracted from a unified exact solution, and the\ncorresponding existence conditions are presented explicitly. Our results\ndemonstrate the structural diversity of the nonlinear waves in this system.\n", "  The swimming of a sphere by means of radial helical surface waves is studied\non the basis of the Stokes equations. Explicit expressions are derived for the\nmatrices characterizing the mean translational and rotational swimming\nvelocities and the mean rate of dissipation to second order in the wave\namplitude.\n", "  We investigate the robustness of the resonance like feature centred at around\na 750 GeV invariant mass in the 13 TeV diphoton data, recently released by the\nATLAS collaboration. We focus on the choice of empirical function used to model\nthe continuum diphoton background in order to quantify the uncertainties in the\nanalysis due to this choice. We extend the function chosen by the ATLAS\ncollaboration to one with two components. By performing a profile likelihood\nanalysis we find that the local significance of a resonance drops from\n$3.9\\sigma$ using the ATLAS background function, and a freely-varying width, to\nonly $2\\sigma$ with our own function. We argue that the latter significance is\nmore realistic, since the former was derived using a function which is fit\nalmost entirely to the low-energy data, while underfitting in the region around\nthe resonance.\n", "  Explicit dependencies of the local density of states and the magnetization\nlocal density of states have been obtained around magnetic point defects in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction . The\nexpressions are given in the Born approximation for arbitrary magnitude and\norientation of the defect magnetic moment, and for arbitrary size of the\nconstant of spin-orbit interaction alpha/. On the basis of our asymptotically\nexact formulas a procedure for the determination of the constant alpha/ in STM\nexperiments is proposed. The novel analytical results are compared with the\nnumerical and approximate results of previous work. At variance with earlier\nwork we find that that magnetic scattering in the presence of spin-orbit\ninteraction does not modify the local density of states and that the spin\ntexture resulting from in-plain orientation of the defect magnetic moment, and\nelastic scattering, is not a purely in-plane spin texture.\n", "  As the cyber-infrastructure for Astronomical research from Chinese Virtual\nObservatory (China-VO) project, AstroCloud has been archived solid progresses\nduring the last one year. Proposal management system and data access system are\nre-designed. Several new sub-systems are developed, including China-VO\nPaperData, AstroCloud Statics and Public channel. More data sets and\napplication environments are integrated into the platform. LAMOST DR1, the\nlargest astronomical spectrum archive was released to the public using the\nplatform. The latest progresses will be introduced.\n", "  We analyze a system of three two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations coupled by linear terms and with the cubic-quintic\n(focusing-defocusing) nonlinearity. We consider two versions of the model:\nconservative and parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric. These models describe\ntriple-core nonlinear optical waveguides, with balanced gain and losses in the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case. We obtain families of soliton solutions and\ndiscuss their stability. The latter study is performed using a linear stability\nanalysis and checked with direct numerical simulations of the evolutional\nsystem of equations. Stable solitons are found in the conservative and\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric cases. Interactions and collisions between the\nconservative and $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric solitons are briefly investigated, as\nwell.\n", "  The $^{192}$Ir sources are widely used for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy\ntreatments. The aim of this study is to simulate $^{192}$Ir MicroSelectron v2\nHDR brachytherapy source and calculate the air kerma strength, dose rate\nconstant, radial dose function and anisotropy function established in the\nupdated AAPM Task Group 43 protocol. The EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code package\nis used to calculate these dosimetric parameters, including dose contribution\nfrom secondary electron source and also contribution of bremsstrahlung photons\nto air kerma strength. The Air kerma strength, dose rate constant and radial\ndose function while anisotropy functions for the distance greater than 0.5 cm\naway from the source center are in good agreement with previous published\nstudies. Obtained value from MC simulation for air kerma strength is\n$9.762\\times 10^{-8} \\textrm{UBq}^{-1}$and dose rate constant is $1.108\\pm\n0.13\\%\\textrm{cGyh}^{-1} \\textrm{U}^{-1}$.\n", "  The setup cost of a modern solver such as DD-\\alpha AMG (Wuppertal Multigrid)\nis a significant contribution to the total time spent on solving the Dirac\nequation, and in HMC it can even be dominant. We present an improved\nimplementation of this algorithm with modified computation order in the setup\nprocedure. By processing multiple right-hand sides simultaneously we can\nalleviate many of the performance issues of the default single right-hand-side\nsetup. The main improvements are as follows: By combining multiple right-hand\nsides the message size for off-chip communication is larger, which leads to\nbetter utilization of the network bandwidth. Many matrix-vector products are\nreplaced by matrix-matrix products, leading to better cache reuse. The\nsynchronization overhead inflicted by on-chip parallelization (threading),\nwhich is becoming crucial on many-core architectures such as the Intel Xeon\nPhi, is effectively reduced. In the parts implemented so far, we observe a\nspeedup of roughly 3x compared to the optimized version of the single\nright-hand-side setup on realistic lattices.\n", "  Many proper and improper ferroelastic materials display (at sufficiently low\nmeasurement frequencies) a huge elastic softening below Tc. This giant elastic\nsoftening, which can be suppressed with uniaxial stress, is caused by domain\nwall motion. Here we shortly review our results on frequency and temperature\ndependent elastic measurements of some perovskites which exhibit improper\nferroelastic phase transitions. We also present a new model - based on\nLandau-Ginzburg theory including long range interaction of needle shaped\nferroelastic domains - which describes superelastic softening observed in some\nof the perovskite systems very well. We also show, howthe theory can be\nextended to describe proper ferroelastic materials and apply the theory to\ndescribe the elastic behaviour of the proper ferroelastic material\nLa1-xNdxP5O14 (LNPP).\n", "  In this paper we introduce a new dynamical system which we call Angular\nbilliard. It acts on the exterior points of a convex curve in Euclidean plane.\nIn a neighborhood of the boundary curve this system turns out to be dual to the\nBirkhoff billiard. Using this system we get new results on algebraic Birkhoff\nconjecture on integrable billiards.\n", "  We investigate effects of the particle-hole asymmetry on the properties of\nMajorana qubtis. Particle-hole asymmetric pertrubation shifts Majorana zero\nmode from zero-energy. This type of asymmetry can act as a source of\ndecoherence in Majorana qubits. We find that particle-hole asymmetric\npertrubation causes phase-shifts and bit-flips decoherence processes in\nMajorana qubits. However, these sources of decoherence are negligible in\nuniform system with spatially separated Majorana zero modes.\n", "  The unexpected weakness of some faults has been attributed to the emergence\nof acoustic waves that promote failure by reducing the confining pressure\nthrough a mechanism known as acoustic fluidization, also proposed to explain\nearthquake remote triggering. Here we validate this mechanism via the numerical\ninvestigation of a granular fault model system. We find that the stick-slip\ndynamics is affected only by perturbations applied at a characteristic\nfrequency corresponding to oscillations normal to the fault, leading to gradual\ndynamical weakening as failure is approaching. Acoustic waves at the same\nfrequency spontaneously emerge at the onset of failure in absence of\nperturbations, supporting the relevance of acoustic fluidization in earthquake\ntriggering.\n", "  We report on the first spectral and timing characterization of the transient\nX-ray source 1RXS J194211.9+255552 using all available data from the Swift\nX-ray satellite. We used 10 years of hard X-ray data from the Burst Alert\nTelescope (BAT) to characterize its long-term behaviour and to search for long\nperiodicities, finding evidence for a periodic modulation at 166.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 d,\nthat we interpret as the orbital period of the source. The folded light curve\nreveals that the X-ray emission is mostly concentrated in a restricted\nphase-interval and we propose to associate 1RXS J194211.9+255552 to the class\nof the Be X-ray binaries. This is also supported by the results of the spectral\nanalysis, where we used the BAT data and three pointed Swift/XRT observations\nto characterize the X-ray broad-band spectral shape. We found mild spectral\nvariability in soft X-rays that can be accounted for by a varying local neutral\nabsorber, while the intrinsic emission is consistent with a hard power law\nmultiplied by a high-energy exponential cut-off as typically observed in this\nclass of systems.\n", "  State conversion between Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state and W state\nis an open challenging problem because they cannot be converted to each other\nonly by local operations and classical communication. Here we propose a cavity\nquantum electrodynamics method based on interference of polarized photons\nemitted by the atoms trapped in spatially separated optical cavities that can\nconvert a three-atom W state to a GHZ state. We calculate the success\nprobability and fidelity of the converted GHZ state when the cavity decay,\natomic spontaneous decay, and photon leakage of the cavities are taken into\naccount for a practical system, which shows that the proposed scheme is\nfeasible and within the reach of current experimental technology.\n", "  In this paper, we present the realization of an elastic metamaterial allowing\nindependent tuning of negative density and stiffness for elastic waves\npropagating along a designated direction. In electromagnetic (or acoustic)\nmetamaterials, it is now possible to tune permittivity (bulk modulus) and\npermeability (density) independently. Apparently, the tuning methods seem to be\ndirectly applicable for elastic case, but no realization has yet been made due\nto the unique tensorial physics of elasticity that makes wave motions coupled\nin a peculiar way. To realize independent tunability, we developed a\nsingle-phased elastic metamaterial supported by theoretical analysis and\nnumerical/experimental validations.\n", "  We study the long-term spectral and timing behaviour of LS I +61$^{\\circ}$303\nin hard X-rays (15--150 keV) using $\\sim$10 years of survey data from the\n$Swift$ Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) monitor. We focus on the detection of long\nperiodicities known to be present in this source in multiple wavelengths. We\nclearly detect three periods: the shorter one at 26.48 days is compatible with\nthe orbital period of the system; the second, longer, periodicity at 26.93\ndays, is detected for the first time in X-rays and its value is consistent with\nan analogous temporal feature recently detected in the radio and in the\ngamma-ray waveband, and we associate it with a modulation caused by a\nprecessing jet in this system. Finally, we find also evidence of the long-term\nperiodicity at $\\sim$1667 d, that results compatible with a beat frequency of\nthe two close, and shorter, periodicities. We discuss our results in the\ncontext of the multi-band behaviour of the physical processes of this source.\n", "  We have applied the Coulomb and proximity potential model,CPPM to calculate\nthe half lives for various clusters decay of the selected even-even isotopes of\nthe chosen nuclei. These nuclei are Hf, W, Os, Pt, and Hg in the 5d transition\nmetal region in the periodic table with atomic number 72 greater or equal Z\nless than or equal 80. Furthermore, the half-lives are calculated using the\nuniversal formula for cluster decay. The calculated half-lives of alpha decay\nfor the chosen isotopes are in good agreement with the experimental data,\nespecially with the CPPM results. The alpha and cluster decays are more\nprobable from the parents in the heavier mass number A equal 168,180 than from\nthe parents in the lighter mass number A equal 156, 166.\n", "  Along with other frequency selective structures [1] (circles and squares),\ntriangular split-ring resonators (TSRRs) only allow frequencies near the center\nresonant frequency to propagate. Further, TSRRs are attractive due to their\nsmall surface area [2], comparatively, and large quality factors (Q) factors as\npreviously investigated by Gay-Balmaz, et al. [3]. In this work we examine the\neffects of varying the apex angle on the resonant frequency, the Q factor, and\nthe phase shift imparted by the TSRR element within the GHz frequency regime.\n", "  A performance evaluation of superconducting transition-edge sensors (TESs) in\nthe environment of a pion beam line at a particle accelerator is presented.\nAveraged across the 209 functioning sensors in the array, the achieved energy\nresolution is 5.2 eV FWHM at Co $K_{\\alpha}$ (6.9 keV) when the pion beam is\noff and 7.3 eV at a beam rate of 1.45 MHz. Absolute energy uncertainty of\n$\\pm$0.04 eV is demonstrated for Fe $K_{\\alpha}$ (6.4 keV) with in-situ energy\ncalibration obtained from other nearby known x-ray lines. To achieve this small\nuncertainty, it is essential to consider the non-Gaussian energy response of\nthe TESs and thermal cross-talk pile-up effects due to charged-particle hits in\nthe silicon substrate of the TES array.\n", "  Chiral magnetic effect (CME) has been suggested to take place during\nperipheral relativistic heavy ion collisions. However, signals of its\nrealization are not yet independent of ambiguities and thus probing the\nnon-trivial topological vacua of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is still an open\nissue. Weyl materials, particularly graphene, on the other hand, are\neffectively described at low energies by the degrees of freedom of quantum\nelectrodynamics in two spatial dimensions, QED3. This theory shares with QCD\nsome interesting features, like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking and\nalso possesses a non-trivial vacuum structure. In this regard, an analog of the\nCME is proposed to take place in graphene under the influence of an in-plane\nmagnetic field in which the pseudo-spin or flavor label of charge carriers is\nparticipant of the effect, rather than the actual spin. In this contribution,\nwe review the parallelisms and differences between the CME and the so-called\npseudo chiral magnetic effect, PCME.\n", "  Paradigmatic model systems, which are used to study the mechanical response\nof matter, are random networks of point-atoms, random sphere packings, or\nsimple crystal lattices, all of these models assume central-force interactions\nbetween particles/atoms. Each of these models differs in the spatial\narrangement and the correlations among particles. In turn, this is reflected in\nthe widely different behaviours of the shear (G) and compression (K) elastic\nmoduli. The relation between the macroscopic elasticity as encoded in G, K and\ntheir ratio, and the microscopic lattice structure/order, is not understood. We\nprovide a quantitative analytical connection between the local orientational\norder and the elasticity in model amorphous solids with different internal\nmicrostructure, focusing on the two opposite limits of packings (strong\nexcluded-volume) and networks (no excluded-volume). The theory predicts that,\nin packings, the local orientational order due to excluded-volume causes less\nnonaffinity (less softness or larger stiffness) under compression than under\nshear. This leads to lower values of G/K, a well-documented phenomenon which\nwas lacking a microscopic explanation. The theory also provides an excellent\none-parameter description of the elasticity of compressed emulsions in\ncomparison with experimental data over a broad range of packing fractions.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations of thiolate-protected and solvated gold\nnanoparticles were carried out in the presence of a non-equilibrium heat flux\nbetween the solvent and the core of the particle. The interfacial thermal\nconductance ($G$) was computed for these interfaces, and the behavior of the\nthermal conductance was studied as a function of particle size, ligand\nflexibility, and ligand chain length. In all cases, thermal conductance of the\nligand-protected particles was higher than the bare metal-solvent interface. A\nnumber of mechanisms for the enhanced conductance were investigated, including\nthiolate-driven corrugation of the metal surface, solvent ordering at the\ninterface, solvent-ligand interpenetration, and ligand ordering relative to the\nparticle surface. Only the smallest particles exhibited significant\ncorrugation. All ligands permitted substantial solvent-ligand interpenetration,\nand ligand chain length has a significant influence on the orientational\nordering of interfacial solvent. Solvent-ligand vibrational overlap,\nparticularly in the low frequency range ($< 80 \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) was\nsignificantly altered by ligand rigidity, and had direct influence on the\ninterfacial thermal conductance.\n", "  The modularity is a quality function in community detection, which was\nintroduced by Newman and Girvan (2004). Community detection in graphs is now\noften conducted through modularity maximization: given an undirected graph\n$G=(V,E)$, we are asked to find a partition $\\mathcal{C}$ of $V$ that maximizes\nthe modularity. Although numerous algorithms have been developed to date, most\nof them have no theoretical approximation guarantee. Recently, to overcome this\nissue, the design of modularity maximization algorithms with provable\napproximation guarantees has attracted significant attention in the computer\nscience community.\n  In this study, we further investigate the approximability of modularity\nmaximization. More specifically, we propose a polynomial-time\n$\\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi\\right) -\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{8}\\right)$-additive approximation algorithm for the\nmodularity maximization problem. Note here that\n$\\cos\\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi\\right) - \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{8} < 0.42084$\nholds. This improves the current best additive approximation error of $0.4672$,\nwhich was recently provided by Dinh, Li, and Thai (2015). Interestingly, our\nanalysis also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm obtains a nearly-optimal\nsolution for any instance with a very high modularity value. Moreover, we\npropose a polynomial-time $0.16598$-additive approximation algorithm for the\nmaximum modularity cut problem. It should be noted that this is the first\nnon-trivial approximability result for the problem. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat our approximation algorithm can be extended to some related problems.\n", "  After an overview of general aspects of modelling the pulsation- convection\ninteraction we present reasons why such simulations (in multidimensions) are\nneeded but, at the same time, pose a considerable challenge. We then discuss,\nfor several topics, what insights multidimensional simulations have either\nalready provided or can be expected to yield in the future. We finally discuss\nproperties of our ANTARES code. Many of these features can be expected to be\ncharacteristic of other codes which may possibly be applied to these physical\nquestions in the foreseeable future.\n", "  When a given weight dropped onto an explosive charge, explosion or not is\nprobabilistic for certain impact energy and the frequency of explosion is\nalways increase with increasing impact energy. Based on experimental results\nand recently theoretical work, we propose that the hot spot formation is\nattributed to the activated molecules decomposition and the number of molecules\ninitiation is proportional to the impact energy but not the dropped weight\nheating as the previous hot spot theory. A theoretical model based on two\nstates model has been put forward for this phenomena. It is shown that the\nactivated molecules to form a hot spot determine the probabilistic nature of\ninitiation by impact. It is shown a good agreement tested with Hexogen (RDX)\nexperimental impact data.\n", "  We present a renormalization-group analysis of the $X(3872)$ radiative decays\ninto $J/ \\psi \\gamma$ and $\\psi(2S) \\gamma$. We assume a $D\\bar{D}^{*}$\nmolecule for the $X$ long-distance structure and parametrize its short-distance\nphysics as contact interactions. Using effective field theory techniques and\npower-divergence subtraction scheme, we find that short- and long-distance\nphysics are equally important in these decays. Our calculations set a lower\nlimit to the corresponding decay widths, which can in principle be tested\nexperimentally. Our results may be used as guide to build models for the $X$\nshort-distance.\n", "  A dynamical characterization of dark matter dominated dwarf galaxies from\ntheir observed effects on galactic disks (i.e. Galactoseismology) has remained\nan elusive goal. Here, we present preliminary results from spectroscopic\nobservations of three clustered Cepheid candidates identified from $K$-band\nlight curves towards Norma. The average heliocentric radial velocity of these\nstars is $\\sim$ 156 km/s, which is large and distinct from that of the Galaxy's\nstellar disk. These objects at $l \\sim 333 ^\\circ$ and $b \\sim -1 ^\\circ$ are\ntherefore halo stars; using the $3.6~\\micron$ period-luminosity relation of\nType I Cepheids, they are at $\\sim$ 73 kpc. Our ongoing $I$-band photometry\nindicates variability on the same time scale as the period determined from the\n$K_{s}$-band light curve. Distances determined from the $K$-band\nperiod-luminosity relation and the 3.6 $\\micron$ period-luminosity relation are\ncomparable. The observed radial velocity of these stars agrees roughly with\npredictions from dynamical models. If these stars are indeed members of the\npredicted dwarf galaxy that perturbed the outer HI disk of the Milky Way, this\nwould mark the first application of Galactoseismology.\n", "  We present the first results from a major Hubble Space Telescope program\ndesigned to investigate the cosmological evolution of quasar host galaxies from\nz~2 to the present day. Here we describe J and H-band NICMOS imaging of two\nquasar samples at redshifts of 0.9 and 1.9 respectively. Each sample contains\nequal numbers of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, selected to lie within the\nsame narrow range of optical absolute magnitude (-24 > M_V > -25). Filter and\ntarget selection were designed to ensure that at each redshift the images\nsample the same part of the object's rest-frame spectrum, avoiding potential\ncontamination by [OIII]lambda5007 and H-alpha emission lines. At z=1 the hosts\nof both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars lie on the same Kormendy relation\ndescribed by 3CR radio galaxies at comparable redshift. There is some evidence\nfor a gap of ~1 mag between the host luminosities of RLQs and RQQs, a\ndifference that cannot be due to emission-line contamination given the design\nof our study. However, within current uncertainties, simple passive stellar\nevolution is sufficient to link these galaxies with the elliptical hosts of\nlow-redshift quasars of comparable nuclear output, implying that the hosts are\nvirtually fully assembled by z=1. At z=2 the luminosity gap appears to have\nwidened further to ~1.5 mag. Thus while the hosts of radio-loud quasars remain\nconsistent with a formation epoch of z>3, allowing for passive evolution\nimplies that the hosts of radio-quiet quasars are ~2-4 times less massive at\nz=2 than at low z.\n", "  Analyses of halo shapes for disc galaxies are said to give incongruous\nresults. I point out that the modified dynamics (MOND) predicts for disc\ngalaxies a distribution of fictitious dark matter that comprises two\ncomponents: a pure disc and a rounder halo. The former dominates the true disc\nin regions of small accelerations, where it controls the z-dynamics in the disc\n(disc flaring etc.); it has a finite total mass. It also dominates the round\ncomponent near the centre where the geometry is nearly planar. The second\ncomponent controls motions far from the plane, has a total enclosed mass that\ndiverges linearly with radius, and determines the rotation curve at large\nradii. Its ellipticity may be appreciable at small radii but vanishes\nasymptotically. This prediction of MOND differs from what one expects from\ngalaxy-formation scenarios with dark matter.\n  Analyses to date, which, as they do, assume one component--usually with a\nconstant ellipticity, perforce give conflicting results for the best-value\nellipticity, depending on whether they probe the disc or the sphere, small\nradii or large ones.\n", "  Recent measurements of the K-band luminosity function now provide us with\nstrong, reliable constraints on the fraction of baryons which have cooled.\nGlobally, this fraction is only about 5%, and there is no strong evidence that\nit is significantly higher in clusters. Without an effective sub-grid feedback\nprescription, the cooled gas fraction in any numerical simulation exceeds these\nobservational constraints, and increases with increasing resolution. This\ncompromises any discussion of galaxy and cluster properties based on results of\nsimulations which include cooling but do not implement an effective feedback\nmechanism.\n", "  We present upper limits on the 850 micron and 450 micron fluxes of the warm\nhyperluminous (bolometric luminosity L_bol > 10^13 L_sun galaxies IRAS\nP09104+4109 (z=0.442) and IRAS F15307+3252 (z=0.926), derived from measurements\nusing the SCUBA bolometer array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Hot\nluminous infrared sources like these are thought to differ from more normal\ncold ultraluminous infrared (L_bol > 10^12 L_sun) galaxies in that they derive\nmost of their bolometric luminosities from dusty AGNs as opposed to starbursts.\nSuch hot, dusty AGNs at high redshift are thought to be responsible for much of\nthe mass accretion of the Universe that is in turn responsible for the\nformation of the supermassive black holes seen in the centres of local\ngalaxies. The galaxy IRAS P09104+4109 is also unusual in that it is a cD galaxy\nin the center of a substantial cooling-flow cluster, not an isolated\ninteracting galaxy like most ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Previously it was\nknown to have large amounts of hot (T > 50 K) dust from IRAS observations. We\nnow show that the contribution of cold dust to the bolometric luminosity is\nless than 3 per cent. Most ultraluminous infrared galaxies possess large\namounts of cold dust, and it is now known that some cooling flow cluster cD\ngalaxies do as well. Yet this object, which is an extreme example of both, does\nnot have enough cold gas to contribute significantly to the bolometric\nluminosity. We outline physical reasons why this could have happened. We then\nprovide a discussion of stategies for finding hot dusty AGNs, given the\nlimitations on submillimetre surveys implied by this work.\n", "  We explore possibilities of collapse and star formation in Population III\nobjects exposed to the external ultraviolet background (UVB) radiation.\nAssuming spherical symmetry, we solve self-consistently radiative transfer of\nphotons, non-equilibrium H2 chemistry, and gas hydrodynamics. Although the UVB\ndoes suppress the formation of low mass objects, the negative feedback turns\nout to be weaker than previously suggested. In particular, the cut-off scale of\ncollapse drops significantly below the virial temperature 10^4 K at weak UV\nintensities, due to both self-shielding of the gas and H2 cooling. Clouds above\nthis cut-off tend to contract highly dynamically, further promoting\nself-shielding and H2 formation. For plausible radiation intensities and\nspectra, the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well below\n10^4 K before rotationally supported and the final H2 fraction reaches 10^{-3}.\nOur results imply that star formation can take place in low mass objects\ncollapsing in the UVB. The threshold baryon mass for star formation is \\sim\n10^9 solar mass for clouds collapsing at redshifts z \\simlt 3, but drops\nsignificantly at higher redshifts. In a conventional cold dark matter universe,\nthe latter coincides roughly with that of the 1 \\sigma density fluctuations.\nObjects near and above this threshold can thus constitute `building blocks' of\nluminous structures, and we discuss their links to dwarf spheroidal/elliptical\ngalaxies and faint blue objects. These results suggest that the UVB can play a\nkey role in regulating the star formation history of the Universe.\n", "  A major recent evelopment in observational cosmology has been an accurate\nmeasurement of the luminosity distance-redshift relation out to redshifts z=0.8\nfrom Type Ia supernova standard candles. The results have been argued as\nevidence for cosmic acceleration. It is well known that this assertion depends\non the assumption that we know the equation of state for all mass-energy other\nthan normal pressureless matter; popular models are based on either the\ncosmological constant or on the more general quintessence formulation. But this\nassertion also depends on a number of other assumptions, implicit in the\nderivation of the standard cosmological field equations: large-scale isotropy\nand homogeneity, the flatness of the Universe, and the validity of general\nrelativity on cosmological scales (where it has not been tested). A detailed\nexamination of the effects of these assumptions on the interplay between the\nluminosity distance-redshift relation and the acceleration of the Universe is\nnot possible unless one can define the precise nature of the failure of any\nparticular assumption. However a simple quantitative investigation is possible\nand reveals a number of considerations about the relative importance of the\ndifferent assumptions. In this paper we present such an investigation. We find\nthat the relationship between the distant-redshift relation and the sign of the\ndeceleration parameter is fairly robust and is unaffected if only one of the\nassumptions that we investigate is invalid so long as the deceleration\nparameter is not close to zero (it would not be close to zero in the\ncurrently-favored Omega_Lambda = 1 - Omega_matter = 0.7 or 0.8 Universe, for\nexample). Failures of two or more assumptions in concordance may have stronger\neffects.\n", "  We present spectroscopy and orbital periods Porb of four relatively\nlittle-studied cataclysmic variable stars. The stars and their periods are: AF\nCam, Porb = 0.324(1) d (the daily cycle count is slightly ambiguous); V2069 Cyg\n(= RX J2123.7+4217), 0.311683(2) d; PG 0935+075, 0.1868(3) d; and KUV\n03580+0614, 0.1495(6) d. V2069 Cyg and KUV 03580+0614 both show HeII lambda\n4686 emission comparable in strength to H beta. V2069 Cyg appears to be a\nluminous novalike variable, and the strong HeII suggests it may be an\nintermediate polar. The period of KUV 03580+0614 is similar to members of the\nSW Sex-type novalike variables, and it shows the phase-dependent absorption in\nthe Balmer and He I lines typical of this subclass. AF Cam shows absorption\nfeatures from a K-type secondary, as expected given its rather long orbital\nperiod. The secondary spectrum and the outburst magnitude both suggest that AF\nCam is about 1 kpc distant. The spectrum of PG 0935+075 resembles that of a\ndwarf nova at minimum light, with a noticeable contribution from an M-dwarf\nsecondary star. The secondary spectrum and a tentative outburst magnitude both\nsuggest a distance near 500 pc.\n", "  Our Chandra observation of the FRI radio galaxy 3C66B has resulted in the\nfirst detection of an X-ray counterpart to the previously known radio,\ninfra-red and optical jet. The X-ray jet is detected up to 7 arcsec from the\ncore and has a steep X-ray spectrum, alpha ~ 1.3 +/- 0.1. The overall X-ray\nflux density and spectrum of the jet are consistent with a synchrotron origin\nfor the X-ray emission. However, the inner knot in the jet has a higher ratio\nof X-ray to radio emission than the others. This suggests that either two\ndistinct emission processes are present or that differences in the acceleration\nmechanism are required; there may be a contribution to the inner knot's\nemission from an inverse-Compton process or it may be the site of an early\nstrong shock in the jet. The peak of the brightest radio and X-ray knot is\nsignificantly closer to the nucleus in the X-ray than in the radio, which may\nsuggest that the knots are privileged sites for high-energy particle\nacceleration. 3C66B's jet is similar both in overall spectral shape and in\nstructural detail to those in more nearby sources such as M87 and Centaurus A.\n", "  Accreting black holes show a complex and diverse behaviour in their soft\nspectral states. Although these spectra are dominated by a soft, thermal\ncomponent which almost certainly arises from an accretion disc, there is also a\nhard X-ray tail indicating that some fraction of the accretion power is instead\ndissipated in hot, optically thin coronal material. During such states, best\nobserved in the early outburst of Soft X-ray Transients, the ratio of power\ndissipated in the hot corona to that in the disc can vary from ~0 (pure disc\naccretion) to ~1 (equal power in each). Here we present results of spectral\nanalyses of a number of sources, demonstrating the presence of complex features\nin their energy spectra. Our main findings are: (1) the soft components are not\nproperly described by a thermal emission from accretion discs: they are\nappreciably broader than can be described by disc blackbody models even\nincluding relativistic effects, and (2) the spectral features near 5-9 keV\ncommonly seen in such spectra can be well described by reprocessing of hard\nX-rays by optically thick, highly ionized, relativistically moving plasma.\n", "  (Abridged) This is the second in a series of three papers which present and\ninterpret basic observational data on the 6C* 151-MHz radio sample: a\nlow-frequency selected sample which exploits filtering criteria based on radio\nproperties (steep spectral index and small angular size) to find radio sources\nat redshift z > 4 within a 0.133sr patch of sky. We present results of a\nprogramme of optical spectroscopy which has yielded redshifts in the range 0.5\n< z < 4.4 for the 29 sources in the sample, all but six of which are secure. We\nfind that the fil tering criteria used for 6C* are very effective in excluding\nthe low-redshift, low-luminosity radio sources: the median redshift of 6C* is\nz~1.9 compared to z~1.1 for a complete sample matched in 151-MHz flux density.\nBy combining the emission-line dataset for the 6C* radio sources with those for\nthe 3CRR, 6CE and 7CRS samples we establish that z > 1.75 radio galaxies follow\na rough proportionality between Lyalpha- and 151 MHz-luminosity which, like\nsimilar correlations seen in samples of lower-redshift radio sources, are\nindicative of a primary link between the power in the source of the\nphotoionising photons (most likely a hidden quasar nucleus) and the power\ncarried by the radio jets. We argue that radio sources modify their\nenvironments and that the range of emission-line properties seen is determined\nmore by the range of source age than by the range in ambient environment. This\nis in accord with the idea that all high-redshift, high-luminosity radio\nsources are triggered in similar environments, presumably recently collapsed\nmassive structures.\n", "  In this paper, the third and final of a series, we present complete K-band\nimaging and some complementary I-band imaging of the filtered 6C* sample. We\nfind no systematic differences between the K-z relation of 6C* radio galaxies\nand those from complete samples, so the near-infrared properties of luminous\nradio galaxies are not obviously biased by the additional 6C* radio selection\ncriteria (steep spectral index and small angular size). The 6C* K-z data\nsignificantly improve delineation of the K-z relation for radio galaxies at\nhigh-redshift (z >2). Accounting for non-stellar contamination, and for\ncorrelations between radio luminosity and stellar mass, we find little support\nfor previous claims that the underlying scatter in the stellar luminosity of\nradio galaxies increases significantly at z >2. In a particular spatially-flat\nuniverse with a cosmological constant, the most luminous radio sources appear\nto be associated with galaxies with a luminosity distribution with a high mean\n(~5 Lstar), and a low dispersion (sigma ~ 0.5 mag) which formed their stars at\nepochs corresponding to z >~2.5. This result is in line with recent sub-mm\nstudies of high-redshift radio galaxies and the inferred ages of extremely red\nobjects from faint radio samples.\n", "  The analyses of X-ray emission from classical novae during the outburst stage\nhave shown that the soft X-ray emission below 1 keV, which is thought to\noriginate from the photosphere of the white dwarf, is inconsistent with the\nsimple blackbody model of emission. Thus, $ROSAT$ Position Sensitive\nProportional Counter (PSPC) archival data of the classical novae GQ Mus 1983\n(GQ Mus) have been reanalyzed in order to understand the spectral development\nin the X-ray wavelengths during the outburst stage. The X-ray spectra are\nfitted with the hot white dwarf atmosphere emission models developed for the\nremnants of classical novae near the Eddington luminosity. The post-outburst\nX-ray spectra of the remnant white dwarf is examined in the context of\nevolution on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using C-O enhanced atmosphere\nmodels. The data obtained in 1991 August (during the ROSAT All Sky Survey)\nindicate that the effective temperature is kT_e<54 eV (<6.2x10^5 K). The 1992\nFebruary data show that the white dwarf had reached an effective temperature in\nthe range 38.3-43.3 eV (4.4-5.1x10^5 K) with an unabsorbed X-ray flux (i.e.,\n$\\sim$ bolometric flux) between 2.5x10^-9 and 2.3x10^-10 erg s^-1 cm^-2. We\nshow that the H burning at the surface of the WD had most likely ceased at the\ntime of the X-ray observations. Only the 1991 August data show evidence for\nongoing H burning.\n", "  I propose that broad narrow-topped emission lines with full width at zero\nintensity >20000 km/s, seen in early-time spectra of SN 1998S, originate from a\ndense circumstellar gas and not from the supernova ejecta. The tremendous line\nwidth is the result of multiple scattering of the narrow line radiation on\nthermal electrons of the circumstellar shell with the Thomson optical depth of\nabout 4 on 1998 March 6.\n", "  We present HST WFPC2 V band imaging for 23 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies\ntaken from the QDOT redshift survey. The fraction of sources observed to be\ninteracting is 87%. Most of the merging systems show a number of compact\n`knots', whose colour and brightness differ substantially from their immediate\nsurroundings. Colour maps for nine of the objects show a non-uniform colour\nstructure. Features include blue regions located towards the centres of merging\nsystems which are likely to be areas of enhanced star formation, and compact\nred regions which are likely to be dust shrouded starbursts or AGN. The host\ngalaxies of the QSOs in the sample were found to be either interacting systems\nor ellipticals. Our data shows no evidence that ULIRGs are a simple transition\nstage between galaxy mergers and QSOs. We propose an alternative model for\nULIRGs based on the morphologies in our sample and previous N-body simulations.\nUnder this model ULIRGs as a class are much more diverse than a simple\ntransition between galaxy merger and QSO. The evolution of IR power source and\nmerger morphology in ULIRGs is driven solely by the local environment and the\nmorphologies of the merger progenitors.\n", "  We present a new photometric catalogue of the Coma galaxy cluster in the\nJohnson U- and V- bands. We cover an area of 3360arcmin2 of sky, to a depth of\nV=20 mag in a 13 arcsec diameter aperture, and produce magnitudes for ~1400\nextended objects in metric apertures from 8.8 to 26arcsec diameters. The mean\ninternal RMS scatter in the photometry is 0.014 mag in V, and 0.026 mag in U,\nfor V13 < 17 mag.\n  We place new limits on the levels of scatter in the colour--magnitude\nrelation (CMR) in the Coma cluster, and investigate how the slope and scatter\nof the CMR depends on galaxy morphology, luminosity and position within the\ncluster. As expected, the lowest levels of scatter are found in the elliptical\ngalaxies, while the late type galaxies have the highest numbers of galaxies\nbluewards of the CMR. We investigate whether the slope of the CMR is an\nartifact of colour gradients within galaxies and, show that it persists when\nthe colours are measured within a diameter that scales with galaxy size.\nLooking at the environmental dependence of the CMR, we find a trend of\nsystematically bluer galaxy colours with increasing projected cluster-centric\nradius which we associate with a gradient in the mean galactic ages.\n", "  We use a numerical simulation to investigate the effectiveness of pinhole\nspatial filters at optical/IR interferometers and to compare them with\nsingle-mode optical fibre spatial filters and interferometers without spatial\nfilters. We show that fringe visibility measurements in interferometers\ncontaining spatial filters are much less affected by changing seeing conditions\nthan equivalent measurements without spatial filters. This reduces visibility\ncalibration uncertainties, and hence can reduce the need for frequent\nobservations of separate astronomical sources for calibration of visibility\nmeasurements. We also show that spatial filters can increase the\nsignal-to-noise ratios of visibility measurements and that pinhole filters give\nsignal-to-noise ratios within 17% of values obtained with single-mode fibres\nfor aperture diameters up to 3r_0. Given the simplicity of the use of pinhole\nfilters we suggest that it represents a competitive, if not optimal, technique\nfor spatial filtering in many current and next generation interferometers.\n", "  By means of N-body simulations we study the global dynamics of triplets of\ngalaxies, considering initial conditions starting from `maximum expansion' and\nin virial equilibrium. Unlike previous studies we treat galaxies\nself-consistently. We do not consider the influence of a primordial common halo\nof dark matter. Our results indicate that a low number of triple mergers are\nexpected at the present epoch (~10%) for collapsing triplets. Initially\nvirialised conditions yield ~5% of triple mergers in ~10 Gyr of evolution;\nhence, the 3-galaxy problem has stable states. No overmerging problem for these\nsmall groups of galaxies is found. Their geometrical properties, as reflected\nby the Agekyan-Anosova map, do not show an excess of extreme hierarchical\ntriplets. The median velocity dispersion of observed compact triplets (~100\nkm/s) is not well reproduced in our models at the present epoch. However, about\n10% of simulated triplets starting from maximum expansion have dynamical\nproperties very similar to them. Our median values agree, however, very well\nwith new data on triples. We find that the median mass estimators performs\nsomewhat better than the virial mass estimate. The VME underestimates mass by\n\\~35%. We conclude that Karachentsev's compact triplets probably represent the\nmost advanced stage of gravitational clustering of initially diffuse triplets.\n", "  In this, the first in a series of three papers concerning the SuperCOSMOS Sky\nSurvey (SSS), we give an introduction and user guide to the survey programme.\nWe briefly describe other wide-field surveys and compare with our own. We give\nexamples of the data, and make a comparison of the accuracies of the various\nimage parameters available with those from the other surveys providing similar\ndata; we show that the SSS database and interface offer advantages over these\nsurveys. Some science applications of the data are also described and some\nlimitations discussed. The series of three papers constitutes a comprehensive\ndescription and user guide for the SSS.\n", "  In this, the second in a series of three papers concerning the SuperCOSMOS\nSky Survey, we describe the methods for image detection, parameterisation,\nclassification and photometry. We demonstrate the internal and external\naccuracy of our object parameters. Using examples from the first release of\ndata, the South Galactic Cap survey, we show that our image detection\ncompleteness is close to 100% to within 1.5 mag of the nominal plate limits. We\nshow that for the Bj survey data, the image classification is externally > 99%\nreliable to Bj = 19.5. Internally, the image classification is reliable at a\nlevel of > 90% to Bj=21, R=19. The photometric accuracy of our data is\ntypically 0.3 mag with respect to external data for m > 15. Internally, the\nrelative photometric accuracy in restricted position and magnitude ranges can\nbe as accurate as 5% for well exposed stellar images. Colours (B-R or R-I) are\nexternally accurate to 0.07 mag at Bj = 16.5 rising to 0.16 mag at Bj = 20.\n", "  In this, the third in a series of three papers concerning the SuperCOSMOS Sky\nSurvey, we describe the astrometric properties of the database. We describe the\nalgorithms employed in the derivation of the astrometric parameters of the\ndata, and demonstrate their accuracies by comparison with external datasets\nusing the first release of data, the South Galactic Cap survey. We show that\nthe celestial coordinates, which are tied to the International Celestial\nReference Frame via the Tycho-2 reference catalogue, are accurate to better\nthan +/- 0.2 arcsec at J,R=19,18 rising to +/- 0.3 arcsec at J,R=22,21 with\npositional dependent systematic effects from bright to faint magnitudes at the\n+/- 0.1 arcsec level. The proper motion measurements are shown to be accurate\nto typically +/- 10 mas/yr at J,R=19,18 rising to +/- 50 mas/yr at J,R=22,21\nand are tied to zero using the extragalactic reference frame. We show that the\nzeropoint errors in the proper motions are < 1 mas/yr for R > 17 and are no\nlarger than 10 mas/yr for R < 17 mas/yr.\n", "  The formation and collapse of a protostar involves the simultaneous infall\nand outflow of material in the presence of magnetic fields, self-gravity, and\nrotation. We use self-similar techniques to self-consistently model the\nanisotropic collapse and outflow by a set of angle-separated self-similar\nequations. The outflow is quite strong in our model, with the velocity\nincreasing in proportion to radius, and material formally escaping to infinity\nin the finite time required for the central singularity to develop.\n  Analytically tractable collapse models have been limited mainly to\nspherically symmetric collapse, with neither magnetic field nor rotation. Other\nanalyses usually employ extensive numerical simulations, or either perturbative\nor quasistatic techniques. Our model is unique as an exact solution to the\nnon-stationary equations of self-gravitating MHD, which features co-existing\nregions of infall and outflow.\n  The velocity and magnetic topology of our model is quadrupolar, although\ndipolar solutions may also exist. We provide a qualitative model for the origin\nand subsequent evolution of such a state. However, a central singularity forms\nat late times, and we expect the late time behaviour to be dominated by the\nsingularity rather than to depend on the details of its initial state. Our\nsolution may, therefore, have the character of an attractor among a much more\ngeneral class of self-similarity.\n", "  This paper presents a new complete and well defined sample of Flat Spectrum\nRadio Sources (FSRS) selected from the CLASS survey with the further constraint\nof a bright (mag<17.5) optical counterpart. The sample has been designed to\nproduce a large number of low-luminosity blazars in order to test the current\nunifying models in the low luminosity regime. In this first paper the new\nsample is presented and the radio properties of the 325 sources contained\ntherein discussed.\n", "  In the previous paper of this series Deshpande & Rankin (2001) reported\nresults regarding subpulse-drift phenomenon in pulsar B0943+10 at 430 MHz and\n111 MHz. This study has led to the identification of a stable system of\nsubbeams circulating around the magnetic axis of this star. Here, we present a\nsingle-pulse analysis of our observations of this pulsar at 35 MHz. The\nfluctuation properties seen at this low frequency, as well as our independent\nestimates of the number of subbeams required and their circulation time, agree\nremarkably well with the reported behavior at higher frequencies. We use the\n`cartographic'-transform mapping technique developed in Paper-I to study the\nemission pattern in the polar region of this pulsar. The significance of our\nresults in the context of radio emission mechanisms is also discussed.\n", "  We present strong evidence for variability of the flux of the iron K$\\alpha$\nemission line in the Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 3516. Two ASCA observations,\nseparated by $\\sim 1$~yr, showed a marked decrease in continuum flux by $\\sim\n60$~per cent. The flux in the broad, iron K$\\alpha$ line decreased by the same\nfactor in this time period, with no evidence for changes in the line profile.\nThe line variability is significant at $>99$~per cent confidence and rules out\nmodels in which the line is produced in a molecular torus located at $>1$~pc\nfrom the nucleus. An accretion disk is considerably more likely.\n", "  We show that the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF) of the inner\nhalo of the Milky Way is statistically different from the GCLF of the outer\nhalo. We also find a similar difference between the inner and outer halo\npopulation of M31. We assert that this difference is evidence for some form of\ndynamical evolution of the cluster population and/or a dependence of GCLF shape\non the environment in which the cluster population formed. We also find that\nthe turnover luminosity of the GCLF is unaffected by these differences and\nfurther assert that this stability of the turnover luminosity affirms its\nusefulness as an indicator of cosmic distance.\n", "  We have identified ten candidate intergalactic planetary nebulae in the\nFornax galaxy cluster. These objects were found during observations in 1992 and\n1993 in three fields chosen well away from any Fornax galaxy at 15 arcmin, 30\narcmin, and 45 arcmin from the centre of Fornax. We used the usual method of\nblinking images taken in a narrow OIII filter, with images taken in an adjacent\nbroad filter. The measured fluxes in the narrow, broad, and I bands are\nconsistent with these unresolved objects being planetary nebulae immersed in an\nintergalactic population of stars. Such a population is expected to arise as a\nconsequence of tidal encounters between galaxies, and our findings strengthen\nthe case for the existence of such tidal debris. The confirmation of some or\nall of these ten candidates as planetary nebulae would imply that intergalactic\nstars constitute a substantial fraction of all the stars in Fornax, up to an\nestimated 40 per cent. Intergalactic planetary nebulae could prove useful in\nprobing the underlying cluster potential, since they would be far more abundant\nthan galaxies. We discuss possible contamination of the sample by emission-line\ngalaxies, but conclude that planetary nebulae is the most likely identification\nfor the detected objects. keywords: intergalactic medium-- galaxies:\ninteractions -- planetary nebulae: general -- clusters: individual: Fornax\n", "  In this paper we investigate the relation between the detailed isophotal\nshape of elliptical galaxies and the strength of the H beta absorption in their\nspectra. We find that disky galaxies have higher H beta indices. Stellar\npopulation synthesis models show that the H beta line is a good age indicator,\nhence disky galaxies tend to have younger mean ages than boxy galaxies. We show\nthat the observed trend can be brought about by a contaminating young\npopulation, which we associate with the disky component. This population need\nonly account for a small fraction of the total mass, for example if a\ncontaminating population of age of 2 Gyrs is superimposed on an old (12 Gyr)\nelliptical galaxy, then the observed trend can be explained if it contributes\nonly 10% to the total mass. The size of this effect is consistent with the\nestimates of disk-to-total light ratios from surface photometry.\n", "  Presented are measurements of the observed redshift-space galaxy-galaxy\nautocorrelation function, xi(s), for the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS).\nFor separations 2.0/h Mpc < s < 16.4/h Mpc, xi(s) can be approximated by a\npower law with slope of -1.52 +/- 0.03 and a correlation length of s_0 = (6.28\n+\\- 0.27)/h Mpc. A zero-crossing occurs on scales of roughly 30 - 40/h Mpc. On\nlarger scales, xi(s) fluctuates closely about zero, indicating a high level of\nuniformity in the galaxy distribution on these scales. In addition, two aspects\nof the LCRS selection criteria - a variable field-to-field galaxy sampling rate\nand a 55 arcsec galaxy pair separation limit - are tested and found to have\nlittle impact on the measurement of xi(s). Finally, the LCRS xi(s) is compared\nwith those from numerical simulations; it is concluded that, although the LCRS\nxi(s) does not discriminate sharply among modern cosmological models,\nredshift-space distortions in the LCRS xi(s) will likely provide a strong test\nof theory.\n", "  We present the evidence for X-ray variability from the core and from knot A\nin the M87 jet based on data from two observations with the Einstein\nObservatory High Resolution Imager (HRI) and three observations with the ROSAT\nHRI. The core intensity showed a 16% increase in 17 months ('79-'80); a 12%\nincrease in the 3 years '92 to '95; and a 17% drop in the last half of 1995.\nThe intensity of knot A appears to have decreased by 16% between 92Jun and\n95Dec. Although the core variability is consistent with general expectations\nfor AGN nuclei, the changes in knot A provide constraints on the x-ray emission\nprocess and geometry. Thus we predict that the x-ray morphology of knot A will\ndiffer significantly from the radio and optical structure.\n", "  The basic equations describing a Newtonian universe with uniform pressure are\nreexamined. We argue that in the semi-classical formulation adopted in the\nliterature the continuity equation has a misleading pressure gradient term.\nWhen this term is removed, the resulting equations give the same homogeneous\nbackground solutions with pressure and the same evolution equation for the\ndensity contrast as are obtained using the full relativistic approach.\n", "  We have fitted the surface brightness of a sample of 79 elliptical galaxies\npertaining to the Coma cluster of galaxies using the Sersic profile. This model\nis defined through three primary parameters: scale length (a), intensity\n(\\Sigma_0), and a shape parameter (\\nu); physical and astrophysical quantities\nmay be computed from these parameters. We show that correlations are stronger\namong primary parameters than the classical astrophysical ones. In particular,\nthe galaxies follow a high correlation in \\nu and a parameters. We show that\nthe \\nu and a correlation satisfies a constant specific entropy condition. We\npropose to use this entropy relation as distance indicator for clusters.\n", "  If at cosmological distances, a small fraction of gamma-ray bursts should be\nmultiply imaged by intervening galaxies or clusters, resulting in the\nappearance of two very similar bursts from the same location with a relative\ntime delay of hours to a year. We show that microlensing by individual stars in\nthe lensing galaxy can smear out the light curves of the multiply imaged bursts\non millisecond time scales. Therefore, in deciding whether two bursts are\nsimilar enough to qualify as multiple images, one must look at time scales\nlonger than a few tens of milliseconds, since shorter time scales are possibly\nrendered dissimilar by microlensing.\n", "  The globular clusters of the LMC are found to be significantly more\nelliptical than Galactic globular clusters, but very similar in virtually all\nother respects. The ellipticity of the LMC globular clusters is shown not be\ncorrelated with the age or mass of those clusters. It is proposed that the\nellipticity differences are caused by the different strengths of the tidal\nfields in the LMC and the Galaxy. The strong Galactic tidal field erases\ninitial velocity anisotropies and removes angular momentum from globular\nclusters making them more spherical. The tidal field of the LMC is not strong\nenough to perform these tasks and its globular clusters remain close to their\ninitial states.\n", "  Accurate measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies\nwith an angular resolution of a few arcminutes can be used to determine\nfundamental cosmological parameters such as the densities of baryons, cold and\nhot dark matter, and certain combinations of the cosmological constant and the\ncurvature of the Universe to percent-level precision. Assuming the true theory\nis a variant of inflationary cold dark matter cosmologies, we calculate the\naccuracy with which cosmological parameters can be determined by the next\ngeneration of CMB satellites, MAP and Planck. We pay special attention to: (a)\nthe accuracy of the computed derivatives of the CMB power spectrum C_L; (b) the\nnumber and choices of parameters; (c) the inclusion of prior knowledge of the\nvalues of various parameters.\n", "  It has been suggested that the final stages of accretion in present--day\ngiant elliptical galaxies occur in an advection-dominated mode. The poor\nradiative efficiency of this accretion solution accounts for the fact that\nmassive black holes, which are believed to reside in the centres of these\ngalaxies, do not have the luminosities expected if accretion from the hot\ninterstellar medium occurs at the Bondi rate. We discuss the\nadvection-dominated solution for the nucleus of M60 (NGC 4649) and show that\naccretion at the Bondi rate is consistent with the core flux from radio to\nX-ray. This solution allows for a black hole mass of ~ 10^9 solar masses as\nrequired by independent arguments. The successful application of this model to\nboth M60, and previously to the well known nucleus of M87, suggests that\naccretion of hot gas in an elliptical galaxy creates the ideal circumstances\nfor advection-dominated accretion flows to operate.\n", "  The soft (\\approx 0.1--2.0 keV) X-ray spectra of narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies are known to be generally steeper than those of Seyfert 1 galaxies\nwith broader optical permitted lines. This has been attributed to the presence\nof strong soft X-ray excesses, over the hard X-ray power law, in many\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1s. Here we use the currently available ASCA data to\nsystematically compare the harder (\\approx 2--10 keV) X-ray continua of soft\nROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s with those of Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM.\nOur robust and nonparametric testing suggests, with high statistical\nsignificance, that soft ROSAT narrow-line Seyfert 1s have generally steeper\nintrinsic hard X-ray continua than Seyfert 1s with larger H-beta FWHM. The hard\nphoton index trend appears similar to the previously known soft photon index\ntrend, although with a reduced photon index spread. If the soft X-ray excesses\nof all Seyfert 1s are confined to below \\approx 1 keV they cannot directly\naffect the \\approx 2--10 keV spectra studied here. However, as suggested for\nthe extreme narrow-line Seyfert 1 RE J 1034+393, a strong soft X-ray excess may\naffect the accretion disc corona which creates the underlying hard X-ray power\nlaw. If this is occurring, then more detailed study of this physical process\ncould give clues about the formation of the underlying continua of all\nSeyferts. Other effects, such as intrinsic 2--10 keV continuum curvature, could\nalso lead to the observed photon index trend and need further study.\n", "  We present observations made with the VLA at 1.5 and 8.4 GHz of the nearby\nFRI radio galaxy 3C296. The most recent models of FRI radio galaxies suggest\nthat substantial deceleration must take place in their jets, with strongly\nrelativistic velocities on parsec scales giving place to at most mildly\nrelativistic velocities on scales of tens of kiloparsecs. The region over which\nthis deceleration takes place is therefore of considerable interest. By\nconsidering the side-to-side asymmetries of the jets of 3C296, we constrain the\nregion of strong deceleration in the source. Our observations show evidence\nthat the jets have slow edges surrounding faster central spines. We discuss the\nimplications of our observations for models of the magnetic field structure in\nthese objects.\n", "  We estimate the number of AGN among the galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field\n(HDF). The recent discovery of a class of X-ray luminous narrow emission-line\ngalaxies has provided a possible explanation for the origin of the X-ray\nbackground (XRB), although the nature of the activity is still unresolved. By\nextrapolating the observed X-ray number count distribution to faint optical\nmagnitudes we predict that this AGN population could account for a significant\nfraction, $\\sim 10$ per cent, of the galaxies in the HDF. In contrast, normal\nbroad line QSOs are expected to account for no more than $\\sim 0.1$ per cent of\nthe sources at these magnitudes.\n", "  The location accuracy of the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras and acute\nground-based followup have led to the detection of a decaying afterglow in X\nrays and optical light following the classical gamma-ray burst GRB 970228. The\nafterglow in X rays and optical light fades as a power law at all wavelengths.\nThis behaviour was predicted for a relativistic blast wave that radiates its\nenergy when it decelerates by ploughing into the surrounding medium. Because\nthe afterglow has continued with unchanged behaviour for more than a month, its\ntotal energy must be of order 10**51 erg, placing it firmly at a redshift of\norder 1. Further tests of the model are discussed, some of which can be done\nwith available data, and implications for future observing strategies are\npointed out. We discuss how the afterglow can provide a probe for the nature of\nthe burst sources.\n", "  Motivated by the possibility of $H_0t_0 > 1$ where $H_0$ and $t_0$ are the\nHubble parameter and the age of the universe, respectively, we investigate the\ncosmology including x-matter. x-matter is expressed by the equation of state\n$p_x=w_0\\rho_{x0} + c_s^2(\\rho_x-\\rho_{x0})$, where $p_x$, $\\rho_x$ and\n$\\rho_{x0}$ are the pressure, the density of x-matter and the density at\npresent, respectively. $w_0$ and $c_s^2$ are functions of $\\rho_x$ in general.\nx-matter has the most general form of the equation of state which is\ncharacterized by 1)violation of strong energy condition at present for $w_0 <\n-1/3$ ; 2) locally stable (i.e. $c_s^2\\geq 0$); 3)causality is guaranteed\n($c_s\\leq 1$). Considering the case that $w_0$ and $c_s^2$ are constants, we\nfind that there is a large parameter space of $(w_0,c_s^2,\\Omega_{x0})$ in\nwhich the model universe is consistent with the age of the universe and the\nobservations of distant Type I supernovae.\n", "  When Cold Dark Matter (CDM) power spectrum normalized by COBE results, its\namplitude at smaller scales can be parametrized by $\\Gamma\\sim\\Omega_0h$. The\nexpected variations of Hubble flows in two samples, the sample of 36 clusters\nin the Mark III catalogue, and the sample of 20 Type Ia supernovae (SNe), are\ncalculated for the power spectrum in critical-density CDM models (including\ntilted CDM models and vacuum-dominated CDM models). The comparison between the\nexpectations and the real variations in the data offers a bias-free way to\nconstrain the power spectrum. The cluster sample yields $\\Gamma\\le\n0.30-0.88(n_{ps}-1)+1.9 (n_{ps}-1)^2$ at 95% C.L., with best fits $\\Gamma =\n0.15-0.39(n_{ps}-1)+0.37(n_{ps}-1)^2$, where $n_{ps}$ is the spectral index of\nthe power spectrum. The Type Ia SN sample yields $\\Gamma\\le\n0.25-0.80(n_{ps}-1)+1.6 (n_{ps}-1)^2$ at 95% C.L., strongly favoring lower\n$\\Gamma$'s. The results are inconsistent with a critical-density\nmatter-dominated universe with $n_{ps}\\ga 0.8$ and $H_0\\ga 50$ km/sec/Mpc.\n", "  We show that coronal magnetic dissipation in thin active sheets that sandwich\nstandard thin accretion disks in active galactic nuclei may account for\ncanonical electron temperatures of a few $\\times 10^9$K if protons acquire most\nof the dissipated energy. Coulomb collisions transfer energy from the ions to\nthe electrons, which subsequently cool rapidly by inverse-Compton scattering.\nIn equilibrium, the proton energy density likely exceeds that of the magnetic\nfield and both well exceed the electron and photon energy densities. The\nCoulomb energy transfer from protons to electrons is slow enough to maintain a\nhigh proton temperature, but fast enough to explain observed rapid X-ray\nvariabilities in Seyferts. The $\\sim 10^9$K electron temperature is insensitive\nto the proton temperature when the latter is $\\ge 10^{12}$K.\n", "  A recent spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB 970508 suggests that\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmological in origin and it is of crucial\nimportance to derive an accurate distance to each burst. If GRBs occur near\ntheir host galaxies then Lyman limit absorption should be observable in roughly\nhalf the GRB afterglow spectra. Here we outline the methodology to obtain a\nredshift from the GRB afterglow spectrum using the recently installed Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument onboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope. A low-resolution spectrum with the Multi-Anode Microchannel Array\n(MAMA) detector gives complete spectral coverage over the wavelength range\n157.0-318.0 nm (Near UV) and 115.0-174.0 nm (Far UV). Assuming a Target of\nOpportunity observation is conducted soon (< 3 weeks) after a bright burst, a\nrelatively small integration time (about 3 orbits) would be sufficient to\ndetect the Lyman limit over a wide redshift range (0.3 < z < 2.2). Detection\n(or non-detection) of the Lyman limit, in concert with ground-based\nobservations of nearby galaxies and Mg II and C IV absorption lines, should\nprovide meaningful constraints on the relationship of GRBs to galaxies.\n", "  We present the first HST long-slit spectrum of a gaseous disk around a\ncandidate super-massive black-hole. The results of this study on the kinematics\nof the gaseous disk in M87 are a considerable improvement in both spatial\nresolution and accuracy over previous observations and requires a projected\nmass of M_{BH}(sin i)^2 = (2.0+/- 0.5) 10^9 M_{sun} (M_{BH}=3.2 10^9 M_{sun}\nfor a disk inclination i=52deg) concentrated within a sphere whose radius is\nless than 0.05\" (3.5 pc) to explain the observed rotation curve. The kinematics\nof the ionized gas is well described by a thin disk in keplerian motion. A\nlower limit to the mass-to-light ratio of this region is M/L_{V}~110,\nsignificantly strengthening the claim that this mass is due to the presence of\na central black-hole in M87.\n", "  The core of the galactic globular cluster M13 (NGC 6205) has been observed\nwith WFPC2 on the Hubble Space Telescope through visual, blue and mid- and\nfar-UV filters in a programme devoted to study the UV population in a sample of\nGalactic globular clusters. In the UV Color Magnitude Diagrams derived from the\nHST images we have discovered three faint objects with a strong UV excess,\nwhich lie significantly outside the main loci defined by more than 12,000\nnormal cluster stars. The positions of two of the UV stars are nearly\ncoincident (7\" & 1\") to those of a low luminosity X-ray source recently found\nin the core of M13 and to a 3.5-sigma peak in the X-ray contour map. We suggest\nthat the UV stars are physically connected to the X-ray emission. The UV stars\nare very similar to the quiescent nova in the globular cluster M80, and they\nmight be a, perhaps new, subclass of cataclysmic variable.\n", "  The broad iron K$\\alpha$ emission line, commonly seen in the X-ray spectrum\nof Seyfert nuclei, is thought to originate when the inner accretion disk is\nilluminated by an active disk-corona. We show that relative motion between the\ndisk and the X-ray emitting material can have an important influence on the\nobserved equivalent width (EW) of this line via special relativistic aberration\nand Doppler effects. We suggest this may be relevant to understanding why the\nobserved EW often exceeds the prediction of the standard X-ray reflection\nmodel. Several observational tests are suggested that could disentangle these\nspecial relativistic effects from iron abundance effects.\n", "  We identify the likely optical counterpart to the LMC supersoft X-ray source\nRXJ0527.8-6954, and hence recover HV2554. This identification is based on an\nanalysis of approximately 4 years of optical photometry obtained\nserendipitously via the MACHO project. We see a steady fading of the star of\nabout 0.5 mag over the duration of the observations. Evidence is also presented\nfor an orbital modulation of 0.05 mag semi-amplitude on a period of P=0.39262\n+/- 00015 d. Our optical observations are consistent with the suggestion that\nthe X-ray decline in this system is caused by cooling after a weak shell flash.\n", "  Chemical and photometric models of elliptical galaxies with infall of\nprimordial gas, and subsequent ejection of processed material via galactic\nwinds, are described. Ensuring that these models are consistent with the\npresent-day colour-luminosity relation and the measured intracluster medium\n(ICM) abundances, we demonstrate that the initial mass function (IMF) must be\nsignificantly flatter (i.e., x<=0.80) than the canonical Salpeter slope (i.e.,\nx=1.35). Such a ``top-heavy'' IMF is in agreement with the earlier conclusions\nbased upon closed-box models for elliptical galaxy evolution. On the other\nhand, the top-heavy IMF, in conjunction with these semi-analytic infall models,\npredicts an ICM gas mass which exceeds that observed by up to a factor three,\nin contrast with the canonical closed-box models. Time and position-dependent\nIMF formalisms may prove to be a fruitful avenue for future research, but those\npresently available in the literature are shown to be inconsistent with several\nimportant observational constraints.\n", "  We report imaging photometry of the radio-jet black hole candidate source GRS\n1915+105 in the infrared K band. The observations reveal rapid infrared flare\nevents on timescales of less than an hour. These events are strikingly similar\nto those regularly observed in radio monitoring at 15 GHz. Furthermore, when\ndereddened, the infrared events have comparable amplitudes to the radio\noscillations, and observations at 15 GHz made approx. 8 hr after our infrared\nobservations reveal that the source was indeed displaying radio oscillations at\nthis time. We suggest that we have observed infrared synchrotron emission from\nthis source. We estimate the equipartition magnetic field and power required to\naccelerate the particles for the repeated radio events, and find both to be\norders of magnitude greater than those estimated for any other X-ray binary.\n", "  We have found the first convincing evidence for spiral structure in the\naccretion disc of a close binary. The eclipsing dwarf nova binary IP Peg,\nobserved during the end phase of a rise to outburst, shows strong Balmer and\nHelium emission lines in its spectra, with asymmetric double peaked velocity\nprofiles produced in the accretion disc around the white dwarf. To reveal the\ntwo armed spiral on the accretion disc, we de-project the observed emission\nline profiles onto a Doppler coordinate frame, a technique known as Doppler\ntomography. The two armed spiral structure we see in the Doppler tomograms is\nexpected to form when the disc becomes sufficiently large in outburst so that\nthe tides induced by the secondary star can excite waves in the outer disc.\nSuch spiral waves have been predicted in studies of tidal effects in discs and\nare fundamental in understanding the angular momentum budget of accretion\ndiscs.\n", "  We examine the possibility that ram pressure exerted by the galactic wind\nfrom the Galaxy could have stripped gas from the Local Group dwarf galaxies,\nthereby affecting their star formation histories. Whether gas stripping occurs\nor not depends on the relative magnitudes of two counteracting forces acting on\ngas in a dwarf galaxy: ram pressure force by the wind and the gravitational\nbinding force by the dwarf galaxy itself. We suggest that the galactic wind\ncould have stripped gas in a dwarf galaxy located within the distance of\n$R_{c}\\simeq 120(r_{s}/1 {kpc})^{3/2} ({\\cal E}_{b}/10^{50} {erg})^{-1/2}$ kpc\n(where $r_{s}$ is the surface radius and ${\\cal E}_{b}$ is the total binding\nenergy of the dwarf galaxy, respectively) from the Galaxy within a timescale of\nGyr, thereby preventing star formation there. Our result based on this Galactic\nwind model explains the recent observation that dwarfs located close to the\nGalaxy experienced star formation only in the early phase of their lifetimes,\nwhereas distant dwarfs are still undergoing star formation. The present star\nformation in the Large Magellanic Cloud can also be explained through our\nGalactic wind model.\n", "  We report the serendipitous detection of an X-ray source, AXJ1749+684, with\nthe ASCA Gas Imaging Spectrometer. AXJ1749+684 is identified with a\nLINER/starburst-type spiral galaxy KUG 1750+683A at a redshift z = 0.05. It has\na hard X-ray spectrum, consistent with that of the X-ray background (XRB) in\nthe 1-10 keV band. Despite the optical classification, the X-ray luminosity\ncannot be explained by starburst activity. Combined with spatial variations in\nthe optical emission line ratios, this suggests the presence of an obscured\nSeyfert nucleus embedded within a starforming galaxy. Similar behaviour could\nexplain the ambiguous properties of the faint narrow-line X-ray galaxies\n(NLXGs) emerging from deep X-ray surveys.\n", "  We present the preliminary results of Monte Carlo simulations aimed to\ninvestigate the effects of realistic dust extinction (absorption + scattering)\non the colours of high-z galaxies. In this paper, we concentrate on the case of\nspheroidal galaxies, and we obtain attenuation curves in the range\n0.1-1.2$\\mu$m for different dust spatial distributions, and for a range of\nvalues of the dust optical depth, geometrical thickness and inclination of the\ndust disk. We find that the resultant curves are strongly dependent on the dust\ngeometrical distribution and optical depth. A serendipitous finding is that the\nstrength of the 2200 \\AA absorption feature depends not only on the optical\ndepth, but also on the dust geometrical distribution. As a first application,\nwe test our results on two high-z galaxies with extremely red colours (HR10 and\nHR14) in order to infer clues on their ages, dust content and dust spatial\ndistribution. We confirm that HR10 must be a very dusty galaxy, and we suggest\nthat its stellar component should be strongly embedded in the dust in order to\nreproduce the observed extremely red colours.\n", "  Accreting black holes radiate in one of several spectral states, switching\nfrom one to another for reasons that are as yet not understood. Using the best\nstudied example, Cyg X-1, we identify the geometry and physical conditions\ncharacterizing these states. In particular, we show that in the hard state most\nof the accretion energy is dissipated in a corona-like structure which fills\nthe inner few tens of gravitational radii around the black hole and has Compton\noptical depth of order unity. In this state, an optically thick accretion disc\nextends out to greater distance, but penetrates only a short way into the\ncoronal region. In the soft state, the optically thick disc moves inward and\nreceives the majority of the dissipated energy, while the \"corona\" becomes\noptically thin and extends around much of the inner disc. The mass accretion\nrate in both states is $~10^{-8} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.\n", "  We use the relationships between galactic HI mass and B-band luminosity\ndetermined by Rao & Briggs to recalculate the mass density of neutral gas at\nthe present epoch based on more recent measures of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction than were available to those authors. We find $\\Omega_{gas}(z=0)\n\\simeq 5 \\times 10^{-4}$ in good agreement with the original Rao & Briggs\nvalue, suggesting that this quantity is now reasonably secure. We then show\nthat, if the scaling between H I mass and B-band luminosity has remained\napproximately constant since $z = 1$, the evolution of the luminosity function\nfound by the Canada-France redshift survey translates to an increase of\n$\\Omega_{gas}$ by a factor of $\\approx 3$ at $z = 0.5 - 1$ . A similar value is\nobtained quite independently from consideration of the luminosity function of\nMg II absorbers at $z = 0.65$. By combining these new estimates with data from\ndamped \\lya systems at higher redshift, it is possible to assemble a rough\nsketch of the evolution of $\\Omega_{gas}$ over the last 90% of the age of the\nuniverse. The consumption of H I gas with time is in broad agreement with\nmodels of chemical evolution which include the effects of dust, although more\nextensive samples of damped \\lya systems at low and intermediate redshift are\nrequired for a quantitative assessment of the dust bias.\n", "  Gravitational lensing studies suggest that the Universe may contain a\npopulation of dark galaxies; we investigate this intriguing possibility and\npropose a mechanism to explain their nature. In this mechanism a dark galaxy is\nformed with a low density disk in a dark halo of high spin parameter; such\ngalaxies can have surface densities below the critical Toomre value for\ninstabilities to develop, and following Kennicutt's work we expect these\ngalaxies to have low star formation rates. The only stellar component of the\ngalaxies is a halo system, formed during the collapse of the proto-galactic\ncloud. We compute synthetic stellar population models and show that, at a\nredshift $z=0.5$, such galaxies have apparent magnitudes $B \\simeq 28, R \\simeq\n26$ and $I \\simeq 25$, and could be unveiled by deep searches with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope. Dark galaxies have an initial short blue phase and then become\nessentially invisible, therefore they may account for the blue population of\ngalaxies at high redshift. We find a strong mass-dependence in the fraction of\ndark galaxies, and predict that spiral galaxies will not be found in halos with\nmasses less than about $10^9 M_\\odot$, if $\\Omega=1$. Above about\n$10^{12}M_\\odot$, all halos can produce luminous disks. The mass-dependence of\nthe galaxy-formation efficiency introduces the possibility of `spin bias' --\nluminous galaxies being associated preferentially with strongly-clustered\nhigh-mass halos. A further prediction is that the slope of the faint-end\nluminosity function for galaxies will be flatter than the associated halo mass\nfunction.\n", "  A search for lithium is performed on seven metal poor dwarfs with\nmetallicities ranging from [Fe/H]=-1.5 down to [Fe/H]=-3.0 but showing\ndisk-like kinematics. These stars belong to the metal poor tail of the Galactic\nthick disk and they may be also the result of an accretion event (Beers and\nSommer-Larsen 1995). The Li 6707.8 A line is present in all the seven dwarfs.\nThe weighted average of the Li abundance for the stars is A(Li)=2.20 (+/-0.06)\nand is consistent within the errors with the plateau Li abundance of\nA(Li)=2.24(+/- 0.012) found in genuine halo stars in the same range of\nmetallicities (Bonifacio and Molaro 1997). One of the stars, CS 22182-24, shows\nsomewhat lower Li abundance (A(Li)=1.6(+/-0.40)) and is a candidate to being a\nLi-poor star. Whether this group of stars belongs to the oldest stars in the\ndisk or to the old population of an external galaxy accreted by the Milky Way,\nthe present observations provide support to the universality of a pre-Galactic\nLi abundance as is observed in the Galactic halo stars.\n", "  Recently, Park and Gott reported an interesting observation: image separation\nof lensed QSOs declines with QSO redshift more precipitously than expected in\nany realistic world model, if the lenses are taken to be either singular\nisothermal spheres or point masses. In this Letter I propose that the observed\ntrend arises naturally if the lensing galaxies have logarithmic surface mass\ndensity profiles that gradually change with radius. If the observed lack of\ncentral (odd) images is also taken into account, the data favor a universal\ndark matter density profile over an isothermal sphere with a core. Since the\ntrend of image separation vs. source redshift is mostly a reflection of galaxy\nproperties, it cannot be straightforwardly used as a test of cosmological\nmodels. Furthermore, the current upper limits on the cosmological constant may\nhave to be revised.\n", "  We study the rms peculiar velocity of clusters as a convenient statistic to\nput constraints on cosmological models. This statistic is easy to compute\ntheoretically given a model for the power spectrum; we show that with some\nassumptions it can be directly related to the quantity\n$\\Omega_0^{0.6}\\sigma_8$. We develop a likelihood method for estimating the rms\npeculiar velocity of clusters from line-of-sight velocity measurements and\ntheir associated errors. We apply our method to two samples of cluster peculiar\nvelocities; a new sample known as the SCI sample and a subsample of the Mark\nIII catalog. Although these two samples initially give results which are\ninconsistent, we show that they can be put into good agreement by the removal,\nparticularly from the Mark III sample, of a set of clusters with multiple mass\nconcentrations, cluster membership ambiguities, or excessive obscuration,\nproperties which may have introduced unaccounted for errors into measurements\nof their peculiar velocities. Once these clusters are removed from the samples,\nthey both favor a relatively low value for the 1-D rms peculiar velocity of\nclusters $\\sigma_v= 265^{+106}_{-75}{km s}^{-1}$ (at 90% confidence), leading\nto the constraint $\\Omega_0^{0.6}\\sigma_8= 0.44^{+0.19}_{-0.13}$, consistent\nwith cluster abundance studies but inconsistent with $\\Omega_0=1$ CDM\nnormalized to COBE at the 99.7% confidence level.\n", "  The bulge of the Galaxy is analysed by inverting K-band star counts from the\nTwo-Micron Galactic Survey in a number of off-plane regions. A total area of\nabout 75 square degrees of sky is analysed. Assuming a non-variable luminosity\nfunction within the bulge, we derive the top end of the K-band luminosity\nfunction and the stellar density function, whose morphology is fitted to\ntriaxial ellipsoids.\n  The luminosity function shows a sharp decrease brighter than $M_K=-8.0$ when\ncompared with the disc population. By fitting ellipsoids, we find that the\nbulge is triaxial with the major axis in the plane at an angle with line of\nsight to the Galactic centre of $12^\\circ$ in the first quadrant. The axial\nratios are $1:0.54:0.33$ and the distance of the Sun from the centre of the\ntriaxial ellipsoid is 7860 pc.\n  The best fit for the stellar density, assuming an ellipsoidal distribution,\nis $D(t)=1.17(t/2180)^{-1.8}\\exp(- (t/2180)^{1.8}) stars pc^{-3}$, for\n$1300<t<3000$, where $t$ is the distance along the major axis of the ellipsoid\nin parsecs.\n", "  Just as the ordinary Doppler effect serves as a tool to measure radial\nvelocities of celestial objects, so can the relativistic Doppler effect be\nimplemented to measure a combination of radial and transverse velocities by\nusing recent improvements in observing techniques. A key element that makes a\nfurther use of this combination feasible is the periodicity in changes of the\norbital velocity direction for the source. Two cases are considered: (i) a\nbinary star; and (ii) a solitary star with the planetary companion. It is shown\nthat, in case (i), several precision Doppler measurements employing the gas\nabsorption cell technique would determine both the total orbital velocity and\nthe inclination angle of the binary orbit disentangled from the peculiar\nvelocity of the system. The necessary condition for that is the measured, at\nleast with a modest precision, proper motion and distance to the system.\n", "  Neumann's principle (that the symmetry of a crystal measurement cannot be\nlower than that of its point-group) is a corner- stone of crystallography: were\nit false, then the technique of x-ray diffraction (double-helix, DNA) might\nwell not exist. The literature variously regards its truth as obvious,\nintuitive, axiomatic or even impossible [10], without further analysis or\nproof. After identifying and correcting a false lead/start, we give a plausible\nproof of Neumann's principle, using group theory and quantum statistical\nmechanics.\n", "  A weakly complete finitary axiomatization for EQPL (exogenous quantum\npropositional logic) is presented. The proof is carried out using a non trivial\nextension of the Fagin-Halpern-Megiddo technique together with three Henkin\nstyle completions.\n"]}
