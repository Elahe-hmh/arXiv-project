However, it could also give important\ninsights about the feedback between a rotating black hole, its ergosphere, and\na surrounding accretion disk. The energy flow between these systems could be\nunderstood by studying the BZ power as a function of a slip factor, which in\nturn is defined as a function of the angular velocity of the black hole and the\nangular velocity of the magnetic field lines (generally anchored to the disk).\nThe distinct stages could explain the different types of observed AGN\n(with/without jets), but could also help understanding the evolution of the\nmerging of binary AGN.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\ncan withstand a large deformation without fracture or inelastic relaxation,\nmaking them attractive for application in novel strain-engineered and flexible\nelectronic and optoelectronic devices. In this study, we characterize the\nmechanical response of monolayer group VI TMDs to large elastic deformation\nusing first-principles density functional theory calculations. We find that the\nultimate strength and the overall stress response of these 2D materials is\nstrongly influenced by their chemical composition and loading direction. We\ndemonstrate that differences in the observed mechanical behavior can be\nattributed to the spatial redistribution of the occupied hybridized electronic\nstates in the region between the transition metal atom and the chalcogens. In\nspite of the strong covalent bonding between the transition metal and the\nchalcogens, we find that a simple linear relationship can be established to\ndescribe the dependence of the mechanical strength on the charge transfer from\nthe transition metal atom to the chalcogens.\n", "  Inducing magnetism in graphene holds great promises, such as controlling the\nexchange interaction with a gate electrode and generating exotic magnetic\nphases. Coating graphene with magnetic molecules or atoms has so far mostly\nlead to decreased graphene mobility. In the present work, we show that\nPt-porphyrins adsorbed on graphene lead to an enhanced mobility and to\ngate-dependent magnetism. We report that porphyrins can be donor or acceptor,\ndepending on graphene s initial doping. The porphyrins transfer charge and\nionize around the charged impurities on graphene, decreasing the graphene\ndoping and increasing its mobility. In addition, ionized porphyrins carry a\nmagnetic moment. Using the sensitivity of mesoscopic transport to magnetism, in\nparticular the superconducting proximity effect and conductance fluctuations,\nwe explore the magnetic order induced in graphene by the interacting magnetic\nmoments of the ionized porphyrins. Among the signatures of magnetism, we find\ntwo-terminal-magnetoresistance fluctuations with an odd component, a tell-tale\nsign of time reversal symmetry breaking at zero field, that does not exist in\nuncoated graphene sample. When graphene is connected to superconducting\nelectrodes, the induced magnetism leads to a gate-voltage-dependent suppression\nof the supercurrent, modified magnetic interference patterns, and\ngate-voltage-dependent magnetic hysteresis. The magnetic signatures are\ngreatest for long superconductor graphene superconductor junctions and for\nsamples with the highest initial doping, compatible with a greater number of\nionized and thus magnetic porphyrins. Our findings suggest that long-range\nmagnetism is induced through graphene by the ionized porphyrins magnetic\nmoment. This magnetic interaction is controlled by the density of carriers in\ngraphene, a tunability that could be exploited in spintronic applications.\n", "  The unusual quantum Hall effect (QHE) in graphene is often discussed in terms\nof Dirac fermions moving with a linear dispersion relation. The same phenomenon\nwill be explained in terms of the more traditional composite bosons, which move\nwith a linear dispersion relation. The \"electron\" (wave packet) moves easier in\nthe direction [1,1,0,c-axis] = [1,1,0] of the honeycomb lattice than\nperpendicular to it, while the \"hole\" moves easier in [0,0,1]. Since\n\"electrons\" and \"holes\" move in different channels, the number densities can be\nhigh especially when the Fermi surface has \"necks\". The strong QHE arises from\nthe phonon exchange attraction in the neighborhood of the \"neck\" Fermi\nsurfaces. The plateau observed for the Hall conductivity and the accompanied\nresistivity drop is due to the Bose-Einstein condensation of the c-bosons, each\nforming from a pair of one-electron--two-fluxons c-fermions by phonon-exchange\nattraction.\n", "  We find a permutation relation among Yangian Invariants -- two Yangian\nInvariants with adjacent external lines exchanged are related by a simple\nkinematic factor. This relation is shown to be equivalent to U(1) decoupling\nand Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relation at the level of maximal helicity\nviolating (MHV) amplitudes. Together with the newly found permutation relation\nand using unitarity cuts to remove ambiguity in the definition of loop momenta\nof cut amplitudes due to the nonplanar legs, we propose a systematic way of\nreconstructing the the integrands of nonplanar MHV amplitudes up to a rational\nfunction which vanishes under all possible unitarity cuts. This method when\napplied to planar diagrams reproduces results from the single cut method. As\nexplicit examples the construction of one-loop double-trace MHV amplitudes of\n4- and 5-point interactions are presented using on-shell diagrams. The\nkinematic factors and the resultant planar diagrams are carefully dealt with\nusing the unitarity cut condition. The first next-to-MHV amplitudes are\naddressed using generalized unitarity cuts. Their leading singularities can be\nidentified as residues of the Grassmanian integral. This example also serve to\ndemonstrate the power of the newly found relation of Yangian Invariants.\n", "  We report on the possibility to use dark matter particle's mass and its cross\nsection as a smoking gun signal of the existence of a Big Bounce at the early\nstage in the evolution of our currently observed universe. A model independent\nstudy of dark matter production in the pre-bounce contraction and the\npost-bounce expansion epochs of the bounce universe reveals a new venue for\nachieving the observed relic abundance of our present universe, in which a\nsignificantly smaller amount of dark matter with a smaller cross section -- as\ncompared to the prediction of Standard Cosmology -- is produced and carries the\ninformation about the bounce universe evolution. Once the values of dark matter\nmass and cross section are obtained by direct detection in laboratories, this\nalternative route becomes a signature of the bounce universe scenario.\n", "  Does the complex processes of angiogenesis during organism development\nultimately lead to a near optimal coronary vasculature in the organs of adult\nmammals? We examine this hypothesis using a powerful and universal method,\nbuilt on physical and physiological principles, for the determination of\nglobally energetically optimal arterial trees. The method is based on simulated\nannealing, and can be used to examine arteries in hollow organs with arbitrary\ntissue geometries. We demonstrate that the approach can generate in-silico\nvasculatures which closely match porcine anatomical data for the coronary\narteries on all length scales, and that the optimised arterial trees improve\nsystematically as computational time increases. The method presented here is\ngeneral, and could in principle be used to examine the arteries of other\norgans. Potential applications include improvement of medical imaging analysis\nand the design of vascular trees for artificial organs.\n", "  Projective measurements are an essential element of quantum mechanics. In\nmost cases, they cause an irreversible change of the quantum system on which\nthey act. However, measurements can also be used to stabilize quantum states\nfrom decay processes, which is known as the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). Here, we\ndemonstrate this effect for the case of a superposition state of a nuclear spin\nqubit, using an ancilla to perform the measurement. As a result, the quantum\nstate of the qubit is protected against dephasing without relying on an\nensemble nature of NMR experiments. We also propose a scheme to protect an\narbitrary state by using QZE.\n", "  We discuss the generation of primordial magnetic fields during inflation in\nthe dilaton-axion electromagnetism, in which the dilaton and axion dynamics are\nintroduced in terms of two time dependent functions of the cosmic scale factor,\n$I(a) F^2/4$ and $J(a) F\\tilde{F}/4$, respectively, where $F$ is the\nelectromagnetic field strength and $\\tilde{F}$ is its dual. We study the form\nof $J(a)$ that can generate a large seed magnetic field in the weak coupling\nregime, $I(a)<1$. Although the $J(a)$ function is model dependent, the\naxion-photon coupling indeed opens up a new window for a successful\ninflationary magnetogenesis.\n", "  Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we characterize the\nenergy spectra of particles accelerated by relativistic magnetic reconnection\n(without guide field) in collisionless electron-positron plasmas, for a wide\nrange of upstream magnetizations $\\sigma$ and system sizes $L$. The particle\nspectra are well-represented by a power law $\\gamma^{-\\alpha}$, with a\ncombination of exponential and super-exponential high-energy cutoffs,\nproportional to $\\sigma$ and $L$, respectively. For large $L$ and $\\sigma$, the\npower-law index $\\alpha$ approaches about 1.2.\n", "  Interpolating functional method is a powerful tool for studying the behavior\nof a quantity in the intermediate region of the parameter space of interest by\nusing its perturbative expansions at both ends. Recently several interpolating\nfunctional methods have been proposed, in addition to the well-known Pade\napproximant, namely the \"Fractional Power of Polynomial\" (FPP) and the\n\"Fractional Power of Rational functions\" (FPR) methods. Since combinations of\nthese methods also give interpolating functions, we may end up with multitudes\nof the possible approaches. So a criterion for choosing an appropriate\ninterpolating function is very much needed. In this paper, we propose reference\nquantities which can be used for choosing a good interpolating function. In\norder to validate the prescription based on these quantities, we study the\ndegree of correlation between \"the reference quantities\" and the \"actual degree\nof deviation between the interpolating function and the true function\" in\nexamples where the true functions are known.\n", "  We have performed calculations based on the Skyrme energy density functional\n(EDF) that includes arbitrary mixing between protons and neutrons. In this\nframework, single-particle states are generalized as mixtures of proton and\nneutron components. The model assumes that the Skyrme EDF is invariant under\nthe rotation in isospin space and the Coulomb force is the only source of the\nisospin symmetry breaking. To control the isospin of the system, we employ the\nisocranking method, which is analogous to the standard cranking approach used\nfor describing high-spin states. Here, we present results of the isocranking\ncalculations performed for the isobaric analog states in $A = 40$ and $A = 54$\nnuclei.\n", "  In superfluids the order parameter, which describes spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking, is an analogue of the Higgs field in the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. Oscillations of the field amplitude are massive Higgs bosons, while\noscillations of the orientation are massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The\n125~GeV Higgs boson, discovered at Large Hadron Collider, is light compared to\nelectroweak energy scale, which led to a suggestion of the ``little Higgs''\nextension of the Standard Model, in which the light Higgs appears as a NG mode\nacquiring mass due to violation of a hidden symmetry. Here we show that such\nlight Higgs exists in superfluid $^3$He-B, where one of three Nambu-Goldstone\nspin-wave modes acquires small mass due to the spin-orbit interaction. Other\nmodes become optical and acoustic magnons. We observe parametric decay of\nBose-Einstein condensate of optical magnons to light Higgs modes and decay of\noptical to acoustic magnons. Formation of a light Higgs from a Nambu-Goldstone\nmode observed in $^3$He-B opens a possibility that such scenario can be\nrealized in other systems, where violation of some hidden symmetry is possible,\nincluding the Standard Model.\n", "  We present a general theory of circular dichroism in planar chiral\nnanostructures with rotational symmetry. It is demonstrated, analytically, that\nthe handedness of the incident field's polarization can control whether a\nnanostructure induces either absorption or scattering losses, even when the\ntotal optical loss (extinction) is polarization-independent. We show that this\neffect is a consequence of modal interference so that strong circular dichroism\nin absorption and scattering can be engineered by combining Fano resonances\nwith planar chiral nanoparticle clusters.\n", "  Here, we demonstrate that the power spectral density of thermal radiation at\na specific wavelength produced by a body of finite dimensions set up in free\nspace under a fixed temperature could be made theoretically arbitrary high, if\none could realize double negative metamaterials with arbitrary small loss and\narbitrary high absolute values of permittivity and permeability (at a given\nfrequency). This result refutes the widespread belief that Planck's law itself\nsets a hard upper limit on the spectral density of power emitted by a finite\nmacroscopic body whose size is much greater that the wavelength. Here we\npropose a physical realization of a metamaterial emitter whose spectral\nemissivity can be greater than that of the ideal black body under the same\nconditions. Due to the reciprocity between the heat emission and absorption\nprocesses such cooled down superemitter also acts as an optimal sink for the\nthermal radiation --- the \"thermal black hole\" --- which outperforms\nKirchhoff-Planck's black body which can absorb only the rays directly incident\non its surface. The results may open a possibility to realize narrowband\nsuper-Planckian thermal radiators and absorbers for future thermo-photovoltaic\nsystems and other devices.\n", "  Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is used to study the band\ndispersion and the quasiparticle scattering rates in two ferropnictides\nsystems. Our ARPES results show linear-in-energy dependent scattering rates\nwhich are constant in a wide range of control parameter and which depend on the\norbital character of the bands. We demonstrate that the linear energy\ndependence gives rise to weakly dispersing band with a strong mass enhancement\nwhen the band maximum crosses the chemical potential. In the superconducting\nphase the related small effective Fermi energy favors a\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\\,\\cite{Bardeen1957}-Bose-Einstein\n(BE)\\,\\cite{Bose1924} crossover state.\n", "  Louis Neel pointed out in his Nobel lecture that while abundant and\ninteresting from a theoretical viewpoint, antiferromagnets did not seem to have\nany applications. Indeed, the alternating directions of magnetic moments on\nindividual atoms and the resulting zero net magnetization make antiferromagnets\nhard to control by tools common in ferromagnets. Remarkably, Neel in his\nlecture provides the key which, as we show here, allows us to control\nantiferromagnets by electrical means analogous to those which paved the way to\nthe development of ferromagnetic spintronics applications. The key noted by\nNeel is the equivalence of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets for effects that\nare an even function of the magnetic moment. Based on even-in-moment\nrelativistic transport phenomena, we demonstrate room-temperature electrical\nswitching between two stable configurations combined with electrical read-out\nin antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin film devices. Our magnetic memory is\ninsensitive to and produces no magnetic field perturbations which illustrates\nthe unique merits of antiferromagnets for spintronics.\n", "  We analyze the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity in fluid dynamics\nformulated as the nonuniqueness of solutions resulting from viscosity at\ninfinitesimal scales acting through intermediate on large scales of the flow.\nWe study the finite-time onset of spontaneous stochasticity in a real version\nof the GOY shell model of turbulence. This model allows high-accuracy numerical\nsimulations for a wide range of scales (up to ten orders of magnitude) and\ndemonstrates non-chaotic dynamics, but leads to an infinite number of solutions\nin the vanishing viscosity limit after the blowup time. Thus, the spontaneous\nstochasticity phenomenon is clearly distinguished from the chaotic behavior in\nturbulent flows. We provide the numerical and theoretical description of the\nsystem dynamics at all stages. This includes the asymptotic analysis before and\nafter the blowup leading to universal (periodic and quasi-periodic)\nrenormalized solutions, followed by nonunique stationary states at large times.\n", "  Tracking the kinematics of fast-moving objects is an important diagnostic\ntool for science and engineering. Existing optical methods include high-speed\nCCD/CMOS imaging, streak cameras, lidar, serial time-encoded imaging and\nsequentially timed all-optical mapping. Here, we demonstrate an entirely new\napproach to positional and directional sensing based on the concept of\nclassical entanglement in vector beams of light. The measurement principle\nrelies on the intrinsic correlations existing in such beams between transverse\nspatial modes and polarization. The latter can be determined from intensity\nmeasurements with only a few fast photodiodes, greatly outperforming the\nbandwidth of current CCD/CMOS devices. In this way, our setup enables\ntwo-dimensional real-time sensing with temporal resolution in the GHz range. We\nexpect the concept to open up new directions in photonics-based metrology and\nsensing.\n", "  In a fully-gapped superconductor the electronic Raman response has a\npair-breaking peak at twice the superconducting gap $\\Delta$, if the Bogoliubov\nexcitations are uncorrelated. Motivated by the iron based superconductors, we\nstudy how this peak is modified if the superconducting phase hosts a\nnematic-structural quantum critical point. We show that, upon approaching this\npoint by tuning, e.g., doping, the growth of nematic correlations between the\nquasiparticles transforms the pair-breaking peak into a nematic resonance. The\nmode energy is below 2$\\Delta$, and stays finite at the quantum critical point,\nwhere its spectral weight is sharply enhanced. The latter is consistent with\nrecent experiments on electron-doped iron based superconductors and provides\ndirect evidence of nematic correlations in their superconducting phases.\n", "  We study a chain of four interacting rotors (rotators) connected at both ends\nto stochastic heat baths at different temperatures. We show that for\nnon-degenerate interaction potentials the system relaxes, at a stretched\nexponential rate, to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Rotors with high\nenergy tend to decouple from their neighbors due to fast oscillation of the\nforces. Because of this, the energy of the central two rotors, which interact\nwith the heat baths only through the external rotors, can take a very long time\nto dissipate. By appropriately averaging the oscillatory forces, we estimate\nthe dissipation rate and construct a Lyapunov function. Compared to the chain\nof length three (considered previously by C. Poquet and the current authors),\nthe new difficulty with four rotors is the appearance of resonances when both\ncentral rotors are fast. We deal with these resonances using the rapid\nthermalization of the two external rotors.\n", "  We describe a quasiperiodic optical lattice, created by a physical\nrealization of the abstract cut-and-project construction underlying all\nquasicrystals. The resulting potential is a generalization of the Fibonacci\ntiling. Calculation of the energies and wavefunctions of ultracold atoms loaded\ninto such a lattice demonstrate a multifractal energy spectrum, a singular\ncontinuous momentum-space structure, and the existence of controllable edge\nstates. These results open the door to cold atom quantum simulation experiments\nin tunable or dynamic quasicrystalline potentials, including topological\npumping of edge states and phasonic spectroscopy.\n", "  A prototype of Multi-strip Multi-gap Resistive Plate chamber (MMRPC) with\nactive area 40 cm $\\times$ 20 cm has been developed at SINP, Kolkata. Detailed\nresponse of the developed detector was studied with the pulsed electron beam\nfrom ELBE at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf. In this report the response\nof SINP developed MMRPC with different controlling parameters is described in\ndetails. The obtained time resolution ($\\sigma_t$) of the detector after slew\ncorrection was 91.5$ \\pm $3 ps. Position resolution measured along ($\\sigma_x$)\nand across ($\\sigma_y$) the strip was 2.8$\\pm$0.6 cm and 0.58 cm, respectively.\nThe measured absolute efficiency of the detector for minimum ionizing particle\nlike electron was 95.8$\\pm$1.3 $\\%$. Better timing resolution of the detector\ncan be achieved by restricting the events to a single strip. The response of\nthe detector was mainly in avalanche mode but a few percentage of streamer mode\nresponse was also observed. A comparison of the response of these two modes\nwith trigger rate was studied\n", "  The influence of magnetic dipole interactions (MDIs) on the magnetic\nproperties of local-moment spin systems is investigated. The eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the MDI tensor are determined for a wide variety of spin\nlattices and magnetic wavevectors in the magnetically ordered state with\ncollinear moment alignments. The predicted easy axes in the ordered state are\ncompared with experimental results for antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds. The\ntheory is generalized to include noncollinear AFM structures and compared with\nexperiments. Many properties caused or influenced by MDIs in the ordered and\nparamagnetic states are calculated within Weiss molecular field theory.\n", "  We consider theories where dark matter is composed of a thermal relic of weak\nscale mass, whose couplings to the Standard Model (SM) are however too small to\ngive rise to the observed abundance. Instead, the abundance is set by\nannihilation to light hidden sector states that carry no charges under the SM\ngauge interactions. In such a scenario the constraints from direct and indirect\ndetection, and from collider searches for dark matter, can easily be satisfied.\nThe masses of such light hidden states can be protected by symmetry if they are\nNambu-Goldstone bosons, fermions, or gauge bosons. These states can then\ncontribute to the cosmic energy density as dark radiation, leading to\nobservable signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore,\ndepending on whether or not the light hidden sector states self-interact, the\nfraction of the total energy density that free-streams is either decreased or\nincreased, leading to characteristic effects on both the scalar and tensor\ncomponents of the CMB anisotropy that allows these two cases to be\ndistinguished. The magnitude of these signals depends on the number of light\ndegrees of freedom in the hidden sector, and on the temperature at which it\nkinetically decouples from the SM. We consider a simple model that realizes\nthis scenario, based on a framework in which the SM and hidden sector are\ninitially in thermal equilibrium through the Higgs portal, and show that the\nresulting signals are compatible with recent Planck results, while large enough\nto be detected in upcoming experiments such as CMBPol and CMB Stage-IV.\nInvisible decays of the Higgs into hidden sector states at colliders can offer\na complementary probe of this model.\n", "  The information paradox can be resolved if we recognize that the\nwavefunctional in gravity $\\Psi[g]$ should be considered on the {\\it whole} of\nsuperspace, the space of possible $g$. The largeness of the Bekenstein entropy\nimplies a vast space of gravitational solutions, which are conjectured to be\nfuzzball configurations. In the WKB approximation, the wavefunctional for a\ncollapsing shell is oscillatory in a small region of superspace, and the\nclassical approximation picks out this part. But the wavefunctional will be\ndamped (`under the barrier') in the remainder of this vast superspace. We\nperform a simple computation to show that at the threshold of black hole\nformation, the barrier is lowered enough to make the latter part oscillatory;\nthis alters the classical evolution and avoids horizon formation.\n", "  We determine the orbits of fixed-point sublattices of the Leech lattice with\nrespect to the action of the Conway group Co_0. There are 290 such orbits.\nDetailed information about these lattices, the corresponding coinvariant\nlattices, and the stabilizing subgroups, is tabulated in several tables.\n", "  Since the invention of Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol, many quantum\nkey distribution (QKD) protocols have been proposed and some protocols are\noperated even in field environments. One of the striking features of QKD is\nthat QKD protocols are provably secure unlike cryptography based on\ncomputational complexity assumptions. It has been believed that, to guarantee\nthe security of QKD, Alice and Bob have to monitor the statistics of the\nmeasurement outcomes which are used to determine the amount of the privacy\namplification to generate a key. Recently a new type of QKD protocol, called\nround robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) protocol, was proposed, and\nremarkably this protocol can generate a key without monitoring any statistics\nof the measurement outcomes. Here we report an experimental realization of the\nRRDPS protocol. We used a setup in which Bob randomly chooses one from four\ninterferometers with different pulse delays so that he could implement phase\ndifference measurements for all possible combinations with five-pulse time-bin\nstates. Using the setup, we successfully distributed keys over 30 km of fiber,\nmaking this the first QKD experiment that does not rely on signal disturbance\nmonitoring.\n", "  Using numerical methods we discuss the effects of open boundary conditions on\ncondensation phenomena in the zero-range process (ZRP) and transport processes\nwith pair-factorized steady states (PFSS), an extended model of the ZRP with\nnearest-neighbor interaction. For the zero-range process we compare to\nanalytical results in the literature with respect to criticality and\ncondensation. For the extended model we find a similar phase structure, but\nobserve supercritical phases with droplet formation for strong boundary drives.\n", "  We consider deformations of unbounded operators by using the novel\nconstruction tool of warped convolutions. By using the Kato-Rellich theorem we\nshow that unbounded self-adjoint deformed operators are self-adjoint if they\nsatisfy a certain condition. This condition proves itself to be necessary for\nthe oscillatory integral to be well-defined. Moreover, different proofs are\ngiven for self-adjointness of deformed unbounded operators in the context of\nquantum mechanics and quantum field theory.\n", "  A search is performed for the production of heavy resonances decaying into\ntop-antitop quark pairs in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. Data\nused for the analyses were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an\nintegrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The search is performed using\nevents with three different final states, defined by the number of leptons\n(electrons and muons) from the t t-bar to W b W b decay. The analyses are\noptimized for reconstruction of top quarks with high Lorentz boosts, where jet\nsubstructure techniques are used to enhance the sensitivity. Results are\npresented for all channels and a combination is performed. No significant\nexcess of events relative to the expected yield from standard model processes\nis observed. Upper limits on the production cross section of heavy resonances\ndecaying to t t-bar are calculated. A narrow leptophobic topcolor Z' resonance\nwith a mass below 2.4 TeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. Limits are also\nderived for a broad Z' resonance with a 10% width relative to the resonance\nmass, and a Kaluza-Klein excitation of the gluon in the Randall-Sundrum model.\nThese are the most stringent limits to date on heavy resonances decaying into\ntop-antitop quark pairs.\n", "  Classical correlations without predefined causal order arise from processes\nwhere parties manipulate random variables, and where the order of these\ninteractions is not predefined. No assumption on the causal order of the\nparties is made, but the processes are restricted to be logically consistent\nunder any choice of the parties' operations. It is known that for three parties\nor more, this set of processes is larger than the set of processes achievable\nin a predefined ordering of the parties. Here, we model all classical processes\nwithout predefined causal order geometrically and find that the set of such\nprocesses forms a polytope. Additionally, we model a smaller polytope --- the\ndeterministic-extrema polytope --- where all extremal points represent\ndeterministic processes. This polytope excludes probabilistic processes that\nmust be --- quite unnaturally --- fine-tuned, because any variation of the\nweights in a decomposition into deterministic processes leads to a logical\ninconsistency.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite\ntemperature and finite density in an external magnetic field using the\nfunctional renormalization group. We investigate the dependence of the position\nof the ultraviolet fixed point (UVFP) of the four-Fermi coupling constant on\nthe temperature, density, and external magnetic field, and we obtain the chiral\nphase structure. The UVFP at low temperature and finite chemical potential\noscillates in a small external magnetic field, which can be interpreted as the\nde Haas--van Alphen effect. We also obtain phase diagrams with complex\nstructures, where the phase boundary moves back and forth as the external\nmagnetic field increases in the low temperature and high density region.\n", "  We report synthesis of non superconducting parent compound of iron\nchalcogenide, i.e., FeTe single crystal by self flux method. The FeTe single\ncrystal is crystallized in tetragonal structure with the P4/nmm space group.\nThe detailed SEM (scanning electron microscopy) results showed that the\ncrystals are formed in slab like morphology and are near (slight deficiency of\nTe) stoichiometric with homogenous distribution of Fe and Te. The coupled\nstructural and magnetic phase transition is seen at around 70K in both\nelectrical resistivity and magnetization measurements, which is hysteric\n(deltaT = 5K) in nature with cooling and warming cycles. Magnetic\nsusceptibility (chi-T) measurements showed the magnetic transition to be of\nantiferromagnetic nature, which is substantiated by isothermal magnetization\n(M-H) plots as well. The temperature dependent electrical resistivity measured\nin 10kOe field in both in plane and out of plane field directions showed that\nthe hysteric width nearly becomes double to deltaT = 10K, and is maximum for\nthe out of plane field direction for the studied FeTe single crystal. We also\nobtained a sharp spike like peak in heat capacity Cp(T) measurement due to the\ncoupled structural and magnetic order phase transitions.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the chiral magnetic instability in a\nprotoneutron star and compute the resulting magnetic power and helicity\nspectra. The instability may act during the early cooling phase of the hot\nprotoneutron star after supernova core collapse, where it can contribute to the\nbuildup of magnetic fields of strength up to the order of $10^{14}$ G. The\nmaximal field strengths generated by this instability, however, depend\nconsiderably on the temperature of the protoneutron star, on density\nfluctuations and turbulence spectrum of the medium. At the end of the hot\ncooling phase the magnetic field tends to be concentrated around the\nsubmillimeter to cm scale, where it is subject to slow resistive damping.\n", "  We report on strong renormalization encountered in periodically driven\ninteracting quantum dots in the non-adiabatic regime. Correlations between lead\nand dot electrons enhance or suppress the amplitude of driving depending on the\nsign of the interaction. Employing a newly developed flexible renormalization\ngroup based approach for periodic driving to an interacting resonant level we\nshow analytically that the magnitude of this effect follows a power law. Our\nsetup can act as a non-Markovian, single-parameter quantum pump.\n", "  Threshold models of global cascades have been extensively used to model\nreal-world collective behavior, such as the contagious spread of fads and the\nadoption of new technologies. A common property of those cascade models is that\na vanishingly small seed fraction can spread to a finite fraction of an\ninfinitely large network through local infections.\n  In social and economic networks, however, individuals' behavior is often\ninfluenced not only by what their direct neighbors are doing, but also by what\nthe majority of people are doing as a trend. A trend affects individuals'\nbehavior while individuals' behavior creates a trend.\n  To analyze such a complex interplay between local- and global-scale\nphenomena, I generalize the standard threshold model by introducing a new type\nof node, called \\textit{global nodes} (or \\textit{trend followers}), whose\nactivation probability depends on a global-scale trend; specifically the\npercentage of activated nodes in the population. The model shows that global\nnodes play a role as accelerating cascades once a trend emerges while reducing\nthe probability of a trend emerging. Global nodes thus either facilitate or\ninhibit cascades, suggesting that a moderate share of trend followers may\nmaximize the average size of cascades.\n", "  Determining relationships between different types of quantum correlations in\nopen composite quantum systems is important since it enables the exploitation\nof a type by knowing the amount of another type. We here review, by giving a\nformal demonstration, a closed formula of the Bell function, witnessing\nnonlocality, as a function of the concurrence, quantifying entanglement, valid\nfor a system of two noninteracting qubits initially prepared in extended\nWerner-like states undergoing any local pure-dephasing evolution. This formula\nallows for finding nonlocality thresholds for the concurrence depending only on\nthe purity of the initial state. We then utilize these thresholds in a\nparadigmatic system where the two qubits are locally affected by a quantum\nenvironment with an Ohmic class spectrum. We show that steady entanglement can\nbe achieved and provide the lower bound of initial state purity such that this\nstationary entanglement is above the nonlocality threshold thus guaranteeing\nthe maintenance of nonlocal correlations.\n", "  The critical point of a topological phase transition is described by a\nconformal field theory, where finite-size corrections to energy are uniquely\nrelated to its central charge. We investigate the finite-size scaling away from\ncriticality and find a scaling function, which discriminates between phases\nwith different topological indexes. This function appears to be universal for\nall five Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes with non-trivial topology in one\nspatial dimension. We obtain an analytic form of the scaling function and\ncompare it with numerical results.\n", "  A measurement is presented of differential cross sections for the Higgs boson\n(H) production in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The analysis exploits the H\nto gamma gamma decay in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7\ninverse femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The cross\nsection is measured as a function of the kinematic properties of the diphoton\nsystem and of the associated jets. Results corrected for detector effects are\ncompared with predictions at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading\norder in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, as well as with predictions\nbeyond the standard model. For isolated photons with pseudorapidities abs(eta)\n< 2.5, and with the photon of largest and next-to-largest transverse momentum\n(pt[gamma]) divided by the diphoton mass m[gamma-gamma] satisfying the\nrespective conditions of pt[gamma] / m[gamma-gamma] > 1/3 and > 1/4, the total\nfiducial cross section is 32 +/- 10 fb.\n", "  The early stage of high multiplicity pp, pA and AA collider is represented by\na nearly quarkless, hot, deconfined pure gluon plasma. According to pure\nYang-Mills Lattice Gauge Theory, this hot pure glue matter undergoes, at a high\ntemperature, $T_c = 270$ MeV, a first order phase transition into a confined\nHagedorn-GlueBall fluid. These new scenario should be characterized by a\nsuppression of high $p_T$ photons and dileptons, baryon suppression and\nenhanced strange meson production. We propose to observe this newly predicted\nclass of events at LHC and RHIC.\n", "  This is the third in a series of papers studying the astrophysics and\ncosmology of massive, dynamically relaxed galaxy clusters. Our sample comprises\n40 clusters identified as being dynamically relaxed and hot (i.e., massive) in\nPapers I and II of this series. Here we consider the thermodynamics of the\nintracluster medium, in particular the profiles of density, temperature and\nrelated quantities, as well as integrated measurements of gas mass, average\ntemperature, total luminosity and center-excluded luminosity. We fit power-law\nscaling relations of each of these quantities as a function of redshift and\ncluster mass, which can be measured precisely and with minimal bias for these\nrelaxed clusters using hydrostatic arguments. For the thermodynamic profiles,\nwe jointly model the density and temperature and their intrinsic scatter as a\nfunction of radius, thus also capturing the behavior of the gas pressure and\nentropy. For the integrated quantities, we also jointly fit a multidimensional\nintrinsic covariance. Our results reinforce the view that simple hydrodynamical\nmodels provide a good description of relaxed clusters outside their centers,\nbut that additional heating and cooling processes are important in the inner\nregions (radii $r < 0.5r_{2500} \\approx 0.15r_{500}$). The thermodynamic\nprofiles remain regular, with small intrinsic scatter, down to the smallest\nradii where deprojection is straightforward ($\\sim 20$ kpc); within this\nradius, even the most relaxed systems show clear departures from spherical\nsymmetry. Our results suggest that heating and cooling are continuously\nregulated in a tight feedback loop, allowing the cluster atmosphere to remain\nstratified on these scales.\n", "  The original frequentist approach for computing confidence intervals involves\nthe construction of the confidence belt which provides a mapping of the\nobservation in data into a subset of values for the parameter. There are\ndifferent prescriptions for constructing the confidence belt, here we use the\none provided by Feldman and Cousins. Alternative methods based on the\nfrequentist idea exist, including the delta likelihood method, the $CL_s$\nmethod and a method here referred to as the $p$-value method, which have all\nbeen commonly used in high energy experiments. The purpose of this article is\nto draw attention to a series of potential problems when applying these\nalternative methods to the important case where the predicted signal depends\nquadratically on the parameter of interest, a situation which is common in high\nenergy physics as it covers scenarios encountered in effective theories. These\ninclude anomalous Higgs couplings and anomalous trilinear and quartic gauge\ncouplings. It is found that the alternative methods, contrary to the original\nmethod using the confidence belt, encode the goodness-of-fit into the\nconfidence intervals and potentially over-constrain the parameter.\n", "  We present a few-parameter ansatz for pulses to implement a broad set of\nsimultaneous single-qubit rotations in frequency-crowded multilevel systems.\nSpecifically, we consider a system of two qutrits whose working and leakage\ntransitions suffer from spectral crowding (detuned by $\\delta$). In order to\nachieve precise controllability, we make use of two driving fields (each having\ntwo quadratures) at two different tones to implement arbitrary simultaneous\nrotations. Expanding the waveforms in terms of Hanning windows, we show how\nanalytic pulses containing smooth and composite-pulse features can easily\nachieve gate errors less than $10^{-4}$ and considerably outperform known\nadiabatic techniques. Moreover, we find a generalization of the WahWah method\nby Schutjens et al. [Phys. Rev. A 88, 052330 (2013)] that allows precise\nseparate single-qubit rotations for all gate times beyond a quantum speed\nlimit. We find in all cases a quantum speed limit slightly below $2\\pi/\\delta$\nfor the gate time and show that our pulses are robust against variations in\nsystem parameters and filtering due to transfer functions, making them suitable\nfor experimental implementations.\n", "  We present recursive multiport schemes for implementing quantum Fourier\ntransforms and the inversion step in Grover's algorithm on an integrated linear\noptics device. In particular, each scheme shows how to execute a quantum\noperation on $2d$ modes using a pair of circuits for the same operation on $d$\nmodes. The circuits operate on path-encoded qudits and realize $d$-dimensional\nunitary transformations on these states using linear optical networks with\n$O\\left(d^2\\right)$ optical elements. To evaluate the schemes against realistic\nerrors, we ran simulations of proof-of-principle experiments using a simple\nfabrication model of silicon-based photonic integrated devices that employ\ndirectional couplers and thermo-optic modulators for beam splitters and phase\nshifters, respectively. We find that high-fidelity performance is achievable\nwith our multiport circuits for $2$-qubit and $3$-qubit quantum Fourier\ntransforms, and for quantum search on four-item and eight-item databases.\n", "  We show that if the inflaton has a non-minimal coupling to gravity and the\nPlanck scale is dynamically generated, the results of Coleman-Weinberg\ninflation are confined in between two attractor solutions: quadratic inflation,\nwhich is ruled out by the recent measurements, and linear inflation which,\ninstead, is in the experimental allowed region. The minimal scenario has only\none free parameter -- the inflaton's non-minimal coupling to gravity -- that\ndetermines all physical parameters such as the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the\nreheating temperature of the Universe. Should the more precise future\nmeasurements of inflationary parameters point towards linear inflation, further\ninterest in scale-invariant scenarios would be motivated.\n", "  We analyze an electronic nanoscale thermal machine driven by time-dependent\nenvironment: besides bias and gate voltage variations, we consider also the\nless prevailing time modulation of the couplings between leads and dot. We\nprovide energy and heat current expressions in such situations, as well as\nexpressions for the power exchanged between the dot+leads system and its\noutside. Calculations are made in the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function\nframework. We apply these results to design a cyclic refrigerator,\ncircumventing the ambiguity of defining energy flows between subsystems in the\ncase of strong coupling. For fast lead-dot coupling modulation, we observe\ntransient currents which cannot be ascribed to charge tunneling.\n", "  A major focus of experimental interest in Sr2IrO4 has been to clarify how the\nmagnetic excitations of this strongly spin-orbit coupled system differ from the\npredictions of anisotropic 2D spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and to explore the\nextent to which strong spin-orbit coupling affects the magnetic properties of\niridates. Here, we present a high-resolution inelastic light (Raman) scattering\nstudy of the low energy magnetic excitation spectrum of Sr2IrO4 and doped\nEu-doped Sr2IrO4 as functions of both temperature and applied magnetic field.\nWe show that the high-field (H>1.5 T) in-plane spin dynamics of Sr2IrO4 are\nisotropic and governed by the interplay between the applied field and the small\nin-plane ferromagnetic spin components induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction. However, the spin dynamics of Sr2IrO4 at lower fields (H<1.5 T)\nexhibit important effects associated with interlayer coupling and in-plane\nanisotropy, including a spin-flop transition at Hc in Sr2IrO4 that occurs\neither discontinuously or via a continuous rotation of the spins, depending\nupon the in-plane orientation of the applied field. These results show that\nin-plane anisotropy and interlayer coupling effects play important roles in the\nlow-field magnetic and dynamical properties of Sr2IrO4.\n", "  The description of electroweak physics using perturbation theory is highly\nsuccessful. Though not obvious, this is due to a subtle field-theoretical\neffect, the Fr\\\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism, which links the physical\nspectrum to that of the elementary particles. This works because of the special\nstructure of the standard model, and it is not a priori clear whether it works\nfor structurally different theories. Candidates for conflicts are, e.g., grand\nunified theories. We study this situation in a toy model, a $SU(3)$ gauge\ntheory with two Higgs fields and a breaking pattern $SU(3) \\rightarrow SU(2)\n\\rightarrow 1$. This mimics the weak-Higgs sector of the standard model. We\ndetermine the leading order predictions for the gauge invariant spectrum in\nthis theory, and discuss a setup to test them using lattice gauge theory.\n", "  For a field theory with a gravitational dual, following Susskind's proposal\nwe define holographic complexity for a subsystem. The holographic complexity is\nproportional to the volume of a co-dimension one time slice in the bulk\ngeometry enclosed by the extremal co-dimension two hyper-surface appearing in\nthe computation of the holographic entanglement entropy. The proportionally\nconstant, up to a numerical order of one factor is G R where G is the Newton\nconstant and R is the curvature of the space time. We study this quantity in\ncertain holographic model. We also explore a possible relation between the\ndefined quantity and fidelity appearing in quantum information literature.\n", "  We compute the angular power spectra of the E-type and B-type lensing\npotentials for gravitational waves from inflation and for tensor perturbations\ninduced by scalar perturbations. We derive the tensor-lensed CMB power spectra\nfor both cases. We also apply our formalism to determine the linear lensing\npotential for a Bianchi I spacetime with small anisotropy.\n", "  Corrections to general relativity that introduce long-ranged scalar fields\nwhich are non-minimally coupled to curvature typically predict that neutron\nstars possess a non-trivial scalar field profile. An observer far from a star\nis most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that\ndecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,\nwhich is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.\nThe presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain\nextended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries. We estimate\nthese constraints to be ten times better than the current estimated bound, and\nalso include estimated constraints on generic quadratic gravity theories.\n", "  The finite-element method is a preferred numerical method when\nelectromagnetic fields at high accuracy are to be computed in nano-optics\ndesign. Here, we demonstrate a finite-element method using hp-adaptivity on\ntetrahedral meshes for computation of electromagnetic fields in a device with\nrough textures. The method allows for efficient computations on meshes with\nstrong variations in element sizes. This enables to use precise geometry\nresolution of the rough textures. Convergence to highly accurate results is\nobserved.\n", "  The peanosphere (or \"mating of trees\") construction of Duplantier, Miller,\nand Sheffield encodes certain types of $\\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity (LQG)\nsurfaces ($\\gamma \\in (0,2)$) decorated with an independent SLE$_{\\kappa}$\n($\\kappa = 16/\\gamma^2 > 4$) in terms of a correlated two-dimensional Brownian\nmotion and provides a framework for showing that random planar maps decorated\nwith statistical physics models converge to LQG decorated with an SLE.\nPreviously, the correlation for the Brownian motion was only explicitly\nidentified as $-\\cos(4\\pi/\\kappa)$ for $\\kappa \\in (4,8]$ and unknown for\n$\\kappa > 8$. The main result of this work is that this formula holds for all\n$\\kappa > 4$. This supplies the missing ingredient for proving convergence\nresults of the aforementioned type for $\\kappa > 8$. Our proof is based on the\ncalculation of a certain tail exponent for SLE$_{\\kappa}$ on a quantum wedge\nand then matching it with an exponent which is well-known for Brownian motion.\n", "  The conventional Skyrme interaction is generalized by adding zero-range\ncharge-symmetry-breaking and charge-independence-breaking terms, and the\ncorresponding energy density functional is derived. It is shown that the\nextended model accounts for experimental values of mirror and triplet\ndisplacement energies (MDEs and TDEs) in sd-shell isospin triplets with, on\naverage, about 100~keV precision using only two additional adjustable coupling\nconstants. Moreover, the model is able to reproduce, for the first time, the\nA=4n versus A=4n+2 staggering of the TDEs.\n", "  The direct writing using a focused electron beam allows for fabricating truly\nthree-dimensional structures of sub-wavelength dimensions in the visible\nspectral regime. The resulting sophisticated geometries are perfectly suited\nfor studying light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. Their overall optical\nresponse will strongly depend not only on geometry but also on the optical\nproperties of the deposited material. In case of the typically used\nmetal-organic precursors, the deposits show a substructure of metallic\nnanocrystals embedded in a carbonaceous matrix. Since gold-containing precursor\nmedia are especially interesting for optical applications, we experimentally\ndetermine the effective permittivity of such an effective material. Our\nexperiment is based on spectroscopic measurements of planar deposits. The\nretrieved permittivity shows a systematic dependence on the gold particle\ndensity and cannot be sufficiently described using the common Maxwell-Garnett\napproach for effective medium.\n", "  Dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) has been successfully derived and\napplied to describe on the one hand passive colloidal suspensions, including\nhydrodynamic interactions between individual particles. On the other hand,\nactive \"dry\" crowds of self-propelled particles have been characterized using\nDDFT. Here we go one essential step further and combine these two approaches.\nWe establish a DDFT for active microswimmer suspensions. For this purpose,\nsimple minimal model microswimmers are introduced. These microswimmers\nself-propel by setting the surrounding fluid into motion. They hydrodynamically\ninteract with each other through their actively self-induced fluid flows and\nvia the common \"passive\" hydrodynamic interactions. An effective soft steric\nrepulsion is also taken into account. We derive the DDFT starting from common\nstatistical approaches. Our DDFT is then tested and applied by characterizing a\nsuspension of microswimmers the motion of which is restricted to a plane within\na three-dimensional bulk fluid. Moreover, the swimmers are confined by a\nradially symmetric trapping potential. In certain parameter ranges, we find\nrotational symmetry breaking in combination with the formation of a\n\"hydrodynamic pumping state\", which has previously been observed in the\nliterature as a result of particle-based simulations. An additional instability\nof this pumping state is revealed.\n", "  The form of the wave function at three-electron coalescence points is\nexamined for several spin states using an alternative method to the usual Fock\nexpansion. We find that, in two- and three-dimensional systems, the\nnon-analytical nature of the wave function is characterized by the appearance\nof logarithmic terms, reminiscent of those that appear as both electrons\napproach the nucleus of the helium atom. The explicit form of these\nsingularities is given in terms of the interelectronic distances for a doublet\nand two quartet states of three electrons in a harmonic well.\n", "  We propose that wave propagation through a class of mechanical metamaterials\nopens unprecedented avenues in seismic wave protection based on spectral\nproperties of auxetic-like metamaterials. The elastic parameters of these\nmetamaterials like the bulk and shear moduli, the mass density, and even the\nPoisson ratio, can exhibit negative values in elastic stop bands. We show here\nthat the propagation of seismic waves with frequencies ranging from 1Hz to 40Hz\ncan be influenced by a decameter scale version of auxetic-like metamaterials\nburied in the soil, with the combined effects of impedance mismatch, local\nresonances and Bragg stop bands. More precisely, we numerically examine and\nillustrate the markedly different behaviors between the propagation of seismic\nwaves through a homogeneous isotropic elastic medium (concrete) and an\nauxetic-like metamaterial plate consisting of 64 cells (40mx40mx40m), utilized\nhere as a foundation of a building one would like to protect from seismic site\neffects. This novel class of seismic metamaterials opens band gaps at\nfrequencies compatible with seismic waves when they are designed appropriately,\nwhat makes them interesting candidates for seismic isolation structures.\n", "  We investigate the intermediate permutational symmetries of a system of\nqubits, that lie in between the perfect symmetric and antisymmetric cases. We\nprove that, on average, pure states of qubits picked at random with respect to\nthe uniform measure on the unit sphere of the Hilbert space are almost as\nantisymmetric as they are allowed to be. We then observe that multipartite\nentanglement, measured by the generalized Meyer- Wallach measure, tends to be\nlarger in subspaces that are more antisymmetric than the complete symmetric\none. Eventually, we prove that all states contained in the most antisymmetric\nsubspace are relevant multipartite entangled states in the sense that their\n1-qubit reduced states are all maximally mixed.\n", "  The new frontier in the quest for the highest contrast levels in the focal\nplane of a coronagraph is now the correction of the large diffractive artifacts\neffects introduced at the science camera by apertures of increasing complexity.\nThe coronagraph for the WFIRST/AFTA mission will be the first of such\ninstruments in space with a two Deformable Mirrors wavefront control system.\nRegardless of the control algorithm for these multi Deformable Mirrors, they\nwill have to rely on quick and accurate simulation of the propagation effects\nintroduced by the out-of-pupil surface. In the first part of this paper, we\npresent the analytical description of the different approximations to simulate\nthese propagation effects. In Annex A, we prove analytically that, in the\nspecial case of surfaces inducing a converging beam, the Fresnel method yields\nhigh fidelity for simulations of these effects. We provide numerical\nsimulations showing this effect. In the second part, we use these tools in the\nframework of the Active Compensation of Aperture Discontinuities technique\n(ACAD) applied to pupil geometries similar to WFIRST-AFTA. We present these\nsimulations in the context of the optical layout of the High-contrast imager\nfor Complex Aperture Telescopes, which will test ACAD on a optical bench. The\nresults of this analysis show that using the ACAD method, an apodized pupil\nlyot coronagraph and the performance of our current deformable mirrors, we are\nable to obtain, in numerically simulations, a dark hole with an AFTA-like\npupil. Our numerical simulation shows that we can obtain contrast better than\n$2.10^{-9}$ in monochromatic light and better than 3.e-8 with 10% bandwidth\nbetween 5 and 14 lambda/D.\n", "  Sediment deposits are the only leftover records from paleo tsunami events.\nTherefore, inverse modeling method based on the information contained in the\ndeposit is an indispensable way of deciphering the quantitative characteristics\nof the tsunamis, e.g., the flow speed and the flow depth. While several models\nhave been proposed to perform tsunami inversion, i.e., to infer the tsunami\ncharacteristics based on the sediment deposits, the existing methods lack\nmathematical rigorousness and are not able to account for uncertainties in the\ninferred quantities. In this work, we propose an inversion scheme based on\nEnsemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) to infer tsunami characteristics from sediment\ndeposits. In contrast to traditional data assimilation methods using EnKF, a\nnovelty of the current work is that we augment the system state to include both\nthe physical variables (sediment fluxes) that are observable and the unknown\nparameters (flow speed and flow depth) to be inferred. Based on the rigorous\nBayesian inference theory, the inversion scheme provides quantified\nuncertainties on the inferred quantities, which clearly distinguishes the\npresent method with existing schemes for tsunami inversion. Two test cases with\nsynthetic observation data are used to verify the proposed inversion scheme.\nNumerical results show that the tsunami characteristics inferred from the\nsediment deposit information have a favorable agreement with the truths, which\ndemonstrated the merits of the proposed tsunami inversion scheme.\n", "  Deviations of the top electroweak couplings from their Standard Model values\nimply that certain amplitudes for the scattering of third generation fermions\nand longitudinally polarized vector bosons or Higgses diverge quadratically\nwith momenta. This high-energy growth is a genuine signal of models where the\ntop quark is strongly coupled to the sector responsible for electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. We propose to profit from the high energies accessible at\nthe LHC to enhance the sensitivity to non-standard top-$Z$ couplings, which are\ncurrently very weakly constrained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the\napproach, we perform a detailed analysis of $tW \\to tW$ scattering, which can\nbe probed at the LHC via $pp\\to t\\bar{t}Wj$. By recasting a CMS analysis at 8\nTeV, we derive the strongest direct bounds to date on the $Ztt$ couplings. We\nalso design a dedicated search at 13 TeV that exploits the distinctive features\nof the $t\\bar{t}Wj$ signal. Finally, we present other scattering processes in\nthe same class that could provide further tests of the top-Higgs sector.\n", "  Na I D absorbing systems toward Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been\nintensively studied over the last decade with the aim of finding circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), which is an indirect probe of the progenitor system. However,\nit is difficult to deconvolve CSM components from non-variable, and often\ndominant, components created by interstellar material (ISM). We present a\nseries of high-resolution spectra of SN Ia 2014J from before maximum brightness\nto ~250 days after maximum brightness. The late-time spectrum provides unique\ninformation for determining the origin of the Na I D absorption systems. The\ndeep late-time observation allows us to probe the environment around the SN at\na large scale, extending to ~40 pc. We find that a spectrum of diffuse light in\nthe vicinity, but not directly in the line-of-sight, of the SN has absorbing\nsystems nearly identical to those obtained for the \"pure\" SN line-of-sight.\nTherefore, basically all Na I D systems seen toward SN 2014J must originate\nfrom foreground material that extends to at least ~40 pc in projection and none\nat the CSM scale. A fluctuation in the column densities at a scale of ~20 pc is\nalso identified. After subtracting the diffuse, \"background\" spectrum, the\nlate-time SN Na I D profile along the SN line-of-sight is consistent with the\nprofile in the near-maximum brightness spectra. The lack of variability on a ~1\nyear timescale is consistent with the ISM interpretation for the gas.\n", "  In this paper we use our recently generalized black hole entropy formula to\npropose a quantum version of the Friedmann equations. In particular, starting\nfrom the differential version of the first law of thermodynamics, we are able\nto find planckian (non commutative) corrections to the Friedmann flat\nequations. The so modified equations are formally similar to the ones present\nin Gauss-Bonnet gravity, but in the ordinary 3+1 dimensions. As a consequence\nof these corrections, by considering negative fluctuations in the internal\nenergy that are allowed by quantum field theory, our equations imply a maximum\nvalue both for the energy density $\\rho$ and for the Hubble flow $H$, i.e. the\nbig bang is ruled out. Conversely, by considering positive quantum\nfluctuations, we found no maximum for $\\rho$ and $H$. Nevertheless, by starting\nwith an early time energy density $\\rho\\sim 1/t^2$, we obtain a value for the\nscale factor $a(t)\\sim e^{\\sqrt{t}}$, implying a finite planckian universe at\n$t=0$, i.e. the point-like big bang singularity is substituted by a universe of\nplanckian size at $t=0$. Finally, we found possible higher order planckian\nterms to our equations together with the related corrections of our generalized\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  The pulse profile of PSR B1133+16 is usually regarded as a conal-double\nstructure. However, its multifrequency profiles cannot simply be fitted with\ntwo Gaussian functions, and a third component is always needed to fit the\nbridge region (between two peaks). This would introduce additional, redundant\nparameters. In this paper, through a comparison of five fitting functions\n(Gaussian, von Mises, hyperbolic secant, square hyperbolic secant, and\nLorentz), it is found that the square hyperbolic secant function can best\nreproduce the profile, yielding an improved fit. Moreover, a symmetric 2D\nradiation beam function, instead of a simple 1D Gaussian function, is used to\nfit the profile. Each profile with either well-resolved or not-so-well-resolved\npeaks could be fitted adequately using this beam function, and the bridge\nemission between the two peaks does not need to be a new component. Adopting\ninclination and impact angles based on polarization measurements, the opening\nangle ({\\theta}_{\\mu}0) of the radiation beam in a certain frequency band is\nderived from beam-function fitting. The corresponding radiation altitudes are\nthen calculated. Based on multi-frequency profiles, we also computed the\nLorentz factors of the particles and their dispersion at those locations in\nboth the curvature-radiation (CR) and inverse-Compton-scattering (ICS) models.\nWe found that the Lorentz factors of the particles decrease rapidly as the\nradiation altitude increases. Besides, the radiation prefers to be generated in\nannular region rather than core region, and this needs further validation.\n", "  The tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole leads to a\nshort-lived thermal flare. Despite extensive searches, radio follow-up\nobservations of known thermal stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) have not\nyet produced a conclusive detection. We present a detection of variable radio\nemission from a thermal TDF, which we interpret as originating from a\nnewly-launched jet. The multi-wavelength properties of the source present a\nnatural analogy with accretion state changes of stellar mass black holes,\nsuggesting all TDFs could be accompanied by a jet. In the rest frame of the\nTDF, our radio observations are an order of magnitude more sensitive than\nnearly all previous upper limits, explaining how these jets, if common, could\nthus far have escaped detection.\n", "  Using three-dimensional stellar kinematic data from simulated galaxies, we\nexamine the efficacy of a Jeans equation analysis in reconstructing the total\ndisk surface density, including the dark matter, at the \"Solar\" radius. Our\nsimulation dataset includes galaxies formed in a cosmological context using\nstate-of-the-art high resolution cosmological zoom simulations, and other\nidealised models. The cosmologically formed galaxies have been demonstrated to\nlie on many of the observed scaling relations for late-type spirals, and thus\noffer an interesting surrogate for real galaxies with the obvious advantage\nthat all the kinematical data are known perfectly. We show that the vertical\nvelocity dispersion is typically the dominant kinematic quantity in the\nanalysis, and that the traditional method of using only the vertical force is\nreasonably effective at low heights above the disk plane. At higher heights the\ninclusion of the radial force becomes increasingly important. We also show that\nthe method is sensitive to uncertainties in the measured disk parameters,\nparticularly the scale lengths of the assumed double exponential density\ndistribution, and the scale length of the radial velocity dispersion. In\naddition, we show that disk structure and low number statistics can lead to\nsignificant errors in the calculated surface densities. Finally we examine the\nimplications of our results for previous studies of this sort, suggesting that\nmore accurate measurements of the scale lengths may help reconcile conflicting\nestimates of the local dark matter density in the literature.\n", "  We present an analysis of the impact of bars and bulges on the radial\ndistributions of the different types of supernovae (SNe) in the stellar discs\nof host galaxies with various morphologies. We use a well-defined sample of 500\nnearby (< 100 Mpc) SNe and their low-inclined (i < 60 deg) and morphologically\nnon-disturbed S0-Sm host galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find\nthat in Sa-Sm galaxies, all core-collapse (CC) and vast majority of SNe Ia\nbelong to the disc, rather than the bulge component. The radial distribution of\nSNe Ia in S0-S0/a galaxies is inconsistent with their distribution in Sa-Sm\nhosts, which is probably due to the contribution of the outer bulge SNe Ia in\nS0-S0/a galaxies. In Sa-Sbc galaxies, the radial distribution of CC SNe in\nbarred hosts is inconsistent with that in unbarred ones, while the\ndistributions of SNe Ia are not significantly different. At the same time, the\nradial distributions of both types of SNe in Sc-Sm galaxies are not affected by\nbars. We propose that the additional mechanism shaping the distributions of\nType Ia and CC SNe can be explained within the framework of substantial\nsuppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars,\nparticularly in early-type spirals. The radial distribution of CC SNe in\nunbarred Sa-Sbc galaxies is more centrally peaked and inconsistent with that in\nunbarred Sc-Sm hosts, while the distribution of SNe Ia in unbarred galaxies is\nnot affected by host morphology. These results can be explained by the distinct\ndistributions of massive stars in the discs of early- and late-type spirals.\n", "  We present a grid on non-linear convective type-II Cepheid models. The dense\nmodel grids are computed for 0.6M_Sun and a range of metallicities\n([Fe/H]=-2.0,-1.5,-1.0), and for 0.8M_Sun ([Fe/H]=-1.5). Two sets of convective\nparameters are considered. The models cover the full temperature extent of the\nclassical instability strip, but are limited in luminosity; for the most\nluminous models violent pulsation leads to the decoupling of the outermost\nmodel shell. Hence, our survey reaches only the shortest period RV Tau domain.\n  In the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram we detect two domains in which period\ndoubled pulsation is possible. The first extends through the BL Her domain and\nlow luminosity W Vir domain (pulsation periods ~2-6.5 d). The second domain\nextends at higher luminosities (W Vir domain; periods >9.5d). Some models\nwithin these domains display period-4 pulsation. We also detect very narrow\ndomains (~10 K wide) in which modulation of pulsation is possible. Another\ninteresting phenomenon we detect is double-mode pulsation in the fundamental\nmode and in the fourth radial overtone. Fourth overtone is a surface mode,\ntrapped in the outer model layers. Single-mode pulsation in the fourth overtone\nis also possible on the hot side of the classical instability strip. The origin\nof the above phenomena is discussed. In particular, the role of resonances in\ndriving different pulsation dynamics as well as in shaping the morphology of\nthe radius variation curves is analysed.\n", "  We investigate the galaxy population in simulated proto-cluster regions using\na semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, coupled to merger trees extracted\nfrom N-body simulations. We select the most massive clusters at redshift $z=0$\nfrom our set of simulations, and follow their main progenitors back in time.\nThe analysis shows that proto-cluster regions are dominated by central galaxies\nand their number decreases with time as many become satellites, clustering\naround the central object. In agreement with observations, we find an\nincreasing velocity dispersion with cosmic time, the increase being faster for\nsatellites. The analysis shows that proto-clusters are very extended regions,\n$\\gtrsim 20 \\, Mpc$ at $z \\gtrsim 1$. The fraction of galaxies in proto-cluster\nregions that are not progenitor of cluster galaxies varies with redshift,\nstellar mass and area considered. It is about 20-30 per cent for galaxies with\nstellar mass $\\sim 10^9\\,{\\rm M}_{\\sun}$, while negligible for the most massive\ngalaxies considered. Nevertheless, these objects have properties similar to\nthose of progenitors. We investigate the building-up of the passive-sequence in\nclusters, and find that their progenitors are on average always active at any\nredshift of interest of proto-clusters. The main mechanism which quenches their\nstar formation is the removal of the hot gas reservoir at the time of\naccretion. The later galaxies are accreted (become satellite), and the more the\ncold gas available, the longer the time spent as active. Central galaxies are\nactive over all redshift range considered, although a non-negligible fraction\nof them become passive at redshift $z<1$, due to strong feedback from Active\nGalactic Nuclei.\n", "  The functionality of many biological systems depends on reliable electron\ntransfer with minimal heating. Unlike man-made electric circuits, nature\nrealizes electron transport via insulating chiral molecules. Here we include\nspin into the analysis of tunneling through these molecules, and demonstrate\nits importance for efficient transport. We show that the helical geometry\ninduces robust spin filtering accompanied by, and intimately related to,\nstrongly enhanced transmission. Thus, we resolve two key questions posed by\ntransport measurements through organic molecules, demonstrating their common\norigin.\n", "  In this article we review recent progress on the holographic modelling of\nfield theories with Lifshitz symmetry. We focus in particular on the\nholographic dictionary for Lifshitz backgrounds - the relationship between bulk\nfields and boundary operators, operator correlation functions and underlying\ngeometrical structure. The holographic dictionary is essential in identifying\nthe universality class of strongly coupled Lifshitz theories described by\ngravitational models.\n", "  The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in many rare earth (RE) based intermetallic\ncompounds has been extensively investigated during last two decades, not only\ndue to their potential applications for magnetic refrigeration but also for\nbetter understanding of the fundamental problems of the materials. This paper\nreviews our recent progress of magnetic properties and MCE in some binary or\nternary intermetallic compounds of RE with low boiling point metal(s) (Zn, Mg,\nand Cd). Some of them are exhibiting promising MCE properties which make them\nalso attractive for low temperature magnetic refrigeration. Characteristics of\nthe magnetic transition, origin of large MCE as well as the potential\napplication of these compounds were thoroughly discussed. Additionally, a brief\nreview of the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties in the quaternary rare\nearth nickel boroncarbides RENi2B2C superconductors is also presented.\n", "  We present a dynamical study of the effect of the bar and spiral arms on the\nsimulated orbits of open clusters in the Galaxy. Specifically, this work is\ndevoted to the puzzling presence of high-altitude open clusters in the Galaxy.\nFor this purpose we employ a very detailed observationally motivated potential\nmodel for the Milky Way and a careful set of initial conditions representing\nthe newly born open clusters in the thin disk. We find that the spiral arms are\nable to raise an important percentage of open clusters (about one-sixth of the\ntotal employed in our simulations, depending on the structural parameters of\nthe arms) above the Galactic plane to heights beyond 200 pc, producing a\nbulge-shaped structure toward the center of the Galaxy. Contrary to what was\nexpected, the spiral arms produce a much greater vertical effect on the\nclusters than the bar, both in quantity and height; this is due to the sharper\nconcentration of the mass on the spiral arms, when compared to the bar. When a\nbar and spiral arms are included, spiral arms are still capable of raising an\nimportant percentage of the simulated open clusters through chaotic diffusion\n(as tested from classification analysis of the resultant high-z orbits), but\nthe bar seems to restrain them, diminishing the elevation above the plane by a\nfactor of about two.\n", "  A novel cesium (Cs) two-color magneto-optical trap (TC-MOT), which partially\nemploys the optical radiation forces due to photon scattering of the 6P3/2\n(F'=5) - 7S1/2 (F\"=4) excited-state transition in the Cs 6S1/2 - 6P3/2 - 7S1/2\n(852 + 1470 nm) ladder-type system, has been proposed and experimentally\ninvestigated. One of the three pairs of 852 nm cooling/trapping beams (CTBs) in\na conventional Cs MOT is replaced with a pair of the 1470 nm CTBs (type-I) or\nwith one 852 nm CTB plus another counter-propagating 1470 nm CTB (type-II).\nBoth the type-I and type-II Cs TC-MOTs can cool and trap atoms on both the red-\nand blue-detuning sides of the two-photon resonance. The Cs TC-MOT demonstrated\nin this work may have applications in the background-free detection of cooled\nand trapped atoms, and the photon-pair sources compatible with the\nensemble-based quantum memory and the long-distance quantum communication via\noptical fiber.\n", "  Hand-hygiene compliance and contacts of health-care workers largely determine\nthe potential paths of pathogen transmission in hospital wards. We explored how\nthe combination of data collected by two automated infrastructures based on\nwearable sensors and recording (i) use of hydro-alcoholic solution and (ii)\ncontacts of health-care workers provide an enhanced view of the risk of\ntransmission events in the ward. We perform a proof-of-concept observational\nstudy. Detailed data on contact patterns and hand-hygiene compliance of\nhealth-care workers were collected by wearable sensors over 12 days in an\ninfectious disease unit of a hospital in Marseilles, France. 10837 contact\nevents among 10 doctors, 4 nurses, 4 nurses' aids and 4 housekeeping staff were\nrecorded during the study. Most contacts took place among medical doctors.\nAggregate contact durations were highly heterogeneous and the resulting contact\nnetwork was highly structured. 510 visits of health-care workers to patients'\nrooms were recorded, with a low rate of hand-hygiene compliance. Both data sets\nwere used to construct histories and statistics of contacts informed by the use\nof hydro-alcoholic solution, or lack thereof, of the involved health-care\nworkers. Hand-hygiene compliance data strongly enrich the information\nconcerning contacts among health-care workers, by assigning a 'safe' or\n'at-risk' value to each contact. The global contact network can thus be divided\ninto 'at-risk' and 'safe' contact networks. The combined data could be of high\nrelevance for outbreak investigation and to inform data-driven models of\nnosocomial disease spread.\n", "  We demonstrate that, in the context of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, it is in\nprinciple possible to measure the value of the cosmological constant by\ntracing, across cosmic time, the evolution of the turnaround radius of cosmic\nstructures. The novelty of the presented method is that it is local, in the\nsense that it uses the effect of the cosmological constant on the relatively\nshort scales of cosmic structures and not on the dynamics of the Universe at\nits largest scales. In this way, it can provide an important consistency check\nfor the standard cosmological model and can give signs of new physics, beyond\n$\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss the four-loop relation between the on-shell\nand $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ definition of heavy quark masses which is applied to the\ntop, bottom and charm case. We also present relations between the $\\bar{\\rm\nMS}$ quark mass and various threshold mass definitions and discuss the\nuncertainty at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order.\n", "  In this work we describe a scheme to perform a continuous over time quantum\nnon demolition (QND) mea- surement of the number of phonons of a\nnanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). Our scheme also allows us to describe the\nstatistics of the number of phonons.\n", "  We present the results of a survey for intervening 21cm HI absorption in a\nsample of 10 nearby, gas-rich galaxies selected from the HI Parkes All-Sky\nSurvey (HIPASS). This follows the six HIPASS galaxies searched in previous work\nand completes our full sample. In this paper we searched for absorption along\n17 sightlines with impact parameters between 6 and 46 kpc, making one new\ndetection. We also obtained simultaneous HI emission-line data, allowing us to\ndirectly relate the absorption-line detection rate to the HI distribution. From\nthis we find the majority of the non-detections in the current sample are\nbecause sightline does not intersect the HI disc of the galaxy at sufficiently\nhigh column density, but that source structure is also an important factor.\n  The detected absorption-line arises in the galaxy NGC 5156 ($z = 0.01$) at an\nimpact parameter of 19 kpc. The line is deep and narrow with an integrated\noptical depth of 0.82 km s$^{-1}$. High resolution Australia Telescope Compact\nArray (ATCA) images at 5 and 8 GHz reveal that the background source is\nresolved into two components with a separation of 2.6 arcsec (500 pc at the\nredshift of the galaxy), with the absorption likely occurring against a single\ncomponent. We estimate that the ratio of the spin temperature and covering\nfactor, $T_{\\mathrm{S}}/f$, is approximately 950 K in the outer disc of NGC\n5156, but further observations using VLBI would allow us to accurately measure\nthe covering factor and spin temperature of the gas.\n", "  This talk presents results from the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations from\nsearches for physics beyond the Standard Model motivated by supersymmetry from\nRun 1 of the LHC. Representative searches are described to illustrate the\ndiverse nature of the search program in both background estimation techniques\nand final state topologies. The status of preparation for Run 2 searches at 13\nTeV is also presented.\n", "  The anisotropy study cosmic microwave background (CMB) is one of the main\nobservational tools for modern cosmology. However, alongside the study of the\nthermal fluctuations of the CMB are other equally important information, which\nis known as the polarization of the CMB. The inflationary model predicts that\nthe CMB is linearly polarized and the physical mechanism of this polarization\nis studied from the Thompson scattering, the dominant process on the surface of\nlast scattering. There are basically two types of polarization called E and B\nmodes, the first produced by scalar perturbations and the latter by tensor\nperturbations, such as those due to gravitational waves in the primordial\nuniverse. So if we are able to measure these types of polarization will have an\nentry to the study of the inflationary epoch. This paper presents the main\nphysical mechanisms that support theoretically the polarization of the CMB due\nto primordial gravitational waves (PGW) and the revision of the main\nobservables, grouped in so-called Stokes parameters (Q, U, I), Which brings us\ninformation to achieve the contrast the angular power spectrum produced by the\npolarization of the CMB, which shows to be in excellent agreement with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  There are no known examples of magnetic white dwarfs with fields larger than\nabout 3MG paired with a non-degenerate companion in detached binary systems.\nThe suggestion is that highly magnetic, isolated white dwarfs may originate\nfrom stars that coalesce during common envelope evolution while those stars\nthat emerge from a common envelope on a close orbit may evolve into double\ndegenerate systems consisting of two white dwarfs, one or both magnetic.\n  The presence of planets or planetary debris around white dwarfs is also a new\nand exciting area of research that may give us important clues on the formation\nof first and second generation planetary systems, since these place unique\nsignatures in the spectra of white dwarfs.\n", "  Solar limb observations sometimes reveal the presence of a satellite lobe in\nthe blue wing of the Stokes I profile from pixels belonging to granules. The\npresence of this satellite lobe has been associated in the past to strong line\nof sight gradients and, as the line of sight component is almost parallel to\nthe solar surface, to horizontal granular flows. We aim to increase the\nknowledge about these horizontal flows studying a spectropolarimetric\nobservation of the north solar pole. We will make use of two state of the art\ntechniques, the spatial deconvolution procedure that increases the quality of\nthe data removing the stray light contamination, and spectropolarimetric\ninversions that will provide the vertical stratification of the atmospheric\nphysical parameters where the observed spectral lines form. We inverted the\nStokes profiles using a two component configuration, obtaining that one\ncomponent is strongly blueshifted and displays a temperature enhancement at\nupper photospheric layers while the second component has low redshifted\nvelocities and it is cool at upper layers. In addition, we examined a large\nnumber of cases located at different heliocentric angles, finding smaller\nvelocities as we move from the centre to the edge of the granule. Moreover, the\nheight location of the enhancement on the temperature stratification of the\nblueshifted component also evolves with the spatial location on the granule\nbeing positioned on lower heights as we move to the periphery of the granular\nstructure.\n", "  A scenario of an emergent universe is constructed in the background of an\ninhomogeneous space-time model which is asymptotically (at spatial infinity)\nFRW space-time. The cosmic substratum consists of non-interacting two\ncomponents, namely {\\bf a)} homogeneous and isotropic fluid but dissipative in\nnature and {\\bf b)} an inhomogeneous and anisotropic barotropic fluid. In\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamic prescription (second order deviations), particle\ncreation mechanism is considered the cause for the dissipative phenomena. It is\nfound that for constant value of the particle creation rate parameter there\nexists a scenario of emergent universe.\n", "  Semiconductor surfaces with narrow surface bands provide unique playgrounds\nto search for Mott-insulating state. Recently, a combined experimental and\ntheoretical study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 247602 (2015)] of the two-dimensional\n(2D) Sn atom lattice on a wide-gap SiC(0001) substrate proposed a Mott-type\ninsulator driven by strong on-site Coulomb repulsion U. Our systematic\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) study with local, semilocal, and hybrid\nexchange-correlation functionals shows that the Sn dangling-bond state largely\nhybridizes with the substrate Si 3p and C 2p states to split into three surface\nbands due to the crystal field. Such a hybridization gives rise to the\nstabilization of the antiferromagnetic order via superexchange interactions.\nThe band gap and the density of states predicted by the hybrid DFT calculation\nagree well with photoemission data. Our findings not only suggest that the\nSn/SiC(0001) system can be represented as a Slater-type insulator driven by\nlong-range magnetism, but also have an implication that taking into account\nlong-range interactions beyond the on-site interaction would be of importance\nfor properly describing the insulating nature of Sn/SiC(0001).\n", "  Intrinsic time quantum geometrodynamics resolved `the problem of time' and\nbridged the deep divide between quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity\nwith a Schrodinger equation which describes evolution in intrinsic time\nvariable. In this formalism, Einstein's general relativity is a particular\nrealization of a wider class of theories. Explicit classical black hole and\ncosmological solutions and the motion of test particles are derived and\nanalyzed in this work in the context of constant three-curvature solutions in\nintrinsic time geometrodynamics; and we exemplify how this formalism yields\nresults which agree with the predictions of Einstein's theory.\n", "  A new set of fundamental commutation relations for quantum gravity is\npresented. The basic variables are the eight components of the unimodular part\nof the spatial dreibein and eight SU(3) generators which correspond to\nKlauder's momentric variables. The commutation relations are not canonical, but\nthey have well defined group theoretical meanings. All fundamental entities are\ndimensionless; and quantum wave functionals are preferentially selected to be\nin the dreibein representation.\n", "  We discuss an idea whether spherical blast waves can amplify by a non-local\nresonant hydrodynamic mechanism inhomogeneities formed by turbulence or phase\nsegregation in the interstellar medium. We consider the problem of a\nblast-wave-turbulence interaction in the Linear Interaction Approximation.\nMathematically, this is an eigenvalue problem for finding the structure and\namplitude of eigenfunctions describing the response of the shock-wave flow to\nforced oscillations by external perturbations in the ambient interstellar\nmedium. Linear analysis shows that the blast wave can amplify density and\nvorticity perturbations for a wide range of length scales with amplification\ncoefficients of up to 20, with amplification the greater, the larger the\nlength. There also exist resonant harmonics for which the gain becomes formally\ninfinite in the linear approximation. Their orbital wavenumbers are within the\nrange of macro- ($l \\sim 1$), meso- ($l \\sim 20$) and microscopic ($l > 200$)\nscales. Since the resonance width is narrow: typically, $\\Delta l <1$,\nresonance should select and amplify discrete isolated harmonics. We speculate\nas to a possible explanation of an observed regular filamentary structure of\nregular-shaped round supernova remnants such as SNR 1572, 1006 or 0509-67.5.\nResonant mesoscales found ($l \\approx 18 $) are surprisingly close to the\nobserved scales ($l \\approx 15$) of ripples in the shell's surface of SNR\n0509-67.5.\n", "  Within the Dirac- and Lorentz-bubble potential models an electronic structure\nof the doubly-charged negative ion has been studied by a variational method. It\nis shown that even in the first approximation of this method when a trial wave\nfunction of the two electrons is represented as a product of one-electron\nfunctions the total energy of the system is negative, a manifestation of the\nexistence of a stable state of the doubly-charged negative ion in these models.\nThe second electron affinity of C60 according to estimation is about 1 eV. The\nphotodetachment cross sections of this ion have been calculated as well. Near\nthreshold behavior of cross section is found to exhibit peculiar and\ninteresting behavior. The first cross section accompanied by the transformation\nof the doubly-charged negative ion into a singly-charged one is exponentially\nsmall near the process threshold. The second cross section corresponds to the\nphotodetachment of a singly-charged ion; it increases at the threshold as a\npower function of the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. These cross sections\nare of the same order as the photodetachment cross sections of atomic ions with\nthe same electron affinity.

The fibre's attenuation was 11.0 dB/km at\n1550 nm wavelength, the match between the fibre's mode and the ideal infinite\nAiry pattern was 93.7%, and the far field resembled a top-hat beam. The\nguidance mechanism has strong similarities to photonic bandgap guidance.\n", "  The spatial distribution of electric charges forming a square well potential\nhas been analyzed. It is shown that this potential is created by two concentric\nspheres with a double layer of charges. A C60 shell potential has been\ncalculated under the assumption that it is formed by the averaged charge\ndensity of a neutral atom. It is further demonstrated that the phenomenological\npotentials simulating the C60 shell potential belong to a family of potentials\nwith a non-flat bottom. Two possible types of C60 model potentials are proposed\nand their parameters have been calculated.

The physical examples discussed\nhere are standard position and momentum, number and angle, finite qudit\nsystems, and strings of qubits for quantum information applications. The\nuncertainty relations allow an arbitrary choice of metric for the distance of\noutcomes, and the choice of an exponent distinguishing e.g., absolute or root\nmean square deviations. The emphasis of the article is on developing a unified\ntreatment, in which one observable takes values in an arbitrary locally compact\nabelian group and the other in the dual group. In all cases the phase space\nsymmetry implies the equality of measurement uncertainty bounds and preparation\nuncertainty bounds, and there is a straightforward method for determining the\noptimal bounds.\n", "  Because of a luminosity of up to five orders of magnitude larger than at LEP,\nelectroweak precision measurements at the FCC-ee -- the Future Circular\nCollider with electron-positron beams -- would provide improvements by orders\nof magnitude over the present status and constitute a broad search for the\nexistence of new, weakly interacting particles up to very high energy scales.\nThe FCC-ee will address centre-of-mass energies ranging from below the Z pole\nto the $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ threshold and above. At energies around the Z pole,\nthe Z-boson mass and width can be measured to better than 100 keV each.\nAsymmetry measurements at the Z pole allow improvements in the determination of\nthe weak mixing angle by at least a factor 30 to\n$\\delta\\sin^2\\theta\\mathrm{_W^{eff}}\\simeq 6\\times 10^{-6}$. A determination of\nthe electromagnetic coupling constant at the Z energy scale,\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{QED}(m_\\mathrm{Z}^2)$, to a relative precision of $3\\times\n10^{-5}$ can be obtained via measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry of\nlepton pairs at two energy points $\\pm 3.2\\,\\textrm{GeV}$ away from the Z peak.\nAt energies around the WW threshold, high-statistic cross section measurements\ncan provide a determination of the W mass to 300 keV. The key breakthrough\nadvantage of the FCC-ee in these achievements, beside the large luminosity, is\nthe possibility of a continous, precise determination of the beam energy by\nresonant depolarization at the Z peak and at the WW threshold. Precise\nmeasurements of the hadronic branching fractions of the Z and W bosons allow\nfor considerably improvements in the determination of the strong coupling\nconstant down to a precision of $\\delta\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}(m_\\mathrm{Z}^2)\\simeq\n0.0001$. An energy scan around the 350 GeV $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ threshold allows\na 10 MeV measurement of the top-quark mass.\n", "  It is frequently observed that even at very low temperatures the number of\nquasiparticles in superconducting materials is higher than predicted by\nstandard BCS-theory. These quasiparticles can interact with two-level systems,\nsuch as superconducting qubits or two-level systems (TLS) in the amorphous\noxide layer of a Josephson junction. This interaction leads to decay and\ndecoherence of the TLS, with specific results, such as the time dependence,\ndepending on the distribution of quasiparticles and the form of the\ninteraction. We study the resulting decay laws for different experimentally\nrelevant protocols.\n", "  Self-similar dynamical processes are characterized by a growing length scale\n$\\xi$ which increases with time as $\\xi \\sim t^{1/z}$, where z is the dynamical\nexponent. The best known example is a simple random walk with z=2. Usually such\nprocesses are assumed to take place on a static background. In this paper we\naddress the question what changes if the background itself evolves dynamically.\nAs an example we consider a random walk on an isotropically and homogeneously\ninflating space. For an exponentially fast expansion it turns out that the\nself-similar properties of the random walk are destroyed. For an inflation with\npower-law characteristics, however, self-similarity is preserved provided that\nthe exponent controlling the growth is small enough. The resulting probability\ndistribution is analyzed in terms of cumulant ratios. Moreover, the dynamical\nexponent z is found to change continuously with the control exponent.\n", "  We address the question of how to compute the probability distribution of the\ntime at which a detector clicks, in the situation of $n$ non-relativistic\nquantum particles in a volume $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ in physical space\nand detectors placed along the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ of $\\Omega$. We have\nrecently [http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03715] argued in favor of a rule for the\n1-particle case that involves a Schr\\\"odinger equation with an absorbing\nboundary condition on $\\partial \\Omega$ introduced by Werner; we call this rule\nthe \"absorbing boundary rule.\" Here, we describe the natural extension of the\nabsorbing boundary rule to the $n$-particle case. A key element of this\nextension is that, upon a detection event, the wave function gets collapsed by\ninserting the detected position, at the time of detection, into the wave\nfunction, thus yielding a wave function of $n-1$ particles. We also describe an\nextension of the absorbing boundary rule to the case of moving detectors.\n", "  This paper proves a 30 year old conjecture that disks and annuli are the only\ndomains where analytic content - the uniform distance from $\\bar{z}$ to\nanalytic functions - achieves its lower bound. This problem is closely related\nto several well-known free boundary problems, in particular, Serrin's problem\nabout laminar flow of incompressible viscous fluid for multiply-connected\ndomains, and Garabedian's problem on the shape of electrified droplets. Some\nfurther ramifications and open questions, including extensions to higher\ndimensions, are also discussed.\n", "  Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are versatile tools to manipulate fluids at\nsmall scales for microfluidics and bio- logical applications. A non-exhaustive\nlist of operations that can be performed with SAW includes sessile droplet\ndisplacement, atomization, division and merging but also the actuation of\nfluids embedded in microchannels or the manipulation of suspended particles.\nHowever, each of these operations requires a specific design of the wave\ngeneration system, the so-called interdigitated transducers (IDTs). Depending\non the application, it might indeed be necessary to generate focused or plane,\npropagating or standing, aligned or shifted waves. Furthermore, the\npossibilities offered by more complex wave-fields such as acoustical vortices\nfor particle tweezing and liquid twisting cannot be explored with classical\nIDTs. In this paper, we show that the inverse filter technique coupled with an\ninterdigitated transducers array (IDTA) enables to synthesize all classical\nwave-fields used in microfluidics and biological applications with a single\nmulti- function platform. It also enables to generate swirling SAWs, whose\npotential for the on-chip synthesis of tailored acoustical vortices has been\ndemonstrated lately. The possibilities offered by this platform is illustrated\nby performing successively many operations on sessile droplets with the same\nsystem.\n", "  Recently, the facilities of radioactive ion beam (RIB) combined with advanced\ndetector systems provide us unique opportunity to probe the exotic properties\nof the nuclei with unusual neutron-to-proton ratio. In this article, a study of\ncharacterization of different types of ultra-fast timing detectors: a special\ntype of gas detector (multi-strip multi-gap resistive plate chamber, MMRPC)\n($\\sigma$ $<$100 ps), scintillators array ( viz., $LaBr_3:Ce$) (timing\nresolution ($\\sigma<$250 ps) are being presented. A brief discussion on usage\nof these different types of ultra-fast timing detector systems at radioactive\nion beam facilities is also included.\n", "  Surface and spatial radial density profiles in open clusters are derived\nusing a kernel estimator method. Formulae are obtained for the contribution of\nevery star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density\nprofiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N =\n500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502,\n1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and\nfor different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel\nhalf-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly\ndepend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and\nstructural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force\nfield are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on\nopen-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended\ncorona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function\ncomposed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform\nsphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the\nsurface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce\nsurface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the\ncluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the\nsample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended\nbeyond their tidal surfaces.\n", "  Since the discovery of the $X(3872)$ the study of heavy meson molecules has\nbeen the subject of many investigations. On the experimental side different\nexperiments have looked for its spin partners and the bottom analogs. On the\ntheoretical side different approaches have been used to understand this state.\nSome of them are EFT that impose HQSS and so they make predictions for the\npartners of the $X(3872)$, suggesting the existence of a $J^{PC}=2^{++}$\npartner in the charm sector or $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ or $2^{++}$ analogs in the\nbottom.\n  In our work, in order to understand the $X(3872)$, we use a Chiral quark\nmodel in which, due to the proximity to the $DD^*$ threshold, we include $c\\bar\nc$ states coupled to $DD^*$ molecular components. In this coupled channel model\nthe relative position of the bare $c\\bar c$ states with two meson thresholds\nare very important. We have looked for the $X(3872)$ partners and we don't find\na bound state in the $D^*D^*$ $J^{PC}=2^{++}$. In the bottom sector we find the\nopposite situation where the $B^*B^*$ with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$ is bounded while the\n$J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is not bounded. These results shows how the coupling with\n$c\\bar c$ states can induced different results than those expected by HQSS. The\nreason is that this symmetry is worse in the open heavy meson sector than in\nthe hidden heavy meson sector.\n", "  This article reviews our current understanding of modelling convection\ndynamics in stars. Several semi-analytical time-dependent convection models\nhave been proposed for pulsating one-dimensional stellar structures with\ndifferent formulations for how the convective turbulent velocity field couples\nwith the global stellar oscillations. In this review we put emphasis on two,\nwidely used, time-dependent convection formulations for estimating pulsation\nproperties in one-dimensional stellar models. Applications to pulsating stars\nare presented with results for oscillation properties, such as the effects of\nconvection dynamics on the oscillation frequencies, or the stability of\npulsation modes, in classical pulsators and in stars supporting solar-type\noscillations.\n", "  Topological superfluid, new quantum matter that possesses gapless exotic\nexcitations known as Majorana fermions, has attracted extensive attention\nrecently. These excitations, which can encode topological qubits, could be\ncrucial ingredients for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, creating\nand manipulating multiple Majorana fermions remain an ongoing challenge.\nLoading a topologically protected system in multi-layer structures would be a\nnatural and simple way to achieve this goal. Here we investigate the system of\nbilayer Fermi gases with spin-orbit coupling and show that the topological\ncondition is significantly influenced by the inter-layer tunneling, yielding\ntwo novel topological phases, which support more Majorana Fermions. We\ndemonstrate the existence of such novel topological phases and associated\nmultiple Majorana fermions using bilayer Fermi gases trapped inside a harmonic\npotential. This research pave a new way for generating multiple Majorana\nfermions and would be a significant step towards topological quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  Fluidic maldistribution in microscale multichannel devices requires deep\nunderstanding to achieve optimized flow and heat transfer characteristics. A\nthorough computational study has been performed to understand the concentration\nand thermohydraulic maldistribution of nanofluids in parallel microchannel\nsystems using an Eulerian Lagrangian twin phase model. The study reveals that\nnanofluids cannot be treated as homogeneous single phase fluids in such complex\nflow domains and effective property models fail drastically to predict the\nperformance parameters. To comprehend the distribution of the particulate\nphase, a novel concentration maldistribution factor has been proposed. It has\nbeen observed that distribution of particles need not essentially follow the\nflow pattern, leading to higher thermal performance than expected from\nhomogeneous models. Particle maldistribution has been conclusively shown to be\ndue to various migration and diffusive phenomena like Stokesian drag, Brownian\nmotion, thermophoretic drift, etc. The implications of particle distribution on\nthe cooling performance have been illustrated and smart fluid effects (reduced\nmagnitude of maximum temperature) have been observed and a mathematical model\nto predict the enhanced cooling performance in such flow geometries has been\nproposed. The article presents lucidly the effectiveness of discrete phase\napproach in modelling nanofluid thermohydraulics and sheds insight on behavior\nof nanofluids in complex flow domains.\n", "  In this paper the extension of the functional setting customarily adopted in\nGeneral Relativity (GR) is considered. For this purpose, an explicit solution\nof the so-called Einstein's\\ Teleparallel problem is sought. This is achieved\nby a suitable extension of the traditional concept of GR reference frame and is\nbased on the notion of non-local point transformation (NLPT). In particular, it\nis shown that a solution to the said problem can be reached by introducing a\nsuitable subset of transformations denoted here as \\textit{special}\n\\textit{NLPT}. These are found to realize a phase-space transformation\nconnecting\\emph{\\}the flat Minkowski space-time with, in principle, an\narbitrary curved space-time. The functional setting and basic properties of the\nnew transformations are investigated.\n", "  The problem is posed of further extending the axiomatic construction proposed\nin Part 1 for non-local point transformations mapping in each other different\ncurved space times. The new transformations apply to curved space times when\nexpressed in arbitrary coordinate systems. It is shown that the solution\npermits to achieve an ideal (Gedanken) experiment realizing a suitable kind of\nphase-space transformation on point-particle classical dynamical systems.\nApplications of the theory are discussed both for diagonal and non-diagonal\nmetric tensors.\n", "  This paper is motivated by the introduction of a new functional setting of\nGeneral Relativity (GR) based on the adoption of suitable group non-local point\ntransformations (NLPT). Unlike the customary local point transformatyion\nusually utilized in GR, these transformations map in each other intrinsically\ndifferent curved space-times. In this paper the problem is posed of determining\nthe tensor transformation laws holding for the $4-$% acceleration with respect\nto the group of general NLPT. Basic physical implications are considered. These\nconcern in particular the identification of NLPT-acceleration effects, namely\nthe relationship established via general NLPT between the $4-$accelerations\nexisting in different curved-space times. As a further application the tensor\ncharacter of the EM Faraday tensor.with respect to the NLPT-group is\nestablished.\n", "  F-theory in its most general sense should be a theory defined on a\nworldvolume of higher dimension than the worldsheet, that reproduces string\nresults perturbatively but includes nonperturbative supergravity solutions at\nthe first-quantized level. This implies that in some sense it should contain\nthe same oscillator modes as the string but an enlarged set of zero-modes. In\nthis paper we concentrate on the higher-dimensional properties of the\nworldvolume (rather than those of spacetime): \"Ghost\" dimensions are added to\nthe worldvolume, as might be expected in a \"zeroth-quantized\" approach to the\nconstraints on its higher bosonic dimensions, by adding equal numbers of\nbosonic and fermionic dimensions to the worldsheet.\n", "  We relate Zeno's Dichotomy paradox with gravitational red-shift near event\nhorizon in a spherically symmetric space-time. A dictionary of this connection,\nhenceforth called as Zeno-Gravity correspondence, has been built up. The\ninfinite sequence of Zeno's paradox gets mapped to the effect of infinite\ngravitational red-shift near event horizon and the infinite amount of\nco-ordinate time the light/particle takes to reach the horizon, starting from a\nfinite distance away from the horizon. Utilizing the dictionary, we elucidate\nthe concept of gravitational red-shift and co-ordinate chart, not covering the\nwhole manifold in a more transparent student-friendly manner without using\nsophisticated machinery of differential geometry.\n", "  For $J$-hermitian operators on a Krein space $(\\mathcal{K},J)$ satisfying an\nadequate Fredholm property, a global Krein signature is shown to be a homotopy\ninvariant. It is argued that this global signature is a generalization of the\nNoether index. When the Krein space has a supplementary Real structure, the\nsets of $J$-hermitian Fredholm operators with Real symmetry can be retracted to\ncertain of the classifying spaces of Atiyah and Singer. Secondary\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariants are introduced to label their connected components.\nRelated invariants are also analyzed for $J$-unitary operators.\n", "  Next-to-leading order event generation for the Standard Model effective field\ntheory has started to become available in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. In\nthis talk we discuss some of the recent progresses in this direction, with a\nfocus on the top-quark sector.\n", "  The results of many experiments on a search of fractionally charged particles\nin cosmic rays have been reviewed. The registered by ATIC and PAMELA\nexperiments change of the proton energy spectrum at about 250 GeV can be\nexplained if fractionally charged particles with another energy spectrum slope\nactually mixed with protons but cannot be separated because of a strong dE/dx\nfluctuations. The performed simulations show that multilayer detectors can\nseriously help in such separation. In the Aragats experiment performed using\nmultilayer proportional counter combined with hadron calorimeter a group of\n4e/3 like events with unexpectedly high average energy has been registered. It\ncould be explained by their different from regular hadrons energy spectrum. The\nATIC experiment ionization spectrum in single charged particle area has been\nexamined. An interesting bump in 2e/3 charge region was observed. The events in\nthe bump have very different from regular protons angular distribution.\n", "  Estimations of magnetic fields of neutron stars, observed as radio and X-ray\npulsars, are discussed. It is shown, that theoretical and observational values\nfor different types of radiopulsars are in good correspondence. Radiopulsars in\nclose binaries and millisecond pulsars, which have passed the stage of disk\naccretion (recycled radiopulsars), have magnetic fields 2-4 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than ordinary single pulsars. Most probably, the magnetic field of the\nneutron star was screened by the infalling material. Several screening models\nare considered. Formation of single recycled pulsars loosing its companion is\ndiscussed. Magnetic fields of some X-ray pulsars are estimated from the\ncyclotron line energy. In the case of Her X-1 this estimation exceeds\nconsiderably the value of its magnetic field obtained from long term\nobservational data related to the beam structure evolution. Another\ninterpretation of the cyclotron feature, based on the relativistic dipole\nradiation mechanism, could remove this discrepancy. Observational data about\nsoft gamma repeaters and their interpretation as magnetars are critically\nanalyzed.\n", "  Fabrication processes involving anhydrous hydrofluoric vapor etching are\ndeveloped to create high-$Q$ aluminum superconducting microwave resonators on\nfree-standing silicon membranes formed from a silicon-on-insulator wafer. Using\nthis fabrication process, a high-impedance $8.9$GHz coil resonator is coupled\ncapacitively with large participation ratio to a $9.7$MHz micromechanical\nresonator. Two-tone microwave spectroscopy and radiation pressure back-action\nare used to characterize the coupled system in a dilution refrigerator down to\ntemperatures of $T_f = 11$~mK, yielding a measured electromechanical vacuum\ncoupling rate of $g_{0}/2\\pi \\approx 24.6$~Hz and a mechanical resonator\n$Q$-factor of $Q_{m}=1.7\\times 10^7$. Microwave back-action cooling of the\nmechanical resonator is also studied, with a minimum phonon occupancy of $n_{m}\n\\approx 16$ phonons being realized at an elevated fridge temperature of $T_f =\n211$~mK.\n", "  Measurements of the luminosity of type Ia supernovae vs. redshift provided\nthe original evidence for the accelerating expansion of the Universe and the\nexistence of dark energy. Despite substantial improvements in survey\nmethodology, systematic uncertainty in flux calibration dominates the error\nbudget for this technique, exceeding both statistics and other systematic\nuncertainties. Consequently, any further collection of type Ia supernova data\nwill fail to refine the constraints on the nature of dark energy unless we also\nimprove the state of the art in astronomical flux calibration to the order of\n1%. We describe how these systematic errors arise from calibration of\ninstrumental sensitivity, atmospheric transmission, and Galactic extinction,\nand discuss ongoing efforts to meet the 1% precision challenge using white\ndwarf stars as celestial standards, exquisitely calibrated detectors as\nfundamental metrologic standards, and real-time atmospheric monitoring.\n", "  In a recent paper, Sharifi-Mood et al. study colloidal particles trapped at a\nliquid interface with opposite principal curvatures $c_{1}=-c_{2}$. In the\ntheory part, they claim that the trapping energy vanishes at second order in\n$\\Delta c=c_{1}-c_{2}$, which would invalidate our previous result [Phys. Rev.\nE 74, 041402 (2006)]. Here we show that this claim arises from an improper\ntreatment of the outer boundary condition on the deformation field. For both\npinned and moving contact lines, we find that the outer boundary is irrelevant,\nwhich confirms our previous work. More generally, we show that the trapping\nenergy is determined by the deformation close to the particle and does not\ndepend on the far-field.\n", "  A comprehensive picture of the aging and oxidation of the (0001) surface of\nBi2Se3 is critical to understanding the physical origin of changes in its\ntopologically protected surface states. We find that surface aging in ambient\nconditions occurs in two major steps. Within two hours of exfoliation, a series\nof ~ 3.6 A high islands are observed by atomic force microscopy over\napproximate 10% of the surface. Subsequently, patch growth stops, and oxidation\nbegins after the two hours and continues until one quintuple layer has been\noxidized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows no sign of oxidation before ~\n120 minutes of exposure to air, and the oxygen 1s peak is clearly present after\n~ 190 minutes of ambient exposure. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry\nalso indicates that the oxidation of a full quintuple layer occurs on the time\nscale of days. These results are in good agreement with the time dependent\nchanges previously observed in the surface crystal structure by second harmonic\ngeneration. In addition to providing the ability to non-destructively measure\noxide on the surface of Bi2Se3 crystals, ellipsometry can be used to identify\nthe thickness of Bi2Se3 flakes. These results are consistent with non-linear\noptical methods including rotational anisotropy second harmonic generation,\nwhich follow the time dependence of the changes to the top quintuple layer.\n", "  We examine the decay modes $\\eta/\\etp\\ra \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\gamma$ within the\ncontext of the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Model. Using numerical information\nderived in previous fits to $VP\\gamma$ and $Ve^+e^-$ decay modes in isolation\nand the $\\rho$ lineshape determined in a previous fit to the pion form factor,\nwe show that all aspects of these decays can be predicted with fair accuracy.\nFreeing some parameters does not improve the picture. This is interpreted as a\nstrong evidence in favor of the box anomaly in the $\\eta/\\etp$ decays, which\noccurs at precisely the level expected. We also construct the set of equations\ndefining the amplitudes for $\\eta/\\etp\\ra \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\gamma$ and $ \\eta/\\etp\n\\ra \\ggam $ at the chiral limit, as predicted from the anomalous HLS Lagrangian\nappropriately broken. This provides a set of four equations depending on only\none parameter, instead of three for the traditional set. This is also shown to\nmatch the (two--angle, two--decay--constant) $\\eta-\\etp$ mixing scheme recently\nproposed and is also fairly well fulfilled by the data. The information\nreturned from fits also matches expectations from previously published fits to\nthe $VP\\gamma$ decay modes in isolation.\n"]}
