A crucial point is that the evolution\noperator L may have singular and nonsmooth coefficients. This allows the\napplication of the method e.g. to degenerate and singular particle systems\narising in Mathematical Physics. As far as we know in such singular cases the\nrelaxation to equilibrium can't be discussed with the help of existing\napproaches using hypoellipticity, hypocoercivity or stochastic Lyapunov type\ntechniques. The method is formulated in an L2-Hilbert space setting and is\nbased on an interplay between Functional Analysis and Stochastics. Moreover, it\nimplies an ergodicity rate which can be related to L2-exponential convergence\nof the semigroup. Furthermore, the ergodicity method shows up an interesting\nanalogy with existing hypocoercivity approaches. In the first application we\ndiscuss ergodicity of the N-particle degenerate Langevin dynamics with singular\npotentials. The dual to this equation is also called the kinetic Fokker-Planck\nequation with an external confining potential. In the second example we apply\nthe method to the so-called (degenerate) spherical velocity Langevin equation\nwhich is also known as the fiber lay-down process arising in industrial\nmathematics.\n", "  We consider dynamical black hole formation from a collapsing fluid described\nby a symmetric and flat FRW metric. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi method the local\nHawking temperature for the formed trapping/apparent horizon is calculated. The\nlocal Hawking temperature depends on the tunneling path, which we take to be\nalong a null direction $(\\Delta s=0)$. We find that the local Hawking\ntemperature depends directly on the equation of state of the collapsing fluid.\nWe argue that Hawking radiation by quantum tunnelling from future inner and\nfuture outer trapping horizons is possible. However, only radiation from a\nspace-like dynamical horizon has a chance to be observed by an external\nobserver. Some comparison to existing literature is made.\n", "  Attempts to establish microcanonical entropy as an adiabatic invariant date\nback to works of Gibbs and Hertz. More recently, a consistency relation based\non adiabatic invariance has been used to argue for the validity of Gibbs\n(volume) entropy over Boltzmann (surface) entropy. Such consistency relation\nequates derivatives of thermodynamic entropy to ensemble average of the\ncorresponding quantity in micro-state space (phase space or Hilbert space). In\nthis work we propose to re-examine such a consistency relation when the number\nof particles ($N$) is considered as the independent thermodynamic variable. In\nother words, we investigate the consistency relation for the chemical potential\nwhich is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity. We show both by simple\nanalytical calculations as well as model example that neither definitions of\nentropy satisfy the consistency condition when one considers such a relation\nfor the chemical potential. This remains true regardless of the system size.\nTherefore, our results cast doubt on the validity of the adiabatic invariance\nas a required property of thermodynamic entropy. We close by providing\ncommentary on the derivation of thermostatistics from mechanics which typically\nleads to controversial and inconsistent results.\n", "  We present the formulation of a kinetic mapping scheme between the Direct\nSimulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) which is\nat the basis of the hybrid model used to couple the two methods in view of\nefficiently and accurately simulate isothermal flows characterized by variable\nrarefaction effects. Owing to the kinetic nature of the LBM, the procedure we\npropose ensures to accurately couple DSMC and LBM at a larger Kn number than\nusually done in traditional hybrid DSMC-Navier-Stokes equation models. We show\nthe main steps of the mapping algorithm and illustrate details of the\nimplementation. Good agreement is found between the moments of the single\nparticle distribution function as obtained from the mapping scheme and from\nindependent LBM or DSMC simulations at the grid nodes where the coupling is\nimposed. We also show results on the application of the hybrid scheme based on\na simpler mapping scheme for plane Poiseuille flow at finite Kn number.\nPotential gains in the computational efficiency assured by the application of\nthe coupling scheme are estimated for the same flow.\n"]}
