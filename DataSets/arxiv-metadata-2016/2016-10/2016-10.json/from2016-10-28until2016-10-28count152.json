In particular, simultaneous averaging\nover several parameters is discussed. Special focus is put on proving lower\nbounds on the density of the averaged spectral measures. These Wegner type\nestimates are used to analyze stability properties for the spectral types of\nJacobi matrices under local perturbations.\n", "  A Jacobi matrix with matrix entries is a self-adjoint block tridiagonal\nmatrix with invertible blocks on the off-diagonals. The Weyl surface describing\nthe dependence of Green's matrix on the boundary conditions is interpreted as\nthe set of maximally isotropic subspace of a quadratic from given by the\nWronskian. Analysis of the possibly degenerate limit quadratic form leads to\nthe limit point/limit surface theory of maximal symmetric extensions for\nsemi-infinite Jacobi matrices with matrix entries with arbitrary deficiency\nindices. The resolvent of the extensions is explicitly calculated.\n", "  Sturm-Liouville oscillation theory for periodic Jacobi operators with matrix\nentries is discussed and illustrated. The proof simplifies and clarifies the\nuse of intersection theory of Bott, Maslov and Conley-Zehnder. It is shown that\nthe eigenvalue problem for linear Hamiltonian systems can be dealt with by the\nsame approach.\n", "  This paper analyzes the scattering theory for periodic tight-binding\nHamiltonians perturbed by a finite range impurity. The classical energy\ngradient flow is used to construct a conjugate (or dilation) operator to the\nunperturbed Hamiltonian. For dimension $d\\geq 3$ the wave operator is given by\nan explicit formula in terms of this dilation operator, the free resolvent and\nthe perturbation. From this formula the scattering and time delay operators can\nbe read off. Using the index theorem approach, a Levinson theorem is proved\nwhich also holds in presence of embedded eigenvalues and threshold\nsingularities.\n", "  The NOAA active region AR 11029 was a small but highly active sunspot region\nwhich produced 73 GOES soft X-ray flares. The flares appear to show a departure\nfrom the well known power-law frequency-size distribution. Specifically, too\nfew GOES C-class and no M-class flares were observed by comparison with a\npower-law distribution (Wheatland in Astrophys. J. 710, 1324, 2010). This was\nconjectured to be due to the region having insufficient magnetic energy to\npower large events. We construct nonlinear force-free extrapolations of the\ncoronal magnetic field of active region AR 11029 using data taken on 24 October\nby the SOLIS Vector-SpectroMagnetograph (SOLIS/VSM), and data taken on 27\nOctober by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope SpectroPolarimeter (Hinode/SP).\nForce-free modeling with photospheric magnetogram data encounters problems\nbecause the magnetogram data are inconsistent with a force-free model, and we\nemploy a recently developed `self-consistency' procedure which addresses this\nand accommodates uncertainties in the boundary data (Wheatland and Regnier in\nAstrophys. J. 700, L88, 2009). We calculate the total energy and free energy of\nthe self-consistent solution and find that the free energy was 4x10^29 erg on\n24 October, and 7x10^31 erg on 27 October. An order of magnitude scaling\nbetween RHESSI non-thermal energy and GOES peak X-ray flux is established from\na sample of flares from the literature and is used to estimate flare energies\nfrom observed GOES peak X-ray flux. Based on the scaling, we conclude that the\nestimated free energy of AR 11029 on 27 October when the flaring rate peaked is\nsufficient to power M-class or X-class flares, and hence the modeling does not\nappear to support the hypothesis that the absence of large flares is due to the\nregion having limited energy.\n", "  A scattering zipper is a system obtained by concatenation of scattering\nevents with equal even number of incoming and out going channels. The\nassociated scattering zipper operator is the unitary equivalent of Jacobi\nmatrices with matrix entries and generalizes Blatter-Browne and\nChalker-Coddington models and CMV matrices. Weyl discs are analyzed and used to\nprove a bijection between the set of semi-infinite scattering zipper operators\nand matrix valued probability measures on the unit circle. Sturm-Liouville\noscillation theory is developed as a tool to calculate the spectra of finite\nand periodic scattering zipper operators.\n", "  Transfer matrix methods and intersection theory are used to calculate the\nbands of edge states for a wide class of periodic two-dimensional tight-binding\nmodels including a sublattice and spin degree of freedom. This allows to define\ntopological invariants by considering the associated Bott-Maslov indices which\ncan be easily calculated numerically. For time-reversal symmetric systems in\nthe symplectic universality class this leads to a Z_2-invariant for the edge\nstates. It is shown that the edge state invariants are related to Chern numbers\nof the bulk systems and also to (spin) edge currents, in the spirit of the\ntheory of topological insulators.\n", "  The Kronig-Penney model with random Dirac potentials on the lattice $\\ZM$ has\ncritical energies at which the Lyapunov exponent vanishes and the density of\nstates has a van Hove singularity. This leads to a non-trivial quantum\ndiffusion even though the spectrum is known to be pure-point.\n", "  Majumdar and Tamm [Phys. Rev. E 86 021135 (2012), arXiv:1206.6184] recently\nobtained analytical expressions for the mean number of common sites W_N(t)\nvisited up to time t by N independent random walkers starting from the origin\nof a d-dimensional lattice. In this short note I show how the different regimes\nand the corresponding asymptotic power laws can be retrieved using the notion\nof fractal intersection.\n", "  In the presence of a rotating Kerr black hole, we investigate hydrodynamics\nof the massive particles and massless photons, to construct relations among\nnumber density, pressure and internal energy density of the massive particles\nand photons around the rotating Kerr black hole and to study an accretion onto\nthe black hole. On equatorial plane of the Kerr black hole, we investigate the\nbound orbits of the massive particles and photons around the black hole to\nproduce their radial, azimuthal and precession frequencies. With these\nfrequencies we study the black holes GRO~J1655-40 and 4U~1543-47, to explicitly\nobtain the radial, azimuthal and precession frequencies of the massive\nparticles in the flow of perfect fluid. We next consider the massive particles\nin the stable circular orbit of radius of $1.0~ly$ around the supernovas SN\n1979C, SN 1987A and SN 2213-1745 in the Kerr curved spacetime, and around the\npotential supermassive Schwarzschild black holes M87, NGC 3115, NGC 4594, NGC\n3377, NGC 4258, M31, M32 and Galatic center, to estimate their radial and\nazimuthal frequencies, which are shown to be the same results as those in no\nprecession motion. The photon unstable orbit is also discussed in terms of the\nimpact parameter of the photon trajectory. Finally, on the equatorial plane of\nthe Kerr black hole, we construct the global flat embedding structures\npossessing (9+3) dimensionalities outside and inside the event horizon of the\nrotating Kerr black hole. Moreover, on the plane we investigate the warp\nproducts of the Kerr spacetime.\n", "  The coronal magnetic field cannot be directly observed, but in principle it\ncan be reconstructed from the comparatively well observed photospheric magnetic\nfield. A popular approach uses a nonlinear force-free model. Non-magnetic\nforces at the photosphere are significant meaning the photospheric data are\ninconsistent with the force-free model, and this causes problems with the\nmodeling (De Rosa et al., Astrophys. J. 696, 1780, 2009). In this paper we\npresent a numerical implementation of the Grad-Rubin method for reconstructing\nthe coronal magnetic field using a magnetostatic model. This model includes a\npressure force and a non-zero magnetic Lorentz force. We demonstrate our\nimplementation on a simple analytic test case and obtain the speed and\nnumerical error scaling as a function of the grid size.\n", "  Besides offering a friendly introduction to knot homologies and quantum\ncurves, the goal of these lectures is to review some of the concrete\npredictions that follow from the physical interpretation of knot homologies. In\nparticular, this interpretation allows one to pose questions that would not\nhave been asked otherwise, such as, \"Is there a direct relation between\nKhovanov homology and the A-polynomial of a knot?\" We will explain that the\nanswer to this question is \"yes,\" and introduce a certain deformation of the\nplanar algebraic curve defined by the zero locus of the A-polynomial. This\nnovel deformation leads to a categorified version of the Generalized Volume\nConjecture that completely describes the \"color behavior\" of the colored sl(2)\nknot homology, and eventually to a similar version for the colored HOMFLY\nhomology. Furthermore, this deformation is strong enough to distinguish\nmutants, and its most interesting properties include relations to knot contact\nhomology and knot Floer homology.\n", "  We study the linear and nonlinear stability of relative equilibria in the\nplanar N-vortex problem, adapting the approach of Moeckel from the\ncorresponding problem in celestial mechanics. After establishing some general\ntheory, a topological approach is taken to show that for the case of positive\ncirculations, a relative equilibrium is linearly stable if and only if it is a\nnondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian restricted to a level surface of the\nangular impulse (moment of inertia). Using a criterion of Dirichlet's, this\nimplies that any linearly stable relative equilibrium with positive vorticities\nis also nonlinearly stable. Two symmetric families, the rhombus and the\nisosceles trapezoid, are analyzed in detail, with stable solutions found in\neach case.\n", "  We propose a complementary point of view on the topological invariants of\ntwo-dimensional tight-binding models restricted to half-spaces. The transfer\noperators for such systems are $J$-unitary on a infinite dimensional Krein\nspace $(\\mathcal{K},J)$ and, for energies in the bulk gap, only have discrete\nspectrum on the unit circle. These eigenvalues have Krein inertia which can be\nused to define topological invariants determining the nature of the surface\nmodes and allowing to distinguish different topological phases. This is\nillustrated by numerical results.\n", "  We present a code for solving the nonlinear force-free equations in spherical\npolar geometry, with the motivation of modeling the magnetic field in the\ncorona. The code is an implementation of the Grad-Rubin method. Our method is\napplicable to a spherical domain of arbitrary angular size. The implementation\nis based on a global spectral representation for the magnetic field which makes\nno explicit assumptions about the form of the magnetic field at the transverse\nboundaries of the domain. We apply the code to a bipolar test case with\nanalytic boundary conditions, and we demonstrate the convergence of the\nGrad-Rubin method, and the self-consistency of the resulting numerical\nsolution.\n", "  {A simple electrodynamic model is developed to define plasma-field structures\nin self-consistent ultra-relativistic laser-plasma interactions when the\nradiation reaction effects come into play. An exact analysis of a circularly\npolarized laser interacting with plasmas is presented. We define fundamental\nnotations such as nonlinear dielectric permittivity, ponderomotive and\ndissipative forces acting in a plasma. Plasma-field structures arising during\nthe ultra-relativisitc interactions are also calculated. Based on these\nsolutions we show that about 50% of laser energy can be converted into\ngamma-rays in the optimal conditions of laser-foil interaction.\n", "  Finding a good compromise between the exploitation of known resources and the\nexploration of unknown, but potentially more profitable choices, is a general\nproblem, which arises in many different scientific disciplines. We propose a\nstylized model for these exploration-exploitation situations, including\npopulation or economic growth, portfolio optimisation, evolutionary dynamics,\nor the problem of optimal pinning of vortices or dislocations in disordered\nmaterials. We find the exact growth rate of this model for tree-like geometries\nand prove the existence of an optimal migration rate in this case. Numerical\nsimulations in the one-dimensional case confirm the generic existence of an\noptimum.\n", "  We present the program package NMSSMCALC for the calculation of the\nloop-corrected NMSSM Higgs boson masses and decay widths in the CP-conserving\nand CP-violating NMSSM. The full one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson masses\nare evaluated in a mixed renormalisation scheme of on-shell and\n$\\overline{\\mbox{DR}}$ conditions. The Higgs decay widths include the dominant\nhigher order QCD corrections, and the decays into bottom quarks, strange quarks\nand tau leptons are supplemented by higher order SUSY corrections through\neffective couplings. All relevant off-shell decays into two massive gauge\nbosons, gauge and Higgs boson and Higgs pair final states as well as into heavy\nquark pairs are computed. The input and output files feature the SUSY Les\nHouches Accord so that the program can easily be linked with existing computer\ntools.\n", "  Reaction fronts evolving in a porous medium exhibit a rich dynamical\nbehaviour. In presence of an adverse flow, experiments show that the front\nslows down and eventually gets pinned, displaying a particular sawtooth shape.\nExtensive numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations confirm the\nexperimental observations. Here we propose a stylized model, predicting two\npossible outcomes of the experiments for large adverse flow: either the front\ndevelops a sawtooth shape, or it acquires a complicated structure with islands\nand overhangs. A simple criterion allows to distinguish between the two\nscenarios and its validity is reproduced by direct hydrodynamical simulations.\nOur model gives a better understanding of the transition and is relevant in a\nvariety of domains, when the pinning regime is strong and only relies on a\nsmall number of sites.\n", "  The effect of He-ion irradiation on a short-range ordering in model\nFe100-xCrx (x=5.8, 10.75, 15.15) was studied by means of conversion electrons\nMossbauer spectroscopy. The alloys were irradiated to the dose of 7.5 dpa with\nions of 0.25 and 2.0 MeV. The short-range order was expressed in terms of the\nWarren-Cowley parameters: alpha1 (for the first nearest-neighbor shell), alpha2\n(for the second nearest-neighbor shell) and alpha12 (for both shells). For all\nalloys and both energies a clustering of Cr atoms was revealed, as far as\nalpha1 and alpha2 are considered, yet its degree was found to be both\nconcentration and energy dependent. The average short-range order parameter,\nalpha12, exhibits, however, a cross-over transition at x=10 from ordering into\nclustering. The strongest effect of energy occurs at x=5.8 and the weakest one\nat x=10.75.\n", "  Position probability distribution of a set of massive mutually exclusive\nparticles in one dimension has been defined. Examples with a given two mutually\nexclusive particles system are considered. It is emphasized that quantum\nparticles at finite potentials can not be regarded as a mutually exclusive\nsystem or they are indistinguishable. Afterward, it is attempted to ascribe a\nmutually exclusive system to continuous mass densities of a rigid body to\ncalculate average values. We do this by applying correspondence principle with\nregard to probability densities.\n", "  Given a multisymplectic manifold $(M,\\omega)$ and a Lie algebra $\\frak{g}$\nacting on it by infinitesimal symmetries, Fregier-Rogers-Zambon define a\nhomotopy (co-)moment as an $L_{\\infty}$-algebra-homomorphism from $\\frak{g}$ to\nthe observable algebra $L(M,\\omega)$ associated to $(M,\\omega)$, in analogy\nwith and generalizing the notion of a co-moment map in symplectic geometry. We\ngive a cohomological characterization of existence and unicity for homotopy\nco-moment maps and show its utility in multisymplectic geometry by applying it\nto special cases as exact multisymplectic manifolds and simple Lie groups and\nby deriving from it existence results concerning partial co-moment maps, as\ne.g. covariant multimomentum maps and multi-moment maps.\n", "  The loop $O(n)$ model is a model for a random collection of non-intersecting\nloops on the hexagonal lattice, which is believed to be in the same\nuniversality class as the spin $O(n)$ model. It has been conjectured that both\nthe spin and the loop $O(n)$ models exhibit exponential decay of correlations\nwhen $n>2$. We verify this for the loop $O(n)$ model with large parameter $n$,\nshowing that long loops are exponentially unlikely to occur, uniformly in the\nedge weight $x$. Our proof provides further detail on the structure of typical\nconfigurations in this regime. Putting appropriate boundary conditions, when\n$nx^6$ is sufficiently small, the model is in a dilute, disordered phase in\nwhich each vertex is unlikely to be surrounded by any loops, whereas when\n$nx^6$ is sufficiently large, the model is in a dense, ordered phase which is a\nsmall perturbation of one of the three ground states.\n", "  We construct generalized quantum Cauchy pre-measures that correspond to the\nanalytic continuation of the transition probability of the Cauchy process to\nimaginary time. We show that these complex pre-measures of time translations\nextend to a measure on the space dual to a real Hilbert space whose support is\nlocally compact in the uniform convergence topology and with velocities in the\nHilbert space.\n  At that the quantum Cauchy-Dirac and Cauchy-Maxwell pre-measures of time\ntranslations of electrons and photons, that correspond to the retarded Green's\nfunctions of the Dirac and Maxwell equations with no sources viewed as\ngeneralized functions on bump functions, are unitary equivalent to quantum\nCauchy pre-measures\n  Therefore these pre-measures on the space dual to a real Hilbert space are\n$\\sigma$-additive as well, but their support on the electron (respectively,\nphoton) trajectories are compact in the uniform convergence topology with\nvelocities in the Hilbert space.\n  We study the way the classical relativistic mechanics of particle comes from\nthe quantum mechanics of the free Dirac particle.\n", "  In our previous work it has been shown the possibility to use the\nAharonov-Anandan invariant as a tool in the analysis of disparate systems,\nincluding Hawking and Unruh effects, as well as graphene physics and thermal\nstates. We show that the vacuum condensation, characterizing such systems, is\nalso related with geometric phases and we analyze the properties of the\ngeometric phase of systems represented by mixed state and undergoing a\nnonunitary evolution. In particular, we consider two level atoms accelerated by\nan external potential and interacting with a thermal state. We propose the\nrealization of Mach-Zehnder interferometers which can prove the existence of\nthe Unruh effect and can allow very precise measurements of temperature.\n", "  We consider the impact of quantum effects on electron dynamics in a plane\nlinearly polarized standing wave with relativistic amplitudes. For this purpose\nanalysis the Lyapunov characteristic exponent spectrum with and without\nallowance for the classic radiation reaction force has been analyzed. Based on\nthis analysis it is concluded that the contraction effect of phase space in the\nstochastic regime due to the radiation reaction force in the classical form\ndoesn't occur when the quantum nature of hard photon emission is taken into\naccount. It is shown that electron bunch kinetics has a diffusion solution\nrather than the d'Alambert type solution as in the classic description.It is\nalso revealed that the electron motion can be described using the Markov chain\nformalism. This method gives exact characteristics of electron bunch evolution,\nsuch as motion of the center of mass and electron bunch dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the problem of estimating a given real symmetric signal matrix\n$\\textbf{C}$ from a noisy observation matrix $\\textbf{M}$ in the limit of large\ndimension. We consider the case where the noisy measurement $\\textbf{M}$ comes\neither from an arbitrary additive or multiplicative rotational invariant\nperturbation. We establish, using the Replica method, the asymptotic global law\nestimate for three general classes of noisy matrices, significantly extending\npreviously obtained results. We give exact results concerning the asymptotic\ndeviations (called overlaps) of the perturbed eigenvectors away from the true\nones, and we explain how to use these overlaps to \"clean\" the noisy eigenvalues\nof $\\textbf{M}$. We provide some numerical checks for the different estimators\nproposed in this paper and we also make the connection with some well known\nresults of Bayesian statistics.\n", "  The current detectors of gamma-ray emission specially at TeV energies have\ntoo poor resolution to determine whether this emission is produced in the jet\nor in the core, particularly of low luminous, non-blazar AGNs (like radio\ngalaxies). In recent works it has been found that the power released by events\nof turbulent fast magnetic reconnection in the core region of these sources is\nmore than sufficient to reproduce the observed gamma-ray luminosities. Besides,\n3D MHD simulations with test particles have demonstrated that a first-order\nFermi process within reconnection sites with embedded turbulence results very\nefficient particle acceleration rates. We computed here the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) from radio to gamma-rays of the radio galaxies for which\nenergy emission up to TeVs has been detected (namely, M87, Cen A, Per A, and IC\n310). For this aim, we employed the acceleration model above and considered all\nthe relevant leptonic and hadronic loss processes around the core region of the\nsources. We found that the calculated SEDs match very well specially with the\nVHE observations, therefore strengthening the conclusions above in favour of a\ncore emission origin for the VHE emission of these sources. The model also\nnaturally explains the observed very fast variability of the VHE emission.\n", "  We compute the full next-to-leading order supersymmetric (SUSY) electroweak\n(EW) and SUSY-QCD corrections to the decays of CP-odd NMSSM Higgs bosons into\nstop pairs. In our numerical analysis we also present the decay of the heavier\nstop into the lighter stop and an NMSSM CP-odd Higgs boson. Both the EW and the\nSUSY-QCD corrections are found to be significant and have to be taken into\naccount for a proper prediction of the decay widths.\n", "  Using QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates, we show that the distribution\namplitude of the longitudinally polarized $\\rho$-meson may have a shorttailed\nplatykurtic profile in close analogy to our recently proposed platykurtic\ndistribution amplitude for the pion. Such a chimera distribution de facto\namalgamates the broad unimodal profile of the distribution amplitude, obtained\nwith a Dyson-Schwinger equations-based computational scheme, with the\nsuppressed tails characterizing the bimodal distribution amplitudes derived\nfrom QCD sum rules with nonlocal condensates. We argue that pattern formation,\nemerging from the collective synchronization of coupled oscillators, can\nprovide a single theoretical scaffolding to study unimodal and bimodal\ndistribution amplitudes of light mesons without recourse to particular\ncomputational schemes and the reasons for them.\n", "  We introduce a class of \"weakly asymptotically hyperbolic\" geometries whose\nsectional curvatures tend to $-1$ and are $C^0$, but are not necessarily $C^1$,\nconformally compact. We subsequently investigate the rate at which curvature\ninvariants decay at infinity, identifying a conformally invariant tensor which\nserves as an obstruction to \"higher order decay\" of the Riemann curvature\noperator. Finally, we establish Fredholm results for geometric elliptic\noperators, extending the work of Rafe Mazzeo and John M. Lee to this setting.\nAs an application, we show that any weakly asymptotically hyperbolic metric is\nconformally related to a weakly asymptotically hyperbolic metric of constant\nnegative curvature.\n", "  We provide results for the open-flavor strong decays of strange and\nnon-strange baryons into a baryon-vector/pseudoscalar meson pair. The decay\namplitudes are computed in the $^3P_0$ pair-creation model, where $s\\bar{s}$\npair-creation suppression is included for the first time in the baryon sector,\nin combination with the U(7) and hypercentral models. The effects of this\n$s\\bar{s}$ suppression mechanism cannot be re-absorbed in a redefinition of the\nmodel parameters or in a different choice of the $^3P_0$ model vertex factor.\nOur results for the decay amplitudes are compared with the existing\nexperimental data and previous $^3P_0$ and elementary meson emission model\ncalculations. In this respect, we show that distinct quark models differ in the\nnumber of missing resonances they predict and also in the quantum numbers of\nstates. Therefore, future experimental results will be important in order to\ndisentangle different models of baryon structure. Finally, in the appendices,\nwe provide some details of our calculations, including the derivation of all\nrelevant flavor couplings with strangeness-suppression. This derivation may be\nhelpful to calculate the open-flavor decay amplitudes starting from other\nmodels of baryons.\n", "  Mass spectra of strange baryons are calculated in the framework of the\nrelativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach. Baryons are\ntreated as the relativistic quark-diquark bound systems. It is assumed that two\nquarks with equal constituent masses form a diquark. The diquark excitations\nand its internal structure are consistently taken into account. Calculations\nare performed up to rather high orbital and radial excitations of strange\nbaryons. On this basis the Regge trajectories are constructed. The obtained\nresults are compared with available experimental data and previous predictions.\nIt is found that all masses of the 4- and 3-star, as well as most of the 2- and\n1-star states of strange baryons with established quantum numbers are well\nreproduced. The developed relativistic quark-diquark model predicts less\nexcited states than three-quark models of strange baryons.\n", "  We propose the algorithm for determining vibrational quantum eigenstates of\nperiodic linear chain of atoms coupled by harmonic and third order anharmonic\ninteractions (Fermi-Ulam-Pasta $\\alpha$ problem) in the long wavelength limit\nwithin the resonant approach. Eigenstates can be encoded by the sequence of\ninteger numbers determining their energies and wavefunctions. Using these\neigenstates we described a single phonon state time evolution showing coherent\noscillations. The applications of theory to vibrational energy transport and\nquantum informatics are discussed.\n", "  The Japanese art of turning flat sheets into 3D intricate structures,\norigami, has inspired design of mechanical metamaterials. Mechanical\nmetamaterials are artificially engineered materials with uncommon properties.\nMiura-ori is a remarkable origami folding pattern with metamaterial properties\nand a wide range of applications. In this study, by dislocating the zigzag\nstrips of a Miura-ori pattern along the joining ridges, we create a class of\none-degree of freedom (DOF) cellular mechanical metamaterials. The resulting\nconfigurations are based on a unit cell in which two zigzag strips surround a\nhole with a parallelogram cross section. We show that dislocating zigzag strips\nof the Miura-ori along the joining ridges, preserves and/or tunes the\noutstanding properties of the Miura-ori. The introduced materials are lighter\nthan their corresponding Miura-ori sheets due to the presence of holes in the\npatterns. Moreover, they are amenable to similar modifications available for\nMiura-ori which make them appropriate for a wide range of applications.\n", "  The production of different quarkonium states provides unique insight to the\nhot and cold nuclear matter effects in the strongly interacting medium that is\nformed in high energy heavy ion collisions. While LHC explores the energy\nfrontier, RHIC has a broad physics program to explore the nuclear modification\nat different energies in a wide range of systems. Some of the most interesting\nrecent results on $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in p+p, d+Au and A+A\ncollisions from PHENIX and STAR are summarized in this work.\n", "  The strong form factor of the $B_{c} B_{c}J/\\Psi$ vertex is calculated in the\nframework of the QCD sum rules method at finite temperature. Taking into\naccount additional operators appearing at finite temperature, thermal Wilson\nexpansion is obtained and QCD sum rules are derived. While increasing\ntemperature, the strong form factor remains unchanged up to $T\\simeq100~MeV$\nbut slightly increases after this point. After $T\\simeq160~MeV$, the form\nfactor suddenly decreases up to $T\\simeq170~MeV$. The obtained result of the\ncoupling constant by fitting the form factor at $Q^2=-m^2_{offshell}$ at $T=0$\nis in a very good agreement with the QCD sum rules calculations at vacuum. Our\nprediction can be checked in the future experiments.\n", "  Recently it has been argued that weighting the writhe of unknotted\nself-avoiding polygons can be related to possible experiments that turn double\nstranded DNA. We first solve exactly a directed model and demonstrate that in\nsuch a subset of polygons the problem of weighting their writhe is associated\nwith a phase transition. We then analyse simulations using the Wang-Landau\nalgorithm to observe scaling in the fluctuations of the writhe that is\ncompatible with a second-order phase transition in a undirected self-avoiding\npolygon model. Crucially, we conclude that the transition becomes apparent when\nthe polygon is stretched sufficiently with a pulling force.\n", "  When double stranded DNA is turned in experiments it undergoes a transition.\nWe use an interacting self-avoiding walk on a three-dimensional fcc lattice\nweighted by writhe to relate to these experiments and treat this problem via\nsimulations. We provide evidence for the existence of a thermodynamic phase\ntransition induced by writhe and examine related phase diagrams taking solvent\nquality and stretching into account.\n", "  We consider correlation functions for a vertex operator algebra on a genus\ntwo Riemann surface formed by sewing two tori together. We describe a\ngeneralisation of genus one Zhu recursion where we express an arbitrary genus\ntwo $n$--point correlation function in terms of $(n-1)$--point functions. We\nconsider several applications including the correlation functions for the\nHeisenberg vertex operator algebra and its modules, Virasoro correlation\nfunctions and genus two Ward identities. We derive novel differential equations\nin terms of a differential operator on the genus two Siegel upper half plane\nfor holomorphic $1$--differentials, the normalised bidifferential of the second\nkind, the projective connection and the Heisenberg partition function. We prove\nthat the holomorphic mapping from the sewing parameter domain to the Siegel\nupper half plane is injective but not surjective. We also demonstrate that\ngenus two differential equations arising from Virasoro singular vectors have\nholomorphic coefficients.\n", "  We report on recent results showing that the geometric phase can be used as a\ntool in the analysis of many different physical systems, as mixed boson\nsystems, CPT and CP violations, Unruh effects and thermal states. We show that\nthe geometric phases appearing in the time evolution of mixed meson systems\nlike $B_{s}^{0}-\\bar{B}_{s}^{0}$ and the $K^{0}-\\bar{K}^{0}$ are linked to the\nparameter $z$ describing the $CPT$ violation. A non zero phase difference\nbetween particle and antiparticle arises only in the presence of $CPT$ symmetry\nbreaking. Then the geometric phase can represent a completely new test for the\n$CPT$ invariance. Moreover, we study the geometric phase of systems represented\nby mixed state and undergoing a nonunitary evolution and propose the\nrealization of interferometers which can prove the existence of the Unruh\neffect and can allow very precise measurements of temperature. We are glad to\ndedicate this paper to Professor Gaetano Vilasi in the occasion of his 70th\nbirthday.\n", "  Effects of pulse magnetic field on the optical transmission properties of\nthin ferrofluid (FF) layers were experimentally investigated. It was observed\nthat, under an influence of an external uniform magnetic field, pulses applied\nto the samples surfaces in normal direction decrease the optical transmission\nwith further returning it to its original state, even before the end of the\nfield pulse. The dependencies of the observed effects on the magnetic pulse\nmagnitude and the samples thickness were investigated. The experimental results\nare explained using FF columnar aggregates growth and lateral coalescence under\ninfluence of a magnetic field, leading to a light scattering type\nRayleigh-to-Mie transition. Further evolution of this process comes to a\ngeometrical optics scale and respective macroscopic observable opaque FF\ncolumnar aggregates emergence. These changes of optical transmission are\nnon-monotonic during the magnetic field pulse duration with minimal value in\nthe case of Mie scattering, which is known as a magneto-optical extinction\ntrend inversion. The residual inversion was detected after the external\nmagnetic field pulse falling edge. Using molecular dynamics simulation, we\nshowed that a homogeneous external magnetic field is enough for the formation\nof columnar aggregates and their fusion. The results clarify the known Li\ntheory (Li et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 37 (2004) 3357, and Sci. Technol.\nAdv. Mate. 8 (2007) 448), implying an inhomogeneous field as a required\nprerequisite for the magneto-optical extinction trend inversion phenomenon.\n", "  We develop a quantum field theory for parametrically pumped polaritons using\nKeldysh Green's function techniques. By considering the mean-field and Gaussian\nfluctuations, we find that the low energy physics of the highly non-equilibrium\nphase transition to the optical parametric oscillator regime is in many ways\nsimilar to equilibrium condensation. In particular, we show that this phase\ntransition can be associated with an effective chemical potential, at which the\nsystem's bosonic distribution function diverges, and an effective temperature.\nAs in equilibrium systems, the transition is achieved by tuning this effective\nchemical potential to the energy of the lowest normal mode. Since the\noccupations of the modes are available, we determine experimentally observable\nproperties, such as the luminescence and absorption spectra.\n", "  XAFS studies of Ni-doped Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$TiO$_3$ solid solution reveal that\nthe Ni oxidation state changes from 4 in SrTiO$_3$ to 2.5 in BaTiO$_3$ when\nvarying $x$. This change is accompanied by a noticeable change in the\ninteratomic Ni-O distances in the first shell. The first-principles\ncalculations show that nickel creates an impurity band in the forbidden band\ngap of BaTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$, which explains the appearance of intense\nabsorption of Ni-doped samples in the visible region. The analysis of the\nelectronic structure of doped crystals and calculations of the oxygen vacancy\nformation energy in them show that different oxidation states of Ni in\nSrTiO$_3$ and BaTiO$_3$ can be explained by different formation energies of the\noxygen vacancies in these compounds.\n", "  In this paper we study a model of the two-dimensional quantum harmonic\noscillator in a 3-dimensional anti-de Sitter background. We use a generalized\nSchr\\\"odinger picture in which the analogs of the Schr\\\"odinger operators of\nthe particle are independent of both the time and the space coordinates in\ndifferent representations. The spacetime independent operators of the particle\ninduce the Lie algebra of Killing vector fields of the $AdS_3$ spacetime. In\nthis picture, we have a metamorphosis of the Heisenberg's uncertainty\nrelations.\n", "  The possibility of constructing a complete, continuous Wigner function for\nany quantum system has been a subject of investigation for over 50 years. A key\nsystem that has served to illustrate the difficulties of this problem has been\nan ensemble of spins. Here we present a general and consistent framework for\nconstructing Wigner functions exploiting the underlying symmetries in the\nphysical system at hand. The Wigner function can be used to fully describe any\nquantum system of arbitrary dimension or ensemble size.\n", "  In this work, we discuss the accretion onto static spherical symmetric\nregular black holes for specific choices of equation of state parameter. The\nunderlying regular black holes are charged regular black hole using Fermi-Dirac\nDistribution, logistic distribution, nonlinear electrodynamics, respectively\nand Kehagias-Sftesos asymptotically flat regular black hole. We obtain the\ncritical radius, critical speed and squared sound speed during the accretion\nprocess near the regular black holes. We also study the behavior of radial\nvelocity, energy density and rate of change of mass for each regular black\nholes.\n", "  The piston system (particles in a box) is the simplest and paradigmatic model\nin traditional thermodynamics. However, the recently established framework of\nstochastic thermodynamics (ST) fails to apply to this model system due to the\nembedded singularity in the potential. In this Letter we study the stochastic\nthermodynamics of a particle in a box by adopting a novel coordinate\ntransformation technique. Through comparing with the exact solution of a\nbreathing harmonic oscillator, we obtain analytical results of work\ndistribution for an arbitrary protocol in the linear response regime, and\nverify various predictions of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation. When\napplying to the Brownian Szilard's engine model, we obtain the optimal protocol\n$\\lambda_t = \\lambda_0 2^{t/\\tau}$ for a given sufficiently long total time\n$\\tau$. Our study not only establishes a paradigm for studying ST of a particle\nin a box, but also bridges the long-standing gap in the development of ST.\n", "  The probability of creating an electron-positron pair out of the quantum\nvacuum by a strong electric field can be enhanced tremendously via an\nadditional weaker time-dependent field. This dynamically assisted\nSauter-Schwinger effect has already been studied in several works. It has been\nfound that the enhancement mechanism depends on the shape of the weaker field.\nFor example, a Sauter pulse $1/\\cosh(\\omega t)^2$ and a Gaussian profile\n$\\exp(-\\omega^2 t^2)$ exhibit significant, qualitative differences. However, so\nfar most of the analytical studies were focused on the exponent entering the\npair-creation probability. Here, we study the subleading prefactor in front of\nthe exponential using the worldline instanton method. We find that the main\nfeatures of the dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect, including the\ndependence on the shape of the weaker field, are basically unaffected by the\nprefactor. To test the validity of the instanton approximation, we compare the\nnumber of produced pairs to a numerical integration of the full Riccati\nequation.\n", "  Alternative theories of gravity typically invoke an environment-dependent\nscreening mechanism to allow phenomenologically interesting deviations from\ngeneral relativity (GR) to manifest on larger scales, while reducing to GR on\nsmall scales. The observation of the transition from screened to unscreened\nbehavior would be compelling evidence for beyond-GR physics. We show that\npairwise peculiar velocity statistics, in particular the relative radial\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_\\parallel$ , can be used to observe this\ntransition when they are binned by some measure of halo environment. We\nestablished this by measuring the radial velocity dispersion between pairs of\nhalos in N-body simulations for three $f(R)$ gravity and four symmetron models.\nWe developed an estimator involving only line-of-sight velocities to show that\nthis quantity is observable, and binned the results in halo mass, ambient\ndensity, and the isolatedness of halos. Ambient density is found to be the most\nrelevant measure of environment; it is distinct from isolatedness, and\ncorrelates well with theoretical expectations for the symmetron model. By\nbinning $\\sigma_\\parallel$ in ambient density, we find a strong\nenvironment-dependent signature for the symmetron models, with the velocities\nshowing a clear transition from GR to non-GR behavior. No such transition is\nobserved for $f(R)$, as the relevant scales are deep in the unscreened regime.\nObservations of the relative radial velocity dispersion in forthcoming peculiar\nvelocity surveys, if binned appropriately by environment, therefore offer a\nvaluable way of detecting the screening signature of modified gravity.\n", "  Manipulating materials properties far from equilibrium recently garnered\nsignificant attention, with experimental emphasis on transient melting,\nenhancement, or induction of electronic order. A more tantalizing aspect of the\nmatter-light interaction regards the possibility to access dynamical steady\nstates with distinct non-equilibrium phase transitions to affect electronic\ntransport. Here, we show that the interplay of crystal symmetry and optical\npumping of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) provides a novel\navenue to engineer topologically-protected chiral edge modes. In stark contrast\nto graphene and previously-discussed toy models, the underlying generic\nmechanism relies on the intrinsic three-band nature of TMDCs near the band\nedges. Photo-induced band inversions scale linearly in applied pump field and\nexhibit a transition from one to two chiral edge modes upon sweeping from red\nto blue detuning. We develop a strategy to understand non-equilibrium\nFloquet-Bloch bands and topological transitions directly from ab initio\ncalculations, and illustrate for the example of WS$_2$ that control of chiral\nedge modes can be dictated solely from symmetry principles and is not\nqualitatively sensitive to microscopic materials details.\n", "  The de Sitter invariant special relativity is a natural extension of the\nusual Einstein special relativity. Within this framework a generalization of\nspecial relativity (SR) for the de Sitter space-time introduces a new length\nscale $R$, serving an origin of geometrical cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda=3/R^2$. De Sitter relativity predicts the departure from the Lorentz\ninvariance due to spacetime curvature, related to the geometrical cosmological\nconstant. In this paper the possible impact of de Sitter special relativity\neffects on threshold particle processes and equivalence principle violation is\nconsidered. The main conclusion is that constraints, coming from cosmological\nfine structure constant variations render this effects nowadays undetectable. A\nbrief outlook is given thereafter.\n", "  We have mapped the extended narrow line region (ENLR) of NGC 3393 on scales\nof $r\\lesssim4^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($\\sim1\\,$kpc) from the nucleus using emission\nline images of H$\\alpha\\,\\lambda6563$, [O III]$\\lambda5007$, and [S\nII]$\\lambda\\lambda6717,6731$ taken with HST as part of the CHandra survey of\nExtended Emission line Regions in nearby Seyfert galaxies (CHEERS). By mapping\nthese lines onto a spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram,\nwe investigate the impact of feedback from a Compton-thick AGN on its\ncircumnuclear ISM. We find the expected Seyfert-like emission within the\nionization bicone ($\\lesssim3^{\\prime\\prime}$; 770 pc). We also find a new,\nfigure 8 shaped LINER cocoon enveloping the bicone and defining a sharp\n($\\lesssim100\\;$pc) transition between higher and lower ionization zones. These\ndata illustrate the morphological dependence of ionization states of the ENLR\nrelative to bicone and host gas geometries.\n", "  A generic non-minimal coupling can push any higher-order terms of the scalar\npotential sufficiently far out in field space to yield observationally viable\nplateau inflation. We provide analytic and numerical evidence that this\ngenerically happens for a non-minimal coupling strength $\\xi$ of the order\n$N_e^2$. In this regime, the non-minimally coupled field is sub-Planckian\nduring inflation and is thus protected from most higher-order terms. For larger\nvalues of $\\xi$, the inflationary predictions converge towards the sweet spot\nof PLANCK. The latter includes $\\xi\\simeq 10^4$ obtained from CMB normalization\narguments, thus providing a natural explanation for the inflationary\nobservables measured.\n", "  Renormalization group theory does not restrict the from of continuous\nvariation of critical exponents which occurs in presence of a marginal\noperator. However, the continuous variation of critical exponents, observed in\ndifferent contexts, usually follows a weak universality scenario where some of\nthe exponents (e.g., $\\beta, \\gamma, \\nu$) vary keeping others (e.g., $\\delta ,\n\\eta$) fixed. Here we report a ferromagnetic phase transition in\n(Sm$_{1-y}$Nd$_{y}$)$_{0.52}$Sr$_{0.48}$MnO$_3$ $(0.5\\le y\\le1)$ single crystal\nwhere all critical exponents vary with $y.$ Such variation clearly violates\nboth universality and weak universality hypothesis. We propose a new scaling\ntheory that explains the present experimental results, reduces to the weak\nuniversality as a special case, and provides a generic route leading to\ncontinuous variation of critical exponents and multicriticality.\n", "  This study considers the generalized uncertainty principle, which\nincorporates the central idea of large extra dimensions, to investigate the\nprocesses involved when massive spin-1 particles tunnel from Reissner-Nordstrom\nand Kerr black holes under the effects of quantum gravity. For the black hole,\nthe quantum gravity correction decelerates the increase in temperature. Up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{M_f^2})$, the corrected temperatures are affected by the\nmass and angular momentum of the emitted vector bosons. In addition, the\ntemperature of the Kerr black hole becomes uneven due to rotation. When the\nmass of the black hole approaches the order of the higher dimensional Planck\nmass $M_f$, it stops radiating and yields a black hole remnant.\n", "  Understanding protein-protein interactions is central to our understanding of\nalmost all complex biological processes. Computational tools exploiting rapidly\ngrowing genomic databases to characterize protein-protein interactions are\nurgently needed. Such methods should connect multiple scales from evolutionary\nconserved interactions between families of homologous proteins, over the\nidentification of specifically interacting proteins in the case of multiple\nparalogs inside a species, down to the prediction of residues being in physical\ncontact across interaction interfaces. Statistical inference methods detecting\nresidue-residue coevolution have recently triggered considerable progress in\nusing sequence data for quaternary protein structure prediction; they require,\nhowever, large joint alignments of homologous protein pairs known to interact.\nThe generation of such alignments is a complex computational task on its own;\napplication of coevolutionary modeling has in turn been restricted to proteins\nwithout paralogs, or to bacterial systems with the corresponding coding genes\nbeing co-localized in operons. Here we show that the Direct-Coupling Analysis\nof residue coevolution can be extended to connect the different scales, and\nsimultaneously to match interacting paralogs, to identify inter-protein\nresidue-residue contacts and to discriminate interacting from noninteracting\nfamilies in a multiprotein system. Our results extend the potential\napplications of coevolutionary analysis far beyond cases treatable so far.\n", "  Beyond the use of genuine monolithic integrated optical platforms, we report\nhere a hybrid strategy enabling on-chip generation of configurable heralded\ntwo-photon states. More specifically, we combine two different fabrication\ntechniques, \\textit{i.e.}, non-linear waveguides on lithium niobate for\nefficient photon-pair generation and femtosecond-laser-direct-written\nwaveguides on glass for photon manipulation. Through real-time device\nmanipulation capabilities, a variety of path-coded heralded two-photon states\ncan be produced, ranging from product to entangled states. Those states are\nengineered with high levels of purity, assessed by fidelities of 99.5$\\pm$8\\%\nand 95.0$\\pm$8\\%, respectively, obtained via quantum interferometric\nmeasurements. Our strategy therefore stands as a milestone for further\nexploiting entanglement-based protocols, relying on engineered quantum states,\nand enabled by scalable and compatible photonic circuits.\n", "  In this work we consider a model of epidemic spreading coupled with an\nopinion dynamics in a fully-connected population. Regarding the opinion\ndynamics, the individuals may be in two distinct states, namely in favor or\nagainst a vaccination campaign. Individuals against the vaccination follow a\nstandard SIS model, whereas the pro-vaccine individuals can also be in a third\ncompartment, namely Vaccinated. In addition, the opinions change according to\nthe majority-rule dynamics in groups with three individuals. We also consider\nthat the vaccine can give permanent or temporary immunization to the\nindividuals. By means of analytical calculations and computer simulations, we\nshow that the opinion dynamics can drastically affect the disease propagation,\nand that the engagement of the pro-vaccine individuals can be crucial for\nstopping the epidemic spreading. The full numerical code for simulate the model\nis available from the authors' webpage.\n", "  Galaxies and their dark matter halos populate a complicated filamentary\nnetwork around large, nearly empty regions known as cosmic voids. Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the\nalgorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.8$, we identify 87\nvoids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/$h$, and carry out a\nstacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of $4.4\\sigma$, the\nlensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field\nand hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics\nin the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the\nviability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.\n", "  3D print is a recently developed technique, for single-unit production, and\nfor structures that have been impossible to build previously. The current work\npresents a method to 3D print polymer bonded isotropic hard magnets with a\nlow-cost, end-user 3D printer. Commercially available isotropic NdFeB powder\ninside a PA11 matrix is characterized, and prepared for the printing process.\nAn example of a printed magnet with a complex shape that was designed to\ngenerate a specific stray field is presented, and compared with finite element\nsimulation solving the macroscopic Maxwell equations. For magnetic\ncharacterization, and comparing 3D printed structures with injection molded\nparts, hysteresis measurements are performed. To measure the stray field\noutside the magnet, the printer is upgraded to a 3D magnetic flux density\nmeasurement system. To skip an elaborate adjusting of the sensor, a simulation\nis used to calibrate the angles, sensitivity, and the offset of the sensor.\nWith this setup a measurement resolution of 0.05\\,mm along the z-axes is\nachievable. The effectiveness of our novel calibration method is shown.\n  With our setup we are able to print polymer bonded magnetic systems with the\nfreedom of having a specific complex shape with locally tailored magnetic\nproperties. The 3D scanning setup is easy to mount, and with our calibration\nmethod we are able to get accurate measuring results of the stray field.\n", "  Relativistic hydrodynamics has been quite successful in explaining the\ncollective behaviour of the QCD matter produced in high energy heavy-ion\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC. We briefly review the latest developments in the\nhydrodynamical modeling of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Essential\ningredients of the model such as the hydrodynamic evolution equations,\ndissipation, initial conditions, equation of state, and freeze-out process are\nreviewed. We discuss observable quantities such as particle spectra and\nanisotropic flow and effect of viscosity on these observables. Recent\ndevelopments such as event-by-event fluctuations, flow in small systems\n(proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions), flow in ultra central\ncollisions, longitudinal fluctuations and correlations and flow in intense\nmagnetic field are also discussed.\n", "  We show that the inclusion of nonlocal correlation effects in a variational\nwave function for the ground state of a topological Anderson lattice\nHamiltonian is capable of describing both topologically trivial insulating\nphases and nontrivial ones characterized by an indirect gap, as well as its\nclosure at the transition into a metallic phase. The method, though applied to\nan oversimplified model, thus captures the metallic and insulating states that\nare indeed observed in a variety of Kondo semiconductors, while accounting for\ntopologically nontrivial band structures.\n", "  We proposed and demonstrated a new approach for realizing spin orbit coupling\nwith ultracold atoms. We use orbital levels in a double well potential as\npseudospin states. Two-photon Raman transitions between left and right wells\ninduce spin-orbit coupling. This scheme does not require near resonant light,\nfeatures adjustable interactions by shaping the double well potential, and does\nnot depend on special properties of the atoms. A pseudospinor Bose-Einstein\ncondensate spontaneously acquires an antiferromagnetic pseudospin texture which\nbreaks the lattice symmetry similar to a supersolid.\n", "  Constructing a set of universal quantum gates is a fundamental task for\nquantum computation. The existence of noises, disturbances and fluctuations is\nunavoidable during the process of implementing quantum gates for most practical\nquantum systems. This paper employs a sampling-based learning method to find\nrobust control pulses for generating a set of universal quantum gates.\nNumerical results show that the learned robust control fields are insensitive\nto disturbances, uncertainties and fluctuations during the process of realizing\nuniversal quantum gates.\n", "  We study Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with 2+1 flavors with almost physical\nquark masses using the highly improved staggered quark action (HISQ). We\ncalculate the Polyakov loop in a wide temperature range, obtain the free energy\nand the entropy of a single static quark and discuss the QCD crossover region\nin detail. We show that the entropy has a peak close to the chiral crossover\nand consider the consequences for the deconfinement aspects of the crossover\nphenomena. We study the renormalized Polyakov loop susceptibilities and place\nthem into the context of the crossover. We also obtain a quantitative result\nfor the onset of weak coupling behavior at high temperatures.\n", "  We introduce a new kind of jet function: the semi-inclusive jet function\n$J_i(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$, which describes how a parton $i$ is transformed into a\njet with a jet radius $R$ and energy fraction $z = \\omega_J/\\omega$, with\n$\\omega_J$ and $\\omega$ being the large light-cone momentum component of the\njet and the corresponding parton $i$ that initiates the jet, respectively.\nWithin the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) we calculate\nboth $J_q(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$ and $J_g(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$ to the next-to-leading\norder (NLO) for cone and anti-k$_{\\rm T}$ algorithms. We demonstrate that the\nrenormalization group (RG) equations for $J_i(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$ follow exactly\nthe usual DGLAP evolution, which can be used to perform the $\\ln R$ resummation\nfor {\\it inclusive} jet cross sections with a small jet radius $R$. We clarify\nthe difference between our RG equations for $J_i(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$ and those\nfor the so-called unmeasured jet functions $J_i(\\omega_J, \\mu)$, widely used in\nSCET for {\\it exclusive} jet production. Finally, we present applications of\nthe new semi-inclusive jet functions to inclusive jet production in $e^+e^-$\nand $pp$ collisions. We demonstrate that single inclusive jet production in\nthese collisions shares the same short-distance hard functions as single\ninclusive hadron production, with only the fragmentation functions $D_i^h(z,\n\\mu)$ replaced by $J_i(z, \\omega_J, \\mu)$. This can facilitate more efficient\nhigher-order analytical computations of jet cross sections. We further match\nour $\\ln R$ resummation at both LL$_{R}$ and NLL$_{R}$ to fixed NLO results and\npresent the phenomenological implications for single inclusive jet production\nat the LHC.\n", "  We demonstrate that interactions can substantially undermine the\nfree-particle description of magnons in ferromagnets on geometrically\nfrustrated lattices. The anharmonic coupling, facilitated by the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a highly-degenerate two-magnon continuum\nyield a strong, non-perturbative damping of the high-energy magnon modes. We\nprovide a detailed account of the effect for the $S=1/2$ ferromagnet on the\nkagom\\'e lattice and propose further experiments.\n", "  Lead halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPI) have\noutstanding optical and electronic properties for photovoltaic applications,\nyet a full understanding of how this solution processable material works so\nwell is currently missing. Previous research has revealed that MAPI possesses\nmultiple forms of static disorder regardless of preparation method, which is\nsurprising in light of its excellent performance. Using high energy resolution\ninelastic X-ray (HERIX) scattering, we measure phonon dispersions in MAPI and\nfind direct evidence for another form of disorder in single crystals: large\namplitude anharmonic zone-edge rotational instabilities of the PbI_6 octahedra\nthat persist to room temperature and above, left over from structural phase\ntransitions that take place tens to hundreds of degrees below. Phonon\ncalculations show that the orientations of the methylammonium couple strongly\nand cooperatively to these modes. The result is a non-centrosymmetric,\ninstantaneous local structure, which we observe in atomic pair distribution\nfunction (PDF) measurements. This local symmetry breaking is unobservable by\nBragg diffraction, but can explain key material properties such as the\nstructural phase sequence, ultra low thermal transport, and large minority\ncharge carrier lifetimes despite moderate carrier mobility.\n", "  We report a systematic analysis of the performance of a widely used set of\nDirac-Fock pseudopotentials for quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We\nstudy each atom in the periodic table from hydrogen (Z=1) to mercury (Z=80),\nwith the exception of the 4f elements (57 <= Z <= 70). We demonstrate that\nghost states are a potentially serious problem when plane-wave basis sets are\nused in density functional theory (DFT) orbital-generation calculations, but\nthat this problem can be almost entirely eliminated by choosing the s channel\nto be local in the DFT calculation; the d channel can then be chosen to be\nlocal in subsequent QMC calculations, which generally leads to more accurate\nresults. We investigate the achievable energy variance per electron with\ndifferent levels of trial wave function and we determine appropriate plane-wave\ncutoff energies for DFT calculations for each pseudopotential. We demonstrate\nthat the so-called \"T-move\" scheme in diffusion Monte Carlo is essential for\nmany elements. We investigate the optimal choice of spherical integration rule\nfor pseudopotential projectors in QMC calculations. The information reported\nhere will prove crucial in the planning and execution of QMC projects involving\nbeyond-first-row elements.\n", "  Coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation produced by table-top\nhigh-harmonic generation (HHG) sources provides a wealth of possibilities in\nresearch areas ranging from attosecond physics to high resolution coherent\nimaging. However, it remains challenging to fully exploit the coherence of such\nsources for interferometry and Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS). This is\ndue to the need for a measurement system that is stable at the level of a\nwavelength fraction, yet allowing a controlled scanning of time delays. Here we\ndemonstrate XUV interferometry and FTS in the 17-55 nm wavelength range using\nan ultrastable common-path interferometer suitable for high-intensity laser\npulses that drive the HHG process. This approach enables the generation of\nfully coherent XUV pulse pairs with sub-attosecond timing variation, tunable\ntime delay and a clean Gaussian spatial mode profile. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of our XUV interferometer by performing spatially resolved FTS on\na thin film composed of titanium and silicon nitride.\n", "  We show that it is possible to construct observables to test the existence of\nnew physics in a model independent way for the $D^0\\rightarrow VV$ modes using\na time-dependent analysis of the neutral $D$ meson. We show that it is possible\nto identify whether the NP is due to decay, mixing or a combination of both. We\nalso provide numerical estimates for the polarization amplitudes for the\n$D^0\\rightarrow\\overline{K^{*0}}\\rho^0$ mode and show that our analysis is\nconsistent with the present data.\n", "  We compute the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha^2\\alpha_s^2)$ perturbative corrections to\ninclusive jet production in electron-nucleon collisions. This process is of\nparticular interest to the physics program of a future Electron Ion Collider\n(EIC). We include all relevant partonic processes, including deep-inelastic\nscattering contributions, photon-initiated corrections, and parton-parton\nscattering terms that first appear at this order. Upon integration over the\nfinal-state hadronic phase space we validate our results for the deep-inelastic\ncorrections against the known next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) structure\nfunctions. Our calculation uses the $N$-jettiness subtraction scheme for\nperforming higher-order computations, and allows for a completely differential\ndescription of the deep-inelastic scattering process. We describe the\napplication of this method to inclusive jet production in detail, and present\nphenomenological results for the proposed EIC. The NNLO corrections have a\nnon-trivial dependence on the jet kinematics and arise from an intricate\ninterplay between all contributing partonic channels.\n", "  In leptonic flavour models with discrete flavour symmetries, couplings\nbetween flavons and leptons can result in special flavour structures after they\ngain vacuum expectation values. At the same time, they can also contribute to\nthe other lepton-flavour-violating processes. We study the flavon-induced LFV\n3-body charged lepton decays and radiative decays and we take as example the\n$A_4$ discrete symmetry. In $A_4$ models, a $Z_3$ residual symmetry roughly\nholds in the charged lepton sector for the realisation of tri-bimaximal mixing\nat leading order. The only processes allowed by this symmetry are $\\tau^-\\to\n\\mu^+ e^- e^-, e^+ \\mu^- \\mu^-$, and the other 3-body and all radiative decays\nare suppressed by small $Z_3$-breaking effects. These processes also depend on\nthe representation the flavon is in, whether pseudo-real (case i) or complex\n(case ii). We calculate the decay rates for all processes for each case and\nderive their strong connection with lepton flavour mixing. In case i, sum rules\nfor the branching ratios of these processes are obtained, with typical examples\n$\\text{Br}(\\tau^-\\to \\mu^+ e^- e^-) \\approx \\text{Br}(\\tau^-\\to e^+ \\mu^-\n\\mu^-)$ and $\\text{Br}(\\tau^-\\to e^- \\gamma) \\approx \\text{Br}(\\tau^-\\to \\mu^-\n\\gamma)$. In case ii, we observe that the mixing between two $Z_3$-covariant\nflavons plays an important role. All processes are suppressed by charged lepton\nmasses and current experimental constraints allow the electroweak scale and the\nflavon masses to be around hundreds of GeV. Our discussion can be generalised\nin other flavour models with different flavour symmetries.\n", "  We compute the topological susceptibility of the SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in\nthe large-N limit with a percent level accuracy. This is achieved by measuring\nthe gradient-flow definition of the susceptibility at three values of the\nlattice spacing for N=3,4,5,6. Thanks to this coverage of parameter space, we\ncan extrapolate the results to the large-N and continuum limits with\nconfidence. Open boundary conditions are instrumental to make simulations\nfeasible on the finer lattices at the larger N.\n", "  We report the development of a forcefield capable of reproducing accurate\nlattice dynamics of metal-organic frameworks. Phonon spectra, thermodynamic and\nmechanical properties, such as free energies, heat capacities and bulk moduli,\nare calculated using the quasi-harmonic approximation to account for anharmonic\nbehaviour due to thermal expansion. Comparison to density functional theory\ncalculations of properties such as Gr$\\mathrm{\\ddot{u}}$neisen parameters, bulk\nmoduli and thermal expansion supports the accuracy of the derived forcefield\nmodel. Material properties are also reported in a full analysis of the lattice\ndynamics of an initial subset of structures including: MOF-5, IRMOF-10, UiO-66,\nUiO-67, NOTT-300, MIL-125, MOF-74 and MOF-650.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of distinguishing among different causal\nrelations starting from a limited set of marginals. Our main tool is the notion\nof adhesivity, that is, the extension of probability or entropies defined only\non subsets of variables, which provides additional independence constraints\namong them. Our results provide a criterion for recognizing which causal\nstructures are indistinguishable when only limited marginal information is\naccessible. Furthermore, the existence of such extensions greatly simplifies\nthe characterization of a marginal scenario, a result that facilitates the\nderivation of Bell inequalities both in the probabilistic and entropic\nframeworks, and the identification of marginal scenarios where classical,\nquantum, and postquantum probabilities coincide.\n", "  Interference of spin-up and spin-down eigenstates depicts spin rotation of\nelectrons, which is a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics and accepts\ntechnological challenges for the electrical spin manipulation. Here, we\nvisualize this coherent spin physics through laser spin- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy on a spin-orbital entangled surface-state of a\ntopological insulator. It is unambiguously revealed that the linearly polarized\nlaser can simultaneously excite spin-up and spin-down states and these quantum\nspin-basis are coherently superposed in photoelectron states. The superposition\nand the resulting spin rotation is arbitrary manipulated by the direction of\nthe laser field. Moreover, the full observation of the spin rotation displays\nthe phase of the quantum states. This presents a new facet of\nlaser-photoemission technique for investigation of quantum spin physics opening\nnew possibilities in the field of quantum spintronic applications.\n", "  Recently, it has been proposed that the butterfly velocity - a speed at which\nquantum information propagates - may provide a fundamental bound on diffusion\nconstants in dirty incoherent metals. We analytically compute the charge\ndiffusion constant and the butterfly velocity in charge-neutral holographic\nmatter with long wavelength \"hydrodynamic\" disorder in a single spatial\ndirection. In this limit, we find that the butterfly velocity does not set a\nsharp lower bound for the charge diffusion constant.\n", "  A gravitational theory of a scalar field non-minimally coupled with torsion\nand boundary term is considered with the aim to construct Lorentzian wormholes.\nGeometrical parameters including shape and redshift functions are obtained for\nthese solutions. We adopt the formalism of Noether Gauge Symmetry Approach in\norder to find symmetries, Lie brackets and invariants (conserved quantities).\nFurthermore by imposing specific forms of potential function, we are able to\ncalculate metric coefficients and discuss their geometrical behavior.\n", "  It is shown that the vacuum condensate induced by many phenomena behaves as a\nperfect fluid which, under particular conditions, has zero or negative\npressure. In particular, the condensates of thermal states, of fields in curved\nspace and of mixed particles have been analyzed. It is shown that the thermal\nstates with the cosmic microwave radiation temperature, the Unruh and the\nHawking radiations give negligible contributions to the critical energy density\nof the universe, while the thermal vacuum of the intercluster medium could\ncontribute to the dark matter, together with the vacuum energy of fields in\ncurved space-time and of mixed neutrinos. Moreover, a component of the dark\nenergy can be represented by the vacuum of axion-like particles mixed with\nphotons and superpartners of neutrinos. The formal analogy among the systems\ncharacterized by the condensates can open new scenarios in the possibility to\ndetect the dark components of the universe in table top experiments.\n", "  We present a semi-empirical effective Hamiltonian to capture effects of\ndisorder associated with Ba and Sr cations occupying $A$ sites in\n(Ba$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)TiO$_3$ on its ferroelectric phase transition. Averaging\nbetween the parameters of first-principles effective Hamiltonians of end\nmembers BaTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$, we include a term with an empirical parameter\nto capture the local polarization and strains arising from the difference\nbetween ionic radii of Ba and Sr. Using mixed-space molecular dynamics of the\neffective Hamiltonian, we determine $T$-dependent ferroelectric phase\ntransitions in (Ba$_{x}$Sr$_{1-x}$)TiO$_3$ which are in good agreement with\nexperiment. Our scheme of determination of semi-empirical parameters in\neffective Hamiltonian should be applicable to other perovskite-type\nferroelectric solid solutions.\n", "  We present a new method for detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)\nimprints of cosmic superstructures on the cosmic microwave background, based on\na matched filtering approach. The expected signal-to-noise ratio for this\nmethod is comparable to that obtained from the full cross-correlation, and\nunlike other stacked filtering techniques it is not subject to an a posteriori\nbias. We apply this method to Planck CMB data using voids and superclusters\nidentified in the CMASS galaxy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 12, and measure the ISW amplitude to be $A_\\mathrm{ISW}=1.64\\pm0.53$\nrelative to the $\\Lambda$CDM expectation, corresponding to a $3.1\\sigma$\ndetection. In contrast to some previous measurements of the ISW effect of\nsuperstructures, our result is in agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  Semileptonic $\\Lambda_b$ decays are investigated in the framework of the\nrelativistic quark model based on the quasipotential approach and the\nquark-diquark picture of baryons. The decay form factors are expressed through\nthe overlap integrals of the initial and final baryon wave functions. All\ncalculations are done without employing nonrelativistic and heavy quark\nexpansions. The momentum transfer dependence of the decay form factors is\nexplicitly determined in the whole accessible kinematical range without any\nextrapolations or model assumptions. Both the heavy-to-heavy\n$\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c\\ell\\nu_\\ell$ and heavy-to-light $\\Lambda_b\\to\np\\ell\\nu_\\ell$ decay branching fractions are calculated. The results agree\nwithin error bars with the experimental value of the branching fraction of the\n$\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda_c^+l^-\\bar\\nu_l$ decay. From the recent LHCb data on the\nratio of the branching fractions of the heavy-to-light and heavy-to-heavy\nsemileptonic $\\Lambda_b$ decays the ratio of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix elements $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|$ is obtained. It is consistent with the\ncorresponding ratio determined from the inclusive $B$ meson decays.\n", "  Magnetohydrostatic models of the solar atmosphere are often based on\nidealized analytic solutions because the underlying equations are too difficult\nto solve in full generality. Numerical approaches, too, are often limited in\nscope and have tended to focus on the two-dimensional problem. In this article\nwe develop a numerical method for solving the nonlinear magnetohydrostatic\nequations in three dimensions. Our method is a fixed-point iteration scheme\nthat extends the method of Grad and Rubin (Proc. 2nd Int. Conf. on Peaceful\nUses of Atomic Energy 31, 190, 1958) to include a finite gravity force. We\napply the method to a test case to demonstrate the method in general and our\nimplementation in code in particular.\n", "  In this work, electrically and thermally conductive poly (butylene\nterephthalate) nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ ring-opening\npolymerization of cyclic butylene terephthalate (CBT) in presence of a\ntin-based catalyst. One type of graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) and two different\ngrades of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were used. Furthermore, high temperature\nannealing treatment under vacuum at 1700{\\deg}C was carried out on both RGO to\nreduce their defectiveness and study the correlation between the\nelectrical/thermal properties of the nanocomposites and the nanoflakes\nstructure/defectiveness. The morphology and quality of the nanomaterials were\ninvestigated by means of electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,\nthermogravimetry and Raman spectroscopy. Thermal, mechanical and electrical\nproperties of the nanocomposites were investigated by means of rheology,\ndynamic mechanical thermal analysis, volumetric resistivity and thermal\nconductivity measurements. Physical properties of nanocomposites were\ncorrelated with the structure and defectiveness of nanoflakes, evidencing a\nstrong dependence of properties on nanoflakes structure and defectiveness. In\nparticular, a significant enhancement of both thermal and electrical\nconductivities was demonstrated upon the reduction of nanoflakes defectiveness.\n", "  Recently, Zhong et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 022337(2013)] investigated the\ndynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the presence of decoherence. We\nhere reform their results and propose two schemes to enhance and preserve the\nQFIs for a qubit system subjected to a decoherence noisy environment by\napplying $\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operators process. The proposed schemes are\nrelated to the $\\textit{prior}$ (or the $\\textit{post}$ ) non-Hermitian\noperator process corresponding to before (or after) the interest system suffers\nfrom decoherence, respectively. Resorting to the Bloch sphere representation,\nwe derive the exact analytical expressions of the QFIs with respect to the\namplitude parameter $\\theta$ and the phase parameter $\\phi$, and in detail\ninvestigate the influence of $\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters on\nthe QFIs. Compared with purity decoherence process (without non-Hermitian\noperator process), we find that the $\\textit{post non-Hermitian}$ operator\nprocess can potentially enhance and preserve the QFIs by choosing appropriate\n$\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters, while with the help of the\n$\\textit{prior non-Hermitian}$ operator process one could completely eliminate\nthe effect of decoherence to improve the parameters estimation. Finally, a\ngeneralized non-Hermitian operator parameters effect on the parameters\nestimation is also considered.\n", "  The purpose of this contribution is to initiate the study of integrable\ndeformations for different superstring theory formalisms that manifest the\nproperty of (classical) integrability. In this paper we choose the hybrid\nformalism of the superstring in the background AdS_{2}xS^{2} and explore in\ndetail the most immediate consequences of its lambda-deformation. The resulting\naction functional corresponds to the lambda-model of the matter part of the\nfairly more sophisticated pure spinor formalism, which is also known to be\nclassical integrable. In particular, the deformation preserves the\nintegrability and the one-loop conformal invariance of its parent theory, hence\nbeing a marginal deformation.\n", "  Superposition principle of wave function in multi-slit interference\nexperiment has been widely accepted by many quantum mechanics textbooks,\nhowever the expression ${\\psi _{AB}} = {\\psi _A} + {\\psi _B}$ does not strictly\nhold. The non-classical paths in Feynman path integral provide an explanation\nto the multi-path interference effect, and can be used to quantitatively\nanalyse the multi-slit interference effect. In this work, we apply quantities\nin Bohmian mechanics to the measurement of multi-order interference by\nanalysing the contribution of non-classical paths to Bohmian velocity in\nelectron's multi-slit interferometer. The result shows that the non-classical\npaths effect will cause a relative deviation of $10^{-3}$ in electron's Bohmian\nvelocity, which is observable by doing weak measurement similar to previous\nwork.\n", "  The present work starts by providing a clear identification of correlations\nbetween critical parameters ($T_c$, $P_c$, $\\rho_c$) and bulk quantities at\nzero temperature of relativistic mean-field models (RMF) presenting third and\nfourth order self-interactions in the scalar field $\\sigma$. Motivated by the\nnonrelativistic version of this RMF model, we show that effective nucleon mass\n($M^*$) and incompressibility ($K_o$), at the saturation density, are\ncorrelated with $T_c$, $P_c$, and $\\rho_c$, as well as, binding energy and\nsaturation density itself. We verify agreement of results with previous\ntheoretical ones regarding different hadronic models. Concerning recent\nexperimental data of the symmetric nuclear matter critical parameters, our\nstudy allows a prediction of $T_c$, $P_c$ and $\\rho_c$ compatible with such\nvalues, by combining them, through the correlations found, with previous\nconstraints related to $M^*$ and $K_o$. An improved RMF parametrization, that\nbetter agrees with experimental values for $T_c$, is also indicated.\n", "  We present high-contrast H-band polarized intensity (PI) images of the\ntransitional disk around the young solar-like star GM Aur. The near-infrared\ndirect imaging of the disk was derived by polarimetric differential imaging\nusing the Subaru 8.2-m Telescope and HiCIAO. An angular resolution and an inner\nworking angle of 0.\"07 and r~0.\"05, respectively, were obtained. We clearly\nresolved a large inner cavity, with a measured radius of 18+/-2 au, which is\nsmaller than that of a submillimeter interferometric image (28 au). This\ndiscrepancy in the cavity radii at near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths\nmay be caused by a 3-4M_Jup planet about 20 au away from the star, near the\nedge of the cavity. The presence of a near-infrared inner is a strong\nconstraint on hypotheses for inner cavity formation in a transitional disk. A\ndust filtration mechanism has been proposed to explain the large cavity in the\nsubmillimeter image, but our results suggest that this mechanism must be\ncombined with an additional process. We found that the PI slope of the outer\ndisk is significantly different from the intensity slope obtained from\nHST/NICMOS, and this difference may indicate the grain growth process in the\ndisk.\n", "  The enigmatic X-ray emission from the bright optical star, $\\gamma$\nCassiopeia, is a long-standing problem. $\\gamma$ Cas is known to be a binary\nsystem consisting of a Be-type star and a low-mass ($M\\sim 1\\,M_\\odot$)\ncompanion of unknown nature orbiting in the Be-disk plane. Here we apply the\nquasi-spherical accretion theory onto a compact magnetized star and show that\nif the low-mass companion of $\\gamma$ Cas is a fast spinning neutron star, the\nkey observational signatures of $\\gamma$ Cas are remarkably well reproduced.\nDirect accretion onto this fast rotating neutron star is impeded by the\npropeller mechanism. In this case, around the neutron star magnetosphere a hot\nshell is formed that emits thermal X-rays in qualitative and quantitative\nagreement with observed properties of the X-ray emission from $\\gamma$ Cas. We\nsuggest that $\\gamma$ Cas and its analogs constitute a new subclass of Be-type\nX-ray binaries hosting rapidly rotating neutron stars formed in supernova\nexplosions with small kicks. The subsequent evolutionary stage of $\\gamma$ Cas\nand its analogs should be the X Per-type binaries comprising low-luminosity\nslowly rotating X-ray pulsars. The model explains the enigmatic X-ray emission\nfrom $\\gamma$ Cas, and also establishes evolutionary connections between\nvarious types of rotating magnetized neutron stars in Be-binaries.\n", "  We develop a model free energy from an expansion that basically includes\ngraphs without loops. From this calculation, we derive the temperature\ndependence of the density (or specific volume), the typical time scale of the\n$\\alpha$-relaxation, and the heat capacity. From this, we argue that the glass\ntransition is dominated by the vicinity of a first order phase transition. The\nfluctuations, observable in principle as scattering, would support the findings\nand would increase in terms of amplitude close to the phase boundary (while the\nsize stays constant). This amplitude is connected to the cluster size, also\nintroduced in the cooperativity argument. Minor arguments about corrections\nfrom loops are discussed where we also might have found an argument for the\n\"Boson Peak\". The whole concept then bases on equilibrium arguments that are\ninhibited by -- to our view -- the fluctuations (high susceptibility) plus the\nhigh density that results in the strong growing of the cluster size.\n", "  A large $\\mu^-$ polarization was achieved in muonic Bi atoms with the help of\nthe strong hyperfine field in a polarized nuclear target. Using $^{209}$Bi\nnuclei polarized to ($59\\pm9$)% in ferromagnetic BiMn, we observed a $\\mu$-$e$\ndecay asymmetry of ($13.1\\pm3.9$)%, which gives $\\mu^-$ polarization per\nnuclear polarization equal to $-1.07\\pm 0.35$. This value is almost consistent\nwith $-0.792$ calculated for nuclei with spin $I= \\frac{9}{2}$ and a positive\nmagnetic moment under the assumption that the hyperfine interaction becomes\neffective in the lowest muonic states.\n", "  Binary and multiple star systems are a frequent outcome of the star formation\nprocess, and as a result, almost half of all sun-like stars have at least one\ncompanion star. Theoretical studies indicate that there are two main pathways\nthat can operate concurrently to form binary/multiple star systems: large scale\nfragmentation of turbulent gas cores and filaments or smaller scale\nfragmentation of a massive protostellar disk due to gravitational instability.\nObservational evidence for turbulent fragmentation on scales of $>$1000~AU has\nrecently emerged. Previous evidence for disk fragmentation was limited to\ninferences based on the separations of more-evolved pre-main sequence and\nprotostellar multiple systems. The triple protostar system L1448 IRS3B is an\nideal candidate to search for evidence of disk fragmentation. L1448 IRS3B is in\nan early phase of the star formation process, likely less than 150,000 years in\nage, and all protostars in the system are separated by $<$200~AU. Here we\nreport observations of dust and molecular gas emission that reveal a disk with\nspiral structure surrounding the three protostars. Two protostars near the\ncenter of the disk are separated by 61 AU, and a tertiary protostar is\ncoincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at a 183 AU separation. The\ninferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is $\\sim$1 M$_{sun}$,\nwhile the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of $\\sim$0.30\nM$_{\\sun}$. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of $\\sim$0.085\nM$_{sun}$. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears susceptible\nto disk fragmentation at radii between 150~AU and 320~AU, overlapping with the\nlocation of the tertiary protostar. This is consistent with models for a\nprotostellar disk that has recently undergone gravitational instability,\nspawning one or two companion stars.\n", "  We discuss effective field theories (EFTs) for the Higgs particle, which is\nnot necessarily the Higgs of the Standard Model. We distinguish two different\nconsistent expansions: EFTs that describe decoupling new-physics effects and\nEFTs that describe non-decoupling new-physics effects. We briefly discuss the\nfirst case, the SM-EFT. The focus of this thesis is on the non-decoupling EFTs.\nWe argue that the loop expansion is the consistent expansion in the second\ncase. We introduce the concept of chiral dimensions, equivalent to the loop\nexpansion. Using the chiral dimensions, we expand the electroweak chiral\nLagrangian up to next-to-leading order,\n$\\mathcal{O}(f^{2}/\\Lambda^{2})=\\mathcal{O}(1/16\\pi^{2})$.\n  We then compare the decoupling and the non-decoupling EFT. We also consider\nscenarios in which the new-physics sector is non-decoupling at a scale $f$, far\nabove the electroweak-scale $v$. We discuss the relevance of the resulting\ndouble expansion in $\\xi=v^{2}/f^{2}$ and $f^{2}/\\Lambda^{2}$ for the data\nanalysis at the LHC.\n  In the second part, we discuss the applications of the EFTs, especially of\nthe electroweak chiral Lagrangian. First, we connect the EFT with explicit\nmodels of new physics. We show how different regions of the parameter space of\nthe same model generate a decoupling and a non-decoupling EFT.\n  Second, we use the expansion at leading order to describe the current LHC\nHiggs data. We show how the current parametrization of the Higgs data, the\n$\\kappa$-framework, can be justified quantum field theoretically by the EFT. We\nfit the data of Run-1 (2010--2013). The effective Lagrangian describing this\ndata can be reduced to six free parameters. The result of this fit is\nconsistent with the SM, but it has statistical uncertainties of about ten\npercent.\n", "  We discuss diphoton semi(exclusive) production in ultraperipheral $PbPb$\ncollisions at energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 5.5 TeV (LHC). The nuclear\ncalculations are based on equivalent photon approximation in the impact\nparameter space. The cross sections for elementary $\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ subprocess are calculated including three different mechanisms: box\ndiagrams with leptons and quarks in the loops, a VDM-Regge contribution with\nvirtual intermediate hadronic excitations of the photons and the two-gluon\nexchange contribution (formally three-loops) to elastic photon-photon\nscattering in the high-energy approximation. We got relatively high cross\nsections in $PbPb$ collisions ($306$ nb). This opens a possibility to study the\n$\\gamma \\gamma \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ (quasi)elastic scattering at the LHC. We find\nthat the cross section for elastic $\\gamma\\gamma$ scattering could be measured\nin the lead-lead collisions for the diphoton invariant mass up to\n$W_{\\gamma\\gamma} \\approx 15-20$ GeV. We identify region(s) of phase space\nwhere the two-gluon exchange contribution becomes important ingredient compared\nto box and nonperturbative VDM-Regge mechanisms. We perform a similar analysis\nfor the $pp \\to pp\\gamma\\gamma$ reaction at energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7$ and\n$100$ TeV.\n", "  In the more recent literature on cosmological evolutions of the universe the\ncosmic vacuum energy has become a non-renouncable ingredient. The cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$, first invented by Einstein, but later also rejected by him,\npresently experiences an astonishing revival. Interestingly enough it acts,\nlike a constant vacuum energy density would also do. Namely, it has an\naccelerating action on cosmic dynamics without which, as it appears, presently\nobtained cosmological data cannot be conciliated with theory. As we are going\nto show in this review, however, the concept of a constant vacuum energy\ndensity is unsatisfactory for very basic reasons, since it would claim for a\nphysical reality that acts upon spacetime and matter dynamics without itself\nbeing acted upon by spacetime or matter.\n", "  The dielectric breakdown at metal-oxide interfaces is a critical electronic\ndevice failure mechanism. Electronic tunneling through dielectric layers is a\nwell-accepted explanation for this phenomenon. Theoretical band alignment\nstudies, providing information about tunneling, have already been conducted in\nthe literature for metal-oxide interfaces. However, most of the time materials\nwere assumed defect free. Oxygen vacancies being very common in oxides, their\neffect on band lineup is of prime importance in understanding electron\ntunneling in realistic materials and devices. This work explores the effect of\noxygen vacancy and oxygen di-vacancy at the Al/SiO2 interface on the band line\nup within Density Functional Theory using PBE0 hybrid exchange and correlation\nfunctional. It is found that the presence of defects at the interface, and\ntheir charge state, strongly alters the band line up.\n", "  The non-additive non-interacting kinetic energy is calculated exactly for\nfragments of H$_2$, Li$_2$, Be$_2$, C$_2$, N$_2$, F$_2$, and Na$_2$ within\npartition density-functional theory. The resulting fragments are uniquely\ndetermined and their sum reproduces the Kohn-Sham molecular density of the\ncorresponding XC functional. We compare the use of fractional orbital\noccupation to the usual PDFT ensemble method for treating the fragment energies\nand densities. We also compare Thomas-Fermi and von Weiz{\\\"a}cker approximate\nkinetic energy functionals to the numerically exact solution and find\nsignificant regions where the von Weiz{\\\"a}cker solution is nearly exact.\n", "  We describe the Phase-Contrast Imaging instrument at the Matter in Extreme\nConditions (MEC) endstation of the Linac Coherent Light Source. The instrument\ncan image phenomena with a spatial resolution of a few hundreds of nanometers\nand at the same time reveal the atomic structure through X-ray diffraction,\nwith a temporal resolution better than 100 femtosecond. It was specifically\ndesigned for studies relevant to High-Energy-Density Science and can monitor,\ne.g., shock fronts, phase transitions, or void collapses. This versatile\ninstrument was commissioned last year and is now available to the MEC user\ncommunity.\n", "  M87 is the best source in which to study a jet at high resolution in\ngravitational units because it has a very high mass black hole and is nearby.\nThe angular size of the black hole is second only to Sgr A*, which does not\nhave a strong jet. The jet structure is edge brightened with a wide opening\nangle base and a weak counterjet. We have roughly annual observations for 17\nyears plus intensive monitoring at three week intervals for a year and five day\nintervals for 2.5 months made with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43\nGHz. The inner jet shows very complex dynamics, with apparent motions both\nalong and across the jet. Speeds from zero to over 2c are seen, with\nacceleration observed over the first 3 milli-arcseconds. The counterjet\ndecreases in brightness much more rapidly than the main jet, as is expected\nfrom relativistic beaming in an accelerating jet oriented near the\nline-of-sight. Details of the structure and dynamics are discussed. The roughly\nannual observations show side-to-side motion of the whole jet with a\ncharacteristic time scale of about 9 years.\n", "  The no-cloning theorem states that an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned\nexactly and deterministically due to the linearity of quantum mechanics.\nAssociated with this theorem is the quantitative no-cloning limit that sets an\nupper bound to the quality of the generated clones. However, this limit can be\ncircumvented by abandoning determinism and using probabilistic methods. Here,\nwe report an experimental demonstration of probabilistic cloning of arbitrary\ncoherent states that clearly surpasses the no-cloning limit. Our scheme is\nbased on a hybrid linear amplifier that combines an ideal deterministic linear\namplifier with a heralded measurement-based noiseless amplifier. We demonstrate\nthe production of up to five clones with the fidelity of each clone clearly\nexceeding the corresponding no-cloning limit. Moreover, since successful\ncloning events are heralded, our scheme has the potential to be adopted in\nquantum repeater, teleportation and computing applications.\n", "  Space-science programs provide a wide range of application to a nation's key\nsectors of development: science-technology infrastructure, education, economy\nand national security. However, the cost of sustaining a space-science program\nhas discouraged developing nations from participating in space activities,\nwhile developed nations have steadily cut down their space-science budget in\npast decade. In this study I investigate the role of international cooperation\nin building ambitious space-science programs, particularly in the context of\ndeveloping nations. I devise a framework to quantify the impact of\ninternational collaborations in achieving the space-science goals as well as in\nenhancing the key sectors of development of a nation. I apply this framework on\ntwo case studies, (i) Indian Space Research Organization - a case of\nspace-science program from a developing nation that has historically engaged in\ninternational collaborations, and (ii) International Space Station - a case for\na long term collaboration between matured space-science programs. My study\nconcludes that international cooperation in space can significantly enhance\nscope of science goals, but has relatively little return of investment towards\nscience education and national security. I also highlight limitations of such\nspace diplomacy in the case of China and SAARC nations, and list criteria for\nfuture investigation and case studies.\n", "  Despite having outstanding electrical properties, graphene is unsuitable for\noptical devices because of its zero band gap. Here, we report two-dimensional\nexcitonic photoluminescence (PL) from graphene grown on Cu(111) surface, which\nshows an unexpected remarkably sharp and strong emission near 3.16 eV\n(full-width at half-maximum $\\leq$ 3meV) and multiple emissions around 3.18 eV.\nAs temperature increases, these emissions blue-shift, showing the\ncharacteristic negative thermal coefficient of graphene. Observed PLs originate\nfrom significantly suppressed dispersion of excited electrons in graphene\ncaused by hybridization of graphene $\\pi$ and Cu d orbitals of the 1st and 2nd\nCu layers at a shifted saddle point 0.525(M+K) of Brillouin zone. This finding\nprovides a new pathway to engineering novel optoelectronic graphene devices,\nwhilst maintaining the outstanding electrical properties of graphene.\n", "  We propose in this paper an effective low-energy theory for interacting\nfermion systems which supports exclusion statistics. The theory can be viewed\nas an extension of Landau Fermi liquid theory where besides quasi-particle\nenergy $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, the kinetic momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ of quasi-particles\ndepends also on quasi-particle occupation numbers as a result of momentum\n($k$)-dependent current-current interaction. The dependence of kinetic momentum\non quasi-particles excitations leads to change in density of states and\nexclusion statistics. The properties of this new Fermi liquid state is studied\nwhere we show that the state (which we call $U(1)$-Fermi liquid state) has\nFermi-liquid like properties except that the quasi-particles are {\\em not}\nadiabatically connected to bare fermions in the system and the state may not\nsatisfy Luttinger theorem.\n", "  The paper describes a novel concept for a low cost microfluidic platform\nutilizing materials and processes used in low cost thermal inkjet printing. The\nconcept re-purposes the jetting elements to create pumps, mixers, and valves\nall necessary components for the transport of fluids in a broad range of\nmicrofluidic applications.\n", "  A simplified theoretical model for free-electron laser oscillator (FELO)\nsimulation which reserves the main physics is proposed. In stead of using\ntraditional macro particles sampling method, the theoretical model takes\nadvantages of low gain theory to calculate the optical power single-pass gain\nin the undulator analytically, and some reasonable approximations are made to\nsimplify the calculation of power growth in the cavity. The theoretical\nanalysis of single-pass gain, power growth, time-dependent laser profile\nevolution and cavity desynchronism are accomplished more efficiently. We\npresent the results of infrared wavelength FELO and X-ray FELO with the new\nmodel. The results is checked by simulation with GENESIS and OPC which\ndemonstrates the validity of the theoretical model.\n", "  While topological superconductors are predicted to provide building blocks\nfor fault-tolerant quantum computing, one of the remaining challenges is to\nfind a convenient experimental platform that would allow patterning of\ncircuits. We find that superconductivity can be patterned directly into\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ nanostructures by selective doping with palladium (Pd).\nSuperconducting regions are defined by depositing Pd on top of the\nnanostructures using electron beam lithography, followed by in-situ annealing.\nElectrical transport measurements at low temperatures show either partial or\nfull superconducting transition, depending on the doping conditions. Structural\ncharacterization techniques indicate that Pd remains localized in the targeted\nareas, making it possible to pattern superconducting circuits of arbitrary\nshapes in this topological material.\n", "  The knife-edge method is an established technique for profiling of even\ntightly focused light beams. However the straightforward implementation of this\nmethod fails if the materials and geometry of the knife-edges are not chosen\ncarefully or in particular if knife-edges are used that are made of pure\nmaterials. In these cases artifacts are introduced in the shape and position of\nthe reconstructed beam profile due to the interaction of the light beam under\nstudy with the knife. Hence, corrections to the standard knife-edge evaluation\nmethod are required. Here we investigate the knife-edge method for highly\nfocused radially and azimuthally polarized beams and their linearly polarized\nconstituents. We introduce relative shifts for those constituents and report on\nthe consistency with the case of a linearly polarized Gaussian beam. An adapted\nknife-edge reconstruction technique is presented and proof-of-concept tests\ndemonstrating the reconstruction of beam profiles are shown.\n", "  The classical macroscopic Maxwell equations are approximated. They are a\ncorollary of the multipole expansion of the local electrostatic potential up to\ndipolar terms. But quadrupolarization of the medium should not be neglected if\nthe molecules which build up the medium possess large quadrupole moment or do\nnot have any dipole moment. If we include the quadrupolar terms in Maxwell\nequations we obtain the quadrupolar analogue of Poisson's equation: $\\nabla^2\n\\phi - L^2_Q\\nabla^4 \\phi = - \\rho / \\varepsilon$. This equation is of the\nfourth order and it requires not only the two classical boundary conditions but\nalso two additional ones: continuous electric field and the relation of the\njump of the normal quadrupolarizability at the surface to the intrinsic normal\nsurface dipole moment. The account of the quadrupole moment of the molecules\nleads to significant differences compared to the classical electrostatic\ntheory.\n", "  The application of deep sea low energy neutrino detection techniques to long\nbaseline neutrino physics is investigated, with a focus on a possible\nconfiguration based on a FNAL neutrino beam impinging a detector hosted by the\nNEPTUNE/OOI submarine observatories offshore of British Columbia.\n", "  The general eight-vertex model on a square lattice is studied numerically by\nusing the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method. The method is\ntested on the symmetric (zero-field) version of the model, the obtained\ndependence of critical exponents on model's parameters is in agreement with\nBaxter's exact solution and weak universality is verified with a high accuracy.\nIt was suggested longtime ago that the symmetric eight-vertex model is a\nspecial exceptional case and in the presence of external fields the\neight-vertex model falls into the Ising universality class. We confirm\nnumerically this conjecture in a subspace of vertex weights, except for two\nspecific combinations of vertical and horizontal fields for which the system\nstill exhibits weak universality.\n", "  These notes were delivered as a series of NIMROD lectures at the Rutherford\nAppleton Laboratory by the author in February 1976 (RL-76-022). The purpose of\nthese lectures was primarily two-fold: to discuss the classical theory of free\npoint particles, free strings and free membranes from a unified viewpoint; and\nto present in the process of doing this the rudiments of an intrinsic\ngeometrical calculus that the author has found of immense value in\ninvestigating these systems. It is shown how the equations of motion for such\nclassically extended relativistic systems arise in a very simple manner from a\nprinciple of stationary action and furthermore how the boundary conditions for\nfinite systems may be derived in a gauge invariant way. Momenta are naturally\nintroduced and the primary constraints that exist in a Hamiltonian description\nfollow simply. Calculations may proceed in an index-free manner until\ncomponents are required. It is at this stage that one can, if one desires,\nimpose gauge conditions and remove non-independent degrees of freedom. Such\nmethods can be applied in any spacetime of any dimension and metric, and\nexamples are given throughout.\n", "  Understanding ballistic effects caused by ion beam irradiation, and linking\nthem with induced structure can be a key point for controlling and predicting\nthe microstructure of irradiated materials. For this purpose, we have\ninvestigated ballistic effects from an ion mixing formalism point of view. The\ndisplacement cascades in copper and AgCu alloy were obtained using binary\ncollision approximation (BCA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We\nemployed BCA-based code MARLOWE for its ability to simulate high energy\ndisplacement cascades. A first set of simulations was performed using both\nmethods on pure copper for energies ranging from 0.5 keV to 20 keV. The results\nof BCA and MD simulations are compared, evidencing rationally parametrized\nMARLOWE to be predictive. A second set of simulations was then carried out\nusing BCA only. Following experimental studies, AgCu alloy was subjected to 1\nMeV krypton ions. MARLOW simulations are found to be in good agreement with\nexperimental results.\n", "  Spin transfer magnetization dynamics have led to considerable advances in\nSpintronics, including opportunities for new nanoscale radiofrequency devices.\nAmong the new functionalities is the radiofrequency(rf) detection using the\nspin diode rectification effect in spin torque nano-oscillators (STNOs). In\nthis study, we focus on a new phenomenon, the resonant expulsion of a magnetic\nvortex in STNOs. This effect is observed when the excitation vortex radius, due\nto spin torques associated to rf currents, becomes larger than the actual\nradius of the STNO. This vortex expulsion is leading to a sharp variation of\nthe voltage at the resonant frequency. Here we show that the detected frequency\ncan be tuned by different parameters; furthermore, a simultaneous detection of\ndifferent rf signals can be achieved by real time measurements with several\nSTNOs having different diameters. This result constitutes a first\nproof-of-principle towards the development of a new kind of nanoscale rf\nthreshold detector.\n", "  Structure-preserving integrators are in the focus of ongoing research because\nof their distinguished features of robustness and long time stability. In\nparticular, their formulation for coupled problems that include dissipative\nmechanisms is still an active topic. Conservative formulations, such as the\nthermo-elastic case without heat conduction, fit well into a variational\nframework and have been solved with variational integrators, whereas the\ninclusions of viscosity and heat transfer are still under investigation. To\nencompass viscous forces and heat transfer, an extension of Hamilton's\nprinciple is required. In this contribution we derive variational integrators\nfor thermo-viscoelastic systems with classical heat transfer. Their results are\ncompared for two discrete model problems vs. Energy-Entropy-Momentum methods.\nSuch comparisons allow to draw conclusions about their relative performance,\nweaknesses and strengths.\n", "  Many photonic quantum information processing applications would benefit from\na high brightness, fiber-coupled source of triggered single photons. Here, we\npresent a fiber-coupled photonic-crystal waveguide single-photon source relying\non evanescent coupling of the light field from a tapered out-coupler to an\noptical fiber. A two-step approach is taken where the performance of the\ntapered out-coupler is recorded first on an independent device containing an\non-chip reflector. Reflection measurements establish that the chip-to-fiber\ncoupling efficiency exceeds 80 %. The detailed characterization of a\nhigh-efficiency photonic-crystal waveguide extended with a tapered out-coupling\nsection is then performed. The corresponding overall single-photon source\nefficiency is 10.9 % $\\pm$ 2.3 %, which quantifies the success probability to\nprepare an exciton in the quantum dot, couple it out as a photon in the\nwaveguide, and subsequently transfer it to the fiber. The applied out-coupling\nmethod is robust, stable over time, and broadband over several tens of\nnanometers, which makes it a highly promising pathway to increase the\nefficiency and reliability of planar chip-based single-photon sources.\n", "  The paper provides a survey of results related to the \"$\\kappa$-generalized\ndistribution\", a statistical model for the size distribution of income and\nwealth. Topics include, among others, discussion of basic analytical\nproperties, interrelations with other statistical distributions as well as\naspects that are of special interest in the income distribution field, such as\nthe Gini index and the Lorenz curve. An extension of the basic model that is\nmost able to accommodate the special features of wealth data is also reviewed.\nThe survey of empirical applications given in this paper shows the\n$\\kappa$-generalized models of income and wealth to be in excellent agreement\nwith the observed data in many cases.\n", "  In memory of Guido Altarelli I present my personal recollections of the early\ntimes and his major role played in the development of QCD.\n", "  This paper provides a brief overview of the formation of stellar fossil\nmagnetic fields and what potential instabilities may occur given certain\nconfigurations of the magnetic field. In particular, a purely magnetic\ninstability can occur for poloidal, toroidal, and mixed poloidal-toroidal\naxisymmetric magnetic field configurations as originally studied in Tayler\n(1973), Markey & Tayler (1973), and Tayler (1980). However, most of the\nmagnetic field configurations observed at the surface of massive stars are non-\naxisymmetric. Thus, extending earlier studies of the axisymmetric Tayler\ninstability in spherical geometry (Goossens, 1980), we introduce a formulation\nfor the global change in the potential energy contained in a\nconvectively-stable region given an arbitrary Lagrangian perturbation, which\npermits the inclusion of both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric magnetic\nfields. With this tool in hand, a path is shown by which more general stability\ncriterion can be established.\n", "  Many uncertainty propagation software exist, written in different programming\nlanguages, but not all of them are able to handle functional correlation\nbetween quantities. In this paper we review one strategy to deal with\nuncertainty propagation of quantities that are functionally correlated, and\nintroduce a new software offering this feature: the Julia package\nMeasurements.jl. It supports real and complex numbers with uncertainty,\narbitrary-precision calculations, mathematical and linear algebra operations\nwith matrices and arrays.\n", "  Recent experimental work has determined that free falling $^{87}$Rb atoms on\nEarth, with vertically aligned spins, follow geodesics, thus apparently ruling\nout spin--gravitation interactions. It is showed that while some spinning\nmatter models coupled to gravitation referenced to in that work seem to be\nruled out by the experiment, those same experimental results confirm\ntheoretical results derived from a Lagrangian description of spinning particles\ncoupled to gravity constructed over forty years ago. A proposal to carry out\n(similar but) different experiments which will help to test the validity of the\nUniversality of Free Fall as opposed to the correctness of the aforementioned\nLagrangian theory, is presented.\n", "  Cross sections of alpha particle induced nuclear reactions have been measured\non thin natural cadmium targets foils in the energy range from 11 to 51.2 MeV.\nThis work was a part of our systematic study on excitation functions of light\nion induced nuclear reactions on different target materials. Regarding the\ncross sections, the alpha induced reactions are not deeply enough investigated.\nSome of the produced isotopes are of medical interest, others have application\nin research and industry. The radioisotope $^{117m}$Sn is a very important\ntheranostic (therapeutic + diagnostic) radioisotope, so special care was taken\nto the results for that isotope. The well-established stacked foil technique\nfollowed by gamma-spectrometry with HPGe gamma spectrometers were used. The\ntarget and monitor foils in the stack were commercial high purity metal foils.\nFrom the irradiated targets $^{117m}$Sn, $^{113}$Sn, $^{110}$Sn, $^{117m,g}$In,\n$^{116m}$In, $^{115m}$In, $^{114m}$In, $^{113m}$In, $^{111}$In, $^{110m,g}$In,\n$^{109m}$In, $^{108m}$In, $^{115g}$Cd and $^{111m}$Cd were identified and their\nexcitation functions were derived. The results were compared with the data of\nthe previous measurements from the literature and with the results of the\ntheoretical nuclear reaction model code calculations TALYS 1.8 (TENDL-2015) and\nEMPIRE 3.2 (Malta). From the cross section curves thick target yields were\ncalculated and compared with the available literature data.\n", "  Smooth model potentials with parameters selected to reproduce the spectrum of\none-electron atoms are used to approximate the singular Coulomb potential. Even\nwhen the potentials do not mimic the Coulomb singularity, much of the spectrum\nis reproduced within the chemical accuracy. For the Hydrogen atom, the smooth\napproximations to the Coulomb potential are more accurate for higher angular\nmomentum states. The transferability of the model potentials from an attractive\ninteraction (Hydrogen atom) to a repulsive one (Harmonium and the uniform\nelectron gas) is discussed.\n", "  It is well-known that there exist infinitely-many inequivalent\nrepresentations of the canonical (anti)-commutation relations of Quantum Field\nTheory (QFT). A way out, suggested by Algebraic QFT, is to instead define the\nquantum theory as encompassing all possible (abstract) states. In the present\npaper, we describe a quantization scheme for general linear (aka. free) field\ntheories that can be seen as intermediate between traditional Fock quantization\nand full Algebraic QFT, in the sense that:\n  * it provides a constructive, explicit description of the resulting space of\nquantum states;\n  * it does not require the choice of a polarization, aka. the splitting of\nclassical solutions into positive vs. negative-frequency modes: in fact, any\nFock representation corresponding to a \"reasonable\" choice of polarization is\nnaturally embedded;\n  * it supports the implementation of a \"large enough\" class of linear\nsymplectomorphisms of the classical, infinite-dimensional phase space.\n  The proposed quantization (like Algebraic QFT) is notably meant for use on\ncurved spacetimes, where the lack of a preferred choice of polarization makes\nthe introduction of a Fock representation problematic. Accordingly, we\nillustrate it in the simple case of a free Klein-Gordon field on a\nspatially-compact, cosmological spacetime.\n", "  We report a light-field based method that allows the optical encryption of\nthree-dimensional (3D) volumetric information at the microscopic scale in a\nsingle 2D light-field image. The system consists of a microlens array and an\narray of random phase/amplitude masks. The method utilizes a wave optics model\nto account for the dominant diffraction effect at this new scale, and the\nsystem point-spread function (PSF) serves as the key for encryption and\ndecryption. We successfully developed and demonstrated a deconvolution\nalgorithm to retrieve spatially multiplexed discrete and continuous volumetric\ndata from 2D light-field images. Showing that the method is practical for data\ntransmission and storage, we obtained a faithful reconstruction of the 3D\nvolumetric information from a digital copy of the encrypted light-field image.\nThe method represents a new level of optical encryption, paving the way for\nbroad industrial and biomedical applications in processing and securing 3D data\nat the microscopic scale.\n", "  The modern view, that there exists a preferred frame of reference related to\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB), is in apparent contradiction with the\nprinciples of special relativity. The purpose of the present study is to\ndevelop a counterpart of the special relativity theory that is consistent with\nthe existence of a preferred frame but, like the standard relativity theory, is\nbased on the relativity principle and universality of the (\\textit{two-way})\nspeed of light. In the framework developed, a degree of anisotropy of the\none-way velocity acquires meaning of a characteristic of the really existing\nanisotropy caused by motion of an inertial frame relative to the preferred\nframe. The anisotropic special relativity kinematics is developed based on the\nfirst principles: (1) Space-time transformations between inertial frames leave\nthe equation of anisotropic light propagation invariant and (2) A set of the\ntransformations possesses a group structure. The Lie group theory apparatus is\napplied to define groups of space-time transformations between inertial frames.\nApplying the consequences of the transformations to the problem of calculating\nthe CMB temperature distribution yields an equation in which the angular\ndependence coincides with that obtained on the basis of the standard relativity\ntheory but the mean temperature is corrected by the terms second order in the\nobserver velocity. From conceptual point of view, it eliminates the\ninconsistency of the usual approach when formulas of the standard special\nrelativity are applied to define effects caused by motion with respect to the\npreferred frame.\n", "  We present a precise computation of the topological susceptibility\n$\\chi_{_\\mathrm{YM}}$ of SU$(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit. The\ncomputation is done on the lattice, using high-statistics Monte Carlo\nsimulations with $N=3, 4, 5, 6$ and three different lattice spacings. Two major\nimprovements make it possible to go to finer lattice spacing and larger $N$\ncompared to previous works. First, the topological charge is implemented\nthrough the gradient flow definition; and second, open boundary conditions in\nthe time direction are employed in order to avoid the freezing of the\ntopological charge. The results allow us to extrapolate the dimensionless\nquantity $t_0^2\\chi_{_\\mathrm{YM}}$ to the continuum and large $N$ limits with\nconfidence. The accuracy of the final result represents a new quality in the\nverification of large $N$ scaling.\n", "  Tin doped indium oxide (ITO) thin films are being used extensively as\ntransparent conductors in several applications. In the present communication,\nwe report the electrical transport in DC magnetron sputtered ITO thin films in\nlow temperatures (25-300 K). The low temperature Hall effect and resistivity\nmeasurements reveal that the ITO thin films are moderately dis-ordered (kfl~1)\nand degenerate semiconductor. The transport of charge carriers in these\ndisordered ITO thin films takes place via the de-localized states. The disorder\neffects lead to the well- known metal-insulator transition; this transition is\nobserved at 110 K in ITO thin films. The metal-insulator behaviour is explained\nby the quantum correction to the conductivity (QCC); this approach is based on\nthe quantum-mechanical interference effects in the disordered systems. The\ninsulating behaviour is attributed to the combined effect of the weak\nlocalization and the electron-electron interactions.\n", "  Electrochromic devices, which dynamically change color under the applied\npotential, are widely studied because of its wide range of applications such as\nenergy-efficient smart windows, rear view mirrors and display devices etc. In\nthis study we are reporting four layer electrochromic device based on tungsten\noxide as a electrochromic layer and nafion membrane as a ionic conducting\nlayer. Nafion membranes are generally used in fuel cell applications because of\nits high ionic conductivity and high optical transparency which is suitable for\nelectrochromic device to attain higher efficiencies. We have prepared an\nelectrochromic device by sandwiching ITO coated glass and WO3 coated ITO thin\nfilm between nafion membrane. The overall structure of the device is\nGlass/ITO/WO3/Nafion/ITO/Glass. We deposited tungsten oxide thin films with\ndifferent thickness on ITO coated glass substrate at room temperature by using\nreactive DC Magnetron sputtering and we studied the performance of the\nelectrochromic device with the function of thickness. We have observed that\nelectrochromic efficiency is increasing with increase in the tungsten oxide\nlayer thickness. The efficiency of the device increased from 24.8 cm2/C to\n184.3 cm2/C.\n", "  We calculate exactly the quantum mechanical, temporal characteristic function\n$\\chi(\\eta)$ for a single-mode, degenerate parametric amplifier for a system in\nthe Gaussian state, viz., a displaced-squeezed thermal state. Knowledge of\n$\\chi(\\eta)$ allows only the determination of the time development of arbitrary\nfunctions of equal-time products of creation and annihilation photon operators.\nWe calculate, in particular, the fluctuations in photon number, quadrature\noperators, and quadrature variance. We contrast the very important difference\nbetween the nonclassicality criteria based on the one-time characteristic\nfunction $\\chi(\\eta)$ versus nonclassicality criteria based on the two-time,\nsecond-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ and show numerically that the\nnonclassicality criteria based on $\\chi(\\eta)$ does not determine the\nclassical/nonclassical behavior of $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$.\n", "  We discuss in detail a recently proposed hybrid particle-continuum scheme for\ncomplex fluids and evaluate it at the example of a confined homopolymer\nsolution in slit geometry. The hybrid scheme treats polymer chains near the\nimpenetrable walls as particles keeping the configuration details, and chains\nin the bulk region as continuous density fields. Polymers can switch\nresolutions on the fly, controlled by an inhomogeneous tuning function. By\nproperly choosing the tuning function, the representation of the system can be\nadjusted to reach an optimal balance between physical accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. The hybrid simulation reproduces the results of a\nreference particle simulation and is significantly faster (about a factor of\n3.5 in our application example).\n", "  The hydrogen abundances in DBA white dwarfs determined from optical or UV\nspectra have been reported to differ significantly in some studies. We revisit\nthis problem using our own model atmospheres and synthetic spectra, and present\na theoretical investigation of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line profile as a function of\neffective temperature and hydrogen abundance. We identify one possible solution\nto this discrepancy and show considerable improvement from a detailed analysis\nof optical and UV spectra of DBA stars.\n", "  Over the last decade block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR) has\nfound increasing use in large, publicly available codes and frameworks. SAMR\nframeworks have evolved along different paths. Some have stayed focused on\nspecific domain areas, others have pursued a more general functionality,\nproviding the building blocks for a larger variety of applications. In this\nsurvey paper we examine a representative set of SAMR packages and SAMR-based\ncodes that have been in existence for half a decade or more, have a reasonably\nsized and active user base outside of their home institutions, and are publicly\navailable. The set consists of a mix of SAMR packages and application codes\nthat cover a broad range of scientific domains. We look at their high-level\nframeworks, and their approach to dealing with the advent of radical changes in\nhardware architecture. The codes included in this survey are BoxLib, Cactus,\nChombo, Enzo, FLASH, and Uintah.\n", "  Cracks are created by massive breakage of molecular or atomic bonds. The\nlatter, in its turn, leads to the highly localized loss of material, which is\nthe reason why even closed cracks are visible by a naked eye. Thus, fracture\ncan be interpreted as the local material sink. Mass conservation is violated\nlocally in the area of material failure. We consider a theoretical formulation\nof the coupled mass and momenta balance equations for a description of\nfracture. Our focus is on brittle fracture and we propose a finite strain\nhyperelastic thermodynamic framework for the coupled mass-flow-elastic boundary\nvalue problem. The attractiveness of the proposed framework as compared to the\ntraditional continuum damage theories is that no internal parameters (like\ndamage variables, phase fields etc.) are used while the regularization of the\nfailure localization is provided by the physically sound law of mass balance.\n", "  Next generation radio telescopes, like the Square Kilometre Array, will\nacquire an unprecedented amount of data for radio astronomy. The development of\nfast, parallelisable or distributed algorithms for handling such large-scale\ndata sets is of prime importance. Motivated by this, we investigate herein a\nconvex optimisation algorithmic structure, based on primal-dual\nforward-backward iterations, for solving the radio interferometric imaging\nproblem. It can encompass any convex prior of interest. It allows for the\ndistributed processing of the measured data and introduces further flexibility\nby employing a probabilistic approach for the selection of the data blocks used\nat a given iteration. We study the reconstruction performance with respect to\nthe data distribution and we propose the use of nonuniform probabilities for\nthe randomised updates. Our simulations show the feasibility of the\nrandomisation given a limited computing infrastructure as well as important\ncomputational advantages when compared to state-of-the-art algorithmic\nstructures.\n", "  We give an outline of the anticipated physics program for a future electron\nion collider. The status and prospects for construction of such a device are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The \"GeV-excess\" of the diffuse gamma-rays in the halo is studied with a\ntemplate fit based on energy spectra for each possible process of gamma-ray\nemission. Such a fit allows to determine the background and signal\nsimultaneously, so the Galactic Disk can be included in the analysis. We find\nevidence that the \"excess\", characterised by a gamma-ray spectrum peaking at 2\nGeV, is much stronger in Molecular Clouds in the disk than the \"GeV-excess\"\nobserved up to now in the halo. The possible reason why the emissivity of\nMolecular Clouds peaks at 2 GeV are the energy losses and magnetic cutoffs\ninside MCs, thus depleting the low energy part of the CR spectra and shifting\nthe maximum of the gamma-ray spectra to higher energies. This peaking of the\nemissivity in Molecular Clouds at 2 GeV was clearly observed from the spectrum\nof the Central Molecular Zone, which dominates the emission in the inner few\ndegrees of the Galactic Centre.\n  Although the spectrum of the Central Molecular Zone peaks at 2 GeV, it cannot\nbe responsible for the \"GeV-excess\" observed in the halo, since the latitude\nextension of the Zone is below $\\rm |b|<0.5^\\circ$. However, lines-of-sight\ninto the halo cross Molecular Clouds in the disk, so the emissivity of clouds\nin the disk will be observed in the halo as an apparent \"GeV-excess\". The fact,\nthat this \"GeV-excess\" has the same morphology in the disk {\\it and} in the\nhalo as the column density of Molecular Clouds, as traced by the CO map from\nthe Planck satellite resembling an NFW-like latitude profile, and the fact the\nMCs have an emissivity peaking at 2 GeV shows that the \"GeV-excess\" originates\nfrom Molecular Clouds in the disk, not from a process surrounding the Galactic\nCentre.\n", "  The recent progress in high-spatial-resolution techniques, spanning\nwavelengths from the visual to the radio regime, is leading to new valuable\ninsights into the complex dynamical atmospheres of Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) stars and their wind forming regions. Striking examples are images of\nasymmetries and inhomogeneities in the photospheric and dust-forming layers\nwhich vary on time-scales of months. These features are probably related to\nlarge-scale convective flows predicted by 3D star-in-a-box models. Furthermore,\nhigh-resolution observations make it possible to measure dust condensation\ndistances, and they give information about the chemical composition and sizes\nof dust grains in the close vicinity of cool giants. These are essential\nconstraints for building realistic models of wind acceleration and developing a\npredictive theory of mass loss for AGB stars, which is a crucial ingredient of\nstellar and galactic chemical evolution models.\n", "  We propose a topological plasmonic crystal structure composed of an array of\nparallel nanowires with unequal spacing. In the paraxial approximation, the\nHelmholtz equation that describes the propagation of light along the nanowires\nmaps onto the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model.\nUsing full three-dimensional finite difference time domain solution of the\nMaxwell equations we demonstrate the existence of topological defect modes,\nwith sub-wavelength localization, bound to kinks of the plasmonic crystal.\nFurthermore, we show that by manipulating kinks we can construct spatial mode\nfilters, that couple bulk modes to topological defect modes, and topological\nbeam-splitters that couple two topological defect modes. Finally, we show that\nthe structures are robust to fabrication errors with inverse length-scale\nsmaller than the topological band gap.\n", "  A solid state emitter coupled to a photonic crystal cavity exhibits increased\nphoton emission into a single frequency mode. However, current designs for\nphotonic crystal cavities coupled to quantum emitters have three main problems:\nemitters are placed near surfaces that can degrade their optical properties,\nthe cavity fluorescence cannot be collected into a single useful mode for\nfurther routing, and post-fabrication tuning is not currently possible in a\nstable and reversible manner for each node individually. In this paper, we\nintroduce a hybrid cavity design with minimal fabrication of the host material\nthat keeps the emitter $\\geq100\\,$nm from all surfaces. This cavity has an\nunloaded quality factor ($Q$) larger than $1\\times10^6$ and a loaded $Q$ of\n$5.5\\times10^4$ with more than 75% of the emission coupled directly into an\nunderlying photonic integrated circuit built from a convenient material that\nprovides low loss waveguides. Finally this design can be actively and\nreversibly tuned onto resonance with the emitter, allowing tuning over more\nthan 10 times the cavity linewidth while maintaining $\\geq50$% of the $Q$\nfactor with no effects to other cavities on the same chip.\n", "  We briefly summarize the current status of driven solid-state and cold-atom\nsystems, and introduce articles compiled in the Focus Section in Zeitschrift\nf\\\"ur Naturforschung A, Volume 71, Issue 10 (2016)\n", "  The derivation of path integrals is reconsidered. It is shown that the\nexpression for the discretized action is not unique, and the path integration\ndomain can be deformed so that at least Gaussian path integrals become\nprobabillistic. This leads to a practical algorithm of sign-problem-free Monte\nCarlo sampling from the Gaussian path integrals. Moreover, the dynamical\ninfluence of Gaussian quantum system (the bath) on any other quantum system can\nbe exactly represented as interaction with classical non-Markovian noise. We\ndiscuss the relation of these findings to the Bell's theorem and the Feynman's\nconjecture on the exponential complexity of the classical simulation of quantum\nsystems. In Feynman's path integral we have quasiprobability distributions for\ntrajectories, and in analitycally continued path integrals we have probability\ndistributions for quasitrajectories.\n", "  In this paper exact 1D transparent boundary conditions (TBC) for the 2D\nparabolic wave equation with a linear or a quadratic dependence of the\ndielectric permittivity on the transversal coordinate are reported. Unlike the\npreviously derived TBCs they contain only elementary functions. The obtained\nboundary conditions can be used to numerically solve the 2D parabolic equation\ndescribing the propagation of light in weakly bent optical waveguides and\nfibers including waveguides with variable curvature. They also are useful when\nsolving the equivalent 1D Schr\\\"odinger equation with a potential depending\nlinearly or quadratically on the coordinate. The prospects and problems of\ndiscretization of the derived transparent boundary conditions are discussed.\n", "  The edge Hall conductivity is shown to be an integer multiple of $e^2/h$\nwhich is almost surely independent of the choice of the disordered\nconfiguration. Its equality to the bulk Hall conductivity given by the\nKubo-Chern formula follows from K-theoretic arguments. This leads to\nquantization of the Hall conductance for any redistribution of the current in\nthe sample. It is argued that in experiments at most a few percent of the total\ncurrent can be carried by edge states.\n", "  In the context of quantum field theory (QFT), we compute the amplitudes of\nweak interaction processes such as $ W^{+} \\rightarrow e^{+} + \\nu_{e}$ and $\nW^{+} \\rightarrow e^{+} + \\nu_{\\mu}$ by using different representations of\nflavor states for mixed neutrinos. Analyzing the short time limit of the above\namplitudes, we find that the neutrino states defined in QFT as eigenstates of\nthe flavor charges lead to results consistent with lepton charge conservation.\nOn the contrary, the Pontecorvo flavor states produce a violation of lepton\ncharge in the vertex, which is in contrast with what expected at tree level in\nthe Standard Model.\n", "  We report on the recent result that the non--perturbative vacuum structure\nassociated with neutrino mixing leads to a non--zero contribution to the value\nof the cosmological constant. Its value is estimated by using the natural\ncut--off appearing in the quantum field theory formalism for neutrino mixing.\n", "  It is proven that the inverse localization length of an Anderson model on a\nstrip of width $L$ is bounded above by $L/\\lambda^2$ for small values of the\ncoupling constant $\\lambda$ of the disordered potential. For this purpose, a\nformalism is developed in order to calculate the bottom Lyapunov exponent\nassociated with random products of large symplectic matrices perturbatively in\nthe coupling constant of the randomness.\n", "  The boundary map in K-theory arising from the Wiener-Hopf extension of a\ncrossed product algebra with R is the Connes-Thom isomorphism. In this article\nthe Wiener Hopf extension is combined with the Heisenberg group algebra to\nprovide an elementary construction of a corresponding map on higher traces (and\ncyclic cohomology). It then follows directly from a non-commutative Stokes\ntheorem that this map is dual w.r.t.Connes' pairing of cyclic cohomology with\nK-theory. As an application, we prove equality of quantized bulk and edge\nconductivities for the integer quantum Hall effect described by continuous\nmagnetic Schroedinger operators.\n", "  A method is presented for proving upper bounds on the moments of the position\noperator when the dynamics of quantum wavepackets is governed by a random\n(possibly correlated) Jacobi matrix. As an application, one obtains sharp upper\nbounds on the diffusion exponents for random polymer models, coinciding with\nthe lower bounds obtained in a prior work. The second application is an\nelementary argument (not using multiscale analysis or the Aizenman-Molchanov\nmethod) showing that under the condition of uniformly positive Lyapunov\nexponents, the moments of the position operator grow at most logarithmically in\ntime.\n", "  A selfadjoined block tridiagonal matrix with positive definite blocks on the\noff-diagonals is by definition a Jacobi matrix with matrix entries. Transfer\nmatrix techniques are extended in order to develop a rotation number\ncalculation for its eigenvalues. This is a matricial generalization of the\noscillation theorem for the discrete analogues of Sturm-Liouville operators.\nThe three universality classes of time reversal invariance are dealt with by\nimplementing the corresponding symmetries. For Jacobi matrices with random\nmatrix entries, this leads to a formula for the integrated density of states\nwhich can be calculated perturbatively in the coupling constant of the\nrandomness with an optimal control on the error terms.\n"]}
