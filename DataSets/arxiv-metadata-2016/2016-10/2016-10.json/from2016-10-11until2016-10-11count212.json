Using a phenomenological theory for modulated and\nlocalized states in chiral magnets, the equilibrium parameters of the Skyrmion\nand helical states are derived as functions of the applied magnetic field and\ninduced uniaxial anisotropy. These results show that due to a combined effect\nof induced uniaxial anisotropy and an applied magnetic field Skyrmion lattices\ncan be formed as thermodynamically stable states in large intervals of magnetic\nfield and temperatures in cubic helimagnets, e.g., in intermetallic compounds\nMnSi, FeGe, (Fe,Co)Si. We argue that this mechanism is responsible for the\nformation of Skyrmion states recently observed in thin layers of\nFe_{0.5}Co_{0.5}Si [X.Z.Yu et al., Nature \\textbf{465}(2010) 901].\n", "  Vortex states in magnetic nanodisks are essentially affected by\nsurface/interface induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Within a\nmicromagnetic approach we calculate the equilibrium sizes and shape of the\nvortices as functions of magnetic field, the material and geometrical\nparameters of nanodisks. It was found that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling\ncan considerably increase sizes of vortices with \"right\" chirality and suppress\nvortices with opposite chirality. This allows to form a bistable system of\nhomochiral vortices as a basic element for storage applications.\n", "  Graph states are an elegant and powerful quantum resource for measurement\nbased quantum computation (MBQC). They are also used for many quantum protocols\n(error correction, secret sharing, etc.). The main focus of this paper is to\nprovide a structural characterisation of the graph states that can be used for\nquantum information processing. The existence of a gflow (generalized flow) is\nknown to be a requirement for open graphs (graph, input set and output set) to\nperform uniformly and strongly deterministic computations. We weaken the gflow\nconditions to define two new more general kinds of MBQC: uniform\nequiprobability and constant probability. These classes can be useful from a\ncryptographic and information point of view because even though we cannot do a\ndeterministic computation in general we can preserve the information and\ntransfer it perfectly from the inputs to the outputs. We derive simple graph\ncharacterisations for these classes and prove that the deterministic and\nuniform equiprobability classes collapse when the cardinalities of inputs and\noutputs are the same. We also prove the reversibility of gflow in that case.\nThe new graphical characterisations allow us to go from open graphs to graphs\nin general and to consider this question: given a graph with no inputs or\noutputs fixed, which vertices can be chosen as input and output for quantum\ninformation processing? We present a characterisation of the sets of possible\ninputs and ouputs for the equiprobability class, which is also valid for\ndeterministic computations with inputs and ouputs of the same cardinality.\n", "  A mechanism for proton acceleration to ~10^21eV is suggested. It may operate\nin accretion flows onto thin dark matter filaments of cosmic structure\nformation. The flow compresses the ambient magnetic field to strongly increase\nand align it with the filament. Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB\ndrift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited\nby the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the\nfilament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the\nparticle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'\nregime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit\n$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius\n$R$ (Larmor radius). The periodic orbit becomes unstable and the particle\nslings out of the filament to the region of a weak (uncompressed) magnetic\nfield, which terminates the acceleration.\n  The mechanism requires pre-acceleration that is likely to occur in structure\nformation shocks upstream or nearby the filament accretion flow. Previous\nstudies identify such shocks as efficient proton accelerators to a firm upper\nlimit ~10^19.5 eV placed by the catastrophic photo-pion losses. The present\nmechanism combines explosive energy gain in its final (betatron) phase with\nprompt particle release from the region of strong magnetic field. It is this\ncombination that allows protons to overcome both the photo-pion and the\nsynchrotron-Compton losses and therefore attain energy 10^21 eV. A requirement\non accelerator to reach a given E_max placed by the accelerator energy\ndissipation \\propto E_{max}^{2}/Z_0 due to the finite vacuum impedance Z_0 is\ncircumvented by the cyclic operation of the accelerator.\n", "  We introduce a new family of quantum secret sharing protocols with limited\nquantum resources which extends the protocols proposed by Markham and Sanders\nand by Broadbent, Chouha, and Tapp. Parametrized by a graph G and a subset of\nits vertices A, the protocol consists in: (i) encoding the quantum secret into\nthe corresponding graph state by acting on the qubits in A; (ii) use a\nclassical encoding to ensure the existence of a threshold. These new protocols\nrealize ((k,n)) quantum secret sharing i.e., any set of at least k players\namong n can reconstruct the quantum secret, whereas any set of less than k\nplayers has no information about the secret. In the particular case where the\nsecret is encoded on all the qubits, we explore the values of k for which there\nexists a graph such that the corresponding protocol realizes a ((k,n)) secret\nsharing. We show that for any threshold k> n-n^{0.68} there exists a graph\nallowing a ((k,n)) protocol. On the other hand, we prove that for any k<\n79n/156 there is no graph G allowing a ((k,n)) protocol. As a consequence there\nexists n_0 such that the protocols introduced by Markham and Sanders admit no\nthreshold k when the secret is encoded on all the qubits and n>n_0.\n", "  In shock precursors populated by accelerated cosmic rays (CR), the CR return\ncurrent instability is believed to significantly enhance the pre-shock\nperturbations of magnetic field. We have obtained fully-nonlinear exact ideal\nMHD solutions supported by the CR return current. The solutions occur as\nlocalized spikes of circularly polarized Alfven envelopes (solitons, or\nbreathers). As the conventional (undriven) solitons, the obtained magnetic\nspikes propagate at a speed $C$ proportional to their amplitude,\n$C=C_{A}B_{{\\rm max}}/\\sqrt{2}B_{0}$. The sufficiently strong solitons run thus\nahead of the main shock and stand in the precursor, being supported by the\nreturn current. This property of the nonlinear solutions is strikingly\ndifferent from the linear theory that predicts non-propagating (that is,\nconvected downstream) circularly polarized waves. The nonlinear solutions may\ncome either in isolated pulses (solitons) or in soliton-trains (cnoidal waves).\nThe morphological similarity of such quasi-periodic soliton chains with\nrecently observed X-ray stripes in Tycho supernova remnant (SNR) is briefly\ndiscussed. The magnetic field amplification determined by the suggested\nsaturation process is obtained as a function of decreasing SNR blast wave\nvelocity during its evolution from the ejecta-dominated to the Sedov-Taylor\nstage.\n", "  A weak odd dominated (WOD) set in a graph is a subset B of vertices for which\nthere exists a distinct set of vertices C such that every vertex in B has an\nodd number of neighbors in C. We point out the connections of weak odd\ndomination with odd domination, [sigma,rho]-domination, and perfect codes. We\nintroduce bounds on \\kappa(G), the maximum size of WOD sets of a graph G, and\non \\kappa'(G), the minimum size of non WOD sets of G. Moreover, we prove that\nthe corresponding decision problems are NP-complete. The study of weak odd\ndomination is mainly motivated by the design of graph-based quantum secret\nsharing protocols: a graph G of order n corresponds to a secret sharing\nprotocol which threshold is \\kappa_Q(G) = max(\\kappa(G), n-\\kappa'(G)). These\ngraph-based protocols are very promising in terms of physical implementation,\nhowever all such graph-based protocols studied in the literature have\nquasi-unanimity thresholds (i.e. \\kappa_Q(G)=n-o(n) where n is the order of the\ngraph G underlying the protocol). In this paper, we show using probabilistic\nmethods, the existence of graphs with smaller \\kappa_Q (i.e. \\kappa_Q(G)<\n0.811n where n is the order of G). We also prove that deciding for a given\ngraph G whether \\kappa_Q(G)< k is NP-complete, which means that one cannot\nefficiently double check that a graph randomly generated has actually a\n\\kappa_Q smaller than 0.811n.\n", "  The graph state formalism offers strong connections between quantum\ninformation processing and graph theory. Exploring these connections, first we\nshow that any graph is a pivot-minor of a planar graph, and even a pivot minor\nof a triangular grid. Then, we prove that the application of measurements in\nthe (X,Z)-plane over graph states represented by triangular grids is a\nuniversal measurement-based model of quantum computation. These two results are\nin fact two sides of the same coin, the proof of which is a combination of\ngraph theoretical and quantum information techniques.\n", "  The local minimum degree of a graph is the minimum degree reached by means of\na series of local complementations. In this paper, we investigate on this\nquantity which plays an important role in quantum computation and quantum error\ncorrecting codes. First, we show that the local minimum degree of the Paley\ngraph of order p is greater than sqrt{p} - 3/2, which is, up to our knowledge,\nthe highest known bound on an explicit family of graphs. Probabilistic methods\nallows us to derive the existence of an infinite number of graphs whose local\nminimum degree is linear in their order with constant 0.189 for graphs in\ngeneral and 0.110 for bipartite graphs. As regards the computational complexity\nof the decision problem associated with the local minimum degree, we show that\nit is NP-complete and that there exists no k-approximation algorithm for this\nproblem for any constant k unless P = NP.\n", "  The proof of cosmic ray (CR) origin in supernova remnants (SNR) must hinge on\nfull consistency of the CR acceleration theory with the observations; direct\nproof is impossible because of the orbit stochasticity of CR particles. Recent\nobservations of a number of galactic SNR strongly support the SNR-CR connection\nin general and the Fermi mechanism of CR acceleration, in particular. However,\nmany SNR expand into weakly ionized dense gases, and so a significant revision\nof the mechanism is required to fit the data. We argue that strong ion-neutral\ncollisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the energy\nspectrum of accelerated particles by \\emph{exactly one power}. The spectral\nbreak is caused by a partial evanescence of Alfven waves that confine particles\nto the accelerator. The gamma-ray spectrum generated in collisions of the\naccelerated protons with the ambient gas is also calculated. Using the recent\nFermi spacecraft observation of the SNR W44 as an example, we demonstrate that\nthe parent proton spectrum is a classical test particle power law $\\propto\nE^{-2}$, steepening to $E^{-3}$ at $E_{br}\\approx7GeV$.\n", "  Supernova remnants (SNRs), as the major contributors to the galactic cosmic\nrays (CR), are believed to maintain an average CR spectrum by diffusive shock\nacceleration (DSA) regardless of the way they release CRs into the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). However, the interaction of the CRs with nearby gas clouds\ncrucially depends on the release mechanism. We call into question two aspects\nof a popular paradigm of the CR injection into the ISM, according to which they\npassively and isotropically diffuse in the prescribed magnetic fluctuations as\ntest particles. First, we treat the escaping CR and the Alfven waves excited by\nthem on an equal footing. Second, we adopt field aligned CR escape outside the\nsource, where the waves become weak. An exact analytic self-similar solution\nfor a CR \"cloud\" released by a dimmed accelerator strongly deviates from the\ntest-particle result. The CR diffusion coefficient $D_{NL}$ is strongly\nsuppressed compared to its background ISM value $D_{ISM}$: $D_{NL}\\sim\nD_{ISM}\\exp(-\\Pi)<< D_{ISM}$ for sufficiently high field-line-integrated CR\npartial pressure, $\\Pi$. When $\\Pi>>1$, the CRs drive Alfven waves efficiently\nenough to build a transport barrier that strongly reduces the leakage. The\nsolution has a spectral break at $p=p_{br}$, where $p_{br}$ satisfies the\nfollowing equation $D_{NL}(p_{br})\\simeq z^{2}/t$.\n", "  Our understanding of the universe at large and small scales relies largely on\nelectromagnetic observations. As photons are the messengers, fundamental\nphysics has a concern in testing their properties, including the absence of\nmass. We use Cluster four spacecraft data in the solar wind at 1 AU to estimate\nthe mass upper limit for the photon. We look for deviations from Amp\\`ere's\nlaw, through the curlometer technique for the computation of the magnetic\nfield, and through the measurements of ion and electron velocities for the\ncomputation of the current. We show that the upper bound for $m_\\gamma$ lies\nbetween $1.4 \\times 10^{-49}$ and $3.4 \\times 10^{-51}$ kg, and thereby discuss\nthe currently accepted lower limits in the solar wind.\n", "  We give graphical characterisation of the access structure to both classical\nand quantum information encoded onto a multigraph defined for prime dimension\n$q$, as well as explicit decoding operations for quantum secret sharing based\non graph state protocols. We give a lower bound on $k$ for the existence of a\n$((k,n))_q$ scheme and prove, using probabilistic methods, that there exists\n$\\alpha$ such that a random multigraph has an accessing parameter $k\\leq \\alpha\nn$ with high probability.\n", "  We present a first-principles investigation of structural and elastic\nproperties of experimentally observed phases of bulk SrRuO$_3$ - namely\northorhombic, tetragonal, and cubic - by applying density functional theory\n(DFT) approximations. At first, we focus our attention on the accuracy of\ncalculated lattice constants in order to find out DFT approaches that best\nrepresent the crystalline structure of SrRuO$_3$, since many important physical\nquantities crucially depend on change in volume. Next, we evaluate\nsingle-crystal elastic constants, mechanical stability, and macroscopic elastic\nparameters trying to at least partially compensate for the existing lack of\ninformation about these fundamental features of SrRuO$_3$. Finally, we analyze\nthe anomalous behavior of low-temperature orthorhombic phase under $C_{44}$\nrelated shear deformation. It turns out that at critical strain values the\nsystem exhibits a distinct deviation from the initial behavior which results in\nan isosymmetric phase transition. Moreover, under $C_{44}$ related shear\ndeformation tetragonal SrRuO3 becomes mechanically unstable raising an open\nquestion of what makes it experimentally observable at high temperatures.\n", "  The magnetic field effect on phase transitions in electrically neutral\nbosonic systems is much less studied than those in fermionic systems, such as\nsuperconducting or ferromagnetic phase transitions. Nevertheless, composite\nbosons are strongly sensitive to magnetic fields: both their internal structure\nand motion as whole particles may be affected. A joint effort of ten\nlaboratories has been focused on studies of polariton lasers, where\nnon-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensates of bosonic quasiparticles,\nexciton-polaritons, may appear or disappear under an effect of applied magnetic\nfields. Polariton lasers based on pillar or planar microcavities were excited\nboth optically and electrically. In all cases a pronounced dependence of the\nonset to lasing on the magnetic field has been observed. For the sake of\ncomparison, photon lasing (lasing by an electron-hole plasma) in the presence\nof a magnetic field has been studied on the same samples as polariton lasing.\nThe threshold to photon lasing is essentially governed by the excitonic Mott\ntransition which appears to be sensitive to magnetic fields too. All the\nobserved experimental features are qualitatively described within a uniform\nmodel based on coupled diffusion equations for electrons, holes and excitons\nand the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for exciton-polariton condensates. Our\nresearch sheds more light on the physics of non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein\ncondensates and the results manifest high potentiality of polariton lasers for\nspin-based quantum logic applications.\n", "  In order to study the background status in the ATF2 beam line and the\ninteraction point (IP), this paper developed an analytical method to give the\nestimation of ATF beam halo distribution based on K. Hirata and K. Yokoya's\ntheory. The equilibrium particle distribution of beam tail in ATF damping ring,\nwhen each electron is being affected by, in addition to the synchrotron\nradiation damping effects, several stochastic processes, such as beam-gas\nscattring, beam-gas bremsstrahlung and intra-beam scattering, was presented.\nThis method is common and can be applied on other electron rings.\n", "  A formalism using a double Laplace Fourier transform of the transport\nequation yields the return probabilities of the vacancy in the vicinity of the\ntracer atom in the presence of solute-vacancy interactions of arbitrary\nextension. Studying model cases, it is shown that taking into account the full\nrange of the interaction may change noticeably the correlation factor. The\nlatter depends tightly on the pattern of migration barriers which is chosen to\ndescribe the vacancy jumps around the tracer atom. A thorough ab initio\nevaluation of all barriers is rarely available in the literature. It is shown\nthat approximations often used to overcome this lack of information can be\nmisleading. The examination of dilute systems recently studied shows that the\ninteractions within the first three neighbour shells dictate the final value\nwith a good precision. The main improvement of the modelling comes from\ndropping the restrictive assumption which impose an equal value to the jump\nfrequencies leading to a dissociation of the solute-vacancy pair.\n", "  We report the observation of a very exotic decay mode at the proton\ndrip-line, the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton decay, clearly seen in the\n$\\beta$ decay of the $T_z$ = -2 nucleus $^{56}$Zn. Three $\\gamma$-proton\nsequences have been observed after the $\\beta$ decay. Here this decay mode,\nalready observed in the $sd$-shell, is seen for the first time in the\n$fp$-shell. Both $\\gamma$ and proton decays have been taken into account in the\nestimation of the Fermi (F) and Gamow Teller (GT) strengths. Evidence for\nfragmentation of the Fermi strength due to strong isospin mixing is found.\n", "  The correlation factor for diffusion by the divacancy mechanism in an FCC\nlattice has been the target of a long quest. Amounting to 0.54 at the\nbeginning, its value was progressively decreased down to 0.4582 with a\nconfidence interval of 0.0005. The limitations of previous studies came from\nthe matrix method at work which confined the defect trajectories to a volume of\nfinite extension around the tracer atom, or, more basically, from the\navailability of computing time for the numerical simulations. The present study\ndetermines the exact value thanks to a double Laplace-Fourier transform of the\ntransport equation, which takes into account all the divacancy trajectories\nwithout any limitation of their lengths. The exact value is lower than all the\npreceding evaluations, but falls within the confidence interval which was\nestimated from the best evaluations based on simulations. One interesting\nbyproduct of our analytical approach is the proof of the equality t11=t22.\n", "  ASASSN-14ae is a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) found at the center\nof SDSS J110840.11+340552.2 ($d\\simeq200$~Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey\nfor Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We present ground-based and Swift follow-up\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations of the source, finding that the\ntransient had a peak luminosity of $L\\simeq8\\times10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and a\ntotal integrated energy of $E\\simeq1.7\\times10^{50}$ ergs radiated over the\n$\\sim5$ months of observations presented. The blackbody temperature of the\ntransient remains roughly constant at $T\\sim20,000$~K while the luminosity\ndeclines by nearly 1.5 orders of magnitude during this time, a drop that is\nmost consistent with an exponential, $L\\propto e^{-t/t_0}$ with\n$t_0\\simeq39$~days. The source has broad Balmer lines in emission at all epochs\nas well as a broad He II feature emerging in later epochs. We compare the color\nand spectral evolution to both supernovae and normal AGN to show that {\\name}\ndoes not resemble either type of object and conclude that a TDE is the most\nlikely explanation for our observations. At $z=0.0436$, ASASSN-14ae is the\nlowest-redshift TDE candidate discovered at optical/UV wavelengths to date, and\nwe estimate that ASAS-SN may discover $0.1 - 3$ of these events every year in\nthe future.\n", "  We consider the Unitary Permutation problem which consists, given $n$ unitary\ngates $U_1, \\ldots, U_n$ and a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,\\ldots, n\\}$, in\napplying the unitary gates in the order specified by $\\sigma$, i.e. in\nperforming $U_{\\sigma(n)}\\ldots U_{\\sigma(1)}$. This problem has been\nintroduced and investigated by Colnaghi et al. where two models of computations\nare considered. This first is the (standard) model of query complexity: the\ncomplexity measure is the number of calls to any of the unitary gates $U_i$ in\na quantum circuit which solves the problem. The second model provides quantum\nswitches and treats unitary transformations as inputs of second order. In that\ncase the complexity measure is the number of quantum switches. In their paper,\nColnaghi et al. have shown that the problem can be solved within $n^2$ calls in\nthe query model and $\\frac{n(n-1)}2$ quantum switches in the new model. We\nrefine these results by proving that $n\\log_2(n) +\\Theta(n)$ quantum switches\nare necessary and sufficient to solve this problem, whereas $n^2-2n+4$ calls\nare sufficient to solve this problem in the standard quantum circuit model. We\nprove, with an additional assumption on the family of gates used in the\ncircuits, that $n^2-o(n^{7/4+\\epsilon})$ queries are required, for any\n$\\epsilon >0$. The upper and lower bounds for the standard quantum circuit\nmodel are established by pointing out connections with the permutation as\nsubstring problem introduced by Karp.\n", "  In this Letter, we put forward a resolution to the prolonged ambiguity in\nenergy band gaps between theory and experiments of fabricated graphene\nnanoribbons (GNRs). Band structure calculations using density functional theory\nare performed on oxygen passivated GNRs supercells of customized edge\nconfigurations without disturbing the inherent sp2 hybridization of carbon\natoms. Direct band gaps are observed for both zigzag and armchair GNRs,\nconsistent with the experimental reports. In addition, band gap values of GNRs\nscattered about an average value curve for a given crystallographic orientation\nare correlated with their width on basis of the edge configurations elucidates\nthe band gaps in fabricated GNRs. We conclude that edge configurations of GNRs\nsignificantly contribute to band gap formation in addition to its width for a\ngiven crystallographic orientation, and would play a crucial role in band gap\nengineering of GNRs for future research works on fabrication of nanoelectronic\ndevices.\n", "  GENFIT is an experiment-independent track-fitting toolkit that combines\nfitting algorithms, track representations, and measurement geometries into a\nmodular framework. We report on a significantly improved version of GENFIT,\nbased on experience gained in the Belle II, PANDA, and FOPI experiments.\nImprovements concern the implementation of additional track-fitting algorithms,\nenhanced implementations of Kalman fitters, enhanced visualization\ncapabilities, and additional implementations of measurement types suited for\nvarious kinds of tracking detectors. The data model has been revised, allowing\nfor efficient track merging, smoothing, residual calculation, alignment, and\nstorage.\n", "  A detailed theoretical investigation is given which demonstrates that a\nrecently proposed statistical scaling symmetry is physically void. Although\nthis scaling is mathematically admitted as a unique symmetry transformation by\nthe underlying statistical equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes\nturbulence on the level of the functional Hopf equation, by closer inspection,\nhowever, it leads to physical inconsistencies and erroneous conclusions in the\ntheory of turbulence. The new statistical symmetry is thus misleading in so far\nas it forms within an unmodelled theory an analytical result which at the same\ntime lacks physical consistency. Our investigation will expose this\ninconsistency on different levels of statistical description, where on each\nlevel we will gain new insights for its non-physical transformation behavior.\nWith a view to generate invariant turbulent scaling laws, the consequences will\nbe finally discussed when trying to analytically exploit such a symmetry. In\nfact, a mismatch between theory and numerical experiment is conclusively\nquantified. We ultimately propose a general strategy on how to not only track\nunphysical statistical symmetries, but also on how to avoid generating such\nmisleading invariance results from the outset. All the more so as this specific\nstudy on a physically inconsistent scaling symmetry only serves as a\nrepresentative example within the broader context of statistical invariance\nanalysis. In this sense our investigation is applicable to all areas of\nstatistical physics in which symmetries get determined in order to either\ncharacterize complex dynamical systems, or in order to extract physically\nuseful and meaningful information from the underlying dynamical process itself.\n", "  In this paper we study $F$-manifolds equipped with multiple flat connections\n(and multiple $F$-products), that are required to be compatible in a suitable\nsense. In the semisimple case we show that a necessary condition for the\nexistence of such multiple flat connections can be expressed in terms of the\nintegrability of a distribution of vector fields that are related to the\neventual identities for the multiple products involved. Using this fact we show\nthat in general there can not be multi-flat structures with more than three\nflat connections. When the relevant distributions are integrable we construct\nbi-flat $F$-manifolds in dimension $2$ and $3$, and tri-flat $F$-manifolds in\ndimensions $3$ and $4$. In particular we obtain a parametrization of\nthree-dimensional bi-flat $F$ in terms of a system of six first order ODEs that\ncan be reduced to the full family of P$_{VI}$ equation and we construct\nnon-trivial examples of four dimensional tri-flat $F$ manifolds that are\ncontrolled by hypergeometric functions. In the second part of the paper we\nextend our analysis to include non-semisimple multi-flat $F$-manifolds. We show\nthat in dimension three, regular non-semisimple bi-flat $F$-manifolds are\nlocally parameterized by solutions of the full P$_{IV}$ and P$_{V}$ equations,\naccording to the Jordan normal form of the endomorphism $L=E\\circ$. Combining\nthis result with the local parametrization of $3$-dimensional bi-flat\n$F$-manifolds we have that confluences of P$_{IV}$, P$_{V}$ and P$_{VI}$\ncorrespond to collisions of eigenvalues of $L$ preserving the regularity.\nFurthermore, we show that contrary to the semisimple situation, it is possible\nto construct regular non-semisimple multi-flat $F$-manifolds, with any number\nof compatible flat connections.\n", "  A quasi-centralized limit order book (QCLOB) is a limit order book (LOB) in\nwhich financial institutions can only access the trading opportunities offered\nby counterparties with whom they possess sufficient bilateral credit. We\nperform an empirical analysis of a recent, high-quality data set from a large\nelectronic trading platform that utilizes QCLOBs to facilitate trade. We find\nmany significant differences between our results and those widely reported for\nother LOBs. We also uncover a remarkable empirical universality: although the\ndistributions describing order flow and market state vary considerably across\ndays, a simple, linear rescaling causes them to collapse onto a single curve.\nMotivated by this finding, we propose a semi-parametric model of order flow and\nmarket state in a QCLOB on a single trading day. Our model provides similar\nperformance to that of parametric curve-fitting techniques, while being simpler\nto compute and faster to implement.\n", "  Cosmic rays (CR), constrained by scattering on magnetic irregularities, are\nbelieved to propagate diffusively. But a well-known defect of diffusive\napproximation whereby some of the particles propagate unrealistically fast has\ndirected interest towards an alternative CR transport model based on the\n\"telegraph\" equation. However, its derivations often lack rigor and\ntransparency leading to inconsistent results.\n  We apply the classic Chapman-Enskog method to the CR transport problem. We\nshow that no \"telegraph\" (second order time derivative) term emerges in any\norder of a proper asymptotic expansion with systematically eliminated short\ntime scales. Nevertheless, this term may formally be\\emph{ converted} from the\n\\emph{fourth} order hyper-diffusive term of the expansion. But, both the\ntelegraph and hyperdiffusive terms may only be important for a short relaxation\nperiod associated with either strong pitch-angle anisotropy or spatial\ninhomogeneity of the initial CR distribution. Beyond this period the system\nevolves diffusively in both cases. The term conversion, that makes the\ntelegraph and Chapman-Enskog approaches reasonably equivalent, is possible only\nafter this relaxation period. During this period, the telegraph solution is\nargued to be unphysical. Unlike the hyperdiffusion correction, it is not\nuniformly valid and introduces implausible singular components to the solution.\nThese dominate the solution during the relaxation period. As they are shown not\nto be inherent in the underlying scattering problem, we argue that the\ntelegraph term is involuntarily acquired in an asymptotic reduction of the\nproblem.\n", "  Recent efforts in cosmic ray (CR) confinement and transport theory are\ndiscussed. Three problems are addressed as being crucial for understanding the\npresent day observations and their possible telltale signs of the CR origin.\nThe first problem concerns CR behavior right after their release from a source,\nsuch as a supernova remnant (SNR). At this phase the CRs are confined near the\nsource by self-emitted Alfven waves. The second is the problem of diffusive\npropagation of CRs through the turbulent ISM. This is a seemingly\nstraightforward and long-resolved problem, but it remains controversial and\nreveals paradoxes. A resolution based on the Chapman-Enskog asymptotic CR\ntransport analysis, that also includes magnetic focusing, is suggested. The\nthird problem is about a puzzling sharp ($\\sim10^{\\circ}$) anisotropies in the\nCR arrival directions that might bear on important clues of their transport\nbetween the source and observer. The overarching goal is to improve our\nunderstanding of all aspects of the CR's source escape and ensuing propagation\nthrough the galaxy to the level at which their sources can be identified\nobservationally.\n", "  When applied on some particular quantum entangled states, measurements are\nuniversal for quantum computing. In particular, despite the fondamental\nprobabilistic evolution of quantum measurements, any unitary evolution can be\nsimulated by a measurement-based quantum computer (MBQC). We consider the\nextended version of the MBQC where each measurement can occur not only in the\n(X,Y)-plane of the Bloch sphere but also in the (X,Z)- and (Y,Z)-planes. The\nexistence of a gflow in the underlying graph of the computation is a necessary\nand sufficient condition for a certain kind of determinism. We extend the\nfocused gflow (a gflow in a particular normal form) defined for the (X,Y)-plane\nto the extended case, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for\nthe existence of such normal forms.\n", "  We propose a new scenario for the onset of positive acceleration of our\nUniverse based on symmetry breaking in coupled dark energy scalar field model.\nIn a symmetry breaking process where the scalar field rolls down its own\npotential, the potential reduction is not in favor of acceleration. In our\nmodel, when dark matter density becomes less than a critical value, the shape\nof the effective potential is changed and, the quintessence field climbs up\nalong {\\it{its own potential}} while rolls down the effective potential. We\nshow that this procedure may establish the positivity of the potential required\nfor the Universe to accelerate. In addition, we show that by choosing an\nappropriate interaction between dark sectors there is the possibility that the\nscalar field resides in a new vacuum giving rise to a positive cosmological\nconstant which is responsible for a permanent late time acceleration.\n", "  Recently, a protocol for quantum state discrimination (QSD) in a multi-party\nscenario has been introduced [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 100501 (2013)]. In this\nprotocol, Alice generates a quantum system in one of two pre-defined\nnon-orthogonal qubit states, and the goal is to send the generated state\ninformation to different parties without classical communication exchanged\nbetween them during the protocol's session. The interesting feature is that, by\nresorting to sequential generalized measurements onto this single system, there\nis a non-vanishing probability that all observers identify the state prepared\nby Alice. Here, we present the experimental implementation of this protocol\nbased on polarization single-photon states. Our scheme works over an optical\nnetwork, and since QSD lies in the core of many protocols, it represents a step\ntowards experimental multi-party quantum information processing.\n", "  Hybrid quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are widely\nused in studies of enzymatic catalysis. Until recently, it has been cost\nprohibitive to determine the asymptotic limit of key energetic and structural\nproperties with respect to increasingly large QM regions. Leveraging recent\nadvances in electronic structure efficiency and accuracy, we investigate\ncatalytic properties in catechol O-methyltransferase, a representative example\nof a methyltransferase critical to human health. Using QM regions ranging in\nsize from reactants-only (64 atoms) to nearly one-third of the entire protein\n(940 atoms), we show that properties such as the activation energy approach\nwithin chemical accuracy of the large-QM asymptotic limits rather slowly,\nrequiring approximately 500-600 atoms if the QM residues are chosen simply by\ndistance from the substrate. This slow approach to asymptotic limit is due to\ncharge transfer from protein residues to the reacting substrates. Our large\nQM/MM calculations enable identification of charge separation for fragments in\nthe transition state as a key component of enzymatic methyl transfer rate\nenhancement. We introduce charge shift analysis that reveals the minimum number\nof protein residues (ca. 11-16 residues or 200-300 atoms for COMT) needed for\nquantitative agreement with large-QM simulations. The identified residues are\nnot those that would be typically selected using criteria such as chemical\nintuition or proximity. These results provide a recipe for a more careful\ndetermination of QM region sizes in future QM/MM studies of enzymes.\n", "  Photosynthesis is a mechanism developed by terrestrial life to utilize the\nenergy from photons of solar origin for biological use. Subsurface regions are\nisolated from the photosphere, and consequently are incapable of utilizing this\nenergy. This opens up the opportunity for life to evolve alternate mechanisms\nfor harvesting available energy. Bacterium Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator,\nfound 2.8 km deep in a South African mine, harvests energy from radiolysis,\ninduced by particles emitted from radioactive U, Th and K present in\nsurrounding rock. Another radiation source in the subsurface environments is\nsecondary particles generated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs). Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, it is shown that it is a steady source of energy comparable to\nthat produced by radioactive substances, and the possibility of a slow\nmetabolizing life flourishing on it cannot be ruled out. Two mechanisms are\nproposed through which GCR-induced secondary particles can be utilized for\nbiological use in subsurface environments: (1) GCRs injecting energy in the\nenvironment through particle-induced radiolysis, and (2) organic synthesis from\nGCR secondaries interacting with the medium. Laboratory experiments to test\nthese hypotheses are also proposed. Implications of these mechanisms on finding\nlife in the Solar System and elsewhere in the Universe are discussed.\n", "  The ZX-calculus is a powerful diagrammatic language for quantum mechanics and\nquantum information processing. We prove that its \\pi/4-fragment is not\ncomplete, in other words the ZX-calculus is not complete for the so called\n\"Clifford+T quantum mechanics\". The completeness of this fragment was one of\nthe main open problems in categorical quantum mechanics, a programme initiated\nby Abramsky and Coecke. The ZX-calculus was known to be incomplete for quantum\nmechanics. On the other hand, its \\pi/2-fragment is known to be complete, i.e.\nthe ZX-calculus is complete for the so called \"stabilizer quantum mechanics\".\nDeciding whether its \\pi/4-fragment is complete is a crucial step in the\ndevelopment of the ZX-calculus since this fragment is approximately universal\nfor quantum mechanics, contrary to the \\pi/2-fragment. To establish our\nincompleteness result, we consider a fairly simple property of quantum states\ncalled supplementarity. We show that supplementarity can be derived in the\nZX-calculus if and only if the angles involved in this equation are multiples\nof \\pi/2. In particular, the impossibility to derive supplementarity for \\pi/4\nimplies the incompleteness of the ZX-calculus for Clifford+T quantum mechanics.\nAs a consequence, we propose to add the supplementarity to the set of rules of\nthe ZX-calculus. We also show that if a ZX-diagram involves antiphase twins,\nthey can be merged when the ZX-calculus is augmented with the supplementarity\nrule. Merging antiphase twins makes diagrammatic reasoning much easier and\nprovides a purely graphical meaning to the supplementarity rule.\n", "  We consider a coupling of the Gaussian free field with slit holomorphic\nstochastic flows, called ($\\delta,\\sigma$)-SLE, which contains known SLE\nprocesses (chordal, radial, and dipolar) as particular cases. In physical\nterms, we study a free boundary conformal field theory with one scalar bosonic\nfield, where Green's function is assumed to have some general regular harmonic\npart. We establish which of these models allow coupling with\n($\\delta,\\sigma$)-SLE, or equivalently, when the correlation functions induce\nlocal ($\\delta,\\sigma$)-SLE martingales (martingale observables).\n", "  The periodic motion of a classical point particle in a one-dimensional\ndouble-well potential acquires a surprising degree of complexity if friction is\nadded. Finite uncertainty in the initial state can make it impossible to\npredict in which of the two wells the particle will finally settle. For two\nmodels of friction, we exhibit the structure of the basins of attraction in\nphase space which causes the final-state sensitivity. Adding friction to an\nintegrable system with more than one stable equilibrium emerges as a possible\n\"route to chaos\" whenever initial conditions can be specified with finite\naccuracy only.\n", "  We consider real scalar field theories whose dynamics is ruled by normally\nhyperbolic operators differing only by a smooth potential $V$. By means of an\nextension of the standard definition of M{\\o}ller operator, we construct an\nisomorphism between the associated spaces of smooth solutions and between the\nassociated algebras of observables. On the one hand such isomorphism is\nnon-canonical since it depends on the choice of a smooth time-dependant cut-off\nfunction. On the other hand, given any quasi-free Hadamard state for a theory\nwith a given $V$, such isomorphism allows for the construction of another\nquasi-free Hadamard state for a different potential. The resulting state\npreserves also the invariance under the action of any isometry, whose\nassociated Killing field commutes with the vector field built out of the normal\nvectors to a family of Cauchy surfaces, foliating the underlying manifold.\nEventually we discuss a sufficient condition to remove on static spacetimes the\ndependence on the cut-off via a suitable adiabatic limit.\n", "  Using superconformal methods we derive an explicit de Sitter supergravity\naction invariant under spontaneously broken local ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry.\nThe supergravity multiplet interacts with a nilpotent goldstino multiplet. We\npresent a complete locally supersymmetric action including the graviton and the\nfermionic fields, gravitino and goldstino, no scalars. In the global limit when\nsupergravity multiplet decouples, our action reproduces the Volkov-Akulov\ntheory. In the unitary gauge where goldstino vanishes we recover pure\nsupergravity with the positive cosmological constant. The classical equations\nof motion, with all fermions vanishing, have a maximally symmetric solution: de\nSitter space.\n", "  The use of reverse time chaos allows the realization of hardware chaotic\nsystems that can operate at speeds equivalent to existing state of the art\nwhile requiring significantly less complex circuitry. Matched filter decoding\nis possible for the reverse time system since it exhibits a closed form\nsolution formed partially by a linear basis pulse. Coefficients have been\ncalculated and are used to realize the matched filter digitally as a finite\nimpulse response filter. Numerical simulations confirm that this correctly\nimplements a matched filter that can be used for detection of the chaotic\nsignal. In addition, the direct form of the filter has been implemented in\nhardware description language and demonstrates performance in agreement with\nnumerical results.\n", "  We show that the singlet fraction $p_s$ and total magnetisation (or\npolarisation) $m$ can bound the minimum concurrence in an ensemble of spins. We\nidentify $p_s > (1-m^2)/2$ as a sufficient and tight condition for bipartite\nentanglement. Our proof makes no assumptions about the state of the system or\nsymmetry of the particles, and can therefore be used as a witness for spin\nentanglement between fermions. We discuss the implications for recent\nexperiments in which spin correlations were observed, and the prospect to study\nentanglement dynamics in the demagnetisation of a cold Fermi gas.\n", "  We study the effect of a half wave rectified sinusoidal electromagnetic (EM)\nwave on the Kitaev honeycomb model with an additional magneto-electric coupling\nterm {arising due to induced polarization of the bonds. Within the framework of\nFloquet analysis, we show that merging of a pair of Dirac points in the gapless\nregion of the Kitaev model leading to a semi-Dirac spectrum is indeed possible}\nby externally varying the amplitude and the phase of the EM field.\n", "  We derive a semi-classical formula for computing the spectrum of bound states\nmade of Majorana fermions in a generic non-integrable 2d quantum field theory\nwith a set of degenerate vacua. We illustrate the application of the formula in\na series of cases, including an asymmetric well potential where the spectra of\nbosons and fermions may have some curious features. We also discuss the merging\nof fermionic and bosonic spectra in the presence of supersymmetry. Finally, we\nuse the semi-classical formula to analyse the evolution of the particle spectra\nin a class of non-integrable supersymmetry models.\n", "  In this paper, employing the modified dispersion relation, we have derived\nthe general modified Friedmann equations and the corresponding modified entropy\nrelations for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. In this setup, we\nfind that when the big bounce happens, its energy scale and its corresponding\nmodified entropy behavior are sensitive to the value of $k$. In contrast to the\nprevious work with $k=0$, our work mainly demonstrates that the bouncing\nbehavior for the closed Universe with $k=1$ appears at the normal energy limit\nof the modified dispersion relation introduced, and when bouncing phenomenon is\nin presence, its modified entropy is just equal to zero. Surprisingly, when\n$k=-1$, the bouncing behavior is in absence.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors are intriguing\nhosts for quantum light sources due to their unique opto-electronic properties.\nHere we report that strain gradients induced by substrate patterning result in\nspatially and spectrally isolated quantum emitters in mono- and bi-layer WSe2.\nBy correlating localized excitons with localized strain-variations, we show\nthat the quantum emitter emission energy can be red-tuned up to a remarkable\n~170 meV. We probe the fine-structure, magneto-optics, and second order\ncoherence of a strained emitter. These results raise the prospect to\nstrain-engineer quantum emitter properties and deterministically create arrays\nof quantum emitters in two-dimensional semiconductors.\n", "  The detection of an unidentified emission line in X-ray spectra of cosmic\nobjects would be a 'smoking gun' signature for particle physics beyond the\nStandard Model. More than a decade of its extensive searches results in several\nnarrow faint emission lines reported at 3.5, 8.7, 9.4 and 10.1 keV. The most\npromising of them is the emission line at ~3.5 keV reported in spectra of\nseveral nearby galaxies and galaxy clusters. Here I summarize its up-to-date\nstatus, overview its possible interpretations, including an intriguing\nconnection with radiatively decaying dark matter, and outline future directions\nfor its studies.\n", "  Turbulent resuspension, a process of lifting solid particles from the bottom\nby turbulent flow, is ubiquitous in environmental and industrial applications.\nThe process is a sequence of events that start with an incipient motion of the\nparticle being dislodged from its place, continue as sliding or rolling on the\nsurface, ending with the particle being detached from the surface and lifted up\ninto the flow. In this study the focus is on the resuspension of solid\nspherical particles with the density comparable to that of the fluid and the\ndiameter comparable with the Kolmogorov length scale. We track their motion\nduring the lift-off events in an oscillating grid turbulent flow. We measure\nsimultaneously the Lagrangian trajectories of both the particles freely moving\nalong the bottom smooth wall and the surrounding flow tracers. Different force\nterms acting on particles were estimated based on particle motion and local\nflow parameters. The results show that: \\emph{i}) the lift force is dominant;\n\\emph{ii}) drag force on freely moving particles is less relevant in this type\nof resuspension; \\emph{iii}) the Basset (history or viscous-unsteady) force is\na non-negligible component and plays an important role before the lift-off\nevent. Although we cannot estimate very accurately the magnitude of the force\nterms, we find that during the resuspension they are within the range of\n$2\\div10$ times the buoyancy force magnitude. The findings cannot be\nextrapolated to particles, which are much smaller than the Kolmogorov length\nscale, or much denser than the fluid. Nevertheless, the present findings can\nassist in modeling of the sediment transport, particle filtration, pneumatic\nconveying and mixing in bio-reactors.\n", "  We present the measurement of the size and surface brightness of the\nexpanding light echoes from supernova (SN) 2014J in the nearby starburst galaxy\nM82. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC images were taken ~277 and ~416 days\n(after the time of B-band maximum light) in the filters F475W, F606W, and\nF775W, each combined with the three polarizing filters: POL0V, POL60V, and\nPOL120V. The two epochs' imaging reveals the time evolution of at least two\nmajor echoes. Three concentric bright regions between position angles (PA,\n0^{\\circ} from North, counterclockwise). 80^{\\circ} ~ 170^{\\circ} have\nprojected radius of 0.60\" on the sky on ~277 days and expanding to 0.75\" on\n~416 days, corresponding to scattering materials at a foreground distance of\n222\\pm37 pc. Another fainter but evident light echo extending over a wide range\nof PA has radii of 0.75\" and 0.96\" on ~277 and ~416 days. This corresponds to\nscattering material at a foreground distance of 367\\pm61 pc. Multiple light\nechoes with S/N > 2.5 reside at smaller radii on ~277 days but become less\nsignificant on ~416 days indicating a complex structure of foreground\ninterstellar medium (ISM). The light echo shows bluer color than predicted\nunder a Rayleigh scattering case. We also found the light echo brightened from\nV_{echo}=21.68\\pm0.07 on 2014 September 5, to V_{echo}=21.05\\pm0.08 on 2014\nNovember 6, suggesting an enhancement of echoing materials at different\ndistances projected on to the plane of the sky.\n", "  We analyse quench processes in two dimensional quantum field theories with\ninfinite number of conservation laws which also include fermionic charges that\nclose a $N=1$ supersymmetric algebra. While in general the quench protocol\ninduces a breaking of supersymmetry, we show that there are particular initial\nstates which ensure the persistence of supersymmetry also for the dynamics out\nof equilibrium. We discuss the conditions that identify such states and, as\napplication, we present the significant cases of the Tricritical Ising Model\nand the Sine-Gordon model at its supersymmetric point. We also address the\nissue of the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble in the presence of fermionic conserved\ncharges.\n", "  We construct a three-dimensional, fully relativistic numerical model of a\nuniverse filled with an inhomogeneous pressureless fluid, starting from initial\ndata that represent a perturbation of the Einstein-de Sitter model. We then\nmeasure the departure of the average expansion rate with respect to this\nhomogeneous and isotropic reference model, comparing local quantities to the\npredictions of linear perturbation theory. We find that collapsing\nperturbations reach the turnaround point much earlier than expected from the\nreference spherical top-hat collapse model and that the local deviation of the\nexpansion rate from the homogeneous one can be as high as $28\\%$ at an\nunderdensity, for an initial density contrast of $10^{-2}$. We then study, for\nthe first time, the exact behavior of the backreaction term ${\\cal Q}_{\\cal\nD}$. We find that, for small values of the initial perturbations, this term\nexhibits a $1/a$ scaling, and that it is negative with a linearly growing\nabsolute value for larger perturbation amplitudes, thereby contributing to an\noverall deceleration of the expansion. Its magnitude, on the other hand,\nremains very small even for relatively large perturbations.\n", "  We have systematically studied the nematic fluctuations in the electron-doped\niron-based superconductor BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$ by measuring the in-plane\nresistance change under uniaxial pressure. While the nematic quantum critical\npoint can be identified through the measurements along the (110) direction as\nstudied previously, quantum and thermal critical fluctuations cannot be\ndistinguished due to similar Curie-Weiss-like behaviors. Here we find that a\nsizable pressure-dependent resistivity along the (100) direction is present in\nall doping levels, which is against the simple picture of an Ising-type nematic\nmodel. The signal along the (100) direction becomes maximum at optimal doping,\nsuggesting that it is associated with nematic quantum critical fluctuations.\nOur results indicate that thermal fluctuations from striped antiferromagnetic\norder dominate the underdoped regime along the (110) direction. We argue that\neither there is a strong coupling between the quantum critical fluctuations and\nthe fermions, or more exotically, a higher symmetry may be present around\noptimal doping.\n", "  We summarise the prospects for Higgs boson physics at future proton-proton\ncolliders with centre of mass (c.m.) energies up to 100 TeV. We first provide\nthe production cross sections for the Higgs boson of the Standard Model from 13\nTeV to 100 TeV, in the main production mechanisms and in subleading but\nimportant ones such as double Higgs production, triple production and\nassociated production with two gauge bosons or with a single top quark. We then\ndiscuss the production of Higgs particles in beyond the Standard Model\nscenarios, starting with the one in the continuum of a pair of scalar,\nfermionic and vector dark matter particles in Higgs-portal models in various\nchannels with virtual Higgs exchange. The cross sections for the production of\nthe heavier CP-even and CP-odd neutral Higgs states and the charged Higgs\nstates in two-Higgs doublet models, with a specific study of the case of the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, are then given. The sensitivity of a 100\nTeV proton machine to probe the new Higgs states is discussed and compared to\nthat of the LHC with a c.m. energy of 14 TeV and at high luminosity.\n", "  We continue our study of zero-dimensional field theories in which the fields\ntake values in a strong homotopy Lie algebra. In a first part, we review in\ndetail how higher Chern-Simons theories arise in the AKSZ-formalism. These\ntheories form a universal starting point for the construction of\n$L_\\infty$-algebra models. We then show how to describe superconformal field\ntheories and how to perform dimensional reductions in this context. In a second\npart, we demonstrate that Nambu-Poisson and multisymplectic manifolds are\nclosely related via their Heisenberg algebras. As a byproduct of our\ndiscussion, we find central Lie $p$-algebra extensions of $\\mathfrak{so}(p+2)$.\nFinally, we study a number of $L_\\infty$-algebra models which are physically\ninteresting and which exhibit quantized multisymplectic manifolds as vacuum\nsolutions.\n", "  We propose a multiple-range quantum communication channel to realize coherent\ntwo-way quantum state transport with high fidelity. In our scheme, an\ninformation carrier (a qubit) and its remote partner are both adiabatically\ncoupled to the same data bus, i.e., an N}-site tight-binding chain that has a\nsingle defect at the center. At the weak interaction regime, our system is\neffectively equivalent to a three level system of which a coherent\nsuperposition of the two carrier states constitutes a dark state. The adiabatic\ncoupling allows a well controllable information exchange timing via the dark\nstate between the two carriers. Numerical results show that our scheme is\nrobust and efficient under practically inevitable perturbative defects of the\ndata bus as well as environmental dephasing noise.\n", "  An analytic solution describing an ion-acoustic collisionless shock,\nself-consistently with the evolution of shock-reflected ions, is obtained. The\nsolution extends the classic soliton solution beyond a critical Mach number,\nwhere the soliton ceases to exist because of the upstream ion reflection. The\nreflection transforms the soliton into a shock with a trailing wave and a foot\npopulated by the reflected ions. The solution relates parameters of the entire\nshock structure, such as the maximum and minimum of the potential in the\ntrailing wave, the height of the foot, as well as the shock Mach number, to the\nnumber of reflected ions. This relation is resolvable for any given\ndistribution of the upstream ions. In this paper, we have resolved it for a\nsimple \"box\" distribution. Two separate models of electron interaction with the\nshock are considered. The first model corresponds to the standard Boltzmannian\nelectron distribution in which case the critical shock Mach number only\ninsignificantly increases from M=1.6 (no ion reflection) to M=1.8 (substantial\nreflection). The second model corresponds to adiabatically trapped electrons.\nThey produce a stronger increase, from M=3.1 to M=4.5. The shock foot that is\nsupported by the reflected ions also accelerates them somewhat further. A\nself-similar foot expansion into the upstream medium is also described\nanalytically.\n", "  Trapping of microparticles, nanoparticles and aerosols is an issue of major\ninterest for physics and chemistry. We present a setup intended for\nmicroparticle trapping in multipole linear Paul trap geometries, operating\nunder Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure (SATP) conditions. A\n16-electrode linear trap geometry has been designed and tested, with an aim to\nconfine a larger number of particles with respect to quadrupole traps and thus\nenhance the signal to noise ratio, as well as to study microparticle dynamical\nstability in electrodynamic fields. Experimental tests and numerical\nsimulations suggest that multipole traps are very suited for high precision\nmass spectrometry measurements in case of different microparticle species or to\nidentify the presence of certain aerosols and polluting agents in the\natmosphere. Particle traps represent versatile tools for environment monitoring\nor for the study of many-body Coulomb systems and dusty plasmas.\n", "  In this chapter of the book entitled, \"Extending the Theory of Composites to\nOther Areas of Science\" [edited by Graeme W. Milton, 2016] we derive the\nanalyticity properties of the electromagnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the\ntime-harmonic Maxwell's equations for passive linear multicomponent media.\nMoreover, we discuss the connection of this map to Herglotz functions for\nisotropic and anisotropic multicomponent composites.\n", "  We define in this paper a class of three indices tensor models, endowed with\n$O(N)^{\\otimes 3}$ invariance ($N$ being the size of the tensor). This allows\nto generate, via the usual QFT perturbative expansion, a class of Feynman\ntensor graphs which is strictly larger than the class of Feynman graphs of both\nthe multi-orientable model (and hence of the colored model) and the $U(N)$\ninvariant models. We first exhibit the existence of a large $N$ expansion for\nsuch a model with general interactions. We then focus on the quartic model and\nwe identify the leading and next-to-leading order (NLO) graphs of the large $N$\nexpansion. Finally, we prove the existence of a critical regime and we compute\nthe critical exponents, both at leading order and at NLO. This is achieved\nthrough the use of various analytic combinatorics techniques.\n", "  We build a new phenomenological framework that bridges the long wavelength\nbulk viscous transport properties of the strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma\n(sQGP) and short distance hard jet transport properties in the QGP. The full\nnonperturbative chromo-electric (E) and chromo-magnetic (M) structure of the\nnear \"perfect fluid\" like sQGP in the critical transition region are integrated\ninto a semi-Quark-Gluon-Monopole Plasma (sQGMP) model lattice-compatibly and\nimplemented into the new CUJET3.0 jet quenching framework. All observables\ncomputed from CUJET3.0 are found to be consistent with available data at RHIC\nand LHC simultaneously. A quantitative connection between the shear viscosity\nand jet transport parameter is rigorously established within this framework. We\ndeduce the $T=160-600$ MeV dependence of the QGP's $\\eta/s$: its near vanishing\nvalue in the near $T_c$ regime is determined by the composition of E and M\ncharges, it increases as $T$ rises, and its high $T$ limit is fixed by color\nscreening scales.\n", "  In this chapter of the book entitled, \"Extending the Theory of Composites to\nOther Areas of Science\" [edited by Graeme W. Milton, 2016] we give a rigorous\nderivation of the field equation recursion method in the abstract theory of\ncomposites to two-component composites with isotropic phases. This method is of\ngreat interest since it has proven to be a powerful tool in developing sharp\nbounds for the effective tensor of a composite material. The reason is that the\neffective tensor $\\bf L_*$ can be interpreted in the general framework of the\nabstract theory of composites as the $Z$-operator on a certain orthogonal\n$Z(2)$ subspace collection. The base case of the recursion starts with an\northogonal $Z(2)$ subspace collection on a Hilbert space $\\cal H$, the\n$Z$-problem, and the associated $Y$-problem. We provide some new conditions for\nthe solvability of both the $Z$-problem and the associated $Y$-problem. We also\ngive explicit representations of the associated $Z$-operator and $Y$-operator\nand study their analytical properties. An iteration method is then developed\nfrom a hierarchy of subspace collections and their associated operators which\nleads to a continued fraction representation of the initial effective tensor\n$\\bf L_*$.\n", "  We provide in this work a tool-kit for the study of homogenisation of random\nordinary differential equations, under the form of a friendly-user black box\nbased on the tehcnology of rough flows. We illustrate the use of this setting\non the example of stochastic turbulence.\n", "  We study effects of the hadronic rescattering on final observables especially\nfor multi-strange hadrons such as $\\phi$, $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions within an integrated dynamical approach. In this approach,\n(3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics is combined with a microscopic transport\nmodel, JAM. We simulate the collisions with or without hadronic rescatterings\nand compare observables between these two options so that we quantify the\neffects of the hadronic rescattering. We find that the mean transverse momentum\nand the elliptic flow parameter of multi-strange hadrons are less affected by\nhadronic rescattering and, as a result, the mass ordering of the\n$p_T$-differential elliptic flow parameter $v_2(p_T)$ is violated: At the RHIC\nand the LHC energies the $v_2(p_T)$ for $\\phi$-mesons is larger than that for\nprotons in the low-$p_T$ regions.\n", "  Many biological systems fold thin sheets of lipid membrane into complex\nthree-dimensional structures. This microscopic origami is often mediated by the\nadsorption and self-assembly of proteins on a membrane. As a model system to\nstudy adsorption-mediated interactions, we study the collective behavior of\nmicrometric particles adhered to a lipid vesicle. We estimate the colloidal\ninteractions using a maximum likelihood analysis of particle trajectories. When\nthe particles are highly wrapped by a tense membrane, we observe strong\nlong-range attractions with a typical binding energy of 150 $k_B T$ and\nsignificant forces extending a few microns.\n", "  We show that proper control of magnetization textures can be achieved in\nnoncollinear antiferromagnets. This opens the versatile toolbox of domain-wall\nmanipulation in the context of a different family of materials. In this way, we\nshow that noncollinear antiferromagnets are a good prospect for applications in\nthe context of antiferromagnetic spintronics. As in many noncollinear\nantiferromagnets, the order parameter field takes values in SO(3). By\nperforming a gradient expansion in the energy functional we derive an effective\ntheory that accounts for the physics of the magnetization of long-wavelength\nexcitations. We apply our formalism to static and dynamic textures such as\ndomain walls and localized oscillations, and identify topologically protected\ntextures that are spatially localized. Our results are applicable to the\nexchange-bias materials Mn3X, with X = Ir, Rh, Pt.\n", "  We develop an analytical model to describe sub-bandgap optical absorption in\ntwo-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (s-TMD)\nnanoflakes. The material system represents an array of few-layer molybdenum\ndisulfide crystals, randomly orientated in a polymer matrix. We propose that\noptical absorption involves direct transitions between electronic edge-states\nand bulk-bands, depends strongly on the carrier population, and is saturable\nwith sufficient fluence. For excitation energies above half the bandgap, the\nexcess energy is absorbed by the edge-state electrons, elevating their\neffective temperature. Our analytical expressions for the linear and nonlinear\nabsorption could prove useful tools in the design of practical photonic devices\nbased on s-TMDs.\n", "  We present a computational investigation of thin viscoelastic films and drops\non a solid substrate subject to the van der Waals interaction force, in two\nspatial dimensions. The governing equations are obtained within a long-wave\napproximation of the Navier-Stokes equations with Jeffreys model for\nviscoelastic stresses. We investigate the effects of viscoelasticity, Newtonian\nviscosity, and the substrate slippage on the dynamics of thin viscoelastic\nfilms. We also study the effects of viscoelasticity on drops that spread or\nrecede on a prewetted substrate. For dewetting films, the numerical results\nshow the presence of multiple secondary droplets for higher values of\nelasticity, consistently with experimental findings. For drops, we find that\nelastic effects lead to deviations from the Cox-Voinov law for partially\nwetting fluids. In general, elastic effects enhance spreading, and suppress\nretraction, compared to Newtonian ones.\n", "  Using the linear T-dual ward identity associated with the NSNS gauge\ntransformations, some RR couplings on D$_p$-branes have been found at order\n$O(\\alpha'^2)$. We examine the $C^{(p-1)}$ couplings with the S-matrix elements\nof one RR, one graviton and one antisymmetric B-field vertex operators. We find\nthe consistency of T-dual S-matrix elements and explicit results of scattering\nstring amplitude and show that the string amplitude reproduces these couplings\nas well as some other couplings. This illustration is found for $C^{(p-3)}$\ncouplings in the literature which is extended to the $C^{(p-1)}$ couplings in\nthis paper.\n", "  Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of fast Monte Carlo (MC) based\ninverse biological planning for the treatment of head and neck tumors in\nspot-scanning proton therapy. Methods: Recently, a fast and accurate Graphics\nProcessor Unit (GPU)-based MC simulation of proton transport was developed and\nused as the dose calculation engine in a GPU-accelerated IMPT optimizer.\nBesides dose, the dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) can be\nsimultaneously scored, which makes biological dose (BD) optimization possible.\nTo convert from LETd to BD, a linear relation was assumed. Using this novel\noptimizer, inverse biological planning was applied to 4 patients: 2 small and 1\nlarge thyroid tumor targets, and 1 glioma case. To create these plans,\nconstraints were placed to maintain the physical dose (PD) within 1.25 times\nthe prescription while maximizing target BD. For comparison, conventional IMRT\nand IMPT plans were created for each case in Eclipse (Varian, Inc). The same\ncritical structure PD constraints were used for the IMRT, IMPT and\nbio-optimized plans. The BD for the IMPT plans were obtained through MC\nre-calculations. Results: Compared to standard IMPT, the bio-optimal plans for\npatients with small tumor targets displayed a BD escalation that was around\ntwice the PD increase. Dose sparing to critical structures was improved\ncompared to both IMRT and IMPT. No significant BD increase could be achieved\nfor the large thyroid case, and when the presence of critical structures\nmitigated the contribution of additional fields. The calculation of the\nbio-optimized plans can be completed in a clinically viable time (<30 minutes)\non a 24-GPU system. Conclusion: By exploiting GPU acceleration, MC-based,\nbiologically optimized plans were created for small-target tumor patients. This\noptimizer will be used in an upcoming feasibility trial on LETd painting for\nradio-resistant tumors.\n", "  Coherent interactions at a distance provide a powerful tool for quantum\nsimulation and computation. The most common approach to realize an effective\nlong-distance coupling 'on-chip' is to use a quantum mediator, as has been\ndemonstrated for superconducting qubits and trapped ions. For quantum dot\narrays, which combine a high degree of tunability with extremely long coherence\ntimes, the experimental demonstration of coherent spin-spin coupling via an\nintermediary system remains an important outstanding goal. Here, we use a\nlinear triple-quantum-dot array to demonstrate a first working example of a\ncoherent interaction between two distant spins via a quantum mediator. The two\nouter dots are occupied with a single electron spin each and the spins\nexperience a superexchange interaction through the empty middle dot which acts\nas mediator. Using single-shot spin read-out we measure the coherent time\nevolution of the spin states on the outer dots and observe a characteristic\ndependence of the exchange frequency as a function of the detuning between the\nmiddle and outer dots. This approach may provide a new route for scaling up\nspin qubit circuits using quantum dots and aid in the simulation of materials\nand molecules with non-nearest neighbour couplings such as MnO,\nhigh-temperature superconductors and DNA. The same superexchange concept can\nalso be applied in cold atom experiments.\n", "  The highly-sensitive method is proposed for the real-time diagnostics of the\nvon Neumann peak at detonation of brisant high explosives. The absence of the\ndirect link between the pressure and the course of chemical reactions was\nshown. For TNT (trinitrotoluene), the influence of the structure of charge on\nthe kinetics of chemical peak was demonstrated.\n", "  Based on cosmic ray events without a magnetic field taken with the BESIII\ndetector during the summer shutdown of BEPCII in 2012 and di-muon events from a\ndata sample taken at center-of-mass energy of 3.686 GeV in 2009, we compare the\ncoordinates of hits registered in the BESIII muon counter with the expected\ninteraction point extrapolated from reconstructed tracks from the inner\ntracking system in the absence of a magnetic field. By minimizing the\ndifference, we align the muon counter with the inner tracking system. Moreover,\nthe strength of the magnetic field in the muon counter is measured for the\nfirst time with di-muon events from data taken at a center-of-mass energy of\n3.686~GeV. After the alignment and the magnetic field strength measurement, the\noffsets in the reconstructed hit positions for muon tracks are reduced, which\nimproves the muon identification. The alignment and magnetic field strength\nmeasurement have been adopted in the latest version of the BESIII offline\nsoftware system. This addition to the software reduces the systematic\nuncertainty for the physics analysis in cases where the muon counter\ninformation is used.\n", "  Test beam measurements at the test beam facilities of DESY have been\nconducted to characterise the performance of the EUDET-type beam telescopes\noriginally developed within the EUDET project. The beam telescopes are equipped\nwith six sensor planes using MIMOSA26 monolithic active pixel devices. A\nprogrammable Trigger Logic Unit provides trigger logic and time stamp\ninformation on particle passage. Both data acquisition framework and offline\nreconstruction software packages are available. User devices are easily\nintegrable into the data acquisition framework via predefined interfaces.\n  The biased residual distribution is studied as a function of the beam energy,\nplane spacing and sensor threshold. Its standard deviation at the two centre\npixel planes using all six planes for tracking in a 6\\,GeV\nelectron/positron-beam is measured to be\n$(2.88\\,\\pm\\,0.08)\\,\\upmu\\meter$.Iterative track fits using the formalism of\nGeneral Broken Lines are performed to estimate the intrinsic resolution of the\nindividual pixel planes. The mean intrinsic resolution over the six sensors\nused is found to be $(3.24\\,\\pm\\,0.09)\\,\\upmu\\meter$.With a 5\\,GeV\nelectron/positron beam, the track resolution halfway between the two inner\npixel planes using an equidistant plane spacing of 20\\,mm is estimated to\n$(1.83\\,\\pm\\,0.03)\\,\\upmu\\meter$ assuming the measured intrinsic resolution.\nTowards lower beam energies the track resolution deteriorates due to increasing\nmultiple scattering. Threshold studies show an optimal working point of the\nMIMOSA26 sensors at a sensor threshold of between five and six times their RMS\nnoise. Measurements at different plane spacings are used to calibrate the\namount of multiple scattering in the material traversed and allow for\ncorrections to the predicted angular scattering for electron beams.\n", "  We present a study of germanium as n-type dopant in wurtzite GaN films grown\nby plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy, reaching carrier concentrations of\nup to 6.7E20 cm-3 at 300K, well beyond the Mott density. The Ge concentration\nand free carrier density were found to scale linearly with the Ge flux in the\nstudied range. All the GaN:Ge layers present smooth surface morphology with\natomic terraces, without trace of pits or cracks, and the mosaicity of the\nsamples has no noticeable dependence on the Ge concentration. The variation of\nthe GaN:Ge band gap with the carrier concentration is consistent with\ntheoretical calculations of the band gap renormalization due to\nelectron-electron and electron-ion interaction, and Burstein-Moss effect.\n", "  We investigate the Casimir stress on a topological insulator (TI) between two\nmetallic plates. The TI is assumed to be joined to one of the plates and its\nsurface in front of the other is covered by a thin magnetic layer, which turns\nthe TI into a full insulator. We also analyze the limit where one of the plates\nis sent to infinity yielding the Casimir stress between a conducting plate and\na TI. To this end we employ a local approach in terms of the stress-energy\ntensor of the system, its vacuum expectation value being subsequently evaluated\nin terms of the appropriate Green's function. Finally, the construction of the\nrenormalised vacuum stress-energy tensor in the region between the plates\nyields the Casimir stress. Numerical results are also presented.\n", "  One of the goals of modern spectroscopy is to invent techniques which detect\nneutral excitations that have been theoretically proposed. For superconductors,\ntwo point transport measurements detect the Andreev crossed reflection which\nconfirms the existence of the Majorana fermions. Similar information can be\nobtained from a measurement using two piezoelectric transducers. One transducer\nmeasures the stress tensor response from the strain field generated by the\nsecond transducer. The ratio between the stress response and strain velocity\ndetermines the dissipative response. We will show that the dissipative stress\nresponse can be used for a Topological Superconductor. We will investigate a\nTopological Superconductor in a magnetic field, an Abrikosov vortex lattice\nwith Majorana dispersive fermions is formed which is used to compute the\ndissipative stress response and identify the Majorana fermions and\nquasi-particles.\n", "  Grover's algorithm constitutes the optimal quantum solution to the search\nproblem and provides a quadratic speed-up over all possible classical search\nalgorithms. Quantum interference between computational paths has been posited\nas a key resource behind this computational speed-up. However there is a limit\nto this interference, at most pairs of paths can ever interact in a fundamental\nway. Could more interference imply more computational power? Sorkin has defined\na hierarchy of possible interference behaviours---currently under experimental\ninvestigation---where classical theory is at the first level of the hierarchy\nand quantum theory belongs to the second. Informally, the order in the\nhierarchy corresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible\ninteraction in a multi-slit experiment. In this work, we consider how Grover's\nspeed-up depends on the order of interference in a theory. Surprisingly, we\nshow that the quadratic lower bound holds regardless of the order of\ninterference. Thus, at least from the point of view of the search problem,\npost-quantum interference does not imply a computational speed-up over quantum\ntheory.\n", "  We consider general convolutional derivatives and related fractional\nstatistical dynamics of continuous interacting particle systems. We apply the\nsubordination principle to construct kinetic fractional statistical dynamics in\nthe continuum in terms of solutions to Vlasov-type hierarchies. Conditions for\nthe intermittency property of fractional kinetic dynamics are obtained.\n", "  Investigation of real two-dimensional systems with Dirac-like electronic\nbehavior under the influence of magnetic field is challenging and leads to many\ninteresting physical results. In this paper we study 2D graphene model with a\nparticular form of magnetic field as a superposition of a homogeneous field and\nan Aharonov-Bohm vortex. For this configuration, electronic wave functions and\nenergy spectrum were obtained and it was shown that the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm\nvortex plays the role of a charge impurity. As a demonstration of vacuum\nproperties of the system, vacuum current, as well as an electric current, is\ncalculated and their representation for particular limiting cases of magnetic\nfield is obtained.\n", "  Solving field equations in the context of higher curvature gravity theories\nis a formidable task. However in many situations, e.g., in the context of\n$f(R)$ theories the higher curvature gravity action can be written as\nEinstein-Hilbert action plus a scalar field action. We show that not only the\naction but the field equations derived from the action are also equivalent\nprovided the spacetime is regular. We also demonstrate that such equivalence\ncontinues to hold even when gravitational field equations are projected on a\nlower dimensional hypersurface. We have further depicted explicit examples in\nwhich the solutions for Einstein-Hilbert and a scalar field system lead to\nsolutions of the equivalent higher curvature theory. The same, but on the lower\ndimensional hypersurface, has been illustrated in the reverse order as well. We\nconclude with a brief discussion on this technique of solving higher curvature\nfield equations.\n", "  Two unknown states can be unambiguously distinguished by a universal\nprogrammable discriminator, which has been widely discussed in previous works\nand the optimal solution has also been obtained. In this paper, we investigate\nthe programmable unambiguous discriminator between two unknown \"latitudinal\"\nstates, which lie in a subspace of the total state space. By equivalence of\nunknown pure states to known average mixed states, the optimal solution for\nthis problem is systematically derived, and the analytical success\nprobabilities for the optimal unambiguous discrimination are obtained. It is\nbeyond one's expectation that the optimal setting for the programmable\nunambiguous discrimination between two unknown \"latitudinal\" states is the same\nas that for the universal ones. The results in this work can be used for the\nrealization of the programmable discriminator in laboratory.\n", "  The discovery of the neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ opens new\nopportunities for the discovery of the leptonic CP violation for high intensity\nneutrino beams. MOMENT a future neutrino facility with a high-power proton beam\nof 15 MW from a continuous-wave linac is focused on that discovery. The high\npower of the proton beam causes extreme radiation conditions for the facility\nand especially for the target station where the pion capture system of five\nsuperconducting solenoids is located. In this paper initial studies are\nperformed for the effects of the radiation on the solenoid structure and the\narea surrounding it. A concept cooling system is also proposed.\n", "  This is, with minor modifications, a text read at the 114th Statistical\nMechanics meeting, in honor of D.Ruelle and Y.Sinai, at Rutgers, Dec.13-15,\n2015. It does not attempt to analyze, or not even just quote, all works of\nDavid Ruelle; I discuss, as usual in such occasions, a few among his works with\nwhich I have most familiarity and which were a source of inspiration for me.\n", "  Isolated quantum systems with quenched randomness exhibit many-body\nlocalization (MBL), wherein they do not reach local thermal equilibrium even\nwhen highly excited above their ground states. It is widely believed that\nindividual eigenstates capture this breakdown of thermalization at finite size.\nWe show that this belief is false in general and that a MBL system can exhibit\nthe eigenstate properties of a thermalizing system. We propose that localized\napproximately conserved operators (l$^*$-bits) underlie localization in such\nsystems. In dimensions $d>1$, we further argue that the existing MBL\nphenomenology is unstable to boundary effects and gives way to l$^*$-bits.\nPhysical consequences of l$^*$-bits include the possibility of an eigenstate\nphase transition within the MBL phase unrelated to the dynamical transition in\n$d=1$ and thermal eigenstates at all parameters in $d>1$. Near-term experiments\nin ultra-cold atomic systems and numerics can probe the dynamics generated by\nboundary layers and emergence of l$^*$-bits.\n", "  In the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions, the emptiness\nformation probability is the probability that a rectangular region in the top\nleft corner of the lattice is frozen. We generalize this notion to the case\nwhere the frozen region has the shape of a generic Young diagram. We derive\nhere a multiple integral representation for this correlation function.\n", "  We propose a new model-independent method to test the cosmic curvature by\ncomparing the proper distance and transverse comoving distance. Using the\nmeasurements of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and angular diameter distance $d_A$,\nthe cosmic curvature parameter $\\Omega_K$ is constrained to be $-0.09\\pm0.19$,\nwhich is consistent with a flat universe. We also use Monte Carlo simulation to\ntest the validity and efficiency, and find that our method can give a reliable\nand efficient constraint on cosmic curvature. Compared with other\nmodel-independent methods testing the cosmic curvature, our method can avoid\nsome drawbacks and give a better constraint.\n", "  The Bessel process with parameter $D>1$ and the Dyson model of interacting\nBrownian motions with coupling constant $\\beta >0$ are extended to the\nprocesses in which the drift term and the interaction terms are given by the\nlogarithmic derivatives of Jacobi's theta functions. They are called the\nelliptic Bessel process, eBES$^{(D)}$, and the elliptic Dyson model,\neDYS$^{(\\beta)}$, respectively. Both are realized on the circumference of a\ncircle $[0, 2 \\pi r)$ with radius $r >0$ as temporally inhomogeneous processes\ndefined in a finite time interval $[0, t_*), t_* < \\infty$. Transformations of\nthem to Schr\\\"odinger-type equations with time-dependent potentials lead us to\nproving that eBES$^{(D)}$ and eDYS$^{(\\beta)}$ can be constructed as the\ntime-dependent Girsanov transformations of Brownian motions. In the special\ncases where $D=3$ and $\\beta=2$, observables of the processes are defined and\nthe processes are represented for them using the Brownian paths winding round a\ncircle and pinned at time $t_*$. We show that eDYS$^{(2)}$ has the\ndeterminantal martingale representation for any observable. Then it is proved\nthat eDYS$^{(2)}$ is determinantal for all observables for any finite initial\nconfiguration without multiple points. Determinantal processes are stochastic\nintegrable systems in the sense that all spatio-temporal correlation functions\nare given by determinants controlled by a single continuous function called the\nspatio-temporal correlation kernel.\n", "  Planar superconducting microwave resonators are key elements in a variety of\ntechnical applications and also act as sensitive probes for microwave\nspectroscopy of various materials of interest. Here superconducting Pb is a\nsuitable material as a basis for microwave stripline resonators.\n  To utilize Pb stripline resonators in a variable magnetic field (e.g. in\nESR), the electrodynamics of such resonators in finite magnetic field has to be\nwell understood. Therefore we performed microwave transmission measurements on\nsuperconducting Pb stripline resonators in a variable, parallel magnetic field.\nWe determined surface resistance, penetration depth as well as real and\nimaginary parts, \\sigma$_1$ and \\sigma$_2$, of the complex conductivity of\nsuperconducting Pb as a function of magnetic field. Here we find features\nreminiscent of those in temperature-dependent measurements, such as a maximum\nin \\sigma$_1$ (coherence peak). At magnetic fields above the critical field of\nthis type-I superconductor we still find low-loss microwave response, which we\nassign to remaining superconductivity in the form of filaments within the Pb.\nHysteresis effects are found in the quality factor of resonances once the swept\nmagnetic field has exceeded the critical magnetic field. This is due to normal\nconducting areas that are pinned and can therefore persist in the\nsuperconducting phase. Besides zero-field-cooling we show an alternative way to\neliminate these even at T<T$_c$. Based on our microwave data, we determine the\ncritical magnetic field and the critical temperature of Pb in a temperature\nrange between 1.6K and 6.5K and magnetic fields up to 140mT, showing good\nagreement with BCS predictions. We study a Sn sample in a Pb resonator to\ndemonstrate the applicability of superconducting Pb stripline resonators in the\nexperimental study of other (super-)conducting materials in a variable magnetic\nfield.\n", "  In this paper we examine the possibility that intermediate range\nperiodicities in sunspot area can be linked to Mercury or to Mercury-planet\nconjunction periods. We show that peaks at the 45 day Mercury-Jupiter\nconjunction period, the 116 day first harmonic period of the Mercury-Earth\nconjunction and the 289 day period of the sub harmonic\nMercury-Venus/Mercury-Earth conjunctions are prominent in spectra of sunspot\narea. We observe two prominent peaks close to the 88 day Mercury periodicity\nand two prominent peaks close to the 176 day first sub harmonic of Mercury\nperiodicity. To confirm that the peaks arise as sidebands we band pass filter\nthe sunspot area record to isolate the 88 and 176 day components of sunspot\narea. The components occur in episodes of duration from 1.5 to 4 years, with\nsuccessive episodes usually overlapping in time but, for significant intervals\nin the record, the episodes were discrete, i.e. not overlapping. The time\nvariation of the components was compared with the time variation of the tidal\neffect of Mercury. We were able to show that whenever episodes were discrete\nthe component of sunspot area during the episode was either in-phase or in\nanti-phase with the Mercury tidal effect. We interpret this as indicating a\nconnection between planetary motion and sunspot emergence. When several\ndiscrete episodes of the components occurred during a solar cycle the spectrum\nof sunspot area during that solar cycle exhibited periodicities at sidebands to\nthe 88 day or 176 day periods, the periodicity of the sidebands depending on\nthe duration of the episodes. A simple model based on amplitude modulation of\n88 day and 176 day period sinusoids was able to consistently reproduce the\nspectral peaks, or Rieger quasi-periodicities, observed in the spectra of\nsunspot area.\n", "  Polarized Raman scattering spectra of the K_xCo_{2-y}Se_2 single crystals\nreveal the presence of two phonon modes, assigned as of the A_{1g} and B_{1g}\nsymmetry. Absence of additional modes excludes the possibility of vacancy\nordering, unlike in K_xFe_{2-y}Se_2. The ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at\nT_c\\approx 74 K leaves a clear fingerprint on the temperature dependence of the\nRaman mode energy and linewidth. For T>T_c the temperature dependence looks\nconventional, driven by the thermal expansion and anharmonicity. The Raman\nmodes are rather broad due to the electron-phonon coupling increased by the\ndisorder and spin fluctuation effects. In the FM phase the phonon frequency of\nboth modes increases, while an opposite trend is seen in their linewidth: the\nA_{1g} mode narrows in the FM phase, whereas the B_{1g} mode broadens. We argue\nthat the large asymmetry and anomalous frequency shift of the B_{1g} mode is\ndue to the coupling of spin fluctuations and vibration. Our density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations for the phonon frequencies agree rather well with the\nRaman measurements, with some discrepancy being expected since the DFT\ncalculations neglect the spin fluctuations.\n", "  We study $\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ symmetric integrable models solvable by the\nnested algebraic Bethe ansatz. Using explicit formulas for the Bethe vectors we\nderive the actions of the monodromy matrix entries onto these vectors. We show\nthat the result of these actions is a finite linear combination of Bethe\nvectors. The obtained formulas open a way for studying scalar products of Bethe\nvectors.\n", "  We explore Goldstone boson potentials in non-compact cosets of the form\nSO(n,1)/SO(n). We employ a geometric approach to find the scalar potential, and\nfocus on the conditions under which it is compact in the large field limit. We\nshow that such a potential is found for a specific misalignment of the vacuum.\nThis result has applications in different contexts, such as in Composite Higgs\nscenarios and theories for the Early Universe. We work out an example of\ninflation based on a non-compact coset which makes predictions which are\nconsistent with the current observational data.\n", "  We study the transport mechanisms taking place in a quantum spin Hall bar\nwith an embedded quantum dot, where electrons localize and experience Coulomb\ninteraction U as well as spin-flip processes {\\lambda}. We solve the problem\nwith non-equilibrium Green functions. We focus on the linear response regime\nand treat the many-body interactions with quantum Monte Carlo. The effects of U\nand {\\lambda} are competitive and the induced transport takes place through\ndifferent channels. The two mechanisms can be switched by changing the\noccupation of the dot with a gate voltage.\n", "  The notion of $p$-modulus of a family of objects on a graph is a measure of\nthe richness of such families. We develop the notion of minimal subfamilies\nusing the method of Lagrangian duality for $p$-modulus. We show that minimal\nsubfamilies have at most $|E|$ elements and that these elements carry a weight\nrelated to their \"importance\" in relation to the corresponding $p$-modulus\nproblem. When $p=2$, this measure of importance is in fact a probability\nmeasure and modulus can be thought as trying to minimize the expected overlap\nin the family.\n", "  We recently showed that multipartite correlations between outcomes of random\nobservables detect quantum entanglement in all pure and some mixed states. In\nthis followup article we further develop this approach, derive a maximal amount\nof such correlations, and show that they are not monotonous under local\noperations and classical communication. Nevertheless, we demonstrate their\nusefulness in entanglement detection with a single random observable per party.\nFinally we study convex-roof extension of the correlations and provide a\nclosed-form necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement in rank-2 mixed\nstates and a witness in general.\n", "  We propose and analyze a general scheme to create chiral topological edge\nmodes within the bulk of two-dimensional engineered quantum systems. Our method\nis based on the implementation of topological interfaces, designed within the\nbulk of the system, where topologically-protected edge modes localize and\nfreely propagate in a unidirectional manner. This scheme is illustrated through\nan optical-lattice realization of the Haldane model for cold atoms, where an\nadditional spatially-varying lattice potential induces distinct topological\nphases in separated regions of space. We present two realistic experimental\nconfigurations, which lead to linear and radial-symmetric topological\ninterfaces, which both allows one to significantly reduce the effects of\nexternal confinement on topological edge properties. Furthermore, the\nversatility of our method opens the possibility of tuning the position, the\nlocalization length and the chirality of the edge modes, through simple\nadjustments of the lattice potentials. In order to demonstrate the unique\ndetectability offered by engineered interfaces, we numerically investigate the\ntime-evolution of wave packets, indicating how topological transport\nunambiguously manifests itself within the lattice. Finally, we analyze the\neffects of disorder on the dynamics of chiral and non-chiral states present in\nthe system. Interestingly, engineered disorder is shown to provide a powerful\ntool for the detection of topological edge modes in cold-atom setups.\n", "  Quantum theory on manifolds with boundaries have been studied extensively\nthrough von Neumann analysis of self adjoint operators. We approach the issues\nthrough introduction of singular $\\delta$ and $\\delta'$ potentials. The\nadvantages of this are pointed out as a model for black hole and in several\nother examples.\n", "  Cosmological simulations almost invariably estimate the accretion of gas on\nto supermassive black holes using a Bondi-Hoyle-like prescription. Doing so\nignores the effects of the angular momentum of the gas, which may prevent or\nsignificantly delay accreting material falling directly on to the black hole.\nWe outline a black hole accretion rate prescription using a modified\nBondi-Hoyle formulation that takes into account the angular momentum of the\nsurrounding gas. Meaningful implementation of this modified Bondi-Hoyle\nformulation is only possible when the inner vorticity distribution is well\nresolved, which we achieve through the use of a super-Lagrangian refinement\ntechnique around black holes within our simulations. We then investigate the\neffects on black hole growth by performing simulations of isolated as well as\nmerging disc galaxies using the moving-mesh code AREPO. We find that the gas\nangular momentum barrier can play an important role in limiting the growth of\nblack holes, leading also to a several Gyr delay between the starburst and the\nquasar phase in major merger remnants. We stress, however, that the magnitude\nof this effect is highly sensitive to the thermodynamical state of the\naccreting gas and to the nature of the black hole feedback present.\n", "  We study the electric and heat current response resulting from an electric\nfield quench in a holographic model of momentum relaxation at nonzero charge\ndensity. After turning the electric field off, currents return to equilibrium\nas governed by the vector quasi-normal modes of the dual black brane, whose\nspectrum depends qualitatively on a parameter controlling the strength of\ninhomogeneity. We explore the dynamical phase diagram as a function of this\nparameter, showing that signatures of incoherent transport become identifiable\nas an oscillatory ringdown of the heat current. We also study nonlinear\nconductivity by holding the electric field constant. For small electric fields\na balance is reached between the driving electric field and the momentum sink\n-- a steady state described by DC linear response. For large electric fields\nJoule heating becomes important and the black branes exhibit significant time\ndependence. In a regime where the rate of temperature increase is small, the\nnonlinear electrical conductivity is well approximated by the DC linear\nresponse calculation at an appropriate effective temperature.\n", "  We describe progress and initial results achieved towards the goal of\ndeveloping integrated multi-conductor arrays of shielded controlled-impedance\nflexible superconducting transmission lines with ultra-miniature cross sections\nand wide bandwidths (dc to >10 GHz) over meter-scale lengths. Intended\nprimarily for use in future scaled-up quantum computing systems, such flexible\nthin-film Nb/polyimide ribbon cables provide a physically compact and ultra-low\nthermal conductance alternative to the rapidly increasing number of discrete\ncoaxial cables that are currently used by quantum computing experimentalists to\ntransmit signals between the low-temperature stages (from ~ 4 K down to ~ 20\nmK) of a dilution refrigerator. S-parameters are presented for 2-metal layer Nb\nmicrostrip structures with lengths ranging up to 550 mm. Weakly coupled\nopen-circuit microstrip resonators provided a sensitive measure of the overall\ntransmission line loss as a function of frequency, temperature, and power. Two\ncommon polyimide dielectrics, one conventional and the other photo-definable\n(PI-2611 and HD-4100, respectively) were compared. Our most striking result,\nnot previously reported to our knowledge, was that the dielectric loss tangents\nof both polyimides are remarkably low at deep cryogenic temperatures, typically\n100$\\times$ smaller than corresponding room temperature values. This enables\nfairly long-distance transmission of microwave signals without excessive\nattenuation and permits usefully high rf power levels to be transmitted without\ncreating excessive dielectric heating. We observed loss tangents as low as\n2.2$\\times$10$^{-5}$ at 20 mK. Our fabrication techniques could be extended to\nmore complex structures such as multiconductor, multi-layer stripline or\nrectangular coax, and integrated attenuators and thermalization structures.\n", "  We present results obtained for a network of four delay-coupled lasers\nmodelled by Lang-Kobayashi-type equations. We find small chimera states\nconsisting of a pair of synchronized lasers and two unsynchronized lasers. One\nclass of these small chimera states can be understood as intermediate steps on\nthe route from synchronization to desynchronization and we present the entire\nchain of bifurcations giving birth to them. This class of small chimeras can\nexhibit limit-cycle or quasiperiodic dynamics. A second type of small chimera\nstates exists apparently disconnected from any region of synchronization,\narising from pair synchronization inside the chaotic desynchronized regime. In\ncontrast to previously reported chimera states in globally coupled networks, we\nfind that the small chimera state is the only stable solution of the system for\ncertain parameter regions, i.e. we do not need to specially prepare initial\nconditions.\n", "  We consider the self-adjoint Smilansky Hamiltonian $\\mathsf{H}_\\varepsilon$\nin $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ associated with the formal differential expression\n$-\\partial_x^2 - \\frac12\\big(\\partial_y^2 + y^2) - \\sqrt{2}\\varepsilon y\n\\delta(x)$ in the sub-critical regime, $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$. We demonstrate\nthe existence of resonances for $\\mathsf{H}_\\varepsilon$ on a countable\nsubfamily of sheets of the underlying Riemann surface whose distance from the\nphysical sheet is finite. On such sheets, we find resonance free regions and\ncharacterise resonances for small $\\varepsilon > 0$. In addition, we refine the\npreviously known results on the bound states of $\\mathsf{H}_\\varepsilon$ in the\nweak coupling regime ($\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0+$). In the proofs we use\nBirman-Schwinger principle for $\\mathsf{H}_\\varepsilon$, elements of spectral\ntheory for Jacobi matrices, and the analytic implicit function theorem.\n", "  We report results of a search for oscillations involving a light sterile\nneutrino over distances of 1.04 and $735\\,\\mathrm{km}$ in a\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$-dominated beam with a peak energy of $3\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. The data,\nfrom an exposure of $10.56\\times 10^{20}\\,\\textrm{protons on target}$, are\nanalyzed using a phenomenological model with one sterile neutrino. We constrain\nthe mixing parameters $\\theta_{24}$ and $\\Delta m^{2}_{41}$ and set limits on\nparameters of the four-dimensional Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix,\n$|U_{\\mu 4}|^{2}$ and $|U_{\\tau 4}|^{2}$, under the assumption that mixing\nbetween $\\nu_{e}$ and $\\nu_{s}$ is negligible ($|U_{e4}|^{2}=0$). No evidence\nfor $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_{s}$ transitions is found and we set a world-leading\nlimit on $\\theta_{24}$ for values of $\\Delta m^{2}_{41} \\lesssim\n1\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{2}$.\n", "  The unexpected energy spectrum of the positron/electron ratio is interpreted\nastrophysically, with a possible exception of the 100-300 GeV range. The data\nindicate that this ratio, after a decline between $0.5-8$ GeV, rises steadily\nwith a trend towards saturation at 200-400GeV. These observations (except for\nthe trend) appear to be in conflict with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)\nmechanism, operating in a \\emph{single} supernova remnant (SNR) shock. We argue\nthat $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio can still be explained by the DSA if positrons are\naccelerated in a \\emph{subset} of SNR shocks which: (i) propagate in clumpy gas\nmedia, and (ii) are modified by accelerated CR \\emph{protons}. The protons\npenetrate into the dense gas clumps upstream to produce positrons and,\n\\emph{charge the clumps positively}. The induced electric field expels\npositrons into the upstream plasma where they are shock-accelerated. Since the\nshock is modified, these positrons develop a harder spectrum than that of the\nCR electrons accelerated in other SNRs. Mixing these populations explains the\nincrease in the $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio at $E>8$ GeV. It decreases at $E<8$ GeV\nbecause of a subshock weakening which also results from the shock modification.\nContrary to the expelled positrons, most of the antiprotons, electrons, and\nheavier nuclei, are left unaccelerated inside the clumps. Scenarios for the\n100-300 GeV AMS-02 fraction exceeding the model prediction, including, but not\nlimited to, possible dark matter contribution, are also discussed.\n", "  The two-dimensional electron liquid, at the (001) interface between band\ninsulators {L}a{A}l{O}$_3$ and {S}r{T}i{O}$_3$, undergoes Lifshitz transition\nas the interface is doped with carriers. At a critical carrier density, two new\norbitals populate at the Fermi level, with a concomitant change in the Fermi\nsurface topology. Using dynamical mean-field theory, formulated within a\nrealistic three-orbital model, we study the influence of the Lifshitz\ntransition and local electron correlations on the transport properties. We look\nat the thermal conductivity, optical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and\nangle resolved photoemission spectra and find that at a critical density, both\nthe thermal and dc conductivities rise sharply to higher values while the\nSeebeck coefficient shows a cusp. The inter-orbital electron-electron\ninteraction transfers spectral weight near the $\\Gamma$ point towards lower\nenergy, thereby reducing the critical density. In the presence of external\nmagnetic field, the critical density further reduces due to exchange splitting.\nBeyond a sufficiently large field, multiple cusps appear in the Seebeck\ncoefficient revealing multiple Lifshitz transitions.\n", "  Recently, a new method, which can significantly speed up adiabatic quantum\nstate transfer by using dressed states, was proposed by Baksic \\emph{et~al.}\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{116}, 230503 (2016)]. Assisted by quantum Zeno\ndynamics, we develop this dressed-state method to achieve shortcuts to complete\nand fractional stimulated Raman adiabatic passage for speeding up adiabatic\ntwo-atom quantum state transfer and maximum entanglement generation,\nrespectively. By means of some numerical simulations, we determine the\nparameters used in the scheme which can guarantee the feasibility and\nefficiency both in theory and experiment. Besides, we give strict numerical\nsimulations to discuss the scheme's robustness, and the results show the scheme\nis robust against the variations in the parameters, atomic spontaneous\nemissions and the photon leakages from the cavity.\n", "  It has been observed that the locally measured Hubble parameter converges\nquickest to the background value and the dipole structure of the velocity field\nis smallest in the reference frame of the Local Group of galaxies. We study the\nstatistical properties of Lorentz boosts with respect to the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground frame which make the Hubble flow look most uniform around a\nparticular observer. We use a very large N-Body simulation to extract the\ndependence of the boost velocities on the local environment such as\nunderdensities, overdensities, and bulk flows. We find that the observation is\nnot unexpected if we are located in an underdensity, which is indeed the case\nfor our position in the universe. The amplitude of the measured boost velocity\nfor our location is consistent with the expectation in the standard cosmology.\n", "  We explore the possibility of generating a non-zero $U_{e3}$ element of the\nneutrino mixing matrix from tribimaximal neutrino mixing by adding a light\nsterile neutrino to the active neutrinos. Small active-sterile mixing can\nprovide the necessary deviation from tribimaximal mixing to generate a non-zero\n$\\theta_{13}$ and atmospheric mixing $\\theta_{23}$ different from maximal.\nAssuming no CP-violation, we study the phenomenological impact of sterile\nneutrinos in the context of current neutrino oscillation data. The tribimaximal\npattern is broken in such a manner that the second column of tribimaximal\nmixing remains intact in the neutrino mixing matrix.\n", "  Crystalline FeSe is known to display strong nematic order below a weak\ntetragonal-orthorhombic structural transition around $T_s\\sim 90$K, and a\nsuperconducting transition at $T_c\\sim 9K$. Recently, it was shown that\nelectron irradiation, which creates pointlike potential scattering defects, has\nthe surprising effect of enhancing $T_c$ while suppressing $T_s$. Here we\ndiscuss a possible scenario for such an effect, which postulates a competition\nbetween $s_\\pm$ superconductivity and nematic order. The transition to the\nnematic state is modeled by a mean field theory of a $d$-wave Pomeranchuk\ninstability, together with a Cooper pairing interaction in both one- and\nmultiband models. The effect of nonmagnetic impurities on both orders is\ntreated on equal footing within the Born approximation. We find evidence that\ndisorder can indeed enhance $T_c$ while suppressing the competition with\nnematic order, but only in a multiband situation. We discuss our results in the\ncontext of experimental data on FeSe crystals.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a novel and robust maximum likelihood approach to\nlocalizing radiation sources with unknown statistics of the source signal\nstrength. The result utilizes the smallest number of sensors required\ntheoretically to localize the source. It is shown, that should the source lie\nin the open convex hull of the sensors, precisely $N+1$ are required in\n$\\mathbb{R}^N, ~N \\in \\{1,\\cdots,3\\}$. It is further shown that the region of\ninterest, the open convex hull of the sensors, is entirely devoid of false\nstationary points. An augmented gradient ascent algorithm with random\nprojections should an estimate escape the convex hull is presented.\n", "  The CONNIE experiment uses fully depleted, high resistivity CCDs as particle\ndetectors in an attempt to measure for the first time the Coherent\nNeutrino-Nucleus Elastic Scattering of antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor\nwith silicon nuclei.This talk, given at the XV Mexican Workshop on Particles\nand Fields (MWPF), discussed the potential of CONNIE to perform this\nmeasurement, the installation progress at the Angra dos Reis nuclear power\nplant, as well as the plans for future upgrades.\n", "  The maximal energy density that can be achieved in the collisions of the\nparticle-like wave trains in the $\\phi^4$ model has been investigated\nnumerically for different wave train parameters. From these results the\nprediction is made on how many kink-antikink pairs can be produced in wave\ntrain collisions taking into account that in collision of $N$ kinks maximal\nenergy density is equal to $N^2/2$ for even $N$. Our numerical results are in a\nreasonably good agreement with the predicted maximal number of kink-antikink\npairs formed in wave train collisions.\n", "  We present mass and mass profile estimates for the Milky Way Galaxy using the\nBayesian analysis developed by Eadie et al (2015b) and using globular clusters\n(GCs) as tracers of the Galactic potential. The dark matter and GCs are assumed\nto follow different spatial distributions; we assume power-law model profiles\nand use the model distribution functions described in Evans et al. (1997);\nDeason et al (2011, 2012a). We explore the relationships between assumptions\nabout model parameters and how these assumptions affect mass profile estimates.\nWe also explore how using subsamples of the GC population beyond certain radii\naffect mass estimates. After exploring the posterior distributions of different\nparameter assumption scenarios, we conclude that a conservative estimate of the\nGalaxy's mass within 125kpc is $5.22\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, with a $50\\%$\nprobability region of $(4.79, 5.63) \\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. Extrapolating out\nto the virial radius, we obtain a virial mass for the Milky Way of\n$6.82\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ with $50\\%$ credible region of $(6.06, 7.53)\n\\times 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$ ($r_{vir}=185^{+7}_{-7}$kpc). If we consider only the\nGCs beyond 10kpc, then the virial mass is $9.02~(5.69, 10.86) \\times 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$ ($r_{vir}=198^{+19}_{-24}$kpc). We also arrive at an estimate of the\nvelocity anisotropy parameter $\\beta$ of the GC population, which is\n$\\beta=0.28$ with a $50\\%$ credible region (0.21, 0.35). Interestingly, the\nmass estimates are sensitive to both the dark matter halo potential and visible\nmatter tracer parameters, but are not very sensitive to the anisotropy\nparameter.\n", "  The coupled dark energy model provides a possible approach to mitigate the\ncoincidence problem of cosmological standard model. Here, the coupling term is\nassumed as $\\bar{Q}=3H\\xi_x\\bar{\\rho}_x$, which is related to the interaction\nrate and energy density of dark energy. We derive the background and\nperturbation evolution equations for several coupled models. Then, we test\nthese models by currently available cosmic observations which include cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation from Planck 2015, baryon acoustic oscillation,\ntype Ia supernovae, $f\\sigma_8(z)$ data points from redshift-space distortions,\nand weak gravitational lensing. The constraint results tell us there is no\nevidence of interaction at 2$\\sigma$ level, it is very hard to distinguish\ndifferent coupled models from other ones.\n", "  The power radiated by a moving charge is given by Larmor's formula which can\nbe derived by integrating the Li\\'enard-Wiechert potential over the whole past\nhistory of the charge. However, extracting the same result from the\nLorent-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation of motion is problematic. This is well\nknown for uniform proper acceleration for which case the radiation force\nvanishes and hence the very origin of the radiated energy is not clear, leading\nto an energy balance paradox. The purpose of this letter is first to evince\nthat this problem occurs in the general case and not only for uniform\nacceleration. Second we show that the widely accepted treatment based on the\nbound field technique cannot fix the energy balance discrepancy. Indeed the\nrelated Schott term is not a legitimate four-momentum for being indefinite and\nnot conserved.\n", "  It has been observed that photons in the prompt emission of some gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) are highly polarized. The high polarization is used by some\nauthors to give a strict constraint on the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV).\nIf the Lorentz invariance is broken, the polarization vector of a photon may\nrotate during its propagation. The rotation angle of polarization vector\ndepends on both the photon energy and the distance of source. It is believed\nthat if high polarization is observed, then the relative rotation angle\n(denoted by $\\alpha$) of polarization vector of the highest energy photon with\nrespect to that of the lowest energy photon should be no more than $\\pi/2$.\nOtherwise, the net polarization will be severely suppressed, thus couldn't be\nas high as what was actually observed. In this paper, we will give a detailed\ncalculation on the evolution of GRB polarization arising from LIV effect\nduration the propagation. It is shown that the polarization degree rapidly\ndecrease as $\\alpha$ increases, and reaches a local minimum at $\\alpha\\approx\n\\pi$, then increases until $\\alpha\\approx 3\\pi/2$, after that decreases again\nuntil $\\alpha \\approx 2\\pi$, etc. The polarization degree as a function of\n$\\alpha$ oscillates with a quasi-period $T\\approx \\pi$, while the oscillating\namplitude gradually decreases to zero. Moreover, we find that a considerable\namount (more than $60\\%$ of the initial polarization) of polarization degree\ncan be conserved when $\\alpha\\approx \\pi/2$. The polarization observation in a\nhigher and wider energy band, a softer photon spectrum, and a higher redshift\nGRB is favorable in order to tightly constrain LIV effect.\n", "  In this report, we have studied exceptional spectra of the two-qubit quantum\nRabi model in two situations. Firstly, an exceptional spectra is achieved in\nresonant condition, in which the frequencies of two qubit and photon field\nsatisfy resonant relation. With transformed rotating-wave approximation (TRWA)\nmethod, the Rabi model can be mapped into the solvable formation in\nqubit-photon Fock states space. Based on the quantum supperconducting circuits\nexperiment setup, the best value range of the system parameters are discussed.\nIn the resonant station working window, the energy spectrums are calculated.\nSecondly, a special quasi-exact solution of two qubits Rabi model in reservoir\nis achieved. The algebraic structure of Hamiltonian is analyzed in the photon\nnumber space, a closed quasi-exact eigenstates space is found, and the\nquasi-exact solution can be clearly found from the algebraic structure of\nHamiltonian. The results could be used to test quantum Rabi model.\n", "  We pursue, in this contribution, an investigation of the contribution of the\nelectron's magnetic dipole moment (MDM) to the electron's electric dipole\nmoment (EDM) (or the charged leptons, more generally) in the framework of the\nBorn-Infeld Electrodynamics and in a gravity background with a non-vanishing\ncosmological constant, where CP-symmetry is broken down. Our point of view\nconsist in associating a non-trivial EDM to a non-symmetry of the charge\ndistribution of the elementary particle under consideration. The bound on the\nelectron's EDM published in 2014 is used to constrain the coupling parameter of\nthe electromagnetic sector to the scalar curvature of the space-time in the\ncase we consider gravity to be responsible for the asymmetry in the\ndistribution.\n", "  Valley filters are crucial to any device exploiting the valley degree of\nfreedom. By using an atomistic model, we analyze the mechanism leading to the\nvalley filtering produced by a line-defect in graphene and show how it can be\ninverted by external means. Thanks to a mode decomposition applied to a\ntight-binding model we can resolve the different transport channels in k-space\nwhile keeping a simple but accurate description of the band structure, both\nclose and further away from the Dirac point. This allows the understanding of a\ndestructive interference effect (Fano resonance or antiresonance) on the p-side\nof the Dirac point leading to a reduced conductance. We show that in the\nneighborhood of this feature the valley filtering can be reversed by changing\nthe occupations with a gate voltage, the mechanism is explained in terms of a\nvalley-dependent Fano resonance splitting. Our results open the door for an\nenhanced control of valley transport in graphene-based devices.\n", "  We report on a trapped atom interferometer based on Bragg diffraction and\nBloch oscillations with alkaline-earth-metal atoms. We use a Ramsey-Bord\\'e\nBragg interferometer with $^{88}$Sr atoms combined with Bloch oscillations to\nextend the interferometer time. Thanks to a long coherence time for Bloch\noscillations of $^{88}$Sr atoms, we observed interference up to 1 s evolution\ntime in the lattice. A detailed study of decoherence sources during the Bloch\nphase is also presented. While still limited in sensitivity by lattice lifetime\nand beam inhomogeneity this result opens the way to high contrast trapped\ninterferometers with extended interrogation time.\n", "  We demonstrate robust interface strain-induced perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy in atomically flat ferrimagnetic insulator Tm3Fe5O12 films grown\nwith pulsed laser deposition on substituted-Gd3Ga5O12 substrate which maximizes\nthe tensile strain at the interface. In bilayers consisting of Pt and TIG, we\nobserve large squared Hall hysteresis loops over a wide range of thicknesses of\nPt at room temperature. When a thin Cu layer is inserted between Pt and TIG,\nthe Hall hysteresis magnitude decays but stays finite as the thickness of Cu\nincreases up to 5 nm. However, if the Cu layer is placed atop Pt instead, the\nHall hysteresis magnitude is consistently larger than when the Cu layer with\nthe same thickness is inserted in between for all Cu thicknesses. These results\nsuggest that both the proximity-induced ferromagnetism and spin current\ncontribute to the anomalous Hall effect.\n", "  Single crystals of a new ternary aluminide ErV$_2$Al$_{20}$ were grown using\na self-flux method. The crystal structure was determined by powder X-ray\ndiffraction measurements and Rietveld refinement, and physical properties were\nstudied by means of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and\nspecific heat measurements. These measurements reveal that ErV$_2$Al$_{20}$ is\na Curie-Weiss paramagnet down to 1.95 K with an effective magnetic moment\n$\\mu_{eff}$ = 9.27(1) $\\mu_B$ and Curie-Weiss temperature $\\Theta_{CW}$ =\n-0.55(4) K. The heat capacity measurements show a broad anomaly at low\ntemperatures that is attributed to the presence of a low-energy Einstein mode\nwith characteristic temperature $\\Theta_E$ = 44 K, approximately twice as high\nas in the isostructural 'Einstein solid' VAl$_{10.1}$.\n", "  The strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ and the heavy-quark masses, $m_c$,\n$m_b$, $m_t$ are extracted simultaneosly with the parton distribution functions\n(PDFs) in the updated ABM12 fit including recent data from CERN-SPS, HERA,\nTevatron, and the LHC. The values of \\begin{eqnarray} \\nonumber\n\\alpha_s(M_Z)&=&0.1147\\pm0.0008~({\\rm exp.)},\\\\ \\nonumber m_c(m_c)&=&1.252\\pm\n0.018~({\\rm exp.})~{\\rm GeV},\\\\ \\nonumber m_b(m_b)&=&3.83\\pm0.12~({\\rm\nexp.})~{\\rm GeV},\\\\ \\nonumber m_t(m_t)&=&160.9\\pm1.1~({\\rm exp.})~{\\rm GeV}\n\\end{eqnarray} are obtained with the $\\overline{MS}$ heavy-quark mass\ndefinition being employed throughout the analysis.\n", "  Magnetic induction can be regarded as a negative feedback effect, where the\nmotive-force opposes the change of magnetic flux that generates the\nmotive-force. In artificial electromagnetics emerging from spintronics,\nhowever, this is not necessarily the case. By studying the current-induced\ndomain wall dynamics in a cylindrical nanowire, we show that the spin\nmotive-force exerting on electrons can either oppose or support the applied\ncurrent that drives the domain wall. The switching into the anomalous feedback\nregime occurs when the strength of the dissipative torque {\\beta} is about\ntwice the value of the Gilbert damping constant {\\alpha}. The anomalous\nfeedback manifests as a negative domain wall resistance, which has an analogy\nwith the water turbine.\n", "  In this note, I describe the space of vacua $\\mathcal{V}$ of four dimensional\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\\mathbb{R}^4$ with gauge group a compact simple Lie\nGroup $G$ as a stratified space. On each stratum, the low energy effective\nfield theory is different. This language allows one to make precise the idea of\nmoving in the space of vacua $\\mathcal{V}$. A particular subset of the strata\nof $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM can be efficiently described using the theory of sheets\nin a Lie algebra. For these strata, I study the conjectural action of\nS-duality. I also indicate some benefits of using such a language for the study\nof the available space of vacua $\\overline{\\mathcal{V}}$ on the boundary of GL\ntwisted $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on a half-space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times \\mathbb{R}^+$.\nAs an application of boundary symmetry breaking, I indicate how a) the Local\nNilpotent Cone arises as part of the available symmetry breaking choices on the\nboundary of the four dimensional theory and b) the Global Nilpotent Cone arises\nin the theory reduced down to two dimensions on a Riemann Surface $C$. These\ngeometries play a critical role in the Local and Global Geometric Langlands\nProgram(s).\n", "  Bulk single crystals of SrPt3P have been grown for the first time by a\nself-flux method at 2 GPa and 1500 {\\deg}C using the cubic-anvil, high-pressure\nand high-temperature technique. The grown black crystals were found to have\neither a plate-like or pillar-like morphology with maximum dimensions of ~ 1 -\n0.6 - 0.3 mm3. According to a goniometric study the crystals are elongated in\nthe ab-plane with the c-axis perpendicular to the plane. The crystal structure\nwas confirmed by X-ray diffraction (P4/nmm, # 129, Z = 2, a = b = 5.7927(2)\n{\\AA}, c = 5.3729(2) {\\AA} and V = 180.290(11) {\\AA}3). Temperature dependent\nsusceptibility measurements showed a single-phase behaviour and a\nsuperconducting transition temperature of 8.6 K. This value for single crystals\nis slightly higher than that previously reported for polycrystalline SrPt3P.\nThe sharpness of the susceptibility drop ({\\Delta}Tc = 0.07 K) supports a high\nhomogeneity of obtained crystals.\n", "  From the previously obtained solutions of the Fokker - Planck equation for\nRayleigh gas (small impurity of heavy particles in a thermostat of light\nparticles) with sources and without them, the entropy production was\ncalculated. In a system without source (isolated system) shown that it holds\ntheorem of Prigogine, and in a system with sources (open system) implementation\nof the principle of Ziegler (MEPP) depends on the relaxation direction. In an\nopen system entropy production is compensate by a negative production of\nentropy, i.e. by a negentropy production. The algebraic sum of entropy and\nnegentropy productions is called the generalized entropy production. From the\nbalance of entropy and negentropy productions in an open system formulated a\npossible variation of the second law for open systems in a form: \"At the\nrelaxation of an open system to a nonequilibrium steady state, a generalized\nentropy production decreases in absolute value and equal to zero in a\nnonequilibrium steady state.\" Keywords: Fokker-Planck equation, Prigogine\ntheorem, principle of maximum entropy production, the second law, negentropy.\n", "  We study the effects of introducing information inefficiency in a model for a\nrandom linear economy with a representative consumer. This is done by\nconsidering statistical, instead of classical, economic general equilibria.\nEmploying two different approaches we show that inefficiency increases the\nconsumption set of a consumer but decreases her expected utility. In this\nscenario economic activity grows while welfare shrinks, that is the opposite of\nthe behavior obtained by considering a rational consumer.\n", "  Feedback from massive stars is thought to play an important role in the\nevolution of molecular clouds. In this work we analyse the effects of stellar\nwinds and supernovae (SNe) in the evolution of two massive ($\\sim\n10^6\\,M_\\odot$) giant molecular clouds (GMCs): one gravitationally bound\ncollapsing cloud and one unbound cloud undergoing disruption by galactic shear.\nThese two clouds have been extracted from a large scale galaxy model and are\nre-simulated at a spatial resolution of $\\sim 0.01$ pc, including feedback from\nwinds, SNe, and the combined effect of both. We find that stellar winds stop\naccretion of gas onto sink particles, and can also trigger star formation in\nthe shells formed by the winds, although the overall effect is to reduce the\nglobal star formation rate of both clouds. Furthermore, we observe that winds\ntend to escape through the corridors of diffuse gas. The effect of SNe is not\nso prominent and the star formation rate is similar to models neglecting\nstellar feedback. We find that most of the energy injected by the SNe is\nradiated away, but overdense areas are created by multiple and concurrent SN\nevents especially in the most virialised cloud. Our results suggest that the\nimpact of stellar feedback is sensitive to the morphology of star forming\nclouds, which is set by large scale galactic flows, being of greater importance\nin clouds undergoing gravitational collapse.\n", "  In this work, a multiscale approach based on phase field was developed to\nsimulate the microstructure's evolution under irradiation in binary systems,\nfrom atomic to microstructural scale. For that purpose, an efficient numerical\nscheme was developed. In the case of AgCu alloy under Krypton ions irradiation,\nphenomenological parameters were computed using atomistic methods, as a\nfunction of the temperature and the irradiation flux. As a result, we predicted\nthe influence of the irradiation flux and the temperature on the formation of\npatterned microstructures. In the case of AgCu, our model was qualitatively and\nquantitatively validated by a diffraction experimental study.\n", "  The late-time high-resolution X-ray and radio observations of\nGRB980425/SN1998bw, the closest known gamma ray burst (GRB) associated with a\nsupernova (SN) explosion, may have actually resolved the hyperluminal source\nthat produced the GRB and its afterglow. Its hyperluminal speed ~350c is\nconsistent with that expected in the cannonball (CB) model of GRBs. The\nobserved superluminal expansion of the late-time radio image of\nGRB030329/SN2003dh, the GRB with the brightest and longest followed up radio\nafterglow to date, is also consistent with that expected in the CB model of\nGRBs and extrapolates to an apparent early-time hyperluminal expansion.\n", "  We examine Podolsky's electrodynamics, which is noninvariant under the usual\nduality transformation. We deduce a generalization of Hodge's star duality,\nwhich leads to a dual gauge field and restores to a certain extent the dual\nsymmetry. The model becomes fully dual symmetric asymptotically when it reduces\nto the Maxwell theory. We argue that this strict dual symmetry directly implies\nthe existence of the basic invariants of the electromagnetic fields.\n", "  Emergent patterns in complex systems are related to many intriguing phenomena\nin modern science and philosophy. Several conceptions such as weak, strong and\nrobust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and\nontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is\nwhether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is\nrather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this\nquestion, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a\nframework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with\nthe knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a\nparticular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through\nexperiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes\nyielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a\nconceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept\ndisjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints\nof the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the\nnumber and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.\nInterestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global\nconstraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with\nan ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of\nemergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through\nthe active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this\ndefinition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at\nleast for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the\nrelevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward\ncausal influence exerted by natural selection.\n", "  To survive in harsh conditions, motile bacteria swim in complex environment\nand respond to the surrounding flow. Here we develop a PDE model describing how\nthe flagella bending affects macroscopic properties of bacterial suspensions.\nFirst, we show how the flagella bending contributes to the decrease of the\neffective viscosity observed in dilute suspension. Our results do not impose\ntumbling (random re-orientation) as it was done previously to explain the\nviscosity reduction. Second, we demonstrate a possibility of bacterium escape\nfrom the wall entrapment due to the self-induced buckling of flagella. Our\nresults shed light on the role of flexible bacterial flagella in interactions\nof bacteria with shear flow and walls or obstacles.\n", "  In this work we show a strategy for synchronization of three optoelectronic\noscillators (OEO) operating in chaotic regime. Two applications of synchronized\nOEOs in secure communications are considered. In the first one the OEO is used\nto produce a pseudo-random bit sequence. The second application is an optical\nsetup for secure transmission of sampled analog signals. Using numerical\nsimulations, we calculated the bit error rate taking into account parameter\nmismatch noise and Gaussian noise in the input optical power. The conditions\nfor error rate of up to 15% during key generation are shown.\n", "  We study remote creation of coherence (RCC) for a quantum system, A, with the\nhelp of quantum operations on another system, B, and one-way classical\ncommunication.We show that all the nonincoherent quantum states are useful for\nRCC and all the incoherent-quantum states are not. The necessary and sufficient\nconditions of RCC for the quantum operations on system B are presented for pure\nstates. The upper bound of average RCC is derived, giving a relation among the\nentanglement (concurrence), the RCC of the given quantum state, and the RCC of\nthe corresponding maximally entangled state. Moreover, for two-qubit systems we\nfind a simple factorization law for the average remote-created coherence.\n", "  Chromium substituted cobalt ferrite with grain size less than the single\ndomain (approx. 70 nm) has been prepared by the sol-gel method. XRD analysis\nreveals that the samples crystallize to cubic symmetry with spacegroup number\n227. Two transition temperatures (TD (approx. 450 K) and TM (approx. 600 K)\nhave been observed from the impedance verses temperature measurement. TD\nincreases with the increase in frequency due to dipole response to the\nfrequency. TM is comparable with the para-ferrimagnetic transition temperature\nof cobalt ferrite, which is independent of frequency. This result is well\nsupported by the temperature dependent DC conductivity measurement. The\nmodified Debye relaxation could be explained the impedance spectra of\nCoFe2-xCrxO4. The grain and grain boundary effect on impedance spectroscopy has\nbeen observed from Cole-Cole analysis. The ac conductivity follows Arrhenius\nbehavior at different frequencies. All the samples exhibit the negative\ntemperature coefficient of resistance behavior which reveals the semiconducting\nbehavior of the material. The Mott VRH model could explain the DC electrical\nconductivity. Both ac impedance and DC resistivity are well co-related each\nother to explain the electron transport properties in Cr substituted cobalt\nferrite. The electrical transport properties could be explained by the electron\nhopping between different metal ions via oxygen in the material.\n", "  Deformed shell model (DSM) based on Hartree-Fock intrinsic states is applied\nto address two current problems of interest. Firstly, in the $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$\nmodel space with jj44b effective interaction along with isospin projection, DSM\nis used to describe the structure of the recently observed low-lying $T=0$ and\n$T=1$ bands in the heavy odd-odd N=Z nucleus $^{66}$As. DSM results are close\nto the data and also to the shell model results. For the $T=1$ band, DSM\npredicts structural change at $8^+$ just as in the shell model. In addition,\nthe lowest two $T=0$ bands are found to have quasi-deuteron structure above a\n$^{64}$Ge core and the $5^+$ and $9^+$ levels of the third $T=0$ band are found\nto be isomeric states. Secondly, in a first application of DSM to dark matter,\ndetection rates for the lightest supersymmetric particle (a dark matter\ncandidate) are calculated with $^{73}$Ge as the detector.\n", "  A small quantum system is studied which is a superposition of states\nlocalized in different positions in a static gravitational field. The time\nevolution of the correlation between different positions is investigated, and\nit is seen that there are two time scales for such an evolution (decoherence).\nBoth time scales are inversely proportional to the red shift difference between\nthe two points. These time scales correspond to decoherences which are linear\nand quadratic, respectively, in time.\n", "  We establish a global existence theory for the equation governing the\nevolution of a relativistic membrane in a (possibly curved) Lorentzian\nmanifold, when the spacetime metric is a perturbation of the Minkowski metric.\nRelying on the Hyperboloidal Foliation Method introduced by LeFloch and Ma in\n2014, we revisit a theorem established earlier by Lindblad (who treated\nmembranes in the flat Minkowski spacetime) and we provide a simpler proof of\nexistence, which is also valid in a curved spacetime and, most importantly,\nleads to the important property that the total energy of the membrane is\nglobally bounded in time.\n", "  Single photons with orbital angular momentum (OAM) have attracted substantial\nattention from researchers. A single photon can carry infinite OAM values\ntheoretically. Thus, OAM photon states have been widely used in quantum\ninformation and fundamental quantum mechanics. Although there have been many\nmethods for sorting quantum states with different OAM values, the\nnondestructive and efficient sorter of high-dimensional OAM remains a\nfundamental challenge. Here, we propose a scalable OAM sorter which can\ncategorize different OAM states simultaneously, meanwhile, preserving both OAM\nand spin angular momentum. Fundamental elements of the sorter are composed of\nsymmetric multiport beam splitters (BSs) and Dove prisms with cascading\nstructure, which in principle can be flexibly and effectively combined to sort\narbitrarily high-dimensional OAM photons. The scalable structures proposed here\ngreatly reduce the number of BSs required for sorting high-dimensional\nOAMstates. In view of the nondestructive and extensible features, the sorters\ncan be used as fundamental devices not only for high-dimensional quantum\ninformation processing, but also for traditional optics.\n", "  We propose a realization of pure spin currents and perfect valley filter\nbased on a quantum anomalous Hall insulator, around which edge states with\nup-spin and down-spin circulate. By applying staggered sublattice potential on\nthe strips along the edges of sample, the edge states with down spin can be\npushed into the inner boundaries of the strips while the other edge states with\nup spin remain on the outer boundaries, resulting in spatially separated chiral\nstates with perfect spin polarization. Moreover, a valley filter, which is\nimmune to short-range and smooth long-range scatterers, can be engineered by\nadditionally applying boundary potentials on the outmost lattices of the\nsample. We also find that the boundary potential can be used to control the\nsize effect induced oscillation of the inner chiral states. The connection of\nthe boundary potential to size effect is revealed.\n", "  Various materials are made of long thin fibers that are randomly oriented to\nform a complex network in which drops of wetting liquid tend to accumulate at\nthe nodes. The capillary force exerted by the liquid can bend flexible fibers,\nwhich in turn influences the morphology adopted by the liquid. In this paper,\nwe investigate, the role of the fiber flexibility on the shape of a small\nvolume of liquid on a pair of crossed flexible fibers, through a model\nsituation. We characterize the liquid morphologies as we vary the volume of\nliquid, the angle between the fibers, and the length of the fibers. The drop\nmorphologies previously reported for rigid crossed fibers, i.e., a drop, a\ncolumn and a mixed morphology, are also observed on flexible crossed fibers\nwith modified domains of existence. In addition, at small tilting angles\nbetween the fibers, a new behavior is observed: the fibers bend and collapse.\nDepending on the volume of liquid, a thin column with or without a drop is\nreported on the collapsed fibers. Our study suggests that the fiber flexibility\nadds a rich variety of behaviors that may be important for some applications.\n", "  We propose a new classification for the entanglement in graph states based on\ngeneralized con- currence. The numerical results indicate that the eight\ndifferent three-qubit graph states in three categories, 64 four-qubit graph\nstates in five categories and 1024 five-qubit graph states are in ten classes.\nWe also compare this classification with equivalence classes of these graph\nstates under local complementation (LC) operator, and the obtained result\nsuggests that classification by generalized concurrence is not in contradiction\nwith the LC-rule.\n", "  We study the morphology of the radio emission of giant radio galaxies (GRGs),\na rare type of active galaxies, in order to find new clues for the reasons of\ntheir large size. Using radio images from two sky surveys at 1.4 GHz we\nquantified their radio morphology by measuring the geometry (armlength, bending\nangle, etc.) and flux symmetry for 58 such objects. Preliminary analysis\nsuggests that radio source symmetry does not differ between galaxies and\nquasars, that there is no evidence for a decrease in linear size with redshift,\nand only a marginal trend for increasing symmetry with larger size. A merging\nwith data available for other such objects is expected to yield new clues on\nthe possible reasons for their large size. We also searched radio survey images\naround the positions of 1059 galaxies and quasars for further giant radio\nsources, and present a preliminary sample of six of these.\n", "  We present a systematic search for two types of very unusual astronomical\nobjects: Galactic stars and spiral galaxies with double radio lobes, i.e. radio\nemission on opposite sides of the optical object, suggesting the ejection of\njets from them. We designed an algorithm to search for pairs of radio sources\nstraddling objects from two unprecedented samples of 878,031 Galactic stars\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 675,874 spiral galaxy candidates drawn\nfrom the recent literature. We found three new examples of double-lobed radio\nstars, while for the spiral galaxies we only rediscovered one known such double\nsource, confirming that the latter objects are extremely rare.\n", "  A nonlocal nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation was recently found by the\nauthors and shown to be an integrable infinite dimensional Hamiltonian\nequation. Unlike the classical (local) case, here the nonlinearly induced\n\"potential\" is $PT$ symmetric thus the nonlocal NLS equation is also $PT$\nsymmetric. In this paper, new {\\it reverse space-time} and {\\it reverse time}\nnonlocal nonlinear integrable equations are introduced. They arise from\nremarkably simple symmetry reductions of general AKNS scattering problems where\nthe nonlocality appears in both space and time or time alone. They are\nintegrable infinite dimensional Hamiltonian dynamical systems. These include\nthe reverse space-time, and in some cases reverse time, nonlocal nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger, modified Korteweg-deVries (mKdV), sine-Gordon, $(1+1)$ and\n$(2+1)$ dimensional three-wave interaction, derivative NLS, \"loop soliton\",\nDavey-Stewartson (DS), partially $PT$ symmetric DS and partially reverse\nspace-time DS equations. Linear Lax pairs, an infinite number of conservation\nlaws, inverse scattering transforms are discussed and one soliton solutions are\nfound. Integrable reverse space-time and reverse time nonlocal discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger type equations are also introduced along with few\nconserved quantities. Finally, nonlocal Painlev\\'e type equations are derived\nfrom the reverse space-time and reverse time nonlocal NLS equations.\n", "  We investigate the effects of stellar evolution and dust on measurements of\nstellar velocity dispersion in mergers of disk galaxies. $N$-body simulations\nand radiative transfer analysis software are used to obtain mass-weighted and\nflux-weighted measurements of stellar velocity dispersion. We find that the\ndistribution of dust with respect to the distribution of young stars in such\nsystems is more important than the total degree of attenuation. The presence of\ndust typically causes flux-weighted measurements of stellar velocity dispersion\nto be elevated with respect to mass-weighted measurements because dust\npreferentially obscures young stars, which tend to be dynamically cooler than\nolder stellar populations in such systems. In exceptional situations, in which\nyoung stars are not preferentially obscured by dust, flux-weighted velocity\ndispersion measurements tend to be negatively offset with respect to\nmass-weighted measurements because the dynamically cool young stellar\npopulations are more luminous, per unit mass, than older stellar populations.\nOur findings provide a context for comparing observationally-obtained\nmeasurements of velocity dispersion with measurements of velocity dispersion\nobtained from galaxy merger simulations.\n", "  We examine the time evolution of an asymmetric Hubbard dimer, which has a\ndifferent on-site interaction on the two sites. The Hamiltonian has a\ntime-dependent hopping term, which can be employed to describe an electric\nfield (which creates a Hamiltonian with complex matrix elements), or it can\ndescribe a modulation of the lattice (which has real matrix elements). By\nexamining the symmetries under spin and pseudospin, we show that the former\ncase involves at most a 3 x 3 block---it can be mapped onto the time evolution\nof a time-independent Hamiltonian, so the dynamics can be evaluated\nanalytically and exactly (by solving a nontrivial cubic equation). We also show\nthat the latter case reduces to at most 2 x 2 blocks, and hence the time\nevolution for a single Trotter step can be determined exactly, but the time\nevolution generically requires a Trotter product.\n", "  Multiple instruments are pursuing constraints on dark energy, observing\nreionization and opening a window on the dark ages through the detection and\ncharacterization of the 21cm hydrogen line across the redshift spectrum, from\nnearby to z=25. These instruments, including CHIME in the sub-meter and HERA in\nthe meter bands, are wide-field arrays with multiple-degree beams, typically\noperating in transit mode. Accurate knowledge of their primary beams is\ncritical for separation of bright foregrounds from the desired cosmological\nsignals, but difficult to achieve through astronomical observations alone.\nPrevious beam calibration work has focused on model verification and does not\naddress the need of 21cm experiments for routine beam mapping, to the horizon,\nof the as-built array. We describe the design and methodology of a\ndrone-mounted calibrator, the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories\n(ECHO), that aims to address this need. We report on a first set of trials to\ncalibrate low-frequency dipoles and compare ECHO measurements to an established\nbeam-mapping system based on transmissions from the Orbcomm satellite\nconstellation. We create beam maps of two dipoles at a 9-degree resolution and\nfind sample noise ranging from 1 to 2%. Assuming this sample noise represents\nthe error in the measurement, the higher end of this range is roughly twice the\ndesired requirement. The overall performance of ECHO suggests that the desired\nprecision and angular coverage is achievable in practice with modest\nimprovements. We identify the main sources of systematic error and uncertainty\nin our measurements and describe the steps needed to overcome them.\n", "  Halo distribution is a key topic for background study. This paper has\ndeveloped an analytical method to give an estimation of ATF beam halo\ndistribution. The equilibrium particle distribution of the beam tail in the ATF\ndamping ring is calculated analytically with different emittance and different\nvacuum degree. The analytical results agree the measurements very well. This is\na general method which can be applied to any electron rings.\n", "  We describe different approximations associated with employing a constant\nmatrix element for the coupling of light to multiband electrons in the context\nof time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the constant matrix approximation only holds\nfor one of the coordinate representations, and changing to other bases,\nrequires including nonconstant corrections to the matrix element. We also\ndiscuss some simplifying approximations, where a constant matrix element is\nemployed in multiple bases, and the consequences of this further approximation\n(especially with respect to the TR-ARPES signal no longer being nonnegative).\nWe also discuss issues related to gauge invariance of the final spectra.\n", "  Recently, an extremely high superconducting temperature (Tc) of ~200 K has\nbeen reported in the sulfur hydride system above 100 GPa. This result is\nsupported by theoretical predictions and verified experimentally. The crystal\nstructure of the superconducting phase was also identified experimentally,\nconfirming the theoretically predicted structure as well as a decomposition\nmechanism from H2S to H3S+S. Even though nuclear resonant scattering has been\nsuccessfully used to provide magnetic evidence for a superconducting state, a\ndirect measurement of the important Meissner effect is still lacking. Here we\nreport in situ alternating-current magnetic susceptibility measurements on\ncompressed H2S under high pressures. It is shown that superconductivity\nsuddenly appears at 117 GPa and that Tc reaches 183 K at 149 GPa before\ndecreasing monotonically with a further increase in pressure. This evolution\nagrees with both theoretical calculations and earlier experimental\nmeasurements. The idea of conventional high temperature superconductivity in\nhydrogen-dominant compounds has thus been realized in the sulfur hydride system\nunder hydrostatic pressure, opening further exciting perspectives for possibly\nrealizing room temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-based compounds.\n", "  The vortex unsteadiness around a hemisphere-cylinder body at AOAs of 10 to 80\ndeg was studied using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (DMD). The Reynolds number (Re) based on the cylinder diameter of\nthe body is 22000. The results show that vortex oscillations exist over the\nforebody at the whole range of AOAs. The oscillation is characterized by\nalternate oscillations of a forebody leeward vortex pair up and down and\nin-phase swings from side to side. The vortex shedding can be found at the\nafterbody as AOAs more than 20o, and the shedding region moves forwards\ngradually with AOAs increasing, and accordingly the region of vortex\noscillations contracts and eventually only exists near the nose as AOAs\nsufficiently high. The vortex oscillation and shedding all induce fluctuating\nside forces along the body, but the ones from vortex oscillations are larger.\nThe frequencies of vortex oscillations are similar to the ones of vortex\nshedding at the AOAs of 10o-40o with St=0.085-0.12, in which the flow fields\nover the afterbody are dominated by vortex shedding and forebody-vortex wakes\ntogether; while at AOAs of 50o-80o, the frequencies along the body are\napparently divided into two regimes in which the vortex oscillations over the\nforebody have the frequencies of 0.053-0.064, and the vortex shedding over the\nafterbody has the frequencies of 0.16-0.2. The DMD analysis shows that except\nthe mean flows, the most energetic modes correspond to the vortex oscillation\nat the forebody and to the vortex shedding at the afterbody respectively, and\nthe frequencies from DMD are identical to the ones of the side forces obtained\nby fast Fourier transform. The time-averaged flow fields for the vortex\noscillations are symmetric, and no apparent asymmetry exists. Therefore, the\nvortex pair over the forebody oscillates around a symmetric mean flow field.\n", "  This paper is concerned with intermediate range periodicity in the sunspot\narea spectrum. An empirical model of sunspot area emergence based on Mercury\nplanet conjunctions was developed and the spectra of the model variation and\nthe sunspot area variation compared. By including solar cycle amplitude\nmodulation and the effect of solar magnetic field reversal the model was able\nto predict fine detail in the sunspot area spectrum. As Mercury planet\nconjunctions occur predictably it was possible to compare the time variation of\nband limited components of sunspot area with the corresponding component\nvariations in the model. When the model component variation was stable\ncorresponding components of sunspot area lagged the model variation by a few\ntens of days. When a 180 degree phase change occurred in the model variation\nthe corresponding component of sunspot area followed the change over an\ninterval of a few hundred days, first by decreasing to zero and then emerging\nin phase with the model variation. Where periodicities in sunspot area did not\nmatch periods of Fourier components of the model the autocorrelation function\nof the model variation provided an indirect numerical link to these\nperiodicities. Included in these indirect periodicities were components at\nperiods of about 138, 235, 355, 472, 530, 605, 833, 1190 and 2020 days. Direct\nperiodicities in the model, those linked directly to Fourier components of\nsunspot area, included components at about 88, 116, 176, 200, 292 and 405 days.\nThe model was developed without allowing for a variable threshold for sunspot\nemergence. However, it was found that with a variable threshold above which the\nmodel variation is effective in triggering sunspots, weak Fourier components at\nthe indirect periods were generated. The model with threshold then encompasses\nall of the significant intermediate range periodicities in sunspot area.\n", "  Selected theoretical developments in neutrino-nucleus scattering in 2015-2016\nare reviewed.\n", "  We consider the Edwards-Anderson Ising Spin Glass model for non negative\ntemperatures T: We define the natural notion of Boltzmann- Gibbs measure for\nthe Edwards-Anderson spin glass at a given temperature, and of unsatisfied\nedges. We prove that for low enough temperatures, in almost every spin\nconfiguration the graph formed by the unsatisfied edges is made of finite\nconnected components. In other words, the unsatisfied edges do not percolate.\n", "  The structure of the ferroelectric phase of undoped KTiOPO$_4$ and its solid\nsolutions with zirconium and niobium is studied from first principles within\nthe density functional theory. The second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor\nand the spontaneous polarization of these materials are obtained. It is shown\nthat an improvement in nonlinear optical properties of KTiOPO$_4$ upon its\ndoping with Zr and Nb cannot be explained by a systematic change in the\ncomposition of crystals and is apparently associated with the occurrence of\ndefects. Possible structures of such defects are discussed.\n", "  In this work we study the coupled dynamics of social balance and opinion\nformation. We propose a model where agents form opinions under bounded\nconfidence, but only considering the opinions of their friends. The signs of\nsocial ties -friendships and enmities- evolve seeking for social balance,\ntaking into account how similar agents' opinions are. We consider both the case\nwhere opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces\nthe segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one\nclique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded\nconfidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each\nclique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the\nuni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in\nthe other clique, hence defining a \"left clique\" and a \"right clique\". In the\ntwo-dimensional case, our numerical results suggest that the two cliques are\nseparated by a hyperplane in the opinion space. We also show that the\nphenomenon of unidimensional opinions identified by DeMarzo, Vayanos and\nZwiebel (Q J Econ 2003) extends partially to our dynamics. Finally, in the\ncontext of politics, we comment about the possible relation of our results to\nthe fragmentation of an ideology and the emergence of new political parties.\n", "  We investigate radiation-pressure induced generation of the frequency\ncomponents at the difference-sideband in an optomechanical system, which beyond\nthe conventional linearized description of optomechanical interactions between\ncavity fields and the mechanical oscillation. We analytically calculate\namplitudes of these signals, and identify a simple square-root law for both the\nupper and lower difference-sideband generation which can describe the\ndependence of the intensities of these signals on the pump power. Further\ncalculation shows that difference-sideband generation can be greatly enhanced\nvia achieving the matching conditions. The effect of difference-sideband\ngeneration, which may have potential application for manipulation of light, is\nespecially suited for on-chip optomechanical devices, where nonlinear\noptomechanical interaction in the weak coupling regime is within current\nexperimental reach.\n", "  R-matrix calculations on electron collisions with CO are reported whose aim\nis to identify any higher-lying resonances above the well-reported and lowest\n$^2\\Pi$ resonance at about 1.6~eV. Extensive tests with respect to basis sets,\ntarget models and scattering models are performed. The final results are\nreported for the larger cc-pVTZ basis set using a 50 state close-coupling (CC)\ncalculation. The Breit-Wigner eigenphase sum and the time-delay methods are\nused to detect and fit any resonances. Both these methods find a very narrow\n$^2\\Sigma^+$ symmetry Feshbach-type resonance very close to the target\nexcitation threshold of the b $^3\\Sigma^+$ state which lies at 12.9 eV in the\ncalculations. This resonance is seen in the CC calculation using cc-pVTZ basis\nset while a CC calculation using the cc-pVDZ basis set does not produce this\nfeature. The electronic structure of CO$^-$ is analysed in the asymptotic\nregion, 45 molecular states are found to correlate with states dissociating to\nan anion and an atom. Electronic structure calculations are used to study the\nbehaviour of these states at large internuclear separation. Quantitative\nresults for the total, elastic and electronic excitation cross sections are\nalso presented. The significance of these results for models of the observed\ndissociative electron attachment of CO in the 10 eV region is discussed.\n", "  The linear PDE ${\\mathbf B} {\\mathbf L} (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}) u\n={\\mathbf L}_1(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})u +f(x)$ with nonclassic conditions\non boundary $\\partial \\Omega$ is considered. Here ${\\mathbf B}$ is linear\nnoninvertible bounded operator acting from linear space $E$ into $E,$\n$x=(t,x_1,\\dots, x_m) \\in \\Omega, $ $\\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^{m+1}.$ It is\nassumed that ${\\mathbf B}$ enjoys the skeleton decomposition ${\\mathbf\nB}={\\mathbf A}_1 {\\mathbf A}_2,$ ${\\mathbf A}_2 \\in {\\mathcal L}(E\\rightarrow\nE_1),$ ${\\mathbf A}_1 \\in {\\mathcal L}(E_1\\rightarrow E)$ where $E_1$ is linear\nnormed space. Differential operators ${\\mathbf L}, \\, {\\mathbf L}_1$ are\npartial differential operators. In the concrete cases the domains of definition\nof operators ${\\mathbf L}, {\\mathbf L}_1$ consist of linear manifolds\n$E_{\\partial}$ of sufficiently smooth abstract functions $u(x)$ with domain in\n$\\Omega$ and their ranges in $E,$ which satisfy certain system of homogeneous\nboundary conditions. The abstract function $f: \\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^{m+1}\n\\rightarrow E $ is assumed to be given. It is requested to find the solution\n$u: \\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^{m+1} \\rightarrow E_{\\partial},$ which satisfy\ncertain condition on boundary $\\partial \\Omega.$ The concept of a skeleton\nchains is introduced as sequence of linear operators ${\\mathbf B}_i \\in\n{\\mathcal L}(E_i \\rightarrow E_i), \\, i=1,2,\\dots, p,$ where $E_i$ are linear\nspaces corresponding to the skeleton decomposition of operator ${\\mathbf B}.$\nIt is assumed that irreversible operator ${\\mathbf B}$ generates skeleton chain\nof the finite length $p.$ The problem is reduced to a regular split system with\nrespect to higher order derivative terms with certain initial and boundary\nconditions.\n", "  The neutron capture cross sections have been studied near the $Z=50$ closed\nshell for a number of nuclei those take part in heavy element nucleosynthesis,\nthe slow and the rapid neutron capture processes and the proton capture\nprocess. An optical model potential is constructed in theoretical approach by\nfolding the density dependent M3y purely real nucleon-nucleon interaction with\nthe target radial matter density in relativistic mean field (RMF) approach. The\nstandard code TALYS1.8 is used for cross-section calculation. We have presented\nthe Maxwellian-averaged capture cross-section (MACS) values and stellar neutron\ncapture reaction rates at astrophysically relevant thermal energies and\ntemperatures.\n", "  Understanding the intrinsic charge transport in organolead halide perovskites\nis essential for the development of high-efficiency photovoltaics and other\noptoelectronic devices. Despite the rapid advancement of the organolead halide\nperovskite in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, the intrinsic\ncharge carrier transport in these materials remains elusive partly due to the\ndifficulty of fabricating electrical devices and obtaining good electrical\ncontact. Here, we report the fabrication of organolead halide perovskite\nmicroplates with monolayer graphene as low barrier electrical contact. A\nsystematic charge transport studies reveal an insulator to band-like transport\ntransition. Our studies indicate that the insulator to band-like transport\ntransition depends on the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition\ntemperature and defect densities of the organolead halide perovskite\nmicroplates. Our findings are not only important for the fundamental\nunderstanding of charge transport behavior but also offer valuable practical\nimplications for photovoltaics and optoelectronic applications based on the\norganolead halide perovskite.\n", "  \\'Eliashberg theory, being generalized to the case of the electron-phonon\n(EP) systems with the not constant density of electronic states, as well as to\nthe frequency behavior of the renormalization of both the electron mass and the\nchemical potential, is used to study the normal properties and of the metal\nhydrogen phase under pressure of P = 500 GPa. The phonon contribution to the\nanomalous electron Green's function (GF) is considered. The pairing is\nconsidered within the overall width of the electron band, and not only in a\nnarrow layer at the Fermi surface. The frequency dependence of the electron\nmass renormalization ReZ , the density of electronic states , the spectral\nfunction of the electron-phonon interaction, obtained by calculation are used\nto calculate the electronic abnormal GF. The \\'Eliashberg generalized equations\nwith the variable density of electronic states are resolved. The dependence of\nboth the real and the imaginary parts of the order parameter on the frequency\nin the phase is obtained. The value for the metal hydrogen phase at the\npressure P = 500 GPa has been defined.\n", "  Using a combination of low-temperature nanocalorimetry and x-ray diffraction\nwe identify three temperature regimes characterized by distinct Na ordering\npatterns (low temperature up to 290 K, intermediate 290-340 K, and high above\n340 K). Through freezing-in of these patterns we establish the two key roles\nsodium intercalation plays in the formation of the magnetic ground state:\nsupplying the proper electron count for in-plane ferromagnetic interaction and\nthrough the 3D sodium ordering providing the interplane antiferromagnetic\nexchange path.\n", "  While there has been an extended discussion concerning city population\ndistribution, little has been said about administrative units. Even though\nthere might be a correspondence between cities and administrative divisions,\nthey are conceptually different entities and the correspondence breaks as\nartificial divisions form and evolve. In this work we investigate the\npopulation distribution of second level administrative units for 150 countries\nand propose the Discrete Generalized Beta Distribution (DGBD) rank-size\nfunction to describe the data. After testing the goodness of fit of this two\nparameter function against power law, which is the most common model for city\npopulation, DGBD is a good statistical model for 73% of our data sets and\nbetter than power law in almost every case. Particularly, DGBD is better than\npower law for fitting country population data. The fitted parameters of this\nfunction allow us to construct a phenomenological characterization of countries\naccording to the way in which people are distributed inside them. We present a\ncomputational model to simulate the formation of administrative divisions and\ngive numerical evidence that DGBD arises from it. This model along with the\nDGBD function prove adequate to reproduce and describe local unit evolution and\nits effect on population distribution.\n", "  Linguistic laws constitute one of the quantitative cornerstones of modern\ncognitive sciences and have been routinely investigated in written corpora, or\nin the equivalent transcription of oral corpora. This means that inferences of\nstatistical patterns of language in acoustics are biased by the arbitrary,\nlanguage-dependent segmentation of the signal, and virtually precludes the\npossibility of making comparative studies between human voice and other animal\ncommunication systems. Here we bridge this gap by proposing a method that\nallows to measure such patterns in acoustic signals of arbitrary origin,\nwithout needs to have access to the language corpus underneath. The method has\nbeen applied to six different human languages, recovering successfully some\nwell-known laws of human communication at timescales even below the phoneme and\nfinding yet another link between complexity and criticality in a biological\nsystem. These methods further pave the way for new comparative studies in\nanimal communication or the analysis of signals of unknown code.\n", "  This book lays out the scientific goals to be addressed by the\nnext-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, CMB-S4,\nenvisioned to consist of dedicated telescopes at the South Pole, the high\nChilean Atacama plateau and possibly a northern hemisphere site, all equipped\nwith new superconducting cameras. CMB-S4 will dramatically advance cosmological\nstudies by crossing critical thresholds in the search for the B-mode\npolarization signature of primordial gravitational waves, in the determination\nof the number and masses of the neutrinos, in the search for evidence of new\nlight relics, in constraining the nature of dark energy, and in testing general\nrelativity on large scales.\n", "  Nonequilibrium steady state of isothermal biochemical cycle kinetics has been\nextensively studied, but much less investigated under non-isothermal\nconditions. However, once the heat exchange between subsystems is rather slow,\nthe isothermal assumption of the whole system meets great challenge, which is\nindeed the case inside many kinds of living organisms. Here we generalize the\nnonequilibrium steady-state theory of isothermal biochemical cycle kinetics, in\nthe master-equation models, to the situation in which the temperatures of\nsubsystems can be far from uniform. We first obtain a new thermodynamic\nrelation between the chemical reaction rates and thermodynamic potentials under\nsuch a non-isothermal circumstances, which immediately implies simply applying\nthe isothermal transition-state rate formula for each chemical reaction in\nterms of only the reactants' temperature, is not thermodynamically consistent.\nTherefore, we mathematically derive several revised reaction-rate formulas\nwhich not only obey the new thermodynamic relation but also approximate the\nexact reaction rate better than the rate formula under isothermal condition.\nThe new thermodynamic relation also predicts that in the transporter system\nwith different temperatures inside and outside the membrane, the net flux of\nthe transported molecules can possibly even go against the temperature gradient\nin the absence of the chemical driving force.\n", "  Within the field of nanotechnology, nano-scale composites have significant\npotential in the development of advanced materials for functional applications.\nHere, composites based on carbon nanotubes and titanium dioxides have been\nprepared with titanyl sulfate using a chemical bath deposition method at or\nnear room temperature. Two kinds of titanium dioxide depositions corresponding\nto rutile and anatase were sheathed on carbon nanotubes evenly by adjusting the\nprecursor concentration and temperature. Possible composite mechanisms are\ndiscussed. Compared with original tubes, the specific surface areas have been\nimproved nearly four times and the content ratio of mesostructures has also\nbeen increased after deposition processes.\n", "  The case of a rotating object traveling through viscous fluid appears in many\nphenomena like the banana ball and missile movement. In this work, we build a\nmodel to predict the trajectory of such rotating objects with near-cylinder\ngeometry. The analytical expression of Magnus force is given and a wind tunnel\nexperiment is carried out, which shows the Magnus force is well proportional to\nthe product of angular velocity and centroid velocity. The trajectory\nprediction is consistent with the trajectory record experiment of Magnus\nglider, which implies the validity and robustness of this model.\n", "  We prove that reconstruction in the $k$-colouring model occurs strictly below\nthe threshold for freezing for large $k$.\n", "  We present the R-band polarimetric results towards two nebulae L1415 and\nL1389 containing low luminosity stars. Aim of this study is to understand the\nrole played by magnetic fields in formation of low luminosity objects. Linear\npolarization arise due to dichroism of the background starlight projected on\nthe cloud providing the plane-of-the sky magnetic field orientation. The\noffsets between mean magnetic field directions obtained towards L1415 and L1389\nand the projected outflow axes are found to be 35$^{\\circ}$ and 12$^{\\circ}$,\nrespectively. The offset between cloud minor axes and mean envelope magnetic\nfield direction in L1415 and L1389 are 50$^{\\circ}$ and 87$^{\\circ}$,\nrespectively. To estimate the magnetic field strength by using the updated\nChandrasekhar-Fermi relation, we obtained the $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) line velocity\ndispersion value towards L1415 cloud using the TRAO single dish observations.\nThe values of B$_{pos}$ in L1415 and L1389 are found to be 28$~\\mu$G and\n149$~\\mu$G using CF technique and 23$~\\mu$G and 140$~\\mu$G using structure\nfunction analysis, respectively. The values of B$_{pos}$ in these clouds are\nfound to be consistent using both the techniques. By combining the present\nresults with those obtained from our previous study of magnetic fields in cores\nwith VeLLOs, we attempt to improve the sample of cores with low luminosity\nprotostars and bridge the gap between the understanding of importance of\nmagnetic fields in cores with VeLLOs and low luminosity protostars. The Results\nof this work and that of our previous work show that the outflow directions are\naligned with envelope magnetic fields of the clouds.\n", "  The complex-source-point model are already used in the exact solution for the\nurtrashort pulse and nonparaxial beam. In this letter we have used the\ncomplex-source-point model to deduce the interaction potential equation for the\nseparation R between two atoms which is comparable with the size of the atoms.\nWe show the result and the characteristics of the numerical calculation. Since\nthe singular point around R=0 is removed by using the complex-source-point\nmodel, so that we can obtain the result force around R=0. With the decreasing\nof the distance between two atoms, the force switches from the electromagnetic\nforce to the strong force by use our equation.\n", "  The canopy of stars is a central presence in the daily and spiritual lives of\nAboriginal Tasmanians. With the arrival of European colonists, Tasmanian\nastronomical knowledge and traditions were interrupted and dispersed. Fragments\ncan be found scattered in the ethnographic and historical record throughout the\nnineteenth century. We draw from ethnohistorical documents to analyse and\nreconstruct Aboriginal astronomical knowledge in Tasmania. This analysis\ndemonstrates that stars, the Milky Way, constellations, dark nebula, the Sun,\nMoon, meteors, and aurorae held cultural, spiritual, and subsistence\nsignificance within the Aboriginal cultures of Tasmania. We move beyond a\nmonolithic view of Aboriginal astronomical knowledge in Tasmania, commonly\nportrayed in previous research, to lay the groundwork for future ethnographic\nand archaeological fieldwork with Aboriginal elders and communities.\n", "  Relativistic phase space distributions are very interesting objects as they\nallow one to gather the information extracted from various types of experiments\ninto a single coherent picture. Focusing on the four-dimensional transverse\nphase space, we identified all the possible angular correlations providing at\nthe same time a clear physical interpretation of all the leading-twist\ngeneralized and transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions. We also\ndeveloped a convenient representation of this four-dimensional space.\n", "  Damping devices are necessary for suppressing the undesired coil motions in\nthe watt/joule balance. In this paper, an active electromagnetic damping\ndevice, located outside the main magnet, is introduced in the joule balance\nproject. The presented damping device can be used in both dynamic and static\nmeasurement modes. With the feedback from a detection system, five degrees of\nfreedom of the coil, i.e. the horizontal displacement $x$, $y$ and the rotation\nangles $\\theta_x$, $\\theta_y$, $\\theta_z$, can be controlled by the active\ndamping device. Hence, two functions, i.e. suppressing the undesired coil\nmotions and reducing the misalignment error, can be realized with this active\ndamping device. The principle, construction and performance of the proposed\nactive damping device are presented.\n", "  The past decade has witnessed the rapid progress in synthesizing nanoporous\norganic networks or polymer frameworks for various potential applications.\nGenerally speaking, functionalization of porous networks to add extra\nproperties and enhance materials performance could be achieved either during\nthe pore formation (thus a concurrent approach) or post-synthetic modification\n(a sequential approach). Nanoporous organic networks which include ion pairs in\na covalent manner are of special importance and possess extreme application\nprofiles. Within these nanoporous ionic organic networks (NIONs), here with a\npore size in the range from sub-1 nm to 100 nm, we observe a synergistic\ncoupling of the electrostatic interaction of charges, the nanoconfinement\nwithin pores and the addressable functional units in soft matter resulting in a\nwide variety of functions and applications, above all catalysis, energy storage\nand conversion, as well as environmental operations. This review aims to\nhighlight the recent progress in this area, and seeks to raise original\nperspectives that will stimulate future advancements at both the fundamental\nand applied level.\n", "  The two gravitomagnetic effects which influence bodies orbiting around a\ngravitational source are the geodetic effect and the Lense-Thirring effect. The\nformer describes the precession angle of the axis of a spinning gyroscope while\nin orbit around a nonrotating gravitational source whereas the latter provides\na correction for this angle in the case of a spinning source. In this paper we\nderive the relevant equations in quadratic gravity and relate them to their\nequivalents in general relativity. Starting with an investigation into Kepler's\nthird law in quadratic gravity with a scalar field, the effects of an\naxisymmetric and rotating gravitational source on an orbiting body in a\ncircular, equatorial orbit are introduced.\n", "  Using density functional theory and nonequilibrium Greens functions-based\nmethods we investigated the electronic and transport properties of monolayer\nTiS3 pn-junction. We constructed a lateral pn-junction in monolayer TiS3 by\nusing Li and F adatoms. An applied bias voltage caused significant variability\nin the electronic and transport properties of the TiS3 pn-junction. In\naddition, spin dependent current-voltage characteristics of the constructed\nTiS3 pn-junction were analyzed. Important device characteristics were found\nsuch as negative differential resistance and rectifying diode behaviors for\nspin-polarized currents in the TiS3 pn-junction. These prominent conduction\nproperties of TiS3 pn-junction offer remarkable opportunities for the design of\nnanoelectronic devices based on a recently synthesized single-layered material.\n", "  Model of hard sphere system is important part of modern theories of liquids.\nRadial distribution function of hard sphere fluid represented in form of\nexplicit analytical expression allows to obtain thermodynamic potentials in\nanalytical form, which is very helpful for further analysis and applications. A\nnew analytical expression of radial distribution function of hard sphere fluid\nis developed. The density derivative of the radial distribution function and\nthe first two terms of Barker-Henderson perturbation theory are derived as\nanalytical expressions. The obtained results agree well with published\nsimulation data. These results have important implications for real fluid\nmodeling using density functional theory and perturbation theories.\n", "  We introduce a diversity extraction for multicarrier continuous-variable (CV)\nquantum key distribution (QKD). The diversity extraction utilizes the resources\nthat are injected into the transmission by the additional degrees of freedom of\nthe multicarrier modulation. The multicarrier scheme granulates the information\ninto Gaussian subcarrier CVs and divides the physical link into several\nGaussian sub-channels for the transmission. We prove that the exploitable extra\ndegree of freedom in a multicarrier CVQKD scenario significantly extends the\npossibilities of single-carrier CVQKD. The diversity extraction allows for the\nparties to reach decreased error probabilities by utilizing those extra\nresources of a multicarrier transmission that are not available in a\nsingle-carrier CVQKD setting. The additional resources of multicarrier CVQKD\nallow the achievement of significant performance improvements that are\nparticularly crucial in an experimental scenario.\n", "  We define an iterative error-minimizing secret key adapting method for\nmulticarrier CVQKD. A multicarrier CVQKD protocol uses Gaussian subcarrier\nquantum continuous variables (CVs) for the transmission. The proposed method\nallows for the parties to reach a given target secret key rate with minimized\nerror rate through the Gaussian sub-channels by a sub-channel adaption\nprocedure. The adaption algorithm iteratively determines the optimal transmit\nconditions to achieve the target secret key rate and the minimal error rate\nover the sub-channels. The solution requires no complex calculations or\ncomputational tools, allowing for easy implementation for experimental CVQKD\nscenarios.\n", "  There is a supermassive black hole, a gaseous accretion disk and compact star\ncluster in the center of active galactic nuclei, as known today. So the\nactivity of AGN can be represented as the result of interaction of these three\nsubsystems. In this work we investigate the dynamical interaction of a central\nstar cluster surrounding a supermassive black hole and a central accretion\ndisk. The dissipative force acting on stars in the disk leads to an asymmetry\nin the phase space distribution of the central star cluster due to the rotating\naccretion disk. In our work we present some results of Stardisk model, where we\nsee some changes in density and phase space of central star cluster due to\ninfluence of rotating gaseous accretion disk.\n", "  We present a practical strategy to optimize a set of Hybrid Monte Carlo\nparameters in simulations of QCD and QCD-like theories. We specialize to the\ncase of mass-preconditioning, with multiple time-step Omelyan integrators.\nStarting from properties of the shadow Hamiltonian we show how the optimal\nsetup for the integrator can be chosen once the forces and their variances are\nmeasured, assuming that those only depend on the mass-preconditioning\nparameter.\n", "  In this paper, we construct coherent states for each generalized Bergman\nspace on the n-dimensional complex projective space in order to apply a\ncoherent states quantization method. Doing so allows to define the Berezin\ntransform for these spaces. In particular, we provide a variational formula for\nthis transform by means of the Fubini-Study Laplace operator which reduces when\nn = 1 and for the lowest spherical Landau level to the well-known formula\npreviously given by Berezin himself.\n", "  Anomalous random walks having long-range jumps are a critical branch of\ndynamical processes on networks, which can model a number of search and\ntransport processes. However, traditional measurements based on mean first\npassage time are not useful as they fail to characterize the cost associated\nwith each jump. Here we introduce a new concept of mean first traverse distance\n(MFTD) to characterize anomalous random walks that represents the expected\ntraverse distance taken by walkers searching from source node to target node,\nand we provide a procedure for calculating the MFTD between two nodes. We use\nLevy walks on networks as an example, and demonstrate that the proposed\napproach can unravel the interplay between diffusion dynamics of Levy walks and\nthe underlying network structure. Interestingly, applying our framework to the\nfamous PageRank search, we can explain why its damping factor empirically\nchosen to be around 0.85. The framework for analyzing anomalous random walks on\ncomplex networks offers a new useful paradigm to understand the dynamics of\nanomalous diffusion processes, and provides a unified scheme to characterize\nsearch and transport processes on networks.\n", "  The $HZ\\gamma $ coupling, which is highly sensitive to the new physics beyond\nthe standard model, is studied through the process $pp\\rightarrow p\\gamma\np\\rightarrow pHX$ at the LHC. To this purpose, an effective Lagrangian, in a\nmodel independent approach, with dimension six operators is considered in this\npaper. New interaction terms regarding beyond the standard model physics\ninclude the Higgs boson anomalous vertices in both CP-even and CP-odd\nstructures. A detailed numerical analysis is performed to scrutinize the\naccurate constraints on the effective $HZ\\gamma $ couplings and to discuss how\nfar the corresponding bounds can be improved. This is achieved by testing all\nthe efficient Higgs decay channels and increasing the integrated luminosity at\nthree different forward detector acceptance regions. The numerical results\npropose that the Higgs photoproduction at the LHC, as a complementary channel,\nhas a great potential of exploring the $HZ\\gamma $ couplings.\n", "  Diversity, equity and inclusion are the science leadership issues of our\ntime. As our nation and the field of astronomy grow more diverse, we find\nourselves in a position of enormous potential and opportunity: a multitude of\nstudies show how groups of diverse individuals with differing viewpoints\noutperform homogenous groups to find solutions that are more innovative,\ncreative, and responsive to complex problems, and promote higher-order thinking\namongst the group. Research specifically into publications also shows that\ndiverse author groups publish in higher quality journals and receive higher\ncitation rates. As we welcome more diverse individuals into astronomy, we\ntherefore find ourselves in a position of potential never before seen in the\nhistory of science, with the best minds and most diverse perspectives our field\nhas ever seen. Despite this enormous growing potential, and the proven power of\ndiversity, the demographics of our field are not keeping pace with the changing\ndemographics of the nation, and astronomers of colour, women, LGBT individuals,\npeople with disabilities, and those with more than one of these identities\nstill face \"chilly\" or \"hostile\" work environments in the sciences. If we are\nto fully support all astronomers and students in reaching their full scientific\npotential, we must recognize that most of us tend to overestimate our ability\nto support our minoritized students and colleagues, that our formal education\nsystem fails to prepare us for working in a multicultural environment, and that\nmost of us need some kind of training to help us know what we don't know and\nfill those gaps in our education. To that end, diversity and inclusion training\nfor AAS council and leadership, heads of astronomy departments, and faculty\nsearch committees should be a basic requirement throughout our field.\n", "  We present our recent progress in the description of neutrino-nucleus\ninteraction in the GeV region, of interest for ongoing and future oscillation\nexperiments. In particular, we discuss the weak excitation of\ntwo-particle-two-hole states induced by meson exchange currents in a fully\nrelativistic framework. We compare the results of our model with recent\nmeasurements of neutrino scattering cross sections, showing the crucial role\nplayed by two-nucleon knockout in the interpretation of the data.\n", "  We reply to the comment [M. Denis, T. Fleig, arXiv:1605.03091v1 (2016)] on\npaper [L.V. Skripnikov and A.V. Titov, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 024301 (2015)].\n", "  Spatial confinement and manipulation of charged carriers in semiconducting\nnanostructures are essential for realizing quantum electronic devices.\nGate-defined nanostructures made of two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have the potential to add a unique\nadditional control of quantum degrees of freedom owing to valley-spin locking\nof confined carriers near the band edges. However, due to prevailing\ninhomogeneities in the conducting channels, it has been difficult to realize\nquantum confinement in 2D TMDCs with well-controlled tunnel-coupling strength.\nHere we demonstrate quantum transport in lateral gate-defined 2D electron\nquantum dots formed in atomically thin TMDC heterostructures. Utilizing\nmicro-fabricated local contact gates, encapsulation in 2D dielectrics and light\nillumination at low temperatures, we show that the quality of TMDC 2D electron\ngases (2DEGs) can be improved, rendering them suitable for mesoscopic quantum\ntransport measurements. We observe quantized conductance in quantum point\ncontact (QPC) channels controlled by gate-tunable confinement. We also\ndemonstrate single electron transport in TMDC quantum dots (QD) with tunable\ntunnel-coupling. Our observation holds promise for the quantum manipulation of\nspin and valley degrees of freedom in engineered TMDC nanostructures, enabling\nversatile 2D quantum electronic devices.\n", "  We analyze hourly seismic data measured at the Osservatorio Vesuviano Ovest\n(OVO, 1972-2014) and at the Bunker Est (BKE, 1999-2014) stations on the Mt.\nVesuvius. The OVO record is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 1.9.\nWe demonstrate that before 1996 this record presents a daily oscillation that\nnearly vanishes afterwards. To determine whether a daily oscillation exists in\nthe seismic activity of the Mt. Vesuvius, we use the higher quality BKE record\nthat is complete for seismic events with magnitude M > 0.2. We demonstrate that\nBKE confirms that the seismic activity at the Mt. Vesuvius is higher during\nnighttime than during day-time. The amplitude of the daily oscillation is\nenhanced during summer and damped during winter. We speculate possible links\nwith the cooling/warming diurnal cycle of the volcanic edifice, with external\ngeomagnetic field and with magnetostriction that should also stress the rocks.\nWe find that the amplitude of the seismic daily cycle changes in time and has\nbeen increasing since 2008. Finally, we propose a seismic activity index to\nmonitor the 24-hour oscillation that could be used to complement other\nmethodologies currently adopted to determine the seismic status of the volcano\nand to prevent the relative hazard.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between synoptic/local meteorological\npatterns and PM10 air pollution levels in the metropolitan area of Naples,\nItaly. We found that severe air pollution crises occurred when the 850 and 500\nhpa geopotential heights and their relative temperatures present maximum values\nabove the city. The most relevant synoptic parameter was the 850 hPa\ngeopotential height, which is located about 1500 m of altitude. We compared\nlocal meteorological conditions (specifically wind stress, rain amount and\nthermal inversion) against the urban air pollution levels from 2009 to 2013. We\nfound several empirical criteria for forecasting high daily PM10 air pollution\nlevels in Naples. Pollution crises occurred when (a) the wind stress was\nbetween 1 and 2 m/s, (b) the thermal inversion between two strategic locations\nwas at least 3{\\deg}C/200m and (c) it did not significantly rain for at least 7\ndays. Beside these meteorological conditions, severe pollution crises occurred\nalso during festivals when fireworks and bonfires are lighted, and during\nanomalous breeze conditions and severe fire accidents. Finally, we propose a\nbasic model to predict PM10 concentration levels from local meteorological\nconditions that can be easily forecast a few days in advance. The synthetic\nPM10 record predicted by the model was found to correlate with the PM10\nobservations with a correlation coefficient close to 0.80 with a confidence\ngreater than 99%. The proposed model is expected to provide reliable\ninformation to city officials to carry out practical strategies to mitigate air\npollution effects. Although the proposed model equation is calibrated on the\ntopographical and meteorological conditions of Naples, it should be easily\nadaptable to alternative locations.\n", "  We propose and analyze a scheme for conditional state transfer in a\nHeisenberg $XXZ$ spin chain which realizes a quantum spin transistor. In our\nscheme, the absence or presence of a control spin excitation in the central\ngate part of the spin chain results in either perfect transfer of an arbitrary\nstate of a target spin between the weakly coupled input and output ports, or\nits complete blockade at the input port. We also present a possible realization\nof the corresponding spin chain with a one-dimensional ensemble of cold atoms\nwith strong contact interactions.\n", "  A few-degrees-of-freedom Hamiltonian model exhibiting one-directional\nlong-term trends in energy exchange flows is introduced. The model includes a\nmassive potential well - a container with one or few relatively light\nnon-interacting particles \\ - attached to a linearly elastic spring. No\nphenomenological dissipation is imposed, nevertheless, due to a similarity of\nthe container shapes to typical stochastic soft-wall billiards, the energy is\ntransferred from the container (donor) to the inner particles (acceptor) in\nalmost irreversible way during physically reasonable time intervals. The\npotential well is introduced in such a way that, in the rigid-body limit, it\nresembles either Sinai billiards or the so-called Buminovich stadiums as the\nmain geometrical parameter of the well switches its sign. In particular, using\nthe nonlinear normal mode stability concept reveals conditions of stochasticity\nand determines the analogy with the dynamic properties of billiards. Possible\napplications to the design of macro-level energy absorbers, harvesters, and\nenergy absorbing materials are discussed.\n", "  The crystalline structure of ground-state orthorhombic SrRuO$_3$ is\nreproduced by applying hybrid density functional theory scheme to the\nfunctionals based on the revised generalized-gradient approximations for\nsolid-state calculations. The amount of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange energy is\nvaried in the range of $5-20\\%$ in order to systematically ascertain the\noptimum value of HF mixing which in turn ensures the best correspondence to the\nexperimental measurements. Such investigation allows to expand the set of tools\nthat could be used for the efficient theoretical modelling of, for example,\nonly recently stabilized phases of SrRuO$_3$.\n", "  We show that both the energy stored and dissipated by a system with\nhysteretic nonlinearity in an applied field varies with the relative phase of\nthe sinusoidal components of the field, even if the magnitude of these\ncomponents, and thus an effective value of the field, are kept constant. The\nexplored system is a type-II superconductor in the critical state subjected to\na time varying applied magnetic field. Complete analytical expressions for\nhysteresis loops, determined from basic physical phenomena, are known for this\nsystem. A theoretically predicted variation in the energy is in good agreement\nwith our experimental measurements.\n", "  The conformal transformation of the Misner-Sharp mass is reexamined. It has\nrecently been found that this mass does not transform like usual masses do\nunder conformal mappings of spacetime. We show that when it comes to conformal\ntransformations, the widely used geometric definition of the Misner-Sharp mass\nis fundamentally different from the original conception of the latter. Indeed,\nwhen working within the full hydrodynamic setup that gave rise to that mass,\ni.e. the physics of gravitational collapse, the familiar conformal\ntransformation of a usual mass is recovered. The case of scalar-tensor theories\nof gravity is also examined.\n", "  Among quantum Langevin equations describing the unitary time evolution of a\nquantum system in contact with a quantum bath, we completely characterize those\nequations which are actually driven by classical noises. The characterization\nis purely algebraic, in terms of the coefficients of the equation. In a second\npart, we consider general quantum Langevin equations and we prove that they can\nalways be split into a maximal part driven by classical noises and a purely\nquantum one.\n", "  Ideograms (symbols that represent a word or idea) have great communicative\nvalue. They refer to concepts in a simple manner, easing the understanding of\nrelated ideas. Moreover, ideograms can simplify the often cumbersome notation\nused in the fields of Physics and physical Chemistry. Nonetheless only a few\nspecific ideograms for these fields have been defined to date. In this work we\npropose that the scientific community follows the example of Mathematics -as\nwell as that of oriental languages- and bestows a more important role upon\nideograms. To support this thesis we propose ideograms for essential concepts\nin Physics and Chemistry. They are designed to be intuitive, and their goal is\nto make equations easier to read and understand. Our symbols are included in a\npublicly available Latex package (svrsymbols).\n", "  Many interesting phenomena in nature are described by stochastic processes\nwith irreversible dynamics. To model these phenomena, we focus on a master\nequation or a Fokker-Planck equation with rates which violate detailed balance.\nWhen the system settles in a stationary state, it will be a nonequilibrium\nsteady state (NESS), with time independent probability distribution as well as\npersistent probability current loops. The observable consequences of the latter\nare explored. In particular, cyclic behavior of some form must be present: some\nare prominent and manifest, while others are more obscure and subtle. We\npresent a theoretical framework to analyze such properties, introducing the\nnotion of \"probability angular momentum\" and its distribution. Using several\nexamples, we illustrate the manifest and subtle categories and how best to\ndistinguish between them. These techniques can be applied to reveal the NESS\nnature of a wide range of systems in a large variety of areas. We illustrate\nwith one application: variability of ocean heat content in our climate system.\n", "  We report here on the ability of elastic light scattering in discriminating\nGram+, Gram-and yeasts at an early stage of growth (6h). Our technique is\nnon-invasive, low cost and does require neither skilled operators nor reagents.\nTherefore it is compatible with automation. It is based on the analysis of the\nscattering pattern (scatterogram) generated by a bacterial microcolony growing\non agar, when placed in the path of a laser beam. Measurements are directly\nperformed on closed Petri dishes. The characteristic features of a given\nscatterogram are first computed by projecting the pattern onto the Zernike\northogonal basis. Then the obtained data are compared to a database so that\nmachine learning can yield identification result. A 10-fold cross-validation\nwas performed on a database over 8 species (15 strains, 1906 scatterograms), at\n6h of incubation. It yielded a 94% correct classification rate between Gram+,\nGram-and yeasts. Results can be improved by using a more relevant function\nbasis for projections, such as Fourier-Bessel functions. A fully integrated\ninstrument has been installed at the Grenoble hospital's laboratory of\nbacteriology and a validation campaign has been started for the early screening\nof SA and MRSA (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus)\ncarriers. Up to now, all the published studies about elastic scattering were\nperformed in a forward mode, which is restricted to transparent media. However,\nin clinical diagnostics, most of media are opaque, such as blood-supplemented\nagar. That is why we propose a novel scheme capable of collecting\nback-scattered light which provides comparable results.\n", "  We analyze the Mei\\ss ner effect from first principles of quantum mechanics.\nWe show in particular the existence of superconducting states minimizing the\nmagnetic free-energy of BCS-like models and carrying surface currents which\nannihilate the total magnetic induction inside the bulk in the thermodynamic\nlimit. This study is a step towards a complete explanation of the Mei\\ss ner\neffect from microscopic models. It remains indeed to prove that those states\nare dynamically stable, i.e., quasi-stationary at low temperatures. Note that\nour analysis shows that the Mei\\ss ner effect is not necessarily related to an\neffective magnetic susceptibility equal to $-1$.\n", "  We present computer simulations of three systems of randomly branching\npolymers in d=3 dimensions: ideal trees and self-avoiding trees with annealed\nand quenched connectivities. In all cases, we performed a detailed analysis of\ntrees connectivities, spatial conformations and statistical properties of\nlinear paths on trees, and compare the results to the corresponding predictions\nof Flory theory. We confirm that, overall, the theory predicts correctly that\ntrees with quenched ideal connectivity exhibit {\\it less} overall swelling in\ngood solvent than corresponding trees with annealed connectivity even though\nthey are more strongly stretched on the path level. At the same time, we\nemphasize the inadequacy of the Flory theory in predicting the behaviour of\nother, and equally relevant, observables like contact probabilities between\ntree nodes. We show, then, that contact probabilities can be aptly\ncharacterized by introducing a novel critical exponent, $\\theta_{path}$, which\naccounts for how they decay as a function of the node-to-node path distance on\nthe tree.\n", "  Contacts between high critical field superconductors and semiconductor\nnanowires are important in the context of topological quantum circuits in which\nsuperconductivity must be sustained to high magnetic fields. Here we\ndemonstrate gate-tunable supercurrent in NbTiN-Ge/Si core/shell nanowire-NbTiN\njunctions. We observe supercurrents up to magnetic fields of 800 mT. The\ninduced soft superconducting gap measured by co-tunneling through a quantum dot\nis 220 {\\mu}eV. To improve contact transparency, we deposit an aluminum\ninterlayer prior to NbTiN and observe a systematic change in the device\npinch-off voltages with aluminum thickness. We inform future multi-step device\nfabrication by observing that aluminum anneals with the Ge/Si nanowire at\n180{\\deg} celsius, the baking temperature of common electron beam lithography\nresists.\n", "  We present the basic ingredients of continuum optomechanics, i.e. the\nsuitable extension of cavity-optomechanical concepts to the interaction of\nphotons and phonons in an extended waveguide. We introduce a real-space picture\nand argue which coupling terms may arise in leading order in the spatial\nderivatives. This picture allows us to discuss quantum noise, dissipation, and\nthe correct boundary conditions at the waveguide entrance. The connections both\nto optomechanical arrays as well as to the theory of Brillouin scattering in\nwaveguides are highlighted. We identify the 'strong coupling regime' of\ncontinuum optomechanics that may be accessible in future experiments.\n", "  We explore the spectral properties of the time-dependent Maxwell's equations\nfor a plane interface between a metamaterial represented by the Drude model and\nthe vacuum, which fill respectively complementary half-spaces. We construct\nexplicitly a generalized Fourier transform which diagonalizes the Hamiltonian\nthat describes the propagation of transverse electric waves. This transform\nappears as an operator of decomposition on a family of generalized\neigenfunctions of the problem. It will be used in a forthcoming paper to prove\nboth limiting absorption and limiting amplitude principles.\n", "  We show how it is possible to trap two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in\nspatially inhomogeneous magnetic fields, as long as the formed magnetic quantum\ndot (or ring) is of a slowly decaying nature. It is found that a modulation of\nthe depth of the magnetic quantum dot leads to successive\nconfinement-deconfinement transitions of vortexlike states with a certain\nangular momentum, until a regime is reached where only states with one sign of\nangular momentum are supported. We illustrate these characteristics with both\nexact solutions and a hitherto unknown quasi-exactly solvable model utilizing\nconfluent Heun functions.\n", "  In this paper, we describe a possible generalization of the Wasserstein\n2-metric, originally defined on the space of scalar probability densities, to\nthe space of Hermitian matrices with trace one, and to the space of\nmatrix-valued probability densities. Our approach follows a computational fluid\ndynamical formulation of the Wasserstein-2 metric and utilizes certain results\nfrom the quantum mechanics of open systems, in particular the Lindblad\nequation. It allows determining the gradient flow for the quantum entropy\nrelative to this matricial Wasserstein metric. This may have implications to\nsome key issues in quantum information theory.\n", "  Wavelet spectral analysis is applied to the daily indices K (SK) registered\nin Huancayo geomagnetic observatory from 2000.0 to 2015.0, it has become\npossible to identify predominant periodic components with a confidence level of\n95%. In particular we have investigated the periodicity of 27.0 days and its\n13.5, 9.0 and 6.8 harmonics, related to the fundamental period of solar\nrotation effects. A special analysis registered on periods of 59.0 days might\nbe related to the double period of 29.53 days corresponding to the synodic\nmonth. The manifestation of the periods of 182.6, 365 and 730 days\ncorresponding to the harmonics of the seasonal variation of the annual cycle is\nalso observed. An important observation is that the global predominant periods\nregistered 6.8 and 9.0 days, in the years 2009, 2013 and 2014 its effect is too\nsmall or null, those periods corresponds to the minimum and maximum solar\nactivity. On the other hand, it is observed that the order of predominance of\nthe harmonic period solar rotation are different for each solar cycle (Solar\nCycle 23: 9.0, 13.5, 27.0 and 6.8 days; solar cycle 24: 27.0, 13.5, 9.0 and 6.8\ndays), and it is weaker contribution in the solar cycle 24 with respect to the\nsolar cycle 23.\n", "  Quantum measurement is universal for quantum computation. The model of\nquantum computation introduced by Nielsen and further developed by Leung relies\non a generalized form of teleportation. In order to simulate any n-qubit\nunitary transformation with this model, 4 auxiliary qubits are required.\nMoreover Leung exhibited a universal family of observables composed of 4\ntwo-qubit measurements. We introduce a model of quantum computation via\nmeasurements only, relying on state transfer: state transfer only retains the\npart of teleportation which is necessary for computating. In order to simulate\nany n-qubit unitary transformation with this new model, only one auxiliary\nqubit is required. Moreover we exhibit a universal family of observables\ncomposed of 3 one-qubit measurements and only one two-qubit measurement. This\nmodel improves those of Nielsen and Leung in terms of both the number of\nauxiliary qubits and the number of two-qubit measurements required for quantum\nuniversality. In both cases, the minimal amounts of necessary resources are now\nreached: one auxiliary qubit (because measurement is destructive) and one\ntwo-qubit measurement (for creating entanglement).\n", "  Quantum computations usually take place under the control of the classical\nworld. We introduce a Classically-controlled Quantum Turing Machine (CQTM)\nwhich is a Turing Machine (TM) with a quantum tape for acting on quantum data,\nand a classical transition function for a formalized classical control. In\nCQTM, unitary transformations and measurements are allowed. We show that any\nclassical TM is simulated by a CQTM without loss of efficiency. The gap between\nclassical and quantum computations, already pointed out in the framework of\nmeasurement-based quantum computation is confirmed. To appreciate the\nsimilarity of programming classical TM and CQTM, examples are given.\n"]}
