mechanism on an\ninternal spatial cycle and by finite temperature effects. We concentrate on\ninitially flat backgrounds with N=4 and N=2 amount of supersymmetry. Thermal\nand quantum corrections give rise to a non-trivial cosmological evolution. We\nshow that these corrections are under control and calculable due to the\nunderlying no-scale structure of the effective supergravity theory. The\neffective Friedmann-Hubble equation involves a radiation term ~1/a^4 and a\ncurvature term ~1/a^2, whose coefficients are functions of ratio of the\ngravitino mass scale to the temperature.\n", "  We construct uncertainty intervals for weak Poisson signals in the presence\nof background. We consider the case where a primary experiment yields a\nrealization of the signal plus background, and a second experiment yields a\nrealization of the background. The data acquisitions times for the\nbackground-only experiment,T_bg, and the primary experiment,T, are selected so\nthat their ratio varies from 1 to 25. The expected number of background counts\nin the primary experiment varies from 0.2 to 2. We construct 90 and 95 percent\nconfidence intervals based on a propagation-of-errors method as well as two\nimplementations of a Neyman procedure where acceptance regions are constructed\nbased on a likelihood-ratio criterion that automatically determines whether the\nresulting confidence interval is one-sided or two-sided. The first Neyman\nprocedure (due to Feldman and Cousins) neglects uncertainty in the background.\nIn the other Neyman procedure, we account for uncertainty in the background\nwith a parametric bootstrap method. We also construct minimum length Bayesian\ncredibility intervals. For each method, we test for the presence of a signal\nbased on the value of the lower endpoint of the uncertainty interval. When\nT_bg/T is 5 or more and the expected background is 2 or less, the Feldman\nCousins method outperforms the other methods considered.\n", "  Presented here is a review of present knowledge of the long-term behavior of\nsolar activity on a multi-millennial timescale, as reconstructed using the\nindirect proxy method. The concept of solar activity is discussed along with an\noverview of the special indices used to quantify different aspects of variable\nsolar activity, with special emphasis upon sunspot number. Over long\ntimescales, quantitative information about past solar activity can only be\nobtained using a method based upon indirect proxies, such as the cosmogenic\nisotopes \\super{14}C and \\super{10}Be in natural stratified archives (e.g.,\ntree rings or ice cores). We give an historical overview of the development of\nthe proxy-based method for past solar-activity reconstruction over millennia,\nas well as a description of the modern state. Special attention is paid to the\nverification and cross-calibration of reconstructions. It is argued that this\nmethod of cosmogenic isotopes makes a solid basis for studies of solar\nvariability in the past on a long timescale (centuries to millennia) during the\nHolocene. A separate section is devoted to reconstructions of strong solar\nenergetic-particle (SEP) events in the past, that suggest that the present-day\naverage SEP flux is broadly consistent with estimates on longer timescales, and\nthat the occurrence of extra-strong events is unlikely. Finally, the main\nfeatures of the long-term evolution of solar magnetic activity, including the\nstatistics of grand minima and maxima occurrence, are summarized and their\npossible implications, especially for solar/stellar dynamo theory, are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a method to numerically add thermal noise to the equations of\nmotion for a circuit of Josephson junctions. A new noise term, which we call\n\"linearly interpolated Gaussian noise,\" replaces the usual white noise process.\nIt consists of random noise values spaced at a chosen time interval and\nlinearly interpolated in-between. This method can be used with variable time\nstep solvers, allowing more precise control over the error while ensuring that\nfast dynamics are not missed by the solver. We derive the spectral density of\nsuch a noise term and compare it to a white noise process. Then we demonstrate\nthe technique by computing the switching dynamics of a circuit of two Josephson\njunctions and comparing the results to the traditional method.\n", "  A gauge theory is associated with a principal bundle endowed with a\nconnection permitting to define horizontal lifts of paths. The horizontal lifts\nof surfaces cannot be defined into a principal bundle structure. An higher\ngauge theory is an attempt to generalize the bundle structure in order to\ndescribe horizontal lifts of surfaces. A such attempt is particularly difficult\nfor the non-abelian case. Some structures have been proposed to realize this\ngoal (twisted bundle, gerbes with connection, bundle gerbe, 2-bundle). Each of\nthem uses a category in place of the total space manifold of the usual\nprincipal bundle structure. Some of them replace also the structure group by a\ncategory (more precisely a Lie crossed module viewed as a category). But the\nbase space remains still a simple manifold (possibly viewed as a trivial\ncategory with only identity arrows). We propose a new principal categorical\nbundle structure, with a Lie crossed module as structure groupoid, but with a\nbase space belonging to a bigger class of categories (which includes\nnon-trivial categories), that we call affine 2-spaces. We study the geometric\nstructure of the categorical bundles built on these categories (which is a more\ncomplicated structure than the 2-bundles) and the connective structures on\nthese bundles. Finally we treat an example interesting for quantum dynamics\nwhich is associated with the Bloch wave operator theory.\n", "  We present our analytic results for the NLO corrections to the partial decay\nwidth $t\\to H^+b$ followed by $b\\to BX$ for nonzero b-quark mass ($m_b\\neq 0$)\nin the Fixed-Flavor-Number scheme (FFNs). To make our predictions for the\nenergy distribution of the outgoing bottom-flavored hadron (B-hadron) as a\nfunction of the normalized B-energy fraction $x_B$, we apply the General-Mass\nVariable-Flavor-Number scheme (GM-VFNs) in the two-Higgs-doublet model. To\nextract the results we use data from $e^+e^-$ machines in order to describe\nboth the b-quark and the gluon hadronizations in top decay. We find that the\nmost reliable prediction for the B-hadron energy spectrum is made in the GM-VFN\nscheme.\n", "  An optimal dynamical decoupling of a quantum system coupled to a noisy\nenvironment must take into account also the imperfections of the control\npulses. We present a new formalism which describes, in a closed-form\nexpression, the evolution of the system, including the spectral function of\nboth the environment and control noise. We show that by measuring these\nspectral functions, our expression can be used to optimize the decoupling pulse\nsequence. We demonstrate this approach with an ensemble of optically trapped\nultra-cold Rubidium atoms, and use quantum process tomography to identify the\neffect of the environment and control noise. Our approach is applicable and\nimportant for any realistic implementation of quantum information processing.\n", "  Based on a detailed symmetry analysis, we state the general rules to build up\nthe effective low energy field theory describing a system of electrons weakly\ninteracting with the lattice degrees of freedom. The basic elements in our\nconstruction are what we call the \"memory tensors\", that keep track of the\nmicroscopic discrete symmetries into the coarse-grained action. The present\napproach can be applied to lattice systems in arbitrary dimensions and in a\nsystematic way to any desired order in derivatives. We apply the method to the\nhoneycomb lattice and re-obtain the by now well-known effective action of Dirac\nfermions coupled to fictitious gauge fields. As a second example, we derive the\neffective action for electrons in the kagom\\'e lattice, where our approach\nallows to obtain in a simple way the low energy electron-phonon coupling terms.\n", "  The dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states with large transverse\nmomentum is fragmentation, that is the splitting of a high energy parton into a\nhadronic state and other partons. We review the present schemes to calculate\nthe heavy quark fragmentation functions (FFs) and drive an exact analytical\nexpression of FF which includes most of the kinematical and dynamical\nproperties of the process. Using the perturbative QCD, we calculate the FF for\nc-quark to split into S-wave D-meson to leading order in the QCD coupling\nconstant. Our result is compared with the current well-known phenomenological\nmodels which are obtained through a global fit to e+e- data from SLAC SLC and\nCERN LEP1 and we also compare the FF with experimental data form BELLE and\nCLEO. Specically, we study the effect of outgoing meson mass on the pQCD FF.\nMeson masses are responsible for the low-z threshold, where z is the scaled\nenergy variable.\n", "  Analysis of the Fermi-LAT data has revealed two extended structures above and\nbelow the Galactic Centre emitting gamma rays with a hard spectrum, the\nso-called Fermi bubbles. Hadronic models attempting to explain the origin of\nthe Fermi bubbles predict the emission of high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays\nwith similar fluxes. The ANTARES detector, a neutrino telescope located in the\nMediterranean Sea, has a good visibility to the Fermi bubble regions. Using\ndata collected from 2008 to 2011 no statistically significant excess of events\nis observed and therefore upper limits on the neutrino flux in TeV range from\nthe Fermi bubbles are derived for various assumed energy cutoffs of the source.\n", "  We consider the decay of a polarized top quark into a stable $W^+$ boson and\ncharmed-flavored (D) or bottom-flavored (B) hadrons, via\n$t(\\uparrow)\\rightarrow W^++D/B+X$. We study the angular distribution of the\nscaled-energy of B/D-hadrons at next-to-leading order (NLO) considering the\ncontribution of bottom and gluon fragmentations into the heavy mesons B and D.\nTo obtain the energy spectrum of B/D-hadrons we present our analytical\nexpressions for the parton-level differential decay widths of\n$t(\\uparrow)\\rightarrow b+W^+(+g)$ at NLO. Comparison of our predictions with\ndata at the LHC enable us to test the universality and scaling violations of\nthe B- and D-hadron fragmentation functions (FFs). These can also be used to\ndetermine the polarization states of top quarks and since the energy\ndistributions depend on the ratio $m_W /m_t$ we advocate the use of such\nangular decay measurements for the determination of the top quark's mass.\n", "  Fragmentation is the dominant production mechanism for heavy hadronic bound\nstates with large transverse momentum. We numerically calculate the initial\n$g\\rightarrow H(Q\\bar{Q})$ fragmentation functions (FFs) using the\nnonrelativistic QCD factorization approach. Our analytical expression of FFs\ndepends on both the momentum fraction $z$ and the transverse momentum of the\ngluon, and contains most of the kinematical and dynamical properties of the\nprocess. Specifically, using the perturbative QCD we present the FF for a gluon\nto split into $S$-wave charmonium meson $H_c$ to leading order in the QCD\ncoupling constant.\n", "  In the present work we derive an exact solution of an isotropic and\nhomogeneous Universe governed by $f(T)$ gravity. We show how the torsion\ncontribution to the FRW cosmology can provide a \\textit{unique} origin for both\nearly and late acceleration phases of the Universe. The three models ($k=0, \\pm\n1$) show a \\textit{built-in} inflationary behavior at some early Universe time;\nthey restore suitable conditions for the hot big bang nucleosynthesis to begin.\nUnlike the standard cosmology, we show that even if the Universe initially\nstarted with positive or negative sectional curvatures, the curvature density\nparameter enforces evolution to a flat Universe. The solution constrains the\ntorsion scalar $T$ to be a constant function at all time $t$, for the three\nmodels. This eliminates the need for the dark energy (DE). Moreover, when the\ncontinuity equation is assumed for the torsion fluid, we show that the flat and\nclosed Universe models \\textit{violate} the conservation principle, while the\nopen one does not. The evolution of the effective equation of state (EoS) of\nthe torsion fluid implies a peculiar trace from a quintessence-like DE to a\nphantom-like one crossing a matter and radiation EoS in between; then it\nasymptotically approaches a de Sitter fate.\n", "  The existence of a die-out threshold (different from the classic\ndisease-invasion one) defining a region of slow extinction of an epidemic has\nbeen proved elsewhere for susceptible-aware-infectious-susceptible models\nwithout awareness decay, through bifurcation analysis. By means of an\nequivalent mean-field model defined on regular random networks, we interpret\nthe dynamics of the system in this region and prove that the existence of\nbifurcation for this second epidemic threshold crucially depends on the absence\nof awareness decay. We show that the continuum of equilibria that characterizes\nthe slow die-out dynamics collapses into a unique equilibrium when a constant\nrate of awareness decay is assumed, no matter how small, and that the resulting\nbifurcation from the disease-free equilibrium is equivalent to that of standard\nepidemic models. We illustrate these findings with continuous-time stochastic\nsimulations on regular random networks with different degrees. Finally, the\nbehaviour of solutions with and without decay in awareness is compared around\nthe second epidemic threshold for a small rate of awareness decay.\n", "  We use the first release of the VImos Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey of\ngalaxies (VIPERS) of ~50,000 objects to measure the biasing relation between\ngalaxies and mass in the redshift range z=[0.5,1.1]. We estimate the 1-point\ndistribution function [PDF] of VIPERS galaxies from counts in cells and,\nassuming a model for the mass PDF, we infer their mean bias relation. The\nreconstruction of the bias relation from PDFs is performed through a novel\nmethod that accounts for Poisson noise, redshift distortions, inhomogeneous sky\ncoverage and other selection effects. With this procedure we constrain galaxy\nbias and its deviations from linearity down to scales as small as 4 Mpc/h and\nout to z=1.1. We detect small (~3%) but significant deviations from linear\nbias. The mean biasing function is close to linear in regions above the mean\ndensity. The mean slope of the biasing relation is a proxy to the linear bias\nparameter. It increases both with luminosity, in agreement with results of\nprevious analyses, and with redshift. However, we detect a strong bias\nevolution only for z>0.9 in agreement with some, but not all, previous studies.\nWe also detected a significant increase of the bias with the scale, from 4 to 8\nMpc/h, now seen for the first time out to z=1. The amplitude of nonlinearity\ndepends on redshift, luminosity and on scales but no clear trend is detected.\nThanks to the large cosmic volume probed by VIPERS we find that the mismatch\nbetween the previous estimates of bias at z~1 from zCOSMOS and VVDS-Deep galaxy\nsamples is fully accounted for by cosmic variance. The results of our work\nconfirm the importance of going beyond the over-simplistic linear bias\nhypothesis showing that non-linearities can be accurately measured through the\napplications of the appropriate statistical tools to existing datasets like\nVIPERS.\n", "  We show that the time-dependent variational principle provides a unifying\nframework for time-evolution methods and optimisation methods in the context of\nmatrix product states. In particular, we introduce a new integration scheme for\nstudying time-evolution, which can cope with arbitrary Hamiltonians, including\nthose with long-range interactions. Rather than a Suzuki-Trotter splitting of\nthe Hamiltonian, which is the idea behind the adaptive time-dependent density\nmatrix renormalization group method or time-evolving block decimation, our\nmethod is based on splitting the projector onto the matrix product state\ntangent space as it appears in the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational\nprinciple. We discuss how the resulting algorithm resembles the density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finding ground states so closely\nthat it can be implemented by changing just a few lines of code and it inherits\nthe same stability and efficiency. In particular, our method is compatible with\nany Hamiltonian for which DMRG can be implemented efficiently and DMRG is\nobtained as a special case of imaginary time evolution with infinite time step.\n", "  We study a single fluid component in a flat like universe (FLU) governed by\n$f(T)$ gravity theories, where $T$ is the teleparallel torsion scalar. The FLU\nmodel, regardless the value of the spatial curvature $k$, identifies a special\nclass of $f(T)$ gravity theories. Remarkably, the FLU $f(T)$ gravity does not\nreduce to teleparallel gravity theory. In large Hubble spacetime the theory is\nconsistent with the inflationary universe scenario and respects the\nconservation principle. The equation of state (EoS) evolves similarly in all\nmodels $k=0, \\pm 1$. We study the case when the torsion tensor is made of a\nscalar field, which enables to derive a quintessence potential from the\nobtained $f(T)$ gravity theory. The potential produces Starobinsky-like model\nnaturally without using a conformal transformation, with higher orders\ncontinuously interpolate between Starobinsky and quadratic inflation models.\nThe slow-roll analysis shows double solutions so that for a single value of the\nscalar tilt (spectral index) $n_{s}$ the theory can predict double\ntensor-to-scalar ratios $r$ of $E$-mode and $B$-mode polarizations.\n", "  Peculiar motion introduces systematic variations in the observed luminosity\ndistribution of galaxies. This allows one to constrain the cosmic peculiar\nvelocity field from large galaxy redshift surveys. Using around half a million\ngalaxies from the SDSS Data Release 7 at z ~ 0.1, we demonstrate the\napplicability of this approach to large datasets and obtain bounds on peculiar\nvelocity moments and $\\sigma_{8}$, the amplitude of the linear matter power\nspectrum. Our results are in good agreement with the $\\Lambda$CDM model and\nconsistent with the previously reported ~ 1% zero-point tilt in the SDSS\nphotometry. Finally, we discuss the prospects of constraining the growth rate\nof density perturbations by reconstructing the full linear velocity field from\nthe observed galaxy clustering in redshift space.\n", "  Nonlinear spectroscopy employs a series of laser pulses to interrogate\ndynamics in large interacting many-body systems, and has become a highly\nsuccessful method for experiments in chemical physics. Current quantum optical\nexperiments approach system sizes and levels of complexity which require the\ndevelopment of efficient techniques to assess spectral and dynamical features\nwith scalable experimental overhead. However, established methods from optical\nspectroscopy of macroscopic ensembles cannot be applied straightforwardly to\nfew-atom systems. Based on the ideas proposed in [M. Gessner et al. New J.\nPhys. 16 092001 (2014)], we develop a diagrammatic approach to construct\nnonlinear measurement protocols for controlled quantum systems and discuss\nexperimental implementations with trapped ion technology in detail. These\nmethods in combination with distinct features of ultra-cold matter systems\nallow us to monitor and analyze excitation dynamics in both the electronic and\nvibrational degrees of freedom. They are independent of system size, and can\ntherefore reliably probe systems where, e.g., quantum state tomography becomes\nprohibitively expensive. We propose signals that can probe steady state\ncurrents, detect the influence of anharmonicities on phonon transport, and\nidentify signatures of chaotic dynamics near a quantum phase transition in an\nIsing-type spin chain.\n", "  We derive an exact $f(T)$ gravity in the absence of ordinary matter in\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, where $T$ is the teleparallel\ntorsion scalar. We show that vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor\n$\\mathcal{T}^{\\mu \\nu}$ of matter does not imply vanishing of the teleparallel\ntorsion scalar, in contrast to general relativity, where the Ricci scalar\nvanishes. The theory provides an exponential (inflationary) scale factor\nindependent of the choice of the sectional curvature. In addition, the obtained\n$f(T)$ acts just like cosmological constant in the flat space model.\nNevertheless, it is dynamical in non-flat models. In particular, the open\nuniverse provides a decaying pattern of the $f(T)$ contributing directly to\nsolve the fine-tuning problem of the cosmological constant. The equation of\nstate (EoS) of the torsion vacuum fluid has been studied in positive and\nnegative Hubble regimes. We study the case when the torsion is made of a scalar\nfield (tlaplon) which acts as torsion potential. This treatment enables to\ninduce a tlaplon field sensitive to the symmetry of the spacetime in addition\nto the reconstruction of its effective potential from the $f(T)$ theory. The\ntheory provides six different versions of inflationary models. The real\nsolutions are mainly quadratic, the complex solutions, remarkably, provide\nHiggs-like potential.\n", "  We study a model describing the force-extension curves of modular proteins,\nnucleic acids, and other biomolecules made out of several single units or\nmodules. At a mesoscopic level of description, the configuration of the system\nis given by the elongations of each of the units. The system free energy\nincludes a double-well potential for each unit and an elastic nearest neighbor\ninteraction between them. Minimizing the free energy yields the system\nequilibrium properties whereas its dynamics is given by (overdamped) Langevin\nequations for the elongations, in which friction and noise amplitude are\nrelated by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Our results, both for the\nequilibrium and the dynamical situations, include analytical and numerical\ndescriptions of the system force-extension curves under force or length\ncontrol, and agree very well with actual experiments in biomolecules. Our\nconclusions also apply to other physical systems comprising a number of\nmetastable units, such as storage systems or semiconductor superlattices.\n", "  We study the formation and evolution of the cosmic web, using the\nhigh-resolution CosmoGrid \\$\\Lambda\\$CDM simulation. In particular, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the large-scale structure around void halo groups,\nand compare this to observations of the VGS-31 galaxy group, which consists of\nthree interacting galaxies inside a large void. The structure around such\nhaloes shows a great deal of tenuous structure, with most of such systems being\nembedded in intra-void filaments and walls. We use the Nexus+ algorithm to\ndetect walls and filaments in CosmoGrid, and find them to be present and\ndetectable at every scale. The void regions embed tenuous walls, which in turn\nembed tenuous filaments. We hypothesize that the void galaxy group of VGS-31\nformed in such an environment.\n", "  The entanglement entropy correlates two quantum sub-systems which are the\npart of the larger system. A logarithmic divergence term present in the\nentanglement entropy is universal in nature and directly proportional to the\nconformal anomaly.\n  We study this logarithmic divergence term of entropy for massive scalar field\nin $(2+1)$ dimension by applying numerical techniques to entanglement entropy\napproach.\n  This (2+1) dimensional massive theory can be obtained from (3+1) dimensional\nmassless scalar field via dimensional reduction. We also calculated mass\ncorrections to entanglement entropy for scalar field. Finally, we observe that\nthe area law contribution to the entanglement entropy is not affected by this\nmass term and the universal quantities depends upon the basic properties of the\nsystem.\n", "  We investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of the cosmic web\nfrom redshift, z=2, to present time, within the framework of the NEXUS+\nalgorithm. This necessitates the introduction of new analysis tools optimally\nsuited to describe the very intricate and hierarchical pattern that is the\ncosmic web. In particular, we characterize filaments (walls) in terms of their\nlinear (surface) mass density. This is very good in capturing the evolution of\nthese structures. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments\nand sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the\npresent day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. We\nalso show that voids are more naturally described in terms of their boundaries\nand not their centres. We illustrate this for void density profiles, which,\nwhen expressed as a function of the distance from void boundary, show a\nuniversal profile in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical\nshell-crossing framework of expanding underdense regions.\n", "  We present the structural and star formation properties of 59 void galaxies\nas part of the Void Galaxy Survey (VGS). Our aim is to study in detail the\nphysical properties of these void galaxies and study the effect of the void\nenvironment on galaxy properties. We use Spitzer 3.6 $\\rm{\\mu m}$ and B-band\nimaging to study the morphology and color of the VGS galaxies. For their star\nformation properties, we use Halpha and GALEX near-UV imaging. We compare our\nresults to a range of galaxies of different morphologies in higher density\nenvironments. We find that the VGS galaxies are in general disk dominated and\nstar forming galaxies. Their star formation rates are, however, often less than\n1 $\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ $\\rm{yr^{-1}}$. There are two early-type galaxies in our\nsample as well. In $\\rm{r_{e}}$ versus $\\rm{M_{B}}$ parameter space, VGS\ngalaxies occupy the same space as dwarf irregulars and spirals.\n", "  We study the large-scale structure with superclusters from the REFLEX X-ray\ncluster survey together with cosmological N-body simulations. It is important\nto construct superclusters with criteria such that they are homogeneous in\ntheir properties. We lay out our theoretical concept considering future\nevolution of superclusters in their definition, and show that the X-ray\nluminosity and halo mass functions of clusters in superclusters are found to be\ntop-heavy, different from those of clusters in the field. We also show a\npromising aspect of using superclusters to study the local cluster bias and\nmass scaling relation with simulations.\n", "  A system of atoms connected by harmonic springs to their nearest neighbors on\na lattice is coupled to Ising spins that are in contact with a thermal bath and\nevolve under Glauber dynamics. Assuming a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic\ninteraction between spins, we calculate analytically the equilibrium state. On\na one-dimensional attice, the system exhibits first and second order phase\ntransitions. The order parameters are the total magnetization and the number of\nspin pairs in an antiferromagnetic configuration. On a hexagonal two\ndimensional lattice, spins interact with their nearest-neighbors and\nnext-nearest-neighbors. Together with the coupling to atoms, these interactions\nproduce a complex behavior that is displayed on a phase diagram. There are:\nordered phases associated to ripples with atomic wavelength and\nantiferromagnetic order, ordered phases associated to ripples with nanometer\nwavelengths and ferromagnetic order, disordered glassy phases, and other phases\npresenting stripes formed by different domains. These static phases are\ndiscussed in relation to existing experiments and results for other models\nfound in the literature.\n", "  Consider the $3$-dimensional $\\mathcal N=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory\nassociated with a compact Lie group $G$ and its quaternionic representation\n$\\mathbf M$. Physicists study its Coulomb branch, which is a noncompact\nhyper-K\\\"ahler manifold, such as instanton moduli spaces on $\\mathbb R^4$,\n$SU(2)$-monopole moduli spaces on $\\mathbb R^3$, etc. In this paper and its\nsequel, we propose a mathematical definition of the coordinate ring of the\nCoulomb branch, using the vanishing cycle cohomology group of a certain moduli\nspace for a gauged $\\sigma$-model on the $2$-sphere associated with $(G,\\mathbf\nM)$. In this first part, we check that the cohomology group has the correct\ngraded dimensions expected from the monopole formula proposed by Cremonesi,\nHanany and Zaffaroni arXiv:1309.2657. A ring structure (on the cohomology of a\nmodified moduli space) will be introduced in the sequel of this paper.\n", "  We construct rigid supersymmetric gauge theories on Riemannian\nfive-manifolds. We follow a holographic approach, realizing the manifold as the\nconformal boundary of a six-dimensional bulk supergravity solution. This leads\nto a systematic classification of five-dimensional supersymmetric backgrounds\nwith gravity duals. We show that the background metric is furnished with a\nconformal Killing vector, which generates a transversely holomorphic foliation\nwith a transverse Hermitian structure. Moreover, we prove that any such metric\ndefines a supersymmetric background. Finally, we construct supersymmetric\nLagrangians for gauge theories coupled to arbitrary matter on such backgrounds.\n", "  Coherent alignments of galaxy shapes, often called \"intrinsic alignments\"\n(IA), are the most significant source of astrophysical uncertainty in weak\nlensing measurements. We develop the tidal alignment model of IA and\ndemonstrate its success in describing observational data. We also describe a\ntechnique to separate IA from galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. Applying this\ntechnique to luminous red galaxy lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we\nconstrain potential IA contamination from associated sources to be below a few\npercent.\n", "  Single photon detectors are fundamental tools of investigation in quantum\noptics and play a central role in measurement theory and quantum informatics.\nPhotodetectors based on different technologies exist at optical frequencies and\nmuch effort is currently being spent on pushing their efficiencies to meet the\ndemands coming from the quantum computing and quantum communication proposals.\nIn the microwave regime however, a single photon detector has remained elusive\nalthough several theoretical proposals have been put forth. In this article, we\nreview these recent proposals, especially focusing on non-destructive detectors\nof propagating microwave photons. These detection schemes using superconducting\nartificial atoms can reach detection efficiencies of 90\\% with existing\ntechnologies and are ripe for experimental investigations.\n", "  Computing the holographic entanglement entropy proposed by Ryu-Takayanagi\nshows that thermal energy near boundary region in $AdS_3$ gain maximum of the\ntemperature. The absolute maxima of temperature is $T^{Max}_{E}= \\frac{4G_3\n\\epsilon_{\\infty}}{l}$. By simple physical investigations it has become\npossible to predict a phase transition of first order at critical temperature\n$T_c\\leq T_{E}$. As they predict a tail or root towards which the AdS space\nultimately tend, the boundary is considered thermalized. The Phase transitions\nof this form have received striking theoretical and experimental verifications\nso far.\n", "  Many microfluidic devices use macroscopic pressure differentials to overcome\nviscous friction and generate flows in microchannels. In this work, we\ninvestigate how the chemical and geometric properties of the channel walls can\ndrive a net flow by exploiting the autophoretic slip flows induced along active\nwalls by local concentration gradients of a solute species. We show that\nchemical patterning of the wall is not required to generate and control a net\nflux within the channel, rather channel geometry alone is sufficient. Using\nnumerical simulations, we determine how geometric characteristics of the wall\ninfluence channel flow rate, and confirm our results analytically in the\nasymptotic limit of lubrication theory.\n", "  We consider evolution properties of galaxies and quasars with steep radio\nspectrum at the decametre band from the UTR-2 catalogue. The ratios of source's\nmonochromatic luminosities at the decametre and high-frequency bands display\nthe dependence on the redshift, linear size, characteristic age of examined\nobjects. At that, the mean values of corresponding ratios for considered\ngalaxies and quasars have enough close quantities, testifying on the unified\nmodel of sources. We analyse obtained relations for two types of steep-spectrum\nsources (with linear steep spectrum (S) and low-frequency steepness after a\nbreak (C+)) from the UTR-2 catalogue.\n", "  The pyrochlore lattice involves corner sharing tetrahedra and the resulting\ngeometric frustration is believed to suppress any antiferromagnetic order for\nMott insulators on this structure. There are nevertheless short-range\ncorrelations which could be vital near the Mott-Hubbard insulator-metal\ntransition. We use a static auxiliary-field-based Monte Carlo to study this\nproblem in real space on reasonably large lattices. The method reduces to\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock at zero temperature but captures the key magnetic\nfluctuations at finite temperature. Our results reveal that increasing\ninteraction drives the non magnetic (semi) metal to a 'spin disordered' metal\nwith small local moments, at some critical coupling, and then, through a small\npseudogap window, to a large moment, gapped, Mott insulating phase at a larger\noupling. The spin disordered metal has a finite residual resistivity which\ngrows with interaction strength, diverging at the upper coupling. We present\nthe resistivity, optical conductivity, and density of states across the\nmetal-insulator transition and for varying temperature. These results set the\nstage for the more complex cases of Mott transition in the pyrochlore iridates\nand molybdates.\n", "  We have investigated Vickers hardness and the thermodynamic properties of the\nrecently discovered nanolaminate carbide Ti3SnC2 polymorphs using the\nfirst-principles calculations. The chemical bonding shows a combination of\ncovalent, ionic and metallic types. The strong covalent bonding is mainly\nresponsible for high Vickers hardness of Ti3SnC2 polymorphs. Thermodynamic\nproperties are studied using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The variation of\nbulk modulus, thermal expansion co-efficient, specific heats, and Debye\ntemperature with applied pressure (P) and temperature (T) are investigated\nsystematically within the ranges of 0 - 50 GPa and 0 - 1000 K. The calculated\nresults have been compared with available experimental and theoretical data.\n", "  We study Euclidean Romans supergravity in six dimensions with a non-trivial\nAbelian R-symmetry gauge field. We show that supersymmetric solutions are in\none-to-one correspondence with solutions to a set of differential constraints\non an SU(2) structure. As an application of our results we (i) show that this\nstructure reduces at a conformal boundary to the five-dimensional rigid\nsupersymmetric geometry previously studied by the authors, (ii) find a general\nexpression for the holographic dual of the VEV of a BPS Wilson loop, matching\nan exact field theory computation, (iii) construct holographic duals to\nsquashed Sasaki-Einstein backgrounds, again matching to a field theory\ncomputation, and (iv) find new analytic solutions.\n", "  Structural properties, impedance, dielectric and electric modulus spectra\nhave been used to investigate the sintering temperature (Ts) effect on the\nsingle phase cubic spinel Ni0.6Zn0.4Fe2O4 (NZFO) ceramics synthesized by\nstandard ceramic technique. Enhancement of dielectric constants is observed\nwith increasing Ts. The collective contribution of n-type and p-type carriers\nyields a clear peak in notable unusual dielectric behavior is successfully\nexplained by the Rezlescu model. The non-Debye type long range dielectric\nrelaxation phenomena is explained by electric modulus formalism. Fast response\nof the grain boundaries of the sample sintered at lower Ts sample leading to\nsmall dielectric spin relaxation time, t (several nanoseconds) have been\ndetermined using electric modulus spectra for the samples sintered at different\nTs. Two clear semicircles in impedance Cole-Cole plot have also been\nsuccessfully explained by employing two parallel RC equivalent circuits in\nseries configuration taking into account no electrode contribution. Such a long\nrelaxation time in NZFO ceramics could suitably be used in nanoscale spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  The deep, wide-area (~800-900 arcmin**2) near-infrared/WFC3/IR + Spitzer/IRAC\nobservations over the CANDELS fields have been a remarkable resource for\nconstraining the bright end of high redshift UV luminosity functions (LFs).\nHowever, the lack of HST 1.05-micron observations over the CANDELS fields has\nmade it difficult to identify z~9-10 sources robustly, since such data are\nneeded to confirm the presence of an abrupt Lyman break at 1.2 microns. We\nreport here on the successful identification of many such z~9-10 sources from a\nnew HST program (z9-CANDELS) that targets the highest-probability z~9-10 galaxy\ncandidates with observations at 1.05 microns, to search for a robust\nLyman-break at 1.2 microns. The potential z~9-10 candidates are preselected\nfrom the full HST, Spitzer/IRAC S-CANDELS observations, and the\ndeepest-available ground-based optical+near-infrared observations. We\nidentified 15 credible z~9-10 galaxies over the CANDELS fields. Nine of these\ngalaxies lie at z~9 and 5 are new identifications. Our targeted follow-up\nstrategy has proven to be very efficient in making use of scarce HST time to\nsecure a reliable sample of z~9-10 galaxies. Through extensive simulations, we\nreplicate the selection process for our sample (both the preselection and\nfollow-up) and use it to improve current estimates for the volume density of\nbright z~9 and z~10 galaxies. The volume densities we find are 5(-2)(+3)x and\n8(-3)(+9)x lower, respectively, than found at z~8. When compared with the\nbest-fit evolution (i.e., dlog_{10} rho(UV)/dz=-0.29+/-0.02) in the UV\nluminosities densities from z~8 to z~4 integrated to 0.3L*(z=3) (-20 mag),\nthese luminosity densities are 2.6(-0.9)(+1.5)x and 2.2(-1.1)(+2.0)x lower,\nrespectively, than the extrapolated trends. Our new results are broadly\nconsistent with the \"accelerated evolution\" scenario at z>8, as seen in many\ntheoretical models.\n", "  We study the effect of weak disorder on the delocalization properties of\ngapped graphene superlattice (SL) formed by periodically located rectangular\npotential barriers. We consider two types of the SLs: the SLs with uniform and\nnonuniform gap. Using the perturbative approach we obtain an analytical\nexpression for the inverse localization length (ILL) derived for the case of\nrandomly fluctuating geometric and energetic parameters. In the first case,\nwhen the barrier (well) width fluctuates around its mean value, the\ncorresponding equation for the ILL reveals the presence of the Fabry-Perot\nresonances, at which the localization length diverges. These resonances are\nexact, i.e., are stored in any degree of disorder. It has been found that the\nlocalization properties manifest stronger for the particles with energies lying\nin the non-resonant bands where our approach is extremely sensitive to the\ndegree of disorder. For the case of weakly fluctuating both barrier and well\nwidths we analytically obtain ILL taking correlations into account. The main\neffect of the correlations, which lead to an increase (or decrease) in the\nlocalization length, was revealed near the double resonance arising at\ncoincidence of two Fabry-Perot resonances associated with barrier and well\nwidths. The random fluctuations of the potential strength also lead to the\ndelocalization resonances. However, they exist only in a weak-disorder\napproximation. We found that, for an array composed of alternating strips of\ngapless and gapped graphene modifications these resonances can appear only for\nnormally incident particles in contrast to the SL with a uniform gap. For such\nparticles, the delocalization resonances occur also in the purely random\npotential. This means, in particular, that in the one-dimensional case, not all\nthe states of the massive Dirac particles are localized in the presence of weak\ndisorder.\n", "  We derive gradient and energy estimates for critical points of the full\nsupersymmetric sigma model and discuss several applications.\n", "  In our previous work, we studied the polar distribution of the scaled energy\nof bottom-flavored hadrons from polarized top quark decays\n$t(\\uparrow)\\rightarrow W^++b(\\rightarrow X_b)$, using two different helicity\ncoordinate systems. Basically, the energy distributions are governed by the\nunpolarized, polar and azimuthal rate functions which are related to the\ndensity matrix elements of the decay $t(\\uparrow)\\rightarrow W^++b$. Here we\npresent, for the first time, the analytical expressions for the ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s)$ radiative corrections to the differential azimuthal decay rates\nof the partonic process $t(\\uparrow)\\rightarrow b+W^+(+g)$ in two helicity\nsystems, which are needed to study the azimuthal distribution of the energy\nspectrum of the B-hadron produced in polarized top quark decays. Our\npredictions of the hadron energy distributions enable us to deepen our\nknowledge of the hadronization process and to determine the polarization states\nof top quarks.\n", "  Stellar activity may induce Doppler variability at the level of a few m/s\nwhich can then be confused by the Doppler signal of an exoplanet orbiting the\nstar. To first order, linear correlations between radial velocity measurements\nand activity indices have been proposed to account for any such correlation.\nThe likely presence of two super-Earths orbiting Kapteyn's star was reported in\nAnglada et al. (2014, MNRAS 443L, 89A), but this claim was recently challenged\nby Robertson et al. (2015, ApJ 805L, 22R) arguing evidence of a rotation period\n(143 days) at three times the orbital period of one of the proposed planets\n(Kapteyn's b, P=48.6 days), and the existence of strong linear correlations\nbetween its Doppler signal and activity data. By re-analyzing the data using\nglobal optimization methods and model comparison, we show that such claim is\nincorrect given that; 1) the choice of a rotation period at 143 days is\nunjustified, and 2) the presence of linear correlations is not supported by the\ndata. We conclude that the radial velocity signals of Kapteyn's star remain\nmore simply explained by the presence of two super-Earth candidates orbiting\nit. We also advocate for the use of global optimization procedures and\nobjective arguments, instead of claims lacking of a minimal statistical\nsupport.\n", "  The dependence of the unfolding pathway of proteins on the pulling speed is\ninvestigated. This is done by introducing a simple one-dimensional chain\ncomprising $N$ units, with different characteristic bistable free energies.\nThese units represent either each of the modules in a modular protein or each\nof the intermediate \"unfoldons\" in a protein domain, which can be either folded\nor unfolded. The system is pulled by applying a force to the last unit of the\nchain, and the units unravel following a preferred sequence. We show that the\nunfolding sequence strongly depends on the pulling velocity $v_{p}$. In the\nsimplest situation, there appears a critical pulling speed $v_{c}$: for pulling\nspeeds $v_{p}<v_{c}$, the weakest unit unfolds first, whereas for $v_{p}>v_{c}$\nit is the pulled unit that unfolds first. By means of a perturbative expansion,\nwe find quite an accurate expression for this critical velocity.\n", "  Under the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell spacetime of\nembedding class one we explore possibility of electromagnetic mass model where\nmass and other physical parameters have purely electromagnetic origin (Tiwari\n1984, Gautreau 1985, Gron 1985). This work is in continuation of our earlier\ninvestigation (Maurya 2015a) where we developed an algorithm and found out\nthree new solutions of electromagnetic mass models. In the present letter we\nconsider different metric potentials $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$ and analyzed them in a\nsystematic way. It is observed that some of the previous solutions related to\nelectromagnetic mass models are nothing but special cases of the presently\nobtained generalized solution set. We further verify the solution set and show\nthat these are extremely applicable in the case of compact stars as well as for\nunderstanding structure of the electron.\n", "  We compute the structure factor of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model in an external\nfield on the square lattice within the Cluster Variation Method. We use a four\npoint plaquette approximation, which is the minimal one able to capture phases\nwith broken orientational order in real space, like the recently reported\nIsing-nematic phase in the model. The analysis of different local maxima in the\nstructure factor allows us to track the different phases and phase transitions\nagainst temperature and external field. Although the nematic susceptibility is\nnot directly related to the structure factor, we show that because of the close\nrelationship between the nematic order parameter and the structure factor, the\nlatter shows unambiguous signatures of the presence of a nematic phase, in\nagreement with results from direct minimization of a variational free energy.\nThe disorder variety of the model is identified and the possibility that the\nCVM four point approximation be exact on the disorder variety is discussed.\n", "  We study a system of N D2-branes probing a generic Calabi-Yau three-fold\nsingularity in the presence of a non-zero quantized Romans mass n. We argue\nthat the low-energy effective N = 2 Chern-Simons quiver gauge theory flows to a\nsuperconformal fixed point in the IR, and construct the dual AdS_4 solution in\nmassive IIA supergravity. We compute the free energy F of the gauge theory on\nS^3 using localization. In the large N limit we find F = c(nN)^{1/3}a^{2/3},\nwhere c is a universal constant and a is the a-function of the \"parent\"\nfour-dimensional N = 1 theory on N D3-branes probing the same Calabi-Yau\nsingularity. It follows that maximizing F over the space of admissible\nR-symmetries is equivalent to maximizing a for this class of theories.\nMoreover, we show that the gauge theory result precisely matches the\nholographic free energy of the supergravity solution, and provide a similar\nmatching of the VEV of a BPS Wilson loop operator.\n", "  By invoking inverse temperature as a van Kampen-Isreal future-directed\ntimelike 4-vector, this paper derives the Relativistic Blackbody Spectrum, the\nRelativistic Wien's Displacement Law, and the Relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann Law\nin inertial and non-inertial reference frames.\n", "  An exact solution of two singularities in the teleparallel equivalent to\ngeneral relativity theory has been obtained. A holographic visualization of the\nbinary black holes (BBHs) space-time, due to the non vanishing torsion scalar\nfield, has been given. The acceleration tensor of BBHs space-time has been\ncalculated. The results identify the repulsive gravity zones of the BBHs field.\nThe total conserved quantities of the BBHs has been evaluated. Possible\ngravitational radiation emission by the system has been calculated without\nassuming a weak field initial data.\n", "  Ultra-high energy neutrinos are interesting messenger particles since, if\ndetected, they can transmit exclusive information about ultra-high energy\nprocesses in the Universe. These particles, with energies above\n$10^{16}\\mathrm{eV}$, interact very rarely. Therefore, detectors that\ninstrument several gigatons of matter are needed to discover them. The ARA\ndetector is currently being constructed at South Pole. It is designed to use\nthe Askaryan effect, the emission of radio waves from neutrino-induced cascades\nin the South Pole ice, to detect neutrino interactions at very high energies.\nWith antennas distributed among 37 widely-separated stations in the ice, such\ninteractions can be observed in a volume of several hundred cubic kilometers.\nCurrently 3 deep ARA stations are deployed in the ice of which two have been\ntaking data since the beginning of the year 2013. In this publication, the ARA\ndetector \"as-built\" and calibrations are described. Furthermore, the data\nreduction methods used to distinguish the rare radio signals from overwhelming\nbackgrounds of thermal and anthropogenic origin are presented. Using data from\nonly two stations over a short exposure time of 10 months, a neutrino flux\nlimit of $3 \\cdot 10^{-6} \\mathrm{GeV} / (\\mathrm{cm^2 \\ s \\ sr})$ is\ncalculated for a particle energy of 10^{18}eV, which offers promise for the\nfull ARA detector.\n", "  We describe the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from compact-object\nbinary coalescences in advanced gravitational-wave detector data. The search\nwas used in the first Advanced LIGO observing run and unambiguously identified\ntwo black hole binary mergers, GW150914 and GW151226. At its core, the PyCBC\nsearch performs a matched-filter search for binary merger signals using a bank\nof gravitational-wave template waveforms. We provide a complete description of\nthe search pipeline including the steps used to mitigate the effects of noise\ntransients in the data, identify candidate events and measure their statistical\nsignificance. The analysis is able to measure false-alarm rates as low as one\nper million years, required for confident detection of signals. Using data from\ninitial LIGO's sixth science run, we show that the new analysis reduces the\nbackground noise in the search, giving a 30% increase in sensitive volume for\nbinary neutron star systems over previous searches.\n", "  We report theoretical and experimental evidence of chaotic pulses with\nexcitable-like properties in an opto-radiofrequency oscillator based on a\nself-injected dual-frequency laser. The chaotic attractor involved in the\ndynamics produces pulses that, albeit chaotic, are quite regular: They all have\nsimilar amplitudes, and are almost periodic in time. Thanks to these features,\nthe system displays properties that are similar to those of excitable systems.\nIn particular, the pulses exhibit a threshold-like response, of well-defined\namplitude, to perturbations, and it appears possible to define a refractory\ntime. At variance with excitability in injected lasers, here the excitable-like\npulses are not accompanied by phase slips.\n", "  We study dynamic features of a plasma consisting of gluons whose infrared\ndynamics is improved by the Gribov-Zwanziger quantization. This approach\nembodies essential features of color confinement which set the plasma apart\nfrom conventional quasiparticle systems in several aspects. Our study focusses\non a boost-invariant expansion for in- and out-of-equilibrium settings, which\nat late times can be characterized by the sound velocity, $c_s$, and the shear,\n$\\eta$, and bulk, $\\zeta$, viscosities. We obtain explicit expressions for the\ntransport coefficients $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ and check that they are consistent\nwith the numerical solutions of the kinetic equation. At high temperature,\nkeeping both the Gribov parameter and the relaxation time constant, we find a\nscaling $\\zeta/\\eta \\propto 1/3 - c_s^2$ which manifests strong breaking of\nconformal symmetry in contrast to the case of weakly coupled plasmas.\n", "  In this paper we develop a method capable of modeling the space-time focusing\nof nondiffracting pulses. The new pulses can possess arbitrary peak velocities\nand, in addition to being resistant to diffraction, can have their peak\nintensities and focusing positions chosen a priori. More specifically, we can\nchoose multiple locations (spatial ranges) of space/time focalization; also,\nthe pulse intensities can be chosen in advance. The pulsed wave solutions\npresented here can have very interesting applications in many different fields,\nsuch as free-space optical communications, remote sensing, medical apparatus,\netc.\n", "  We report a new attractive critical point occurring in the Anderson\nlocalization scaling flow of symplectic models on fractals. The scaling theory\nof Anderson localization predicts that in disordered symplectic two-dimensional\nsystems weak antilocalization effects lead to a metal-insulator transition.\nThis transition is characterized by a repulsive critical point above which the\nsystem becomes metallic. Fractals possess a non-integer scaling of conductance\nin the classical limit which can be continuously tuned by changing the fractal\nstructure. We demonstrate that in disordered symplectic Hamiltonians defined on\nfractals with classical conductance scaling $g \\sim L^{-\\varepsilon}$, for $0 <\n\\varepsilon < \\beta_\\mathrm{max} \\approx 0.15$, the metallic phase is replaced\nby a critical phase with a scale invariant conductance dependent on the fractal\ndimensionality. Our results show that disordered fractals allow an explicit\nconstruction and verification of the $\\varepsilon$ expansion.\n", "  In a recent work, a particular class of $f(T)$ gravity, where $T$ is the\nteleparallel torsion scalar, has been derived. This class has been identified\nby flat-like universe (FLU) assumptions \\cite{HN15}. The model is consistent\nwith the early cosmic inflation epoch. A quintessence potential has been\nconstructed from the FLU $f(T)$-gravity. We show that the first order potential\nof the induced quintessence is a quasi inverse power law inflation with an\nadditional constant providing an end of the inflation with no need to an extra\nmechanism. At $e$-folds $N_{*}= 55$ before the end of the inflation, this type\nof potential can perform both $E$ and $B$ modes of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization pattern.\n", "  We demonstrate that diffusiophoretic, thermophoretic and chemotactic\nphenomena in turbulence lead to clustering of particles on multi-fractal sets\nthat can be described using one single framework, valid when the particle size\nis much smaller than the smallest length scale of turbulence $l_0$. To quantify\nthe clustering, we derive positive pair correlations and fractal dimensions\nthat hold for scales smaller than $l_0$. Statistics of the number of particles\nin a small volume are non-Poissonian manifesting deviations from the case of\nuncorrelated particles. For scales larger than $l_0$ we predict a stretched\nexponential decay to 1 of the pair correlation function. For the case of\ninhomogeneous turbulence we find that the fractal dimension depends on the\ninhomogeneous direction. By performing experiments of clustering of\ndiffusiophoretic particles induced by salinity gradients in a turbulent gravity\ncurrent we demonstrate clustering in conformity to the theory. The particle\nsize in the experiment is comparable to $l_0$, outside the strict validity\nregion of the theory, suggesting that the theoretical predictions transfer to\nthis practically relevant regime. This clustering mechanism can provide the key\nto the understanding of a multitude of processes such as formation of marine\nsnow in the ocean and population dynamics of chemotactic bacteria.\n", "  We present a resummed mean-field approximation for inferring the parameters\nof an Ising or a Potts model from empirical, noisy, one- and two-point\ncorrelation functions. Based on a resummation of a class of diagrams of the\nsmall correlation expansion of the log-likelihood, the method outperforms\nstandard mean-field inference methods, even when they are regularized. The\ninference is stable with respect to sampling noise, contrarily to previous\nworks based either on the small correlation expansion, on the Bethe free\nenergy, or on the mean-field and Gaussian models. Because it is mostly\nanalytic, its complexity is still very low, requiring an iterative algorithm to\nsolve for $N$ auxiliary variables, that resorts only to matrix inversions and\nmultiplications. We test our algorithm on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model\nsubmitted to a random external field and large random couplings, and\ndemonstrate that even without regularization, the inference is stable across\nthe whole phase diagram. In addition, the calculation leads to a consistent\nestimation of the entropy of the data and allows us to sample form the inferred\ndistribution to obtain artificial data that are consistent with the empirical\ndistribution.\n", "  The newly developed \"strongly constrained and appropriately normed\" (SCAN)\nmeta-generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) can generally improve over\nthe non-empirical Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA not only for strong chemical\nbonding, but also for the intermediate-range van der Waals (vdW) interaction.\nHowever, the long-range vdW interaction is still missing. To remedy this, we\npropose here pairing SCAN with the non-local correlation part from the rVV10\nvdW density functional, with only two empirical parameters. The resulting\nSCAN+rVV10 yields excellent geometric and energetic results not only for\nmolecular systems, but also for solids and layered-structure materials, as well\nas the adsorption of benzene on coinage metal surfaces. Especially, SCAN+rVV10\noutperforms all current methods with comparable computational efficiencies,\naccurately reproducing the three most fundamental parameters---the inter-layer\nbinding energies, inter-, and intra-layer lattice constants---for 28\nlayered-structure materials. Hence, we have achieved with SCAN+rVV10 a\npromising vdW density functional for general geometries, with minimal\nempiricism.\n", "  A new technique is explored for the Monte Carlo sampling of complex-valued\ndistributions. The method is based on a heat bath approach where the\nconditional probability is replaced by a positive representation of it on the\ncomplex plane. Efficient ways to construct such representations are also\nintroduced. The performance of the algorithm is tested on small and large\nlattices with a $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory with quadratic nearest-neighbor complex\ncoupling. The method works for moderate complex couplings, reproducing\nreweighting and complex Langevin results and fulfilling various Schwinger-Dyson\nrelations.\n", "  Ternary (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 films with an Sb content between 0 and 100% were\ndeposited on a Si(111) substrate by means of molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray\ndiffraction measurements confirm single crystal growth in all cases. The Sb\ncontent is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Consistent values of\nthe Sb content are obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Scanning Raman\nspectroscopy reveals that the (Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 layers with an intermediate Sb\ncontent show spatial composition inhomogeneities. The observed spectra\nbroadening in angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is also\nattributed to this phenomena. Upon increasing the Sb content from x=0 to 1 the\nARPES measurements show a shift of the Fermi level from the conduction band to\nthe valence band. This shift is also confirmed by corresponding\nmagnetotransport measurements where the conductance changes from n- to p-type.\nIn this transition region, an increase of the resistivity is found, indicating\na location of the Fermi level within the band gap region. More detailed\nmeasurements in the transition region reveals that the transport takes place in\ntwo independent channels. By means of a gate electrode the transport can be\nchanged from n- to p-type, thus allowing a tuning of the Fermi level within the\ntopologically protected surface states.\n", "  In the study of surface waves in the presence of a shear current, a useful\nand much studied model is that in which the shear flow has constant vorticity.\nRecently it was shown by Constantin [Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids 30 (2011) 12-16]\nthat a flow of constant vorticity can only permit waves travelling exactly\nupstream or downstream, but not at oblique angles to the current, and several\nproofs to the same effect have appeared thereafter. Physical waves cannot\npossibly adhere to such a restriction, however. We resolve the paradox by\nshowing that an oblique plane wave propagating atop a current of constant\nvorticity according to the linearized Euler equation carries with it an\nundulating perturbation of the vorticity field, hence is not prohibited by the\nConstantin theorem since vorticity is not constant. The perturbation of the\nvorticity field is readily interpreted in a Lagrangian perspective as the wave\nmotion gently shifting and twisting the vortex lines as the wave passes. In the\nspecial case of upstream or downstream propagation, the wave advection of\nvortex lines does not affect the Eulerian vorticity field, in accordance with\nthe theorem. We conclude that the study of oblique waves on shear currents\nrequires a formalism allowing undulating perturbations of the vorticity field,\nand the constant vorticity model is helpful only in certain 2D systems.\n", "  We propose two different setups to generate single photons on demand using an\natom in front of a mirror, along with either a beam-splitter or a tunable\ncoupling. We show that photon generation efficiency ~99% is straightforward to\nachieve. The proposed schemes are simple and easily tunable in frequency. The\noperation is relatively insensitive to dephasing and can be easily extended to\ngenerate correlated pairs of photons. They can also in principle be used to\ngenerate any photonic qubit of the form $\\mu |0 \\rangle + \\nu |1\\rangle$ in\narbitrary wave-packets, making them very attractive for quantum communication\napplications.\n", "  The proper spin-foam vertex amplitude is obtained from the EPRL vertex by\nprojecting out all but a single gravitational sector, in order to achieve\ncorrect semi-classical behavior. In this paper we calculate the gravitational\ntwo-point function predicted by the proper spin-foam vertex to lowest order in\nthe vertex expansion. We find the same answer as in the EPRL case in the\n`continuum spectrum' limit, so that the theory is consistent with the\npredictions of linearized gravity in the regime of small curvature. The method\nfor calculating the two-point function is similar to that used in prior works:\nwe cast it in terms of an action integral and to use stationary phase methods.\nThus, the calculation of the Hessian matrix plays a key role. Once the Hessian\nis calculated, it is used not only to calculate the two-point function, but\nalso to calculate the coefficient appearing in the semi-classical limit of the\nproper vertex amplitude itself. This coefficient is the effective discrete\n\"measure factor\" encoded in the spin-foam model. Through a non-trivial\ncancellation of different factors, we find that this coefficient is the same as\nthe coefficient in front of the term in the asymptotics of the EPRL vertex\ncorresponding to the selected gravitational sector.\n", "  We demonstrate that optical transmission matrices (TM) of disordered complex\nmedia provide a powerful tool to extract the photonic interaction strength,\nindependent of surface effects. We measure TM of strongly scattering GaP\nnanowires and plot the singular value density of the measured matrices and a\nrandom matrix model. By varying the free parameters of the model, the transport\nmean free path and effective refractive index, we retrieve the photonic\ninteraction strength. From numerical simulations we conclude that TM statistics\nis hardly sensitive to surface effects, in contrast to enhanced backscattering\nor total transmission based methods.\n", "  Although the universe at redshifts greater than six represents only the first\none billion years (<10%) of cosmic time, the dense nature of the early universe\nled to vigorous galaxy formation and evolution activity which we are only now\nstarting to piece together. Technological improvements have, over only the past\ndecade, allowed large samples of galaxies at such high redshifts to be\ncollected, providing a glimpse into the epoch of formation of the first stars\nand galaxies. A wide variety of observational techniques have led to the\ndiscovery of thousands of galaxy candidates at z > 6, with spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxies out to nearly z = 9. Using these large samples, we have\nbegun to gain a physical insight into the processes inherent in galaxy\nevolution at early times. In this review, I will discuss i) the selection\ntechniques for finding distant galaxies, including a summary of previous and\nongoing ground and space-based searches, and spectroscopic followup efforts,\nii) insights into galaxy evolution gleaned from measures such as the rest-frame\nultraviolet luminosity function, the stellar mass function, and galaxy\nstar-formation rates, and iii) the effect of galaxies on their surrounding\nenvironment, including the chemical enrichment of the universe, and the\nreionization of the intergalactic medium. Finally, I conclude with prospects\nfor future observational study of the distant universe, using a bevy of new\nstate-of-the-art facilities coming online over the next decade and beyond.\n", "  Chemodynamical models of our Galaxy that have analytic Extended Distribution\nFunctions (EDFs) are likely to play a key role in extracting science from\nsurveys in the era of Gaia.\n", "  The emerging field of spinoptronics has a potential to supersede the\nfunctionality of modern electronics, while a proper description of strong\nlight-matter coupling pose the most intriguing questions from both fundamental\nscientific and technological perspectives. In this paper we address a highly\nrelevant issue for such a development. We theoretically explore spin dynamics\non the surface of a 3D topological insulator (TI) irradiated with an\noff-resonant high-frequency electromagnetic wave. The strong coupling between\nelectrons and the electromagnetic wave drastically modifies the spin properties\nof TI. The effects of irradiation are shown to result in anisotropy of electron\nenergy spectrum near the Dirac point and suppression of spin current and are\ninvestigated in detail in this work.\n", "  The isovector axial vector form factors of $N \\rightarrow \\Delta$ transition\nare calculated by employing Light-cone QCD sum rules. The analytical results\nare analysed by both the conventional method, and also by a Monte Carlo based\napproach which allows one to scan all of the parameter space. The predictions\nare also compared with the results in the literature, where available. Although\nthe Monte Carlo analysis predicts large uncertainties in the predicted results,\nthe predictions obtained by the conventional analysis are in good agreement\nwith other results in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the long-time asymptotics for the focusing integrable discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. Under generic assumptions on the initial\nvalue, the solution is asymptotically a sum of 1-solitons. We find different\nphase shift formulas in different regions. Along rays away from solitons, the\nbehavior of the solution is decaying oscillation. This is one way of stating\nthe soliton resolution conjecture. The proof is based on the nonlinear steepest\ndescent method.\n", "  We present new sets of proton fragmentation functions describing the\nproduction of protons from the gluon and each of the quarks, obtained by a\nglobal fit to all relevant data sets extracted from the single-inclusive\nelectron-positron annihilation. Our analysis is in good agreement with $e^+e^-$\nannihilation data. We also impose the finite-mass effects of proton in our\ncalculations, a topic with a very little attention paid to in the literatures.\nProton mass effects turn out to be appreciable for the gluon and light quark\nfragmentation functions, so the inclusion of finite-mass effects tends to\nimprove the overall description of the data by reducing the minimized $\\chi^2$\nvalues, significantly. As an application, we also apply the extracted\nfragmentation functions to make our predictions for the scaled-energy\ndistribution of protons inclusively produced in top quark decays at\nnext-to-leading order, relying on the universality and scaling violations of\nfragmentation functions.\n", "  We show that in N-body simulations of isolated spiral discs, spiral arms\nappear to transient, recurring features that co-rotate with the stellar disc\nstars at all radii. As a consequence, stars around the spiral arm continually\nfeel a tangential force from the spiral and gain/lose angular momentum at all\nradii where spiral structure exists, without gaining significant amounts of\nrandom energy. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous radial migration in these\nsimulations can be seen as outward (inward) systematic streaming motions along\nthe trailing (leading) side of the spiral arms. We characterise these spiral\ninduced peculiar motions and compare with those of the Milky Way obtained from\nAPOGEE red clump data. We find that transient, co-rotating spiral arms are\nconsistent with the data, in contrast with density wave-like spirals which are\nqualitatively inconsistent. In addition, we show that, in our simulations,\nradial migration does not change the radial metallicity gradient significantly,\nand broadens the metallicity distribution function at all radii.\n", "  Asteroseismology can make a substantial contribution to our understanding of\nthe formation history and evolution of our Galaxy by providing precisely\ndetermined stellar properties for thousands of stars in different regions of\nthe Milky Way. We present here the different sets of observables used in\ndetermining asteroseismic stellar properties, the typical level of precision\nobtained, the current status of results for ages of dwarfs and giants and the\nimprovements than can be expected in the near future in the context of Galactic\narchaeology.\n", "  We study the supersymmetric Casimir energy $E_\\mathrm{susy}$ of\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ field theories with an R-symmetry, defined on rigid\nsupersymmetric backgrounds $S^1\\times M_3$, using a Hamiltonian formalism.\nThese backgrounds admit an ambi-Hermitian geometry, and we show that the net\ncontributions to $E_\\mathrm{susy}$ arise from certain twisted holomorphic modes\non $\\mathbb{R}\\times M_3$, with respect to both complex structures. The\nsupersymmetric Casimir energy may then be identified as a limit of an\nindex-character that counts these modes. In particular this explains a recent\nobservation relating $E_\\mathrm{susy}$ on $S^1\\times S^3$ to the anomaly\npolynomial. As further applications we compute $E_\\mathrm{susy}$ for certain\nsecondary Hopf surfaces, and discuss how the index-character may also be used\nto compute generalized supersymmetric indices.\n", "  Reentrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) states are believed to be correlated\nelectron solid phases, though their microscopic description remains unclear. As\nbias current increases, longitudinal and Hall resistivities measured for these\nstates exhibit multiple sharp breakdown transitions, a signature unique to RIQH\nstates. We present spatially-resolved measurements of RIQH breakdown that\nindicate these breakdown signatures can be ascribed to a phase boundary between\nbroken-down and unbroken regions, spreading chirally from source and drain\ncontacts as a function of bias current and passing voltage probes one by one.\nThe chiral sense of the spreading is not set by the chirality of the edge state\nitself, instead depending on electron- or hole-like character of the RIQH\nstate.\n", "  Stellar models provide a vital basis for many aspects of astronomy and\nastrophysics. Recent advances in observational astronomy -- through\nasteroseismology, precision photometry, high-resolution spectroscopy, and\nlarge-scale surveys -- are placing stellar models under greater quantitative\nscrutiny than ever. The model limitations are being exposed and the next\ngeneration of stellar models is needed as soon as possible. The current\nuncertainties in the models propagate to the later phases of stellar evolution,\nhindering our understanding of stellar populations and chemical evolution. Here\nwe give a brief overview of the evolution, importance, and substantial\nuncertainties of core helium burning stars in particular and then briefly\ndiscuss a range of methods, both theoretical and observational, that we are\nusing to advance the modelling.\n", "  Our detailed analytic local disc model (JJ-model) quantifies the\ninterrelation between kinematic properties (e.g. velocity dispersions and\nasymmetric drift), spatial parameters (scale-lengths and vertical density\nprofiles), and properties of stellar sub-populations (age and abundance\ndistributions). Any consistent radial extension of the disc evolution model\nshould predict specific features in the different distribution functions and in\ntheir correlations. Large spectroscopic surveys (SEGUE, RAVE, APOGEE, Gaia-ESO)\nallow significant constraints on the long-term evolution of the thin disc. We\ndiscuss the qualitative difference of correlations (like the alpha-enhancement\nas function of metallicity) and distribution functions (e.g. in [Mg/H] or\n[Fe/H]) for the construction of a disc model. In the framework of the JJ-model\nwe build a local chemical enrichment model and show that significant vertical\ngradients for main sequence and red clump stars are expected in the thin disc.\nA Jeans analysis of the asymmetric drift provides a link to the radial\nstructure of the disc. The derived metallicity-dependent radial scale-lengths\ncan be combined in the future with the abundance distributions at different\nGalactocentric distances to construct full disc models. We expect to be able to\nconstrain possible scenarios of inside-out growth of the thin disc and to\ncharacterise those populations, which require significant radial migration.\n", "  The Gaia benchmark stars are stars with very precise stellar parameters that\ncover a wide range in the HR diagram at various metallicities. They are meant\nto be good representative of typical FGK stars in the Milky Way. Currently,\nthey are used by several spectroscopic surveys to validate and calibrate the\nmethods that analyse the data. I review our recent activities done for these\nstars. Additionally, by applying our new method to find stellar twins on the\nGaia-ESO Survey, I discuss how good representatives of Milky Way stars the\nbenchmark stars are and how they distribute in space.\n", "  The origin of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars and their possible\nconnections with the chemical elements produced by the first stellar\ngenerations is still highly debated. We briefly review observations of CEMP\nstars in different environments (Galactic stellar halo, ultra-faint and\nclassical dwarf galaxies) and interpret their properties using cosmological\nchemical-evolution models for the formation of the Local Group. We discuss the\nimplications of current observations for the properties of the first stars,\nclarify why the fraction of carbon-enhanced to carbon-normal stars varies in\ndwarf galaxies with different luminosity, and discuss the origin of the first\nCEMP(-no) star found in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy.\n", "  Transition metal oxides with 4d or 5d metals are of great interest due to the\ncompeting interactions, of the Coulomb repulsion and the itineracy of the\nd-electrons, opening a possibility of building new quantum ground states.\nParticularly the 5d metal oxides containing Iridium have received significant\nattention within the last years, due to their unexpected physical properties,\ncaused by a strong spin orbit coupling observed in Ir(IV). A prominent example\nis the Mott-insulator Sr2IrO4. Another member of this family, the honeycomb\nlattice compound Na2IrO3, also being a Mott-insulator having, most probably, a\nKitaev spin liquid ground state. By deintercalating sodium from Na2IrO3, we\nwere able to synthesize a new honeycomb lattice compound with more than 50%\nreduced sodium content. The reduction of the sodium content in this layered\ncompound leads to a change of the oxidation state of iridium from +IV to +V/+VI\nand a symmetry change from C2/c to P-3. This goes along with significant\nchanges of the physical properties. Besides the vanishing magnetic ordering at\n15K, also the transport properties changes and instead insulating\nsemiconducting properties are observed.\n", "  An alternative method of developing the theory of non-equilibrium two\ndimensional holographic superconductor is to start from the definition of a\ntime dependent $AdS_3$ background. As originally proposed, many of these\nformulae were cast in exponential form, but the adoption of the numeric method\nof expression throughout the bulk serves to show more clearly the relationship\nbetween the various parameters. The time dependence behaviour of the scalar\ncondensation and Maxwell fields are fitted numerically. A usual value for\nMaxwell field on AdS horizon is $\\exp(-bt)$, and the exponential $\\log$ ratio\nis therefore $10^{-8} s^{-1}$. The coefficient $b$ of the time in the\nexponential term $\\exp(-bt)$ can be interpreted as a tool to measure the degree\nof dynamical instability, its reciprocal $\\frac{1}{b}$ is the time in which the\ndisturbance is multiplied in the ratio. A discussion of some of the exponential\nformulae is given by the scalar field $\\psi(z,t)$ near the AdS boundary. It\nmight be possible that a long interval would elapse the system which tends to\nthe equilibrium state when the normal mass and conformal dimensions emerged. A\nsomewhat curious calculation has been made, to illustrate the holographic\nentanglement entropy for this system. The foundation of all this calculation\nis, of course, a knowledge of multiple (connected and disconnected) extremal\nsurfaces. There are several cases in which exact and approximate solutions are\njointly used, a variable numerical quantity is represented by a graph, and the\nprinciples of approximation are then applied to determine related numerical\nquantities. In the case of the disconnected phase with a finite extremal are,\nwe find a discontinuity in the first derivative of the entanglement entropy as\nthe conserved charge $J$ is increased.\n", "  Let $\\Omega\\subset \\mathbb R^d\\,, d\\geq 2$, be a bounded open set, and denote\nby $\\lambda\\_j(\\Omega), j\\geq 1$, the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian\narranged in nondecreasing order, with multiplicities. The weak form of\nPleijel's theorem states that the number of eigenvalues $\\lambda\\_j(\\Omega)$,\nfor which there exists an associated eigenfunction with precisely $j$ nodal\ndomains (Courant-sharp eigenvalues), is finite. The purpose of this note is to\ndetermine an upper bound for Courant-sharp eigenvalues, expressed in terms of\nsimple geometric invariants of $\\Omega$. We will see that this is connected\nwith one of the favorite problems considered by Y. Safarov.\n", "  In a recent experiment by Wu {\\textit et al.} (arXiv:1511.08170), a\nRaman-assisted two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling has been realized for a\nBose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice potential. In light of this\nexciting progress, we study in detail key properties of the system. As the\nRaman lasers inevitably couple atoms to high-lying bands, the behaviors of the\nsystem in both the single- and many-particle sectors are significantly\naffected. In particular, the high-band effects enhance the plane-wave phase and\nlead to the emergence of \"roton\" gaps at low Zeeman fields. Furthermore, we\nidentify high-band-induced topological phase boundaries in both the\nsingle-particle and the quasi-particle spectra. We then derive an effective\ntwo-band model, which captures the high-band physics in the experimentally\nrelevant regime. Our results not only offer valuable insights into the novel\ntwo-dimensional lattice spin-orbit coupling, but also provide a systematic\nformalism to model high-band effects in lattice systems with Raman-assisted\nspin-orbit couplings.\n", "  Independent of stellar modelling, global seismic parameters of red giants\nprovide unique information on the individual stellar properties as well as on\nstellar evolution. They allow us to measure key stellar parameters, such as the\nstellar mass and radius, or to derive the distance of field stars. Furthermore,\noscillations with a mixed character directly probe the physical conditions in\nthe stellar core. Here, we explain how very precise seismic indices are\nobtained, and how they can be used for monitoring stellar evolution and\nperforming Galactic archeology.\n", "  Recently there has been a huge interest in the diphoton excess around 750 GeV\nreported by both ATLAS and CMS collaborations, although the newest analysis\nwith more statistics does not seem to support the excess. Nevertheless, the\ndiphoton channel at the LHC experiments are a powerful tool to probe a new\nphysics. One of the most natural explanations of a diphoton excess, if it\noccurs, could be a new scalar boson with exotic colored particles. In this\nsetup, it would be legitimate to ask what is the role of this new scalar in\nnature. A heavy neutral gauge boson ($Z'$) is one of the traditional targets of\nthe discovery at the collider experiments with numerous motivations. While the\nLandau-Yang theorem dictates the diphoton excess cannot be this spin-1 gauge\nboson, there is a strong correlation of a new heavy gauge boson and a new\nscalar boson which provides a mass to the gauge boson being at the same mass\nscale. In this paper, we point out a simple fact that a new scalar with a\nproperty similar to the recently highlighted 750 GeV would suggest an existence\nof a TeV scale $Z'$ gauge boson that might be within the reach of the LHC Run 2\nexperiments. We take a scenario of the well-motivated and popular gauged $B-L$\nsymmetry and require the gauge coupling unification to predict the mass and\nother properties of the $Z'$ and illustrate the discovery of the $Z'$ would\noccur during the LHC experiments.\n", "  In the last decade, efforts have been made to reconcile theoretical security\nwith realistic imperfect implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD).\nImplementable countermeasures are proposed to patch the discovered loopholes.\nHowever, certain countermeasures are not as robust as would be expected. In\nthis paper, we present a concrete example of ID Quantique's\nrandom-detector-efficiency countermeasure against detector blinding attacks. As\na third-party tester, we have found that the first industrial implementation of\nthis countermeasure is effective against the original blinding attack, but not\nimmune to a modified blinding attack. Then, we implement and test a later full\nversion of this countermeasure containing a security proof [C. C. W. Lim et\nal., IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, 21, 6601305\n(2015)]. We find that it is still vulnerable against the modified blinding\nattack, because an assumption about hardware characteristics on which the proof\nrelies fails in practice.\n", "  The main goal of Galactic Archaeology is understanding the formation and\nevolution of the basic Galactic components. This requires sophisticated\nchemo-dynamical modeling, where disc asymmetries (e.g., perturbations from the\ncentral bar, spirals arms, and infalling satellites) and non-equilibrium\nprocesses are taken into account self-consistently. Here we discuss the current\nstatus of Galactic chemo-dynamical modeling and focus on a recent hybrid\ntechnique, which helps circumvent traditional problems with chemical enrichment\nand star formation encountered in fully self-consistent cosmological\nsimulations. We show that this model can account for a number of\nchemo-kinematic relations in the Milky Way. In addition, we demonstrate that\n(1) our model matches well the observed age-[alpha/Fe] and age-[Fe/H] relations\nand (2) that the scatter in the age-[Fe/H] relation cannot be simply explained\nby blurring (stars on apo- and pericenters visiting the solar vicinity) but\nsignificant radial migration (stars born elsewhere but ending up at the solar\nvicinity today because of a change in guiding radius) is needed. We emphasize\nthe importance of accurate stellar ages, such as those obtained through\nasteroseismology by the CoRoT and Kepler missions, for breaking the degeneracy\namong different Galactic evolution scenarios.\n", "  The accuracy of stellar masses and radii determined from asteroseismology is\nnot known! We examine this issue for giant stars by comparing classical\nmeasurements of detached eclipsing binary systems (dEBs) with asteroseismic\nmeasurements from the Kepler mission. For star clusters, we extrapolate\nmeasurements of dEBs in the turn-off region to the red giant branch and the red\nclump where we investigate the giants as an ensemble. For the field stars, we\nmeasure dEBs with an oscillating giant component. These measurements allow a\ncomparison of masses and radii calculated from a classical eclipsing binary\nanalysis to those calculated from asteroseismic scaling relations and/or other\nasteroseismic methods. Our first results indicate small but significant\nsystematic differences between the classical and asteroseismic measurements. In\nthis contribution we show our latest results and summarize the current status\nand future plans. We also stress the importance of realizing that for giant\nstars mass cannot always be translated to age, since an unknown fraction of\nthese evolved through a blue straggler phase with mass transfer in a binary\nsystem. Rough estimates of how many such stars to expect are given based on our\nfindings in the open clusters NGC6819 and NGC6791.\n", "  A recently introduced model describing -on a 1d lattice- the velocity field\nof a granular fluid is discussed in detail. The dynamics of the velocity field\noccurs through next-neighbours inelastic collisions which conserve momentum but\ndissipate energy. The dynamics can be described by a stochastic equation in\nfull phase space, or through the corresponding Master Equation for the time\nevolution of the probability distribution. In the hydrodynamic limit, equations\nfor the average velocity and temperature fields with fluctuating currents are\nderived, which are analogous to those of granular fluids when restricted to the\nshear modes. Therefore, the homogeneous cooling state, with its linear\ninstability, and other relevant regimes such as the uniform shear flow and the\nCouette flow states are described. The evolution in time and space of the\nsingle particle probability distribution, in all those regimes, is also\ndiscussed, showing that the local equilibrium is not valid in general. The\nnoise for the momentum and energy currents, which are correlated, are white and\nGaussian. The same is true for the noise of the energy sink, which is usually\nnegligible.\n", "  The black hole mass measurement in active galaxies is a challenge,\nparticularly in sources where the reverberation method cannot be applied. We\naim to determine the black hole mass in a very special object, RE J1034+396,\none of the two AGN with QPO oscillations detected in X-rays, and a single\nbright AGN with optical band totally dominated by starlight. We fit the stellar\ncontent using the code starlight, and the broad band disk contribution to\noptical/UV/X-ray emission is modeled with optxagnf. We also determine the black\nhole mass using several other independent methods. Various methods give\ncontradictory results. Most measurements of the blacc hole mass are in the\nrange 1.e6-1.e7 Msun, and the measurements based on dynamics give higher values\nthan measurements based on Hbeta and Mg II emission lines.\n", "  Multi-object spectrographs have opened a new window on the analyses of the\nchemo-dynamical properties of old Milky Way stars. These analyses allow us to\ntrace back the internal mechanisms and the external factors that have\ninfluenced the evolution of our Galaxy, and therefore understand fundamental\naspects of galaxy evolution in general. Here, we present recent results from\nthe RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and the Gaia-ESO survey. These surveys\nexplore the Milky Way properties in different ways, in terms of sample size and\nselection, magnitude range, and spectral resolution. We focus here on (i) the\nfirst direct detection of evidence for radial migration within the thin disc,\nproviding insight into the history of spiral structure of the Milky Way, and\n(ii) the chemo-dynamical characterisation of the metal-weak thick and thin\ndiscs, for which chemo-dynamical models still have difficulties in reproducing.\n", "  Asteroseismology has started to provide constraints on stellar properties\nthat will be essential to accurately reconstruct the history of the Milky Way.\nHere we look at the information content in data sets representing current and\nfuture space missions (CoRoT, Kepler, K2, TESS, and PLATO) for red giant stars.\nWe describe techniques for extracting the information in the frequency power\nspectrum and apply these techniques to {\\it Kepler} data sets of different\nobserving length to represent the different space missions. We demonstrate that\nfor KIC 12008916, a low-luminosity red giant branch star, we can extract useful\ninformation from all data sets, and for all but the shortest data set we obtain\ngood constraint on the g-mode period spacing and core rotation rates. We\ndiscuss how the high precision in these parameters will constrain the stellar\nproperties of stellar radius, distance, mass and age. We show that high\nprecision can be achieved in mass and hence age when values of the g-mode\nperiod spacing are available. We caution that tests to establish the accuracy\nof asteroseismic masses and ages are still \"work in progress\".\n", "  Metallicity gradients provide strong constraints for understanding the\nchemical evolution of the Galaxy. We report on radial abundance gradients of\nFe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304 red-giant members of 29\ndisk open clusters, mostly concentrated at galactocentric distances between ~8\n- 15 kpc, but including two open clusters in the outer disk. The observations\nare from the APOGEE survey. The chemical abundances were derived automatically\nby the ASPCAP pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. The\ngradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively flat,\nwith slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex/kpc for the alpha-elements [O/H],\n[Ca/H], [Si/H] and [Mg/H] and -0.035 dex/kpc and -0.040 dex/kpc for [Fe/H] and\n[Ni/H], respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility that\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk (R_GC ~7 - 12 kpc)\nand flatter towards the outer disk. The open cluster sample studied spans a\nsignificant range in age. When breaking the sample into age bins, there is some\nindication that the younger open cluster population in our sample (log age <\n8.7) has a flatter metallicity gradient when compared with the gradients\nobtained from older open clusters.\n", "  We consider the lower bound for the shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio,\nobtained from the fluid/gravity correspondence, in order to constrain the\npost-Newtonian parameter of brane-world metrics. In particular, we analyse the\nCasadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati (CFM) effective solutions for the gravity side of\nthe correspondence and argue that including higher order terms in the\nhydrodynamic expansion can lead to a full agreement with the experimental\nbounds, for the Eddington-Robertson-Schiff post-Newtonian parameter in the CFM\nmetrics. This lends further support to the physical relevance of the\nviscosity-to-entropy ratio lower bound and fluid/gravity correspondence. Hence\nwe show that CFM black branes are, effectively, Schwarzschild black branes.\n", "  We found the alignement of elongated clusters of BM type I and III (the\nexcess of small values of the \\Delta\\theta angles is observed), having range\ntill about 60Mpc/h. The first one is probably connected with the origin of\nsupergiant galaxy, while the second one with environmental effects in clusters,\noriginated on the long filament or plane.\n", "  Morphological types were determined for 247 rich galaxy clusters from the PF\nCatalogue of Galaxy Clusters and Groups. The adapted types are based on\nclassical morphological schemes and consider concentration to the cluster\ncenter, the signs of preferential direction or plane in the cluster, and the\npositions of the brightest galaxies. It is shown that both concentration and\npreferential plane are significant and independent morphological criteria.\n", "  We theoretically examine a scheme for projectively reading out the parity\nstate of a pair of Majorana bound states (MBS) using a tunnel coupled quantum\ndot. The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from\nany reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement.\nThe combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer\nbetween the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is\ncontrolled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy\nsplitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter\nsplitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite\nvalue by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that\nthe oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to\nreadout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot\npotential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity\nparity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS,\nand that there is a tradeoff between required precisions of temporal and\nspatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus\nseparation would present a clear signature of topological order, and could be\nused to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement\nin certain schemes for scalable topological qubits. We show how the scheme can\nbe extended to distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to\ngate calibration errors.\n", "  We report the discovery of BD+20594b, a high density sub-Neptune exoplanet,\nmade using photometry from Campaign 4 of the two-wheeled Kepler (K2) mission,\nground-based radial velocity follow-up from HARPS and high resolution lucky and\nadaptive optics imaging obtained using AstraLux and MagAO, respectively. The\nhost star is a bright ($V=11.04$, $K_s = 9.37$), slightly metal poor\n([Fe/H]$=-0.15\\pm 0.05$ dex) solar analogue located at $152.1^{+9.7}_{-7.4}$ pc\nfrom Earth, for which we find a radius of $R_*=0.928^{+0.055}_{-0.040}R_\\odot$\nand a mass of $M_* = 0.961^{+0.032}_{-0.029}M_\\odot$. A joint analysis of the\nK2 photometry and HARPS radial velocities reveal that the planet is in a\n$\\approx 42$ day orbit around its host star, has a radius of\n$2.23^{+0.14}_{-0.11}R_\\oplus$, and a mass of $16.3^{+6.0}_{-6.1}M_\\oplus$.\nAlthough the data at hand puts the planet in the region of the mass-radius\ndiagram where we could expect planets with a pure rock (i.e. magnesium\nsilicate) composition using two-layer models (i.e., between rock/iron and\nrock/ice compositions), we discuss more realistic three-layer composition\nmodels which can explain the high density of the discovered exoplanet. The fact\nthat the planet lies in the boundary between \"possibly rocky\" and \"non-rocky\"\nexoplanets, makes it an interesting planet for future RV follow-up.\n", "  The Ge:Ga detectors used in the PACS spectrograph onboard the Herschel space\ntelescope react to changes of the incident flux with a certain delay. This\ngenerates transient effects on the resulting signal which can be important and\nlast for up to an hour. The paper presents a study of the effects of transients\non the detected signal and proposes methods to mitigate them especially in the\ncase of the \"unchopped\" mode. Since transients can arise from a variety of\ncauses, we classified them in three main categories: transients caused by\nsudden variations of the continuum due to the observational mode used;\ntransients caused by cosmic ray impacts on the detectors; transients caused by\na continuous smooth variation of the continuum during a wavelength scan. We\npropose a method to disentangle these effects and treat them separately. In\nparticular, we show that a linear combination of three exponential functions is\nneeded to fit the response variation of the detectors during a transient. An\nalgorithm to detect, fit, and correct transient effects is presented. The\nsolution proposed to correct the signal for the effects of transients\nsubstantially improves the quality of the final reduction with respect to the\nstandard methods used for archival reduction in the case where transient\neffects are most pronounced. The programs developed to implement the\ncorrections are offered through two new interactive data reduction pipelines in\nthe latest releases of the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment.\n", "  Low-mass white dwarfs (LMWDs) are believed to be exclusive products of binary\nevolution, as the Universe is not yet old enough to produce them from single\nstars. Because of the strong tidal forces operating during the binary\ninteraction phase, the remnant host systems observed today are expected to have\nnegligible eccentricities. Here, we report on the first unambiguous\nidentification of a LMWD in an eccentric (e=0.13) orbit with a millisecond\npulsar, which directly contradicts this picture. We use our spectra and\nradio-timing solution (derived elsewhere) to infer the WD temperature T_eff =\n8600 +/- 190 K) and 3D systemic velocity (179.5 km\\s). We also place\nmodel-independent constraints on the WD radius (R_WD = 0.024+/- 0.004/0.002\nR_sun) and surface gravity (log g = 7.11 +/- 0.08/0.16 dex). The WD and\nkinematic properties are consistent with the expectations for low-mass X-ray\nbinary evolution and disfavour a three-body formation channel. In the case of\nthe high eccentricity being the result of a spontaneous phase transition, we\ninfer a mass of 1.6 M_sun for the progenitor of the pulsar, which is too low\nfor the quark-nova mechanism proposed by Jiang et al. (2015). Similarly, the\nscenario of Freire & Tauris (2014), in which a WD collapses onto a neutron star\nvia an rotationally-delayed accretion-induced collapse, requires both a\nhigh-mass differentially rotating progenitor and a significant momentum kick at\nbirth under our constraints. Contrarily, we find that eccentricity pumping via\ninteraction with a transient circumbinary disk is consistent with all inferred\nproperties. Finally, we report tentative evidence for pulsations which, if\nconfirmed, would transform the star into an unprecedented laboratory for WD\nphysics and stellar convection.\n", "  Classical realism demands that system properties exist independently of\nwhether they are measured, while noncontextuality demands that the results of\nmeasurements do not depend on what other measurements are performed in\nconjunction with them. The Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that\nnoncontextual realism cannot reproduce the measurement statistics of a single\nthree-level quantum system (qutrit). Noncontextual realistic models may thus be\ntested using a single qutrit without relying on the notion of quantum\nentanglement in contrast to Bell inequality tests. It is challenging to refute\nsuch models experimentally, since imperfections may introduce loopholes that\nenable a realist interpretation. Here we use a superconducting qutrit with\ndeterministic, binary-outcome readouts to violate a noncontextuality inequality\nwhile addressing the detection, individual-existence and compatibility\nloopholes. This evidence of state-dependent contextuality also demonstrates the\nfitness of superconducting quantum circuits for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation in surface-code architectures, currently the most promising route\nto scalable quantum computing.\n", "  Pd(100) ultrathin films show ferromagnetism induced by the confinement of\nelectrons in the film, i.e., the quantum-well mechanism. In this study, we\ninvestigate the effect of the change in the interface structure between a Pd\nfilm and SrTiO3 substrate on quantum-well induced ferromagnetism using the\nstructural phase transition of SrTiO3. During repeated measurement of\ntemperature- dependent magnetization of the Pd/SrTiO3 system, cracks were\ninduced in the Pd overlayer near the interface region by the structural phase\ntransition of SrTiO3, thereby changing the film-thickness dependence of the\nmagnetic moment. This is explained by the concept that as the magnetic moment\nin Pd(100) changed, so too did the thickness of the quantum-well. In addition,\nwe observed that the ferromagnetism in the Pd(100) disappeared with the\naccumulation of cracks due to the repetition of the temperature cycle through\nthe phase-transition temperature. This suggests that lowering the crystallinity\nof the interface structure by producing a large number of cracks has a negative\neffect on quantum-well induced ferromagnetism.\n", "  The Gaia mission will have a profound impact on our understanding of the\nstructure and dynamics of the Milky Way. Gaia is providing an exhaustive census\nof stellar parallaxes, proper motions, positions, colors and radial velocities,\nbut also leaves some flaring holes in an otherwise complete data set. The\nradial velocities measured with the on-board high-resolution spectrograph will\nonly reach some 10% of the full sample of stars with astrometry and photometry\nfrom the mission, and detailed chemical information will be obtained for less\nthan 1%. Teams all over the world are organizing large-scale projects to\nprovide complementary radial velocities and chemistry, since this can now be\ndone very efficiently from the ground thanks to large and mid-size telescopes\nwith a wide field-of-view and multi-object spectrographs. As a result,\nautomated data processing is taking an ever increasing relevance, and the\nconcept is applying to many more areas, from targeting to analysis. In this\npaper, I provide a quick overview of recent, ongoing, and upcoming\nspectroscopic surveys, and the strategies adopted in their automated analysis\npipelines.\n", "  We derive analytic formula for electric and magnetic fields produced by a\nmoving charged particle in a conducting medium with the electric conductivity\n$\\sigma$ and the chiral magnetic conductivity $\\sigma_{\\chi}$. We use the Green\nfunction method and assume that $\\sigma_{\\chi}$ is much smaller than $\\sigma$.\nThe compact algebraic expressions for electric and magnetic fields without any\nintegrals are obtained. They recover the Lienard-Wiechert formula at vanishing\nconductivities. Exact numerical solutions are also found for any values of\n$\\sigma$ and $\\sigma_{\\chi}$ and are compared to analytic results. Both\nnumerical and analytic results agree very well for the scale of high energy\nheavy ion collisions. The space-time profiles of electromagnetic fields in\nnon-central Au+Au collisions have been calculated based on these analytic\nformula as well as exact numerical solutions.\n", "  The study of the evolution of star-forming galaxies requires the\ndetermination of accurate kinematics and scaling relations out to high\nredshift. In this paper we select a sample of 18 galaxies at z~1, observed in\nthe H-alpha emission-line with KMOS, to derive accurate kinematics using a\nnovel 3D analysis technique. We use the new code 3D-Barolo, that models the\ngalaxy emission directly in the 3D observational space, without the need to\nextract kinematic maps. This technique's major advantage is that it is not\naffected by beam smearing and thus it enables the determination of rotation\nvelocity and intrinsic velocity dispersion, even at low spatial resolution. We\nfind that: 1) the rotation curves of these z~1 galaxies rise very steeply\nwithin few kiloparsecs and remain flat out to the outermost radius and 2) the\nH-alpha velocity dispersions are low, ranging from 15 to 40 km/s, which leads\nto V/sigma = 3-10. These characteristics are similar to those of disc galaxies\nin the local Universe. Finally, we also report no significant evolution of the\nstellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation. Our results show that disc galaxies are\nkinematically mature and rotation-dominated already at z~1.\n", "  We present the analytical expressions for the next-to-leading order\ncorrections to the partial decay width $t(\\uparrow) \\rightarrow bW^+$, followed\nby $b\\rightarrow H_bX$, for nonzero b-quark mass ($m_b\\neq 0$) in the\nfixed-flavor-number scheme (FFNs). To make the predictions for the energy\ndistribution of outgoing hadrons $H_b$, as a function of the normalized\n$H_b$-energy fraction $x_H$, we apply the general-mass variable-flavor-number\nscheme (GM-VFNs) in a specific helicity coordinate system where the\npolarization of top quark is evaluated relative to the b-quark momentum. We\nalso study the effects of gluon fragmentation and finite hadron mass on the\nhadron energy spectrum so that hadron masses are responsible for the low-$x_H$\nthreshold. In order to describe both the b-quark and the gluon hadronizations\nin top decays we apply realistic and nonperturbative fragmentation functions\nextracted through a global fit to $e^+e^-$ annihilation data from CERN LEP1 and\nSLAC SLC by relying on their universality and scaling violations.\n", "  We report on the capillary-driven levelling of a topographical perturbation\nat the surface of a free-standing liquid nanofilm. The width of a stepped\nsurface profile is found to evolve as the square root of time. The hydrodynamic\nmodel is in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In addition to\nexhibiting an analogy with diffusive processes, this novel system serves as a\nprecise nanoprobe for the rheology of liquids at interfaces in a configuration\nthat avoids substrate effects.\n", "  We present a comparative study of two self-assembled quantum dot (QD) systems\nbased on II-VI compounds: CdTe/ZnTe and CdSe/ZnSe. Using magneto-optical\ntechniques we investigated a large population of individual QDs. The systematic\nphotoluminescence studies of emission lines related to the recombination of\nneutral exciton X, biexciton XX, and singly charged excitons (X$^+$, X$^-$)\nallowed us to determine average parameters describing CdTe QDs (CdSe QDs): X-XX\ntransition energy difference 12 meV (24 meV); fine-structure splitting\n$\\delta_{1}=$0.14 meV ($\\delta_{1}=$0.47 meV); $g$-factor $g=$2.12 ($g=$1.71);\ndiamagnetic shift $\\gamma=$2.5 $\\mu$eV$/$T$^{2}$ ($\\gamma=$1.3\n$\\mu$eV$/$T$^{2}$). We find also statistically significant correlations between\nvarious parameters describing internal structure of excitonic complexes.\n", "  We study an asymmetric simple exclusion process in a strip in the presence of\na solid impenetrable barrier. We focus on the effect of the barrier on the\nresidence time of the particles, namely, the typical time needed by the\nparticles to cross the whole strip. We explore the conditions for reduced\njamming when varying the environment (different drifts, reservoir densities,\nhorizontal diffusion walks, etc.). Particularly, we discover an interesting\nnon--monotonic behavior of the residence time as a function of the barrier\nlength. Besides recovering by means of both the lattice dynamics and mean-field\nmodel well-known aspects like faster-is-slower effect and the intermittence of\nthe flow, we propose also a birth-and-death process and a reduced\none-dimensional model with variable barrier permeability to capture\nqualitatively the behavior of the residence time with respect to the\nparameters. We report our first steps towards the understanding to which extent\nthe presence of obstacles can fluidize pedestrian and biological transport in\ncrowded heterogeneous environments.\n", "  Quantum holonomy theory is a candidate for a non-perturbative theory of\nquantum gravity coupled to fermions. The theory is based on the QHD(M) algebra,\nwhich essentially encodes how matter degrees of freedom are moved on a\nthree-dimensional manifold. In this paper we commence the development of a\nlattice-independent formulation. We first introduce a flow-dependent version of\nthe QHD(M) algebra and formulate necessary conditions for a state to exist\nhereon. We then use the GNS construction to build a kinematical Hilbert space.\nFinally we find that operators, that correspond to the Dirac and gravitational\nHamiltonians in a semi-classical limit, are background independent.\n", "  We propose a method to prepare an entangled spin-orbit state between the spin\nand the orbital angular momenta of a neutron wavepacket. This spin-orbit state\nis created by passing neutrons through the center of a quadrupole magnetic\nfield, which provides a coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of\nfreedom. A Ramsey fringe type measurement is suggested as a means of verifying\nthe spin-orbit correlations.\n", "  We study the hot and cold circum-galactic medium (CGM) of 86 galaxies of the\ncosmological, hydrodynamical simulation suite NIHAO. NIHAO allows a study of\nhow the $z=0$ CGM varies across 5 orders of magnitude of stellar mass using OVI\nand HI as proxies for hot and cold gas. The cool HI covering fraction and\ncolumn density profiles match observations well, particularly in the inner CGM.\nOVI shows increasing column densities with mass, a trend seemingly echoed in\nthe observations. As in multiple previous simulations, the OVI column densities\nin simulations are lower than observed and optically thick HI does not extend\nas far out as in observations. We take a look at the collisional ionisation\nfraction of OVI as a function of halo mass. We make observable predictions of\nthe bipolarity of outflows and their effect on the general shape of the CGM.\nBipolar outflows can be seen out to around 40 kpc in intermediate and low mass\nhalos ($M_{\\mathrm{halo}}<10^{11}M_{\\mathrm{sun}}$), but outside that radius,\nthe CGM is too well mixed to detect an elongated shape. Larger halos have\nextended gas discs beyond the stellar disc that dominate the shape of the inner\nCGM. The simulated CGM is remarkably spherical even in low mass simulations.\nThe chemical enrichment of both halo and disc gas follow expected increasing\ntrends as a function of halo mass that are well fit with power laws. These\nrelations can be used in non-hydrodynamic models, such as semi-analytic models.\n", "  Energy is at best defined quasilocally in general relativity. Quasilocal\nenergy definitions depend on the conditions one imposes on the boundary\nHamiltonian, i.e., how a finite region of spacetime is \"isolated\". Here, we\npropose a method to define and investigate systems in terms of their matter\nplus gravitational energy content. We adopt a generic construction, that\ninvolves embedding of an arbitrary dimensional world sheet into an arbitrary\ndimensional spacetime, to a 2 + 2 picture. In our case, the closed\n2-dimensional spacelike surface $\\mathbb{S}$, that is orthogonal to the\n2-dimensional timelike world sheet $\\mathbb{T}$ at every point, encloses the\nsystem in question. The integrability conditions of $\\mathbb{T}$ and\n$\\mathbb{S}$ correspond to three null tetrad gauge conditions once we transform\nour notation to the one of the null cone observables. We interpret the\nRaychaudhuri equation of $\\mathbb{T}$ as a work-energy relation for systems\nthat are not in equilibrium with their surroundings. We achieve this by\nidentifying the quasilocal charge densities corresponding to rotational and\nnonrotational degrees of freedom, in addition to a relative work density\nassociated with tidal fields. We define the corresponding quasilocal charges\nthat appear in our work-energy relation and which can potentially be exchanged\nwith the surroundings. These charges and our tetrad conditions are invariant\nunder type-III Lorentz transformations, i.e., the boosting of the observers in\nthe directions orthogonal to $\\mathbb{S}$. We apply our construction to a\nradiating Vaidya spacetime, a $C$-metric and the interior of a Lanczos-van\nStockum dust metric. The delicate issues related to the axially symmetric\nstationary spacetimes and possible extensions to the Kerr geometry are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Quantum annealing is explored as a resource for quantum information beyond\nsolution of classical combinatorial problems. Envisaged as a generator of\nrobust interferometric probes, we examine a Hamiltonian of $N>> 1$\nuniformly-coupled spins subject to a transverse magnetic field. The discrete\nmany-body problem is mapped onto dynamics of a single one-dimensional particle\nin a continuous potential. This reveals all the qualitative features of the\nground state beyond typical mean-field or large classical spin models. It\nillustrates explicitly a graceful warping from an entangled unimodal to\nbi-modal ground state in the phase transition region. The transitional\n`Goldilocks' probe has a component distribution of width $N^{2/3}$ and exhibits\ncharacteristics for enhanced phase estimation in a decoherent environment. In\nthe presence of realistic local noise and collective dephasing, we find this\nprobe state asymptotically saturates ultimate precision bounds calculated\npreviously. By reducing the transverse field adiabatically, the Goldilocks\nprobe is prepared in advance of the minimum gap bottleneck, allowing the\nannealing schedule to be terminated `early'. Adiabatic time complexity of probe\npreparation is shown to be linear in $N$\n", "  The interferometric LIGO detectors have recently measured the first direct\ngravitational-wave signal from what has been interpreted as the inspiral,\nmerger and ringdown of a binary system of black holes. The signal-to-noise\nratio of the measured signal is large enough to leave little doubt that it does\nrefer to the inspiral of two massive and ultracompact objects, whose merger\nyields a rotating black hole. Yet, the quality of the data is such that some\nroom is left for alternative interpretations that do not involve black holes,\nbut other objects that, within classical general relativity, can be equally\nmassive and compact, namely, gravastars. We here consider the hypothesis that\nthe merging objects were indeed gravastars and explore whether the merged\nobject could therefore be not a black hole but a rotating gravastar. After\ncomparing the real and imaginary parts of the ringdown signal of GW150914 with\nthe corresponding quantities for a variety of gravastars, and notwithstanding\nthe very limited knowledge of the perturbative response of rotating gravastars,\nwe conclude it is not possible to model the measured ringdown of GW150914 as\ndue to a rotating gravastar.\n", "  We present an analog quantum simulator of spacetimes containing traversable\nwormholes. A suitable spatial dependence in the external bias of a dc-SQUID\narray mimics the propagation of light in a 1D wormhole background. The\nimpedance of the array places severe limitations on the type of spacetime that\nwe are able to implement. However, we find that wormhole throat radius in the\nsub-mm range are achievable. We show how to modify this spacetime in order to\nallow the existence of closed timelike curves. The quantum fluctuations of the\nphase associated to the finite array impedance might be seen as an analogue of\nHawking's chronology protection mechanism.\n", "  We study the dynamics of excitons in GaAs/(Al,Ga)As core-shell nanowires by\ncontinuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence and photoluminescence\nexcitation spectroscopy. Strong Al segregation in the shell of the nanowires\nleads to the formation of Ga-rich inclusions acting as quantum dots. At 10 K,\nintense light emission associated with these shell quantum dots is observed.\nThe average radiative lifetime of excitons confined in the shell quantum dots\nis 1.7 ns. We show that excitons may tunnel toward adjacent shell quantum dots\nand nonradiative point defects. We investigate the changes in the dynamics of\ncharge carriers in the shell with increasing temperature, with particular\nemphasis on the transfer of carriers from the shell to the core of the\nnanowires. We finally discuss the implications of carrier localization in the\n(Al,Ga)As shell for fundamental studies and optoelectronic applications based\non core-shell III-As nanowires.\n", "  Bell's theorem shows that our intuitive understanding of causation must be\noverturned in light of quantum correlations. Nevertheless, quantum mechanics\ndoes not permit signalling and hence a notion of cause remains. Understanding\nthis notion is not only important at a fundamental level, but also for\ntechnological applications such as key distribution and randomness expansion.\nIt has recently been shown that a useful way to decide which classical causal\nstructures could give rise to a given set of correlations is to use entropy\nvectors. These are vectors whose components are the entropies of all subsets of\nthe observed variables in the causal structure. The entropy vector method\nemploys causal relationships among the variables to restrict the set of\npossible entropy vectors. Here, we consider whether the same approach can lead\nto useful certificates of non-classicality within a given causal structure.\nSurprisingly, we find that for a family of causal structures that include the\nusual bipartite Bell structure they do not. For all members of this family, no\nfunction of the entropies of the observed variables gives such a certificate,\nin spite of the existence of nonclassical correlations. It is therefore\nnecessary to look beyond entropy vectors to understand cause from a quantum\nperspective.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional system of particles with strong zero-range\ninteractions. This system can be mapped onto a spin chain of the Heisenberg\ntype with exchange coefficients that depend on the external trap. In this\npaper, we present an algorithm that can be used to compute these exchange\ncoefficients. We introduce an open source code CONAN (Coefficients of\nOne-dimensional N-Atom Networks) which is based on this algorithm. CONAN works\nwith arbitrary external potentials and we have tested its reliability for\nsystem sizes up to around 35 particles. As illustrative examples, we consider a\nharmonic trap and a box trap with a superimposed asymmetric tilted potential.\nFor these examples, the computation time typically scales with the number of\nparticles as $O(N^{3.5 \\pm 0.4})$. Computation times are around 10 seconds for\n$N=10$ particles and less than 10 minutes for $N=20$ particles.\n", "  A theoretical study of Mo2TiAlC2 compound belonging to the MAX phases has\nbeen performed by using the firstprinciples pseudopotential plane-wave method\nwithin the generalized gradient approximation. We have calculated the\nstructural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of Mo2TiAlC2. To confirm\nmechanical stability, the elastic constants Cij are calculated. Other elastic\nparameters such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, compressibility, Young modulus,\nanisotropic factor, Pugh ratio, Poisson ratio are also calculated. The energy\nband structure and density of states are calculated and analyzed. The results\nshow that the electrical conductivity is metallic with a high density of states\nat the Fermi level in which Mo 4d states dominate. Furthermore, the optical\nproperties such as dielectric function, refractive index, photoconductivity,\nabsorption coefficients, loss function and reflectivity are also calculated.\nIts reflectance spectrum shows that it has the potential to be used as a\npromising shielding material to avoid solar heating.\n", "  We introduce a class of unified supersymmetric axion theories with unified\nand PQ symmetries broken by the same set of fields at a scale $\\sim 2\\times\n10^{16}$ GeV. A typical domain wall number of order 30 leads to an axion decay\nconstant $f_a$ of order $10^{15}$ GeV. Inflation generates a large saxion\ncondensate giving a reheat temperature $T_R$ below the QCD scale for\nsupersymmetry breaking of order $1-10$ TeV. Axion field oscillations commence\nin the saxion matter-dominated era near the QCD scale, and recent lattice\ncomputations of the temperature dependence of the axion mass in this era allow\na controlled calculation of the axion dark matter abundance. A successful\nprediction of this abundance results for an initial axion misalignment angle of\norder unity, $\\theta_i \\sim 1$. A highly correlated set of predictions is\ndiscussed for $f_a$, $T_R$, the supersymmetric Higgs mass parameter $\\mu$, the\namount of dark radiation $\\Delta N_{eff}$, the proton decay rate $\\Gamma(p\n\\rightarrow e^+ \\pi^0)$, isocurvature density perturbations and the $B$-mode of\nthe cosmic microwave background. The last two are particularly interesting when\nthe energy scale of inflation is also of order $10^{16}$ GeV.\n", "  We present results of energetic laser-ion acceleration from a tailored, near\nsolid density gas target. Colliding hydrodynamic shocks compress a pure\nhydrogen gas jet into a 70 {\\mu}m thick target prior to the arrival of the\nultra-intense laser pulse. A density scan reveals the transition from a regime\ncharacterized by a wide angle, low energy beam to one of a more focused beam\nwith a high energy halo. In the latter case, three dimensional simulations show\nthe formation of a Z-pinch driven by the axial current resulting from laser\nwakefield accelerated electrons. Ions at the rear of the target are then\naccelerated by a combination of space charge fields from accelerated electrons\nand Coulombic repulsion as the pinch dissipates.\n", "  Few-layer phosphorene MOSFETs with 0.3-um-long gate and 15-nm-thick Al2O3\ngate insulator was found to exhibit a forward-current cutoff frequency of 2 GHz\nand a maximum oscillation frequency of 8 GHz after de-embedding for the\nparasitic capacitance associated mainly with the relatively large probe pads.\nThe gate lag and drain lag of the transistor was found to be on the order of 1\nus or less, which is consistent with the lack of hysteresis, carrier freeze-out\nor persistent photoconductivity in DC characteristics. These results confirm\nthat the phosphorene MOSFET can be a viable microwave transistor for both\nsmall-signal and large-signal applications.\n", "  We present the first public release (v0.1) of the open-source GADGET\nDataframe Library: gadfly. The aim of this package is to leverage the\ncapabilities of the broader python scientific computing ecosystem by providing\ntools for analyzing simulation data from the astrophysical simulation codes\nGADGET and GIZMO using pandas, a thoroughly documented, open-source library\nproviding high-performance, easy-to-use data structures that is quickly\nbecoming the standard for data analysis in python. Gadfly is a framework for\nanalyzing particle-based simulation data stored in the HDF5 format using pandas\nDataFrames. The package enables efficient memory management, includes utilities\nfor unit handling, coordinate transformations, and parallel batch processing,\nand provides highly optimized routines for visualizing smoothed-particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) datasets.\n", "  We explore magnetic behavior of kagome francisites Cu3Bi(SeO3)2O2X (X = Cl\nand Br) using first-principles calculations. To this end, we propose an\napproach based on the Hubbard model in the Wannier functions basis constructed\non the level of local-density approximation (LDA). The ground-state spin\nconfiguration is determined by a Hartree-Fock solution of the Hubbard model\nboth in zero magnetic field and in applied magnetic fields. Additionally,\nparameters of an effective spin Hamiltonian are obtained by taking into account\nthe hybridization effects and spin-orbit coupling. We show that only the former\napproach, the Hartree-Fock solution of the Hubbard model, allows for a complete\ndescription of the anisotropic magnetization process. While our calculations\nconfirm that the canted zero-field ground state arises from a competition\nbetween ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic\nnext-nearest-neighbor couplings in the kagome planes, weaker anisotropic terms\nare crucial for fixing spin directions and for the overall magnetization\nprocess. We thus show that the Hartree-Fock solution of an electronic\nHamiltonian is a viable alternative to the analysis of effective spin\nHamiltonians when a magnetic ground state and effects of external field are\nconsidered.\n", "  Spin waves are collective excitations propagating in the magnetic medium with\nordered magnetizations. Magnonics, utilizing the spin wave (magnon) as\ninformation carrier, is a promising candidate for low-dissipation computation\nand communication technologies. We discover that, due to the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, the scattering behavior of spin wave at a\nmagnetic domain wall follows a generalized Snell's law, where two magnetic\ndomains work as two different mediums. Similar to optical total reflection that\noccurs at the water-air interfaces, spin waves may experience total reflection\nat magnetic domain walls when their incident angle larger than a critical\nvalue. We design a spin wave fiber using a magnetic domain structure with two\ndomain walls, and demonstrate that such a spin wave fiber can transmit spin\nwaves over long distance by total internal reflections, in analogy to an\noptical fiber. Our design of spin wave fiber opens up new possibilities in pure\nmagnetic information processing.\n", "  Observations of the molecular gas over scales of 0.5 to several kpc provide\ncrucial information on how gas moves through galaxies, especially in mergers\nand interacting systems, where it ultimately reaches the galaxy center,\naccumulates, and feeds nuclear activity. Studying the processes involved in the\ngas transport is an important step forward to understand galaxy evolution.\n12CO, 13CO and C18O1-0 high-sensitivity ALMA observations were used to assess\nproperties of the large-scale molecular gas reservoir and its connection to the\ncircumnuclear molecular ring in NGC1614. The role of excitation and abundances\nwere studied in this context. Spatial distributions of the 12CO and 13CO\nemission show significant differences. 12CO traces the large-scale molecular\ngas reservoir, associated with a dust lane that harbors infalling gas. 13CO\nemission is - for the first time - detected in the large-scale dust lane. Its\nemission peaks between dust lane and circumnuclear molecular ring. A\n12CO-to-13CO1-0 intensity ratio map shows high values in the ring region (~30)\ntypical for the centers of luminous galaxy mergers and even more extreme values\nin the dust lane (>45). This drop in ratio is consistent with molecular gas in\nthe dust lane being in a diffuse, unbound state while being funneled towards\nthe nucleus. We find a high 16O-to-18O abundance ratio in the starburst region\n(>900), typical of quiescent disk gas - by now, the starburst is expected to\nhave enriched the nuclear ISM in 18O relative to 16O. The massive inflow of gas\nmay be partially responsible for the low 18O/16O abundance since it will dilute\nthe starburst enrichment with unprocessed gas from greater radii. The\n12CO-to-13CO abundance is consistent with this scenario. It suggests that the\nnucleus of NGC1614 is in a transient phase of evolution where starburst and\nnuclear growth are fuelled by returning gas from the minor merger event.\n", "  The hadronic ($\\Gamma^{\\rm W}_{\\rm had}$) and total ($\\Gamma^{\\rm W}_{\\rm\ntot}$) widths of the W boson, computed at least at\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy, are combined to derive a new\nprecise prediction for the hadronic W branching ratio ${\\cal B}^{\\rm W}_{\\rm\nhad} \\equiv \\Gamma^{\\rm W}_{\\rm had}/\\Gamma^{\\rm W}_{\\rm tot}$ = $0.682 \\pm\n0.011_{\\rm par}$, using the experimental Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix\nelements, or ${\\cal B}^{\\rm W}_{\\rm had} = 0.6742 \\pm 0.0002_{\\rm th} \\pm\n0.0001_{\\rm par}$ assuming CKM unitarity, with uncertainties dominated by the\ninput parameters of the calculations. Comparing the theoretical predictions and\nexperimental measurements for various W decay observables, the NNLO strong\ncoupling constant at the Z pole, $\\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.117 \\pm 0.042_{\\rm exp} \\pm\n0.004_{\\rm th} \\pm 0.001_{\\rm par}$, as well as the charm-strange CKM element,\n$\\rm V_{cs}$ = 0.973 $\\pm$ 0.004$_{\\rm exp}$ $\\pm$ 0.002$_{\\rm par}$, can be\nextracted under different assumptions. We also show that W decays provide today\nthe most precise test of CKM unitarity for the 5 quarks lighter than $m_{\\rm\nW}$, $\\sum_{ u,c,d,s,b} |V_{ ij}|^2 = 1.999 \\pm 0.008_{\\rm exp} \\pm 0.001_{\\rm\nth}$. Perspectives for $\\alpha_s$ and $\\rm V_{cs}$ extractions from W decays\nmeasurements at the LHC and future $e^+e^-$ colliders are presented.\n", "  We propose a mechanism to generate a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of\nadiabatic scalar perturbations about a stable, ekpyrotic background. The key\ningredient is a coupling between a single ekpyrotic field and a perfect fluid\nof ultra-relativistic matter. This coupling introduces a friction term into the\nequation of motion for the field, opposing the Hubble anti-friction, which can\nbe chosen such that an exactly scale-invariant (or nearly scale-invariant)\nspectrum of adiabatic density perturbations is continuously produced throughout\nthe ekpyrotic phase. This mechanism eliminates the need for a second (entropic)\nscalar field and hence any need for introducing a second phase for converting\nentropic into curvature fluctuations. It also reduces the constraints on the\nequation of state during the ekpyrotic phase and, thereby, the need for\nparametric fine-tuning.\n", "  Experiments on trapped quantum gases can probe challenging regimes of quantum\nmany-body dynamics, where strong interactions or non-equilibrium states prevent\nexact solutions. Here we present an exact result which holds even when no exact\nsolutions can be found: a class of spacetime mappings of different experiments\nonto each other, as long as the gas particles interact via two-body potentials\nwhich possess a scaling property that most real interactions do possess. Since\nour result is an identity relating second-quantized field operators in the\nHeisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, it is otherwise general; it applies to\narbitrary measurements on any mixtures of Bose or Fermi gases, in arbitrary\ninitial states. Practical applications of this mapping include perfect\nsimulation of non-trivial experiments with other experiments which may be\neasier to perform.\n", "  Continuous wave (CW) lasers are the enabling technology for producing\nultracold atoms and molecules through laser cooling and trapping. The resulting\npristine samples of slow moving particles are the de facto starting point for\nboth fundamental and applied science when a highly-controlled quantum system is\nrequired. Laser cooled atoms have recently led to major advances in quantum\ninformation, the search to understand dark energy, quantum chemistry, and\nquantum sensors. However, CW laser technology currently limits laser cooling\nand trapping to special types of elements that do not include highly abundant\nand chemically relevant atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.\nHere, we demonstrate that Doppler cooling and trapping by optical frequency\ncombs may provide a route to trapped, ultracold atoms whose spectra are not\namenable to CW lasers. We laser cool a gas of atoms by driving a two-photon\ntransition with an optical frequency comb, an efficient process to which every\ncomb tooth coherently contributes. We extend this technique to create a\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT), an electromagnetic beaker for accumulating the\nlaser-cooled atoms for further study. Our results suggest that the efficient\nfrequency conversion offered by optical frequency combs could provide a key\ningredient for producing trapped, ultracold samples of nature's most abundant\nbuilding blocks, as well as antihydrogen. As such, the techniques demonstrated\nhere may enable advances in fields as disparate as molecular biology and the\nsearch for physics beyond the standard model.\n", "  We study how to engineer holographic models with features of a high\ntemperature superconductor phase diagram. We introduce a field in the bulk\nwhich provides a tunable \"doping\" parameter in the boundary theory. By\ndesigning how this field changes the effective masses of other order parameter\nfields, desired phase diagrams can be engineered. We give examples of\ngenerating phase diagrams with phase boundaries similar to a superconducting\ndome and an anti-ferromagnetic phase by including two order parameter fields.\nWe also explore whether the pseudo gap phase can be described without adding\nanother order parameter field and discuss the potential scaling symmetry\nassociated with a quantum critical point hidden under the superconducting dome\nin this phase diagram.\n", "  The topological properties of periodically driven many-body systems often\nhave no static analogs and defy a simple description based on the effective\nHamiltonian. To explore the emergent edge modes in driven p-wave\nsuperconductors in two dimensions, we analyze a toy model of Kitaev chains\n(one-dimensional spinless p-wave superconductors with Majorana edge states)\ncoupled by time-periodic hopping. We show that with proper driving, the coupled\nKitaev chains can turn into a fully gapped superconductor which is analogous to\nthe $p_x+ip_y$ state but has two, rather than one, chiral edge modes. A\ndifferent driving protocol turns it into a gapless superconductor with isolated\npoint nodes and completely flat edge states at quasienergy $\\omega=0$ or\n$\\pi/T$, with $T$ the driving period. The time evolution operator\n$U(k_x,k_y,t)$ of the toy model is computed exactly to yield the phase bands.\nAnd the \"topological singularities\" of the phase bands are exhausted and\ncompared to those of a periodically driven Hofstadter model which features\ncounter-propagating chiral edge modes. These examples demonstrate the unique\nedge states in driven superconducting systems and suggest driving as a\npotentially fruitful route to engineer new topological superconductors.\n", "  We report on the quenching of single Ni adatom moments on Te-terminated\nBi2Te2Se and Bi2Te3 topological insulator surfaces. The effect becomes\nmanifested as a missing X-ray magnetic circular dichroism for resonant L3,2\ntransitions into partially filled Ni 3d states of occupancy n_d = 9.2. On the\nbasis of a comparative study of Ni and Fe using scanning tunneling microscopy\nand ab initio calculations we are able to relate the element specific moment\nformation to a local Stoner criterion. While Fe adatoms form large spin moments\nof m_s = 2.54 mu_B with out-of-plane anisotropy due to a sufficiently large\ndensity of states at the Fermi energy, Ni remains well below an effective\nStoner threshold for local moment formation. With the Fermi level remaining in\nthe bulk band gap after adatom deposition, non-magnetic Ni and preferentially\nout-of-plane oriented magnetic Fe with similar structural properties on\nBi2Te2Se surfaces constitute a perfect platform to study off-on effects of\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking on topological surface states.\n", "  A spinning gas, heated adiabatically through axial compression, is known to\nexhibit a rotation-dependent heat capacity. However, as equilibrium is\napproached, a new effect is identified here wherein the temperature does not\ngrow homogeneously in the radial direction, but develops a temperature\ndifferential with the hottest region on axis, at the maximum of the centrifugal\npotential energy. This phenomenon, which we call a piezo-thermal effect, is\nshown to grow bilinearly with the compression rate and the amplitude of the\npotential. Numerical simulations confirm a simple model of this effect, which\ncan be generalized to other forms of potential energy and methods of heating.\n", "  In order to imitate anisotropic medium of a condensed matter system, we take\ninto account an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion model as a dual gravity theory\nwhere the anisotropy is caused by different momentum relaxations. This gravity\nmodel allows an anisotropic charged black hole solution. On this background, we\ninvestigate how the linear responses of vector modes like electric,\nthermoelectric, and thermal conductivities rely on the anisotropy. We find that\nthe electric conductivity in low frequency limit shows a Drude peak and that in\nthe intermediate frequency regime it reveals the power law behavior.\nEspecially, when the anisotropy increases the exponent of the power law becomes\nsmaller. In addition, we find that there exist a critical value for the\nanisotropy at which the DC conductivity reaches to its maximum value.\n", "  Multi-neutron systems are crucial to understanding the physics of\nneutron-rich nuclei and neutron stars. Neutron drops, neutrons confined in an\nexternal field, are investigated systematically in both non-relativistic and\nrelativistic density functional theories and with ab initio calculations. We\ndemonstrate a strong linear correlation, which is universal in the realm of\nmean-field models, between the rms radii of neutron drops and the neutron skin\nthickness of Pb-208 and Ca-48; i.e., the difference between the neutron and\nproton rms radii of a nucleus. Due to its high quality, this correlation can be\nused to deduce the radii of neutron drops from the measured neutron skin\nthickness in a model-independent way, and the radii obtained for neutron drops\ncan provide a useful constraint for realistic three neutron forces. This\ncorrelation, together with high- precision measurements of the neutron skin\nthicknesses of Pb-208 and Ca-48, will have an enduring impact on the\nunderstanding of multi-neutron interactions, neutron-rich nuclei, neutron\nstars, etc.\n", "  Strong and ultra-strong light-matter coupling are remarkable phenomena of\nquantum electrodynamics occurring when the interaction between a matter\nexcitation and the electromagnetic field cannot be described by usual\nperturbation theory. This is generally achieved by coupling an excitation with\nlarge oscillator strength to the confined electromagnetic mode of an optical\nmicrocavity. In this work we demonstrate that strong/ultra-strong coupling can\nalso take place in the absence of optical confinement. We have studied the\nnon-perturbative spontaneous emission of collective excitations in a dense\ntwo-dimensional electron gas that superradiantly decays into free space. By\nusing a quantum model based on the input-output formalism, we have derived the\nlinear optical properties of the coupled system and demonstrated that its\neigenstates are mixed light-matter particles, like in any system displaying\nstrong or ultra-strong light-matter interaction. Moreover, we have shown that\nin the ultra-strong coupling regime, i.e. when the radiative broadening is\ncomparable to the matter excitation energy, the commonly used rotating-wave and\nMarkov approximations yield unphysical results. Finally, the input-output\nformalism has allowed us to prove that Kirchhoff's law, describing thermal\nemission properties, applies to our system in all the light-matter coupling\nregimes considered in this work.\n", "  Recently, we had numerically shown that, for a non-minimal coupling that is a\nsimple power of the scale factor, scale invariant magnetic fields arise in a\nclass of bouncing universes. In this work, we {\\it analytically} evaluate the\nspectrum of magnetic and electric fields generated in a sub-class of such\nmodels. We illustrate that, for cosmological scales which have wavenumbers much\nsmaller than the wavenumber associated with the bounce, the shape of the\nspectrum is preserved across the bounce. Using the analytic solutions obtained,\nwe also illustrate that the problem of backreaction is severe at the bounce.\nFinally, we show that the power spectrum of the magnetic field remains\ninvariant under a two parameter family of transformations of the non-minimal\ncoupling function.\n", "  In the context of the FLASHLIGHT survey, we obtained deep narrow band images\nof 15 $z\\sim2$ quasars with GMOS on Gemini-South in an effort to measure\nLy$\\alpha$ emission from circum- and inter-galactic gas on scales of hundreds\nof kpc from the central quasar. We do not detect bright giant Ly$\\alpha$\nnebulae (SB~10$^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ at distances >50\nkpc) around any of our sources, although we routinely ($\\simeq47$%) detect\nsmaller scale <50 kpc Ly$\\alpha$ emission at this SB level emerging from either\nthe extended narrow emission line regions powered by the quasars or by\nstar-formation in their host galaxies. We stack our 15 deep images to study the\naverage extended Ly$\\alpha$ surface brightness profile around $z\\sim2$ quasars,\ncarefully PSF-subtracting the unresolved emission component and paying close\nattention to sources of systematic error. Our analysis, which achieves an\nunprecedented depth, reveals a surface brightness of SB$_{\\rm\nLy\\alpha}\\sim10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ at $\\sim200$ kpc,\nwith a $2.3\\sigma$ detection of Ly$\\alpha$ emission at SB$_{\\rm\nLy\\alpha}=(5.5\\pm3.1)\\times10^{-20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$\nwithin an annulus spanning 50 kpc <R< 500 kpc from the quasars. Assuming this\nLy$\\alpha$ emission is powered by fluorescence from highly ionized gas\nilluminated by the bright central quasar, we deduce an average volume density\nof $n_{\\rm H}=0.6\\times10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ on these large scales. Our results\nare in broad agreement with the densities suggested by cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of massive ($M\\simeq10^{12.5}M_\\odot$) quasar hosts,\nhowever they indicate that the typical quasars at these redshifts are\nsurrounded by gas that is a factor of ~100 times less dense than the (~1\ncm$^{-3}$) gas responsible for the giant bright Ly$\\alpha$ nebulae around\nquasars recently discovered by our group.\n", "  We present a rigorous microscopic theory of the extrinsic spin Hall effect in\ndisordered graphene based on a nonperturbative quantum diagrammatic treatment\nincorporating skew scattering and anomalous---impurity\nconcentration-independent---quantum corrections on equal footing. The leading\nskew scattering contribution to the spin Hall conductivity is shown to\nquantitatively agree with Boltzmann transport theory over a wide range of\nparameters. Our self-consistent approach---where all topologically equivalent\nnoncrossing diagrams are resummed---unveils that the skewness generated by\nspin--orbit-active impurities deeply influences the anomalous component of the\nspin Hall conductivity, even in the weak scattering regime. This seemingly\ncounterintuitive result is explained by the rich sublattice structure of\nscattering potentials in graphene, for which traditional Gaussian disorder\napproximations fail to capture the intricate correlations between skew\nscattering and side jumps generated through diffusion. Finally, we assess the\nrole of quantum interference corrections by evaluating an important subclass of\ncrossing diagrams recently considered in the context of the anomalous Hall\neffect, the $X$ and $\\Psi$ diagrams [Ado et al., EPL 111, 37004 (2015)]. We\nshow that $\\Psi$ diagrams---encoding quantum coherent skew scattering---display\na strong Fermi energy dependence, dominating the anomalous spin Hall component\naway from the Dirac point. Our findings have direct implications for nonlocal\ntransport experiments in spin--orbit-coupled graphene systems.\n", "  We investigate the scaling of the cross-correlations calculated for\ntwo-variable time series containing vertex properties in the context of complex\nnetworks. Time series of such observables are obtained by means of stationary,\nunbiased random walks. We consider three vertex properties that provide,\nrespectively, short, medium, and long-range information regarding the\ntopological role of vertices in a given network. In order to reveal the\nrelation between these quantities, we applied the multifractal\ncross-correlation analysis technique, which provides information about the\nnonlinear effects in coupling of time series. We show that the considered\nnetwork models are characterized by unique multifractal properties of the\ncross-correlation. In particular, it is possible to distinguish between\nErd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi, Barab\\'{a}si-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz networks on the\nbasis of fractal cross-correlation. Moreover, the analysis of protein contact\nnetworks reveals characteristics shared with both scale-free and small-world\nmodels.\n", "  The millimeter transient sky is largely unexplored, with measurements limited\nto follow-up of objects detected at other wavelengths. High-angular-resolution\ntelescopes designed for measurement of the cosmic microwave background offer\nthe possibility to discover new, unknown transient sources in this band,\nparticularly the afterglows of unobserved gamma-ray bursts. Here we use the\n10-meter millimeter-wave South Pole Telescope, designed for the primary purpose\nof observing the cosmic microwave background at arcminute and larger angular\nscales, to conduct a search for such objects. During the 2012-2013 season, the\ntelescope was used to continuously observe a 100 square degree patch of sky\ncentered at RA 23h30m and declination -55 degrees using the\npolarization-sensitive SPTpol camera in two bands centered at 95 and 150 GHz.\nThese 6000 hours of observations provided continuous monitoring for day- to\nmonth-scale millimeter-wave transient sources at the 10 mJy level. One\ncandidate object was observed with properties broadly consistent with a\ngamma-ray burst afterglow, but at a statistical significance too low (p=0.01)\nto confirm detection.\n", "  We apply the subordination principle to construct kinetic fractional\nstatistical dynamics in the continuum in terms of solutions to Vlasov-type\nhierarchies. As a by-product we obtain the evolution of the density of\nparticles in the fractional kinetics in terms of a non-linear Vlasov-type\nkinetic equation. As an application we study the intermittency of the\nfractional mesoscopic dynamics.\n", "  We study the spin-resolved spectral properties of the impurity states\nassociated to the presence of magnetic impurities in two-dimensional, as well\nas one-dimensional systems with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We focus on Shiba\nbound states in superconducting materials, as well as on impurity states in\nmetallic systems. Using a combination of a numerical T-matrix approximation and\na direct analytical calculation of the bound state wave function, we compute\nthe local density of states (LDOS) together with its Fourier transform (FT). We\nfind that the FT of the spin-polarized LDOS, a quantity accessible via\nspin-polarized STM, allows to accurately extract the strength of the spin-orbit\ncoupling. Also we confirm that the presence of magnetic impurities is strictly\nnecessary for such measurement, and that non-spin-polarized experiments cannot\nhave access to the value of the spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Observation shows that nebular emission, molecular gas, and young stars in\ngiant galaxies are associated with rising X-ray bubbles inflated by radio jets\nlaunched from nuclear black holes. We propose a model where molecular clouds\ncondense from low entropy gas caught in the updraft of rising X-ray bubbles.\nThe low entropy gas becomes thermally unstable when it is lifted to an altitude\nwhere its cooling time is shorter than the time required to fall to its\nequilibrium location in the galaxy i.e., t_c/t_I < 1. The infall speed of a\ncloud is bounded by the lesser of its free-fall and terminal speeds, so that\nthe infall time here can exceed the the free-fall time by a significant factor.\nThis mechanism is motivated by ALMA observations revealing molecular clouds\nlying in the wakes of rising X-ray bubbles with velocities well below their\nfree-fall speeds. Our mechanism would provide cold gas needed to fuel a\nfeedback loop while stabilizing the atmosphere on larger scales. The observed\ncooling time threshold of ~ 5x 10^8 yr --- the clear-cut signature of thermal\ninstability and the onset of nebular emission and star formation--- may result\nfrom the limited ability of radio bubbles to lift low entropy gas to altitudes\nwhere thermal instabilities can ensue. Outflowing molecular clouds are unlikely\nto escape, but instead return to the central galaxy in a circulating flow. We\ncontrast our mechanism to precipitation models where the minimum value of\nt_c/t_ff < 10 triggers thermal instability, which we find to be inconsistent\nwith observation.\n", "  Spontaneously broken supersymmetry (SUSY) and a vanishingly small\ncosmological constant imply that R symmetry must be spontaneously broken at low\nenergies. Based on this observation, we suppose that, in the sector responsible\nfor low-energy R symmetry breaking, a discrete R symmetry remains preserved at\nhigh energies and only becomes dynamically broken at relatively late times in\nthe cosmological evolution, i.e., after the dynamical breaking of SUSY. Prior\nto R symmetry breaking, the Universe is then bound to be in a quasi-de Sitter\nphase---which offers a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic\ninflation. This scenario yields a new perspective on the interplay between SUSY\nbreaking and inflation, which neatly fits into the paradigm of high-scale SUSY:\ninflation is driven by the SUSY-breaking vacuum energy density, while the\nchiral field responsible for SUSY breaking, the Polonyi field, serves as the\ninflaton. Because R symmetry is broken only after inflation, slow-roll\ninflation is not spoiled by otherwise dangerous gravitational corrections in\nsupergravity. We illustrate our idea by means of a concrete example, in which\nboth SUSY and R symmetry are broken by strong gauge dynamics and in which\nlate-time R symmetry breaking is triggered by a small inflaton field value. In\nthis model, the scales of inflation and SUSY breaking are unified; the\ninflationary predictions are similar to those of F-term hybrid inflation in\nsupergravity; reheating proceeds via gravitino decay at temperatures consistent\nwith thermal leptogenesis; and the sparticle mass spectrum follows from pure\ngravity mediation. Dark matter consists of thermally produced winos with a mass\nin the TeV range.\n", "  While the origin of temporal correlations in Langevin dynamics have been\nthoroughly researched, the understanding of Spatially Correlated Noise (SCN) is\nrather incomplete. In particular, very little is known about the relation\nbetween friction and SCN. In this article, we derive the formal formula for the\nspatial correlation function in the particle-bath interactions. This expression\nshows that SCN is the inherent component of binary mixtures, originating from\nthe effective (entropic) interactions. Further, employing this spatial\ncorrelation function, we postulate the thermodynamically consistent Langevin\nequation driven by SCN and the adequate Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation. The\nthermodynamical consistency is achieved by introducing the spatially variant\nfriction coefficient, which can be also derived analytically. This coefficient\nexhibits a number of intriguing properties, e.g. the singular behavior for\ncertain interaction types. Eventually, we apply this new theory to the system\nof two charged particles in the presence of counter-ions. Such particles\ninteract via the screened-charge Yukawa potential and the inclusion of SCN\nleads to the emergence of the anomalous frictionless regime. In this regime the\nparticles can experience active propulsion leading to the transient attraction\neffect. This effect suggests a non-equilibrium mechanism facilitating the\nmolecular binding of the like-charged particles.\n", "  We observed the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b (also known as HAT-P-32Ab) to determine\nits optical transmission spectrum by measuring the wavelength-dependent\nplanet-to-star radius ratios in the region between 518 - 918 nm. We used the\nOSIRIS instrument at the GTC in long slit spectroscopy mode, placing HAT-P-32\nand a reference star in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra\ncovering two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were able to\nyield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm\nwide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve\nmodeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and\n972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a\nhigh altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a\nstrong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary\natmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric\nfeatures. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a\nprevious ground-based study of the optical spectrum of this planet. This\nagreement between independent results demonstrates that ground-based\nmeasurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible\nresults despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic\nnoise, as long as the noise source is well understood and properly corrected.\nWe also extract an optical spectrum of the M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B. Using\nPHOENIX stellar atmosphere models we determine an effective temperature of\n$T_\\mathrm{eff}= 3187^{+60}_{-71}$ K, slightly colder than previous studies\nrelying only on broadband infra-red data.\n", "  The Kondo-Heisenberg model is used for a microscopic demonstration of\nexistence of a peculiar metallic state with unbroken translational symmetry\nwhere the Fermi surface volume is not controlled by the total electron density.\nI use a non-perturbative approach where the strongest interactions are taken\ninto account by means of exact solution, and corrections are controllable. In\nagreement with the general requirements formulated in (T. Senthil {\\it et.al.}\nPhys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 90}, 216403 (2003)), the resulting metallic state\nrepresents a fractionalized Fermi liquid where well defined quasiparticles\ncoexist with gapped fractionalized collective excitations. The system undergoes\na phase transition to an ordered phase (charge density wave or\nsuperconducting), at the transition temperature which is parametrically small\nin comparison to the quasiparticle Fermi energy.\n", "  We explore identical R\\\"ossler systems organized into two equally-sized\ngroups, among which differing positive and negative in- and out-coupling\nstrengths are allowed. Patterns of distinctly synchronized phase dynamics are\nobserved, which coexist with chaotically evolving amplitudes. In particular, we\nreport the emergence of traveling phase waves, i.e. states in which the\noscillators settle on a new rhythm different from their own. We further\nelucidate our findings through phase-coupled R\\\"ossler systems, establishing a\nconnection with the Kuramoto model. Together with the study of noise effects,\nour results suggest a promising new avenue towards the coexistence of chaotic,\nnoisy and regular collective dynamics.\n", "  We have analyzed multi-wavelength observations and magnetic-field data for\nthe solar flare of May 10, 2012 (04:18 UT) and have detected a sign inversion\nof the signal in the line-of-sight magnetic measurements in the umbra of a\nsmall spot. This effect is associated, at least partly, with the emergence of a\nnew magnetic field. Almost at the same time, a burst of hard X-rays was\nrecorded, and a wave in the vacuum ultraviolet (EUV) range (a \"sunquake\") was\ngenerated due to the impact of the disturbance in the energy release range on\nthe photosphere. At the beginning of the event, a sigmoid flare was recorded,\nbut it did not spread, as it usually does, along the polarity inversion\n(neutral) line. SDO/HMI full-vector measurements were used to extrapolate the\nAR 11476 magnetic field to the corona, and the distribution of vertical\ncurrents $j_z$ in the photosphere was obtained. The distribution of currents in\nthe active region shows that the relationship between them and the occurrence\nof flares is very intricate. We have corroborated that the expected \"ideal\"\nbehavior of the current system before and after the flare (e.g., see (Sharykin\nand Kosovichev, 2015)) is observed only in the sigmoid region. The results\nobtained were compared with the observations of two other flares recorded in\nthis AR on the same day, one of which was similar to the flare under discussion\nand the other was of different type. Our results confirm that the formation and\neruption of large-scale magnetic flux ropes in sigmoid flares are associated\nwith the shear motions in the photosphere and the emergence of twisted magnetic\ntubes, as well as with the subsequent development of the torus instability.\n", "  We propose a model independent extraction of the hadronic information needed\nto determine the photon polarization of the b-> s gamma process by the method\nutilizing the B -> K1 gamma -> K pi pi gamma angular distribution. We show that\nexactly the same hadronic information can be obtained by using the B -> J/psi\nK1 -> J/psi K pi pi channel, which leads to a much higher precision.\n", "  Two types of spontaneous breaking of the space translational symmetry in\ndistributed chaos have been considered for turbulent thermal convection at\nlarge values of Rayleigh number. First type is related to boundaries and second\ntype is related to appearance of inertial range of scales. The first type is\ndominated by vorticity correlation integral: $\\int_{V} \\langle {\\boldsymbol\n\\omega} ({\\bf x},t) \\cdot {\\boldsymbol \\omega} ({\\bf x} + {\\bf r},t)\n\\rangle_{V} d{\\bf r}$ and is characterized by stretched exponential spectrum\n$\\exp-(k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta }$ with $\\beta =1/2$. The second type is dominated\nby energy correlation integral: $\\int_{V} \\langle {\\bf u}^2 ({\\bf x},t) ~ {\\bf\nu}^2({\\bf x} + {\\bf r},t) \\rangle_{V} d{\\bf r}$ and is characterized by $\\beta\n=3/5$. Good agreement has been established with laboratory experimental data\nobtained at large values of Rayleigh number $Ra \\sim 10^{11}-10^{14}$ (the\nrange relevant to solar photosphere) in upright cylinder cells. Taylor\nhypothesis transforms the wavenumber spectrum into frequency spectrum\n$\\exp-(f/f_{\\beta})^{1/2}$. It is shown that turnover frequency of large-scale\ncirculation (wind): $f_w = f_{\\beta}/2$. Results of an experiment in horizontal\ncylinder are also briefly discussed. The analysis suggests that in this case\nthe large-scale circulation can be considered as a natural (harmonic) part of\nthe distributed chaos.\n", "  In a companion paper, we have presented the combined\nasteroseismic-spectroscopic dataset obtained from CoRoT lightcurves and APOGEE\ninfra-red spectra for 678 solar-like oscillating red giants in two fields of\nthe Galactic disc (CoRoGEE). We have measured chemical abundance patterns,\ndistances, and ages of these field stars which are spread over a large radial\nrange of the Milky Way's disc. Here we show how to simulate this dataset using\na chemodynamical Galaxy model. We also demonstrate how the observation\nprocedure influences the accuracy of our estimated ages.\n", "  We investigate a paradigmatic model for quantum transport with both\nnearest-neighbor and infinite range hopping coupling (independent of the\nposition). Due to long range homogeneous hopping, a gap between the ground\nstate and the excited states can be induced, which is mathematically equivalent\nto the superconducting gap. In the gapped regime, the dynamics within the\nexcited states subspace is shielded from long range hopping, namely it occurs\nas if long range hopping would be absent. This is a cooperative phenomenon\nsince shielding is effective over a time scale which diverges with the system\nsize. We named this effect {\\it Cooperative Shielding}. We also discuss the\nconsequences of our findings on Anderson localization. Long range hopping is\nusually thought to destroy localization due to the fact that it induces an\ninfinite number of resonances. Contrary to this common lore we show that the\nexcited states display strong localized features when shielding is effective\neven in the regime of strong long range coupling. A brief discussion on the\nextension of our results to generic power-law decaying long range hopping is\nalso given. Our preliminary results confirms that the effects found for the\ninfinite range case are generic.\n", "  We discuss a possible extension of calculations of the bending angle of light\nin a static, spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime to a\nnon-asymptotically flat case. We examine a relation between the bending angle\nof light and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem by using the optical metric. A\ncorrespondence between the deflection angle of light and the surface integral\nof the Gaussian curvature may allow us to take account of the finite distance\nfrom a lens object to a light source and a receiver. Using this relation, we\npropose a method for calculating the bending angle of light for such cases.\nFinally, this method is applied to two examples of the non-asymptotically flat\nspacetimes to suggest finite-distance corrections: Kottler (Schwarzschild-de\nSitter) solution to the Einstein equation and an exact solution in Weyl\nconformal gravity.\n", "  The one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), where $N$\nhard-core particles hop forward with rate $1$ and backward with rate $q<1$, is\nconsidered on a periodic lattice of $L$ site. Using KPZ universality and\nprevious results for the totally asymmetric model $q=0$, precise conjectures\nare formulated for asymptotics at finite density $\\rho=N/L$ of ASEP eigenstates\nclose to the stationary state. The conjectures are checked with high precision\nusing extrapolation methods on finite size Bethe ansatz numerics. For weak\nasymmetry $1-q\\sim1/\\sqrt{L}$, double extrapolation combined with an integer\nrelation algorithm gives an exact expression for the spectral gap up to $10$-th\norder in the asymmetry.\n", "  The cross section for pair production of top quarks (t-tbar) with high\ntransverse momenta is measured in pp collisions, collected with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC with sqrt(s) = 8 TeV in data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The measurement is performed using\nlepton+jets events, where one top quark decays semileptonically, while the\nsecond top quark decays to a hadronic final state. The hadronic decay is\nreconstructed as a single, large-radius jet, and identified as a top quark\ncandidate using jet substructure techniques. The integrated cross section and\nthe differential cross sections as a function of top quark pt and rapidity are\nmeasured at particle level within a fiducial region related to the\ndetector-level requirements and at parton level. The particle-level integrated\ncross section is found to be sigma[t-tbar] = 0.499 +/- 0.035 (stat+syst) +/-\n0.095 (theory) +/- 0.013 (lumi) pb for top quark pt > 400 GeV. The parton-level\nmeasurement is sigma[t-tbar] = 1.44 +/- 0.10 (stat+syst) +/- 0.29 (theory) +/-\n0.04 (lumi) pb. The integrated and differential cross section results are\ncompared to predictions from several event generators.\n", "  III Zw 2 is the prototype of radio-intermediate quasars. Although there is\nthe evidence of possessing strong jet, significant $\\gamma$-ray emission has\nnot been reported before. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of the\nlatest {\\it Fermi}-LAT {\\it Pass} 8 data. No significant $\\gamma$-ray signal\nhas been detected in the time-averaged 7-year {\\it Fermi}-LAT data of III Zw 2,\nwe however have identified two distinct $\\gamma$-ray flares with isotropic\nluminosities of $\\sim 10^{45}$ erg $\\rm s^{-1}$. Multiwavelength data analysis\n(including also the optical photometric observations from Yunnan Observatories)\nare presented and the main finding is the simultaneous optical and $\\gamma$-ray\nflares of III Zw 2 appearing in Nov. 2009. Violent $\\gamma$-ray variability\nwith doubling timescale of 2.5 hours was detected in another $\\gamma$-ray flare\nin May 2010, for which the 3-hour $\\gamma$-ray peak flux is $\\sim 250$ times of\nthe average flux in 7 years. Rather similar behaviors are observed in blazars\nand the blazar model can reasonably reproduce the spectral energy distribution\nof III Zw 2 in a wide energy range, strongly suggesting that its central engine\nresembles that of blazars. In view of its core which shares radio similarities\nwith young radio sources together with the weak extended radio lobe emission,\nwe suggest that III Zw 2 harbors a recurrent activity core and serves as a\nvaluable target for investigating the fuelling and triggering of the activity\nin radio loud AGNs.\n", "  We address electrodynamic effects in plasma oscillations of a lossy 2D\nelectron system whose dc 2D conductivity is comparable to the speed of light.\nWe argue that the perpendicular constant magnetic field B causes astonishing\nfeatures of magnetoplasma dynamics. We show that plasmon-polariton spectra can\nbe classified using a 'relativistic' phase diagram 2D conductivity divided by\nthe speed of light versus B. An extraordinarily low damping branch in\nmagnetoplasmon-polariton spectra emerges at two phases of this diagram. Some\nmagnetoplasmons at these phases are predicted to be undamped waves.\n", "  Context: Bolometers are high sensitivity detector commonly used in Infrared\nastronomy. The HFI instrument of the Planck satellite makes extensive use of\nthem, but after the satellite launch two electronic related problems revealed\ncritical. First an unexpected excess response of detectors at low optical\nexcitation frequency for {\\nu} < 1 Hz, and secondly the Analog To digital\nConverter (ADC) component had been insufficiently characterized on-ground.\nThese two problems require an exquisite knowledge of detector response. However\nbolometers have highly nonlinear characteristics, coming from their electrical\nand thermal coupling making them very difficult to modelize.\n  Goal: We present a method to build the analytical transfer function in\nfrequency domain which describe the voltage response of an Alternative Current\n(AC) biased bolometer to optical excitation, based on the standard bolometer\nmodel. This model is built using the setup of the Planck/HFI instrument and\noffers the major improvement of being based on a physical model rather than the\ncurrently in use had-hoc model based on Direct Current (DC) bolometer theory.\n  Method: The analytical transfer function expression will be presented in\nmatrix form. For this purpose, we build linearized versions of the bolometer\nelectro thermal equilibrium. And a custom description of signals in frequency\nis used to solve the problem with linear algebra. The model performances is\nvalidated using time domain simulations.\n  Results: The provided expression is suitable for calibration and data\nprocess- ing. It can also be used to provide constraints for fitting optical\ntransfer function using real data from steady state electronic response and\noptical response. The accurate description of electronic response can also be\nused to improve the ADC nonlinearity correction for quickly varying optical\nsignals.\n", "  Many properties of the Milky Way's dark matter halo, including its mass\nassembly history, concentration, and subhalo population, remain poorly\nconstrained. We explore the connection between these properties of the Milky\nWay and its satellite galaxy population, especially the implication of the\npresence of the Magellanic Clouds for the properties of the Milky Way halo.\nUsing a suite of high-resolution $N$-body simulations of Milky Way-mass halos\nwith a fixed final Mvir ~ 10^{12.1}Msun, we find that the presence of\nMagellanic Cloud-like satellites strongly correlates with the assembly history,\nconcentration, and subhalo population of the host halo, such that Milky\nWay-mass systems with Magellanic Clouds have lower concentration, more rapid\nrecent accretion, and more massive subhalos than typical halos of the same\nmass. Using a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model that is tuned to\nreproduce the stellar mass function of the classical dwarf galaxies of the\nMilky Way with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we show that adopting host halos with\ndifferent mass-assembly histories and concentrations can lead to different\nbest-fit models for galaxy-formation physics, especially for the strength of\nfeedback. These biases arise because the presence of the Magellanic Clouds\nboosts the overall population of high-mass subhalos, thus requiring a different\nstellar-mass-to-halo-mass ratio to match the data. These biases also lead to\nsignificant differences in the mass--metallicity relation, the kinematics of\nlow-mass satellites, the number counts of small satellites associated with the\nMagellanic Clouds, and the stellar mass of Milky Way itself. Observations of\nthese galaxy properties can thus provide useful constraints on the properties\nof the Milky Way halo.\n", "  It is shown that low-collisionality plasmas cannot support linearly polarized\nshear-Alfv\\'en fluctuations above a critical amplitude $\\delta B_{\\perp}/B_{0}\n\\sim \\beta^{\\,-1/2}$, where $\\beta$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic\npressure. Above this cutoff, a developing fluctuation will generate a pressure\nanisotropy that is sufficient to destabilize itself through the parallel\nfirehose instability. This causes the wave frequency to approach zero,\ninterrupting the fluctuation before any oscillation. The magnetic field lines\nrapidly relax into a sequence of angular zig-zag structures. Such a restrictive\nbound on shear-Alfv\\'en-wave amplitudes has far-reaching implications for the\nphysics of magnetized turbulence in the high-$\\beta$ conditions prevalent in\nmany astrophysical plasmas, as well as for the solar wind at $\\sim 1\n\\mathrm{AU}$ where $\\beta \\gtrsim 1$.\n", "  We compare the diversity of spectral line velocities in a large sample of\ntype IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) with the expected asphericity in the explosion,\nas measured from the light echoes of Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which was a\nhistorical galactic SN IIb. We revisit the results of Rest et al. (2011a), who\nused light echoes to observe Cas A from multiple lines of sight and hence\ndetermine its asphericity, as seen in the velocity of three spectral lines (He\nI $\\lambda$5876, H$\\alpha$ and the Ca II NIR triplet). We confirm and improve\non this measurement by reproducing the effect of the light echoes in the\nspectra of several extragalactic SNe IIb found in the literature as well as\nmean SN IIb spectra recently created by Liu et al. (2016), and comparing these\nto the observed light echo spectra of Cas A, including their associated\nuncertainties. In order to quantify the accuracy of this comparison we smooth\nthe light echo spectra of Cas A using Gaussian processes and use a Monte Carlo\nmethod to measure the absorption velocities of these three features in the\nspectra. We then test the hypothesis that the diversity of ejecta velocities\nseen in SNe IIb can be explained by asphericity. We do this by comparing the\nrange of velocities seen in the different light echoes, and hence different\nlines of sight, of Cas A to that seen in the population of SNe IIb. We conclude\nthat these two ranges are of the same order and thus asphericity could be\nenough to explain the diversity in the expansion velocity alone.\n", "  The shear-driven drainage of capillary grooves filled with viscous liquid is\na dynamic wetting phenomenon relevant to numerous industrial processes and\nnovel lubricant-infused surfaces. Prior work has reported that a finite length\n$L_\\infty$ of the capillary groove can remain indefinitely filled with liquid\neven when large shear stresses are applied. The mechanism preventing full\ndrainage is attributed to a balance between the shear-driven flow and a\ncounterflow driven by capillary pressures caused by deformation of the free\nsurface. The final equilibrium length $L_\\infty$ is uniquely determined by\nphysical properties of the filling liquid as well as the geometry and\nwettability of the capillary. In this work, we examine closely the approach to\nthe final equilibrium length $L_\\infty$ and report a crossover to a slow\ndrainage regime that cannot be described by conventional dynamic models\nconsidering solely hydrodynamic and capillary forces. The slow drainage regime\nobserved in experiments can be instead modeled by a kinetic equation describing\na sequence of random thermally activated transitions between multiple\nmetastable states caused by surface defects with nanoscale dimensions. Our\nfindings provide new insights on the critical role that natural or engineered\nsurface roughness with nanoscale dimensions can play in the imbibition and\ndrainage of capillaries and other dynamic wetting processes in microscale\nsystems.\n", "  We present three-dimensional simulations with nested meshes of the dynamics\nof the gas around a Jupiter mass planet with the JUPITER and FARGOCA codes. We\nimplemented a radiative transfer module into the JUPITER code to account for\nrealistic heating and cooling of the gas. We focus on the circumplanetary gas\nflow, determining its characteristics at very high resolution ($80\\%$ of\nJupiter's diameter). In our nominal simulation where the temperature evolves\nfreely by the radiative module and reaches 13000 K at the planet, a\ncircumplanetary envelope was formed filling the entire Roche-lobe. Because of\nour equation of state is simplified and probably overestimates the temperature,\nwe also performed simulations with limited maximal temperatures in the planet\nregion (1000 K, 1500 K, and 2000 K). In these fixed temperature cases\ncircumplanetary disks (CPDs) were formed. This suggests that the capability to\nform a circumplanetary disk is not simply linked to the mass of the planet and\nits ability to open a gap. Instead, the gas temperature at the planet's\nlocation, which depends on its accretion history, plays also fundamental role.\nThe CPDs in the simulations are hot and cooling very slowly, they have very\nsteep temperature and density profiles, and are strongly sub-Keplerian.\nMoreover, the CPDs are fed by a strong vertical influx, which shocks on the CPD\nsurfaces creating a hot and luminous shock-front. In contrast, the pressure\nsupported circumplanetary envelope is characterized by internal convection and\nalmost stalled rotation.\n", "  We construct $F(T,\\left(\\nabla{T}\\right)^2,\\Box {T})$ gravitational\nmodifications, which are novel classes of modified theories arising from\nhigher-derivative torsional terms in the action, and are different than their\ncurvature analogue. Applying them in a cosmological framework we obtain an\neffective dark energy sector that comprises of the novel torsional\ncontributions. We perform a detailed dynamical analysis for two specific\nexamples, extracting the stable late-time solutions and calculating the\ncorresponding observables. We show that the thermal history of the universe can\nbe reproduced, and it can result in a dark-energy dominated, accelerating\nuniverse, where the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter lies in the\nquintessence regime, or may exhibit the phantom-divide crossing during the\ncosmological evolution. Finally, the scale factor behaves asymptotically either\nas a power-law or as an exponential, in agreement with observations.\n", "  The ultimate goal of quantum information science is to build a global quantum\nnetwork, which enables quantum resources to be distributed and shared between\nremote parties. Such quantum network can be realized by all fiber elements,\nwhich takes advantage of low transmission loss,low cost, scalable and mutual\nfiber communication techniques such as dense wavelength division multiplexing.\nTherefore high quality entangled photon sources based on fibers are on\ndemanding for building up such kind of quantum network. Here we report\nmultiplexed polarization and timebin entanglement photon sources based on\ndispersion shifted fiber operating at room temperature. High qualities of\nentanglement are characterized by using interference, Bell inequality and\nquantum state tomography. Simultaneous presence of entanglements in\nmultichannel pairs of a 100GHz DWDM shows the great capacity for entanglements\ndistribution over multi-users. Our research provides a versatile platform and\nmoves a first step toward constructing an all fiber quantum network.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies form a sequence in the [OIII]/H-beta vs. [NII]/H-alpha\ndiagnostic diagram, with low metallicity, highly ionized galaxies falling in\nthe upper left corner. Drawing from a large sample of UV-selected star-forming\ngalaxies at z~2 with rest-frame optical nebular emission line measurements from\nKeck-MOSFIRE, we select the extreme ~5% of the galaxies lying in this upper\nleft corner, requiring log([NII]/H-alpha) <= 1.1 and log([OIII]/H-beta) >=\n0.75. These cuts identify galaxies with 12 + log(O/H) <~ 8.0, when oxygen\nabundances are measured via the O3N2 diagnostic. We study the Ly-alpha\nproperties of the resulting sample of 14 galaxies. The mean (median) rest-frame\nLy-alpha equivalent width is 39 (36) A, and 11 of the 14 objects (79%) are\nLy-alpha-emitters (LAEs) with W_Lya > 20 A. We compare the equivalent width\ndistribution of a sample of 522 UV-selected galaxies at 2.0<z<2.6 identified\nwithout regard to their optical line ratios; this sample has mean (median)\nLy-alpha equivalent width -1 (-4) A, and only 9% of these galaxies qualify as\nLAEs. The extreme galaxies typically have lower attenuation at Ly-alpha than\nthose in the comparison sample, and have ~50% lower median oxygen abundances.\nBoth factors are likely to facilitate the escape of Ly-alpha: in less dusty\ngalaxies Ly-alpha photons are less likely to be absorbed during multiple\nscatterings, while the harder ionizing spectrum and higher ionization parameter\nassociated with strong, low metallicity star formation may reduce the covering\nfraction or column density of neutral hydrogen, further easing Ly-alpha escape.\nThe use of nebular emission line ratios may prove useful in the identification\nof galaxies with low opacity to Ly-alpha photons across a range of redshifts.\n", "  Motivated by a recent optical-lattice experiment by Choi et al.[Science 352,\n1547 (2016)], we discuss how domain-wall melting can be used to investigate\nmany-body localization. First, by considering noninteracting fermion models, we\ndemonstrate that experimentally accessible measures are sensitive to\nlocalization and can thus be used to detect the delocalization-localization\ntransition, including divergences of characteristic length scales. Second,\nusing extensive time-dependent density matrix renormalization group\nsimulations, we study fermions with repulsive interactions on a chain and a\ntwo-leg ladder. The extracted critical disorder strengths agree well with the\nones found in existing literature.\n", "  We present precise measurements of the optical Feshbach resonances (OFRs) of\n$^{174}$Yb atoms for the intercombination transition. We measure the\nphotoassociation (PA) spectra of a pure $^{174}$Yb Bose-Einstein condensate,\nand determine the dependence of OFRs to PA laser intensities and frequencies\nfor four least bound vibrational levels near the intercombination transition.\nWe confirm that our measurements are consistent with the temporal decay of a\nBEC subjected to a PA beam in the vicinity of the fourth vibrational level from\nthe dissociation limit.\n", "  Using the well-known Kubo formula, we evaluate magnetotransport quantities\nlike the collisional and Hall conductivities of the $\\alpha$-T$_3$ model. The\ncollisional conductivity exhibits a series of peaks at strong magnetic field.\nEach of the conductivity peaks for $\\alpha=0$ (graphene) splits into two in\npresence of a finite $\\alpha$. This splitting occurs due to a finite phase\ndifference between the contributions coming from the two valleys. The density\nof states is also calculated to explore the origin of the splitting of\nconductivity peaks. As $\\alpha$ approaches $1$, the right split part of the\nconductivity peak comes closer to the left split part of the next conductivity\npeak. At $\\alpha=1$, they merge with each other to produce a new series of the\nconductivity peaks. On the other hand, the Hall conductivity undergoes a smooth\ntransition from $\\sigma_{yx}=2(2n+1)e^2/h$ to $\\sigma_{yx}=4ne^2/h$ with\n$n=0,1,2,...$ as we tune $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $1$. For intermediate $\\alpha$,\nwe obtain the Hall plateaus at values $0,2,4,6,8,...$ in units of $e^2/h$.\n", "  Exact analytical expressions for the cross-section correlation functions of\nchaotic scattering sys- tems have hitherto been derived only under special\nconditions. The objective of the present article is to provide expressions that\nare applicable beyond these restrictions. The derivation is based on a\nstatistical model of Breit-Wigner type for chaotic scattering amplitudes which\nhas been shown to describe the exact analytical results for the scattering\n(S)-matrix correlation functions accurately. Our results are given in the\nenergy and in the time representations and apply in the whole range from\nisolated to overlapping resonances. The S-matrix contributions to the\ncross-section correla- tions are obtained in terms of explicit irreducible and\nreducible correlation functions. Consequently, the model can be used for a\ndetailed exploration of the key features of the cross-section correlations and\nthe underlying physical mechanisms. In the region of isolated resonances, the\ncross-section correlations contain a dominant contribution from the\nself-correlation term. For narrow states the self-correlations originate\npredominantly from widely spaced states with exceptionally large partial width.\nIn the asymptotic region of well-overlapping resonances, the cross-section\nautocorrelation functions are given in terms of the S-matrix autocorrelation\nfunctions. For inelastic correlations, in particular, the Ericson fluctuations\nrapidly dominate in that region. Agreement with known analytical and with\nexperimental results is excellent.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the Weyl quasiparticles emerged in an optical\nlattice where the topological Weyl semimental and trivial band insulator phases\ncan be adjusted with the on-site energy. The evolution of the density\ndistribution is demonstrated to have an anomalous velocity in Weyl semimental\nbut a steady Zitterbewegung effect in the band insulator. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the topological Chern number and the chirality of the system\ncan be directly determined from the positions of the atomic center-of-mass.\nFurthermore, the amplitude and the period of the relativistic Zitterbewegung\noscillations are shown to be observable with the time-of-flight experiments.\n", "  We use an anti-de Sitter/Quantum Chromodynamics (AdS/QCD) holographic\nlight-front wavefunction for the $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ mesons, in conjunction with\nthe Color Glass Condensate (CGC) dipole cross-section whose parameters are\nfitted to the most recent 2015 high precision HERA data on inclusive Deep\nInelastic Scattering (DIS), in order to predict the cross-sections for\ndiffractive $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ electroproduction. Our results suggest that the\nholographic meson light-front wavefunction is able to give a simultaneous\ndescription of the $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ production data provided we use a set of\nlight quark masses with $m_{u,d}$ < $m_{s}$ ~ 0.14 GeV.\n", "  We consider the problem of gambling on a quantum experiment and enforce\nrational behaviour by a few rules. These rules yield, in the classical case,\nthe Bayesian theory of probability via duality theorems. In our quantum\nsetting, they yield the Bayesian theory generalised to the space of Hermitian\nmatrices. This very theory is quantum mechanics: in fact, we derive all its\nfour postulates from the generalised Bayesian theory. This implies that quantum\nmechanics is self-consistent. It also leads us to reinterpret the main\noperations in quantum mechanics as probability rules: Bayes' rule\n(measurement), marginalisation (partial tracing), independence (tensor\nproduct). To say it with a slogan, we obtain that quantum mechanics is the\nBayesian theory in the complex numbers.\n", "  We consider the imprints of local massive defects, such as a black hole or a\nmassive monopole, during inflation. The massive defect breaks the background\nhomogeneity. We consider the limit that the physical Schwarzschild radius of\nthe defect is much smaller than the inflationary Hubble radius so a\nperturbative analysis is allowed. The inhomogeneities induced in scalar and\ngravitational wave power spectrum are calculated. We obtain the amplitudes of\ndipole, quadrupole and octupole anisotropies in curvature perturbation power\nspectrum and identify the relative configuration of the defect to CMB sphere in\nwhich large observable dipole asymmetry can be generated. We observe a curious\nreflection symmetry in which the configuration where the defect is inside the\nCMB comoving sphere has the same inhomogeneous variance as its mirror\nconfiguration where the defect is outside the CMB sphere.\n", "  Affleck, Kennedy, Lieb and Taski (AKLT) constructed an exemplary spin-3/2\nvalence-bond solid (VBS) state on the hexagonal lattice, which is the ground\nstate of an isotropic quantum antiferromagnet and possesses no spontaneous\nmagnetization but finite correlation length. This is distinct from the N\\'eel\nordered state of the spin-3/2 Heisenberg model on the same lattice. Niggemann,\nKl\\\"umper and Zittartz then generalized the AKLT Hamiltonian to one family\ninvariant under spin rotation about the z-axis. The ground states of this\nfamily can be parameterized by a single parameter that deforms the AKLT state,\nand this system exhibits a quantum phase transition between the VBS and N\\'eel\nphases, as the parameter increases from the AKLT point to large anisotropy. We\ninvestigate the opposite regime when the parameter decreases from the AKLT\npoint and find that there appears to be a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like\ntransition from the VBS phase to an XY phase. Such a transition also occurs in\nthe deformation of other types of AKLT states with triplet-bond constructions\non the same lattice. However, we do not find such an XY-like phase in the\ndeformed AKLT models on other trivalent lattices, such as square-octagon, cross\nand star lattices. On the star lattice, the deformed family of AKLT states\nremain in the same phase as the isotropic AKLT state throughout the whole\nregion of the parameter. However, for two triplet-bond generalizations, the\ntriplet VBS phase is sandwiched between two ferromagnetic phases (for large and\nsmall deformation parameters, respectively), which are characterized by\nspontaneous magnetizations along different axes. Along the way, we also discuss\nhow various deformed AKLT states can be used for the purpose of universal\nquantum computation.\n", "  Recent experiments have revealed the formation of stable droplets in dipolar\nBose-Einstein condensates. This surprising result has been explained by the\nstabilization given by quantum fluctuations. We study in detail the properties\nof a BEC in the presence of quantum stabilization. The ground-state phase\ndiagram presents three main regimes: mean-field regime, in which the quantum\ncorrection is perturbative, droplet regime, in which quantum stabilization is\ncrucial, and a multi-stable regime. In the absence of a multi-stable region,\nthe condensate undergoes a crossover from the mean-field to the droplet\nsolution marked by a characteristic growth of the peak density that may be\nemployed to clearly distinguish quantum stabilization from other stabilization\nmechanisms. Interestingly quantum stabilization allows for three-dimensionally\nself-bound condensates. We characterized these self-bound solutions, and\ndiscuss their realization in experiments. We conclude with a discussion of the\nlowest-lying excitations both for trapped condensates, and for self-bound\nsolutions.\n", "  We report details of single crystal growth of stoichiometric bismuthide\nPtBi$_2$ whose structure consists of alternate stacking of Pt layer sandwiched\nby Bi bilayer along the $c$-axis. The compound crystallizes in space group P-3\nwith a hexagonal unit cell of $a$=$b$=6.553$\\AA$, $c$=6.165$\\AA$. The\nmagnetization data show opposite sign for fields parallel and perpendicular to\nthe Pt layers, respectively. The $T$-dependent resistivity is typical of a\nmetal and the magnetic response shows clear two types of charge carriers and\nthe validity of the semi-classical Kohler's rule. Its physical properties was\ndiscussed in comparison with recently proposed topological superconductor\n$\\beta$-PdBi$_2$.\n", "  High spatial resolution techniques have given valuable insights into the mass\nloss mechanism of AGB stars, which presumably involves a combination of\natmospheric levitation by pulsation-induced shock waves and radiation pressure\non dust. Observations indicate that Al$_2$O$_3$ condenses at distances of about\n2 stellar radii or less, prior to the formation of silicates. Al$_2$O$_3$\ngrains are therefore prime candidates for producing the scattered light\nobserved in the close vicinity of several M-type AGB stars, and they may be\nseed particles for the condensation of silicates at lower temperatures. We have\nconstructed a new generation of Dynamic Atmosphere & Radiation-driven Wind\nmodels based on Implicit Numerics (DARWIN), including a time-dependent\ntreatment of grain growth & evaporation for both Al$_2$O$_3$ and Fe-free\nsilicates (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$). The equations describing these dust species are\nsolved in the framework of a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical model\nfor the atmosphere & wind structure, taking pulsation-induced shock waves and\nperiodic luminosity variations into account. Condensation of Al$_2$O$_3$ at the\nclose distances and in the high concentrations implied by observations requires\nhigh transparency of the grains in the visual and near-IR region to avoid\ndestruction by radiative heating. For solar abundances, radiation pressure due\nto Al$_2$O$_3$ is too low to drive a wind. Nevertheless, this dust species may\nhave indirect effects on mass loss. The formation of composite grains with an\nAl$_2$O$_3$ core and a silicate mantle can give grain growth a head start,\nincreasing both mass loss rates and wind velocities. Furthermore, our\nexperimental core-mantle grain models lead to variations of visual and near-IR\ncolors during a pulsation cycle which are in excellent agreement with\nobservations.\n", "  A major hurdle in the simulation of the steady state of epidemic processes is\nthat the system will unavoidably visit an absorbing, disease-free state at\nsufficiently long times due to the finite size of the networks where epidemics\nevolves. In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS)\nsimulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the\nthermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the\nstandard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active\nconfigurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics\nreturns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where\nthe most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an\nabsorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and\nsusceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free\nnetworks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both\nmodels. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the\nmethods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub\nmutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized\nepidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the auto-correlation time as a\ntool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis\nprovides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation\ntime for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between\nRBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.\n", "  Young (125 Myr), populous ($>$1000 members), and relatively nearby, the\nPleiades has provided an anchor for stellar angular momentum models for both\nyounger and older stars. We used K2 to explore the distribution of rotation\nperiods in the Pleiades. With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members,\nwe are vastly expanding the number of Pleiads with periods, particularly at the\nlow mass end. About 92\\% of the members in our sample have at least one\nmeasured spot-modulated rotation period. For the $\\sim$8\\% of the members\nwithout periods, non-astrophysical effects often dominate (saturation, etc.),\nsuch that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being\nequal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in\nthe Pleiades. The relationship between $P$ and $(V-K_{\\rm s})_0$ follows the\noverall trends found in other Pleiades studies. There is a slowly rotating\nsequence for $1.1\\lesssim(V-K_{\\rm s})_0\\lesssim 3.7$, and a primarily rapidly\nrotating population for $(V-K_{\\rm s})_0\\gtrsim 5.0$. There is a region in\nwhich there seems to be a disorganized relationship between $P$ and $(V-K_{\\rm\ns})_0$ for $3.7 \\lesssim(V-K_{\\rm s})_0\\lesssim 5.0$. Paper II continues the\ndiscussion, focusing on multi-period structures, and Paper III speculates about\nthe origin and evolution of the period distribution in the Pleiades.\n", "  We use K2 to continue the exploration of the distribution of rotation periods\nin Pleiades that we began in Paper I. We have discovered complicated\nmulti-period behavior in Pleiades stars using these K2 data, and we have\ngrouped them into categories, which are the focal part of this paper. About 24%\nof the sample has multiple, real frequencies in the periodogram, sometimes\nmanifesting as obvious beating in the light curves. Those having complex and/or\nstructured periodogram peaks, unresolved multiple periods, and resolved close\nmultiple periods are likely due to spot/spot group evolution and/or latitudinal\ndifferential rotation; these largely compose the slowly rotating sequence in\n$P$ vs.~$(V-K_{\\rm s})_0$ identified in Paper I. The fast sequence in $P$\nvs.~$(V-K_{\\rm s})_0$ is dominated by single-period stars; these are likely to\nbe rotating as solid bodies. Paper III continues the discussion, speculating\nabout the origin and evolution of the period distribution in the Pleiades.\n", "  We use high quality K2 light curves for hundreds of stars in the Pleiades to\nunderstand better the angular momentum evolution and magnetic dynamos of young,\nlow mass stars. The K2 light curves provide not only rotational periods but\nalso detailed information from the shape of the phased light curve not\navailable in previous studies. A slowly rotating sequence begins at $(V-K_{\\rm\ns})_0\\sim$1.1 (spectral type F5) and ends at $(V-K_{\\rm s})_0\\sim$ 3.7\n(spectral type K8), with periods rising from $\\sim$2 to $\\sim$11 days in that\ninterval. Fifty-two percent of the Pleiades members in that color interval have\nperiods within 30\\% of a curve defining the slow sequence; the slowly rotating\nfraction decreases significantly redward of $(V-K_{\\rm s})_0$=2.6. Nearly all\nof the slow-sequence stars show light curves that evolve significantly on\ntimescales less than the K2 campaign duration. The majority of the FGK Pleiades\nmembers identified as photometric binaries are relatively rapidly rotating,\nperhaps because binarity inhibits star-disk angular momentum loss mechanisms\nduring pre-main sequence evolution. The fully convective, late M dwarf Pleiades\nmembers (5.0 $<(V-K_{\\rm s})_0<$ 6.0) nearly always show stable light curves,\nwith little spot evolution or evidence of differential rotation. During PMS\nevolution from $\\sim$3 Myr (NGC2264 age) to $\\sim$125 Myr (Pleiades age), stars\nof 0.3 $M_{\\odot}$ shed about half their angular momentum, with the fractional\nchange in period between 3 and 125 Myr being nearly independent of mass for\nfully convective stars. Our data also suggest that very low mass binaries form\nwith rotation periods more similar to each other and faster than would be true\nif drawn at random from the parent population of single stars.\n", "  We present a worldline method for the calculation of Casimir energies for\nscalar fields coupled to magnetodielectric media. The scalar model we consider\nmay be applied in arbitrary geometries, and it corresponds exactly to one\npolarization of the electromagnetic field in planar layered media. Starting\nfrom the field theory for electromagnetism, we work with the two decoupled\npolarizations in planar media and develop worldline path integrals, which\nrepresent the two polarizations separately, for computing both Casimir and\nCasimir-Polder potentials. We then show analytically that the path integrals\nfor the transverse-electric (TE) polarization coupled to a dielectric medium\nconverge to the proper solutions in certain special cases, including the\nCasimir-Polder potential of an atom near a planar interface, and the Casimir\nenergy due to two planar interfaces. We also evaluate the path integrals\nnumerically via Monte-Carlo path-averaging for these cases, studying the\nconvergence and performance of the resulting computational techniques. While\nthese scalar methods are only exact in particular geometries, they may serve as\nan approximation for Casimir energies for the vector electromagnetic field in\nother geometries.\n", "  We consider a scenario where the inflaton decays to a hidden sector thermally\ndecoupled from the visible Standard Model sector. A tiny portal coupling\nbetween the hidden and the visible sectors later heats the visible sector so\nthat the Standard Model degrees of freedom come to dominate the energy density\nof the Universe before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We find that this scenario is\nviable, although obtaining the correct dark matter abundance and retaining\nsuccessful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is not obvious. We also show that the\nisocurvature perturbations constituted by a primordial Higgs condensate are not\nproblematic for the viability of the scenario.\n", "  Most O and many B stars show unexplained cyclical variability in their\nspectral lines, i.e. modulation on the rotational timescale, but not strictly\nperiodic. The variability occurs in the so-called discrete absorption\ncomponents (DACs) that accelerate through the UV-wind line profiles and also in\nmany optical lines. For such OB stars no dipolar magnetic fields have been\ndetected with upper limits of ~300G. We investigate whether multiple magnetic\nloops on the surface rather than non-radial pulsations or a dipolar magnetic\nfield can explain the observed cyclical UV and optical spectral line\nvariability. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical spectroscopy of\nthe O6.5I(n)fp star lambda Cep. We apply a simplified phenomenological model in\nwhich multiple spherical blobs attached to the surface represent magnetic-loop\nstructures, which we call stellar prominences, by analogy with solar\nprominences. We compare the calculated line profiles as a function of\nrotational phase, adopting a rotation period of 4.1d, with observed relative\nchanges in subsequent quotient spectra. We identify many periodicities in\nspectral lines, almost none of which is stable over timescales from months to\nyears. We show that the relative changes in various optical absorption and\nemission lines are often very similar. Our proposed model applied to the HeII\n4686 line can typically be fitted with 2-5 equatorial blobs with lifetimes\nbetween ~1 and 24h. Given the irregular timescales involved, we propose that\nthe azimuthal distribution of DACs correspond to the locations of stellar\nprominences attached to the surface. This could explain the observed\nvariability of optical and UV lines, and put constraints on the strength and\nlifetime of these structures, which can be compared with recent theoretical\npredictions, in which bright magnetic surface spots are formed by the action of\nthe subsurface convection zone.\n", "  We employ first-principles techniques tailored to properly describe\nsemiconductors (modified Becke-Johnson potential added to the\nexchange-correlation functional), to obtain the electronic band structures of\nboth the zinc-blende and wurtzite phases of GaAs, GaSb, InAs, and InSb. We\nextract the spin-orbit fields for the relevant valence and conduction bands at\nzone center, by fitting the spin-splittings resulting from the lack of space\ninversion symmetry of these bulk crystal structures, to known functional\nforms---third-order polynomials. We also determine the orientations of the\nspin-orbit vector fields (for conduction bands) and the average spins (valence\nbands) in the momentum space. We describe the dependence of the spin-orbit\nparameters on the cation and anion atomic weights. These results should be\nuseful for spin transport, spin relaxation, and spin optical orientation\nmodeling of semiconductor heterostructures, as well as for realistic studies of\nsemiconductor-based Majorana nanowires, for which accurate values of spin-orbit\ncouplings are needed.\n", "  We theoretically study the linear transmission of linearly polarizedlight\npulses in an ensemble of cold atoms submitted to a static magneticfield\nparallel to the direction of propagation. The carrier frequencyof the incident\npulses coincides with a resonance frequency of theatoms. The transmitted light,\nthe electric field of which is transversal,is examined in the polarizations\nparallel and perpendicular to thatof the incident pulses. We give explicit\nanalytic expressions for thetransfer functions of the system for both\npolarizations and for thecorresponding group delays. We demonstrate that slow\nlight can beobserved in a polarization, whereas fast light is simultaneously\nobservedin the perpendicular polarization. Moreover, we point out that, dueto\nthe polarization post selection, the system is not necessarilyminimum phase\nshift. Slow light can then be obtained in situationswhere an irrelevant\napplication of the Kramers-Kronig relations could lead oneto expect fast light.\nWhen the incident light is step modulated, wefinally show that, in suitable\nconditions, the system enables oneto separate optical precursor and main field.\n", "  Near a quantum-critical point in a metal strong fermion-fermion interaction\nmediated by a soft collective boson gives rise to incoherent, non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior. It also often gives rise to superconductivity which masks the\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior. We analyze the interplay between superconductivity\nand fermionic incoherence for a set of quantum-critical models with effective\ndynamical interaction between low-energy fermions. We argue that\nsuperconductivity always develops above a quantum-critical point, no matter how\nstrong the fermionic self-energy is. We argue that superconductivity should not\nbe viewed as a pairing of incoherent fermions, as previously thought. Rather,\n$T_c$ is non-zero due to the fact that the self-energy is suppressed at the two\nlowest fermionic Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_m = \\pm \\pi T$. We obtain the\nanalytic formula for $T_c$ which reproduces well numerical results for the\nelectron-phonon model at vanishing Debye frequency.\n", "  We rigorously discuss the infrared behavior of the uniform three dimensional\ndipolar Bose systems. In particular, it is shown that low-temperature physics\nof the system is controlled by two parameters, namely isothermal\ncompressibility and intensity of the dipole-dipole interaction. By using\nhydrodynamic approach we calculate the spectrum and damping of low-lying\nexcitations and analyze infrared behavior of the one-particle Green's function.\nThe low-temperature corrections to the anisotropic superfluid density as well\nas condensate depletion are found. Additionally we derive equations of the\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamics for dipolar Bose systems and calculate velocities of\nfirst and second sound.\n", "  We study an axion inflation model recently proposed within the framework of\ntype IIB superstring theory, where we pay a particular attention to a\nsub-Planckian axion decay constant. Our axion potential can lead to the small\nfield inflation with a small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and a typical reheating\ntemperature can be as low as GeV.\n", "  The Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) electronic structure method employs an\nadaptive local basis (ALB) set to solve the Kohn-Sham equations of density\nfunctional theory (DFT) in a discontinuous Galerkin framework. The adaptive\nlocal basis is generated on-the-fly to capture the local material physics, and\ncan systematically attain chemical accuracy with only a few tens of degrees of\nfreedom per atom. A central issue for large-scale calculations, however, is the\ncomputation of the electron density (and subsequently, ground state properties)\nfrom the discretized Hamiltonian in an efficient and scalable manner. We show\nin this work how Chebyshev polynomial filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) can\nbe used to address this issue and push the envelope in large-scale materials\nsimulations in a discontinuous Galerkin framework. We describe how the subspace\nfiltering steps can be performed in an efficient and scalable manner using a\ntwo-dimensional parallelization scheme, thanks to the orthogonality of the DG\nbasis set and block-sparse structure of the DG Hamiltonian matrix. The\non-the-fly nature of the ALBs requires additional care in carrying out the\nsubspace iterations. We demonstrate the parallel scalability of the DG-CheFSI\napproach in calculations of large-scale two-dimensional graphene sheets and\nbulk three-dimensional lithium-ion electrolyte systems. Employing 55,296\ncomputational cores, the time per self-consistent field iteration for a sample\nof the bulk 3D electrolyte containing 8,586 atoms is 90 seconds, and the time\nfor a graphene sheet containing 11,520 atoms is 75 seconds.\n", "  We present the CoLoRFulNNLO method to compute higher order radiative\ncorrections to jet cross sections in perturbative QCD. We apply our method to\nthe computation of event shape observables in electron-positron collisions at\nNNLO accuracy and validate our code by comparing our predictions to previous\nresults in the literature. We also calculate for the first time jet cone energy\nfraction at NNLO.\n", "  We study the effect of thermal blurring caused by the use of (momentum-space)\nrapidity as a proxy of coordinate-space rapidity in experimental measurements\nof conserved charge fluctuations in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In\ntheoretical studies assuming statistical mechanics, calculated fluctuations are\nthose in a spatial volume. Experiments, on the other hand, can measure\nfluctuations only in a momentum-space in the final state. In a standard\nargument to compare experimental results for a momentum space with theoretical\nstudies for a coordinate space, rapidities of particles are implicitly regarded\nas equivalent to their coordinate-space rapidity. We show that the relation of\ntwo fluctuations is significantly altered by the existence of the thermal\nmotion, i.e. thermal blurring. We discuss that the thermal blurring can be\nregarded as a part of the diffusion process, and the effect can be understood\nby studying the rapidity window dependences of fluctuations. Centrality\ndependence of the thermal blurring effect is also discussed.\n", "  We propose a method to study the time evolution of correlated electrons\ndriven by an harmonic perturbation. Combining Floquet formalism to include the\ntime-dependent field and Cluster Perturbation Theory to solve the many-body\nproblem in the presence of short-range correlations, we treat the electron\ndouble dressing - by photons and by e-e interaction - on the same footing. We\napply the method to an extended Hubbard chain at half occupation and we show\nthat in the regime of small field frequency and for given values of field\nstrength the zero-mode Floquet band is no more gapped and the system recovers a\nmetallic state. Our results are indicative of an omnipresent mechanism for\ninsulator-to-metal transition in 1D systems.\n", "  Production of $d$, $t$, and $^3$He nuclei in central Pb+Pb interactions was\nstudied at five collision energies ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 6.3, 7.6, 8.8, 12.3, and\n17.3 GeV) with the NA49 detector at the CERN SPS. Transverse momentum spectra,\nrapidity distributions, and particle ratios were measured. Yields are compared\nto predictions of statistical models. Phase-space distributions of light nuclei\nare discussed and compared to those of protons in the context of a coalescence\napproach. The coalescence parameters $B_2$ and $B_3$, as well as coalescence\nradii for $d$ and $^3$He were determined as a function of transverse mass at\nall energies.\n", "  Linear Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAFs) are chains of spin-$S$ sites with\nisotropic exchange $J$ between neighbors. Open and periodic boundary conditions\nreturn the same ground state energy in the thermodynamic limit, but not the\nsame spin $S_G$ when $S \\ge 1$. The ground state of open chains of N spins has\n$S_G = 0$ or $S$, respectively, for even or odd N. Density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) calculations with different algorithms for even\nand odd N are presented up to N = 500 for the energy and spin densities\n$\\rho(r,N)$ of edge states in HAFs with $S = 1$, 3/2 and 2. The edge states are\nboundary-induced spin density waves (BI-SDWs) with $\\rho(r,N)\\propto(-1)^{r-1}$\nfor $r=1,2,\\ldots N$. The SDWs are in phase when N is odd, out of phase when N\nis even, and have finite excitation energy $\\Gamma(N)$ that decreases\nexponentially with N for integer $S$ and faster than 1/N for half integer $S$.\nThe spin densities and excitation energy are quantitatively modeled for integer\n$S$ chains longer than $5 \\xi$ spins by two parameters, the correlation length\n$\\xi$ and the SDW amplitude, with $\\xi = 6.048$ for $S = 1$ and 49.0 for $S =\n2$. The BI-SDWs of $S = 3/2$ chains are not localized and are qualitatively\ndifferent for even and odd N. Exchange between the ends for odd N is mediated\nby a delocalized effective spin in the middle that increases $|\\Gamma(N)|$ and\nweakens the size dependence. The nonlinear sigma model (NL$\\sigma$M) has been\napplied the HAFs, primarily to $S = 1$ with even N, to discuss spin densities\nand exchange between localized states at the ends as $\\Gamma(N) \\propto (-1)^N\n\\exp(-N/\\xi)$...\n", "  We report on magnetospectroscopy of HgTe quantum wells in magnetic fields up\nto 45 T in temperature range from 4.2 K up to 185 K. We observe intra- and\ninter-band transitions from zero-mode Landau levels, which split from the\nbottom conduction and upper valence subbands, and merge under the applied\nmagnetic field. To describe experimental results, realistic\ntemperature-dependent calculations of Landau levels have been performed. We\nshow that although our samples are topological insulators at low temperatures\nonly, the signature of such phase persists in optical transitions at high\ntemperatures and high magnetic fields. Our results demonstrate that\ntemperature-dependent magnetospectroscopy is a powerful tool to discriminate\ntrivial and topological insulator phases in HgTe quantum wells.\n", "  Using an anomalous transport model for massless quarks and antiquarks, we\nstudy the effect of a magnetic field on the elliptic flows of quarks and\nantiquarks in relativistic heavy ion collisions. With initial conditions from a\nblast wave model and assuming that the strong magnetic field produced in\nnon-central heavy ion collisions can last for a sufficiently long time, we\nobtain an appreciable electric quadrupole moment in the transverse plane of a\nheavy ion collision. The electric quadrupole moment subsequently leads to a\nsplitting between the elliptic flows of quarks and antiquarks. The slope of the\ncharge asymmetry dependence of the elliptic flow difference between positively\nand negatively charged particles is positive, which is expected from the chiral\nmagnetic wave formed in the produced QGP and observed in experiments at the BNL\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider, only if the Lorentz force acting on the\ncharged particles is neglected and the quark-antiquark scattering is assumed to\nbe dominated by the chirality changing channel.\n", "  In this work we develop a theory of surface electromagnetic waves localized\nat the interface of periodic metal-dielectric structures. We have shown that\nthe anisotropy of plasma frequency in metal layers lifts the degeneracy of\nplasma oscillations and opens a series of photonic band gaps. This results in\nappearance of surface waves with singular density of states - we refer to them\nas Tamm-Langmuir waves. Such naming is natural since we have found that their\nproperties are very similar to the properties of both bulk Langmuir and surface\nTamm waves. Depending on the anisotropy parameters, Tamm-Langmuir waves can be\neither forward or backward waves. Singular density of states and high\nsensitivity of the dispersion to the anisotropy of the structure makes\nTamm-Langmuir waves very promising for potential applications in nanophotonics\nand biosensing.\n", "  We study the effect of dimension 7 and 8 operators on inclusive semileptonic\nB decays and the extraction of |Vcb|. Using moments of semileptonic B decay\nspectra and information based on the Lowest-Lying State saturation\nApproximation (LLSA) we perform a global fit of the nonperturbative parameters\nof the heavy quark expansion including for the first time the O(1/mb^{4,5})\ncontributions. Higher power corrections appear to have a very small effect on\nthe extraction of |Vcb|, independently of the weight we attribute to the LLSA.\n", "  Internal phoretic flows due to the interactions of solid boundaries with\nlocal chemical gradients may be created using chemical patterning.\nAlternatively, we demonstrate here that internal flows might also be induced by\ngeometric asymmetries of chemically-homogeneous surfaces. We characterise the\ncirculatory flow created in a cavity enclosed between two eccentric cylindrical\nwalls of uniform chemical activity. Local gradients of the diffusing solute\ninduce a slip flow along the surface of the cylinders, leading to a circulatory\nbulk flow pattern which can be solved analytically in the diffusive limit. The\nflow strength can be controlled by adjusting the relative positions of the\ncylinders and an optimal configuration is identified. These results provide a\nmodel system for tunable phoretic pumps.\n", "  We study the dependence of fragmentation in massive gas-rich galaxy disks at\n$z > 1$ on feedback model and hydrodynamical method, employing the GASOLINE2\nSPH code and the lagrangian mesh-less code GIZMO in finite mass mode. We\ncompare non-cosmological galaxy disk runs with standard blastwave supernovae\n(SN)feedback, which introduces delayed cooling in order to drive winds, and\nruns with the new superbubble SN feedback, which produces winds naturally by\nmodelling the detailed physics of SN-driven bubbles and leads to efficient\nself-regulation of star formation. We find that, with blastwave feedback,\nmassive star forming clumps form in comparable number and with very similar\nmasses in GASOLINE2 and GIZMO. The typical masses are in the range $10^7-10^8\nM_{\\odot}$, lower than in most previous works, while giant clumps with masses\nabove $10^9 M_{\\odot}$ are exceedingly rare. With superbubble feedback,\ninstead, massive bound star forming clumps do not form because galaxies never\nundergo a phase of violent disk instability. Only sporadic, unbound star\nforming overdensities lasting only a few tens of Myr can arise that are\ntriggered by perturbations of massive satellite companions. We conclude that\nthere is a severe tension between explaining massive star forming clumps\nobserved at $z > 1$ primarily as the result of disk fragmentation driven by\ngravitational instability and the prevailing view of feedback-regulated galaxy\nformation. The link between disk stability and star formation efficiency should\nthus be regarded as a key testing ground for galaxy formation theory.\n", "  We present, experimentally and numerically, the observation of\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam recurrence induced by breather solitons in a high-Q SiN\nmicroresonator. Breather solitons can be excited by increasing the pump power\nat a relatively small pump phase detuning in microresonators. Out of phase\npower evolution is observed for groups of comb lines around the center of the\nspectrum compared to groups of lines in the spectral wings. The evolution of\nthe power spectrum is not symmetric with respect to the spectrum center.\nNumerical simulations based on the generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation are in\ngood agreement with the experimental results and unveil the role of stimulated\nRaman scattering in the symmetry breaking of the power spectrum evolution. Our\nresults shows that optical microresonators can be exploited as a powerful\nplatform for the exploration of soliton dynamics.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRB) are millisecond-duration radio pulses with apparent\nextragalactic origins. All but two of the FRBs have been discovered using the\nParkes dish which employs multiple beams formed by an array of feed horns on\nits focal plane. In this paper, we show that (i) the preponderance of\nmultiple-beam detections, and (ii) the detection rates for varying dish\ndiameters, can be used to infer the index $\\alpha$ of the cumulative fluence\ndistribution function (the log$N$-log$F$ function: $\\alpha=1.5$ for a\nnon-evolving population in a Euclidean universe). If all detected FRBs arise\nfrom a single progenitor population, multiple-beam FRB detection rates from the\nParkes telescope yield the constraint $0.52<\\alpha<1.0$ with $90$% confidence.\nSearches at other facilities with different dish sizes refine the constraint to\n$0.66<\\alpha<0.96$. Our results favor FRB searches with smaller dishes, because\nfor $\\alpha<1$, the gain in field-of-view for a smaller dish is more important\nthan the reduction in sensitivity. Further, our results suggest that (i) FRBs\nare not standard candles, and (ii) the distribution of distances to the\ndetected FRBs is weighted towards larger distances. If FRBs are extragalactic,\nthese results are consistent with a cosmological population, which would make\nFRBs excellent probes of the baryonic content and geometry of the Universe.\n", "  In this paper we argue that rounded \"hills\" or \"valleys\" demonstrated by the\nheat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, and elastic module are\nindications of a smeared second order phase transition, which is flattened and\nspread out by the application of a magnetic field. As a result, some of the\ncurves which display a temperature dependence of the corresponding quantities\ncross almost at a single point. Thus, the Vollhardt crossing point should not\nbe identified with any specific energy scale. The smeared phase transition in\nMnSi preceding the helical first order transition most probably corresponds to\nthe planar ferromagnetic ordering, with a small or negligible correlation\nbetween planes. At lower temperatures, the system of ferromagnetic planes\nbecomes correlated, acquiring a helical twist.\n", "  Rare earth doped crystals are promising systems for quantum information\nprocessing. In particular paramagnetic rare earths could be used to build\ncoherent interfaces with optical and microwave photons. In addition, isotopes\nwith non zero nuclear spins could provide long lived states for quantum state\nstorage and processing. Yb3+ is particularly interesting in this respect since\nit is the only paramagnetic rare earth with a spin 1/2 isotope, which\ncorresponds to the simplest possible level structure. In this paper, we report\non the optical and magnetic properties of Yb3+ in the two sites of Y2SiO5, a\ncommonly used crystal for quantum applications. We measured optical\ninhomogeneous linewidths, peak absorption coefficients, oscillator strengths,\nexcited state lifetimes and fuorescence branching ratios. The Zeeman tensors\nwere also determined in the ground and excited states, as well as the ground\nstate hyperfine tensor for the 171Yb3+ (I = 1=2) isotope. These results suggest\nthat Yb3+:Y2SiO5 is a promising material for applications like solid state\noptical and microwave quantum memories.\n", "  The seismic study of the Sun and other stars offers a unique window into the\ninterior of these stars. Thanks to helioseismology, we know the structure of\nthe Sun to admirable precision. In fact, our knowledge is good enough to use\nthe Sun as a laboratory. We have also been able to study the dynamics of the\nSun in great detail. Helioseismic data also allow us to probe the changes that\ntake place in the Sun as solar activity waxes and wanes. The seismic study of\nstars other than the Sun is a fairly new endeavour, but we are making great\nstrides in this field. In this review I discuss some of the techniques used in\nhelioseismic analyses and the results obtained using those techniques. In this\nreview I focus on results obtained with global helioseismology, i.e., the study\nof the Sun using its normal modes of oscillation. I also briefly touch upon\nasteroseismology, the seismic study of stars other than the Sun, and discuss\nhow seismic data of others stars are interpreted.\n", "  Dramatic deficiencies of Li in the mid-F dwarf stars of the Hyades cluster\nwere discovered by Boesgaard & Tripicco. Boesgaard & King discovered\ncorresponding, but smaller, deficiencies in Be in the same narrow temperature\nregion in the Hyades. With the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on the\nHubble Space Telescope we investigate B abundances in the Hyades F stars to\nlook for a potential B dip using the B I resonance line at 2496.8 A. The light\nelements, Li, Be, and B, are destroyed inside stars at increasingly hotter\ntemperatures: 2.5, 3.5, and 5x10^6 K respectively. Consequently, these elements\nsurvive to increasingly greater depths in a star and their surface abundances\nindicate the depth and thoroughness of mixing in the star. We have\n(re)determined Li abundances/upper limits for 79 Hyades dwarfs, Be for 43\nstars, and B in five stars. We find evidence for a small drop in the B\nabundance across the Li-Be dip. The B abundances for the four stars in the\ntemperature range 6100-6730 K fit the B-Be correlation found previously by\nBoesgaard et al. Models of rotational mixing produce good agreement with the\nrelative depletions of Be and B in the dip region. We have compared our nLTE B\nabundances for the three high B stars on either side of the Li-Be dip with\nthose found by Duncan et al. for the two Hyades giants. This confirms the\nfactor of ~10 decline in the B abundance in the Hyades giants as predicted by\ndilution due to the deepening of the surface convection zone.\n", "  We obtained Keck/OSIRIS near-IR adaptive optics-assisted integral-field\nspectroscopy to probe the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in four\nvelocity-offset active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. These objects possess optical emission lines that are offset in\nvelocity from systemic as measured from stellar absorption features. At a\nresolution of ~0.18\", OSIRIS allows us to distinguish which velocity offset\nemission lines are produced by the motion of an AGN in a dual supermassive\nblack hole system, and which are produced by outflows or other kinematic\nstructures. In three galaxies, J1018+2941, J1055+1520 and J1346+5228, the\nspectral offset of the emission lines is caused by AGN-driven outflows. In the\nremaining galaxy, J1117+6140, a counterrotating nuclear disk is observed that\ncontains the peak of Pa$\\alpha$ emission 0.2\" from the center of the galaxy.\nThe most plausible explanation for the origin of this spatially and\nkinematically offset peak is that it is a region of enhanced Pa$\\alpha$\nemission located at the intersection zone between the nuclear disk and the bar\nof the galaxy. In all four objects, the peak of ionized gas emission is not\nspatially coincident with the center of the galaxy as traced by the peak of the\nnear-IR continuum emission. The peaks of ionized gas emission are spatially\noffset from the galaxy centers by 0.1\"-0.4\" (0.1-0.7 kpc). We find that the\nvelocity offset originates at the location of this peak of emission, and the\nvalue of the offset can be directly measured in the velocity maps. The\nemission-line ratios of these four velocity-offset AGNs can be reproduced only\nwith a mixture of shocks and AGN photoionization. Shocks provide a natural\nexplanation for the origin of the spatially and spectrally offset peaks of\nionized gas emission in these galaxies.\n", "  We present a study of charge density wave (CDW) ordering in CeTe$_3$ at room\ntemperature using a scanning tunneling microscope and Raman spectroscopy. Two\ncharacteristic CDW ordering wavevectors obtained from the Fourier analysis are\nassessed to be $|{\\bf \\textbf{c}}^\\ast-{\\bf q}|=4.19\\,{\\rm nm}^{-1}$ and $|{\\bf\nq}|=10.26\\,{\\rm nm}^{-1}$ where $|{\\bf c}^\\ast| = 2\\pi/c$ is the reciprocal\nlattice vector. The scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements, along with\ninelastic light (Raman) scattering measurements, show a CDW gap $\\Delta_{\\rm\nmax}$ of approximately 0.37 eV. In addition to the CDW modulation, we observe\nan organization of the Te sheet atoms in an array of alternating V- and N-\ngroups along the CDW modulation, as predicted in the literature.\n", "  Networks with only central force interactions are floppy when their average\nconnectivity is below an isostatic threshold. Although such networks are\nmechanically unstable, they can become rigid when strained. It was recently\nshown that the transition from floppy to rigid states as a function of simple\nshear strain is continuous, with hallmark signatures of criticality (Nat. Phys.\n12, 584 (2016)). The nonlinear mechanical response of collagen networks was\nshown to be quantitatively described within the framework of such mechanical\ncritical phenomenon. Here, we provide a more quantitative characterization of\ncritical behavior in subisostatic networks. Using finite size scaling we\ndemonstrate the divergence of strain fluctuations in the network at\nwell-defined critical strain. We show that the characteristic strain\ncorresponding to the onset of strain stiffening is distinct from but related to\nthis critical strain in a way that depends on critical exponents. We confirm\nthis prediction experimentally for collagen networks. Moreover, we find that\nthe apparent critical exponents are largely independent of the spatial\ndimensionality. In a highly simplified computational model of network dynamics,\nwe also observe critical slowing down in the vicinity of the critical strain.\nWith subisostaticity as the only required condition, strain-driven criticality\nis expected to be a general feature of biologically relevant fibrous networks.\n", "  Wavefunctions constructed from electron-pair states can accurately model\nstrong electron correlation effects and are promising approaches especially for\nlarger many-body systems. In this article, we analyze the nature and the type\nof electron correlation effects that can be captured by wavefunctions\nrestricted to electron-pair states. We focus on the Antisymmetric Product of\n1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) method combined with an orbital\noptimization protocol presented in [Phys. Rev. B, 89, 201106(R), 2014] whose\nperformance is assessed against electronic structures obtained form DMRG\nreference data. Our numerical analysis covers model systems for strong\ncorrelation: the one-dimensional Hubbard model with periodic boundary condition\nas well as metallic and molecular hydrogen rings. Specifically, the accuracy of\nAP1roG is benchmarked using the single-orbital entropy, the orbital-pair mutual\ninformation as well as the eigenvalue spectrum of the one-orbital and\ntwo-orbital reduced density matrices. Our study indicates that contributions\nfrom singly occupied states become important in the strong correlation regime\nwhich highlights the limitations of the AP1roG method. Furthermore, we examine\nthe effect of orbital rotations within the AP1roG model on correlations between\norbital pairs.\n", "  Rock-salt structured chalcogenides, such as PbTe, PbSe, and SnTe, are the top\ncandidates for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications, and their p-type\nthermoelectric efficiencies can be enhanced via aligning the valence bands.\nHere, we provided comprehensive numerical investigations on the effects of band\nconvergence on electronic properties. We found that the extra valance band can\nindeed significantly enhance the power factor. Nevertheless, the extra valance\nband can also increase the electronic thermal conductivity, which partially\noffsets the enhanced power factor for the overall figure-of-merit. Finally, we\npredicted that the maximum figure-of-merit for PbTe, PbSe, and SnTe can reach\nto 2.2, 1.8, and 1.6, re-spectively, without relying on the reduction in\nlattice thermal conductivity.\n", "  The deconfinement transition and the hadronization mechanism at high energy\nare related to the quark-antiquark string breaking and the corresponding\ntemperature depends on the string tension $\\sigma$. In the Unruh scheme of\nhadron production it turns out $T = \\sqrt{\\sigma/2\\pi}$, with $\\sigma \\simeq\n\\E$, the vacuum energy density. In heavy ion collisions at lower energy, i.e.\nlarge baryonchemical potential, $\\mu_B$, the dynamics is dominated by Fermi\nstatistics and baryon repulsion. However one can still consider $\\E$ as the\nrelevant physical scale and its evaluation as a function of the baryon density,\nin a nuclear matter approach, gives dynamical information on the $\\mu_B$\ndependence of the hadronization temperature and on the value of the critical\nend point in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane.\n", "  The method of the envelope Hamiltonian [K. Toyota, U. Saalmann, and J. M.\nRost, New J. Phys. {\\bf 17}, 073005~(2015)] is applied to further study a\ndetachment dynamics of a model negative ion in one-dimension in high-frequency\nregime. This method is based on the Floquet approach, but the time-dependency\nof an envelope function is explicitly kept for arbitrary pulse durations.\nTherefore, it is capable of describing not only a photo absorption/emission but\nalso a non-adiabatic transition which is induced by the time-varying envelope\nof the pulse. It was shown that the envelope Hamiltonian accurately retrieves\nthe results obtained by the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation, and\nunderlying physics were well understood by the adiabatic approximation based on\nthe envelope Hamiltonian. In this paper, we further explore two more aspects of\nthe detachment dynamics, which were not done in our previous work. First, we\nfind out features of both a {\\it spatial} and {\\it temporal} interference of\nphoto electron wave packets in a photo absorption process. We conclude that\nboth the interference mechanisms are universal in ionization dynamics in\nhigh-frequency regime. To our knowledge, it is first time that both the\ninterference mechanisms in high-frequency regime are extracted from the first\nprinciple. Second, we extract a pulse duration which maximize a yield of the\nnon-adiabatic transition as a function of a pulse duration. It is shown that it\nbecomes maximum when the pulse duration is comparable to a time-scale of an\nelectron.\n", "  Galaxies are thought to grow through accretion; as less massive galaxies are\ndisrupted and merge over time, their debris results in diffuse, clumpy stellar\nhalos enveloping the central galaxy. Here we present a study of the variation\nin the stellar halos of galaxies, using data from the Dragonfly Nearby Galaxies\nSurvey (DNGS). The survey consists of wide field, deep ($\\mu_{g} > 31$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$) optical imaging of nearby galaxies using the Dragonfly Telephoto\nArray. Our sample includes eight spiral galaxies with stellar masses similar to\nthat of the Milky Way, inclinations of $16-90$ degrees and distances between\n$7-18$ Mpc. We construct stellar mass surface density profiles from the\nobserved $g$-band surface brightness in combination with the $g-r$ color as a\nfunction of radius, and compute the halo fractions from the excess stellar mass\n(relative to a disk$+$bulge fit) beyond $5$ half-mass radii. We find a mean\nhalo fraction of $0.009 \\pm 0.005$ and a large RMS scatter of\n$1.01^{+0.9}_{-0.26}$ dex. The peak-to-peak scatter is a factor of $>100$ --\nwhile some galaxies feature strongly structured halos resembling that of M31,\nthree of the eight have halos that are completely undetected in our data. We\nconclude that spiral galaxies as a class exhibit a rich variety in stellar halo\nproperties, implying that their assembly histories have been highly\nnon-uniform. We find no convincing evidence for an environmental or stellar\nmass dependence of the halo fraction in the sample.\n", "  Long-range spatial correlations in the velocity and energy fields of a\ngranular fluid are discussed in the framework of a 1d lattice model. The\ndynamics of the velocity field occurs through nearest-neighbour inelastic\ncollisions that conserve momentum but dissipate energy. A set of equations for\nthe fluctuating hydrodynamics of the velocity and energy mesoscopic fields give\na first approximation for (i) the velocity structure factor and (ii) the\nfinite-size correction to the Haff law, both in the homogeneous cooling regime.\nAt a more refined level, we have derived the equations for the two-site\nvelocity correlations and the total energy fluctuations. First, we seek a\nperturbative solution thereof, in powers of the inverse of system size. On the\none hand, when scaled with the granular temperature, the velocity correlations\ntend to a stationary value in the long time limit. On the other hand, the\nscaled standard deviation of the total energy diverges, that is, the system\nshows multiscaling. Second, we find an exact solution for the velocity\ncorrelations in terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of a certain matrix. The\nresults of numerical simulations of the microscopic model confirm our\ntheoretical results, including the above described multiscaling phenomenon.\n", "  The recent detections of GW150914 and GW151226 imply an abundance of\nstellar-mass binary-black-hole mergers in the local universe. While\nground-based gravitational-wave detectors are limited to observing the final\nmoments before a binary merges, space-based detectors, such as the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA), can observe binaries at lower orbital\nfrequencies where such systems may still encode information about their\nformation histories. In particular, the orbital eccentricity and mass of binary\nblack holes in the LISA frequency band can be used together to discriminate\nbetween binaries formed in isolation in galactic fields and those formed in\ndense stellar environments such as globular clusters. In this letter, we\nexplore the orbital eccentricity and mass of binary-black-hole populations as\nthey evolve through the LISA frequency band. Overall we find that there are two\ndistinct populations discernible by LISA. We show that up to ~90% of binaries\nformed either dynamically or in isolation have eccentricities measurable by\nLISA. Finally, we note how measured eccentricities of low-mass binary black\nholes evolved in isolation could provide detailed constraints on the physics of\nblack-hole natal kicks and common-envelope evolution.\n", "  We present the discovery of three modestly-irradiated, roughly Neptune-mass\nplanets orbiting three nearby Solar-type stars. HD 42618 b has a minimum mass\nof $15.4 \\pm 2.4$ M$_{\\oplus}$, a semi-major axis of 0.55 AU, an equilibrium\ntemperature of 337 K, and is the first planet discovered to orbit the solar\nanalogue host star, HD 42618. We also discover new planets orbiting the known\nexoplanet host stars HD 164922 and HD 143761 ($\\rho$ CrB). The new planet\norbiting HD 164922 has a minimum mass of $12.9 \\pm 1.6$ M$_{\\oplus}$ and orbits\ninterior to the previously known Jovian mass planet orbiting at 2.1 AU. HD\n164922 c has a semi-major axis of 0.34 AU and an equilibrium temperature of 418\nK. HD 143761 c orbits with a semi-major axis of 0.44 AU, has a minimum mass of\n$25 \\pm 2$ M$_{\\oplus}$, and is the warmest of the three new planets with an\nequilibrium temperature of 445 K. It orbits exterior to the previously known\nwarm Jupiter in the system. A transit search using space-based CoRoT data and\nground-based photometry from the Automated Photometric Telescopes (APTs) at\nFairborn Observatory failed to detect any transits, but the precise,\nhigh-cadence APT photometry helped to disentangle planetary-reflex motion from\nstellar activity. These planets were discovered as part of an ongoing radial\nvelocity survey of bright, nearby, chromospherically-inactive stars using the\nAutomated Planet Finder (APF) telescope at Lick Observatory. The high-cadence\nAPF data combined with nearly two decades of radial velocity data from Keck\nObservatory and gives unprecedented sensitivity to both short-period low-mass,\nand long-period intermediate-mass planets.\n", "  Recent improvements in the age dating of stellar populations and single stars\nallow us to study the ages and abundance of stars and galaxies with\nunprecedented accuracy. We here compare the relation between age and\n\\alpha-element abundances for stars in the solar neighborhood to that of local,\nearly-type galaxies. We find both relations to be very similar. Both fall into\ntwo regimes with a flat slope for ages younger than ~9 Gyr and a steeper slope\nfor ages older than that value. This quantitative similarity seems surprising,\ngiven the different types of galaxies and scales involved. For the sample of\nearly-type galaxies we also show that the data are inconsistent with literature\ndelay time distributions of either single or double Gaussian shape. The data\nare consistent with a power law delay time distribution. We thus confirm that\nthe delay time distribution inferred for the Milky Way from chemical evolution\narguments also must apply to massive early-type galaxies. We also offer a\ntentative explanation for the seeming universality of the age-[\\alpha/Fe]\nrelation as the manifestation of averaging of different stellar populations\nwith varying chemical evolution histories.\n", "  The adsorption of DNA or other polyelectrolyte molecules on charged membranes\nis a recurrent motif in soft matter and bionanotechnological systems. Two\ntypical situations encountered are the deposition of single DNA chains onto\nsubstrates for further analysis, e.g., by force microscopy, or the pulling of\npolyelectrolytes into membrane nanopores, as in sequencing applications. In\nthis paper, we present a theoretical analysis of such scenarios based on the\nself-consistent field theory approach, which allows us to address the important\neffect of charge correlations. We calculate the grand potential of a stiff\npolyelectrolyte immersed in an electrolyte in contact with a negatively charged\ndielectric membrane. For the sake of conciseness, we neglect conformational\npolymer fluctuations and model the molecule as a rigid charged line. At\nstrongly charged membranes, the adsorbed counterions enhance the screening\nability of the interfacial region. In the presence of highly charged polymers\nsuch as double-stranded DNA molecules close to the membrane, this enhanced\ninterfacial screening dominates the mean-field level DNA-membrane repulsion and\nresults in the adsorption of the DNA molecule to the surface. This picture\nprovides a simple explanation for the recently observed DNA binding onto\nsimilarly charged substrates [G. L.-Caballero et al., Soft Matter 10, 2805\n(2014)] and points out charge correlations as a non-negligible ingredient of\npolymer-surface interactions.\n", "  We determine the effect of intergalactic magnetic fields on the distribution\nof high energy gamma rays by performing three-dimensional Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the development of gamma-ray-induced electromagnetic cascades in\nthe magnetized intergalactic medium. We employ the so-called 'Large Sphere\nObserver' method to efficiently simulate blazar gamma ray halos. We study\nmagnetic fields with a Batchelor spectrum and with maximal left- and\nright-handed helicities. We also consider the case of sources whose jets are\ntilted with respect to the line of sight. We verify the formation of extended\ngamma ray halos around the source direction, and observe spiral-like patterns\nif the magnetic field is helical. We apply the $Q$-statistics to the simulated\nhalos to extract their spiral nature and also propose an alternative method,\nthe $S$-statistics. Both methods provide a quantative way to infer the helicity\nof the intervening magnetic fields from the morphology of individual blazar\nhalos for magnetic field strengths $B \\gtrsim 10^{-15}\\,{\\rm G}$ and magnetic\ncoherence lengths $L_{\\rm c} \\gtrsim 100\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. We show that the\n$S$-statistics has a better performance than the $Q$-statistics when assessing\nmagnetic helicity from the simulated halos.\n", "  Dark matter that gets captured in the Sun may form positronium-like bound\nstates if it self-interacts via light dark photons. In this case, dark matter\ncan either annihilate to dark photons or recombine in bound states which\nsubsequently also decay to dark photons. The fraction of the dark photons that\nleave the Sun without decaying to Standard Model particles have a\ncharacteristic energy spectrum which is a mixture of the direct annihilation\nprocess, the decays of ortho- and para- bound states and the recombination\nprocess. The ultimate decay of these dark photons to positron-electron pairs\n(via kinetic mixing) outside the Sun creates a distinct signal that can either\nidentify or set strict constraints on dark photon models.\n", "  We present a fully first-principles method for superconducting thin films.\nThe layer dependent phonon spectrum is calculated to determine the layer\ndependence of the electron-phonon coupling for such systems, which is coupled\nto the Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, and it is solved in a\nparameter free way. The theory is then applied to different surface facets of\nniobium slabs and to niobium-gold heterostructures. We investigate the\ndependence of the transition temperature on the thickness of the slabs and the\ninverse proximity effect observed in thin superconducting heterostructures.\n", "  We have determined the superconducting and magnetic properties of a\nhydrothermally synthesized powder sample of tetragonal FeS using muon spin\nrotation ({\\mu}SR). The superconducting properties are entirely consistent with\nthose of a recently published study, showing fully gapped behavior and giving a\npenetration depth of {\\lambda}_{ab} = 204(3) nm. However, our zero-field\n{\\mu}SR data are rather different and indicate the presence of a small,\nnon-superconducting magnetic phase within the sample. These results highlight\nthat sample-to-sample variations in magnetism can arise in hydrothermally\nprepared phases, but interestingly the superconducting behavior is remarkably\ninsensitive to these variations.\n", "  Globular clusters (GCs) are known to harbor multiple stellar populations. To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We\nconclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to\naccrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario.\n", "  Geometric constraints impact the formation of a broad range of spatial\nnetworks, from amino acid chains folding to proteins structures to rearranging\nparticle aggregates. How the network of interactions dynamically self-organizes\nin such systems is far from fully understood. Here, we analyze a class of\nspatial network formation processes by introducing a mapping from geometric to\ngraph-theoretic constraints. Combining stochastic and mean field analyses\nyields an algebraic scaling law for the extent (graph diameter) of the\nresulting networks with system size, in contrast to logarithmic scaling known\nfor networks without constraints. Intriguingly, the exponent falls between that\nof self-avoiding random walks and that of space filling arrangements,\nconsistent with experimentally observed scaling (of the spatial radius of\ngyration) for protein tertiary structures.\n", "  Descent extensions of the soft-wall model are used to accommodate two\nvariants of Regge trajectories of vector meson excitations. At non-zero\ntemperatures, various options for either sequential or instantaneous\ndisappearance of vector mesons as normalisable modes are found, thus emulating\ndeconfinement at a certain temperature in the order of the (pseudo-) critical\ntemperature of QCD. The crucial role of the blackness function, which steers\nthe thermodynamic properties of the considered system, is highlighted.\n", "  Outflows of photoionized gas are commonly detected in the X-ray spectra of\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. However, the evidence for this phenomenon in broad line\nradio galaxies, which are analogous to Seyfert 1 galaxies in the radio-loud\nregime, has so far been scarce. Here, we present the analysis of the X-ray\nabsorption in the radio-loud quasar 4C +74.26. With the aim of characterizing\nthe kinetic and the ionization conditions of the absorbing material, we fitted\njointly the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) and the Chandra\nHigh Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) spectra, which were taken\n4 months apart. The intrinsic continuum flux did not vary significantly during\nthis time lapse. The spectrum shows the absorption signatures (e.g., Fe-UTA,\n\\ion{O}{vii}, and \\ion{Ne}{vii}--\\ion{Ne}{x}) of a photoionized gas outflow\n($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 3.5 \\times 10^{21} \\rm cm^{-2}$, $\\log \\xi \\sim 2.6$, $v_{\\rm\nout}\\sim 3600 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$) located at the redshift of source. We\nestimate that the gas is located outside the broad line region but within the\nboundaries of the putative torus. This ionized absorber is consistent with the\nX-ray counterpart of a polar scattering outflow reported in the optical band\nfor this source. The kinetic luminosity carried by the outflow is insufficient\nto produce a significant feedback is this quasar. Finally, we show that the\nheavy soft X-ray absorption that was noticed in the past for this source arises\nmostly in the Galactic ISM.\n", "  In the conference presentation we have reviewed the theory of non-Gaussian\ngeometrical measures for the 3D Cosmic Web of the matter distribution in the\nUniverse and 2D sky data, such as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps that\nwas developed in a series of our papers. The theory leverages symmetry of\nisotropic statistics such as Minkowski functionals and extrema counts to\ndevelop post- Gaussian expansion of the statistics in orthogonal polynomials of\ninvariant descriptors of the field, its first and second derivatives. The\napplication of the approach to 2D fields defined on a spherical sky was\nsuggested, but never rigorously developed. In this paper we present such\ndevelopment treating effects of the curvature and finiteness of the spherical\nspace $S_2$ exactly, without relying on the flat-sky approximation. We present\nMinkowski functionals, including Euler characteristic and extrema counts to the\nfirst non-Gaussian correction, suitable for weakly non-Gaussian fields on a\nsphere, of which CMB is the prime example.\n", "  Among the candidates for generating turbulence in accretion discs in\nsituations with low intrinsic ionization the vertical shear instability (VSI)\nhas become an interesting candidate, as it relies purely on a vertical gradient\nin the angular velocity. Existing simulations have shown that $\\alpha$-values a\nfew times $10^{-4}$ can be generated. The particle growth in the early planet\nformation phase is determined by the dynamics of dust particles. Here, we\naddress in particular the efficiency of VSI-turbulence in concentrating\nparticles in order to generate overdensities and low collision velocities. We\nperform 3D numerical hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs around young\nstars that include radiative transport and irradiation from the central star.\nThe motion of particles within a size range of a fraction of mm up to several m\nis followed using standard drag formula. We confirm that under realistic\nconditions the VSI is able to generate turbulence in full 3D protoplanetary\ndiscs. The irradiated disc shows turbulence within 10 to 60au. The mean radial\nmotion of the gas is such that it is directed inward near the midplane and\noutward in the surface layers. We find that large particles drift inward with\nthe expected speed, while small particles can experience phases of outward\ndrift. Additionally, the particles show bunching behaviour with overdensities\nreaching 5 times the average value, which is strongest for dimensionless\nstopping times around unity. Particles in a VSI-turbulent discs are\nconcentrated in large scale turbulent eddies and show low relative speeds that\nallow for growing collisions. The reached overdensities will also allow for the\nonset streaming instabilities further enhancing particle growth. The outward\ndrift for small particles at higher disk elevations allows for the transport of\nprocessed high temperature material in the Solar System to larger distances.\n", "  With only two functional reaction wheels, Kepler cannot maintain stable\npointing at its original target field and entered a new mode of observation\ncalled K2. Our method is based on many years of experience in planet hunting\nfor the CoRoT mission. Due to the unstable pointing, K2 light curves present\nsystematics that are correlated with the target position in the CCD. Therefore,\nour pipeline also includes a decorrelation of this systematic noise. Our\npipeline is optimised for bright stars for which spectroscopic follow-up is\npossible. We achieve a maximum precision on 6 hours of 6 ppm. The decorrelated\nlight curves are searched for transits with an adapted version of the CoRoT\nalarm pipeline. We present 172 planetary candidates and 327 eclipsing binary\ncandidates from campaigns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of K2. Both the planetary\ncandidates and eclipsing binary candidates lists are made public to promote\nfollow-up studies. The light curves will also be available to the community.\n", "  The mass ordering of mean transverse momentum $\\left<p_T\\right>$ and of the\nFourier harmonic coefficient $v_2 (p_T)$ of azimuthally anisotropic particle\ndistributions in high energy hadron collisions is often interpreted as evidence\nfor the hydrodynamic flow of the matter produced. We investigate an alternative\ninitial state interpretation of this pattern in high multiplicity proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC. The QCD Yang-Mills equations describing the dynamics of\nsaturated gluons are solved numerically with initial conditions obtained from\nthe Color Glass Condensate based IP-Glasma model. The gluons are subsequently\nfragmented into various hadron species employing the well established Lund\nstring fragmentation algorithm of the PYTHIA event generator. We find that this\nab initio initial state approach reproduces characteristic features of bulk\nspectra, in particular the particle mass dependence of $\\left<p_T\\right>$ and\n$v_2 (p_T)$.\n", "  We present a coherent database of spectroscopic observations of far-IR\nfine-structure lines from the Herschel/PACS archive for a sample of 170 local\nAGN, plus a comparison sample of 20 starburst galaxies and 43 dwarf galaxies.\nPublished Spitzer/IRS and Herschel/SPIRE line fluxes are included to extend our\ndatabase to the full 10-600 $\\mu m$ spectral range. The observations are\ncompared to a set of CLOUDY photoionisation models to estimate the above\nphysical quantities through different diagnostic diagrams. We confirm the\npresence of a stratification of gas density in the emission regions of the\ngalaxies, which increases with the ionisation potential of the emission lines.\nThe new [OIV]25.9$\\mu m$/[OIII]88$\\mu m$ vs [NeIII]15.6$\\mu m$/[NeII]12.8$\\mu\nm$ diagram is proposed as the best diagnostic to separate: $i)$ AGN activity\nfrom any kind of star formation; and $ii)$ low-metallicity dwarf galaxies from\nstarburst galaxies. Current stellar atmosphere models fail to reproduce the\nobserved [OIV]25.9$\\mu m$/[OIII]88$\\mu m$ ratios, which are much higher when\ncompared to the predicted values. Finally, the ([NeIII]15.6$\\mu m$ +\n[NeII]12.8$\\mu m$)/([SIV]10.5$\\mu m$ + [SIII]18.7$\\mu m$) ratio is proposed as\na promising metallicity tracer to be used in obscured objects, where optical\nlines fail to accurately measure the metallicity. The diagnostic power of mid-\nto far-infrared spectroscopy shown here for local galaxies will be of crucial\nimportance to study galaxy evolution during the dust-obscured phase at the peak\nof the star formation and black-hole accretion activity ($1 < z < 4$). This\nstudy will be addressed by future deep spectroscopic surveys with present and\nforthcoming facilities such as JWST, ALMA, and SPICA.\n", "  Atomtronics has the potential for engineering new types of functional\ndevices, such as Josephson junctions (JJs). Previous studies have mainly\nfocused on JJs whose ground states have 0 or $\\pi $ superconducting phase\ndifference across the junctions, while arbitrarily tunable phase JJs may have\nimportant applications in superconducting electronics and quantum computation.\nHere we show that a phase tunable JJ can be implemented in a spin-orbit coupled\ncold atomic gas with the magnetic tunneling barrier generated by a\nspin-dependent focused laser beam. We consider the JJ confined in either a\nlinear harmonic trap or a circular ring trap. In the ring trap, the magnetic\nbarrier induces a spontaneous mass current for the ground state of the JJ,\ndemonstrating the magnetoelectric effects of cold atoms.\n", "  Context: Theoretical modelling of time-lags between variations in the Fe\nK$\\alpha$ emission and the X-ray continuum might shed light on the physics and\ngeometry of the X-ray emitting region in active galaxies (AGN) and X-ray\nbinaries. We here present the results from a systematic analysis of time-lags\nbetween variations in two energy bands ($5-7$ vs $2-4\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) for seven\nX-ray bright and variable AGN.\n  Aims: We estimate time-lags as accurately as possible and fit them with\ntheoretical models in the context of the lamp-post geometry. We also constrain\nthe geometry of the X-ray emitting region in AGN.\n  Methods: We used all available archival \\textit{XMM-Newton} data for the\nsources in our sample and extracted light curves in the $5-7$ and\n$2-4\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ energy bands. We used these light curves and applied a\nthoroughly tested (through extensive numerical simulations) recipe to estimate\ntime-lags that have minimal bias, approximately follow a Gaussian distribution,\nand have known errors. Using traditional $\\chi^2$ minimisation techniques, we\nthen fitted the observed time-lags with two different models: a\nphenomenological model where the time-lags have a power-law dependence on\nfrequency, and a physical model, using the reverberation time-lags expected in\nthe lamp-post geometry. The latter were computed assuming a point-like primary\nX-ray source above a black hole surrounded by a neutral and prograde accretion\ndisc with solar iron abundance. We took all relativistic effects into account\nfor various X-ray source heights, inclination angles, and black hole spin\nvalues.\n", "  The optical morphology of galaxies holds the cumulative record of their\nassembly history, and techniques for its quantitative characterization offer a\npromising avenue toward understanding galaxy formation and evolution. However,\nthe morphology of star-forming galaxies is generally dictated by the youngest\nstellar component, which can readily overshine faint structural/morphological\nfeatures in the older underlying stellar background (e.g., relics from recent\nminor mergers) that could hold important insights into the galaxy build-up\nprocess. Stripping off galaxy images from the emission from stellar populations\nyounger than an adjustable age cutoff tcut can, therefore, provide a valuable\ntool in extragalactic research. RemoveYoung (RY), a publicly available tool\nthat is presented here, exploits the combined power of integral field\nspectroscopy (IFS) and spectral population synthesis (SPS) toward this goal.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) post-processing of SPS models to IFS data cubes with RY\npermits computation of the spectral energy, surface brightness, and stellar\nsurface density distribution of stellar populations older than a user-defined\ntcut. This suggests a variety of applications of star-forming galaxies, such as\ninteracting or merging galaxy pairs and lower mass starburst galaxies near and\nfar; these include blue compact and tidal dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the thermodynamic and transport properties of\nsilver-substituted BaFe2As2 (122) crystals, up to ~4.5%. Similar to other\ntransition-metal substitutions in 122, Ag diminishes the antiferromagnetic (TN)\nand structural (TS) transition temperatures, but unlike other electron-doped\n122s, TN and TS coincide without splitting. Although magnetism drops\nprecipitously to TN = 84 K at doping x = 0.029, it only weakly changes above\nthis x, settling at TN = 80 K at x = 0.045. Compared to this persistent\nmagnetism in Ag-122, doping other group 11 elements of either Cu or Au in 122\ndiminished TN and induced superconductivity near TC = 2 K at x = 0.044 or\n0.031, respectively. Ag-122 crystals show reflective surfaces with surprising\nthicker cross sections for x >= 0.019, the appearance that is in contrast to\nthe typical thin stacked layered feature seen in all other flux-grown x122 and\nlower Ag-122. This physical trait may be a manifest of intrinsic weak changes\nin c-lattice and TN. Our theoretical calculations suggest that Ag doping\nproduces strong electronic scattering and yet a relatively small disruption of\nthe magnetic state, both of which preclude superconductivity in this system.\n", "  Mergers of two stellar origin black holes are a prime source of gravitational\nwaves and are under intensive investigations. One crucial ingredient in their\nmodeling has so far been neglected. Pair-instability pulsation supernovae with\nassociated severe mass loss may suppress formation of massive black holes,\ndecreasing black hole merger rates for the highest black hole masses.\n  The mass loss associated with pair-instability pulsation supernovae limits\nthe Population I/II stellar-origin black hole mass to 50 Msun, in tension with\nearlier predictions that the maximum black hole mass could be as high as 100\nMsun.\n  Suppression of double black hole merger rates by pair-instability pulsation\nsupernovae is negligible for our evolutionary channel. Our standard\nevolutionary model with inclusion of pair-instability pulsation supernovae and\nwith pair-instability supernovae is fully consistent with the LIGO detections\nof black hole mergers: GW150914, GW151226 and LVT151012. The LIGO observations\nseem to exclude high (>400 km/s) BH natal kicks. We predict the detection of\nseveral up to 60 BH-BH mergers with total mass 10--150 Msun (most likely range:\n20--80 Msun) in the forthcoming 60 effective days of LIGO O2 observations.\n", "  Smoothed Dissipative Particle Dynamics (SDPD) is a mesoscopic method which\nallows to select the level of resolution at which a fluid is simulated. In this\nwork, we study the consistency of the resulting thermodynamic properties as a\nfunction of the size of the mesoparticles, both at equilibrium and out of\nequilibrium. We also propose a reformulation of the SDPD equations in terms of\nenergy variables. This increases the similarities with Dissipative Particle\nDynamics with Energy conservation and opens the way for a coupling between the\ntwo methods. Finally, we present a numerical scheme for SDPD that ensures the\nconservation of the invariants of the dynamics. Numerical simulations\nillustrate this approach.\n", "  The first Fermi-LAT High-energy source catalog (1FHL), containing gamma-ray\nsources detected above 10 GeV, is an ideal sample to characterize the physical\nproperties of the most extreme gamma-ray sources. We investigate the pc scale\nproperties of a sub-sample of radio faint 1FHL sources with the aim to confirm\nthe proposed blazar associations, by revealing a compact high brightness\ntemperature radio core, and we propose new low-frequency counterparts for the\nunassociated gamma-ray sources (UGS). Moreover, we increase the number of 1FHL\nsources with high resolution observations to explore the possible connection\nbetween radio and gamma rays at E >10 GeV. We observed 84 1FHL sources, mostly\nblazars of High Synchrotron Peaked (HSP) type, in the northern sky with the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz. These sources lack high resolution\nradio observations and have at least one NVSS counterpart within the 95%\nconfidence radius. For those sources without a well identified radio\ncounterpart we exploit the VLBA multiple phase-center correlation capability to\ndiscern among the possible low-frequency candidates. For about 93% of the\nsources of our sample we reveal a compact high brightness temperature radio\ncore, supporting their proposed blazar association. The vast majority of the\ndetected sources are radio weak, with a median VLBI flux density value of 16.3\nmJy. For the detected sources we obtain an average brightness temperature of\nthe order of $2\\times10^{10} \\, \\rm{K}$. We find a compact component for 16\nUGS, for which we propose a new low-frequency association. We find brightness\ntemperature values which do not require high Doppler factors, and are in\nagreement with the expected values for the equipartition of energy between\nparticles and magnetic field. We find strong indications about the blazar\nnature of all of the detected UGS, for which we propose new low-frequency\nassociations.\n", "  X-ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes on the surface of accreting neutron\nstars and reliable burst models are needed to interpret observations in terms\nof properties of the neutron star and the binary system. We investigate the\ndependence of X-ray burst models on uncertainties in (p,$\\gamma$),\n($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$), and ($\\alpha$,p) nuclear reaction rates using fully\nself-consistent burst models that account for the feedbacks between changes in\nnuclear energy generation and changes in astrophysical conditions. A two-step\napproach first identified sensitive nuclear reaction rates in a single-zone\nmodel with ignition conditions chosen to match calculations with a\nstate-of-the-art 1D multi-zone model based on the {\\Kepler} stellar evolution\ncode. All relevant reaction rates on neutron deficient isotopes up to mass 106\nwere individually varied by a factor of 100 up and down. Calculations of the 84\nhighest impact reaction rate changes were then repeated in the 1D multi-zone\nmodel. We find a number of uncertain reaction rates that affect predictions of\nlight curves and burst ashes significantly. The results provide insights into\nthe nuclear processes that shape X-ray burst observables and guidance for\nfuture nuclear physics work to reduce nuclear uncertainties in X-ray burst\nmodels.\n", "  In this work we illustrate the detrimental impact of the Cooper pair's\nspin-structure on the thermodynamic and topological properties of a\nspin-triplet superconductor in an applied Zeeman field. We particularly focus\non the paradigmatic one-dimensional case (Kitaev chain) for which we\nself-consistently retrieve the energetically preferred Cooper pair spin-state\nin terms of the corresponding spin d-vector. The latter undergoes a substantial\nangular and amplitude reorganization upon the variation of the strength and the\norientation of the field and results to a modification of the bulk topological\nphase diagram. Markedly, when addressing the open chain we find that the\norientation of the d-vector varies spatially near the boundary, affecting in\nthis manner the appearance of Majorana fermions at the edge or even altering\nthe properties of the bulk region. Our analysis reveals the limitations and\nbreakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in interacting topological\nsystems.\n", "  In the light of the recent result from KamLAND-Zen (KLZ) and GERDA Phase-II,\nwe update the bounds on the effective mass and the new physics parameters,\nrelevant for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu \\beta \\beta$). In addition\nto the light Majorana neutrino exchange, we analyze beyond standard model\ncontributions that arise in Left-Right symmetry and R-Parity violating\nsupersymmetry. The improved limit from KLZ constrains the effective mass of\nlight neutrino exchange down to sub-eV mass regime 0.06 eV. Using the\ncorrelation between the $^{136}\\rm{Xe}$ and $^{76}\\rm{Ge}$ half-lives, we show\nthat the KLZ limit individually rules out the positive claim of observation of\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ for all nuclear matrix element compilation. For the Left-Right\nsymmetry and R-parity violating supersymmetry, the KLZ bound implies a factor\nof 2 improvement of the effective mass and the new physics parameters. The\nfuture ton scale experiments such as, nEXO will further constrain these models,\nin particular, will rule out standard as well as Type-II dominating LRSM\ninverted hierarchy scenario.\n", "  The evolution of the number density of galaxies in the universe, and thus\nalso the total number of galaxies, is a fundamental question with implications\nfor a host of astrophysical problems including galaxy evolution and cosmology.\nHowever there has never been a detailed study of this important measurement,\nnor a clear path to answer it. To address this we use observed galaxy stellar\nmass functions up to $z\\sim8$ to determine how the number densities of galaxies\nchanges as a function of time and mass limit. We show that the increase in the\ntotal number density of galaxies ($\\phi_{\\rm T}$), more massive than M$_{*} =\n10^{6}$ M_0, decreases as $\\phi_{\\rm T} \\sim t^{-1}$, where $t$ is the age of\nthe universe. We further show that this evolution turns-over and rather\nincreases with time at higher mass lower limits of M$_{*}>10^{7}$ M_0. By using\nthe M$_{*}=10^{6}$ M_0 lower limit we further show that the total number of\ngalaxies in the universe up to $z = 8$ is $2.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6} \\times 10^{12}$\n(two trillion), almost a factor of ten higher than would be seen in an all sky\nsurvey at Hubble Ultra-Deep Field depth. We discuss the implications for these\nresults for galaxy evolution, as well as compare our results with the latest\nmodels of galaxy formation. These results also reveal that the cosmic\nbackground light in the optical and near-infrared likely arise from these\nunobserved faint galaxies. We also show how these results solve the question of\nwhy the sky at night is dark, otherwise known as Olbers' paradox.\n", "  In this work we investigate the impact of calculating non-equilibrium\nchemical abundances consistently with the temperature structure for the\natmospheres of highly-irradiated, close-in gas giant exoplanets. Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics\ncalculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium\nchemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated\nobservations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong\ninterpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models\nviolating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere.\n", "  The two-nucleon momentum distributions have been calculated for nuclei up to\nA=40 and various values of the relative and center-of-mass momenta and angle\nbetween them. For complex nuclei a parameter-free linked-cluster expansion,\nbased upon a realistic local two-nucleon interaction of the Argonne family and\nvariational wave function featuring central, tensor, spin and iso-spin\ncorrelations, has been used. The obtained results show that: 1) independently\nof the mass number A, at values of the relative momentum k_rel> 2 fm^{-1} the\nproton-neutron momentum distributions for back-to-back (BB) nucleons (K_cm=0)\nexhibit the factorization property n_A^{pn}(k_rel,K_cm=0)=C_A^{pn} n_D(k_rel)\nn_{cm}^{pn}(K_cm=0), where n_D is the deuteron momentum distribution,\nn_{cm}^{pn}(K_{cm}=0) the momentum distribution of the c.m. motion of the pair\nand C_A^{pn} the nuclear contact measuring the number of BB pn pairs with\ndeuteron-like momenta; 2) the values of the proton-neutron nuclear contact\nC_A^{pn} are obtained in a model-independent way from the ratio\nn_A^{pn}(k_rel,K_cm=0)/n_D(k_rel) n_{cm}^{pn}(K_cm=0); 3) also the\nK_cm-integrated pn momentum distributions divided by the deuteron momentum\ndistribution exhibits a constant behavior equal to C_A^{pn}, but only at very\nhigh values of k_{rel}> 3.5fm^{-1}, where the relative momentum distribution is\nentirely governed by BB short-range correlated nucleons; 4) the absolute value\nof the number of pn and pp short-range correlated pairs is calculated,\nillustrating that the high values (K_cm>1 fm^{-1}) of the pair c.m. momentum\nappreciably reduce the dominance of the pn over pp pairs produced by the tensor\nforce when K_cm=0; 5) calculations are in good agreement with the VMC\ncalculations for light nuclei and with available experimental on the processes\nA(e,e'pn)X and A(e,e'pp)X.\n", "  We discuss the dynamical response of strongly interacting Bose atoms in an\nadiabatically tilted optical lattice. The analysis is performed in terms of the\nmulti-level Landau-Zenner tunneling. Different regimes of tunneling are\nidentified and analytical expressions for the doublon number, which is the\nquantity measured in laboratory experiments, are derived.\n", "  We propose a feasible and effective approach to study quantum thermal\ntransport through anharmonic systems. The main idea is to obtain an {\\it\neffective} harmonic Hamiltonian for the anharmonic system by applying the\nself-consistent phonon theory. Using the effective harmonic Hamiltonian we\nstudy thermal transport within the framework of nonequilibrium Green's function\nmethod using the celebrated Caroli formula. We corroborate our quantum\nself-consistent approach using the quantum master equation that can deal with\nanharmonicity exactly, but is limited to the weak system-bath coupling regime.\nFinally, in order demonstrate its strength we apply the quantum self-consistent\napproach to study thermal rectification in a weakly coupled two segment\nanharmonic system.\n", "  We calculate analytically the stochastic thermodynamic properties of an\nisothermal Brownian engine driven by a duo of time-periodic forces, including\nits Onsager coefficients, the stochastic work of each force, and the\ncorresponding stochastic entropy production. We verify the relations between\ndifferent operational regimes, maximum power, maximum efficiency and minimum\ndissipation, and reproduce the signature features of the stochastic efficiency.\nAll these results are experimentally tested without adjustable parameters on a\ncolloidal system.\n", "  The closest radio galaxies; Centaurus A, M87 and NGC 1275, have been detected\nfrom radio wavelengths to TeV $\\gamma$-rays, and also studied as high-energy\nneutrino and ultra-high-energy cosmic ray potential emitters. Their spectral\nenergy distributions show a double-peak feature, which is explained by\nsynchrotron self-Compton model. However, TeV $\\gamma$-ray measured spectra\ncould suggest that very-high-energy $\\gamma$-rays might have a hadronic origin.\nWe introduce a lepto-hadronic model to describe the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution; from radio to sub GeV photons as synchrotron self-Compton\nemission and TeV $\\gamma$-ray photons as neutral pion decay resulting from\np$\\gamma$ interactions occurring close to the core. These photo-hadronic\ninteractions take place when Fermi-accelerated protons interact with the seed\nphotons around synchrotron self-Compton peaks. Obtaining a good description of\nthe TeV $\\gamma$-ray fluxes, firstly, we compute neutrino fluxes and events\nexpected in IceCube detector and secondly, we estimate ultra-high-energy cosmic\nray fluxes and event rate expected in Telescope Array, Pierre Auger and HiRes\nobservatories. Within this scenario we show that the expected high-energy\nneutrinos cannot explain the astrophysical flux observed by IceCube, and the\nconnection with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed by Auger experiment\naround Centaurus A, might be possible only considering a heavy nuclei\ncomposition in the observed events.\n", "  NGC 4660, in the Virgo cluster, is a well-studied elliptical galaxy which has\na strong disk component (D/T about 0.2-0.3). The central regions including the\ndisk component have stellar populations with ages about 12-13 Gyr from SAURON\nstudies. However we report the discovery of a long narrow tidal filament\nassociated with the galaxy in deep co-added Schmidt plate images and deep CCD\nframes, implying that the galaxy has undergone a tidal interaction and merger\nwithin the last few Gyr. The relative narrowness of the filament implies a wet\nmerger with at least one spiral galaxy involved, but the current state of the\nsystem has little evidence for this. However a 2-component photometric fit\nusing GALFIT shows much bluer B-V colours for the disk component than for the\nelliptical component, which may represent a residual trace of enhanced star\nformation in the disk caused by the interaction 1-2 Gyr ago. There are brighter\nconcentrations within the filament which resemble Tidal Dwarf Galaxies,\nalthough they are at least 40 times fainter. These may represent faint, evolved\nversions of these galaxies. A previously detected stripped satellite galaxy\nsouth of the nucleus is seen in our residual image and may imply that the\nfilament is a tidal stream produced by perigalactic passages of this satellite.\n", "  We present an analysis of the complex gas hydrodynamics in the X-ray luminous\ngalaxy cluster RXJ1347.5-1145 caught in the act of merging with a subcluster to\nits southeast using a combined $186$ ks Chandra exposure, $2.5$ times greater\nthan previous analyses. The primary cluster hosts a sloshing cold front spiral\ntraced by four surface brightness edges $5.^{\\prime \\prime}85^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$\nwest, $7.^{\\prime \\prime}10^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ southeast, $11.^{\\prime\n\\prime}5^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$ east, and $16.^{\\prime \\prime}7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$\nnortheast from the primary central dominant galaxy, suggesting the merger is in\nthe plane of the sky. We measure temperature and density ratios across these\nedges, confirming they are sloshing cold fronts. We observe the eastern edge of\nthe subcluster infall shock, confirming the observed subcluster is traveling\nfrom the southwest to the northeast in a clockwise orbit. We measure a shock\ndensity contrast of $1.38^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ and infer a Mach number\n$1.25\\pm0.08$ and a shock velocity of $2810^{+210}_{-240}$ km s$^{-1}$.\nTemperature and entropy maps show cool, low entropy gas trailing the subcluster\nin a southwestern tail, consistent with core shredding. Simulations suggest a\nperturber in the plane of the sky on a clockwise orbit would produce a sloshing\nspiral winding counterclockwise, opposite to that observed. The most compelling\nsolution to this discrepancy is that the observed southeastern subcluster is on\nits first passage, shock heating gas during its clockwise infall, while the\nmain cluster's clockwise cold front spiral formed from earlier encounters with\na second perturber orbiting counterclockwise.\n", "  It is believed that, in radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN), the core\nradio flux density can be normalized to the flux density of the extended lobe\nemission to infer the orientation of a radio source. However very little is\nknown about the reliability and precision of this method, and we are unaware of\nany robust conversion recipe to infer the inclination from the core dominance.\nInvestigating whether or not the radio core dominance parameter R separates the\nquasars from the radio-galaxies in the $z \\ge$~1 3CRR catalog, we found\nexcellent agreement of R with optical type, infrared flux ratios and optical\npolarization. This indicates that probably both R and optical classification\nare very good orientation indicators, and the unified model is strongly\npredictive for these objects. The relative number densities indicate\nhalf-opening angles close to 60$^\\circ$, as expected from large surveys. The\nseparations of optical types according to radio core dominance as well as\nNIR/MIR ratios, which are essentially perfect, means that there can be only a\nsmall dispersion of torus half-opening angles. Also, even though torus dust is\nthought to be clumpy, there is an almost zero probability to see a type-1\nsource at high inclination. Finally, using only the Copernican Principle, i,e,\nthe assumption that solid angle is filled uniformly with source axis\norientations, we estimated a semi-empirical relation between core dominance and\nAGN inclination. This makes it possible to use R to infer the inclination of a\nsource to an accuracy of $\\sim$ 10 degrees or less, at least for this type of\nobject.\n", "  The intensity of the \\oiv~2s$^{2}$ 2p $^{2}$P-2s2p$^{2}$ $^{4}$P and \\siv~3\ns$^{2}$ 3p $^{2}$P- 3s 3p$^{2}$ $^{4}$ P intercombination lines around\n1400~\\AA~observed with the \\textit{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph}\n(IRIS) provide a useful tool to diagnose the electron number density\n($N_\\textrm{e}$) in the solar transition region plasma. We measure the electron\nnumber density in a variety of solar features observed by IRIS, including an\nactive region (AR) loop, plage and brightening, and the ribbon of the\n22-June-2015 M 6.5 class flare. By using the emissivity ratios of \\oiv\\ and\n\\siv\\ lines, we find that our observations are consistent with the emitting\nplasma being near isothermal (log$T$[K] $\\approx$ 5) and iso-density\n($N_\\textrm{e}$ $\\approx$~10$^{10.6}$ cm$^{-3}$) in the AR loop. Moreover, high\nelectron number densities ($N_\\textrm{e}$ $\\approx$~10$^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$) are\nobtained during the impulsive phase of the flare by using the \\siv\\ line ratio.\nWe note that the \\siv\\ lines provide a higher range of density sensitivity than\nthe \\oiv\\ lines. Finally, we investigate the effects of high densities\n($N_\\textrm{e}$ $\\gtrsim$ 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) on the ionization balance. In\nparticular, the fractional ion abundances are found to be shifted towards lower\ntemperatures for high densities compared to the low density case. We also\nexplored the effects of a non-Maxwellian electron distribution on our\ndiagnostic method.\n", "  The prediction of the arrival time for fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and\ntheir associated shocks is highly desirable in space weather studies. In this\npaper, we use two shock propagation models, i.e. Data Guided Shock Time Of\nArrival (DGSTOA) and Data Guided Shock Propagation Model (DGSPM), to predict\nthe kinematical evolution of interplanetary shocks associated with fast CMEs.\nDGSTOA is based on the similarity theory of shock waves in the solar wind\nreference frame, and DGSPM on the non-similarity theory in the stationary\nreference frame. The inputs are the kinematics of the CME front at the maximum\nspeed moment obtained from the geometric triangulation method applied to STEREO\nimaging observations together with the Harmonic Mean approximation. The outputs\nprovide the subsequent propagation of the associated shock. We apply these\nmodels to the CMEs on 2012 January 19, January 23, and March 7. We find that\nthe shock models predict reasonably well the shock's propagation after the\nimpulsive acceleration. The shock's arrival time and local propagation speed at\nEarth predicted by these models are consistent with in situ measurements of\nWIND. We also employ the Drag-Based Model (DBM) as a comparison, and find that\nit predicts a steeper deceleration than the shock models after the rapid\ndeceleration phase. The predictions of DBM at 1 AU agree with the following\nICME or sheath structure, not the preceding shock. These results demonstrate\nthe applicability of the shock models used here for future arrival time\nprediction of interplanetary shocks associated with fast CMEs.\n", "  We investigated the formation of the Mg II h-k doublet in a weakly magnetized\natmosphere (20-100 G) using a newly developed numerical code for polarized RT\nin a plane-parallel geometry, which implements a recent formulation of\npartially coherent scattering by polarized multi-term atoms in arbitrary\nmagnetic field regimes. Our results confirm the importance of partial\nredistribution effects in the formation of the Mg II h and k lines, as pointed\nout by previous work in the non-magnetic case. We show that the presence of a\nmagnetic field can produce measurable modifications of the broadband linear\npolarization even for relatively small field strengths (~10 G), while the\ncircular polarization remains well represented by the classical magnetograph\nformula. Both these results open an important new window for the weak-field\ndiagnostics of the upper solar atmosphere.\n", "  The consistency of planet formation models suffers from the disconnection\nbetween the regime of small and large bodies. This is primarily caused by\nso-called growth barriers: the direct growth of larger bodies is halted at\ncentimetre-sized objects and particular conditions are required for the\nformation of larger, gravitationally bound planetesimals. We aim to connect\nmodels of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of\nprotoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized\nbodies and the first planetary embryos. We combine semi-analytical models of\nviscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including\nbackreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how\nplanetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its\ninitial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. We find that the\ndust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up\nof pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming\ninstability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge\nlying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The\nresulting surface density of planetesimals follows a radial profile that is\nmuch steeper than the initial disc profile. These results support formation of\nterrestrial planets in the solar system from a narrow annulus of planetesimals,\nwhich reproduces their peculiar mass ratios.\n", "  We present deep polarimetric observations at 154 MHz with the Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA), covering 625 deg^2 centered on RA=0 h, Dec=-27 deg. The\nsensitivity available in our deep observations allows an in-band,\nfrequency-dependent analysis of polarized structure for the first time at long\nwavelengths. Our analysis suggests that the polarized structures are dominated\nby intrinsic emission but may also have a foreground Faraday screen component.\nAt these wavelengths, the compactness of the MWA baseline distribution provides\nexcellent snapshot sensitivity to large-scale structure. The observations are\nsensitive to diffuse polarized emission at ~54' resolution with a sensitivity\nof 5.9 mJy beam^-1 and compact polarized sources at ~2.4' resolution with a\nsensitivity of 2.3 mJy beam^-1 for a subset (400 deg^2) of this field. The\nsensitivity allows the effect of ionospheric Faraday rotation to be spatially\nand temporally measured directly from the diffuse polarized background. Our\nobservations reveal large-scale structures (~1 deg - 8 deg in extent) in linear\npolarization clearly detectable in ~2 minute snapshots, which would remain\nundetectable by interferometers with minimum baseline lengths >110 m at 154\nMHz. The brightness temperature of these structures is on average 4 K in\npolarized intensity, peaking at 11 K. Rotation measure synthesis reveals that\nthe structures have Faraday depths ranging from -2 rad m^-2 to 10 rad m^-2 with\na large fraction peaking at ~+1 rad m^-2. We estimate a distance of 51+/-20 pc\nto the polarized emission based on measurements of the in-field pulsar\nJ2330-2005. We detect four extragalactic linearly polarized point sources\nwithin the field in our compact source survey. Based on the known polarized\nsource population at 1.4 GHz and non-detections at 154 MHz, we estimate an\nupper limit on the depolarization ratio of 0.08 from 1.4 GHz to 154 MHz.\n", "  Aims. We present an innovative artificial neural network (ANN) architecture,\ncalled Generative ANN (GANN), that computes the forward model, that is it\nlearns the function that relates the unknown outputs (stellar atmospheric\nparameters, in this case) to the given inputs (spectra). Such a model can be\nintegrated in a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of\nthe outputs. Methods. The architecture of the GANN follows the same scheme as a\nnormal ANN, but with the inputs and outputs inverted. We train the network with\nthe set of atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]),\nobtaining the stellar spectra for such inputs. The residuals between the\nspectra in the grid and the estimated spectra are minimized using a validation\ndataset to keep solutions as general as possible. Results. The performance of\nboth conventional ANNs and GANNs to estimate the stellar parameters as a\nfunction of the star brightness is presented and compared for different\nGalactic populations. GANNs provide significantly improved parameterizations\nfor early and intermediate spectral types with rich and intermediate\nmetallicities. The behaviour of both algorithms is very similar for our sample\nof late-type stars, obtaining residuals in the derivation of [Fe/H] and\n[alpha/Fe] below 0.1dex for stars with Gaia magnitude Grvs<12, which accounts\nfor a number in the order of four million stars to be observed by the Radial\nVelocity Spectrograph of the Gaia satellite. Conclusions. Uncertainty\nestimation of computed astrophysical parameters is crucial for the validation\nof the parameterization itself and for the subsequent exploitation by the\nastronomical community. GANNs produce not only the parameters for a given\nspectrum, but a goodness-of-fit between the observed spectrum and the predicted\none for a given set of parameters. Moreover, they allow us to obtain the full\nposterior distribution...\n", "  NGC 2420 is a $\\sim$2 Gyr-old well-populated open cluster that lies about 2\nkpc beyond the solar circle, in the general direction of the Galactic\nanti-center. Most previous abundance studies have found this cluster to be\nmildly metal-poor, but with a large scatter in the obtained metallicities for\nthis open cluster. Detailed chemical abundance distributions are derived for 12\nred-giant members of NGC 2420 via a manual abundance analysis of\nhigh-resolution (R = 22,500) near-infrared ($\\lambda$1.5 - 1.7$\\mu$m) spectra\nobtained from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE) survey. The sample analyzed contains 6 stars that are identified as\nmembers of the first-ascent red giant branch (RGB), as well as 6 members of the\nred clump (RC). We find small scatter in the star-to-star abundances in NGC\n2420, with a mean cluster abundance of [Fe/H] = -0.16 $\\pm$ 0.04 for the 12 red\ngiants. The internal abundance dispersion for all elements (C, N, O, Na, Mg,\nAl, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ni) is also very small ($\\sim$0.03 - 0.06\ndex), indicating a uniform cluster abundance distribution within the\nuncertainties. NGC 2420 is one of the clusters used to calibrate the APOGEE\nStellar Parameter and Chemical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP). The results from\nthis manual analysis compare well with ASPCAP abundances for most of the\nelements studied, although for Na, Al and V there are more significant offsets.\nNo evidence of extra-mixing at the RGB luminosity bump is found in the $^{12}$C\nand $^{14}$N abundances from the pre-luminosity-bump RGB stars in comparison to\nthe post-He core-flash RC stars.\n", "  By adopting the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry, a holographic model\nfor the baryon octet is proposed. The mass spectra of the baryon octet and\ntheir low-lying excited states are calculated, which show good consistency with\nexperiments. The couplings of pion to nucleons are derived in two gauges and\nare shown to be equivalent with each other. It also shows that only derivative\ncouplings of pion to nucleons appear in this holographic model. The coupling\nconstant is then calculated.\n", "  Very faint X-ray binaries appear to be transient in many cases with peak\nluminosities much fainter than that of usual soft X-ray transients, but their\nnature still remains elusive. We investigate the possibility that this\ntransient behaviour is due to the same thermal/viscous instability which is\nresponsible for outbursts of bright soft X-ray transients, occurring in\nultracompact binaries for adequately low mass-transfer rates. More generally,\nwe investigate the observational consequences of this instability when it\noccurs in ultracompact binaries. We use our code for modelling the\nthermal-viscous instability of the accretion disc, assumed here to be hydrogen\npoor. We also take into account the effects of disc X-ray irradiation, and\nconsider the impact of the mass-transfer rate on the outburst brightness. We\nfind that one can reproduce the observed properties of both the very faint and\nthe brighter short transients (peak luminosity, duration, recurrence times),\nprovided that the viscosity parameter in quiescence is slightly smaller\n(typically a factor of between two and four) than in bright soft X-ray\ntransients and normal dwarf nova outbursts, the viscosity in outburst being\nunchanged. This possibly reflects the impact of chemical composition on\nnon-ideal MHD effects affecting magnetically driven turbulence in poorly\nionized discs.\n", "  The influence of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the magnetic dipole term\n$T_{\\alpha}$ is studied across a range of systems in order to check whether the\n$T_{\\alpha}$ term can be eliminated from analysis of x-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism spectra done via the spin moment sum rule. Fully relativistic\nKorringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) Green function calculations for Co monolayers and\nadatoms on Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au (111) surfaces were performed to verify\nwhether the sum over magnetic dipole terms $T_{x}+T_{y}+T_{z}$ is zero and\nwhether the angular dependence of the \\ta\\ term goes as $3\\cos^{2}\\theta-1$. It\nfollows that there are circumstances when the influence of the SOC on\n$T_{\\alpha}$ cannot be neglected even for 3$d$ atoms, where the SOC is\nnominally small. The crucial factor appears to be the dimensionality of the\nsystem: for 3$d$ adatoms, the influence of SOC on $T_{\\alpha}$ can be\nsignificant while for monolayers it is always practically negligible. Apart\nfrom the dimensionality, hybridization between adatom and substrate states is\nalso important: small hybridization enhances the importance of the SOC and vice\nversa.\n", "  We present spectra of 14 A-type supergiants in the metal-rich spiral galaxy\nM83. We derive stellar parameters and metallicities, and measure a\nspectroscopic distance modulus m-M = 28.47 +\\- 0.10 (4.9 +\\- 0.2 Mpc), in\nagreement with other methods. We use the stellar characteristic metallicity of\nM83 and other systems to discuss a version of the galaxy mass-metallicity\nrelation that is independent of the analysis of nebular emission lines and the\nassociated systematic uncertainties. We reproduce the radial metallicity\ngradient of M83, which flattens at large radii, with a chemical evolution\nmodel, constraining gas inflow and outflow processes. We carry out a\ncomparative analysis of the metallicities we derive from the stellar spectra\nand published HII region line fluxes, utilizing both the direct, Te-based\nmethod and different strong-line abundance diagnostics. The direct abundances\nare in relatively good agreement with the stellar metallicities, once we apply\na modest correction to the nebular oxygen abundance due to depletion onto dust.\nPopular empirically calibrated strong-line diagnostics tend to provide nebular\nabundances that underestimate the stellar metallicities above the solar value\nby ~0.2 dex. This result could be related to difficulties in selecting\ncalibration samples at high metallicity. The O3N2 method calibrated by Pettini\nand Pagel gives the best agreement with our stellar metallicities. We confirm\nthat metal recombination lines yield nebular abundances that agree with the\nstellar abundances for high metallicity systems, but find evidence that in more\nmetal-poor environments they tend to underestimate the stellar metallicities by\na significant amount, opposite to the behavior of the direct method.\n", "  The non-equilibrium dynamics of trapped ultracold atomic gases, or mixtures\nthereof, is an extremely rich subject. Despite 20 years of studies, and\nremarkable progress mainly on the experimental front, numerous open question\nremain, related to the growth, relaxation and thermalisation of such systems,\nand there is still no universally-accepted theory for their theoretical\ndescription. In this paper we discuss one of the state-of-the-art kinetic\napproaches, which gives an intuitive picture of the physical processes\nhappening at the microscopic scale, being broadly applicable both below and\nabove the critical region (but not within the critical region itself).\nSpecifically, the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin (ZNG) scheme provides a\nself-consistent description of the coupling between the condensate and the\nthermal atoms, including the collisions between these two subsystems. It has\nbeen successfully tested against experiments in various settings, including\ncollective modes (e.g. monopole, dipole and quadrupole modes), topological\nexcitations (solitons and vortices) and surface evaporative cooling. Here, we\nshow that it can capture two important aspects of non- equilibrium dynamics for\nboth single-component and two-component BECs: the Kohn mode (the undamped\ndipole oscillation independent of interactions and temperature) and\n(re)thermalization leading to condensate growth following sudden evaporation.\nOur simulations, performed in a spherically-symmetric trap reveal (i) an\ninteresting two-stage dynamics and the emergence of a prominent monopole mode\nin the evaporative cooling of a single component Bose gas, and (ii) the long\nthermalization time associated with the sympathetic cooling of a realistic\ntwo-component mixture. Related open questions arise about the mechanisms and\nthe nature of thermalization in such systems, where further controlled\nexperiments are needed for benchmarking.\n", "  Single-shot recording of terahertz electric signals has recently become\npossible at high repetition rates, by using the photonic time-stretch\nelectro-optic sampling (EOS) technique. However the moderate sensitivity of\ntime-stretch EOS is still a strong limit for a range of applications. Here we\npresent a variant enabling to increase the sensitivity of photonic time-stretch\nfor free-propagating THz signals. A key point is to integrate the idea\npresented in Ref. [Ahmed et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 85, 013114 (2014)], for\nupgrading classical time-stretch systems. The method is tested using the high\nrepetition rate terahertz coherent synchrotron radiation source (CSR) of the\nSOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility. The signal-to-noise ratio of our\nterahertz digitizer could thus be straightforwardly improved by a factor\n$\\approx 6.5$, leading to a noise-equivalent input electric field below\n$1.25$~V/cm inside the electro-optic crystal, over the 0-300~GHz band (i.e,\n2.3~$\\mu$V/cm/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$). The sensitivity is scalable with respect to\nthe available laser power, potentially enabling further sensitivity\nimprovements when needed.\n", "  In this paper we perform a systematic study of spatially flat\n[(3+D)+1]-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmological models with\n$\\Lambda$-term. We consider models that topologically are the product of two\nflat isotropic subspaces with different scale factors. One of these subspaces\nis three-dimensional and represents our space and the other is D-dimensional\nand represents extra dimensions. We consider no {\\it Ansatz} on the scale\nfactors, which makes our results quite general. With both Einstein-Hilbert and\nGauss-Bonnet contributions in play, the cases with $D=1$ and $D=2$ have\ndifferent dynamics due to the different structure of the equations of motion.\nWe analytically study equations of motion in both cases and describe all\npossible regimes. It is demonstrated that $D=1$ case does not have physically\nviable regimes while $D=2$ has smooth transition from high-energy Kasner to\nanisotropic exponential regime. This transition occurs for two ranges of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\Lambda$: $\\alpha > 0$, $\\Lambda > 0$ with $\\alpha \\Lambda\n\\leqslant 1/2$ and $\\alpha < 0$, $\\Lambda > 0$ with $\\alpha\\Lambda < -3/2$. For\nthe latter case if $\\alpha\\Lambda = -3/2$, extra dimensional part has $h\\to 0$\nand so the size of extra dimensions (in the sense of the scale factor) is\nreaching constant value. We report substantial differences between $D=1$ and\n$D=2$ cases and between these cases and their vacuum counterparts, describe\nfeatures of the cases under study and discuss the origin of the differences.\n", "  In this paper we describe a method for finding polynomial invariants under\nStochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication (SLOCC), for a system\nof delocalized fermions shared between different parties, with global particle\nnumber conservation as the only constraint. These invariants can be used to\nconstruct entanglement measures for different types of entanglement in such a\nsystem. It is shown that the invariants, and the measures constructed from\nthem, take a nonzero value only if the state of the system allows for the\nobservation of Bell-nonlocal correlations. Invariants of this kind are\nconstructed for systems of two and three spin-1/2 fermions and examples of\nmaximally entangled states are given that illustrate the different types of\nentanglement distinguished by the invariants. A general condition for the\nexistence of SLOCC invariants and their associated measures is given as a\nrelation between the number of fermions, their spin, and the number of spatial\nmodes of the system. In addition, the effect of further constraints on the\nsystem, including the localization of a subset of the fermions, is discussed.\nFinally, a hybrid Ising-Hubbard Hamiltonian is constructed for which the\ngroundstate of a three site chain exhibits a high degree of entanglement at the\ntransition between a regime dominated by on-site interaction and a regime\ndominated by Ising-interaction. This entanglement is well described by a\nmeasure constructed by the introduced method.\n", "  In molecular photodissociation, some specific combinations of laser\nparameters (wavelength and intensity) lead to unexpected Zero-Width Resonances\n(ZWR), with in principle infinite lifetimes. Their interest in inducing basic\nquenching mechanisms have recently been devised in the laser control of\nvibrational cooling through filtration strategies [O. Atabek et al., Phys. Rev.\nA87, 031403(R) (2013)]. A full quantum adiabatic control theory based on the\nadiabatic Floquet Hamiltonian is developed to show how a laser pulse could be\nenvelop-shaped and frequency-chirped so as to protect a given initial\nvibrational state against dissociation, taking advantage from its continuous\ntransport on the corresponding ZWR, all along the pulse duration. As compared\nwith previous control scenarios actually suffering from non-adiabatic\ncontamination, drastically different and much more efficient filtration goals\nare achieved. A semiclassical analysis helps in finding and interpreting a\ncomplete map of ZWRs in the laser parameter plane. In addition, the choice of a\ngiven ZWR path, among the complete series identified by the semiclassical\napproach, amounts to be crucial for the cooling scheme, targeting a single\nvibrational state population left at the end of the pulse, while all others\nhave almost completely decayed. The illustrative example, offering the\npotentiality to be transposed to other diatomics, is Na2 prepared by\nphotoassociation in vibrationally hot but translationally and rotationally cold\nstates.\n", "  We study the quantum phase diagram of a system of hard-core bosons on the\nKagome lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions, for arbitrary\ndensities, by means of the hierarchical mean field theory and exact\ndiagonalization techniques. This system is isomorphic to the spin S=1/2 XXZ\nmodel in presence of an external magnetic field, a paradigmatic example of\nfrustrated quantum magnetism. In the non-frustrated regime, we find two crystal\nphases at densities 1/3 and 2/3 that melt into a superfluid phase when\nincreasing the hopping amplitude, in semi-quantitative agreement with quantum\nMonte Carlo computations. In the frustrated regime and away from half-filling,\nwe find a series of plateaux with densities commensurate with powers of 1/3.\nThe broader density plateaux (at densities 1/3 and 2/3) are remnants of the\nclassical degeneracy in the Ising limit. For densities near half-filling, this\nstaircase of crystal phases melts into a superfluid, which displays finite\nchiral currents when computed with clusters having an odd number of sites. Both\nthe staircase of crystal phases and the superfluid phase prevail in the\nnon-interacting limit, suggesting that the lowest dispersionless\nsingle-particle band may be at the root of this phenomenon.\n", "  Brown dwarf disks are excellent laboratories to test our understanding of\ndisk physics in an extreme parameter regime. In this paper we investigate a\nsample of 29 well-characterized brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, for which\nHerschel far-infrared fluxes as well as (sub)-mm fluxes are available. We have\nmeasured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with\n(sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their\nspectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative\ntransfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the\nshape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the\n(sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear\ncorrelation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link\nresults from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a\nscaling between disk mass and stellar mass. We find strong evidence of dust\nsettling to the disk midplane. The spectral slopes between near- and\nfar-infrared are mostly between $-0.5$ and $-1.2$ in our sample, comparable to\nmore massive T Tauri stars, which may imply that the disk shapes are similar as\nwell, though highly-flared disks are rare among brown dwarfs. We find that dust\ntemperatures in the range of 7-15 K, calculated with\n$T\\approx25\\,(L/L_\\odot)^{0.25}$ K, are appropriate for deriving disk masses\nfrom (sub)-mm fluxes for these low luminosity objects. About half of our sample\nhosts disks with at least one Jupiter mass, confirming that many brown dwarfs\nharbour sufficient material for the formation of Earth-mass planets in their\nmidst.\n", "  We present deep SINFONI K band integral field spectra of two submillimeter\n(SMG) galaxy systems: BR 1202-0725 and J1000+0234, at $z=4.69$ and $4.55$\nrespectively. Spectra extracted for each object in the two systems do not show\nany signature of the [O II]$\\lambda\\lambda$3726,29\\AA$\\,$ emission-lines,\nplacing upper flux limits of $3.9$ and $2.5 \\times 10^{-18}\\,$${\\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}\\,\\,cm^{-2} \\,}$ for BR 1202-0725 and J1000+0234, respectively.\nUsing the relation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the luminosity of\nthe [O II] doublet from Kennicutt (1998), we estimate unobscured SFR upper\nlimits of $\\sim$ $10-15\\,\\rm M_\\odot\\,yr^{-1} \\,$ and $\\sim$ $30-40\\,\\rm\nM_\\odot\\,yr^{-1} \\,$ for the objects of the two systems, respectively. For the\nSMGs, these values are at least two orders of magnitude lower than those\nderived from SED and IR luminosities. The differences on the SFR values would\ncorrespond to internal extinction of, at least, $3.4 - 4.9$ and $2.1 - 3.6$ mag\nin the visual for BR 1202-0725 and J1000+0234 SMGs, respectively. The upper\nlimit for the [O II]-derived SFR in one of the LAEs (Ly$\\alpha2$) in the\nBR1202-0725 system is at least one order of magnitude lower than the previous\nSFR derived from infrared tracers, while both estimates are in good agreement\nfor Ly$\\alpha$1. The lower limits to the internal extinction in these two\nLyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) are $0.6$ mag and $1.3$ mag, respectively. No\nevidence for the previously claimed (Ohta et al. 2000) [O II] emission\nassociated with Ly$\\alpha$1 is identified in our data, implying that residuals\nof the K-band sky emission lines after subtraction in medium-band imaging data\ncould provide the adequate flux.\n", "  We derive the luminosity function and redshift distribution of short Gamma\nRay Bursts (SGRBs) using (i) all the available observer-frame constraints (i.e.\npeak flux, fluence, peak energy and duration distributions) of the large\npopulation of Fermi SGRBs and (ii) the rest-frame properties of a complete\nsample of Swift SGRBs. We show that a steep $\\phi(L)\\propto L^{-a}$ with a>2.0\nis excluded if the full set of constraints is considered. We implement a Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain method to derive the $\\phi(L)$ and $\\psi(z)$ functions\nassuming intrinsic Ep-Liso and Ep-Eiso correlations or independent\ndistributions of intrinsic peak energy, luminosity and duration. To make our\nresults independent from assumptions on the progenitor (NS-NS binary mergers or\nother channels) and from uncertainties on the star formation history, we assume\na parametric form for the redshift distribution of SGRBs. We find that a\nrelatively flat luminosity function with slope ~0.5 below a characteristic\nbreak luminosity ~3$\\times10^{52}$ erg/s and a redshift distribution of SGRBs\npeaking at z~1.5-2 satisfy all our constraints. These results hold also if no\nEp-Liso and Ep-Eiso correlations are assumed. We estimate that, within ~200 Mpc\n(i.e. the design aLIGO range for the detection of GW produced by NS-NS merger\nevents), 0.007-0.03 SGRBs yr$^{-1}$ should be detectable as gamma-ray events.\nAssuming current estimates of NS-NS merger rates and that all NS-NS mergers\nlead to a SGRB event, we derive a conservative estimate of the average opening\nangle of SGRBs: $\\theta_{jet}$~3-6 deg. Our luminosity function implies an\naverage luminosity L~1.5$\\times 10^{52}$ erg/s, nearly two orders of magnitude\nhigher than previous findings, which greatly enhances the chance of observing\nSGRB \"orphan\" afterglows. Efforts should go in the direction of finding and\nidentifying such orphan afterglows as counterparts of GW events.\n", "  Casimir entropies due to quantum fluctuations in the interaction between\nelectrical bodies can often be negative, either caused by dissipation or by\ngeometry. Although generally such entropies vanish at zero temperature,\nconsistent with the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem),\nthere is a region in the space of temperature and separation between the bodies\nwhere negative entropy occurs, while positive interaction entropies arise for\nlarge distances or temperatures. Systematic studies on this phenomenon in the\nCasimir-Polder interaction between a polarizable nanoparticle or atom and a\nconducting plate in the dipole approximation have been given recently. Since\nthe total entropy should be positive according to the second law of\nthermodynamics, we expect that the self-entropy of the bodies would be\nsufficiently positive as to overwhelm the negative interaction entropy. This\nexpectation, however, has not been explicitly verified. Here we compute the\nself-entropy of an electromagnetic $\\delta$-function plate, which corresponds\nto a perfectly conducting sheet in the strong coupling limit. The transverse\nelectric contribution to the self-entropy is negative, while the transverse\nmagnetic contribution is larger and positive, so the total self-entropy is\npositive. However, this self-entropy vanishes in the strong-coupling limit. In\nthat case, it is the self-entropy of the nanoparticle that is just sufficient\nto result in a nonnegative total entropy.\n", "  Models of nova outbursts suggest that an X-ray flash should occur just after\nhydrogen ignition. However, this X-ray flash has never been observationally\nconfirmed. We present four theoretical light curves of the X-ray flash for two\nvery massive white dwarfs (WDs) of 1.380 and 1.385 M_sun and for two recurrence\nperiods of 0.5 and 1 years. The duration of the X-ray flash is shorter for a\nmore massive WD and for a longer recurrence period. The shortest duration of 14\nhours (0.6 days) among the four cases is obtained for the 1.385 M_sun WD with\none year recurrence period. In general, a nova explosion is relatively weak for\na very short recurrence period, which results in a rather slow evolution toward\nthe optical peak. This slow timescale and the predictability of very short\nrecurrence period novae give us a chance to observe X-ray flashes of recurrent\nnovae. In this context, we report the first attempt, using the Swift\nobservatory, to detect an X-ray flash of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a (0.5\nor 1 year recurrence period), which resulted in the non-detection of X-ray\nemission during the period of 8 days before the optical detection. We discuss\nthe impact of these observations on nova outburst theory. The X-ray flash is\none of the last frontiers of nova studies and its detection is essentially\nimportant to understand the pre-optical-maximum phase. We encourage further\nobservations.\n", "  Gas plays a major role in the dynamical evolution of young stellar objects.\nIts interaction with the dust is the key to our understanding planet formation\nlater on in the protoplanetary disc stage. Studying the gas content is a\ncrucial step towards understanding YSO and planet formation. Such a study can\nbe made through spectroscopic observations of emission lines in the\nfar-infrared, where some of the most important gas coolants emit. We provide a\ncompilation of observations of far-IR lines in 362 young stellar objects\ncovering all evolutionary stages, from Class 0 to Class III with debris discs.\nIn the present paper we focus on [OI] and o-H2O emission at 63 microns. We have\nretrieved all the available Herschel -PACS spectroscopic observations at 63\nmicrons that used the dominant observing mode, the chop-nod technique. We\nprovide measurements of line fluxes for the [OI] 3P1-3P2 and o-H2O 808-717\ntransitions at 63 microns computed using different methods. We check for\nspatially extended emission and further study the presence of multiple\ndynamical components in line emission. The final compilation consists of line\nand continuum fluxes at 63 microns for a total of 362 young stellar objects\n(YSOs). We detected [OI] line emission at 63 microns in 194 sources out of 362,\nand line absorption in another five sources. o-H2O was detected in 42 sources.\nWe find evidence of extended [OI] emission in 77 sources, and detect 3sigma\nresidual emission in 71 of them. We also looked for different components\ncontributing to the line emission, and found evidence for multiple components\nin 30 sources. We explored correlations between line emission and continuum\nemission and find a clear correlation between WISE fluxes from 4.6 to 22\nmicrons and [OI] line emission. We conclude that the observed emission is\ntypically a combination of disc/envelope and jet emission.\n", "  The 70-month Swift/BAT catalogue provides a sensitive view of the\nextragalactic X-ray sky at hard energies (>10 keV) containing about 800 Active\nGalactic Nuclei. We explore its content in heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGN\nby combining the BAT (14-195 keV) with the lower energy XRT (0.3-10 keV) data.\nWe apply a Bayesian methodology using Markov chains to estimate the exact\nprobability distribution of the column density for each source. We find 53\npossible Compton-thick sources (with probability 3 to 100%) translating to a\n~7% fraction of the AGN in our sample. We derive the first parametric\nluminosity function of Compton-thick AGN. The unabsorbed luminosity function\ncan be represented by a double power-law with a break at $L_{\\star} 2 \\times\n10^{42}$ $\\rm ergs~s^{-1}$ in the 20-40 keV band.\n", "  We solve the Laplace equation $\\Box h_{ij}=0$ describing the propagation of\ngravitational waves in an expanding background metric with a power law scale\nfactor in the presence of a point mass in the weak field approximation\n(Newtonian McVittie background). We use boundary conditions at large distances\nfrom the mass corresponding to a standing spherical gravitational wave in an\nexpanding background which is equivalent to a linear combination of an incoming\nand an outgoing propagating gravitational wave. We compare the solution with\nthe corresponding solution in the absence of the point mass and show that the\npoint mass increases the amplitude of the wave and also decreases its frequency\n(as observed by an observer at infinity) in accordance with gravitational time\ndelay.\n", "  More than 3000 exoplanets have been detected so far, and more and more\nspectroscopic observations of exoplanets are performed. Future instruments are\neagerly awaited as they will be able to provide spectroscopic data with a\ngreater accuracy and sensitivity than what is currently available. An important\naspect to consider is temporal stellar atmospheric disturbances that can\ninfluence the planetary composition, and hence spectra, and potentially can\nlead to incorrect assumptions about the steady-state atmospheric composition of\nthe planet. We focus on perturbations that come from the host star in the form\nof flare events that significantly increase the photon flux impingement on the\nexoplanet atmosphere. In some cases, and particularly for M stars, this sudden\nincrease may last for several hours. We aim at answering the question to what\nextent a stellar flare is able to modify the chemical composition of the\nplanetary atmosphere and, therefore influence the resulting spectra. We use a\n1D thermo-photochemical model to study the neutral atmospheric composition of\ntwo hypothetic planets located around the star AD Leo. This active star has\nalready been observed during a flare. We use the spectroscopic data from this\nflare event to simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of the\natmospheres of the two hypothetic planets. We compute synthetic spectra to\nevaluate the implications for observations. The increase of the incoming photon\nflux affects the chemical abundances of some important species down to\naltitudes associated with an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar, that can lead to\nvariations in planetary spectra if performed during transit.\n", "  We investigate field-induced transformations in the dynamical response of the\n$XXZ$ model on the triangular lattice that are associated with the anharmonic\nmagnon coupling and decay phenomena. A set of concrete theoretical predictions\nis made for a close physical realization of the spin-1/2 $XXZ$ model,\nBa$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$. We demonstrate that dramatic modifications in magnon\nspectrum must occur in low out-of-plane fields that are easily achievable for\nthis material. The hallmark of the effect is a coexistence of the clearly\ndistinct well-defined magnon excitations with significantly broadened ones in\ndifferent regions of the ${\\bf k}-\\omega$ space. The field-induced decays are\ngeneric for this class of models and become more prominent at larger\nanisotropies and in higher fields.\n", "  Radial velocity and transit methods are effective for the study of short\norbital period exoplanets but they hardly probe objects at large separations\nfor which direct imaging can be used. We carried out the international deep\nplanet survey of 292 young nearby stars to search for giant exoplanets and\ndetermine their frequency. We developed a pipeline for a uniform processing of\nall the data that we have recorded with NIRC2/Keck II, NIRI/Gemini North,\nNICI/Gemini South, and NACO/VLT for 14 years. The pipeline first applies\ncosmetic corrections and then reduces the speckle intensity to enhance the\ncontrast in the images. The main result of the international deep planet survey\nis the discovery of the HR 8799 exoplanets. We also detected 59 visual multiple\nsystems including 16 new binary stars and 2 new triple stellar systems, as well\nas 2,279 point-like sources. We used Monte Carlo simulations and the Bayesian\ntheorem to determine that 1.05[+2.80-0.70]% of stars harbor at least one giant\nplanet between 0.5 and 14M_J and between 20 and 300 AU. This result is obtained\nassuming uniform distributions of planet masses and semi-major axes. If we\nconsider power law distributions as measured for close-in planets instead, the\nderived frequency is 2.30[+5.95-1.55]%, recalling the strong impact of\nassumptions on Monte Carlo output distributions. We also find no evidence that\nthe derived frequency depends on the mass of the hosting star, whereas it does\nfor close-in planets. The international deep planet survey provides a database\nof confirmed background sources that may be useful for other exoplanet direct\nimaging surveys. It also puts new constraints on the number of stars with at\nleast one giant planet reducing by a factor of two the frequencies derived by\nalmost all previous works.\n", "  While dozens of stellar mass black holes have been discovered in binary\nsystems, isolated black holes have eluded detection. Their presence can be\ninferred when they lens light from a background star. We attempt to detect the\nastrometric lensing signatures of three photometrically identified microlensing\nevents, OGLE-2011-BLG-0022, OGLE-2011-BLG-0125, and OGLE-2012-BLG-0169\n(OB110022, OB110125, and OB120169), located toward the Galactic Bulge. These\nevents were selected because of their long durations, which statistically\nfavors more massive lenses. Astrometric measurements were made over 1-2 years\nusing laser-guided adaptive optics observations from the W. M. Keck\nObservatory. Lens model parameters were first constrained by the photometric\nlight curves. The OB120169 light curve is well-fit by a single-lens model,\nwhile both OB110022 and OB110125 light curves favor binary-lens models. Using\nthe photometric fits as prior information, no significant astrometric lensing\nsignal was detected and all targets were consistent with linear motion. The\nsignificant lack of astrometric signal constrains the lens mass of OB110022 to\n0.05-1.79 Msun in a 99.7% confidence interval, which disfavors a black hole\nlens. Fits to OB110125 yielded a reduced Einstein crossing time and\ninsufficient observations during the peak, so no mass limits were obtained. Two\ndegenerate solutions exist for OB120169, which have a lens mass between\n0.2-38.8 Msun and 0.4-39.8 Msun for a 99.7% confidence interval. Follow-up\nobservations of OB120169 will further constrain the lens mass. Based on our\nexperience, we use simulations to design optimal astrometric observing\nstrategies and show that, with more typical observing conditions, detection of\nblack holes is feasible.\n", "  By revisiting the Suzaku and XMM-Newton data of the North Polar Spur, we\ndiscovered that the spectra are inconsistent with the traditional model\nconsisting of pure thermal emission and neutral absorption. The most prominent\ndiscrepancies are the enhanced O VII and Ne IX forbidden-to-resonance ratios,\nand a high O VIII Ly$\\beta$ line relative to other Lyman series. A\ncollisionally ionized absorption model can naturally explain both features,\nwhile a charge exchange component can only account for the former. By including\nthe additional ionized absorption, the plasma in the North Polar Spur can be\ndescribed by a single-phase CIE component with temperature of 0.25 keV, and\nnitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, and iron abundances of $0.4-0.8$ solar. The\nabundance pattern of the North Polar Spur is well in line with those of the\nGalactic halo stars. The high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio reported in previous\nstudies can be migrated to the large transmission of the O VIII Ly$\\alpha$\nline. The ionized absorber is characterized by a balance temperature of\n$0.17-0.20$ keV and a column density of $3-5 \\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. Based\non the derived abundances and absorption, we speculate that the North Polar\nSpur is a structure in the Galactic halo, so that the emission is mostly\nabsorbed by Galactic ISM in the line of sight.\n", "  The electrical conductivity of a monolayer produced by the random sequential\nadsorption (RSA) of linear $k$-mers onto a square lattice was studied by means\nof computer simulation. Overlapping with pre-deposited $k$-mers and detachment\nfrom the surface were forbidden. The RSA continued until the saturation jamming\nlimit, $p_j$. The isotropic and anisotropic depositions for two different\nmodels: of an insulating substrate and conducting $k$-mers (C-model) and of a\nconducting substrate and insulating $k$-mers (I-model) were examined. The\nFrank-Lobb algorithm was applied to calculate the electrical conductivity in\nboth the $x$ and $y$ directions for different lengths ($k=1$ -- $128 $) and\nconcentrations ($p=0$ -- $p_j$) of the $k$-mers. The `intrinsic electrical\nconductivity' and concentration dependence of the relative electrical\nconductivity $\\Sigma (p)$ ($\\Sigma=\\sigma/ \\sigma_m$ for the C-model and\n$\\Sigma=\\sigma_m /\\sigma$ for the I-model, where $\\sigma_m$ is the electrical\nconductivity of substrate) in different directions were analyzed. At large\nvalues of $k$ the $\\Sigma (p)$ curves became very similar and they almost\ncoincided at $k=128$. Moreover, for both models the greater the length of the\n$k$-mers the smoother the functions $\\Sigma_{xy}(p)$, $\\Sigma_{x}(p)$ and\n$\\Sigma_{y}(p)$. For the C-model, the other interesting findings are: for large\nvalues of $k$ ($k=64, 128$), the values of $\\Sigma_{xy}$ and $\\Sigma_{y}$\nincrease rapidly with the initial increase of $p$ from 0 to 0.1; for $k \\geq\n16$, all the $\\Sigma_{xy}(p)$ and $\\Sigma_{x}(p)$ curves intersect with each\nother at the same iso-conductivity points; for anisotropic deposition, the\npercolation concentrations are the same in the $x$ and $y$ directions, whereas,\nat the percolation point the greater the length of the $k$-mers the larger the\nanisotropy of the electrical conductivity, i.e., the ratio $\\sigma_y/\\sigma_x$\n($>1$).\n", "  We present the results of a comprehensive numerical simulation of the\nenvironment around three exoplanet-host stars (HD 1237, HD 22049, and HD\n147513). Our simulations consider one of the latest models currently used for\nspace weather studies in the Heliosphere. Large-scale magnetic field maps,\nrecovered with two implementations of the tomographic technique of\nZeeman-Doppler imaging, serve to drive steady-state solutions in each system.\nThis paper contains the description of the stellar wind and inner astrosphere,\nwhile the coronal structure was previously discussed in Alvarado-G\\'omez et al.\n(2016). The analysis includes the magneto-hydrodynamical properties of the\nstellar wind, the associated mass and angular momentum loss rates, as well as\nthe topology of the astrospheric current sheet in each system. A systematic\ncomparison among the considered cases is performed, including two reference\nsolar simulations covering activity minimum and maximum. For HD 1237, we\ninvestigate the interactions between the structure of the developed stellar\nwind, and a possible magnetosphere around the Jupiter-mass planet in this\nsystem. We find that the process of particle injection into the planetary\natmosphere is dominated by the density distribution rather than velocity\nprofile of the stellar wind. In this context, we predict a maximum exoplanetary\nradio emission of 12 mJy at 40 MHz in this system, assuming the crossing of a\nhigh-density streamer during periastron passage. Furthermore, in combination\nwith the analysis performed in Alvarado-G\\'omez et al. (2016), we obtain for\nthe first time a fully simulated mass loss-activity relation, which is compared\nand discussed in the context of the relation based on astrospheric detections\nproposed by Wood et al. (2005a). Finally, we provide a characterisation of the\n3D properties of the stellar wind of these systems, at the inner edges of their\nhabitable zones.\n", "  Starting from a minimal model for a 2D nodal loop semimetal, we study the\neffect of chiral mass gap terms. The resulting Dirac loop anomalous Hall\ninsulator's Chern number is the phase winding number of the mass gap terms on\nthe loop. We provide simple lattice models, analyze the topological phases and\ngeneralize a previous index characterizing topological transitions. The\nresponses of the Dirac loop anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators to\na magnetic field's vector potential are also studied both in weak and strong\nfield regimes, as well as the edge states in a ribbon geometry.\n", "  The spin-1/2 Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain is considered within the\nperturbative strong-coupling approach, which is developed from the exactly\nsolved spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain with the Heisenberg\nintradimer and the Ising interdimer couplings. Although the spin-1/2\nIsing-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain exhibits just intermediate plateaux at\nzero, one-quarter and one-half of the saturation magnetization, the\nperturbative treatment up to second order stemming from this exactly solvable\nmodel additionally corroborates the fractional one-third plateau as well as the\ngapless Luttinger spin-liquid phase. It is evidenced that the approximate\nresults obtained from the strong-coupling approach are in an excellent\nagreement with the state-of-the-art numerical data obtained for the spin-1/2\nHeisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain within the exact diagonalization and\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method. The nature of individual quantum\nground states is comprehensively studied within the developed perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  We present a novel way to investigate scalar field profiles around black\nholes with an accretion disc for a range of models where the Compton wavelength\nof the scalar is large compared to other length scales. By analysing the\nproblem in \"Weyl\" coordinates, we are able to calculate the scalar profiles for\naccretion discs in the static Schwarzschild, as well as rotating Kerr, black\nholes. We comment on observational effects.\n", "  We describe the execution and data reduction of the European Southern\nObservatory Large Programme \"Quasars and their absorption lines: a legacy\nsurvey of the high-redshift universe with VLT/XSHOOTER\" (hereafter `XQ-100').\nXQ-100 has produced and made publicly available an homogeneous and high-quality\nsample of echelle spectra of 100 QSOs at redshifts z~3.5-4.5 observed with full\nspectral coverage from 315 to 2500 nm at a resolving power ranging from R~4000\nto 7000, depending on wavelength. The median signal-to-noise ratios are 33, 25\nand 43, as measured at rest-frame wavelengths 1700, 3000 and 3600 Angstrom,\nrespectively. This paper provides future users of XQ-100 data with the basic\nstatistics of the survey, along with details of target selection, data\nacquisition and data reduction. The paper accompanies the public release of all\ndata products, including 100 reduced spectra. XQ-100 is the largest\nspectroscopic survey to date of high-redshift QSOs with simultaneous rest-frame\nUV/optical coverage, and as such enables a wide range of extragalactic\nresearch, from cosmology and galaxy evolution to AGN astrophysics.\n", "  Type III and type-III-like radio bursts are produced by energetic electron\nbeams guided along coronal magnetic fields. As a variant of type III bursts,\nType N bursts appear as the letter \"N\" in the radio dynamic spectrum and reveal\na magnetic mirror effect in coronal loops. Here, we report a well-observed\nN-shaped burst consisting of three successive branches at metric wavelength\nwith both fundamental and harmonic components and a high brightness temperature\n($>$10$^9$ K). We verify the burst as a true type N burst generated by the same\nelectron beam from three aspects of the data. First, durations of the three\nbranches at a given frequency increase gradually, may due to the dispersion of\nthe beam along its path. Second, the flare site, as the only possible source of\nnon-thermal electrons, is near the western feet of large-scale closed loops.\nThird, the first branch and the following two branches are localized at\ndifferent legs of the loops with opposite sense of polarization. We also find\nthat the sense of polarization of the radio burst is in contradiction to the\nO-mode and there exists a fairly large time delay ($\\sim$3-5 s) between the\nfundamental and harmonic components. Possible explanations accounting for these\nobservations are presented. Assuming the classical plasma emission mechanism,\nwe can infer coronal parameters such as electron density and magnetic field\nnear the radio source and make diagnostics on the magnetic mirror process.\n", "  We performed a diabatization of the mutually perturbed $1^1\\Pi$ and $2^1\\Pi$\nstates of KRb based on both electronic structure calculation and direct\ncoupled-channel deperturbation analysis of experimental energies. The potential\nenergy curves (PECs) of the diabatic states and their scalar coupling were\nconstructed from the \\textit{ab initio} adiabatic PECs by analytically\nintegrating the radial $\\langle \\psi_1^{ad}|\\partial /\\partial\nR|\\psi_2^{ad}\\rangle$ matrix element obtained by a finite-difference method.\nThe diabatic potentials and electronic coupling function were refined by the\nleast squares fitting of the rovibronic termvalues of the $1^1\\Pi\\sim 2^1\\Pi$\ncomplex. The empirical PECs combined with the coupling function as well as the\ndiabatized spin-orbit coupling and transition dipole matrix elements are useful\nfor further deperturbation treatment of both singlet and triplet states\nmanifold.\n", "  We calculate the width of the delta resonance at leading two-loop order in\nbaryon chiral perturbation theory. This gives a correlation between the leading\npion-nucleon-delta and pion-delta couplings, which is relevant for the analysis\nof pion-nucleon scattering and other processes.\n", "  Scalar particles are a common prediction of many beyond the Standard Model\ntheories. If they are light and cold enough, there is a possibility they may\nform Bose-Einstein condensates, which will then become gravitationally bound.\nThese boson stars are solitonic solutions to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon\nequations, but may be approximated in the non-relativistic regime with a\ncoupled Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson system. General properties of single soliton\nstates are derived, including the possibility of quartic self-interactions.\nBinary collisions between two solitons are then studied, and the effects of\ndifferent mass ratios, relative phases, self-couplings, and separation\ndistances are characterized, leading to an easy conceptual understanding of how\nthese parameters affect the collision outcome in terms of conservation of\nenergy. Applications to dark matter are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the radial velocity (RV) variability and spectroscopic\nbinarity of 19 Galactic long-period ($P_{\\rm{puls}} \\gtrsim 10$ d) classical\nCepheid variable stars whose trigonometric parallaxes are being measured using\nthe Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia. Our primary objective is to constrain\npossible parallax error due to undetected orbital motion. Using $>1600$\nhigh-precision RVs measured between 2011 and 2016, we find no indication of\norbital motion on $\\lesssim 5$ yr timescales for 18 Cepheids and determine\nupper limits on allowed configurations for a range of input orbital periods.\nThe results constrain the unsigned parallax error due to orbital motion to $< 2\n\\%$ for 16 stars, and $< 4 \\%$ for 18. We improve the orbital solution of the\nknown binary YZ Carinae and show that the astrometric model must take into\naccount orbital motion to avoid significant error ($\\sim \\pm 100 \\mu$arcsec).\nWe further investigate long-timescale ($P_{\\rm{orb}} > 10$ yr) variations in\npulsation-averaged velocity $v_\\gamma$ via a template fitting approach using\nboth new and literature RVs. We discover the spectroscopic binarity of XZ Car\nand CD Cyg, find first tentative evidence for AQ Car, and reveal KN Cen's\norbital signature. Further (mostly tentative) evidence of time-variable\n$v_\\gamma$ is found for SS CMa, VY Car, SZ Cyg, and X Pup. We briefly discuss\nconsiderations regarding a vetting process of Galactic Leavitt law calibrators\nand show that light contributions by companions are insignificant for most\ndistance scale applications.\n", "  We use Tree-SPH simulations from the GalMer database by Chilingarian et al.\nto characterize and quantify the non-circular motions induced by the presence\nof bar-like structures on the observed rotation curve of barred galaxies\nderived from empirical models of their line-of-sight velocity maps. The GalMer\ndatabase consists of SPH simulations of galaxies spanning a wide range of\nmorphological types and sizes. The aim is to compare the intrinsic velocities\nand bar properties from the simulations with those derived from\npseudo-observations. This allows us to estimate the amount of non-circularity\nand to test the various methods used to derive the bar properties and rotation\ncurves. The intrinsic velocities in the simulations are calculated from the\ngravitational forces whereas the observed rotation velocities are derived by\napplying the ROTCUR and DiskFit algorithms to well-resolved observations of\nintermediate-inclination, strongly barred galaxies. Our results confirm that\nthe tilted ring method implemented in ROTCUR systematically\nunderestimates/overestimates the rotational velocities by up to 40 percent in\nthe inner part of the galaxy when the bar is aligned with one of the symmetry\naxes for all the models. For the DiskFit analysis, we find that it produces\nunrealistic values for all the models used in this work when the bar is within\n$\\sim$10 degrees of the major or minor axis.\n", "  Context. The He i 1083 nm is a powerful diagnostic for inferring properties\nof the upper solar chromosphere, in particular for the magnetic field. The\nbasic formation of the line in one-dimensional models is well understood, but\nthe influence of the complex 3D structure of the chromosphere and corona has\nhowever never been investigated. This structure must play an essential role\nbecause images taken in He i 1083 nm show structures with widths down to 100\nkm. Aims. To understand the effect of the three-dimensional temperature and\ndensity structure in the solar atmosphere on the formation of the He i 1083 nm\nline. Methods. We solve the non-LTE radiative transfer problem assuming\nstatistical equilibrium for a simple 9-level helium atom that nevertheless\ncaptures all essential physics. As a model atmosphere we use a snapshot from a\n3D radiation-MHD simulation computed with the Bifrost code. Ionising radiation\nfrom the corona is self-consistently taken into account. Results. The emergent\nintensity in the He i 1083 nm is set by the source function and the opacity in\nthe upper chromosphere. The former is dominated by scattering of photospheric\nradiation and does not vary much with spatial location. The latter is\ndetermined by the photonionisation rate in the He i ground state continuum, as\nwell as the electron density in the chromosphere. The spatial variation of the\nflux of ionising radiation is caused by the spatially-structured emissivity of\nthe ionising photons from material at T = 100 kK in the transition region. The\nhotter coronal material produces more ionising photons, but the resulting\nradiation field is smooth and does not lead to small-scale variation of the UV\nflux. The corrugation of the transition region further increases the spatial\nvariation of the amount of UV radiation in the chromosphere.\n", "  We investigate the effect of turning on temperature for the charge neutral\nphase of two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) dense quark matter in presence\nof constant external magnetic field. Within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, by\ntuning the diquark coupling strength, we study the interdependent evolution of\nthe quark Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap and dynamical mass as functions of\ntemperature and magnetic field. We find that magnetic field $B \\gtrsim 0.02$\nGeV$^2$ ($10^{18}$ G) leads to anomalous temperature behavior of the gap in the\ngapless 2SC phase (moderately strong coupling), reminiscent of previous results\nin the literature found in the limit of weak coupling without magnetic field.\nThe 2SC gap in the strong coupling regime is abruptly quenched at ultrahigh\nmagnetic field due to the mismatched Fermi surfaces of up and down quarks\nimposed by charge neutrality and oscillation of the gap due to Landau level\nquantization. The dynamical quark mass also displays strong oscillation and\nmagnetic catalysis at high magnetic field, although the latter effect is\ntempered by nonzero temperature. We discuss the implications for newly born\ncompact stars with superconducting quark cores.\n", "  Baryons cycle into galaxies from the inter-galactic medium, are converted\ninto stars, and a fraction of the baryons are ejected out of galaxies by\nstellar feedback. Here we present new high resolution (3.9\"; 68 pc) CO(2-1) and\nCO(3-2) images that probe these three stages of the baryon cycle in the nearby\nstarburst M 82. We combine these new observations with previous CO(1-0) and [Fe\nII] images to study the physical conditions within the molecular gas. Using a\nBayesian analysis and the radiative transfer code RADEX, we model molecular\nHydrogen temperatures and densities, as well as CO column densities. Besides\nthe disc, we concentrate on two regions within the galaxy: an expanding\nsuper-bubble and the base of a molecular streamer. Shock diagnostics,\nkinematics, and optical extinction suggest that the streamer is an inflowing\nfilament, with a molecular gas mass inflow rate of 3.5 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We\nmeasure the molecular gas mass outflow rate of the expanding super-bubble to be\n17 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, 5 times higher than the inferred inflow rate, and 1.3\ntimes the star formation rate of the galaxy. The high mass outflow rate and\nlarge star formation rate will deplete the galaxy of molecular gas within eight\nmillion years, unless there are additional sources of molecular gas.\n", "  In optomechanics, electromagnetic fields are harnessed to control a single\nmode of a mechanically compliant system, while other mechanical degrees of\nfreedom remain unaffected due to the modes' mutual orthogonality and high\nquality factor. Extension of the optical control beyond the directly addressed\nmode would require a controlled coupling between mechanical modes. Here, we\nintroduce an optically controlled coupling between two oscillation modes of an\noptically levitated nanoparticle. We sympathetically cool one oscillation mode\nby coupling it coherently to the second mode, which is feedback cooled.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate coherent energy transfer between mechanical modes\nand discuss its application for ground-state cooling.\n", "  In the course of a project to study eclipsing binary stars in vinicity of the\nSun, we found that the cooler component of LL Aqr is a solar twin candidate.\nThis is the first known star with properties of a solar twin existing in a\nnon-interacting eclipsing binary, offering an excellent opportunity to fully\ncharacterise its physical properties with very high precision. We used\nextensive multi-band, archival photometry and the Super-WASP project and\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy obtained from the HARPS and CORALIE spectrographs.\nThe spectra of both components were decomposed and a detailed LTE abundance\nanalysis was performed. The light and radial velocity curves were simultanously\nanalysed with the Wilson-Devinney code. The resulting highly precise stellar\nparameters were used for a detailed comparison with PARSEC, MESA, and GARSTEC\nstellar evolution models. LL Aqr consists of two main-sequence stars (F9 V + G3\nV) with masses of M1 = 1.1949$\\pm$0.0007 and M2=1.0337$\\pm$0.0007 $M_\\odot$,\nradii R1 = 1.321$\\pm$0.006 and R2 = 1.002$\\pm$0.005 $R_\\odot$, temperatures\nT1=6080$\\pm$45 K and T2=5703$\\pm$50 K and solar chemical composition\n[M/H]=0.02$\\pm$0.05 dex. The absolute dimensions, radiative and photometric\nproperties, and atmospheric abundances of the secondary are all fully\nconsistent with being a solar twin. Both stars are cooler by about 3.5 $\\sigma$\nor less metal abundant by 5$\\sigma$ than predicted by standard sets of stellar\nevolution models. When advanced modelling was performed, we found that full\nagreement with observations can only be obtained for values of the mixing\nlength and envelope overshooting parameters that are hard to accept. The most\nreasonable and physically justified model fits found with MESA and GARSTEC\ncodes still have discrepancies with observations but only at the level of\n1$\\sigma$.\n", "  A sample of X-ray and optically selected narrow emission-line galaxies (769\nsources) from the 3XMM catalogue cross-correlated with SDSS (DR9) catalogue has\nbeen studied. Narrow-emission line active galactic nuclei (AGN; type-2) have\nbeen selected on the basis of their emission line ratios and/or X-ray\nluminosity. We have looked for X-ray unobscured type-2 AGN. As X-ray spectra\nwere not available for our whole sample, we have checked the reliability of\nusing the X-ray hardness ratio (HR) as a probe of the level of obscuration and\nwe found a very good agreement with full spectral fitting results, with only 2%\nof the sources with apparently unobscured HR turning out to have an obscured\nspectrum. Despite the fact that type-2 AGN are supposed to be absorbed based on\nthe Unified Model, about 60% of them show no sign or very low level of X-ray\nobscuration. After subtraction of contaminants to the sample, that is\nNarrow-Line Seyfert 1 and Compton-thick AGN, the fraction of unobscured Sy2\ndrops to 47%. For these sources, we were able to rule out dust reddening and\nvariability for most of them as an explanation of the absence of optical broad\nemission-lines. The main explanations remaining are the dilution of weak/very\nbroad emission-lines by the host galaxy and the intrinsic absence of the\nbroad-line region (BLR) due to low accretion rates (i.e. True Sy2). However,\nthe number of True Sy2 strongly depends on the method used to verify the\nintrinsic lack of broad lines. Indeed using the optical continuum luminosity to\npredict the BLR properties gives a much larger fraction of True Sy2 (about 90\\%\nof the unobscured Sy2 sample) than the use of the X-ray 2 keV luminosity (about\n20%). Nevertheless the number of AGN we securely detected as True Sy2 is at\nleast three times larger that the previously confirmed number of True Sy2.\n", "  We analyze radio tracking data obtained during 1311 orbits of the MESSENGER\nspacecraft in the period March 2011 to April 2014. A least-squares minimization\nof the residuals between observed and computed values of two-way range and\nDoppler allows us to solve for a model describing Mercury's gravity, tidal\nresponse, and spin state. We use a spherical harmonic representation of the\ngravity field to degree and order 40 and report error bars corresponding to 10\ntimes the formal uncertainties of the fit. Our estimate of the product of\nMercury's mass and the gravitational constant, $GM = (22031.87404 \\pm 9 \\times\n10^{-4})$ km$^{3}$s$^{-2}$, is in excellent agreement with published results.\nOur solution for the geophysically important second-degree coefficients\n($\\bar{C}_{2,0} = -2.25100 \\times 10^{-5} \\pm 1.3 \\times 10^{-9}$,\n$\\bar{C}_{2,2} = 1.24973 \\times 10^{-5} \\pm 1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$) confirms\nprevious estimates to better than 0.4\\% and, therefore, inferences about\nMercury's moment of inertia and interior structure. Our estimate of the tidal\nLove number $k_2 = 0.464 \\pm 0.023$ indicates that Mercury's mantle may be\nhotter and weaker than previously thought. Our spin state solution suggests\nthat gravity-based estimates of Mercury's spin axis orientation are marginally\nconsistent with previous measurements of the orientation of the crust.\n", "  Recently, the standard model prediction of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ was improved,\nand a discrepancy from the experimental results was reported at the $2.9\\sigma$\nlevel. We study the chargino contributions to $Z$ penguin especially with the\nvacuum stability constraint. The vacuum decay rate is investigated, and it is\nshown that the discrepancy can be explained if superparticles are lighter than\n4-6 TeV. Correlations with $\\mathcal{B}(K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu)$ and other\nexperimental constraints are also discussed.\n", "  The very high energy (VHE; E $>$ 100 GeV) blazar Markarian 501 was observed\nbetween April 17 and May 5 (MJD 54938--54956), 2009, as part of an extensive\nmulti-wavelength campaign from radio to VHE. Strong VHE $\\gamma$-ray activity\nwas detected on May 1st with Whipple and VERITAS, when the flux (E $>$ 400 GeV)\nincreased to 10 times the pre-flare baseline flux ($3.9{\\times 10^{-11}}~{\\rm\nph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$), reaching five times the flux of the Crab Nebula. This\ncoincided with a decrease in the optical polarization and a rotation of the\npolarization angle by 15$^{\\circ}$. This VHE flare showed a fast flux variation\nwith an increase of a factor $\\sim$4 in 25 minutes, and a falling time of\n$\\sim$50 minutes. We present the observations of the quiescent state previous\nto the flare and of the high state after the flare, focusing on the flux and\nspectral variability from Whipple, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, and Swift combined\nwith optical and radio data.\n", "  This article is based on our discussion session on Milky Way models at the\n592 WE-Heraeus Seminar, Reconstructing the Milky Way's History: Spectroscopic\nSurveys, Asteroseismology and Chemodynamical models. The discussion focused on\nthe following question: \"Are there distinct thick and thin disks?\". The answer\nto this question depends on the definition one adopts for thin and thick disks.\nThe participants of this discussion converged to the idea that there are at\nleast two different types of disks in the Milky Way. However, there are still\nimportant open questions on how to best define these two types of disks\n(chemically, kinematically, geometrically or by age?). The question of what is\nthe origin of the distinct disks remains open. The future Galactic surveys\nwhich are highlighted in this conference should help us answering these\nquestions. The almost one-hour debate involving researchers in the field\nrepresenting different modelling approaches (Galactic models such as TRILEGAL,\nBesancon and Galaxia, chemical evolution models, extended distribution\nfunctions method, chemodynamics in the cosmological context, and\nself-consistent cosmological simulations) illustrated how important is to have\nall these parallel approaches. All approaches have their advantages and\nshortcomings (also discussed), and different approaches are useful to address\nspecific points that might help us answering the more general question above.\n", "  The main astronomical source of r-process elements has not yet been\nidentified. One plausible site is neutron star mergers (NSMs), but from\nperspective of the Galactic chemical evolution, it has been pointed out that\nNSMs cannot reproduce the observed r-process abundance distribution of\nmetal-poor stars at [Fe/H] $< -3$. Recently, Tsujimoto & Shigeyama (2014)\npointed out that NSM ejecta can spread into much larger volume than ejecta from\na supernova. We re-examine the enrichment of r-process elements by NSMs\nconsidering this difference in propagation using the chemical evolution model\nunder the hierarchical galaxy formation. The observed r-process enhanced stars\naround [Fe/H] $\\sim -3$ are reproduced if the star formation efficiency is\nlower for low-mass galaxies under a realistic delay time distribution for NSMs.\nWe show that a significant fraction of NSM ejecta escape from its host\nproto-galaxy to pollute intergalactic matter and other proto-galaxies. The\npropagation of r-process elements over proto-galaxies changes the abundance\ndistribution at [Fe/H] $< -3$ and obtains distribution compatible with\nobservations of the Milky Way halo stars. In particular, the pre-enrichment of\nintergalactic medium explains the observed scarcity of EMP stars without Ba and\nabundance distribution of r-process elements at [Fe/H] $\\lesssim -3.5$.\n", "  We consider a system where an optical cavity mode is parametrically coupled\nto a mechanical oscillator. A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance\nfrequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the\nposition of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in\nthe electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal\nmagnitude. In a quantum theory, however, an asymmetry between the sidebands can\nbe resolved when the oscillator's average number of vibrational excitations\n(phonons) becomes small, i.e., comparable to 1. We discuss the interpretation\nof this sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne photodetection measurement scheme\nand show that it depends on the choice of detector model. In the optical\nregime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum\ngiven by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is\nin that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise\nspectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures\nsymmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry\ncan be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity\nin interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree\nof freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field.\nFinally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where\nsideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms.\nWe show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical\ntheory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from\nthose of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures. We discuss the\nobservable consequences of this deviaton between classical and quantum\ntheories.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials as electrodes is believed to be the trend for\nfuture Li-ion and Na-ion batteries technologies. Here, by using\nfirst-principles methods, we predict that the recently reported borophene (2D\nborn sheet) can serve as an ideal electrode material with high electrochemical\nperformance for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. The calculations are\nperformed on the two experimentally stable borophene structures, namely\n\\b{eta}12 and \\c{hi}3 structures. The optimized Li and Na adsorption sites are\nidentified, and the host materials are found to maintain good electric\nconductivity before and after adsorption. Besides advantages including small\ndiffusion barriers and low average open-circuit voltages, most remarkably, the\nstorage capacity can be as high as 1984 mA h g-1 in \\b{eta}12 borophene and\n1240 mA h g-1 in \\c{hi}3 borophene for both Li and Na, which is several times\nhigher than the commercial graphite electrode and is the highest among all the\n2D materials discovered to date. Our results highly support that borophenes can\nbe appealing anode materials for both Li-ion and Na-ion batteries with\nextremely high power density.\n", "  The precise mechanisms that provide the non-radiative energy for heating the\nchromosphere and the corona of the Sun and other stars are at the focus of\nintense contemporary research. Observations at submm/mm wavelengths are\nparticularly useful to obtain information about the run of the temperature in\nthe upper atmosphere of Sun-like stars. We used ALMA to study the chromospheric\nemission of the aCen binary system in all six available frequency bands during\nCycle2 in 2014/15. Since ALMA is an interferometer, the multi-telescope array\nis particularly suited for the observation of point sources. With its large\ncollecting area, the sensitivity is high enough to allow the observation of\nnearby main-sequence stars at submm/mm wavelengths for the first time. The\ncomparison of the observed spectral energy distributions with theoretical model\ncomputations provides the chromospheric structure in terms of temperature and\ndensity above the stellar photosphere and the quantitative understanding of the\nprimary emission processes. Both stars were detected and resolved at all ALMA\nfrequencies. For both aCenA and B, the existence and location of the\ntemperature minima, firstly detected from space with Herschel, are well\nreproduced by the theoretical models of this paper. For aCenB, the temperature\nminimum is deeper than for A and occurs at a lower height in the atmosphere,\nbut for both stars, Tmin/Teff is consistently lower than what is derived from\noptical and UV data. The submm/mm emission of the aCen stars is indeed very\nwell reproduced by modified chromospheric models of the Quiet Sun. This most\nlikely means that the non-radiative heating mechanisms of the upper atmosphere\nthat are at work in the Sun are operating also in other solar-type stars.\n", "  This article provides an overview of how models of giant planet interiors are\nconstructed. We review measurements from past space missions that provide\nconstraints for the interior structure of Jupiter. We discuss typical\nthree-layer interior models that consist of a dense central core and an inner\nmetallic and an outer molecular hydrogen-helium layer. These models rely\nheavily on experiments, analytical theory, and first-principle computer\nsimulations of hydrogen and helium to understand their behavior up to the\nextreme pressures ~10 Mbar and temperatures ~10,000 K. We review the various\nequations of state used in Jupiter models and compare them with shock wave\nexperiments. We discuss the possibility of helium rain, core erosion and double\ndiffusive convection may have important consequences for the structure and\nevolution of giant planets. In July 2016 the Juno spacecraft entered orbit\naround Jupiter, promising high-precision measurements of the gravitational\nfield that will allow us to test our understanding of gas giant interiors\nbetter than ever before.\n", "  The distribution of electric charge in atomic nuclei is fundamental to our\nunderstanding of the complex nuclear dynamics and a quintessential observable\nto validate nuclear structure models. We explore a novel approach that combines\nsophisticated models of nuclear structure with Bayesian neural networks (BNN)\nto generate predictions for the charge radii of thousands of nuclei throughout\nthe nuclear chart. A class of relativistic energy density functionals is used\nto provide robust predictions for nuclear charge radii. In turn, these\npredictions are refined through Bayesian learning for a neural network that is\ntrained using residuals between theoretical predictions and the experimental\ndata. Although predictions obtained with density functional theory provide a\nfairly good description of experiment, our results show significant improvement\n(better than 40%) after BNN refinement. Moreover, these improved results for\nnuclear charge radii are supplemented with theoretical error bars. We have\nsuccessfully demonstrated the ability of the BNN approach to significantly\nincrease the accuracy of nuclear models in the predictions of nuclear charge\nradii. However, as many before us, we failed to uncover the underlying physics\nbehind the intriguing behavior of charge radii along the calcium isotopic\nchain.\n", "  Semilocal strings are vortices in the extended Abelian-Higgs model with two\ncomplex Higgs scalar fields among which a global $SU(2)$ symmetry acts. They\nare known to be stable (unstable against expansion) in type-I (II)\nsuperconductors, in which gauge field is heavier (lighter) than the Higgs\nscalar field. In this paper, we find that vortices can be stabilized in the\nwhole parameter region including the type-II region by adding a potential term\nbreaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry. We construct numerical solutions in various\nparameters and determine the vortex phase diagram consisting of six phases. In\ntwo phases, a vortex is polarized, that is, split into two half-quantized\nvortices with a certain distance, to form a vortex molecule, while in the rests\na vortex is identical to the conventional Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortex.\n", "  We report the detections of a giant planet (MARVELS-7b) and a brown dwarf\ncandidate (MARVELS-7c) around the primary star in the close binary system, HD\n87646. It is the first close binary system with more than one substellar\ncircum-primary companion discovered to the best of our knowledge. The detection\nof this giant planet was accomplished using the first multi-object Doppler\ninstrument (KeckET) at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) telescope.\nSubsequent radial velocity observations using ET at Kitt Peak National\nObservatory, HRS at HET, the \"Classic\" spectrograph at the Automatic\nSpectroscopic Telescope at Fairborn Observatory, and MARVELS from SDSS-III\nconfirmed this giant planet discovery and revealed the existence of a\nlong-period brown dwarf in this binary. HD 87646 is a close binary with a\nseparation of $\\sim22$ AU between the two stars, estimated using the Hipparcos\ncatalogue and our newly acquired AO image from PALAO on the 200-inch Hale\nTelescope at Palomar. The primary star in the binary, HD 87646A, has Teff =\n5770$\\pm$80K, log(g)=4.1$\\pm$0.1 and [Fe/H] = $-0.17\\pm0.08$. The derived\nminimum masses of the two substellar companions of HD 87646A are\n12.4$\\pm$0.7M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and 57.0$\\pm3.7$M$_{\\rm Jup}$. The periods are\n13.481$\\pm$0.001 days and 674$\\pm$4 days and the measured eccentricities are\n0.05$\\pm$0.02 and 0.50$\\pm$0.02 respectively. Our dynamical simulations show\nthe system is stable if the binary orbit has a large semi-major axis and a low\neccentricity, which can be verified with future astrometry observations.\n", "  (Abridged) In this paper, multi-wavelength data are compiled for a sample of\n1425 Fermi blazars to calculate their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). A\nparabolic function, $\\log(\\nu F_{\\nu}) = P_1(\\log\\nu - P_2)^2 + P_3,$ is used\nfor SED fitting. Synchrotron peak frequency ($\\log \\nu_p$), spectral curvature\n($P_1$), peak flux ($\\nu_{\\rm p}F_{\\rm \\nu_p}$), and integrated flux ($\\nu\nF_{\\nu}$) are successfully obtained for 1392 blazars (461 flat spectrum radio\nquasars-FSRQs, 620 BL Lacs-BLs and 311 blazars of uncertain type-BCUs, 999\nsources have known redshifts). Monochromatic luminosity at radio 1.4 GHz,\noptical R band, X-ray at 1 keV and $\\gamma$-ray at 1 GeV, peak luminosity,\nintegrated luminosity and effective spectral indexes of radio to optical\n($\\alpha_{\\rm RO}$), and optical to X-ray ($\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$) are calculated.\nThe \"Bayesian classification\" is employed to log$\\nu_{\\rm p}$ in the rest frame\nfor 999 blazars with available redshift and the results show that 3 components\nare enough to fit the $\\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$ distribution, there is no ultra high\npeaked subclass. Based on the 3 components, the subclasses of blazars using the\nacronyms of Abdo et al. (2010a) are classified, and some mutual correlations\nare also studied. Conclusions are finally drawn as follows: (1) SEDs are\nsuccessfully obtained for 1392 blazars. The fitted peak frequencies are\ncompared with common sources from samples available (Sambruna et al. 1996,\nNieppola et al. 2006, 2008, Abdo et al. 2010a). (2) Blazars are classified as\nlow synchrotron peak sources (LSPs) if $\\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz) $\\leq 14.0$,\nintermediate synchrotron peak sources (ISPs) if $14.0 < \\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz)\n$\\leq 15.3$, and high synchrotron peak sources (HSPs) if $\\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz)\n$> 15.3$. (3) $\\gamma$-ray emissions are strongly correlated with radio\nemissions. (...)\n", "  The Higgs boson mass and top quark mass imply that the Higgs quartic coupling\nvanishes around the scale of $10^9 - 10^{13}$ GeV, depending on the precise\nvalue of the top quark mass. The vanishing quartic coupling can be naturally\naddressed if the Higgs field originates from a 5-dimensional gauge field and\nthe 5th dimension is compactified at the scale of the vanishing Higgs quartic\ncoupling, which is a scenario based on gauge-Higgs unification. We present a\ngeneral prediction of the scenario on the proton decay process $p \\to \\pi^0\ne^+$. In many gauge-Higgs unification models, the 1st generation fermions are\nlocalized towards an orbifold fixed point in order to realize the realistic\nYukawa couplings. Hence, four-fermion operators responsible for the proton\ndecay can appear with a suppression of the 5-dimensional Planck scale (not the\n4-dimensional Planck scale). Since the 5-dimensional Planck scale is connected\nto the compactification scale, we have a correlation between the proton partial\ndecay width and the top quark mass. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande\nexperiment may discover the proton decay if the top quark pole mass is larger\nthan about 172.5 GeV.\n", "  Radio emission observations from the Learmonth and Bruny Island radio\nspectrographs are analysed to determine the nature of a train of discrete,\nperiodic radio \\lq sparks\\rq (finite-bandwidth, short-duration isolated radio\nfeatures) which precede a type II burst. We analyse extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nimaging from SDO/AIA at multiple wavelengths and identify a series of\nquasi-periodic rapidly-propagating enhancements, which we interpret as a fast\nwave train, and link these to the detected radio features. The speeds and\npositions of the periodic rapidly propagating fast waves and the coronal mass\nejection (CME) were recorded using running-difference images and time-distance\nanalysis. From the frequency of the radio sparks the local electron density at\nthe emission location was estimated for each. Using an empirical model for the\nscaling of density in the corona, the calculated electron density was used to\nobtain the height above the surface at which the emission occurs, and the\npropagation velocity of the emission location. The period of the radio sparks,\n$\\delta t_\\mathrm{r}$=1.78$\\pm$0.04 min, matches the period of the fast wave\ntrain observed at 171 $\\AA$, $\\delta t_\\mathrm{EUV}$=1.7 $\\pm$ 0.2 min. The\ninferred speed of the emission location of the radio sparks, 630 km s$^{-1}$,\nis comparable to the measured speed of the CME leading edge, 500 km s$^{-1}$,\nand the speeds derived from the drifting of the type II lanes. The calculated\nheight of the radio emission (obtained from the density) matches the observed\nlocation of the CME leading edge. From the above evidence we propose that the\nradio sparks are caused by the quasi-periodic fast waves, and the emission is\ngenerated as they catch up and interact with the leading edge of the CME.\n", "  Bandedge states in the indirect-gap group-IV metal monochalcogenide\nmonolayers ('four-six-enes' such as SnS, GeTe, etc.) inherit the properties of\nnearby reciprocal space points of high symmetry at the Brillouin zone edge. We\nemploy group theory and the method of invariants to capture these essential\nsymmetries in effective Hamiltonians including spin-orbit coupling, and use\nperturbation theory to shed light on the nature of the bandedge states. In\nparticular, we show how the structure of derived wavefunctions leads to\nspecific dominant momentum and spin scattering mechanisms for both valence\nholes and conduction electrons, we analyze the direct optical transitions\nacross the bandgap, and expose the interactions responsible for subtle features\nof the local dispersion relations.\n", "  Very young open clusters are ideal places to study the X-ray properties of a\nhomogeneous population of early-type stars. In this respect, the IC1805 open\ncluster is very interesting as it hosts the O4If$^+$ star HD15570 thought to be\nin an evolutionary stage intermediate between a normal O-star and a Wolf-Rayet\nstar. Such a star could provide a test for theoretical models aiming at\nexplaining the empirical scaling relation between the X-ray and bolometric\nluminosities of O-type stars. We have observed IC1805 with XMM-Newton and\nfurther collected optical spectroscopy of some of the O-star members of the\ncluster. The optical spectra allow us to revisit the orbital solutions of\nBD+60$^{\\circ}$ 497 and HD15558, and provide the first evidence of binarity for\nBD+60$^{\\circ}$ 498. X-ray emission from colliding winds does not appear to\nplay an important role among the O-stars of IC1805. Notably, the X-ray fluxes\ndo not vary significantly between archival X-ray observations and our\nXMM-Newton pointing. The very fast rotator BD+60$^{\\circ}$ 513, and to a lesser\nextent the O4If$^+$ star HD15570 appear somewhat underluminous. Whilst the\nunderluminosity of HD15570 is only marginally significant, its amplitude is\nfound to be compatible with theoretical expectations based on its stellar and\nwind properties. A number of other X-ray sources are detected in the field, and\nthe brightest objects, many of which are likely low-mass pre-main sequence\nstars, are analyzed in detail.\n", "  Gas accretion and radial flows are key ingredients of the chemical evolution\nof spiral galaxies. They are also tightly linked to each other (accretion\ndrives radial flows, due to angular momentum conservation) and should therefore\nbe modelled simultaneously. We summarise an algorithm that can be used to\nconsistently compute accretion profiles, radial flows and abundance gradients\nunder quite general conditions and we describe illustrative applications to the\nMilky Way. We find that gas-phase abundance gradients strongly depend on the\nangular momentum of the accreting material and, in the outer regions, they are\nsignificantly affected by the choice of boundary conditions.\n", "  We analytically study the linear response of a near-extremal Kerr black hole\nto external scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational field perturbations. We\nshow that the energy density, electromagnetic field strength, and tidal force\nexperienced by infalling observers exhibit transient growth near the horizon.\nThe growth lasts arbitrarily long in the extremal limit, reproducing the\nhorizon instability of extremal Kerr. We explain these results in terms of\nnear-horizon geometry and discuss potential astrophysical implications.\n", "  Though the no-cloning theorem [1] prohibits exact replication of arbitrary\nquantum states, there are many instances in quantum information processing and\nentanglement measurement in which a weaker form of cloning may be useful. Here,\nI provide a construction for generating an \"entangled clone\" for a particular\nbut rather expansive and rich class of states. Given a stabilizer code or free\nfermion Hamiltonian, this construction generates an exact entangled clone of\nthe original ground state, in the sense that the entanglement between the\noriginal and the exact copy can be tuned to be arbitrarily small but finite, or\nlarge, and the relation between the original and the copy can also be modified\nto some extent. For example, this work focuses on generating time-reversed\ncopies of stabilizer codes and particle-hole transformed ground states of free\nfermion systems, although untransformed clones can also be generated. The\nprotocol leverages entanglement to simulate a transformed copy of the\nHamiltonian without having to physically implement it and can potentially be\nrealized in superconducting qubits or ultracold atomic systems.\n", "  We study bosonization in 2+1 dimensions using mirror symmetry, a duality that\nrelates pairs of supersymmetric theories. Upon breaking supersymmetry in a\ncontrolled way, we dynamically obtain the bosonization duality that equates the\ntheory of a free Dirac fermion to QED3 with a single scalar boson. This duality\nmay be used to demonstrate the bosonization duality relating an\n$O(2)$-symmetric Wilson-Fisher fixed point to QED3 with a single Dirac fermion,\nPeskin-Dasgupta-Halperin duality, and the recently conjectured duality relating\nthe theory of a free Dirac fermion to fermionic QED3 with a single flavor.\nChern-Simons and BF couplings for both dynamical and background gauge fields\nplay a central role in our approach. In the course of our study, we describe a\nchiral mirror pair that may be viewed as the minimal supersymmetric\ngeneralization of the two bosonization dualities.\n", "  We build on a recent photometric decomposition analysis of 7506 Galaxy and\nMass Assembly (GAMA) survey galaxies to derive stellar mass function fits to\nindividual spheroid and disk component populations down to a lower mass limit\nof log(M_*/M_sun)= 8. We find that the spheroid/disk mass distributions for\nindividual galaxy morphological types are well described by single Schechter\nfunction forms. We derive estimates of the total stellar mass densities in\nspheroids (rho_spheroid = 1.24+/-0.49 * 10^8 M_sun Mpc^-3 h_0.7) and disks\n(rho_disk = 1.20+/-0.45 * 10^8 M_sun Mpc^-3 h_0.7), which translates to\napproximately 50% of the local stellar mass density in spheroids and 48% in\ndisks. The remaining stellar mass is found in the dwarf \"little blue spheroid\"\nclass, which is not obviously similar in structure to either classical spheroid\nor disk populations. We also examine the variation of component mass ratios\nacross galaxy mass and group halo mass regimes, finding the transition from\nspheroid to disk mass dominance occurs near galaxy stellar mass ~10^11 M_sun\nand group halo mass ~10^12.5 M_sun/h. We further quantify the variation in\nspheroid-to-total mass ratio with group halo mass for central and satellite\npopulations as well as the radial variation of this ratio within groups.\n", "  We study the static and dynamical properties of isolated many-body quantum\nsystems and compare them with the results for full random matrices. In doing\nso, we link concepts from quantum information theory with those from quantum\nchaos. In particular, we relate the von Neumann entanglement entropy with the\nShannon information entropy and discuss their relevance for the analysis of the\ndegree of complexity of the eigenstates, the behavior of the system at\ndifferent time scales and the conditions for thermalization. A main advantage\nof full random matrices is that they enable the derivation of analytical\nexpressions that agree extremely well with the numerics and provide bounds for\nrealistic many-body quantum systems.\n", "  We study the possibility of using single rare-earth ions coupled to a\nphotonic cavity with high cooperativity for performing non-destructive\nmeasurements of photons, which would be useful for global quantum networks and\nphotonic quantum computing. We calculate the achievable fidelity as a function\nof the parameters of the rare-earth ion and photonic cavity, which include the\nion's optical and spin dephasing rates, the cavity linewidth, the single photon\ncoupling to the cavity, and the detection efficiency. We suggest a promising\nexperimental realization using current state of the art technology in\nNd:YVO$_4$.\n", "  The composition of silicate dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and in\nprotoplanetary disks around young stars informs our understanding of the\nprocessing and evolution of the dust grains leading up to planet formation.\nAnalysis of the well-known 9.7{\\mu}m feature indicates that small amorphous\nsilicate grains represent a significant fraction of interstellar dust and are\nalso major components of protoplanetary disks. However, this feature is\ntypically modelled assuming amorphous silicate dust of olivine and pyroxene\nstoichiometries. Here, we analyze interstellar dust with models of silicate\ndust that include non-stoichiometric amorphous silicate grains. Modelling the\noptical depth along lines of sight toward the extinguished objects Cyg OB2 No.\n12 and {\\zeta} Ophiuchi, we find evidence for interstellar amorphous silicate\ndust with stoichiometry intermediate between olivine and pyroxene, which we\nsimply refer to as \"polivene.\" Finally, we compare these results to models of\nsilicate emission from the Trapezium and protoplanetary disks in Taurus.\n", "  A small fraction of hot OBA stars host global magnetic fields with field\nstrengths of the order of 0.1-10 kG. This leads to the creation of persistent\nsurface structures (spots) in stars with sufficiently weak winds as a result of\nthe radiative diffusion. These spots become evident in spectroscopic and\nphotometric variability. This type of variability is not expected in stars with\nstrong winds, where the wind inhibits the radiative diffusion. Therefore, a\nweak photometric variability of the magnetic Of?p star HD 191612 is attributed\nto the light absorption in the circumstellar clouds. We study the nature of the\nphotometric variability of HD 191612. We assume that the variability results\nfrom variable wind blanketing induced by surface variations of the magnetic\nfield tilt and modulated by stellar rotation. We used our global kinetic\nequilibrium (NLTE) wind models with radiative force determined from the\nradiative transfer equation in the comoving frame (CMF) to predict the stellar\nemergent flux. Our models describe the stellar atmosphere in a unified manner\nand account for the influence of the wind on the atmosphere. The models are\ncalculated for different wind mass-loss rates to mimic the effect of magnetic\nfield tilt on the emergent fluxes. We integrate the emergent fluxes over the\nvisible stellar surface for individual rotational phases, and calculate the\nrotationally modulated light curve of HD 191612. The wind blanketing that\nvaries across surface is able to explain a part of the observed light\nvariability in this star. The mechanism is able to operate even at relatively\nlow mass-loss rates. The remaining variability is most likely caused by the\nflux absorption in circumstellar clouds. The variable wind blanketing is an\nadditional source of the light variability in massive stars. The presence of\nthe rotational light variability may serve as a proxy for the magnetic field.\n", "  The FourStar galaxy evolution survey (ZFOURGE) is a 45 night legacy program\nwith the FourStar near-infrared camera on Magellan and one of the most\nsensitive surveys to date. ZFOURGE covers a total of $400\\ \\mathrm{arcmin}^2$\nin cosmic fields CDFS, COSMOS and UDS, overlapping CANDELS. We present\nphotometric catalogs comprising $>70,000$ galaxies, selected from ultradeep\n$K_s$-band detection images ($25.5-26.5$ AB mag, $5\\sigma$, total), and $>80\\%$\ncomplete to $K_s<25.3-25.9$ AB. We use 5 near-IR medium-bandwidth filters\n($J_1,J_2,J_3,H_s,H_l$) as well as broad-band $K_s$ at $1.05\\ - 2.16\\ \\mu m$ to\n$25-26$ AB at a seeing of $\\sim0.5$\". Each field has ancillary imaging in\n$26-40$ filters at $0.3-8\\ \\mu m$. We derive photometric redshifts and stellar\npopulation properties. Comparing with spectroscopic redshifts indicates a\nphotometric redshift uncertainty $\\sigma_z={0.010,0.009}$, and 0.011 in CDFS,\nCOSMOS, and UDS. As spectroscopic samples are often biased towards bright and\nblue sources, we also inspect the photometric redshift differences between\nclose pairs of galaxies, finding $\\sigma_{z,pairs}= 0.01-0.02$ at $1<z<2.5$. We\nquantify how $\\sigma_{z,pairs}$ depends on redshift, magnitude, SED type, and\nthe inclusion of FourStar medium bands. $\\sigma_{z,pairs}$ is smallest for\nbright, blue star-forming samples, while red star-forming galaxies have the\nworst $\\sigma_{z,pairs}$. Including FourStar medium bands reduces\n$\\sigma_{z,pairs}$ by 50\\% at $1.5<z<2.5$. We calculate SFRs based on\nultraviolet and ultradeep far-IR $Spitzer$/MIPS and Herschel/PACS data. We\nderive rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors, and illustrate how these correlate\nwith specific SFR and dust emission to $z=3.5$. We confirm the existence of\nquiescent galaxies at $z\\sim3$, demonstrating their SFRs are suppressed by\n$>\\times15$.\n", "  The zero-temperature dynamical structure factor $S(q,\\omega)$ of\none-dimensional hard rods is computed using state-of-the-art quantum Monte\nCarlo and analytic continuation techniques, complemented by a Bethe Ansatz\nanalysis. As the density increases, $S(q,\\omega)$ reveals a crossover from the\nTonks-Girardeau gas to a quasi-solid regime, along which the low-energy\nproperties are found in agreement with the nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory.\nOur quantitative estimate of $S(q,\\omega)$ extends beyond the low-energy limit\nand confirms a theoretical prediction regarding the behavior of $S(q,\\omega)$\nat specific wavevectors $\\mathcal{Q}_n=n 2 \\pi/a$, where $a$ is the core\nradius, resulting from the interplay of the particle-hole boundaries of\nsuitably rescaled ideal Fermi gases. We observe significant similarities\nbetween hard rods and one-dimensional $^4$He at high density, suggesting that\nthe hard-rods model may provide an accurate description of dense\none-dimensional liquids of quantum particles interacting through a strongly\nrepulsive, finite-range potential.\n", "  In our previous study, we showed that the peculiar globular cluster (GC) M22\ncontains two distinct stellar populations, namely the Ca-w and Ca-s groups with\ndifferent physical properties, having different chemical compositions, spatial\ndistributions and kinematics. We proposed that M22 is most likely formed via a\nmerger of two GCs with heterogeneous metallicities in a dwarf galaxy\nenvironment and accreted later to our Galaxy. In their recent study,\nMucciarelli et al. claimed that M22 is a normal mono-metallic globular cluster\nwithout any perceptible metallicity spread among the two groups of stars, which\nchallenges our results and those of others. We devise new strategies for the\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis of red giant branch\n(RGB) stars in GCs and show there exists a spread in the iron abundance\ndistribution in M22.\n", "  We study the ground state of $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg model on the checkerboard\nlattice in a magnetic field by the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nmethod with the sine-square deformation. We obtain magnetization plateaus at\n$M/M_{\\rm sat}=$0, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, and 3/4 where $M_{\\rm sat}$ is the saturated\nmagnetization. The obtained 3/4 plateau state is consistent with the exact\nresult, and the 1/2 plateau is found to have a four-spin resonating loop\nstructure similar to the six-spin loop structure of the 1/3 plateau of the\nkagome lattice. Different four-spin loop structures are obtained in the 1/4 and\n3/8 plateaus but no corresponding states exist in the kagome lattice. The 3/8\nplateau has a unique magnetic structure of three types of four-spin local\nquantum states in a $4\\sqrt{2}\\times2\\sqrt{2}$ magnetic unit cell with a\n16-fold degeneracy.\n", "  Five regions of massive star formation have been observed in various\nmolecular lines in the frequency range $\\sim 85-89$ GHz. The studied regions\npossess dense cores, which host young stellar objects. The physical parameters\nof the cores are estimated, including kinetic temperatures ($\\sim 20-40$ K),\nsizes of the emitting regions ($\\sim 0.1-0.6$ pc), and virial masses ($\\sim\n40-500 M_{\\odot}$). Column densities and abundances of various molecules are\ncalculated in the local thermodynamical equilibrium approximation. The core in\n99.982+4.17, associated with the weakest IRAS source, is characterized by\nreduced molecular abundances. Molecular line widths decrease with increasing\ndistance from the core centers ($b$). For $b\\ga 0.1$~pc, the dependences\n$\\Delta V(b)$ are close to power laws ($\\propto b^{-p}$), where $p$ varies from\n$\\sim 0.2$ to $\\sim 0.5$, depending on the object. In four cores, the\nasymmetries of the optically thick HCN(1--0) and HCO$^+$(1--0) lines indicate\nsystematic motions along the line of sight: collapse in two cores and expansion\nin two others. Approximate estimates of the accretion rates in the collapsing\ncores indicate that the forming stars have masses exceeding the solar mass.\n", "  We demonstrate quantum resonance ratchets created with Bose-Einstein\ncondensates exposed to pulses of an off-resonant standing light wave. We show\nhow some of the basic properties of the ratchets are controllable through the\ncreation of different initial states of the system. In particular, our results\nprove that through an appropriate choice of initial state it is possible to\nreduce the extent to which the ratchet state changes with respect to time. We\ndevelop a simple theory to explain our results and indicate how ratchets might\nbe used as part of a matter wave interferometer or quantum-random walk\nexperiment.\n", "  Hydrodynamical, i.e. multi-dimensional and time-dependent, model atmospheres\nof late-type stars have reached a high level of realism. They are commonly\napplied in high-fidelity work on stellar abundances but also allow the study of\nprocesses that are not modelled in standard, one-dimensional hydrostatic model\natmospheres. Here, we discuss two observational aspects that emerge from such\nprocesses, the photometric granulation background and the spectroscopic\nmicroturbulence. We use CO5BOLD hydrodynamical model atmospheres to\ncharacterize the total granular brightness fluctuations and characteristic time\nscale for FGK stars. Emphasis is put on the diagnostic potential of the\ngranulation background for constraining the fundamental atmospheric parameters.\nWe find a clear metallicity dependence of the granulation background. The\ncomparison between the model predictions and available observational\nconstraints at solar metallicity shows significant differences, that need\nfurther clarification. Concerning microturbulence, we report on the derivation\nof a theoretical calibration based on CO5BOLD models, which shows good\ncorrespondence with the measurements for stars in the Hyades. We emphasize the\nimportance of a consistent procedure when determining the microturbulence, and\npoint to limitations of the commonly applied description of microturbulence in\nhydrostatic model atmospheres.\n", "  Tram et al. 2016 recently pointed out that power-law inflation in presence of\na dark radiation component may relieve the 3.3 sigma tension which exists\nwithin standard LCDM between the determination of the local value of the Hubble\nconstant by Riess et al. (2016) and the value derived from CMB anisotropy data\nby the Planck collaboration. In this comment, we simply point out that this\ninteresting proposal does not help in solving the $\\sigma_8$ tension between\nthe Planck data and, e.g., the weak lensing measurements. Moreover, when the\nlatest constraints on the reionization optical depth obtained from Planck HFI\ndata are included in the analysis, the $H_0$ tension reappears and this\nscenario looses appeal.\n", "  We synthesized single crystals of composition Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ and\ninvestigated its quantum magnetic properties. The crystal structure is closely\nrelated to that of the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) dimerized magnet\nBaCuSi$_2$O$_6$ also known as Han purple. Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ has a\nsinglet ground state with an excitation gap of ${\\Delta}/k_{\\rm B}\\,{=}\\,20.8$\nK. The magnetization curves for two different field directions almost perfectly\ncoincide when normalized by the $g$-factor except for a small jump anomaly for\na magnetic field perpendicular to the $c$ axis. The magnetization curve with a\nnonlinear slope above the critical field is in excellent agreement with\nexact-diagonalization calculations based on a 2D coupled spin-dimer model.\nIndividual exchange constants are also evaluated using density functional\ntheory (DFT). The DFT results demonstrate a 2D exchange network and weak\nfrustration between interdimer exchange interactions, supported by weak\nspin-lattice coupling implied from our magnetostriction data. The\nmagnetic-field-induced spin ordering in Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ is described\nas the quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensation of triplets.\n", "  Radio astronomy has changed. For years it studied relatively rare sources,\nwhich emit mostly non-thermal radiation across the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum, i.e. radio quasars and radio galaxies. Now it is reaching such faint\nflux densities that it detects mainly star-forming galaxies and the more common\nradio-quiet active galactic nuclei. These sources make up the bulk of the\nextragalactic sky, which has been studied for decades in the infrared, optical,\nand X-ray bands. I follow the transformation of radio astronomy by reviewing\nthe main components of the radio sky at the bright and faint ends, the issue of\ntheir proper classification, their number counts, luminosity functions, and\nevolution. The overall \"big picture\" astrophysical implications of these\nresults, and their relevance for a number of hot topics in extragalactic\nastronomy, are also discussed. The future prospects of the faint radio sky are\nvery bright, as we will soon be flooded with survey data. This review should be\nuseful to all extragalactic astronomers, irrespective of their favourite\nelectromagnetic band(s), and even stellar astronomers might find it somewhat\ngratifying.\n", "  A sunspot acts as a waveguide in response to the dynamics of the solar\ninterior; the trapped waves and oscillations could reveal its thermal and\nmagnetic structures.\n  We study the oscillations in a sunspot intruded by a light bridge, the\ndetails of the oscillations could reveal the fine structure of the magnetic\ntopology.\n  We use the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly data to\nanalyse the oscillations in the emission intensity of light bridge plasma at\ndifferent temperatures and investigate their spatial distributions.\n  The extreme ultraviolet emission intensity exhibits two persistent\noscillations at five-minute and sub-minute ranges. The spatial distribution of\nthe five-minute oscillation follows the spine of the bridge; whereas the\nsub-minute oscillations overlap with two flanks of the bridge. Moreover, the\nsub-minute oscillations are highly correlated in spatial domain, however, the\noscillations at the eastern and western flanks are asymmetric with regard to\nthe lag time. In the meanwhile, jet-like activities are only found at the\neastern flank.\n  Asymmetries in forms of oscillatory pattern and jet-like activities\n\\textbf{are} found between two flanks of a granular light bridge. Based on our\nstudy and recent findings, we propose a new model of twisted magnetic field for\na light bridge and its dynamic interactions with the magnetic field of a\nsunspot.\n", "  In this work, we systematically study the strong decay behaviors of the\ncharmed mesons $D_{1}^{*}(2680)$, $D_{3}^{*}(2760)$ and $D_{2}^{*}(3000)$\nreported by the LHCb collaboration. By comparing the masses and the decay\nproperties with the results of the experiment, we assigned these newly observed\nmesons as the $2S\\frac{1}{2}1^{-}$, $1D\\frac{5}{2}3^{-}$ and\n$1F\\frac{5}{2}2^{+}$ states respectively. As a byproduct, we also study the\nstrong decays of the unobserved $2P\\frac{3}{2}2^{+}$ and $2F\\frac{5}{2}2^{+}$\ncharmed mesons, which is helpful to the future experiments in searching for\nthese charmed mesons.\n", "  We consider the Landau-Zener problem for a multilevel quantum system that is\ncoupled to an external environment. In particular, we consider a number of\ncases of three-level systems coupled to a harmonic oscillator that represents\nthe external environment. We find that, similar to the case of the Landau-Zener\nproblem with a two-level system, when the quantum system and the environment\nare both initially in their ground states the probability that the system\nremains in the same quantum state is not affected by the coupling to the\nenvironment. The final occupation probabilities of the other states are well\ndescribed by a common general principle: the coupling to the environment turns\neach Landau-Zener transition process in the closed system into a sequence of\nsmaller transitions in the combined Hilbert space of the system and\nenvironment, and this sequence of transitions lasts a total duration that\nincreases with increasing system-environment coupling strength. These results\nprovide an intuitive understanding of Landau-Zener transitions in open\nmultilevel quantum systems.\n", "  Visible-light observations of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) performed with\ncoronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (in primis on board the SOHO and STEREO\nmissions) have offered so far the best way to study the kinematics and\ngeometrical structure of these fundamental events. Nevertheless, it has been\nwidely demonstrated that only combination of multi-wavelength data (including\nX-ray spectra, EUV images, EUV-UV spectra, and radio dynamic spectra) can\nprovide complete information on the plasma temperature and density\ndistributions, non-thermal motions, magnetic fields, and other physical\nparameters, for both CMEs and CME-related phenomena. In this work, we analyze\nthree CMEs by combining simultaneous data acquired in the polarized visible\nlight by the LASCO-C2 coronagraph and in the UV H I Lyman-$\\alpha$ line (1216\n\\AA) by the UVCS spectrometer, in order to estimate the CME plasma electron\ndensity (using the polarization-ratio technique to infer the 3D structure of\nthe CME) and temperature (from the comparison between the expected and measured\nLyman-$\\alpha$ intensities) along the UVCS field of view. This analysis is\nprimarily aimed at testing the diagnostic methods that will be applied to\ncoronagraphic observations of CMEs delivered by the Metis instrument on board\nthe next ESA-Solar Orbiter mission. We find that CME cores are usually\nassociated with cooler plasma ($T \\sim 10^6$ K), and that a significant\nincrease of the electron temperatures is observed from the core to the front of\nthe CME (where $T > 10^{6.3}$ K), which seems to be correlated, in all cases,\nwith the morphological structure of the CME as derived from visible-light\nimages.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of mutual synchronization of magnetic\nnanooscillators driven by pure spin current generated by nonlocal spin\ninjection. We show that the oscillators efficiently synchronize due to the\ndirect spatial overlap of the dynamical modes excited by spin current, which is\nfacilitated by the large size of the auto-oscillation area inherent to these\ndevices. The synchronization occurs within an interval of the driving current\ndetermined by the competition between the dynamic nonlinearity that facilitates\nsynchronization, and the short-wavelength magnetic fluctuations enhanced by the\nspin current that suppress synchronization. The demonstrated synchronization\neffects can be utilized to control the spatial and spectral characteristics of\nthe dynamical states induced by spin currents.\n", "  Explicit symplectic integrators have been important tools for accurate and\nefficient approximations of mechanical systems with separable Hamiltonians. For\nthe first time, the article proposes for arbitrary Hamiltonians similar\nintegrators, which are explicit, of any even order, symplectic in an extended\nphase space, and with pleasant long time properties. They are based on a\nmechanical restraint that binds two copies of phase space together. Using\nbackward error analysis, KAM theory, and additional multiscale analysis, an\nerror bound of $\\mathcal{O}(T\\delta^l \\omega)$ is established for integrable\nsystems, where $T$, $\\delta$, $l$ and $\\omega$ are respectively the (long)\nsimulation time, step size, integrator order, and some binding constant. For\nnon-integrable systems with positive Lyapunov exponents, such an error bound is\ngenerally impossible, but satisfactory statistical behaviors were observed in a\nnumerical experiment with a nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  We propose an innovative, easy-to-implement approach to synthesize large-area\nsinglecrystalline graphene sheets by chemical vapor deposition on copper foil.\nThis method doubly takes advantage of residual oxygen present in the gas phase.\nFirst, by slightly oxidizing the copper surface, we induce grain boundary\npinning in copper and, in consequence, the freezing of the thermal\nrecrystallization process. Subsequent reduction of copper under hydrogen\nsuddenly unlocks the delayed reconstruction, favoring the growth of\ncentimeter-sized copper (111) grains through the mechanism of abnormal grain\ngrowth. Second, the oxidation of the copper surface also drastically reduces\nthe nucleation density of graphene. This oxidation/reduction sequence leads to\nthe synthesis of aligned millimeter-sized monolayer graphene domains in\nepitaxial registry with copper (111). The as-grown graphene flakes are\ndemonstrated to be both single-crystalline and of high quality.\n", "  Level energies, wavelengths, electric dipole, magnetic dipole, electric\nquadrupole, and magnetic quadrupole transition rates, oscillator strengths, and\nline strengths from combined relativistic configuration interaction and\nmany-body perturbation calculations are reported for the 201 fine-structure\nstates of the $2s^2 2p^6$, $2s^2 2p^5 3l$, $2s 2p^6 3l$, $2s^2 2p^5 4l$, $2s\n2p^6 4l$, $2s^2 2p^5 5l$, and $2s^2 2p^5 6l$ configurations in all Ne-like ions\nbetween Cr XV and Kr XXVII. Calculated level energies and transition data are\ncompared with experiments from the NIST and CHIANTI databases, and other recent\nbenchmark calculations. The mean energy difference with the NIST experiments is\nonly 0.05%. The present calculations significantly increase the amount of\naccurate spectroscopic data for the $n >3$ states in a number of Ne-like ions\nof astrophysics interest. A complete dataset should be helpful in analyzing new\nobservations from the solar and other astrophysical sources, and is also likely\nto be useful for modeling and diagnosing a variety of plasmas including\nastronomical and fusion plasma.\n", "  Using Non-Redundant Mask interferometry (NRM), we searched for binary\ncompanions to objects previously classified as Transitional Disks (TD). These\nobjects are thought to be an evolutionary stage between an optically thick disk\nand optically thin disk. We investigate the presence of a stellar companion as\na possible mechanism of material depletion in the inner region of these disks,\nwhich would rule out an ongoing planetary formation process in distances\ncomparable to the binary separation. For our detection limits, we implement a\nnew method of completeness correction using a combination of randomly sampled\nbinary orbits and Bayesian inference. The selected sample of 24 TDs belong to\nthe nearby and young star forming regions: Ophiuchus ($\\sim$ 130 pc),\nTaurus-Auriga ($\\sim$ 140 pc) and IC348 ( $\\sim$ 220 pc). These regions are\nsuitable to resolve faint stellar companions with moderate to high confidence\nlevels at distances as low as 2 au from the central star. With a total of 31\nobjects, including 11 known TDs and circumbinary disks from the literature, we\nhave found that a fraction of 0.38 $\\pm$ 0.09 of the SEDs of these objects are\nlikely due to the tidal interaction between a close binary and its disk, while\nthe remaining SEDs are likely the result of other internal processes such as\nphotoevaporation, grain growth, planet disk interactions. In addition, we\ndetected four companions orbiting outside the area of the truncation radii and\nwe propose that the IR excesses of these systems are due to a disk orbiting a\nsecondary companion\n", "  Cosmological solutions with a scalar field behaving as radiation are\nobtained, in the context of gravitational theory with dynamical time. The\nsolution requires the spacial curvature of the universe k, to be zero, unlike\nthe standard radiation solutions, which do not impose any constraint on the\nspacial curvature of the universe. This is because only such $ k=0 $ radiation\nsolutions poses a homothetic Killimg vector. This kind of theory can be used to\ngeneralize electromagnetism and other gauge theories, in curved space time, and\nthere are no deviations from standard gauge filed equation (like Maxwell\nequations) in the case there exist a conformal Killing vector. But there could\nbe departures from Maxwell and Yang Mills equations, for more general space\ntimes.\n", "  We present the calibration of the [$\\alpha$/Fe] element in terms of the\nultra-violet excess for 469 dwarf stars with $0.325<(B-V)_0 \\leq 0.775$ mag\ncorresponding the spectral type range F0-K2. The star sample is separated into\nnine sub-samples with equal range in $(B-V)_0$ colour, $\\Delta(B-V)_0=0.05$\nmag, and a third degree polynomial is fitted to each dataset. Our calibrations\nprovide [$\\alpha$/Fe] elements in the range [0.0, 0.4]. We applied the\nprocedure to two sets of field stars and two sets of clusters. The mean and the\ncorresponding standard deviation of the residuals for 43 field stars taken from\nthe Hypatia catalogue are [$\\alpha$/Fe]=-0.090 and $\\sigma =0.102$ dex, while\nfor the 39 ones taken from the same catalogue of stars used in the calibration\nare [$\\alpha$/Fe]=-0.009 and $\\sigma = 0.079$ dex, respectively. We showed that\nthe differences between the mean of the residuals and standard deviations for\ntwo sets of clusters ([$\\alpha$/Fe]=0.073 and $\\sigma = 0.91$ dex;\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]=-0.012 and $\\sigma = 0.053$ dex) originate from the $(B-V)_0$ and\n$(U-B)_0$ colour indices of the clusters which are taken from different\nsources. The differences between the original [$\\alpha$/Fe] elements and the\nestimated ones (the residuals) are compatible with the uncertainties in the\nliterature. Also, there is a good agreement between the distribution of the\nsynthetic alpha elements versus ultra-violet excesses and the ones obtained via\nour calibrations.\n", "  We investigate the deviation in the couplings of the standard model (SM) like\nHiggs boson ($h$) with a mass of 125 GeV from the prediction of the SM in\nmulti-doublet models within the framework where flavour changing neutral\ncurrents at the tree level are naturally forbidden. After we present the\ngeneral expressions for the modified gauge and Yukawa couplings for $h$, we\nshow the correlation between the deviation in the Yukawa coupling for the tau\nlepton $h\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and that for the bottom quark $hb\\bar{b}$ under the\nassumption of a non-zero deviation in the $hVV$ $(V=W,Z)$ couplings in two\nHiggs doublet models (2HDMs) and three Higgs doublet models (3HDMs) as simple\nexamples. We clarify the possible allowed prediction of the deviations in the\n3HDMs which cannot be explained in the 2HDMs even taking into account the\none-loop electroweak corrections to the Yukawa coupling.\n", "  The scaling theory of Grossmann and Lohse (J. Fluid Mech. 407, 27 (2000)) for\nthe turbulent heat and momentum transfer is extended to the magnetoconvection\ncase in the presence of a (strong) vertical magnetic field. The comparison with\nexisting laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations in the\nquasistatic limit allows to restrict the parameter space to very low Prandtl\nand magnetic Prandtl numbers and thus to reduce the number of unknown\nparameters in the model. Also included is the Chandrasekhar limit for which the\nouter magnetic induction field B is large enough such that convective motion is\nsuppressed and heat is transported by diffusion. Our theory identifies four\ndistinct regimes of magnetoconvection which are distinguished by the strength\nof the outer magnetic field and the level of turbulence in the flow,\nrespectively.\n", "  We investigate how rotationally-constrained, deep convection might give rise\nto supergranulation, the largest distinct spatial scale of convection observed\nin the solar photosphere. While supergranulation is only weakly influenced by\nrotation, larger spatial scales of convection sample the deep convection zone\nand are presumably rotationally influenced. We present numerical results from a\nseries of nonlinear, 3-D simulations of rotating convection and examine the\nvelocity power distribution realized under a range of Rossby numbers. When\nrotation is present, the convective power distribution possesses a pronounced\npeak, at characteristic wavenumber $\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$, whose value increases\nas the Rossby number is decreased. This distribution of power contrasts with\nthat realized in non-rotating convection, where power increases monotonically\nfrom high to low wavenumbers. We find that spatial scales smaller than\n$\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$ behave in analogy to non-rotating convection. Spatial\nscales larger than $\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$ are rotationally-constrained and\npossess substantially reduced power relative to the non-rotating system. We\nargue that the supergranular scale emerges due to a suppression of power on\nspatial scales larger than $\\ell\\approx100$ owing to the presence of deep,\nrotationally-constrained convection. Supergranulation thus represents the\nlargest non-rotationally-constrained mode of solar convection. We conclude that\nthe characteristic spatial scale of supergranulation bounds that of the deep\nconvective motions from above, making supergranulation an indirect measure of\nthe deep-seated dynamics at work in the solar dynamo. Using the spatial scale\nof supergranulation in conjunction with our numerical results, we estimate an\nupper bound of 10 m s$^{-1}$ for the Sun's bulk rms convective velocity.\n", "  By measuring the thermoelectric effect in high-mobility quantum wells with\ntwo occupied subbands in perpendicular magnetic field, we detect magnetophonon\noscillations due to interaction of electrons with acoustic phonons. These\noscillations contain specific features identified as combined resonances caused\nby intersubband phonon-assisted transitions of electrons in the presence of\nLandau quantization. The quantum theory of phonon-drag magnetothermoelectric\neffect, generalized to the case of multi-subband occupation, describes our\nexperimental findings.\n", "  We are pursuing a project to build a database of phase calibration sources\nsuitable for Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). Here we present the first\nrelease of 45 low frequency calibration sources at 235 MHz and 610 MHz. These\ncalibration sources are broadly divided into quasars, radio galaxies and\nunidentified sources. We provide their flux densities, models for calibration\nsources, (u,v) plots, final deconvolved restored maps and clean-component\nlists/files for use in the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) and the\nCommon Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). We also assign a quality factor\nto each of the calibration sources. These data products are made available\nonline through the GMRT observatory website. In addition we find that (i) these\n45 low frequency calibration sources are uniformly distributed in the sky and\nfuture efforts to increase the size of the database should populate the sky\nfurther, (ii) spectra of these calibration sources are about equally divided\nbetween straight, curved and complex shapes, (iii) quasars tend to exhibit\nflatter radio spectra as compared to the radio galaxies or the unidentified\nsources, (iv) quasars are also known to be radio variable and hence possibly\nshow complex spectra more frequently, and (v) radio galaxies tend to have\nsteeper spectra, which are possibly due to the large redshifts of distant\ngalaxies causing the shift of spectrum to lower frequencies.\n", "  It is believed that type II radio bursts are generated by shock waves. In\norder to understand the generation conditions of type II radio bursts, in this\npaper, we analyze the physical parameters of a shock front. The type II radio\nburst we selected was observed by Siberian Solar Radio Telescope (SSRT) and\nLearmonth radio station and was associated with a limb CME occurring on 2014\nJanuary 8 observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO). The evolution of the CME in the inner corona\npresents a double-layered structure that propagates outward. We fit the outer\nlayer of the structure with a partial circle and divide it into 7 directions\nfrom -45$^\\circ$ to 45$^\\circ$ with an angular separation of 15$^\\circ$. We\nmeasure the outer layer speed along the 7 directions, and find that the speed\nin the direction of -15$^\\circ$ with respect to the central direction is the\nfastest. We use the differential emission measure (DEM) method to calculate the\nphysical parameters at the outer layer at the moment when the type II radio\nburst was initiated, including the temperature ($T$), emission measure ($EM$),\ntemperature ratio ($T_{d}/T_{u}$), compression ratio ($X$), and Alfv\\'en Mach\nnumber ($M_{A}$). We compare the quantities $X$ and $M_{A}$ to that obtained\nfrom band-splitting in the radio spectrum, and find that this type II radio\nburst is generated at a small region of the outer layer that is located at the\nsector in 45$^\\circ$ direction. The results suggest that the generation of type\nII radio bursts (shock) requires larger values of $X$ and $M_{A}$ rather than\nsimply a higher speed of the disturbance.\n", "  We investigate the reliability of mass estimators based on the observable\nvelocity dispersion and half-light radius $R_\\mathrm{h}$ for\ndispersion-supported galaxies. We show how to extend them to flattened systems\nand provide simple formulae for the mass within an ellipsoid under the\nassumption the dark matter density and the stellar density are stratified on\nthe same self-similar ellipsoids. We demonstrate explicitly that the spherical\nmass estimators (Walker et al. 2009, Wolf et al. 2010) give accurate values for\nthe mass within the half-light ellipsoid, provided $R_\\mathrm{h}$ is replaced\nby its `circularized' analogue $R_\\mathrm{h}\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon}$. We provide a\nmathematical justification for this surprisingly simple and effective\nworkaround. It means, for example, that the mass-to-light ratios are valid not\njust when the light and dark matter are spherically distributed, but also when\nthey are flattened on ellipsoids of the same constant shape.\n", "  We consider the set-up of stationary Zero Range models and discuss the onset\nof condensation induced by a local blockage on the lattice. We show that the\nintroduction of a local feedback on the hopping rates allows to control the\nparticle fraction in the condensed phase. This phenomenon results in a current\nvs. blockage parameter curve characterized by two non--analyticity points.\n", "  Channel flow, the pressure driven flow between parallel plates, has exact\ncoherent structures that show various degrees of localization. For states which\nare localized in streamwise direction but extended in spanwise direction, we\nshow that they are exponentially localized, with decay constants that are\ndifferent on the upstream and downstream side. We extend the analysis of Brand\nand Gibson [J. Fluid Mech. 750, R1 (2014)] for stationary states to the case of\nadvected structures that is needed here, and derive expressions for the decay\nin terms of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of certain second order differential\nequations. The results are in very good agreement with observations on exact\ncoherent structures of different transversal wave lengths.\n", "  We have studied the cooling dynamics, formation process and geometric\nstructure of mesoscopic crystals of externally produced magnesium ions in a\nPenning trap. We present a cooling model and measurements for a combination of\nbuffer gas cooling and laser cooling which has been found to reduce the ion\nkinetic energy by eight orders of magnitude from several hundreds of eV to\nmicro-eV and below within seconds. With ion numbers of the order of 1000 to\n100000, such cooling leads to the formation of ion Coulomb crystals which\ndisplay a characteristic shell structure in agreement with theory of\nnon-neutral plasmas. We show the production and characterization of two-species\nion crystals as a means of sympathetic cooling of ions lacking a suitable\nlaser-cooling transition.\n", "  Lifetime measurements using beam foil techniques for the $5s5p^{2}$\n$^{2}D_{3/2,5/2}$ levels in Sn II are presented. The resulting oscillator\nstrengths for transitions at 1699.4, 1831.8 and 1811.2 \\AA{} are reported. We\nalso studied these levels with multi-configuration Dirac Hartree-Fock (MCDHF)\ncalculations using a development version of the GRASP2K package. Our\nexperimental and theoretical results are compared with other available studies.\n", "  Roughly half of all stars reside in galaxies without significant ongoing star\nformation. However, galaxy formation models indicate that it is energetically\nchallenging to suppress the cooling of gas and the formation of stars in\ngalaxies that lie at the centers of their dark matter halos. In this Letter, we\nshow that the dependence of quiescence on black hole and stellar mass is a\npowerful discriminant between differing models for the mechanisms that suppress\nstar formation. Using observations of 91 star-forming and quiescent central\ngalaxies with directly-measured black hole masses, we find that quiescent\ngalaxies host more massive black holes than star-forming galaxies with similar\nstellar masses. This observational result is in qualitative agreement with\nmodels that assume that effective, more-or-less continuous AGN feedback\nsuppresses star formation, strongly suggesting the importance of the black hole\nin producing quiescence in central galaxies.\n", "  It is well-known that the dominant mechanism to produce hadronic bound states\nwith large transverse momentum is fragmentation. This mechanism is described by\nthe fragmentation functions (FFs) which are the universal and\nprocess-independent functions. Here, we review the perturbative FFs formalism\nas an appropriate tool for studying these hadronization processes and detail\nthe extension of this formalism at next-to-leading order (NLO). Using the\nSuzuki's model, we calculate the perturbative QCD FF for a heavy quark to\nfragment into a S-wave heavy meson at NLO. As an example, we study the LO and\nNLO FFs for a charm quark to split into the S-wave $D$-meson and compare our\nanalytic results both with experimental data and well-known phenomenological\nmodels.\n", "  Three-dimensional equi-potential surfaces of a galactic system with\nsupermassive binary black holes are discussed herein. The conditions of\ntopological transitions for the important surfaces, i.e. Roche Lobes and\nJiang-Yeh Lobe, are studied in this paper. In addition, the mathematical\nproperties of the Jacobi surfaces are investigated analytically. Finally, a\nnumerical procedure for determining the regions of the Roche Lobes and\nJiang-Yeh Lobe is suggested.\n", "  The long-term magnetic behavior of objects near the cooler end of the stellar\nmain sequence is poorly understood. Most theoretical work on the generation of\nmagnetism in these ultracool dwarfs (spectral type >=M7 stars and brown dwarfs)\nsuggests that their magnetic fields should not change in strength and\ndirection. Using polarized radio emission measurements of their magnetic field\norientations, I demonstrate that these cool, low-mass, fully-convective objects\nappear to undergo magnetic polarity reversals analogous to those that occur on\nthe Sun. This powerful new technique potentially indicates that the patterns of\nmagnetic activity displayed by the Sun continue to exist, despite the fully\nconvective interiors of these objects, in contravention of several leading\ntheories of the generation of magnetic fields by internal dynamos.\n", "  We show that two spatially separated semiconductor quantum dots under\nresonant and continuous-wave excitation can be strongly entangled in the\nsteady-state, thanks to their radiative coupling by mutual interaction through\nthe normal modes of a photonic crystal dimer. We employ a quantum master\nequation formalism to quantify the steady-state entanglement by calculating the\nsystem {\\it negativity}. Calculations are specified to consider realistic\nsemiconductor nanostructure parameters for the photonic crystal dimer-quantum\ndots coupled system, determined by a guided mode expansion solution of Maxwell\nequations. Negativity values of the order of 0.1 ($20\\%$ of the maximum value)\nare shown for interdot distances that are larger than the resonant wavelength\nof the system. It is shown that the amount of entanglement is almost\nindependent of the interdot distance, as long as the normal mode splitting of\nthe photonic dimer is larger than their linewidths, which becomes the only\nrequirement to achieve a local and individual qubit addressing. Considering\ninhomogeneously broadened quantum dots, we find that the steady-state\nentanglement is preserved as long as the detuning between the two quantum dot\nresonances is small when compared to their decay rates. The steady-state\nentanglement is shown to be robust against the effects of pure dephasing of the\nquantum dot transitions. We finally study the entanglement dynamics for a\nconfiguration in which one of the two quantum dots is initially excited and\nfind that the transient negativity can be enhanced by more than a factor of two\nwith respect to the steady-state value. These results are promising for\npractical applications of entangled states at short time scales.\n", "  Cuprate materials, like those hosting high temperature superconductivity,\nrepresent a famous class of materials where the correlations between the\nstrongly entangled charges and spins produce complex phase diagrams. Several\nyears ago the Zhang-Rice singlet was proposed as a natural quasiparticle in\nhole-doped cuprates. The occurance and binding energy of this quasiparticle,\nconsisting of a pair of bound holes with antiparallel spins on the same CuO$_4$\nplaquette, depends on the local electronic interactions, which are fundamental\nquantities for understanding the physics of the cuprates. Here, we employ\nstate-of-the-art Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) to probe the\ncorrelated physics of the CuO$_4$ plaquettes in the quasi-one dimensional chain\ncuprate Li$_2$CuO$_2$. By tuning the incoming photon energy to the O $K$-edge,\nwe populate bound states related to the Zhang-Rice quasiparticles in the RIXS\nprocess. Both intra- and interchain Zhang-Rice singlets are observed and their\noccurrence is shown to depend on the nearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations,\nwhich are readily probed in this experiment. We also extract the binding energy\nof the Zhang-Rice singlet and identify the Zhang-Rice triplet excitation in the\nRIXS spectra.\n", "  The end of inflation is connected to the standard cosmological scenario\nthrough reheating. During reheating, the inflaton oscillates around the minimum\nof the potential and thus decays into the daughter particles that populate the\nUniverse at later times. Using cosmological evolution for observable CMB scales\nfrom the time of Hubble crossing to the present time, we translate the\nconstraint on the spectral index $n_s$ from Planck data to the constraint on\nthe reheating scenario in the context of K\\\"ahler Moduli Inflation. In\naddition, we extend the de-facto analysis generally done only for the pivot\nscale to all the observable scales which crossed the Hubble radius during\ninflation. We study how the maximum number of e-folds varies for different\nscales, and the effect of the equation of state and potential parameters.\n", "  In the highly structured solar corona, resonant absorption is an unavoidable\nmechanism of energy transfer from global transverse MHD waves to local\nazimuthal Alfv\\'en waves. Due to its localised nature, a direct detection of\nthis mechanism is extremely difficult. Yet, it is the leading theory explaining\nthe observed fast damping of the global transverse waves. However, at odds with\nthis theoretical prediction, recent observations indicate that in the low\namplitude regime such transverse MHD waves can also appear decay-less, a yet\nunsolved phenomenon. Recent numerical work has shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities (KHI) often accompany transverse MHD waves. In this work, we\ncombine 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling to show that for currently\nachieved spatial resolution and observed small amplitudes, an apparent\ndecay-less oscillation is obtained. This effect results from the combination of\nperiodic brightenings produced by the KHI and the coherent motion of the KHI\nvortices amplified by resonant absorption. Such effect is especially clear in\nemission lines forming at temperatures that capture the boundary dynamics\nrather than the core, and reflects the low damping character of the local\nazimuthal Alfv\\'en waves resonantly coupled to the kink mode. Due to phase\nmixing, the detected period can vary depending on the emission line, with those\nsensitive to the boundary having shorter periods than those sensitive to the\nloop core. This allows to estimate the density contrast at the boundary.\n", "  We present analyses of archival X-ray data obtained from the XMM-Newton\nsatellite and optical photometric data obtained from 1 m class telescopes of\nARIES, Nainital of a magnetic cataclysmic variable (MCV) Paloma. Two persistent\nperiods at 156 $\\pm$ 1 minutes and 130 $\\pm$ 1 minutes are present in the X-ray\ndata, which we interpret as the orbital and spin periods, respectively. These\nperiods are similar to those obtained from the previous as well as new optical\nphotometric observations. The soft-X-ray excess seen in the X-ray spectrum of\nPaloma and the averaged X-ray spectra are well fitted by two-temperature plasma\nmodels with temperatures of 0.10$_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ and 13.0$_{-0.5}^{+0.5}$ keV\nwith an Fe K$\\alpha$ line and an absorbing column density of 4.6 $\\times$\n10^{22} cm^{-2}. This material partially covers 60 $\\pm$ 2 % of the X-ray\nsource. We also present the orbital and spin-phase-resolved spectroscopy of\nPaloma in the $0.3 - 10.0$ keV energy band and find that the X-ray spectral\nparameters show orbital and spin-phase dependencies. New results obtained from\noptical and X-ray studies of Paloma indicate that it belongs to a class of a\nfew magnetic CVs that seem to have the characteristics of both the polars and\nthe intermediate polars.\n", "  The conservation of lepton number is assumed to be associated with a general\nYang-Mills symmetry. New transformations involve (Lorentz) vector gauge\nfunctions and characteristic phase functions, and they form a group. General\nYang-Mills fields are associated with new fourth-order equations and linear\npotentials. Lepton self-masses turn out to be finite and proportional to the\ninverse of lepton masses, which implies that neutrinos should have non-zero\nmasses. Thus, general Yang-Mills symmetry could provide an understanding of\nneutrino oscillations and suggests that neutrinos with masses and very weak\nleptonic force may play a role in dark matter.\n", "  Encoding qubits in multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a quantum system\nallows less-decoherence quantum information processing with much less quantum\nresources. We present a compact and scalable quantum circuit to determinately\nimplement a hyper-parallel controlled-controlled-phase-flip\n(hyper-$\\rm{C^2PF}$) gate on a three-photon system in both the polarization and\nspatial DOFs. In contrast with the one with many qubits encoding in one DOF\nonly, our hyper-$\\rm{C^2PF}$ gate operating two independent $\\rm{C^2PF}$ gates\non a three-photon system with less decoherence, and reduces the quantum\nresources required in quantum information processing by a half. Additional\nphotons, necessary for many approaches, are not required in the present scheme.\nOur calculation shows that this hyper-$\\rm{C^2PF}$ gate is feasible in\nexperiment.\n", "  Compared with a qubit, a qutrit (i.e., three-level quantum system) has a\nlarger Hilbert space and thus can be used to encode more information in quantum\ninformation processing and communication. Here, we propose a scheme to transfer\nan arbitrary quantum state between two flux qutrits coupled to two resonators.\nThis scheme is simple because it only requires two basic operations. The\nstate-transfer operation can be performed fast because of using resonant\ninteractions only. Numerical simulations show that high-fidelity transfer of\nquantum states between the two qutrits is feasible with current circuit-QED\ntechnology. This scheme is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the\nsame task for other solid-state qutrits coupled to resonators.\n", "  The high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the\nPlanck survey yielded tight constraints on cosmological parameters and the\nstatistics of the density fluctuations at the time of recombination. This\nprovides the means for a critical study of structure formation in the Universe\nby comparing the microwave background results with present epoch measurements\nof the cosmic large-scale structure. It can reveal subtle effects such as how\ndifferent forms of Dark Matter may modify structure growth. Currently most\ninteresting is the damping effect of structure growth by massive neutrinos.\nDifferent observations of low redshift matter density fluctuations provided\nevidence for a signature of massive neutrinos. Here we discuss the study of the\ncosmic large-scale structure with a complete sample of nearby, X-ray luminous\nclusters from our REFLEX cluster survey. From the observed X-ray luminosity\nfunction and its reproduction for different cosmological models, we obtain\ntight constraints on the cosmological parameters describing the matter density,\nOmega_m, and the density fluctuation amplitude, sigma_8. A comparison of these\nconstraints with the Planck results shows a discrepancy in the framework of a\npure LambdaCDM model, but the results can be reconciled, if we allow for a\nneutrino mass in the range of 0.17 to 0.7 eV. Also some others, but not all of\nthe observations of the nearby large-scale structure provide evidence or trends\nfor signatures of massive neutrinos. With further improvement in the\nsystematics and future survey projects, these indications will develop into a\ndefinitive measurement of neutrino masses.\n", "  A Fourier transform analysis of 2.5 million spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey was carried out to detect periodic spectral modulations. Signals having\nthe same period were found in only 234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1\nspectral range. The signals cannot be caused by instrumental or data analysis\neffects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within\na narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations\npredict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects,\nwhile this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as\nrotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of\nspectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI).\nThey cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly\nunlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because\ntoo many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed.\nFinally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper,\nthat the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial\nIntelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected\nsignals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous\npublication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that\nthey are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral\nrange centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the\nETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed\nwith further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the\nsignals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of\ngalactic halo stars.\n", "  The central role played by pseudodifferential operators in relativistic\ndynamics is very well know. In this work, operators as the Schrodinger one\n(e.g: square root) are treated from the point of view of the non-local\npseudodifferential Green functions. Starting from the explicit construction of\nthe Green (semigroup) theoretical kernel, a theorem linking the integrability\nconditions and their dependence on the spacetime dimensions is given.\nRelativistic wave equations with arbitrary spin and the causality problem are\ndiscussed with the algebraic interpretation of the radical operator and their\nrelation with coherent and squeezed states. Also we perform by mean of pure\ntheoretical procedures (based in physical concepts and symmetry) the\nrelativistic position operator which satisfies the conditions of integrability\n: it is non-local, Lorentz invariant and does not have the same problems as the\n\"local\"position operator proposed by Newton and Wigner. Physical examples, as\nZitterbewegung and rogue waves, are presented and deeply analysed in this\ntheoretical framework.\n", "  Recent high angular resolution ($\\sim$0.2\") ALMA observations of the 1.1 mm\ncontinuum and of HCO+ J=3-2 and HCN J=3-2 gas towards the binary protostar IRS\n43 reveal multiple Keplerian disks which are significantly misaligned ($\\gt$\n60$^\\circ$), both in inclination and position angle and also with respect to\nthe binary orbital plane. Each stellar component has an associated\ncircumstellar disk while the binary is surrounded by a circumbinary disk.\nTogether with archival VLA measurements of the stellar positions over 25 years,\nand assuming a circular orbit, we use our continuum measurements to determine\nthe binary separation, a = 74 $\\pm$ 4 AU, and its inclination, i $\\lt$\n30$^\\circ$. The misalignment in this system suggests that turbulence has likely\nplayed a major role in the formation of IRS 43.\n", "  Thermally-activated magnetization dynamics of small nanoparticles subject to\nmicrowave (AC) external fields is studied. It is shown that, under sufficiently\nstrong microwave excitations, chaotic magnetization dynamics may occur close to\nsaddle-type heteroclinic connections, and this heteroclinic chaos is\nresponsible for the erosion of the safe basin around stable magnetization\nstates. The erosion phenomenon is then connected to the escape problem from the\nenergy well surrounding a stable equilibrium. It is shown that escape times\nfollow a generalized Arrhenius' law governed by temperature, microwave field\namplitude, frequency and heteroclinic chaos threshold.\n", "  We investigate the measurement of the sixth order cumulant and its ratio to\nthe second order cumulant ($C_6/C_2$) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The\ninfluence of statistics and different methods of centrality bin width\ncorrection on $C_6/C_2$ of net-proton multiplicity distributions is\ndemonstrated. There is no satisfactory method to extract $C_6/C_2$ with the\ncurrent statistics recorded at lower energies by STAR at RHIC. With statistics\ncomparable to the expected statistics at the planned future RHIC Beam Energy\nScan II (BES II), no energy dependence of $C_6/C_2$ is observed in central\ncollisions using the UrQMD model. We find if the transition signal is as strong\nas predicted by the PQM model, then it is hopefully observed at the upcoming\nRHIC BES II.\n", "  In the traditional setup of public goods game all players are involved in\nevery available groups and the mutual benefit is shared among competing\ncooperator and defector strategies. But in real life situations the group\nformation of players could be more sophisticated because not all players are\nattractive enough for others to participate in a joint venture. What if only\nthose players can initiate a group formation and establish a game who are\nsuccessful enough to the neighbors? To elaborate this idea we employ a modified\nprotocol and demonstrate that a carefully chosen threshold to establish joint\nventure could efficiently improve the cooperation level even if the synergy\nfactor would suggest a full defector state otherwise. The microscopic mechanism\nwhich is responsible for this effect is based on the asymmetric consequences of\ncompeting strategies: while the success of a cooperator provides a long-time\nwell-being for the neighborhood, the temporary advantage of defection cannot be\nmaintained if the protocol is based on the success of leaders.\n", "  We use Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy to measure the first velocity and metallicity\nof a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy beyond the Local Group using resolved\nstars. Our target, d0944+71, is a faint dSph found in the halo of the massive\nspiral galaxy M81 by Chiboucas et al. We coadd the spectra of 27 individual\nstars and measure a heliocentric radial velocity of $-38\\pm10$~km/s. This\nvelocity is consistent with d0944+71 being gravitationally bound to M81. We\ncoadd the spectra of the 23 stars that are consistent with being red giant\nbranch stars and measure an overall metallicity of ${\\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.3 \\pm 0.3$\nbased on the calcium triplet lines. This metallicity is consistent with\nd0944+71 following the metallicity$-$luminosity relation for Local Group dSphs.\nWe investigate several potential sources of observational bias but find that\nour sample of targeted stars is representative of the metallicity distribution\nfunction of d0944+71 and any stellar contamination due to seeing effects is\nnegligible. The low ellipticity of the galaxy and its position in the\nmetallicity$-$luminosity relation suggest that d0944+71 has not been affected\nby strong tidal stripping.\n", "  Social influence plays an important role in human behavior and decisions. The\nsources of influence can be generally divided into external, which are\nindependent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and\nfriends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by\npeers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and\nobservational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the\nextent of social contagion based on large-scale observational data with an\nunknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap\nbetween the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human\ndynamics and the detailed approach of the social sciences, we present a\nparsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in\npolitical science -- elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical\nexpression of the county vote-share distribution in a two party system, which\nis in excellent agreement with 92 years of observed U.S. presidential election\ndata. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an\nabrupt transition in the patterns of social contagion -- from low to high\nlevels of social contagion. The results from our analysis reveal robust\ndifferences among regions of the United States in terms of their social\ninfluence index. In particular, we identify two regions of 'hot' and 'cold\nspots of social influence, each comprising states that are geographically\nclose. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more\ninstrumental in shaping large scale collective political behavior, which is at\nthe core of democratic societies.\n", "  We developed a new method in order to detect and quantify a potential\nanisotropy in the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray flux. The proposed method is a\nnew statistical tool based upon the percolation process that is used in physics\nto describe the formation of long-range connectivity in random systems.\nSpecifically, we investigate the dynamic of the arrangement of cosmic rays into\nclusters as a function of the maximum angular separation between the arrival\ndirections of a pair of events. In a first step, we characterize the\npercolation process and extract the most sensitive observable through\nMonte-Carlo simulations. We then apply the algorithm to the data taken by the\narray of surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory up to January 2010.\nThe strongest signal appears at an energy threshold of 56.74 EeV and an angular\nscale of 4 for which the hypothesis of isotropy of the arrival directions of\nthe highest-energy cosmic rays is rejected at a nearly 90% C.L.\n", "  We present a new method to derive an upper limit on the ultra-high-energy\n(UHE) photon flux above a given energy, using the Auger SD events. As previous\nstudies, it takes advantage of the fundamental differences between showers\ninduced by hadrons and showers induced by photons (signal rise time, slope of\nthe Lateral Distribution Function, radius of curvature), but it uses photon\nshower simulations adapted to the actually observed SD events, on an\nevent-by-event basis. In particular, we find that a limited number of\nsimulations per event allows to reach an upper limit that is very close to the\nideal case that would be obtained with an infinite number of simulations. For\ninstance, 10 simulated showers per event are sufficient to reach an upper limit\nonly 10 percent higher than the ideal one. As an illustration, we apply this\nmethod to the SD events reconstructed above 55 EeV, which provides an optimized\nupper limit on the photon flux above 150 EeV, and indicate how this can be\neasily extended to the lower-energy events, to constrain the photon flux down\nto much lower energies.\n", "  We demonstrate that partial wave amplitudes extracted from $D^+\\to\nK^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ Dalitz plot with a unitary coupled-channel model are\nsignificantly different from those obtained with an isobar model. The unitary\ncoupled-channel model takes account of hadronic rescattering mechanisms\ninvolving all three mesons that have been missed in conventioanl isobar model\nanalyses. The rescattering mechanisms contribute largely, and can triplicate\nthe $D^+\\to {K}^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay width within our analysis. These findings\ndeliver a warning that analysis results obtained with isobar models should be\nlooked with a caution. The determination of the CKM angle $\\gamma/\\phi_3$ is a\nhighly relevant problem.\n", "  The gas accretion and star-formation histories of galaxies like the Milky Way\nremain an outstanding problem in astrophysics. Observations show that 8 billion\nyears ago, the progenitors to Milky Way-mass galaxies were forming stars 30\ntimes faster than today and predicted to be rich in molecular gas, in contrast\nwith low present-day gas fractions ($<$10%). Here we show detections of\nmolecular gas from the CO(J=3-2) emission (rest-frame 345.8 GHz) in galaxies at\nredshifts z=1.2-1.3, selected to have the stellar mass and star-formation rate\nof the progenitors of today's Milky Way-mass galaxies. The CO emission reveals\nlarge molecular gas masses, comparable to or exceeding the galaxy stellar\nmasses, and implying most of the baryons are in cold gas, not stars. The\ngalaxies' total luminosities from star formation and CO luminosities yield long\ngas-consumption timescales. Compared to local spiral galaxies, the\nstar-formation efficiency, estimated from the ratio of total IR luminosity to\nCO emission,} has remained nearly constant since redshift z=1.2, despite the\norder of magnitude decrease in gas fraction, consistent with results for other\ngalaxies at this epoch. Therefore the physical processes that determine the\nrate at which gas cools to form stars in distant galaxies appear to be similar\nto that in local galaxies.\n", "  We examine the relaxion mechanism in string theory. An essential feature is\nthat an axion winds over $N \\gg 1$ fundamental periods. In string theory\nrealizations via axion monodromy, this winding number corresponds to a physical\ncharge carried by branes or fluxes. We show that this monodromy charge\nbackreacts on the compact space, ruining the structure of the relaxion action.\nIn particular, the barriers generated by strong gauge dynamics have height\n$\\propto e^{-N}$, so the relaxion does not stop when the Higgs acquires a vev.\nBackreaction of monodromy charge can therefore spoil the relaxion mechanism. We\ncomment on the limitations of technical naturalness arguments in this context.\n", "  Observations of type II supernova early light, from breakout until\nrecombination, can be used to constrain the explosion energy and progenitor\nproperties. Currently available for this purpose are purely analytic models,\nwhich are accurate only to within an order of magnitude, and detailed numerical\nsimulations, which are more accurate but are applied to any event separately.\nIn this paper we derive an analytic model that is calibrated by numerical\nsimulations. This model is much more accurate than previous analytic models,\nyet it is as simple to use. To derive the model we analyze simulated light\ncurves from numerical explosion of $124$ red supergiant progenitors, calculated\nusing the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that although the structure of\nthe progenitors we consider varies, the resulting light curves can be described\nrather well based only on the explosion energy, ejecta mass and progenitor\nradius. Our calibrated analytic model, which is based on these three\nparameters, reproduces the bolometric luminosity within $25\\%-35\\%$ accuracy\nand the observed temperature within $15\\%$ accuracy (compared to previous\nanalytic models which are indeed found to be accurate only to within an order\nof magnitude). We also consider deviations of the early time spectrum from\nblackbody, and find that the Rayleigh-Jeans regime is slightly shallower\n(roughly $L_\\nu \\propto \\nu^{1.4}$). This modified spectrum affects the\noptical/near-UV light curve mostly during the first day when the typical\nobserved temperature is $\\gg 10^4 ~^\\circ$K. We use our results to study the\noptical and near-UV early light curves from first light until recombination and\nbriefly discuss what can be learned from current and future observations. Light\ncurves generated using our calibrated model can be downloaded at\nhttp://www.astro.tau.ac.il/~tomersh/.\n", "  We present new versions of the previously published C and CUDA programs for\nsolving the dipolar Gross-Pitaevskii equation in one, two, and three spatial\ndimensions, which calculate stationary and non-stationary solutions by\npropagation in imaginary or real time. Presented programs are improved and\nparallelized versions of previous programs, divided into three packages\naccording to the type of parallelization. First package contains improved and\nthreaded version of sequential C programs using OpenMP. Second package\nadditionally parallelizes three-dimensional variants of the OpenMP programs\nusing MPI, allowing them to be run on distributed-memory systems. Finally,\nprevious three-dimensional CUDA-parallelized programs are further parallelized\nusing MPI, similarly as the OpenMP programs. We also present speedup test\nresults obtained using new versions of programs in comparison with the previous\nsequential C and parallel CUDA programs. The improvements to the sequential\nversion yield a speedup of 1.1 to 1.9, depending on the program. OpenMP\nparallelization yields further speedup of 2 to 12 on a 16-core workstation,\nwhile OpenMP/MPI version demonstrates a speedup of 11.5 to 16.5 on a computer\ncluster with 32 nodes used. CUDA/MPI version shows a speedup of 9 to 10 on a\ncomputer cluster with 32 nodes.\n", "  Link prediction aims to uncover the underlying relationship behind networks,\nwhich could be utilized to predict the missing edges or identify the spurious\nedges, and attracts much attention from various fields. The key issue of link\nprediction is to estimate the likelihood of two nodes in networks. Most current\napproaches of link prediction base on static structural analysis and ignore the\ntemporal aspects of evolving networks. Unlike previous work, in this paper, we\npropose a popularity based structural perturbation method (PBSPM) that\ncharacterizes the similarity of an edge not only from existing connections of\nnetworks, but also from the popularity of its two endpoints, since popular\nnodes have much more probability to form links between themselves. By taking\npopularity of nodes into account, PBSPM could suppress nodes that have high\nimportance, but gradually become inactive. Therefore the proposed method is\ninclined to predict potential edges between active nodes, rather than edges\nbetween inactive nodes. Experimental results on four real networks show that\nthe proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both in accuracy\nand robustness in evolving networks.\n", "  The Standard-Model Extension (SME) provides a comprehensive effective\nfield-theory framework for the study of CPT and Lorentz symmetry. This work\nreviews the structure and philosophy of the SME and provides some intuitive\nexamples of symmetry violation. The results of recent gravitational tests\nperformed within the SME are summarized including analysis of results from the\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), sensitivities\nachieved in short-range gravity experiments, constraints from cosmic-ray data,\nand results achieved by studying planetary ephemerids. Some proposals and\nongoing efforts will also be considered including gravimeter tests, tests of\nthe Weak Equivalence Principle, and antimatter experiments. Our review of the\nabove topics is augmented by several original extensions of the relevant work.\nWe present new examples of symmetry violation in the SME and use the cosmic-ray\nanalysis to place first-ever constraints on 81 additional operators.\n", "  This article is based on the talk \"Fractional Spin Gravity\" presented in the\n31st International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics, Rio de\nJaneiro, 19-25th June 2016. There we emphasised an implication of the works\n[1,2] by N. Boulanger, P. Sundell and the author on fractional spin extensions\nof 2+1D higher spin gravity. This is that higher spin gravity may govern\ninteractions of pseudo-particles excitations in the (fractional) quantum Hall\neffect. More generally, fractional spin currents in 2+1D source higher spin\ngravity curvatures.\n", "  To the working physicist, anyon theory is meant to describe certain\nquasi-particle excitations occurring in two dimensional topologically ordered\nsystems. A typical calculation using this theory will involve operations such\nas $\\otimes$ to combine anyons, $F^{abc}_{d}$ to re-associate such\ncombinations, and $R^{ab}_c$ to commute or braid these anyons. Although there\nis a powerful string-diagram notation that greatly assists these manipulations,\nwe still appear to be operating on particles arranged on a one-dimensional\nline, algebraically ordered from left to right. The obvious question is, where\nis the other dimension? The topological framework for considering these anyons\nas truly living in a two dimensional space is known as a modular functor, or\ntopological quantum field theory. In this work we show how the apparently\none-dimensional algebraic anyon theory is secretly the theory of anyons living\nin a fully two-dimensional system. The mathematical literature covering this\nsecret is vast, and we try to distill this down into something more manageable.\n", "  Squeezing ensemble of spins provides a way to surpass the standard quantum\nlimit (SQL) in quantum metrology and test the fundamental physics as well, and\ntherefore attracts broad interest. Here we propose an experimentally accessible\nprotocol to squeeze a giant ensemble of spins via the geometric phase control.\nUsing the cavity-assisted Raman transitions in a double $\\Lambda$-type system,\nwe realize an effective Dicke model. Under the condition of vanishing effective\nspin transition frequency, we find a particular evolution time where the cavity\ndecouples from the spins and the spin ensemble is squeezed considerably. Our\nscheme has the potential to improve the sensitivity in quantum metrology with\nspins by about two orders.\n", "  A scheme of single-photon multi-port router is put forward by coupling two\noptomechanical cavities with waveguides. It is shown that the coupled two\noptomechanical cavities can exhibit photon blockade effect, which is generated\nfrom interference of three mode interaction. A single-photon travel along the\nsystem is calculated. The results show that the single photon can be controlled\nin the multi-port system because of the radiation pressure, which should be\nuseful for constructing quantum network.\n", "  We extend results of Damanik and Tcheremchantsev on estimating transport\nexponents to initial states supported on more than one site. These general\nresults for upper and lower bounds are then applied to several classes of\nmodels, including Sturmian, quiasi-periodic and substitution-generated\npotentials, and random polymer model.\n", "  Growing planets interact with their natal protoplanetary disc, which exerts a\ntorque onto them allowing them to migrate in the disc. Small mass planets do\nnot affect the gas profile and migrate in the fast type~I migration. Although\ntype~I migration can be directed outwards for planets smaller than $20-30\nM_\\oplus$, planets above this mass should be lost into the central star long\nbefore the disc disperses. Massive planets open a gap and subsequently migrate\nin the slower, type~II migration, which could save them from migrating all the\nway to the star. Hence, growing giant planets can be saved if and only if they\ncan reach the gap opening mass, because this extends their migration\ntime-scale, allowing them to eventually survive at large orbits until the disc\nitself disperses.\n  However, most of the previous studies only measured the torques on planets\nwith fixed masses and orbits to determine the migration rate. Additionally, the\ntransition between type~I and type~II migration itself is not well studied.\nHere we use isothermal 2D disc simulations with FARGO-2D1D to study the\nmigration behaviour of gas accreting protoplanets in discs. We find that\nmigrating giant planets always open gaps in the disc. We further show\nanalytically and numerically that planets growing in the runaway gas accretion\nregime will reach gap opening masses before migrating all the way to the\ncentral star if the disc is not extremely viscous and/or thick. An accretion\nrate limited to the radial gas flow in the disc, in contrast, is not fast\nenough. When gas accretion by the planet is taken into account, the gap opening\nprocess is accelerated because the planet accretes material originating from\nits horseshoe region. This allows an accreting planet to transition to type~II\nmigration before being lost even if gas fails to be provided for a rapid enough\ngrowth and the gap opening mass is not reached.\n", "  The existing controversies about the space group symmetries of Pb(ZrxTi1-x)O3\n(PZT) above and below antiferrodistortive (AFD) phase transition temperature\n(TAFD) in the Zr4+- rich (0.620<x<0.940) compositions are addressed using the\nresults of dielectric, synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction (SXRPD) and neutron\npowder diffraction (NPD) studies. These compositions undergo an AFD phase\ntransition above room temperature due to tilting of oxygen octahedral leading\nto a superlattice phase of PZT. We have substituted 6% Sr2+ at Pb2+-site to\nenhance the tilt angle and thereby the intensity of the superlattice peaks. The\nreal and imaginary parts of complex dielectric permittivity have been used to\nlocate the paraelectric to ferroelectric and ferroelectric to AFD phase\ntransitions. Rietveld analysis of SXRPD and NPD profiles unambiguously reject\nthe rhombohedral phases in R3c and R3m space groups below and above TAFD,\nrespectively, with or without a coexisting monoclinic phase in Cm space group,\nand confirm that the true symmetries are monoclinic in Cc and Cm space groups\nbelow and above TAFD, respectively. Based on these and previous findings a\nphase diagram of PSZT for 0.40<x<0.90 showing stability fields of monoclinic Cc\nand monoclinic Cm, tetragonal P4mm and cubic Pm3m phases has also been\npresented.\n", "  At the tipping point, it is known that small incident can trigger dramatic\nsocietal shift. Getting early-warning signals for such changes are valuable to\navoid detrimental outcomes such as riots or collapses of nations. However, it\nis notoriously hard to capture the processes of such transitions in the\nreal-world. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of a major shift in public\nopinion in the form of political support. Instead of simple swapping of ruling\nparties, we study the regime shift of a party popularity based on its\nattractiveness by examining the American presidential elections during\n1980-2012. A single irreversible transition is detected in 1991. Once a\ntransition happens, recovery to the original level of attractiveness does not\nbring popularity of the political party back. Remarkably, this transition is\ncorroborated by tell-tale early-warning signature of critical slowing down. Our\napproach is applicable to shifts in public attitude within any social system.\n", "  Gamma-ray polarization offers a unique probes into the geometry of the\ngamma-ray emission process in celestial objects. The Soft Gamma-ray Detector\n(SGD) onboard the X-ray observatory Hitomi is a Si/CdTe Compton camera and is\nexpected to be an excellent polarimeter, as well as a highly sensitive\nspectrometer due to its good angular coverage and resolution for Compton\nscattering. A beam test of the final-prototype for the SGD Compton camera was\nconducted to demonstrate its polarimetric capability and to verify and\ncalibrate the Monte Carlo simulation of the instrument. The modulation factor\nof the SGD prototype camera, evaluated for the inner and outer parts of the\nCdTe sensors as absorbers, was measured to be 0.649--0.701 (inner part) and\n0.637--0.653 (outer part) at 122.2 keV and 0.610--0.651 (inner part) and\n0.564--0.592 (outer part) at 194.5 keV at varying polarization angles with\nrespect to the detector. This indicates that the relative systematic\nuncertainty of the modulation factor is as small as ~3%.\n", "  We characterize mission profiles for human expeditions to near-Earth\nasteroids, Venus, and Mars. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are the closest\ndestinations beyond cis-lunar space and present a compelling target with\ncapabilities already under development by NASA and its partners. We present\nmanned NEO mission options that would require between 90 days and one year. We\nnext consider planetary flyby missions for Venus along the lines of plans that\nwere first drafted during the Apollo program for human exploration of Venus. We\nalso characterize a Mars flyby, and a double-flyby variant that would include\nclose passes to both Venus and Mars. Finally, we consider orbital missions to\nVenus and Mars with capability for rendezvous with Phobos or Deimos. This would\nbe a truly new class of mission for astronauts and could serve as a precursor\nto a human landing on Mars. We present launch opportunities, transit time,\nrequisite {\\Delta}V, and approximate radiation environment parameters for each\nmission class. We find that {\\Delta}V requirements for each class of mission\nmatch near-term chemical propulsion system capabilities.\n", "  Context. The mass loss from massive stars is not understood well. Eta Car is\na unique object for studying the massive stellar wind during the LBV phase. It\nis also an eccentric binary with a period of 5.54 yr. The nature of both stars\nis uncertain, although we know from X-ray studies that there is a wind-wind\ncollision whose properties change with orbital phase.\n  Methods. Observations of Eta Car were carried out with the ESO VLTI and the\nAMBER instrument between approximately five and seven months before the August\n2014 periastron passage. Velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images were\nreconstructed from the spectrally dispersed interferograms. Interferometric\nstudies can provide information on the binary orbit, the primary wind, and the\nwind collision.\n  Results. We present velocity-resolved aperture-synthesis images reconstructed\nin more than 100 different spectral channels distributed across the Br Gamma\n2.166 micrometer emission line. The intensity distribution of the images\nstrongly depends on wavelength. At wavelengths corresponding to radial\nvelocities of approximately -140 to -376 km/s measured relative to line center,\nthe intensity distribution has a fan-shaped structure. At the velocity of -277\nkm/s, the position angle of the symmetry axis of the fan is ~ 126 degree. The\nfan-shaped structure extends approximately 8.0 mas (~ 18.8 au) to the southeast\nand 5.8 mas (~ 13.6 au) to the northwest, measured along the symmetry axis at\nthe 16% intensity contour. The shape of the intensity distributions suggests\nthat the obtained images are the first direct images of the innermost wind-wind\ncollision zone. Therefore, the observations provide velocity-dependent image\nstructures that can be used to test three-dimensional hydrodynamical, radiative\ntransfer models of the massive interacting winds of Eta Car.\n", "  We consider a system of two-level quantum quasi-spins and gauge bosons put on\na 3+1D lattice. As a model of neural network of the brain functions, these\nspins describe neurons quantum-mechanically, and the gauge bosons describes\nweights of synaptic connections. It is a generalization of the Hopfield model\nto a quantum network with dynamical synaptic weights. At the microscopic level,\nthis system becomes a model of quantum brain dynamics proposed by Umezawa et\nal., where spins and gauge field describe water molecules and photons,\nrespectively. We calculate the phase diagram of this system under quantum and\nthermal fluctuations, and find that there are three phases; confinement,\nCoulomb, and Higgs phases. Each phase is classified according to the ability to\nlearn patterns and recall them. By comparing the phase diagram with that of\nclassical networks, we discuss the effect of quantum fluctuations and thermal\nfluctuations (noises in signal propagations) on the brain functions.\n", "  Reliability of kinetic parameters are crucial in understanding enzyme\nkinetics within cellular system. The present study suggests a few cautions that\nneed introspection for estimation of parameters like K(M), V(max) and K(I)\nusing Lineweaver-Burk plots. The quality of IC(50) too needs a thorough\nreinvestigation because of its direct link with K(I) and K(M) values.\nInhibition kinetics under both steady-state and non-steady-state conditions are\nstudied and errors in estimated parameters are compared against actual values\nto settle the question of their adequacy.\n", "  We identify a generic class of two dimensional nonstandard Hamiltonian\nsystems which exhibit isochronous behaviour. This class of systems belongs to\nthe two dimensional mixed Li\\'enard- type equations and is obtained by\ngeneralizing the scalar modified Emden equation (MEE) to two dimensions. We\nshow that the generalized class of equations admits a Hamiltonian description\nand exhibits periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations for suitable choice of\nparameters and also $\\emph PT$ symmetric property.\n", "  Magnetic fields of planets, stars and galaxies are generated by\nself-excitation in moving electrically conducting fluids. Once produced,\nmagnetic fields can play an active role in cosmic structure formation by\ndestabilizing rotational flows that would be otherwise hydrodynamically stable.\nFor a long time, both hydromagnetic dynamo action as well as magnetically\ntriggered flow instabilities had been the subject of purely theoretical\nresearch. Meanwhile, however, the dynamo effect has been observed in\nlarge-scale liquid sodium experiments in Riga, Karlsruhe and Cadarache. In this\npaper, we summarize the results of some smaller liquid metal experiments\ndevoted to various magnetic instabilities such as the helical and the azimuthal\nmagnetorotational instability, the Tayler instability, and the different\ninstabilities that appear in a magnetized spherical Couette flow. We conclude\nwith an outlook on a large scale Tayler-Couette experiment using liquid sodium,\nand on the prospects to observe magnetically triggered instabilities of flows\nwith positive shear.\n", "  We consider the $HZ$ associated production at the $14~{\\rm TeV}$ LHC in the\nlittlest Higgs model (LHM) and study the corrections of the transverse momentum\nresummation and threshold resummation at the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL)\naccuracy and the fixed-order prediction at the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO)\nincluding the contribution from the one-loop-induced $gg$-fusion channel. The\nQCD NLO+NLL effects on the integrated cross section and the distributions of\ntransverse momentum and invariant mass of the $HZ$ system for the $HZ$\nproduction in the LHM are discussed. The distributions of transverse momentum\nand invariant mass of the $HZ$ system are evaluated by means of the transverse\nmomentum resummation and threshold resummation, respectively. We estimate their\nscale uncertainties and find that the predictions obtained at the QCD NLO+NLL\naccuracy are much more reliable than those using the pure NLO approach. We see\nalso that the relative deviation between the results in the LHM and the\nstandard model is considerably reduced by the resummation effects, but still\nobservable.\n", "  The length of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is an important metric\nfor the integration of SWCNTs into devices and for the performance of\nSWCNT-based electronic or optoelectronic applications. In this work we propose\na rather simple method based on electric-field induced differential absorption\nspectroscopy (EFIDAS) to measure the chiral-index-resolved average length of\nSWCNTs in dispersions. The method takes advantage of the electric-field induced\nlength-dependent dipole moment of nanotubes and has been verified and\ncalibrated by atomic force microscopy. This method not only provides a low\ncost, in-situ approach for length measurements of SWCNTs in dispersion, but due\nto the sensitivity of the method to the SWCNT chiral index, the chiral index\ndependent average length of fractions obtained by chromatographic sorting can\nalso be derived. Also, the determination of the chiral-index resolved length\ndistribution seems to be possible using this method.\n", "  A large data set of 78 solar proton events observed near the Earth's orbit\nduring 1996-2011 is investigated. An East-West longitudinal (azimuthal)\nasymmetry is found to exist in the distribution of flare sources of solar\nproton events. With the same longitudinal separation between the flare sources\nand the magnetic field line footpoint of observer, the number of the solar\nproton events originating from solar sources located on the eastern side of the\nnominal magnetic footpoint of observer is larger than the number of the solar\nproton events from solar sources located on the western side. We emphasize the\nimportance of this statistical investigation in two aspects. On the one hand,\nthis statistical finding confirms our previous simulation results obtained by\nnumerically solving five-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation of solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) transport. On the other hand, the East-West longitudinally\n(azimuthally) asymmetric distribution of solar proton events accumulated over a\nlong time period provides an observational evidence for the effects of\nperpendicular diffusion on the SEP propagation in the heliosphere. We further\npoint out that, in the sense of perpendicular diffusion, our numerical\nsimulations and statistical results of SEP events confirm each other. We\ndiscuss in detail the important effects of perpendicular diffusion on the\nformation of the East-West azimuthal (longitudinal) asymmetry of SEP\ndistribution in two physical scenarios, i.e., 'multiple SEP events with one\nspacecraft' and 'one SEP event with multiple spacecraft'. A functional relation\nI_{max}(r)=kr^{-1.7} quantifying the radial dependence of SEP peak intensities\nis obtained and utilized in the analysis of physical mechanism. The\nrelationship between our results and those of Dresing et al. is also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the Goos-H\\\"anchen shift for ballistic electrons (i) reflected\nfrom a step-like inhomogeneity of the potential energy and (or) effective mass,\nand (ii) transmitted through a ferromagnetic barrier region in monolayer\nsilicene or gapped graphene. For the electrons reflected from a single\ninterface we found that the Goos-H\\\"anchen shift is valley-polarized for gapped\ngraphene structure, and valley- and spin-polarized for silicene due to the\nspin-valley coupling. Incontrast, for example, to gapless graphene the lateral\nbeam shift in gapped structures occurs not only in the case of total, but also\nof partial, reflection, i.e. at the angles smaller than the critical angle of\ntotal reflection. We have also demonstrated that the valley- and spin-polarized\ndisplacement of the electron beam, transmitted through a ferromagnetic silicene\nbarrier, resonantly depends on the barrier width. The resonant values of the\ndisplacement can be controlled by adjusting the electric potential, the\nexternal perpendicular electric field, and the exchange field induced by an\ninsulating ferromagnetic substrate.\n", "  Microlensings events are predicted for the light coming from cosmological\nsources. In addition to the microlensing due to gravitation lensing,\nmicrolensing produced also by refraction of light due to either ionized, or\nnot, gas clouds can be considered. A detailed prediction is here given assuming\nthat the ray of light coming from the distant source traverses a gas cloud with\na King's density profile for various possible environments. We conclude that\nthe additional deviation due to relativistic refraction is in most cases\nnegligible compared to the gravitational deviation. Deviation due to refraction\ncan anyway become an interesting analysis tool for future facility with great\nresolving power and the effects can be singled out with dedicated surveys.\n", "  The effect of quantum confinement in the optical absorption spectra of\natomically thin {\\alpha}-In2Se3 crystals is studied, observing a huge\nthickness-dependent shift in the optical band gap of exfoliated {\\alpha}-In2Se3\nflakes. The band gap variation reported here is among the largest found in\nsemiconductor crystals and spans a region of the near-UV spectrum uncovered by\nother 2D semiconductors.\n", "  45S5 Hench bio-glass (BG) has gained interest in research because of its\npotential clinical applications. Several studies in-vivo and in-vitro have been\nin progress to improve bio-integration efficiency of this glass. In present\ncontribution, surface modification of Hench BG has been done employing a\nfemtosecond (fs) laser beam, resulting in increased effective surface area of\nthe sample. These surface modified samples were subsequently immersed in\nsimulated body fluid for varying number of days and characterized using\nScanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray\ndiffraction, and micro-Raman spectroscopy. In-vitro studies indicated superior\ngrowth of hydroxyapatite (HAP) layer on the laser treated samples in comparison\nto the untreated samples. Presence of strong XRD peaks confirmed faster growth\nof HAP on laser treated samples. Raman peaks, five times more intense and\nrelatively narrower represented higher crystallinity of hydroxyapatite layer on\nlaser treated BG.\n", "  Graphene is of increasing interest for optoelectronic applications exploiting\nlight detection, light emission and light modulation. Intrinsically light\nmatter interaction in graphene is of a broadband type. However by integrating\ngraphene into optical micro cavities also narrow band light emitters and\ndetectors have been demonstrated. The devices benefit from the transparency,\nconductivity and processability of the atomically thin material. To this end we\nexplore in this work the feasibility of replacing graphene by nanocrystalline\ngraphene, a material which can be grown on dielectric surfaces without catalyst\nby graphitization of polymeric films. We have studied the formation of\nnanocrystalline graphene on various substrates and under different\ngraphitization conditions. The samples were characterized by resistance,\noptical transmission, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force\nmicroscopy and electron microscopy measurements. The conducting and transparent\nwafer-scale material with nanometer grain size was also patterned and\nintegrated into devices for studying light-matter interaction. The measurements\nshow that nanocrystalline graphene can be exploited as an incandescent emitter\nand bolometric detector similar to crystalline graphene. Moreover the material\nexhibits piezoresistive behavior which makes nanocrystalline graphene\ninteresting for transparent strain sensors.\n", "  This study concerns with the diagnosis of aerospace structure defects by\napplying a HPC parallel implementation of a novel learning algorithm, named\nU-BRAIN. The Soft Computing approach allows advanced multi-parameter data\nprocessing in composite materials testing. The HPC parallel implementation\novercomes the limits due to the great amount of data and the complexity of data\nprocessing. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the\nU-BRAIN parallel implementation as defect classifier in aerospace structures.\nThe resulting system is implemented on a Linux-based cluster with multi-core\narchitecture.\n", "  The AWAKE experiment will use a \\SI{400}{GeV/c} proton beam with a\nlongitudinal bunch length of $\\sigma_z = 12\\,\\rm{cm}$ to create and sustain\nGV/m plasma wakefields over 10 meters . A 12 cm long bunch can only drive\nstrong wakefields in a plasma with $n_{pe} = 7 \\times\n10^{14}\\,\\rm{electrons/cm}^3$ after the self-modulation instability (SMI)\ndeveloped and microbunches formed, spaced at the plasma wavelength. The fields\npresent during SMI focus and defocus the protons in the transverse plane\n\\cite{SMI}. We show that by inserting two imaging screens downstream the\nplasma, we can measure the maximum defocusing angle of the defocused protons\nfor plasma densities above $n_{pe} = 5 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\rm{electrons/cm}^{-3}$.\nMeasuring maximum defocusing angles around 1 mrad indirectly proves that SMI\ndeveloped successfully and that GV/m plasma wakefields were created. In this\npaper we present numerical studies on how and when the wakefields defocus\nprotons in plasma, the expected measurement results of the two screen\ndiagnostics and the physics we can deduce from it.\n", "  The linear-combination of fragment molecular orbitals with three-body\ncorrection (FMO3-LCMO) is examined for electron transfer (ET) coupling matrix\nelements and ET pathway analysis, with application to hole transfer between two\ntriptophanes bridged by cis- and trans-polyproline linker conformations. A\nprojection to the minimal-valence-plus-core FMO space was found to give\nsufficient accuracy with significant reduction of computational cost while\navoiding the problem of linear dependence of FMOs stemming from involvement of\nbond detached atoms.\n", "  Recent Monte Carlo simulations of the q-state Potts model with a disorder\ndisplaying slowly-decaying correlations reported a violation of hyperscaling\nrelation caused by large disorder fluctuations and the existence of a Griffiths\nphase, as in random systems governed by an infinite-disorder fixed point. New\nsimulations, directly made in the limit of an infinite disorder strength, are\npresented. The magnetic scaling dimension is shown to correspond to the\ncorrelated percola-tion fixed point. The latter is shown to be unstable at\nfinite disorder strength but with a large cross-over length which is not\naccessible to Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We prove the existence of exponentially accurate quasimodes using the square\nof the Dirac operator on the Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter spacetime and the\nAgmon estimates. We then deduce a logarithmic lower bound for the local energy\ndecay of the Dirac propagator.\n", "  White dwarfs with log g lower than 7.0 are called Extremely Low Mass white\ndwarfs (ELMs). They were first found as companions to pulsars, then to other\nwhite dwarfs and main sequence stars (The ELM Survey: 2010 to 2016), and can\nonly be formed in interacting binaries in the age of the Universe. In our SDSS\nDR12 white dwarf catalog (Kepler et al. 2016), we found a few thousand stars in\nthe effective temperature and surface gravity ranges attributed to ELMs. We\nhave called these objects sdAs, alluding to their narrow hydrogen line spectra\nshowing sub-main sequence log g. One possible explanation for the sdAs is that\nthey are ELMs. Increasing the ELMs sample would help constrain the number of\nclose binaries in the Galaxy. Interestingly, if they turn out to be A stars\nwith an overestimated log g, the distance modulus would put these young stars\nin the Galaxy's halo.\n", "  This work studies in detail the possibility of defining a one-to-one mapping\nfrom charge densities as obtained by the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nto external potentials. Such a mapping is provided by the Runge-Gross theorem\nand lies at the very core of time-dependent density functional theory. After\nintroducing the necessary mathematical concepts, the usual mapping \"there\" -\nfrom potentials to wave functions as solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger equation -\nis revisited paying special attention to Sobolev regularity. This is\nscrutinised further when the question of functional differentiability of the\nsolution with respect to the potential arises, a concept related to linear\nresponse theory. Finally, after a brief introduction to general density\nfunctional theory, the mapping \"back again\" - from densities to potentials\nthereby inverting the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a fixed initial state - is\ndefined. Apart from utilising the original Runge-Gross proof this is achieved\nthrough a fixed-point procedure. Both approaches give rise to mathematical\nissues, previously unresolved, which however could be dealt with to some extent\nwithin the framework at hand.\n", "  Generation of relativistic electron (RE) beams during ultraintense laser\npulse interaction with plasma targets is studied by collisional\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Strong magnetic field with transverse scale\nlength of several local plasma skin depths, associated with RE currents\npropagation in the target, is generated by filamentation instability (FI) in\ncollisional plasmas, inducing a great enhancement of the divergence of REs\ncompared to that of collisionless cases. Such effect is increased with laser\nintensity and target charge state, suggesting that the RE divergence might be\nimproved by using low-Z materials under appropriate laser intensities in future\nfast ignition experiments and in other applications of laser-driven electron\nbeams.\n", "  Water can exist in a metastable liquid state under tension for long times\nbefore the system relaxes into the vapor via cavitation, i.e., bubble\nnucleation. Microscopic information on the cavitation process can be extracted\nfrom experimental data by use of the nucleation theorem, which relates measured\ncavitation rates to the size of the critical bubble. To apply the nucleation\ntheorem to experiments performed along an isochoric path, for instance, in\ncavitation experiments in mineral inclusions, knowledge of the bubble entropy\nis required. Using computer simulations, we compute the entropy of bubbles in\nwater as a function of their volume over a wide range of tensions from free\nenergy calculations. We find that the bubble entropy is an important\ncontribution to the free energy which significantly lowers the barrier to\nbubble nucleation, thereby facilitating cavitation. Furthermore, the bubble\nentropy per surface area depends on the curvature of the liquid--vapor\ninterface, decreasing approximately linearly with its mean curvature over the\nstudied range of bubble volumes. At room temperature, the entropy of a flat\nliquid--vapor interface at ambient pressure is very similar to that of critical\nbubbles over a wide range of tensions, which justifies the use of the former as\nan approximation when interpreting data from experiments. Based on our\nsimulation results, we obtain an estimate for the volume of the critical bubble\nfrom experimentally measured cavitation rates.\n", "  Relativistic wakes produced by intense laser or particle beams propagating\nthrough plasmas are being considered as accelerators for next generation of\ncolliders and coherent light sources. Such wakes have been shown to accelerate\nelectrons and positrons to several gigaelectronvolts (GeV), with a few percent\nenergy spread and a high wake-to-beam energy transfer efficiency. However,\ncomplete mapping of electric field structure of the wakes has proven elusive.\nHere we show that a high-energy electron bunch can be used to probe the fields\nof such light-speed wakes with femtosecond resolution. The highly transient,\nmicroscopic wakefield is reconstructed from the density modulated ultra-short\nprobe bunch after it has traversed the wake. This technique enables\nvisualization of linear wakefields in low-density plasmas that can accelerate\nelectrons and positrons beams. It also allows characterization of wakes in\nplasma density ramps critical for maintaining the beam emittance, improving the\nenergy transfer efficiency and producing high brightness beams from plasma\naccelerators.\n", "  The peculiar emission-line star MWC 137 with its extended optical nebula was\nrecently classified as B[e] supergiant. To study the spatial distribution of\nits circumstellar molecular gas on small and large scales, we obtained\nnear-infrared and radio observations using SINFONI and APEX, respectively. We\nfind that the hot CO gas is arranged in moving clumpy ring and shell structures\nclose to the star, while a cold CO envelope is encircling the borders of the\noptical nebula from the south to the west.\n", "  A new method capable of capturing coherent electric field structures\npropagating at nearly the speed of light in plasma with a time resolution as\nsmall as a few femtoseconds is proposed. This method uses a few femtoseconds\nlong relativistic electron bunch to probe the wake produced in a plasma by an\nintense laser pulse or an ultra-short relativistic charged particle beam. As\nthe probe bunch traverses the wake, its momentum is modulated by the electric\nfield of the wake, leading to a density variation of the probe after free-space\npropagation. This variation of probe density produces a snapshot of the wake\nthat can directly give many useful information of the wake structure and its\nevolution. Furthermore, this snapshot allows detailed mapping of the\nlongitudinal and transverse components of the wakefield. We develop a\ntheoretical model for field reconstruction and verify it using 3-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. This model can accurately reconstruct the\nwakefield structure in the linear regime, and it can also qualitatively map the\nmajor features of nonlinear wakes. The capturing of the injection in a\nnonlinear wake is demonstrated through 3D PIC simulations as an example of the\napplications of this new method.\n", "  In this study, the problem of overcoming the infinite energy barrier\nseparating the bradyonic and tachyonic realms is investigated. Making use of\nthe Majorana equation for particles with arbitrary spin and the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, it is proved that, under certain conditions of spatial\nconfinement, quantum fluctuations allow particles with very small mass and\nvelocity close to the speed of light to pass in the tachyonic realm, avoiding\nthe problem of the infinite barrier. This theoretical approach allows an\navoidance of the difficulties encountered in quantum field theory when it is\nextended to particles with imaginary rest mass.\n", "  In this paper we prove, by expressing the energy as a function of the wave\npropagation speed, it is highlighted the existence of an equivalent mass of the\nwave, as well as of an Einstein type relations between the energy and this\nmass. Also, we establish a relation between angular frequency and energy\nsimilar to that of the Planck relation. For the propagating wave, there is a de\nBroglie type relationship between the linear momentum and the action variable\n(the angular momentum), i.e. the wave linear momentum is proportional to the\nwave number, the proportionality coefficient being the action.\n", "  In the past five years, most of the paradigmatic concepts employed in\nspintronics have been replicated substituting ferromagnets by antiferromagnets\nin critical parts of the devices. The numerous research efforts directed to\nmanipulate and probe the magnetic moments in antiferromagnets have been\ngradually established a new and independent field known as antiferromagnetic\nspintronics. In this paper, we focus on the electrical control and detection of\nantiferromagnetic moments at a constant temperature. We address separately the\nexperimental results concerning insulating and metallic thin films as they\ncorrespond to voltage and electrical current controlled devices, respectively.\nFirst, we present results on the voltage control of antiferromagnetic order in\ninsulating thin films. The experiments show that voltage pulses can switch the\nchirality of a modulated antiferromagnetic structure. Second, we describe the\nrecent advances in metallic antiferromagnetic systems. We present results\nobtained with the first USB-operated portable device able to perform the\nnon-volatile electrical current-induced switching of an antiferromagnet\ncombined with magnetoresistive readout at room temperature. We discuss on\npotential applications that can be realized using antiferromagnetic memory\ncells.\n", "  Extracted BRITE lightcurves must be carefully prepared and corrected for\ninstrumental effects before a scientific analysis can be performed. Therefore,\nwe have created a suite of Python routines to prepare and correct the\nlightcurves, which is publicly available. In this paper we describe the method\nand successive steps performed by these routines.\n", "  We studied the variability of the magnetic O-type supergiant $\\zeta$ Ori Aa\nusing multi-colour BRITE photometry. We confirmed the known rotation frequency\n$f_{\\rm rot} = 0.15 \\pm 0.02$ c/d, and detected some of its higher harmonics,\nof which $4f_{\\rm rot}$ is compatible with the known DAC recurrence timescale.\nThanks to simultaneous high-resolution CHIRON spectroscopy, we could identify\nanother frequency $f_{\\rm env} = 0.10 \\pm 0.02$ c/d, caused by the\ncircumstellar environment. Variations in the circumstellar environment are\nbelieved to cause the observed difference between the BRITE lightcurves.\n", "  Some basic theorems on Killing vector fields are reviewed. In particular, the\ntopic of a constant-curvature space is examined. A detailed proof is given for\na theorem describing the most general form of the metric of a homogeneous\nisotropic space-time. Although this theorem can be considered to be commonly\nknown, its complete proof is difficult to find in the literature. An example\nmetric is presented such that all its spatial cross sections correspond to\nconstant-curvature spaces, but it is not homogeneous and isotropic as a whole.\nAn equivalent definition of a homogeneous and isotropic space-time in terms of\nembedded manifolds is also given.\n", "  No systematic studies have been carried out on the giant magnetoresistance\n(GMR) of electrodeposited (ED) Fe-Co/Cu multilayers since the elaboration of a\nmethod for the optimization of the Cu layer deposition potential. In this\npaper, we present results on the electrochemical optimization of the Cu layer\ndeposition potential which was found to depend on the relative iron\nconcentration in the bath. An X-ray diffraction study of ED Fe5Co95(1.5\nnm)/Cu(dCu) multilayers with dCu ranging from 0.8 nm to 10 nm revealed an fcc\nstructure. For most of the multilayers, a weak superlattice satellite\nreflection could be identified. The room-temperature magnetoresistance was\nstudied in detail as a function of the individual layer thicknesses.\nMultilayers with Cu layer thicknesses above about 1.5 nm were found to exhibit\na GMR behavior with a maximum GMR of about 5 % and a typical saturation field\nof 1 kOe. The GMR magnitude decreased with increasing Fe-content in the\nmagnetic layer. The spacer layer thickness evolution of the MR data was\nestablished in detail after separating the ferromagnetic and superparamagnetic\nGMR contributions and no oscillatory GMR was found. A comparison with\nliterature data on both physically deposited and ED Fe-Co/Cu multilayers is\nalso made.\n", "  Identifying and characterizing systems with coupled and competing\ninteractions is central to the development of physical models that can\naccurately describe and predict emergent behavior in condensed matter systems.\nThis work demonstrates that the metallic compound CuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ has competing\nmagnetic ground states, which are shown to be strongly coupled to the lattice\nand easily manipulated using temperature and applied magnetic fields.\nTemperature-dependent magnetization $M$ measurements reveal a\nferromagnetic-like onset at 228(1)\\,K and a broad maximum in $M$ near 180\\,K.\nPowder neutron diffraction confirms antiferromagnetic ordering below\n$T_{\\textrm{N}}\\approx$175\\,K, and an incommensurate spin density wave is\nobserved below $\\approx$125\\,K. Coupled with the small refined moments\n(0.5-1\\,$\\mu_B$/Fe), this provides a picture of itinerant magnetism in\nCuFe$_2$Ge$_2$. The neutron diffraction data also reveal a coexistence of two\nmagnetic phases that further highlights the near-degeneracy of various magnetic\nstates. These results demonstrate that the ground state in CuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ can\nbe easily manipulated by external forces, making it of particular interest for\ndoping, pressure, and further theoretical studies.\n", "  High mobility phonon-glass semimetal $CuAgSe$ has shown promise in recent\nyears as a potential low-temperature thermoelectric material. It exhibits\nreasonably strong thermoelectric performance as well as an extremely high\ncarrier mobility, both of which are enhanced when the material is doped with Ni\nat the Cu sites. The exact mechanism by which these enhancements result;\nhowever, is unclear. In order to further investigate the effects of chemical\nsubstitution on the material's thermoelectric properties, we have prepared and\nperformed various measurements on $CuAgSe$ samples doped with Co and Cr\naccording to the following compositional formulas: $Cu_{1-x}Co_{x}AgSe$\n$(x=0.02, 0.05, 0.10)$ and $Cu_{1-x}Cr_{x}AgSe$ $(x=0.02, 0.05)$. Measurements\nof temperature and magnetic field dependent thermal conductivity, electrical\nresistivity, and Seebeck coefficient will be discussed. Our results reveal a\nremarkable sensitivity of $CuAgSe$'s thermoelectric properties to chemical\ndoping in general as well as a particular sensitivity to specific dopants. This\ndemonstrated tunability of $CuAgSe$'s various properties furthers the case that\nhigh mobility phonon glass-semimetals are strong candidates for potential low\ntemperature thermoelectric applications.\n", "  In this article, we argue that the theory of special relativity, as\nformulated by Einstein, is a philosophical rather than a scientific theory.\nWhat is scientific and experimentally supported is the formalism of the\nrelativistic mechanics embedded in the Lorentz transformations and their direct\nmathematical, experimental and observational consequences. This is in parallel\nwith the quantum mechanics where the scientific content and experimental\nsupport of this branch of physics is embedded in the formalism of quantum\nmechanics and not in its philosophical interpretations such as the Copenhagen\nschool or the parallel worlds explanations. Einstein theory of special\nrelativity gets unduly credit from the success of the relativistic mechanics of\nLorentz transformations. Hence, all the postulates and consequences of Einstein\ninterpretation which have no direct experimental or observational support\nshould be reexamined and the relativistic mechanics of Lorentz transformations\nshould be treated in education, academia and research in a similar fashion to\nthat of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Vacuum instability of the strong electromagnetic field has been discussed\nsince long time ago. The instability of the strong electric field due to\ncreation of electron pairs is one of the examples, which is known as Schwinger\nprocess. What matters are the coupling of particles to the electromagnetic\nfield and the mass of the particle to be produced. The critical electric field\nfor electrons in the minimal coupling is ~ m^2/e . Spin 1/2 neutral particles\nbut with magnetic dipole moments can interact with the electromagnetic field\nthrough Pauli coupling. The instability of the particular vacuum under the\nstrong magnetic field can be formulated as the emergence of imaginary parts of\nthe effective potential. In this talk, the development of the imaginary part in\nthe effective potential as a function of the magnetic field strength is\ndiscussed for the configurations of the uniform magnetic field and the\ninhomogeneous magnetic field. Neutrinos are the lightest particle(if not photon\nor gluon) in the \"standard model\", of which electromagnetic property is poorly\nknown experimentally. Recently the observation of neutrino oscillation shows\nthe necessity of neutrino masses. It implies that the standard model is\nsubjected to be modified such that non-trivial electromagnetic structure of\nneutrino should be reconsidered although they are assigned to be neutral. And\nthe possibility of anomalous electromagnetic form factor is an open question\ntheoretically and experimentally. In this talk, the implication of\nnon-vanishing magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos is also discussed: the\ninstability of the strong magnetic field and the enhancement of neutrino\nproduction in high energy collider experiments.\n", "  We report radio imaging and monitoring observations in the frequency range\n0.235 - 2.7 GHz during the flaring mode of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest\nBL Lac objects. The high sensitivity GMRT observations not only reveal extended\nkpc-scale jet and FRI type lobe morphology in this erstwhile `extended-core'\nblazar but also delineate the morphological details, thanks to its arcsec scale\nresolution. The radio light curve during the end phase of the outburst measured\nin 2008 shows high variability (8.5%) in the jet emission in the GHz range,\ncompared to the lower core variability (3.2%) seen at the lowest frequencies.\nThe excess of flux density with a very steep spectral index in the MHz range\nsupports the presence of extra diffuse emission at low frequencies. The\nanalysis of multi wavelength (radio/ optical/ gamma-ray) light curves at\ndifferent radio frequencies confirms the variability of the core region and\nagrees with the scenario of high energy emission in gamma-rays due to inverse\nCompton emission from a collimated relativistic plasma jet followed by\nsynchrotron emission in radio. Clearly, these results give an interesting\ninsight of the jet emission mechanisms in blazars and highlight the importance\nof studying such objects with low frequency radio interferometers like LOFAR\nand the SKA and its precursor instruments.\n", "  We show that photons may be redshifted or blueshifted when interacting with\nthe field of an overcritical dipole, which incorporates the one-loop QED\ncorrections coming from vacuum polarization. Using the effective metric, it\nfollows that such effect depends on the polarization of the photon. The shifts,\nplotted against the azimuthal angle for various values of the magnetic field,\nmay show an intensity comparable to the gravitational redshift for a magnetar.\nTo obtain these results, we have corrected previous literature.\n", "  Optimum design of efficient nanowire solar cells requires better\nunderstanding of light diffusion in a nanowire array. Here we demonstrate that\nour recently developed ultrafast all-optical shutter can be used to directly\nmeasure the dwell time of light in a nanowire array. Our measurements on\ndisordered ZnO nanowire arrays, \"nanowire forests,\" indicate that the photon\nmean free path and the dwell time of light can be well predicted from SEM\nimages.\n", "  Grover's quantum search algorithm evolves a quantum system from a known\nsource state $|s\\rangle$ to an unknown target state $|t\\rangle$ using the\nselective phase inversions, $I_{s}$ and $I_{t}$, of these two states. In one of\nthe generalizations of Grover's algorithm, $I_{s}$ is replaced by a general\ndiffusion operator $D_{s}$ having $|s\\rangle$ as an eigenstate and $I_{t}$ is\nreplaced by a general selective phase rotation $I_{t}^{\\phi}$. A fast quantum\nsearch is possible as long as the operator $D_{s}$ and the angle $\\phi$\nsatisfies certain conditions. These conditions are very restrictive in nature.\nSpecifically, suppose $|\\ell\\rangle$ denote the eigenstates of $D_{s}$\ncorresponding to the eigenphases $\\theta_{\\ell}$. Then the sum of the terms\n$|\\langle \\ell|t\\rangle|^{2}\\cot(\\theta_{\\ell}/2)$ over all $\\ell \\neq s$ has\nto be almost equal to $\\cot(\\phi/2)$ for a fast quantum search. In this paper,\nwe show that this condition can be significantly relaxed by introducing\nappropriate modifications of the algorithm. This allows access to a more\ngeneral class of diffusion operators for fast quantum search.\n", "  The pion electromagnetic form factor is calculated at lower and higher\nmomentum transfer in order to explore constituent quark models and the\ndifferences among those models. In particular, the light-front constituent\nquark model is utilized here to calculate the pion electromagnetic form factor\nat lower and higher energies. The matrix elements of the electromagnetic\ncurrent, are calculated with both \"plus\" and \"minus\" components of the\nelectromagnetic current in the light-front. Further, the electromagnetic form\nfactor is compared with other models in the literature and experimental data.\n", "  The direct collapse black hole (DCBH) model attempts to explain the observed\nnumber density of supermassive black holes in the early Universe by positing\nthat they grew from seed black holes with masses of $10^{4}$-$10^{5} \\: {\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$ that formed by the quasi-isothermal collapse of gas in metal-free\nprotogalaxies cooled by atomic hydrogen emission. For this model to work,\nH$_{2}$ formation must be suppressed in at least some of these systems by a\nstrong extragalactic radiation field. The predicted number density of DCBH\nseeds is highly sensitive to the minimum value of the ultraviolet (UV) flux\nrequired to suppress H$_{2}$ formation, $J_{\\rm crit}$. In this paper, we\nexamine how the value of $J_{\\rm crit}$ varies as we vary the strength of a\nhypothetical high-redshift X-ray background. We confirm earlier findings that\nwhen the X-ray flux $J_{\\rm X}$ is large, the critical UV flux scales as\n$J_{\\rm crit} \\propto J_{\\rm X}^{1/2}$. We also carefully explore possible\nsources of uncertainty arising from how the X-rays are modelled. We use a\nreaction-based reduction technique to analyze the chemistry of H$_{2}$ in the\nX-ray illuminated gas and identify a critical subset of 35 chemical reactions\nthat must be included in our chemical model in order to predict $J_{\\rm crit}$\naccurately. We further show that $J_{\\rm crit}$ is insensitive to the details\nof how secondary ionization or He$^{+}$ recombination are modelled, but does\ndepend strongly on the assumptions made regarding the column density of the\ncollapsing gas.\n", "  We present a recent calculation of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in\nunpolarized $pp$ collision and show that this can be used to probe the\nunpolarized gluon as well as the linearly polarized gluon transverse momentum\ndependent parton distributions (TMDs). We use the color evaporation model for\nthe heavy quarkonium production and use a generalized factorized form of the\ncross section. We compare the results with experimental data.\n", "  In the present work, we discuss the effects of the inclusion of\nsterile-active neutrino oscillations during the production of primordial\nlight-nuclei. We assume that the sterile neutrino mass-eigenstate might\noscillate with the two lightest active neutrino mass- eigenstates, with mixing\nangles ${\\phi}_1$ and ${\\phi}_2$. We also allow a constant renormalization\n(represented by a parameter (${\\zeta}$)) of the sterile neutrino occupation\nfactor. Taking ${\\zeta}$ and the mixing angles as free parameters, we have\ncomputed distribution functions of active and sterile neutrinos and primordial\nabundances. Using observable data we set constrains in the free parameters of\nthe model. It is found that the data on primordial abundances are consistent\nwith small mixing angles and with a value of ${\\zeta}$ smaller than 0.65 at\n3${\\sigma}$ level.\n", "  We study spin relaxation in n-type bulk GaAs, due to the Dyakonov--Perel\nmechanism, using ensemble Monte Carlo methods. Our results confirm that spin\nrelaxation time increases with the electronic density in the regime of moderate\nelectronic concentrations and high temperature. We show that the\nelectron-electron scattering in the non-degenerate regime significantly slows\ndown spin relaxation. This result supports predictions by Glazov and Ivchenko.\nMost importantly, our findings highlight the importance of many-body\ninteractions for spin dynamics: we show that only by properly taking into\naccount electron-electron interactions within the simulations, results for the\nspin relaxation time---with respect to both electron density and\ntemperature---will reach good {\\it quantitative} agreement with corresponding\nexperimental data. Our calculations contain no fitting parameters.\n", "  We report here the results of a one week long investigation into the\nconceptual design of an X-ray source based on a compact ring with on-orbit and\non-energy laser-plasma accelerator. We performed these studies during the June\n2016 USPAS class \"Physics of Accelerators, Lasers, and Plasma...\" applying the\nart of inventiveness TRIZ. We describe three versions of the light source with\nthe constraints of the electron beam with energy $1\\,\\rm{GeV}$ or $3\\,\\rm{GeV}$\nand a magnetic lattice design being normal conducting (only for the\n$1\\,\\rm{GeV}$ beam) or superconducting (for either beam). The electron beam\nrecirculates in the ring, to increase the effective photon flux. We describe\nthe design choices, present relevant parameters, and describe insights into\nsuch machines.\n", "  Variable stars of RR Lyrae type are a prime tool to obtain distances to old\nstellar populations in the Milky Way, and one of the main aims of the Vista\nVariables in the Via Lactea (VVV) near-infrared survey is to use them to map\nthe structure of the Galactic Bulge. Due to the large number of expected\nsources, this requires an automated mechanism for selecting RR Lyrae,and\nparticularly those of the more easily recognized type ab (i.e.,\nfundamental-mode pulsators), from the 10^6-10^7 variables expected in the VVV\nsurvey area. In this work we describe a supervised machine-learned classifier\nconstructed for assigning a score to a K_s-band VVV light curve that indicates\nits likelihood of being ab-type RR Lyrae. We describe the key steps in the\nconstruction of the classifier, which were the choice of features, training\nset, selection of aperture and family of classifiers. We find that the AdaBoost\nfamily of classifiers give consistently the best performance for our problem,\nand obtain a classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm that achieves a\nharmonic mean between false positives and false negatives of ~7% for typical\nVVV light curve sets. This performance is estimated using cross-validation and\nthrough the comparison to two independent datasets that were classified by\nhuman experts.\n", "  Nowadays the city-wide traffic contains hundreds of thousands of vehicles\nwith different scenarios of their behavior. If a microscopic approach is used\nit leads to solving tremendous systems of ordinary differential equations whose\ncomponents have a wide range of variation rates. The given paper has introduced\na multirate numerical scheme with a self-adjusting time stepping strategy.\nInstead of using a single step size for the whole system we have determined the\nstep size for each component by estimating its own local variation. We also\nperformed the stability analysis for the developed scheme. The presented\nmultirate scheme provides a significant speed-up in processor times compared to\nthe corresponding single-rate one. The use of multiple time steps admits\nparallel computing.\n", "  Pure SrTiO3 in bulk form is known to be an incipient ferroelectric where the\nquantum fluctuations of lattice positions prevent long range ferroelectric\nordering at a finite temperature. We show evidence and identify the origin of\nferroelectric relaxation up to nearly room temperature in single crystalline\nSrTiO3. Strikingly, the origin of the observed ferroelectric switching is\nintrinsic which is the coherent switching of surface nanopolar regions and not\ndue to the nucleation and growth of domains, as described by the\nKolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi Model.\n", "  In this paper we work out collapsing conditions for a spherical star in the\nweak field limit of the $R+\\mu^4/R$ gravity and discuss the importance of the\nparameter $\\mu$ to generate different criteria in the theory. Such criteria are\nproved to be resulting in a variety of different fates for the evolution of the\nouter shells of stars. Furthermore, we investigate the special case of\nviolating the first junction condition and point out corresponding\ncontradictions to the normal cases. These results show that the consistency of\nthe $R+\\mu^4/R$ theory of gravity with the common astrophysical predictions\nrelies highly on the adoption of the parameter $\\mu$ and satisfaction/violation\nof the first junction condition. For those anomalous results, further\nobservational attempts are mandatory.\n", "  We discuss the emergence of low dimensional ferroelectricity in\nself-organized Pr0.67Ca0.33MnO3 nanocrystalline arrays deposited on Si\nsubstrate. We observe sharp switching of electric polarization under external\nelectric eld with nearly rectangular hysteresis loops which persist up to 150\nK. We discuss the polarization switching kinetics within the framework of\nKolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi Model which gives maximum domain wall speed of ~1\nm/s. Polarized Raman spectroscopy shows evidence of isolated ferroelectric\ndomains even at room temperature.\n", "  The design of exudate-managing wound dressings is an established route to\naccelerated healing, although such design remains a challenge from material and\nmanufacturing standpoints. Aiming towards the clinical translation of knowledge\ngained in vitro with highly swollen rat tail collagen hydrogels, this study\ninvestigated the healing capability in a diabetic mouse wound model of\ntelopeptide-free, protease-inhibiting collagen networks. 4 vinylbenzylation and\nUV irradiation of type I atelocollagen (AC) led to hydrogel networks with\nchemical and macroscopic properties comparable to previous collagen analogues,\nattributable to similar lysine content and dichroic properties. After 4 days in\nvitro, hydrogels induced nearly 50 RFU% reduction in matrix metalloproteinase\n(MMP)-9 activity, whilst showing less than 20 wt.-% weight loss. After 20 days\nin vivo, dry networks promoted 99% closure of 10x10 mm full thickness wounds\nand accelerated neodermal tissue formation compared to Mepilex. This collagen\nsystem can be equipped with multiple, customisable properties and functions key\nto personalised chronic wound care.\n", "  We have studied spin transport and magnetoresistance in yttrium iron garnet\n(YIG)/NiO/Pt trilayers with varied NiO thickness. To characterize the spin\ntransport through NiO we excite ferromagnetic resonance in YIG with a microwave\nfrequency magnetic field and detect the voltage associated with the inverse\nspin-Hall effect (ISHE) in the Pt layer. The ISHE signal is found to decay\nexponentially with the NiO thickness with a characteristic decay length of 3.9\nnm. This is contrasted with the magnetoresistance in these same structures. The\nsymmetry of the magnetoresistive response is consistent with spin-Hall\nmagnetoresistance (SMR). However, in contrast to the ISHE response, as the NiO\nthickness increases the SMR signal goes towards zero abruptly at a NiO\nthickness of $\\simeq$ 4 nm, highlighting the different length scales associated\nwith the spin-transport in NiO and SMR in such trilayers.\n", "  The galactic population of globular clusters are old, dense star systems,\nwith a typical cluster containing $10^4 - 10^6$ stars. As an old population of\nstars, globular clusters contain many collapsed and degenerate objects. As a\ndense population of stars, globular clusters are the scene of many interesting\nclose dynamical interactions between stars. These dynamical interactions can\nalter the evolution of individual stars and can produce tight binary systems\ncontaining one or two compact objects. In this review, we discuss the\ntheoretical models of globular cluster evolution and binary evolution,\ntechniques for simulating this evolution which lead to relativistic binaries,\nand current and possible future observational evidence for this population.\nGlobular cluster evolution will focus on the properties that boost the\nproduction of hard binary systems and on the tidal interactions of the galaxy\nwith the cluster, which tend to alter the structure of the globular cluster\nwith time. The interaction of the components of hard binary systems alters the\nevolution of both bodies and can lead to exotic objects. Direct $N$-body\nintegrations and Fokker-Planck simulations of the evolution of globular\nclusters that incorporate tidal interactions and lead to predictions of\nrelativistic binary populations are also discussed. We discuss the current\nobservational evidence for cataclysmic variables, millisecond pulsars, and\nlow-mass X-ray binaries as well as possible future detection of relativistic\nbinaries with gravitational radiation.\n", "  We review the main properties, demographics and applications of binary and\nmillisecond radio pulsars. Our knowledge of these exciting objects has greatly\nincreased in recent years, mainly due to successful surveys which have brought\nthe known pulsar population to over 1700. There are now 80 binary and\nmillisecond pulsars associated with the disk of our Galaxy, and a further 103\npulsars in 24 of the Galactic globular clusters. Recent highlights have been\nthe discovery of the first ever double pulsar system and a recent flurry of\ndiscoveries in globular clusters, in particular Terzan 5.\n", "  This review is concerned with a discussion of numerical methods for the\nsolution of the equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD).\nParticular emphasis is put on a comprehensive review of the application of\nhigh-resolution shock-capturing methods in SRHD. Results obtained with\ndifferent numerical SRHD methods are compared, and two astrophysical\napplications of SRHD flows are discussed. An evaluation of the various\nnumerical methods is given and future developments are analyzed.\n", "  This article is a guide to the literature on existence theorems for the\nEinstein equations which also draws attention to open problems in the field.\nThe local in time Cauchy problem, which is relatively well understood, is\ntreated first. Next global results for solutions with symmetry are discussed. A\nselection of results from Newtonian theory and special relativity which offer\nuseful comparisons is presented. This is followed by a survey of global results\nin the case of small data and results on constructing spacetimes with given\nsingularity structure. The article ends with some miscellaneous topics\nconnected with the main theme.\n", "  The current status of numerical solutions for the equations of ideal general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics is reviewed. With respect to an earlier version of\nthe article the present update provides additional information on numerical\nschemes and extends the discussion of astrophysical simulations in general\nrelativistic hydrodynamics. Different formulations of the equations are\npresented, with special mention of conservative and hyperbolic formulations\nwell-adapted to advanced numerical methods. A large sample of available\nnumerical schemes is discussed, paying particular attention to solution\nprocedures based on schemes exploiting the characteristic structure of the\nequations through linearized Riemann solvers. A comprehensive summary of\nastrophysical simulations in strong gravitational fields is presented. These\ninclude gravitational collapse, accretion onto black holes and hydrodynamical\nevolutions of neutron stars. The material contained in these sections\nhighlights the numerical challenges of various representative simulations. It\nalso follows, to some extent, the chronological development of the field,\nconcerning advances on the formulation of the gravitational field and\nhydrodynamic equations and the numerical methodology designed to solve them.\n", "  I review the development of numerical evolution codes for general relativity\nbased upon the characteristic initial value problem. Progress is traced from\nthe early stage of 1D feasibility studies to current 3D black codes that\nsimulate binary black holes. A prime application of characteristic evolution is\nCauchy-characteristic matching, which is also reviewed.\n", "  The status of experimental tests of general relativity and of theoretical\nframeworks for analysing them are reviewed. Einstein's equivalence principle\n(EEP) is well supported by experiments such as the E\\\"otv\\\"os experiment, tests\nof special relativity, and the gravitational redshift experiment. Future tests\nof EEP and of the inverse square law will search for new interactions arising\nfrom unification or quantum gravity. Tests of general relativity at the\npost-Newtonian level have reached high precision, including the light\ndeflection, the Shapiro time delay, the perihelion advance of Mercury, and the\nNordtvedt effect in lunar motion. Gravitational wave damping has been detected\nto half a percent using the binary pulsar, and new binary pulsar systems may\nyield further improvements. When direct observation of gravitational radiation\nfrom astrophysical sources begins, new tests of general relativity will be\npossible.\n", "  The main purpose of this article is to guide the reader to theorems on global\nproperties of solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system. This system couples\nEinstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an\nimportant field of research during several decades where the main focus has\nbeen on nonrelativistic- and special relativistic physics, e.g. to model the\ndynamics of neutral gases, plasmas and Newtonian self-gravitating systems. In\n1990 Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov\nsystem. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this\nsystem have been established. The Vlasov equation describes matter\nphenomenologically and it should be stressed that most of the theorems\npresented in this article are not presently known for other such matter models\n(e.g. fluid models). The first part of this paper gives an introduction to\nkinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is\nintroduced. We believe that a good understanding of kinetic theory in\nnon-curved spacetimes is fundamental in order to get a good comprehension of\nkinetic theory in general relativity.\n", "  This review is concerned with the motion of a point scalar charge, a point\nelectric charge, and a point mass in a specified background spacetime. In each\nof the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing\nradiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In\nthe near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force\nthat prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background\nspacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's\ninertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully\nresponsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave\nequation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with\nthe particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The\nmathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar\ncharge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background\nspacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion\nof the basic theory of bitensors (part I). It then applies the theory to the\nconstruction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the\nparticle's word line (part II). It continues with a thorough discussion of\nGreen's functions in curved spacetime (part III). The review concludes with a\ndetailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion (part IV).\n", "  Whereas semiclassical gravity is based on the semiclassical Einstein equation\nwith sources given by the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor of\nquantum fields, stochastic semiclassical gravity is based on the\nEinstein-Langevin equation, which has in addition sources due to the noise\nkernel.In the first part, we describe the fundamentals of this new theory via\ntwo approaches: the axiomatic and the functional. In the second part, we\ndescribe three applications of stochastic gravity theory. First, we consider\nmetric perturbations in a Minkowski spacetime: we compute the two-point\ncorrelation functions for the linearized Einstein tensor and for the metric\nperturbations. Second, we discuss structure formation from the stochastic\ngravity viewpoint. Third, we discuss the backreaction of Hawking radiation in\nthe gravitational background of a quasi-static black hole.\n", "  The observable universe could be a 1+3-surface (the \"brane\") embedded in a\n1+3+d-dimensional spacetime (the \"bulk\"), with standard-model particles and\nfields trapped on the brane while gravity is free to access the bulk. At least\none of the d extra spatial dimensions could be very large relative to the\nPlanck scale, which lowers the fundamental gravity scale, possibly even down to\nthe electroweak (~ TeV) level. This revolutionary picture arises in the\nframework of recent developments in M theory. The 1+10-dimensional M theory\nencompasses the known 1+9-dimensional superstring theories, and is widely\nconsidered to be a promising potential route to quantum gravity. General\nrelativity cannot describe gravity at high enough energies and must be replaced\nby a quantum gravity theory, picking up significant corrections as the\nfundamental energy scale is approached. At low energies, gravity is localized\nat the brane and general relativity is recovered, but at high energies gravity\n\"leaks\" into the bulk, behaving in a truly 1+3+d-dimensional way. This\nintroduces significant changes to gravitational dynamics and perturbations,\nwith interesting testable implications for high-energy astrophysics, black\nholes and cosmology. Brane-world models offer a phenomenological way to test\nsome of the novel predictions and corrections to general relativity that are\nimplied by M theory. This review discusses the geometry, dynamics and\nperturbations of simple brane-world models for cosmology and astrophysics,\nmainly focusing on warped 5-dimensional brane-worlds based on the\nRandall-Sundrum models.\n", "  Equal-arm interferometric detectors of gravitational radiation allow phase\nmeasurements many orders of magnitude below the intrinsic phase stability of\nthe laser injecting light into their arms. This is because the noise in the\nlaser light is common to both arms, experiencing exactly the same delay, and\nthus cancels when it is differenced at the photo detector. In this situation,\nmuch lower level secondary noises then set overall performance. If, however,\nthe two arms have different lengths (as will necessarily be the case with\nspace-borne interferometers), the laser noise experiences different delays in\nthe two arms and will hence not directly cancel at the detector. In order to\nsolve this problem, a technique involving heterodyne interferometry with\nunequal arm lengths and independent phase-difference readouts has been\nproposed. It relies on properly time-shifting and linearly combining\nindependent Doppler measurements, and for this reason it has been called\nTime-Delay Interferometry (or TDI). This article provides an overview of the\ntheory and mathematical foundations of TDI as it will be implemented by the\nforthcoming space-based interferometers such as the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) mission. We have purposely left out from this first version of\nour ``Living Review'' article on TDI all the results of more practical and\nexperimental nature, as well as all the aspects of TDI that the data analysts\nwill need to account for when analyzing the LISA TDI data combinations. Our\nforthcoming ``second edition'' of this review paper will include these topics.\n", "  The main purpose of this article is to provide a guide to theorems on global\nproperties of solutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system. This system couples\nEinstein's equations to a kinetic matter model. Kinetic theory has been an\nimportant field of research during several decades in which the main focus has\nbeen on nonrelativistic and special relativistic physics, {\\it i.e.} to model\nthe dynamics of neutral gases, plasmas, and Newtonian self-gravitating systems.\nIn 1990, Rendall and Rein initiated a mathematical study of the Einstein-Vlasov\nsystem. Since then many theorems on global properties of solutions to this\nsystem have been established. The Vlasov equation describes matter\nphenomenologically and it should be stressed that most of the theorems\npresented in this article are not presently known for other such matter models\n({\\it i.e.} fluid models). This paper gives introductions to kinetic theory in\nnon-curved spacetimes and then the Einstein-Vlasov system is introduced. We\nbelieve that a good understanding of kinetic theory in non-curved spacetimes is\nfundamental to good comprehension of kinetic theory in general relativity.\n", "  Analogue gravity is a research programme which investigates analogues of\ngeneral relativistic gravitational fields within other physical systems,\ntypically but not exclusively condensed matter systems, with the aim of gaining\nnew insights into their corresponding problems. Analogue models of (and for)\ngravity have a long and distinguished history dating back to the earliest years\nof general relativity. In this review article we will discuss the history,\naims, results, and future prospects for the various analogue models. We start\nthe discussion by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue\nmodel, before exploring the rich history and complex tapestry of models\ndiscussed in the literature. The last decade in particular has seen a\nremarkable and sustained development of analogue gravity ideas, leading to some\nhundreds of published articles, a workshop, two books, and this review article.\nFuture prospects for the analogue gravity programme also look promising, both\non the experimental front (where technology is rapidly advancing) and on the\ntheoretical front (where variants of analogue models can be used as a\nspringboard for radical attacks on the problem of quantum gravity).\n", "  Quantum gravity is expected to be necessary in order to understand situations\nwhere classical general relativity breaks down. In particular in cosmology one\nhas to deal with initial singularities, i.e. the fact that the backward\nevolution of a classical space-time inevitably comes to an end after a finite\namount of proper time. This presents a breakdown of the classical picture and\nrequires an extended theory for a meaningful description. Since small length\nscales and high curvatures are involved, quantum effects must play a role. Not\nonly the singularity itself but also the surrounding space-time is then\nmodified. One particular realization is loop quantum cosmology, an application\nof loop quantum gravity to homogeneous systems, which removes classical\nsingularities. Its implications can be studied at different levels. Main\neffects are introduced into effective classical equations which allow to avoid\ninterpretational problems of quantum theory. They give rise to new kinds of\nearly universe phenomenology with applications to inflation and cyclic models.\nTo resolve classical singularities and to understand the structure of geometry\naround them, the quantum description is necessary. Classical evolution is then\nreplaced by a difference equation for a wave function which allows to extend\nspace-time beyond classical singularities. One main question is how these\nhomogeneous scenarios are related to full loop quantum gravity, which can be\ndealt with at the level of distributional symmetric states. Finally, the new\nstructure of space-time arising in loop quantum gravity and its application to\ncosmology sheds new light on more general issues such as time.\n", "  The problem of finding the quantum theory of the gravitational field, and\nthus understanding what is quantum spacetime, is still open. One of the most\nactive of the current approaches is loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity\nis a mathematically well-defined, non-perturbative and background independent\nquantization of general relativity, with its conventional matter couplings. The\nresearch in loop quantum gravity forms today a vast area, ranging from\nmathematical foundations to physical applications. Among the most significative\nresults obtained are: (i) The computation of the physical spectra of\ngeometrical quantities such as area and volume; which yields quantitative\npredictions on Planck-scale physics. (ii) A derivation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy formula. (iii) An intriguing physical\npicture of the microstructure of quantum physical space, characterized by a\npolymer-like Planck scale discreteness. This discreteness emerges naturally\nfrom the quantum theory and provides a mathematically well-defined realization\nof Wheeler's intuition of a spacetime ``foam''. Long standing open problems\nwithin the approach (lack of a scalar product, overcompleteness of the loop\nbasis, implementation of reality conditions) have been fully solved. The weak\npart of the approach is the treatment of the dynamics: at present there exist\nseveral proposals, which are intensely debated. Here, I provide a general\noverview of ideas, techniques, results and open problems of this candidate\ntheory of quantum gravity, and a guide to the relevant literature.\n", "  Rotating relativistic stars are receiving significant attention in recent\nyears, because of the information they can yield about the equation of state of\nmatter at extremely high densities and because they are one of the more\npossible sources of detectable gravitational waves. We review the latest\ntheoretical and numerical methods for modeling rotating relativistic stars,\nincluding stars with a strong magnetic field and hot proto-neutron stars. We\nalso review nonaxisymmetric oscillations and instabilities in rotating stars\nand summarize the latest developments regarding the gravitational wave-driven\n(CFS) instability in both polar and axial quasi-normal modes.\n"]}
