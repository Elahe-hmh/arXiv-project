Also Hubble (1929) called the discovered\ndistance-redshift relation as \"De Sitter effect\". For homogeneous matter\ndistribution cosmological gravitational redshift is proportional to square of\ndistance: z_grav ~ r^2. However for a fractal matter distribution having the\nfractal dimension D=2 the global gravitational redshift is the linear function\nof distance: z_grav ~ r, which gives possibility for interpretation of the\nHubble law without the space expansion. Here the field gravity fractal\ncosmological model (FGF) is presented, which based on two initial principles.\nThe first assumption is that the Feynman's field gravity approach describes the\ngravitational interaction, which delivers a natural basis for the conceptual\nunity of all fundamental physical interactions within the framework of the\nrelativistic and quantum fields in Minkowski space. The second hypothesis is\nthat the spatial distribution of gravitating matter is a fractal at all scales\nup to the Hubble radius. The fractal dimension of matter distribution is\nassumed to be D = 2, which implies that the global gravitational redshift is\nthe explanation of the observed linear Hubble law. In the frame of the FGF all\nthree phenomena - the cosmic background radiation, the fractal large scale\nstructure, and the Hubble law, - could be the consequence of a unique large\nscale structure evolution process of the initially homogeneous ordinary matter\nwithout nonbaryonic matter and dark energy.\n", "  The $D\\to X_u l^+ l^-$ transitions -- branching ratios, forward-backward\nasymmetry $A^c_{FB}$, the CP asymmetry $A^c_{CP}$ and the CP asymmetry in the\nforward-backward asymmetry $A^{CP}_{FB}$ -- have two sources: for $D^{\\pm}$\nthey represent a pure $\\Delta C=1$ & $\\Delta Q=0$ current interaction whereas\nneutral $D$ mesons can also communicate via their anti-hadron. Standard Model\n(SM) contributions to BR$(D\\to X_u l^+ l^-)$ come primarily from long distance\ndynamics, which overshadow short distance contributions by several orders of\nmagnitude; still they fall much below the present upper experimental bounds.\nEven the SM contributions to $A^c_{FB}$, $A^c_{CP}$ and $A^{CP}_{FB}$ are tiny,\nquite unlike in beauty hadrons. The branching ratios are hardly dented by\ncontributions from the Littlest Higgs Models with T parity (LHT) even in the\nshort distance regime, let alone in the SM long distances dynamics. Yet the\nasymmetries $A^c_{FB}$, $A^c_{CP}$ and $A^{CP}_{FB}$ in these New Physics\nmodels can be enhanced over SM predictions, as they arise purely from short\ndistance dynamics; this can occur in particular for $A^c_{FB}$ and\n$A^{CP}_{FB}$ which get enhanced by orders of magnitudes. Even such\nenhancements hardly reach absolute sizes for observable experimental effects\nfor $A^c_{FB}$ and $A^c_{CP}$. However LHT contributions to $A^{CP}_{FB}$ could\nbe measured in experiments like the LHCb and the SuperB Collaboration. These\nresults lead us to draw further conclusions on FCNCs within LHT-like models\nthrough some simple scaling arguments that encapsulate the essence of flavour\ndynamics in and beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  We give a brief introduction to matrix models and the group field theory\n(GFT) formalism as realizations of the idea of a third quantization of gravity,\nand present in some more detail the idea and basic features of a continuum\nthird quantization formalism in terms of a field theory on the space of\nconnections, building up on the results of loop quantum gravity that allow to\nmake the idea slightly more concrete. We explore to what extent one can\nrigorously define such a field theory. Concrete examples are given for the\nsimple case of Riemannian GR in 3 spacetime dimensions. We discuss the relation\nbetween GFT and this formal continuum third quantized gravity, and what it can\nteach us about the continuum limit of GFTs.\n", "  Following on after three previous papers discussing the formation of\nprimordial black holes in the early universe during the radiation dominated\nera, we present here related results considering the theoretical possibility of\nhaving a fluid with a different sound speed. In practice we vary the parameter\nw of the equation of state p = we between 0 and 1, where e is the energy\ndensity, and p the pressure of the fluid. We consider also the possibility of\nhaving a cosmological constant interpreted as a vacuum energy component\n(corresponding to w = -1) revising the results presented in our first paper of\nthis series, having now a more refined numerical code available. To perform our\nsimulations we have fine tuned our previous computer code allowing us to\nobserve that the nature of the critical collapse is conserved for all the\ndifferent values of w considered, in agreement with previous studies of ideal\ncollapses done in a different context from PBHs. As already done in our\nprevious works, we start the simulations with initial supra-horizon scale\nperturbations of a type which could have come from inflation, characterized by\na pure growing mode component.\n", "  A new solution with constant torsion is derived using the field equations of\nf(T). Asymptotic forms of energy density, radial and transversal pressures are\nshown to meet the standard energy conditions, i.e., weak and null energy\nconditions according to some restrictions on T0, f(T0) and fT(T0). Other\nsolutions are obtained for vanishing radial pressure and for specific choices\nof f(T). The physics relevant to the resulting models is discussed.\n", "  No quantitative theory describing all physical phenomena can be made if any\narbitrary standard spacetime structure is assumed. This statement is a\nconsequence of transforming the Peano arithmetic axioms into sentences with a\nphysical content.\n", "  Motivated by the recent developments of pseudo-hermitian quantum mechanics,\nwe analyze the structure of unbounded metric operators in a Hilbert space. It\nturns out that such operators generate a canonical lattice of Hilbert spaces,\nthat is, the simplest case of a partial inner product space (PIP space). Next,\nwe introduce several generalizations of the notion of similarity between\noperators and explore to what extend they preserve spectral properties. Then we\napply some of the previous results to operators on a particular PIP space,\nnamely, a scale of Hilbert spaces generated by a metric operator. Finally, we\nreformulate the notion of pseudo-hermitian operators in the preceding\nformalism.\n", "  We explore factorizations of noncommutative Riemannian spin geometries over\ncommutative base manifolds in unbounded KK-theory. After setting up the general\nformalism of unbounded KK-theory and improving upon the construction of\ninternal products, we arrive at a natural bundle-theoretic formulation of gauge\ntheories arising from spectral triples. We find that the unitary group of a\ngiven noncommutative spectral triple arises as the group of endomorphisms of a\ncertain Hilbert bundle; the inner fluctuations split in terms of connections\non, and endomorphisms of, this Hilbert bundle. Moreover, we introduce an\nextended gauge group of unitary endomorphisms and a corresponding notion of\ngauge fields. We work out several examples in full detail, to wit Yang--Mills\ntheory, the noncommutative torus and the $\\theta$-deformed Hopf fibration over\nthe two-sphere.\n", "  Over the past years our understanding of the scaling properties of the\nsolutions to the one-dimensional KPZ equation has advanced considerably, both\ntheoretically and experimentally. In our contribution we export these insights\nto the case of coupled KPZ equations in one dimension. We establish equivalence\nwith nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics for multi-component driven stochastic\nlattice gases. To check the predictions of the theory, we perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the two-component AHR model. Its steady state is computed using\nthe matrix product ansatz. Thereby all coefficients appearing in the coupled\nKPZ equations are deduced from the microscopic model. Time correlations in the\nsteady state are simulated and we confirm not only the scaling exponent, but\nalso the scaling function and the non-universal coefficients.\n", "  A quasi-Hermitian operator is an operator that is similar to its adjoint in\nsome sense, via a metric operator, i.e., a strictly positive self-adjoint\noperator. Whereas those metric operators are in general assumed to be bounded,\nwe analyze the structure generated by unbounded metric operators in a Hilbert\nspace. Following our previous work, we introduce several generalizations of the\nnotion of similarity between operators. Then we explore systematically the\nvarious types of quasi-Hermitian operators, bounded or not. Finally we discuss\ntheir application in the so-called pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics.\n", "  We analyze the ground state properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures using a\nmean-field treatment of the boson-fermion interaction on a simple cubic\nlattice. In the deep superfluid limit of the bosonic sector and the BCS regime\nof the fermion sector, we derive BCS-type equations to determine the phase\ndiagram of the system. We find a competition between a charge density wave and\na superconducting phase. In the opposite limit, we study the Mott insulator to\nsuperfluid transition of the bosonic sector in the presence of a staggered\ndensity-induced alternating potential provided by the fermions, and determine\nthe mean-field transition line. In the two-superfluid phase of the mixture we\nrestrict to nearest-neighbor induced interactions between the fermions and\nconsider the extended Hubbard model. We perform a mean-field analysis of the\ncritical temperature for the formation of boson-assisted $s$-, extended $s^-$-,\n$d$-, and $p$-wave pairs at fermionic half filling. We compare our results with\na recent dynamical mean-field study [Anders \\emph{et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf\n109}, 206401].\n", "  A computational technique for calculating nullity vectors and kernel vectors,\nusing the new Finsler package, is introduced. As an application, three\ninteresting counterexamples are given. The first counterexample shows that the\ntwo distributions $\\mathrm{Ker}_R$ and $\\N_R$ do not coincide. The second shows\nthat the nullity distribution $\\N_{P^\\circ}$ is not completely integrable. The\nthird shows that the nullity distribution $\\N_\\mathfrak{R}$ is not a\nsub-distribution of the nullity distribution $\\N_{R^\\circ}$.\n", "  It is well understood --- through string dualities --- that there are 20\nmassless vector fields in the spectrum of eight-dimensional F-theory\ncompactifications on smooth elliptically fibered K3 surfaces at a generic point\nin the K3 moduli space. Such F-theory vacua, which do not have any enhanced\ngauge symmetries, can be thought of as supersymmetric type IIB\ncompactifications on P1 with 24 (p,q) seven-branes. Naively, one might expect\nthere to be 24 massless vector fields in the eight-dimensional effective theory\ncoming from world-volume gauge fields of the 24 branes. In this paper, we show\nhow the vector field spectrum of the eight-dimensional effective theory can be\nobtained from the point of view of type IIB supergravity coupled to the\nworld-volume theory of the seven-branes. In particular, we first show that the\ntwo-forms of the type IIB theory absorb the seven-brane world-volume gauge\nfields via the Cremmer-Scherk mechanism. We then proceed to show that the\nmassless vector fields of the eight-dimensional theory come from KK-reducing\nthe SL(2,Z) doublet two-forms of type IIB theory along SL(2,Z) doublet\none-forms on the P1. We also discuss the relation between these vector fields\nand the \"eaten\" world-volume vector fields of the seven-branes.\n", "  We propose a unified approach to a general class of codimension-2 defects in\nfield theories with non-trivial duality symmetries and discuss various\nconstructions of such \"duality defects\" in diverse dimensions. In particular,\nin d=4 we propose a new interpretation of the Seiberg-Witten u-plane by\n\"embedding\" it in the physical space-time: we argue that it describes a BPS\nconfiguration of two duality defects (at the monopole/dyon points) and propose\nits vast generalization based on Lefschetz fibrations of 4-manifolds.\n", "  We discuss how to calculate genuine multipartite quantum and classical\ncorrelations in symmetric, spatially invariant, mixed $n$-qubit density\nmatrices. We show that the existence of symmetries greatly reduces the amount\nof free parameters to be optimized in order to find the optimal measurement\nthat minimizes the conditional entropy in the discord calculation. We apply\nthis approach to the states exhibited dynamically during a thermodynamic\nprotocol to extract maximum work. We also apply the symmetry criterion to a\nwide class of physically relevant cases of spatially homogeneous noise over\nmultipartite entangled states. Exploiting symmetries we are able to calculate\nthe nonlocal and genuine quantum features of these states and note some\ninteresting properties.\n", "  Given a LHS (Lattice of Hilbert spaces) $V_J$ and a symmetric operator $A$ in\n$V_J$, in the sense of partial inner product spaces, we define a generalized\nresolvent for $A$ and study the corresponding spectral properties. In\nparticular, we examine, with help of the KLMN theorem, the question of\ngeneralized eigenvalues associated to points of the continuous (Hilbertian)\nspectrum. We give some examples, including so-called frame multipliers.\n", "  In supersymmetric models with minimal particle content and without large\nleft-right squarks mixing, the conventional knowledge is that the Higgs Boson\nmass around 125 GeV leads to top squark masses ${\\cal O}(10)$ TeV, far beyond\nthe reach of colliders. Here, we pointed out that this conclusion is subject to\nseveral theoretical uncertainties. We find that electroweak symmetry breaking\nand evaluation of Higgs mass at a scale far away from the true electroweak\nsymmetry breaking scale introduce a large uncertainty in Higgs mass\ncalculation. We show that the electroweak symmetry breaking at the scale near\nthe true vacuum expectation value of Higgs field can increase the Higgs Boson\nmass about 4-5 GeV and can lower the bounds on squarks and slepton masses to 1\nTeV. Here we pointed out that the Higgs mass even with inclusion of radiative\ncorrections can vary with electroweak symmetry breaking scale. We calculate it\nat two loop level and show that it varies substantially. We argue that Higgs\nmass like other coupling parameters can vary with energy scale and the Higgs\npotential with all orders loop corrections is scale invariant. This uncertainty\nto the Higgs mass calculation due to electroweak symmetry breaking around the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale, normally taken as $\\sqrt{m_{\\tilde t_L} m_{\\tilde\nt_R}}$, to minimize the 1-loop radiative corrections can be removed if one\nconsiders all significant radiative contributions to make Higgs potential\nrenormalization group evolution scale invariant and evaluates electroweak\nsymmetry breaking at the scale near the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. A\nlarge parameter space becomes allowed when one considers electroweak symmetry\nbreaking at its true scale not only for producing correct values of the Higgs\nmasses, but also for providing successful breaking of this symmetry in more\nparameter spaces.\n", "  In this article we prove that many Hamiltonian systems that can not be\nseparably quantized in the classical approach of Robertson and Eisenhardt can\nbe separably quantized if we extend the class of admissible quantizations\nthrough a suitable choice of Riemann space adapted to the Poisson geometry of\nthe system. Actually, in this article we prove that for every quadratic in\nmomenta St\\\"ackel system (defined on a 2n-dimensional Poisson manifold) for\nwhich the St\\\"ackel matrix consists of monomials in position coordinates there\nexist infinitely many quantizations - parametrized by n arbitrary functions -\nthat turn this system into a quantum separable St\\\"ackel system.\n", "  HI intensity mapping (IM) is a novel technique capable of mapping the\nlarge-scale structure of the Universe in three dimensions and delivering\nexquisite constraints on cosmology, by using HI as a biased tracer of the dark\nmatter density field. This is achieved by measuring the intensity of the\nredshifted 21cm line over the sky in a range of redshifts without the\nrequirement to resolve individual galaxies. In this chapter, we investigate the\npotential of SKA1 to deliver HI intensity maps over a broad range of\nfrequencies and a substantial fraction of the sky. By pinning down the baryon\nacoustic oscillation and redshift space distortion features in the matter power\nspectrum -- thus determining the expansion and growth history of the Universe\n-- these surveys can provide powerful tests of dark energy models and\nmodifications to General Relativity. They can also be used to probe physics on\nextremely large scales, where precise measurements of spatial curvature and\nprimordial non-Gaussianity can be used to test inflation; on small scales, by\nmeasuring the sum of neutrino masses; and at high redshifts where non-standard\nevolution models can be probed. We discuss the impact of foregrounds as well as\nvarious instrumental and survey design parameters on the achievable\nconstraints. In particular we analyse the feasibility of using the SKA1\nautocorrelations to probe the large-scale signal.\n", "  Four different methods are applied here to study the precursors of flare\nactivity in the Active Region NOAA 10486. Two approaches track the temporal\nbehaviour of suitably chosen features (one, the weighted horizontal gradient\nWGM, is generalised form the horizontal gradient of the magnetic field, GM;\nanother is the sum of the horizontal gradient of the magnetic field, GS, for\nall sunspot pairs). WGM is a photospheric indicator that is a proxy measure of\nmagnetic non-potentiality of a specific area of the active region, i.e. it\ncaptures the temporal variation of the weighted horizontal gradient of magnetic\nflux summed up for the region where opposite magnetic polarities are highly\nmixed. The third one, referred to as the separateness parameter, S(lf),\nconsiders the overall morphology. Further, GS and S(lf) are photospheric newly\ndefined quick-look indicators of the polarity mix of the entire active region.\nThe fourth method is tracking the temporal variation of small x-ray flares,\ntheir times of succession and their energies observed by the Reuven Ramaty High\nEnergy Solar Spectroscopic Imager instrument. All approaches yield specific\npre-cursory signatures for the imminence of flares.\n", "  We study the Hawking radiation (HR) of scalar and Dirac particles (fermions)\nemitted from a rotating scalar hair black hole (RSHBH) within the context of\nthree dimensional ($3D$) Einstein gravity using non-minimally coupled scalar\nfield theory. Amalgamating the quantum tunneling approach with the\nWentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we obtain the tunneling rates\nof the outgoing particles across the event horizon. Inserting the resultant\ntunneling rates into the Boltzmann formula, we then obtain the Hawking\ntemperature ($T_{H}$) of the $3D$ RSHBH.\n", "  We calculate static and spherically symmetric solutions for the Rastall\nmodification of gravity to describe Neutron Stars (NS). The key feature of the\nRastall gravity is the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor\nproportionally to the space-time curvature. Using realistic equations of state\nfor the NS interior we place a conservative bound on the non-GR behaviour of\nthe Rastall theory which should be $\\lesssim 1\\%$ level. This work presents the\nmore stringent constraints on the deviations of GR caused by the Rastall\nproposal.\n", "  The \"standard\" model of cosmology is founded on the basis that the expansion\nrate of the universe is accelerating at present --- as was inferred originally\nfrom the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae. There exists now a much bigger\ndatabase of supernovae so we can perform rigorous statistical tests to check\nwhether these \"standardisable candles\" indeed indicate cosmic acceleration.\nTaking account of the empirical procedure by which corrections are made to\ntheir absolute magnitudes to allow for the varying shape of the light curve and\nextinction by dust, we find, rather surprisingly, that the data are still quite\nconsistent with a constant rate of expansion.\n", "  Recently, Goodman et al. (2014) argued that the very long, very thin infrared\ndark cloud \"Nessie\" lies directly in the Galactic mid-plane and runs along the\nScutum-Centaurus arm in position-position-velocity ($p-p-v$) space as traced by\nlower density $\\rm {CO}$ and higher density ${\\rm NH}_3$ gas. Nessie was\npresented as the first \"bone\" of the Milky Way, an extraordinarily long, thin,\nhigh-contrast filament that can be used to map our Galaxy's \"skeleton.\" Here,\nwe present evidence for additional bones in the Milky Way Galaxy, arguing that\nNessie is not a curiosity but one of several filaments that could potentially\ntrace Galactic structure. Our ten bone candidates are all long, filamentary,\nmid-infrared extinction features which lie parallel to, and no more than 20 pc\nfrom, the physical Galactic mid-plane. We use $\\rm {CO}$, ${\\rm N}_2{\\rm H}^+$,\n$\\rm {HCO}^+$, and ${\\rm NH}_3$ radial velocity data to establish the\nthree-dimensional location of the candidates in ${\\it p-p-v}$ space. Of the ten\ncandidates, six also: have a projected aspect ratio of $\\geqq$50:1; run along,\nor extremely close to, the Scutum-Centaurus arm in ${\\it p-p-v}$ space; and\nexhibit no abrupt shifts in velocity. The evidence presented here suggests that\nthese candidates are marking the locations of significant spiral features, with\nthe bone called filament 5 (\"BC_18.88-0.09\") being a close analog to Nessie in\nthe Northern Sky. As molecular spectral-line and extinction maps cover more of\nthe sky at increasing resolution and sensitivity, it should be possible to find\nmore bones in future studies.\n", "  Entanglement is a key ingredient for quantum technologies and a fundamental\nsignature of quantumness in a broad range of phenomena encompassing many-body\nphysics, thermodynamics, cosmology, and life sciences. For arbitrary\nmultiparticle systems, entanglement quantification typically involves\nnontrivial optimisation problems, and may require demanding tomographical\ntechniques. Here we develop an experimentally feasible approach to the\nevaluation of geometric measures of multiparticle entanglement. Our approach\nprovides analytical results for particular classes of mixed states of N qubits,\nand computable lower bounds to global, partial, or genuine multiparticle\nentanglement of any general state. For global and partial entanglement, useful\nbounds are obtained with minimum effort, requiring local measurements in just\nthree settings for any N. For genuine entanglement, a number of measurements\nscaling linearly with N is required. We demonstrate the power of our approach\nto estimate and quantify different types of multiparticle entanglement in a\nvariety of N-qubit states useful for quantum information processing and\nrecently engineered in laboratories with quantum optics and trapped ion setups.\n", "  In high energy heavy ion collisions of RHIC and LHC, a strongly interacting\nquark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created. This medium undergoes a hydrodynamic\nevolution, before it freezes out to form a hadronic matter. The initial state\nof the sQGP is determined by the initial distribution of the participating\nnucleons and their interactions. Due to the finite number of nucleons, the\ninitial distribution fluctuates on an event-by-event basis. The transverse\nplane anisotropy of the initial state can be translated into a series of\nanisotropy coefficients or eccentricities: second, third, fourth-order\nanisotropy etc. These anisotropies then evolve in time, and result in\nmeasurable momentum-space anisotropies, to be measured with respect to their\nrespective symmetry planes. In this paper we investigate the time evolution of\nthe anisotropies. With a numerical hydrodynamic code, we analyze how the speed\nof sound and viscosity influence this evolution.\n", "  In this paper a finite dimensional unital associative algebra is presented,\nand its group of algebra automorphisms is detailed. The studied algebra can\nphysically be understood as the creation operator algebra in a formal quantum\nfield theory at fixed momentum for a spin 1/2 particle along with its\nantiparticle. It is shown that the essential part of the corresponding\nautomorphism group can naturally be related to the conformal Lorentz group. In\naddition, the non-semisimple part of the automorphism group can be understood\nas \"dressing\" of the pure one-particle states. The studied mathematical\nstructure may help in constructing quantum field theories in a non-perturbative\nmanner. In addition, it provides a simple example of circumventing\nColeman-Mandula theorem using non-semisimple groups, without SUSY.\n", "  In this paper, we show the compatibility of the so-called \"dressing field\nmethod\", which allows a systematic reduction of gauge symmetries, with the\ninclusion of diffeomorphisms in the BRST algebra of a gauge theory. The\nrobustness of the scheme is illustrated on two examples where Cartan\nconnections play a significant role. The former is General Relativity, while\nthe latter concerns the second-order conformal structure where one ends up with\na BRST algebra handling both the Weyl residual symmetry and diffeomorphisms of\nspacetime. We thereby provide a geometric counterpart to the BRST cohomological\ntreatment used in~\\cite{Boulanger1} in the construction of a Weyl covariant\ntensor calculus.\n", "  Supersymmetric field theories can be studied exactly on suitable off-shell\nsupergravity backgrounds. We show that in two dimensions such backgrounds are\nidentifiable with BRST invariant backgrounds of topological gravity coupled to\nan abelian topological gauge multiplet. This latter background is required for\nthe consistent coupling of the topological `matter' YM theory to topological\ngravity. We make use of this topological point of view to obtain, in a simple\nand straightforward way, a complete classification of localizing supersymmetric\nbackgrounds in two dimensions. The BRST invariant topological backgrounds are\nparametrized by both Killing vectors and $S^1$-equivariant cohomology of the\n2-dimensional world-sheet. We reconstruct completely the supergravity\nbackgrounds from the topological data: some of the supergravity fields are\ntwisted versions of the topological backgrounds, but others are \"composite\",\ni.e. they are non-linear functionals of them. We recover all the known\nlocalizing 2-dimensional backgrounds and (infinitely) many more that have not\nbeen explored so far. We show that the supersymmetric $\\Omega$-deformation is\nnothing but the background value of the ghost-for-ghost of topological gravity,\na result which holds for other dimensions too. The new localizing backgrounds\nare characterized by non-trivial fluxes for both the graviphotons of the\nsupergravity multiplet.\n", "  Motivated by the recent developments of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics,\nwe analyze the structure generated by unbounded metric operators in a Hilbert\nspace. To that effect, we consider the notions of similarity and\nquasi-similarity between operators and explore to what extent they preserve\nspectral properties. Then we study quasi-Hermitian operators, bounded or not,\nthat is, operators that are quasi-similar to their adjoint and we discuss their\napplication in pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Finally, we extend the\nanalysis to operators in a partial inner product space (\\pip), in particular\nthe scale of Hilbert spaces generated by a single unbounded metric operator.\n", "  In this work we use a refined entropic sampling technique based on the\nWang-Landau method to study the spin-$1/2$ Baxter-Wu model. The static critical\nexponents were determined as $\\alpha=0.6545(68)$, $\\beta=0.0818(30)$,\n$\\gamma=1.18193(77)$, and $\\nu=0.66341(47)$. The estimate for the critical\ntemperature was $T_c=2.269194(45)$. We compare the present results with those\nobtained from other well established approaches and we find a startling\ncloseness with the exact values, besides the high precision reached for the\ncritical temperature. We also calculate the coefficients $a$ and $b$ for the\ndivergence of the microcanonical inverse temperature at the ground state\nachieving an excellent agreement in comparison with the simulation estimates.\n", "  We report on the observation of quantum coherence of Bose-Einstein condensed\nphotons in an optically-pumped, dye-filled microcavity. We find that coherence\nis long-range in space and time above condensation threshold, but short-range\nbelow threshold, compatible with thermal-equilibrium theory. Far above\nthreshold, the condensate is no longer at thermal equilibrium and is fragmented\nover non-degenerate, spatially overlapping modes. A microscopic theory\nincluding cavity loss, molecular structure and relaxation shows that this\nmultimode condensation is similar to multimode lasing induced by imperfect gain\nclamping.\n", "  We clarify issues of convexity, gauge-dependence and radiative corrections in\nrelation to tunneling rates. Despite the gauge dependence of the effective\naction at zero and finite temperature, it is shown that tunneling and\nnucleation rates remain independent of the choice of gauge-fixing. Taking as a\nstarting point the functional that defines the transition amplitude from a\nfalse vacuum onto itself, it is shown that decay rates are exactly determined\nby a non-convex, false vacuum effective action evaluated at an extremum. The\nlatter can be viewed as a generalized bounce configuration, and\ngauge-independence follows from the appropriate Nielsen identities. This holds\nfor any election of gauge-fixing that leads to an invertible Faddeev-Popov\nmatrix.\n", "  The most frequently proposed model for the origin of quasars holds that the\nhigh accretion rates seen in luminous active galactic nuclei are primarily\ntriggered during major mergers between gas-rich galaxies. While plausible for\ndecades, this model has only begun to be tested with statistical rigor in the\npast few years. Here we report on a Hubble Space Telescope study to test this\nhypothesis for $z=2$ quasars with high super-massive black hole masses\n($M_\\mathrm{BH}=10^9-10^{10}~M_\\odot{}$), which dominate cosmic black hole\ngrowth at this redshift. We compare Wide Field Camera 3 $F160W$ (rest-frame\n$V$-band) imaging of 19 point source-subtracted quasar hosts to a matched\nsample of 84 inactive galaxies, testing whether the quasar hosts have greater\nevidence for strong gravitational interactions. Using an expert ranking\nprocedure, we find that the quasar hosts are uniformly distributed within the\nmerger sequence of inactive galaxies, with no preference for quasars in\nhigh-distortion hosts. Using a merger/non-merger cutoff approach, we recover\ndistortion fractions of $f_\\mathrm{m,qso}=0.39\\pm{}0.11$ for quasar hosts and\n$f_\\mathrm{m,gal}=0.30\\pm{}0.05$ for inactive galaxies (distribution modes, 68%\nconfidence intervals), with both measurements subjected to the same\nobservational conditions and limitations. The slight enhancement in distorted\nfraction for quasar hosts over inactive galaxies is not significant, with a\nprobability that the quasar fraction is higher of\n$P(f_\\mathrm{m,qso}>f_\\mathrm{m,gal}) = 0.78$ ($0.78\\,\\sigma{}$), in line with\nresults for lower mass and lower $z$ AGN. We find no evidence that major\nmergers are the primary triggering mechanism for the massive quasars that\ndominate accretion at the peak of cosmic quasar activity.\n", "  Incremental information, as measured by the quantum entropy, is increasing\nwhen two ensembles are united. This result was proved by Lieb and Ruskai, and\nit is the foundation for the proof of strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.\nWe present a truly elementary proof of this fact in the context of the broader\nfamily of matrix entropies introduced by Chen and Tropp.\n", "  Monolayer WS2 offers great promise for use in optical devices due to its\ndirect bandgap and high photoluminescence intensity. While fundamental\ninvestigations can be performed on exfoliated material, large-area and high\nquality materials are essential for implementation of technological\napplications. In this work, we synthesize monolayer WS2 under various\ncontrolled conditions and characterize the films using photoluminescence, Raman\nand x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. We demonstrate that the introduction of\nhydrogen to the argon carrier gas dramatically improves the optical quality and\nincreases the growth area of WS2, resulting in films exhibiting mm2 coverage.\nThe addition of hydrogen more effectively reduces the WO3 precursor and\nprotects against oxidative etching of the synthesized monolayers. The\nstoichiometric WS2 monolayers synthesized using Ar+H2 carrier gas exhibit\nsuperior optical characteristics, with photoluminescence emission full width\nhalf maximum values below 40 meV and emission intensities nearly an order of\nmagnitude higher than films synthesized in a pure Ar environment.\n", "  A lower bound on the capacity of the split-step Fourier channel is derived.\nThe channel under study is a concatenation of smaller segments, within which\nthree operations are performed on the signal, namely, nonlinearity, linearity,\nand noise addition. Simulation results indicate that for a fixed number of\nsegments, our lower bound saturates in the high-power regime and that the\nlarger the number of segments is, the higher is the saturation point. We also\nobtain an alternative lower bound, which is less tight but has a simple\nclosed-form expression. This bound allows us to conclude that the saturation\npoint grows unbounded with the number of segments. Specifically, it grows as\n$c+(1/2)\\log(K)$, where $K$ is the number of segments and $c$ is a constant.\nThe connection between our channel model and the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is discussed.\n", "  Experiments on quantum degenerate Fermi gases of magnetic atoms and dipolar\nmolecules begin to probe their broken symmetry phases dominated by the\nlong-range, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction. Several candidate phases\nincluding the p-wave superfluid, the stripe density wave, and a supersolid have\nbeen proposed theoretically for two-dimensional spinless dipolar Fermi gases.\nYet the phase boundaries predicted by different approximations vary greatly,\nand a definitive phase diagram is still lacking. Here we present a theory that\ntreats all competing many-body instabilities in the particle-particle and\nparticle-hole channel on equal footing. We obtain the low temperature phase\ndiagram by numerically solving the functional renormalization-group flow\nequations and find a nontrivial density wave phase at small dipolar tilting\nangles and strong interactions, but no evidence of the supersolid phase. We\nalso estimate the critical temperatures of the ordered phases.\n", "  $ $In its usual form, Grover's quantum search algorithm uses $O(\\sqrt{N})$\nqueries and $O(\\sqrt{N} \\log N)$ other elementary gates to find a solution in\nan $N$-bit database. Grover in 2002 showed how to reduce the number of other\ngates to $O(\\sqrt{N}\\log\\log N)$ for the special case where the database has a\nunique solution, without significantly increasing the number of queries. We\nshow how to reduce this further to $O(\\sqrt{N}\\log^{(r)} N)$ gates for any\nconstant $r$, and sufficiently large $N$. This means that, on average, the\ngates between two queries barely touch more than a constant number of the $\\log\nN$ qubits on which the algorithm acts. For a very large $N$ that is a power of\n2, we can choose $r$ such that the algorithm uses essentially the minimal\nnumber $\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sqrt{N}$ of queries, and only\n$O(\\sqrt{N}\\log(\\log^{\\star} N))$ other gates.\n", "  We study the Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic Hamiltonian reduction for\n3+1-dimensional free and Abelian gauged Rarita-Schwinger theories that comprise\nGrassmannian fermionic fields. We obtain the relevant fundamental brackets and\nfind that they are in convenient forms for quantization. The brackets are\nindependent of whether the theories contain mass or gauge fields, and the\nstructure of constraints and symplectic potentials largely determine\ncharacteristic behaviors of the theories. We also note that, in contrast to the\nfree massive theory, the Dirac field equations for free massless\nRarita-Schwinger theory cannot be obtained in a covariant way.\n", "  Mott insulators can be portrayed as \"unsuccessful metals\": systems in which a\nstrong Coulomb repulsion prevents charge conduction notwithstanding the\nmetal-like density of conduction electrons. The possibility to unlock such\nlarge density of frozen carriers with an electric field offers a tantalizing\nopportunity to realize new Mott-based microelectronic devices. Here we\nexplicitly unveil how such unlocking happens by solving a simple, yet generic,\nmodel for correlated insulators using dynamical mean-field theory.\nSpecifically, we show that the electric breakdown of a Mott insulator can occur\nvia a first-order insulator-to-metal transition, characterized by an abrupt\ngap-collapse in sharp contrast to the Zener tunneling mechanism. The switch-on\nof charge conduction is due to the energetic stabilization of a metallic phase\nthat preexists as metastable state in equilibrium and is disconnected from the\nstable insulator. Our findings rationalize recent experimental observations and\noffer a guideline for future technological research.\n", "  This paper examines the interaction of an intense fermion field with all of\nthe particle species of an attometer primordial black hole's (PBH)'s high\nenergy Hawking radiation spectrum. By extrapolating to Planck-sized PBH's, it\nis shown that, although Planck-sized PBH's closely simulate the zero absorption\nrequirement of white holes, the absorption probability is not truly zero, and\ntherefore, thermodynamically, Planck-sized PBH's are not true white holes.\n", "  Magnetism in transition metal compounds is usually considered starting from a\ndescription of isolated ions, as exact as possible, and treating their\n(exchange) interaction at a later stage. We show that this standard approach\nmay break down in many cases, especially in $4d$ and $5d$ compounds. We argue\nthat there is an important intersite effect -- an orbital-selective formation\nof covalent metal-metal bonds, which leads to an \"exclusion\" of corresponding\nelectrons from the magnetic subsystem, and thus strongly affects magnetic\nproperties of the system. This effect is especially prominent for noninteger\nelectron number, when it results in suppression of the famous double exchange,\nthe main mechanism of ferromagnetism in transition metal compounds. We study\nthis novel mechanism analytically and numerically and show that it explains\nmagnetic properties of not only several $4d-5d$ materials, including\nNb$_2$O$_2$F$_3$ and Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$, but can also be operative in $3d$\ntransition metal oxides, e.g. in CrO$_2$ under pressure. We also discuss the\nrole of spin-orbit coupling on the competition between covalency and magnetism.\nOur results demonstrate that strong intersite coupling may invalidate the\nstandard single-site starting point for considering magnetism, and can lead to\na qualitatively new behaviour.\n", "  Measurements of the coherence factor $R_{K3\\pi}$, the average strong-phase\ndifference $\\delta^{K3\\pi}_D$ and mean amplitude ratio $r_D^{K3\\pi}$ for the\ndecay $D \\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ are presented. These parameters are important\ninputs to the determination of the unitarity triangle angle $\\gamma$ in $B^-\n\\to DK^-$ decays, where $D$ designates a superposition of $D^0$ and\n$\\bar{D}{}^0$ mesons decaying to a common final state. The results are based on\na combined fit to observables obtained from a re-analysis of the CLEO-c\n$\\psi(3770)$ data set and those measured in a $D^0\\bar{D}^0$ mixing study\nperformed by the LHCb collaboration.\n", "  We show that higher-harmonics exchange scattering from a magnetic adatom on\nthe surface of a three dimensional topological insulator leads to a magnetic\nanisotropy whose magnitude and sign may be tuned by adjusting the chemical\npotential of the helical surface band. As chemical potential moves from the\nDirac point towards the surface band edge, the surface normal is found to\nchange from magnetic easy, to hard axis. Hexagonal warping is shown to diminish\nthe region with easy axis anisotropy, and to suppress the anisotropy\naltogether. This indirect contribution can be comparable in magnitude to the\nintrinsic term arising from crystal field splitting and atomic spin-orbit\ncoupling, and its tunability with chemical potential makes the two\ncontributions experimentally discernible, and endows this source of anisotropy\nwith potentially interesting magnetic functionality.\n", "  We review recent progress in understanding the notion of locality in\nintegrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called\nquasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of\nlocality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of\nquasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined,\nspecializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved\noperators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary\nspace algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be\nnaturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model,\nand non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges,\nmanifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter\napplications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are\npresented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport\nproperties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in\nthe quantum quench scenario.\n", "  Vanadium dioxide is of broad interest as a spin-1/2 electron system that\nrealizes a metal-insulator transition near room temperature, due to a\ncombination of strongly correlated and itinerant electron physics. Here,\nresonant inelastic X-ray scattering is used to measure the excitation spectrum\nof charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom at the vanadium L-edge under\ndifferent polarization and temperature conditions. These spectra reveal the\nevolution of energetics across the metal-insulator transition, including the\nlow temperature appearance of a strong candidate for the singlet-triplet\nexcitation of a vanadium dimer.\n", "  Exchangeable models for countable vertex-labeled graphs cannot replicate the\nlarge sample behaviors of sparsity and power law degree distribution observed\nin many network datasets. Out of this mathematical impossibility emerges the\nquestion of how network data can be modeled in a way that reflects known\nempirical behaviors and respects basic statistical principles. We address this\nquestion by observing that edges, not vertices, act as the statistical units in\nnetworks constructed from interaction data, making a theory of edge-labeled\nnetworks more natural for many applications. In this context we introduce the\nconcept of {\\em edge exchangeability}, which unlike its vertex exchangeable\ncounterpart admits models for networks with sparse and/or power law structure.\nOur characterization of edge exchangeable networks gives rise to a class of\nnonparametric models, akin to graphon models in the vertex exchangeable\nsetting. Within this class, we identify a tractable family of distributions\nwith a clear interpretation and suitable theoretical properties, whose\nsignificance in estimation, prediction, and testing we demonstrate.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate how nonlocal correlations affect, selectively,\nthe physics of correlated electrons over different energy scales, from the\nFermi level to the band-edges. This goal is achieved by applying a diagrammatic\nextension of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), the dynamical vertex\napproximation (D$\\Gamma$A), to study several spectral and thermodynamic\nproperties of the unfrustrated Hubbard model in two and three dimensions.\nSpecifically, we focus first on the low-energy regime by computing the\nelectronic scattering rate and the quasiparticle mass renormalization for\ndecreasing temperatures at a fixed interaction strength. This way, we obtain a\nprecise characterization of the several steps, through which the Fermi-liquid\nphysics is progressively destroyed by nonlocal correlations. Our study is then\nextended to a broader energy range, by analyzing the temperature behavior of\nthe kinetic and potential energy, as well as of the corresponding energy\ndistribution functions. Our findings allow us to identify a smooth, but\ndefinite evolution of the nature of nonlocal correlations by increasing\ninteraction: They either increase or decrease the kinetic energy w.r.t. DMFT\ndepending on the interaction strength being weak or strong, respectively. This\nreflects the corresponding evolution of the ground state from a nesting-driven\n(Slater) to a superexchange-driven (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet (AF), whose\nfingerprints are, thus, recognizable in the spatial correlations of the\nparamagnetic phase. Finally, a critical analysis of our numerical results of\nthe potential energy at the largest interaction allows us to identify possible\nprocedures to improve the ladder-based algorithms adopted in the dynamical\nvertex approximation.\n", "  We construct Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering signatures for the\nnonlocality of the entangled superposition state described by\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\{|N\\rangle|0\\rangle+|0\\rangle|N\\rangle\\}$, called the\ntwo-mode NOON state. The signatures are a violation of an EPR steering\ninequality based on an uncertainty relation. The violation confirms an EPR\nsteering between the two modes and involves certification of an inter-mode\ncorrelation for number, as well as quadrature phase amplitude measurements. We\nalso explain how the signatures certify an $N$th order quantum coherence, so\nthe system (for larger $N$) can be signified to be in a superposition of states\ndistinct by a mesoscopic value of the two-mode quantum number difference.\nFinally, we examine the limitations imposed for lossy scenarios, discussing how\nexperimental realisations may be possible for $N=2,3$.\n", "  We propose a superconducting circuit that shows a super-radiant phase\ntransition (SRPT) in the thermal equilibrium. The existence of the SRPT is\nconfirmed analytically in the limit of an infinite number of artificial atoms.\nWe also perform numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian with a finite\nnumber of atoms and observe an asymptotic behavior approaching the infinite\nlimit as the number of atoms increases. The SRPT can also be interpreted\nintuitively in a classical analysis.\n", "  We present Spin-SILC, a new foreground component separation method that\naccurately extracts the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation $E$ and\n$B$ modes from raw multifrequency Stokes $Q$ and $U$ measurements of the\nmicrowave sky. Spin-SILC is an internal linear combination method that uses\nspin wavelets to analyse the spin-2 polarisation signal $P = Q + iU$. The\nwavelets are additionally directional (non-axisymmetric). This allows different\nmorphologies of signals to be separated and therefore the cleaning algorithm is\nlocalised using an additional domain of information. The advantage of spin\nwavelets over standard scalar wavelets is to simultaneously and\nself-consistently probe scales and directions in the polarisation signal $P = Q\n+ iU$ and in the underlying $E$ and $B$ modes, therefore providing the ability\nto perform component separation and $E$-$B$ decomposition concurrently for the\nfirst time. We test Spin-SILC on full-mission Planck simulations and data and\nshow the capacity to correctly recover the underlying cosmological $E$ and $B$\nmodes. We also demonstrate a strong consistency of our CMB maps with those\nderived from existing component separation methods. Spin-SILC can be combined\nwith the pseudo- and pure $E$-$B$ spin wavelet estimators presented in a\ncompanion paper to reliably extract the cosmological signal in the presence of\ncomplicated sky cuts and noise. Therefore, it will provide a\ncomputationally-efficient method to accurately extract the CMB $E$ and $B$\nmodes for future polarisation experiments.\n", "  We demonstrate the first buried optical waveguides in diamond using focused\nfemtosecond laser pulses. The properties of nitrogen vacancy centers are\npreserved in the waveguides, making them promising for diamond-based\nmagnetometers or quantum information systems.\n", "  We study resurgence properties of partition function of SU(2) Chern-Simons\ntheory (WRT invariant) on closed three-manifolds. We check explicitly that in\nvarious examples Borel transforms of asymptotic expansions posses expected\nanalytic properties. In examples that we study we observe that contribution of\nirreducible flat connections to the path integral can be recovered from\nasymptotic expansions around abelian flat connections. We also discuss\nconnection to Floer instanton moduli spaces, disk instantons in 2d sigma\nmodels, and length spectra of \"complex geodesics\" on the A-polynomial curve.\n", "  Motivated by recent advances in cold atomic systems, we study the equilibrium\nand quench properties of two dimensional fermions with quadratic band touching\nat the Fermi level, in the presence of infinitely long range interactions.\nUnlike when only short range interactions are present, both nematic and quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) states state appear at weak interactions, separated by a\nnarrow coexistence region, whose boundaries mark second and third order quantum\nphase transitions. After an interaction quench, the QAH order exhibits three\ndistinct regions: persistent or damped oscillations and exponential decay to\nzero. In contrast, the nematic order always reaches a non-zero stationary value\nthrough power law damped oscillations, due to the interplay of the symmetry of\nthe interaction and the specific topology of the quadratic band touching.\n", "  Activity-related variations in the solar oscillation properties have been\nknown for 30 years. However, the relative importance of the different\ncontributions to the observed variations is not yet fully understood. Our goal\nis to estimate the relative contribution from sunspots to the observed\nactivity-related variations in the frequencies of the acoustic modes. We use a\nvariational principle to relate the phase differences induced by sunspots on\nthe acoustic waves to the corresponding changes in the frequencies of the\nglobal acoustic oscillations. From the sunspot properties (area and latitude as\na function of time), we are able to estimate the spot-induced frequency shifts.\nThese are then combined with a smooth frequency shift component, associated\nwith long-term solar-cycle variations, and the results compared with the\nfrequency shifts derived from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) data.\nThe result of this comparison is consistent with a sunspot contribution to the\nobserved frequency shifts of roughly 30 per cent, with the remaining 70 per\ncent resulting mostly from a global, non-stochastic variation, possibly related\nto the changes in the overall magnetic field. Moreover, analysis of the\nresiduals obtained after the subtraction of the model frequency shifts from the\nobservations indicates the presence of a 1.5-yr periodicity in the data in\nphase with the quasi-biennial variations reported in the literature.\n", "  We consider the system of two material points that interact by elastic forces\naccording to Hooke's law and their motion is restricted to certain curves lying\non the plane. The nonintegrability of this system and idea of the proof are\ncommunicated. Moreover, the analysis of global dynamics by means of Poincar\\'e\ncross sections is given and local analysis in the neighborhood of an\nequilibrium is performed by applying the Birkhoff normal form. Conditions of\nlinear stability are determined and some particular periodic solutions are\nidentified.\n", "  We analytically investigate the effective-diffusivity tensor of a tracer\nparticle in a fluid flow endowed with a short correlation time. By means of\nfunctional calculus and a multiscale expansion, we write down the main\ncontributions to the eddy diffusivity due to each single physical effect and to\ntheir interplays. Namely, besides molecular diffusivity and a constant uniform\nmean streaming, we take into account the possibility for the (incompressible,\nGaussian, stationary, homogeneous, isotropic) turbulent fluctuations to break\nparity invariance. With respect to the classical turbulence-driven diffusivity\namplification for delta-correlated flows, we find that the presence of a short\ntemporal correlation induces a diminution even when coupled with such effects,\nwith two principal exceptions. Notably, the diffusivity is --- perturbatively\n--- enlarged not only by the helical contribution itself, but also by the\ninterference between molecular diffusion and mean flow.\n", "  The recent advent of wave-shaping methods has demonstrated the focusing of\nlight through and inside even the most strongly scattering materials. Typically\nin wavefront shaping, light is focused in an area with the size of one speckle\nspot. It has been shown that the intensity is not only increased in the target\nspeckle spot, but also in an area outside the optimized speckle spot.\nConsequently, the total transmission is enhanced, even though only the\nintensity in a single speckle spot is controlled. Here, we experimentally study\nhow the intensity enhancement on both interfaces of a scattering medium depends\non the optimization area on the transmission side. We observe that as the\noptimization radius increases, the enhancement of the total transmitted\nintensity increases. We find a concomitant decrease of the total reflected\nintensity, which implies an energy redistribution between transmission and\nreflection channels. In addition, we find a qualitative evidence of a\nlong-range reflection-transmission correlation. Our result is useful for\nefficient light harvesting in solar cells, multi-channel quantum secure\ncommunications, imaging, and complex beam delivery through a scattering medium.\n", "  Light enables manipulating many-body states of matter, and atoms trapped in\noptical lattices is a prominent example. However, quantum properties of light\nare completely neglected in all quantum gas experiments. Extending methods of\nquantum optics to many-body physics will enable phenomena unobtainable in\nclassical optical setups. We show how using the quantum optical feedback\ncreates strong correlations in bosonic and fermionic systems. It balances two\ncompeting processes, originating from different fields: quantum backaction of\nweak optical measurement and many-body dynamics, resulting in stabilized\ndensity waves, antiferromagnetic and NOON states. Our approach is extendable to\nother systems promising for quantum technologies.\n", "  Imaging the propagation of light in time and space is crucial in optics,\nnotably for the study of complex media. We here demonstrate the passive\nmeasurement of time-dependent Green's functions between every point at the\nsurface of a strongly scattering medium by means of low coherence\ninterferometry. The experimental access to this Green's matrix is essential\nsince it contains all the information about the complex trajectories of light\nwithin the medium. In particular, the spatio-temporal spreading of the\ndiffusive halo and the coherent backscattering effect can be locally\ninvestigated in the vicinity of each point acting as a virtual source. On the\none hand, this approach allows a quantitative imaging of the diffusion constant\nin the scattering medium with a spatial resolution of the order of a few\ntransport mean free paths. On the other hand, our approach is able to reveal\nand quantify the anisotropy of light diffusion, which can be of great interest\nfor optical characterization purposes. This study opens important perspectives\nboth in optical diffuse tomography with potential applications to biomedical\nimaging and in fundamental physics for the experimental investigation of\nAnderson localization.\n", "  Time-energy high-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) leverages the\nhigh-dimensional nature of time-energy entangled biphotons and the loss\ntolerance of single-photon detection to achieve long-distance key distribution\nwith high photon information efficiency. To date, the general-attack security\nof HD-QKD has only been proven in the asymptotic regime, while HD-QKD's\nfinite-key security has only been established for a limited set of attacks.\nHere we fill this gap by providing a rigorous HD-QKD security proof for general\nattacks in the finite-key regime. Our proof relies on a novel entropic\nuncertainty relation that we derive for time and conjugate-time measurements\nusing dispersive optics, and our analysis includes an efficient decoy-state\nprotocol in its parameter estimation. We present numerically-evaluated\nsecret-key rates illustrating the feasibility of secure and composable HD-QKD\nover metropolitan-area distances when the system is subjected to the most\npowerful eavesdropping attack.\n", "  We study spacetime singularities in a general five-dimensional braneworld\nwith curved branes satisfying four-dimensional maximal symmetry. The bulk is\nsupported by an analog of perfect fluid with the time replaced by the extra\ncoordinate. We show that contrary to the existence of finite distance\nsingularities from the brane location in any solution with flat (Minkowski)\nbranes, in the case of curved branes there are singularity-free solutions for a\nrange of equations of state compatible with the null energy condition.\n", "  We introduce a new mechanism for the chiral magnetic effect that does not\nrequire an initial chirality imbalance. The chiral magnetic current is\ngenerated by reconnections of magnetic flux that change the magnetic helicity\nof the system. The resulting current is entirely determined by the change of\nmagnetic helicity, and it is quantized.\n", "  Exploiting conformal symmetry, we derive a simple exact formula for the\nclassical electromagnetic Casimir interaction of two perfectly conducting\nthree-spheres, including the sphere-plate geometry as a special case, in four\neuclidean dimensions. We verify that the short distance expansion of the\nCasimir energy agrees to leading order with the Proximity Force Approximation\n(PFA), while the next-to-leading-order is in agreement with a recently proposed\nderivative expansion of the Casimir energy. At the next-to-next-to-leading\norder we find a non-analytic correction to PFA, which for a sphere-plate system\nis of the order of $(d/R)^{3/2} \\log(d/R)$, where $d$ is the separation and $R$\nthe sphere radius.\n", "  The quantum character of Josephson junctions is ordinarily revealed through\nthe analysis of the switching currents, i.e. the current at which a finite\nvoltage appears: A sharp rise of the voltage signals the passage (tunnel) from\na trapped state (the zero voltage solution) to a running state (the finite\nvoltage solution). In this context, we investigate the probability distribution\nof the Josephson junctions switching current taking into account the effect of\nthe bias sweeping rate and introducing a simple nonideal quantum measurements\nscheme. The measurements are modelled as repeated voltage samplings at discrete\ntime intervals, that is with repeated projections of the time dependent quantum\nsolutions on the static or the running states, to retrieve the probability\ndistribution of the switching currents. The distribution appears to be immune\nof the quantum Zeno effect, and it is close to, but distinguishable from, the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. For energy barriers comparable to the\nquantum fundamental energy state and in the fast bias current ramp rate the\ndifference is neat, and remains sizeable in the asymptotic slow rate limit.\nThis behaviour is a consequence of the quantum character of the system that\nconfirms the presence of a backreaction of quantum measurements on the outcome\nof mesoscopic Josephson junctions.\n", "  We show that several features (the three-dimensional XY universality for\nmoderate underdoping, the almost-BCS behaviour for moderate overdoping and the\ncritical exponent) of the superfluid density in hole-doped cuprates hint at a\ncomposite structure of the holes. This idea can be implemented in a spin-charge\ngauge approach to the $t - t' - J$ model and provides indeed good agreement\nwith available experimental data.\n", "  It is known that HLL-type schemes are more dissipative than schemes based on\ncharacteristic decompositions. However, HLL-type methods offer greater\nflexibility to large systems of hyperbolic conservation laws because the\neigenstructure of the flux Jacobian is not needed. We demonstrate in the\npresent work that several HLL-type Riemann solvers are provably entropy stable.\nFurther, we provide convex combinations of standard dissipation terms to create\nhybrid HLL-type methods that have less dissipation while retaining entropy\nstability. The decrease in dissipation is demonstrated for the ideal MHD\nequations with a numerical example.\n", "  Direct imaging has led to the discovery of several giant planet and brown\ndwarf companions. These imaged companions populate a mass, separation and age\ndomain (mass>1MJup, orbits>5AU, age<1Gyr) quite distinct from the one occupied\nby exoplanets discovered by the radial velocity or transit methods. This\ndistinction could pinpoint that different formation mechanisms are at play. We\naim at investigating correlations between the host star's mass and the presence\nof wide-orbit giant planets, and at providing new observational constraints on\nplanetary formation models. We observed 58 young and nearby M-type dwarfs in\nL'-band with the VLT/NaCo instrument and used ADI algorithms to optimize the\nsensitivity to planetary-mass companions and to derive the best detection\nlimits. We estimate the probability of detecting a planet as a function of its\nmass and physical separation around each target. We conduct a Bayesian analysis\nto determine the frequency of substellar companions orbiting low-mass stars,\nusing a homogenous sub-sample of 54 stars. We derive a frequency of\n$4.4^{+3.2}_{-1.3}\\%$ for companions with masses in the range of 2-80MJup}, and\n$2.3^{+2.9}_{-0.7}$\\% for planetary mass companions (2-14MJup), at physical\nseparations of 8 to 400AU for both cases. Comparing our results with a previous\nsurvey targeting more massive stars, we find evidence that substellar\ncompanions more massive than 1MJup with a low mass ratio Q with respect to\ntheir host star (Q<1%), are less frequent around low-mass stars. This may\nrepresent an observational evidence that the frequency of imaged wide-orbit\nsubstellar companions is correlated with stellar mass, corroborating\ntheoretical expectations. On the opposite, we show statistical evidence that\nintermediate-mass ratio (1%<Q<5%) companion with masses >2MJup might be\nindependent from the mass of the host star.\n", "  Recent timing observation constrained the braking index of the X-ray pulsar\nPSR J1640-4631 to be $n=3.15\\pm0.03$, which is the highest value of all pulsars\nwith measured braking indices so far. In this Letter, we investigate whether\npulsar braking by combined between the magnetic dipole emission and the\ngravitational radiation might have a braking index greater than three. For\nconventional neutron star and low mass quark star candidates, the inferred\nellipticities derived by the observed braking index are obviously much larger\nthan the theoretical estimated maximum value. If PSR J1640-4631 is a low-mass\nneutron star with a mass of $0.1~ \\rm M_{\\odot}$, the inferred ellipticity can\nbe approximately equal to the theoretical estimated maximum value. Because of\nthe radio-quiet nature of this source, we employ the vacuum gap model developed\nby Ruderman and Sutherland to constrain the inclination angle to be\n$87.2-90^{\\circ}$. Based on this, we propose that a low-mass neutron star with\na large inclination angle can interpret the high braking index and the\nradio-quiet nature of this source. Future observations such as gravitational\nwave detection and long-term timing for this source are required to confirm or\nconfute our scenario.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic spintronics is an emerging field; antiferromagnets can\nimprove the functionalities of ferromagnets with higher response times, and\nhaving the information shielded against external magnetic field. Moreover, a\nlarge list of aniferromagnetic semiconductors and metals with N\\'eel\ntemperatures above room temperature exists. In the present manuscript, we\npersevere in the quest for the limits of how large can anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance be in antiferromagnetic materials with very large spin-orbit\ncoupling. We selected IrMn as a prime example of first-class moment (Mn) and\nspin-orbit (Ir) combination. Isothermal magnetotransport measurements in an\nantiferromagnetic-metal(IrMn)/ferromagnetic-insulator thin film bilayer have\nbeen performed. The metal/insulator structure with magnetic coupling between\nboth layers allows the measurement of the modulation of the transport\nproperties exclusively in the antiferromagnetic layer. Anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance as large as 0.15 % has been found, which is much larger than\nthat for a bare IrMn layer. Interestingly, it has been observed that\nanisotropic magnetoresistance is strongly influenced by the field cooling\nconditions, signaling the dependence of the found response on the formation of\ndomains at the magnetic ordering temperature.\n", "  We prove theorems about the Ricci and the Weyl tensors on generalized\nRobertson-Walker space-times of dimension $n\\ge 3$. In particular, we show that\nthe concircular vector introduced by Chen decomposes the Ricci tensor as a\nperfect fluid term plus a term linear in the contracted Weyl tensor. The Weyl\ntensor is harmonic if and only if it is annihilated by Chen's vector, and any\nof the two conditions is necessary and sufficient for the GRW space-time to be\na quasi-Einstein (perfect fluid) manifold. Finally, the general structure of\nthe Riemann tensor for Robertson-Walker space-times is given, in terms of\nChen's vector. A GRW space-time in n = 4 with null conformal divergence is a\nRobertson-Walker space-time.\n", "  It is generally believed that Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) evolved\nfrom binaries consisting of a neutron star accreting from a low-mass white\ndwarf or helium star where mass transfer is driven by gravitational radiation.\nHowever, the standard white-dwarf evolutionary channel cannot produce the\nrelatively long-period ($40 - 60$\\,min) UCXBs with high time-averaged\nmass-transfer rate. In this work, we explore an alternative evolutionary route\ntoward UCXBs where the companions evolve from intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars\nwith an anomalously strong magnetic field ($100 - 10000$\\,G). Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs. The simulated results indicate that, for a small\nwind-driving efficiency $f=10^{-5}$, the anomalous magnetic braking can drive\nIMXBs to an ultra-short period of 11 min. Comparing our simulated results with\nthe observed parameters of fifteen identified UCXBs, the anomalous magnetic\nbraking evolutionary channel can account for the formation of seven and eight\nsources with $f=10^{-3}$, and $10^{-5}$, respectively. In particular, a\nrelatively large value of $f$ can fit three of the long-period, persistent\nsources with high mass-transfer rate. Though the proportion of Ap/Bp stars in\nintermediate-mass stars is only 5\\%, the lifetime of the UCXB phase is\n$\\gtrsim$ 2 Gyr, producing a relatively high number of observable systems,\nmaking this an alternative evolutionary channel for the formation of UCXBs.\n", "  We study the influence of selfish vs. polite behaviours on the dynamics of a\npedestrian evacuation through a narrow exit. To this end, experiments involving\nabout 80 participants with distinct prescribed behaviours are performed;\nreinjection of participants into the setup allowed us to improve the\nstatistics. Notwithstanding the fluctuations in the instantaneous flow rate, we\nfind that a stationary regime is almost immediately reached. The average flow\nrate increases monotonically with the fraction c\\_s of vying (selfish)\npedestrians, which corresponds to a \"faster-is-faster\" effect in our\nexperimental conditions; it is also positively correlated with the average\ndensity of pedestrians in front of the door, up to nearly close-packing. At\nlarge c\\_s , the flow displays marked intermittency, with bursts of\nquasi-simultaneous escapes. In addition to these findings, we wonder whether\nthe effect of cooperation is specific to systems of intelligent beings, or\nwhether it can be reproduced by a purely mechanical surrogate. To this purpose,\nwe consider a bidimensional granular flow through an orifice in which some\ngrains are made \"cooperative\" by repulsive magnetic interactions which impede\ntheir mutual collisions.\n", "  We consider a neutrino mass generating model which employs a scalar\nleptoquark, $\\Delta$, and a scalar diquark, $S$. The new scalars $\\Delta$ and\n$S$ carry the standard model $SU(3)_c\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ quantum\nnumbers $(3,1,-1/3)$ and $(6,1,-2/3)$, respectively. The neutrino masses are\ngenerated at the two-loop level, as in the Zee-Babu model\\cite{Zee-Babu}, and\n$\\Delta/S$ plays the role of the doubly/singly charged scalar in the Zee-Babu\nmodel. With a moderate working assumption that the magnitudes of the six Yukawa\ncouplings between $S$ and the down-type quarks are of the same order, strong\nconnections are found between the neutrino masses and the charged lepton flavor\nviolating processes. In particular, we study $Z\\rightarrow \\overline{l} l'$,\nand $l\\rightarrow l' \\gamma$ and find that some portions of the parameter space\nof this model are within the reach of the planned charged lepton flavor\nviolating experiments. Interesting lower bounds are predicted that\n$B(Z\\rightarrow \\overline{l} l')\\gtrsim\n10^{-16}-10^{-14}(10^{-14})\\times(1\\mbox{TeV}\\cdot m_S/7 m_\\Delta^2)^2$ and\n$B(l\\rightarrow l' \\gamma)\\gtrsim 10^{-17}-10^{-16}(10^{-18}-10^{-16})\\times(1\n\\mbox{TeV}\\cdot m_S/7 m_\\Delta^2)^2$ for neutrino masses being the\nnormal(inverted) hierarchical pattern. The type of neutrino mass hierarchy\ncould also be determined by measuring the charged lepton flavor violating\ndouble ratios. Moreover, definite leptoquark decay branching ratios are\npredicted when there is no Yukawa interaction between the right-handed fermions\nand $\\Delta$ ( the branching fraction of $\\Delta$ to a charged lepton and a\nquark is 50\\%), which could help refine the collider search limit on the scalar\nleptoquark mass.\n", "  We consider an interacting quantum dot working as a coherent source of single\nelectrons. The dot is tunnel coupled to a reservoir and capacitively coupled to\na gate terminal with an applied ac potential. At low frequencies, this is the\nquantum analog of the RC circuit with a purely dynamical response. We\ninvestigate the quantized dynamics as a consequence of ac pulses with large\namplitude. Within a Keldysh-Green function formalism we derive the\ntime-dependent current in the Coulomb blockade regime. Our theory thus extends\nprevious models that considered either noninteracting electrons in nonlinear\nresponse or interacting electrons in the linear regime. We prove that the\nelectron emission and absorption resonances undergo a splitting when the\ncharging energy is larger than the tunnel broadening. For very large charging\nenergies, the additional peaks collapse and the original resonances are\nrecovered, though with a reduced amplitude. Quantization of the charge emitted\nby the capacitor is reduced due to Coulomb repulsion and additional plateaus\narise. Additionally, we discuss the differential capacitance and resistance as\na function of time. We find that to leading order in driving frequency the\ncurrent can be expressed as a weighted sum of noninteracting currents shifted\nby the charging energy.\n", "  Deterministic preparation of an ultracold harmonically trapped\none-dimensional Fermi gas consisting of a few fermions has been realized by the\nHeidelberg group. Using Floquet formalism, we study the time dynamics of two-\nand three-fermion systems in a harmonic trap under an oscillating magnetic\nfield. The oscillating magnetic field produces a time-dependent interaction\nstrength through a Feshbach resonance. We explore the dependence of these\ndynamics on the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field for\nnon-interacting, weakly interacting, and strongly interacting systems. We\nidentify the regimes where the system can be described by an effective\ntwo-state model and an effective three-state model. We find an unbounded\ncoupling to all excited states at the infinitely strong interaction limit and\nseveral simple relations that characterize the dynamics. Based on our findings,\nwe propose a technique for driving transition from the ground state to the\nexcited states using an oscillating magnetic field.\n", "  We study the decoherence of massive fields during inflation based on the\nZurek's density matrix approach. With the cubic interaction between inflaton\nand massive fields, the reduced density matrix for the massive fields can be\ncalculated in the Schr\\\"odinger picture which is related to the variance of the\nnon-Gaussian exponent in the wave functional. The decoherence rate is computed\nin the one-loop form from functional integration. For heavy fields with\n$m\\gtrsim \\mathcal{O}(H)$, quantum fluctuations will easily stay in the quantum\nstate and decoherence is unlikely. While for light fields with mass smaller\nthan $\\mathcal{O}(H)$, quantum fluctuations are easily decohered within\n$5\\sim10$ e-folds after Hubble crossing. Thus heavy fields can play a key role\nin studying problems involving inflationary quantum information.\n", "  We investigate the consequences of fairly normal Type Ia supernovae being\nembedded in compact and dense envelopes of carbon and oxygen rich circumstellar\nmaterial by means of detailed radiation hydrodynamic simulations. Our main\nfocus rests on exploring the effects of the interaction between ejecta and\ncircumstellar material on the ejecta evolution and the broad-band light curve.\nIn our calculations, we find that a strong reverse shock efficiently\ndecelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant\nbroadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower\ndecline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy\nis generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.\nOnly if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a\nsignificant boost in the optical light curve is observed. We discuss these\nfindings in particular in the context of the super-luminous event SN 2009dc. As\nour calculations are able to reproduce a number of its peculiar properties, we\nconclude that the flavour of the interaction scenario investigated in this work\nconstitutes a promising candidate to explain such 'Super-Chandrasekhar'\nsupernovae.\n", "  We study the dynamic of polaritons in the Keldysh functional formalism.\nDissipation is considered through the coupling of the exciton and photon fields\nto two independent photonic and excitonic baths. As such, this theory allows to\ndescribe more intricate decay mechanisms that depend dynamically on the state\nof the system, such as a direct upper-polariton lifetime, that is motivated\nfrom experiments. We show that the dynamical equations in the Keldysh framework\notherwise follow the same Josephson--like equations of motions than the\nstandard master equation approach, that is however limited to simple decay\nchannels. We also discuss the stability of the dynamic and reconsider the\ncriterion of strong coupling in the presence of upper polariton decay.\n", "  On strictly starshaped domains of second kind we find natural sufficient\nconditions which allow the solution of two long standing open problems closely\nrelated to the mean field equation $\\prl$ below. On one side we catch the\nglobal behaviour of the Entropy for the mean field Microcanonical Variational\nPrinciple ((MVP) for short) arising in the Onsager description of\ntwo-dimensional turbulence. This is the completion of well known results first\nestablished in Caglioti et al. Comm.Math.Phys. (1995). Among other things we\nfind a full unbounded interval of strict convexity of the Entropy. On the other\nside, to achieve this goal, we have to provide a detailed qualitative\ndescription of the global branch of solutions of $\\prl$ emanating from $\\lm=0$\nand crossing $\\lm=8\\pi$. This is the completion of well known results first\nestablished in Suzuki A.I.H.P. (1992) and Chang et al. New Stud. Adv. Math.\n(2003) for $\\lm\\leq 8\\pi$, and it has an independent mathematical interest,\nsince global branches of semilinear elliptic equations, with very few well\nknown exceptions, are poorly understood. The (MVP) suggests the right variable\n(which is the energy) to be used to obtain a global parametrization of\nsolutions of $\\prl$. A crucial spectral simplification is obtained by using the\nfact that, by definition, solutions of the (MVP) maximize the entropy at fixed\nenergy and total vorticity.\n", "  GeoClaw-STRICHE is designed for simulating the physical impacts of tsunami as\nit relates to erosion, transport and deposition. GeoClaw-STRICHE comprises of\nthree components: (1) nonlinear shallow water equations; (2)\nadvection-diffusion equation; (3) an equation for morphology updating. Multiple\ngrain sizes and sediment layers are added into GeoClaw-STRICHE to simulate\ngrain-size distribution and add the capability to develop grain-size trends\nfrom bottom to the top of a simulated deposit as well as along the inundation.\nUnlike previous models based on empirical equations or sediment concentration\ngradient, the standard Van Leer method is applied to calculate sediment flux.\nWe tested and verified GeoClaw-STRICHE with flume experiment by\n\\citet{johnson2016experimental} and data from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in\nKuala Meurisi as published in \\citet{JGRF:JGRF786}. The comparison with\nexperimental data shows GeoClaw-STRICHE's capability to simulate sediment\nthickness and grain-size distribution in experimental conditions. The agreement\nbetween experimental and model results is generally quite good, especially for\nsediment thickness, which builds confidence that sediment transport is\ncorrectly predicted by this model. The comparison with the data from the 2004\nIndian Ocean tsunami reveals that the pattern of sediment thickness is well\npredicted and is of similar quality, if not better than the established\ncomputational models such as Delft3D.\n", "  The energy dependence of various particle ratios is calculated within the\nUltra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics approach and compared with the\nhadron resonance gas (HRG) model and measurements from various experiments,\nincluding RHIC-BES, SPS and AGS. It is found that the UrQMD particle ratios\nagree well with the experimental results at the RHIC-BES energies. Thus, we\nhave utilized UrQMD in simulating particle ratios at other beam energies down\nto 3 GeV, which will be accessed at NICA and FAIR future facilities. We observe\nthat the particle ratios for crossover and first-order phase transition,\nimplemented in the hybrid UrQMD v3.4, are nearly indistinguishable, especially\nat low energies (at large baryon chemical potentials or high density).\n", "  We study the mobility and the diffusion coefficient of an inertial tracer\nadvected by a two-dimensional incompressible laminar flow, in the presence of\nthermal noise and under the action of an external force. We show, with\nextensive numerical simulations, that the force-velocity relation for the\ntracer, in the nonlinear regime, displays complex and rich behaviors, including\nnegative differential and absolute mobility. These effects rely upon a subtle\ncoupling between inertia and applied force which induce the tracer to persist\nin particular regions of phase space with a velocity opposite to the force. The\nrelevance of this coupling is revisited in the framework of non-equilibrium\nresponse theory, applying a generalized Einstein relation to our system. The\npossibility of experimental observation of these results is also discussed.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulation studies were performed to investigate the\nstructural and dynamic properties of liquid carbon disulfide from ambient to\nelevated pressure conditions. The results obtained have revealed structural\nchanges at high pressures, which are related to the more dense packing of the\nmolecules inside the first solvation shell. The calculated neutron and X-Ray\nstructure factors have been compared with available experimental diffraction\ndata, also revealing the pressure effects on the short-range structure of the\nliquid. The pressure effects on the translational, reorientational and\nresidence dynamics are very strong, revealing a significant slowing down when\ngoing from ambient pressure to 1.2 GPa. The translational dynamics of the\nlinear CS2 molecules have been found to be more anisotropic at elevated\npressures, where cage effects and librational motions are reflected on the\nshape of the calculated time correlation functions and their corresponding\nspectral densities.\n", "  We present a physical model for turbulent friction on rough surfaces with\nregularly distributed roughness elements. Wall shear stresses are expressed as\nfunctions of physical quantities. Surfaces with varying roughness densities and\nroughness elements with different aspect ratios are considered. We propose a\nstraight forward method based on the conservation of momentum to deduce the\ndrag on elements by expressing it as functions of the maximum drag and drag\nreductions ratios, as the drag on individual elements decreases as packing\ndensity increases. A drag reduction effect of momentum redistribution is\nproposed and the mutual sheltering effect is studied. These two drag reduction\nmechanisms for individual elements are significant for sparse and dense\nsurfaces, respectively. Reduction ratios for redistribution effect and mutual\nsheltering effect are deduced, for the two different types of rough surfaces.\nThe shear stress on elements and the total wall shear stress are obtained as\nthe result of the drag analysis. The estimated wall shear stresses of the\nproposed model are consistent with classical experimental measurements.\n", "  The pullback approach to global Finsler geometry is adopted. Some new types\nof special Finsler spaces are introduced and investigated, namely, Ricci,\ngeneralized Ricci, projectively recurrent and m-projectively recurrent Finsler\nspaces. The properties of these special Finsler spaces are studied and the\nrelations between them are singled out.\n", "  We present an analysis of a $190$\\,ks (net exposure) \\textit{Suzaku}\nobservation, carried out in 2007, of the nearby ($z=0.184$) luminous (L$_{\\rm\nbol}\\sim10^{47}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$) quasar PDS\\,456. In this observation, the\nintrinsically steep bare continuum is revealed compared to subsequent\nobservations, carried out in 2011 and 2013, where the source is fainter, harder\nand more absorbed. We detected two pairs of prominent hard and soft flares,\nrestricted to the first and second half of the observation respectively. The\nflares occur on timescales of the order of $\\sim50$\\,ks, which is equivalent to\na light-crossing distance of $\\sim10\\,R_{\\rm g}$ in PDS\\,456. From the spectral\nvariability observed during the flares, we find that the continuum changes\nappear to be dominated by two components: (i) a variable soft component\n($<2$\\,keV), which may be related to the Comptonized tail of the disc emission,\nand (ii) a variable hard power-law component ($>2$\\,keV). The photon index of\nthe latter power-law component appears to respond to changes in the soft band\nflux, increasing during the soft X-ray flares. Here the softening of the\nspectra, observed during the flares, may be due to Compton cooling of the disc\ncorona induced by the increased soft X-ray photon seed flux. In contrast, we\nrule out partial covering absorption as the physical mechanism behind the\nobserved short timescale spectral variability, as the timescales are likely too\nshort to be accounted for by absorption variability.\n", "  FS CMa stars are low-luminosity objects showing the B[e] phenomenon whose\nevolutionary origin is yet to be unraveled. Various binary-related hypotheses\nhave been recently proposed, two of them involving the spiral-in evolution of\nthe binary orbit. The latter occurs more often in dense stellar environments\nlike young massive clusters (YMCs). Hence, a systematic study of FS CMa stars\nin YMCs would be crucial to find out how these objects are created. In YMCs,\ntwo FS CMa stars have been confirmed and three candidates have been found\nthrough a search method based on narrow-band photometry at Paschen-$\\alpha$ and\nthe neighboring continuum. We apply this method to archival data from the\nPaschen-$\\alpha$ survey of the Galactic Center region, yielding a new candidate\nin the Quintuplet cluster. Limitations of this method and other alternatives\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the interstellar medium towards the TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray sources HESS J1640$-$465 and HESS J1641$-$463 using results from\nthe Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey and from a Mopra 7 mm-wavelength\nstudy. The $\\gamma$-ray sources are positionally coincident with two supernova\nremnants G338.3$-$0.0 and G338.5+0.1 respectively. A bright complex of HII\nregions connect the two SNRs and TeV objects. Observations in the CO(1-0)\ntransition lines reveal substantial amounts of diffuse gas positionally\ncoincident with the $\\gamma$-ray sources at multiple velocities along the line\nof sight, while 7 mm observations in CS, SiO, HC$_{3}$N and CH$_{3}$OH\ntransition lines reveal regions of dense, shocked gas. Archival HI data from\nthe Southern Galactic Plane Survey was used to account for the diffuse atomic\ngas. Physical parameters of the gas towards the TeV sources were calculated\nfrom the data. We find that for a hadronic origin for the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission, the cosmic-ray enhancement rates are $\\sim 10^{3}$ and $10^{2}$ times\nthe local solar value for HESS J1640$-$465 and HESS J1641$-$463 respectively.\n", "  The continue wave (CW) high current proton linac has wide applications as the\nfront end of the high power proton machines. The low energy part is the most\ndifficult one and there is no widely accepted solution yet. Both normal\nconducting and superconducting acceleration structures are thought to be the\npossible solutions. Although the characteristics of normal conducting\nstructures and superconducting ones are quite different, such as acceleration\nvoltage, maximum electric field and so on, we found the focusing properties of\nthe lattice composed by these two acceleration structures are quite similar for\ndifferent reasons. The advantages and disadvantages of lattices composed of\nboth the normal conducting and superconducting structures are analysed from the\nbeam dynamics point of view, and their constraints on beam main parameters are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Local Universe is the most detail studied part of the observable region\nof space with the radius R about 100 Mpc. There are two empirical fundamental\ncosmological laws directly established from observations in the Local Universe\nindependently from cosmological theory: first, the Hubble-Humason-Sandage\nlinear redshift-distance law and second, Carpenter- Karachentsev-deVaucouleurs\ndensity-radius power-law. Review of modern state of these empirical laws and\ntheir cosmological significance is given. Possible theoretical interpretations\nof the surprising coexistence of both laws at the spatial scales from 1 Mpc to\n100 Mpc are discussed. Comparison of the standard space-expansion explanation\nof the cosmological redshift with possible global gravitational redshift model\nis given\n", "  Atomic interferometers are often affected by magnetic field fluctuations.\nUsing the clock transition at zero magnetic field minimizes the effect of these\nfluctuations. There is another transition in rubidium that minimizes the\nmagnetic sensitivity at 3.2 G.We combine the previous two transitions to obtain\nminimum magnetic sensitivity at a tunable magnetic field between 2.2 and 3.2 G.\nThe two interferometers evolve independently from each other and we control the\nmagnetic sensitivity by changing the population in both transitions with a\nmicrowave pulse.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the magnetic properties of the long-range\nordered quasi-one dimensional $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ systems with a newly developed\ntorque equilibrium spin-wave expansion approach, which can describe the spin\nCasimir and magnon decay effects in a unified framework. While the framework\ndoes not lose the generality, our discussion will be restricted to two\nrepresentative types of inter-chain coupling systems: $J_{3}$- or\n$J_{4}$-system respectively. In spite of the long-range spiral order, the\ndynamical properties of these systems turn out to be highly nontrivial due to\nthe incommensurate noncollinear spin configuration and the strong quantum\nfluctuation effects enhanced by the frustration and low-dimensionality. Both\nthe systems show prominent spin Casimir effects induced by the vacuum\nfluctuation of the spin waves and related modification of the ordering vector,\nLifshitz point's position and sublattice magnetization. Significant and\nspontaneous magnon decay effects are manifested in the quantum corrections to\nthe excitation spectrum. By adjusting the strength of magnetic anisotropy and\nvarying the approximation scheme, it is revealed that these striking distinct\nfeatures are quite robust and have deep connection with both the spin Casimir\nand the magnon decay effects. Thus these special consequences of the\ninter-chain coupling on the spin wave dynamics may be served as a set of probes\nfor different types of inter-chain couplings in experiments. At last, to guide\nexperimental measurements such as inelastic neutron scattering in realistic\nmaterials and complement our theoretical framework, we develop the analytical\ntheory of the dynamical structure factor within the torque equilibrium\nformulism and provide the explicit results of the quasi-one dimensional\n$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ systems.\n", "  Low-dose nitrogen implantation induces in TiO2 nanotubes a co-catalytic\nactivity for photocatalytic H2-evolution. The use of an ion implantation\nprocess leads to a N-implanted zone only at the top part of the tubes. The\ncoupling of this top layer and the underlying non-implanted part of the\nnanotubes strongly contributes to an efficient carrier separation and thus to a\nsignificantly enhanced H2 generation.\n", "  In the present work we show, how a high pressure hydrogenation of commercial\nanatase or anatase/rutile powder can create a photocatalyst for hydrogen\nevolution that is highly effective and stable without the need of any\nadditional co-catalyst. This activation effect can not be observed for rutile.\nFor anatase/rutile mixtures, however, a strong synergistic effect is found\n(similar to findings commonly observed for noble metal decorated TiO2). ESR\nmeasurements indicate the intrinsic co-catalytic activation of anatase TiO2 to\nbe due to specific defect centers formed during hydrogenation.\n", "  Here we explore the evolution of galaxy ensembles at early times by writing\nthe in situ stellar mass growth of galaxies purely as a stationary stochastic\n(e.g., quasi-steady state) process. By combining the mathematics of such\nprocesses with Newtonian gravity and a mean local star formation efficiency, we\nshow that the stellar mass evolution of galaxy ensembles is directly related to\nthe average acceleration of baryons onto dark matter halos at the onset of star\nformation, with explicit dependencies on initial local matter densities and\nhalo mass. The density term specifically implies more rapid average rates of\ngrowth in higher density regions of the universe compared to low density\nregions, i.e., assembly bias. With this framework, using standard cosmological\nparameters, a mean star formation efficiency derived by other authors, and\nknowledge of the shape of the cosmological matter power spectrum at small\nscales, we analytically derive (1) the characteristic stellar masses of\ngalaxies (M*), (2) the power-law low-mass slope (alpha) and normalization\n(phi*) of the stellar mass function, and (3) the evolution of the stellar mass\nfunction in time over 12.5 > z > 2. Correspondingly, the rise in the cosmic\nstar formation rate density over these epochs, while the universe can sustain\nunabated fueling of star formation, also emerges naturally. All of our findings\nare consistent with the deepest available data, including the expectation of\nalpha~-7/5; i.e., a stellar mass function low-mass slope that is notably\nshallower than that of the halo mass function, and with no systematic\ndeviations from a mean star formation efficiency with density or mass, nor any\nexplicit, additional feedback mechanisms. These derivations yield a compelling\nrichness and complexity but also show that very few astrophysical details are\nrequired to understand the evolution of cosmic ensemble of galaxies at early\ntimes.\n", "  We present the results of a new study of the K-band galaxy luminosity\nfunction (KLF) at redshifts z<3.75, based on a nested combination of the\nUltraVISTA, CANDELS and HUDF surveys. The large dynamic range in luminosity\nspanned by this new dataset (3-4 dex over the full redshift range) is\nsufficient to clearly demonstrate for the first time that the faint-end slope\nof the KLF at z>0.25 is relatively steep (-1.3<alpha<-1.5 for a single\nSchechter function), in good agreement with recent theoretical and\nphenomenological models. Moreover, based on our new dataset we find that a\ndouble Schechter function provides a significantly improved description of the\nKLF at z<2. At redshifts z>0.25 the evolution of the KLF is remarkably smooth,\nwith little or no evolution evident at faint (M_K>-20.5) or bright magnitudes\n(M_K<-24.5). Instead, the KLF is seen to evolve rapidly at intermediate\nmagnitudes, with the number density of galaxies at M_K~-23 dropping by a factor\nof ~5 over the redshift interval 0.25<z<3.75. Motivated by this, we explore a\nsimple description of the evolving KLF based on a double Schechter function\nwith fixed faint-end slopes (alpha_1=-0.5, alpha_2=-1.5) and a shared\ncharacteristic magnitude (M_K*). According to this parameterisation, the\nnormalisation of the component which dominates the faint-end of the KLF remains\napproximately constant, with phi*_2 decreasing by only a factor of ~2 between\nz~0 and z~3.25. In contrast, the component which dominates the bright end of\nthe KLF at low redshifts evolves dramatically, becoming essentially negligible\nby z~3. Finally, we note that within this parameterisation, the observed\nevolution of M_K* between z~0 and z~3.25 is entirely consistent with M_K*\ncorresponding to a constant stellar mass of M*~5x10^10 Msun at all redshifts.\n", "  We use optical tweezers microrheology and fluorescence microscopy to apply\nnonlinear microscale strains to entangled and crosslinked actin networks, and\nmeasure the resulting stress and actin filament deformations. We couple\nnonlinear stress response and subsequent relaxation to the velocity profiles of\nindividual fluorescent-labeled actin segments at varying times throughout the\nstrain and varying distances from the strain path to determine the underlying\nmolecular dynamics that give rise to the debated nonlinear response and stress\npropagation of crosslinked and entangled actin networks at the microscale. We\nshow that initial stress stiffening arises from acceleration of strained\nfilaments due to molecular extension along the strain, while softening and\nyielding is coupled to filament deceleration, halting and recoil. We\ndemonstrate a surprising non-monotonic dependence of velocity profiles on\ncrosslinker concentration. Namely, networks with no crosslinks or substantial\ncrosslinks both exhibit fast initial filament velocities and reduced molecular\nrecoil while intermediate crosslinker concentrations display reduced velocities\nand increased recoil. We show that these collective results are due to a\nbalance of network elasticity and transient crosslinker unbinding and\nrebinding. We further show that elasticity and relaxation timescales display an\nexponential dependence on crosslinker concentration that reveal that crosslinks\ndominate entanglement dynamics when the length between crosslinkers becomes\nsmaller than the length between entanglements. In accord with recent\nsimulations, our relaxation dynamics demonstrate that post-strain stress can be\nlong-lived in crosslinked networks by distributing stress to a small fraction\nof highly-strained connected filaments that span the network and sustain the\nload, thereby allowing the rest of the network to recoil and relax.\n", "  HST images, MUSE maps of emission-lines, and an atlas of high velocity\nresolution emission-line spectra have been used to establish for the firrst\ntime correlations of the electron temperature, electron density, radial\nvelocity, turbulence, and orientation within the main ionization front of the\nnebula. From the study of the combined properties of multiple features, it is\nestablished that variations in the radial velocity are primarily caused by the\nphoto-evaporating ionization front being viewed at different angles. There is a\nprogressive increase of the electron temperature and density with decreasing\ndistance from the dominant ionizing star Theta1 Ori C. The product of these\ncharacteristics (NexTe) is the most relevant parameter in modeling a\nblister-type nebula like the Huygens Region, where this quantity should vary\nwith the surface brightness in Halpha. Several lines of evidence indicate that\nsmall-scale structure and turbulence exists down to the level of our resolution\nof a few arcseconds. Although photo-evaporative ow must contribute at some\nlevel to the well-known non-thermal broadening of the emission lines,\ncomparison of quantitative predictions with the observed optical line widths\nindicate that it is not the major additive broad- ening component. Derivation\nof Te values for H+ from radio+optical and optical-only ionized hydro- gen\nemission showed that this temperature is close to that derived from [Nii] and\nthat the transition from the well-known at extinction curve that applies in the\nHuygens Region to a more normal steep extinction curve occurs immediately\noutside of the Bright Bar feature of the nebula.\n", "  We consider a previously proposed non-extensive statistical mechanics in\nwhich the entropy depends only on the probability, this was obtained from a\nf(\\beta) distribution and its corresponding Boltzmann factor. We show that the\nfirst term correcting the usual entropy also arises from several f(\\beta)\ndistributions, we also construct the corresponding H-function and demonstrate\nthat a generalized H-theorem is fulfilled. Furthermore, expressing this\nH-function as function of the simplest Maxwellian state we find, up to a first\napproximation some modified thermodynamic quantities for an ideal gas. In order\nto gain some insight about the behavior of the proposed generalized statistics,\nwe present some simulation results for the case of a square-well and\nLennard-Jones potentials, showing that an effective repulsive interaction is\nobtained with the new formalism.\n", "  We have recently extended our ongoing survey of the local white dwarf\npopulation, effectively doubling the sample volume. Based upon the latest\ndistance determinations, Holberg et al. (2016) estimated the present 20 pc and\n25 pc samples were about 86 and 68 percent complete, respectively. Here we\nexamine how the completeness of the 25 pc sample depends upon other observables\nsuch as apparent magnitude, proper motion, photometric color index, etc. The\nresults may provide additional clues to why Sirius-Like systems are\nunderrepresented in the extended 25 pc sample and how additional nearby single\nwhite dwarf stars may be found.\n", "  Here we consider the problem of small oscillations of a rotating inviscid\nincompressible fluid.\n  From a mathematical point of view, new exact solutions to the two-dimensional\nPoincar\\'e-Sobolev equation in a class of domains including trapezoid are found\nin an explicit form and their main properties are described. These solutions\ncorrespond to the absolutely continuous spectrum of a linear operator that is\nassociated with this system of equations.\n  For specialists in Astrophysics and Geophysics the existence of these\nsolutions signifies the existence of some previously unknown type of inertial\nwaves corresponding to the continuous spectrum of inertial oscillations. A\nfundamental distinction between monochromatic inertial waves and waves of the\nnew type is shown: usual characteristics (frequency, amplitude, wave vector,\ndispersion relation, direction of energy propagation, and so on) are not\napplicable to the last. Main properties of these waves are described. In\nparticular it is proved that they are progressive. Main features of their\nenergy transfer are described. The existence of such inertial waves enables us\nto explain in a new way a lot of experimental data that were obtained in\nGeophysics in the past two decades and to predict the occurrence of such\noscillations in natural waters.\n", "  We Have developed the concept of a new kind of single-electron transistor in\nwhich the transport of the electron through a quantum wire is controlled by\ncharged quantum rings. Using a 2D harmonic potential as the transverse\nconstraint, we numerically investigated the transport of the electron through\nthe wire. We have shown that in the low energy limit, for a suitable\nconfiguration of the rings, called the quadrupole configuration, we are able to\nadjust the conductance of the wire and therefore control the switching process.\n", "  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond is a leading platform for\nnanoscale sensing and imaging, as well as quantum information processing in the\nsolid state. To date, individual control of two NV electronic spins at the\nnanoscale has been demonstrated. However, a key challenge is to scale up such\ncontrol to arrays of NV spins. Here we apply nanoscale magnetic resonance\nfrequency encoding to realize site-selective addressing and coherent control of\na four-site array of NV spins. Sites in the array are separated by 100 nm, with\neach site containing multiple NVs separated by ~15 nm. Microcoils fabricated on\nthe diamond chip provide electrically tuneable magnetic-field gradients ~0.1\nG/nm. Tailored application of gradient fields and resonant microwaves allow\nsite-selective NV spin manipulation and sensing applications, including Rabi\noscillations, imaging, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with\nnanoscale resolution. Microcoil-based magnetic resonance of solid-state spins\nprovides a practical platform for quantum-assisted sensing, quantum information\nprocessing, and the study of nanoscale spin networks.\n", "  We investigate the speed time series of the vehicles recorded by a camera at\na section of a highway in the city of Isfahan, Iran. Using $k$-means clustering\nalgorithm, we find that the natural number of clustering for this set of data\nis $3$. This is in agreement with the three-phase theory of uninterrupted\ntraffic flows. According to this theory, the three traffic phases are\ncategorized as {\\em free flow} (F), {\\em synchronized} (S) and {\\em wide moving\njam} (J). We obtain the transition speeds and densities at F-S and also S-J\ntransitions. We also apply the Shannon entropy analysis on the speed time\nseries over finite windows, which equips us to monitor in areal time the\ninstant state of a traffic flow.\n", "  The knowledge of the structure of the magnetic field inside a blazar jet, as\ndeduced from polarization observations at radio to optical wavelengths, is\nclosely related to the formation and propagation of relativistic jets that\nresult from accretion onto supermassive black holes. However, a largely\nunexplored aspect of the theoretical understanding of radiation transfer\nphysics in blazar jets has been the magnetic field geometry as revealed by the\npolarized emission and the connection between the variability in polarization\nand flux across the spectrum. Here, we explore the effects of various magnetic\ngeometries that can exist inside a blazar jet: parallel, oblique, toroidal, and\ntangled. We investigate the effects of changing the orientation of the magnetic\nfield, according to the above-mentioned geometries, on the resulting\nhigh-energy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and spectral variability\npatterns (SVPs) of a typical blazar. We use the MUlti-ZOne Radiation Feedback\n(MUZORF) model of Joshi et al. (2014) to carry out this study and to relate the\ngeometry of the field to the observed SEDs at X-ray and gamma-ray energies.\n  One of the goals of the study is to understand the relationship between\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton peaks in blazar SEDs and the reason for the\nappearance of gamma-ray \"orphan flares\" observed in some blazars. This can be\nassociated with the directionality of the magnetic field, which creates a\ndifference in the radiation field as seen by an observer versus that seen by\nthe electrons in the emission region.\n", "  Inspired by connections to two dimensional quantum theory, we define several\nmodels of computation based on permuting distinguishable particles (which we\ncall balls), and characterize their computational complexity. In the quantum\nsetting, we find that the computational power of this model depends on the\ninitial input states. More precisely, with a standard basis input state, we\nshow how to approximate the amplitudes of this model within additive error\nusing the model DQC1 (the class of problems solvable with one clean qubit),\nproviding evidence that the model in this case is weaker than universal quantum\ncomputing. However, for specific choices of input states, the model is shown to\nbe universal for BQP in an encoded sense. We use representation theory of the\nsymmetric group to partially classify the computational complexity of this\nmodel for arbitrary input states. Interestingly, we find some input states\nwhich yield a model intermediate between DQC1 and BQP. Furthermore, we consider\na restricted version of this model based on an integrable scattering problem in\n1+1 dimensions. We show it is universal under postselection, if we allow\nintermediate destructive measurements and specific input states. Therefore, the\nexistence of any classical procedure to sample from the output distribution of\nthis model within multiplicative error implies collapse of polynomial hierarchy\nto its third level. Finally, we define a classical version of this model in\nwhich one can probabilistically permute balls. We find this yields a complexity\nclass which is intermediate between L and BPP. Moreover, we find a\nnondeterministic version of this model is NP-complete.\n", "  In a uniform microresonator, the generation of a broadband Kerr frequency\ncomb is triggered by Turing patterns. Here, we study a distinctly different\nroute to initiate the Kerr frequency comb by Faraday ripples. Momentum\nconservation is ensured by azimuthal modulation of the cavity dispersion. With\na good agreement with the theoretical analysis, we demonstrate a multispectral\nKerr frequency comb covering telecommunication O, C, L, and 2 {\\mu}m bands.\nComb coherence and absence of a subcomb offset are confirmed by cw heterodyne\nbeat note and amplitude noise spectra measurements. The device can be used for\nachieving broadband optical frequency synthesizer and high-capacity coherent\ntelecommunication.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce 'public computation' as a genre of learning\nenvironments that can be used to radically broaden public participation in\nauthentic, computation-enabled STEM disciplinary practices. Our paradigmatic\napproach utilizes open source software designed for professional scientists,\nengineers and digital artists, and situates them in an undiluted form,\nalongside live and archived expert support, in a public space. We present a\ncase study of DigiPlay, a prototypical public computation space we designed at\nthe University of Calgary, where users can interact directly with scientific\nsimulations as well as the underlying open source code using an array of\nmassive multi- touch screens. We argue that in such a space, public\ninteractions with the code can be thought of as boundary work and play, through\nwhich public participation becomes legitimate scientific act, as the public\nengages in scientific creation through truly open-ended explorations with the\ncode.\n", "  Ground-based sky cameras (popularly known as Whole Sky Imagers) are\nincreasingly used now-a-days for continuous monitoring of the atmosphere. These\nimagers have higher temporal and spatial resolutions compared to conventional\nsatellite images. In this paper, we use ground-based sky cameras to detect the\nonset of rainfall. These images contain additional information about cloud\ncoverage and movement and are therefore useful for accurate rainfall nowcast.\nWe validate our results using rain gauge measurement recordings and achieve an\naccuracy of 89% for correct detection of rainfall onset.\n", "  The performance of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) polarimeter for the\nPolarimeter for Relativistic Astrophysical X-ray Sources (PRAXyS) Small\nExplorer was evaluated using polarized and unpolarized X-ray sources. The\nPRAXyS mission will enable exploration of the universe through X-ray\npolarimetry in the 2-10 keV energy band. We carried out performance tests of\nthe polarimeter at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron\nLight Source (BNL-NSLS) and at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The\npolarimeter was tested with linearly polarized, monochromatic X-rays at 11\ndifferent energies between 2.5 and 8.0 keV. At maximum sensitivity, the\nmeasured modulation factors at 2.7, 4.5 and 8.0 keV are 27%, 43% and 59%,\nrespectively and the measured angle of polarization is consistent with the\nexpected value at all energies. Measurements with a broadband, unpolarized\nX-ray source placed a limit of less than 1% on false polarization in the PRAXyS\npolarimeter.\n", "  The helicon waves exhibit varying characters depending on plasma parameters,\ngeometry, and wave numbers. Here we elucidate an intrinsic multi-scale property\nembodied by the combination of dispersive effect and nonlinearity. The extended\nmagnetohydrodynamics model (exMHD) is capable of describing wide range of\nparameter space. By using the underlying Hamiltonian structure of exMHD, we\nconstruct an exact nonlinear solution which turns out to be a combination of\ntwo distinct modes, the helicon and Trivelpiece-Gould (TG) waves. In the regime\nof relatively low frequency or high density, however, the combination is made\nof the TG mode and an ion cyclotron wave (slow wave). The energy partition\nbetween these modes is determined by the helicities carried by the wave fields.\n", "  Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a popular method for sampling\nhard-to-survey populations that leverages social network connections through\npeer recruitment. While RDS is most frequently applied to estimate the\nprevalence of infections and risk behaviors of interest to public health, like\nHIV/AIDS or condom use, it is rarely used to draw inferences about the\nstructural properties of social networks among such populations because it does\nnot typically collect the necessary data. Drawing on recent advances in\ncomputer science, we introduce a set of data collection instruments and RDS\nestimators for network clustering, an important topological property that has\nbeen linked to a network's potential for diffusion of information, disease, and\nhealth behaviors. We use simulations to explore how these estimators,\noriginally developed for random walk samples of computer networks, perform when\napplied to RDS samples with characteristics encountered in realistic field\nsettings that depart from random walks. In particular, we explore the effects\nof multiple seeds, without vs. with replacement, branching chains, imperfect\nresponse rates, preferential recruitment, and misreporting of ties. We find\nthat clustering coefficient estimators retain desirable properties in RDS\nsamples. This paper takes an important step towards calculating network\ncharacteristics using non-traditional sampling methods, and it expands RDS's\npotential to tell researchers more about hidden populations and the social\nfactors driving disease prevalence.\n", "  To suppress unwanted crosstalks between nearby optical elements, the\ndecoupling technique for integrated systems has been desired for the target\ncontrol of light flows. Although cloaking methods have enabled complete\ndecoupling of optical elements by manipulating electromagnetic waves\nmicroscopically, it is neither feasible nor necessary to control each unit\nelement in coupled systems when considering severe restrictions on material\nparameters for cloaking. Here we develop the macroscopic approach to design\ncrosstalk-free regions in coupled optical systems. By inversely designing the\neigenstate which encompasses target elements, the stable decoupling of the\nelements from the coupled system is achieved, being completely independent from\nthe random alteration of the decoupled region, and at the same time, allowing\ncoherent and scattering-free wave transport with desired spatial profiles. We\nalso demonstrate the decoupling in disordered systems, overcoming the transport\nblockade from Anderson localization. Our results provide an attractive solution\nfor 'target hiding' of elements inside coupled systems.\n", "  The explosive growth of Web 2.0, which was characterized by the creation of\nonline social networks, has reignited the study of factors that could help us\nunderstand the growth and dynamism of these networks. Various generative\nnetwork models have been proposed, including the Barabasi-Albert and\nWatts-Strogatz models. In this study, we revisit the problem from a perspective\nthat seeks to compare results obtained from these generative models with those\nfrom real networks. To this end, we consider the dating network Skout Inc. An\nanalysis is performed on the topological characteristics of the network that\ncould explain the creation of new network links. Afterwards, the results are\ncontrasted with those obtained from the Barabasi-Albert and Watts-Strogatz\ngenerative models. We conclude that a key factor that could explain the\ncreation of links originates in its cluster structure, where link\nrecommendations are more precise in Watts-Strogatz segmented networks than in\nBarabasi-Albert hierarchical networks. This result reinforces the need to\nestablish more and better network segmentation algorithms that are capable of\nclustering large networks precisely and efficiently.\n", "  The largest eigenvalue of a network provides understanding to various\ndynamical as well as stability properties of the underlying system. We\ninvestigate an interplay of inhibition and multiplexing on the largest\neigenvalue statistics of networks. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate\nthat presence of the inhibitory coupling may lead to a very different behaviour\nof the largest eigenvalue statistics of multiplex networks than those of the\nisolated networks depending upon network architecture of the individual layer.\nWe demonstrate that there is a transition from the Weibull to the Gumbel or to\nthe Frechet distribution as networks are multiplexed. Furthermore, for denser\nnetworks, there is a convergence to the Gumbel distribution as network size\nincreases indicating higher stability of larger systems.\n", "  In situ boundary arrays have been installed in the North Atlantic to measure\nthe large-scale ocean circulation. Here, we use measurements at the western\nedge of the North Atlantic at $16^\\circ$N and $26^\\circ$N to investigate\nlow-frequency variations in deep densities and their associated influence on\nocean transports. At both latitudes, deep waters (below 1100 dbar) at the\nwestern boundary are becoming fresher and less dense. The associated change in\ngeopotential thickness is about $0.15$ $\\mbox{m}^2\\mbox{s}^{-2}$ between\n2004-2009 and 2010-2014, with the shift occurring between 2009-2010 and earlier\nat $26^\\circ$N than $16^\\circ$N. Without a similar density change on the east\nof the Atlantic, a mid-depth reduction in water density at the west drives an\nincrease in the shear between the upper and lower layers of North Atlantic Deep\nWater of about 2.6 Sv at $26^\\circ$N and 3.9 Sv at $16^\\circ$N. While these\ntransport anomalies result in an intensifying tendency in the meridional\noverturning circulation (MOC) estimate at $16^\\circ$N, the method of applying a\nzero net mass transport constraint at $26^\\circ$N results in an opposing\n(reducing) tendency of the MOC.\n", "  We have detected several periodicities in the solar equatorial rotation rate\nof sunspot groups in the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results (GPR) during the\nperiod 1931-1976, the Solar Optical Observing Network (SOON) during the period\n1977-2014, and the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during the period\n1974-2014. Our results suggest a ~250-day period in the equatorial rotation\nrate determined from both the Mt. Wilson Doppler-velocity data and the\nsunspot-group data during 1986-2007. However, a wavelet analysis reveals that\nthis periodicity appears mostly around 1991 in the velocity data, while it is\npresent in most of the solar cycles covered by the sunspot-group data, mainly\nnear the minimum epochs of the solar cycles. We also found the signature of a\nperiod of ~1.4 years period in the velocity data during 1990-1995, and in the\nequatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups mostly around the year 1956. The\nequatorial rotation rate of sunspot groups reveals a strong ~1.6-year\nperiodicity around 1933 and 1955 and a weaker one around 1976, and a strong\n~1.8-year periodicity around 1943. Our analysis also suggests periodicities of\n~5 years, ~7 years, and ~17 years as well as some other short-term\nperiodicities. However, short-term periodicities are mostly present at the time\nof solar minima. Hence, short-term periodicities cannot be confirmed because of\nthe larger uncertainty in the data.\n", "  Motivated by the prospects of the potential ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ particle at\nhigh-luminosity heavy-flavor experiments, we studied the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$\n${\\to}$ $B_{c}M$ weak decays, where $M$ $=$ ${\\pi}$, ${\\rho}$, $K^{(\\ast)}$.\nThe nonfactorizable contributions to hadronic matrix elements are taken into\nconsideration with the QCDF approach. It is found that the CKM-favored\n${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\rho}$ decay has branching ratio of ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-10})$, which might be measured promisingly by the future experiments.\n", "  The characterisation of the dynamic properties of viscoelastic monolayers of\nsurfactants at the gasliquid interface is very important in the analysis and\nprediction of foam stability. With most of the relevant dynamic processes being\nrapid (thermal fluctuation, film coalescence etc.) it is important to probe\ninterfacial dynamics at high deformation rates. Today, only few techniques\nallow this, one of them being the characterisation of the propagation of\nelectrocapillary waves on the liquid surface. Traditionally, this technique has\nbeen applied in a continuous mode (i.e. at constant frequency) in order to\nensure reliable accuracy. Here we explore the possibility to analyse the\npropagation of an excited pulse in order to access the interfacial properties\nin one single Fourier treatment over a wide range of frequencies. The main\nadvantage of this approach is that the measurement times and the required\nliquid volumes can be reduced significantly. This occurs at the cost of\nprecision in the measurement, due partly to the presence of a pronounced\nresonance of the liquid surface. The pulsed approach may therefore be used to\nprescan the surface response before a more in-depth scan at constant frequency;\nor to follow the changes of the interfacial properties during surfactant\nadsorption.\n", "  A pressure-induced phase transition, associated with an increase of the\ncoordination number of In and Ta, is detected beyond 13 GPa in InTaO4 by\ncombining synchrotron x-ray diffraction and Raman measurements in a diamond\nanvil cell with ab-initio calculations. High-pressure optical-absorption\nmeasurements were also carried out. The high-pressure phase has a monoclinic\nstructure which shares the same space group with the low-pressure phase (P2/c).\nThe structure of the high-pressure phase can be considered as a slight\ndistortion of an orthorhombic structure described by space group Pcna. The\nphase transition occurs together with a unit-cell volume collapse and an\nelectronic bandgap collapse observed by experiments and calculations.\nAdditionally, a band crossing is found to occur in the low-pressure phase near\n7 GPa. The pressure dependence of all the Raman-active modes is reported for\nboth phases as well as the pressure dependence of unit-cell parameters and the\nequations of state. Calculations also provide information on IR-active phonons\nand bond distances. These findings provide insights into the effects of\npressure on the physical properties of InTaO4.\n", "  Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a THz probe pulse, we\nare able to determine spatial variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity\nwith sub-wavelength resolution (75 $\\mu m \\approx \\lambda/5$ at 0.8 THz) in a\nplanar graphene sample. We compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and\ncorrelate the existence of the spatial inhomogeneities between the two\nmeasurements. We find a strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron\ndensity. This demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in\ndoping density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices.\n", "  Dosimetry with ionization chambers in clinical ion beams for radiation\ntherapy requires correction for recombination effects. However, common\nradiation protocols discriminate between initial and general recombination and\nprovide no universal correction method for the presence of both recombination\ntypes in ion beams of charged particles heavier than protons. Here, we present\nthe open source code IonTracks, where the combined initial and general\nrecombination effects in principle can be predicted for any ion beam with\narbitrary particle-energy spectrum and temporal structure. IonTracks uses track\nstructure theory to distribute the charge carriers in ion tracks. The charge\ncarrier movements are governed by a pair of coupled differential equations,\nbased on fundamental physical properties as charge carrier drift, diffusion,\nand recombination, which are solved numerically while the initial and general\ncharge carrier recombination is computed.\n  The algorithm is numerically stable and in accordance with experimentally\nvalidated theories for initial recombination in heavy ion tracks and general\nrecombination in a proton beam.\n  IonTracks is validated against the Jaff\\'e's and Boag's theory of\nrecombination in pulsed beams of multiple ion species. IonTracks is able to\ncalculate the correction factor for initial and general recombination losses in\nparallel-plate ionization chambers. Even if only few experimental data on\nrecombination effects in ionization chambers are available today, the universal\nconcept of IonTracks is not limited to the ions investigated here. Future\nexperimental investigations of recombination in pulsed and possibly also\ncontinuous ion beams may be conducted with IonTracks, which ultimately may lead\nto a more precise prediction of recombination factors in complex radiation\nfields.\n", "  We investigate disorder relevance for the pinning of a renewal whose\ninter-arrival law has tail exponent $\\alpha>0$ when the law of the random\nenvironment is in the domain of attraction of a stable law with parameter\n$\\gamma \\in (1,2)$. We prove that in this case, the effect of disorder is not\ndecided by the sign of the specific heat exponent as predicted by Harris\ncriterion but that a new criterion emerges to decide disorder relevance. More\nprecisely we show that when $\\alpha>1-\\gamma^{-1}$ there is a shift of the\ncritical point at every temperature whereas when $\\alpha< 1-\\gamma^{-1}$, at\nhigh temperature the quenched and annealed critical point coincide, and the\ncritical exponents are identical.\n", "  Numerical experiences are reported with overlap fermions which employ the\nBrillouin action as a kernel. After discussing the dispersion relations of both\nthe kernel and the resulting chiral action, some of the physics features are\naddressed on quenched backgrounds. We find that the overlap with Brillouin\nkernel is much better localized than the overlap with Wilson kernel. Also a\npreliminary account is given of the cost of the formulation, in terms of CPU\ntime and memory.\n", "  We report on preparation dependent properties observed in monolayer WS2\nsamples synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on a variety of common\nsubstrates (Si/SiO2, sapphire, fused silica) as well as samples that were\ntransferred from the growth substrate onto a new substrate. The as-grown CVD\nmaterials (as-WS2) exhibit distinctly different optical properties than\ntransferred WS2 (x-WS2). In the case of CVD growth on Si/SiO2, following\ntransfer to fresh Si/SiO2 there is a ~50 meV shift of the ground state exciton\nto higher emission energy in both photoluminescence emission and optical\nreflection. This shift is indicative of a reduction in tensile strain by\n~0.25%. Additionally, the excitonic state in x-WS2 is easily modulated between\nneutral and charged exciton by exposure to moderate laser power, while such\noptical control is absent in as-WS2 for all growth substrates investigated.\nFinally, we observe dramatically different laser power-dependent behavior for\nas-grown and transferred WS2. These results demonstrate a strong sensitivity to\nsample preparation that is important for both a fundamental understanding of\nthese novel materials as well as reliable reproduction of device properties.\n", "  In this molecular dynamics study, we examine the local surface geometric\neffects of the normal impact force between two approximately spherical\nnanoparticles that collide in a vacuum. Three types of surface geometries,\nfacets, sharp crystal edges, and amorphous surfaces of nanoparticles with radii\nR < 10 nm are considered, and the impact force is compared with its macroscopic\ncounterpart described by a nonlinear contact force, FN proportional to D with n\n= 3/2 derived by Hertz (1881), where D is the overlap induced by elastic\ncompression. We study the surface geometry-dependent impact force. For\nfacet-facet impact, the mutual contact surface area does not expand due to the\nlarge facet surface, and this in turn leads to a non-Hertz impact force, n <\n3/2. A Hertz-like contact force, n = 1.5, is recovered in the edge contact and\nin the amorphous surface contact, allowing expansion of the mutual contact\nsurface area. The results suggest that collisions of amorphous nanoparticles or\nnanoparticles with sharp edges may maintain dynamic phenomena, such as\nbreathers and solitary waves, originating from the nonlinear contact force.\n", "  It is first shown that the scalar product on any orthogonal space (V, g)\nallows one to define linear isomorphisms of the vector spaces of bivectors and\n2-forms on V with the underlying vector spaces of the Lie algebra so(p, q) and\nits dual, respectively. When those isomorphisms are applied to the\nelectromagnetic excitation bivector and field strength 2-form, resp., one can\nassociate various algebraic constructions that pertain to them as bivector\nfields and 2-forms with corresponding constructions in terms of so(1, 3) and\nits dual. The subsequent association with corresponding things in line geometry\nwill then become straightforward. In particular, the fields can be represented\nby motors, such as screws and wrenches, while the Cartan-Killing form on so(1,\n3) is isometric to the scalar product on bivectors that gives the Klein\nquadric. When the space of bivectors (and therefore the space of 2-forms) is\ngiven an almost-complex structure (and therefore, a complex structure), one can\nalso represent most of the constructions on the former and its dual in terms of\nso(3; C) and its dual.\n", "  21cm intensity mapping is a novel approach aimed at measuring the power\nspectrum of density fluctuations and deducing cosmological information, notably\nfrom the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We give an update on the\nprogress of BAO from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO) which is a\nsingle dish intensity mapping project. First we explain the basic ideas behind\nintensity mapping concept before updating the instrument design for BINGO. We\nalso outline the survey we plan to make and its projected science output\nincluding estimates of cosmological parameters.\n", "  The computational cost of searching for new pulsars is a limiting factor for\nupcoming radio telescopes such as SKA. We introduce four new algorithms: an\noptimal constant-period search, a coherent tree search which permits optimal\nsearching with O(1) cost per model, a semicoherent search which combines\ninformation from coherent subsearches while preserving as much phase\ninformation as possible, and a hierarchical search which interpolates between\nthe coherent and semicoherent limits. Taken together, these algorithms improve\nthe computational cost of pulsar search by several orders of magnitude. In this\npaper, we consider the simple case of a constant-acceleration phase model, but\nour methods should generalize to more complex search spaces.\n", "  Optical tomographic imaging of biological specimen bases its reliability on\nthe combination of both accurate experimental measures and advanced\ncomputational techniques. In general, due to high scattering and absorption in\nmost of the tissues, multi view geometries are required to reduce diffuse halo\nand blurring in the reconstructions. Scanning processes are used to acquire the\ndata but they inevitably introduces perturbation, negating the assumption of\naligned measures. Here we propose an innovative, registration free, imaging\nprotocol implemented to image a human tumor spheroid at mesoscopic regime. The\ntechnique relies on the calculation of autocorrelation sinogram and object\nautocorrelation, finalizing the tomographic reconstruction via a three\ndimensional Gerchberg Saxton algorithm that retrieves the missing phase\ninformation. Our method is conceptually simple and focuses on single image\nacquisition, regardless of the specimen position in the camera plane. We\ndemonstrate increased deep resolution abilities, not achievable with the\ncurrent approaches, rendering the data alignment process obsolete.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) regains interest as a strategic component in\ngraphene engineering and in van der Waals heterostructures built with two\ndimensional materials. It is crucial then, to handle reliable characterization\ntechniques capable to assess the quality of structural and electronic\nproperties of the hBN material used. We present here characterization\nprocedures based on optical spectroscopies, namely cathodoluminescence and\nRaman, with the additional support of structural analysis conducted by\ntransmission electron microscopy. We show the capability of optical\nspectroscopies to investigate and benchmark the optical and structural\nproperties of various hBN thin layers sources.\n", "  Photovoltaic (PV) devices made from blends of a polyarylamine biscarbonate\nester (PABC) and [6,6]-phenyl $C_{61}$ butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) have\nbeen fabricated and characterized. PABC is a hole transporting co-polymer\nprepared from reacting\nN,N'diphenyl-N,N'bis(3-hydroxyphenyl)1,1;biphenyl(4,4'diamine), diethylene\nglycol bischloroformate, and triethylemine. By varying the polymer loading in\nthe blend, optimal power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 0.45\\%\nhas been achieved for a blend consisting of 25 wt\\% PABC, which is an order of\nmagnitude higher than the PCE for a 45 wt\\% blend. The optimal ratio is at\nabout 0.44:0.56 molar ratio of the active hole transporting to electron\ntransporting moieties. Results of mobility studies suggest that blends with\nhigher PABC loading have efficiencies limited by 'hole' transport. Also\nresponsible for the lower efficiency at higher PABC concentrations was optical\nfiltering. The efficiency does not appear to be limited by deep charge\ntrapping. Density functional theory calculations conducted pointed toward a\nstrong localization of the frontier orbitals, which might offer an explanation\nfor the low PABC hole mobility. Calculated frontier orbital energy levels found\nband gap to be consistent with the $V_{OC}$ measured.\n", "  In this paper we present a new technique for efficiently implementing Large\nEddy Simulation with the Discontin- uous Galerkin method on unstructured\nmeshes. In particular, we will focus upon the approach to overcome the\ncomputational complexity that the additional degrees of freedom in\nDiscontinuous Galerkin methods entail. The turbulence algorithms have been\nimplemented within Fluidity, an open-source computational fluid dynamics\nsolver. The model is tested with the well known backward-facing step problem,\nand is shown to concur with published results.\n", "  Advancements in nanoscale engineering of oxide interfaces and\nheterostructures have led to discoveries of emergent phenomena and new\nartificial materials. Combining the strengths of reactive molecular-beam\nepitaxy and pulsed-laser deposition, we show here, with examples of\nSr1+xTi1-xO3+delta, Ruddlesden-Popper phase Lan+1NinO3n+1 (n = 4), and\nLaAl1+yO3(1+0.5y)/SrTiO3 interfaces, that atomic layer-by-layer laser\nmolecular-beam epitaxy (ALL-Laser MBE) significantly advances the state of the\nart in constructing oxide materials with atomic layer precision and control\nover stoichiometry. With ALL-Laser MBE we have produced conducting\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces at high oxygen pressures that show no evidence of\noxygen vacancies, a capability not accessible by existing techniques. The\ncarrier density of the interfacial two-dimensional electron gas thus obtained\nagrees quantitatively with the electronic reconstruction mechanism.\n", "  To take advantage of the astrophysical potential of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nChinese and French astrophysicists have engaged the SVOM mission (Space-based\nmulti-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor). Major advances in GRB\nstudies resulting from the synergy between space and ground observations, the\nSVOM mission implements space and ground instrumentation. The scientific\nobjectives of the mission put a special emphasis on two categories of GRBs:\nvery distant GRBs at z$>$5 which constitute exceptional cosmological probes,\nand faint/soft nearby GRBs which allow probing the nature of the progenitors\nand the physics at work in the explosion. These goals have a major impact on\nthe design of the mission: the on-board hard X-ray imager is sensitive down to\n4 keV and computes on line image and rate triggers, and the follow-up\ntelescopes on the ground are sensitive in the NIR. At the beginning of the next\ndecade, SVOM will be the main provider of GRB positions and spectral parameters\non very short time scale. The SVOM instruments will operate simultaneously with\na wide range of powerful astronomical devices. This rare instrumental\nconjunction, combined with the relevance of the scientific topics connected\nwith GRB studies, warrants a remarkable scientific return for SVOM. In\naddition, the SVOM instrumentation, primarily designed for GRB studies,\ncomposes a unique multi-wavelength observatory with rapid slew capability that\nwill find multiple applications for the whole astronomy community beyond the\nspecific objectives linked to GRBs. This report lists the scientific themes\nthat will benefit from observations made with SVOM, whether they are specific\nGRB topics, or more generally all the issues that can take advantage of the\nmulti-wavelength capabilities of SVOM.\n", "  Recently we reported a series of numerical simulations proving that it is\npossible in principle to create an electronic wave packet and subsequent\nelectronic motion in a neutral molecule photoexcited by a UV pump pulse within\na few femtoseconds. We considered the ozone molecule: for this system the\nelectronic wave packet leads to a dissociation process. In the present work, we\ninvestigate more specifically the time-resolved photoelectron angular\ndistribution of the ozone molecule that provides a much more detailed\ndescription of the evolution of the electronic wave packet. We thus show that\nthis experimental technique should be able to give access to observing in real\ntime the creation of an electronic wave packet in a neutral molecule and its\nimpact on a chemical process.\n", "  We propose a correlation of local observables on many sites in macroscopic\nquantum systems. By measuring the correlation one can detect, if any,\nsuperposition of macroscopically distinct states, which we call macroscopic\nentanglement, in arbitrary quantum states that are (effectively) homogeneous.\nUsing this property, we also propose an index of macroscopic entanglement.\n"]}
