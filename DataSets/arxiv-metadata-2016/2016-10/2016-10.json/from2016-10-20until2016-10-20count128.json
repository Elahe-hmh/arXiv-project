Two approaches are\ndiscussed: increasing the deposition temperature of CdTe and the reduction of\nCdTe layer thickness. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements at low temperature\nconfirms that both methods can be used for significant reduction of QDs density\nfrom 10$^{10}$QD/cm$^2$ to 10$^7$-10$^8$QD/cm$^2$. For very low QDs density,\nidentification of all QDs lines observed in the spectrum is possible.\n", "  Combinatorial formulas for the moments of the Brownian motion on classical\ncompact Lie groups are obtained. These expressions are deformations of formulas\nof B. Collins and P. \\'Sniady for moments of the Haar measure and yield a proof\nof the First Fundamental Theorem of invariant theory and of classical\nSchur-Weyl dualities based on stochastic calculus.\n", "  In this paper, we establish a connection between zonoids (a concept from\nclassical convex geometry) and the distinguishability norms associated to\nquantum measurements, or POVMs (Positive Operator-Valued Measures), recently\nintroduced in quantum information theory.\n  This correspondence allows us to state and prove the POVM version of\nclassical results from the local theory of Banach spaces about the\napproximation of zonoids by zonotopes. We show that on $\\mathbf{C}^d$, the\nuniform POVM (the most symmetric POVM) can be sparsified, i.e. approximated by\na discrete POVM, the latter having only $O(d^2)$ outcomes. We also show that\nsimilar (but weaker) approximation results actually hold for any POVM on\n$\\mathbf{C}^d$.\n  By defining an appropriate notion of tensor product for zonoids, we are then\nable to extend our results to the multipartite setting: we show, roughly\nspeaking, that local POVMs may be sparsified locally. In particular, the local\nuniform POVM on $\\mathbf{C}^{d_1}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\mathbf{C}^{d_k}$ can be\napproximated by a discrete POVM which is local and has\n$O(d_1^2\\times\\cdots\\times d_k^2)$ outcomes.\n", "  We propose a mechanism in which two molecular knots pass through each other\nand swap positions along a polymer strand. Associated free energy barriers in\nour simulations only amount to a few $k_{B}T$, which may enable the interchange\nof knots on a single DNA strand.\n", "  We exploit the standard techniques of the supervariable approach to derive\nthe nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry\ntransformations for a toy model of the Hodge theory (i.e. a rigid rotor) and\nprovide the geometrical meaning and interpretation to them. Furthermore, we\nalso derive the nilpotent (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for this\ntheory within the framework of the above supervariable approach. We capture the\n(anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariance of the Lagrangian of our present\ntheory within the framework of augmented supervariable formalism. We also\nexpress the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST charges in terms of the\nsupervariables (obtained after the application of the (dual-)horizontality\nconditions and (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant restrictions) to\nprovide the geometrical interpretations for their nilpotency and\nanticommutativity properties. The application of the dual-horizontality\ncondition and ensuing proper (i.e. nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting)\nfermionic (anti-)co-BRST symmetries are completely novel results in our present\ninvestigation.\n", "  Our view of the low-redshift Cosmic Web has been revolutionized by galaxy\nredshift surveys such as 6dFGS, SDSS and 2MRS. However, the trade-off between\ndepth and angular coverage limits a systematic three-dimensional account of the\nentire sky beyond the Local Volume (z<0.05). In order to reliably map the\nUniverse to cosmologically significant depths over the full celestial sphere,\none must draw on multiwavelength datasets and state-of-the-art photometric\nredshift techniques. We have undertaken a dedicated program of cross-matching\nthe largest photometric all-sky surveys -- 2MASS, WISE and SuperCOSMOS -- to\nobtain accurate redshift estimates of millions of galaxies. The first outcome\nof these efforts -- the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalog (2MPZ, Bilicki et\nal. 2014a) -- has been publicly released and includes almost 1 million galaxies\nwith a mean redshift of z=0.08. Here we summarize how this catalog was\nconstructed and how using the WISE mid-infrared sample together with\nSuperCOSMOS optical data allows us to push to redshift shells of z~0.2--0.3 on\nunprecedented angular scales. Our catalogs, with ~20 million sources in total,\nprovide access to cosmological volumes crucial for studies of local galaxy\nflows (clustering dipole, bulk flow) and cross-correlations with the cosmic\nmicrowave background such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect or lensing\nstudies.\n", "  A variety of new measures of quantum Renyi mutual information and quantum\nRenyi conditional entropy have recently been proposed, and some of their\nmathematical properties explored. Here, we show that the Renyi mutual\ninformation attains operational meaning in the context of composite hypothesis\ntesting, when the null hypothesis is a fixed bipartite state and the alternate\nhypothesis consists of all product states that share one marginal with the null\nhypothesis. This hypothesis testing problem occurs naturally in channel coding,\nwhere it corresponds to testing whether a state is the output of a given\nquantum channel or of a 'useless' channel whose output is decoupled from the\nenvironment. Similarly, we establish an operational interpretation of Renyi\nconditional entropy by choosing an alternative hypothesis that consists of\nproduct states that are maximally mixed on one system. Specialized to classical\nprobability distributions, our results also establish an operational\ninterpretation of Renyi mutual information and Renyi conditional entropy.\n", "  We show that the Laplace transforms of traces of words in independant unitary\nBrownian motions converge towards an analytic function on a non trivial disc.\nThis results allow to study asymptotics of Wilson loops under the unitary\nYang-Mills measure on the plane. The limiting objects obtained are shown to be\ncharacterized by equations analog to Schwinger-Dyson's ones, named here after\nMakeenko and Migdal.\n", "  We propose a first principles effective medium formalism to study the\npropagation of electron waves in semiconductor heterostructures with a\nzero-band gap. Our theory confirms that near the K-point the dynamics of a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas modulated by an external electrostatic potential\nwith honeycomb symmetry is described by the same pseudospinor formalism and\nDirac massless equation as a graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we highlight that\neven though other superlattices based on semiconductors with a zincblende-type\nstructure can have a zero band-gap and a linear energy-momentum dispersion, the\ncorresponding effective medium Hamiltonian is rather different from that of\ngraphene, and can be based on a single-component wavefunction.\n", "  Finite width of the analog event horizon is determined by the nonlinearity\nlength in the Kerr nonlinear optical system, which is discussed here, or by the\nhealing length in Bose-Einstein condensates. The various eigen modes of\nfluctuations are found in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon and the\nscattering matrix due to the finite width horizon is calculated to within the\nleading order correction in the nonlinearity length. The Hawking radiation is\nfound to be that of a grey body with the emissivity larger than one. A\nprocedure of paraxial quantization of the fluctuation field is discussed and\nits connection to the conventional quantization of the electromagnetic field is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  I review the nature of three-dimensional collapse in the Zeldovich\napproximation, how it relates to the underlying nature of the three-dimensional\nLagrangian manifold and naturally gives rise to a hierarchical structure\nformation scenario that progresses through collapse from voids to pancakes,\nfilaments and then halos. I then discuss how variations of the Zeldovich\napproximation (based on the gravitational or the velocity potential) have been\nused to define classifications of the cosmic large-scale structure into\ndynamically distinct parts. Finally, I turn to recent efforts to devise new\napproaches relying on tessellations of the Lagrangian manifold to follow the\nfine-grained dynamics of the dark matter fluid into the highly non-linear\nregime and both extract the maximum amount of information from existing\nsimulations as well as devise new simulation techniques for cold collisionless\ndynamics.\n", "  In the effective theory of isoscalar and isovector dark matter-nucleon\ninteractions mediated by a heavy spin-1 or spin-0 particle, 8 isotope-dependent\nnuclear response functions can be generated in the dark matter scattering by\nnuclei. We compute the 8 nuclear response functions for the 16 most abundant\nelements in the Sun, i.e. H, $^{3}$He, $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C, $^{14}$N, $^{16}$O,\n$^{20}$Ne, $^{23}$Na, $^{24}$Mg, $^{27}$Al, $^{28}$Si, $^{32}$S, $^{40}$Ar,\n$^{40}$Ca, $^{56}$Fe, and $^{58}$Ni, through numerical shell model\ncalculations. We use our response functions to compute the rate of dark matter\ncapture by the Sun for all isoscalar and isovector dark matter-nucleon\neffective interactions, including several operators previously considered for\ndark matter direct detection only. We study in detail the dependence of the\ncapture rate on specific dark matter-nucleon interaction operators, and on the\ndifferent elements in the Sun. We find that a so far neglected momentum\ndependent dark matter coupling to the nuclear vector charge gives a larger\ncontribution to the capture rate than the constant spin-dependent interaction\ncommonly included in dark matter searches at neutrino telescopes. Our\ninvestigation lays the foundations for model independent analyses of dark\nmatter induced neutrino signals from the Sun. The nuclear response functions\nobtained in this study are listed in analytic form in an appendix, ready to be\nused in other projects.\n", "  The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are\ncoherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a\nsuppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We analyze the\ncase when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap,\nwhich is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the\nLPM effect in QCD. Previous authors have analyzed this problem in the case of\noverlapping double bremsstrahlung where at least one of the bremsstrahlung\ngluons is soft. Here we show how to generalize to include the case where both\nsplittings are hard. A number of techniques must be developed, and so in this\npaper we simplify by (i) restricting attention to a subset of the interference\neffects, which we call the \"crossed\" diagrams, and (ii) working in the\nlarge-$N_c$ limit. We first develop some general formulas that could in\nprinciple be implemented numerically (with substantial difficulty). To make\nmore analytic progress, we then focus on the case of a thick, homogeneous\nmedium and make the multiple scattering approximation (also known as the $\\hat\nq$ or harmonic approximation) appropriate at high energy. We show that the\ndifferential rate $d\\Gamma/dx\\,dy$ for overlapping double bremsstrahlung of\ngluons with momentum fractions $x$ and $y$ can then be reduced to the\ncalculation of a 1-dimensional integral, which we perform numerically. [Though\nthis paper is unfortunately long, our introduction is enough for getting the\ngist of the method.]\n", "  Despite extensive theoretical \\cite{GanterPRL1998,\nElliotPRL2001,SchirmacherPRL2007, TanakaNatureM2008, MonacoPNAS2009,\nMarruzzoSCIRP2013} and experimental studies \\cite{ChumakovPRL2011,\nChumakovPRL2014, KayaScience2010,KChenPRL2010, LXuPRL2012, BonnPreprint2014}, a\nlongstanding puzzle in condensed matter physics remains regarding the origin\nand nature of \"Boson peak\" (BP), where the vibrational density of states (DOS)\nin glasses possesses an excess of states compared with the crystalline\ncounterpart. Here we show that BP is successfully observed in 2D hexagonal\ngranular packing, where the disorder is due to the force network, i.e. the\nspatial heterogeneity of elasticity \\cite{MarruzzoSCIRP2013}. Using\nphoto-elastic techniques \\cite{TrushNature2005}, the disordered particle\ninteraction can be precisely measured to resolve the origin and nature of BP\nfor the first time in a real scenario. We discover the structures of DOS of\ndisordered crystals reminiscent of the corresponding perfect crystals, which is\nconsistent with the recent studies in $SiO_2$\\cite{ChumakovPRL2014} and in\ndisordered gels\\cite{LorenzoGelPaper2011}, notwithstanding the drastically\ndifferent systems. Moreover, we propose a mechanism to clarify that BP is not\nmerely a broadened and shifted van Hove singularity \\cite{ElliotPRL2001,\nChumakovPRL2011} but instead it is due to an interplay of the mesoscopic\nscreening effect and the microscopic elasticity disorder -- causing,\nrespectively, the broadening and the attenuation of the first and the second\nvan Hove singularity. This may lead to an in-depth understanding of BP in\nstructure glasses.\n", "  The Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex - a pigment protein complex involved\nin photosynthesis in green sulfur bacteria - is remarkably efficient in\ntransferring excitation energy from light harvesting antenna molecules to a\nreaction center. Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that\nquantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy\ntransfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property\nthat expresses a stronger-than-entanglement form of correlation, exists between\ndifferent pairs of chromophores in the FMO complex when modeling the EET by the\nhierarchically coupled equations of motion method. We compare the results for\nnonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In\nparticular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by\ndifferent initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only\nexists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and\nprobably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural\nhabitat. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement behave quite\ndifferently in this system. In particular, for localized initial states,\nnonlocality only exists on a very short time scale and then drops to zero in an\nabrupt manner. As already known from previous studies, quantum entanglement\nbetween chromophore pairs on the other hand is oscillating and exponentially\ndecaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore\npopulation dynamics. The abrupt disappearance of nonlocality in the presence of\nnonvanishing entanglement is a phenomenon we call nonlocality sudden death; a\nstriking manifestation of the difference between these two types of\ncorrelations in quantum systems.\n", "  We constrain the effective theory of one-body dark matter-nucleon\ninteractions using neutrino telescope observations. We derive exclusion limits\non the 28 coupling constants of the theory, exploring interaction operators\npreviously considered in dark matter direct detection only, and using new\nnuclear response functions recently derived through nuclear structure\ncalculations. We determine for what interactions neutrino telescopes are\nsuperior to current direct detection experiments, and show that Hydrogen is not\nthe most important element in the exclusion limit calculation for the majority\nof the spin-dependent operators.\n", "  The idea of detecting the entanglement of a given bipartite state by\nsearching for symmetric extensions of this state was first proposed by Doherty,\nParrilo and Spedialeri. The complete family of separability tests it generates,\noften referred to as the hierarchy of $k$-extendibility tests, has already\nproved to be most promising. The goal of this paper is to try and quantify the\nefficiency of this separability criterion in typical scenarios. For that, we\nessentially take two approaches. First, we compute the average width of the set\nof $k$-extendible states, in order to see how it scales with the one of\nseparable states. And second, we characterize when random-induced states are,\ndepending on the ancilla dimension, with high probability violating or not the\n$k$-extendibility test, and compare the obtained result with the corresponding\none for entanglement vs separability. The main results can be precisely phrased\nas follows: on $\\mathbf{C}^d\\otimes\\mathbf{C}^d$, when $d$ grows, the average\nwidth of the set of $k$-extendible states is equivalent to $(2/\\sqrt{k})/d$,\nwhile random states obtained as partial traces over an environment\n$\\mathbf{C}^s$ of uniformly distributed pure states are violating the\n$k$-extendibility test with probability going to $1$ if $s<((k-1)^2/4k)d^2$.\nBoth statements converge to the conclusion that, if $k$ is fixed,\n$k$-extendibility is asymptotically a weak approximation of separability, even\nthough any of the other well-studied separability relaxations is outperformed\nby $k$-extendibility as soon as $k$ is above a certain (dimension independent)\nvalue.\n", "  Starting from an unjammed initial state, applying shear to a granular\nmaterial of a fixed packing fraction below $\\phi_J$, i.e. the isotropic jamming\ndensity of frictionless spheres can produce shear jamming states, as have been\ndiscovered recently. In addition, it has also been discovered that the system\nwill first experience a bulk fragile state before evolving into a shear jammed\nstate. Due to the existence of friction between the system and the third\ndimension in the previous studies, it is unclear whether such fragile state\nwould still exist on the route to shear jamming if the friction with the third\ndimension were completely eliminated and the background noise level were\ngreatly reduced. Using a novel apparatus, we have completely eliminated the\nfriction between particles and the third dimension by floating the particles on\nthe surface of a shallow water layer thus revealing more details of the route\nof shear-jamming. We are able to measure weak boundary pressure of three orders\nof magnitude below the resolution of the photo-elastic method through the\ncombination force-gauges of high sensitivity and a cantilever-like simple-beam\napparatus. In a system with weak cohesion, we have indeed observed the bulk\nfragile states before the shear jamming; in addition, we have also discovered\nthe boundary fragile states and regimes of negligible shear modus compared to\nbulk modulus. Most importantly, we now have a much better understanding of the\nbulk fragile state: its existence requires an auxiliary in some form, e.g. the\nweak cohesion in this experiment. By constructing a way to freely tune down the\ncohesion to more than six orders of magnitude smaller, to our surprise, we have\ndiscovered the complete vanishing of the bulk fragile states, which thus allows\nus to determine the plausible origin of the bulk fragile state.\n", "  The centrality dependence of pseudorapidity density of charged particles and\ntransverse energy is studied for a wide range of collision energies for\nheavy-ion collisions at midrapidity from 7.7 GeV to 5.02 TeV. A two-component\nmodel approach has been adopted to quantify the soft and hard components of\nparticle production, coming from nucleon participants and binary\nnucleon-nucleon collisions, respectively. Within experimental uncertainties,\nthe hard component contributing to the particle production has been found not\nto show any clear collision energy dependence from RHIC to LHC. The effect of\ncentrality and collision energy in particle production seem to factor out with\nsome degree of dependency on the collision species. The collision of\nUranium-like deformed nuclei opens up new challenges in understanding the\nenergy-centrality factorization, which is evident from the centrality\ndependence of transverse energy density, when compared to collision of\nsymmetric nuclei.\n", "  The temperature evolution of icosahedral medium-range order formed by\ninterpenetrating icosahedra in CuZr metallic glass-forming liquids was\ninvestigated via molecular dynamics simulations. Scaling analysis based on\npercolation theory was employed, and it is found that the size distribution of\nclusters formed by the central atoms of icosahedra at various temperatures\nfollows a very good scaling law with the cluster number density scaled by\n$S^{-\\tau}$ and the cluster size $S$ scaled by $|1-T_c/T|^{-1/\\sigma}$,\nrespectively. Here $T_c$ is scaling crossover-temperature. $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$\nare scaling exponents. The critical scaling behaviour suggests that there would\nbe a structural phase transition manifested by percolation of locally favoured\nstructures underlying the glass transition, if the liquid could be cooled\nslowly enough but without crystallization intervening. Furthermore, it is\nrevealed that when icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) extends to medium-range\nlength scale by connection, the atomic configurations of ISROs will be\noptimized from distorted ones towards more regular ones gradually, which\nsignificantly lowers the energies of ISROs and introduces geometric frustration\nsimultaneously. Both factors make key impacts on the drastic dynamic slowdown\nof supercooled liquids. Our findings provide direct structure-property\nrelationship for understanding the nature of glass transition.\n", "  We compare the measured angular cross-correlation between the Fermi-LAT\ngamma-ray sky and catalogues of extra-galactic objects with the expected signal\ninduced by weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM). We\ninclude a detailed description of the contribution of astrophysical gamma-ray\nemitters such as blazars, misaligned AGN and star forming galaxies, and perform\na global fit to the measured cross-correlation. Five catalogues are considered:\nSDSS-DR6 quasars, 2MASS galaxies, NVSS radio galaxies, SDSS-DR8 Luminous Red\nGalaxies and SDSS-DR8 main galaxy sample. To model the cross-correlation signal\nwe use the halo occupation distribution formalism to estimate the number of\ngalaxies of a given catalogue in DM halos and their spatial correlation\nproperties. We discuss uncertainties in the predicted cross-correlation signal\narising from the DM clustering and WIMP microscopic properties, which set the\nDM gamma-ray emission. The use of different catalogues probing objects at\ndifferent redshifts reduces significantly, though not completely, the\ndegeneracy among the different gamma-ray components. We find that the presence\nof a significant WIMP DM signal is allowed by the data but not significantly\npreferred by the fit, although this is mainly due to a degeneracy with the\nmisaligned AGN component. With modest substructure boost, the sensitivity of\nthis method excludes thermal annihilation cross sections at 95% C.L. for WIMP\nmasses up to few tens of GeV. Constraining the low-redshift properties of\nastrophysical populations with future data will further improve the sensitivity\nto DM.\n", "  We present observable lower bounds for several bipartite entanglement\nmeasures including entanglement of formation, geometric measure of\nentanglement, concurrence, convex-roof extended negativity, and G-concurrence.\nThe lower bounds facilitate estimates of these entanglement measures for\narbitrary finite-dimensional bipartite states. Moreover, these lower bounds can\nbe calculated analytically from the expectation value of a single observable.\nBased on our results, we use several real experimental measurement data to get\nlower bounds of entanglement measures for these experimentally realized states.\nIn addition, we also study the relations between entanglement measures.\n", "  We have studied the existence of topological self-dual configurations in a\nnonminimal CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating (LV) Maxwell-Higgs model, where the LV\ninteraction is introduced by modifying the minimal covariant derivative. The\nBogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield formalism has been implemented, revealing that\nthe scalar self-interaction implying self-dual equations contains a derivative\ncoupling. The CPT-odd self-dual equations describe electrically neutral\nconfigurations with finite total energy proportional to the total magnetic\nflux, which differ from the charged solutions of other CPT-odd and LV models\npreviously studied. In particular, we have investigated the axially symmetrical\nself-dual vortex solutions altered by the LV parameter. For large distances,\nthe profiles possess general behavior similar to the vortices of\nAbrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen. However, within the vortex core, the profiles of the\nmagnetic field and energy can differ substantially from ones of the\nMaxwell-Higgs model depending if the LV parameter is negative or positive.\n", "  The capacity to confine light into a small region of space is of paramount\nimportance in many areas of modern science. Here, we suggest a mechanism to\nstore a quantized \"bit\" of light - with a very precise amount of energy - in an\nopen core-shell plasmonic structure (\"meta-atom\") with a nonlinear optical\nresponse. Notwithstanding the trapped light state is embedded in the radiation\ncontinuum, its lifetime is not limited by the radiation loss. Interestingly, it\nis shown that the interplay between the nonlinear response and volume plasmons\nenables breaking fundamental reciprocity restrictions, and coupling very\nefficiently an external light source to the meta-atom. The collision of an\nincident optical pulse with the meta-atom may be used to release the trapped\nradiation \"bit\".\n", "  Quantum effects derived through conformal anomaly lead to an inflationary\nmodel that can be either stable or unstable. The unstable version requires a\nlarge dimensionless coefficient of about $5\\times 10^8$ in front of the $R^2$\nterm that results in the inflationary regime in the $R+R^2$ (\"Starobinsky\")\nmodel being a generic intermediate attractor. In this case the non-local terms\nin the effective action are practically irrelevant, and there is a 'graceful\nexit' to a low curvature matter-like dominated stage driven by high-frequency\noscillations of $R$ -- scalarons, which later decay to pairs of all particles\nand antiparticles, with the amount of primordial scalar (density) perturbations\nrequired by observations. The stable version is a genuine generic attractor, so\nthere is no exit from it. We discuss a possible transition from stable to\nunstable phases of inflation. It is shown that this transition is automatic if\nthe sharp cut-off approximation is assumed for quantum corrections in the\nperiod of transition. Furthermore, we describe two different quantum mechanisms\nthat may provide a required large $\\,R^2$-term in the transition period.\n", "  We study the spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in Pt grown $\\textit{in situ}$\non CoFe$_2$O$_4$ (CFO) ferrimagnetic insulating (FMI) films. A careful analysis\nof the angle-dependent and field-dependent longitudinal magnetoresistance\nindicates that the SMR contains a contribution that does not follow the bulk\nmagnetization of CFO but it is a fingerprint of the complex magnetism at the\nsurface of the CFO layer, thus signaling SMR as a tool for mapping surface\nmagnetization. A systematic study of the SMR for different temperatures and CFO\nthicknesses gives us information impossible to obtain with any standard\nmagnetometry technique. On one hand, surface magnetization behaves\nindependently of the CFO thickness and does not saturate up to high fields,\nevidencing that the surface has its own anisotropy. On the other hand,\ncharacteristic zero-field magnetization steps are not present at the surface\nwhile they are relevant in the bulk, strongly suggesting that antiphase\nboundaries are the responsible of such intriguing features. In addition, a\ncontribution from ordinary magnetoresistance of Pt is identified, which is only\ndistinguishable due to the low resistivity of the $\\textit{in-situ}$ grown Pt.\n", "  The electronic and structural properties of Li$B$O$_3$ ($B$=V, Nb, Ta, Os)\nare investigated via first-principles methods. We show that Li$B$O$_3$ belong\nto the recently proposed hyperferroelectrics, i.e., they all have unstable\nlongitudinal optic phonon modes. Especially, the ferroelectric-like instability\nin the metal LiOsO$_3$, whose optical dielectric constant goes to infinity, is\na limiting case of hyperferroelectrics. Via an effective Hamiltonian, we\nfurther show that, in contrast to normal proper ferroelectricity, in which the\nferroelectric instability usually comes from long-range coulomb interactions,\nthe hyperferroelectric instability is due to the structure instability driven\nby short-range interactions. This could happen in systems with large ion size\nmismatches, which therefore provides a useful guidance in searching for novel\nhyperferroelectrics.\n", "  A new exact vacuum solution in five dimensions, which describes a magnetized\ncylindrical wormhole in $3+1$ dimensions is presented. The magnetic field lines\nare stretched along the wormhole throat and are concentrated near to it.\n  We study the motion of neutral and charged test particles under the influence\nof the magnetized wormhole. The effective potential for a neutral test particle\naround and across the magnetized wormhole has a repulsive character. The\ngravitational lensing for the magnetized wormhole for various lens parameters\nare calculated and compared. The total magnetic flux on either side of the\nwormhole is obtained.\n  We present analytic expressions which show regions in which the null energy\ncondition is violated.\n", "  In typical discrete-time quantum walk algorithms, one measures the position\nof the walker while ignoring its internal spin/coin state. Rather than\nneglecting the information in this internal state, we show that additionally\nmeasuring it doubles the success probability of many quantum spatial search\nalgorithms. For example, this allows Grover's unstructured search problem to be\nsolved with certainty, rather than with probability 1/2 if only the walker's\nposition is measured, so the additional measurement yields a search algorithm\nthat is twice as fast as without it, on average. Thus the internal state of\ndiscrete-time quantum walks holds valuable information that can be utilized to\nimprove algorithms. Furthermore, we determine conditions for which spatial\nsearch problems on regular graphs are amenable to this doubling of the success\nprobability, and this involves diagrammatically analyzing search using\ndegenerate perturbation theory and deriving a useful formula for how the\nquantum walk acts in its reduced subspace.\n", "  We present a TeV scale seesaw mechanism for exploring the dark matter and\nneutrino phenomenology in the light of recent neutrino and cosmology data. A\ndifferent realization of the Inverse seesaw(ISS) mechanism with $A_{4}$ flavor\nsymmetry is being implemented as a leading contribution to the light neutrino\nmass matrix which usually gives rise to vanishing reactor mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. Using a non-diagonal form of Dirac neutrino mass matrix and\n$3\\sigma$ values of mass square differences we parameterize the neutrino mass\nmatrix in terms of Dirac Yukawa coupling \"$y$\". We then use type II seesaw as a\nperturbation which turns out to be active to have a non-vanishing reactor\nmixing angle without much disturbing the other neutrino oscillation parameters.\nThen we constrain a common parameter space satisfying the non-zero\n$\\theta_{13}$, Yukawa coupling and the relic abundance of dark matter.\nContributions of neutrinoless double beta decay are also included for standard\nas well as non-standard interaction. This study may have relevance in future\nneutrino and Dark Matter experiments.\n", "  With the developed \"extended Monte Calro\" (EMC) algorithm, we have studied\nthe depinning transition in Ising-type lattice models by extensive numerical\nsimulations, taking the random-field Ising model with a driving field and the\ndriven bond-diluted Ising model as examples. In comparison with the usual Monte\nCarlo method, the EMC algorithm exhibits greater efficiency of the simulations.\nBased on the short-time dynamic scaling form, both the transition field and\ncritical exponents of the depinning transition are determined accurately via\nthe large-scale simulations with the lattice size up to L = 8 912,\nsignificantly refining the results in earlier literature. In the\nstrong-disorder regime, a new universality class of the Ising-type lattice\nmodel is unveiled with the exponents {\\beta} = 0.304(5), {\\nu} = 1.32(3), z =\n1.12(1), and {\\zeta} = 0.90(1), quite different from that of the quenched\nEdwards-Wilkinson equation.\n", "  We study extensions of N-wave systems with PT-symmetry. The types of\n(nonlocal) reductions leading to integrable equations invariant with respect to\nP- (spatial reflection) and T- (time reversal) symmetries is described. The\ncorresponding constraints on the fundamental analytic solutions and the\nscattering data are derived. Based on examples of 3-wave (related to the\nalgebra sl(3,C)) and 4-wave (related to the algebra so(5,C)) systems, the\nproperties of different types of 1- and 2-soliton solutions are discussed. It\nis shown that the PT symmetric 3-wave equations may have regular multi-soliton\nsolutions for some specific choices of their parameters.\n", "  We report the excitation energy dependence of specific heat (\\cv) of hadronic\nmatter at freeze-out in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at the Relativistic Heavy\nIon Collider energies by analyzing the published data on event-by-event mean\ntransverse momentum (\\meanpt) distributions. The \\meanpt~distributions in\nfinite \\pt~ranges are converted to distributions of effective temperatures, and\ndynamical fluctuations in temperature are extracted by subtracting widths of\nthe corresponding mixed event distributions. The heat capacity per particle at\nthe kinetic freeze-out surface is presented as a function of collision energy,\nwhich shows a sharp rise in \\cv~below \\sNN~=~62.4~GeV. We employ the Hadron\nResonance Gas (HRG) model to estimate \\cv~at the chemical and kinetic\nfreeze-out surfaces. The experimental results are compared to the HRG and other\ntheoretical model calculations. HRG results show good agreement with data.\nModel predictions for \\cv~at the Large Hadron Collider energy are presented.\n", "  In electron transport, the tunnelling time is the time taken for an electron\nto tunnel out of a system after it has tunnelled in. We define the tunnelling\ntime distribution for quantum processes in a dissipative environment and\ndevelop a practical approach for calculating it, where the environment is\ndescribed by the general Markovian master equation. We illustrate the theory by\nusing the rate equation to compute the tunnelling time distribution for\nelectron transport through a molecular junction. The tunnelling time\ndistribution is exponential, which indicates that Markovian quantum tunnelling\nis a Poissonian statistical process. The tunnelling time distribution is used\nnot only to study the quantum statistics of tunnelling along the average\nelectric current but also to analyse extreme quantum events where an electron\njumps against the applied voltage bias. The average tunnelling time shows\ndistinctly different temperature dependance for p- and n-type molecular\njunction and therefore provides a sensitive tool to probe the alignment of\nmolecular orbitals relative to the electrode Fermi energy.\n", "  In large quantum systems multipartite entanglement can be found in many\ninequivalent classes under local operations and classical communication.\nPreparing states of arbitrary size in different classes is important for\nperforming a wide range of quantum protocols. W states, in particular,\nconstitute a class with a variety of quantum networking protocols. However, all\nknown schemes for preparing W states are probabilistic, with resource\nrequirements increasing at least sub-exponentially. We propose a deterministic\nscheme for preparing W states that requires no prior entanglement and can be\nperformed locally. We introduce an all-optical setup that can efficiently\nprepare W states of arbitrary size. Our scheme advances the use of W states in\nreal-world quantum networks and could be extended to other physical systems.\n", "  We consider scalar two-dimensional quantum field theories with the\nfactorizing S-matrix which has poles in the physical strip. In our previous\nwork, we introduced the bound state operators and constructed candidate\noperators for observables in wedges.\n  Under some additional assumptions on the S-matrix, we show that, in order to\nobtain their strong commutativity, it is enough to prove the essential\nself-adjointness of the sum of the left and right bound state operators. This\nessential self-adjointness is shown up to the two-particle component.\n", "  The gate fidelity and the coherence time of a qubit are important benchmarks\nfor quantum computation. We construct a qubit using a single electron spin in a\nSi/SiGe quantum dot and control it electrically via an artificial spin-orbit\nfield from a micromagnet. We measure an average single-qubit gate fidelity of\n$\\approx$ 99$\\%$ using randomized benchmarking, which is consistent with\ndephasing from the slowly evolving nuclear spins in substrate. The coherence\ntime measured using dynamical decoupling extends up to $\\approx$ 400 $\\mu$s for\n128 decoupling pulses, with no sign of saturation. We find evidence that the\ncoherence time is limited by noise in the 10 kHz $-$ 1 MHz range, possibly\nbecause charge noise affecting the spin via the micromagnet gradient. This work\nshows that an electron spin in a Si/SiGe quantum dot is a good candidate for\nquantum information processing as well as for a quantum memory, even without\nisotopic purification.\n", "  In the present paper, we study the defocusing complex short pulse (CSP)\nequations both geometrically and algebraically. From the geometric point of\nview, we establish a link of the complex coupled dispersionless (CCD) system\nwith the motion of space curves in Minkowski space $\\mathbf{R}^{2,1}$, then\nwith the defocusing CSP equation via a hodograph (reciprocal) transformation,\nthe Lax pair is constructed naturally for the defocusing CSP equation. We also\nshow that the CCD system of both the focusing and defocusing types can be\nderived from the fundamental forms of surfaces such that their curve flows are\nformulated. In the second part of the paper, we derive the the defocusing CSP\nequation from the single-component extended KP hierarchy by the reduction\nmethod. As a by-product, the $N$-dark soliton solution for the defocusing CSP\nequation in the form of determinants for these equations is provided.\n", "  We explore effects of the screening due to the relativistic electron-positron\nplasma and presence of resonances in the secondary reactions leading to A=7\nnuclei during the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In particular, we investigate and\nexamine possible low-lying resonances in the $^7$Be($^3$He, $\\gamma$)$^{10}$C\nreaction and examine the resultant destruction of $^7$Be for various resonance\nlocations and strengths. While a resonance in the $^{10}$C compound nucleus is\nthought to have negligible effects we explore the possibility of an enhancement\nfrom plasma screening that may adjust the final $^7$Be abundance. We find the\neffects of relativistic screening and possible low-lying resonances to be\nrelatively small in the standard Early Universe models.\n", "  In this paper we consider quantum walks whose evolution converges to the\nDirac equation one in the limit of small wave-vectors. We show exact Fast\nFourier implementation of the Dirac quantum walks in one, two and three space\ndimensions. The behaviour of particle states, defined as states smoothly peaked\nin some wave-vector eigenstate of the walk, is described by an approximated\ndispersive differential equation that for small wave-vectors gives the usual\nDirac particle and antiparticle kinematics. The accuracy of the approximation\nis provided in terms of a lower bound on the fidelity between the exactly\nevolved state and the approximated one. The jittering of the position operator\nexpectation value for states having both a particle and an antiparticle\ncomponent is analytically derived and observed in the numerical\nimplementations.\n", "  We calculate the Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) signature\nof the Resonant Excitonic State (RES) that was proposed as the Pseudo-Gap state\nof cuprate superconductors [ArXiv 1510.03038]. This new state can be described\nas a set of excitonic (particle-hole) patches with an internal checkerboard\nmodulation. Here, we modelize the RES as a charge order with $\\bf{2p_{F}}$ wave\nvectors, where $\\bf{2p_{F}}$ is the ordering vector connecting two opposite\nsides of the Fermi surface. We calculate the spectral weight and the density of\nstates in the RES and we find that our model correctly reproduces the opening\nof the PG in Bi-2201.\n", "  In the face of serious infectious diseases, governments endeavour to\nimplement containment measures such as public vaccination at a macroscopic\nlevel. Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts\nwith infections at a microscopic level. However, a comprehensive understanding\nof how such combined strategy influences epidemic dynamics is still lacking. We\nstudy a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect\nvaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is\nrepresented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic\nprotection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from\ninfective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in\npopulations without and then with demographic effects. Using the pairwise\napproximation and the probability generating function approach, we investigate\nboth dynamics of the epidemic and the underlying network. For populations\nwithout demography, the emerging degree correlations, bistable states, and\noscillations demonstrate the combined effects of the public vaccination program\nand individual protective behavior. Compared to either strategy in isolation,\nthe combination of public vaccination and individual protection is more\neffective in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases by\nincreasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold. For\npopulations with additional demographic factors, the integration between\nvaccination intervention and individual rewiring may promote epidemic spreading\ndue to the birth effect. Moreover, the degree distributions of both networks in\nthe steady state is closely related to the degree distribution of newborns,\nwhich leads to uncorrelated connectivity. All the results demonstrate the\nimportance of both local protection and global intervention, as well as the\ndemographic effects.\n", "  Measurements of the top--antitop quark pair production charge asymmetry in\nthe dilepton channel, characterized by two high-${p}_{\\rm{T}}$ leptons\n(electrons or muons), are presented using data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of $20.3$ $\\textrm{fb}^{-1}$ from $pp$ collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector\nat the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Inclusive and differential measurements\nas a function of the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and longitudinal\nboost of the $t\\bar{t}$ system are performed both in the full phase space and\nin a fiducial phase space closely matching the detector acceptance. Two\nobservables are studied: $A^{\\ell\\ell}_{\\textrm{C}}$ based on the selected\nleptons and $A^{t\\bar{t}}_{\\textrm{C}}$ based on the reconstructed $t\\bar{t}$\nfinal state. The inclusive asymmetries are measured in the full phase space to\nbe $A^{\\ell\\ell}_{\\textrm{C}} = 0.008 \\pm 0.006$ and $A^{t\\bar{t}}_{\\textrm{C}}\n= 0.021 \\pm 0.016$, which are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions\nof $A^{\\ell\\ell}_{\\textrm{C}} = 0.0064 \\pm 0.0003 $ and\n$A^{t\\bar{t}}_{\\textrm{C}} = 0.0111 \\pm 0.0004$.\n", "  We study the gauged U(1)_{B-L} extensions of the models for neutrino masses\nand dark matter. In this class of models, tiny neutrino masses are radiatively\ninduced through the loop diagrams, while the origin of the dark matter\nstability is guaranteed by the remnant of the gauge symmetry. Depending on how\nthe lepton number is violated in the neutrino mass diagrams, these models are\nsystematically classified. We present a complete list for the one-loop Z_2 and\nthe two-loop Z_3 neutrino mass models as examples of the classification. These\nunderlying gauge symmetries and its breaking patterns can be probed at future\nhigh energy colliders by looking at the width of the new gauge boson.\n", "  Universal quantum computation requires high fidelity single qubit rotations\nand controlled two qubit gates. Along with high fidelity single qubit gates,\nstrong efforts have been made in developing robust two qubit logic gates in\nelectrically-gated quantum dot systems to realize a compact and\nnano-fabrication-compatible architecture. Here, we perform measurements of\nstate-conditional coherent oscillations of a charge qubit. Using a quadruple\nquantum dot formed in a Si/SiGe heterostructure, we show the first\ndemonstration of coherent two-axis control of a double quantum dot charge qubit\nin undoped Si/SiGe, performing Larmor and Ramsey oscillation measurements. We\nextract the strength of the capacitive coupling between double quantum dots by\nmeasuring the detuning energy shift ($\\approx$ 75 $\\mu$eV) of one double dot\ndepending on the excess charge configuration of the other double dot. We\nfurther demonstrate that the strong capacitive coupling allows fast conditional\nLandau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferences with conditonal $\\pi$ phase flip time\nabout 80 ps, showing promising pathways toward multi-qubit entanglement control\nin semiconductor quantum dots.\n", "  We consider Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection in a layer of fluid between rough\nno-slip boundaries where the top and bottom boundary heights are functions of\nthe horizontal coordinates with square-integrable gradients. We use the\nbackground method to derive an upper bound on mean heat flux across the layer\nfor all admissible boundary geometries. This flux, normalized by the\ntemperature difference between the boundaries, can grow with the Rayleigh\nnumber ($Ra$) no faster than ${\\cal O}(Ra^{1/2})$ as $Ra \\rightarrow \\infty$.\nOur analysis yields a family of similar bounds, depending on how various\nestimates are tuned, but every version depends explicitly on the boundary\ngeometry. In one version the coefficient of the ${\\cal O}(Ra^{1/2})$ leading\nterm is $0.242 + 2.925\\Vert\\nabla h\\Vert^2$, where $\\Vert\\nabla h\\Vert^2$ is\nthe mean squared magnitude of the boundary height gradients. Application to a\nparticular geometry is illustrated for sinusoidal boundaries.\n", "  We study effects of charge self-consistency within the combination of density\nfunctional theory (DFT; Wien2k) with dynamical mean field theory (DMFT;\nw2dynamics) in a basis of maximally localized Wannier orbitals. Using the\nexample of two cuprates, we demonstrate that even if there is only a single\nWannier orbital with fixed filling, a noteworthy charge redistribution can\noccur. This effect stems from a reoccupation of the Wannier orbital in k-space\nwhen going from the single, metallic DFT band to the split, insulating Hubbard\nbands of DMFT. We analyze another charge self-consistency effect beyond moving\ncharge from one site to another: the correlation-enhanced orbital polarization\nin a freestanding layer of SrVO3.\n", "  The process $e^{+}e^{-}\\to \\eta^{\\prime} J/\\psi$ is observed for the first\ntime with a statistical significance of $8.6\\sigma$ at center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s} = 4.226$ GeV and $7.3\\sigma$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 4.258$ GeV using data\nsamples collected with the BESIII detector. The Born cross sections are\nmeasured to be $(3.7 \\pm 0.7 \\pm 0.3)$ and $(3.9 \\pm 0.8 \\pm 0.3)$ pb at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 4.226$ and $4.258$ GeV, respectively, where the first errors are\nstatistical and the second systematic. Upper limits at the 90% confidence level\nof the Born cross sections are also reported at other 12 energy points.\n", "  Cerium (Ce)-based heavy-fermion materials have a characteristic double-peak\nstructure (mid-IR peak) in the optical conductivity [$\\sigma(\\omega)$] spectra\noriginating from the strong conduction ($c$)--$f$ electron hybridization. To\nclarify the behavior of the mid-IR peak at a low $c$-$f$ hybridization\nstrength, we compared the $\\sigma(\\omega)$ spectra of the isostructural\nantiferromagnetic and heavy-fermion Ce compounds with the calculated unoccupied\ndensity of states and the spectra obtained from the impurity Anderson model.\nWith decreasing $c$-$f$ hybridization intensity, the mid-IR peak shifts to the\nlow-energy side owing to the renormalization of the unoccupied $4f$ state, but\nsuddenly shifts to the high-energy side owing to the $f$-$f$ on-site Coulomb\ninteraction at a slight localized side from the quantum critical point (QCP).\nThis finding gives us information on the change in the electronic structure\nacross QCP.\n", "  We extend the impact parameter dependent Glasma model (IP-Glasma) to three\ndimensions using explicit small x evolution of the two incoming nuclear gluon\ndistributions. We compute rapidity distributions of produced gluons and the\nearly time energy momentum tensor as a function of space-time rapidity and\ntransverse coordinates. We study rapidity correlations and fluctuations of the\ninitial geometry and multiplicity distributions and compare to existing models\nfor the three dimensional initial state.\n", "  We propose a dual-pump third-order nonlinear scheme for producing pairs of\ncorrelated photons that is less susceptible to Raman noise than typical\nspontaneous four wave mixing methods (SFWM). Beginning with the full multimode\nHamiltonian we derive a general expression for the joint spectral amplitude,\nfrom which the probability of producing a pair of photons can be calculated. As\nan example, we demonstrate that a probability of 0.028 pairs per pulse can be\nachieved in an appropriately designed fused silica microfiber. As compared with\nsingle pump SFWM in standard fiber, we calculate that our process shows\nsignificant suppression of the spontaneous Raman scattering and an improvement\nin the signal to noise ratio.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new Green's function embedding method called\nPEXSI-$\\Sigma$ for describing complex systems within the Kohn-Sham density\nfunctional theory (KSDFT) framework, after revisiting the physics literature of\nGreen's function embedding methods from a numerical linear algebra perspective.\nThe PEXSI-$\\Sigma$ method approximates the density matrix using a set of nearly\noptimally chosen Green's functions evaluated at complex frequencies. For each\nGreen's function, the complex boundary conditions are described by a self\nenergy matrix $\\Sigma$ constructed from a physical reference Green's function,\nwhich can be computed relatively easily. In the linear regime, such treatment\nof the boundary condition can be numerically exact. The support of the $\\Sigma$\nmatrix is restricted to degrees of freedom near the boundary of computational\ndomain, and can be interpreted as a frequency dependent surface potential. This\nmakes it possible to perform KSDFT calculations with $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$\ncomputational complexity, where $N$ is the number of atoms within the\ncomputational domain. Green's function embedding methods are also naturally\ncompatible with atomistic Green's function methods for relaxing the atomic\nconfiguration outside the computational domain. As a proof of concept, we\ndemonstrate the accuracy of the PEXSI-$\\Sigma$ method for graphene with\ndivacancy and dislocation dipole type of defects using the DFTB+ software\npackage.\n", "  The di-photon excess observed at the LHC can be explained as a Standard Model\nsinglet that is produced and decays by heavy vector-like colour triplets and\nelectroweak doublets in one-loop diagrams. The characteristics of the required\nspectrum are well motivated in heterotic-string constructions that allow for a\nlight $Z^\\prime$. Anomaly cancellation of the $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ symmetry\nrequires the existence of the Standard Model singlet and vector-like states in\nthe vicinity of the $U(1)_{Z^\\prime}$ breaking scale. In this paper we show\nthat the agreement with the gauge coupling data at one-loop is identical to the\ncase of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, owing to cancellations\nbetween the additional states. We further show that effects arising from heavy\nthresholds may push the supersymmetric spectrum beyond the reach of the LHC,\nwhile maintaining the agreement with the gauge coupling data. We show that the\nstring inspired model can indeed account for the observed signal and discuss\nthe feasibility of obtaining viable scalar mass spectrum.\n", "  We introduce a new coarse grain model capable of describing the phase\nbehavior of two dimensional ferromagnetic systems with competing exchange and\ndipolar interactions, as well as an external magnetic field. An improved\nexpression for the mean field entropic contribution allows to compute the phase\ndiagram in the whole temperature versus external field plane. We find that the\ntopology of the phase diagram may be qualitatively different depending on the\nratio between the strength of the competing interactions. In the regime\nrelevant for ultrathin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular anisotropy we\nconfirm the presence of inverse symmetry breaking from a modulated phase to a\nhomogenous one as the temperature is lowered at constant magnetic field, as\nreported in experiments. For other values of the competing interactions we show\nthat reentrance may be absent. Comparing thermodynamic quantities in both\ncases, as well as the evolution of magnetization profiles in the modulated\nphases, we conclude that the reentrant behavior is a consequence of the\nsuppression of domain wall degrees of freedom at low temperatures at constant\nfields.\n", "  A model is proposed in which the light r-process element enrichment in\nmetal-poor stars is explained via enrichment from a truncated r-process, or\n\"tr-process.\" The truncation of the r-process from a generic core-collapse\nevent followed by a collapse into an accretion-induced black hole is examined\nin the framework of a galactic chemical evolution model. The constraints on\nthis model imposed by observations of extremely metal-poor stars are explained,\nand the upper limits in the [Sr/Ba] distributions are found to be related to\nthe nuclear equation of state in a collapse scenario. The scatter in [Sr/Ba]\nand [Sr/Eu] as a function of metallicity has been found to be consistent with\nturbulent ejection in core collapse supernovae. Adaptations of this model are\nevaluated to account for the scatter in isotopic observables. This is done by\nassuming mixing in ejecta in a supernova event.\n", "  A nonperturbative interaction of an electronic system with a laser field can\nsubstantially modify its physical properties. In particular, in two-dimensional\n(2D) materials with a lack of inversion symmetry, the achievement of a regime\nof strong light-matter coupling allows direct optical tuning of the strength of\nthe Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Capitalizing on these results, we\nbuild a theory of the dynamical conductivity of a 2D electron gas with both\nRashba and Dresselhaus SOIs coupled to an off-resonant high-frequency\nelectromagnetic wave. We argue that strong light-matter coupling modifies\nqualitatively the dispersion of the electrons and can be used as a powerful\ntool to probe and manipulate the coupling strengths and adjust the frequency\nrange where optical conductivity is essentially nonzero.\n", "  The viability of quantum communication schemes rely on sending quantum states\nof light over long distances. However, transmission loss can degrade the signal\nstrength, adding noise. Heralded noiseless amplification of a quantum signal\ncan provide a solution by enabling longer direct transmission distances and by\nenabling entanglement distillation. The central idea of heralded noiseless\namplification---a conditional modification of the probability distribution over\nphoton number of an optical quantum state---is suggestive of a parallel with\nweak measurement: in a weak measurement, learning partial information about an\nobservable leads to a conditional back-action of a commensurate size. Here we\nexperimentally investigate the application of weak, or variable-strength,\nmeasurements to the task of heralded amplification, by using a quantum logic\ngate to weakly couple a small single-optical-mode quantum state (the signal) to\nan ancilla photon (the meter). The weak measurement is carried out by choosing\nthe measurement basis of the meter photon and, by conditioning on the meter\noutcomes, the signal is amplified. We characterise the gain of the amplifier as\na function of the measurement strength, and use interferometric methods to show\nthat the operation preserves the coherence of the signal.\n", "  We discuss some infinite matter properties of two finite-range interactions\nwidely used for nuclear structure calculations, namely Gogny and M3Y\ninteractions. We show that some useful informations can be deduced for the\ncentral, tensor and spin-orbit terms from the spin-isospin channels and the\npartial wave decomposition of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state.\nWe show in particular that the central part of the Gogny interaction should\nbenefit from the introduction of a third Gaussian and the tensor parameters of\nboth interactions can be deduced from special combinations of partial waves. We\nalso discuss the fact that the spin-orbit of the M3Y interaction is not\ncompatible with local gauge invariance. Finally, we show that the zero-range\nlimit of both families of interactions coincides with the specific form of the\nzero-range N3LO Skyrme interaction and we emphasize from this analogy the\nbenefits of N3LO.\n", "  The family of hole-doped Pr-based perovskite cobaltites,\nPr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoO$_{3}$ and\n(Pr$_{1-y}$RE$_{y}$)$_{0.3}$Ca$_{0.7}$CoO$_{3}$ (where RE is rare earth) has\nrecently been found to exhibit simultaneous metal-insulator, spin-state, and\nvalence transitions. We have investigated magnetic-field-induced phase\ntransitions of (Pr$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_{3}$ by means of\nmagnetization measurements at 4.2$-$100 K up to an ultrahigh magnetic field of\n140 T with the chemical pressure varied by $y$ = 0.0625, 0.075, 0.1. The\nobserved magnetic-field-induced transitions were found to occur simultaneously\nwith the metal-insulator transitions up to 100 T. The obtained magnetic\nfield-temperature ($B$-$T$) phase diagram and magnetization curves are well\nanalyzed by a spin-crossover model of a single ion with interion interactions.\nOn the other hand, the chemical pressure dependence of the experimentally\nobtained magnetization change during the phase transition disagrees with the\nsingle ion model when approaching low temperatures. The significant $y$\ndependence of the magnetization change at low temperatures may arise from the\nitinerant magnetism of Co$^{3+}$ in the paramagnetic metallic phase, where the\nchemical pressure enhances the exchange splitting by promoting the\ndouble-exchange interaction. The observed $B$-$T$ phase diagrams of\n(Pr$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_{3}$ are quite contrary to that of\nLaCoO$_{3}$, indicating that in (Pr$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$)$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$CoO$_{3}$\nthe high-field phase possesses higher entropy than the low-field phase, whereas\nit is the other way around in LaCoO$_{3}$.\n", "  In this paper, we describe in detail a scheme for the construction of highly\naccurate numerical solutions to Einstein's field equations in five and six\nspacetime dimensions corresponding to non-uniform black strings. The scheme\nconsists of a sophistically adapted multi-domain pseudo-spectral method which\nincorporates a detailed understanding of the solution's behavior at the domain\nboundaries and at critical points. In particular, the five-dimensional case is\nexceedingly demanding as logarithmic terms appear which need to be treated with\nspecial care. The scheme resolves these issues and permits the investigation of\nunprecedentedly strong deformations of the black string horizon. As a\nconsequence, we are able to study in detail the critical regime in phase\ndiagrams displaying characteristic thermodynamic quantities such as mass and\nentropy. Our results show typical spiral curves in such diagrams which provides\na strong support of previous numerical works.\n", "  In conventional s-wave superconductors, only magnetic impurities exhibit\nimpurity bound states, whereas for an s+- order parameter they can occur for\nboth magnetic and non-magnetic impurities. Impurity bound states in\nsuperconductors can thus provide important insight into the order parameter.\nHere, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study of native and\nengineered iron-site defects in LiFeAs. Detailed comparison of tunneling\nspectra measured on impurities with spin fluctuation theory reveals a\ncontinuous evolution from negligible impurity bound state features for weaker\nscattering potential to clearly detectable states for somewhat stronger\nscattering potentials. All bound states for these intermediate strength\npotentials are pinned at or close to the gap edge of the smaller gap, a\nphenomenon that we explain and ascribe to multi-orbital physics.\n", "  We report on the direct mapping of electron transfer in the momentum space of\nbulk MoS$_2$ by means of time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoemission with\na high-harmonic probe. For this purpose, we have combined a high-repetition\nrate high-harmonic source with tunable femtosecond pump pulses and a 3D ($k_x,\nk_y, E$) electron spectrometer. We show that optical excitation slightly above\nthe A exciton resonance results in an immediate occupation of the conduction\nband at $\\overline{K}$ followed by an ultrafast transfer ($< 50$~fs) to the\nconduction band minimum at $\\overline{\\Sigma}$. Both signals, at $\\overline{K}$\nand $\\overline{\\Sigma}$, do not vanish over the observed period of 400~fs. The\ntechnique described here enables direct access to the charge transfer dynamics\nin $k$-space and allows the study of decay times and decay channels in various\nsystems with dependence on the excess energy or helicity of the excitation.\n", "  We study the magnetic and electronic phases of a 1D magnetic adatom chain on\na 2D superconductor. In particular, we confirm the existence of a\n`self-organized' 1D topologically non-trivial superconducting phase within the\nset of subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states formed along the magnetic chain.\nThis phase is stabilized by incommensurate spiral correlations within the\nmagnetic chain that arise from the competition between short-range\nferromagnetic and long-range antiferromagnetic electron-induced exchange\ninteractions, similar to a recent study for a 3D superconductor [M. Schecter et\nal. Phys. Rev. B 93, 140503(R) 2016]. The exchange interaction along diagonal\ndirections are also considered and found to display behavior similar to a 1D\nsubstrate when close to half filling. We show that the topological phase\ndiagram is robust against local superconducting order parameter suppression and\nweak substrate spin-orbit coupling. Lastly, we study the effect of a direct\nferromagnetic exchange coupling between the adatoms, and find the region of\nspiral order in the phase diagram to be significantly enlarged in a wide range\nof the direct exchange coupling.\n", "  We study the growth of entanglement entropy(EE) of local operator excitation\nin the quantum Lifshitz model which has dynamic exponent z = 2. Specifically,\nwe act a local vertex operator on the groundstate at a distance $l$ to the\nentanglement cut and calculate the EE as a function of time for the state's\nsubsequent time evolution. We find that the excess EE compared with the\ngroundstate is a monotonically increasing function which is vanishingly small\nbefore the onset at $t \\sim l^2$ and eventually saturates to a constant\nproportional to the scaling dimension of the vertex operator. The\nquasi-particle picture can interpret the final saturation as the exhaustion of\nthe quasi-particle pairs, while the diffusive nature of the time scale $t \\sim\nl^2$ replaces the common causality constraint in CFT calculation. To further\nunderstand this property, we compute the excess EE of a small disk probe far\nfrom the excitation point and find chromatography pattern in EE generated by\nquasi-particles of different propagation speeds.\n", "  Recent experiments have revealed nonlinear features of the magnetoresistance\nin metallic bilayers consisting of a heavy-metal (HM) and a ferromagnetic metal\n(FM). A small change in the lon- gitudinal resistance of the bilayer has been\nobserved when reversing the direction of either the applied in-plane current or\nthe magnetization. We attribute such nonlinear transport behavior to the\nspin-polarization dependence of the electron mobility in the FM layer acting in\nconcert with the spin accumulation induced in that layer by the spin Hall\ncurrent originating in the bulk of the HM layer. An explicit expression for the\nnonlinear magnetoresistance is derived based on a simple drift-diffusion model,\nwhich shows that the nonlinear magnetoresistance appears at the first order of\nspin Hall angle (SHA), and changes sign when the current is reversed, in\nagreement with the experimental observations. We also discuss possible ways to\ncontrol the sign of the nonlinear magnetoresistance and to enhance the\nmagnitude of effect.\n", "  Optical clocks with unprecedented accuracy of 10^(-18) will lead to\ninnovations in many research areas. All the applications of optical clocks rely\non the ability of precisely converting the frequency from one optical clock to\nanother, or particularly to the frequencies in the fiber telecom band for\nlong-distance transmission. Here, we report a low-noise, high precision optical\nfrequency divider. It can realize accurate optical frequency conversion as well\nas enable precise measurement of optical frequency ratios. By comparing against\nthe frequency ratio between the fundamental and the second harmonic of a 1064\nnm laser rather than a second similar system, the optical frequency divider is\ndemonstrated to have a frequency division instability of 6e-19 at 1 s and a\nfractional frequency division uncertainty of 1.4e-21, nearly three orders of\nmagnitude better than the most accurate optical clocks. It allows optical\nclocks to be accessible to many precision measurement applications.\n", "  Most existing star-galaxy classifiers use the reduced summary information\nfrom catalogs, requiring careful feature extraction and selection. The latest\nadvances in machine learning that use deep convolutional neural networks allow\na machine to automatically learn the features directly from data, minimizing\nthe need for input from human experts. We present a star-galaxy classification\nframework that uses deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) directly on\nthe reduced, calibrated pixel values. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS),\nwe demonstrate that ConvNets are able to produce accurate and well-calibrated\nprobabilistic classifications that are competitive with conventional machine\nlearning techniques. Future advances in deep learning may bring more success\nwith current and forthcoming photometric surveys, such as the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), because deep\nneural networks require very little, manual feature engineering.\n", "  In the literature, there are numerous studies of one-dimensional\ndiscrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) using a moving shift operator. However,\nthere is no exact solution for the limiting probability distributions of DTQWs\non cycles using a general coin or swapping shift operator. In this paper, we\nderive exact solutions for the limiting probability distribution of quantum\nwalks using a general coin and swapping shift operator on cycles for the first\ntime. Based on the exact solutions, we show how to generate symmetric quantum\nwalks and determine the condition under which a symmetric quantum walk appears.\nOur results suggest that choosing various coin and initial state parameters can\nachieve a symmetric quantum walk. By defining a quantity to measure the\nvariation of symmetry, deviation and mixing time of symmetric quantum walks are\nalso investigated.\n", "  Context: Resonances in the stellar orbital motion under perturbations from\nspiral arms structure play an important role in the evolution of the disks of\nspiral galaxies. The epicyclic approximation allows the determination of the\ncorresponding resonant radii on the equatorial plane (for nearly circular\norbits), but is not suitable in general.\n  Aims: We expand the study of resonant orbits by analysing stellar motions\nperturbed by spiral arms with Gaussian-shaped profiles without any restriction\non the stellar orbital configurations, and we expand the concept of Lindblad\n(epicyclic) resonances for orbits with large radial excursions.\n  Methods: We define a representative plane of initial conditions, which covers\nthe whole phase space of the system. Dynamical maps on representative planes\nare constructed numerically, in order to characterize the phase-space structure\nand identify the precise location of resonances. The study is complemented by\nthe construction of dynamical power spectra, which provide the identification\nof fundamental oscillatory patterns in the stellar motion.\n  Results: Our approach allows a precise description of the resonance chains in\nthe whole phase space, giving a broader view of the dynamics of the system when\ncompared to the classical epicyclic approach, even for objects in retrograde\nmotion. The analysis of the solar neighbourhood shows that, depending on the\ncurrent azimuthal phase of the Sun with respect to the spiral arms, a star with\nsolar kinematic parameters may evolve either inside the stable co-rotation\nresonance or in a chaotic zone.\n  Conclusions: Our approach contributes to quantifying the domains of resonant\norbits and the degree of chaos in the whole Galactic phase-space structure. It\nmay serve as a starting point to apply these techniques to the investigation of\nclumps in the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, such as kinematic moving\ngroups.\n", "  We review the uncertainties in high-z star-formation rate (SFR) measures and\nthe constraints that one obtains from high-z gamma-ray burst (GRB) rates on\nthem. We show that at the present time, the GRB rates per unit star-formation\nat z>3 are higher than at lower redshift. We also compare metallicity\npredictions made using a hierarchical model of cosmic chemical evolution based\non two recently proposed SFRs, one based on the observed galaxy luminosity\nfunction at high redshift and one based on the GRB rate and find that within\nthe considerable scatter in metal abundance measures, they both are consistent\nwith the data. Analyzing the ensemble of different measurements together, we\nconclude that despite metallicity biases, GRBs may be a less biased probe of\nstar-formation at z>3 than at z<2. There is likely to be a common origin to the\nhigh GRB rate per unit star-formation and the high observed Lyman-continuum\nproduction rate in high redshift galaxies and that this may be due to a\nrelative overabundance of stars with mass $>$25Msun which are likely GRB\nprogenitors. We also find that to reconcile these measurements with the Thomson\nscattering cross section of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons measured\nby Planck, the escape fraction of Lyman-continuum photons from galaxies must be\nlow, about 15 percent or less and that the clumping factor of the IGM is likely\nto be small, about 3. Finally, we demonstrate that GRBs are unique probes of\nmetallicity evolution in low-mass galaxy samples and that GRB hosts likely lost\na significant fraction of metals to the intergalactic medium (IGM) due to\nfeedback processes such as stellar winds and supernovae.\n", "  In a two-dimensional electron system, microwave radiation may induce giant\nresistance oscillations. Their origin has been debated controversially and\nnumerous mechanisms based on very different physical phenomena have been\ninvoked. However none of them have been unambiguously experimentally\nidentified, since they produce similar effects in transport studies. The\ncapacitance of a two-subband system is sensitive to a redistribution of\nelectrons over energy states, since it entails a shift of the electron charge\nperpendicular to the plane. In such a system microwave induced\nmagnetocapacitance oscillations have been observed. They can only be accounted\nfor by an electron distribution function oscillating with energy due to Landau\nquantization, one of the quantum mechanisms proposed for the resistance\noscillations.\n", "  When magnons and phonons, the fundamental quasiparticles of the solid, are\ncoupled to one another, they form a new hybrid quasi-particle, leading to novel\nphenomena and interesting applications. Despite its wide-ranging importance,\nhowever, detailed experimental studies on the underlying Hamiltonian is rare\nfor actual materials. Moreover, the anharmonicity of such magnetoelastic\nexcitations remains largely unexplored although it is essential for a proper\nunderstanding of their diverse thermodynamic behaviour as well as intrinsic\nzero-temperature decay. Here we show that in noncollinear antiferromagnets, a\nstrong magnon-phonon coupling can significantly enhance the anharmonicity,\nresulting in the creation of magnetoelastic excitations and their spontaneous\ndecay. By measuring the spin waves over the full Brillouin zone and carrying\nout anharmonic spin wave calculations using a Hamiltonian with an explicit\nmagnon-phonon coupling, we have identified a hybrid magnetoelastic mode in\n(Y,Lu)MnO3 and quantified its decay rate and the exchange-striction coupling\nterm required to produce it. Our work has wide implications for understanding\nof the spin-phonon coupling and the resulting excitations of the broad classes\nof noncollinear magnets.\n", "  A viewpoint-article comment on asymptotic iteration method.\n", "  We have theoretically investigated the electronic properties of neutral and\n$n$-doped dangling bond (DB) quasi-one-dimensional structures (lines) in the\nSi(001):H and Ge(001):H substrates with the aim of identifying atomic-scale\ninterconnects exhibiting metallic conduction for use in on-surface circuitry.\nWhether neutral or doped, DB lines are prone to suffer geometrical distortions\nor have magnetic ground-states that render them semiconducting. However, from\nour study we have identified one exception -- a dimer row fully stripped of\nhydrogen passivation. Such a DB-dimer line shows an electronic band structure\nwhich is remarkably insensitive to the doping level and, thus, it is possible\nto manipulate the position of the Fermi level, moving it away from the gap.\nTransport calculations demonstrate that the metallic conduction in the DB-dimer\nline can survive thermally induced disorder, but is more sensitive to imperfect\npatterning. In conclusion, the DB-dimer line shows remarkable stability to\ndoping and could serve as a one-dimensional metallic conductor on $n$-doped\nsamples.\n", "  The simultaneous presence of two competing inter-particle interactions can\nlead to the emergence of new phenomena in a many-body system. Among others,\nsuch effects are expected in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, subject to\ndipole-dipole interaction and short-range repulsion. Magnetic quantum gases and\nin particular Dysprosium gases, offering a comparable short-range contact and a\nlong-range dipolar interaction energy, remarkably exhibit such emergent\nphenomena. In addition an effective cancellation of mean-field effects of the\ntwo interactions results in a pronounced importance of quantum-mechanical\nbeyond mean-field effects. For a weakly-dominant dipolar interaction the\nstriking consequence is the existence of a new state of matter equilibrated by\nthe balance between weak mean-field attraction and beyond mean-field repulsion.\nThough exemplified here in the case of dipolar Bose gases, this state of matter\nshould appear also with other microscopic interactions types, provided a\ncompetition results in an effective cancellation of the total mean-field. The\nmacroscopic state takes the form of so-called quantum droplets. We present the\neffects of a long-range dipolar interaction between these droplets.\n", "  We consider thick domain walls in a de Sitter universe following paper by\nBasu and Vilenkin. However, we are interested not only in stationary solutions\nfound therein, but also investigate the general case of domain wall evolution\nwith time. When the wall thickness parameter, $\\delta_0$, is smaller than\n$H^{-1}/\\sqrt{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter in de Sitter space-time,\nthen the stationary solutions exist, and initial field configurations tend with\ntime to the stationary ones. However, there are no stationary solutions for\n$\\delta_0 \\geq H^{-1}/\\sqrt{2}$. We have calculated numerically the rate of the\nwall expansion in this case and have found that the width of the wall grows\nexponentially fast for $\\delta_0 \\gg H^{-1}$. An explanation for the critical\nvalue $\\delta_{0c} = H^{-1}/\\sqrt{2}$ is also proposed.\n", "  An accurate line list, VOMYT, of spectroscopic transitions is presented for\nhot VO. The 13 lowest electronic states are considered. Curves and couplings\nare based on initial {\\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations and then\ntuned using available experimental data. Dipole moment curves, used to obtain\ntransition intensities, are computed using high levels of theory (e.g.\nMRCI/aug-cc-pVQZ using state-specific or minimal-state CAS for dipole moments).\nThis line list contains over 277 million transitions between almost 640,000\nenergy levels. It covers the wavelengths longer than 0.29 $\\mu$m and includes\nall transitions from energy levels within the lowest nine electronic states\nwhich have energies less than 20,000 \\cm{} to upper states within the lowest 13\nelectronic states which have energies below 50,000 \\cm{}. The line lists give\nsignificantly increased absorption at infrared wavelengths compared to\ncurrently available VO line lists. The full line lists is made available in\nelectronic form via the CDS database and at www.exomol.com.\n", "  The uniqueness issue of SDE decomposition theory proposed by Ao and his\nco-workers has recently been discussed. A comprehensive study to investigate\nconnections among different landscape theories [J. Chem. Phys. 144, 094109\n(2016)] has pointed out that the decomposition is generally not unique, while\nAo et al. (arXiv:1603.07927v1) argues that such conclusions are \"incorrect\"\nbecause of the missing boundary conditions. In this comment, we will combine\nliteratures research and concrete examples to show that the concrete and\neffective boundary conditions have not been proposed to guarantee the\nuniqueness, hence the arguments in [arXiv:1603.07927v1] are not sufficient.\nMoreover, we show that the \"uniqueness\" of the O-U process decomposition\nreferred by YTA paper is unable to serve as a counterexample to ZL's result\nsince additional assumptions have been made implicitly beyond the original SDE\ndecomposition framework, which cannot be applied to general nonlinear cases.\nSome other issues such as the failure of gradient expansion method will also be\ndiscussed. Our demonstration contributes to better understanding of the\nrelevant papers as well as the SDE decomposition theory.\n", "  It is shown that for every multidimensional metric in the multiply warped\nproduct form $\\bar{M} = K\\times_{f_1} M_1\\times_{f_2}M_2$ with warp functions\n$f_1$, $f_2$, associated to the submanifolds $M_1$, $M_2$ of dimensions $n_1$,\n$n_2$ respectively, one can find the corresponding Einstein equations\n$\\bar{G}_{AB}=-\\bar{\\Lambda}\\bar{g}_{AB}$, with cosmological constant\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}$, which are reducible to the Einstein equations $G_{\\alpha\\beta}\n= -\\Lambda_1 g_{\\alpha\\beta}$ and $G_{ij} =-\\Lambda_2 h_{ij}$ on the\nsubmanifolds $M_1$, $M_2$, with cosmological constants ${\\Lambda_1}$ and\n${\\Lambda_2}$, respectively, where $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, ${\\Lambda_1}$ and\n${\\Lambda_2}$ are functions of ${f_1}$, ${f_2}$ and $n_1$, $n_2$.\n", "  Starting from the Dirac-Kohn-Sham equation we derive the relativistic\nequation of motion of spin angular momentum in a magnetic solid under an\nexternal electromagnetic field. This equation of motion can be written in the\nform of the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for a harmonic external\nmagnetic field, and leads to a more general magnetization dynamics equation for\na general time-dependent magnetic field. In both cases with an electronic\nspin-relaxation term which stems from the spin-orbit interaction. We thus\nrigorously derive, from fundamental principles, a general expression for the\nanisotropic damping tensor which is shown to contain an isotropic Gilbert\ncontribution as well as an anisotropic Ising-like and a chiral,\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like contribution. The expression for the spin relaxation\ntensor comprises furthermore both electronic interband and intraband\ntransitions. We also show that when the externally applied electromagnetic\nfield possesses spin angular momentum, this will lead to an optical spin torque\nexerted on the spin moment.\n", "  Parker's magnetostatic theorem extended to astrophysical magnetofluids with\nlarge magnetic Reynolds number supports ceaseless regeneration of current\nsheets and hence, spontaneous magnetic reconnections recurring in time.\nConsequently, a scenario is possible where the repeated reconnections provide\nan autonomous mechanism governing emergence of coherent structures in\nastrophysical magnetofluids. In this work, such a scenario is explored by\nperforming numerical computations commensurate with the magnetostatic theorem.\nIn particular, the computations explore the evolution of a flux-rope governed\nby repeated reconnections in a magnetic geometry resembling bipolar loops of\nsolar corona. The revealed morphology of the evolution process, including onset\nand ascent of the rope, reconnection locations and the associated topology of\nthe magnetic field lines, agrees with observations, and thus substantiates\nphysical realisability of the advocated mechanism.\n", "  We present a method to determine the proton-to-helium ratio in cosmic rays at\nultra-high energies. It makes use of the exponential slope, $\\Lambda$, of the\ntail of the $X_{\\rm max}$ distribution measured by an air shower experiment.\nThe method is quite robust with respect to uncertainties from modeling hadronic\ninteractions and to systematic errors on $X_{\\rm max}$ and energy, and to the\npossible presence of primary nuclei heavier than helium. Obtaining the\nproton-to-helium ratio with air shower experiments would be a remarkable\nachievement.\n  To quantify the applicability of a particular mass-sensitive variable for\nmass composition analysis despite hadronic uncertainties we introduce as a\nmetric the `analysis indicator' and find an improved performance of the\n$\\Lambda$ method compared to other variables currently used in the literature.\nThe fraction of events in the tail of the $X_{\\rm max}$ distribution can\nprovide additional information on the presence of nuclei heavier than helium in\nthe primary beam.\n", "  Close to charge neutrality, the low-energy properties of high-quality\nsuspended devices based on atomically thin graphene layers are determined by\nelectron-electron interactions. Bernal-stacked layers, in particular, have\nshown a remarkable even-odd effect with mono- and tri-layers remaining gapless\nconductors, and bi- and tetra-layers becoming gapped insulators. These\nobservations $-$at odds with the established notion that (Bernal) trilayers and\nthicker multilayers are semi-metals$-$ have resulted in the proposal of a\nphysical scenario leading to a surprising prediction, namely that even-layered\ngraphene multilayers remain insulating irrespective of their thickness. Here,\nwe present data from two devices that conform ideally to this hypothesis,\nexhibiting the behavior expected for Bernal-stacked hexa and octalayer\ngraphene. Despite their large thickness, these multilayers are insulating for\ncarrier density |n|<2-3x10$^{10}$cm$^{-2}$, possess an energy gap of\napproximately 1.5 meV at charge neutrality (in virtually perfect agreement with\nwhat is observed in bi and tetra layer graphene) and exhibit the expected\ninteger quantum Hall effect. These findings indicate the soundness of our basic\ninsights on the effect of electron interactions in Bernal graphene multilayers,\nshow that graphene multilayers exhibit unusual and interesting physics that\nremains to be understood, and pose ever more pressing questions as to the\nmicroscopic mechanisms behind the semimetallic behavior of bulk graphite.\n", "  Stability of inviscid shear shallow water flows with free surface is studied\nin the framework of the Benney equations. This is done by investigating the\ngeneralized hyperbolicity of the integrodifferential Benney system of\nequations. It is shown that all shear flows having monotonic convex velocity\nprofiles are stable. The hydrodynamic approximations of the model corresponding\nto the classes of flows with piecewise linear continuous and discontinuous\nvelocity profiles are derived and studied. It is shown that these\napproximations possess Hamiltonian structure and a complete system of Riemann\ninvariants, which are found in an explicit form. Sufficient conditions for\nhyperbolicity of the governing equations for such multilayer flows are\nformulated. The generalization of the above results to the case of stratified\nfluid is less obvious, however, it is established that vorticity has a\nstabilizing effect.\n", "  A simple analytical model of a layered system comprised of a single passage\nof a serpentine flow channel and a parallel underlying porous electrode (or\nporous layer) is proposed. This analytical model is derived from Navier-Stokes\nmotion in the flow channel and Darcy-Brinkman model in the porous layer. The\ncontinuities of flow velocity and normal stress are applied at the interface\nbetween the flow channel and the porous layer. The effects of the inlet\nvolumetric flow rate, thickness of the flow channel and thickness of a typical\ncarbon fiber paper porous layer on the volumetric flow rate within this porous\nlayer are studied. The maximum current density based on the electrolyte\nvolumetric flow rate is predicted, and found to be consistent with reported\nnumerical simulation. It is found that, for a mean inlet flow velocity of 33.3\ncm s-1, the analytical maximum current density is estimated to be 377 mA cm-2,\nwhich compares favorably with experimental result reported by others of ~400 mA\ncm-2.\n", "  In order to investigate the carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the young open cluster\nM45 (Pleiades), the C and O abundances of selected 32 F-G type dwarfs (in the\neffective temperature range of Teff~5800-7600K and projected rotational\nvelocity range of vesini~10-110km/s) belonging to this cluster were determined\nby applying the synthetic spectrum-fitting technique to C I 5380 and O I 6156-8\nlines. The non-LTE corrections for these C I and O I lines were found to be\npractically negligible (less than a few hundredths dex). The resulting C and O\nabundances (along with the Fe abundance) turned out nearly uniform without any\nsystematic dependence upon Teff or vesini. We found, however, in spite of\nalmost solar Fe abundance ([Fe/H]~0), carbon turned out to be slightly subsolar\n([C/H]~-0.1) while oxygen slightly supersolar ([O/H]~+0.1). This lead to a\nconclusion that [C/O] ratio was moderately subsolar (~-0.2) in the primordial\ngas from which these Pleiades stars were formed ~120--130 Myr ago.\nInterestingly, similarly young B-type stars are reported to show just the same\nresult ([C/O]~-0.2), while rather aged (~1-10 Gyr) field F-G stars of\nnear-solar metallicity yield almost the solar value ([C/O]~0) on the average.\nSuch a difference in the C/O ratio between two star groups of distinctly\ndifferent ages may be explained as a consequence of orbit migration mechanism\nwhich Galactic stars may undergo over a long time.\n", "  Dark matter is believed to be a major component of our universe. In this\npaper we propose a new mechanism based on dark matter inspired\nsuper-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf to explain the recent observation of super\nluminous type Ia supernovae explosions. Our calculation shows when a white\ndwarf accretes enough dark matter, due to the Pauli exclusive principle between\nfermionic dark matter particles, the mass of corresponding dark white dwarf\n(which means the white dwarf mixed with dark matters) can significantly exceeds\nthe Chandrasekhar limit. Moreover, we investigate some physical observable\nquantities, such as the redshift and moment of inertia of the dark white dwarf\nand found that these quantities are sensitive to the dark matter particle's\ndistributions and thus can be potentially used to probe the relevant\ninformation of dark matter particles in the future.\n", "  In these proceedings we discuss a flavor-safe explanation of the anomaly\nfound in $R_K= {\\cal B}(B \\to K \\mu^+ \\mu^-)/{\\cal B}(B \\to K e^+ e^-)$ by\nLHCb, within the framework of composite Higgs models. We present a model\nfeaturing a non-negligible degree of compositeness for all three generations of\nright-handed leptons, which leads to a violation of lepton-flavor universality\nin neutral current interactions while other constraints from quark- and\nlepton-flavor physics are met. Moreoever, the particular embedding of the\nlepton sector considered in this setup provides a parametrically enhanded\ncontribution to the Higgs mass that can weak considerably the need for\nultra-light top partners.\n", "  Over the years, advances in experimental and computational methods have\nhelped us to understand the role of thermodynamic, kinetic and active\n(chaperone-aided) effects in coordinating the folding steps required to\nachieving a knotted native state. Here, we review such developments by paying\nparticular attention to the complementarity of experimental and computational\nstudies. Key open issues that could be tackled with either or both approaches\nare finally pointed out.\n", "  An X-ray flaring source was found near the galaxy NGC 4697. Two flares were\nseen, separated by four years. The flux increased by a factor of 90 on a\ntimescale of about one minute. Both flares were very brief. There is no optical\ncounterpart at the position of the flares, but if the source was at the\ndistance of NGC 4697, the luminosities were 10^39 erg/s. Here we report the\nresults of a search of archival X-ray data for 70 nearby galaxies looking for\nsimilar such flares. We found two flaring sources in globular clusters or\nultra-compact dwarf companions of parent elliptical galaxies. One source flared\nonce to a peak luminosity of 9 x 10^40 erg/s, while the other flared five times\nto 10^40 erg/s. All of the flare rise times were <1 minute, and they then\ndecayed over about an hour. When not flaring, the sources appear to be normal\naccreting neutron star or black hole X-ray binaries, but they are located in\nold stellar populations, unlike the magnetars, anomalous X-ray pulsars or soft\ngamma repeaters that have repetitive flares of similar luminosities.\n", "  A pair of random walkers, the motion of each of which in two dimensions is\nconfined spatially by the action of a quadratic potential centered at different\nlocations for the two walks, are analyzed in the context of reaction-diffusion.\nThe application sought is to the process of transmission of infection in\nepidemics. The walkers are animals such as rodents in considerations of the\nHantavirus epidemic, infected or susceptible, the reaction is the transmission\nof infection, and the confining potential represents the tendency of the\nanimals to stay in the neighborhood of their home range centers. Calculations\nare based on a recently developed formalism (Kenkre and Sugaya, Bull. Math.\nBio. 76, 3016 (2014)) structured around analytic solutions of a Smoluchowski\nequation and one of its aims is the resolution of peculiar but well-known\nproblems of reaction-diffusion theory in 2-dimensions. In the present analysis,\nreaction occurs not at points but in spatial regions of dimensions larger than\n0. The analysis uncovers interesting nonintuitive phenomena one of which is\nsimilar to that encountered in the 1-dimensional analysis given in the quoted\narticle, and another specific to the fact that the reaction region is spatially\nextended. The analysis additionally provides a realistic description of\nobservations on animals transmitting infection while moving on what is\neffectively a 2-dimensional landscape. Along with the general formalism and\nexplicit 1-dimensional analysis given in Bull. Math. Bio. 76, 3016 (2014), the\npresent work forms a model calculational tool for the analysis for the\ntransmission of infection in dilute systems.\n", "  The longitudinal tracking engine of the particle accelerator simulation\napplication PyHEADTAIL shows a heavy potential for parallelisation. For basic\nbeam circulation, the tracking functionality with the leap-frog algorithm is\nextracted and compared between a sequential C and a concurrent CUDA C API\nimplementation for 1 million revolutions. Including the sequential data I/O in\nboth versions, a pure speedup of up to S = 100 is observed which is in the\norder of magnitude of what is expected from Amdahl's law. From O(100)\nmacro-particles on the overhead of initialising the GPU CUDA device appears\noutweighed by the concurrent computations on the 448 available CUDA cores.\n", "  Numerous natural processes are contingent on microorganisms' ability to swim\nthrough fluids with non-Newtonian rheology. Here, we use the model organism\nCaenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the\ndynamics of undulatory swimming in shear-thinning fluids. Theory and simulation\nhave proposed that the cost of swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower\nin a shear-thinning fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear\nviscosity. We aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of\nswimming in a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power\nof the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which\nshould yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low Reynolds number\nswimmer. We find the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids is less than or\nequal to the cost of swimming in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear\nviscosity; furthermore, the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids scales\nwith a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology\nand simple swimming kinematics. Our results agree reasonably well with previous\ntheoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of\nswimming in generalized Newtonian fluids.\n", "  The three-dimensional pure quantum gravity with negative cosmological\nconstant is supposed to be dual to the extremal conformal field theory of\ncentral charge $c=24k$ in two dimensions. We employ the conformal bootstrap\nmethod to analyze the extremal CFTs, and find numerical evidence for the\nnon-existence of the extremal CFTs for sufficiently large central charge ($k\n\\ge 20$). We also explore near-extremal CFTs, a small modification of extremal\nones, and find similar evidence for their non-existence for large central\ncharge. This indicates, under the assumption of holomorphic factorization, the\npure gravity in the weakly curved AdS$_3$ do not exist as a consistent quantum\ntheory.\n", "  - Modeling Human cardiovascular system is always an important issue. One of\nthe most effective methods is using lumped model to reach to a complete model\nof human cardiovascular system. Such modeling with advanced considerations is\nused in this paper. Some of these considerations are as follow: Exact\nsimulating of ventricles as pressure suppliers, peristaltic motion of\ndescending arteries as additional suppliers, and dividing each vessel into more\nthan one compartment to reach more accurate answers. Finally a circuit with\nmore than 150 RLC segments and different elements is made. Then the\nverification of our complex circuit is done and at the end, obstruction as an\nimportant abnormality is investigated. For this aim different percents of\nobstruction in vital arteries are considered and the results are brought as\ndifferent graphs at the end. According to physiological texts the citation of\nour simulation and its results are obvious. To earn productive information\nabout arteries characteristics a 36-vessels model was chosen from biological\nsources.\n", "  The recent discoveries of circumbinary planets by $\\it Kepler$ raise\nquestions for contemporary planet formation models. Understanding how these\nplanets form requires characterizing their formation environment, the\ncircumbinary protoplanetary disc, and how the disc and binary interact and\nchange as a result. The central binary excites resonances in the surrounding\nprotoplanetary disc that drive evolution in both the binary orbital elements\nand in the disc. To probe how these interactions impact binary eccentricity and\ndisc structure evolution, N-body smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of gaseous protoplanetary discs surrounding binaries based on\nKepler 38 were run for $10^4$ binary periods for several initial binary\neccentricities. We find that nearly circular binaries weakly couple to the disc\nvia a parametric instability and excite disc eccentricity growth. Eccentric\nbinaries strongly couple to the disc causing eccentricity growth for both the\ndisc and binary. Discs around sufficiently eccentric binaries that strongly\ncouple to the disc develop an $m = 1$ spiral wave launched from the 1:3\neccentric outer Lindblad resonance (EOLR) that corresponds to an alignment of\ngas particle longitude of periastrons. All systems display binary semimajor\naxis decay due to dissipation from the viscous disc.\n", "  Network representations of systems from various scientific and societal\ndomains are neither completely random nor fully regular, but instead appear to\ncontain recurring structural building blocks. These features tend to be shared\nby networks belonging to the same broad class, such as the class of social\nnetworks or the class of biological networks. At a finer scale of\nclassification within each such class, networks describing more similar systems\ntend to have more similar features. This occurs presumably because networks\nrepresenting similar purposes or constructions would be expected to be\ngenerated by a shared set of domain specific mechanisms, and it should\ntherefore be possible to classify these networks into categories based on their\nfeatures at various structural levels. Here we describe and demonstrate a new,\nhybrid approach that combines manual selection of features of potential\ninterest with existing automated classification methods. In particular,\nselecting well-known and well-studied features that have been used throughout\nsocial network analysis and network science and then classifying with methods\nsuch as random forests that are of special utility in the presence of feature\ncollinearity, we find that we achieve higher accuracy, in shorter computation\ntime, with greater interpretability of the network classification results.\n", "  The Groningen gas field shows exponential growth in earthquakes event counts\naround a magnitude M1 with a doubling time of 6-9 years since 2001. This\nbehavior is identified with dimensionless curvature in land subsidence, which\nhas been evolving at a constant rate over the last few decades {essentially\nuncorrelated to gas production.} We demonstrate our mechanism by a tabletop\ncrack formation experiment. The observed skewed distribution of event\nmagnitudes is matched by that of maxima of event clusters with a normal\ndistribution. It predicts about one event $<$\\,M5 per day in 2025, pointing to\nincreasing stress to human living conditions.\n", "  One of the most demanding tasks in astronomical image processing---in terms\nof precision---is the centroiding of stars. Upcoming large surveys are going to\ntake images of billions of point sources, including many faint stars, with\nshort exposure times. Real-time estimation of the centroids of stars is crucial\nfor real-time PSF estimation, and maximal precision is required for\nmeasurements of proper motion.\n  The fundamental Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound sets a limit on the\nroot-mean-squared-error achievable by optimal estimators. In this work, we aim\nto compare the performance of various centroiding methods, in terms of\nsaturating the bound, when they are applied to relatively low signal-to-noise\nratio unsaturated stars assuming zero-mean constant Gaussian noise. In order to\nmake this comparison, we present the ratio of the root-mean-squared-errors of\nthese estimators to their corresponding Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound as a function of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio and the full-width at half-maximum of faint stars.\n  We discuss two general circumstances in centroiding of faint stars: (i) when\nwe have a good estimate of the PSF, (ii) when we do not know the PSF. In the\ncase that we know the PSF, we show that a fast polynomial centroiding after\nsmoothing the image by the PSF can be as efficient as the maximum-likelihood\nestimator at saturating the bound. In the case that we do not know the PSF, we\ndemonstrate that although polynomial centroiding is not as optimal as PSF\nprofile fitting, it comes very close to saturating the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower\nbound in a wide range of conditions. We also show that the moment-based method\nof center-of-light never comes close to saturating the bound, and thus it does\nnot deliver reliable estimates of centroids.\n", "  In this paper we present the NLO QCD + NLO EW corrections to the $ZZZ$\nproduction with subsequent $Z$-boson leptonic decays at the LHC by adopting the\nimproved narrow width approximation, which takes into account off-shell\ncontributions and spin correlations. Integrated cross sections at $13$, $14$,\n$33$ and $100~{\\rm TeV}$ hadron colliders and various kinematic distributions\nare presented. Our numerical results show that the jet emission correction\naccounts for a large part of the total QCD correction, especially in the high\nenergy region. By applying a proper cut to the jet transverse momentum, e.g.,\n$p_{{\\rm \\,T,jet}} > p_{{\\rm \\,T,jet}}^{{\\rm \\,\\,\\,cut}}=50~{\\rm GeV}$, the jet\nemission correction can be reduced and the cross section is less dependent on\nthe factorization/renormalization scale. This work reveals that both the NLO\nQCD and the NLO EW corrections are significant. For example, the NLO QCD, NLO\nEW and NLO QCD + EW relative corrections in the inclusive event selection\nscheme at the $13~{\\rm TeV}$ LHC can reach $63.2\\%$, $-9.6\\%$ and $47.5\\%$,\nrespectively, which means that neither the NLO QCD nor the NLO EW correction is\nnegligible in precision calculations.\n", "  Conceiving the possibility of using plastic scintillator bars as robust\ndetectors for antineutrino detection for the remote reactor monitoring and\nnuclear safeguard application we study expected basic performance by Monte\nCarlo simulation. We present preliminary results for a 1 m3 highly segmented\ndetector made of 100 rectangular scintillation bars forming an array which is\nsandwiched at both sides by the continuous light guides enabling light sharing\nbetween all photo detectors. Light detection efficiency is calculated for\nseveral light collection configurations, considering different scintillation\nblock geometries and number of photo-detectors. The photo-detectors signals are\nforming the specific hit pattern, which is characterizing the impinging\nparticle. The statistical analysis of hit patterns allows effectively select\nantineutrino events and rejects backgrounds. To evaluate detector sensitivity\nto fuel isotopic composition evolution during fuel burning cycle we have\ncalculated antineutrino spectra. The statistical analyses of the antineutrino\nspectra for several dates of fuel burning cycle, folded with 15% FWHM at 1 MeV\nenergy resolution of the detector, prove the possibility of proposed detector\nto measure fuel composition evolution during fuel cycle.\n", "  We investigated the reliability of our silicon atomic model and the influence\nof non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) on the formation of neutral\nsilicon (Si I) lines in the near-infrared (near-IR) H-band. We derived the\ndifferential Si abundances for 13 sample stars with high-resolution H-band\nspectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE), as well as from optical spectra, both under local thermodynamical\nequilibrium (LTE) and NLTE conditions. We found that the differences between\nthe Si abundances derived from the H-band and from optical lines for the same\nstars are less than 0.1 dex when the NLTE effects included, and that NLTE\nreduces the line-to-line scatter in the H-band spectra for most sample stars.\nThese results suggest that our Si atomic model is appropriate for studying the\nformation of H-band Si lines. Our calculations show that the NLTE corrections\nof the Si I H-band lines are negative, i.e. the final Si abundances will be\noverestimated in LTE. The corrections for strong lines depend on surface\ngravity, and tend to be larger for giants, reaching ~ -0.2 dex in our sample,\nand up to ~ -0.4 dex in extreme cases of APOGEE targets. Thus, the NLTE effects\nshould be included in deriving silicon abundances from H-band Si I lines,\nespecially for the cases where only strong lines are available.\n", "  We propose a new method for assessing agents influence in network structures,\nwhich takes into consideration nodes attributes, individual and group\ninfluences of nodes, and the intensity of interactions. This approach helps us\nto identify both explicit and hidden central elements which cannot be detected\nby classical centrality measures or other indices.\n", "  We study the (H\\\"older-)continuous behavior of the spectra belonging to a\nfamily of linear bounded operators $(A_t)_{t\\in T}$ indexed by a topological\nspace $T$. For the cases of self-adjoint, unitary and normal operators, a\ncharacterization of the continuity of $\\Sigma:T\\to \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbb{R}),\nt\\mapsto \\sigma(A_t),$ is proven while the distance of the spectra is measured\nby the Hausorff metric. If $T$ is a metric space, the H\\\"older-continuous\nbehavior of $\\Sigma$ is characterized for self-adjoint and unitary operators.\nHere we observe interesting effects, namely the rate of convergence is bisect\nwhenever spectral gaps closes.\n  Based on this, we provide a tool to prove the continuity of the spectra for\nlarge classes of operators. In particular, we apply this theory to generalized\nSchr\\\"odinger operators and show that the continuity of the spectra is\ncharacterized by the continuous variation of the underlying dynamical systems.\n  Finally, we analyze the existence of periodic dynamical systems approximating\na given dynamical system. This leads to periodic approximations of the\ncorresponding Schr\\\"odinger operators by the previously developed theory. We\nprove that local symmetries of the patterns and the presence of a substitution\nis a sufficient criteria for periodic approximations of subshifts in\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$. For $d=1$, a characterization is proven for the existence of\nperiodic approximations. For these approaches, the notion of a dictionary is\nfurther developed and defined independently of a given configuration. We prove\nthat the set of dictionaries equipped with the local pattern topology is\nhomeomorphic to the space of subshifts. This yields a useful tool to analyze\nthese systems. Furthermore, it delivers the connection of the existence of\nperiodic orbits in a subshift of finite type and the existence of periodic\napproximations for subshifts.\n", "  Vapour deposition can directly produce ultrastable glasses, which are similar\nto conventional glasses aged over thousands of years. The highly mobile surface\nlayer is believed to accelerate the ageing process of vapour-deposited glasses,\nbut its microscopic kinetics has not been experimentally observed. Here we\nstudied the deposition growth kinetics of a two-dimensional colloidal glass at\nthe single-particle level using video microscopy. We found that newly deposited\nparticles in the surface layer (depth $d<14$ particles) relaxed via frequent\nout-of-cage motions, while particles in the deeper middle layer\n($14<d\\lesssim100$ particles) relaxed via activation of cooperative\nrearrangement regions (CRRs). These CRRs were much larger, more anisotropic and\noccurred more frequently than CRRs in the bulk ($d\\gtrsim100$ particles) or\nafter deposition. Their centers of mass moved towards the surface, while the\nparticles within moved towards the bulk, causing free-volume \"bubbles\" to move\ntowards the surface to give a more compact bulk glass. This two-step relaxation\nin two surface layers is distinct from the previously assumed relaxation in one\nsurface mobile layer\n", "  Motivated by issues arising in population dynamics, we consider the problem\nof iterating a given analytic function a number of times. We use the celebrated\ntechnique known as Carleman linearization that turns (for a certain class of\nfunctions) this problem into simply taking the power of a real number. We\nexpand this method, showing in particular that it can be used for population\nmodels with immigration, and we also apply it to the famous logistic map. We\nalso are able to give a number of results for the invariant density of this\nmap, some being related to the Carleman linearization.\n", "  A systematically designed study has been conducted to understand and clearly\ndemarcate the degree of contribution by the constituting elements to the\nsurface tension of nanocolloids. The effects of elements such as surfactants,\nparticles and the combined effects of these on the interfacial tension of these\ncomplex fluids are studied employing pendant drop shape analysis method by\nfitting Young Laplace equation. Only particle has shown considerable increase\nin surface tension with particle concentration in a polar medium like DI water\nwhereas only marginal effect particles on surface tension in weakly polar\nmediums like glycerol and ethylene glycol. Such behaviour has been attributed\nto the enhanced desorption of particles to the interface and a mathematical\nframework has been derived to quantify this. Combined particle and surfactant\neffect on surface tension of complex nanofluid system showed a decreasing\nbehaviour with respect to the particle and surfactant concentration with a\nconsiderably feeble effect of particle concentration. This combined colloidal\nsystem recorded a surface tension value below the surface tension of aqueous\nsurfactant system at the same concentration, which is a counterintuitive\nobservation as only particle results in increase in surface tension and only\nsurfactant results in decrease in surface tension. The possible physical\nmechanism behind such an anomaly happening at the complex fluid air interface\nhas been explained. Detailed analyses based on thermodynamic, mechanical and\nchemical equilibrium of the constituents and their adsorption-desorption\ncharacteristics as extracted from Gibbs adsorption analysis has been provided.\n", "  We investigate the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical end\npoint (CEP) in the SU(2) Polyakov$-$Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model with\nentanglement interaction giving special attention to the $\\pi$ and\n$\\sigma$-mesons properties, namely the decay widths $\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$,\nfor several conditions around the CEP: we focus on the possible\n$\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ decay along the isentropic trajectories close to the\nCEP since the hydrodynamical expansion of a heavy-ion collision fireball nearly\nfollows trajectories of constant entropy. It is expected that the type of\ntransition the dense medium goes through as it expands after the thermalization\ndetermines the behavior of this decay. It is shown that no pions are produced\nfrom the sigma decay in the chirally symmetric phase if the isentropic lines\napproach the first order line from chemical potentials above it. Near the CEP\nor above the $\\sigma\\rightarrow\\pi\\pi$ decay is possible with a high decay\nwidth.\n", "  The solution of a two level system driven by a Laser in the adiabatic limit\nis determined using third order Magnus expansion. We made the assumption that\nthe laser is on resonance or close to resonance with the Bohr transition. As a\nconsequence of which we are able to obtain a Hamiltonian which commute with\nitself at different times. We solve the problem using the Sylvester Formula\nwhere we make use of the eigenvalues.\n", "  We study very generally to what extent the uncertainty with which a phase\nshift can be estimated in quantum metrology can be reduced by extending the\nHamiltonian that generates the phase shift to an ancilla system with a Hilbert\nspace of arbitrary dimension, and allowing arbitrary interactions between the\noriginal system and the ancilla. Such Hamiltonian extensions provide a general\nframework for open quantum systems, as well as for \"non-linear metrology\nschemes\" that have been investigated over the last few years. We prove that\nsuch Hamiltonian extensions cannot improve the sensitivity of the phase shift\nmeasurement when considering the quantum Fisher information optimized over\ninput states.\n", "  We construct a two-dimensional tight-binding model of an optical lattice,\nwhere the low energy excitations should be described by the spin-1 Maxwell\nequations in the Hamiltonian form, and such linear dispersion excitations with\npesudospin-1 are so called as the Maxwell quasiparticles. The system has rich\ntopological features, for examples, the threefold degeneracy points called\nMaxwell points may have nontrivial $\\pm 2\\pi$ Berry phases and the anomalous\nquantum Hall effect with spin-momentum locking may appear in topological\nMaxwell insulators. We propose realistic schemes for realizing the Maxwell\nmetals/insulators and detecting the intrinsic properties of the topological\nMaxwell quasiparticles with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  In the article we explain in detail how to build a photorefractive oscillator\n(PRO), which is a laser-pumped nonlinear optical cavity containing a\nphotorefractive crystal. The specific PRO whose construction we describe\nsystematically, is based on a Fabry-Perot optical cavity working in a\nnon-degenerate four wave-mixing configuration. This particular PRO has the\nproperty that the generated beam exhibits laser-like phase invariance and, as\nan application, we show how a suitably modulated injected beam converts the\noutput field from phase-invariant into phase-bistable. While the emphasis is\nmade on the making of the experimental device and on the way measurements are\nimplemented, some introduction to the photorefractive effect as well as to the\nnecessary concepts of nonlinear dynamics are also given, so that the article is\nreasonably self-contained.\n", "  Gauge mediated supersymmetry (SUSY)-breaking (GMSB) furnishes the best idea\nto overcome the flavor problem in SSMs, supersymmetric stand models (SM).\nHowever, implemented in the minimal SSM (MSSM), a very serious fine-tuning\nproblem arises, owing to the absence of a large $A_t$ term in the stop sector\nto radiatively enhance the SM-like Higgs boson mass. In the extended GMSB\ncoupling $H_u$ to messengers can alleviate this problem but encounters the\n$A_t/m_{H_u}^2$ problem, i.e., at the same time a large $m_{H_u}^2$ is\ngenerated, rendering radiative electroweak spontaneously breaking (EWSB)\nproblematic. This issue shows similarity to another long-standing problem of\nGMSB, the $\\mu/{B_\\mu }$ problem, and, of great interest, we find that they may\nadmit the same solution, nonradiative EWSB. Such a solution is naturally\naccommodated when both $H_u$ and $H_d$ couple to messengers. As a bonus of\nnonradiative EWSB, the sleptons tend to be very light due to the significant\nrenormalization group equation effect and they are able to account for the\n$(g-2)_\\mu$ puzzle. As a concrete example, we investigate a hidden sector with\n$(10,\\overline {10})$ messengers.\n", "  Swimming at small Reynolds number of a linear assembly of identical spheres\nimmersed in a viscous fluid is studied on the basis of a set of equations of\nmotion for the individual spheres. The motion of the spheres is caused by\nactuating forces and forces derived from a direct interaction potential, as\nwell as hydrodynamic forces exerted by the fluid as frictional and added mass\nhydrodynamic interactions. The swimming velocity is deduced from the momentum\nbalance equation for the assembly of spheres, and the mean power required\nduring a period is calculated from an instantaneous power equation. Expressions\nare derived for the mean swimming velocity and the mean power, valid to second\norder in the amplitude of displacements from the relative equilibrium\npositions. Hence these quantities can be evaluated in terms of prescribed\nperiodic displacements. Explicit calculations are performed for a linear chain\nof three identical spheres.\n", "  The differential transform method (DTM) is a relatively new technique that\nmay be used to find a series solution to differential equations (both linear\nand nonlinear) through an iterative process. This brief manuscript is an\ninitial effort in applying the DTM to provide a series solution to the\none-dimensional Rayleigh-Plesset equation (RPE).\n", "  We present a definition of tensor fields which are average of tensors over a\nmanifold, with a straightforward and natural definition of derivative for the\naveraged fields; which in turn makes a suitable and practical construction for\nthe study of averages of tensor fields that satisfy differential equations.\nAlthough we have in mind applications to general relativity, our presentation\nis applicable to a general n-dimensional manifold. The definition is based on\nthe integration of scalars constructed from a physically motivated basis,\nmaking use of the least amount of geometrical structure. We also present\ndefinitions of covariant derivative of the averaged tensors and Lie derivative.\n", "  Observer dependence is central to Quantum Mechanics; in particular if we\nassociate consistent sets with observer worldviews we can think of the\nConsistent Histories (CH) interpretation as a formalisation of observer\ndependence. However we lack a theory of the observers themselves. In this paper\nwe begin by building such a theory within General Relativity (GR), and find\nthat this framework bears close mathematical resemblance to the treatment of\nconsistent sets in CH. We therefore adapt the CHSH framework to identify the\n`gap' between the classical and quantum theories. We find that the CHSH\nargument does not hold on a curved background, so that the inequality may be\nviolated by classical theories.\n", "  The purpose of the present paper is to derive the pointer states of a\nmacro-object using a simple perturbation method. We study the model Hamiltonian\ninvolving the weak interaction between the center of mass and its environment.\n  The main conclusion is that the pointer states emerge as the small part of\nthe total state vector when the interaction Hamiltonian is not dominant: the\ndegrees of freedom being at the center of interaction can be localized. In the\nweak interaction case, if the disappearance of the energy contribution from the\noff-diagonal terms is caused by the decoherence, it threatens the conservation\nlaw. In this study, however, the energy conservation reasonably holds, since\nthe non-classical (i.e., normal quantum) states give main contribution to it.\n  The emergence of the pointer states also implies the special initial state in\nwhich the localized state makes the deep well of the potential. In the result,\nthe unitary time evolution of a pointer state is very different from that of\nthe majority of the original state vector of the total system.\n", "  The rapid proper motion of the alpha Cen pair (3.7 arcsec/yr) and its\nlocation close to the galactic plane on a rich stellar background combine to\nmake them excellent candidates for stellar conjunctions with distant stars.\nAdding new astrometry to archival data, we have refined the orbital parameters,\nbarycentric proper motion and parallax of alpha Cen and compute its apparent\ntrajectory on sky over the coming decades. We present a catalog of the expected\nclose conjunctions until 2050. An exceptional event will take place in early\nMay 2028, when alpha Cen A will come within 0.015 +/- 0.135 arcseconds of the\nmK = 7.8 star 2MASS 14392160-6049528 (hereafter S5). In terms of impact\nparameter and contrast, this is the most favorable stellar conjunction of alpha\nCen within at least the next three decades. With an angular diameter of LD =\n0.47 +/- 0.05 mas, it is likely that S5 is a red giant or supergiant located at\nseveral kiloparsecs. The approached stars will act as moving light probes in\ntransmission through the environment of alpha Cen. The observation of these\nclose conjunctions holds great promises to search for planets and other low\nmass objects in the alpha Cen system using photometry and astrometry. The\nrelativistic deflection of the approached star images will be in the\nmilliarcsecond range. The small impact parameter of the conjunction with S5\nmeans that this star has a probability of 45% of entering the Einstein ring of\nalpha Cen A. The gravitational amplification of the flux of S5 could reach a\nfactor five for the combination of the two lensed images. The proper motion,\norbital parameters and parallax of alpha Cen will be measurable with an extreme\naccuracy from differential astrometry with the S stars. This will be valuable,\nfor example to prepare the Breakthrough Starshot initiative to send\ninterstellar nanocrafts to alpha Centauri.\n", "  We present a method to approximate functionals $\\text{Tr} \\, f(A)$ of very\nhigh-dimensional hermitian matrices $A$ represented as Matrix Product Operators\n(MPOs). Our method is based on a reformulation of a block Lanczos algorithm in\ntensor network format. We state main properties of the method and show how to\nadapt the basic Lanczos algorithm to the tensor network formalism to allow for\nhigh-dimensional computations. Additionally, we give an analysis of the\ncomplexity of our method and provide numerical evidence that it yields good\napproximations of the entropy of density matrices represented by MPOs while\nbeing robust against truncations.\n", "  In these lectures we provide a basic introduction into the topic of\ndispersion relation and analyticity. The properties of 2-point functions are\ndiscussed in some detail from the viewpoint of the K\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann and\ngeneral dispersion relations. The Weinberg sum rules figure as an application.\nThe analytic structure of higher point functions in perturbation theory are\nanalysed through the Landau equations and the Cutkosky rules.\n", "  The Landsman-Reuvers proposal to solve the measurement problem from within\nquantum theory is extensively analysed. In favor of proposals of this kind, it\nis shown that the standard reasoning behind objections to solving the\nmeasurement problem from within quantum theory rely on counterfactual reasoning\nor mathematical idealisations. Subsequently, a list of objections/challenges to\nthe proposal are made. Part of these objections are equally important for all\nattempts at solving the measurement problem, such as the problem of\ninterpreting small numbers in the density matrix, the problem of reproducing\nthe Born rule, the use of pure states as a tool to alleviate the\ninterpretational issues of quantum states, and the necessity of introducing\nclassical certainties which are not strictly present in quantum theory. The\nadditional objections that are particular to the proposal, such as the physical\ninterpretation/origin of the flea perturbation, the use of potentials to solve\na dynamical problem, slow collapse times, the inability to handle unequal\nprobabilities, and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead us to\nbelieve that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking in both physical\ngrounding and theoretical promise. Finally, an overview is given of the\nchallenges that were encountered in this attempt to solve the measurement\nproblem from within quantum theory.\n", "  We study the impact of instrumental systematics on the variance, skewness,\nand kurtosis of redshifted 21 cm intensity fluctuation observations from the\nEpoch of Reionization. We simulate realistic 21 cm observations based on the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase I reionization experiment, using the\narray's point spread function (PSF) and antenna beam patterns, full-sky 21 cm\nmodels, and the FHD imaging pipeline. We measure the observed redshift\nevolution of pixel probability density functions (PDF) and one-point statistics\nfrom the simulated maps, comparing them to the measurements derived from\nsimpler simulations that represent the instrument PSFs with Gaussian kernels.\nWe find that both methods yield statistics with similar trends with greater\nthan 80% correlation. We perform additional simulations based on the Hydrogen\nEpoch of Reionization Array (HERA), using Gaussian kernels as the instrument\nPSFs, and study the effect of frequency binning on the statistics. We find that\nPSF smoothing and sampling variance from measuring the statistics over limited\nfield of view dilute intrinsic features and add fluctuations to the statistics\nbut reveal new detectable features. Observed kurtosis will increase when a few\nextremely high or low temperature regions are present in the maps. Frequency\nbinning reduces the thermal uncertainty but can also blur regions along the\nfrequency dimension, resulting in kurtosis peaks that only appear in statistics\nderived from maps of certain frequency bins. We further find that the kurtosis\npeaks will reach their maxima when the angular resolution of the PSFs match the\nsize scale of the extreme regions that produce the peaks. The HERA array should\nbe capable of charting the evolution of the observed skewness and kurtosis of\nthe 21 cm fluctuations with high sensitivity while the MWA Phase I will likely\nbe capable of detecting the peak in variance.\n", "  The SU(4) gauge theory with two flavors of Dirac fermions in the sextet\nrepresentation shares features of a candidate for a composite Higgs model. The\nanalogue of the Higgs multiplet of the Standard Model lives in the Goldstone\nmanifold resulting from spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry SU(4) to\nSO(4). The Higgs potential arises from interaction with the particles of the\nStandard Model. We have computed the gauge boson contribution to the Higgs\npotential, using valence overlap fermions on a Wilson-clover sea. The\ncalculation is similar to that of the electromagnetic mass splitting of the\npion multiplet in QCD.\n", "  We propose a criterion to classify and compare sources of single photons: the\n$p$-norm of their $k$th-order photon correlations. While ideally one should use\nthe uniform norm with $p\\rightarrow\\infty$, in practice, the 3-norm already\nallows a meaningful comparison and shows the serious limitations of the usual\ncriterion based on the second order correlation $g^{(2)}$ only. We apply this\nnew criterion to a large family of popular single photon sources and show that\nsome of them do not, in fact, qualify for this function. The best sources from\nour selections consist of a cascade of two-level systems, improving on the\notherwise standard low-power resonant excitation of a single two-level system.\n", "  The ongoing search for high voltage positive electrode materials for Mg\nbatteries has been primarily hampered by poor Mg mobility in bulk oxide\nframeworks. Motivated by the presence of Mo$_3$ clusters that can facilitate\ncharge redistribution and the presence of Mg in a non-preferred (tetrahedral)\ncoordination environment, we have investigated the Mg (de)intercalation\nbehavior in layered-Mg$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, a potential positive electrode. While no\nelectrochemical activity is observed, chemical demagnesiation of\nMg$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ is successful but leads to amorphization. Subsequent\nfirst-principles calculations predict a strong thermodynamic driving force for\nstructure decomposition at low Mg concentrations and high activation barriers\nfor bulk Mg diffusion, in agreement with experimental observations. Further\nanalysis of the Mg diffusion pathway reveals an O--Mg--O dumbbell intermediate\nsite that creates a high Mg$^{2+}$ migration barrier, indicating the influence\nof transition states on setting the magnitude of migration barriers.\n", "  We investigate the energy dependence of inelastic processes in systems which\npossess Efimov states. We consider the three-body recombination rate $K_3$\nwhere three free atoms interact to produce an atom--dimer pair, and the\nrelaxation rate $K_{\\rm rel}$ where an atom quenches a weakly bound state of a\ndimer near an Efimov resonance to more deeply bound levels. Using a model\ncapturing the key features of the Efimov problem, we identify new energy\nregimes for $K_3$, namely the NTR (Near Threshold Resonance) regime behavior\n$E^{-2}$ for negative scattering lengths and the NTS (Near Threshold\nSuppression) regime behavior $E^2$ for positive scattering lengths. We also\nconfirm a previously found oscillatory behavior of $K_3$ at higher energy $E$.\nFinally, we find that $K_{\\rm rel}$ behaves as $E^{-1}$ in the NTR regime.\n", "  We address the response, both in amplitude and intensity, of a Fabry-Perot\nfrom a variety of viewpoints. These complementary pictures conspire to achieve\na comprehensive and consistent theory of the operation of this system.\n"]}
