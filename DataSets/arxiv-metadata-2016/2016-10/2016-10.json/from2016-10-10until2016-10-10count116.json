The potential are obtained by means of the sum\nof two independent terms: a potential associated with a thin disc and a\npotential associated with a spheroidal halo, which are expressed as\nappropriated superpositions of products of Legendre functions, in such a way\nthat the model implies a linear relationship between the masses of the thin\ndisc and the spheroidal halo. By taking a particular case for the halo\npotential, we found that the circular velocity obtained can be adjusted very\naccurately to the observed rotation curves of some specific galaxies, so that\nthe models are stable against radial and vertical perturbations. Two particular\nmodels for the galaxies NGC4389 and UGC6969 are obtained by adjusting the\ncircular velocity with data of the observed rotation curve of some galaxies of\nthe Ursa Mayor Cluster, as reported in Verheijen and Sancisi 2001. The values\nof the halo mass and the disc mass for these two galaxies are computed\nobtaining a very narrow interval of values for these quantities. Furthermore,\nthe values of obtained masses are in perfect agreement with the expected order\nof magnitude and with the relative order of magnitude between the halo mass and\nthe disc mass.\n", "  Stabilizing unstable periodic orbits in a chaotic invariant set not only\nreveals information about its structure but also leads to various interesting\napplications. For the successful application of a chaos control scheme,\nconvergence speed is of crucial importance. Here we present a predictive\nfeedback chaos control method that adapts a control parameter online to yield\noptimal asymptotic convergence speed. We study the adaptive control map both\nanalytically and numerically and prove that it converges at least linearly to a\nvalue determined by the spectral radius of the control map at the periodic\norbit to be stabilized. The method is easy to implement algorithmically and may\nfind applications for adaptive online control of biological and engineering\nsystems.\n", "  Two-loop corrections for the standard Abelian Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model are\nobtained with the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) method. These\ncontributions improve the usual mean-field and Hartree-Fock results by\ngenerating a $1/N_c$ suppressed term, which only contributes at finite chemical\npotential. We take the zero temperature limit observing that, within the OPT,\nchiral symmetry is restored at a higher chemical potential $\\mu$, while the\nresulting equation of state is stiffer than the one obtained when mean-field is\napplied to the standard version of the model. In order to understand the\nphysical nature of these finite $N_c$ contributions, we perform a numerical\nanalysis to show that the OPT quantum corrections mimic effective repulsive\nvector-vector interaction contributions. We also derive a simple analytical\napproximation for the mass gap, accurate at the percent level, matching the\nmean-field approximation extended by an extra vector channel to OPT. For $\\mu\n\\gtrsim \\mu_c$ the effective vector coupling matching OPT is numerically close\n(for the Abelian model) to the Fierz-induced Hartree-Fock value $G/(2N_c)$,\nwhere $G$ is the scalar coupling, and then increases with $\\mu$ in a\nwell-determined manner.\n", "  We discuss the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic\nNavier-Fourier-Stokes (NFS) theory. The next-to-leading order relativistic\ncorrections to the NFS theory for the Landau-Lifshitz fluid are obtained. While\nthe lowest order truncation of the velocity expansion leads to the usual NFS\nequations of nonrelativistic fluids, we show that when the next-to-leading\norder relativistic corrections are included, the equations can be expressed\nconcurrently with two different fluid velocities. One of the fluid velocities\nis parallel to the conserved charge current (which follows the Eckart\ndefinition) and the other one is parallel to the energy current (which follows\nthe Landau-Lifshitz definition). We compare this next-to-leading order\nrelativistic hydrodynamics with bivelocity hydrodynamics, which is one of the\ngeneralizations of the NFS theory and is formulated in such a way to include\nthe usual mass velocity and also a new velocity, called the volume velocity. We\nfind that the volume velocity can be identified with the velocity obtained in\nthe Landau-Lifshitz definition. Then, the structure of bivelocity\nhydrodynamics, which is derived using various nontrivial assumptions, is\nreproduced in the NFS theory including the next-to-leading order relativistic\ncorrections.\n", "  Improvements both in the photonic confinement and in the emitter design have\nled to a steady increase in the strength of the light-matter coupling in cavity\nquantum electrodynamics experiments. This has allowed to access\ninteraction-dominated regimes in which the state of the system can only be\ndescribed in terms of mixed light-matter excitations. Here we show that, when\nthe coupling between light and matter becomes strong enough, this picture\nbreaks down, and light and matter degrees of freedom totally decouple. A\nstriking consequence of such a counter-intuitive phenomenon is that the Purcell\neffect is reversed and the spontaneous emission rate, usually thought to\nincrease with the light-matter coupling strength, plummets instead for large\nenough couplings.\n", "  Citation networks represent the flow of information between agents. They are\nconstrained in time and so form directed acyclic graphs which have a causal\nstructure. Here we provide novel quantitative methods to characterise that\nstructure by adapting methods used in the causal set approach to quantum\ngravity by considering the networks to be embedded in a Minkowski spacetime and\nmeasuring its dimension using Myrheim-Meyer and Midpoint-scaling estimates. We\nillustrate these methods on citation networks from the arXiv, supreme court\njudgements from the USA, and patents and find that otherwise similar citation\nnetworks have measurably different dimensions. We suggest that these\ndifferences can be interpreted in terms of the level of diversity or narrowness\nin citation behaviour.\n", "  We have modified a commercial NOR flash memory array to enable high-precision\ntuning of individual floating-gate cells for analog computing applications. The\nmodified array area per cell in a 180 nm process is about 1.5 um^2. While this\narea is approximately twice the original cell size, it is still at least an\norder of magnitude smaller than in the state-of-the-art analog circuit\nimplementations. The new memory cell arrays have been successfully tested, in\nparticular confirming that each cell may be automatically tuned, with ~1%\nprecision, to any desired subthreshold readout current value within an almost\nthree-orders-of-magnitude dynamic range, even using an unoptimized tuning\nalgorithm. Preliminary results for a four-quadrant vector-by-matrix multiplier,\nimplemented with the modified memory array gate-coupled with additional\nperipheral floating-gate transistors, show highly linear transfer\ncharacteristics over a broad range of input currents.\n", "  In this paper, we bring to the awareness of the scientific community and\ncivil engineers, an important fact: the possible lack of wave protection of\ntransformational elastic cloaks. To do so, we propose spherical cloaks\ndescribed by a non-singular asymmetric elasticity tensor depending upon a small\nparameter $\\eta,$ that defines the softness of a region one would like to\nconceal from elastodynamic waves. By varying $\\eta$, we generate a class of\nsoft spheres dressed by elastodynamic cloaks, which are shown to considerably\nreduce the soft spheres' scattering. Importantly, such cloaks also provide some\nwave protection except for a countable set of frequencies, for which some large\nelastic field enhancement (resonance peaks) can be observed within the cloaked\nsoft spheres, hence entailing a possible lack of wave protection. We further\npresent an investigation of trapped modes in elasticity via which we supply a\ngood approximation of such Mie-type resonances by some transcendental equation.\nNext, after a detailed presentation of spherical elastodynamic PML of Cosserat\ntype, we introduce a novel generation of cloaks, the mixed cloaks, as a\nsolution to the lack of wave protection in elastodynamic cloaking. Indeed,\nmixed cloaks achieve both invisibility cloaking and protection throughout a\nlarge range of frequencies. We think, mixed cloaks will soon be generalized to\nother areas of physics and engineering and will in particular foster studies in\nexperiments.\n", "  Propagators approximated by a meromorphic functions with complex conjugated\npoles are widely used to model infrared behavior of QCD Green's functions. In\nthis paper, analytical solutions for two point correlator made out of functions\nwith complex conjugated poles or branch points have been obtained in the\nMinkowski space for the first time. As a special case the Gribov propagator has\nbeen considered as well. The result is different from the naive analytical\ncontinuation of the correlator primarily defined in the Euclidean space. It is\nfree of ultraviolet divergences, and instead of Lehmann it rather satisfies\nGribov integral representation.\n", "  The TeV blazar Markarian 421 underwent multi-TeV flaring during April 2004\nand simultaneously observed in x-ray and TeV energies. It was observed that the\nTeV outbursts had no counterparts in the lower energies, which implies that\nthis might be an orphan flare. In the context of hadronic model, we have shown\nthat this multi-TeV flaring can be produced due to the interaction of\nFermi-accelerated protons of energy $\\lesssim 168$ TeV with the background\nphotons in the low energy tail of the synchrotron self-Compton spectrum of the\nblazar jet. We fit very well the flaring spectrum with this model. Based on\nthis study, we speculate that Mrk 501 and PG 1553+113 are possible candidates\nfor orphan flaring in the future.\n", "  Four-point measurements using a multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM)\nare carried out in order to determine surface and step conductivities on\nSi(111) surfaces. In a first step, distance-dependent four-point measurements\nin the linear configuration are used in combination with an analytical\nthree-layer model for charge transport to disentangle the 2D surface\nconductivity from non-surface contributions. A termination of the Si(111)\nsurface with either Bi or H results in the two limiting cases of a pure 2D or\n3D conductance, respectively. In order to further disentangle the surface\nconductivity of the step-free surface from the contribution due to atomic\nsteps, a square four-probe configuration is applied as function of the rotation\nangle. In total this combined approach leads to an atomic step conductivity of\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{step} = (29 \\pm 9)$ $\\mathrm{\\Omega}^{-1} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and\nto a step-free surface conductivity of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{surf} = (9 \\pm 2) \\cdot\n10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega}^{-1}/\\square$ for the Si(111)-(7$\\times$7) surface.\n", "  Metal-oxide memristors have emerged as promising candidates for hardware\nimplementation of artificial synapses - the key components of high-performance,\nanalog neuromorphic networks - due to their excellent scaling prospects. Since\nsome advanced cognitive tasks require spiking neuromorphic networks, which\nexplicitly model individual neural pulses (spikes) in biological neural\nsystems, it is crucial for memristive synapses to support the\nspike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is believed to be the primary\nmechanism of Hebbian adaptation. A major challenge for the STDP implementation\nis that, in contrast to some simplistic models of the plasticity, the\nelementary change of a synaptic weight in an artificial hardware synapse\ndepends not only on the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic signals, but also on the\ninitial weight (memristor's conductance) value. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate, for the first time, STDP protocols that ensure self-adaptation of\nthe average memristor conductance, making the plasticity stable, i.e.\ninsensitive to the initial state of the devices. The experiments have been\ncarried out with 200-nm Al2O3/TiO2-x memristors integrated into 12x12\ncrossbars. The experimentally observed self-adaptive STDP behavior has been\ncomplemented with numerical modeling of weight dynamics in a simple system with\na leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron with a random spike-train input, using a\ncompact model of memristor plasticity, fitted for quantitatively correct\ndescription of our memristors.\n", "  Scalar fields are among the possible candidates for dark energy. This paper\nis devoted to the scalar fields from the inert doublet model, where instead of\none as in the standard model, two SU(2) Higgs doublets are used. The component\nfields of one SU(2) doublet ($\\phi_1$) act in an identical way to the standard\nmodel Higgs while the component fields of the second SU(2) doublet ($\\phi_2$)\nare taken to be the dark energy candidate (which is done by assuming that the\nphase transition in the field has not yet occurred). It is found that one can\narrange for late time acceleration (dark energy) by using an SU(2) Higgs\ndoublet in the inert Higgs doublet model, whose vacuum expectation value is\nzero, in the quintessential regime.\n", "  Tomography is the three-dimensional reconstruction of an object from images\ntaken at different angles. The term classical tomography is used, when the\nimaging beam travels in straight lines through the object. This assumption is\nvalid for light with short wavelengths, for example in x-ray tomography. For\nclassical tomography, a commonly used reconstruction method is the filtered\nback-projection algorithm which yields fast and stable object reconstructions.\nIn the context of single-cell imaging, the back-projection algorithm has been\nused to investigate the cell structure or to quantify the refractive index\ndistribution within single cells using light from the visible spectrum.\nNevertheless, these approaches, commonly summarized as optical projection\ntomography, do not take into account diffraction. Diffraction tomography with\nthe Rytov approximation resolves this issue. The explicit incorporation of the\nwave nature of light results in an enhanced reconstruction of the object's\nrefractive index distribution. Here, we present a full literature review of\ndiffraction tomography. We derive the theory starting from the wave equation\nand discuss its validity with the focus on applications for refractive index\ntomography. Furthermore, we derive the back-propagation algorithm, the\ndiffraction-tomographic pendant to the back-projection algorithm, and describe\nits implementation in three dimensions. Finally, we showcase the application of\nthe back-propagation algorithm to computer-generated scattering data. This\nreview unifies the different notations in literature and gives a detailed\ndescription of the back-propagation algorithm, serving as a reliable basis for\nfuture work in the field of diffraction tomography.\n", "  The recently developed selected columns of the density matrix (SCDM) method\n[J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 1463, 2015] is a simple, robust, efficient and\nhighly parallelizable method for constructing localized orbitals from a set of\ndelocalized Kohn-Sham orbitals for insulators and semiconductors with $\\Gamma$\npoint sampling of the Brillouin zone. In this work we generalize the SCDM\nmethod to Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations with k-point\nsampling of the Brillouin zone, which is needed for more general electronic\nstructure calculations for solids. We demonstrate that our new method, called\nSCDM-k, is by construction gauge independent and is a natural way to describe\nlocalized orbitals. SCDM-k computes localized orbitals without the use of an\noptimization procedure, and thus does not suffer from the possibility of being\ntrapped in a local minimum. Furthermore, the computational complexity of using\nSCDM-k to construct orthogonal and localized orbitals scales as O(N log N )\nwhere N is the total number of k-points in the Brillouin zone. SCDM-k is\ntherefore efficient even when a large number of k-points are used for Brillouin\nzone sampling. We demonstrate the numerical performance of SCDM-k using systems\nwith model potentials in two and three dimensions.\n", "  Motivated by understanding the emergence of thermodynamic restoring forces\nand oscillations, we develop a quantum-mechanical model of a bath of spins\ncoupled to the elasticity of a material. We show our model reproduces the\nbehavior of a variety of entropic springs while enabling investigation of\nnon-equilibrium resonator states in the quantum domain. We find our model\nemerges naturally in disordered elastic media such as glasses, and is an\nadditional, expected effect in systems with anomalous specific heat and 1/f\nnoise at low temperatures due to two-level systems that fluctuate.\n", "  We construct a universal spin$_c$ Dirac operator on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ built by\nprojecting $su(n+1)$ left actions and prove its equivalence to the standard\nright action Dirac operator on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$. The eigenvalue problem is\nsolved and the spinor space constructed thereof, showing that the proposed\nDirac operator is universal, changing only its domain for different spin$_c$\nstructures. Explicit expressions for the chirality and the eigenspinors are\nalso found and consistency with the index theorem is established. Also, the\nextended $\\mathcal{N} =2$ supersymmetry algebra is realised through the Dirac\noperator and its companion supercharge, and an expression for the\nsuperpotential of any spin$_c$ connection on $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ is found and\ngeneralised to any spin coset manifold $G/H$ with $G,H$ compact, connected, and\n$G$ semisimple. The $R$-symmetry of this superalgebra is found to be equivalent\nto the $U(1)$ holonomy of the spin$_c$ connection.\n", "  Too much noise kills entanglement. This is the main problem in its production\nand transmission. We use a handy approach to indicate noise resistance of\nentanglement of a bi-partite system described by $d\\times d$ Hilbert space. Our\nanalysis uses a geometric approach based on the fact that if a scalar product\nof a vector $\\vec{s}$ with a vector $\\vec {e}$ is less than the square of the\nnorm of $\\vec{e}$, then $\\vec{s}\\neq\\vec{e}$. We use such concepts for\ncorrelation tensors of separable and entangled states. As a general form\ncorrelation tensors for pairs of qudits, for $d>2$, is very difficult to\nobtain, because one does not have a Bloch sphere for pure one qudit states, we\nuse a simplified approach. The criterion reads: if the largest Schmidt\neigenvalue of a correlation tensor is smaller than the square of its norm, then\nthe state is entangled. this criterion is applied in the case of various types\nof noise admixtures to the initial (pure) state. These include white noise,\ncolored noise, local depolarizing noise and amplitude damping noise. A broad\nset of numerical and analytical results is presented. As the other simple\ncriterion for entanglement is violation of Bell's inequalities, we also find\ncritical noise parameters to violate specific family of Bell inequalities\n(CGLMP), for maximally entangled states. We give analytical forms of our\nresults for $d$ approaching infinity.\n", "  Nontrivial collective behavior may emerge from the interactive dynamics of\nmany oscillatory units. Chimera states are chaotic patterns of spatially\nlocalized coherent and incoherent oscillations. The recently-introduced notion\nof a weak chimera gives a rigorously testable characterization of chimera\nstates for finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks. In this paper we give\nsome persistence results for dynamically invariant sets under perturbations and\napply them to coupled populations of phase oscillators with generalized\ncoupling. In contrast to the weak chimeras with nonpositive maximal Lyapunov\nexponents constructed so far, we show that weak chimeras that are chaotic can\nexist in the limit of vanishing coupling between coupled populations of phase\noscillators. We present numerical evidence that positive Lyapunov exponents can\npersist for a positive measure set of this inter-population coupling strength.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional massive Thirring model formulated on the\nlattice with staggered fermions and an auxiliary compact vector (link) field,\nwhich is exactly solvable and shows a phase transition with increasing the\nchemical potential of fermion number: the crossover at a finite temperature and\nthe first order transition at zero temperature. We complexify its\npath-integration on Lefschetz thimbles and examine its phase transition by\nhybrid Monte Carlo simulations on the single dominant thimble. We observe a\ndiscrepancy between the numerical and exact results in the crossover region for\nsmall inverse coupling $\\beta$ and/or large lattice size $L$, while they are in\ngood agreement at the lower and higher density regions. We also observe that\nthe discrepancy persists in the continuum limit keeping the temperature finite\nand it becomes more significant toward the low-temperature limit. This\nnumerical result is consistent with our analytical study of the model's thimble\nstructure. And these results imply that the contributions of subdominant\nthimbles should be summed up in order to reproduce the first order transition\nin the low-temperature limit.\n", "  Recently ANTARES collaboration presented a time dependent analysis to a\nselected number of flaring blazars to look for upward going muon events\nproduced from the charge current interaction of the muon neutrinos. We use the\nsame list of flaring blazars to look for possible positional correlation with\nthe IceCube neutrino events. In the context of photohadronic model we propose\nthat the neutrinos are produced within the nuclear region of the blazar where\nFermi accelerated high energy protons interact with the background\nsynchrotron/SSC photons. Although we found that some objects from the ANTARES\nlist are within the error circles of few IceCube events, the statistical\nanalysis shows that none of these sources have a significant correlation.\n", "  We derive phenomenological model for endurance-write time switching tradeoff\nfor nonvolatile memories with thermally activated switching mechanisms. The\nmodel predicts linear to cubic dependence of endurance on write time for metal\noxide memristors and flash memories, which is partially supported by\nexperimental data for the breakdown of metal-oxide thin films.\n", "  Cold atoms with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) interactions provide intriguing\nnew platforms to explore novel quantum physics beyond natural conditions of\nsolids. Recent experiments demonstrated the one-dimensional (1D) SO coupling\nfor boson and fermion gases. However, realization of 2D SO interaction, a much\nmore important task, remains very challenging. Here we propose and\nexperimentally realize, for the first time, 2D SO coupling and topological band\nwith $^{87}$Rb degenerate gas through a minimal optical Raman lattice scheme,\nwithout relying on phase locking or fine tuning of optical potentials. A\ncontrollable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO\neffects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the atomic cloud\ndistribution and spin texture in the momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO\ncoupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a\nbroad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including the\nhighly-sought-after topological superfluid phases.\n", "  Linear optical elements are pivotal instruments in the manipulation of\nclassical and quantum states of light. The vast progress in integrated quantum\nphotonic technology enables the implementation of large numbers of such\nelements on chip while providing interferometric stability. As a trade-off\nthese structures face the intrinsic challenge of characterizing their optical\ntransformation as individual optical elements are not directly accessible. Thus\nthe unitary transformation needs to be reconstructed from a dataset generated\nwith having access to the input and output ports of the device only. Here we\npresent a novel approach to unitary reconstruction that significantly improves\nupon existing approaches. We compare its performance to several approaches via\nnumerical simulations for networks up to 14 modes. We show that an adapted\nversion of our approach allows to recover all mode-dependent losses and to\nobtain highest reconstruction fidelities under such conditions.\n", "  We study the halo-matter cross bispectrum in the presence of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity of the local type. We restrict ourselves to the squeezed limit,\nfor which the calculation are straightforward, and perform the measurements in\nthe initial conditions of N-body simulations, to mitigate the contamination\ninduced by nonlinear gravitational evolution. Interestingly, the halo-matter\ncross bispectrum is not trivial even in this simple limit as it is strongly\nsensitive to the scale-dependence of the quadratic and third-order halo bias.\nTherefore, it can be used to test biasing prescriptions. We consider three\ndifferent prescription for halo clustering: excursion set peaks (ESP), local\nbias and a model in which the halo bias parameters are explicitly derived from\na peak-background split. In all cases, the model parameters are fully\nconstrained with statistics other than the cross bispectrum. We measure the\ncross bispectrum involving one halo fluctuation field and two mass overdensity\nfields for various halo masses and collapse redshifts. We find that the ESP is\nin reasonably good agreement with the numerical data, while the other\nalternatives we consider fail in various cases. This suggests that the\nscale-dependence of halo bias also is a crucial ingredient to the squeezed\nlimit of the halo bispectrum.\n", "  In the literature on quantum reference frames, the internal (relative)\nproperties of a system are defined as those which are preserved under an\narbitrary change of reference frame. For a system of quantum spins, these are\nall properties preserved by proper spatial rotations of the laboratory.\nHowever, this approach does not account for the hypothetical possibility of the\nlaboratory becoming entangled to the system, as described by a second\nlaboratory (the `Wigner's friend' scenario), in which case the relationship\nbetween the two laboratories is not a rotation, but is fundamentally quantum.\nTo overcome this limitation, we re-define the reference frame transformations\nto be those that preserve the fidelities between subsystems. This enables us to\nderive U(2) as the correct symmetry group for transformations of a system of N\nspin-half particles. Next, we propose that systems having the same internal\nproperties should be regarded as physically equivalent in the absence of an\nexternal frame. Remarkably, this implies that a single spin in a superposition\nrelative to a spin magnet is equivalent to a macroscopic superposition of the\nmagnet relative to the spin. We discuss the implications of this result for the\nWigner's friend paradox.\n", "  We describe a seemingly unnoticed feature of the text-book Maxwell-Lorentz\nsystem of classical electrodynamics which challenges its formulation in terms\nof an initial value problem. For point-charges, even after appropriate\nrenormalization, we demonstrate that most of the generic initial data evolves\nto develop singularities in the electromagnetic fields along the light cones of\nthe initial charge positions. We provide explicit formulas for the\ncorresponding fields, demonstrate how this phenomenon renders the initial value\nproblem ill-posed, and show how such bad initial data can be ruled out by extra\nconditions in addition to the Maxwell constraints. These extra conditions,\nhowever, require knowledge of the history of the solution and, as we discuss,\neffectively turn the Maxwell-Lorentz system into a system of delay equations\nmuch like the Fokker-Schwarzschild-Tetrode equations. For extended charges such\nsingular light fronts persist in a smoothened form and, as we argue, yield\nphysically doubtful solutions. Our results also apply to some extent to\nexpectation values of field operators in quantum field theory.\n", "  Ultracold photoassociation is typically performed at large internuclear\nseparations, where the scattering wavefunction amplitude is large and\nFranck-Condon overlap is maximized. Recently, work by this group and others on\nalkali-metal diatomics has shown that photoassociation can efficiently form\nmolecules at short internuclear distance in both homonuclear and heteronuclear\ndimers. We propose that this short-range photoassociation is due to excitation\nnear the wavefunction amplitude maximum at the inner wall of the lowest triplet\npotential. We show that Franck-Condon factors from the highest-energy bound\nstate can almost precisely reproduce Franck-Condon factors from a low-energy\nscattering state, and that both calculations match experimental data from the\nnear-zero positive-energy scattering state with reasonable accuracy. We also\nshow that the corresponding photoassociation from the inner wall of the\nground-state singlet potential at much shorter internuclear distance is weaker\nand undetectable under our current experimental conditions. We predict from\nFranck-Condon factors that the strongest of these weaker short-range\nphotoassociation transitions are one order of magnitude below our current\nsensitivity.\n", "  Neutron grating interferometry is an advanced method in neutron imaging that\nallows the simultaneous recording of the transmission, the differential phase\nand the dark-field image. Especially the latter has recently received high\ninterest because of its unique contrast mechanism which marks ultra-small-angle\nneutron scattering within the sample. Hence, in neutron grating interferometry,\nan imaging contrast is generated by scattering of neutrons off micrometer-sized\ninhomogeneities. Although the scatterer cannot be resolved it leads to a\nmeasurable local decoherence of the beam. Here, a report is given on the design\nconsiderations, principles and applications of a new neutron grating\ninterferometer which has recently been implemented at the ANTARES beamline at\nthe Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum. Its highly flexible design allows to perform\nexperiments such as directional and quantitative dark-field imaging which\nprovide spatially resolved information on the anisotropy and shape of the\nmicrostructure of the sample. A comprehensive overview of the nGI principle is\ngiven, followed by theoretical considerations to optimize the setup performance\nfor different applications. Furthermore, an extensive characterization of the\nsetup is presented and its abilities are demonstrated on selected case studies:\n(i) dark-field imaging for material differentiation, (ii) directional\ndark-field imaging to mark and quantify micrometer anisotropies within the\nsample and (iii) quantitative dark-field imaging, providing additional size\ninformation on the sample's microstructure by probing its autocorrelation\nfunction.\n", "  A search for new physics is performed using events that contain one or more\njets, no isolated leptons, and a large transverse momentum imbalance, as\nmeasured through the MT2 variable, which is an extension of the transverse mass\nin events with two invisible particles. The results are based on a sample of\nproton-proton collisions collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with\nthe CMS detector at the LHC, and that corresponds to an integrated luminosity\nof 2.3 inverse femtobarns. The observed event yields in the data are consistent\nwith predictions for the standard model backgrounds. The results are\ninterpreted using simplified models of supersymmetry and are expressed in terms\nof limits on the masses of potential new colored particles. Assuming that the\nlightest neutralino is stable and has a mass less than about 500 GeV, gluino\nmasses up to 1550-1750 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on\nthe gluino decay mechanism. For the scenario of direct production of\nsquark-antisquark pairs, top squarks with masses up to 800 GeV are excluded,\nassuming a 100% branching fraction for the decay to a top quark and neutralino.\nSimilarly, bottom squark masses are excluded up to 880 GeV, and masses of\nlight-flavor squarks are excluded up to 600-1260 GeV, depending on the degree\nof degeneracy of the squark masses.\n", "  We study coarse pattern formation in a cellular automaton modelling a\nspatially-extended stochastic neural network. The model, originally proposed by\nGong and Robinson [36], is known to support stationary and travelling bumps of\nlocalised activity. We pose the model on a ring and study the existence and\nstability of these patterns in various limits using a combination of analytical\nand numerical techniques. In a purely deterministic version of the model, posed\non a continuum, we construct bumps and travelling waves analytically using\nstandard interface methods from neural fields theory. In a stochastic version\nwith Heaviside firing rate, we construct approximate analytical probability\nmass functions associated with bumps and travelling waves. In the full\nstochastic model posed on a discrete lattice, where a coarse analytic\ndescription is unavailable, we compute patterns and their linear stability\nusing equation-free methods. The lifting procedure used in the coarse\ntime-stepper is informed by the analysis in the deterministic and stochastic\nlimits. In all settings, we identify the synaptic profile as a mesoscopic\nvariable, and the width of the corresponding activity set as a macroscopic\nvariable. Stationary and travelling bumps have similar meso- and macroscopic\nprofiles, but different microscopic structure, hence we propose lifting\noperators which use microscopic motifs to disambiguate between them. We provide\nnumerical evidence that waves are supported by a combination of high synaptic\ngain and long refractory times, while meandering bumps are elicited by short\nrefractory times.\n", "  FeSe exhibits a novel ground state in which superconductivity coexists with a\nnematic order in the absence of any long-range magnetic order. Here we report\nan angle-resolved photoemission study on the superconducting gap structure in\nthe nematic state of FeSe$_{0.93}$S$_{0.07}$, without the complication caused\nby Fermi surface reconstruction induced by magnetic order. We found that the\nsuperconducting gap shows a pronounced 2-fold anisotropy around the elliptical\nhole pocket near the Z point of the Brillouin zone, with gap minima at the\nendpoints of its major axis, while no detectable gap was observed around the\nzone center and zone corner. The large anisotropy and nodal gap distribution\ndemonstrate the substantial effects of the nematicity on the superconductivity,\nand thus put strong constraints on the current theories.\n", "  Most of the information on our cosmos stems from either late-time\nobservations or the imprint of early-time inhomogeneities on the cosmic\nmicrowave background. We explore to what extent early modifications of gravity,\nwhich become significant after recombination but then decay towards the\npresent, can be constrained by current cosmological observations. For the\nevolution of the gravitational modification, we adopt the decaying mode of a\nhybrid-metric Palatini $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity model which is designed to\nreproduce the standard cosmological background expansion history and due to the\ndecay of the modification is naturally compatible with Solar-System tests. We\nembed the model in the effective field theory description of Horndeski\nscalar-tensor gravity with an early-time decoupling of the gravitational\nmodification. Since the quasistatic approximation for the perturbations in the\nmodel breaks down at high redshifts, where modifications remain relevant, we\nintroduce a computationally efficient correction to describe the evolution of\nthe scalar field fluctuation in this regime. We compare the decaying early-time\nmodification against geometric probes and recent Planck measurements and find\nno evidence for such effects in the observations. Current data constrains the\nscalar field value at $|f_{\\mathcal{R}}(z=z_{\\rm on})| \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for\nmodifications introduced at redshifts $z_{\\rm on}\\sim(500-1000)$ with\npresent-day value $|f_{\\mathcal{R}0}|\\lesssim10^{-8}$. Finally, we comment on\nconstraints that will be achievable with future 21~cm surveys and gravitational\nwave experiments.\n", "  For a system of coupled identical phase oscillators with full permutation\nsymmetry, any broken symmetries in dynamical behaviour must come from\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, i.e. from the nonlinear dynamics of the system.\nThe dynamics of phase differences for such a system depends only on the\ncoupling (phase interaction) function $g(\\varphi)$ and the number of\noscillators $N$. This paper briefly reviews some results for such systems in\nthe case of general coupling $g$ before exploring two cases in detail: (a)\ngeneral two harmonic form:\n$g(\\varphi)=q\\sin(\\varphi-\\alpha)+r\\sin(2\\varphi-\\beta)$ and $N$ small (b) the\ncoupling $g$ is odd or even. We extend previously published bifurcation\nanalyses to the general two harmonic case, and show for even $g$ that the\ndynamics of phase differences has a number of time-reversal symmetries. For the\ncase of even $g$ with one harmonic it is known the system has $N-2$ constants\nof the motion. This is true for $N=4$ and any $g$, while for $N=4$ and more\nthan two harmonics in $g$, we show the system must have fewer independent\nconstants of the motion.\n", "  We address the reliability of the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) in the\ncontext of the 0-dimensional $O(N)$ scalar field model. The effective\npotential, the self-energy and the 1PI four-point Green's function for the\nmodel are computed using different optimization schemes and the results\ncontrasted to the exact results for the model. Our results are also compared to\nthose obtained with the $1/N$-expansion and with those from ordinary\nperturbation theory. The OPT results are shown to be stable even at large\ncouplings and to have better convergence properties than the ones produced in\nthe $1/N$-expansion. It is also shown that the principle of minimal sensitive\noptimization procedure used in conjunction with the OPT method tends to always\nproduce better results, in particular when applied directly to the self-energy.\n", "  The field of the globular cluster NGC 3201 was monitored between 1998 and\n2009 in a search for variable stars. $BV$ light curves were obtained for 152\nperiodic or likely periodic variables, 57 of which are new detections.\nThirty-seven newly detected variables are proper motion members of the cluster.\nAmong them we found seven detached or semi-detached eclipsing binaries, four\ncontact binaries, and eight SX Phe pulsators. Four of the eclipsing binaries\nare located in the turnoff region, one on the lower main sequence and the\nremaining two slightly above the subgiant branch. Two contact systems are blue\nstragglers, and another two reside in the turnoff region. In the blue straggler\nregion a total of 266 objects were found, of which 140 are proper motion (PM)\nmembers of NGC 3201, and another 19 are field stars. Seventy-eight of the\nremaining objects for which we do not have PM data are located within the\nhalf-light radius from the center of the cluster, and most of them are likely\ngenuine blue stragglers. Four variable objects in our field of view were found\nto coincide with X-ray sources: three chromosperically active stars and a\nquasar at a redshift $z\\approx0.5$.\n", "  We show how a scheme of rewriting a divergent momentum integral can\nconciliate results obtained with the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and recent\nlattice results for the chiral transition in the presence of a chiral imbalance\nin quark matter. Purely vacuum contributions are separated from\nmedium-dependent regularized momentum integrals in such a way that one is left\nwith ultraviolet divergent momentum integrals that depend on vacuum quantities\nonly. The scheme is applicable to other commonly used effective models to study\nquark matter with a chiral imbalance, it allows us to identify the source of\ntheir difficulties in reproducing the qualitative features of lattice results,\nand enhances their predictability and uses in other applications.\n", "  Recent measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by the Planck\nCollaboration have produced arguably the most powerful observational evidence\nin support of the standard model of cosmology, i.e. the spatially flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we perform model selection tests to\nexamine whether the base CMB temperature and large scale polarization\nanisotropy data from Planck 2015 (P15) prefer any of eight commonly used\none-parameter model extensions with respect to flat $\\Lambda$CDM. We find a\nclear preference for models with free curvature, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$, or free\namplitude of the CMB lensing potential, $A_\\mathrm{L}$. We also further develop\nstatistical tools to measure tension between datasets. We use a Gaussianization\nscheme to compute tensions directly from the posterior samples using an\nentropy-based method, the surprise, as well as a calibrated evidence ratio\npresented here for the first time. We then proceed to investigate the\nconsistency between the base P15~CMB data and six other CMB and distance\ndatasets. In flat $\\Lambda$CDM we find a $4.8\\sigma$ tension between the base\nP15~CMB data and a distance ladder measurement, whereas the former are\nconsistent with the other datasets. In the curved $\\Lambda$CDM model we find\nsignificant tensions in most of the cases, arising from the well-known low\npower of the low-$\\ell$ multipoles of the CMB data. In the flat $\\Lambda$CDM\n$+A_\\mathrm{L}$ model, however, all datasets are consistent with the base\nP15~CMB observations except for the CMB lensing measurement, which remains in\nsignificant tension. This tension is driven by the increased power of the CMB\nlensing potential derived from the base P15~CMB constraints in both models,\npointing at either potentially unresolved systematic effects or the need for\nnew physics beyond the standard flat $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  We study the impact of the often neglected lensing contribution to galaxy\nnumber counts on the $E_g$ statistics which is used to constrain deviations\nfrom GR. This contribution affects both the galaxy-galaxy and the\nconvergence-galaxy spectra, while it is larger for the latter. At higher\nredshifts probed by upcoming surveys, neglecting this term induces a\nsubstantial error in the spectra and therefore on the $E_g$ statistics which is\nconstructed from the combination of the two. Moreover, including it, renders\nthe $E_g$ statistics scale and bias-dependent and hence puts into question its\nvery objective.\n", "  Alkali-doped fullerides A$_n$C$_{60}$ show a remarkably wide range of\nelectronic phases in function of A= Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs and the degree of doping,\n$n=1-5$. While the presence of strong electron correlations is well\nestablished, recent investigations give also evidence for dynamical Jahn-Teller\ninstability in the insulating and the metallic phase of A$_3$C$_{60}$. To\nreveal the interplay of these interactions in fullerides with even $n$, we\naddress the electronic phase of A$_4$C$_{60}$ with accurate many-body\ncalculations within a realistic electronic model including all basic\ninteractions extracted from first principles. We find that the Jahn-Teller\ninstability is always realized in these materials too. More remarkably, in\nsharp contrast to strongly correlated A$_3$C$_{60}$, A$_4$C$_{60}$ displays\nuncorrelated band-insulating state despite pretty similar interactions present\nin both fullerides. Our results show that the Jahn-Teller instability and the\naccompanying orbital disproportionation of electronic density in the degenerate\nLUMO band is a universal feature of fullerides.\n", "  We discuss the quantum dot-ring nanostructure (DRN) as canonical example of a\nnanosystem, for which the~interelectronic interactions can be evaluated\nexactly. The system has been selected due to its tunability, i.e., its electron\nwave functions can be modified much easier than in, e.g., quantum dots. We\ndetermine many-particle states for $N_e=2$ and $3$ electrons and calculate the\n3- and 4-state interaction parameters, and discuss their importance. For that\npurpose, we combine the first- and second-quantization schemes and hence are\nable to single out the component single-particle contributions to the resultant\nmany-particle state. The method provides both the ground- and the\nfirst-excited-state energies, as the exact diagonalization of the many-particle\nHamiltonian is carried out. DRN provides one of the few examples for which one\ncan determine theoretically all interaction microscopic parameters to a high\naccuracy. Thus the evolution of the single-particle vs. many-particle\ncontributions to each state and its energy can be determined and tested with\nthe increasing system size. In this manner, we contribute to the wave-function\nengineering with the~interactions included for those few-electron systems.\n", "  We present a measurement of the abundance of carbon monoxide in the early\nUniverse, utilizing the final results from the CO Power Spectrum Survey\n(COPSS). Between 2013 and 2015, we performed observations with the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) to measure the aggregate CO emission from\n$z\\sim3$ galaxies with the intensity mapping technique. Data were collected on\n19 fields, covering an area of 0.7 square degrees, over a frequency range of 27\nto 35 GHz. With these data, along with data analyzed in COPSS I, we are able to\nobserve the CO(1-0) transition in the redshift range of $z=2.3-3.3$ for spatial\nfrequencies between $k=0.5-10\\ h\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, spanning a comoving\nvolume of $4.9\\times10^{6}\\ h^{-3}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{3}$. We present estimates of\ncontributions from continuum sources and ground illumination within our\nmeasurement. We constrain the amplitude of the CO power spectrum to be\n$P_{\\textrm{CO}}=3.0_{-1.3}^{+1.3}\\times10^{3}\\ \\mu\\textrm{K}^{2}\n(h^{-1}\\,\\textrm{Mpc})^{3}$, or $\\Delta^{2}_{\\textrm{CO}}(k\\!=\\!1\\\nh\\,\\textrm{Mpc}^{-1})=1.5^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \\times10^{3}\\ \\mu\\textrm{K}^{2}$, at\n68% confidence, and $P_{\\textrm{CO}}>0$ at 98.9% confidence. These results are\na factor of 10 improvement in sensitivity compared to the previous limits set\nin COPSS I. We use this measurement to place constraints on the CO(1-0) galaxy\nluminosity function at $z\\sim3$. We constrain the ratio of CO(1-0) luminosity\nto host halo mass to $A_{\\textrm{CO}}=6.3_{-2.1}^{+1.4}\\times10^{-7}\\\nL_{\\odot}\\ M_{\\odot}^{-1}$, and estimate a mass fraction of molecular gas of\n$f_{\\textrm{H}_{2}}=5.5^{+3.4}_{-2.2}\\times10^{-2}$ for halos with masses of\norder $10^{12}M_{\\odot}$. Using simple theoretical estimates for the scaling of\nmolecular gas mass fraction and halo mass, we estimate the global density of\nmolecular gas to be\n$\\rho_{z\\sim3}(\\textrm{H}_{2})=1.1_{-0.4}^{+0.7}\\times10^{8}\\ M_{\\odot}\\\n\\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}$.\n", "  Approximate empirical models of thermal convection can allow us to identify\nthe essential properties of the flow in simplified form, and to produce\nempirical estimates using only a few parameters. Such \"low-dimensional\"\nempirical models can be constructed systematically by writing numerical or\nexperimental measurements as superpositions of a set of appropriate basis\nmodes, a process known as Galerkin projection. For three-dimensional convection\nin a cylinder, those basis modes should be vector-valued, mutually orthogonal,\nand defined in cylindrical coordinates. Here we construct such a basis set and\ndemonstrate that it has these desired properties and boundary conditions when\nthe exact constraint of incompressibility is relaxed. We show its use for\nrepresenting sample simulation data and point out its potential for\nlow-dimensional convection models.\n", "  We show from theoretical considerations, that if the graviton is massive, its\nmass is constrained to be about $10^{-32}~eV/c^2$. This estimate is consistent\nwith those obtained from experiments, including the recent gravitational wave\ndetection in advanced LIGO.\n", "  We extend our treatment of the the spectroscopy and decays of the\ncharm-strange quarkonium system to include the effect of using the full\nthree-loop QCD correction to the static short distance potential. As before,\nour potential model consists of the relativistic kinetic energy term, a scalar\nlinear confining term including its relativistic corrections and the\nperturbative QCD spin-dependent terms. A set of unperturbed wave functions for\nthe various states is obtained using a variational technique that is further\nconstrained by requiring that the wave functions also satisfy the relativistic\nvirial theorem. These are then used in a perturbative treatment of the\npotential to fit the mass spectrum of the $c\\bar{s}$ system and calculate the\nradiative decay widths. Our results accurately describe the $D_s$ spectrum and\nare compatible with the little data that is available for the radiative decays\nof the $D_s$ states.\n", "  Precision cosmology has recently triggered new attention on the topic of\napproximate methods for the clustering of matter on large scales, whose\nfoundations date back to the period from late '60s to early '90s. Indeed,\nalthough the prospect of reaching sub-percent accuracy in the measurement of\nclustering poses a challenge even to full N-body simulations, an accurate\nestimation of the covariance matrix of clustering statistics, not to mention\nthe sampling of parameter space, requires usage of a large number (hundreds in\nthe most favourable cases) of simulated (mock) galaxy catalogs. Combination of\nfew N-body simulations with a large number of realizations performed with\napproximate methods gives the most promising approach to solve these problems\nwith a reasonable amount of resources. In this paper I review this topic,\nstarting from the foundations of the methods, then going through the pioneering\nefforts of the '90s, and finally presenting the latest extensions and a few\ncodes that are now being used in present-generation surveys and thoroughly\ntested to assess their performance in the context of future surveys.\n", "  Song and dance are a traditional means of strengthening culture and passing\nknowledge to successive generations in the Torres Strait of northeastern\nAustralia. Dances incorporate a range of apparatuses to enhance the\nperformance, such as dance machines (Zamiyakal) and headdresses (Dhari). The\ndances, songs, headdresses and dance machines work together to transfer\nimportant knowledge about subsistence survival, social structure, and cultural\ncontinuity. This paper explores how celestial phenomena inspire and inform\nmusic and dance.\n", "  The Kuramoto-Sakaguchi system of coupled phase oscillators, where interaction\nbetween oscillators is determined by a single harmonic of phase differences of\npairs of oscillators, has very simple emergent dynamics in the case of\nidentical oscillators that are globally coupled: there is a variational\nstructure that means the only attractors are full synchrony (in-phase) or splay\nphase (rotating wave/full asynchrony) oscillations and the bifurcation between\nthese states is highly degenerate. Here we show that nonpairwise coupling -\nincluding three and four-way interactions of the oscillator phases - that\nappears generically at the next order in normal-form based calculations, can\ngive rise to complex emergent dynamics in symmetric phase oscillator networks.\nIn particular, we show that chaos can appear in the smallest possible dimension\nof four coupled phase oscillators for a range of parameter values.\n", "  A parallel reservoir simulator has been developed, which is designed for\nlarge-scale black oil simulations. It handles three phases, including water,\noil and gas, and three components, including water, oil and gas. This simulator\ncan calculate traditional reservoir models and naturally fractured models.\nVarious well operations are supported, such as water flooding, gas flooding and\npolymer flooding. The operation constraints can be fixed bottom-hole pressure,\na fixed fluid rate, and combinations of them. The simulator is based on our\nin-house platform, which provides grids, cell-centred data, linear solvers,\npreconditioners and well modeling. The simulator and the platform use MPI for\ncommunications among computation nodes. Our simulator is capable of simulating\ngiant reservoir models with hundreds of millions of grid cells. Numerical\nsimulations show that our simulator matches with commercial simulators and it\nhas excellent scalability.\n", "  In recent quantum optical continuous-variable experiments, the number of\nfully inseparable light modes has drastically increased by introducing a\nmultiplexing scheme either in the time domain or in the frequency domain. Here,\nmodifying the time-domain multiplexing experiment reported in Nature Photonics\n7, 982 (2013), we demonstrate successive generation of fully inseparable light\nmodes for more than one million modes. The resulting multi-mode state is useful\nas a dual-rail CV cluster state. We circumvent the previous problem of optical\nphase drifts, which has limited the number of fully inseparable light modes to\naround ten thousands, by continuous feedback control of the optical system.\n", "  We report on magneto-transport studies of dual-gated, Bernal-stacked trilayer\ngraphene (TLG) encapsulated in boron nitride crystals. We observe a quantum\nHall effect staircase which indicates a complete lifting of the twelve-fold\ndegeneracy of the zeroth Landau level. As a function of perpendicular electric\nfield, our data exhibits a sequence of phase transitions between all integer\nquantum Hall states in the filling factor interval $-8<\\nu<0$. We develop a\ntheoretical model and argue that, in contrast to monolayer and bilayer\ngraphene, the observed Landau level splittings and quantum Hall phase\ntransitions can be understood within a single-particle picture, but imply the\npresence of a charge density imbalance between the inner and outer layers of\nTLG, even at charge neutrality and zero transverse electric field. Our results\nindicate the importance of a previously unaccounted band structure parameter\nwhich, together with a more accurate estimate of the other tight-binding\nparameters, results in a significantly improved determination of the electronic\nand Landau level structure of TLG.\n", "  Systems of neutral kaons can be used to observe entanglement and the\nviolation of Bell inequalities. The decay of these particles poses some\nproblems, however, and recently an effective formalism for treating such\nsystems has been derived. We generalize this formalism and make it applicable\nto other quantum systems that can be made to behave in a similar manner. As\nexamples, we discuss two possible implementations of the generalized formalism\nusing trapped ions such as $^{171}$Yb or $^{172}$Yb, which may be used to\nsimulate kaonic behavior in a quantum optical system.\n", "  We present a ring aperture with independently switchable segments for the\nthree-dimensional control of quasi propagation invariant beams. We demonstrate\nthat our liquid crystal design concept preserves coherence and generates the\nBessel beam structure.\n", "  Formation energies, charge transitions levels, and quasiparticle defect\nstates of the tellurium antisite $(\\text{Te}_\\text{Cd})$ in CdTe are addressed\nwithin the DFT${0.05cm}+{0.05cm}$\\emph{GW} formalism. We find that\n$(\\text{Te}_\\text{Cd})$ induces a (+2/0) deep level at 0.99 eV above the\nvalence band maximum, exhibiting a negative-U effect. Moreover, the calculated\nzero-phonon line for the excited state of $(\\text{Te}_\\text{Cd})^0$ corresponds\nclosely with the $\\sim$1.1 eV band, visible in luminescence and absorption\nexperiments. Our results differ from previous theoretical studies, mainly due\nto the well-known band gap error and the incorrect position of the band edges\npredicted by standard DFT calculations.\n", "  We study, by incorporating short-range ion-surface interactions, ionic\nprofiles of electrolyte solutions close to a non-charged interface between two\ndielectric media. In order to account for important correlation effects close\nto the interface, the ionic profiles are calculated beyond mean-field theory,\nusing the loop expansion of the free energy. We show how it is possible to\novercome the well-known deficiency of the regular loop expansion close to the\ndielectric jump, and treat the non-linear boundary conditions within the\nframework of field theory. The ionic profiles are obtained analytically to\none-loop order in the free energy, and their dependence on different\nion-surface interactions is investigated. The Gibbs adsorption isotherm, as\nwell as the ionic profiles are used to calculate the surface tension, in\nagreement with the reverse Hofmeister series. Consequently, from the\nexperimentally-measured surface tension, one can extract a single adhesivity\nparameter, which can be used within our model to quantitatively predict hard to\nmeasure ionic profiles.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally the operation of a deterministic Josephson\nratchet with tunable asymmetry. The ratchet is based on a $\\varphi$ Josephson\njunction with a ferromagnetic barrier operating in the underdamped regime. The\nsystem is probed also under the action of an additional dc current, which acts\nas a counter force trying to stop the ratchet. Under these conditions the\nratchet works against the counter force, thus producing a non-zero output\npower. Finally, we estimate the efficiency of the $\\varphi$ Josephson junction\nratchet.\n", "  In this first of a series of papers, we utilize results for around two\nthousand star cluster models simulated using the MOCCA code for star cluster\nevolution (Survey Database I) to determine the astrophysical properties and\nlocal merger rate densities for coalescing binary black holes (BBHs)\noriginating from globular clusters (GCs). We extracted information for all\ncoalescing BBHs that escape the cluster models and subsequently merge within a\nHubble time along with BBHs that are retained in our GC models and merge inside\nthe cluster via gravitational wave (GW) emission. By obtaining results from a\nsubstantial number of realistic star cluster models that cover different\ninitial parameters, we have an extremely large statistical sample of BBHs with\nstellar mass and massive stellar BH ($\\lesssim 100M_{\\odot}$) components that\nmerge within a Hubble time. Using this data, we estimate local merger rate\ndensities for these BBHs originating from GCs to be at least 5.4 ${\\rm\nGpc}^{-3}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$\n", "  Solid state-refrigerants have generated worldwide interest owing to their\ngrowing potential for use in efficient and green cooling devices. Caloric\neffects could be obtained by manipulating their degrees of freedom such as\nmagnetization, electric polarization and volume using a variable external\nfield. In conventional magnetocaloric refrigeration systems, the magnetocaloric\neffect is exploited by moving the active material in and out of the magnetic\nfield source. Here we demonstrate that a giant and reversible magnetocaloric\neffect can be generated simply by rotating the multiferroic TbMn2O5 single\ncrystal around its b axis in a relatively low constant magnetic field applied\nin the ac plane. For a magnetic field applied along the easy axis a, we report\nan entropy change of 12.25 J/kg K at about 10 K in a field change of 5 T which\nis 100 times larger than that found when the field is applied along the hard\naxis c. When the TbMn2O5 is rotated with the field remaining in the ac plane,\nthe associated adiabatic temperature change reaches minimum values of 8 K and\n14 K under 2 T and 5 T, respectively. This giant rotating magnetocaloric effect\nin TbMn2O5 is caused by the colossal anisotropy of the entropy change, the\nenhancement of the magnetization under relatively moderate magnetic fields and\nthe lower magnitude of specific heat. On the other hand, the application of the\ncoherent rotational model demonstrates that the rotating magnetocaloric effect\nexhibited by TbMn2O5 does not originate directly from the magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy. Our results should inspire and open new ways toward the\nimplementation of compact, efficient and embedded magnetocaloric devices for\nlow temperature and space application. Its potential operating temperature\nrange of 2 to 30 K makes it a great candidate for the liquefaction of hydrogen.\n", "  It was reported that Kerr-Newman black holes can support linear charged\nscalar fields in their exterior regions. These stationary massive charged\nscalar fields can form bound states, which are called stationary scalar clouds.\nIn this paper, we show that Kerr-Sen black holes can also support stationary\nmassive charged scalar clouds by matching the near- and far-region solutions of\nthe radial part of the Klein-Gordon wave equation. We also review stationary\nscalar clouds within the background of static electrically charged black hole\nsolutions in the low-energy limit of heterotic string field theory, namely, the\nGibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes.\n", "  The search for the left-handed $W^{\\pm}$ bosons, the proposed quanta of the\nweak interaction, and the Higgs boson, which spontaneously breaks the symmetry\nof unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions, has driven\nelementary-particle physics research from the time that I entered college to\nthe present and has led to many unexpected and exciting discoveries which\nrevolutionized our view of subnuclear physics over that period. In this article\nI describe how these searches and discoveries have intertwined with my own\ncareer.\n", "  The analytical treatment of the Greens function in the convergent\nclose-coupling method [Bray et al. Comp. Phys. Comm. 203 147 (2016)] has been\nextended to charged targets. Furthermore, we show that this approach allows for\ncalculation of cross sections at zero channel energy. For neutral targets this\nmeans the electron scattering length may be obtained from a single calculation\nwith zero incident energy. For charged targets the non-zero excitation cross\nsections at thresholds can also be calculated by simply setting the incident\nenergy to the exact threshold value. These features are demonstrated by\nconsidering electron scattering on H and He+.\n", "  Molecular electronics originally proposed that small molecules sandwiched\nbetween electrodes would accomplish electronic functions and enable to reach\nultimate scaling. However, so far, functional molecular devices have been only\ndemonstrated at low frequency. Here, we demonstrate molecular diodes operating\nup to 17.8 GHz. DC (direct current) and RF (radio frequency) properties were\nsimultaneously measured on a large array of molecular junctions composed of\ngold nanocrystal electrodes, ferrocenyl undecanethiol molecules, and the tip of\nan interferometric scanning microwave microscope. The present nanometer-scale\nmolecular diodes offer a current density increase by several orders of\nmagnitude compared to that of micrometer-scale molecular diodes, allowing RF\noperation. The measured S11 parameters show a diode rectification ratio of 12\ndB which is linked to the rectification behavior of the DC conductance. From\nthe RF measurements, we extrapolate a cut-off frequency of 520 GHz. A\ncomparison with the silicon RFSchottky diodes architecture suggests that the\nRF-molecular diodes are extremely attractive for scaling and high-frequency\noperation.\n", "  Electron transport is studied in surface oxidized single-crystal copper thin\nfilms with a thickness of up to 5.6 nm by applying density functional theory\nand density functional tight binding methods to determine electron transport\nproperties within the ballistic regime. The variation of the electron\ntransmission as a function of film thickness as well as the different\ncontributions to the overall electron transmission as a function of depth into\nthe the films is examined. Transmission at the oxidized copper film surfaces is\nfound to be universally low. Films with thickness greater than 2.7 nm exhibit a\nsimilar behavior in local transmission per unit area with depth from the film\nsurface; transmission per unit area initially increases rapidly and then\nplateaus at a depth of approximately 0.35-0.5 nm away from the surface,\ndependent on surface facet. Unstrained films tend to exhibit a higher\ntransmission per unit area than corresponding films under tensile strain.\n", "  McGaugh et al. (2016) have used their extensive SPARC sample to update the\nwell-known mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation (MDAR), which is one of the\nmajor predicted \"MOND laws\". This is not a newly discovered relation. Rather,\nit improves on the many previous studies of it, with more and better data. Like\nits precedents, it bears crucial ramifications for the observed dynamical\nanomalies in disc galaxies, and, in particular, on their resolution by the MOND\nparadigm. Their result, indeed, constitute a triumph for MOND. However, unlike\nprevious analyses of the MDAR, McGaugh et al. have chosen to obfuscate the MOND\nroots of their analysis, and its connection with, and implications for, this\nparadigm. For example, the fitting formula they use, seemingly as a result of\nsome unexplained inspiration, follows in its salient properties from the basic\ntenets of MOND, and has already been used in the past in several MOND analyses.\nNo other possible origin for such a function is known. Given that this formula\nhad already been shown to reproduce correctly the observed rotation curves from\nthe baryon distribution (as a MOND effect), it must have been clear, a priory,\nthat it should describe correctly the MDAR, which is but a summary of rotation\ncurves. The present paper corrects these oversights -- bringing to light the\ndeep connections with MOND, suppressed by McGaugh et al. It also gives due\ncredit to previous works, and discusses some new, important, but less known,\naspects of this MOND relation. (Substantially abridged.)\n", "  An extremely scalable linear-algebraic algorithm was developed for quantum\nmaterial simulation (electronic state calculation) with 10$^8$ atoms or\n100-nm-scale materials. The mathematical foundation is generalized shifted\nlinear equations ((zB - A) x = b), instead of conventional generalized\neigenvalue equations. The method has a highly parallelizable mathematical\nstructure. The fundamental theory is mathematical and is applicable also to\nother scientific fields. The benchmark shows an extreme strong scaling and a\nqualified time-to-solution on the full system of the K computer. The method was\ndemonstrated in a real material research for ultra-flexible (organic) devices,\nkey devices of next-generation IoT products. The present paper shows that an\ninnovative scalable algorithm for a real research can appear by the co-design\namong application, algorithm and architecture.\n", "  We emphasize that noncommutative (NC) spacetime necessarily implies emergent\nspacetime if spacetime at microscopic scales should be viewed as NC. In order\nto understand NC spacetime correctly, we need to deactivate the thought\npatterns that we have installed in our brains and taken for granted for so many\nyears. Emergent spacetime allows a background-independent formulation of\nquantum gravity that will open a new perspective to resolve the notorious\nproblems in theoretical physics such as the cosmological constant problem,\nhierarchy problem, dark energy, dark matter, and cosmic inflation.\n", "  Little Higgs Models are a possible elegant solution to the hierarchy problem\non the Higgs mass. As they predict naturally small deviations with respect to\nSM results, they are in agreement with all current experimental data. In this\ncontribution, we review lepton flavor violation in the Simplest Little Higgs\nmodel focusing on semileptonic lepton flavor violating tau decays (where some\nnew results are presented) and $H\\to\\ell\\ell'$. Within this model, the most\npromising decay channels for discovering lepton flavor violation are $\\mu\\to e$\nconversion in nuclei, $\\mu\\to e\\gamma^{(*)}$, $\\tau\\to (e/\\mu)\\gamma$ and\n$\\tau\\to (e/\\mu) (\\pi^+\\pi^-/\\rho)$.\n", "  The basic prototype of a tile hadron calorimeter (HCAL) for the International\nLinear Collider (ILC) has been realised and extensively tested. A major aspect\nof the proposed concept is the improvement of the jet energy resolution by\nmeasuring details of the shower development and combining them with the data of\nthe tracking system (particle flow). The prototype utilises scintillating tiles\nthat are read out by novel Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and takes into\naccount all design aspects that are demanded by the intended operation at the\nILC. Currently, a new 12 layer prototype with about 3400 detector channels is\nunder development. Alternative architectures for the scintillating tiles with\nand without wavelength-shifting fibres and tiles with individual wrapping with\nreflector foil is tested as well as different types of SiPMs. The new prototype\nwas used for the first time at the CERN Proton Synchrotron test facility in\nfall 2014. Additionally, detector modules for the CALICE scintillator-based\nElectromagnetic Calorimeter (Sc-ECAL), that follow the proposed HCAL\nelectronics architecture, were part of this new prototype. A new multi-layer\nData Acquisition System (DAQ) was used for the detector configuration and\noperation.\n", "  Reputation plays a major role in human societies, and it has been proposed as\nan explanation for the evolution of cooperation. While the majority of previous\nstudies equates reputation with a transparent and complete history of players'\npast decisions, in real life, reputations are often ambiguous and opaque. Using\nweb-based experiments, we explore the extent to which opaque reputation works\nin isolating defectors, with and without partner selection opportunities. Our\nresults show that low reputation works as a signal of untrustworthiness,\nwhereas medium or high reputation are not taken into account by participants\nfor orienting their choices. We also find that reputation without partner\nselection does not promote cooperative behavior; that is, defectors do not turn\ninto cooperators only for the sake of getting a positive reputation. Finally,\nin a third study, we find that, when reputation is pivotal to selection, then a\nsubstantial proportion of would-be-defectors turn into cooperators. Taken\ntogether, these results provide insights on the characteristics of reputation\nand on the way in which humans make use of it when selecting partners but also\nwhen knowing that they will be selected.\n", "  The Kepler space telescope has revolutionised our knowledge about exoplanets\nand stars and is continuing to do so in the K2 mission. The exquisite\nphotometric precision, together with the long, uninterrupted observations\nopened up a new way to investigate the structure and evolution of stars.\nAsteroseismology, the study of stellar oscillations, allowed us to investigate\nsolar-like stars and to peer into the insides of red giants and massive stars.\nBut many discoveries have been made about classical variable stars too, ranging\nfrom pulsators like Cepheids and RR Lyraes to eclipsing binary stars and\ncataclysmic variables, and even supernovae. In this review, which is far from\nan exhaustive summary of all results obtained with Kepler, we collected some of\nthe most interesting discoveries, and ponder on the role for amateur observers\nin this golden era of stellar astrophysics.\n", "  In this paper we report on the implementation and stability analysis of a\ndrift-compensated frequency synthesizer from a cryogenic sapphire oscillator\n(CSO) designed for a Cs/Rb atomic fountain clock. The synthesizer has two\nmicrowave outputs of 7 GHz and 9 GHz for Rb and Cs atom interrogation,\nrespectively. The short-term stability of these microwave signals, measured\nusing an optical frequency comb locked to an ultra-stable laser, is better than\n$5\\times10^{-15}$ at an averaging time of 1 s. We demonstrate that the\nshort-term stability of the synthesizer is lower than the quantum projection\nnoise limit of the Cs fountain clock, KRISS-F1(Cs) by measuring the short-term\nstability of the fountain with varying trapped atom number. The stability of\nthe fountain at 1-s averaging time reaches $2.5\\times10^{-14}$ at the highest\natom number in the experiment when the synthesizer is used as an interrogation\noscillator of the fountain. In order to compensate the frequency drift of the\nCSO, the output frequency of a waveform generator in the synthesis chain is\nramped linearly. By doing this, the stability of the synthesizer at an average\ntime of one hour reaches a level of $10^{-16}$ which is measured with the\nfountain clock.\n", "  We present a method incorporating biorthogonal orbital-optimization, symmetry\nprojection, and double-occupancy screening with a non-unitary similarity\ntransformation generated by the Gutzwiller factor $\nn_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}$, and apply it to the Hubbard model. Energies are\ncalculated with mean-field computational scaling with high-quality results\ncomparable to coupled cluster singles and doubles. This builds on previous work\nperforming similarity transformations with more general, two-body Jastrow-style\ncorrelators. The theory is tested on two-dimensional lattices ranging from\nsmall systems into the thermodynamic limit and is compared to available\nreference data.\n", "  We report on the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of a MnRhAs single\ncrystal. The ternary arsenide exhibits a rather complex magnetic behaviour. A\nfirst order metamagnetic type transition from antiferromagnetic (AFI) to\nferromagnetic (F) states takes place at Tt ~ 158 K, and a second order\ntransition from ferromagnetic (F) to antiferromagnetic (AFII) states occurs at\nTC ~196 K, the paramagnetic state occurring at T > TN = 238 K. Magnetic entropy\nchanges were calculated using, Maxwell relation and Clausius-Clapeyron\nequation. Both approaches are compared and discussed. The AFI-F transition in\nMnRhAs gives rise to an interestingly high level of negative magnetocaloric\neffect. Under a field change 0-1 T, the maximum magnetic entropy variation is\nabout 3 J/kg K. For sufficiently high enough magnetic fields, the\nmagnetocaloric working temperature range below 158 K can be covered. The F-AFII\ntransition is accompanied by a relatively modest MCE (-2.3 J/kg K for 5 T at TC\n= 196 K), but it improves the working temperature span as well as the\nmagnetocaloric properties. A minimum estimated refrigerant capacity of about\n900 J/kg can be provided by a MnRhAs single crystal compound\n", "  We have analyzed two mechanisms proposed recently for superconductivity in\ndoped SrTiO3 - the plasmon-mediated pairing and the potential of an\ninstantaneous attraction between two electrons that owes its origin to the\nexchange by high-frequency optical phonons. The first approach seems to be\nself-consistent, but in a limited range of the dielectric constant. As to the\ndirect instantaneous interaction between two electrons,it was hypothesized as\ndue to the exchange by the band LO phonons. The latter supposition was\nincorrect. In the current paper, it shows that the contributions into the\npairing matrix element possessing the structure of a net attraction come about\nonly as the result of disorder. Indeed, the experiment revealed the mobility\nedge in doped SrTiO3. Doped electrons occupying states with the energy below\nthe mobility edge are localized on dopants thereby become strongly coupled with\nthe lattice vibrations. The emergence of the localized phonon modes attached to\ndefect is one of the results of such electron-lattice coupling. For two\nelectrons in the conduction band the virtual exchange by the quantum of such\nlocal mode manifests itself as the effective attraction. The total contribution\ninto the pairing matrix element from these processes, increasing with\nconcentration can overwhelm the Coulomb repulsion screened by the band LO\nphonons. That is, the role previously ascribed to the band LO phonons actually\nbelongs to the localized phonons.\n", "  Characteristic quantities such as the penetration and preformation\nprobabilities, assault frequency and tunneling times in the tunneling\ndescription of alpha decay of heavy nuclei are explored to reveal their\nsensitivity to neutron numbers in the vicinity of the magic neutron number $N$\n= 126. Using realistic nuclear potentials, the sensitivity of these quantities\nto the parameters of the theoretical approach is also tested. An investigation\nof the region from $N=116$ to $N=132$ in Po nuclei reveals that the tunneling\n$\\alpha$ particle spends the least amount of time with an $N=126$ magic\ndaughter nucleus. The shell closure at $N=126$ seems to affect the behaviour of\nthe dwell times of the tunneling alpha particles and this occurs through the\ninfluence of the $Q$-values involved.\n", "  We study the kernel/metric correspondence pointed out in our previous work in\na dissipative system which is accompanying fractional Brownian motion. We also\ngive some comments on information causality.\n", "  Resonant accelerating cavities are key components in modern particles\naccelerating facilities. These take advantage of electromagnetic fields\nresonating at microwave frequencies to accelerate charged particles. Particles\ngain finite energy at each passage through a cavity if in phase with the\nresonating field, reaching energies even of the order of $TeV$ when a cascade\nof accelerating resonators are present. In order to understand how a resonant\naccelerating cavity transfers energy to charged particles, it is important to\ndetermine how the electromagnetic modes are exited into such resonators. In\nthis paper we present a complete analytical calculation of the resonating\nfields for a simple cylindrical-shaped cavity.\n", "  Recent research has shown that motile cells can adapt their mode of\npropulsion depending on the environment in which they find themselves. One mode\nis swimming by blebbing or other shape changes, and in this paper we analyze a\nclass of models for movement of cells by blebbing and of nano- robots in a\nviscous fluid at low Reynolds number. At the level of individuals, the shape\nchanges comprise volume exchanges between connected spheres that can control\ntheir separation, which are simple enough that significant analytical results\ncan be obtained. The goal is to understand how the efficiency of move- ment\ndepends on the amplitude and period of the volume exchanges when the spheres\napproach closely during a cycle. Previous analyses were predicated on wide\nseparation, and we show that the speed in- creases significantly as the\nseparation decreases due to the strong hydrodynamic interactions between\nspheres in close proximity. The scallop theorem asserts that at least two\ndegrees of freedom are needed to produce net motion in a cyclic sequence of\nshape changes, and we show that these degrees can reside in different swimmers\nwhose collective motion is studied. We also show that different combinations of\nmode sharing can lead to significant differences in the translation and\nperformance of pairs of swimmers.\n", "  We develop and present a unified multi-scale model (involving three scales of\nspatial organisation) to study the dynamics of rigid aggregating particles\nsuspended in a viscous fluid medium and subject to a steady poiseuille flow. At\nmicro-level, the theory of adhesion describing the attachment / detachment\nkinetics of two rigid spheres coated with binding ligands, is utilized to\ndescribe the collision frequency function. The meso-scale dynamics is outlined\nthrough a continuous general dynamic equation governing the time rate of change\nof the particle size distribution function. The micro-meso coupling is achieved\nvia the balancing of the mesoscale drag forces and couples with the micro-scale\nforces associated with the binder kinetics. Inside the macro domain (i.e., a\nlong pipe), the model is equation free and divided into equal sized patches.\nThe macroscale solution within each patch is obtained via appropriate\n(extrapolatory) coupling and amplitude conditions.\n", "  In order to reduce the computational cost of the simulation of\nelectromagnetic responses in geophysical settings that involve highly\nheterogeneous media, we develop a multiscale finite volume method with\noversampling for the quasi-static Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain.\nWe assume a coarse mesh nested within a fine mesh that accurately discretizes\nthe problem. For each coarse cell, we independently solve a local version of\nthe original Maxwell's system subject to linear boundary conditions on an\nextended domain, which includes the coarse cell and a neighborhood of fine\ncells around it. The local Maxwell's system is solved using the fine mesh\ncontained in the extended domain and the mimetic finite volume method. Next,\nthese local solutions (basis functions) together with a weak-continuity\ncondition are used to construct a coarse-mesh version of the global problem.\nThe basis functions can be used to obtain the fine-mesh details from the\nsolution of the coarse-mesh problem. Our approach leads to a significant\nreduction in the size of the final system of equations and the computational\ntime, while accurately approximating the behavior of the fine-mesh solutions.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our method using a synthetic 3D example of a\nmineral deposit.\n", "  A simple and flexible technique for achieving quasi-phase-matching in\nintegrated photonic waveguides without periodic poling is proposed and\nexperimentally demonstrated, referred to as mode-shape-modulation (MSM). It\nemploys a periodic variation of waveguide width to modulate the intensity of\nthe pump wave, effectively suppressing out-of-phase light generation. This\ntechnique is applied to the case of second-harmonic generation in thin-film\nlithium niobate ridge waveguides. MSM waveguides are fabricated and\ncharacterized with pulsed-pumping in the near-infrared, showing harmonic\ngeneration at a signal wavelength of 784 nm.\n", "  A klystron beam focusing system using permanent magnets, which increases\nreliability in comparison with electromagnet focusing system, is reported. A\nprototype model has been designed and fabricated for a 1.3 GHz, 800 kW klystron\nfor evaluation of the feasibility of the focusing system with permanent\nmagnets. In order to decrease the production cost and to mitigate complex\ntuning processes of the magnetic field, anisotropic ferrite magnet is adopted\nas the magnetic material. As the result of a power test, 798 kW peak output\npower was successfully achieved with the prototype focusing system. Considering\na power consumption of the electromagnet focusing system, the required\nwall-plug power to produce nominal 800 kW output power with the permanent\nmagnet system is less than that with electromagnet. However, the power\nconversion efficiency of the klystron with the permanent magnet system was\nfound to be limited by transverse multipole magnetic fields. By decreasing\ntransverse multipole magnetic field components, especially the dipole and the\nquadrupole, the power conversion efficiency would approach to that with\nelectromagnets.\n", "  The UED (ultrafast electron diffraction) beamline of the KAERI's (the Korea\nAtomic Energy Research Institute's) WCI (World Class Institute) Center has been\nsuccessfully commissioned. We have measured the beam emittance by using the\nquadrupole scan technique and the charge by using a novel measurement system we\nhave developed. In the quadrupole scan, a larger drift distance between the\nquadrupole and the screen is preferred because it gives a better thin-lens\napproximation. A high bunch-charge beam, however, will undergo emittance growth\nin the long drift caused by the space-charge force. We present a method that\nmitigates this growth by introducing a quadrupole scan with a short drift and\nwithout using the thin-lens approximation. The quadrupole in this method is\ntreated as a thick lens, and the emittance is extracted by using the thick-lens\nequations. Apart from being precise, our method can be readily applied without\nmaking any change to the beamline and has no need for a big drift space. For\ncharge measurement, we have developed a system consisting of an in-air Faraday\ncup (FC) and a preamplifier. Tests performed utilizing 3.3-MeV electrons show\nthat the system was able to measure bunches with pulse durations of tens of\nfemtoseconds at 10 fC sensitivity.\n", "  Light fields with extraordinary propagation behaviours such as nondiffracting\nand self-bending are useful in optical delivery for energy, information, and\neven objects. A kind of helical beams is constructed here based on the caustic\nmethod. With appropriate design, the main lobe of these helical beams can be\nboth well-confined and almost nondiffracting while moving along a helix with\nits radius, period, the number of rotations and main lobes highly adjustable.\nIn addition, the main lobe contains almost half of the optical power and the\npeak intensity fluctuates below 15% during propagation. These promising\ncharacteristics may enable a variety of potential applications based on these\nbeams.\n", "  We report on a new ZEUS search for a narrow state decaying into\n$p(\\bar{p})K^0_S$, which was previously claimed by the ZEUS collaboration. In\nthe present search, which uses much increased statistics, no evidence for this\nstate is found. Limits on the cross section for such a state are given.\n", "  Two-dimensional electron systems found at the interface of SrTiO3-based oxide\nheterostructures often display anisotropic electric transport whose origin is\ncurrently under debate. To characterize transport along specific\ncrystallographic directions, we developed a hard-mask patterning routine based\non an amorphous CeO2 template layer. The technique allows preparing\nwell-defined microbridges by conventional ultraviolet photolithography which,\nin comparison to standard techniques such as ion- or wet-chemical etching, does\nnot induce any degradation of interfacial conductance. The patterning scheme is\ndescribed in details and the successful production of microbridges based on\namorphous Al2O3-SrTiO3 heterostructures is demonstrated. Significant\nanisotropic transport is observed for T < 30 K which is mainly related to\nimpurity/defect scattering of charge carriers in these heterostructures.\n", "  We present our latest results on the solar-stellar connection by studying 18\nsolar analogs that we identified among the Kepler seismic sample (Salabert et\nal., 2016a). We measured their magnetic activity properties using observations\ncollected by the Kepler satellite and the ground-based, high-resolution Hermes\nspectrograph. The photospheric (Sph) and chromospheric (S) magnetic activity\nproxies of these seismic solar analogs are compared in relation to solar\nactivity. We show that the activity of the Sun is actually comparable to the\nactivity of the seismic solar analogs. Furthermore, we report on the discovery\nof temporal variability in the acoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old)\nsolar analog KIC10644253 with a modulation of about 1.5 years, which agrees\nwith the derived photospheric activity (Salabert et al., 2016b). It could\nactually be the signature of the short-period modulation, or quasi-biennal\noscillation, of its magnetic activity as observed in the Sun and the 1-Gyr-old\nsolar analog HD30495. In addition, the lithium abundance and the chromospheric\nactivity estimated from Hermes confirms that KIC10644253 is a young and more\nactive star than the Sun.\n", "  After birth setting up an effective immune system is a major challenge for\nall living organisms. In this paper we show that this process can be explored\nby using the age-specific infant death rate as a kind of sensor. This is made\npossible because, as shown by the authors in Berrut et al. (2016), between\nbirth and a critical age t_c, for all mammals the death rate decreases with age\nas an hyperbolic function. For humans t_c is equal to 10 years. At some ages\nthe hyperbolic fall displays spikes which, it is assumed, correspond to\nspecific events in the organism's response to exogenous factors. One of these\nspikes occurs 10 days after birth and there is another at the age of about 300\ndays. It is shown that the first spike is related to viral infections whereas\nthe second is related to bacterial diseases. By going back to former time\nperiods during which infant mortality was much higher than currently, it is\npossible to get a magnified view of these peaks which in turn may give us\nuseful information about how an organism adapts to new conditions. Apart from\npathogens, the same methodology can be used to study the response to changes in\nother external conditions, e.g. supply of food, temperature or oxygen level.\n", "  Space photometry has revealed rich pulsation spectra in classical Be stars.\nOften frequency pairs can be found that differ by nearly the frequency of a\nthird genuine stellar variability. The lowest currently known of these\nso-called difference (or $\\Delta$) frequencies reach 0.03 c/d, which is the\nupper limit of outburst frequencies. The potential of such slow variations for\npulsation-assisted mass loss is discussed.\n", "  Transmission electron microscopy has been a promising candidate for mapping\natomic orbitals for a long time. Here, we explore its capabilities by a first\nprinciples approach. For the example of defected graphene, exhibiting either an\nisolated vacancy or a substitutional nitrogen atom, we show that three\ndifferent kinds of images are to be expected, depending on the orbital\ncharacter. To judge the feasibility of visualizing orbitals in a real\nmicroscope, the effect of the optics aberrations is simulated. We demonstrate\nthat, by making use of energy-filtering, it should indeed be possible to map\natomic orbitals in a state-of-the-art transmission electron microscope.\n", "  Solution-processed organic photovoltaics (OPV) have recently reached the\ntarget 10% power conversion efficiency expected to signal their viable\ncommercialization as an inexpensive and scalable energy conversion technology.\nHowever, obtaining devices with suitable long-term stability remains an\nunsolved challenge. Here we present a new strategy to improve the thermal\nstability of small-molecule-based bulk-heterojunction OPVs by including a\ncustom additive specifically designed to interact with the device active layer\ncomponents. Our results indicate that active layer degradation under continuous\nthermal stress can be inhibited due to the formation of more robust thin film\nmicrostructure with the additive present. Since our additive employs the\nidentical semiconductor core used in the active layer, but linked by aliphatic\nchains into a flexible polymer, this straightforward strategy can reasonably be\napplied to stabilize a wide variety of semiconducting small molecules in\nsolution-processed molecular OPVs, transistors and light emitting diodes.\n", "  Controlling the thermal expansion of materials is of great technological\nimportance. Uncontrolled thermal expansion can lead to failure or irreversible\ndestruction of structures and devices. In ordinary crystals, thermal expansion\nis governed by the asymmetry of the microscopic binding potential, which cannot\nbe adjusted easily. In artificial crystals called metamaterials, thermal\nexpansion can be controlled by structure. Here, following previous theoretical\nwork, we fabricate three-dimensional two-component polymer microlattices by\nusing gray-tone laser lithography. We perform cross-correlation analysis of\noptical microscopy images taken at different sample temperatures. The derived\ndisplacement-vector field reveals that the thermal expansion and resulting\nbending of the bi-material beams leads to a rotation of the 3D chiral crosses\narranged onto a 3D checkerboard pattern within one metamaterial unit cell.\nThese rotations can over-compensate the expansion and lead to an effectively\nnegative thermal length-expansion coefficient for all positive constituents\nevidencing a striking level of thermal-expansion control.\n", "  The dynamics of unidirectionally coupled chaotic Lorenz systems is\ninvestigated. It is revealed that chaos is present in the response system\nregardless of generalized synchronization. The presence of sensitivity is\ntheoretically proved, and the auxiliary system approach and conditional\nLyapunov exponents are utilized to demonstrate the absence of synchronization.\nPeriodic motions embedded in the chaotic attractor of the response system is\ndemonstrated by taking advantage of a period-doubling cascade of the drive. The\nobtained results may shed light on the global unpredictability of the weather\ndynamics and can be useful for investigations concerning coupled Lorenz lasers.\n", "  Behaviour of hot electrons under the influence of dc field in carbon\nnanotubes is theoretically considered. The study was done semi-classically by\nsolving Boltzmann transport equation with the presence of the hot electrons\nsource to derive the current densities. Plots of the normalized axial current\ndensity versus electric field strength of the chiral CNTs reveal a negative\ndifferential conductivity (NDC). Unlike achiral CNTs, the NDC occurs at a low\nfield about $\\mathrm{6\\ kV/cm}$ for chiral CNT. We further observed that the\nswitch from NDC to PDC occurs at lower dc field in chiral CNTs than achiral\ncounterparts. Hence the suppression of the unwanted domain instability usually\nassociated with NDC and a potential generation of terahertz radiations occurs\nat low electric field for chiral CNTs.\n", "  We report on an element-selective study of the fate of charge carriers in\nphotoexcited inorganic CsPbBr3 and CsPb(ClBr)3 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) in\ntoluene solutions using time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy with 80 ps\ntime resolution. Probing the Br K-edge, the Pb L3-edge and the Cs L2-edge, we\nfind that holes in the valence band are localized at Br atoms, forming small\npolarons, while electrons appear as delocalized in the conduction band. No\nsignature of either electronic or structural changes are observed at the Cs\nL2-edge. The results at the Br and Pb edges suggest the existence of a weakly\nlocalized exciton, while the absence of signatures at the Cs edge indicates\nthat the Cs+ cation plays no role in the charge transport, at least beyond 80\nps. These results can explain the rather modest charge carrier mobilities in\nthese materials.\n", "  We study the properties of nuclear matter with lattice nucleon-nucleon ($NN$)\npotential in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory. To use this\npotential in such a microscopic many-body theory, we firstly have to construct\na one-boson-exchange potential (OBEP) based on the latest lattice $NN$\npotential. Three mesons, pion, $\\sigma$ meson, and $\\omega$ meson, are\nconsidered. Their coupling constants and cut-off momenta are determined by\nfitting the on-shell behaviors and phase shifts of the lattice force,\nrespectively. Therefore, we obtain two parameter sets of the OBEP potential\n(named as LOBEP1 and LOBEP2) with these two fitting ways. We calculate the\nproperties of symmetric and pure neutron matter with LOBEP1 and LOBEP2. In\nnon-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock case, the binding energies of symmetric\nnuclear matter are around $-3$ and $-5$ MeV at saturation densities, while it\nbecomes $-8$ and $-12$ MeV in relativistic framework with $^1S_0,~^3S_1,$ and\n$^3D_1$ channels using our two parameter sets. For the pure neutron matter, the\nequations of state in non-relativistic and relativistic cases are very similar\ndue to only consideration $^1S_0$ channel with isospin $T=1$ case.\n", "  Stochastic, spatial reaction-diffusion simulations have been widely used in\nsystems biology and computational neuroscience. However, the increasing scale\nand complexity of simulated models and morphologies have exceeded the capacity\nof any serial implementation. This led to development of parallel solutions\nthat benefit from the boost in performance of modern large-scale\nsupercomputers. In this paper, we describe an MPI-based, parallel\nOperator-Splitting implementation for stochastic spatial reaction-diffusion\nsimulations with irregular tetrahedral meshes. The performance of our\nimplementation is first examined and analyzed with simulations of a simple\nmodel. We then demonstrate its usage in real-world research by simulating the\nreaction-diffusion components of a published calcium burst model in both\nPurkinje neuron sub-branch and full dendrite morphologies. Simulation results\nindicate that our implementation is capable of achieving super-linear speedup\nfor balanced loading simulations with reasonable molecule density and mesh\nquality. In the best scenario a parallel simulation with 2000 processes\nachieves more than 3600 times of speedup relative to its serial SSA counterpart\nand more than 20 times of speedup relative to parallel simulation with 100\nprocesses. While simulation performance is affected by unbalanced loading, a\nsubstantial speedup can still be observed without any special treatment.\n", "  We present a calculation of direct photon production at next-to-leading order\nof QCD and a matching of this calculation with parton showers using POWHEG BOX.\nBased on simulations with POWHEG+PYTHIA, we perform a detailed phenomenological\nanalysis of PHENIX data on prompt photon production and photon-hadron jet\ncorrelations in pp collisions at RHIC, considerably improving the description\nof these data with respect to previous calculations, and we suggest additional\ninteresting analyses.\n", "  Water-rich planets such as Earth are expected to become eventually\nuninhabitable, because liquid water does not remain stable at the surface as\nsurface temperatures increase with the solar luminosity over time. Whether a\nlarge increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO$_2$\ncould also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear.\nWe show with three-dimensional aqua-planet numerical experiments that\nCO$_2$-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar\nforcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback. The\nclimate does not run away, but instead attains a new steady state with\nglobal-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330 K. The upper atmosphere is\nconsiderably moister in this warm steady state than in the reference climate,\nimplying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to\nspace. For either a certain range of elevated CO$_2$ concentrations or solar\nirradiation, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the\ntransition to the warm state may not simply be reversed by removing the\nadditional forcing.\n", "  In this paper, a specific subgrid term occurring in Large Eddy Simulation\n(LES) of two-phase flows is investigated. This and other subgrid terms are\npresented, we subsequently elaborate on the existing models for those and\nre-formulate the ADM-{\\tau} model for sub-grid surface tension previously\npublished by these authors. This paper presents a substantial, conceptual\nsimplification over the original model version, accompanied by a decrease in\nits computational cost. At the same time, it addresses the issues the original\nmodel version faced, e.g. introduces non-isotropic applicability criteria based\non resolved interface's principal curvature radii. Additionally, this paper\nintroduces more throughout testing of the ADM-{\\tau}, in both simple and\ncomplex flows.\n", "  Cyanobacteria forming one-dimensional filaments are paradigmatic model\norganisms of the transition between unicellular and multicellular living forms.\nUnder nitrogen limiting conditions, in filaments of the genus Anabaena, some\ncells differentiate into heterocysts, which lose the possibility to divide but\nare able to fix environmental nitrogen for the colony. These heterocysts form a\nquasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning\nand morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the\nidentification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this\ndata to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic\nregulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key\ncomponents. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:\nlocal autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range\ninhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS\nand hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental\ndynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We\nfind that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory\nmechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation\nsupplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.\nThe preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a\nresult of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell\ndivision. We also find that a purely stochastic initiation of the pattern,\nwithout a two-stage process, is enough to reproduce experimental observations.\n", "  We report a first-principles study on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) and\nspin-injection efficiency (SIE) through phosphorene with nickel electrodes\nunder the mechanical tension and bending on the phosphorene region. Both the\nTMR and SIE are largely improved under these mechanical deformations. For the\nuniaxial tension ($\\varepsilon_y$) varying from 0 to 15\\% applied along the\narmchair transport ({\\it y}-)direction of the phosphorene, the TMR ratio is\nenhanced with a maximum of 107\\% at the $\\varepsilon_y=10\\%$, while the SIE\nincreases monotonously from 8\\% up to 43\\% with the increasing of the strain.\nUnder the out-of-plane bending, the TMR overall increases from 7\\% to 50\\%\nwithin the bending ratio of 0-3.9\\%, and meanwhile the SIE is largely improved\nto around 70\\%, as compared to that (30\\%) of the flat phosphorene. Such\nbehaviors of the TMR and SIE are mainly affected by the transmission of spin-up\nelectrons in the parallel configuration, which is highly depended on the\napplied mechanical tension and bending. Our results indicate that the\nphosphorene based tunnel junctions have promising applications in flexible\nelectronics.\n", "  We propose a straightforward extension of symbolic transfer entropy to enable\nthe investigation of delayed directional relationships between coupled\ndynamical systems from time series. Analyzing time series from chaotic model\nsystems, we demonstrate the applicability and limitations of our approach. Our\nfindings obtained from applying our method to infer delayed directed\ninteractions in the human epileptic brain underline the importance of our\napproach for improving the construction of functional network structures from\ndata.\n", "  We advance our approach of analyzing the dynamics of interacting complex\nsystems with the nonlinear dynamics of interacting nonlinear elements. We\nreplace the widely used lattice-like connection topology of cellular neural\nnetworks (CNN) by complex topologies that include both short- and long-ranged\nconnections. With an exemplary time-resolved analysis of asymmetric nonlinear\ninterdependences between the seizure generating area and its immediate\nsurrounding we provide first evidence for complex CNN connection topologies to\nallow for a faster network optimization together with an improved approximation\naccuracy of directed interactions.\n", "  Transport measurements are powerful tools to probe electronic properties of\nsolid-state materials. To access properties of local electronic states in\nnanostructures, such as local density of states, electronic distribution and so\non, micro-probes utilizing artificial nanostructures have been invented to\nperform measurements in addition to those with conventional macroscopic\nelectronic reservoirs. Here we demonstrate a new kind of micro-probe: a fast\nsingle-lead quantum dot probe, which utilizes a quantum dot coupled only to the\ntarget structure through a tunneling barrier and fast charge readout by RF\nreflectometry. The probe can directly access the local electronic states with\nwide bandwidth. The probe can also access more electronic states, not just\nthose around the Fermi level, and the operations are robust against bias\nvoltages and temperatures.\n", "  The National Science Foundation (NSF) Astronomy Division's Portfolio Review\nof 2012 is no longer relevant to the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) of 2017 for two\nprincipal reasons, one instrumental and the other astrophysical: 1) The GBT has\nbegun significant operations in the 3mm band, giving it unrivaled capabilities\nfor spectroscopy and continuum studies over 67-116 GHz. It is now an instrument\nthat is unique worldwide and is a critical complement to ALMA for the U.S.\nscientific community. These capabilities had not been implemented at the time\nof the review. 2) The detection of gravitational radiation by LIGO in 2015\nplaces the GBT's work on pulsar observations of nano-Hz gravitational radiation\nat the forefront of modern astrophysics.\n  The Green Bank Telescope of 2017 is not the GBT that was reviewed by the\nEisenstein-Miller committee in 2012, a review that was specific to the NSF\nAstronomy portfolio. The GBT serves a wide spectrum of science areas including\nphysics, chemistry, and planetary studies as well as astronomy. Besides its\nwell-documented intellectual merit, it thus has a significant broader impact.\nThe GBT is making significance advances in our understanding of gravitational\nwaves, the equation-of-state of nuclear matter, the mass of supermassive black\nholes, the value of H0, and the physics of star-formation, all key science\ngoals for astronomy identified in a recent National Academy study \"New Worlds,\nNew Horizons: A Midterm Assessment\". In the era of ALMA and LIGO, other\ncountries have bolstered their mm-wave and cm-wave facilities; it is critical\nthat U.S. scientists have ready access to a large filled aperture to remain at\nthe forefront of research.\n", "  Cavity quantum electrodynamics allows one to study the interaction between\nlight and matter at the most elementary level. The methods developed in this\nfield have taught us how to probe and manipulate individual quantum systems\nlike atoms and superconducting quantum bits with an exquisite accuracy. There\nis now a strong effort to extend further these methods to other quantum\nsystems, and in particular hybrid quantum dot circuits. This could turn out to\nbe instrumental for a noninvasive study of quantum dot circuits and a\nrealization of scalable spin quantum bit architectures. It could also provide\nan interesting platform for quantum simulation of simple fermion-boson\ncondensed matter systems. In this short review, we discuss the experimental\nstate of the art for hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamics with quantum dots,\nand we present a simple theoretical modeling of experiments.\n", "  In ferromagnetic nanostructures, the ballistic anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(BAMR) is a change in the ballistic conductance with the direction of\nmagnetization due to spin-orbit interaction. Very recently, a directional\ndependent ballistic conductance has been predicted to occur in a number of\nnewly synthesized nonmagnetic semiconducting nanostructures subject to\nexternally applied magnetic fields, without necessitating spin-orbit coupling.\nIn this article, we review past works on the prediction of this BAMR effect in\ncore-shell nanowires and rolled-up nanotubes. This is complemented by new\nresults we establish for the transport properties of tubular nanosystems\nsubject to external magnetic fields.\n", "  Accurately measuring the masses of white dwarf stars is crucial in many\nastrophysical contexts (e.g., asteroseismology and cosmochronology). These\nmasses are most commonly determined by fitting a model atmosphere to an\nobserved spectrum; this is known as the spectroscopic method. However, for\ncases in which more than one method may be employed, there are well known\ndiscrepancies between masses determined by the spectroscopic method and those\ndetermined by astrometric, dynamical, and/or gravitational-redshift methods. In\nan effort to resolve these discrepancies, we are developing a new model of\nhydrogen in a dense plasma that is a significant departure from previous\nmodels. Experiments at Sandia National Laboratories are currently underway to\nvalidate these new models, and we have begun modifications to incorporate these\nmodels into stellar-atmosphere codes.\n", "  Metastable phases may be spontaneously formed from other metastable phases\nthrough nucleation. Here we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of a\nmetastable phase from an unstable equilibrium by spinodal decomposition, which\nleads to a transient coexistence of stable and metastable phases. This\nphenomenon is generic within the recently introduced scenario of the\nlandscape-inversion phase transitions, which we experimentally realize as a\nstructural transition in a colloidal crystal. This transition exhibits a rich\nrepertoire of new phase-ordering phenomena, including the coexistence of two\nequilibrium phases connected by two physically different interfaces. In\naddition, this scenario enables the control of sizes and lifetimes of\nmetastable domains. Our findings open a new setting that broadens the\nfundamental understanding of phase-ordering kinetics, and yield new prospects\nof applications in materials science.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been extensively used to study\nphonons and gain insight, but direct comparisons to experimental data are often\ndifficult, due to a lack of empirical interatomic potentials (EIPs) for\ndifferent systems. As a result, this issue has become a major barrier to\nrealizing the promise associated with advanced atomistic level modeling\ntechniques. Here, we present a general method for specifically optimizing EIPs\nfrom ab initio inputs for the study of phonon transport properties, thereby\nresulting in phonon optimized potentials (POPs). The method uses a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) to directly fit to the key properties that determine whether or\nnot the atomic level dynamics and most notably the phonon transport are\ndescribed properly.\n", "  Momentum-space derivatives of matrix elements can be related to their\ncoordinate-space moments through the Fourier transform. We derive these\nexpressions as a function of momentum transfer $Q^2$ for asymptotic in/out\nstates consisting of a single hadron. We calculate corrections to the finite\nvolume moments by studying the spatial dependence of the lattice correlation\nfunctions. This method permits the computation of not only the values of matrix\nelements at momenta accessible on the lattice, but also the momentum-space\nderivatives, providing {\\it a priori} information about the $Q^2$ dependence of\nform factors. As a specific application we use the method, at a single lattice\nspacing and with unphysically heavy quarks, to directly obtain the slope of the\nisovector form factor at various $Q^2$, whence the isovector charge radius. The\nmethod has potential application in the calculation of any hadronic matrix\nelement with momentum transfer, including those relevant to hadronic weak\ndecays.\n", "  Sound measurements on a sequence of related, similar constructions with\nslightly different dimensions confirm a simple picture of the air modes of the\ninternal resonator banjo's body. For the purpose of this study, the air modes\nare decoupled from the soundboard (i.e., [drum] head) modes by replacing the\nhead with 3/4\" plywood. The resulting characteristic features survive the\nstrong coupling of the air modes to the head and are in accord with the\nqualitative distinctions recognized by banjo players.\n", "  Van der Waal's heterostrucutures allow for novel devices such as\ntwo-dimensional-to-two-dimensional tunnel devices, exemplified by interlayer\ntunnel FETs. These devices employ channel/tunnel-barrier/channel geometries.\nHowever, during layer-by-layer exfoliation of these multi-layer materials,\nrotational misalignment is the norm and may substantially affect device\ncharacteristics. In this work, by using density functional theory methods, we\nconsider a reduction in tunneling due to weakened coupling across the\nrotationally misaligned interface between the channel layers and the tunnel\nbarrier. As a prototypical system, we simulate the effects of rotational\nmisalignment of the tunnel barrier layer between aligned channel layers in a\ngraphene/hBN/graphene system. We find that rotational misalignment between the\nchannel layers and the tunnel barrier in this van der Waal's heterostructure\ncan significantly reduce coupling between the channels by reducing,\nspecifically, coupling across the interface between the channels and the tunnel\nbarrier. This weakened coupling in graphene/hBN/graphene with hBN misalignment\nmay be relevant to all such van der Waal's heterostructures.\n", "  We study super parallel transport around super loops in a quotient stack, and\nshow that this geometry constructs a global version of the equivariant Chern\ncharacter.\n", "  We consider the hydrodynamics of lipid bilayers containing transmembrane\nproteins of arbitrary shape. This biologically-motivated problem is relevant to\nthe cell membrane, whose fluctuating dynamics play a key role in phenomena\nranging from cell migration, intercellular transport, and cell communication.\nUsing Onsager's variational principle, we derive the equations that govern the\nrelaxation dynamics of the membrane shape, of the mass densities of the bilayer\nleaflets, and of the diffusing proteins' concentration. With our generic\nformalism, we obtain several results on membrane dynamics. We find that\nproteins that span the bilayer increase the intermonolayer friction\ncoefficient. The renormalization, which can be significant, is in inverse\nproportion to the protein's mobility. Second, we find that asymmetric proteins\ncouple to the membrane curvature and to the difference in monolayer densities.\nFor practically all accessible membrane tensions ($\\sigma> 10^{-8}$ N/m) we\nshow that the protein density is the slowest relaxing variable. Furthermore,\nits relaxation rate decreases at small wavelengths due to the coupling to\ncurvature. We apply our formalism to the large-scale diffusion of a\nconcentrated protein patch. We find that the diffusion profile is not\nself-similar, owing to the wavevector dependence of the effective diffusion\ncoefficient.\n"]}
