These conditions on being in the\nquantum spin Hall phase do not require time-reversal symmetry. The result\nmaterializes the general philosophy that topological insulators are non-trivial\nbulk systems with edge currents that are topologically protected against\nAnderson localization.\n", "  Operators conserving the indefinite scalar product on a Krein space $(K,J)$\nare called $J$-unitary. Such an operator $T$ is defined to be $S^1$-Fredholm if\n$T-z$ is Fredholm for all $z$ on the unit circle $S^1$, and essentially\n$S^1$-gapped if there is only discrete spectrum on $S^1$. For paths in the\n$S^1$-Fredholm operators an intersection index similar to the Conley-Zehnder\nindex is introduced. The strict subclass of essentially $S^1$-gapped operators\nhas a countable number of components which can be distinguished by a homotopy\ninvariant given by the signature of $J$ restricted to the eigenspace of all\neigenvalues on $S^1$. These concepts are illustrated by several examples.\n", "  A random phase property is proposed for products of random matrices drawn\nfrom any one of the classical groups associated with the ten Cartan symmetry\nclasses of non-interacting disordered Fermion systems. It allows to calculate\nthe Lyapunov spectrum explicitly in a perturbative regime. These results apply\nto quasi-one-dimensional random Dirac operators which can be constructed as\nrepresentatives for each of the ten symmetry classes. For those symmetry\nclasses that correspond to two-dimensional topological insulators or\nsuperconductors, the random Dirac operators describing the one-dimensional\nboundaries have vanishing Lyapunov exponents and almost surely an absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum, reflecting the gapless and conducting nature of the\nboundary degrees of freedom.\n", "  In this work we provide a method for generating quantum circuits preparing\nmaximally multipartite entangled states using genetic programming. The\npresented method is faster that known realisations thanks to the applied\nfitness function and several modifications to the genetic programming schema.\nMoreover, we enrich the described method by the unique possibility to define an\narbitrary structure of a system. We use the developed method to find new\nquantum circuits, which are simpler from known results. We also analyse the\nefficiency of generating entanglement in the spin chain system and in the\nsystem of complete connections.\n", "  The conformal invariance and universality results of Chelkak-Smirnov on the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model hold for isoradial planar graphs with critical\nweights. Motivated by the problem of extending these results to a wider class\nof graphs, we define a generalized notion of s-holomorphicity for functions on\narbitrary weighted surface graphs. We then give three criteria for\ns-holomorphicity involving the Kac-Ward, Kasteleyn, and discrete Dirac\noperators, respectively. Also, we show that some crucial results known to hold\nin the planar isoradial case extend to this general setting: in particular,\nspin-Ising fermionic observables are s-holomorphic, and it is possible to\ndefine a discrete version of the integral of the square of an s-holomorphic\nfunction. Along the way, we obtain a duality result for Kac-Ward determinants\non arbitrary weighted surface graphs.\n", "  After a short discussion of various random Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) model\noperators and the associated physics, the Aizenman-Molchanov method is applied\nto prove Anderson localization in the weak disorder regime for the spectrum in\nthe central gap. This allows to construct random BdG operators which have\nlocalized states in an interval centered at zero energy. Furthermore,\ntechniques for the calculation of Chern numbers are reviewed and applied to two\nnon-trivial BdG operators, the p+ip wave and d+id wave superconductors.\n", "  We study three methods of obtaining an approximation of unitary evolution of\na quantum system under decoherence. We use three methods of optimizing the\ncontrol pulses: genetic optimization, approximate evolution method and\napproximate gradient method. To model the noise in the system we use the\nLindblad equaiton. We obtain results showing that genetic optimization may give\na better approximation of a unitary evolution in the case of high noise.\n", "  A bounded operator $T$ on a separable, complex Hilbert space is said to be\nodd symmetric if $I^*T^tI=T$ where $I$ is a real unitary satisfying $I^2=-1$\nand $T^t$ denotes the transpose of $T$. It is proved that such an operator can\nalways be factorized as $T=I^*A^tIA$ with some operator $A$. This generalizes a\nresult of Hua and Siegel for matrices. As application it is proved that the set\nof odd symmetric Fredholm operators has two connected components labelled by a\n$Z_2$-index given by the parity of the dimension of the kernel of $T$. This\nrecovers a result of Atiyah and Singer. Two examples of $Z_2$-valued index\ntheorems are provided, one being a version of the Noether-Gohberg-Krein theorem\nwith symmetries and the other an application to topological insulators.\n", "  We review the concept of well-posedness in the context of evolutionary\nproblems from mathematical physics for a particular subclass of problems from\nelasticity theory. The complexity of physical phenomena appears as encoded in\nso called material laws. The usefulness of the structural perspective developed\nis illustrated by showing that many initial boundary value problems in the\ntheory of elastic solids share the same type of solution theory. Moreover,\ninterconnections of the respective models are discussed via a previously\nintroduced mother/descendant mechanism.\n", "  The preparation of a space-mission that carries out any kind of imaging to\ndetect high-precision low-amplitude variability of its targets requires a\nrobust model for the expected performance of its instruments. This model cannot\nbe derived from simple addition of noise properties due to the complex\ninteraction between the various noise sources. While it is not feasible to\nbuild and test a prototype of the imaging device on-ground, realistic numerical\nsimulations in the form of an end-to-end simulator can be used to model the\nnoise propagation in the observations. These simulations not only allow\nstudying the performance of the instrument, its noise source response and its\ndata quality, but also the instrument design verification for different types\nof configurations, the observing strategy and the scientific feasibility of an\nobserving proposal. In this way, a complete description and assessment of the\nobjectives to expect from the mission can be derived. We present a\nhigh-precision simulation software package, designed to simulate photometric\ntime-series of CCD images by including realistic models of the CCD and its\nelectronics, the telescope optics, the stellar field, the jitter movements of\nthe spacecraft, and all important natural noise sources. This formalism has\nbeen implemented in a software tool, dubbed ASTROID Simulator.\n", "  An odd index theorem for higher odd Chern characters of crossed product\nalgebras is proved. It generalizes the Noether-Gohberg-Krein index theorem.\nFurthermore, a local formula for the associated cyclic cocycle is provided.\nWhen applied to the non-commutative Brillouin zone, this allows to define\ntopological invariants for condensed matter phases from the chiral unitary (or\nAIII-symmetry) class in the presence of strong disorder and magnetic fields\nwhenever the Fermi level lies in region of Anderson localization.\n", "  We use computer simulations to study highly dense systems of granular\nparticles that are driven by oscillating forces. We implement different\ndissipation mechanisms that are used to extract the injected energy. In\nparticular, the action of a simple local Stokes' drag is compared with\nnon-linear and history-dependent frictional forces that act either between\nparticle pairs or between particles and an external container wall. The Stokes'\ndrag leads to particle motion that is periodic with the driving force, even at\nhigh densities around close packing where particles undergo frequent\ncollisions. With the introduction of inter-particle frictional forces this\n\"interacting absorbing state\" is destroyed and particles start to diffuse\naround. By reducing the density of the material we go through another\ntransition to a \"non-interacting\" absorbing state, where particles\nindependently follow the force-induced oscillations without collisions. In the\nsystem with particle-wall frictional interactions this transition has signs of\na discontinuous phase transition. It is accompanied by a diverging relaxation\ntime, but not by a vanishing order parameter, which rather jumps to zero at the\ntransition.\n", "  At the interface of two two-dimensional quantum systems, there may exist\ninterface currents similar to edge currents in quantum Hall systems. It is\nproved that these interface currents are macroscopically quantized by an\ninteger that is given by the difference of the Chern numbers of the two\nsystems. It is also argued that at the interface between two time-reversal\ninvariant systems with half-integer spin, one of which is trivial and the other\nnon-trivial, there are dissipationless spin-polarized interface currents.\n", "  We describe the (equivariant) intersection cohomology of certain moduli\nspaces (\"framed Uhlenbeck spaces\") together with some structures on them (such\nas e.g.\\ the Poincar\\'e pairing) in terms of representation theory of some\nvertex operator algebras (\"$\\mathscr W$-algebras\").\n", "  Summer vacations in the Dolomites were a tradition among the professors of\nthe Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Roma\nsince the end of the XIX century. Beyond the academic walls, people like Tullio\nLevi-Civita, Federigo Enriques and Ugo Amaldi sr., together with their\nfamilies, were meeting friends and colleagues in Cortina, San Vito, Dobbiaco,\nVigo di Fassa and Selva, enjoying trekking together with scientific\ndiscussions. The tradition was transmitted to the next generations, in\nparticular in the first half of the XX century, and the group of via Panisperna\nwas directly connected: Edoardo Amaldi, the son of the mathematician Ugo sr.,\nrented at least during two summers, in 1925 and in 1949, and in the winter of\n1960, a house in San Vito di Cadore, and almost every year in the Dolomites;\nEnrico Fermi was a frequent guest. Many important steps in modern physics, in\nparticular the development of the Fermi-Dirac statistics and the Fermi theory\nof beta decay, are related to scientific discussions held in the region of the\nDolomites.\n", "  We shall consider some common models in linear thermo-elasticity within a\ncommon structural framework. Due to the flexibility of the structural\nperspective we will obtain well-posedness results for a large class of\ngeneralized models allowing for more general material properties such as\nanisotropies, inhomogeneities, etc.\n", "  We study, in finite volume, a grand canonical version of the McKean-Vlasov\nequation where the total particle content is allowed to vary. The dynamics is\nanticipated to minimize an appropriate grand canonical free energy; we make\nthis notion precise by introducing a metric on a set of positive Borel measures\nwithout pre-prescribed mass and demonstrating that the dynamics is a gradient\nflow with respect to this metric. Moreover, we develop a JKO-scheme suitable\nfor these problems. The latter ideas have general applicability to a class of\nsecond order non-conservative problems. For this particular system we prove,\nusing the JKO-scheme, that (under certain assumptions) convergence to the\nuniform stationary state is exponential with a rate which is independent of the\nvolume. By contrast, in related conservative systems, decay rates scale - at\nbest - with the square of the characteristic length of the system. This\nsuggests that a grand canonical approach may be useful for both theoretical and\ncomputational study of large scale systems.\n", "  We present a Lorentz gauge theory of gravity in which the metric is not\ndynamical. Spherically symmetric weak field solutions are studied. We show that\nthis solution contains the Schwarzschild spacetime at least to the first order\nof perturbation. Next, we present a special case of the theory. It is shown\nthat the Schwarzschild metric is now an exact solution. Moreover, we show that\nthe de Sitter space is an exact vacuum solution and as a result the theory is\nable to explain the expansion of the universe with no need for a dark energy.\nWithin this special case, quantization of the theory is also studied. The basic\nFeynman diagrams are derived and renormalizability of the theory is studied\nusing the power-counting method. We show that under a certain condition the\ntheory is power-counting renormalizable.\n", "  These supplementary materials detail some calculations and some experimental\nresults related to the propagation of light in the photonic billiard. We first\njustify why we focus only on the rays that are transmitted through the\ncylinders and justify the geometrical optics approximation. Then we explain the\ndynamical properties of ray propagation, demonstrate that asymptotically the\nLyapunov exponent grows as $\\lambda$ $\\sim$ ln t$\\star$ where t$\\star$ = T /R\nis the photonic crystal period T divided by the cylinder radius R. Finally we\nclose these supplementary materials by presenting some experimental results\ndemonstrating the exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions.\n", "  In this work we aim at proving central limit theorems for open quantum walks\non $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. We study the case when there are various classes of vertices\nin the network. Furthermore, we investigate two ways of distributing the vertex\nclasses in the network. First we assign the classes in a regular pattern.\nSecondly, we assign each vertex a random class with a uniform distribution. For\neach way of distributing vertex classes, we obtain an appropriate central limit\ntheorem, illustrated by numerical examples. These theorems may have application\nin the study of complex systems in quantum biology and dissipative quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  Products of random $2\\times 2$ matrices exhibit Gaussian fluctuations around\nalmost surely convergent Lyapunov exponents. In this paper, the distribution of\nthe random matrices is supported by a small neighborhood of order $\\lambda>0$\nof the identity matrix. The Lyapunov exponent and the variance of the Gaussian\nfluctuations are calculated perturbatively in $\\lambda$ and this requires a\ndetailed analysis of the associated random dynamical system on the unit circle\nand its invariant measure. The result applies to anomalies and band edges of\none-dimensional random Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n", "  In a basic framework of a complex Hilbert space equipped with a complex\nconjugation and an involution, linear operators can be real, quaternionic,\nsymmetric or anti-symmetric, and orthogonal projections can furthermore be\nsymplectic. This paper investigates index pairings of projections and unitaries\nsubmitted to such symmetries. Various scenarios emerge: Noether indices can\ntake either arbitrary integer values or only even integer values or they can\nvanish and then possibly have secondary $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariants. These\ngeneral results are applied to prove index theorems for the strong invariants\nof topological insulators. The symmetries come from the Fermi projection\n($K$-theoretic part of the pairing) and the Dirac operator ($K$-homological\npart of the pairing depending on the dimension of physical space).\n", "  We present $B_q\\to\\rho$, $B_q\\to\\omega$, $B_q\\to K^*$, $B_s\\to K^*$ and\n$B_s\\to \\phi$ form factors from light-cone sum rules (LCSR) at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$ for twist-2 and 3 and $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^0)$ for\ntwist-4 with updated hadronic input parameters. Three asymptotic light-cone\ndistribution amplitudes of twist-$4$ (and $5$) are determined, necessary for\nthe form factors to obey the equations of motion. It is argued that the latter\nconstrain the uncertainty of tensor-to-vector form factor ratios thereby\nimproving the prediction of zeros of helicity amplitudes of major importance\nfor $B\\to K^*\\ell\\ell$ angular observables. We provide easy-to-use fits to the\nLCSR results, including the full error correlation matrix, in all modes at low\n$q^2$ as well as combined fits to LCSR and lattice results covering the entire\nkinematic range for $B_q\\to K^*$, $B_s\\to K^*$ and $B_s\\to \\phi$. The error\ncorrelation matrix avoids the problem of overestimating the uncertainty in\nphenomenological applications. Using the new form factors and recent\ncomputations of non-factorisable contributions we provide Standard Model\npredictions for $B\\to K^*\\gamma$ as well as $B\\to K^*\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and\n$B_s\\to\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-$ at low dilepton invariant mass. Employing our $B \\to\n(\\rho,\\omega) $ form factor results we extract the CKM element\n$|V_\\mathrm{ub}|$ from the semileptonic decays $B\\to(\\rho,\\omega) \\ell\\nu$ and\nfind good agreement with other exclusive determinations.\n", "  A non-iterative topological sensitivity framework for guaranteed far field\ndetection of a dielectric inclusion is presented. The cases of single and\nmultiple measurements of the electric far field scattering amplitude at a fixed\nfrequency are taken into account. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed\ntheoretically in terms of resolution, stability, and signal-to-noise ratio.\n", "  This paper describes the physics case for a new fixed target facility at CERN\nSPS. The SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) experiment is intended to hunt for\nnew physics in the largely unexplored domain of very weakly interacting\nparticles with masses below the Fermi scale, inaccessible to the LHC\nexperiments, and to study tau neutrino physics. The same proton beam setup can\nbe used later to look for decays of tau-leptons with lepton flavour number\nnon-conservation, $\\tau\\to 3\\mu$ and to search for weakly-interacting sub-GeV\ndark matter candidates. We discuss the evidence for physics beyond the Standard\nModel and describe interactions between new particles and four different\nportals - scalars, vectors, fermions or axion-like particles. We discuss\nmotivations for different models, manifesting themselves via these\ninteractions, and how they can be probed with the SHiP experiment and present\nseveral case studies. The prospects to search for relatively light SUSY and\ncomposite particles at SHiP are also discussed. We demonstrate that the SHiP\nexperiment has a unique potential to discover new physics and can directly\nprobe a number of solutions of beyond the Standard Model puzzles, such as\nneutrino masses, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter, and inflation\n", "  Chimera is a relatively new emerging phenomenon where coexistence of\nsynchronous and asynchronous state is observed in symmetrically coupled\ndynamical units. We report observation of the chimera state in multiplex\nnetworks where individual layer is represented by 1-d lattice with non-local\ninteractions. While, multiplexing does not change the type of the chimera state\nand retains the multi-chimera state displayed by the isolated networks, it\nchanges the regions of the incoherence. We investigate emergence of\ncoherent-incoherent bifurcation upon varying the control parameters, namely,\nthe coupling strength and the network size. Additionally, we investigate the\neffect of initial condition on the dynamics of the chimera state. Using a\nmeasure based on the differences between the neighboring nodes which\ndistinguishes smooth and non-smooth spatial profile, we find the critical\ncoupling strength for the transition to the chimera state. Observing chimera in\na multiplex network with one to one inter layer coupling is important to gain\ninsight to many real world complex systems which inherently posses multilayer\narchitecture.\n", "  Particles added to a fluid interface can be used as a surface stabilizer in\nthe food, oil and cosmetic industries. As an alternative to rigid particles, it\nis promising to consider highly deformable particles that can adapt their\nconformation at the interface. In this study we compute the shapes of soft\nelastic particles using molecular dynamics simulations of a cross-linked\npolymer gel, complemented by continuum calculations based on linear elasticity.\nIt is shown that the particle shape is not only affected by the Young's modulus\nof the particle, but also strongly depends on whether the gel is partially or\ncompletely wetting the fluid interface. We find that the molecular simulations\nfor the partially wetting case are very accurately described by the continuum\ntheory. By contrast, when the gel is completely wetting the fluid interface the\nlinear theory breaks down and we reveal that molecular details have a strong\ninfluence on the equilibrium shape.\n", "  Superbursts are hours-long X-ray flares attributed to the thermonuclear\nrunaway burning of carbon-rich material in the envelope of accreting neutron\nstars. By studying the details of the X-ray light curve, properties of carbon\ncombustion can be determined. In particular, we show that the shape of the rise\nof the light curve is set by the the slope of the temperature profile left\nbehind by the carbon flame. We analyse RXTE/PCA observations of 4U 1636-536 and\nseparate the direct neutron star emission from evolving photoionized reflection\nand persistent spectral components. This procedure results in the highest\nquality light curve ever produced for the superburst rise and peak, and\ninteresting behaviour is found in the tail. The rising light curve between 100\nand 1000 seconds is inconsistent with the idea that the fuel burned locally and\ninstantaneously everywhere, as assumed in some previous models. By fitting\nimproved cooling models, we measure for the first time the radial temperature\nprofile of the superbursting layer. We find $d\\ln T/d\\ln P=1/4$. Furthermore,\n20% of the fuel may be left unburned. This gives a new constraint on models of\ncarbon burning and propagation in superbursts.\n", "  Accreting neutron stars exhibit Type I X-ray bursts from both frequent\nhydrogen/helium flashes as well as rare carbon flashes. The latter\n(superbursts) ignite in the ashes of the former. Hydrogen/helium bursts,\nhowever, are thought to produce insufficient carbon to power superbursts.\nStable burning could create the required carbon, but this was predicted to only\noccur at much larger accretion rates than where superbursts are observed. We\npresent models of a new steady-state regime of stable hydrogen and helium\nburning that produces pure carbon ashes. Hot CNO burning of hydrogen heats the\nneutron star envelope and causes helium to burn before the conditions of a\nhelium flash are reached. This takes place when the mass accretion rate is\naround 10% of the Eddington limit: close to the rate where most superbursts\noccur. We find that increased heating at the base of the envelope sustains\nsteady-state burning by steepening the temperature profile, which increases the\namount of helium that burns before a runaway can ensue.\n", "  In this paper a relaxation theory, proposed several years ago for plasmas\nwhere a single dominant mode is present, is revisited. The solutions of the\nrelated eigenvalue problem are numerically calculated and discussed. Although\nthese solutions are very rich and can reproduce well the magnetic fields\nmeasured in experiments, there is no manner within the theory to determine the\ndominant helicity, which is a free parameter in the model. To find the\npreferred helicity in the system, we propose to minimize the distance of the\nrelaxed state from another state which is constructed as a two region\ngeneralization of the Taylor relaxation model allowing current jumps. It is\nfound that this comparison is able to predict the observed scaling with the\naspect ratio and reversal parameter for the dominant mode in the Single Helical\nstates.\n", "  In this work we present a method of decomposition of arbitrary unitary matrix\n$U\\in\\mathbf U(2^k)$ into a product of single-qubit negator and\ncontrolled-$\\sqrt{\\mbox{NOT}}$ gates. Since the product results with negator\nmatrix, which can be treated as complex analogue if bistochastic matrix, our\nmethod can be seen as complex analogue of Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, where\ndiagonal matrices are replaced by adding and removing an one-qubit ancilla. The\ndecomposition can be found constructively and resulting circuit consists of\n$O(4^k)$ entangling gates, which is proved to be optimal. An example of such\ntransformation is presented.\n", "  We study via Monte Carlo simulation a generalisation of the so-called vertex\ninteracting self-avoiding walk (VISAW) model on the square lattice. The\nconfigurations are actually not self-avoiding walks but rather restricted\nself-avoiding trails (bond avoiding paths) which may visit a site of the\nlattice twice provided the path does not cross itself: to distinguish this\nsubset of trails we shall call these configurations \\emph{grooves}. Three\ndistinct interactions are added to the configurations: firstly the VISAW\ninteraction, which is associated with doubly visited sites, secondly a nearest\nneighbour interaction in the same fashion as the canonical interacting\nself-avoiding walk (ISAW) and thirdly, a stiffness energy to enhance or\ndecrease the probability of bends in the configuration.\n  In addition to the normal high temperature phase we find three low\ntemperature phases: (i) the usual amorphous liquid drop-like \"globular\" phase,\n(ii) an anisotropic \"$\\beta$-sheet\" phase with dominant configurations\nconsisting of aligned long straight segments, which has been found in\nsemi-flexible nearest neighbour ISAW models, and (iii) a maximally dense phase,\nwhere the all sites of the path are associated with doubly visited sites\n(except those of the boundary of the configuration), previously observed in\ninteracting self-avoiding trails.\n  We construct a phase diagram using the fluctuations of the energy parameters\nand three order parameters. The $\\beta$-sheet and maximally dense phases do not\nseem to meet in the phase space and are always separated by either the extended\nor globular phases. We focus attention on the transition between the extended\nand maximally dense phases, as that is the transition in the original VISAW\nmodel. We find that for the path lengths considered there is a range of\nparameters where the transition is first order and it is otherwise continuous.\n", "  We measure the coherent scattering of light by a cloud of laser-cooled atoms\nwith a size comparable to the wavelength of light. By interfering a laser beam\ntuned near an atomic resonance with the field scattered by the atoms we observe\na resonance with a red-shift, a broadening, and a saturation of the extinction\nfor increasing atom numbers. We attribute these features to enhanced\nlight-induced dipole-dipole interactions in a cold, dense atomic ensemble that\nresult in a failure of standard predictions such as the \"cooperative Lamb\nshift\". The description of the atomic cloud by a mean-field model based on the\nLorentz-Lorenz formula that ignores scattering events where light is scattered\nrecurrently by the same atom and by a microscopic discrete dipole model that\nincorporates these effects lead to progressively closer agreement with the\nobservations, despite remaining differences.\n", "  The understanding of kinase structure is mostly based on protein\ncrystallography, which is limited by the requirement to trap molecules within a\ncrystal lattice. Therefore, characterisations of the conformational dynamics of\nthe activation loop in solution are important to enhance the understanding of\nmolecular processes related to diseases and to support the discovery of small\nmolecule kinase inhibitors. In this work, we demonstrated that long molecular\ndynamics simulations exhaustively sampled all the conformational space of the\nactivation loop of the Aurora-A kinase and of the methane-thiosulfonate spin\nlabel, introduced into the activation loop for the electron paramagnetic\nmeasurements. MD was used to determine structural fluctuations, order\nparameters and rotational correlation times of the motion of the activation\nloop and of the MTSL. Theoretical data obtained were used as input for the\ncalculation of the room temperature 9 GHz continuous wave EPR of the Aurora-A\nkinase in solution and the comparison between simulated and experimental date\nrevealed that the motion of the protein and spin label occurred on comparable\ntimescales. This work is a starting point for deeper experimental and\ntheoretical studies of the rotational and translational diffusion properties of\nthe Aurora-A kinase protein related to its biological activity.\n", "  We predict quantized Imbert-Fedorov, Goos-H\\\"anchen, and photonic spin Hall\nshifts for light beams impinging on a graphene-on-substrate system in an\nexternal magnetic field. In the quantum Hall regime the Imbert-Fedorov and\nphotonic spin Hall shifts are quantized in integer multiples of the fine\nstructure constant $\\alpha$, while the Goos- H\\\"anchen ones in multiples of\n$\\alpha^2$. We investigate the influence on these shifts of magnetic field,\ntemperature, and material dispersion and dissipation. An experimental\ndemonstration of quantized beam shifts could be achieved at terahertz\nfrequencies for moderate values of the magnetic field.\n", "  As the ultimate miniaturization of semiconductor devices approaches, it is\nimperative that the effects of single dopants be clarified. Beyond providing\ninsight into functions and limitations of conventional devices, such\ninformation enables identification of new device concepts. Investigating single\ndopants requires sub-nanometre spatial resolution, making scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy an ideal tool. However, dopant dynamics involve processes occurring\nat nanosecond timescales, posing a significant challenge to experiment. Here we\nuse time-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy to probe and\nstudy transport through a dangling bond on silicon before the system relaxes or\nadjusts to accommodate an applied electric field. Atomically resolved,\nelectronic pump-probe scanning tunnelling microscopy permits unprecedented,\nquantitative measurement of time-resolved single dopant ionization dynamics.\nTunnelling through the surface dangling bond makes measurement of a signal that\nwould otherwise be too weak to detect feasible. Distinct ionization and\nneutralization rates of a single dopant are measured and the physical process\ncontrolling those are identified.\n", "  We study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the triangular lattice by using the\ntwo-dimensional density-matrix renormalization group method. Calculating the\nground-state energy and spin structure factors, we obtain the ground state\nphase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model. As suggested by previous studies,\nwe find a 120$^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex\ncrystal phase, a nematic phase, a dual $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase\n(dual counterpart of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortex crystal phase), a $\\mathbb{Z}_6$\nferromagnetic phase, and a dual ferromagnetic phase (dual counterpart of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_6 $ ferromagnetic phase). Spin correlations discontinuously change\nat the phase boundaries because of first-order phase transitions. In the (dual)\n$\\mathbb{Z}_6$ ferromagnetic phase, we find that the dominant spin component of\nthe spin structure factors is different on either side of the SU(2) symmetric\npoint, although there is no phase transition. Furthermore, we study the\nrelation among von Neumann entanglement entropy, entanglement spectrum, and\nphase transitions of the model. We find that the Schmidt gap closes at the\nphase boundaries and thus the entanglement entropy clearly changes as well.\nThis is different from the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice,\nwhere the Schmidt gap and the entanglement entropy are not necessary a good\nmeasure of phase transitions.\n", "  The problem of detecting non-classical correlations of states of many qudits\nis incomparably more involved than in a case of qubits. The reason is that for\nqubits we have a convenient description of the system by the means of the\nwell-studied correlation tensor. Simply, the complete information about the\nstate can be encoded in mean values of dichotomic measurements. WE demonstrate\nthat for three-dimensional quantum subsystems we are able to formulate\nnonlinear entanglement criteria of the state with existing formalisms. We also\npoint out where the idea for constructing these criteria fails for\nhigher-dimensional systems, which poses well-defined open questions.\n", "  Several projects planned or proposed can significantly expand our knowledge\nof the high-energy Universe in gamma rays. Construction of the Cherenkov\ntelescope array CTA is started, and other detectors are planned which will use\nthe reconstruction of extensive air showers. This report explores the near\nfuture, and possible evolutions in a longer term.\n", "  We present a procedure for exactly diagonalizing finite-range quadratic\nfermionic Hamiltonians with arbitrary boundary conditions in one of D\ndimensions, and periodic in the remaining D-1. The key is a\nHamiltonian-dependent separation of the bulk from the boundary. By combining\ninformation from the two, we identify a matrix function that completely\ncharacterizes the solutions, and allow to identify an indicator of\nbulk-boundary correspondence. As an illustration, we show how our method\ncorrectly describes the zero-energy Majorana modes of a time-reversal-invariant\ns-wave superconductor in a Josephson ring configuration, and predicts that a\nfractional 4 pi Josephson effect can only be observed in phases hosting an odd\nnumber of Majorana pairs.\n", "  We study the optimal control problem of allocating campaigning resources over\nthe campaign duration and degree classes in a social network. Information\ndiffusion is modeled as a Susceptible-Infected epidemic and direct recruitment\nof susceptible nodes to the infected (informed) class is used as a strategy to\naccelerate the spread of information. We formulate an optimal control problem\nfor optimizing a net reward function, a linear combination of the reward due to\ninformation spread and cost due to application of controls. The time varying\nresource allocation and seeds for the epidemic are jointly optimized. A problem\nvariation includes a fixed budget constraint. We prove the existence of a\nsolution for the optimal control problem, provide conditions for uniqueness of\nthe solution, and prove some structural results for the controls (e.g. controls\nare non-increasing functions of time). The solution technique uses Pontryagin's\nMaximum Principle and the forward-backward sweep algorithm (and its\nmodifications) for numerical computations. Our formulations lead to large\noptimality systems with up to about 200 differential equations and allow us to\nstudy the effect of network topology (Erdos-Renyi/scale-free) on the controls.\nResults reveal that the allocation of campaigning resources to various degree\nclasses depends not only on the network topology but also on system parameters\nsuch as cost/abundance of resources. The optimal strategies lead to significant\ngains over heuristic strategies for various model parameters. Our modeling\napproach assumes uncorrelated network, however, we find the approach useful for\nreal networks as well. This work is useful in product advertising, political\nand crowdfunding campaigns in social networks.\n", "  The role of slow-mode MHD shocks in magnetic reconnection is one of great\nimportance for energy conversion and transport, but in many astrophysical\nplasmas the plasma is not fully ionised. In this paper, we investigate, using\nnumerical simulations, the role of collisional coupling between a\nproton-electron charge-neutral fluid and a neutral hydrogen fluid for the 1D\nRiemann problem initiated in a constant pressure and density background state\nby a discontinuity in the magnetic field. This system, in the MHD limit, is\ncharacterised by two waves: a fast-mode rarefaction wave that drives a flow\ntowards a slow-mode MHD shock. The system evolves through four stage:\ninitiation, weak coupling, intermediate coupling and a quasi steady state. The\ninitial stages are characterised by an over-pressured neutral region that\nexpands with characteristics of a blast wave. In the later stages, the system\ntends towards a self-similar solution where the main drift velocity is\nconcentrated in the thin region of the shock front. Due to the nature of the\nsystem, the neutral fluid is overpressured by the shock when compared to a\npurely hydrodynamic shock which results in the neutral fluid expanding to form\nthe shock precursor. The thickness of the shockfront once it has formed\nproportional to the ionisation fraction to the power -1.2, which is a smaller\nexponent than would be naively expected from simple scaling arguments. One\ninteresting result is that the shock front is a continuous transition of the\nphysical variables for sub-sonic velocity upstream of the shock front (a\nc-shock) to a sharp jump in the physical variables followed by a relaxation to\nthe downstream values for supersonic upstream velocity (a j-shock). The\nfrictional heating that results from the velocity drift across the shock front\ncan amount to approximately two per cent of the reference magnetic energy.\n", "  Shear to longitudinal mode conversion via second harmonic generation is\nstudied theoretically and computationally for plane waves in a two-dimensional,\nadhesive, hexagonally close-packed microscale granular medium. The model\nincludes translational and rotational degrees of freedom, as well as normal and\nshear contact interactions. We consider fundamental frequency plane waves in\nall three linear modes, which have infinite spatial extent and travel in one of\nthe high-symmetry crystal directions. The generated second harmonic waves are\nlongitudinal for all cases. For the lower transverse-rotational mode, an\nanalytical expression for the second harmonic amplitude, which is derived using\na successive approximations approach, reveals the presence of particular\nresonant and antiresonant wave numbers, the latter of which is prohibited if\nrotations are not included in the model. By simulating a lattice with adhesive\ncontact force laws, we study the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis for\nnon-resonant, resonant, and antiresonant cases. This work is suitable for the\nanalysis of microscale and statically compressed macroscale granular media, and\nshould inspire future studies on nonlinear two- and three-dimensional granular\nsystems in which interparticle shear coupling and particle rotations play a\nsignificant role.\n", "  We review the recent progress in experimental and theoretical research of\ninteractions between the acoustic, magnetic and plasmonic transients in hybrid\nmetal-ferromagnet multilayer structures excited by ultrashort laser pulses. The\nmain focus is on understanding the nonlinear aspects of the acoustic dynamics\nin materials as well as the peculiarities in the nonlinear optical and\nmagneto-optical response. For example, the nonlinear optical detection is\nillustrated in details by probing the static magneto-optical second harmonic\ngeneration in gold-cobalt-silver trilayer structures in Kretschmann geometry.\nFurthermore, we show experimentally how the nonlinear reshaping of giant\nultrashort acoustic pulses propagating in gold can be quantified by\ntime-resolved plasmonic interferometry and how these ultrashort optical pulses\ndynamically modulate the optical nonlinearities. The effective medium\napproximation for the optical properties of hybrid multilayers facilitates the\nunderstanding of novel optical detection techniques. In the discussion we\nhighlight recent works on the nonlinear magneto-elastic interactions, and\nstrain-induced effects in semiconductor quantum dots.\n", "  Diverse phenomena emerge at the interface between band insulators LaAlO3 and\nSrTiO3, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism, showing an opportunity\nfor potential applications as well as bringing fundamental research interests.\nParticularly, the two-dimensional electron gas formed at LaAlO3/SrTiO3\ninterface offers an appealing platform for quantum phase transition from a\nsuperconductor to a weakly localized metal. Here we report the\nsuperconductor-metal transition in superconducting two-dimensional electron gas\nformed at LaAlO3/SrTiO3(110) interface driven by a perpendicular magnetic\nfield. Interestingly, when approaching the quantum critical point, the dynamic\ncritical exponent is not a constant but a diverging value, which is a direct\nevidence of quantum Griffiths singularity raised from quenched disorder at\nultralow temperatures. Furthermore, the hysteretic property of\nmagnetoresistance was firstly observed at LaAlO3/SrTiO3(110) interfaces, which\nsuggests potential coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism.\n", "  The two-photon quantum Rabi model with quadratic coupling is studied using\nextended squeezed states and we derive $G$-functions for Bargmann index $q=1/4$\nand $3/4$. The simple singularity structure of the $G$-function allows to draw\nconclusions about the distribution of eigenvalues along the real axis. The\npreviously found picture of the spectral collapse at critical coupling\n$g_{\\mathrm{c}}$ has to be modified regarding the low lying states, especially\nthe ground state: We obtain a finite gap between ground state and the continuum\nof excited states at the collapse point. For large qubit splitting, also other\nlow lying states may be separated from the continuum at $g_{\\mathrm{c}}$. We\nhave carried out a perturbative analysis allowing for explicit and simple\nformulae of the eigenstates. Interestingly, a vanishing of the gap between\nground state and excited continuum at $g_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is obtained in each\nfinite order of approximation. This demonstrates cleary the non-pertubative\nnature of the excitation gap. We corroborate these findings with a variational\ncalculation for the ground state.\n", "  Understanding how people move within a geographic area, e.g. a city, a\ncountry or the whole world, is fundamental in several applications, from\npredicting the spatio-temporal evolution of an epidemics to inferring migration\npatterns. Mobile phone records provide an excellent proxy of human mobility,\nshowing that movements exhibit a high level of memory. However, the precise\nrole of memory in widely adopted proxies of mobility, as mobile phone records,\nis unknown. Here we use 560 millions of call detail records from Senegal to\nshow that standard Markovian approaches, including higher-order ones, fail in\ncapturing real mobility patterns and introduce spurious movements never\nobserved in reality. We introduce an adaptive memory-driven approach to\novercome such issues. At variance with Markovian models, it is able to\nrealistically model conditional waiting times, i.e. the probability to stay in\na specific area depending on individual's historical movements. Our results\ndemonstrate that in standard mobility models the individuals tend to diffuse\nfaster than what observed in reality, whereas the predictions of the adaptive\nmemory approach significantly agree with observations. We show that, as a\nconsequence, the incidence and the geographic spread of a disease could be\ninadequately estimated when standard approaches are used, with crucial\nimplications on resources deployment and policy making during an epidemic\noutbreak.\n", "  A low-frequency resistance noise study in highly underdoped thick films of\nLa$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ ($x=0.07$ and 0.08) reveals slow, correlated\ndynamics and breaking of ergodicity near the superconducting transition of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The observed correlated behavior is\nstrongly suppressed by disorder.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of topological insulators in one dimension\nprotected by mirror and time-reversal symmetries. They are characterized by a\nnontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant defined in terms of the\n\"partial\" polarizations, which we show to be quantized in presence of a 1D\nmirror point. The topological invariant determines the generic presence or\nabsence of integer boundary charges at the mirror-symmetric boundaries of the\nsystem. We check our findings against spin-orbit coupled Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper\nmodels that can be realized, e.g. in cold-atomic Fermi gases loaded in\none-dimensional optical lattices or in density- and Rashba spin-orbit-modulated\nsemiconductor nanowires. In this setup, in-gap end-mode Kramers doublets\nappearing in the topologically non-trivial state effectively constitute a\ndouble-quantum-dot with spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  Jammed packings of repulsive elastic spheres have emerged as a rich model\nsystem within which elastic properties of disordered glassy materials may be\nelucidated. Most of the work on these packings have focused on the case of\nvanishing temperature. Here, we explore the elastic properties of the\nassociated connectivity network for finite temperatures, ignoring the breaking\nof bonds and the formation of new ones. Using extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we find that, as the temperature is increased, the resulting\nspring network shrinks and exhibits a rapidly softening bulk modulus via a\ncusp. Moreover, the shear modulus stiffens in a fixed volume ensemble but not\nin a fixed pressure ensemble. These counter-intuitive behaviors may be\nunderstood from the characteristic spectrum of soft modes near isostaticity,\nwhich resembles the spectrum of a rod near its buckling instability. Our\nresults suggest a generic mechanism for negative thermal expansion coefficients\nin marginal solids. We discuss the consequences of bond breaking and an\napparent analogy between thermalization and shear.\n", "  Deterministically growing (wild-type) populations which seed stochastically\ndeveloping mutant clones have found an expanding number of applications from\nmicrobial populations to cancer. The special case of exponential wild-type\npopulation growth, usually termed the Luria-Delbr\\\"uck or Lea-Coulson model, is\noften assumed but seldom realistic. In this article we generalise this model to\ndifferent types of wild-type population growth, with mutants evolving as a\nbirth-death branching process. Our focus is on the size distribution of clones\n- that is the number of progeny of a founder mutant - which can be mapped to\nthe total number of mutants. Exact expressions are derived for exponential,\npower-law and logistic population growth. Additionally for a large class of\npopulation growth we prove that the long time limit of the clone size\ndistribution has a general two-parameter form, whose tail decays as a\npower-law. Considering metastases in cancer as the mutant clones, upon\nanalysing a data-set of their size distribution, we indeed find that a\npower-law tail is more likely than an exponential one.\n", "  Nonlocal unitary operations can create quantum entanglement between\ndistributed particles, and the quantification of created entanglement is a hard\nproblem. It corresponds to the concepts of entangling and assisted entangling\npower when the input states are, respectively, product and arbitrary pure\nstates. We analytically derive them for Schmidt-rank-two bipartite unitary and\nsome complex bipartite permutation unitaries. In particular, the entangling\npower of permutation unitary of Schmidt rank three can take only one of two\nvalues: $\\log_2 9 - 16/9$ or $\\log_2 3$ ebits. The entangling power, assisted\nentangling power and disentangling power of $2\\times d_B$ permutation unitaries\nof Schmidt rank four are all $2$ ebits. These quantities are also derived for\ngeneralized Clifford operators. We further show that any bipartite permutation\nunitary of Schmidt rank greater than two has entangling power greater than\n$1.223$ ebits. We construct the generalized controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates whose\nassisted entangling power reaches the maximum. We quantitatively compare the\nentangling power and assisted entangling power for general bipartite unitaries,\nand study their connection to the disentangling power. We also propose a\nprobabilistic protocol for implementing bipartite unitaries.\n", "  Recent results have shown how quantum cosmology models can be derived from\nthe effective dynamics of condensate states in group field theory (GFT), where\n'cosmology is the hydrodynamics of quantum gravity': the classical Friedmann\ndynamics for homogeneous, isotropic universes, as well as loop quantum\ncosmology (LQC) corrections to general relativity have been shown to emerge\nfrom fundamental quantum gravity. We take one further step towards\nstrengthening the link with LQC and show, in a class of GFT models for gravity\ncoupled to a free massless scalar field and for generic initial conditions,\nthat GFT condensates dynamically reach a low spin phase of many quanta of\ngeometry, in which all but an exponentially small number of quanta are\ncharacterised by a single spin $j_0$ (i.e. by a constant volume per quantum).\nAs the low spin regime is reached, GFT condensates expand to exponentially\nlarge volumes, and the dynamics of the total volume follows precisely the\nclassical Friedmann equations. This behaviour follows from a single requirement\non the couplings in the GFT model under study. We present one particular simple\ncase in which the dominant spin is the lowest one: $j_0=0$ or, if this is\nexcluded, $j_0=1/2$. The type of quantum state usually assumed in the\nderivation of LQC is hence derived from the quantum dynamics of GFT. These\nresults confirm and extend recent results by Oriti, Sindoni and Wilson-Ewing in\nthe same setting.\n", "  We compute the jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$ of QCD plasma in the presence\nof strong magnetic field in both weakly and strongly coupled regimes. In weakly\ncoupled regime, we compute $\\hat q$ in perturbative QCD at complete leading\norder (that is, leading log as well as the constant under the log) in QCD\ncoupling constant $\\alpha_s$, assuming the hierarchy of scales $\\alpha_s eB\\ll\nT^2\\ll eB$. We consider two cases of jet orientations with respect to the\nmagnetic field: 1) the case of jet moving parallel to the magnetic field, 2)\nthe case jet moving perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the former case, we\nfind $\\hat q\\sim \\alpha_s^2 (eB)T\\log(1/\\alpha_s)$, while in the latter we have\n$\\hat q\\sim \\alpha_s^2 (eB)T\\log(T^2/\\alpha_seB)$. In both cases, this leading\norder result arises from the scatterings with thermally populated lowest Landau\nlevel quarks. In strongly coupled regime described by AdS/CFT correspondence,\nwe find $\\hat q\\sim \\sqrt{\\lambda}(eB)T$ or $\\hat\nq\\sim\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\sqrt{eB}T^2$ in the same hierarchy of $T^2\\ll eB$ depending\non whether the jet is moving parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field,\nrespectively, which indicates a universal dependence of $\\hat q$ on $(eB)T$ in\nboth regimes for the parallel case, the origin of which should be the\ntransverse density of lowest Landau level states proportional to $eB$. Finally,\nthe asymmetric transverse momentum diffusion in the case of jet moving\nperpendicular to the magnetic field may give an interesting azimuthal asymmetry\nof the gluon Bremsstrahlung spectrum in the BDMPS-Z formalism.\n", "  Warm inflationary universe models in the context of generalized chaplygin\ngas, modified chaplygin gas, generalized cosmic chaplygin gas are being\nstudied. The dissipative coefficient of the form $\\Gamma\\propto T$, weak and\nstrong dissipative regimes are being considered. We use quartic potential\n$\\frac{\\lambda_{*}\\phi^{4}}{4}$, which is ruled out by current data in cold\ninflation but in our models it is analyzed that it is in agreement with the\nWMAP$9$ and latest Planck data. In these scenarios, the power spectrum,\nspectral index, and tensor to scalar ratio are being examined under the slow\nroll approximation. We show the dependence of tensor scalar ratio $r$ on\nspectral index $n_{s}$ and observe that the range of tensor scalar ratio is\n$r<0.05$ in generalized chaplygin gas, $r<0.15$ in modified chaplygin gas, and\n$r<0.12$ in generalized cosmic chaplygin gas models. Our results are in\nagreement with recent observational data like WMAP$9$ and latest Planck data.\n", "  We propose a method to measure the quantum state of a single mode of the\nelectromagnetic field. The method is based on the interaction of the field with\na probe qubit. The qubit polarizations along coordinate axes are functions of\nthe interaction time and from their Fourier transform we can in general fully\nreconstruct pure states of the field and obtain partial information in the case\nof mixed states. The method is illustrated by several examples, including the\nsuperposition of Fock states, coherent states, and exotic states generated by\nthe dynamical Casimir effect.\n", "  We analyze the storage and retrieval of intense-broadband pulses with the\nadded effects of Doppler broadening and detuning in a $\\Lambda$ configuration.\nWe compute analytical solutions via the inverse scattering technique and show\nhow the signal field is transferred to a spin-wave in the atomic medium and\nlater retrieved by the interaction of a control pulse. Due to the intensity of\nthe pulses, the pulse area (as defined for self-induced transparency) plays a\nkey role in the interaction, as it determines the location of the spin wave\nwithin the medium. Additionally, we compare our results to non-ideal conditions\nby considering pulses of finite length and the effect of spontaneous emission.\n", "  Leading order gravitational corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can\nlead to a consistent picture of the universe by unifying the epochs of\ninflation and dark energy in a single framework. While the leading local\ncorrection induces an inflationary phase in the early universe, the leading\nnon-local term leads to an accelerated expansion of the universe at the present\nepoch. We argue that both the leading UV and IR terms can be obtained within\nthe framework of a covariant effective field theory of gravity. The\nperturbative gravitational corrections therefore provide a fundamental basis\nfor understanding a possible connection between the two epochs.\n", "  Whole-brain neural connectivity data are now available from viral tracing\nexperiments, which reveal the connections between a source injection site and\nelsewhere in the brain. These hold the promise of revealing spatial patterns of\nconnectivity throughout the mammalian brain. To achieve this goal, we seek to\nfit a weighted, nonnegative adjacency matrix among 100 $\\mu$m brain \"voxels\"\nusing viral tracer data. Despite a multi-year experimental effort, injections\nprovide incomplete coverage, and the number of voxels in our data is orders of\nmagnitude larger than the number of injections, making the problem severely\nunderdetermined. Furthermore, projection data are missing within the injection\nsite because local connections there are not separable from the injection\nsignal.\n  We use a novel machine-learning algorithm to meet these challenges and\ndevelop a spatially explicit, voxel-scale connectivity map of the mouse visual\nsystem. Our method combines three features: a matrix completion loss for\nmissing data, a smoothing spline penalty to regularize the problem, and\n(optionally) a low rank factorization. We demonstrate the consistency of our\nestimator using synthetic data and then apply it to newly available Allen Mouse\nBrain Connectivity Atlas data for the visual system. Our algorithm is\nsignificantly more predictive than current state of the art approaches which\nassume regions to be homogeneous. We demonstrate the efficacy of a low rank\nversion on visual cortex data and discuss the possibility of extending this to\na whole-brain connectivity matrix at the voxel scale.\n", "  Inspired by the notion that environmental noise is in principle observable,\nwhilst fundamental noise due to spontaneous localisation would not be, we study\nthe estimation of the diffusion parameter induced by wave function collapse\nmodels under continuous monitoring of the environment. We take into account\nfinite measurement efficiencies and, in order to quantify the advantage granted\nby monitoring, we analyse the quantum Fisher information associated with such a\ndiffusion parameter, identify optimal measurements in limiting cases, and\nassess the performance of such measurements in more realistic conditions.\n", "  A sequential measurement of two non-commuting quantum observables results in\na joint probability distribution for all output combinations that can be\nexplained in terms of an initial joint quasi-probability of the non-commuting\nobservables, modified by the resolution errors and back-action of the initial\nmeasurement. Here, we show that the error statistics of a sequential\nmeasurement of photon polarization performed at different measurement strengths\ncan be described consistently by an imaginary correlation between the\nstatistics of resolution and back-action. The experimental setup was designed\nto realize variable strength measurements with well-controlled imaginary\ncorrelation between the statistical errors caused by the initial measurement of\ndiagonal polarizations, followed by a precise measurement of the\nhorizontal/vertical polarization. We perform the experimental characterization\nof an elliptically polarized input state and show that the same complex joint\nprobability distribution is obtained at any measurement strength.\n", "  We measure and analyse the bispectrum of the final, Data Release 12, galaxy\nsample provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, splitting by\nselection algorithm into LOWZ and CMASS galaxies. The LOWZ sample contains\n361\\,762 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\\rm LOWZ}=0.32$, and the\nCMASS sample 777\\,202 galaxies with an effective redshift of $z_{\\rm\nCMASS}=0.57$. Combining the power spectrum, measured relative to the\nline-of-sight, with the spherically averaged bispectrum, we are able to\nconstrain the product of the growth of structure parameter, $f$, and the\namplitude of dark matter density fluctuations, $\\sigma_8$, along with the\ngeometric Alcock-Paczynski parameters, the product of the Hubble constant and\nthe comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch, $H(z)r_s(z_d)$, and the\nangular distance parameter divided by the sound horizon, $D_A(z)/r_s(z_d)$.\nAfter combining pre-reconstruction RSD analyses of the power spectrum monopole,\nquadrupole and bispectrum monopole; with post-reconstruction analysis of the\nBAO power spectrum monopole and quadrupole, we find $f(z_{\\rm\nLOWZ})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm LOWZ})=0.427\\pm 0.056$, $D_A(z_{\\rm LOWZ})/r_s(z_d)=6.60\n\\pm 0.13$, $H(z_{\\rm LOWZ})r_s(z_d)=(11.55\\pm 0.38)10^3\\,{\\rm kms}^{-1}$ for\nthe LOWZ sample, and $f(z_{\\rm CMASS})\\sigma_8(z_{\\rm CMASS})=0.426\\pm 0.029$,\n$D_A(z_{\\rm CMASS})/r_s(z_d)=9.39 \\pm 0.10$, $H(z_{\\rm\nCMASS})r_s(z_d)=(14.02\\pm 0.22)10^3\\,{\\rm kms}^{-1}$ for the CMASS sample. We\nfind general agreement with previous BOSS DR11 and DR12 measurements. Combining\nour dataset with {\\it Planck15} we perform a null test of General Relativity\n(GR) through the $\\gamma$-parametrisation finding\n$\\gamma=0.733^{+0.068}_{-0.069}$, which is $\\sim2.7\\sigma$ away from the GR\npredictions.\n", "  We investigate the search prospects for new scalars beyond the Standard Model\n(SM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In these studies two real scalars $S$\nand $\\chi$ have been introduced in a two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), where $S$\nis a portal to dark matter (DM) through its interaction with $\\chi$, a DM\ncandidate and a possible source of missing transverse energy (\\MET). Previous\nstudies focused on a heavy scalar $H$ decay mode $H \\to h\\chi\\chi$, which was\nstudied using an effective theory in order to explain a distortion in the Higgs\n($h$) transverse momentum spectrum [16]. In this work, the effective decay is\nunderstood more deeply by including a mediator $S$, and the focus is changed to\n$H \\to h S,~SS$ with $S \\to \\chi\\chi$. Phenomenological signatures of all the\nnew scalars in the proposed 2HDM are discussed in the energy regime of the LHC,\nand their mass bounds have been set accordingly. Additionally, we have\nperformed several analyses with final states including leptons and \\MET, with\n$H \\to 4 W$, $t\\bar t H \\to 6 W$ and $A \\to ZH$ channels, in order to\nunderstand the impact these scalars have on current searches.\n", "  Channeling and radiation are studied for the relativistic electrons and\npositrons passing through a Si crystal periodically bent with a small amplitude\nand a short period. Comprehensive analysis of the channeling process for\nvarious bending amplitudes is presented on the grounds of numerical\nsimulations. The features of the channeling are highlighted and elucidated\nwithin an analytically developed continuous potential approximation. The\nradiation spectra are computed and discussed.\n", "  We report on the production of ultracold heteronuclear YbLi* molecules in a\ndual-species magneto-optical trap by photoassociation (PA). The formation of\nthe electronically excited molecules close to dissociation was observed by trap\nloss spectroscopy. We find 4 rovibrational states within a range of $250\\,$GHz\nbelow the Yb($^1S_0$) + Li($^2P_{1/2}$) asymptote and observe isotopic PA line\nshifts in mixtures of $^6$Li with $^{174}$Yb, $^{172}$Yb, and $^{176}$Yb. We\nalso describe our theoretical ab-initio calculation for the relevant electronic\npotentials and utilize it to analyze and identify the lines in the\nexperimentally observed spectrum.\n", "  Scale dependence at the level of the effective action is a generic result of\nquantum field theory. Allowing for scale dependence of the gravitational\ncouplings leads to a generalization of the corresponding field equations. In\nthis work, those equations are solved by imposing the \"null energy condition\"\nin three-dimensional space time with stationary spherical symmetry. The\nconstants of integration are given in terms of the classical BTZ parameters\nplus one additional constant, that parametrizes the strength of the scale\ndependence. The properties such as asymptotics, horizon structure, and\nthermodynamics are discussed. It is found that the black hole entropy shows a\nremarkable transition from the usual \"area~law\" to an \"area~$\\times$~radius\"\nlaw.\n", "  The use of laser pulse sequences to drive the cascaded difference frequency\ngeneration of high energy, high peak-power and multi-cycle terahertz pulses in\ncryogenically cooled periodically poled lithium niobate is proposed. Detailed\nsimulations considering the coupled nonlinear interaction of terahertz and\noptical waves show that unprecedented optical-to-terahertz energy conversion\nefficiencies > 5%, peak electric fields of hundred(s) of Mega volts/meter at\nterahertz pulse durations of hundred(s) of picoseconds can be achieved. The\nproposed methods are shown to circumvent laser-induced damage at Joule-level\npumping by 1$\\mu$m lasers to enable multi-cycle terahertz sources with pulse\nenergies >> 10 milli-joules. Various pulse sequence formats are proposed and\nanalyzed. Numerical calculations for periodically poled structures accounting\nfor cascaded difference frequency generation, self-phase-modulation, cascaded\nsecond harmonic generation and laser induced damage are introduced.\nUnprecedented studies of the physics governing terahertz generation in this\nhigh conversion efficiency regime, limitations and practical considerations are\ndiscussed. Varying the poling period along the crystal length and further\nreduction of absorption is shown to lead to even higher energy conversion\nefficiencies >>10%. An analytic formulation valid for arbitrary pulse formats\nand closed-form expressions for important cases are presented. Parameters\noptimizing conversion efficiency in the 0.1-1 THz range, the corresponding peak\nelectric fields, crystal lengths and terahertz pulse properties are furnished.\n", "  The $t_{2g}$ orbitals of an edge-shared transition-metal oxide with a\nhoneycomb lattice structure form dispersionless electronic bands when only\nhopping mediated by the edge-sharing oxygens is accessible. This is due to the\nformation of isolated quasimolecular orbitals (QMOs) in each hexagon,\nintroduced recently by Mazin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 197201 (2012)],\nwhich stabilizes a band insulating phase for $t_{2g}^5$ systems. However, with\nhelp of the exact diagonalization method to treat the electron kinetics and\ncorrelations on an equal footing, we find that the QMOs are fragile against not\nonly the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) but also the Coulomb repulsion. We show that\nthe electronic phase of $t_{2g}^5$ systems can vary from a quasimolecular band\ninsulator to a relativistic $J_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulator with increasing\nthe SOC as well as the Coulomb repulsion. The different electronic phases\nmanifest themselves in electronic excitations observed in optical conductivity\nand resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Based on our calculations, we assert\nthat the currently known Ru$^{3+}$- and Ir$^{4+}$-based honeycomb systems are\nfar from the quasimolecular band insulator but rather the relativistic Mott\ninsulator.\n", "  Twisted sectors arise naturally in the bosonic higher spin CFTs at their free\npoints, as well as in the associated symmetric orbifolds. We identify the coset\nrepresentations of the twisted sector states using the description of W_\\infty\nrepresentations in terms of plane partitions. We confirm these proposals by a\nmicroscopic null-vector analysis, and by matching the excitation spectrum of\nthese representations with the orbifold prediction.\n", "  We propose a method of studying the continuous percolation of aligned objects\nas a limit of a corresponding discrete model. We show that the convergence of a\ndiscrete model to its continuous limit is controlled by a power-law dependency\nwith a universal exponent $\\theta = 3/2$. This allows us to estimate the\ncontinuous percolation thresholds in a model of aligned hypercubes in\ndimensions $d = 3,\\ldots,7$ with accuracy far better than that attained using\nany other method before. We also report improved values of the correlation\nlength critical exponent $\\nu$ in dimensions $d = 4,5$ and the values of\nseveral universal wrapping probabilities for $d=4,\\ldots,7$.\n", "  The physics of exotic hadrons is revisited and reviewed, with emphasis on\nflavour configurations which have not yet been investigated. The constituent\nquark model of multiquark states is discussed in some detail, as it can serve\nas a guide for more elaborate approaches.\n", "  We propose a quantum circuit composed of $cNOT$ gates and four single-qubit\ngates to generate a $W$ state of three qubits. This circuit was then enhanced\nby integrating two-qubit gates to create a $W$ state of four and five qubits.\nAfter a couple of enhancements, we show that an arbitrary $W$ state can be\ngenerated depending only on the degree of enhancement. The generalized formula\nfor the number of two-qubit gates required is given, showing that an $n$-qubit\n$W$-state generation can be achieved with quadratically increasing number of\ntwo-qubit gates. Also, the practical feasibility is discussed regarding photon\nsources and various applications of $cNOT$ gates.\n", "  Susceptibilities of conserved quantities, such as baryon number, strangeness\nand electric charge are sensitive to the onset of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\nphase transition and are expected to provide information on the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collision experiments. A comprehensive study of the second-order\ndiagonal susceptibilities and cross correlations has been made within a thermal\nmodel approach of the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model as well as with a\nhadronic transport model, UrQMD. We perform a detailed analysis of the effect\nof detector acceptances and choice of particle species in the experimental\nmeasurements of the susceptibilities for heavy-ion collisions corresponding to\n\\sNN = 4 GeV to 200 GeV. The transverse momentum cutoff dependence of suitably\nnormalised susceptibilities are proposed as useful observables to probe the\nproperties of the medium at freezeout.\n", "  By establishing a relation between information erasure and continuous phase\ntransitions we generalise the Landauer bound to analog computing systems. The\nentropy production per degree of freedom during erasure of an analog variable\n(reset to standard value) is given by the logarithm of the configurational\nvolume measured in units of its minimal quantum. As a consequence every\ncomputation has to be carried on with a finite number of bits and infinite\nprecision is forbidden by the fundamental laws of physics, since it would\nrequire an infinite amount of energy.\n", "  The magnetic structure of the intermetallic compound EuGa$_4$ was\ninvestigated using single-crystal neutron diffraction with the time-of-flight\n(TOF) Laue technique on the new diffractometer SENJU at MLF of J-PARC. In spite\nof high neutron absorption of Eu, a vast number of diffraction spots were\nobserved without isotope enrichment. The magnetic reflections were appeared at\nthe positions with the diffraction indices of $h+k+l{\\neq}2n$ below 16 K,\nindicating that the ordering vector is ${\\bf q}=(0~0~0)$. Continuous evolution\nof magnetic reflection intensity below $T_{\\rm N}$ follows a squared Brillouin\nfunction for $S$=7/2. By adopting a wavelength-dependent absorption collection,\nthe magnetic structure of EuGa$_4$ was revealed that a nearly full magnetic\nmoment of 6.4$~{\\mu}_{\\rm B}$ of Eu lies within the basal plane of the lattice.\nThe present study reveals a well-localized divalent Eu magnetism in EuGa$_4$\nand demonstrates a high ability of SENJU to investigate materials with high\nneutron absorption.\n", "  Topological insulators are solid state systems of independent electrons for\nwhich the Fermi level lies in a mobility gap, but the Fermi projection is\nnevertheless topologically non-trivial, namely it cannot be deformed into that\nof a normal insulator. This non-trivial topology is encoded in adequately\ndefined invariants and implies the existence of surface states that are not\nsusceptible to Anderson localization. This non-technical review reports on\nrecent progress in the understanding of the underlying mathematical structures,\nwith a particular focus on index theory.\n", "  A flow-through sensing platform based on open-ended porous silicon (PSi)\nmicrocavity membranes that are compatible with integration in on-chip sensor\narrays is demonstrated. Due to the high aspect ratio of PSi nanopores, the\nperformance of closed-ended PSi sensors is limited by infiltration challenges\nand slow sensor responses when detecting large molecules such as proteins and\nnucleic acids. In order to improve molecule transport efficiency and reduce\nsensor response time, open-ended PSi nanopore membranes were used in a\nflow-through sensing scheme, allowing analyte solutions to pass through the\nnanopores. The molecular binding kinetics in these PSi membranes were compared\nthrough experiments and simulation with those from closed-ended PSi films of\ncomparable thickness in a conventional flow-over sensing scheme. The\nflow-through PSi membrane resulted in a six-fold improvement in sensor response\ntime when detecting a high molecular weight analyte (streptavidin) versus in\nthe flow-over PSi approach. This work demonstrates the possibility of\nintegrating multiple flow-through PSi sensor membranes within parallel\nmicroarrays for rapid and multiplexed label-free biosensing.\n", "  We present predictions for the total cross sections for pair production of\nsquarks and gluinos at the LHC including a combined NNLL resummation of soft\nand Coulomb gluon effects. We derive all terms in the NNLO cross section that\nare enhanced near the production threshold, which include contributions from\nspin-dependent potentials and so-called annihilation corrections. The NNLL\ncorrections at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV range from up to $20\\%$ for squark-squark\nproduction to $90\\%$ for gluino pair production relative to the NLO results and\nreduce the theoretical uncertainties of the perturbative calculation to the\n$10\\%$ level. Grid files with our numerical results are publicly available.\n", "  The results of Amir-Corwin-Quastel, Calabrese-Le Doussal-Rosso, Dotsenko, and\nSasamoto-Spohn imply that the one-point distribution of the solution of the KPZ\nequation with the narrow wedge initial condition coincides with that for a\nmultiplicative statistics of the Airy determinantal random point process.\nTaking Taylor coefficients of the two sides yields moment identities. We\nprovide a simple direct proof of those via a combinatorial match of their\nmultivariate integral representations.\n", "  We present a new simple self-consistent field theory of the polarizable\nflexible polymer chain under the external constant electric field with account\nfor the many-body electrostatic dipole correlations. We show the effect of\nelectrostatic dipole correlations on the electric field-induced globule-coil\ntransition. We demonstrate that only when the polymer chain is in the coil\nconformation, the electrostatic dipole correlations of monomers can be\nconsidered as pairwise. However, when the polymer chain is in collapsed state,\nthe dipole correlations have to be considered at the many-body level.\n", "  The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a dual-phase liquid xenon\ntime projection chamber (TPC) operating at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility in Lead, South Dakota. A calibration of nuclear recoils in liquid\nxenon was performed $\\textit{in situ}$ in the LUX detector using a collimated\nbeam of mono-energetic 2.45 MeV neutrons produced by a deuterium-deuterium\n(D-D) fusion source. The nuclear recoil energy from the first neutron scatter\nin the TPC was reconstructed using the measured scattering angle defined by\ndouble-scatter neutron events within the active xenon volume. We measured the\nabsolute charge ($Q_{y}$) and light ($L_{y}$) yields at an average electric\nfield of 180 V/cm for nuclear recoil energies spanning 0.7 to 74 keV and 1.1 to\n74 keV, respectively. This calibration of the nuclear recoil signal yields will\npermit the further refinement of liquid xenon nuclear recoil signal models and,\nimportantly for dark matter searches, clearly demonstrates measured ionization\nand scintillation signals in this medium at recoil energies down to\n$\\mathcal{O}$(1 keV).\n", "  In quantum mechanics, measurements cause wavefunction collapse that yields\nprecise outcomes, for non-commuting observables such as position and momentum\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle limits the intrinsic precision of a state.\nAlthough theoretical work has demonstrated the possibility to perform\nsimultaneous non-commuting measurements and has revealed the limits on\nmeasurement outcomes, only recently has the dynamics of the quantum state been\ndiscussed. To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two\ncontinuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables to a\nsuperconducting qubit. We implement multiple readout channels by coupling the\nqubit to multiple modes of a cavity. To control the measurement observables, we\nimplement a 'single quadrature' measurement by driving the qubit and applying\ncavity sidebands with a relative phase that sets the observable. Here, we show\nthat the uncertainty principle governs the dynamics of the wavefunction by\nenforcing a lower bound on the measurement-induced disturbance. Consequently,\nas we transition from measuring identical to measuring non-commuting\nobservables, the dynamics make a smooth transition from standard wavefunction\ncollapse to persistent diffusion. Although the evolution of the state differs\nfrom that of a conventional measurement, information about both observables is\nextracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement record,\nenabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our work\ncreates novel capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state\npurification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and\ncontinuous quantum error correction. As physical systems often interact\ncontinuously with their environment via non-commuting degrees of freedom, our\nwork offers a way to study how notions of contemporary quantum foundations\narise in such settings.\n", "  We investigate Lovelock gravity in five dimensions in first order formalism.\nWe construct a new class of solutions: BTZ black ring with(out) torsion. We\nshow that our solution with torsion exists in the different sector of the\nLovelock gravity compared to Lovelock Chern-Simons and the sector investigated\nby Canfora et al. We compute conserved charges of the solutions by using\nNester's formula, and confirm the results by canonical method. We show that the\ntheory linearized around the background with torsion possesses additional\ndegrees of freedom compared to general relativity.\n", "  In this paper, we study a plasmonic horn nanoantenna on a metal-backed\nsubstrate. The horn nanoantenna structure consists of a two-wire transmission\nline (TWTL) flared at the end. We analyze the effect of the substrate thickness\non the nanoantenna's radiation pattern, and demonstrate beam steering in a\nbroad range of elevation angles. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the\nground plane on the impedance matching between the antenna and the TWTL, and\nobserve that the ground plane increases the back reflection into the waveguide.\nTo reduce the reflection, we develop a transmission line model to design an\nimpedance matching section which leads to 99.75% power transmission to the\nnanoantenna.\n", "  General Relativity extensions based on Renormalization Group effects are\nmotivated by a known physical principle and constitute a class of extended\ngravity theories that have some unexplored unique aspects. In this work we\ndevelop in detail the Newtonian and post Newtonian limits of a realisation\ncalled Renormalization Group extended General Relativity (RGGR). Special\nattention is taken to the external potential effect, which constitutes a type\nof screening mechanism typical of RGGR. In the Solar System, RGGR depends on a\nsingle dimensionless parameter $\\bar \\nu_\\odot$, and this parameter is such\nthat for $\\bar \\nu_\\odot = 0$ one fully recovers GR in the Solar System.\nPreviously this parameter was constrained to be $|\\bar \\nu_\\odot| \\lesssim\n10^{-21}$, without considering the external potential effect. Here we show that\nunder a certain approximation RGGR can be cast in a form compatible with the\nParametrised Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, and we use both the PPN formalism\nand the Laplace-Runge-Lenz technique to put new bounds on $\\bar \\nu_\\odot$,\neither considering or not the external potential effect. With the external\npotential effect the new bound reads $|\\bar \\nu_\\odot| \\lesssim 10^{-16}$. We\ndiscuss the possible consequences of this bound to the dark matter abundance in\ngalaxies.\n", "  Kerr nonlinear cavities displaying optical thresholding have been proposed\nfor the realization of ultra-low power photonic logic gates. In the ultra-low\nphoton number regime, corresponding to energy levels in the attojoule scale,\nquantum input-output models become important to study the effect of unavoidable\nquantum fluctuations on the performance of such logic gates. However, being a\nquantum anharmonic oscillator, a Kerr-cavity has an infinite dimensional\nHilbert space spanned by the Fock states of the oscillator. This poses a\nchallenge to simulate and analyze photonic logic gates and circuits composed of\nmultiple Kerr nonlinearities. For simulation, the Hilbert of the oscillator is\ntypically truncated to the span of only a finite number of Fock states. This\npaper develops a quasi-principal components approach to identify important\nsubspaces of a Kerr-cavity Hilbert space and exploits it to construct an\napproximate reduced model of the Kerr-cavity on a smaller Hilbert space. Using\nthis approach, we find a reduced dimension model with a Hilbert space dimension\nof 15 that can closely match the magnitudes of the mean transmitted and\nreflected output fields of a conventional truncated Fock state model of\ndimension 75, when driven by an input coherent field that switches between two\nlevels. For the same input, the reduced model also closely matches the\nmagnitudes of the mean output fields of Kerr-cavity-based AND and NOT gates and\na NAND latch obtained from simulation of the full 75 dimension model.\n", "  Ionic microgel particles, when dispersed in a solvent, swell to equilibrium\nsizes that are governed by a balance between electrostatic and elastic forces.\nTuning of particle size by varying external stimuli, such as $p$H, salt\nconcentration, and temperature, has relevance for drug delivery, microfluidics,\nand filtration. To model swelling of ionic microgels, we derive a statistical\nmechanical theorem, which proves exact within the cell model, for the\nelectrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure inside a permeable colloidal\nmacroion. Applying the theorem, we demonstrate how the distribution of\ncounterions within an ionic microgel determines the internal osmotic pressure.\nBy combining the electrostatic pressure, which we compute via both\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation, with the elastic\npressure, modeled via the Flory-Rehner theory of swollen polymer networks, we\nshow how deswelling of ionic microgels with increasing concentration of\nparticles can result from a redistribution of counterions that reduces\nelectrostatic pressure. A linearized approximation for the electrostatic\npressure, which proves remarkably accurate, provides physical insight and\ngreatly eases numerical calculations for practical applications. Comparing with\nexperiments, we explain why soft particles in deionized suspensions deswell\nupon increasing concentration and why this effect may be suppressed at higher\nionic strength. The failure of the uniform ideal-gas approximation to\nadequately account for counterion-induced deswelling below close packing of\nmicrogels is attributed to neglect of spatial variation of the counterion\ndensity profile and the electrostatic pressure of incompletely neutralized\nmacroions.\n", "  We derive the discretized Maxwell's equations using the discrete variational\nderivative method (DVDM), calculate the evolution equation of the constraint,\nand confirm that the equation is satisfied at the discrete level. Numerical\nsimulations showed that the results obtained by the DVDM are superior to those\nobtained by the Crank-Nicolson scheme. In addition, we study the two types of\nthe discretized Maxwell's equations by the DVDM and conclude that if the\nevolution equation of the constraint is not conserved at the discrete level,\nthen the numerical results are also unstable.\n", "  Following the intense studies on topological insulators, significant efforts\nhave recently been devoted to the search for gapless topological systems. These\nmaterials not only broaden the topological classification of matter but also\nprovide a condensed matter realization of various relativistic particles and\nphenomena previously discussed mainly in high energy physics. Weyl semimetals\nhost massless, chiral, low-energy excitations in the bulk electronic band\nstructure, whereas a symmetry protected pair of Weyl fermions gives rise to\nmassless Dirac fermions. We employed scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\nto explore the behavior of electronic states both on the surface and in the\nbulk of topological semimetal phases. By mapping the quasiparticle interference\nand emerging Landau levels at high magnetic field in Dirac semimetals\nCd$_3$As$_2$ and Na$_3$Bi, we observed extended Dirac-like bulk electronic\nbands. Quasiparticle interference imaged on Weyl semimetal TaAs demonstrated\nthe predicted momentum dependent delocalization of Fermi arc surface states in\nthe vicinity of the surface-projected Weyl nodes.\n", "  The hippocampus is a seminal structure in the most common surgically-treated\nform of epilepsy. Accurate segmentation of the hippocampus aids in establishing\nasymmetry regarding size and signal characteristics in order to disclose the\nlikely site of epileptogenicity. With sufficient refinement, it may ultimately\naid in the avoidance of invasive monitoring with its expense and risk for the\npatient. To this end, a reliable and consistent method for segmentation of the\nhippocampus from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is needed. In this work, we\npresent a systematic and statistical analysis approach for evaluation of\nautomated segmentation methods in order to establish one that reliably\napproximates the results achieved by manual tracing of the hippocampus.\n", "  We investigate the electronic structure and chemical activity of rippled\nphosphorene induced by large compressive strains via first-principles\ncalculation. It is found that phosphorene is extraordinarily bendable, enabling\nthe accommodation of ripples with large curvatures. Such highly rippled\nphosphorene shows a strong anisotropy in electronic properties. For ripples\nalong the armchair direction, the band gap changes from 0.84 to 0.51 eV for the\ncompressive strain up to -20% and further compression shows no significant\neffect, for ripples along the zigzag direction, semiconductor to metal\ntransition occurs. Within the rippled phosphorene, the local electronic\nproperties, such as the modulated band gap and the alignments of frontier\norbitals, are found to be highly spatially dependent, which may be used for\nmodulating the injection and confinement of carriers for optical and\nphotovoltaic applications. The examination of the interaction of a physisorbed\nNO molecule with the rippled phosphorene under different compressive strains\nshows that the chemical activities of the phosphorene are significantly\nenhanced at the top and bottom peaks of the ripples, indicated by the enhanced\nadsorption and charge transfer between them. All these features can be ascribed\nto the effect of curvatures, which modifies the orbital coupling between atoms\nat the ripple peaks.\n", "  SnTe is a prototypical topological crystalline insulator, in which the\ngapless surface state is protected by a crystal symmetry. The hallmark of the\ntopological properties in SnTe is the Dirac cones projected to the surfaces\nwith mirror symmetry, stemming from the band inversion near the L points of its\nbulk Brillouin zone, which can be measured by angle-resolved photoemission. We\nhave obtained the (111) surface of SnTe film by molecular beam epitaxy on\nBaF2(111) substrate. Photon-energy-dependence of in situ angle-resolved\nphotoemission, covering multiple Brillouin zones in the direction perpendicular\ntothe (111) surface, demonstrate the projected Dirac cones at the Gamma_bar and\nM_bar points of the surface Brillouinzone. In addition, we observe a\nDirac-cone-like band structure at the Gamma point of the bulk Brillouin\nzone,whose Dirac energy is largely different from those at the Gamma_bar and\nM_bar points.\n", "  The existence of dark matter and dark energy in cosmology is implied by\nvarious observations, however, they are still unclear because they have not\nbeen directly detected. In this Letter, an unified model of dark energy and\ndark matter that can explain the evolution history of the Universe later than\ninflationary era, the time evolution of the growth rate function of the matter\ndensity contrast, the flat rotation curves of the spiral galaxies, and the\ngravitational experiments in the solar system is proposed in mimetic matter\nmodel.\n", "  We apply high-energy proton ion-implantation to modify TiO2 nanotubes\nselectively at their tops. In the proton-implanted region we observe the\ncreation of intrinsic co-catalytic centers for photocatalytic H2-evolution. We\nfind proton implantation to induce specific defects and a characteristic\nmodification of the electronic properties not only in nanotubes but also on\nanatase single crystal (001) surfaces. Nevertheless, for TiO2 nanotubes a\nstrong synergetic effect between implanted region (catalyst) and implant-free\ntube segment (absorber) can be obtained.\n", "  In this paper, we study the time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation within\nthe formalism of position dependent effective mass. For a generalized\ndecomposition of the non-central effective potential, the deformed\nSchr\\\"odinger equation can be easily solved analytically through separation of\nvariables. The energy eigenvalues and the normalization constant of the radial\nwave functions are obtained, as well as the scattering phase shifts.\n", "  With the detection of Gravitational waves just about an year ago Einstein`s\ngeneral theory of relativity- a space-time theory of gravity, got established\non a firmer footing than any other theory in physics. Gravitational waves are\njust propagating disturbances in the gravitational field of extremely strong\nsources caused by some catastrophic event associated with cosmic bodies, like\nbinary black hole coalescence, or neutron star mergers. As these events happen\nvery far away in cosmos, and the signal strength would be extremely weak, it\nrequires extraordinary detection and analysis technology to observe an event on\nearth. Luckily the joint collaboration LIGO-VIRGO, have so far detected two\nevents in September and December of 2015 during their analysis of observations\nmade with the laser interferometers over the last few observing sessions. The\ntalk will give a brief theoretical sketch of the analysis required for\ndescribing the waves resulting from mass motion in the realm of general\nrelativity, and point out, the serious and sincere efforts of the past fifty\nyears that went into the final success. An attempt will be made to point out\nthe enormous scope that is available for the new generation of students and\nresearchers in pursuing the topic as a new window for possibly viewing the\nUniverse with the implications for the studies of Dark matter, Dark energy and\nCosmology as a whole.\n", "  We prove that low-rank matrices can be recovered efficiently from a small\nnumber of measurements that are sampled from orbits of a certain matrix group.\nAs a special case, our theory makes statements about the phase retrieval\nproblem. Here, the task is to recover a vector given only the amplitudes of its\ninner product with a small number of vectors from an orbit. Variants of the\ngroup in question have appeared under different names in many areas of\nmathematics. In coding theory and quantum information, it is the complex\nClifford group; in time-frequency analysis the oscillator group; and in\nmathematical physics the metaplectic group. It affords one particularly small\nand highly structured orbit that includes and generalizes the discrete Fourier\nbasis: While the Fourier vectors have coefficients of constant modulus and\nphases that depend linearly on their index, the vectors in said orbit have\nphases with a quadratic dependence. In quantum information, the orbit is used\nextensively and is known as the set of stabilizer states. We argue that due to\ntheir rich geometric structure and their near-optimal recovery properties,\nstabilizer states form an ideal model for structured measurements for phase\nretrieval. Our results hold for $m\\geq C \\kappa_r r d \\log(d)$ measurements,\nwhere the oversampling factor k varies between $\\kappa_r=1$ and $\\kappa_r =\nr^2$ depending on the orbit. The reconstruction is stable towards both additive\nnoise and deviations from the assumption of low rank. If the matrices of\ninterest are in addition positive semidefinite, reconstruction may be performed\nby a simple constrained least squares regression. Our proof methods could be\nadapted to cover orbits of other groups.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a unified procedure for calibration of macroscopic\nsecond-order multilane traffic models. The focus is on calibrating the\nfundamental diagram using the combination stationary detector data and GPS\ntraces. GPS traces are used in estimation of the deceleration wave speed. Thus\ncalibrated model adequately represents the three phases of traffic: free flow,\nsynchronized flow and the wide moving jam. The proposed approach was validated\nin simulation using stationary detection data and GPS traces from the Moscow\nRing Road. Simulation showed that the proposed second-order model is more\naccurate than the first-order LWR model.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the random walk process on a kind of fractal (or\ntransfractal) scale free networks, which also called as $(u,v)$ flowers, and we\nfocus on the global first passage time (GFPT) and first return time (FRT).\nHere, we present method to derive exactly the probability generation function,\nmean and variance of the GFPT and FRT for a given hub (i.e., node with the\nhighest degree) and then the scaling properties of the mean and the variance of\nthe GFPT and FRT are disclosed. Our results show that, for the case of $u>1$,\nwhile the networks are fractals, the mean of the GFPT scales with the volume of\nthe network as $\\langle GMFPT_t\\rangle \\sim N_t^{{2}/{d_s}}$, where $\\langle *\n\\rangle$ denotes the mean of random variable $*$, $N_t$ is the volume of the\nnetwork with generation $t$ and $d_s$ is the spectral dimension of the network;\nbut, for the case of $u=1$, while the networks are nonfractals, the mean of the\nGFPT scales as $\\langle GMFPT_t\\rangle \\sim N_t^{{2}/{\\tilde{d}_s}}$, where\n$\\tilde{d}_s$ is the transspectral dimension of the network, which is\nintroduced in this paper. Results also show that, the variance of the GFPT\nscales as $Var(GFPT_t) \\sim \\langle GFPT_{t}\\rangle^2$, where $Var(*)$ denotes\nvariance of of random variable $*$; whereas the variance of the FRT scales as\n$Var(FRT_t) \\sim \\langle FRT_{t} \\rangle \\langle GFPT_{t}\\rangle$.\n%$Var(GFPT_t) \\sim \\langle GFPT_{t}\\rangle^2$ and $Var(FRT_t) \\sim \\langle\nFRT_{t} \\rangle \\langle GFPT_{t}\\rangle$, where $Var(GFPT_t)$ and $Var(FRT_t)$\ndenote the variance of the GFPT and the FRT, $\\langle GFPT_{t}\\rangle$ and\n$\\langle FRT_{t}\\rangle$ denote the mean of the GFPT and the FRT respectively.\n", "  A new numerically and experimentally tested measurement method for the local\nelectrical light field including its phase is presented. The method is based on\nSelf Referencing Interferograms (SRI) such as shearing interferograms. The\ncomplex electric field is the solution vector of a linear equation with the\npixel resolved interference term E_2* E_1 as a parameter. Linearization of the\nnon linear equations is achieved by using preknowledge in the intensity as\nobtained by a conventional image detetctor. The resulting linear equations are\nnot based on any approximation, iterative perturbation expansion etc. but are\nexact. The method is non iterative and stable against noise for arbitrarily\nchosen test fields. Allowed fields can exhibit highly fluctuating\namplitudes/phases on the pixel scale, areas of vanishing amplitude and Pi phase\njumps. The spatial resolution is of pixel size. No reference beam and no\ndiaphragms are used. The new method can be implemented as a fast, one shot per\nframe video system. An outlook on the space resolved measurement of non\nclassical two photon states (including vacuum squeezed coherent states) is\ngiven.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes\nunder the influence of rainbow gravity. In the metric of Schwarzschild,\nReissner-Nordstrom and Reissner-Nordstrom-de-Sitter black hole surrounded by\nquintessence, we consider a rainbow function and derive the existence of\nremnant and critical masses of a black hole. Using the Hawking temperature\nrelation we derive the heat capacity and the entropy of the rainbow gravity\ninspired black holes and closely study the relation between entropy and area of\nthe horizon for different values of n of the rainbow function.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the fractional generalization of the Fokker-Planck\nequation associated with a stochastic differential equation in a bounded\ndomain. The driving process of the stochastic differential equation is a L\\'evy\nprocess subordinated to the inverse of L\\'evy's mixed stable subordinators. The\nFokker-Planck equation is given through the general Waldenfels operator, while\nthe boundary condition is given through the general Wentcel's boundary\ncondition. As a fractional operator a distributed order differential operator\nwith a Borel mixing measure is considered. In the paper fractional\ngeneralizations of the Fokker-Planck equation are derived and the existence of\na unique solution of the corresponding initial-boundary value problems is\nproved.\n", "  We develop a self-contained approach to bosonization and refermionization\nusing the Keldysh functional integral. Starting from fermionic particles, we\nbosonize the system and obtain a description in terms of the Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid, with, in addition, an infinite series of interaction terms arising from\nthe curvature of the fermionic particle spectrum. We explicitly calculate the\nleading interaction term and check its consistency with a different approach\nbased on the Matsubara framework, within which we calculate the second leading\ninteraction term, as well. Moreover, we bosonize weakly and strongly\ninteracting bosonic particles, and, finally, refermionize interacting phonons\ninto non-interacting fermionic quasiparticles. The work culminates in a map\nbetween bosonic and fermionic particles and effective bosonic and fermionic\nexcitations, representing phonons and fermionic quasiparticles.\n", "  The study of traversable wormholes is very hot topic for the past 30 years.\nOne of the best possible way to make traversable wormhole is using the\nthin-shells to cut and paste two spacetime which has tunnel from one region of\nspace-time to another, through which a traveler might freely pass in wormhole\nthroat. These geometries need an exotic matter which involves a stress-energy\ntensor that violates the null energy condition. However, this method can be\nused to minimize the amount of the exotic matter. The goal of this thesis study\nis to study on thin-shell and thin-shell wormholes in general relativity in 2+1\nand 3+1 dimensions. We also investigate the stability of such objects.\n", "  In magnetized plasma physics, almost all developed analytic theories assume a\nMaxwellian distribution function (MDF) and in some cases small deviations are\ndescribed using the perturbation theory. The deviations with respect to the\nMaxwellian equilibrium, called kinetic effects, are required to be taken into\naccount specially for fusion reactor plasmas. Generally, because the\nperturbation theory is not consistent with observed steady-state\nnon-Maxwellians, these kinetic effects are numerically evaluated by very\nCPU-expensive codes, avoiding the analytic complexity of velocity phase space\nintegrals. We develop here a new method based on analytic non-Maxwellian\ndistribution functions constructed from non-orthogonal basis sets in order to\n(i) use as few parameters as possible, (ii) increase the efficiency to model\nnumerical and experimental non-Maxwellians, (iii) help to understand unsolved\nproblems such as diagnostics discrepancies from the physical interpretation of\nthe parameters, and (iv) obtain analytic corrections due to kinetic effects\ngiven by a small number of terms and removing the numerical error of the\nevaluation of velocity phase space integrals. This work does not attempt to\nderive new physical effects even if it could be possible to discover one from\nthe better understandings of some unsolved problems, but here we focus on the\nanalytic prediction of kinetic corrections from analytic non-Maxwellians. As\napplications, examples of analytic kinetic corrections are shown for the\nsecondary electron emission, the Langmuir probe characteristic curve, and the\nentropy. This is done by using three analytic representations of the\ndistribution function: the Kappa (KDF), the bi-modal or a new interpreted\nnon-Maxwellian (INMDF) distribution function. [...]\n", "  We study von Neumann measurement-related matrices, and the nullity condition\nof quantum correlation. We investigate the properties of these matrices that\nare related to a von Neumann measurement. It is shown that these (m^2-1)*\n(m^2-1) matrices are idempotent, and have rank m-1. These properties give rise\nto necessary conditions for the nullity of quantum correlations in bipartite\nsystems. Finally, as an example we discuss quantum correlation in Bell diagonal\nstates.\n", "  We study maximally entangled states and fully entangled fraction in general\nd'\\otimes d (d'\\geq d) systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\nmaximally entangled pure and mixed states are presented. As a natural\ngeneralization of the usual fully entangled fraction for d\\otimes d systems, we\ndefine the maximal overlap between a given quantum state and the maximally\nentangled states as the fully entangled fraction in d'\\otimes d systems. The\nproperties of this fully entangled fraction and its relations to quantum\nteleportation have been analyzed. The witness for detecting maximally entangled\nstates and quantum states that are useful for quantum teleportation is\nprovided.\n", "  Detection of individual luminous sources during the reionization epoch and\ncosmic dawn through their signatures in the HI 21-cm signal is one of the\ndirect approaches to probe the epoch. Here, we summarize our previous works on\nthis and present preliminary results on the prospects of detecting such sources\nusing the SKA1-low experiment. We first discuss the expected HI 21-cm signal\naround luminous sources at different stages of reionization and cosmic dawn. We\nthen introduce two visibility based estimators for detecting such signal: one\nbased on the matched filtering technique and the other relies on simply combing\nthe visibility signal from different baselines and frequency channels.\n  We find that that the SKA1-low should be able to detect ionized bubbles of\nradius $R_b \\gtrsim 10$ Mpc with $\\sim 100$ hr of observations at redshift $z\n\\sim 8$ provided that the mean outside neutral Hydrogen fraction $ x_{\\rm HI}\n\\gtrsim 0.5$. We also investigate the possibility of detecting HII regions\naround known bright QSOs such as around ULASJ1120+0641 discovered by Mortlock\net al. 2011. We find that a $5 \\sigma$ detection is possible with $600$ hr of\nSKA1-low observations if the QSO age and the outside $ x_{\\rm HI} $ are at\nleast $\\sim 2 \\times 10^7$ Myr and $\\sim 0.2$ respectively.\n  Finally, we investigate the possibility of detecting the very first X-ray and\nLy-$\\alpha$ sources during the cosmic dawn. We consider mini-QSOs like sources\nwhich emits in X-ray frequency band. We find that with a total $\\sim 1000$ hr\nof observations, SKA1-low should be able to detect those sources individually\nwith a $\\sim 9 \\sigma$ significance at redshift $z=15$. We summarize how the\nSNR changes with various parameters related to the source properties.\n", "  We discuss the prospects of using the redshifted 21~cm emission from neutral\nhydrogen in the post-reionization epoch to study our universe. The main aim of\nthe article is to highlight the efforts of Indian scientists in this area with\nthe SKA in mind. It turns out that the intensity mapping surveys from SKA can\nbe instrumental in obtaining tighter constraints on the dark energy models.\nCross-correlation of the HI intensity maps with the Ly$\\alpha$ forest data can\nalso be useful in measuring the BAO scale.\n", "  The JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC E56) experiment aims to search for a sterile neutrino at\nthe J-PARC Materials and Life Sciences Experimental Facility (MLF). After the\nsubmission of a proposal to the J-PARC PAC, Stage-1 approval was granted to the\nJSNS$^2$ experiment on April 2015.This approval followed a series of background\nmeasurements which were performed in 2014.\n  Recently, funding (the grant-in-aid for scientific research (S)) in Japan for\nbuilding one 25~ton fiducial volume detector module was approved for the\nexperiment. Therefore, we aim to start the experiment with one detector in\nJFY2018-2019. We are now working to produce precise cost estimates and schedule\nfor construction, noting that most of the detector components can be produced\nwithin one year from the date of order. This will be reported at the next PAC\nmeeting.\n  In parallel to the detector construction schedule, JSNS$^2$ will submit a\nTechnical Design report (TDR) to obtain the Stage-2 approval from the J-PARC\nPAC.The recent progress of the R$\\&$D efforts towards this TDR are shown in\nthis report. In particular, the R$\\&$D status of the liquid scintillator,\ncosmic ray veto system, and software are shown.\n  We have performed a test-experiment using 1.6~L of liquid scintillator at the\n3rd floor of the MLF building in order to determine the identities of\nnon-neutrino background particles coming to this detector location during the\nproton bunch. This is the so-called \"MLF 2015AU0001\" experiment. We briefly\nshow preliminary results from this test-experiment.\n", "  Recently CMS and ATLAS announced that they had measured the Higgs boson\nparity. Here we note that their approach can determine this parity only under\nthe additional assumption that this particle has a definite parity.\n  If parity conservation is violated in the Higgs sector, the parity of\nobserved \"Higgs\" boson does not exist. The approach used in the mentioned\nexperiments does not allow to observe such opportunity. In this sense titles of\nmentioned CMS and ATLAS publications are misleading.\n", "  Nanoscale multifunctional perpendicular organic spin valves have been\nfabricated. The devices based on an La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/Alq$_3$/Co\ntrilayer show resistive switching of up to 4-5 orders of magnitude and\nmagnetoresistance as high as -70% the latter even changing sign when voltage\npulses are applied. This combination of phenomena is typically observed in\nmultiferroic tunnel junctions where it is attributed to magnetoelectric\ncoupling between a ferromagnet and a ferroelectric material. Modeling indicates\nthat here the switching originates from a modification of the\nLa$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ surface. This modification influences the tunneling\nof charge carriers and thus both the electrical resistance and the tunneling\nmagnetoresistance which occurs at pinholes in the organic layer.\n", "  We consider the random point processes on a measure space X defined by the\nGibbs measures associated to a given sequence of N-particle Hamiltonians\nH^{(N)}. Inspired by the method of Messer-Spohn for proving concentration\nproperties for the laws of the corresponding empirical measures, we propose a\nnumber of hypotheses on H^{(N)} which are quite general, but still strong\nenough to extend the approach of Messer-Spohn. The hypotheses are formulated in\nterms of the asymptotics of the corresponding mean energy functionals. We show\nthat in many situations the approach even yields a Large Deviation Principle\n(LDP) for the corresponding laws. Connections to Gamma-convergence of (free)\nenergy type functionals at different levels are also explored. The focus is on\ndifferences between positive and negative temperature situations, motivated by\napplications to complex geometry. The results yield, in particular, large\ndeviation principles at positive as well as negative temperatures for quite\ngeneral classes of singular mean field models with pair interactions,\ngeneralizing the 2D vortex model and Coulomb gases. In a companion paper the\nresults are illustrated in the setting of Coulomb and Riesz type gases on a\nRiemannian manifold X, comparing with the complex geometric setting.\n", "  In the present work we grow self-organized TiO2 nanotube arrays with a\ndefined and controlled regular spacing between individual nanotubes. These\ndefined intertube gaps allow to build up hierarchical 1D-branched structures,\nconformally coated on the nanotube walls using a layer by layer nanoparticle\nTiO2 decoration of the individual tubes, i.e. having not only a high control\nover the TiO2 nanotube host structure but also on the harvesting layers. After\noptimizing the intertube spacing, we build host-guest arrays that show a\ndrastically enhanced performance in photocatalytic H2 generation, compared to\nany arrangement of conventional TiO2 nanotubes or conventional TiO2\nnanoparticle layers. We show this beneficial effect to be due to a combination\nof increased large surface area (mainly provided by the nanoparticle layers)\nwith a fast transport of the harvested charge within the passivated 1D\nnanotubes. We anticipate that this type of hierarchical structures based on\nTiO2 nanotubes with adjustable spacing will find even wider application, as\nthey provide an unprecedented controllable combination of surface area and\ncarrier transport.\n", "  New diffuse interface and sharp interface models for soluble and insoluble\nsurfactants fulfilling energy inequalities are introduced. We discuss their\nrelation with the help of asymptotic analysis and present an existence result\nfor a particular diffuse interface model.\n", "  We present and analyze new exact gyraton solutions of algebraic type II on\ngeneralized Melvin universe of type D which admit non-vanishing cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$. We show that it generalizes both, gyraton solutions on\nMelvin and on direct product spacetimes. When we set $\\Lambda = 0$ we get\nsolutions on Melvin spacetime and for $\\Sigma = 1$ we obtain solutions on\ndirect product spacetimes. We demonstrate that the solutions are member of the\nKundt family of spacetimes as its subcases. We show that the Einstein equations\nreduce to a set of equations on the transverse 2-space. We also discuss the\npolynomial scalar invariants which are non-constant in general but constant for\nsub-solutions on direct product spacetimes.\n", "  Manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is essential in\nOAM-based optical systems. Especially, OAM divider, which can convert the\nincoming OAM mode into one or several new smaller modes in proportion at\ndifferent spatial paths, is very useful in OAM-based optical networks. However,\nthis useful tool was never reported yet. For the first time, we put forward a\npassive OAM divider based on coordinate transformation. The device consists of\na Cartesian to log-polar coordinate converter and an inverse converter. The\nfirst converter converts the OAM light into a rectangular-shaped plane light\nwith a transverse phase gradient. And the second converter converts the plane\nlight into multiple diffracted light. The OAM of zeroth-order diffracted light\nis the product of the input OAM and the scaling parameter. The residual light\nis output from other diffracted orders. Furthermore, we extend the scheme to\nrealize equal N-dividing of OAM and arbitrary dividing of OAM. The ability of\ndividing OAM shows huge potential for OAM-based classical and quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  The exchange interaction determines the ferromagnetic (FM) or\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of atomic spins. When ferromagnets and\nantiferromagnets are coupled together, they often exhibit the exchange bias\neffect, a unidirectional interface exchange field causing a shift of the\nmagnetic hysteresis loop. The effective magnitude of this interface exchange\nfield is at most a few percent of the bulk exchange, arising from pinned\ninterfacial spins in the antiferromagnet. The pinned spins are known to\ncomprise a small fraction of the total number of interface spins, yet their\nexact nature and physical origin has so far been elusive. Here we show that in\nthe technologically important $\\gamma - IrMn_3/CoFe$ structure the pinned\ninterface spins are in fact delocalised over the whole interface layer. The\npinned spins arise from the small imbalance of the number of spins in each\nmagnetic sublattice in the antiferromagnet due to the natural atomic disorder.\nThese pinned spins are strongly coupled to the bulk antiferromagnet explaining\ntheir remarkable stability. Moreover, we find that the ferromagnet strongly\ndistorts the interface spin structure of the antiferromagnet, causing a large\nreversible interface magnetisation that does not contribute to exchange bias.\nThe unexpected delocalised nature of the pinned interface spins explains both\ntheir small number and their stability, uncovering the mysterious microscopic\norigin of the exchange bias effect.\n", "  We study Gibbs distributions of spins taking values in a general compact\nPolish space, interacting via a pair potential along the edges of a generalized\nrandom graph with a given asymptotic weight distribution $P$, obtained by\nannealing over the random graph distribution.\n  First we prove a variational formula for the corresponding annealed pressure\nand provide criteria for absence of phase transitions in the general case.\n  We furthermore study classes of models with second order phase transitions\nwhich include rotation-invariant models on spheres and models on intervals, and\nclassify their critical exponents. We find critical exponents which are\nmodified relative to the corresponding mean-field values when $P$ becomes too\nheavy-tailed, in which case they move continuously with the tail-exponent of\n$P$. For large classes of models they are the same as for the Ising model\ntreated in \\cite{DomGiaGibHofPri16}. On the other hand, we provide conditions\nunder which the model is in a different universality class, and construct an\nexplicit example of such a model on the interval.\n", "  The interfaces between organic molecules and metal surfaces with layered\nantiferromagnetic order have gained increasing interests in the field of\nantiferromagnetic spintronics. The C60 layered AFM spinterfaces have been\nstudied for C60 bonded only to the outermost ferromagnetic layer. Using density\nfunctional theory calculations, here we demonstrate that C60 adsorption can\nreconstruct the layered AFM Cr(001) surface so that C60 bonds to the top two Cr\nlayers with opposite spin direction. Surface reconstruction drastically changes\nC60 s spintronic properties 1 the spin-split p-d hybridization involve\nmulti-orbitals of C60 and metal double layers, 2 the subsurface layer dominates\nthe C60 spin properties, and 3) reconstruction induces a large magnetic moment\nin C60 of 0.58 B, which is a synergetic effect of the top two layers as a\nresult of a magnetic direct-exchange interaction. Understanding these complex\nspinterfaces phenomena is a crucial step for their device applications. The\nsurface reconstruction can be realized by annealing at above room temperature\nin experiments.\n", "  Protostellar discs may become massive enough to fragment producing secondary\nlow-mass objects: planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. We study the effect\nof radiative feedback from such newly-formed secondary objects using radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We compare the results of simulations without any\nradiative feedback from secondary objects with those where two types of\nradiative feedback are considered: (i) continuous, and (ii) episodic. We find\nthat: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses\nfurther fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)\nepisodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the\noutburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes\nunstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed\ncompared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass\ngrowth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due to the effect of their\nradiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form\nin the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses\nare not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback. We find\nthat the masses of secondary objects formed by disc fragmentation are from a\nfew M$_{\\rm J}$ to a few 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$. Planets formed by fragmentation tend\nto be ejected from the disc. We conclude that planetary-mass objects on wide\norbits (wide-orbit planets) are unlikely to form by disc fragmentation.\nNevertheless, disc fragmentation may be a significant source of free-floating\nplanets and brown dwarfs.\n", "  The emerging field of quantum machine learning has the potential to\nsubstantially aid in the problems and scope of artificial intelligence. This is\nonly enhanced by recent successes in the field of classical machine learning.\nIn this work we propose an approach for the systematic treatment of machine\nlearning, from the perspective of quantum information. Our approach is general\nand covers all three main branches of machine learning: supervised,\nunsupervised and reinforcement learning. While quantum improvements in\nsupervised and unsupervised learning have been reported, reinforcement learning\nhas received much less attention. Within our approach, we tackle the problem of\nquantum enhancements in reinforcement learning as well, and propose a\nsystematic scheme for providing improvements. As an example, we show that\nquadratic improvements in learning efficiency, and exponential improvements in\nperformance over limited time periods, can be obtained for a broad class of\nlearning problems.\n", "  The magnetic Ap or CP2 stars are natural atomic and magnetic laboratories and\nideal testing grounds for the evaluation of model atmospheres. CP2 stars\nexhibiting photometric variability are traditionally referred to as alpha2\nCanum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. Strictly periodic changes are observed in\nthe spectra and brightness of these stars, which allow the derivation of\nrotational periods. Related to this group of objects are the He-weak (CP4) and\nHe-rich stars, some of which are also known to undergo brightness changes due\nto rotational modulation. Increasing the sample size of known rotational\nperiods among CP2/4 stars is an important task, which will contribute to our\nunderstanding of these objects and their evolution in time. We have compiled an\nextensive target list of magnetic chemically peculiar (CP2/4) stars. In\naddition to that, a systematic investigation of early-type (spectral types B/A)\nvariable stars of undetermined type in the International Variable Star Index of\nthe AAVSO (VSX) yielded additional ACV candidates, which were included in our\nsample. We investigated our sample stars using publicly available observations\nfrom the ASAS-3 archive. We were able to identify another 360 stars exhibiting\nphotometric variability in the accuracy limit of the ASAS-3 data, thereby\nconcluding our search for photometrically variable magnetic chemically peculiar\nstars in the ASAS-3 archive. Summary data, folded light curves and, if\navailable, information from the literature are presented for all variable stars\nof our sample, which is composed of 334 bona-fide ACV variables, 23 ACV\ncandidates and three eclipsing binary systems. In particular, we call attention\nto HD 66051 (V414 Pup), which was identified as an eclipsing binary system\nshowing obvious rotational modulation of the light curve due to the presence of\nan ACV variable in the system.\n", "  I shall discuss the history of Indian astronomy, Aurveda (life science),\nchemistry and metallurgy to illustrate how downgrading experiments from\nscientific learning lead to the decline of ancient Indian science and\ncivilization. We shall see that in the glorious period of ancient Indian\ncivilization, lasting up to the 9th century, there was close interaction\nbetween experimental investigations and theoretical analyses in each of these\nsciences. This was further augmented by two-way interactions with the other\nadvanced civilizations of that time. But both these interactions came to an end\naround 9th century, leading to the stagnation and decline of Indian science and\ncivilization over the next thousand years. This was the cause rather than the\nconsequence of its subjugation by external invaders, though it was no doubt\naggravated by the latter.\n", "  In this paper we study the current-induced spin polarization in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas, known also as the Edelstein effect. Compared to\nprevious treatments, we consider both the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ninteraction as well as the spin-orbit interaction from impurity scattering. In\nevaluating the Kubo formula for the spin polarization response to an applied\nelectric field, we explicitly take into account the side-jump and\nskew-scattering effects. We show that the inclusion of side-jump and\nskew-scattering modifies the expression of the current-induced spin\npolarization.\n", "  The peculiar role of heavy-flavour observables in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions is discussed. Produced in the early stage, $c$ and $b$ quarks cross\nthe hot medium arising from the collision, interacting strongly with the\nlatter, until they hadronize. Depending on the strength of the interaction\nheavy quarks may or not approach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma, tending\nin the first case to follow the collective flow of the expanding fireball. The\npresence of a hot deconfined medium may also affect heavy-quark hadronization,\nbeing possible for them to recombine with the surrounding light thermal\npartons, so that the final heavy-flavour hadrons inherit part of the flow of\nthe medium. Here we show how it is possible to develop a complete transport\nsetup allowing one to describe heavy-flavour production in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions, displaying some major results one can obtain. Information coming\nfrom recent lattice-QCD simulations concerning both the heavy-flavour transport\ncoefficients in the hot QCD plasma and the nature of the charmed degrees around\nthe deconfinement transition is also presented. Finally, the possibility that\nthe formation of a hot deconfined medium even in small systems\n(high-multiplicity p-Au and d-Au collisions, so far) may affect also\nheavy-flavour observables is investigated.\n", "  We present the experimentally obtained single-molecule (SM) surface-enhanced\nRaman scattering (SERS) spectrum of 4-aminibenzenethiol (4-ABT), also known as\npara-aminothiophenol (PATP). Measured at a 4-ABT concentration of 8 * 10^-10 M,\nthe spectra show Raman forbidden modes. The SM-SERS spectrum of 4-ABT obtained\nusing a non-resonant visible laser is different from the previously reported\nSERS spectra of 4-ABT, and could not be reconstructed using quantum mechanical\ncalculations. Careful classical assignments (not based on quantum-mechanical\ncalculations) are reported, and indicate that differences in the reported\nspectra of 4-ABT are mainly due to the appearance of Raman forbidden bands. The\npresence of Raman forbidden bands can be explained by the charge-transfer (CT)\neffect of 4-ABT adsorbed on the silver nanostructures, indicating a breakdown\nof Raman selection rules at the SERS hotspot.\n", "  We show on theoretical grounds that, even in the presence of noise,\nprobabilistic measurement strategies (which have a certain probability of\nfailure or abstention) can provide, upon a heralded successful outcome,\nestimates with a precision that exceeds the deterministic bounds for the\naverage precision. This establishes a new ultimate bound on the phase\nestimation precision of particular measurement outcomes (or sequence of\noutcomes). For probe systems subject to local dephasing, we quantify such\nprecision limit as a function of the probability of failure that can be\ntolerated. Our results show that the possibility of abstaining can set back the\ndetrimental effects of noise.\n", "  In high-energy scattering processes involving two or more hadrons one can\nmeasure observables that are sensitive to partonic transverse momentum, which\nis encoded in so-called transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs), also called TMDs. These functions correspond to Fourier\ntransforms of matrix elements that contain process-dependent gauge links. As\nthe energy associated to the collision process increases, one becomes more\nsensitive to the small-$x$ region which is dominated by gluon rather than quark\nTMDs. In this paper we study the leading-twist gluon TMDs in the small-$x$\nlimit for the dipole-type gauge link structure, for both unpolarized and vector\npolarized hadrons. In the limit $x\\to0$, the gluon-gluon correlator reduces to\na correlator that consists of a single Wilson loop. This is used to obtain a\nsimple description of gluon TMDs in the small-$x$ region: some of the functions\nvanish, while others become proportional to each other.\n", "  Localization and delocalization of two photons in an array of cavities are\nexamined. Role of entanglement and relative phase of the initial state in the\noccurrence of localization or delocalization during time evolution is\nelucidated.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to restore genuine tripartite entanglement\nunder local amplitude damping. We show that it is possible to protect genuine\nentanglement using CNOT and Hadamard gates. We analyze several ordering of such\nrecovery operations. We find that for recovery operations applied after\nexposing qubits to decoherence, there is no enhancement in lifetime of genuine\nentanglement. Actual retrieval of entanglement is only possible when reversal\nscheme is applied before and after the decoherence process. We find that\nretrieval of entanglement for mixture of $|\\widetilde{W}\\rangle$ state with\nwhite noise is more evident than the respective mixture of $|W\\rangle$ state.\nWe also find the retrieval of entanglement for similar mixture of $|GHZ\\rangle$\nstate as well.\n", "  The full scientific potential of the VLTI with its second generation\ninstruments MATISSE and GRAVITY require fringe tracking up to magnitudes K>14\nwith the UTs and K>10 with the ATs. The GRAVITY fringe tracker (FT) will be\nlimited to K~10.5 with UTs and K~7.5 with ATs, for fundamental conceptual\nreasons: the flux of each telescope is distributed among 3 cophasing pairs and\nthen among 5 spectral channels for coherencing. To overcome this limit we\npropose a new FT concept, called Hierarchical Fringe Tracker (HFT) that cophase\npairs of apertures with all the flux from two apertures and only one spectral\nchannel. When the pair is cophased, most of the flux is transmitted as if it\nwas produced by an unique single mode beam and then used to cophase pairs of\npairs and then pairs of groups. At the deeper level, the flux is used in an\noptimized dispersed fringe device for coherencing. On the VLTI such a system\nallows a gain of about 3 magnitudes over the GRAVITY FT. On interferometers\nwith more apertures such as CHARA (6 telescopes) or a future Planet Formation\nImager (12 to 20 telescopes), the HFT would be even more decisive, as its\nperformance does not decrease with the number of apertures. It would allow\nbuilding a PFI reaching a coherent magnitude H~10 with 16 apertures with\ndiameters smaller than 2 m. We present the HFT concept, the first steps of its\nfeasibility demonstration from computer simulations and the optical design of a\n4 telescopes HFT prototype.\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) is a project for a very large optical\ninterferometer intended to obtain images of the planet formation process at\nscales as small as the Hill sphere of giant exoplanets. Its main science\ninstruments will work in the thermal infrared but it will be cophased in the\nnear infrared, where it requires also some capacity for scientific imaging. PFI\nimaging and resolution specifications imply an array of 12 to 20 apertures and\nbaselines up to a few kilometers cophased at near infrared coherent magnitudes\nas large as 10. This paper discusses various cophasing architectures and the\ncorresponding minimum diameter of individual apertures, which is the dominant\nelement of PFI cost estimates. From a global analysis of the possible\ncombinations of pairwise fringe sensors, we show that conventional approaches\nused in current interferometers imply the use of prohibitively large telescopes\nand we indicate the innovative strategies that would allow building PFI with\naffordable apertures smaller than 2 m in diameter. The approach with the best\npotential appears to be Hierarchical Fringe Tracking based on \"two beams\nspatial filters\" that cophase pairs of neighboring telescopes with all the\nefficiency of a two telescopes fringe tracker and transmit most of the flux as\nif it was produced by an unique single mode aperture to cophase pairs of pairs\nand then pairs of groups of apertures. We consider also the adaptation to PFI\nof more conventional approaches such as a combination of GRAVITY like fringe\ntrackers or single or multiple chains of 2T fringe trackers.\n", "  The decay of the proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si was studied by a silicon array\ncoupled with germanium clover detectors. Nine charged-particle groups are\nobserved and most of them are recognized as $\\beta$-delayed proton emission. A\ncharged-particle group at 5600 keV is identified experimentally as\n$\\beta$-delayed two-proton emission from the isobaric analog state of\n$^{22}$Al. Another charged-particle emission without any $\\beta$ particle at\nthe low energy less than 300 keV is observed. The half-life of $^{22}$Si is\ndetermined as 27.5 (18) ms. The experimental results of $\\beta$-decay of\n$^{22}$Si are compared and in nice agreement with shell-model calculations. The\nmass excess of the ground state of $^{22}$Si deduced from the experimental data\nshows that three-nucleon (3N) forces with repulsive contributions have\nsignificant effects on nuclei near the proton drip line.\n", "  $^{117m}$Sn is one of the radioisotopes can be beneficially produced through\nalpha particle irradiation. The targets were prepared by deposition of\n$^{116}$Cd metal onto high purity 12 $\\mu$m thick Cu backing. The average\ndeposited thickness was 21.9 $\\mu$m. The beam energy was thoroughly measured by\nTime of Flight (TOF) methods and proved to be 51.2 MeV. For the experiment the\nwell-established stacked foil technique was used. In addition to the Cd\ntargets, Ti foils were also inserted into the stacks for energy and intensity\nmonitoring. The Cu backings were also used for monitoring and as recoil catcher\nof the reaction products from the cadmium layer. The activities of the\nirradiated foils were measured with HPGe detector for gamma-ray spectrometry\nand cross section values were determined. As a result excitation functions for\nthe formation of $^{117m}$Sn, $^{117m,g}$In, $^{116m}$In, $^{115m}$In and\n$^{115m,g}$Cd from enriched $^{116}$Cd were deduced and compared with the\navailable literature data and with the results of the nuclear reaction model\ncode calculations EMPIRE 3.2 and TALYS 1.8. Yield curves were also deduced for\nthe measured nuclear reactions and compared with the literature.\n", "  The solar active region NOAA 11719 produced a large two-ribbon flare on 11\nApril 2013. We have investigated the sudden variations in the photospheric\nmagnetic fields in this active region during the flare employing the\nmagnetograms obtained in the spectral line Fe I 6173 Angstrom by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). The analysis of the line-of-sight magnetograms from HMI show sudden and\npersistent magnetic field changes at different locations of the active region\nbefore the onset of the flare and during the flare. The vector magnetic field\nobservations available from HMI also show coincident variations in the total\nmagnetic field strength and its inclination angle at these locations. Using the\nsimultaneous Dopplergrams obtained from HMI, we observe perturbations in the\nphotospheric Doppler signals following the sudden changes in the magnetic\nfields in the aforementioned locations. The power spectrum analysis of these\nvelocity signals show enhanced acoustic power in these affected locations\nduring the flare as compared to the pre-flare condition. Accompanying these\nobservations, we have also used the near-simultaneous chromospheric\nobservations obtained in the spectral line H-alpha 6562.8 Angstrom by the\nGlobal Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to study the evolution of flare ribbons\nand intensity oscillations in the active region. The H-alpha intensity\noscillations also show enhanced oscillatory power during the flare in the\naforementioned locations. These results indicate that the transient Lorentz\nforce associated with the sudden changes in the magnetic fields could drive the\nlocalized photospheric and chromospheric oscillations, like the flare-induced\noscillations in the solar atmosphere.\n", "  The appraisal of metallic materials requires application of advanced\ncharacterisation techniques. In this paper, the use has been made of Scanning\nElectron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD)\nand Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy techniques to characterise\nmorphological, structural and chemical composition of 316-stainless steel and\nunknown brass sample. The determined lattice parameter of unknown brass sample\nwas 3.6812A and consisted of 63% Cu and 37% Zn by weight. The XRD analysis\nindicated a faced-centred-cubic crystal structure and the sample concluded to\nbe an alpha brass. The measured dislocation density in 316-stainless steel\nincreased with increasing plastic strain and the dislocation structures varied\nfrom relatively uniform distribution at low strains to cell-like structures at\nhigh strains. The spread of X-ray diffraction peak related linearly with the\ndislocation content of 316-stainless steel.\n", "  The demand for building material is ever increasing owing to population\ngrowth. Compacted clay bricks are an important integral building material\nespecially for low cost durable and affordable housing segment. This is a\nvalued building material since its properties can be modified to suit various\nloading conditions. In this paper, the mechanical and physical properties of\nclay bricks modified with varying proportions of sawdust and polystyrene are\ndetermined. Increment of non-clay material proportion in the modified-clay\nbricks increases their porosity and water absorbency while their bulk\ndensities, compressive and flexural strengths decreases. The use is made of\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method to assess the surface deformation\nbehavior of the modified-clay bricks under uniaxial compressive loading. The\ndistribution of surface deformation as assessed through PIV method is\nrelatively uniform in pure-clay bricks while modified-clay bricks indicates a\nnon-uniform deformation localized near the loading point at low strains. The\nstrain distribution progressively spread out in the modifiedclay brick as the\nfailure point is approached.\n", "  Shape optimization of an active and a passive drag-reducing device on a\ntwo-dimensional D-shaped bluff body is performed. The two devices are: Coanda\nactuator, and randomly-shaped trailing-edge flap. The optimization sequence is\nperformed by coupling the genetic algorithm software DAKOTA to the mesh\ngenerator Pointwise and to the CFD solver OpenFOAM. For the the active device\nthe cost functional is the power ratio, whereas for the passive device it is\nthe drag coefficient. The optimization leads to total power savings of $\\approx\n70\\%$ for the optimal Coanda actuator, and a 40\\% drag reduction for the\noptimal flap. This reduction is mainly achieved through streamlining the base\nflow and suppressing the vortex shedding. The addition of either an active or a\npassive device creates two additional smaller recirculation regions in the base\ncavity that shifts the larger recirculation region away from the body and\nincreases the base pressure. The results are validated against more refined\nURANS simulations for selected cases.\n", "  It is well known that state transformation from one polarization state to\nanother can be achieved with a minimal gadget consisting of two quarter\nwaveplates. A constructive, geometric approach is presented, which provides a\ndirect prescription for the fast axis setting of the waveplates to transform\nany completely polarized states of light to any other, including orthogonal\nones.\n", "  The magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability has been shown to play a key role in\nmany astrophysical systems. The equation for the growth rate of this\ninstability in the incompressible limit, and the most-unstable mode that can be\nderived from it, are often used to estimate the strength of the magnetic field\nthat is associated with the observed dynamics. However, there are some issues\nwith the interpretations given. Here we show that the class of most unstable\nmodes $k_u$ for a given $\\theta$, the class of modes often used to estimate the\nstrength of the magnetic field from observations, for the system leads to the\ninstability growing as $\\sigma^2=1/2 A g k_u$, a growth rate which is\nindependent of the strength of the magnetic field and which highlights that\nsmall scales are preferred by the system, but not does not give the fastest\ngrowing mode for that given $k$. We also highlight that outside of the\ninterchange ($\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0$) and undular ($\\mathbf{k}$ parallel\nto $\\mathbf{B}$) modes, all the other modes have a perturbation pair of the\nsame wavenumber and growth rate that when excited in the linear regime can\nresult in an interference pattern that gives field aligned filamentary\nstructure often seen in 3D simulations. The analysis was extended to a sheared\nmagnetic field, where it was found that it was possible to extend the results\nfor a non-sheared field to this case. We suggest that without magnetic shear it\nis too simplistic to be used to infer magnetic field strengths in astrophysical\nsystems.\n", "  There is a curious absence of legal constraints on U.S. government agencies\nundertaking potentially risky scientific research. Some of these activities may\npresent a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law\nleaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall\nwithin the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and\nunder what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such\nnon-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only\ninteresting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of\nagency competence and the role of the courts.\n  Two case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium\npower supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers\nin the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy\nparticle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider)\nthat allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a \"killer\nstrangelet\"). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights\nfrom neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and\ncognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in\nlow-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of\njudging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges\nworking in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns\nsuggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to\nlegal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency\nactions that are non-regulatory in nature.\n", "  The calibration and validation of pedestrian simulations require the\nacquisition of empirical evidences of human behaviour. The current work\npresents the results of an experiment focused on the potentially combined\neffect of counter flow and grouping on pedestrian dynamics. In particular, we\nfocused on: (i) four different configurations of flow ratio (the rate between\nthe minor flow and the total flow in bidirectional scenarios); (ii) dyads, as\nthe most frequently observed and basic social groups of crowds. Results showed\nthat the increase of flow ratio negatively impacted the speed of pedestrians.\nDyads walked significantly slower than singletons, due to the difficulty in\nmovement coordination among group members (proxemics) in case of counter flow.\nThe collected results represent an useful contribution towards the validation\nof pedestrian simulations.\n", "  Space-time intervals corresponding to different events on the worldline of\nany ponderable object (for example a clock) are time-like. In consequence, in\nthe analysis of any space-time experiment involving clocks only the region for\n$c\\Delta t \\ge 0$ between the line $\\Delta x = 0$ and the light cone projection\n$c\\Delta t = \\Delta x$ of the $c\\Delta t$ versus $\\Delta x$ Minkowski plot is\nphysically relevant. This breaks the manifest space-time symmetry of the plot.\nA further consequence is the unphysical nature of the `relativity of\nsimultaneity' and `length contraction' effects of conventional special\nrelativity theory. The only modification of space-time transformation laws in\npassing from Galilean to special relativity is then the replacement of\nuniversal Newtonian time by a universal (position independent) time dilation\neffect for moving clocks.\n", "  The exact charge conservation significantly impacts multiplicity\nfluctuations. The result depends strongly on the part of the system charge\ncarried by the particles of interest. Along with the expected suppression of\nfluctuations for large systems, charge conservation may lead to negative\nskewness or kurtosis for small systems.\n", "  We review the status of calculations in the Standard Model Effective Field\nTheory (SMEFT) beyond leading order (LO). Improving the SMEFT beyond LO allows\ntheoretical errors to be characterized and reduced when considering SMEFT\ninterpretations of the data, which is essential considering the improving\nexperimental precision at LHC. Next to leading order results also allow a more\nconsistent analysis of measurements with different effective scales in the\nSMEFT. Going beyond LO is clearly important in the event that deviations from\nthe SM are large enough that experimental indications of physics beyond the SM\nemerge. We discuss a consistent and well defined approach to LO in the SMEFT,\nso that the improvement to NLO is straightforward. We discuss the basic issues\ninvolved in improving calculations to NLO in the SMEFT, and review the advances\nin this direction that have been achieved to date.\n", "  This work is focused on the theory of Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM). In the\nfirst part of this work we present a brief review of gravitoelectromagnetism,\nwe locate and discuss all the problems which appear in this approach. We also\ntry to avoid these problems by proposing new approaches in which we use the\nadditional degrees of freedom of the gravitational field. In the second part of\nthis work, we review our previous work regarding the construction of a\ntensorial theory, using the formalism of General Relativity, which aims to\ndescribe the true electromagnetism. We also extend this theory in order to make\nit more realistic. Finally in the third part of this work, we investigate the\nexistence of gravitational invariants similar to the electromagnetic ones.\n", "  I investigate the consistency of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift\nSurvey v7 galaxy sample with the expansion history and linear growth rate\npredicted by General Relativity (GR) and a Planck (2015) cosmology. To do so, I\nmeasure the redshift-space power spectrum, which is anisotropic due to both\nredshift-space distortions (RSD) and the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. In\nChapter 6, I place constraints of $f \\sigma_8(0.76) = 0.44 \\pm 0.04$ and $f\n\\sigma_8(1.05) = 0.28 \\pm 0.08$, which remain consistent with GR at 95%\nconfidence. Marginalising over the anisotropic AP effect degrades the\nconstraints by a factor of three but allows $F_{AP} \\equiv (1+z) D_A H/c$ to be\nsimultaneously constrained. The VIPERS v7 joint-posterior on $(f \\sigma_8,\nF_{AP})$ shows no compelling deviation from GR.\n  Chapter 7 investigates the inclusion of a simple density transform:\n`clipping' prior to the RSD analysis. This tackles the root-cause of\nnon-linearity and may extend the validity of perturbation theory. Moreover,\nthis marked statistic would amplify signatures of shielded modified gravity\nmodels and includes information not available to the power spectrum. I show\nthat a linear real-space power spectrum with a Kaiser factor and a Lorentzian\ndamping yields a significant bias without clipping, but that this may be\nremoved with a strict threshold; similar behaviour is observed for the data.\nEstimates of $f \\sigma_8$ for different thresholds are highly correlated, but\nthis may be obtained using mocks. A maximum likelihood estimate from a\ncombination of thresholds is shown to achieve a 16% decrease in statistical\nerror relative to a single-threshold estimate. The results are encouraging to\ndate but represent a work in progress; the final analysis will be submitted to\nAstronomy & Astrophysics as Wilson et al. (2016).\n", "  On-line social networks are complex ensembles of inter-linked communities\nthat interact on different topics. Some communities are characterized by what\nare usually referred to as deviant behaviors, conducts that are commonly\nconsidered inappropriate with respect to the society's norms or moral\nstandards. Eating disorders, drug use, and adult content consumption are just a\nfew examples. We refer to such communities as deviant networks. It is commonly\nbelieved that such deviant networks are niche, isolated social groups, whose\nactivity is well separated from the mainstream social-media life. According to\nthis assumption, research studies have mostly considered them in isolation. In\nthis work we focused on adult content consumption networks, which are present\nin many on-line social media and in the Web in general. We found that few small\nand densely connected communities are responsible for most of the content\nproduction. Differently from previous work, we studied how such communities\ninteract with the whole social network. We found that the produced content\nflows to the rest of the network mostly directly or through bridge-communities,\nreaching at least 450 times more users. We also show that a large fraction of\nthe users can be inadvertently exposed to such content through indirect content\nresharing. We also discuss a demographic analysis of the producers and\nconsumers networks. Finally, we show that it is easily possible to identify a\nfew core users to radically uproot the diffusion process. We aim at setting the\nbasis to study deviant communities in context.\n", "  Lakes and many other geophysical flows are shallow, density stratified, and\ncontain a free-surface. Conventional studies on stratified shear instabilities\nmake Boussinesq approximation. Free-surface arising due to large density\nvariations between air and water cannot be taken into consideration under this\napproximation. Hence the free-surface is usually replaced by a rigid-lid, and\ntherefore has little effect on the stability of the fluid below it. In this\npaper we have performed non-Boussinesq linear stability analyses of a double\ncirculation velocity profile prevalent in two-layered density stratified lakes.\nOne of our analyses is performed by considering the presence of wind, while the\nother one considers quiescent air. Both analyses have shown similar growth\nrates and stability boundaries. We have compared our non-Boussinesq study with\na corresponding Boussinesq one. The maximum non-Boussinesq growth rate is found\nto be an order of magnitude greater than the maximum Boussinesq growth rate.\nFurthermore, the stability curves in these two studies are very different. The\nnon-Boussinesq instability as well as the Boussinseq one can become three\ndimensional in some sub-ranges of the bulk Richardson number. An analytical\nstudy has also been conducted on a simple broken-line profile representing\ndouble circulation in order to complement the numerical stability analysis. The\nanalytical growth rates are in good agreement with the non-Boussinesq numerical\ngrowth rates observed in continuous profiles. The physical mechanism behind\nthis non-Boussinesq instability is the resonant interaction between a surface\nvorticity-gravity wave existing at the free-surface (air-water interface), and\nan interfacial vorticity-gravity wave existing at the pycnocline (warm and cold\nwater interface). We expect similar kind of non-Boussinesq instability to occur\nin the upper layer of oceans.\n", "  We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the Manakov soliton trains\nperturbed by cross-modulation in the adiabatic approximation. The multisoliton\ninteractions in the adiabatic approximation are modeled by a generalized\nComplex Toda chain (GCTC). The cross-modulation requires special treating for\nthe evolution of the polarization vectors of the solitons. The numerical\npredictions of the Manakov system are compared with the perturbed GCTC. For\ncertain set of initial parameters GCTC describes very well the long-time\nevolution of the Manakov soliton trains.\n", "  Vector-boson fusion and vector-boson scattering are an important class of\nprocesses for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It is characterized by two\nhigh-energetic jets in the forward regions of the detector and reduced jet\nactivity in the central region. The higher center-of-mass energy during the\ncurrent and subsequent runs strongly boosts the sensitivity in these processes\nand allows to test the predictions of the Standard Model to a high precision.\n  In this review, we first present the main phenomenological features of\nvector-boson fusion and scattering processes. Then we discuss the effects of\nhigher-order corrections, which are available at NLO QCD for all processes and\nup to N3LO QCD and NLO electro-weak for VBF-H production. An additional\nrefinement is the addition of parton-shower effects, where recently a lot of\nprogress has been made. The appearance of triple and quartic gauge vertices in\nthe production processes enables us to probe anomalous gauge couplings. We\nintroduce and compare the different parametrizations used in the literature and\nalso discuss the issue of unitarity violation and common unitarization\nprocedures. Finally, we give a short overview of current and possible future\nexperimental searches.\n", "  A distinguishability operator is defined for the continuous-time quantum walk\n(CTQW) of a bipartite quantum walker on two simply connected graphs,\n$W_{G_i,G_j} = U_{G_i}\\left(t\\right) \\otimes U_{G_j}\\left(t'\\right) -\nU_{G_j}\\left(t'\\right) \\otimes U_{G_i}\\left(t\\right)$, where\n$U_{G_i}\\left(t\\right)$ is the unitary CTQW operator for a labeled graph $G_i$\nover a time interval $t$. The null space of $W_{G_i,G_j}$ defines the vector\nspace of initial bipartite states whose time development is either constant or\nonly dependent on $t + t'$ and is invariant to which quantum walker subsystem\ngoes with each graph. The set of null spaces corresponding with a set of\n$W_{G_i,G_j}$ have interesting relations as subspaces, intersections between\nsubspaces, and subspaces of intersections. These relations are depicted as\nEuler diagrams for labeled graphs of three and four vertices.\n", "  During the first steps of photosynthesis, the energy of impinging solar\nphotons is transformed into electronic excitation energy of the\nlight-harvesting biomolecular complexes. The subsequent energy transfer to the\nreaction center is understood in terms of exciton quasiparticles which move on\na grid of biomolecular sites on typical time scales less than 100 femtoseconds\n(fs). Since the early days of quantum mechanics, this energy transfer is\ndescribed as an incoherent Forster hopping with classical site occupation\nprobabilities, but with quantum mechanically determined rate constants. This\northodox picture has been challenged by ultrafast optical spectroscopy\nexperiments with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein in which interference\noscillatory signals up to 1.5 picoseconds were reported and interpreted as\ndirect evidence of exceptionally long-lived electronic quantum coherence. Here,\nwe show that the optical 2D photon echo spectra of this complex at ambient\ntemperature in aqueous solution do not provide evidence of any long-lived\nelectronic quantum coherence, but confirm the orthodox view of rapidly decaying\nelectronic quantum coherence on a time scale of 60 fs. Our results give no hint\nthat electronic quantum coherence plays any biofunctional role in real\nphotoactive biomolecular complexes. Since this natural energy transfer complex\nis rather small and has a structurally well defined protein with the distances\nbetween bacteriochlorophylls being comparable to other light-harvesting\ncomplexes, we anticipate that this finding is general and directly applies to\neven larger photoactive biomolecular complexes.\n", "  In this paper, the structural and electronic properties of polythiophene and\npolyprrrole-based systems have been investigated using first-principles\ncalculations both in periodic and oligomer forms. Of particular interest is the\nband gap modulation through substitutions and bilayer formation. Specifically,\nS has been substituted by Se and Te in polythiophene, leading to polyseleophene\nand polytellurophene, respectively, and N has been substituted by P and As in\npolypyrrole. The values obtained of the binding energy suggest that all the\nsystems studied can be realized experimentally. Stacking (bilayer formation) of\npure polythiophene, polypyrrole and their derivatives leads to linear\nsuppression of the band gap or HOMO-LUMO gap as a function of the stacking.\nMixed bilayers, including one formed from polythiophene on top of polypyrrole,\nhave also been considered. Overall, a wide range of band gaps can be achieved\nthrough substitutions and stacking. Hybrid (B3LYP) calculations also suggest\nthe same trend in the band gap as PBE calculations. Trends in the binding\nenergy are similar for both periodic and molecular calculations. In addition,\nthe $\\Gamma$-point phonon calculation are performed in order to check the\nstability of selected systems.\n", "  First-principles and semi-empirical tight binding calculations were performed\nto understand the adsorption of oxygen on the surface of two dimensional (2D)\nand zigzag stanene nano-ribbons. The intrinsic spin-orbit interaction is\nconsidered in the Kane-Mele tight binding model. The adsorption of an oxygen\natom or molecule on the 2D stanene opens an electronic energy band gap. We\ninvestigate the helical edge states and topological phase in the pure zigzag\nstanene nano-ribbons. The adsorption of oxygen atoms on the zigzag stanene\nnano-ribbons deforms the helical edge states at the Fermi level which causes\ntopological (non-trivial) to trivial phase transition. The structural stability\nof the systems is checked by performing $\\Gamma$-point phonon calculations. The\nadsorption of an oxygen atom or molecule on the 2D staneneSpecific arrangements\nof adsorbed oxygen atoms on the surface of zigzag stanene nano-ribbons conserve\nthe topological phase which has potential applications in future\nnano-electronic devices.\n", "  Solids subject to continuous changes of temperature or mechanical load often\nexhibit discontinuous avalanche-like responses. For instance, avalanche\ndynamics have been observed during plastic deformation, fracture, domain\nswitching in ferroic materials or martensitic transformations. The statistical\nanalysis of avalanches reveals a very complex scenario with a distinctive lack\nof characteristic scales. Much effort has been devoted in the last decades to\nunderstand the origin and ubiquity of scale-free behaviour in solids and many\nother systems. This chapter reviews some efforts to understand the\ncharacteristics of avalanches in martensites through mathematical modelling.\n", "  Most real-world networks are too large to be measured or studied directly and\nthere is substantial interest in estimating global network properties from\nsmaller sub-samples. One of the most important global properties is the number\nof vertices/nodes in the network. Estimating the number of vertices in a large\nnetwork is a major challenge in computer science, epidemiology, demography, and\nintelligence analysis. In this paper we consider a population random graph G =\n(V;E) from the stochastic block model (SBM) with K communities/blocks. A sample\nis obtained by randomly choosing a subset W and letting G(W) be the induced\nsubgraph in G of the vertices in W. In addition to G(W), we observe the total\ndegree of each sampled vertex and its block membership. Given this partial\ninformation, we propose an efficient PopULation Size Estimation algorithm,\ncalled PULSE, that correctly estimates the size of the whole population as well\nas the size of each community. To support our theoretical analysis, we perform\nan exhaustive set of experiments to study the effects of sample size, K, and\nSBM model parameters on the accuracy of the estimates. The experimental results\nalso demonstrate that PULSE significantly outperforms a widely-used method\ncalled the network scale-up estimator in a wide variety of scenarios. We\nconclude with extensions and directions for future work.\n", "  The purpose of this research is to study the connection of global properties\nof eight young stellar clusters projected in the Vista Variables in the Via\nLactea (VVV) ESO Large Public Survey disk area and their young stellar object\npopulation. The analysis in based on the combination of spectroscopic\nparallax-based reddening and distance determinations with main sequence and\npre-main sequence ishochrone fitting to determine the basic parameters\n(reddening, age, distance) of the sample clusters. The lower mass limit\nestimations show that all clusters are low or intermediate mass (between 110\nand 1800 Mo), the slope Gamma of the obtained present-day mass functions of the\nclusters is close to the Kroupa initial mass function. On the other hand, the\nyoung stellar objects in the surrounding cluster's fields are classified by low\nresolution spectra, spectral energy distribution fit with theoretical\npredictions, and variability, taking advantage of multi-epoch VVV observations.\nAll spectroscopically confirmed young stellar objects (except one) are found to\nbe massive (more than 8 Mo). Using VVV and GLIMPSE color-color cuts we have\nselected a large number of new young stellar object candidates, which are\nchecked for variability and 57% are found to show at least low-amplitude\nvariations. In few cases it was possible to distinguish between YSO and AGB\nclassification on the basis of the light curves.\n", "  There is a substantial interest in the heterostructures of semiconducting\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) amongst each other or with arbitrary\nmaterials, through which the control of the chemical, structural, electronic,\nspintronic, and optical properties can lead to a change in device paradigms. A\ncritical need is to understand the interface between TMDCs and insulating\nsubstrates, for example high-$\\kappa$ dielectrics, which can strongly impact\nthe electronic properties such as the optical gap. Here we show that the\nchemical and electronic properties of the single-layer (SL) TMDC, WS$_2$, can\nbe transferred onto high-$\\kappa$ transition metal oxide substrates TiO$_2$ and\nSrTiO$_3$. The resulting samples are much more suitable for measuring their\nelectronic and chemical structures with angle-resolved photoemission than their\nnative-grown SiO$_2$ substrates. We probe the WS$_2$ on the micron scale across\n100-micron flakes, and find that the occupied electronic structure is exactly\nas predicted for freestanding SL WS$_2$ with a strong spin-orbit splitting of\n420~meV and a direct band gap at the valence band maximum. Our results suggest\nthat TMDCs can be combined with arbitrary multi-functional oxides, which may\nintroduce alternative means of controlling the optoelectronic properties of\nsuch materials.\n", "  The Fe-based superconductors (FBS) present a large variety of compounds whose\nproperties are affected to different extents by their crystal structures.\nAmongst them, the $\\it{RE}$FeAs(O,F) ($\\it{RE}$1111, where $\\it{RE}$ is a rare\nearth element) is the family with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ but\nalso with a large anisotropy and Josephson vortices as demonstrated in the\nflux-flow regime in Sm1111 ($T_c$ $\\sim$ 55 K). Here we focus our attention on\nthe pinning properties of the lower-$T_c$ Nd1111 in the flux-creep regime. We\ndemonstrate that for H//c critical current density $J_c$ at high temperatures\nis dominated by point-defect pinning centres, whereas at low temperatures\nsurface pinning by planar defects parallel to the $\\it{c}$-axis and vortex\nshearing prevail. When the field approaches the $\\it{ab}$-planes, two different\nregimes are observed at low temperatures as a consequence of the transition\nbetween 3D-Abrikosov and 2D-Josephson vortices: one is determined by the\nformation of a vortex staircase structure and one by lock-in of the vortices\nparallel to the layers. This is the first study on FBS showing this behaviour\nin a full temperature, field, and angular range and it demonstrates that,\ndespite the lower $T_c$ and anisotropy of Nd1111 with respect to Sm1111, this\ncompound is substantially affected by intrinsic pinning generating a strong\n$\\it{ab}$-peak in $J_c$.\n", "  We present chemical abundances of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) in the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds from deep and high-quality optical spectra of HII\nregions. The data have been taken using the Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle\nSpectrograph at the 8.2-m Very Large Telescope with the goal of detecting the\nfaint CII and OII recombination lines. For all the objects of the sample, we\ndetermine C^2+ abundances from recombination lines and O^2+ abundances from\nrecombination lines and collisionally excited lines. In addition, we calculate\nthe abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O^2+ and C^2+, as well as the O/H,\nC/H and C/O ratios. We study the behaviour of the ADF comparing the values\nobtained in the Magellanic Clouds with those obtained for other HII regions in\ndifferent galaxies. We also compare the nebular and stellar abundances in two\nregions of the sample. Finally, we discuss the chemical evolution of the MCs\nthrough the O/H, C/H and C/O radial gradients and the changes of the C/O ratio\nas a function of O/H.\n", "  We have performed experiments using a 3D-Bose-Einstein condensate of sodium\natoms in a 1D optical lattice to explore some unusual properties of\nband-structure. In particular, we investigate the loading of a condensate into\na moving lattice and find non-intuitive behavior. We also revisit the behavior\nof atoms, prepared in a single quasimomentum state, in an accelerating lattice.\nWe generalize this study to a cloud whose atoms have a large quasimomentum\nspread, and show that the cloud behaves differently from atoms in a single\nBloch state. Finally, we compare our findings with recent experiments performed\nwith fermions in an optical lattice.\n", "  This paper is a collection of lecture notes on the superfield approach in\nthree- and four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theory. Many examples\nof the applications of this approach to different superfield models are\nconsidered.\n", "  In this paper we provide a method for constructing joint distributions for an\narbitrary set of observables on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces irrespective\nof whether the observables commute or not. These distributions have a number of\ndesirable properties: they agree with the standard quantum mechanical ones if\nthe observables commute, they also depend continuously on the observables, and\nunder unitary transformations they behave in a reasonable manner.\n"]}
