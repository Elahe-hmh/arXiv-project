long-wavelength electronic excitations,\nwhich is based on the Dirac--Weyl equation. The condition for the electronic\nwave function is specified, and we show that a topological defect can be\npresented as a pseudomagnetic vortex at the apex of a graphitic nanocone; the\nflux of the vortex is related to the deficit angle of the cone. The cases of\nall possible types of pentagonal defects, as well as several types of\nheptagonal defects (with the numbers of heptagons up to three, and six), are\nanalyzed. The density of states and the ground state charge are determined.\n", "  Electronic excitations in a graphitic monolayer (graphene) in the\nlong-wavelength approximation are characterized by the linear dispersion law,\nrepresenting a unique example of the really two-dimensional \"ultrarelativistic\"\nfermionic system which in the presence of topological defects possesses rather\nunusual properties. A disclination that rolls up a graphitic sheet into a\nnanocone is described by a pointlike pseudomagnetic vortex at the apex of the\ncone, and the flux of the vortex is related to the deficit angle of the conical\nsurface. A general theory of planar relativistic fermionic systems in the\nsingular vortex background is employed, and we derive the analytical expression\nfor the charge which is induced at finite temperature on some graphitic\nnanocones.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss elliptic genera of (2,2) and (0,2) supersymmetric\nLandau-Ginzburg models over nontrivial spaces, i.e., nonlinear sigma models on\nnontrivial noncompact manifolds with superpotential, generalizing old\ncomputations in Landau-Ginzburg models over (orbifolds of) vector spaces. For\nLandau-Ginzburg models in the same universality class as nonlinear sigma\nmodels, we explicitly check that the elliptic genera of the Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels match that of the nonlinear sigma models, via a Thom class computation\nof a form analogous to that appearing in recent studies of other properties of\nLandau-Ginzburg models on nontrivial spaces.\n", "  Since the Aharonov-Bohm effect is the purely quantum effect that has no\nanalogues in classical physics, its persistence in the quasiclassical limit\nseems to be hardly possible. Nevertheless, we show that the scattering\nAharonov-Bohm effect does persist in the quasiclassical limit owing to the\ndiffraction, i.e. the Fraunhofer diffraction in the case when space outside the\nenclosed magnetic flux is Euclidean, and the Fresnel diffraction in the case\nwhen the outer space is conical. Hence, the enclosed magnetic flux can serve as\na gate for the propagation of short-wavelength, almost classical, particles. In\nthe case of conical space, this quasiclassical effect which is in principle\ndetectable depends on the particle spin.\n", "  We consider the process of diffusion scattering of a wave function given on\nthe phase space. In this process the heat diffusion is considered only along\nmomenta. We write down the modified Kramers equation describing this situation.\nIn this model, the usual quantum description arises as asymptotics of this\nprocess for large values of resistance of the medium per unit of mass of\nparticle. It is shown that in this case the process passes several stages.\nDuring the first short stage, the wave function goes to one of \"stationary\"\nvalues. At the second long stage, the wave function varies in the subspace of\n\"stationary\" states according to the Schrodinger equation. Further, dissipation\nof the process leads to decoherence, and any superposition of states goes to\none of eigenstates of the Hamilton operator. At the last stage, the mixed state\nof heat equilibrium (the Gibbs state) arises due to the heat influence of the\nmedium and the random transitions among the eigenstates of the Hamilton\noperator.\n  Besides that, it is shown that, on the contrary, if the resistance of the\nmedium per unit of mass of particle is small, then in the considered model, the\ndensity of distribution of probability $\\rho =|\\phi |^2$ satisfies the standard\nLiouville equation, as in classical statistical mechanics.\n", "  In this paper we use trivial defects to define global taffy-like operations\non string worldsheets, which preserve the field theory. We fold open and closed\nstrings on a space X into open strings on products of multiple copies of X, and\nperform checks that the \"taffy-folded\" worldsheets have the same massless\nspectra and other properties as the original worldsheets. Such folding tricks\nare a standard method in the defects community; the novelty of this paper lies\nin deriving mathematical identities to check that e.g. massless spectra are\ninvariant in topological field theories. We discuss the case of the B model\nextensively, and also derive the same identities for string topology, where\nthey become statements of homotopy invariance. We outline analogous results in\nthe A model, B-twisted Landau-Ginzburg models, and physical strings. We also\ndiscuss the understanding of the closed string states as the Hochschild\nhomology of the open string algebra, and outline possible applications to\nelliptic genera.\n", "  In this paper we discuss quantization of the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter in\nsupergravity theories with altered nonperturbative sectors, which were recently\nused to argue a fractional quantization condition. Nonlinear sigma models with\naltered nonperturbative sectors are the same as nonlinear sigma models on\nspecial stacks known as gerbes. After reviewing the existing results on such\ntheories in two dimensions, we discuss examples of gerby moduli `spaces'\nappearing in four-dimensional field theory and string compactifications, and\nthe effect of various dualities. We discuss global topological defects arising\nwhen a field or string theory moduli space has a gerbe structure. We also\noutline how to generalize results of Bagger-Witten and more recent authors on\nquantization issues in supergravities from smooth manifolds to smooth moduli\nstacks, focusing particular attention on stacks that have gerbe structures.\n", "  A massive scalar field is quantized in the background of a cosmic string\nwhich is generalized to a static flux-carrying codimension-2 brane in the\nlocally flat multidimensional space-time. We find that the finite\nenergy-momentum tensor is induced in the vacuum. The dependence of the tensor\ncomponents on the brane flux and tension, as well as on the coupling to the\nspace-time curvature scalar, is comprehensively analyzed. The tensor components\nare holomorphic functions of space dimension, decreasing exponentially with the\ndistance from the brane. The case of the massless quantized scalar field is\nalso considered, and the relevance of Bernoulli's polynomials of even order for\nthis case is discussed.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical theory of the\nhalf-twisted $(0,2)$ gauged linear sigma model and its correlation functions\nthat agrees with and extends results from physics. The theory is associated to\na smooth projective toric variety $X$ and a deformation $\\sheaf E$ of its\ntangent bundle $T_X$. It gives a quantum deformation of the cohomology ring of\nthe exterior algebra of $\\sheaf E^*$. We prove that in the general case, the\ncorrelation functions are independent of `nonlinear' deformations. We derive\nquantum sheaf cohomology relations that correctly specialize to the ordinary\nquantum cohomology relations described by Batyrev in the special case $\\sheaf E\n= T_X$.\n", "  In this paper, we will outline computations of quantum sheaf cohomology for\ndeformations of tangent bundles of toric varieties, for those deformations\ndescribable as deformations of toric Euler sequences. Quantum sheaf cohomology\nis a heterotic analogue of quantum cohomology, a quantum deformation of the\nclassical product on sheaf cohomology groups, that computes nonperturbative\ncorrections to analogues of (27*)^3 couplings in heterotic string computations.\nPrevious computations have relied on either physics-based GLSM techniques or\ncomputation-intensive brute-force Cech cohomology techniques. This paper\ndescribes methods for greatly simplifying mathematical computations, and\nderives more general results than previously obtainable with GLSM techniques.\nWe will outline recent results (rigorous proofs will appear elsewhere).\n", "  In Maxwell's classical theory of electrodynamics the fields are frequently\nexpressed by potentials in order to facilitate the solution of the first order\nsystem of equations. This method obscures, however, that there exists an\ninconsistency between Faraday's law of induction and Maxwell's flux law. As a\nconsequence of this internal contradiction there is neither gauge invariance,\nnor exist unique solutions in general. It is also demonstrated that\ninhomogeneous wave equations cannot be solved by retarded integrals.\n", "  The Aharonov--Bohm effect is considered as a scattering event with\nnonrelativistic charged particles of the wavelength which is less than the\ntransverse size of an impenetrable magnetic vortex. The quasiclassical WKB\nmethod is shown to be efficient in solving this scattering problem. We find\nthat the scattering cross section consists of two terms, one describing the\nclassical phenomenon of elastic reflection and another one describing the\nquantum phenomenon of diffraction; the Aharonov--Bohm effect is manifested as a\nfringe shift in the diffraction pattern. Both the classical and the quantum\nphenomena are independent of the choice of a boundary condition at the vortex\nedge, providing that probability is conserved. We show that a propagation of\ncharged particles can be controlled by altering the flux of a magnetic vortex\nplaced on their way.\n", "  We consider the probability for a colour-singlet qqbar pair to emit a gluon,\nin strongly and smoothly ordered antenna showers. We expand to second order in\nalphaS and compare to the second-order QCD matrix elements for Z -> 3 jets,\nneglecting terms suppressed by 1/NC^2. We give a prescription that corrects the\nshower to the matrix-element result at this order for both soft and hard\nemissions, thereby explicitly reducing its dependence on evolution- and\nrenormalization-scale choices. We confirm that the choice of pT for both of\nthese scales absorbs all logarithms through order alphaS^2, and contrast this\nwith various alternatives. We include these corrections in the VINCIA shower\ngenerator and study the impact on LEP event-shape and fragmentation\nobservables. An uncertainty estimate is provided for each event, in the form of\na vector of alternative weights.\n", "  Equilibrium is a rather ideal situation, the exception rather than the rule\nin Nature. Whenever the external or internal parameters of a physical system\nare varied its subsequent relaxation to equilibrium may be either impossible or\ntake very long times. From the point of view of fundamental physics no generic\nprinciple such as the ones of thermodynamics allows us to fully understand\ntheir behaviour. The alternative is to treat each case separately. It is\nillusionary to attempt to give, at least at this stage, a complete description\nof all non-equilibrium situations. Still, one can try to identify and\ncharacterise some concrete but still general features of a class of out of\nequilibrium problems - yet to be identified - and search for a unified\ndescription of these. In this report I briefly describe the behaviour and\ntheory of a set of non-equilibrium systems and I try to highlight common\nfeatures and some general laws that have emerged in recent years.\n", "  Part 2 of \"Project X: Accelerator Reference Design, Physics Opportunities,\nBroader Impacts\". In this Part, we outline the particle-physics program that\ncan be achieved with Project X, a staged superconducting linac for\nintensity-frontier particle physics. Topics include neutrino physics, kaon\nphysics, muon physics, electric dipole moments, neutron-antineutron\noscillations, new light particles, hadron structure, hadron spectroscopy, and\nlattice-QCD calculations.

A natural quantum walk dynamics of interacting\nparticles can be used to implement efficiently the universal quantum\ncomputation. In this work quantum walks of electrons on a graph are studied.\nThe graph is composed of semiconductor quantum dots arranged in a circle.\nElectrons can tunnel between adjacent dots and interact via Coulomb repulsion,\nwhich leads to entanglement. Fermionic entanglement dynamics is obtained and\nevaluated.\n", "  Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function\nis rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum\nmechanics. On the basis of conceptual analysis, he arrived at an estimate for\nthe collapse time. To better understand his estimate, in this paper we present\na thought experiment, which singles out the role of time-dilations in massive\nsuperpositions. First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock\ncontaining a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock\ncontains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of\nspace time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a\nsmaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation.\nConsidering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces\nan ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that\nthis time ambiguity can be thought to affect the time evolution of a state in\ndifferent ways and that the relative phase difference between these different\ninterpretations can be calculated. We postulate that the wave function collapse\nwill occur when this phase difference becomes of order unity. An absolute\nenergy scale enters this equation and we recover Penrose's estimate for the\ncollapse time by equating the absolute energy scale to the rest mass of the\nobject.\n", "  We consider a new massive vector-boson Z' that couples to leptons through the\nL_mu - L_tau current, and to quarks through an arbitrary set of couplings. We\nshow that such a model can be obtained from a renormalizable field theory\ninvolving new heavy fermions in an anomaly-free representation. The model is a\ncandidate explanation for the discrepancy observed recently by the LHCb\ncollaboration in angular distributions of the final state particles in the rare\ndecay B \\to K* mu^+ mu^-. Interestingly, the new vector-boson contribution to\nthe decay tau \\to mu nu_tau \\bar nu_mu can also remove a small tension in the\nmeasurement of the corresponding branching ratio. Constraints from light flavor\nmeson-mixing restrict the coupling to the up- and down-quarks to be very small\nand thus direct production of the vector-boson at hadron colliders is strongly\nsuppressed. The most promising ways to test the model is through the\nmeasurement of the Z decay to four leptons and through its effect on neutrino\ntrident production of muon pairs. This latter process is a powerful but\nlittle-known constraint, which surprisingly rules out explanations of (g-2)_mu\nbased on Z' gauge bosons coupled to muon number, with mass of at least a few\nGeV.\n", "  We study the surface brightness profiles of disc galaxies in the 3.6 micron\nimages from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G) and\nK_s-band images from the Near Infrared S0-Sa galaxy Survey (NIRS0S). We\nparticularly connect properties of single exponential (type I), downbending\ndouble exponential (type II), and upbending double exponential (type III) disc\nprofile types, to structural components of galaxies by using detailed\nmorphological classifications, and size measurements of rings and lenses. We\nalso study how the local environment of the galaxies affects the profile types\nby calculating parameters describing the environmental density and the tidal\ninteraction strength. We find that in majority of type II profiles the break\nradius is connected with structural components such as rings, lenses, and\nspirals. The exponential disc sections of all three profile types, when\nconsidered separately, follow the disc scaling relations. However, the outer\ndiscs of type II, and the inner discs of type III, are similar in scalelength\nto the single exponential discs. Although the different profile types have\nsimilar mean environmental parameters, the scalelengths of the type III\nprofiles show a positive correlation with the tidal interaction strength.\n", "  Both the classical and the relativistic composition law for velocities are\napplied to re-calculate the Sagnac Effect. The ensuing formulae for the fringe\nshift are found to differ already in first order of v/c. Whilst the classical\nformula is validated by interferometric measurements and verified by the\nGPS-system, this is not the case for the relativistic result.\n", "  We have imaged the excitation of small-amplitude spin-wave eigenmodes,\nlocalized within $\\sim$ 100 nm of the vertices of nanoscale Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$\nellipses, using time-resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM) at\n2 GHz and resolution of 70 nm. Taking advantage of the buried-layer sensitivity\nof STXM, we find that the magnetization precession at the two vertices changes\nfrom predominantly in-phase to out-of-phase in samples with and without a\nconductive layer deposited over the ellipses. As a plausible interpretation for\nthe reversal in phase, we propose that unexpectedly strong Oersted fields are\ngenerated in the discontinuous overlayer, although effects of edge roughness\ncannot be fully excluded. The results demonstrate the capabilities of STXM to\nimage small-amplitude, GHz magnetization dynamics with the potential to map rf\nmagnetic fields on the nanoscale.\n", "  The case of fisheries management illustrates how the inherent structural\ninstability of ecosystems can have deep-running policy implications. We\ncontrast ten types of management plans to achieve maximum sustainable yields\n(MSY) from multiple stocks and compare their effectiveness based on a\nmanagement strategy evaluation (MSE) that uses complex food webs in its\noperating model. Plans that target specific stock sizes ($B_{\\text{MSY}}$)\nconsistently led to higher yields than plans targeting specific fishing\npressures ($F_{\\text{MSY}}$). A new self-optimising control rule, introduced\nhere for its robustness to structural instability, led to intermediate yields.\nMost plans outperformed single-species management plans with pressure targets\nset without considering multispecies interactions. However, more refined plans\nto \"maximise the yield from each stock separately\", in the sense of a Nash\nequilibrium, produced total yields comparable to plans aiming to maximise total\nharvested biomass, and were more robust to structural instability. Our analyses\nhighlight trade-offs between yields, amenability to negotiations, pressures on\nbiodiversity, and continuity with current approaches in the European context.\nBased on these results, we recommend directions for developments of EU\nfisheries policy.\n", "  This article gives a short description of pattern formation and coarsening\nphenomena and focuses on recent experimental and theoretical advances in these\nfields. It serves as an introduction to phase ordering kinetics and it will\nappear in the special issue `Coarsening dynamics', Comptes Rendus de Physique,\nedited by F. Corberi and P. Politi.\n", "  Efficiency at maximum power (MP) output for an engine with a passive piston\nwithout mechanical controls between two reservoirs is theoretically studied. We\nenclose a hard core gas partitioned by a massive piston in a\ntemperature-controlled container and analyze the efficiency at MP under a\nheating and cooling protocol without controlling the pressure acting on the\npiston from outside. We find the following three results: (i) The efficiency at\nMP for a dilute gas is close to the Chambadal-Novikov-Curzon-Ahlborn (CNCA)\nefficiency if we can ignore the side wall friction and the loss of energy\nbetween a gas particle and the piston, while (ii) the efficiency for a\nmoderately dense gas becomes smaller than the CNCA efficiency even when the\ntemperature difference of reservoirs is small. (iii) Introducing the Onsager\nmatrix for an engine with a passive piston, we verify that the tight coupling\ncondition for the matrix of the dilute gas is satisfied, while that of the\nmoderately dense gas is not satisfied because of the inevitable heat leak. We\nconfirm the validity of these results using the molecular dynamics simulation\nand introducing an effective mean-field-like model which we call stochastic\nmean field model.\n", "  We present a critical examination of the recent article by Waclawczyk et al.\n(2014) which proposes two new statistical symmetries in the classical theory\nfor turbulent hydrodynamic flows. We first show that both symmetries are\nunphysical in that they induce inconsistencies due to violating the principle\nof causality. In addition, they must get broken in order to be consistent with\nall physical constraints naturally arising in the statistical\nLundgren-Monin-Novikov (LMN) description of turbulence. As a result, we state\nthat besides the well-known classical symmetries of the LMN equations no new\nstatistical symmetries exist. Yet, aside from this particular issue, the\narticle by Waclawczyk et al. (2014) is flawed in more than one respect, ranging\nfrom an incomplete proof, to a self-contradicting statement up to an incorrect\nclaim. All these aspects will be listed, discussed and corrected, thus\nobtaining a completely opposite conclusion in our study than the article by\nWaclawczyk et al. (2014) is proposing.\n", "  We use the Bethe-Peierls method combined with the belief propagation\nalgorithm to study the arctic curves in the six vertex model on a square\nlattice with domain-wall boundary conditions, and the six vertex model on a\nrectangular lattice with partial domain-wall boundary conditions. We show that\nthis rather simple approximation yields results that are remarkably close to\nthe exact ones when these are known, and allows one to estimate the location of\nthe phase boundaries with relative little effort in cases in which exact\nresults are not available.\n", "  The ST2 interaction potential has been used in a large number of simulation\nstudies to explore the possibility of a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT)\nin supercooled water. Using umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations of ST2\nwater, we evaluate the free energy of formation of small ice nuclei in the\nsupercooled liquid in the vicinity of the Widom line, the region above the\ncritical temperature of the LLPT where a number of thermodynamic anomalies\noccur. Our results show that in this region there is a substantial free energy\ncost for the formation of small ice nuclei, demonstrating that the\nthermodynamic anomalies associated with the Widom line in ST2 water occur in a\nwell-defined metastable liquid phase. On passing through the Widom line, we\nidentify changes in the free energy to form small ice nuclei that illustrate\nhow the thermodynamic anomalies associated with the LLPT may influence the ice\nnucleation process.\n", "  We use an analytical model to describe the magnetocrystalline anisotropy\nenergy (MAE) in solids as a function of band filling. The MAE is evaluated in\nsecond-order perturbation theory, which makes it possible to decompose the MAE\ninto a sum of transitions between occupied and unoccupied pairs. The model\nenables us to characterize the MAE as a sum of contributions from different,\noften competing terms. The nitridometalates Li$_{2}$[(Li$_{1-x}$T$_{x}$)N],\nwith $T$=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, provide a system where the model is very effective\nbecause atomic like orbital characters are preserved and the decomposition is\nfairly clean. Model results are also compared against MAE evaluated directly\nfrom first-principles calculations for this system. Good qualitative agreement\nis found.\n", "  A D-dimensional gravitational model with Gauss-Bonnet term is considered.\nWhen ansatz with diagonal cosmological type metrics is adopted, we find\nsolutions with exponential dependence of scale factors (with respect to\n\"synchronous-like\" variable) which describe an exponential expansion of \"our\"\n3-dimensional factor-space and obey the observational constraints on the\ntemporal variation of effective gravitational constant G. Among them there are\ntwo exact solutions in dimensions D = 22, 28 with constant G and also an\ninfinite series of solutions in dimensions D \\ge 2690 with the variation of G\nobeying the observational data.\n", "  Thermodynamics relies on the possibility to describe systems composed of a\nlarge number of constituents in terms of few macroscopic variables. Its\nfoundations are rooted into the paradigm of statistical mechanics, where\nthermal properties originate from averaging procedures which smoothen out local\ndetails. While undoubtedly successful, elegant and formally correct, this\napproach carries over an operational problem: what is the precision at which\nsuch variables are inferred, when technical/practical limitations restrict our\ncapabilities to local probing? Here we introduce the local quantum thermal\nsusceptibility, a quantifier for the best achievable accuracy for temperature\nestimation via local measurements. Our method relies on basic concepts of\nquantum estimation theory, providing an operative strategy to address the local\nthermal response of arbitrary quantum systems at equilibrium. At low\ntemperatures it highlights the local distinguishability of the ground state\nfrom the excited sub-manifolds, thus providing a method to locate quantum phase\ntransitions.\n", "  Connections between microscopic follow-the-leader and macroscopic\nfluid-dynamics traffic flow models are already well understood in the case of\nvehicles moving on a single road. Analogous connections in the case of road\nnetworks are instead lacking. This is probably due to the fact that macroscopic\ntraffic models on networks are in general ill-posed, since the conservation of\nthe mass is not sufficient alone to characterize a unique solution at\njunctions. This ambiguity makes more difficult to find the right limit of the\nmicroscopic model, which, in turn, can be defined in different ways near the\njunctions. In this paper we show that a natural extension of the first-order\nfollow-the-leader model on networks corresponds, as the number of vehicles\ntends to infinity, to the LWR-based multi-path model introduced in [Bretti et\nal., Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst. Ser. S, 7 (2014)] and [Briani and Cristiani,\nNetw. Heterog. Media, 9 (2014)].\n", "  We calculated the electron mobility of 14 two dimensional semiconductors with\ncomposition of MX$_2$, where M (= Mo, W, Sn, Hf, Zr and Pt) is the transition\nmetal, and X is S, Se and Te. We treated the scattering matrix by deformation\npotential approximation. Long wave longitudinal acoustical and optical phonon\nscatterings are included. Piezoelectric scattering in the compounds without\ninversion symmetry is also taken into account. We found that out of the 14\ncompounds, WSe$_2$, PtS$_2$ and PtSe$_2$, are promising regarding to the\npossible high electron mobility and finite band gap. The phonon limited\nmobility in PtSe$_2$ reaches about 3000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ at room\ntemperature which is the highest among the compounds. The bandgap under the\nlocal density approximation is 1.25 eV. Our results can be a guide for\nexperiments to search for better two-dimensional materials for future\nsemiconductor devices.\n", "  Boundary element methods produce dense linear systems that can be accelerated\nvia multipole expansions. Solved with Krylov methods, this implies computing\nthe matrix-vector products within each iteration with some error, at an\naccuracy controlled by the order of the expansion, $p$. We take advantage of a\nunique property of Krylov iterations that allow lower accuracy of the\nmatrix-vector products as convergence proceeds, and propose a relaxation\nstrategy based on progressively decreasing $p$. In extensive numerical tests of\nthe relaxed Krylov iterations, we obtained speed-ups of between $2.1\\times$ and\n$3.3\\times$ for Laplace problems and between $1.7\\times$ and $4.0\\times$ for\nStokes problems. We include an application to Stokes flow around red blood\ncells, computing with up to 64 cells and problem size up to 131k boundary\nelements and nearly 400k unknowns. The study was done with an in-house\nmulti-threaded C++ code, on a hexa-core CPU. The code is available on its\nversion-control repository,\n\\href{https://github.com/barbagroup/fmm-bem-relaxed}{https://github.com/barbagroup/fmm-bem-relaxed}.\n", "  We use a recently discovered constrained de Finetti reduction (aka\n\"Post-Selection Lemma\") to study the parallel repetition of multi-player\nnon-local games under no-signalling strategies. Since the technique allows us\nto reduce general strategies to independent plays, we obtain parallel\nrepetition (corresponding to winning all rounds) in the same way as exponential\nconcentration of the probability to win a fraction larger than the value of the\ngame.\n  Our proof technique leads us naturally to a relaxation of no-signalling (NS)\nstrategies, which we dub sub-no-signalling (SNOS). While for two players the\ntwo concepts coincide, they differ for three or more players. Our results are\nmost complete and satisfying for arbitrary number of sub-no-signalling players,\nwhere we get universal parallel repetition and concentration for any game,\nwhile the no-signalling case is obtained as a corollary, but only for games\nwith \"full support\".\n", "  In the unified subquark model of all fundamental particles and forces, the\nmass of the Higgs boson in the standard model of electroweak interactions\n($m_H$) is predicted to be about $2\\sqrt{6}m_W/3$ (where $m_W$ is the mass of\nthe charged weak boson, $W$), which agrees well with the experimental values of\nabout 125 GeV recently found by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC. It\nseems to indicate that the Higgs boson is a composite of the iso-doublet spinor\nsubquark-antisubquark pairs well described by the unified subquark model with\neither one of subquark masses vanishing or being very small compared to the\nother. In the unified composite model, the masses of excited weak gauge bosons,\n$W^\\ast$ and $Z^\\ast$, and Higgs bosons, $H^\\ast$, as well as excited quarks\nand leptons are all predicted to be of the order of the composite mass scales,\nsay 1 TeV, and to satisfy the relation of $m_Wm_{W^\\ast} =\nm_Zm_{Z^\\ast}\\cos\\theta_w$ (where $\\theta_w$ is the weak mixing angle). It\nstrongly suggests that the excess of di-boson resonance events recently found\nby the ATLAS Collaboration at about 2 TeV may be explained by the productions\nand decays of the first excited states of either one of the weak and Higgs\nbosons, and the glueballs.\n", "  We study resonances of compactly supported potentials $ V_\\varepsilon = W (\nx, x/\\varepsilon ) $ where $ W : \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d / ( 2\\pi\n\\mathbb{Z}) ^d \\to \\mathbb{C} $, $ d $ odd. That means that $ V_\\varepsilon $\nis a sum of a slowly varying potential, $ W_0 ( x) $, and one oscillating at\nfrequency $1/\\varepsilon$. For $ W_0 \\equiv 0 $ we prove that there are no\nresonances above the line $\\text{Im} \\lambda = -A \\ln(\\varepsilon^{-1})$,\nexcept possibly a simple resonance of modulus $\\sim \\varepsilon^2$, when $\nd=1$. We show that this result is optimal by constructing a one-dimensional\nexample. In the case when $ W_0 \\neq 0 $ we prove that resonances in fixed\nstrips admit an expansion in powers of $\\varepsilon$. The argument provides a\nmethod for computing the coefficients of the expansion. In particular we\nproduce an effective potential converging uniformly to $W_0$ as $\\varepsilon\n\\rightarrow 0$ and whose resonances approach resonances of $V_\\varepsilon$\nmodulo $O(\\varepsilon^4)$.\n", "  We study the vacuum behavior at one loop level in extended Higgs sectors with\ntwo doublets (2HDM), where $U(1)$ and $Z_{2}$ symmetries are considered to\nprotect the $CP$ symmetry in the Higgs potential and to avoid Flavor Changing\nNeutral Currents at tree level in the Yukawa sector. In the Inert Higgs Model\ncase, a detailed comparison is made between both models by using the energy\nevolution of couplings, which should satisfy energy scale dependent relations\ndeduced for minima and stationary points of the Higgs potential at tree level.\nBesides, perturbative unitarity constraints at tree level are considered to\ngenerate the allowed parameter space compatible with perturbativity (absence of\nLandau poles). Our studies illustrate exclusion regions for Higgs masses and\nother combinations of couplings in the scalar sector, in particular for\nsplittings of mass square for neutral scalars $A^{0}$ and $H^{0}$, as well as\nthe difference between the sum of these and the charged Higgs mass square. From\nthe vacuum stability for inert-2HDM at the tree and one loop levels, analyses\nlead us to find out new hierarchical structures for scalar masses. To complete\nvacuum studies on the Inert model, and based on reparameterization invariance\nof the Higgs potential, we compute original discriminants that allow ensuring\nthe presence of a global electroweak minimum at tree level. Moreover, the\nbehavior in high energy scales drives out analyzing criticality phenomena for\nthe additional parameters of extended Higgs sectors. Finally, and using the\nconsistency with the electroweak precision analyses of oblique parameters, we\ndescribe several implications from different regimes of the inert model on\ncharged and pseudoscalar Higgs searches.\n", "  We present a measurement of the branching fraction and the longitudinal\npolarization fraction of $B^{0}\\rightarrow\\rho^+\\rho^-$ decays, as well as the\ntime-dependent $CP$ violating parameters in decays into longitudinally\npolarized $\\rho^{+}\\rho^{-}$ pairs with Belle's final data set of $772\\times\n10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs, at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance, collected at the\nasymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider KEKB. We obtain ${\\cal B}(B^0 \\rightarrow\n\\rho^+ \\rho^-)=(28.3\\pm 1.5\\;(\\rm stat) \\pm 1.5\\;(\\rm syst))\\times 10^{-6}$,\n$f_L = 0.988\\pm 0.012\\;(\\rm stat ) \\pm0.023\\;(\\rm syst)$, ${\\cal A}_{CP} =\n0.00\\pm0.10\\;(\\rm stat ) \\pm0.06\\;(\\rm syst)$, ${\\cal S}_{CP} =\n-0.13\\pm0.15\\;(\\rm stat ) \\pm0.05\\;(\\rm syst).$ We perform an isospin analysis\nto constrain the CKM angle $\\phi_2$ and obtain two solutions with\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\phi_{2} = (93.7\\pm10.6)^{\\circ},\\nonumber \\end{eqnarray}\nbeing most compatible with other Standard-Model based fits to the data.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of charged rotating black hole in large extra\ndimensions scenario where quantum gravity effects are taken into account. We\nconsider the effects of minimal length, minimal momentum, and maximal momentum\nas natural cutoffs on the thermodynamics of charged rotating TeV-scale black\nholes. In this framework the effect of the angular momentum and charge on the\nthermodynamics of the black hole are discussed. We focus also on frame dragging\nand Sagnac effect of the micro black holes.\n", "  Multi-mode expansions in computational quantum dynamics promise convergence\ntoward exact results upon increasing the number of modes. Convergence is\ndifficult to ascertain in practice due to the unfavourable scaling of required\nresources for many-particle problems and therefore a simplified criterion based\non a threshold value for the least occupied mode function is often used. Here\nwe show how the separable quantum motion of the center of mass can be used to\nsensitively detect unconverged numerical multi-particle dynamics in harmonic\npotentials. Based on an experimentally relevant example of attractively\ninteracting bosons in one dimension, we demonstrate that the simplified\nconvergence criterion fails to assure qualitatively correct results.\nFurthermore, the numerical evidence for the creation of two-hump fragmented\nbright soliton-like states presented by Streltsov \\emph{et al.} [PRL 100,\n130401 (2008)] is shown to be inconsistent with exact results. Implications for\nour understanding of dynamical fragmentation in attractive boson systems are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  In few-layer (FL) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), the conduction\nbands along the Gamma-K directions shift downward energetically in the presence\nof interlayer interactions, forming six Q valleys related by three-fold\nrotational symmetry and time reversal symmetry. In even-layers the extra\ninversion symmetry requires all states to be Kramers degenerate, whereas in\nodd-layers the intrinsic inversion asymmetry dictates the Q valleys to be\nspin-valley coupled. In this Letter, we report the transport characterization\nof prominent Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH) oscillations for the Q valley electrons in\nFL transition metal disulfide (TMDs), as well as the first quantum Hall effect\n(QHE) in TMDCs. Our devices exhibit ultrahigh field-effect mobilities (~16,000\ncm2V-1s-1 for FL WS2 and ~10,500 cm2V-1s-1 for FL MoS2) at cryogenic\ntemperatures. Universally in the SdH oscillations, we observe a valley Zeeman\neffect in all odd-layer TMD devices and a spin Zeeman effect in all even-layer\nTMD devices.\n", "  III-V tunneling field-effect transistors (TFETs) offer great potentials in\nfuture low-power electronics application due to their steep subthreshold slope\nand large \"on\" current. Their 3D quantum transport study using non-equilibrium\nGreen's function method is computationally very intensive, in particular when\ncombined with multiband approaches such as the eight-band K.P method. To reduce\nthe numerical cost, an efficient reduced-order method is developed in this\narticle and applied to study homojunction InAs and heterojunction GaSb-InAs\nnanowire TFETs. Device performances are obtained for various channel widths,\nchannel lengths, crystal orientations, doping densities, source pocket lengths,\nand strain conditions.\n", "  In this letter, we report the presence of novel type of plasmon Weyl points\nin a naturally existing material - magnetized plasma. In such a medium,\nconventional, purely longitudinal bulk plasma oscillations exists only along\nthe direction of applied magnetic field (z direction). With strong enough\nmagnetic field, there exist helical propagating modes along z direction with\ncircular polarizations. The orthogonality between the longitudinal bulk plasmon\nmode and the transverse helical propagating modes guarantees their crossing at\nthe bulk plasmon frequency. These crossing points, embedded in the bulk plasmon\ndispersion line, serve as monopoles in the k space - the so called Weyl points.\nThese Weyl points lead to salient observable features. These include the highly\nintriguing observation that, at a magnetized plasma surface which is parallel\nto the applied magnetic field, reflection of an electromagnetic wave with\nin-plane wave-vector close to the Weyl points exhibits chiral behavior only in\nhalf of the k plane, which is bounded by the projection of the bulk plasmon\ndispersion line. We also verify the presence of 'Fermi arcs' connecting the two\nWeyl points with opposite chiralities when magnetized plasma interfaces with\ntrivial photonic materials. Our study introduces the concept of Weyl photonics\ninto homogeneous strongly dispersive photonic materials, which could pave way\nfor realizing new topological photonic devices.\n", "  This study numerically and analytically investigates the dynamics of a rotor\nunder viscous or dry friction as a non-equilibrium probe of a granular gas. In\norder to demonstrate the role of the rotor as a probe for a non-equilibrium\nbath, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the rotor is performed under\nviscous or dry friction surrounded by a steady granular gas under gravity. A\none- to-one map between the velocity distribution function (VDF) of the\ngranular gas and the angular distribution function for the rotor is\ntheoretically derived. The MD simulation demonstrates that the one-to-one map\naccurately infers the local VDF of the granular gas from the angular VDF of the\nrotor, and vice versa.\n", "  We present Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) adaptive optics near-infrared images of\nthe giant planet-forming regions of the protoplanetary disk orbiting the nearby\n(D = 54 pc), pre-main sequence (classical T Tauri) star TW Hydrae. The GPI\nimages, which were obtained in coronagraphic/polarimetric mode, exploit\nstarlight scattered off small dust grains to elucidate the surface density\nstructure of the TW Hya disk from 80 AU to within 10 AU of the star at 1.5 AU\nresolution. The GPI polarized intensity images unambiguously confirm the\npresence of a gap in the radial surface brightness distribution of the inner\ndisk. The gap is centered near 23 AU, with a width of 5 AU and a depth of 50%.\nIn the context of recent simulations of giant planet formation in gaseous,\ndusty disks orbiting pre-main sequence stars, these results indicate that at\nleast one young planet with a mass 0.2 M_J could be present in the TW Hya disk\nat an orbital semi-major axis similar to that of Uranus. If this (proto)planet\nis actively accreting gas from the disk, it may be readily detectable by GPI or\na similarly sensitive, high-resolution infrared imaging system.\n", "  We develop a method for universally resolving the important issue of\nseparating the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) from spin rectification effect\n(SRE) signal. This method is based on the consideration that the two effects\ndepend on the spin injection direction: The ISHE is an odd function of the spin\ninjection direction while the SRE is independent on it. Thus, inversion of the\nspin injection direction changes the ISHE voltage signal, while SRE voltage\nremains. It applies generally to analyzing the different voltage contributions\nwithout fitting them to special line shapes. This fast and simple method can be\nused in a wide frequency range, and has the flexibility of sample preparation.\n", "  Using novel nonlinear kinetic terms for gravitons, a large class of\nbi-gravity models were constructed, which are potentially free of the\nBoulware-Deser (BD) ghost. In this work, we derive their Hamiltonians using the\nADM formalism, and verify that the BD ghost is eliminated by additional\nconstraints. The general Hamiltonian structure is analogous to that of the\nother class of bi-gravity models free of the BD ghost.\n", "  Given a matched pair of Lie groups, we show that the tangent bundle of the\nmatched pair group is isomorphic to the matched pair of the tangent groups. We\nthus obtain the Euler-Lagrange equations on the trivialized matched pair of\ntangent groups, as well as the Euler-Poincar\\'e equations on the matched pair\nof Lie algebras. We show explicitly how these equations cover those of the\nsemi-direct product theory. In particular, we study the trivialized, and the\nreduced Lagrangian dynamics on the group $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$.\n", "  The goal of this contribution is to explain the analogy between combinatorial\nDyson-Schwinger equations and inductive data types to a readership of\nmathematical physicists. The connection relies on an interpretation of\ncombinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations as fixpoint equations for polynomial\nfunctors (established elsewhere by the author, and summarised here), combined\nwith the now-classical fact that polynomial functors provide semantics for\ninductive types. The paper is expository, and comprises also a brief\nintroduction to type theory.\n", "  We study time-dependent deformations of a certain class of backgrounds in\ntype IIB supergravity. These backgrounds are solutions of a five-dimensional\nconsistent truncation, relevant for gauge/gravity duality, which have the form\nof dS_4 foliations over a fifth (radial) direction. We investigate\ntime-dependent deformations of those solutions in the search for gravitational\nduals of models of glueball inflation. A particular starting ansatz enables us\nto find a class of analytical solutions, corresponding to an ultra-slow roll\ninflationary regime. This regime may play a role in understanding the low l\nanomaly in the power spectrum of the CMB.\n", "  We report on the performance of a compact photon pair source that was\nrecovered intact from a failed space launch. The source had been embedded in a\nnanosatellite and was designed to perform pathfinder experiments leading to\nglobal quantum communication networks using spacecraft. Despite the launch\nvehicle explosion soon after takeoff?, the nanosatellite was successfully\nretrieved from the accident site and the source within it was found to be fully\noperational. We describe the assembly technique for the rugged source.\nPost-recovery data is compared to baseline measurements collected before the\nlaunch attempt and no degradation in brightness or polarization correlation was\nobserved. The survival of the source through an extreme environment provides\nstrong evidence that it is possible to engineer rugged quantum optical systems.\n", "  How the thermodynamic entropy $S_{TD}$ is related to the Boltzmann entropy\n$S_{B}$ has been one of the central issues since the beginning of statistical\nmechanics. Today, it is believed that the thermodynamic entropy $S_{TD}$ is\nequal to a function $\\tilde{S}_{B}$ that is defined by regularizing the\nBoltzman entropy in order to ensure extensivity. However, it is not known\nwhether $\\tilde{S}_{B}$ completely determines the possibility of a macroscopic\nadiabatic transformation in the same way as $S_{TD}$ does. In this paper, by\nformulating the possibility of a macroscopic adiabatic transformations in terms\nof \"coarse-graining\" of quantum operations, we prove that $\\tilde{S}_{B}$\nprovides a necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of a\nmacroscopic adiabatic transformation.\n", "  We consider graphene in the presence of external magnetic field and elastic\ndeformations that cause emergent magnetic field. The total magnetic field\nresults in the appearance of Landau levels in the spectrum of quasiparticles.\nIn addition, the quasiparticles in graphene experience the emergent gravity. We\nconsider the particular choice of elastic deformation, which gives constant\nemergent magnetic field and vanishing torsion. Emergent gravity may be\nconsidered as perturbation. We demonstrate that the corresponding first order\napproximation affects the energies of the Landau levels only through the\nconstant renormalization of Fermi velocity. The degeneracy of each Landau level\nreceives correction, which depends essentially on the geometry of the sample.\nThere is the limiting case of the considered elastic deformation, that\ncorresponds to the uniformly stretched graphene. In this case in the presence\nof the external magnetic field the degeneracies of the Landau levels remain\nunchanged.\n", "  This work reports studies performed in the superconducting compound\nFeSe0:5Te0:5 under high pressure. Changes were observed in the transition\ntemperature, superconducting critical fields,anomalous variations in the\nMeissner fraction, and in Ginzburg Landau parameters. The superconducting\nproperties were calculated and compared using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenber\napproximation and Ginzburg-Landau theory. Hydrostatic pressure was produced\nfrom atmospheric to 823 MPa, the increment in the critical temperature was from\n14.45 to 20.5 K at a rate of change about 0.0069 K/MPa.\n", "  We use the algebraic Bethe ansatz to obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nof the spin-1 Temperley-Lieb open quantum chain with \"free\" boundary\nconditions. We exploit the associated reflection algebra in order to prove the\noff-shell equation satisfied by the Bethe vectors.\n", "  We consider the Temperley-Lieb (TL) open quantum spin chain with \"free\"\nboundary conditions associated with the spin-$s$ representation of\nquantum-deformed $sl(2)$. We construct the transfer matrix, and determine its\neigenvalues and the corresponding Bethe equations using analytical Bethe\nansatz. We show that the transfer matrix has quantum group symmetry, and we\npropose explicit formulas for the number of solutions of the Bethe equations\nand the degeneracies of the transfer-matrix eigenvalues. We propose an\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz construction of the off-shell Bethe states, and we\nconjecture that the on-shell Bethe states are highest-weight states of the\nquantum group. We also propose a determinant formula for the scalar product\nbetween an off-shell Bethe state and its on-shell dual, as well as for the\nsquare of the norm. We find that all of these results, except for the\ndegeneracies and a constant factor in the scalar product, are universal in the\nsense that they do not depend on the value of the spin. In an appendix, we\nbriefly consider the closed TL spin chain with periodic boundary conditions,\nand show how a previously-proposed solution can be improved so as to obtain the\ncomplete (albeit non-universal) spectrum.\n", "  The quest to understand the nature dark matter is one of the most relevant\nones in Particle Physics nowadays, since it constitutes most of the matter of\nthe Universe and it is still unknown what it is made of. In order to answer to\nthis question, a multi-front attack is needed because our knowledge of its\nproperties is very incomplete. Among the different experimental strategies,\nneutrino telescopes are very relevant tools. There are several promising\nsources to look at: the Sun, the Galactic Center, the Earth, dwarf galaxies,\ngalaxy clusters... As an example of the power of neutrino telescopes, we can\nmention the analysis of the Sun, which offers the best sensitivity for spin\ndependent WIMP-nucleon scattering and is free of alternative astrophysical\ninterpretations. In this talk I will review the status and prospects of the\nmain present and future neutrino telescopes: ANTARES, IceCube and KM3NeT.\n", "  Cavity combiners have been put forward for high power combining due to their\nadvantages of larger combining ability, variable input channels and less power\nloss. For a high power cavity combiner, it is better to keep the power loss\nratio in a reasonable range, because large power loss would lead to strict\nrequirements on the cooling system. A combiner with variable input channels is\nconvenient for outputting different power levels according to practical\ndemands. In this paper, a method for designing a variable-channel high-power\ncavity combiner is proposed, based on the relation between input and output\ncoupling coefficients obtained by analyzing the equivalent circuit of the\ncavity combiner. This method can put the designed cavity combiner in a matching\nstate and keep its power loss rate in a reasonable range as the number of input\nchannels changes. As an example, a cavity combiner with 500 MHz and variable\ninput channels from 16 to 64 is designed, and the simulation results show that\nour proposed method is feasible.\n", "  The MINERvA collaboration reports a novel study of neutrino-nucleus\ncharged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) using the same neutrino beam\nincident on targets of polystyrene, graphite, iron, and lead. Results are\npresented as ratios of C, Fe, and Pb to CH. The ratios of total DIS cross\nsections as a function of neutrino energy and flux-integrated differential\ncross sections as a function of the Bjorken scaling variable x are presented in\nthe neutrino-energy range of 5 - 50 GeV. Good agreement is found between the\ndata and predicted ratios, based on charged-lepton nucleus scattering, at\nmedium x and low neutrino energies. However, the data rate appears depleted in\nthe vicinity of the nuclear shadowing region, x < 0.1. This apparent deficit,\nreflected in the DIS cross-section ratio at high neutrino energy , is\nconsistent with previous MINERvA observations and with the predicted onset of\nnuclear shadowing with the the axial-vector current in neutrino scattering.\n", "  Context. The launch of the exoplanet space missions obtaining exquisite\nphotometry from space has resulted in the discovery of thousands of planetary\nsystems with very different physical properties and architectures. Among them,\nthe exoplanet CoRoT-29b was identified in the light curves the mission obtained\nin summer 2011, and presented an asymmetric transit light curve, which was\ntentatively explained via the effects of gravity darkening. Aims. Transits of\nCoRoT-29b are measured with precision photometry, to characterize the reported\nasymmetry in their transit shape. Methods. Using the OSIRIS spectrograph at the\n10-m GTC telescope, we perform spectro-photometric differential observations,\nwhich allow us to both calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a\nstudy of the color-dependence of the transit. Results. After careful data\nanalysis, we find that the previously reported asymmetry is not present in\neither of two transits, observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high\nphotometric precisions of 300ppm over 5 minutes. Due to the relative faintness\nof the star, we do not reach the precision necessary to perform transmission\nspectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs of color-dependency of the\ntransit depth or duration. Conclusions. We conclude that the previously\nreported asymmetry may have been a time-dependent phenomenon, which did not\noccur in more recent epochs. Alternatively, instrumental effects in the\ndiscovery data may need to be reconsidered.\n", "  A scheme for the deterministic joint remote preparation of a four- qubit\ncluster-type state using only two Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states as\nquantum channels is presented. In this scheme, the first sender per- forms a\ntwo-qubit projective measurement according to the real coefficient of the\ndesired state. Then, the other sender utilizes the measurement result and the\ncomplex coefficient to perform another projective measurement. To obtain the\ndesired state, the receiver applies appropriate unitary operations to his/her\nown two qubits and two CNOT operations to the two ancillary ones. Most\ninterestingly, our scheme can achieve unit success probability, i.e., Psuc=1.\nFurthermore, comparison reveals that the efficiency is higher than that of most\nother analogous schemes.\n", "  We investigate the Kondo effect in the two-dimensional electron system with a\nnon-trivial quadratic energy band crossing point. We show that the Kondo effect\ncan induce a new hybrid topological insulator phase which is a coexistence\nstate of the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the TRSbroken quantum spin Hall\neffect. This hybrid topological insulator exhibits not only a quantized charge\nHall current but also a net spin current, which are localized at the edge\nboundaries. This peculiar topological state arises due to the interplay of two\nmarginally relevant operators, i.e., the Kondo-coupling between the electrons\nand the local magnetic moment and the electron-electron interaction in the\ntwo-dimensional system.\n", "  We propose an ultrafast way to generate spin chirality and spin current in a\nclass of multiferroic magnets using a terahertz circularly polarized laser.\nUsing the Floquet formalism for periodically driven systems, we show that it is\npossible to dynamically control the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in\nmaterials with magnetoelectric coupling. This is supported by numerical\ncalculations, by which additional resonant phenomena are found. Specifically,\nwhen a static magnetic field is applied in addition to the circularly polarized\nlaser, a large resonant enhancement of spin chirality is observed resembling\nthe electron spin resonance. Spin current is generated when the laser is\nspatially modulated by chiral plasmonic structures and could be detected using\noptospintronic devices.\n", "  A measurement of the decorrelation of azimuthal angles between the two jets\nwith the largest transverse momenta is presented for seven regions of leading\njet transverse momentum up to 2.2 TeV. The analysis is based on the\nproton-proton collision data collected with the CMS experiment at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n19.7 inverse femtobarns. The dijet azimuthal decorrelation is caused by the\nradiation of additional jets and probes the dynamics of multijet production.\nThe results are compared to fixed-order predictions of perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD), and to simulations using Monte Carlo event generators\nthat include parton showers, hadronization, and multiparton interactions. Event\ngenerators with only two outgoing high transverse momentum partons fail to\ndescribe the measurement, even when supplemented with next-to-leading-order QCD\ncorrections and parton showers. Much better agreement is achieved when at least\nthree outgoing partons are complemented through either next-to-leading-order\npredictions or parton showers. This observation emphasizes the need to improve\npredictions for multijet production.\n", "  Under steady flow conditions, the topological complexity inherent to all\nrandom 3D porous media imparts complicated flow and transport dynamics. It has\nbeen established that this complexity generates persistent chaotic advection\nvia a three-dimensional (3D) fluid mechanical analogue of the baker's map which\nrapidly accelerates scalar mixing in the presence of molecular diffusion. Hence\npore-scale fluid mixing is governed by the interplay between chaotic advection,\nmolecular diffusion and the broad (power-law) distribution of fluid particle\ntravel times which arise from the non-slip condition at pore walls. To\nunderstand and quantify mixing in 3D porous media, we consider these processes\nin a model 3D open porous network and develop a novel stretching continuous\ntime random walk (CTRW) which provides analytic estimates of pore-scale mixing\nwhich compare well with direct numerical simulations. We find that chaotic\nadvection inherent to 3D porous media imparts scalar mixing which scales\nexponentially with longitudinal advection, whereas the topological constraints\nassociated with 2D porous media limits mixing to scale algebraically. These\nresults decipher the role of wide transit time distributions and complex\ntopologies on porous media mixing dynamics, and provide the building blocks for\nmacroscopic models of dilution and mixing which resolve these mechanisms.\n", "  Fluid deformation and strain history are central to wide range of fluid\nmechanical phenomena ranging from fluid mixing and particle transport to stress\ndevelopment in complex fluids and the formation of Lagrangian coherent\nstructures (LCSs). To understand and model these processes it is necessary to\nquantify Lagrangian deformation in terms of Eulerian flow properties, currently\nan open problem. To elucidate this link we develop a Protean (streamline)\ncoordinate transform for steady three-dimensional (3D) flows which renders both\nthe velocity gradient and deformation gradient upper triangular. This frame not\nonly simplifies computation of fluid deformation metrics such as finite-time\nLyapunov exponents (FTLEs) and elucidates the deformation structure of the\nflow, but moreover explicitly recovers kinematic and topological constraints\nupon deformation such as those related to helicity density and the\nPoincar\\'{e}-Bendixson theorem. We apply this transform to several classes of\nsteady 3D flow, including helical and non-helical, compressible and\nincompressible flows, and find random flows exhibit remarkably simple\n(Gaussian) deformation structure, and so are fully characterised in terms of a\nsmall number of parameters. As such this technique provides the basis for the\ndevelopment of stochastic models of fluid deformation in random flows which\nadhere to the kinematic constraints inherent to various flow classes.\n", "  Coherent wave splitting is crucial in interferometers. Normally, the waves\nafter this splitting are of the same type. But recent progress in interaction\nbetween atom and light has led to the coherent conversion of photon to atomic\nexcitation. This makes it possible to split an incoming light wave into a\ncoherent superposition state of atom and light and paves the way for an\ninterferometer made of different types of waves. Here we report on a Rabi-like\ncoherent-superposition oscillation observed between atom and light and a\ncoherent mixing of light wave with excited atomic spin wave in a Raman process.\nWe construct a new kind of hybrid interferometer based on the atom-light\ncoherent superposition state. Interference fringes are observed in both optical\noutput intensity and atomic output in terms of the atomic spin wave strength\nwhen we scan either or both of the optical and atomic phases. Such a hybrid\ninterferometer can be used to interrogate atomic states by optical detection\nand will find its applications in precision measurement and quantum control of\natoms and light.\n", "  The exchange of orbital angular momentum (OAM) between paraxial optical\nvortex and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of atomic gases is well known. In\nthis paper, we develop a theory for the microscopic interaction between matter\nand an optical vortex beyond paraxial approximation. We show how superposition\nof vortex states of BEC can be created with a focused optical vortex. Since,\nthe polarization or spin angular momentum (SAM) of the optical field is coupled\nwith OAM of the field, in this case, these angular momenta can be transferred\nto the internal electronic and external center-of-mass (c.m.) motion of atoms\nprovided both the motions are coupled. We propose a scheme for producing the\nsuperposition of matter-wave vortices using Gaussian and a focused\nLaguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam. We study how two-photon Rabi frequencies of\nstimulated Raman transitions vary with focusing angles for different\ncombinations of OAM and SAM of optical states. We demonstrate the formation of\nvortex-antivortex structure and discuss interference of three vortex states in\na BEC.\n", "  We define and study stochastic areas processes associated with Brownian\nmotions on the complex symmetric spaces $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ and $\\mathbb{CH}^n$.\nThe characteristic functions of those processes are computed and limit theorems\nare obtained. In the case $n=1$, we also study windings of the Brownian motion\non those spaces and compute the limit distributions. For $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ the\ngeometry of the Hopf fibration plays a central role, whereas for\n$\\mathbb{CH}^n$ it is the anti-de Sitter fibration.\n", "  We investigate a framework aiming to provide a common origin for the\nlarge-angle anomalies detected in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which\nare hypothesized as the result of the statistical inhomogeneity developed by\ndifferent isocurvature fields of mass $m\\sim H$ present during inflation. The\ninhomogeneity arises as the combined effect of $(i)$ the initial conditions for\nisocurvature fields (obtained after a fast-roll stage finishing many\n$e$-foldings before cosmological scales exit the horizon), $(ii)$ their\ninflationary fluctuations and $(iii)$ their coupling to other degrees of\nfreedom. Our case of interest is when these fields (interpreted as the\nprecursors of large-angle anomalies) leave an observable imprint only in\nisolated patches of the Universe. When the latter intersect the last scattering\nsurface, such imprints arise in the CMB. Nevertheless, due to their\nstatistically inhomogeneous nature, these imprints are difficult to detect, for\nthey become hidden in the background similarly to the Cold Spot. We then\ncompute the probability that a single isocurvature field becomes inhomogeneous\nat the end of inflation and find that, if the appropriate conditions are given\n(which depend exclusively on the preexisting fast-roll stage), this probability\nis at the percent level. Finally, we discuss several mechanisms (including the\ncurvaton and the inhomogeneous reheating) to investigate whether an initial\nstatistically inhomogeneous isocurvature field fluctuation might give rise to\nsome of the observed anomalies. In particular, we focus on the Cold Spot, the\npower deficit at low multipoles and the breaking of statistical isotropy.\n", "  In the Heisenberg picture, we study the semiclassical time evolution of a\nbounded quantum observable $Q^w(x,\\hbar D_x)$ associated to a $(m\\times m)$\nmatrix-valued symbol $Q$ generated by a semiclassical matrix-valued Hamiltonian\n$H\\sim H_0+\\hbar H_1$. Under a non-crossing assumption on the eigenvalues of\nthe principal symbol $H_0$ that ensures the existence of almost invariant\nsubspaces of $L^{2}(\\mathbb R^n)\\otimes \\mathbb C^m$, and for a class of\nobservables that are semiclassically block-diagonal with respect to the\nprojections onto these almost invariants subspaces, we establish a long time\nmatrix-valued version for the semiclassical Egorov theorem valid in a large\ntime interval of Ehrenfest type $T(\\hbar)\\simeq log(\\hbar^{-1})$.\n", "  We analyze the emergence of correlated optical phenomena in the transmission\nof light through a waveguide that confines classical or ultracold quantum\ndegenerate atomic ensembles. The conditions of the correlated collective\nresponse are identified in terms of atom density, thermal broadening, and\nphoton losses by using stochastic Monte-Carlo simulations and transfer matrix\nmethods of transport theory. We also calculate the \"cooperative Lamb shift\" for\nthe waveguide transmission resonance, and discuss line shifts that are specific\nto effectively one-dimensional waveguide systems.\n", "  We report the development of a CaMoO4 crystal low temperature detector for\nthe AMoRE neutrinoless double beta decay (0{\\nu}\\b{eta}\\b{eta}) search\nexperiment. The prototype detector cell was composed of a 216 g CaMoO4 crystal\nand a metallic magnetic calorimeter. An over-ground measurement demonstrated\nFWHM resolution of 6-11 keV for full absorption gamma peaks. Pulse shape\ndiscrimination was clearly demonstrated in the phonon signals, and 7.6 {\\sigma}\nof discrimination power was found for the {\\alpha} and \\b{eta}/{\\gamma}\nseparation. The phonon signals showed rise-times of about 1 ms. It is expected\nthat the relatively fast rise-time will increase the rejection efficiency of\ntwo-neutrino double beta decay pile-up events which can be one of the major\nbackground sources in 0{\\nu}\\b{eta}\\b{eta} searches.\n", "  Corrugated structures have recently been widely used for manipulating\nelectron beam longitudinal phase space and for producing THz radiation. Here we\nreport on time-resolved measurements of the quadrupole wakefields in planar\ncorrugated structures. It is shown that while the time- dependent quadrupole\nwakefield produced by a planar corrugated structure causes significant growth\nin beam transverse emittance, it can be effectively canceled with a second\ncorrugated structure with orthogonal orientation. The strengths of the\ntime-dependent quadrupole wakefields for various corrugated structure gaps are\nalso measured and found to be in good agreement with theories. Our work should\nforward the applications of corrugated structures in many accelerator based\nscientific facilities.\n", "  Despite being a complex many-body system, the atomic nucleus exhibits simple\nstructures for certain \"magic\" numbers of protons and neutrons. The calcium\nchain in particular is both unique and puzzling: evidence of doubly-magic\nfeatures are known in 40,48Ca, and recently suggested in two radioactive\nisotopes, 52,54Ca. Although many properties of experimentally known Ca isotopes\nhave been successfully described by nuclear theory, it is still a challenge to\npredict their charge radii evolution. Here we present the first measurements of\nthe charge radii of 49,51,52Ca, obtained from laser spectroscopy experiments at\nISOLDE, CERN. The experimental results are complemented by state-of-the-art\ntheoretical calculations. The large and unexpected increase of the size of the\nneutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond N = 28 challenges the doubly-magic nature\nof 52Ca and opens new intriguing questions on the evolution of nuclear sizes\naway from stability, which are of importance for our understanding of\nneutron-rich atomic nuclei.\n", "  We report on the characterization of space-time couplings in high energy\nsub-2-cycle 770nm laser pulses using a self-referencing single-shot method.\nUsing spatially-encoded arrangement filter-based spectral phase interferometry\nfor direct electric field reconstruction (SEA-F-SPIDER) we characterize\nfew-cycle pulses with a wave-front rotation of 2.8x?10^11 rev/sec (1.38 mrad\nper half-cycle) and pulses with pulse front tilts ranging from to -0.33 fs/um\nto -3.03 fs/um.\n", "  In our previous study, we have predicted the novel two-dimensional honeycomb\nmonolayers of pnictogen. In particular, the structure and properties of the\nhoneycomb monolayer of nitrogen, which we call nitrogene, are very unusual. In\nthis paper, we make an in-depth investigation of its electronic structure. We\nfind that the band structure of nitrogene can be engineered in several ways:\ncontrolling the stacking of monolayers, application of biaxial tensile strain,\nand application of perpendicular electric field. The band gap of nitrogene is\nfound to decrease with the increasing number of layers. The perpendicular\nelectric field can also reduce the band gap when it is larger than 0.18V/\n{\\AA}, and the gap closes at 0.35V/ {\\AA}. A nearly linear dependence of the\ngap on the electric field is found during the process. Application of biaxial\nstrain can decrease the band gap as well, and eventually closes the gap. After\nthe gap-closing, we find six inequivalent Dirac points in the Brillouin zone\nunder the strain between 17% and 28%, and the nitrogene monolayer becomes a\nDirac semimetal. These findings suggest that the electronic structure of\nnitrogene can be modified by several techniques, which makes it a promising\ncandidate for electronic devices.\n", "  We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dissipative gases of atoms\nexcited to two or more high-lying Rydberg states. This situation bears\ninteresting similarities to classical binary (in general $p$-ary) mixtures of\nparticles. The effective forces between the components are determined by the\ninter-level and intra-level interactions of Rydberg atoms. These systems permit\nto explore new parameter regimes which are physically inaccessible in a\nclassical setting, for example one in which the mixtures exhibit non-additive\ninteractions. In this situation the out-of-equilibrium evolution is\ncharacterized by the formation of metastable domains that reach partial\nequilibration long before the attainment of stationarity. In experimental\nsettings with mesoscopic sizes, this collective behavior may in fact take the\nappearance of dynamic symmetry breaking.\n", "  Numerical calculations of excitonic properties of novel nanostructures, such\nas nanowire and crystal phase quantum dots, must combine atomistic accuracy\nwith an approachable computational complexity. The key difficulty comes from\nthe fact that excitonic spectra details arise from atomicscale contributions\nthat must be integrated over a large spatial domain containing a million and\nmore of atoms. In this work we present a step-by-step solution to this problem:\ncombined empirical tight-binding and configuration interaction scheme that\nunites linearly scaling computational time with the essentials of the atomistic\nmodeling. We benchmark our method on the example of wellstudied self-assembled\nInAs/GaAs quantum dot. Next, we apply our atomistic approach to crystal phase\nquantum dots containing more than 10 million atoms.\n", "  We demonstrate that in the system with anisotropic distribution of the\ndefect-induced random local field directions in the n-dimensional space of\nvector order parameter with the O(n) symmetry, the defect-induced effective\nanisotropy arises for the space dimensionality 2<d<4. If the anisotropy\nconstant exceeds the threshold value, then an inhomogeneous state predicted by\nImry and Ma becomes energetically unfavorable, and the system goes back to the\nstate with the long-range order.\n", "  We propose a microscopic mechanism of the long-range order in two-dimensional\nspace induced by random local fields of crystal defects. The anisotropic\ndistribution of defect-induced random local field directions in the\nn-dimensional space of vector order parameter with the O(n) symmetry is shown\nto give rise to the defect-induced effective anisotropy in the system. The\nexpression for the effective anisotropy constant is found. A weak anisotropy of\nthe \"easy axis\" type transforms the X-Y model and the Heisenberg model to the\nclass of Ising models, and brings into existence the long-range order in the\nsystem.\n", "  We present an optimal analysis for a quantum mechanical engine working\nbetween two energy baths within the framework of relativistic quantum\nmechanics, adopting a first-order correction. This quantum mechanical engine,\nwith the direct energy leakage between the energy baths, consists of two\nadiabatic and two isoenergetic processes and uses a three-level system of two\nnon-interacting fermions as its working substance. Assuming that the potential\nwall moves at a finite speed, we derive the expression of power output and, in\nparticular, reproduce the expression for the efficiency at maximum power.\n", "  We reformurate a central extension of Felder's elliptic quantum group in the\nFRST formulation as a topological algebra E_{q,p}(gl_N) over the ring of formal\npower series in p. We then discuss the isomorphism between E_{q,p}(gl_N) and\nthe elliptic algebra U_{q,p}(gl_N) of the Drinfeld realization. An evaluation\nH-algebra homomorphism from U_{q,p}(gl_N) to a dynamical extension of the\nquantum affine algebra U_q(gl_N) resolves the problem into the one discussed by\nDing and Frenkel in the trigonometric case. We also provide some useful\nformulas for the elliptic quantum determinants.\n", "  A nonlinear dynamical system model that approximates a microscopic Gibbs\nfield model for the yielding of a viscoplastic material subjected to varying\nexternal stress recently reported in [1] is presented. The predictions of the\nmodel are in a fair agreement with the microscopic simulations and in a very\ngood agreement with the microstructural semi-empirical model reported in [2].\nWith only two internal parameters, the nonlinear dynamical system model\ncaptures several key features of the solid-fluid transition observed in\nexperiments: the effect of the interactions between microscopic constituents on\nthe yield point, the abruptness of solid-fluid transition and the emergence of\na hysteresis of the micro-structural states upon increasing/decreasing external\nforcing.The scaling behaviour of the magnitude of the hysteresis with the\ndegree of the steadiness of the flow is consistent with previous experimental\nobservations.\n", "  The peculiar field-dependent magnetism of Na0.82CoO2 has been investigated\nthrough an analysis of its DC and AC spin susceptibilities. To account for the\neasily activated narrow b2g-a1g gap of the crystal field for Co in the cobalt\noxide layer, the spin-state transition of Co3+ (3d6) between the low spin (LS)\nstate b2g^2-a1g^0 of S=0 and the intermediate spin (IS) state b2g^1-a1g^1 of\nS=1 is thus seen as thermally activated and exhibits a Boltzmann distribution.\nThe IS state of Co3+ within each sqrt(13a) hexagonal superlattice formed by the\nS=1/2 state of the Co4+ ions appears randomly within each supercell and shows\nsignificant temperature and field dependence. The magnetic field is found to\nassist in pinning down the thermally activated state of Co3+ and swings the\nBoltzmann distribution weight toward a higher fraction of the IS state. The\nfield dependence of the in-plane magnetic moment from the added number of S=1\nspins is used to explain the origin of A-type antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering,\nparticularly that the ferromagnetic (FM)-like behavior below TN at low field is\nactually a ferrimagnetic IS spin ordering of Co3+.\n", "  Dimensional regularization is a common method used to regulate the UV\ndivergence of field theoretic quantities. When it is used in the context of\nRenyi entropy, however, it is important to consider whether such a procedure\neliminates the statistical interpretation thereof as a measure of entanglement\nof states living on a Hilbert space. We therefore examine the dimensionally\nregularized Renyi entropy of a 4d unitary CFT and show that it admits no\nunderlying Hilbert space in the state-counting sense. This gives a concrete\nproof that dimensionally regularized Renyi entropy cannot always be obtained as\na limit of the Renyi entropy of some finite-dimensional quantum system.\n", "  We study the influence of boundaries on chiral effects in hot dense\nrelativistic spinor matter in a strong magnetic field which is transverse to\nbounding planes. The most general set of boundary conditions ensuring the\nconfinement of matter within the bounding planes is considered. We find that,\nin thermal equilibrium, the nondissipative axial current along the magnetic\nfield is induced, depending on chemical potential and temperature, as well as\non a choice of boundary conditions. As temperature increases from zero to large\nvalues, a stepwise behaviour of the axial current density as a function of\nchemical potential is changed to a smooth one; the choice of a boundary\ncondition can facilitate either amplification or diminution of the chiral\nseparation effect. This points at a significant role of boundaries for physical\nsystems with hot dense magnetized relativistic spinor matter, e.g., compact\nstars, heavy-ion collisions, novel materials known as Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals.\n", "  The muon detectors of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have\nto cope with unprecedentedly high neutron and gamma ray background rates. In\nthe forward regions of the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector, for\ninstance, counting rates of 1.7 kHz/square cm are reached at the LHC design\nluminosity. For high-luminosity upgrades of the LHC, up to 10 times higher\nbackground rates are expected which require replacement of the muon chambers in\nthe critical detector regions. Tests at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility\nshowed that drift-tube detectors with 15 mm diameter aluminum tubes operated\nwith Ar:CO2 (93:7) gas at 3 bar and a maximum drift time of about 200 ns\nprovide efficient and high-resolution muon tracking up to the highest expected\nrates. For 15 mm tube diameter, space charge effects deteriorating the spatial\nresolution at high rates are strongly suppressed. The sense wires have to be\npositioned in the chamber with an accuracy of better than 50 ?micons in order\nto achieve the desired spatial resolution of a chamber of 50 ?microns up to the\nhighest rates. We report about the design, construction and test of prototype\ndetectors which fulfill these requirements.\n", "  The performance of pressurized drift-tube detectors at very high background\nrates has been studied at the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) at CERN and in\nan intense 20 MeV proton beam at the Munich Van-der-Graaf tandem accelerator\nfor applications in large-area precision muon tracking at high-luminosity\nupgrades of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The ATLAS muon drifttube (MDT)\nchambers with 30 mm tube diameter have been designed to cope with and neutron\nbackground hit rates of up to 500 Hz/square cm. Background rates of up to 14\nkHz/square cm are expected at LHC upgrades. The test results with standard MDT\nreadout electronics show that the reduction of the drift-tube diameter to 15\nmm, while leaving the operating parameters unchanged, vastly increases the rate\ncapability well beyond the requirements. The development of new small-diameter\nmuon drift-tube (sMDT) chambers for LHC upgrades is completed. Further\nimprovements of tracking efficiency and spatial resolution at high counting\nrates will be achieved with upgraded readout electronics employing improved\nsignal shaping for high counting rates.\n", "  Pressurized drift-tube chambers are efficient detectors for high-precision\ntracking over large areas. The Monitored Drift-Tube (MDT) chambers of the muon\nspectrometer of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) reach a\nspatial resolution of 35 micons and almost 100% tracking efficiency with 6\nlayers of 30 mm diameter drift tubes operated with Ar:CO2 (93:7) gas mixture at\n3 bar and a gas gain of 20000. The ATLAS MDT chambers are designed to cope with\nbackground counting rates due to neutrons and gamma-rays of up to about 300 kHz\nper tube which will be exceeded for LHC luminosities larger than the design\nvalue of 10-34 per square cm and second. Decreasing the drift-tube diameter to\n15 mm while keeping the other parameters, including the gas gain, unchanged\nreduces the maximum drift time from about 700 ns to 200 ns and the drift-tube\noccupancy by a factor of 7. New drift-tube chambers for the endcap regions of\nthe ATLAS muon spectrometer have been designed. A prototype chamber consisting\nof 12 times 8 layers of 15 mm diameter drift tubes of 1 m length has been\nconstructed with a sense wire positioning accuracy of 20 microns. The 15 mm\ndiameter drift-tubes have been tested with cosmic rays in the Gamma Irradiation\nFacility at CERN at counting rates of up to 1.85 MHz.\n", "  For the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector at the large hadron collider\n(LHC), large drift chambers consisting of 6 to 8 layers of pressurized drift\ntubes are used for precision tracking covering an active area of 5000 m2 in the\ntoroidal field of superconducting air core magnets. The chambers have to\nprovide a spatial resolution of 41 microns with Ar:CO2 (93:7) gas mixture at an\nabsolute pressure of 3 bar and gas gain of 2?104. The environment in which the\nchambers will be operated is characterized by high neutron and background with\ncounting rates of up to 100 per square cm and second. The resolution and\nefficiency of a chamber from the serial production for ATLAS has been\ninvestigated in a 100 GeV muon beam at photon irradiation rates as expected\nduring LHC operation. A silicon strip detector telescope was used as external\nreference in the beam. The spatial resolution of a chamber is degraded by 4 ?m\nat the highest background rate. The detection efficiency of the drift tubes is\nunchanged under irradiation. A tracking efficiency of 98% at the highest rates\nhas been demonstrated.\n", "  The Advanced Telescope for High-Energy Astrophysics (Athena) has been\nselected by ESA as its second large-class mission. The future European X-ray\nobservatory will study the hot and energetic Universe with its launch foreseen\nin 2028. Microcalorimeters based on superconducting Transition-edge sensor\n(TES) are the chosen technology for the detectors array of the X-ray Integral\nField Unit (X-IFU) on board of Athena. The X-IFU is a 2-D imaging\nintegral-field spectrometer operating in the soft X-ray band (0.3 -12 keV). The\ndetector consists of an array of 3840 TESs coupled to X-ray absorbers and read\nout in the MHz bandwidth using Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) based on\nSuperconducting QUantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). The proposed design\ncalls for devices with a high filling-factor, high quantum efficiency,\nrelatively high count-rate capability and an energy resolution of 2.5 eV at 5.9\nkeV. The paper will review the basic principle and the physics of the TES-based\nmicrocalorimeters and present the state-of-the art of the FDM read-out.\n", "  We study a system with competing short- and global-range interactions in the\nframework of the Bose-Hubbard model. Using a mean-field approximation we obtain\nthe phase diagram of the system and observe four different phases: a\nsuperfluid, a supersolid, a Mott insulator and a charge density wave, where the\ntransitions between the various phases can be either of first or second order.\nWe qualitatively support these results using Monte-Carlo simulations. An\nanalysis of the low-energy excitations shows that the second-order phase\ntransition from the charge density wave to the supersolid is associated with\nthe softening of particle- and hole-like excitations which give rise to a\ngapless mode and an amplitude Higgs mode in the supersolid phase. This\namplitude Higgs mode is further transformed into a roton mode which softens at\nthe supersolid to superfluid phase transition.\n", "  For the system with the n-component order parameter (O(n)-model), conditions\nfor initiation of the Imry-Ma disordered state resulting from the influence of\ndefects of the \"random local anisotropy\" type were discovered. The initiation\nof such a state was shown to be possible if the distribution of local\nanisotropy axes directions in the order parameter space is nearly isotropic,\nand the limiting degree of the distribution anisotropy was found. For a higher\nanisotropy in the distribution of local axes directions, the long-range order\nin the system holds true even in the presence of defects of the given type.\n", "  We have created a quantum three-level ladder system with the cavity\ndispersive energy level in a superconducting circuit quantum electrodynamics\nsystem consisting of a transmon qubit and a cavity, and have directly observed\nthe Autler-Townes splitting effect instead of representing it by the\nprobability of the qubit being at each level. A coupler tone is applied on the\ntransition between the second excited state of transmon and cavity dispersive\nlevel, while the cavity spectrum is probed. A doublet transmission and\nanormalous dispersion spectrum of the cavity level is clearly shown. The\ninverse Fourier transform of cavity spectrum indicates that there is a quantum\ncoherence Rabi oscillation of the populations between cavity and qubit.\n", "  Although time is one of the fundamental notions in physics, it does not have\na unique description. In quantum theory time is a parameter ordering the\nsuccession of the probability amplitudes of a quantum system, while according\nto relativity theory each system experiences in general a different proper\ntime, depending on the system's world line, due to time to time dilation. It is\ntherefore of fundamental interest to test the notion of time in the regime\nwhere both quantum and relativistic effects play a role, for example, when\ndifferent amplitudes of a single quantum clock experience different magnitudes\nof time dilation. Here we propose a realization of such an experiment with a\nsingle electron in a Penning trap. The clock can be implemented in the\nelectronic spin precession and its time dilation then depends on the radial\n(cyclotron) state of the electron. We show that coherent manipulation and\ndetection of the electron can be achieved already with present day technology.\nA single electron in a Penning trap is a technologically ready platform where\nthe notion of time can be probed in a hitherto untested regime, where it\nrequires a relativistic as well as quantum description.\n", "  The last two decades have witnessed tremendous advancements in the area of\nnanophotonics and plasmonics. Undoubtedly, the introduction of metallic\nstructures has opened a path towards light confinement and manipulation at the\nsubwavelength scale { a regime that was previously thought to be out of reach\nin optics. Of central importance is to devise efficient light sources to power\nup the future nanoscale optical circuits. Coaxial resonators can provide a\nplatform to implement such subwavelength sources. They support ultrasmall\ncavity modes and offer large mode-emitter overlap as well as multifold\nscalability. Given their large modulation bandwidth, they hold promise for high\nspeed optical interconnects { where they can be used for light generation and\nmodulation simultaneously. In addition, the possibility of thresholdless\noperation in such devices may have implications in developing the next\ngeneration of efficient lighting systems. In this review article, the physics\nand applications of coaxial nanolasers will be discussed.\n", "  We investigate the structure of $\\tau$-functions for the elliptic difference\nPainlev\\'e equation of type $E_8$. Introducing the notion of ORG\n$\\tau$-functions for the $E_8$ lattice, we construct some particular solutions\nwhich are expressed in terms of elliptic hypergeometric integrals. Also, we\ndiscuss how this construction is related to the framework of lattice\n$\\tau$-functions associated with the configuration of generic nine points in\nthe projective plane.\n", "  The standard model for eruptive flares has in the past few years been\nextended to 3D. It predicts typical J-shaped photospheric footprints of the\ncoronal current layer, forming at similar locations as the Quasi-Separatrix\nLayers (QSLs). Such a morphology is also found for flare ribbons observed in\nthe EUV band, as well as in non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) magnetic field\nextrapolations and models. We study the evolution of the photospheric traces of\nthe current density and flare ribbons, both obtained with the SDO instruments.\nWe investigate the photospheric current evolution during the 6 September 2011\nX-class flare (SOL2011-09-06T22:20) from observational data of the magnetic\nfield obtained with HMI. This evolution is compared with that of the flare\nribbons observed in the EUV filters of the AIA. We also compare the observed\nelectric current density and the flare ribbon morphology with that of the QSLs\ncomputed from the flux rope insertion method/NLFFF model.\n  The NLFFF model shows the presence of a fan-spine configuration of overlying\nfield lines, due to the presence of a parasitic polarity, embedding an\nelongated flux rope that appears in the observations as two parts of a\nfilament. The QSLs, evolved via a magnetofrictional method, also show similar\nmorphology and evolution as both the current ribbons and the EUV flare ribbons\nobtained at several times during the flare. For the first time, we propose a\ncombined analysis of the photospheric traces of an eruptive flare, in a complex\ntopology, with direct measurements of electric currents and QSLs from\nobservational data and a magnetic field model. The results, obtained by two\ndifferent and independent approaches, 1) confirm previous results of current\nincrease during the impulsive phase of the flare, 2) show how NLFFF models can\ncapture the essential physical signatures of flares even in a complex magnetic\nfield topology.\n", "  We propose and study a model for the interplay between two different\ndynamical processes --one for opinion formation and the other for decision\nmaking-- on two interconnected networks $A$ and $B$. The opinion dynamics on\nnetwork $A$ corresponds to that of the M-model, where the state of each agent\ncan take one of four possible values ($S=-2,-1,1,2$), describing its level of\nagreement on a given issue. The likelihood to become an extremist ($S=\\pm 2$)\nor a moderate ($S=\\pm 1$) is controlled by a reinforcement parameter $r \\ge 0$.\nThe decision making dynamics on network $B$ is akin to that of the\nAbrams-Strogatz model, where agents can be either in favor ($S=+1$) or against\n($S=-1$) the issue. The probability that an agent changes its state is\nproportional to the fraction of neighbors that hold the opposite state raised\nto a power $\\beta$. Starting from a polarized case scenario in which all agents\nof network $A$ hold positive orientations while all agents of network $B$ have\na negative orientation, we explore the conditions under which one of the\ndynamics prevails over the other, imposing its initial orientation. We find\nthat, for a given value of $\\beta$, the two-network system reaches a consensus\nin the positive state (initial state of network $A$) when the reinforcement\novercomes a crossover value $r^*(\\beta)$, while a negative consensus happens\nfor $r<r^*(\\beta)$. In the $r-\\beta$ phase space, the system displays a\ntransition at a critical threshold $\\beta_c$, from a coexistence of both\norientations for $\\beta<\\beta_c$ to a dominance of one orientation for\n$\\beta>\\beta_c$. We develop an analytical mean-field approach that gives an\ninsight into these regimes and shows that both dynamics are equivalent along\nthe crossover line $(r^*,\\beta^*)$.\n", "  Highly selective triggers are essential for the physics programme of the\nATLAS experiment at HL-LHC where the instantaneous luminosity will be about an\norder of magnitude larger than the LHC instantaneous luminosity in Run 1. The\nfirst level muon trigger rate is dominated by low momentum muons below the\nnominal trigger threshold due to the moderate momentum resolution of the\nResistive Plate and Thin Gap trigger chambers. The resulting high trigger rates\nat HL-LHC can be sufficiently reduced by using the data of the precision Muon\nDrift Tube chambers for the trigger decision. This requires the implementation\nof a fast MDT read-out chain and of a fast MDT track reconstruction algorithm\nwith a latency of at most 6 microseconds. A hardware demonstrator of the fast\nread-out chain has been successfully tested at the HL-LHC operating conditions\nat the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility. The fast track reconstruction algorithm\nhas been implemented on a fast trigger processor.\n", "  While scattering of light by atoms and molecules yields large amount of\npolarization at the B-band of both T- and L-dwarfs, scattering by dust grains\nin cloudy atmosphere of L-dwarfs gives rise to significant polarization at the\nfar-optical and infra-red wavelengths where these objects are much brighter.\nHowever, the observable disk averaged polarization should be zero if the clouds\nare uniformly distributed and the object is spherically symmetric. Therefore,\nin order to explain the observed large polarization of several L-dwarfs,\nrotation-induced oblateness or horizontally inhomogeneous cloud distribution in\nthe atmosphere is invoked. On the other hand, when an extra-solar planet of\nEarth-size or larger transits the brown dwarf along the line of sight, the\nasymmetry induced during the transit gives rise to a net non-zero, time\ndependent polarization. Employing atmospheric models for a range of effective\ntemperature and surface gravity appropriate for T- and L-dwarfs, I derive the\ntime dependent polarization profiles of these objects during transit phase and\nestimate the peak amplitude of polarization that occurs during the inner\ncontact points of the transit ingress/egress phase. It is found that peak\npolarization in the range of 0.2-1.0 % at I- and J-band may arise of cloudy L\ndwarfs occulted by Earth-size or larger exoplanets. Such an amount of\npolarization is higher than that can be produced by rotation-induced oblateness\nof even the rapidly rotating L-dwarfs. Hence, I suggest that time resolved\nimaging polarization should be a potential technique to detect transiting\nexoplanets around L-dwarfs.\n", "  Lepton number violation plays an essential role in many scenarios of neutrino\nmass generation and also provides new clues to search new physics beyond the\nstandard model. We consider the neutrinophilic two-Higgs-doublet model\n($\\nu$-2HDM) where additional right-handed neutral fermions $N_{Ri}$ and a\ncomplex singlet scalar $\\sigma$ are also involved. In scalar sector, the global\n$U(1)_{L}$ symmetry is spontaneous broken, leading to Nambu-Goldstone boson,\nthe Majoron $J$, accompanied by the Majorana neutrino mass generation. We find\nthat the massless Majoron will induce large invisible Higgs decay, and current\nexperiments have already set constraints on relevant parameters. For the first\ntime, we point out that the $\\nu$-2HDM with $N_{Ri}$ can be distinguished from\nother seesaw by the same sign tri-lepton signature $3\\ell^\\pm4j+\\cancel{E}_T$.\nMore interesting, for $\\mathcal{O}(\\keV)$ scale Majoron, it is a good candidate\nof decaying dark matter to interpret the $3.5\\keV$ and $511\\keV$ line excesses.\n", "  In this work, a third-order Chapman-Enskog analysis of the\nmultiple-relaxation-time (MRT) pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for\nmultiphase flow is performed for the first time. The leading terms on the\ninteraction force, consisting of an anisotropic and an isotropic term, are\nsuccessfully identified in the third-order macroscopic equation recovered by\nthe lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), and then new mathematical insights into\nthe pseudopotential LB model are provided. For the third-order anisotropic\nterm, numerical tests show that it can cause the stationary droplet to become\nout-of-round, which suggests the isotropic property of the LBE needs to be\nseriously considered in the pseudopotential LB model. By adopting the classical\nequilibrium moment or setting the so-called \"magic\" parameter to 1/12, the\nanisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order\nanalysis and also validated numerically. As for the third-order isotropic term,\nwhen and only when it is considered, accurate continuum form pressure tensor\ncan be definitely obtained, by which the predicted coexistence densities always\nagree well with the numerical results. Compared with this continuum form\npressure tensor, the classical discrete form pressure tensor is accurate only\nwhen the isotropic term is a specific one. At last, in the framework of the\npresent third-order analysis, a consistent scheme for third-order additional\nterm is proposed, which can be used to independently adjust the coexistence\ndensities and surface tension. Numerical tests are subsequently carried out to\nvalidate the present scheme.\n", "  The relaxation time of collective electronic states in a 2D distribution of\nquantum dots is investigated theoretically by simulating EELS experiments. From\nthe numerical calculation of the probability of energy loss of an electron\nbeam, traveling parallel to the distribution, it is possible to estimate the\ndamping time of ferroelectric-like states. We generate this collective response\nof the distribution by introducing a mean field interaction among the quantum\ndots, and then, the model is extended incorporating effects of long-range\ncorrelations through a Bragg-Williams approximation. The behavior of the\ndielectric function, the energy loss function, and the relaxation time of\nferroelectric-like states is then investigated as a function of the temperature\nof the distribution and the damping constant of the electronic states in the\nsingle quantum dots. The robustness of the trends and tendencies of our results\nindicate that this scheme of analysis can guide experimentalists to develop\ntailored quantum dots distributions for specific applications.\n", "  Recently, some authors have removed the big bang singularity in teleparallel\nLoop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) and have shown that the universe may undergo a\nnumber of oscillations. We investigate the origin of this type of teleparallel\ntheory in a system of intersecting branes in M-theory in which the angle\nbetween them changes with time. This system is constructed by two intersecting\nanti-D8-branes, one compacted D4-brane and the other a D3-brane. These branes\nare built by joining M0-branes which develop in decaying fundamental strings.\nThe compacted D4-brane is located between two intersecting anti-D8 branes and\nglues to one of them. Our universe is located on the D3 brane which wraps the\nD4 brane from one end and sticks to one of the anti-D8 branes from another one.\nIn this system, there are three types of fields, corresponding to compacted D4\nbranes, intersecting branes and D3-branes. These fields interact with each\nother and make the angle between branes oscillate. By decreasing this angle and\napproaching the intersecting anti-D8 branes towards each other, the D4 brane\nrolls, the D3 brane wraps around the D4 brane, and t he universe contracts. By\nseparating the intersecting branes and increasing the angle, the D4 brane rolls\nin the opposite direction, the D3 brane separates from it and the expansion\nbranch begins. Also, the interaction between branes in this system gives us the\nexact form of the relevant Lagrangian for teleparallel LQC.\n", "  We calculate the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) response of the\nKitaev honeycomb model, an exactly solvable quantum-spin-liquid model with\nfractionalized Majorana and flux excitations. We find that the fundamental RIXS\nchannels, the spin-conserving (SC) and the non-spin-conserving (NSC) ones, do\nnot interfere and give completely different responses. SC-RIXS picks up\nexclusively the Majorana sector with a pronounced momentum dispersion, whereas\nNSC-RIXS also creates immobile fluxes, thereby rendering the response only\nweakly momentum dependent, as in the spin structure factor measured by\ninelastic neutron scattering. RIXS can therefore pick up the fractionalized\nexcitations of the Kitaev spin liquid separately, making it a sensitive probe\nto detect spin-liquid character in potential material incarnations of the\nKitaev honeycomb model.\n", "  The electron-phonon coupling in self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots is\nrelatively weak at low light intensities, which means that the zero-phonon line\nin emission is strong compared to the phonon sideband. However, the coupling to\nacoustic phonons can be dynamically enhanced in the presence of an intense\noptical pulse tuned within the phonon sideband. Recent experiments have shown\nthat this dynamic vibronic coupling can enable population inversion to be\nachieved when pumping with a blue-shifted laser and for rapid de-excitation of\nan inverted state with red detuning. In this paper we confirm the incoherent\nnature of the phonon-assisted pumping process and explore the temperature\ndependence of the mechanism. We also show that a combination of blue- and\nred-shifted pulses can create and destroy an exciton within a timescale ~20 ps\ndetermined by the pulse duration and ultimately limited by the phonon\nthermalisation time.\n", "  We theoretically propose that giant magnetochiral anisotropy is achieved in\nWeyl semimetals in noncentrosymmetric crystals as a consequence of the chiral\nanomaly. The magnetochiral anisotropy is the nonlinearity of the resistivity\n$\\rho$ that depends on the current $\\boldsymbol{I}$ and the magnetic field\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$ as $\\rho=\\rho_0 (1 + \\gamma \\boldsymbol{I} \\cdot\n\\boldsymbol{B})$, and can be applied to rectifier devices controlled by\n$\\boldsymbol{B}$. We derive the formula for the coefficient $\\gamma$ in\nnoncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals. The obtained formula for $\\gamma$ shows\nthat the magnetochiral anisotropy is strongly enhanced when the chemical\npotential is tuned to Weyl points, and that noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals\nsuch as TaAs can exhibit much larger magnetochiral anisotropy than that\nobserved in other materials so far.\n", "  High finesse Fabry-Perot(FP) cavity is a very important frequency reference\nfor laser stabiliza- tion, and is widely used for applications such as\nprecision measurement, laser cooling of ions or molecules. But the non-linear\nresponse of the piezoelectric ceramic transducer (PZT) in the FP cav- ity\nlimits the performance of the laser stabilization. Measuring and controlling\nsuch non-linearity are important. Here we report an in-situ, optical method to\ncharacterize this non-linearity by measuring the resonance signals of a\ndual-frequency laser. The differential measurement makes it insensitive to\nlaser and cavity drifting, and has a very high sensitivity. It can be applied\nfor various applications with PZT, especially in an optical lab.\n", "  Ultra-clean graphene sheets encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride\ncrystals host two-dimensional electron systems in which low-temperature\ntransport is solely limited by the sample size. We revisit the theoretical\nproblem of carrying out microscopic calculations of non-local ballistic\ntransport in such micron-scale devices. By employing the Landauer-Buttiker\nscattering theory, we propose a novel scaling approach to tight-binding\nnon-local transport in realistic graphene devices. We test our numerical method\nagainst experimental data on transverse magnetic focusing (TMF), a textbook\nexample of non-local ballistic transport in the presence of a transverse\nmagnetic field. This comparison enables a clear physical interpretation of all\nthe observed features of the TMF signal, including its oscillating sign.\n", "  Although pathway-specific kinetic theories are fundamentally important to\ndescribe and under- stand reversible polymerisation kinetics, they come in\nprinciple at a cost of having a large number of system-specific parameters.\nHere, we construct a dynamical Landau theory to describe the kinetics of\nactivated linear supramolecular self-assembly, which drastically reduces the\nnumber of parameters and still describes most of the interesting and generic\nbehavior of the system in hand. This phenomenological approach hinges on the\nfact that if nucleated, the polymerisation transition resembles a phase\ntransition. We are able to describe hysteresis, overshooting, undershooting and\nthe existence of a lag time before polymerisation takes o?, and pinpoint the\nconditions required for observing these types of phenomenon in the assembly and\ndisassembly kinetics. We argue that the phenomenological kinetic parameter in\nour theory is a pathway controller, i.e., it controls the relative weights of\nthe molecular pathways through which self-assembly takes place.\n", "  We study a model of rolling particles subject to stochastic fluctuations,\nwhich may be relevant in systems of nano- or micro-scale particles where\nrolling is an approximation for strong static friction. We consider the\nsimplest possible non-trivial system: a linear polymer of three of discs\nconstrained to remain in contact, and immersed in an equilibrium heat bath so\nthe internal angle of the polymer changes due to stochastic fluctuations. We\ncompare two cases: one where the discs can slide relative to each other, and\nthe other where they are constrained to roll, like gears. Starting from the\nLangevin equations with arbitrary linear velocity constraints, we use formal\nhomogenization theory to derive the overdamped equations that describe the\nprocess in configuration space only. The resulting dynamics have the formal\nstructure of a Brownian motion on a Riemannian or sub-Riemannian manifold,\ndepending on if the velocity constraints are holonomic or non-holonomic. We use\nthis to compute the trimer's equilibrium distribution both with, and without,\nthe rolling constraints. Surprisingly, the two distributions are different. We\nsuggest two possible interpretations of this result: either (i) dry friction\n(or other dissipative, nonequilibrium forces) changes basic thermodynamic\nquantities like the free energy of a system, a statement that could be tested\nexperimentally, or (ii) as a lesson in modeling rolling or friction more\ngenerally as a velocity constraint when stochastic fluctuations are present. In\nthe latter case, we speculate there could be a \"roughness\" entropy whose\ninclusion as an effective force could compensate the constraint and preserve\nclassical Boltzmann statistics. Regardless of the interpretation, our\ncalculation shows the word \"rolling\" must be used with care when stochastic\nfluctuations are present.\n", "  In order to predict InterGranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) of\npost-irradiated austenitic stainless steel in Light Water Reactor (LWR)\nenvironment, reliable predictions of intergranular stresses are required.\nFinite elements simulations have been performed on realistic polycrystalline\naggregate with a recently proposed physically-based crystal plasticity\nconstitutive equations validated for neutron-irradiated austenitic stainless\nsteel. Intergranular normal stress probability density functions are found with\nrespect to plastic strain and irradiation level, for uniaxial loading\nconditions. In addition, plastic slip activity jumps at grain boundaries are\nalso presented. Intergranular normal stress distributions describe, from a\nstatistical point of view, the potential increase of intergranular stress with\nrespect to the macroscopic stress due to grain-grain interactions. The\ndistributions are shown to be well described by a master curve once rescaled by\nthe macroscopic stress, in the range of irradiation level and strain considered\nin this study. The upper tail of this master curve is shown to be insensitive\nto free surface effect, which is relevant for IGSCC\n", "  Our knowledge of the chemical properties of the circumstellar ejecta of the\nmost massive evolved stars is particularly poor. We aim to study the chemical\ncharacteristics of the prototypical yellow hypergiant star, IRC +10420. For\nthis purpose, we obtained full line surveys at 1 and 3mm atmospheric windows.\n  We have identified 106 molecular emission lines from 22 molecular species.\nApproximately half of the molecules detected are N-bearing species, in\nparticular HCN, HNC, CN, NO, NS, PN, and N2H+. We used rotational diagrams to\nderive the density and rotational temperature of the different molecular\nspecies detected. We introduced an iterative method that allows us to take\nmoderate line opacities into account.\n  We have found that IRC +10420 presents high abundances of the N-bearing\nmolecules compared with O-rich evolved stars. This result supports the presence\nof a N-rich chemistry, expected for massive stars. Our analysis also suggests a\ndecrease of the 12C/13C ratio from \\gtrsim 7 to \\sim 3.7 in the last 3800\nyears, which can be directly related to the nitrogen enrichment observed. In\naddition, we found that SiO emission presents a significant intensity decrease\nfor high-J lines when compared with older observations. Radiative transfer\nmodeling shows that this variation can be explained by a decrease in the\ninfrared (IR) flux of the dust. The origin of this decrease might be an\nexpansion of the dust shell or a lower stellar temperature due to the pulsation\nof the star.\n", "  Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings.\nSuch poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting\nthat they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The\npersistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favor them,\nleading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no\nconscious strategizing---no deliberate cheating nor loafing---by scientists,\nonly that publication is a principle factor for career advancement. Some\nnormative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further\npublication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a\nshift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding\nunderstanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and\ncomputational modeling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical\npower in the behavioral sciences and show that power has not improved despite\nrepeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate\nthe logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic\nmodel of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate\nnovel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research\nmethods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more \"progeny\", such\nthat their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to\nstart labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and\nincreasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication\nslows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving\nthe quality of research requires change at the institutional level.\n", "  The low-energy strong interaction of antikaons (K-) with nuclei has many\nfacets and rep- resents a lively and challenging research field. It is\ninterconnected to the peculiar role of strangeness, since the strange quark is\nrather light, but still much heavier than the up and down quarks. Thus, when\nstrangeness is involved one has to deal with spontaneous and explicit symmetry\nbreaking in QCD. It is well known that the antikaon interaction with nucleons\nis attractive, but how strong ? Is the interaction strong enough to bind\nnucleons to form kaonic nuclei and, if so, what are the properties (binding\nenergy, decay width)? There are controversial indications for such bound states\nand new results are expected to come soon. The existence of antikaon mediated\nbound states might have important consequences since it would open the\npossibility for the formation of cold baryonic matter of high density which\nmight have a severe impact in astrophysics for the understanding of the\ncomposi- tion of compact (neutron) stars. New experimental opportunities could\nbe provided by the AMADEUS experiment at the DA?NE electron-positron collider\nat LNF-INFN (Frascati, Italy). Pre-AMADEUS studies on the antikaon interaction\nwith nuclei are carried out by analysis of data collected by KLOE in till 2005\nand in special data runs using a carbon target insert. Studies for the\ndedicated AMADEUS detector setup taking advantage of the low-energy antikaons\nfrom Phi-meson decay delivered by DAFNE are in progress. Some re- sults\nobtained so far and the perspectives of the AMADEUS experiment are presented\nand discussed.\n", "  We present the first IceCube search for a signal of dark matter annihilations\nin the Milky Way using all-flavour neutrino-induced particle cascades. The\nanalysis focuses on the DeepCore sub-detector of IceCube, and uses the\nsurrounding IceCube strings as a veto region in order to select starting events\nin the DeepCore volume. We use 329 live-days of data from IceCube operating in\nits 86-string configuration during 2011-2012. No neutrino excess is found, the\nfinal result being compatible with the background-only hypothesis. From this\nnull result, we derive upper limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation\ncross-section, < \\sigma_A v >, for dark matter candidate masses ranging from 30\nGeV up to 10 TeV, assuming both a cuspy and a flat-cored dark matter halo\nprofile. For dark matter masses between 200 GeV and 10 TeV, the results improve\non all previous IceCube results on < \\sigma_A v >, reaching a level of 10^{-23}\ncm^3 s^-1, depending on the annihilation channel assumed, for a cusped NFW\nprofile. The analysis demonstrates that all-flavour searches are competitive\nwith muon channel searches despite the intrinsically worse angular resolution\nof cascades compared to muon tracks in IceCube.\n", "  In a recent work by us, we have studied, how CP violation discovery potential\ncan be improved at long baseline neutrino experiments (LBNE/DUNE), by combining\nwith its ND (near detector) and reactor experiments. In this work, we discuss\nhow this study can be further analysed to resolve entanglement of the quadrant\nof leptonic CPV phase and Octant of atmospheric mixing angle $ \\theta_{23} $,\nat LBNEs. The study is done for both NH (Normal hierarchy) and IH (Inverted\nhierarchy), HO (Higher Octant) and LO (Lower Octant). We show how baryogenesis\ncan enhance the effect of resolving this entanglement, and how possible values\nof the leptonic CP-violating phase $ \\delta_{CP} $ can be predicted in this\ncontext. With respect to the latest global fit data of neutrino mixing angles,\nwe predict the values of $ \\delta_{CP} $ for different cases. In this context\nwe present favoured values of $ \\delta_{CP} $ ($ \\delta_{CP} $ range at $ \\geq\n$ 2$ \\sigma $ ) constrained by the latest updated BAU range and also confront\nour predictions of $ \\delta_{CP} $ with an up-to-date global analysis of\nneutrino oscillation data. We find that some region of the favoured $\n\\delta_{CP} $ parameter space lies within the best fit values around $\n\\delta_{CP} \\simeq 1.3\\pi-1.4 \\pi $. A detailed analytic and numerical study of\nbaryogenesis through leptogenesis is performed in this framework in a model\nindependent way.\n", "  According to Stokes' law, a moving solid surface experiences dissipation that\nis linearly related to its velocity and the viscosity of the medium. This\nlinear dependence on viscosity forms the basis for many characterization\ntechniques for liquids. Unlike viscosities of different liquids, viscosities of\ngases vary only in a narrow range which limits their use as an effective\ncharacterization parameter using moving structures. Here we report experimental\nresults of dissipation showing exponential dependence on viscosity for\noscillating surfaces modified with nanostructures. The surface nanostructures\nalter solid-gas interplay greatly, amplifying the dissipation response\nexponentially for even minute variations in viscosity. Nanostructured resonator\nthus allows discrimination of otherwise narrow range of gaseous viscosity\nmaking it an ideal detection parameter for analysis. We attribute the observed\nexponential enhancement to the stochastic nature of interactions of many\ncoupled nanostructures with the gas media.\n", "  We study the inelastic light scattering response in two- (2D) and\nthree-dimensional (3D) Kitaev spin-liquid models with \\ms band structures in\nthe symmetry classes BDI and D leading to protected gapless surface modes. We\npresent a detailed calculation of the resonant Raman/Brillouin scattering\nvertex relevant to iridate and ruthenate compounds whose low-energy physics is\nbelieved to be proximate to these spin-liquid phases. In the symmetry class\nBDI, we find that while the resonant scattering on thin films can detect the\ngapless boundary modes of spin liquids, the non-resonant processes do not\ncouple to them. For the symmetry class D, however, we find that the coupling\nbetween both types of light-scattering processes and the low-energy surface\nstates is strongly suppressed. Additionally, we describe the effect of weak\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking perturbations on the bulk Raman response of\nthese systems.\n", "  We study the Schr\\\"odinger-Robertson uncertainty relations in an algebraic\nframework. Moreover, we show that some specific commutation relations imply new\nequalities, which are regarded as equality versions of well-known inequalities\nsuch as Hardy's inequality.\n", "  We study the evolution of 3d weakly interacting bosons at finite chemical\npotential with the stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We fully characterise\nthe vortex network in an out of equilibrium. At high temperature the filament\nstatistics are the ones of fully-packed loop models. The vortex tangle\nundergoes a geometric percolation transition within the thermodynamically\nordered phase. After infinitely fast quenches across the thermodynamic critical\npoint deep into the ordered phase, we identify a first approach towards the\ncritical percolation state, a later coarsening process that does not alter the\nfractal properties of the long vortex loops, and a final approach to\nequilibrium. Our results are also relevant to the statistics of linear defects\nin type II superconductors, magnetic materials and cosmological models.\n", "  We investigate the stability of the pion string in a thermal bath and a dense\nmedium. We find that stability is dependent on the order of the chiral\ntransition. String core stability within the experimentally allowed regime is\nfound only if the chiral transition is second order, and even there the stable\nregion is small, i.e., the temperature below which the core is unstable is\nclose to the critical temperature of the phase transition. We also find that\nthe presence of a dense medium, in addition to the thermal bath, enhances the\nexperimentally accessible region with stable strings. We also argue that once\nthe string core decays, the \"effective winding\" of the string persists at large\ndistances from the string core. Our analysis is done both in the chiral limit,\nwhich is mainly what has been explored in the literature up to now, and for the\nphysical $h \\ne 0$ case, where a conceptual framework is set up for addressing\nthis regime and some simple estimates are done.\n", "  According to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, black hole jets are powered by\nthe rotational energy of the compact object. In this work, we consider the\npossibility that the metric around black holes may not be described by the Kerr\nsolution and we study how this changes the Blandford-Znajek model. If the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism is responsible for the formation of jets, the\nestimate of the jet power in combination with another measurement can test the\nnature of black hole candidates and constrain possible deviations from the Kerr\nsolution. However, this approach might become competitive with respect to other\ntechniques only when it will be possible to have measurements much more precise\nthan those available today.\n", "  Hierarchical structure formation leads to a clumpy distribution of dark\nmatter in the Milky Way. These clumps are possible targets to search for dark\nmatter annihilation with present and future $\\gamma$-ray instruments. Many\nuncertainties exist on the clump distribution, leading to disputed conclusions\nabout the expected number of detectable clumps and the ensuing limits that can\nbe obtained from non-detection. In this paper, we use the CLUMPY code to\nsimulate thousands of skymaps for several clump distributions. This allows us\nto statistically assess the typical properties (mass, distance, angular size,\nluminosity) of the detectable clumps. Varying parameters of the clump\ndistributions allows us to identify the key quantities to which the number of\ndetectable clumps is the most sensitive. Focusing our analysis on two extreme\nclump configurations, yet consistent with results from numerical simulations,\nwe revisit and compare various calculations made for the Fermi-LAT instrument,\nin terms of number of dark clumps expected and the angular power spectrum for\nthe Galactic signal. We then focus on the prospects of detecting dark clumps\nwith the future CTA instrument, for which we make a detailed sensitivity\nanalysis using open-source CTA software. Based on a realistic scenario for the\nforeseen CTA extragalactic survey, and accounting for a post-trial sensitivity\nin the survey, we show that we obtain competitive and complementary limits to\nthose based on long observation of a single bright dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\n", "  We study the effect of electronic Coulomb correlations on the vacancy\nformation energy in paramagnetic alpha-Fe within ab initio dynamical mean-field\ntheory. The calculated value for the formation energy is substantially lower\nthan in standard density-functional calculations and in excellent agreement\nwith experiment. The reduction is caused by an enhancement of electronic\ncorrelations at the nearest neighbors of the vacancy. This effect is explained\nby subtle changes in the corresponding spectral function of the d-electrons.\nThe local lattice relaxations around the vacancy are substantially increased by\nmany-body effects.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to present a detailed numerical study of the\nsecond-order phase transition in the 2D Ising model. The importance of\ncorrectly presenting elementary theory of phase transitions, computational\nalgorithms and finite-size scaling techniques results in a important\nunderstanding of both the Ising model and the second order phase transitions.\nIn doing so, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations are performed for different\nlattice sizes with periodic boundary conditions. Energy, magnetization,\nspecific heat, magnetic susceptibility and the correlation function are\ncalculated and the critical exponents determined by finite-size scaling\ntechniques. The importance of the correlation length as the relevant parameter\nin phase transitions is emphasized.\n", "  Frequency-domain two-dimensional Raman signals, which are equivalent to\ncoherent two-dimensional Raman scattering (COTRAS) signals, for liquid water\nand carbon tetrachloride were calculated using an equilibrium-nonequilibrium\nhybrid MD simulation algorithm. We elucidate mechanisms governing the 2D signal\nprofiles involving anharmonic mode-mode coupling and the nonlinearities of the\npolarizability for the intermolecular and intramolecular vibrational modes. The\npredicted signal profiles and intensities can be utilized to analyze recently\ndeveloped single-beam 2D spectra, whose signals are generated from a coherently\ncontrolled pulse, allowing the single-beam measurement to be carried out more\nefficiently.\n", "  The strongest transitions of Zn and CrII are the most sensitive to relative\nvariations in the fine-structure constant ($\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$) among the\ntransitions commonly observed in quasar absorption spectra. They also lie\nwithin just 40\\AA\\ of each other (rest frame), so they are resistant to the\nmain systematic error affecting most previous measurements of\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$: long-range distortions of the wavelength calibration.\nWhile Zn and CrII absorption is normally very weak in quasar spectra, we\nobtained high signal-to-noise, high-resolution echelle spectra from the Keck\nand Very Large Telescopes of 9 rare systems where it is strong enough to\nconstrain $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ from these species alone. These provide 12\nindependent measurements (3 quasars were observed with both telescopes) at\nredshifts 1.0--2.4, 11 of which pass stringent reliability criteria. These 11\nare all consistent with $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha=0$ within their individual\nuncertainties of 3.5--13 parts per million (ppm), with a weighted mean\n$\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha = 1.2\\pm1.7_{\\rm stat}\\pm0.9_{\\rm sys}$ ppm (1$\\sigma$\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties), indicating no significant\ncosmological variations in $\\alpha$. This is the first statistical sample of\nabsorbers that is resistant to long-range calibration distortions (at the $<$1\nppm level), with a precision comparable to previous large samples of $\\sim$150\n(distortion-affected) absorbers. Our systematic error budget is instead\ndominated by much shorter-range distortions repeated across echelle orders of\nindividual spectra.\n", "  Understanding fluctuation of users help stakeholders to provide a better\nsupport to communities. Below we present an experiment where we detect\ncommunities, their evolution and based on the data characterize users that\nstay, leave or join a community. Using a resulted feature set and logistic\nregression we operate with models of users that are joining and users that are\nstaying in a community. In the related work we emphasize a number of features\nwe will include in our future experiments to enhance train accuracy. This work\nrepresents a first from a series of experiments devoted to user fluctuation in\ncommunities.\n", "  We study a three-dimensional system of self-propelled Lennard-Jones particles\nusing Brownian Dynamics simulations. Using recent theoretical results for\nactive matter, we calculate the pressure and report equations of state for the\nsystem. Additionally, we chart the vapour-liquid coexistence and show that the\ncoexistence densities can be well described using simple power laws. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that our out-of-equilibrium system shows deviations from both the\nlaw of rectilinear diameters and the law of corresponding states.\n", "  This paper studies the problem of receiver modeling in molecular\ncommunication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication\nchannel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a\nfluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter\nnano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order\ndegradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can\nparticipate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor\nproteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,\nwe assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor\nmolecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected\nreceived signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated\nreceptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we\nconsider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the\nuniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only\npartially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be\naccurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario\nafter appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy\nof the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based\nsimulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the\neffect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.\n", "  Conditions for spontaneous Charge-Parity (CP) violation in the scalar\npotential sector of general $S(3)$ Higgs-doublet model (3HDM) are analyzed. An\nanalysis of the Higgs sector of the minimal $S(3)$-invariant extension of the\nStandard Model including CP violation arising from the spontaneous breaking of\nthe electroweak symmetry is presented. This extended Higgs sector with three\nSU(2) doublets Higgs fields with complex vev's provides an interesting scenario\nto analyze the Higgs masses spectrum, trilinear self-couplings and CP\nviolation. We present how the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking, coming\nfrom three $S(3)$ Higgs fields, gives an interesting scenario with nine\nphysical Higgs and three Goldstone bosons, when spontaneous CP violation arises\nfrom the Higgs field $S(3)$ singlet $H_S$.\n", "  We study theoretically the structural and electronic response of layered bulk\nblack phosphorus to in-layer strain. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations reveal that the strain energy and interlayer spacing display a\nstrong anisotropy with respect to the uniaxial strain direction. To correctly\ndescribe the dependence of the fundamental band gap on strain, we used the\ncomputationally more involved GW quasiparticle approach that is free of\nparameters and superior to DFT studies, which are known to underestimate gap\nenergies. We find that the band gap depends sensitively on the in-layer strain\nand even vanishes at compressive strain values exceeding about 2%, thus\nsuggesting a possible application of black P in strain-controlled infrared\ndevices.\n", "  We employ the perturbative field-theoretic renormalization group method to\ninvestigate the universal critical behavior near the continuous non-equilibrium\nphase transition in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with additive white\nnoise. This stochastic partial differential describes a remarkably wide range\nof physical systems: coupled non-linear oscillators subject to external noise\nnear a Hopf bifurcation instability; spontaneous structure formation in\nnon-equilibrium systems, e.g., in cyclically competing populations; and\ndriven-dissipative Bose--Einstein condensation, realized in open systems on the\ninterface of quantum optics and many-body physics, such as cold atomic gases\nand exciton-polaritons in pumped semiconductor quantum wells in optical\ncavities. Our starting point is a noisy, dissipative Gross-Pitaevski or\nnon-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation, or equivalently purely relaxational kinetics\noriginating from a complex-valued Landau-Ginzburg functional, which generalizes\nthe standard equilibrium model A critical dynamics of a non-conserved complex\norder parameter field. We study the universal critical behavior of this system\nin the early stages of its relaxation from a Gaussian-weighted fully randomized\ninitial state. In this critical aging regime, time translation invariance is\nbroken, and the dynamics is characterized by the stationary static and dynamic\ncritical exponents, as well as an independent `initial-slip' exponent. We show\nthat to first order in the dimensional expansion about the upper critical\ndimension, this initial-slip exponent in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation\nis identical to its equilibrium model A counterpart. We furthermore employ the\nrenormalization group flow equations as well as construct a suitable complex\nspherical model extension to argue that this conclusion likely remains true to\nall orders in the perturbation expansion.\n", "  We analyze patterns of dynamical symmetry breaking in strongly coupled chiral\ngauge theories with direct-product gauge groups $G$. If the gauge coupling for\na factor group $G_i \\subset G$ becomes sufficiently strong, it can produce\nbilinear fermion condensates that break the $G_i$ symmetry itself and/or break\nother gauge symmetries $G_j \\subset G$. Our comparative study of a number of\nstrongly coupled direct-product chiral gauge theories elucidates how the\npatterns of symmetry breaking depend on the structure of $G$ and on the\nrelative sizes of the gauge couplings corresponding to factor groups in the\ndirect product.\n", "  We extended and corrected Mott's two-band model for the\ncomposition-dependence of thermal and electrical conductivity in binary metal\nalloys based on high-throughput time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR)\nmeasurements on diffusion multiples and scatterer-density calculations from\nfirst principles. Examining PdAg, PtRh, AuAg, AuCu, PdCu, PdPt, and NiRh binary\nalloys, we found that the nature of the two dominant scatterer-bands considered\nin the Mott model changes with the alloys, and should be interpreted as a\ncombination of the dominant element-specific s- and/or d-orbitals. Using\ncalculated orbital and element-resolved density-of-states values calculated\nwith density functional theory as input, we determined the correct orbital mix\nthat dominates electron scattering for all examined alloys and find excellent\nagreement between fitted models and experiments. The proposed description of\nthe composition dependence of the resistivity can be readily implemented into\nthe CALPHAD framework.\n", "  A recent Letter, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 161804 (2016), claims that for typical\ndark matter axion search experiments using cylindrical haloscopes, the power\ngain depends on the relative position of a cavity with respect to the center of\na solenoidal magnetic field due to different electric and magnetic couplings.\nWe review this Letter and find a misinterpretation of the coordinate system. We\ncorrect this and see no dependence of the coupling strength on the cavity\nlocation and the electric and magnetic energies stored in a cavity mode are\nequal.\n", "  In this paper we describe integral field spectroscopic observations of four\nsouthern Galactic Planetary Nebulae (PNe), M3-4, M3-6, Hen2-29 and Hen2-37\ncovering the spectral range, 3400-7000 A. We derive the ionisation structure,\nthe physical conditions, the chemical compositions and the kinematical\ncharacteristics of these PNe and find good agreement with previous studies that\nrelied upon the long-slit technique in their co-spatial area. From their\nchemical compositions as well as their spatial and kinematic characteristics,\nwe determined that Hen2-29 is of the Peimbert Type I (He and N rich), while the\nother three are of Type II. The strength of the nebular He II line reveals that\nM3-3, Hen2-29 and Hen2-37 are of mid to high excitation classes while M3-6 is a\nlow excitation planetary nebula (PN). A series of emission-line maps extracted\nfrom the data cubes were constructed for each PN to describe its overall\nstructure. These show remarkable morphological diversity. Spatially resolved\nspectroscopy of M3-6, shows that the recombination lines of CII, CIII, CIV and\nNIII are of nebular origin, rather than arising from the central star as had\nbeen previously proposed. This result increases doubts regarding the weak\nemission-line star (WELS) classification raised by Basurah et al. (2016). In\naddition, they reinforce the probability that most genuine cases of WELS are\narise from irradiation effects in close binary central stars (Miszalski 2009).\n", "  We study the nature of potentials in scalar field based models for dark\nenergy - with both canonical and noncanonical kinetic terms. We calculate\nnumerically, and using an analytic approximation around $a\\approx 1$,\npotentials for models with constant equation-of-state parameter, $w_{\\phi}$. We\nfind that for a wide range of models with canonical and noncanonical kinetic\nterms there is a simple approximation for the potential that holds when the\nscale factor is in the range $0.6\\lesssim a\\lesssim 1.4$. We discuss how this\nform of the potential can also be used to represent models with non-constant\n$w_{\\phi}$ and, hence, how it could be used in reconstruction from cosmological\ndata.\n", "  We investigate the zero-temperature superfluid to insulator transitions in a\ndiluted two-dimensional quantum rotor model with particle-hole symmetry. We map\nthe Hamiltonian onto a classical $(2+1)$-dimensional XY model with columnar\ndisorder which we analyze by means of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. For\ndilutions below the lattice percolation threshold, the system undergoes a\ngeneric superfluid-Mott glass transition. In contrast to other quantum phase\ntransitions in disordered systems, its critical behavior is of conventional\npower-law type with universal (dilution-independent) critical exponents\n$z=1.52(3)$, $\\nu=1.16(5)$, $\\beta/\\nu= 0.48(2)$, $\\gamma/\\nu=2.52(4)$, and\n$\\eta=-0.52(4)$. These values agree with and improve upon earlier Monte-Carlo\nresults [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 015703 (2004)] while (partially) excluding other\nfindings in the literature. As a further test of universality, we also consider\na soft-spin version of the classical Hamiltonian. In addition, we study the\npercolation quantum phase transition across the lattice percolation threshold;\nits critical behavior is governed by the lattice percolation exponents in\nagreement with recent theoretical predictions. We relate our results to a\ngeneral classification of phase transitions in disordered systems, and we\nbriefly discuss experiments.\n", "  Carbon nanotube (CNT) have been known to increase the heat transfer at the\nsolid-liquid interfaces, but have a limitation due to the interfacial thermal\nresistance. Vibrational mismatch at the interface leads to this interfacial\nthermal resistance, which plays an important role in energy transfer at the\nboundary. Negligible work has been reported on the influence of CNT diameter on\nthe resistance through the vibrational mismatch study. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations have been performed to investigate the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance between carbon nanotube (CNT) and water molecules. This\nwork is an effort to understand the heat transfer phenomenon at the interface\nby quantifying the vibrational mismatch. Analysis of the vibrational spectra of\nCNT and water molecules is done to study the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance. Starting with the initial configuration, and\nequilibrating the system of CNT and water molecules at 300 K and 1 atm, the CNT\ntemperature is raised to 700 K by velocity rescaling. This system is now\nallowed to relax as a micro-canonical ensemble. Based on the lumped capacitance\nanalysis, the time constant of the CNT temperature response is determined,\nwhich is then used to compute the interfacial thermal resistance. The\ninterfacial thermal resistance is observed to be relatively higher for the\nlarger diameter nanotube. This is attributed to the higher vibrational mismatch\nexisting for larger diameter CNT as a result of low overlapping region between\nvibrational density states of CNT and water molecules. For smaller diameter\nCNT, the interfacial thermal resistance is low which results in the efficient\nheat transfer at the interface thus, emphasizing the indispensable role of\nlarger diameter CNTs in the cooling applications.\n", "  We analyze extragalactic extinction profiles derived through gamma-ray burst\nafterglows, using a dust model specifically constructed on the assumption that\ndust grains are not immutable but respond time-dependently to the local\nphysics. Such a model includes core-mantle spherical particles of mixed\nchemical composition (silicate core, sp2 and sp3 carbonaceous layers), and an\nadditional molecular component, in the form of free-flying polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons. We fit most of the observed extinction profiles. Failures occur\nfor lines of sight presenting remarkable rises blueward the bump. We find a\ntendency in the carbon chemical structure to become more aliphatic with the\ngalactic activity, and to some extent with increasing redshifts. Moreover, the\ncontribution of the moleclar component to the total extinction is more\nimportant in younger objects. The results of the fitting procedure (either\nsuccesses and failures) may be naturally interpreted through an evolutionary\nprescription based on the carbon cycle in the interstellar medium of galaxies.\n", "  In this study we coded, for individual student participation on each\nquestion, the video of twenty-seven groups interacting in the group phase of a\nvariety of two-phase exams. We found that maximum group participation occurred\non questions where at least one person in the group had answered that question\nincorrectly during the solo phase of the exam. We also observed that those\nstudents that were correct on a question during the solo phase have higher\nparticipation than those that were incorrect. Finally we observed that, from a\nparticipation standpoint, the strongest (weakest) students seem to benefit the\nmost (least) from heterogeneous groups, while homogeneous groups do not seem to\nfavor students of any particular performance level.\n", "  Solar rotational tomography (SRT) applied to white-light coronal images\nobserved at multiple aspect angles has been the preferred approach for\ndetermining the three-dimensional (3D) electron density structure of the solar\ncorona. However, it is seriously hampered by the restrictive assumption that\nthe corona is time-invariant which introduces significant errors in the\nreconstruction. We first explore several methods to mitigate the temporal\nvariation of the corona by decoupling the \"fast-varying\" inner corona from the\n\"slow-moving\" outer corona using multiple masking (either by juxtaposition or\nrecursive combination) and radial weighting. Weighting with a radial\nexponential profile provides some improvement over a classical reconstruction\nbut only beyond 3 Rsun. We next consider a full time-dependent tomographic\nreconstruction involving spatio-temporal regularization and further introduce a\nco-rotating regularization aimed at preventing concentration of reconstructed\ndensity in the plane of the sky. Crucial to testing our procedure and properly\ntuning the regularization parameters is the introduction of a time-dependent\nMHD model of the corona based on observed magnetograms to build a time-series\nof synthetic images of the corona. Our procedure, which successfully reproduces\nthe time-varying model corona, is finally applied to a set of of 53 LASCO-C2 pB\nimages roughly evenly spaced in time from 15 to 29 March 2009. Our procedure\npaves the way to a time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronal\nelectron density to the whole set of LASCO-C2 images presently spanning 20\nyears.\n", "  Mellin-Barnes (MB) techniques applied to integrals emerging in particle\nphysics perturbative calculations are summarized. New versions of AMBRE\npackages which construct planar and nonplanar MB representations are shortly\ndiscussed. The numerical package MBnumerics.m is presented for the first time\nwhich is able to calculate with a high precision multidimensional MB integrals\nin Minkowskian regions. Examples are given for massive vertex integrals which\ninclude threshold effects and several scale parameters.\n", "  Spin splitting bands that arises in conduction band minimum (CBM) of WS2\nmonolayer (ML) play an important role in the new spin-orbit phenomena such as\nspin-valley coupled electronics. However, application of strain strongly\nmodifies electronic properties of the WS2 ML, which is expected to\nsignificantly affect to the properties of the spin splitting bands. Here, by\nusing fully-relativistic first-principles calculations based on\ndensity-functional theory, we show that a substantial spin spliting bands\nobserved in the CBM is effectively controlled and tuned by applying the biaxial\nstrain. We also find that these spin splitting bands induce spin textures\nexhibiting fully out-of-plane spin polarization in the opposite direction\nbetween the K and Q points and their time reversals in the first Brillouin\nzone. Our study clarify that the strain plays an significant role in the\nspin-orbit coupling of the WS2 ML, which has very important implications in\ndesigning future spintronics devices.\n", "  The prediction of the effective electroweak mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_{\\rm\neff}^{\\rm b}$ in the Standard Model at two-loop accuracy has now been completed\nby the first calculation of the bosonic two-loop corrections to the $Z{\\bar\nb}b$ vertex. Numerical predictions are presented in the form of a fitting\nformula as function of $M_Z, M_W, M_H, m_t$ and $\\Delta{\\alpha}$, ${\\alpha_{\\rm\ns}}$. For central input values, we obtain a relative correction of\n$\\Delta\\kappa_{\\rm b}^{(\\alpha^2,\\rm bos)} = -0.9855 \\times 10^{-4}$, amounting\nto about a quarter of the fermionic corrections, and corresponding to\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm b} = 0.232704$. The integration of the\ncorresponding two-loop vertex Feynman integrals with up to three dimensionless\nparameters in Minkowskian kinematics has been performed with two approaches:\n(i) Sector decomposition, implemented in the packages FIESTA 3 and SecDec 3,\nand (ii) Mellin-Barnes representations, implemented in AMBRE 3/MB and the new\npackage MBnumerics.\n", "  Limited angle problem is a challenging issue in x-ray computed tomography\n(CT) field. Iterative reconstruction methods that utilize the additional prior\ncan suppress artifacts and improve image quality, but unfortunately require\nincreased computation time. An interesting way is to restrain the artifacts in\nthe images reconstructed from the practical filtered back projection (FBP)\nmethod. Frikel and Quinto have proved that the streak artifacts in FBP results\ncould be characterized. It indicates that the artifacts created by FBP method\nhave specific and similar characteristics in a stationary limited-angle\nscanning configuration. Based on this understanding, this work aims at\ndeveloping a method to extract and suppress specific artifacts of FBP\nreconstructions for limited-angle tomography. A data-driven learning-based\nmethod is proposed based on a deep convolutional neural network. An end-to-end\nmapping between the FBP and artifact-free images is learned and the implicit\nfeatures involving artifacts will be extracted and suppressed via nonlinear\nmapping. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of experimental results\nindicate that the proposed method show a stable and prospective performance on\nartifacts reduction and detail recovery for limited angle tomography. The\npresented strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for improving image\nquality of the reconstruction results from limited projection data.\n", "  We study the spin resonance in superconducting state of iron-based materials\nwithin multiband models with two unequal gaps, $\\Delta_L$ and $\\Delta_S$, on\ndifferent Fermi surface pockets. We show that due to the indirect nature of the\ngap entering the spin susceptibility at the nesting wave vector $\\mathbf{Q}$\nthe total gap $\\tilde\\Delta$ in the bare susceptibility is determined by the\nsum of gaps on two different Fermi surface sheets connected by $\\mathbf{Q}$.\nFor the Fermi surface geometry characteristic to the most of iron pnictides and\nchalcogenides, the indirect gap is either $\\tilde\\Delta = \\Delta_L + \\Delta_S$\nor $\\tilde\\Delta = 2\\Delta_L$. In the $s_{++}$ state, spin excitations below\n$\\tilde\\Delta$ are absent unless additional scattering mechanisms are assumed.\nThe spin resonance appears in the $s_\\pm$ superconducting state at frequency\n$\\omega_R \\leq \\tilde\\Delta$. Comparison with available inelastic neutron\nscattering data confirms that what is seen is the true spin resonance and not a\npeak inherent to the $s_{++}$ state.\n", "  Using first principles methods we calculated the entire {\\gamma}-surface of\nthe first order pyramidal planes in {\\alpha}-titanium. Slip on these planes\ninvolving dislocations with c + a dislocations is one means by which\n{\\alpha}-titanium polycrystals may supplement slip on prism planes with a-type\nBurgers vectors to maintain ductility. We find two stable intrinsic stacking\nfaults with relatively small energies. We show that dissociation of c + a\ndislocations into two dislocations with Burgers vectors (c + a)/2 is not\npossible in {\\alpha}-titanium because there is no stable stacking fault at (c +\na)/2. Instead we propose a possible dissociation of a c + a dislocation into\nthree partial dislocations separated by the two intrinsic faults we have\nidentified.\n", "  The crazing behavior of polymer nanocomposites formed by blending polymer\ngrafted nanoparticles with an entangled polymer melt is studied by molecular\ndynamics simulations. We focus on the three key differences in the crazing\nbehavior of a composite relative to the pure homopolymer matrix, namely, a\nlower yield stress, a smaller extension ratio and a grafted chain length\ndependent failure stress. The yield behavior is found to be mostly controlled\nby the local nanoparticle-grafted polymer interfacial energy, with the grafted\npolymer-polymer matrix interfacial structure being of little to no relevance.\nIncreasing the attraction between nanoparticle core and the grafted polymer\ninhibits void nucleation and leads to a higher yield stress. In the craze\ngrowth regime, the presence of grafted chain sections of 100 monomers alters\nthe mechanical response of composite samples, giving rise to smaller extension\nratios and higher drawing stresses than for the homopolymer matrix. The\ndominant failure mechanism of composite samples depends strongly on the length\nof the grafted chains, with disentanglement being the dominant mechanism for\nshort chains, while bond breaking is the failure mode for chain lengths greater\nthan 10Ne, where Ne is the entanglement length.\n", "  The measurement of proton plus helium and all-particle energy spectra in the\nrange $20\\,$ TeV to $5 \\,$PeV and $80 \\,$TeV to $5 \\,$PeV respectively are\npresented. Data taken by the ARGO-YBJ detector in the 2010 year have been\nanalyzed. The ARGO-YBJ experiment (Tibet, P. R. China) has been taking data for\nmore than five years by means of a full-coverage array of RPC detectors. The\ndiscrimination between showers produced by light and heavy primaries has been\nperformed by looking at the lateral particle density close to the core region.\nA Bayesian unfolding technique was therefore applied to the measured quantities\nin order to evaluate the cosmic ray energy spectrum. The proton plus helium\nspectrum clearly shows a bending at about $1 \\,$PeV, while the all-particle\nspectrum is consistent with previous observations.\n", "  Working in a quenched setup with Wilson twisted mass valence fermions, we\nexplore the possibility to compute non-perturbatively the step scaling function\nusing the coordinate (X-space) renormalization scheme. This scheme has the\nadvantage of being on-shell and gauge invariant. The step scaling method allows\nus to calculate the running of the renormalization constants of quark bilinear\noperators. We describe here the details of this calculation. The aim of this\nexploratory study is to identify the feasibility of the X-space scheme when\nused in small volume simulations required by the step scaling technique.\nEventually, we translate our final results to the continuum MSbar scheme and\ncompare against four-loop analytic formulae finding satisfactory agreement.\n", "  Ferroelectricity at room temperature has been demonstrated in nanometer-thin\nquasi 2D croconic acid thin films, by the polarization hysteresis loop\nmeasurements in macroscopic capacitor geometry, along with observation and\nmanipulation of the nanoscale domain structure by piezoresponse force\nmicroscopy. The fabrication of continuous thin films of the hydrogen-bonded\ncroconic acid was achieved by the suppression of the thermal decomposition\nusing low evaporation temperatures in high vacuum, combined with growth\nconditions far from thermal equilibrium. For nominal coverages >=20 nm, quasi\n2D and polycrystalline films, with an average grain size of 50-100 nm and 3.5\nnm roughness, can be obtained. Spontaneous ferroelectric domain structures of\nthe thin films have been observed and appear to correlate with the grain\npatterns. The application of this solvent-free growth protocol may be a key to\nthe development of flexible organic ferroelectric thin films for electronic\napplications.\n", "  Physics is one of the most successful endeavors in science. Being a\nprototypic big science it also reflects the growing tendency for scientific\ncollaborations. Utilizing 250,000 papers from ArXiv.org a prepublishing\nplatform prevalent in Physics we construct large coauthorship networks to\ninvestigate how individual network positions influence scientific success. In\nthis context, success is seen as getting a paper published in high impact\njournals of physical subdisciplines as compared to not getting it published at\nall or in rather peripheral journals only. To control the nested levels of\nauthors and papers, and to consider the time elapsing between working paper and\nprominent journal publication we employ multilevel eventhistory models with\nvarious network measures as covariates. Our results show that the maintenance\nof even a moderate number of persistent ties is crucial for scientific success.\nAlso, even with low volumes of social capital Physicists who occupy brokerage\npositions enhance their chances of articles in high impact journals\nsignificantly. Surprisingly, inter(sub)disciplinary collaborations decrease the\nprobability of getting a paper published in specialized journals for almost all\npositions.\n", "  We present the catalogue of the Mg II absorption systems detected at a high\nsignificance level using an automated search algorithm in the spectra of\nquasars from the twelfth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A total\nof 266,433 background quasars were searched for the presence of absorption\nsystems in their spectra. The continuum modelling for the quasar spectra was\nperformed using a mean filter. A pseudo-continuum derived using a median filter\nwas used to trace the emission lines. The absorption system catalogue contains\n39,694 Mg II systems detected at a 6.0, 3.0$\\sigma$ level respectively for the\ntwo lines of the doublet. The catalogue was constrained to an absorption line\nredshift of 0.35 $\\le$ z$_{2796}$ $\\le$ 2.3. The rest-frame equivalent width of\nthe $\\lambda$2796 line ranges between 0.2 $\\le$ W$_r$ $\\le$ 6.2 $\\AA$. Using\nGaussian-noise only simulations we estimate a false positive rate of 7.7 per\ncent in the catalogue. We measured the number density $\\partial\nN^{2796}/\\partial z$ of Mg II absorbers and find evidence for steeper evolution\nof the systems with W$_r \\ge$ 1.2 $\\AA$ at low redshifts (z$_{2796}$ $\\le$\n1.0), consistent with other earlier studies. A suite of null tests over the\nredshift range 0.5 $\\le$ z$_{2796}$ $\\le$ 1.5 was used to study the presence of\nsystematics and selection effects like the dependence of the number density\nevolution of the absorption systems on the properties of the background quasar\nspectra. The null tests do not indicate the presence of any selection effects\nin the absorption catalogue if the quasars with spectral signal-to-noise level\nless than 5.0 are removed. The resultant catalogue contains 36,981 absorption\nsystems. The Mg II absorption catalogue is publicly available and can be\ndownloaded from the link http://srini.ph.unimelb.edu.au/mgii.php\n", "  We report the discovery of 24 spectroscopic binary companions to giant stars.\nWe fully constrain the orbital solution for 6 of these systems. We cannot\nunambiguously derive the orbital elements for the remaining stars because the\nphase coverage is incomplete. Of these stars, 6 present radial velocity trends\nthat are compatible with long-period brown dwarf companions.The orbital\nsolutions of the 24 binary systems indicate that these giant binary systems\nhave a wide range in orbital periods, eccentricities, and companion masses. For\nthe binaries with restricted orbital solutions, we find a range of orbital\nperiods of between $\\sim$ 97-1600 days and eccentricities of between $\\sim$\n0.1-0.4. In addition, we studied the metallicity distribution of single and\nbinary giant stars. We computed the metallicity of a total of 395 evolved\nstars, 59 of wich are in binary systems. We find a flat distribution for these\nbinary stars and therefore conclude that stellar binary systems, and\npotentially brown dwarfs, have a different formation mechanism than\nplanets.This result is confirmed by recent works showing that extrasolar\nplanets orbiting giants are more frequent around metal-rich stars. Finally, we\ninvestigate the eccentricity as a function of the orbital period. We analyzed a\ntotal of 130 spectroscopic binaries, including those presented here and systems\nfrom the literature. We find that most of the binary stars with periods\n$\\lesssim$ 30 days have circular orbits, while at longer orbital periods we\nobserve a wide spread in their eccentricities.\n", "  The present paper is a sequel to our previous work [Y. Ni et al., JCAP 1607,\n049 (2016)] in which we studied the iron K$\\alpha$ line expected in the\nreflection spectrum of Kerr black holes with scalar hair. These metrics are\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a massive, complex scalar\nfield. They form a continuous bridge between a subset of Kerr black holes and a\nfamily of rotating boson stars depending on one extra parameter, the\ndimensionless scalar hair parameter $q$, ranging from 0 (Kerr black holes) to 1\n(boson stars). Here we study the limiting case $q=1$, corresponding to rotating\nboson stars. For comparison, spherical boson stars are also considered. We\nsimulate observations with XIS/Suzaku. Using the fact that current observations\nare well fit by the Kerr solution and thus requiring that acceptable\nalternative compact objects must be compatible with a Kerr fit, we find that\nsome boson star solutions are relatively easy to rule out as potential\ncandidates to explain astrophysical black holes, while other solutions, which\nare neither too dilute nor too compact are more elusive and we argue that they\ncannot be distinguished from Kerr black holes by the analysis of the iron line\nwith current X-ray facilities.\n", "  This paper describes an x-ray microtomographic technique for imaging the\nthree-dimensional structure of the human cerebral cortex. Neurons in the brain\nconstitute a neural circuit as a three-dimensional network. The brain tissue is\ncomposed of light elements that give little contrast in a hard x-ray\ntransmission image. The contrast was enhanced by staining neural cells with\nmetal compounds. The obtained structure revealed the microarchitecture of the\ngray and white matter regions of the frontal cortex, which is responsible for\nthe higher brain functions.\n", "  A microwave cavity is described which can be used to cool lepton plasmas for\npotential use in synthesis of antihydrogen. The cooling scheme is an\nincarnation of the Purcell Effect: when plasmas are coupled to a microwave\ncavity, the plasma cooling rate is resonantly enhanced through increased\nspontaneous emission of cyclotron radiation. The cavity forms a three electrode\nsection of a Penning-Malmberg trap and has a bulged cylindrical geometry with\nopen ends aligned with the magnetic trapping axis. This allows plasmas to be\ninjected and removed from the cavity without the need for moving parts while\nmaintaining high quality factors for resonant modes. The cavity includes unique\nsurface preparations for adjusting the cavity quality factor and achieving\nanti-static shielding using thin layers of nichrome and colloidal graphite\nrespectively. Geometric design considerations for a cavity with strong cooling\npower and low equilibrium plasma temperatures are discussed. Cavities of this\nweak-bulge design will be applicable to many situations where an open geometry\nis required.\n", "  We present an image recovery approach to improve amplitude and phase\nreconstruction from single shot digital holograms, using iterative\nreconstruction with alternating updates. This approach allows the flexibility\nto apply different priors to amplitude and phase, improves phase reconstruction\nin image areas with low amplitudes, and does not require phase unwrapping for\nregularization. Phantom simulations and experimental measurements of a grating\nsample both demonstrate that the proposed method helps to reduce noise and\nresolve finer features. The improved image reconstruction from this technique\nwill benefit the many applications of digital holography.\n", "  The R--matrix method is implemented to study the heavy charm and bottom\ndiquark, triquark, tetraquark and pentaquarks in configuration space, as the\nbound states of quark--antiquark, diquark--quark, diquark--antidiquark and\ndiquark--antitriquark systems, respectively. The mass spectrum and the size of\nthese systems are calculated for different partial wave channels. The\ncalculated masses are compared with recent theoretical results obtained by\nother methods in momentum and configuration spaces and also by available\nexperimental data.\n", "  The family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides, so called MXenes,\nhas recently found new members with ordered double transition metals\nM$'_2$M$\"$C$_2$, where M$'$ and M$\"$ stand for transition metals. Here, using a\nset of first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that some of the newly\nadded members, oxide M$'_2$M$\"$C$_2$ (M$'$= Mo, W; M$\"$= Ti, Zr, Hf) MXenes,\nare topological insulators. The nontrivial topological states of the predicted\nMXenes are revealed by the $Z_2$ index, which is evaluated from the parities of\nthe occupied bands below the Fermi energy at time reversal invariant momenta,\nand also by the presence of the edge states. The predicted M$'_2$M$\"$C$_2$O$_2$\nMXenes show nontrivial gaps in the range of 0.041 -- 0.285 eV within the\ngeneralized gradient approximation and 0.119 -- 0.409 eV within the hybrid\nfunctional. The band gaps are induced by the spin-orbit coupling within the\ndegenerate states with $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ characters of M$'$ and M$\"$,\nwhile the band inversion occurs at the $\\Gamma$ point among the degenerate\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$/$d_{xy}$ orbitals and a non-degenerate $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital,\nwhich is driven by the hybridization of the neighboring orbitals. The phonon\ndispersion calculations find that the predicted topological insulators are\nstructurally stable.\n  The predicted W-based MXenes with large band gaps might be suitable\ncandidates for many topological applications at room temperature. In addition,\nwe study the electronic structures of thicker ordered double transition metals\nM$'_2$M$\"_2$C$_3$O$_2$ (M$'$= Mo, W; M$\"$= Ti, Zr, Hf) and find that they are\nnontrivial topological semimetals.\n", "  We present a search for ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles with the Pierre\nAuger Observatory. Such particles, possibly a relic of phase transitions in the\nearly universe, would deposit a large amount of energy along their path through\nthe atmosphere, comparable to that of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs).\nThe air shower profile of a magnetic monopole can be effectively distinguished\nby the fluorescence detector from that of standard UHECRs. No candidate was\nfound in the data collected between 2004 and 2012, with an expected background\nof less than 0.1 event from UHECRs. The corresponding 90% confidence level\n(C.L.) upper limits on the flux of ultra-relativistic magnetic monopoles range\nfrom $10^{-19}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for a Lorentz factor $\\gamma=10^9$ to\n$2.5 \\times10^{-21}$ (cm$^{2}$ sr s)$^{-1}$ for $\\gamma=10^{12}$. These results\n- the first obtained with a UHECR detector - improve previously published\nlimits by up to an order of magnitude.\n", "  As a part of the ongoing XIIth plan project titled \"R&D activities for high\nenergy proton linac based spallation neutron source\", the work on physics\ndesign of various subsystems of the injector linac and accumulator ring has\nbeen taken up at RRCAT, Indore. For the 1 GeV H- injector linac, physics design\nstudies of individual systems have been completed, and the end to end beam\ndynamics simulation studies have been performed to ensure that the stringent\nbeam dynamics criteria are satisfied for the optimized lattice. Physics design\nstudies to optimize the linear lattice of the accumulator ring have also been\ncompleted. The design studies for the beam transport lines from the injector\nlinac to the accumulator ring, and from the accumulator ring to target are\ncurrently in progress. This report describes the physics design of various\nsystems of the injector linac and the accumulator ring.\n", "  Condensate clouds fundamentally impact the atmospheric structure and spectra\nof exoplanets and brown dwarfs but the connections between surface gravity,\ncloud structure, dust in the upper atmosphere, and the red colors of some brown\ndwarfs remain poorly understood. Rotational modulations enable the study of\ndifferent clouds in the same atmosphere, thereby providing a method to isolate\nthe effects of clouds. Here we present the discovery of high peak-to-peak\namplitude (8%) rotational modulations in a low-gravity, extremely red\n(J-Ks=2.55) L6 dwarf WISEP J004701.06+680352.1 (W0047). Using the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) time-resolved grism spectroscopy we find a best-fit rotational\nperiod (13.20$\\pm$0.14 hours) with a larger amplitude at 1.1 micron than at 1.7\nmicron. This is the third largest near-infrared variability amplitude measured\nin a brown dwarf, demonstrating that large-amplitude variations are not limited\nto the L/T transition but are present in some extremely red L-type dwarfs. We\nreport a tentative trend between the wavelength dependence of relative\namplitude, possibly proxy for small dust grains lofted in the upper atmosphere,\nand the likelihood of large-amplitude variability. By assuming forsterite as\nhaze particle, we successfully explain the wavelength dependent amplitude with\nsubmicron-sized haze particles sizes of around 0.4 {\\mu}m. W0047 links the\nearlier spectral and later spectral type brown dwarfs in which rotational\nmodulations have been observed, the large amplitude variations in this object\nmake this a benchmark brown dwarf for the study of cloud properties close to\nthe L/T transition.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms\nwith the same acceleration perpendicular to their separation. The two-atom\nsystem is treated as an open system coupled with fluctuating electromagnetic\nfields in the Minkowski vacuum, and in the Born-Markov approximation the master\nequation that describes the completely positive time evolution of the two-atom\nsystem is derived. In particular, we investigate the phenomena of entanglement\ndegradation, generation, revival and enhancement. As opposed to the\nscalar-field case, the entanglement dynamics is crucially dependent on the\npolarization directions of the atoms. For the two-atom system with certain\nacceleration and separation, the polarization directions of the atoms may\ndetermine whether entanglement generation, revival or enhancement happens,\nwhile for entanglement degradation, they affect the decay rate of entanglement.\nA comparison between the entanglement evolution of accelerated atoms and that\nof static ones immersed in a thermal bath at the Unruh temperature shows that\nthey are the same only when the acceleration is extremely small.\n", "  This paper provides results for the ground state and excited spectra of\nthree-flavored doubly heavy baryons, $bcn$ and $bcs$. We take advantage of the\nspin-independent interaction recently obtained to reconcile the lattice SU(3)\nQCD static potential and the results of nonperturbative lattice QCD for the\ntriply heavy baryon spectra. We show that the spin-dependent potential might be\nconstrained on the basis of nonperturbative lattice QCD results for the spin\nsplittings of three-flavored doubly heavy baryons. Our results may also\nrepresent a challenge for future lattice QCD work, because a smaller lattice\nerror could help in distinguishing between different prescriptions for the\nspin-dependent part of the interaction. Thus, by comparing with the reported\nbaryon spectra obtained with parameters estimated from lattice QCD, one can\nchallenge the precision of lattice calculations. The present work supports a\ncoherent description of singly, doubly and triply heavy baryons with the same\nCornell-like interacting potential. The possible experimental measurement of\nthese states at LHCb is an incentive for this study.\n", "  We study the 3-d Bohmian trajectories of a quantum system of three harmonic\noscillators. We focus on the mechanism responsible for the generation of\nchaotic trajectories. We demonstrate the existence of a 3-d analogue of the\nmechanism found in earlier studies of 2-d systems, based on moving 2-d `nodal\npoint - X-point complexes'. In the 3-d case, we observe a foliation of nodal\npoint - X-point complexes, forming a `3-d structure of nodal and X-points'.\nChaos is generated when the Bohmian trajectories are scattered at one or more\nclose encounters with such a structure.\n", "  In times of plenty expectations rise, just as in times of crisis they fall.\nThis can be mathematically described as a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift strategy with\ndynamic aspiration levels, where individuals aspire to be as wealthy as their\naverage neighbor. Here we investigate this model in the realm of evolutionary\nsocial dilemmas on the square lattice and scale-free networks. By using the\nmaster equation and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that cooperators coexist\nwith defectors in the whole phase diagram, even at high temptations to defect.\nWe study the microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the striking\npersistence of cooperative behavior and find that cooperation spreads through\nsecond-order neighbors, rather than by means of network reciprocity that\ndominates in imitation-based models. For the square lattice the master equation\ncan be solved analytically in the large temperature limit of the Fermi\nfunction, while for other cases the resulting differential equations must be\nsolved numerically. Either way, we find good qualitative agreement with the\nMonte Carlo simulation results. Our analysis also reveals that the evolutionary\noutcomes are to a large degree independent of the network topology, including\nthe number of neighbors that are considered for payoff determination on\nlattices, which further corroborates the local character of the microscopic\ndynamics. Unlike large-scale spatial patterns that typically emerge due to\nnetwork reciprocity, here local checkerboard-like patterns remain virtually\nunaffected by differences in the macroscopic properties of the interaction\nnetwork.\n", "  A common way of classifying network connectivity is the association of the\nnodal degree distribution to specific probability distribution models. During\nthe last decades, researchers classified many networks using the Poisson or\nPareto distributions. Urban infrastructures, like transportation (railways,\nroads, etc.) and distribution (gas, water, energy, etc.) systems, are peculiar\nnetworks strongly constrained by spatial characteristics of the environment\nwhere they are constructed. Consequently, the nodal degree of such networks\nspans very small ranges not allowing a reliable classification using the nodal\ndegree distribution. In order to overcome this problem, we here (i) define the\nneighborhood degree, equal to the sum of the nodal degrees of the nearest\ntopological neighbors, the adjacent nodes and (ii) propose to use neighborhood\ndegree to classify infrastructure networks. Such neighborhood degree spans a\nwider range of degrees than the standard one allowing inferring the\nprobabilistic model in a more reliable way, from a statistical standpoint. In\norder to test our proposal, we here analyze twenty-two real water distribution\nnetworks, built in different environments, demonstrating that the Poisson\ndistribution generally models very well their neighborhood degree\ndistributions. This result seems consistent with the less reliable\nclassification achievable with the scarce information using the standard nodal\ndegree distribution.\n", "  The problem of renormalization in perturbative quantum field theory (pQFT)\ncan be described in a rigorous way through the theory of extension of\ndistributions. In the framework of pQFT a certain type of distribution appears,\ngiven by products of Green functions which act by integration with a test\nfunction. They present ultraviolet divergences, whenever any pair of arguments\ncoincide on one point of spacetime, and therefore, they are not defined\neverywhere. In this work we have studied the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the extension (or regularization) of this type of distribution.\nMoreover, we have constructed such extensions explicitly, satisfying a series\nof physically relevant axioms, such as the axiom of causality.\n", "  We discuss the partition function of a single M5-brane on a circle with\ntransverse orbifold of ADE type and show that the modes captured by the\npartition function are those of the tensor multiplet and the thee form field.\nWe show that the bound states of M-strings corresponding to pair of simple\nroots appear, for all ADE, only when the momentum on the circle is turned on.\n", "  We report a simultaneous ground and space-based photometric study of the Beta\nCephei star Nu Eridani. Half a year of observations have been obtained by four\nof the five satellites constituting BRITE-Constellation, supplemented with\nground-based photoelectric photometry. We show that carefully combining the two\ndata sets virtually eliminates the aliasing problem that often hampers\ntime-series analyses. We detect 40 periodic signals intrinsic to the star in\nthe light curves. Despite a lower detection limit we do not recover all the\npressure and mixed modes previously reported in the literature, but we newly\ndetect six additional gravity modes. This behaviour is a consequence of\ntemporal changes in the pulsation amplitudes that we also detected for some of\nthe p modes. We point out that the dependence of theoretically predicted\npulsation amplitude on wavelength is steeper in visual passbands than those\nobservationally measured, to the extent that the three dominant pulsation modes\nof Nu Eridani would be incorrectly identified using data in optical filters\nonly. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n", "  This book chapter, Saturn's Polar Atmosphere, is to be published by Cambridge\nUniversity Press as part of a multi-volume work edited by Kevin Baines, Michael\nFlasar, Norbert Krupp, and Thomas Stallard, entitled \"Saturn in the 21st\nCentury.\" This chapter reviews the state of our knowledge about Saturn's polar\natmosphere that has been revealed through Earth- and space-based observation as\nwell as theoretical and numerical modeling. In particular, the Cassini mission\nto Saturn, which has been in orbit around the ringed planet since 2004, has\nrevolutionized our understanding of the planet. The current review updates a\nprevious review by Del Genio et al (2009; Saturn Atmospheric Structure and\nDynamics, Chapter 7 of \"Saturn from Cassini-Huygens\"), written after Cassini's\nprimary mission phase that ended in 2008, by focusing on the north polar region\nof Saturn and comparing it to the southern high latitudes. Two prominent\nfeatures in the northern high latitudes are the northern hexagon and the north\npolar vortex; we extensively review observational and theoretical\ninvestigations to date of both features. We also review the seasonal evolution\nof the polar regions using the observational data accumulated during the\nCassini mission since 2004 (shortly after the northern winter solstice in\n2002), through the equinox in 2009, and approaching the next solstice in 2017.\nWe conclude the current review by listing unanswered questions and describing\nthe observations of the polar regions planned for the Grand Finale phase of the\nCassini mission between 2016 and 2017.\n", "  We present an efficient and robust numerical model for simulation of\nelectrokinetic phenomena in porous networks over a wide range of applications\nincluding energy conversion, desalination, and lab-on-a-chip systems. Coupling\nbetween fluid flow and ion transport in these networks is governed by the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations. These equations describe a wide range\nof transport phenomena that can interact in complex and highly nonlinear ways\nin networks involving multiple pores with variable properties. Capturing these\nphenomena by direct simulation of the governing equations in multiple\ndimensions is prohibitively expensive. We present here a reduced order\ncomputational model that treats a network of many pores via solutions to 1D\nequations. Assuming that each pore in the network is long and thin, we derive a\n1D model describing the transport in pore's longitudinal direction. We take\ninto account the non-uniformity of potential and ion concentration profiles\nacross the pore cross-section in the form of area-averaged coefficients in\ndifferent flux terms representing fluid flow, electric current, and ion fluxes.\nDistinct advantages of the present framework include: a fully conservative\ndiscretization, fully bounded tabulated area-averaged coefficients without any\nsingularity in the limit of infinitely thick electric double layers (EDLs), a\nflux discretization that exactly preserves equilibrium conditions, and\nextension to general network of pores with multiple intersections. By\nconsidering a hierarchy of canonical problems with increasing complexity, we\ndemonstrate that the developed framework can capture a wide range of phenomena.\nExample demonstrations include, prediction of osmotic pressure built up in thin\npores subject to concentration gradient, propagation of deionization shocks and\ninduced recirculations for intersecting pores with varying properties.\n", "  We develop a new iterative method for finding approximate solutions for\nspherical bounces associated with the decay of the false vacuum in scalar field\ntheories. The method works for any generic potential in any number of\ndimensions, contains Coleman's thin-wall approximation as its first iteration,\nand greatly improves its accuracy by including higher order terms.\n", "  Sr$_{3}$ZnIrO$_{6}$ is an effective spin one-half Mott insulating iridate\nbelonging to a family of magnets which includes a number of quasi-one\ndimensional systems as well as materials exhibiting three dimensional order.\nHere we present the results of an extensive investigation into the magnetism\nincluding heat capacity, a.c. susceptibility, muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR),\nneutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering on the same sample. It is\nestablished that the material exhibits a transition at about $17$ K into a\nthree-dimensional antiferromagnetic structure with propagation vector\n$\\boldsymbol{k}=(0,\\frac{1}{2},1)$ in the hexagonal setting of R$\\bar{3}$c and\nnon-collinear moments of $0.87$$\\mu_B$ on Ir$^{4+}$ ions. Further we have\nobserved a well defined powder averaged spin wave spectrum with zone boundary\nenergy of $\\sim 5$ meV at $5$ K. We stress that a theoretical analysis shows\nthat the observed non-collinear magnetic structure arises from anisotropic\ninter- and intra- chain exchange which has its origin in significant spin-orbit\ncoupling. The model can satisfactorily explain the observed spin wave\nexcitations.\n", "  Boundary-engineering in nanostructures has the potential to dramatically\nimpact the development of materials for high-efficiency conversion of thermal\nenergy directly into electricity. In particular, nanostructuring of\nsemiconductors can lead to strong suppression of heat transport with little\ndegradation of electrical conductivity. Although this combination of material\nproperties is promising for thermoelectric materials, it remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel concept, the directional phonon\nsuppression function, to unravel boundary-dominated heat transport in\nunprecedented detail. Using a combination of density functional theory and the\nBoltzmann transport equation, we compute this quantity for nanoporous silicon\nmaterials. We first compute the thermal conductivity for the case with aligned\ncircular pores, confirming a significant thermal transport degradation with\nrespect to the bulk. Then, by analyzing the information on the directionality\nof phonon suppression in this system, we identify a new structure of\nrectangular pores with the same porosity that enables a four-fold decrease in\nthermal transport with respect to the circular pores. Our results illustrate\nthe utility of the directional phonon suppression function, enabling new\navenues for systematic thermal conductivity minimization and potentially\naccelerating the engineering of next-generation thermoelectric devices.\n", "  Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides such as WSe2 have become\nincreasingly attractive due to their potential in electrical and optical\napplications. Because the properties of these 2D systems are known to be\naffected by their surroundings, we report how the choice of the substrate\nmaterial affects the optical properties of monolayer WSe2. To accomplish this\nstudy, pump-density-dependent micro-photoluminescence measurements are\nperformed with time-integrating and time-resolving acquisition techniques.\nSpectral information and power-dependent mode intensities are compared at 290K\nand 10K for exfoliated WSe2 on SiO2/Si, sapphire (Al2O3), hBN/Si3N4/Si, and\nMgF2, indicating substrate-dependent appearance and strength of exciton, trion,\nand biexciton modes. Additionally, one CVD-grown WSe2 monolayer on sapphire is\nincluded in this study for direct comparison with its exfoliated counterpart.\nTime-resolved micro-photoluminescence shows how radiative decay times strongly\ndiffer for different substrate materials. Our data indicates exciton-exciton\nannihilation as a shortening mechanism at room temperature, and subtle trends\nin the decay rates in correlation to the dielectric environment at cryogenic\ntemperatures. On the measureable time scales, trends are also related to the\nextent of the respective 2D-excitonic modes' appearance. This result highlights\nthe importance of further detailed characterization of exciton features in 2D\nmaterials, particularly with respect to the choice of substrate.\n", "  A finite element formulation is developed for a poroelastic medium consisting\nof an incompressible hyperelastic skeleton saturated by an incompressible\nfluid. The governing equations stem from mixture theory and the application is\nmotivated by the study of interstitial fluid flow in brain tissue. The\nformulation is based on the adoption of an ALE perspective. We focus on a flow\nregime in which inertia forces are negligible. The stability and convergence of\nthe formulation is discussed, and numerical results demonstrate agreement with\nthe theory.\n", "  Using the information content of correlations between multipartite systems,\ntogether with the notion of partitioning, we show that some general results\nabout the evolution of correlations in quantum systems can be derived with only\nelementary methods. In particular, we show that for 2 quantum systems A and B,\neach comprised of a number of sub-systems, in which a partition of A interacts\nunitarily with a partition of B, then the total correlation can only increase\n(or remain unchanged) and is given simply by the sum of the initial correlation\nand the correlation that develops as a result of the interaction. We then show\nthat in a 4 qubit entanglement swapping process the transferred degree of\nentanglement is bounded by the lower of the initial degrees of entanglements of\nthe qubits.\n", "  The mutual information has been successfully used as a measure of correlation\nstrength between quantum systems, especially for bipartite systems. Here we\nexamine the use of this measure for multipartite quantum systems. For system of\nqubits we find that the difference between `classical' and `quantum' regimes of\ncorrelation strength amounts to just 1 bit of information, at most. We show\nthat the information content of a correlation can be expanded into correlations\nbetween pairwise components and demonstrate that in terms of this\ninformation-based measure of correlation the GHZ states are the only states\nthat simultaneously optimize these pairwise correlations for systems of qubits.\n", "  We present the current-density functional theory for the superconductor\nimmersed in the magnetic field. The order parameter of the superconducting\nstate, transverse component of the paramagnetic current-density, and electron\ndensity are chosen as basic variables that uniquely determine the equilibrium\nproperties of the system. In order to construct this theory, the development of\nthe approximate form of the exchange-correlation (xc) energy functional is\nindispensable as well as the derivation of the effective single-particle\nequation which makes it possible to reproduce the equilibrium densities\nmentioned above. The rigorous expression of the xc-energy functional is derived\nusing the technique of the coupling-constant integration. Furthermore, the\napproximate form of the xc energy functional is proposed such that the energy\ngap resulting from the effective single-particle equation is consistent with\nthe attractive interaction energy of the system.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework to analyze the violation of\nfluctuation-response relation (FRR) for any observable from a finite Markov\nsystem with two well-separated time scales. We find that, generally for both\nslow and fast observables, a broad plateau exists in the intermediate frequency\nregion, which contributes to a finite hidden entropy production. Assuming that\nnon-equilibrium behavior arises only from coupling of slow and fast processes,\nwe find that, at large observation time scae, the effective temperature for a\nslow observable deviates only slightly from the bath temperature, accompanied\nby an emerging well-defined effective potential landscape, while the deviation\nis significant for a fast observable. Our study also identifies a wider range\nof applicability of the Harada-Sasa equality in Markov jumping systems.\n", "  Einstein was deeply puzzled by the success of natural science, and thought\nthat we would never be able to explain it. He came to this conclusion on the\nground that we cannot extract the basic laws of physics from experience using\ninduction or deduction, and he took this to mean that they cannot be arrived at\nin a logical manner at all. In this paper I use Charles Peirce's logic of\nabduction, a third mode of reasoning different from deduction and induction,\nand show that it can be used to explain how laws in physics are arrived at,\nthereby addressing Einstein's puzzle about the incomprehensible\ncomprehensibility of the universe. Interpreting Einstein's reflections in terms\nof Peirce's abduction also sheds light on abduction itself, by seeing it\napplied in an area where our common sense, and with that our intuitions, give\nus little or no guidance, and is even prone to lead us astray.\n", "  We undertake an investigation of combinatorial designs engendered by cellular\nautomata (CA), focusing in particular on orthogonal Latin squares and\northogonal arrays. The motivation is of cryptographic nature. Indeed, we\nconsider the problem of employing CA to define threshold secret sharing schemes\nvia orthogonal Latin squares. We first show how to generate Latin squares\nthrough bipermutive CA. Then, using a characterization based on Sylvester\nmatrices, we prove that two linear CA induce a pair of orthogonal Latin squares\nif and only if the polynomials associated to their local rules are relatively\nprime.\n", "  In 1760 James Macpherson published the first volume of a series of epic poems\nwhich he claimed to have translated into English from ancient Scottish-Gaelic\nsources. The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century\nbard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited\ncomparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and\nOdyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in\nliterature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous\nliterary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to\nthis day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while\nothers protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological\nsources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian,\ninitiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the\ntwo-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the\npoems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of\nview. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described\nin the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources.\nDespite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric\nepics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant\nnetwork-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer.\nThey also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the\nnarratives known as Acallam na Sen\\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the\nFenian Cycle of Irish mythology.\n", "  This thesis begins with an introduction to the state of the art of modern\nCosmology. The field of Particle Cosmology is then introduced and explored, in\nparticular with regard to the study of cosmological inflation. We then\nintroduce a new model of Thermal Inflation, in which the mass of the thermal\nwaterfall field responsible for the inflation is dependent on a light spectator\nscalar field. The model contains a variety of free parameters, two of which\ncontrol the power of the coupling term and the non-renormalizable term. We use\nthe $\\delta N$ formalism to investigate the \"end of inflation\" and modulated\ndecay scenarios in turn to see whether they are able to produce the dominant\ncontribution to the primordial curvature perturbation $\\zeta$. We constrain the\nmodel and then explore the parameter space. We explore key observational\nsignatures, such as non-Gaussianity, the scalar spectral index and the running\nof the scalar spectral index. We find that for some regions of the parameter\nspace, the ability of the model to produce the dominant contribution to $\\zeta$\nis excluded. However, for other regions of the parameter space, we find that\nthe model yields a sharp prediction for a variety of parameters within the\nmodel.\n", "  A crucial requirement for the realisation of efficient and scalable on-chip\nquantum communication is an ultrafast polarised single photon source operating\nbeyond the Peltier cooling barrier of 200 K. While a few systems based on\ndifferent materials and device structures have achieved single photon\ngeneration above this threshold, there has been no report of single quantum\nemitters with deterministic polarisation properties at the same high\ntemperature conditions. Here, we report the first device to simultaneously\nachieve single photon emission with a g(2)(0) of only 0.21, a high polarisation\ndegree of 0.80, a fixed polarisation axis determined by the underlying\ncrystallography, and a GHz repetition rate with a radiative lifetime of 357 ps\nat 220 K. The temperature insensitivity of these properties, together with the\nsimple planar growth method, and absence of complex device geometries, makes\nthis system an excellent candidate for on-chip applications in integrated\nsystems.\n", "  Many seemingly intractable systems can be reduced to a system of interacting\nspins. Here, we introduce a system of artificial acoustic spins which are\nmanipulated with ultrasound excitations associated with micro-cracking sources\nin thin sheets of crystals. Our spin-like system shows a peculiar relaxation\nmechanism after inducing an impulsive stress-ramp akin to splitting, or\nrupturing, of the system. Using real-time construction of correlations between\nspins states, we observe a clear emergence of the light cone effect. It has\nbeen proposed that equilibration horizon occurs on a local scale in systems\nwhere correlations between distant sites are established at a finite speed. The\nobserved equilibration horizon in our observations defines a region where\nelements of the material are in elastic communication through excited\nelementary excitations. These results yield important insights into dynamic\ncommunication between failing elements in brittle materials during processes\nsuch as brittle fragmentation and dynamic stress triggering of\nearthquake-generating faults.\n", "  The nonlocal dispersive optical model (NLDOM) nucleon potentials are used for\nthe first time in the adiabatic analysis of a (d,p) reaction to generate\ndistorted waves both in the entrance and exit channels. These potentials were\ndesigned and fitted by Mahzoon $et \\text{ } al.$ [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 162502\n(2014)] to constrain relevant single-particle physics in a consistent way by\nimposing the fundamental properties, such as nonlocality, energy-dependence and\ndispersive relations, that follow from the complex nature of nuclei. However,\nthe NLDOM prediction for the $^{40}$Ca(d,p)$^{41}$Ca cross sections at low\nenergy, typical for some modern radioactive beam ISOL facilities, is about\n70$\\%$ higher than the experimental data despite being reduced by the NLDOM\nspectroscopic factor of 0.73. This overestimation comes most likely either from\ninsufficient absorption or due to constructive interference between ingoing and\noutgoing waves. This indicates strongly that additional physics arising from\nmany-body effects is missing in the widely used current versions of (d,p)\nreaction theories.\n", "  The presence of membrane tubules in living cells is essential to many\nbiological processes. In cells, one mechanism to form nanosized lipid tubules\nis via molecular motor induced bilayer extraction. In this paper, we describe a\nsimple experimental model to investigate the forces required for lipid tube\nformation using kinesin motors anchored to DOPC vesicles. Previous related\nstudies have used molecular motors actively pulling on the membrane to extract\na nanotube. Here, we invert the system geometry; molecular motors are used as\nstatic anchors linking DOPC vesicles to a two-dimensional microtubule network\nand an external flow is introduced to generate nanotubes facilitated by the\ndrag force. We found that a drag force of ~7 pN was sufficient for tubule\nextraction for vesicles ranging from 1 to 2 um in radius. By our method, we\nfound that the force generated by a single molecular motor was sufficient for\nmembrane tubule extraction from a spherical lipid vesicle.\n", "  Manipulating the polarisation of light is crucial for sensing and imaging\napplications. One such aspect in particular is selective transmission of one\ncircular polarisation (spin) when light is transmitted through a medium or a\ndevice. However, most present methods of achieving this have relatively low\nefficiency and selectivity, whilst high selectivity examples rely on lossy and\ncomplex three-dimensional helical or multilayer structures. Here, we propose a\ndielectric metamaterial approach for achieving spin-selective transmission of\nelectromagnetic waves, utilizing spin-controlled constructive or destructive\ninterference between two Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phases in conjunction with\npropagative dynamic phase. The dielectric metamaterial, consisting of\nmonolithic silicon herringbone structures, exhibits a broadband operation in\nthe terahertz regime whilst obtaining a spin-selective efficiency upwards of\n60%. Such a device is robust and is not easily degraded by errors in\nfabrication.\n", "  Focusing of electron waves in graphene p-n junctions is a striking\nmanifestation of fermionic negative refraction. We analyze lensing in smooth\np-n junctions and find that it differs in several interesting ways from that in\nthe previously studied sharp p-n junctions. Most importantly, while the overall\nnegative-refraction behavior remains unchanged, the image at the focal point\nundergoes additional broadening due to Klein tunneling in the junction. We\ndevelop a theory of image broadening and estimate the effect for practically\ninteresting system parameter values.\n", "  Techniques in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy have\nfacilitated a number of recent advances in the study of quantum materials. We\nreview developments in this field related to the study of incoherent\nnonequilibrium electron dynamics, the analysis of interactions between\nelectrons and collective excitations, the exploration of dressed-state physics,\nand the illumination of unoccupied band structure. Future prospects are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Thermoacoustic Refrigerators use acoustic power for generating cold\ntemperatures. Development of refrigerators based on the thermoacoustic\ntechnology is a novel solution to the present day need of cooling, without\ncausing environmental hazards. With added advantages such as minimal moving\nparts and absence of CFC refrigerants, these devices can attain low\ntemperatures maintaining a compact size. The present work describes an in-depth\ntheoretical analysis of standing wave thermoacoustic refrigerators. This\nconsists of detailed parametric studies, transient state analysis, and a design\nusing an available simulation software. Design and construction of a\nthermoacoustic refrigerator using a commercially available electro-dynamic\nmotor is also presented.\n", "  We propose an experimental scheme to determine the spin-transfer torque\nefficiency excited by the spin-orbit interaction in ferromagnetic bilayers from\nthe measurement of the longitudinal magnetoresistace. Solving a diffusive\nspin-transport theory with appropriate boundary conditions gives an analytical\nformula of the longitudinal charge current density. The longitudinal charge\ncurrent has a term that is proportional to the square of the spin-transfer\ntorque efficiency and that also depends on the ratio of the film thickness to\nthe spin diffusion length of the ferromagnet. Extracting this contribution from\nmeasurements of the longitudinal resistivity as a function of the thickness can\ngive the spin-transfer torque efficiency.\n", "  Doping has been used to enhance the ionization efficiency of analytes in\natmospheric pressure photoionization, which is based on charge exchange.\nCompounds with excellent ionization efficiencies are usually chosen as dopants.\nIn this paper, we report a new phenomenon observed in low-pressure\nphotoionization: Protonation enhancement by dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) doping.\nCH2Cl2 is not a common dopant due to its high ionization energy (11.33 eV). The\nlow-pressure photoionization source was built using a krypton VUV lamp that\nemits photons with energies of 10.0 and 10.6 eV and was operated at 500-1000\nPa. Protonation of water, methanol, ethanol, and acetaldehyde was respectively\nenhanced by 481.7 +/- 122.4, 197.8 +/- 18.8, 87.3 +/- 7.8, and 93.5 +/- 35.5\ntimes after doping 291 ppmv CH2Cl2, meanwhile CH2Cl2 almost does not generate\nnoticeable ions itself. This phenomenon has not been documented in the\nliterature. A new protonation process involving in ion-pair and H-bond\nformations was proposed to expound the phenomenon. The observed phenomenon\nopens a new prospect for the improvement of the detection efficiency of VUV\nphotoionization.\n", "  We observe a series of sharp resonant features in the tunnelling differential\nconductance of InAs quantum dots. We found that dissipative quantum tunnelling\nhas a strong influence on the operation of nano-devices. Because of such\ntunnelling the current-voltage characteristics of tunnel contact created\nbetween atomic force microscope tip and a surface of InAs/GaAs quantum dots\ndisplay many interesting peaks. We found that the number, position, and heights\nof these peaks are associated with the phonon modes involved. To describe the\nfound effect we use a quasi-classical approximation. There the tunnelling\ncurrent is related to a creation of a dilute instanton-anti-instanton gas. Our\nexperimental data are well described with exactly solvable model where one\ncharged particle is weakly interacting with two promoting phonon modes\nassociated with external medium. We conclude that the characteristics of the\ntunnel nanoelectronic devices can thus be controlled by a proper choice of\nphonons existing in materials, which are involved.\n", "  Seismology represents a unique method to probe the interiors of giant\nplanets. Recently, Saturn's f-modes have been indirectly observed in its rings,\nand there is strong evidence for the detection of Jupiter global modes by means\nof ground-based, spatially-resolved, velocimetry measurements. We propose to\nexploit Juno's extremely accurate radio science data by looking at the gravity\nperturbations that Jupiter's acoustic modes would produce. We evaluate the\nperturbation to Jupiter's gravitational field using the oscillation spectrum of\na polytrope with index 1 and the corresponding radial eigenfunctions. We show\nthat Juno will be most sensitive to the fundamental mode ($n=0$), unless its\namplitude is smaller than 0.5 cm/s, i.e. 100 times weaker than the $n \\sim\\ 4 -\n11$ modes detected by spatially-resolved velocimetry. The oscillations yield\ncontributions to Juno's measured gravitational coefficients similar to or\nlarger than those expected from shallow zonal winds (extending to depths less\nthan 300 km). In the case of a strong f-mode (radial velocity $\\sim$ 30 cm/s),\nthese contributions would become of the same order as those expected from deep\nzonal winds (extending to 3000 km), especially on the low degree zonal\nharmonics, therefore requiring a new approach to the analysis of Juno data.\n", "  We have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed\nTelescope, of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. The main aim was to identify\nstars in the very final stage of their evolution, and for which the luminosity\nis more directly related to the birth mass than the more numerous less--evolved\ngiant stars that continue to increase in luminosity. In first instance, only\nthe central square kiloparsec were monitored and analysed, with the UIST\ncamera. Photometry was obtained for 18,398 stars; of these 812 stars were found\nto be variable, most of which are asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We\nconstructed the birth mass function and hence derived the star formation\nhistory. These stars are also important dust factories. We measure their dust\nproduction rates from a combination of our data with Spitzer Space Telescope\nmid-IR photometry. The mass loss rates are seen to increase with increasing\nstrength of pulsation and with increasing bolometric luminosity. We construct a\n2D map of the mass return rate, showing a radial decline but also local\nenhancements due to the concentration of red supergiants. We conclude that star\nformation in the central region of M33 can only be sustained if gas is accreted\nfrom further out in the disc or from circum--galactic regions. By using data of\nwide-field camera (WFCAM), the campaign was expanded to cover two orders of\nmagnitude larger area, comprising the disc of M33 and its spiral arms.\nPhotometry was obtained for 403,734 stars; of these 4643 stars were found to be\nvariable. We here present the star formation history across the disc of M33.\n", "  The Sonneberg Sky Patrol archive so far has not yet been analyzed\nsystematically. In this paper we present first steps towards an automated\nphotometric analysis aiming at the search for variable stars and transient\nphenomena like novae. Early works on the sky patrol plates showed that\nphotometric accuracy can be enhanced with fitting algorithms. The procedure\nused was a manually supported click-and-fit-routine, not suitable for automatic\nanalysis of vast amount of photographic plates. We will present our progress on\ndeconvolution of overlapping sources on the plates and compare photometric\nanalysis using different methods. Our goal is to get light curves of sufficient\nquality from sky patrol plates, which can be classified with machine learning\nalgorithms. The development of an automated scheme for finding transient events\nis in progress and the first results are very promising.\n", "  Applied optics was one of the major topics Hans Walter was engaged in during\nhis scientific life. He contributed to the understanding of optical properties\nof thin films, which could be used to design coating layers to improve the\nproperties of optical and other surfaces. He developed the theoretical\ndescription of the basic principles of phase-contrast, schlieren and\ninterference optics applied to enhance low contrast details and to increase the\nresolution in studies of biological samples. And last, but not least, Hans\nWolter proposed an optical system of two grazing--incidence mirrors for use in\nan X--ray imaging microscope. A microscope using such an optics never was put\ninto practice, but the optical design turned out to be well suited for\ntelescopes.\n", "  Graphene like 2D materials have attracted tremendous attention in the field\nof photocatalytic water splitting. Indium Selenide (InSe) is one such potential\nmaterial. Here, we report the effect of Tellurium on InSe monolayer for the\nphotocatalytic water splitting by means of density functional calculations. The\ncalculated bandgaps fall within the visible region of the solar spectrum\nindicating these materials could absorb a significant amount of solar light.\nDensity of states calculations show that the covalent character is present\nbetween the atoms which is typical for the layered system. The band alignment\nwith respect to redox potentials show that Te doped InSe is more favorable for\nthe hydrogen reduction reaction than the pristine InSe monolayer. Our overall\nresults show that Te substitution improves the photocatalytic water splitting\nability in InSe monolayer.\n", "  Optics for future X-ray telescopes will be characterized by very large\naperture and focal length, and will be made of lightweight materials like glass\nor silicon in order to keep the total mass within acceptable limits. Optical\nmodules based on thin slumped glass foils are being developed at various\ninstitutes, aiming at improving the angular resolution to a few arcsec HEW.\nThin mirrors are prone to deform, so they require a careful integration to\navoid deformations and even correct forming errors. On the other hand, this\noffers the opportunity to actively correct the residual deformation: a viable\npossibility to improve the mirror figure is the application of piezoelectric\nactuators onto the non-optical side of the mirrors, and several groups are\nalready at work on this approach. The concept we are developing consists of\nactively integrating thin glass foils with piezoelectric patches, fed by\nvoltages driven by the feedback provided by X-rays. The actuators are\ncommercial components, while the tension signals are carried by a printed\ncircuit obtained by photolithography, and the driving electronic is a\nmulti-channel low power consumption voltage supply developed in-house. Finally,\nthe shape detection and the consequent voltage signal to be provided to the\npiezoelectric array are determined in X-rays, in intra-focal setup at the XACT\nfacility at INAF/OAPA. In this work, we describe the manufacturing steps to\nobtain a first active mirror prototype and the very first test performed in\nX-rays.\n", "  If above a critical temperature not only the SU(N_F)_L \\times SU(N_F)_R\nchiral symmetry of QCD but also the U(1)_A symmetry is restored, then the\nactual symmetry of the QCD correlation functions and observables is SU(2N_F).\nSuch a symmetry prohibits existence of deconfined quarks and gluons. Hence QCD\nat high temperature is also in the confining regime and elementary objects are\nSU(2N_F) symmetric \"hadrons\" with not yet known properties.\n", "  In numerous diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS) systems, the competition\ntakes place between the short-range antiferromagnetic (AF) superexchange\ninteractions and the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling\nmediated by the charge carriers. Such a situation strongly influences the\ncritical temperature, the maximization of which constitutes a challenging task\nin DMS physics and technology. The aim of the paper is to discuss theoretically\nthe limiting effect of AF interactions between nearest-neighbour magnetic ions\non the stability of inhomogeneous ferromagnetic state in a model diluted\nmagnetic system reflecting some crucial features of DMS.\n  The modified molecular field-based model is constructed to account for the\nmagnetic inhomogeneity. The behavior of the system is studied as a function of\nthe ratio of superexchange integral to effective ferromagnetic coupling\nintegral, including the possibility of clustering/anticlustering tendency for\nthe magnetic ions. The ground state of the system is analysed. The critical\ntemperature is found to change non-monotonically with the concentration of\nmagnetic ions and decrease severely for larger concentrations. The behavior of\nthe system significantly differs from the predictions of the usual homogeneous\nmean-field model. Brief comparison with selected experimental results for\n(Zn,Mn)Te is provided.\n", "  To reduce the potential radiation risk, low-dose CT has attracted much\nattention. However, simply lowering the radiation dose will lead to significant\ndeterioration of the image quality. In this paper, we propose a noise reduction\nmethod for low-dose CT via deep neural network without accessing original\nprojection data. A deep convolutional neural network is trained to transform\nlow-dose CT images towards normal-dose CT images, patch by patch. Visual and\nquantitative evaluation demonstrates a competing performance of the proposed\nmethod.\n", "  We study the (in)stability around the dynamical gap solution of the $U(N)$\nChern-Simons gauge theory with fundamental fermions (massless or massive)\ncoupled in $D=3$ at large $N$. Explicit analyses on both the Auxiliary-Field\n(AF) and the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis (CJT) effective potentials are given. In\nboth approaches we manage to analytically identify the saddle-point instability\naround the gap solution. We also give a comparison with the QCD-like theories.\nThis study can help understanding the scale symmetry breaking picture of this\ntheory.\n", "  We study two-dimensional rotation-symmetric number-conserving cellular\nautomata working on the von Neumann neighborhood (RNCA). It is known that such\nautomata with 4 states or less are trivial, so we investigate the possible\nrules with 5 states. We give a full characterization of these automata and show\nthat they cannot be strongly Turing universal. However, we give example of\nconstructions that allow to embed some boolean circuit elements in a 5-states\nRNCA.\n", "  Linear acceleration theorems are known for most computational models.\nAlthough such results have been proved for two-dimensional cellular automata\nworking on specific neighborhoods, no general construction was known. We\npresent here a technique of linear acceleration for all two-dimensional\nlanguages recognized by cellular automata working on complete neighborhoods.\n", "  We study the indirect exchange interaction between two localized magnetic\nmoments, known as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, in a\none-dimensional spin-polarized electron gas. We find explicit expressions for\neach term of this interaction, study their oscillatory behaviors as a function\nof the distance between two magnetic moments, $R$, and compare them with the\nknown results for RKKY interaction in the case of one-dimensional standard\nelectron gas. We show this interaction can be written in an anisotropic\nHeisenberg form, $E(\\vec\nR)=\\lambda^2\\chi_{xx}(S_{1x}S_{2x}+S_{1y}S_{2y})+\\lambda^2\\chi_{zz}\\,\nS_{1z}S_{2z}$, coming from broken time-reversal symmetry of the host material.\n", "  To guide improved properties coincident with reduction of critical materials\nin permanent magnets, we investigate via density functional theory (DFT) the\nintrinsic magnetic properties of a promising system,\n$R$(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{11}$Ti$Z$ with $R$=Y, Ce and interstitial doping\n($Z$=H, C, N). The magnetization $M$, Curie temperature $T_\\text{C}$, and\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy energy $K$ calculated in local density\napproximation to DFT agree well with measurements. Site-resolved contributions\nto $K$ reveal that all three Fe sublattices promote uniaxial anisotropy in\nYFe$_{11}$Ti, while competing anisotropy contributions exist in YCo$_{11}$Ti.\nAs observed in experiments on $R$(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{11}$Ti, we find a\ncomplex nonmonotonic dependence of $K$ on Co content, and show that anisotropy\nvariations are a collective effect of MAE contributions from all sites and\ncannot be solely explained by preferential site occupancy. With interstitial\ndoping, calculated $T_\\text{C}$ enhancements are in the sequence of N$>$C$>$H,\nwith volume and chemical effects contributing to the enhancement. The uniaxial\nanisotropy of $R$(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{11}$Ti$Z$ generally decreases with C\nand N; although, for $R$=Ce, C doping is found to greatly enhance it for a\nsmall range of 0.7$<$$x$$<$0.9.\n", "  We present the mass distribution for all S/N > 15 pure DA white dwarfs\ndetected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey up to Data Release 12, fitted with\nKoester models for ML2/alpha=0.8, and with Teff > 10 000 K, and for DBs with\nS/N >10, fitted with ML2/alpha=1.25, for Teff > 16 000 K. These mass\ndistributions are for log g > 6.5 stars, i.e., excluding the Extremely Low Mass\nwhite dwarfs. We also present the mass distributions corrected by volume with\nthe 1/Vmax approach, for stars brighter than g=19. Both distributions have a\nmaximum at M=0.624 Msun but very distinct shapes. From the estimated\nz-distances, we deduce a disk scale height of 300 pc. We also present 10\nprobable halo white dwarfs, from their galactic U, V, W velocities.\n", "  It is known that steric blocking by peptide sidechains of hydrogen bonding,\nHB, between water and peptide groups, PGs, in beta sheets accords with an amino\nacid intrinsic beta sheet preference. The present observations with Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics, QMD, simulation with quantum mechanical treatment of every\nwater molecule solvating a beta sheet that would be transient in nature suggest\nthat this steric blocking is not applicable in a hydrophobic region unless a\ncation is present, so that the amino acid beta sheet preference due to this\nsteric blocking is only effective in the presence of a cation. We observed\nbackbone hydration in a polyalanine and to a lesser extent polyvaline alpha\nhelix without a cation being present, but a cation could increase the strength\nof these HBs.\n  Parallel beta sheets have a greater tendency than antiparallel beta sheets of\nequivalent small size to retain regular structure in solvated QMD, and a 4\nstrand 4 inter-PG HB chain parallel beta sheet was used. Stability was\nreinforced by one surface being polyvaline, which buttressed the opposite\nsurface which was used for experimentation. A single Ca2+ ion was used for\ninvestigation of individual binding events rather than bulk properties. No\ndirect binding between Ca2+ and the PG oxygen was observed in these\nsimulations, but perhaps it occurs at longer time scales as the transient beta\nsheet unfolds.\n  When linear scaling QMD methods that are accurate for peptide resonance,\nResonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding and the properties of water become\navailable, more extensive experiments having multiple ions of multiple types\ncould be performed at acceptable computational cost. It important that such\ninvestigations be performed on protein secondary structures rather than model\namides so that sidechain limitation of backbone hydration and hence intrinsic\namino acid propensity is captured.\n", "  We examine the suppression of quantum beating in a one dimensional non-\nlinear double well potential, made up of two focusing nonlinear point\ninteractions. The investigation of the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics is reduced to the\nstudy of a system of coupled nonlinear Volterra integral equations. For various\nvalues of the geometric and dynamical parameters of the model we give\nanalytical and numerical results on the way states, which are initially\nconfined in one well, evolve. We show that already for a nonlinearity exponent\nwell below the critical value there is complete suppression of the typical\nbeating behavior characterizing the linear quantum case.\n", "  We study multi-frequency quasi-periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators on\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponent and for general\nanalytic potentials. Combining Bourgain's semi-algebraic elimination of\nmultiple resonances with the method of elimination of double resonances via\nresultants, we establish exponential finite-volume localization as well as the\nseparation between the eigenvalues. In a follow-up paper we develop the method\nfurther to show that for potentials given by large generic trigonometric\npolynomials the spectrum consists of a single interval, as conjectured by\nChulaevski and Sinai.\n", "  In Fourier-based medical imaging, sampling below the Nyquist rate results in\nan underdetermined system, in which linear reconstructions will exhibit\nartifacts. Another consequence of under-sampling is lower signal to noise ratio\n(SNR) due to fewer acquired measurements. Even if an oracle provided the\ninformation to perfectly disambiguate the underdetermined system, the\nreconstructed image could still have lower image quality than a corresponding\nfully sampled acquisition because of the reduced measurement time. The effects\nof lower SNR and the underdetermined system are coupled during reconstruction,\nmaking it difficult to isolate the impact of lower SNR on image quality. To\nthis end, we present an image quality prediction process that reconstructs\nfully sampled, fully determined data with noise added to simulate the loss of\nSNR induced by a given under-sampling pattern. The resulting prediction image\nempirically shows the effect of noise in under-sampled image reconstruction\nwithout any effect from an underdetermined system.\n  We discuss how our image quality prediction process can simulate the\ndistribution of noise for a given under-sampling pattern, including variable\ndensity sampling that produces colored noise in the measurement data. An\ninteresting consequence of our prediction model is that we can show that\nrecovery from underdetermined non-uniform sampling is equivalent to a weighted\nleast squares optimization that accounts for heterogeneous noise levels across\nmeasurements.\n  Through a series of experiments with synthetic and in vivo datasets, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the image quality prediction process and show that\nit provides a better estimation of reconstruction image quality than the\ncorresponding fully-sampled reference image.\n", "  In this talk I discuss the interpretation of LHC Higgs measurements within\nthe electroweak chiral Lagrangian, paying particular attention to the role of\npower counting.\n", "  Many-body interactions can play a relevant role in water properties. Here we\nstudy by Monte Carlo simulations a coarse-grained model for bulk water that\nincludes many-body interactions associated to water cooperativity. The model is\nefficient and allows us to equilibrate water at extreme low temperatures in a\nwide range of pressures. We find the line of temperatures of maximum density at\nconstant pressure and, at low temperature and high pressure, a phase transition\nbetween high-density liquid and low-density liquid phases. The liquid-liquid\nphase transition ends in a critical point. In the supercritical liquid region\nwe find for each thermodynamic response function a locus of weak maxima at high\ntemperature and a locus of strong maxima at low temperature, with both loci\nconverging at the liquid-liquid critical point where they diverge. Comparing\nour results with previous works for the phase diagram of a many-body water\nmonolayer, we observe that the weak maxima of the specific heat are less\nevident in bulk and appear only at negative pressures, while we find those of\ncompressibility and thermal expansion coefficient also at positive pressures in\nbulk. However, the strong maxima of compressibility and thermal expansion\ncoefficient are very sharp for the bulk case. Our results clarify fundamental\nproperties of bulk water, possibly difficult to detect with atomistic models\nnot accounting for many-body interactions.\n", "  Self-assisted growth of InAs nanowires on graphene by molecular beam epitaxy\nis reported. Nanowires with diameter of ~50 nm and aspect ratio of up to 100\nwere achieved. The morphological and structural properties of the nanowires\nwere carefully studied by changing the substrate from bilayer graphene through\nbuffer layer to quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene. The positional relation\nof the InAs NWs with the graphene substrate was determined. A 30{\\deg}\norientation configuration of some of the InAs NWs is shown to be related to the\nsurface corrugation of the graphene substrate. InAs NW-based devices for\ntransport measurements were fabricated, and the conductance measurements showed\na semi-ballistic behavior. In Josephson junction measurements in the non-linear\nregime, Multiple Andreev Reflections were observed, and an inelastic scattering\nlength of about 900 nm was derived.\n", "  We have developed low temperature part of an ultra high vacuum scanning probe\nmicroscope (UHV-SPM) working at variable temperature within the range from 20 K\nto 700 K. To achieve the required temperature range, a flow cooling system\nusing cryogenic helium (~5 K) as a coolant was designed. The system consists of\na flow cryostat and a flexible low-loss transfer line connecting a Dewar vessel\nwith the flow cryostat. We have also tested liquid nitrogen (~ 77 K) as an\nalternative low-cost coolant. Using nitrogen, the microscope can operate at\ntemperatures of about 100 K and higher. As the flow of the coolant through the\ncryostat can cause thermally induced two-phase flow fluctuations resulting in\ninstability in temperatures, preliminary tests were done in order to find ways\nof avoiding the temperature oscillations and optimising the cooling process.\n", "  We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of the high-pressure\nbehavior of thallium. X-ray diffraction experiments have been carried out at\nroom temperature up to 125 GPa using diamond-anvil cells, nearly doubling the\npressure range of previous experiments. We have confirmed the hcp-fcc\ntransition at 3.5 GPa and determined that the fcc structure remains stable up\nto the highest pressure attained in the experiments. In addition, HP-HT\nexperiments have been performed up to 8 GPa and 700 K by using a combination of\nx-ray diffraction and a resistively heated diamond-anvil cell. Information on\nthe phase boundaries is obtained, as well as crystallographic information on\nthe HT bcc phase. The equation of state for different phases is reported. Ab\ninitio calculations have also been carried out considering several potential\nhigh-pressure structures. They are consistent with the experimental results and\npredict that, among the structures considered in the calculations, the fcc\nstructure of thallium is stable up to 4.3 TPa. Calculations also predict the\npost-fcc phase to have a close-packed orthorhombic structure above 4.3 TPa.\n", "  Because of the very peculiar conditions of chemistry in many astrophysical\ngases (low densities, mostly low temperatures, kinetics-dominated chemical\nevolution), great efforts have been devoted to study molecular signatures and\nchemical evolution. While experiments are being performed in many laboratories,\nit appears that the efforts directed towards theoretical works are not as\nstrong.\n  This report deals with the present status of chemical physics/physical\nchemistry theory, for the qualitative and quantitative understanding of\nkinetics of molecular scattering, being it reactive or inelastic. By gathering\nseveral types of expertise, from applied mathematics to physical chemistry,\ndialog is made possible, as a step towards new and more adapted theoretical\nframeworks, capable of meeting the theoretical, methodological and numerical\nchallenges of kinetics-dominated gas phase chemistry in astrophysical\nenvironments.\n  A state of the art panorama is presented, alongside present-day strengths and\nshortcomings. However, coverage is not complete, being limited in this report\nto actual attendance of the workshop. Some paths towards relevant progress are\nproposed.\n", "  The work is devoted to study of the following problem: can we use any\nqualitative criteria for realization of such universal phenomenon as\nself-organization in open systems? We have defined values of information at\nfixed points of probability function of density of information and entropy.\nPhysical meaning of these values as criteria of self-affinity and\nself-similarity in chaotic processes have been explained. We have shown that\nself-organization occurs if normalized information entropy S belongs to the\nrange 0.567<S<0.806. The validity of these findings is confirmed by calculation\nof value of S for hierarchical sets of well-known fractals.\n", "  Lepton flavor universality in the Standard Model and hints of its violation\nin neutral ($R_K$) and charged currents $(R_{D^{(*)}})$ in $B$ decays are\npresented. We discuss model independent features as well as several leptoquark\nscenarios which are well suited to fit current values of $R_K$ and/or\n$R_{D^{(*)}}$.\n", "  Asymmetric propagation of acoustic waves is theoretically reported in a\nchirped phononic crystal made of the combination of two different nonlinear\nsolids. The dispersion of the system is spatially dependent and allows the\nrainbow trapping inside the structure. Nonlinearity is used to activate the\nself-demodulation effect, which is enhanced due to the particular dispersion\ncharacteristics of the system. The main feature of the device is that\nintegrates the nonlinear and the filtering effects in a single propagating\nmedium. The performed numerical study reveals an efficient generation of the\ndemodulated wave, up to 15\\% in terms of the pressure amplitude, as well as\nstrong attenuation for undesired frequency components above the cut-off\nfrequency. The obtained energy rectification ratio is in the order of $10^4$\nfor the whole range of amplitudes employed in this work, indicating the\nrobustness of the asymmetry and non-reciprocity of the proposed device for a\nwide operational range.\n", "  Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a powerful tool for probing\nnanometer-scale ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. Hysteretic\nswitching of the phase and amplitude of the PFM response are believed to be the\nhallmark of ferroelectric and piezoelectric behavior respectively. However, the\napplication of PFM is limited by the fact that similar hysteretic effects may\nalso arise from mechanisms not related to ferroelectricity or piezoelectricity.\nIn this paper we report our studies on regular glass slides that show\nferroelectric-like signal without being ferroelectric and frequently used as a\nsubstrate in PFM experiments. We demonstrate how the substrates and other\nenvironmental factors like relative humidity and experimental conditions may\ninfluence the PFM results on novel materials.\n", "  In this thesis, we examine in detail the notion of black hole entropy in\nQuantum Field Theories, with a specific focus on supersymmetric black holes and\nthe perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections to the classical\narea-law of Bekenstein-Hawking. To examine such corrections, we employ the\nformalism of Sen's Quantum Entropy Function where the complete quantum entropy\nof a supersymmetric black hole in theories of supergravity is defined as a\npath-integral in the near-horizon region of the black hole. Evaluation of this\npath-integral can then be conducted exactly using localization computation\ntechniques. Due to the exactness of the localization argument, the results\nobtained in this manner are therefore formally expected to re-sum all\nperturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the classical area-law, and\nthus connect to string-theoretic predictions. We investigate such connections\nin detail for specific supersymmetric black holes in the hopes of strengthening\na Boltzmann-type interpretation of their thermodynamic entropy as arising from\nthe degeneracies of the microscopic gravitational constituents (the D-branes).\nWe find that this picture holds very precisely for two types of black holes\npreserving four real supercharges in both four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=8$ and\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ string theories and supergravities. From a broader point of\nview, such results can be interpreted as providing important examples where\nsupergravity theories encode the complete low-energy dynamics of string\ntheories and provide a consistent effective picture. Some interesting\nconnections to the mathematical theory of modular forms and mock modular forms\nare also exhibited.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to optimally design the set of b-values for\ndiffusion weighted MRI with the aim of accurate estimation of intra- voxel\nincoherent motion (IVIM) parameters (f perfusion fraction, Ds slow diffusion,\nDf fast diffusion) according to the model developed by Le Bihan. Previous\nstudies have addressed the design in a Monte Carlo fash- ion. Due to huge\ncomputation times, this approach is feasible only for a limited number of\nvalues of the parameters (local design): however, as the parameters of a\nspecific exam are not known a priori, it would be desirable to optimise\nb-values over a region of parameters. In order to overcome this issue, we\npropose to use a D-optimal design approach. The optimal combination of b-values\ncan be chosen from a candidate set of predefined values taken from the\nliterature. Our study has two key results: first, the optimal design does not\ndepend on perfusion fraction: this allow to perform a search over a 2D\nparameter space instead of 3D; second, as an exhaustive search over all\npossible designs would still be time consuming, we proposed an algorithm to\nfind an approximate solution can be found very quickly.\n", "  Increasing attention is being focussed on the use of symmetry-adapted\nfunctions to describe magnetic structures, structural distortions, and\nincommensurate crystallography. Though the calculation of such functions is\nwell developed, significant difficulties can arise, such as the generation of\ntoo many or too few basis functions to minimally span the linear vector space.\nWe present an elegant solution to these difficulties using the concept of basis\nsets, and discuss previous work in this area using this concept. Further, we\nhighlight the significance of unitary irreducible representations in this\nmethod, and provide the first validation that the irreducible representations\nof the crystallographic space groups tabulated by Kovalev are unitary\n", "  The $^{17}$O(p,$\\alpha$)$^{14}$N reaction plays a key role in various\nastrophysical scenarios, from asymptotic giant branch stars to classical novae.\nIt affects the synthesis of rare isotopes such as $^{17}$O and $^{18}$F, which\ncan provide constraints on astrophysical models. A new direct determination of\nthe $E_{\\rm R}~=~64.5$~keV resonance strength performed at the Laboratory for\nUnderground Nuclear Astrophysics accelerator has led to the most accurate value\nto date, $\\omega\\gamma = 10.0 \\pm 1.4_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.7_{\\rm syst}$~neV,\nthanks to a significant background reduction underground and generally improved\nexperimental conditions. The (bare) proton partial width of the corresponding\nstate at $E_{\\rm x} = 5672$~keV in $^{18}$F is $\\Gamma_{\\rm p} = 35 \\pm 5_{\\rm\nstat} \\pm 3_{\\rm syst}$~neV. This width is about a factor of 2 higher than\npreviously estimated thus leading to a factor of 2 increase in the\n$^{17}$O(p,$\\alpha$)$^{14}$N reaction rate at astrophysical temperatures\nrelevant to shell hydrogen-burning in red giant and asymptotic giant branch\nstars. The new rate implies lower $^{17}$O/$^{16}$O ratios, with important\nimplications on the interpretation of astrophysical observables from these\nstars.\n", "  We present a new method for calculating the product yield of a radical pair\nrecombination reaction in the presence of a weak time-dependent magnetic field.\nThis method successfully circumvents the computational difficulties presented\nby a direct solution of the Liouville-von Neumann equation for a long-lived\nradical pair containing many hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins. Using a modified\nformulation of Floquet theory, treating the time-dependent magnetic field as a\nperturbation, and exploiting the slow radical pair recombination, we show that\none can obtain a good approximation to the product yield by considering only\nnearly-degenerate sub-spaces of the Floquet space. Within a significant\nparameter range, the resulting method is found to give product yields in good\nagreement with exact quantum mechanical results for a variety of simple model\nradical pairs. Moreover it is considerably more efficient than the exact\ncalculation, and it can be applied to radical pairs containing significantly\nmore nuclear spins. This promises to open the door to realistic theoretical\ninvestigations of the effect of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation on the\nphotochemically induced radical pair recombination reactions in the avian\nretina which are believed to be responsible for the magnetic compass sense of\nmigratory birds.\n", "  The study of quantum spin-liquid states (QSL) with lattice dimension $>1$ has\nproven an enduring problem in solid state physics. Key candidate materials are\nthe $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ kagome magnets due to their ability to host quantum\nfluctuations within the high degeneracy of their frustrated geometries. Studies\nof an increasing library of known $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ kagome magnetic materials has\nchallenged our understanding of the possible QSL states, for example, the\nrecent discovery of a chiral spin-liquid ground state in kapellasite showed\nthat even magnets with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbour exchange are not\nnecessarily trivial and that QSL states beyond the superposition of simple\nsinglet are possible.\n  Here, we outline the synthesis, structure and preliminary magnetic\ncharacterisation of a candidate QSL material, the $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ kagome magnet\nNH$_4$Cu$_{2.5}$V$_2$O$_7$(OH)$_2$.H$_2$O. The crystal structure of\nNH$_4$Cu$_{2.5}$V$_2$O$_7$(OH)$_2$.H$_2$O has the 3-fold symmetry of a\ngeometrically `perfect' kagome lattice while the magnetism shows a competition\nbetween ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic characters reminiscent of\nkapellasite.\n", "  Recent detections of complex organic molecules in dark clouds have rekindled\ninterest in the astrochemical modeling of these environments. Because of its\nrelative closeness and rich molecular complexity, TMC-1 has been extensively\nobserved to study the chemical processes taking place in dark clouds. We use\nlocal thermodynamical equilibrium radiative transfer modeling coupled with a\nBayesian statistical method which takes into account outliers to analyze the\ndata from the Nobeyama spectral survey of TMC-1 between 8 and 50 GHz. We\ncompute the abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of 57 molecules, including\n19 isotopologues in TMC-1 along with their associated uncertainty. The new\nresults are in general agreement with previous abundance determination from\nOhishi & Kaifu and the values reported in the review from Agundez & Wakelam.\nHowever, in some cases, large opacity and low signal to noise effects allow\nonly upper or lower limits to be derived, respectively.\n", "  We consider the problem of computing energy distribution of inner harmonic\noscillations of a nanoparticle in its phase space, when the particle moves in a\nmedium in heat equilibrium under certain temperature. It is assumed that the\nparticle obeys the Brownian motion under the action of the medium and the force\nfield given by a potential function. In the present paper we provide and study\nan equation describing the problem, generalizing the Klein--Kramers equation.\nIt is shown that for large value of medium resistance, the process of energy\ndistribution of inner harmonic oscillations of the nanoparticle is represented\nas the composition of a rapid transition process and a slow process. After the\nrapid transition process, the system goes to a quasi-stationary state. The slow\nprocess is approximately described by the standard Schrodinger equation used\nfor description ofquantum processes. Thus, the process being studied can serve\nas a model of quantum processes.\n", "  In [N. Friis, New J. Phys. 18, 033014 (2016)] the non-relativistic\ndescription of fermions is considered and in particular the role of the parity\nsuperselection rule in relation to the characterization of entanglement. An\nargument based on the spin-statistics connection is presented as a physical\nmotivation for the parity superselection rule. Since the spin statistics\nconnection was derived in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics it is\nargued that the inclusion of the parity superselection rule is motivated by\nLorentz invariance. Based on this it is further argued that fermionic Quantum\nInformation theory and the theory of special relativity are conceptually\ninseparable. In this comment a different, and well known, motivation for the\nparity superselection rule is given that does not rely on arguments from\nrelativistic quantum mechanics, but instead uses the assumptions that the laws\nof physics are the same for different observers and the no-signalling\nprinciple.\n", "  We calculate the decay width of $h^0 \\to b \\bar{b}$ in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with quark-flavour violation (QFV) at full\none-loop level. The effect of $\\tilde{c}-\\tilde{t}$ mixing and\n$\\tilde{s}-\\tilde{b}$ mixing is studied taking into account the constraints\nfrom the B-meson data. We discuss and compare in detail the decays $h^0 \\to c\n\\bar{c}$ and $h^0 \\to b \\bar{b}$ within the framework of the perturbative mass\ninsertion technique using the Flavour Expansion Theorem. The deviation of both\ndecay widths from the Standard Model results can be quite large. While in $h^0\n\\to c \\bar{c}$ it is almost entirely due to the flavour violating part of the\nMSSM, in $h^0 \\to b \\bar{b}$ it is mainly due to the flavour conserving part.\nNevertheless, $\\Gamma(h^0 \\to b \\bar{b})$ can fluctuate up to $\\sim 7\\%$ due to\nQFV chargino exchange with large $\\tilde{c}-\\tilde{t}$ mixing. due to QFV\nchargino exchange with large $\\tilde{c}-\\tilde{t}$ mixing.\n", "  I start with a discussion of spherical winds and small-scale clumping, before\ncontinuing with various theories that have been proposed to predict how mass\nloss depends on stellar rotation -- both in terms of wind strength, as well as\nthe latitudinal dependence of the wind. This very issue is crucial for our\ngeneral understanding of angular momentum evolution in massive stars, and the\nB[e] phenomenon in particular. I then discuss the tool of linear polarimetry\nthat allows us to probe the difference between polar and equatorial mass loss,\nallowing us to test B[e] and related disk formation theories.\n", "  We study space and time efficient quantum algorithms for two graph problems\n-- deciding whether an $n$-vertex graph is a forest, and whether it is\nbipartite. Via a reduction to the s-t connectivity problem, we describe quantum\nalgorithms for deciding both properties in $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time and using\n$O(\\log n)$ classical and quantum bits of storage in the adjacency matrix\nmodel. We then present quantum algorithms for deciding the two properties in\nthe adjacency array model, which run in time $\\tilde{O}(n\\sqrt{d_m})$ and also\nrequire $O(\\log n)$ space, where $d_m$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in\nthe input graph.\n", "  The quasi-optical modulation of linear polarization at millimeter and\nsub-millimeter wavelengths can be achieved by using rotating half wave plates\n(HWPs) in front of polarization sensitive detectors. Large operational\nbandwidths are required when the same device is meant to work simultaneously\nacross different frequency bands. Previous realizations of half wave plates,\nranging from birefringent multi-plate to mesh-based devices, have achieved\nbandwidths of the order of 100%. Here we present the design and the\nexperimental characterization of a reflective HWP able to work across\nbandwidths of the order of 150%. The working principle of the novel device is\ncompletely different from any previous realization and it is based on the\ndifferent phase-shift experienced by two orthogonal polarizations respectively\nreflecting off an electric conductor and off an artificial magnetic conductor.\n", "  It is shown that the Jordan frame and its conformally transformed version,\nthe Einstein frame of nonminimally coupled theories of gravity, are actually\nequivalent at the quantum level. The example of the theory taken up is the\nBrans-Dicke theory, and the wave packet calculations are done for a homogeneous\nand isotropic cosmological model in the purest form of the theory, i.e., in the\nabsence of any additional matter sector. The calculations are clean and exact,\nand the result obtained are unambiguous.\n", "  We investigate the collision energy dependence of shear viscosity over the\nentropy density ratio $\\eta/s$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=19.6, 39$,\nand $62.4$ GeV, using Bayesian statistical analysis and Gaussian process\nemulators to explore the full input parameter space of a\ntransport+hydrodynamics hybrid model. The ratio is found to decrease as a\nfunction of collision energy, supporting the results from previous studies\nperformed with the same hybrid model.\n", "  Experiments, numerical simulations, and analytical calculations are used to\ncalibrate a diffuse-interface Cahn-Hilliard model of Li-Sn thin film electrodes\nthat experience a transformation from Sn to Li2Sn5. It is shown that a\nconcentration-gradient dependent mobility can be used in the Cahn-Hilliard\nequation to give the interface a finite mobility and capture its nonequilibrium\nbehavior. Comparing experiments and simulations, the free-energy of Li-Sn,\ndiffusivity of Li in Sn and Li2Sn5, the exchange current density for the\nsurface reaction, and the mobility of the Sn/Li2Sn5 interface are extracted.\nThe implications of finite interface mobility for practical battery electrodes\nare discussed.\n", "  Based on the observed high velocity of pulsars it is thought that neutron\nstars (NSs) receive a significant velocity kick at birth. Such natal kicks are\nconsidered to play an important role in the the evolution of binary-NS systems.\nThe kick given to the NS (together with the effect of mass loss due to the\nsupernova explosion of the NS progenitor) may result in the binary disruption\nor lead to a significant change of the binary orbital properties. Here we\nexplore in detail the dynamical aftermath of natal kicks in binary systems,\ndetermine their possible outcomes and characterize their relative frequency,\nmaking use of analytic arguments and detailed population synthesis models. In a\nfraction of the cases the kick may cast the NS in such a trajectory as to\ncollide with the binary companion, or pass sufficiently close to it as to\ndisrupt it (micro tidal disruption event; $\\mu$TDE), or alternatively it could\nbe tidally-captured into a close orbit, eventually forming an X-ray binary. We\ncalculate the rates of direct post-kick physical collisions and the possible\npotential production of Thorne-Zytkow objects or long-GRBs through this\nprocess, estimate the rates X-ray binaries formation and determine the rates of\n$\\mu$TDEs and faint supernovae from white dwarf disruptions by NSs. Finally we\nsuggest that natal kicks can produce BH-NS binaries with very short\ngravitational-wave merger time, possibly giving rise to a new type of promptly\nappearing eLISA gravitational wave (GW) sources, as well as producing aLIGO\nbinary-merger GW sources with a unique (likely type Ib/c) supernova\nelectromagnetic counterpart which precedes the GW merger.\n", "  The MAterials Simulation Toolkit (MAST) is a workflow manager and\npost-processing tool for ab initio defect and diffusion workflows. MAST\ncodifies research knowledge and best practices for such workflows, and allows\nfor the generation and management of easily modified and reproducible\nworkflows, where data is stored along with workflow information for data\nprovenance tracking. MAST is open-source and available for download (see PDF\nfor links).\n", "  A fluid flow in a multiply connected domain generated by an arbitrary number\nof point vortices is considered. A stream function for this flow is constructed\nas a limit of a certain functional sequence using the method of images. The\nconvergence of this sequence is discussed, and the speed of convergence is\ndetermined explicitly. The presented formulas allow for the easy computation of\nthe values of the stream function with arbitrary precision in the case of\nwell-separated cylinders. The considered problem is important for applications\nsuch as eddy flows in the oceans. Moreover, since finding the stream function\nof the flow is essentially identical to finding the modified Green's function\nfor Laplace's equation, the presented method can be applied to a more general\nclass of applied problems which involve solving the Dirichlet problem for\nLaplace's equation.\n", "  We present new measurements of the projected spin--orbit angle $\\lambda$ for\nsix WASP hot Jupiters, four of which are new to the literature (WASP-61, -62,\n-76, and -78), and two of which are new analyses of previously measured systems\nusing new data (WASP-71, and -79). We use three different models based on two\ndifferent techniques: radial velocity measurements of the Rossiter--McLaughlin\neffect, and Doppler tomography. Our comparison of the different models reveals\nthat they produce projected stellar rotation velocities ($v \\sin I_{\\rm s}$)\nmeasurements often in disagreement with each other and with estimates obtained\nfrom spectral line broadening. The Bou\\'e model for the Rossiter--McLaughlin\neffect consistently underestimates the value of $v\\sin I_{\\rm s}$ compared to\nthe Hirano model. Although $v \\sin I_s$ differed, the effect on $\\lambda$ was\nsmall for our sample, with all three methods producing values in agreement with\neach other. Using Doppler tomography, we find that WASP-61\\,b\n($\\lambda=4^\\circ.0^{+17.1}_{-18.4}$), WASP-71\\,b\n($\\lambda=-1^\\circ.9^{+7.1}_{-7.5}$), and WASP-78\\,b\n($\\lambda=-6^\\circ.4\\pm5.9$) are aligned. WASP-62\\,b\n($\\lambda=19^\\circ.4^{+5.1}_{-4.9}$) is found to be slightly misaligned, while\nWASP-79\\,b ($\\lambda=-95^\\circ.2^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$) is confirmed to be strongly\nmisaligned and has a retrograde orbit. We explore a range of possibilities for\nthe orbit of WASP-76\\,b, finding that the orbit is likely to be strongly\nmisaligned in the positive $\\lambda$ direction.\n", "  Energy analyzers are important plasma diagnostic tools with applications in a\nbroad range of disciplines including molecular spectroscopy, electron\nmicroscopy, basic plasma physics, plasma etching, plasma processing, and ion\nsputtering technology. The Hyperbolic Field Energy Analyzer (HFEA) is a novel\ndevice able to determine ion and electron energy spectra and temperatures. The\nHFEA is well suited for ion temperature and density diagnostics at those\nsituations where ions are scarce. A simulation of the capacities of the HFEA to\ndiscriminate particles of a particular energy level, as well as to determine\ntemperature and density is performed in this work. The electric field due the\ncombination of the conical elements, collimator lens, and Faraday cup applied\nvoltage was computed in a well suited three-dimensional grid. The field is\nlater used to compute the trajectory of a set of particles with a predetermined\nenergy distribution. The results include the observation of the particle\ntrajectories inside the sensor, the comparison of the input energy distribution\nto the energy distribution of the particles captured by the Faraday cup, and\nthe IV characteristic at the Faraday cup, using the voltage sweep at the\nconical elements as the abscissa.\n", "  B[e] Supergiants are a phase in the evolution of some massive stars for which\nwe have observational evidence but no predictions by any stellar evolution\nmodel. The mass-loss during this phase creates a complex circumstellar\nenvironment with atomic, molecular, and dust regions usually found in rings or\ndisk-like structures. However, the detailed structure and the formation of the\ncircumstellar environment are not well-understood, requiring further\ninvestigation. To address that we initiated an observing campaign to obtain a\nhomogeneous set of high-resolution spectra in both the optical and NIR (using\nMPG-ESO/FEROS, GEMINI/Phoenix and VLT/CRIRES, respectively). We monitor a\nnumber of Galactic B[e] Supergiants, for which we examined the [OI] and [CaII]\nemission lines and the bandheads of the CO and SiO molecules to probe the\nstructure and the kinematics of their formation regions. We find that the\nemission from each tracer forms either in a single or in multiple equatorial\nrings.\n", "  Gigahertz-to-terahertz spectroscopy of macromolecules in aqueous environments\nprovides an important approach for identifying their global and transient\nmolecular structures, as well as directly assessing hydrogen-bonding. We report\ndielectric properties of zwitterionic dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles in\naqueous solutions over a wide frequency range, from 50 MHz to 1.12 THz. The\ndielectric relaxation spectra reveal different polarization mechanisms at the\nmolecular level, reflecting the complexity of DPC micelle-water interactions.\nWe have made a deconvolution of the spectra into different components and\ncombined them with the effective-medium approximation to separate delicate\nprocesses of micelles in water. Our measurements demonstrate reorientational\nmotion of the DPC surfactant head groups within the micelles, and two levels of\nhydration water shells, including tightly- and loosely-bound hydration water\nlayers. From the dielectric strength of bulk water in DPC solutions, we found\nthat the number of waters in hydration shells is approximately constant at 950\n+/- 45 water molecules per micelle in DPC concentrations up to 400 mM, and it\ndecreases after that. At terahertz frequencies, employing the effective-medium\napproximation, we estimate that each DPC micelle is surrounded by a\ntightly-bound layer of 310 +/- 45 water molecules that behave as if they are an\nintegral part of the micelle. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, we\ndetermine that tightly-bound waters are directly hydrogen-bonded to oxygens of\nDPC, while loosely-bound waters reside within 4 A of micellar atoms. The\ndielectric response of DPC micelles at terahertz frequencies yields, for the\nfirst time, experimental information regarding the largest-scale, lowest\nfrequency collective motions in micelles.\n", "  We present topological derivative and energy based procedures for the imaging\nof micro and nanostructures using one beam of visible light of a single\nwavelength. Objects with diameters as small as 10 nm can be located, and their\nposition tracked with nanometer precision. Multiple objects distributed either\non planes perpendicular to the incidence direction or along axial lines in the\nincidence direction are distinguishable. More precisely, the shape and size of\nplane sections perpendicular to the incidence direction can be clearly\ndetermined, even for asymmetric and non-convex scatterers. Axial resolution\nimproves as the size of the objects decreases. Initial reconstructions may\nproceed by glueing together 2D horizontal slices between axial peaks or by\nlocating objects at 3D peaks of topological energies, depending on the\neffective wavenumber. Below a threshold size, topological derivative based\niterative schemes improve initial predictions of the location, size and shape\nof objects by postprocessing fixed measured data. For larger sizes, tracking\nthe peaks of topological energy fields that average information from additional\nincident light beams seems to be more effective.\n", "  We find analytic asymptotic expressions at low temperature for the Casimir\nfree energy, entropy and pressure of two parallel graphene sheets in the\nframework of the Lifshitz theory. The reflection coefficients of\nelectromagnetic waves on graphene are described on the basis of first\nprinciples of quantum electrodynamics at nonzero temperature using the\npolarization tensor in (2+1)-dimensional space-time. The leading contributions\nto the Casimir entropy and to the thermal corrections to the Casimir energy and\npressure are given by the thermal correction to the polarization tensor at\nnonzero Matsubara frequencies. It is shown that the Casimir entropy for two\ngraphene sheets goes to zero when the temperature vanishes, i.e., the third law\nof thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem) is satisfied. At low temperature,\nthe magnitude of the thermal correction to the Casimir pressure between two\ngraphene sheets is shown to vary inversely proportional to the separation. The\nNernst heat theorem for graphene is discussed in the context of problems\noccurring in Casimir physics for both metallic and dielectric plates.\n", "  In this investigation, undoped BiFeO$_3$, Gd doped\nBi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$, and Gd-Ti co-doped\nBi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ (x = 0.10, 0.20) materials were\nsynthesized to report their multiferroic properties. The structural analysis\nand phase identification of these multiferroic ceramics were performed using\nRietveld refinement. The Rietveld analysis has confirmed the high phase purity\nof the 10% Gd-Ti co-doped Bi$_{0.9}$Gd$_{0.1}$Fe$_{0.9}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_3$ sample\ncompared to that of other compositions under investigation. The major phase of\nthis particular composition is of rhombohedral \\textit{R3c} type structure (wt%\n$>99\\%$) with negligible amount of impurity phases. In terms of\ncharacterization, we address magnetic properties of this co-doped ceramic\nsystem by applying substantially higher magnetic fields than that applied in\npreviously reported investigations. The dependence of temperature and maximum\napplied magnetic fields on their magnetization behavior have also been\ninvestigated. Additionally, the leakage current density has been measured to\nexplore its effect on the ferroelectric properties of this multiferroic system.\nThe outcome of this investigation suggests that the substitution of 10% Gd and\nTi in place of Bi and Fe, respectively, in BiFeO$_3$ significantly enhances its\nmultiferroic properties. The improved properties of this specific composition\nis associated with homogeneous reduced grain size, significant suppression of\nimpurity phases and reduction in leakage current density which is further\nasserted by polarization vs. electric field hysteresis loop measurements.\n", "  We have performed a complete study of self-dual configurations in a $CPT$-odd\nand Lorentz-violating gauged $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model. We have consistently\nimplemented the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism and obtained the\ncorrespondent differential first-order equations describing electrically\ncharged self-dual configurations. The total energy and magnetic flux of the\nvortices, besides being proportional to the winding number, also depend\nexplicitly on the Lorentz-violating coefficients belonging to the sigma sector.\nThe total electrical charge is proportional to the magnetic flux such as it\noccurs in Chern-Simons models. The Lorentz violation in the sigma sector allows\none to interpolate between Lorentz-violating versions of some sigma models: the\ngauged $O(3)$ sigma model and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons $O(3)$ sigma model. The\nLorentz violation enhances the amplitude of the magnetic field and BPS energy\ndensity near the origin, augmenting the deviation in relation to the solutions\ndeprived of Lorentz violation.\n", "  We present the capabilities of our new code for obtaining Doppler maps\nimplementing the maximum likelihood approach. As test data, we used\nobservations of the dwarf nova V2051 Ophiuchi. The system was observed in\nquiescence at least 16 d before the onset of the next outburst. Using Doppler\nmaps obtained for ten emission lines covering three orbital cycles, we detected\nspiral structures in the accretion disc of V2051 Oph. However, these structures\ncould be biased as our data sampled the orbital period of the binary at only\neight different orbital phases. Our Doppler maps show evolution from a one-arm\nwave structure in H$\\alpha$ to two-armed waves in the other lines. The location\nof the two-arm structures agrees with simulations showing tidally driven spiral\nwaves in the accretion disc. During consecutive cycles, the qualitative\ncharacteristics of the detected structures remained similar but the central\nabsorption increased. For the first time, using the Doppler tomography method,\nwe obtained temperature maps of the accretion disc. However, taking into\naccount all the assumptions involved when using our method to retrieve them,\nthe result should be treated with caution. Our maps present a relatively flat\ndistribution of the temperature over the disc, showing no temperature increase\nat the location of the spiral arms. Using `ring masking', we have revealed an\nionized region located close to the expected location of stream--disc\ninteractions. We found the average temperature of the accretion disc to be 5600\nK, which is below the critical limit deduced from the disc instability model.\n", "  I suggest a simple alteration of my CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization)\ntheory, replacing the mass density collapse-generating operators by\nrelativistic energy density operators. Some consequences of the density matrix\nevolution equation are explored. First, the expression for the mean energy\nincrease of free particles is calculated (which, in the non-relativistic limit,\nagrees with the usual result). Then, the density matrix evolution is applied to\nphotons. The mean rate of loss of photon number from a laser beam pulse, the\nmomentum distribution of the photons \"excited\" out of the laser beam pulse, and\nthe alteration of the cosmic blackbody spectrum are all treated to first order\nin the collapse rate parameter $\\lambda$. Associated possible experimental\nlimits on $\\lambda$ are discussed.\n", "  We presented numerical simulation of long waves, interacting with arrays of\nemergent cylinders inside regularly spaced patches, representing discontinues\npatchy coastal vegetation. We employed the fully nonlinear and weakly\ndispersive Serre-Green-Naghdi equations (SGN) until the breaking process\nstarts, while we changed the governing equations to nonlinear shallow water\nequations (NSW) at the vicinity of the breaking-wave peak and during the runup\nstage. We modeled the cylinders as physical boundaries rather than\napproximating them as macro-roughness friction. We showed that the cylinders\nprovide protection for the areas behind them. However they might also cause\namplification in local water depth in those areas. The presented results are\nextensively validated against the existing numerical and experimental data. Our\nresults demonstrate the capability and reliability of our model in simulating\nwave interaction with emergent cylinders.\n", "  The Point Spread Function (PSF) is a key figure of merit for specifying the\nangular resolution of optical systems and, as the demand for higher and higher\nangular resolution increases, the problem of surface finishing must be taken\nseriously even in optical telescopes. From the optical design of the\ninstrument, reliable ray-tracing routines allow computing and display of the\nPSF based on geometrical optics. However, such an approach does not directly\naccount for the scattering caused by surface microroughness, which is\ninterferential in nature. Although the scattering effect can be separately\nmodeled, its inclusion in the ray-tracing routine requires assumptions that are\ndifficult to verify. In that context, a purely physical optics approach is more\nappropriate as it remains valid regardless of the shape and size of the defects\nappearing on the optical surface. Such a computation, when performed in\ntwo-dimensional consideration, is memory and time consuming because it requires\none to process a surface map with a few micron resolution, and the situation\nbecomes even more complicated in case of optical systems characterized by more\nthan one reflection. Fortunately, the computation is significantly simplified\nin far-field configuration, since the computation involves only a sequence of\nFourier Transforms. In this paper, we provide validation of the PSF simulation\nwith Physical Optics approach through comparison with real PSF measurement data\nin the case of ASTRI-SST M1 hexagonal segments. These results represent a first\nfoundation stone for future development in a more advanced computation taking\ninto account microroughness and multiple reflection in optical systems.\n", "  In this paper we explicitly work out the precise relationship between Ext\ngroups and massless modes of D-branes wrapped on complex submanifolds of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. Specifically, we explicitly compute the boundary vertex\noperators for massless Ramond sector states, in open string B models describing\nCalabi-Yau manifolds at large radius, directly in BCFT using standard methods.\nNaively these vertex operators are in one-to-one correspondence with certain\nsheaf cohomology groups (as is typical for such vertex operator calculations),\nwhich are related to the desired Ext groups via spectral sequences. However, a\nsubtlety in the physics of the open string B model has the effect of physically\nrealizing those spectral sequences in BRST cohomology, so that the vertex\noperators are actually in one-to-one correspondence with Ext group elements.\nThis gives an extremely concrete physical test of recent proposals regarding\nthe relationship between derived categories and D-branes. We check these\nresults extensively in numerous examples, and comment on several related\nissues.\n", "  In this paper we extend previous work on calculating massless boundary Ramond\nsector spectra of open strings to include cases with nonzero flat B fields. In\nsuch cases, D-branes are no longer well-modelled precisely by sheaves, but\nrather they are replaced by `twisted' sheaves, reflecting the fact that gauge\ntransformations of the B field act as affine translations of the Chan-Paton\nfactors. As in previous work, we find that the massless boundary Ramond sector\nstates are counted by Ext groups -- this time, Ext groups of twisted sheaves.\nAs before, the computation of BRST cohomology relies on physically realizing\nsome spectral sequences. Subtleties that cropped up in previous work also\nappear here.\n", "  In these notes we review recent work on describing D-branes with nonzero\nHiggs vevs in terms of sheaves, which gives a physical on-shell D-brane\ninterpretation to more sheaves than previously understood as describing\nD-branes. The mathematical ansatz for this encoding is checked by comparing\nopen string spectra between D-branes with nonzero Higgs vevs to Ext groups\nbetween the corresponding sheaves. We illustrate the general methods with a few\nexamples.\n", "  In this paper we will discuss gauged linear sigma model descriptions of toric\nstacks. Toric stacks have a simple description in terms of (symplectic, GIT)\n${\\bf C}^{\\times}$ quotients of homogeneous coordinates, in exactly the same\nform as toric varieties. We describe the physics of the gauged linear sigma\nmodels that formally coincide with the mathematical description of toric\nstacks, and check that physical predictions of those gauged linear sigma models\nexactly match the corresponding stacks. We also check in examples that when a\ngiven toric stack has multiple presentations in a form accessible as a gauged\nlinear sigma model, that the IR physics of those different presentations\nmatches, so that the IR physics is presentation-independent, making it\nreasonable to associate CFT's to stacks, not just presentations of stacks. We\ndiscuss mirror symmetry for stacks, using Morrison-Plesser-Hori-Vafa techniques\nto compute mirrors explicitly, and also find a natural generalization of\nBatyrev's mirror conjecture. In the process of studying mirror symmetry, we\nfind some new abstract CFT's, involving fields valued in roots of unity.\n", "  In this paper we shall describe some correlation function computations in\nperturbative heterotic strings that generalize B model computations. On the\n(2,2) locus, correlation functions in the B model receive no quantum\ncorrections, but off the (2,2) locus, that can change. Classically, the (0,2)\nanalogue of the B model is equivalent to the previously-discussed (0,2)\nanalogue of the A model, but with the gauge bundle dualized -- our\ngeneralization of the A model, also simultaneously generalizes the B model. The\nA and B analogues sometimes have different regularizations, however, which\ndistinguish them quantum-mechanically. We discuss how properties of the (2,2) B\nmodel, such as the lack of quantum corrections, are realized in (0,2) A model\nlanguage. In an appendix, we also extensively discuss how the Calabi-Yau\ncondition for the closed string B model (uncoupled to topological gravity) can\nbe weakened slightly, a detail which does not seem to have been covered in the\nliterature previously. That weakening also manifests in the description of the\n(2,2) B model as a (0,2) A model.\n", "  In this paper we study CFT's associated to gerbes. These theories suffer from\na lack of cluster decomposition, but this problem can be resolved: the CFT's\nare the same as CFT's for disconnected targets. Such theories also lack cluster\ndecomposition, but in that form, the lack is manifestly not very problematic.\nIn particular, we shall see that this matching of CFT's, this duality between\nnoneffective gaugings and sigma models on disconnected targets, is a worldsheet\nduality related to T-duality. We perform a wide variety of tests of this claim,\nranging from checking partition functions at arbitrary genus to D-branes to\nmirror symmetry. We also discuss a number of applications of these results,\nincluding predictions for quantum cohomology and Gromov-Witten theory and\nadditional physical understanding of the geometric Langlands program.\n", "  We examine to what extent heterotic string worldsheets can describe arbitrary\nE8xE8 gauge fields. The traditional construction of heterotic strings builds\neach E8 via a Spin(16)/Z2 subgroup, typically realized as a current algebra by\nleft-moving fermions, and as a result, only E8 gauge fields reducible to\nSpin(16)/Z2 gauge fields are directly realizable in standard constructions.\nHowever, there exist perturbatively consistent E8 gauge fields which can not be\nreduced to Spin(16)/Z2, and so cannot be described within standard heterotic\nworldsheet constructions. A natural question to then ask is whether there\nexists any (0,2) SCFT that can describe such E8 gauge fields. To answer this\nquestion, we first show how each ten-dimensional E8 partition function can be\nbuilt up using other subgroups than Spin(16)/Z2, then construct ``fibered WZW\nmodels'' which allow us to explicitly couple current algebras for general\ngroups and general levels to heterotic strings. This technology gives us a very\ngeneral approach to handling heterotic compactifications with arbitrary\nprincipal bundles. It also gives us a physical realization of some elliptic\ngenera constructed recently by Ando and Liu.\n", "  In this paper we give an inherently toric description of a special class of\nsheaves (known as equivariant sheaves) over toric varieties, due in part to A.\nA. Klyachko. We apply this technology to heterotic compactifications, in\nparticular to the (0,2) models of Distler, Kachru, and also discuss how\nknowledge of equivariant sheaves can be used to reconstruct information about\nan entire moduli space of sheaves. Many results relevant to heterotic\ncompactifications previously known only to mathematicians are collected here --\nfor example, results concerning whether the restriction of a stable sheaf to a\nCalabi-Yau hypersurface remains stable are stated. We also describe\nsubstructure in the Kahler cone, in which moduli spaces of sheaves are\nindependent of Kahler class only within any one subcone. We study F theory\ncompactifications in light of this fact, and also discuss how it can be seen in\nthe context of equivariant sheaves on toric varieties. Finally we briefly\nspeculate on the application of these results to (0,2) mirror symmetry.\n", "  To define a consistent perturbative geometric heterotic compactification the\nbundle is required to satisfy a subtle constraint known as ``stability,'' which\ndepends upon the Kahler form. This dependence upon the Kahler form is highly\nnontrivial---the Kahler cone splits into subcones, with a distinct moduli space\nof bundles in each subcone---and has long been overlooked by physicists. In\nthis article we describe this behavior and its physical manifestation.\n"]}
