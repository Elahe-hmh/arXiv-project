In this\nletter we introduce the model for a secure and unsecured topological cluster\nmainframe. We consider the quantum analogue of High Performance Computing,\nwhere a dedicated server farm is utilized by many users to run algorithms and\nshare quantum data. The scaling structure of photonics based topological\ncluster computing leads to an attractive future for server based QIP, where\ndedicated mainframes can be constructed and/or expanded to serve an\nincreasingly hungry user base with the ideal resource for individual quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  Superstatistics describes statistical systems that behave like superpositions\nof different inverse temperatures $\\beta$, so that the probability distribution\nis $p(\\epsilon_i) \\propto \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(\\beta) e^{-\\beta\n\\epsilon_i}d\\beta$, where the `kernel' $f(\\beta)$ is nonnegative and normalized\n($\\int f(\\beta)d \\beta =1$). We discuss the relation between this distribution\nand the generalized entropic form $S=\\sum_i s(p_i)$. The first three\nShannon-Khinchin axioms are assumed to hold. It then turns out that for a given\ndistribution there are two different ways to construct the entropy. One\napproach uses escort probabilities and the other does not; the question of\nwhich to use must be decided empirically. The two approaches are related by a\nduality. The thermodynamic properties of the system can be quite different for\nthe two approaches. In that connection we present the transformation laws for\nthe superstatistical distributions under macroscopic state changes. The\ntransformation group is the Euclidean group in one dimension.\n", "  We use the method of double pole QCD sum rule which is basically a fit with\ntwo exponentials of the correlation function, where we can extract the masses\nand decay constants of mesons as a function of the Borel mass. We apply this\nmethod to study the mesons: $\\rho(1S,2S)$, $\\psi(1S,2S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S,2S)$ and\n$\\psi_t(1S,2S)$. We also present predictions for the toponiuns masses\n$\\psi_t(1S,2S)$ of m(1S)=357 GeV and m(2S)=374 GeV.\n", "  Purpose: Beam range control is the essence of radiotherapy with heavy charged\nparticles. In conventional broad-beam delivery, fine range adjustment is\nachieved by insertion of range shifting and compensating materials. In\ndosimetry, solid phantoms are often used for convenience. These materials\nshould ideally be equivalent to water. In this study, we evaluated dosimetric\nwater equivalence of four common plastics, HDPE, PMMA, PET, and POM.\n  Methods: Using the Bethe formula for energy loss, the Gottschalk formula for\nmultiple scattering, and the Sihver formula for nuclear interactions, we\ncalculated the effective densities of the plastics for these interactions. We\nexperimentally measured variation of the Bragg peak of carbon-ion beams by\ninsertion of HDPE, PMMA, and POM, which were compared with analytical model\ncalculations.\n  Results: The theoretical calculation resulted in slightly reduced multiple\nscattering and severely increased nuclear interactions for HDPE, compared to\nwater and the other plastics. The increase in attenuation of carbon ions for\n20-cm range shift was experimentally measured to be 8.9\\% for HDPE, 2.5\\% for\nPMMA, and 0.0\\% for POM while PET was theoretically estimated to be in between\nPMMA and POM. The agreement between the measurements and the calculations was\nabout 1\\% or better.\n  Conclusions: For carbon-ion beams, POM was dosimetrically indistinguishable\nfrom water and the best of the plastics examined in this study. The poorest was\nHDPE, which would reduce the Bragg peak by 0.45\\% per 1-cm range shift,\nalthough with marginal superiority for reduced multiple scattering. Between the\ntwo clear plastics, PET would be superior to PMMA in dosimetric water\nequivalence.\n", "  \\item[Purpose] A recent study revealed that polyethylene (PE) would cause\nextra carbon-ion attenuation per range shift by 0.45\\%/cm due to compositional\ndifferences in nuclear interactions. The present study aims to assess the\ninfluence of PE range compensators on tumor dose in carbon-ion radiotherapy.\n\\item[Methods] Carbon-ion radiation was modeled to be composed of primary\ncarbon ions and secondary particles, for each of which the dose and the\nrelative biological effectiveness (RBE) were estimated at a tumor depth in the\nmiddle of spread-out Bragg peak. Assuming exponential behavior for attenuation\nand yield of these components with depth, the PE effect on dose was calculated\nfor clinical carbon-ion beams and was partly tested by experiment. The\ntwo-component model was integrated into a treatment-planning system and the PE\neffect was estimated in two clinical cases. \\item[Results] The attenuation per\nrange shift by PE was 0.1\\%--0.3\\%/cm in dose and 0.2\\%--0.4\\%/cm in\nRBE-weighted dose, depending on energy and range-modulation width. This\ntranslates into reduction of RBE-weighted dose by up to 3\\% in extreme cases.\nIn the treatment-planning study, however, the effect on RBE-weighted dose to\ntumor was typically within 1\\% reduction. \\item[Conclusions] The extra\nattenuation of primary carbon ions in PE was partly compensated by increased\nsecondary particles for tumor dose. In practical situations, the PE range\ncompensators would normally cause only marginal errors as compared to intrinsic\nuncertainties in treatment planning, patient setup, beam delivery, and clinical\nresponse.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a notion of a left-symmetric algebroid, which is\na generalization of a left-symmetric algebra from a vector space to a vector\nbundle. The left multiplication gives rise to a representation of the\ncorresponding sub-adjacent Lie algebroid. We construct left-symmetric\nalgebroids from $\\mathcal O$-operators on Lie algebroids. We study phase spaces\nof Lie algebroids in terms of left-symmetric algebroids. Representations of\nleft-symmetric algebroids are studied in detail. At last, we study deformations\nof left-symmetric algebroids, which could be controlled by the second\ncohomology class in the deformation cohomology.\n", "  The maximum entropy principle (MEP) is a method for obtaining the most likely\ndistribution functions of observables from statistical systems, by maximizing\nentropy under constraints. The MEP has found hundreds of applications in\nergodic and Markovian systems in statistical mechanics, information theory, and\nstatistics. For several decades there exists an ongoing controversy whether the\nnotion of the maximum entropy principle can be extended in a meaningful way to\nnon-extensive, non-ergodic, and complex statistical systems and processes. In\nthis paper we start by reviewing how Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy is related\nto multiplicities of independent random processes. We then show how the\nrelaxation of independence naturally leads to the most general entropies that\nare compatible with the first three Shannon-Khinchin axioms, the\n(c,d)-entropies. We demonstrate that the MEP is a perfectly consistent concept\nfor non-ergodic and complex statistical systems if their relative entropy can\nbe factored into a generalized multiplicity and a constraint term. The problem\nof finding such a factorization reduces to finding an appropriate\nrepresentation of relative entropy in a linear basis. In a particular example\nwe show that path-dependent random processes with memory naturally require\nspecific generalized entropies. The example is the first exact derivation of a\ngeneralized entropy from the microscopic properties of a path-dependent random\nprocess.\n", "  The state of health of patients is typically not characterized by a single\ndisease alone but by multiple (comorbid) medical conditions. These\ncomorbidities may depend strongly on age and gender. We propose a specific\nphenomenological comorbidity network of human diseases that is based on medical\nclaims data of the entire population of Austria. The network is constructed\nfrom a two-layer multiplex network, where in one layer the links represent the\nconditional probability for a comorbidity, and in the other the links contain\nthe respective statistical significance. We show that the network undergoes\ndramatic structural changes across the lifetime of patients.Disease networks\nfor children consist of a single, strongly inter-connected cluster. During\nadolescence and adulthood further disease clusters emerge that are related to\nspecific classes of diseases, such as circulatory, mental, or genitourinary\ndisorders.For people above 65 these clusters start to merge and highly\nconnected hubs dominate the network. These hubs are related to hypertension,\nchronic ischemic heart diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. We\nintroduce a simple diffusion model to understand the spreading of diseases on\nthe disease network at the population level. For the first time we are able to\nshow that patients predominantly develop diseases which are in close\nnetwork-proximity to disorders that they already suffer. The model explains\nmore than 85 % of the variance of all disease incidents in the population. The\npresented methodology could be of importance for anticipating age-dependent\ndisease-profiles for entire populations, and for validation and of prevention\nschemes.\n", "  Listening habits are strongly influenced by two opposing aspects, the desire\nfor variety and the demand for uniformity in music. In this work we quantify\nthese two notions in terms of musical instrumentation and production\ntechnologies that are typically involved in crafting popular music. We assign a\n\"complexity value\" to each music style. A style is complex if it shows the\nproperty of having both high variety and low uniformity in instrumentation. We\nfind a strong inverse relation between variety and uniformity of music styles\nthat is remarkably stable over the last half century. Individual styles,\nhowever, show dramatic changes in their \"complexity\" during that period. Styles\nlike \"new wave\" or \"disco\" quickly climbed towards higher complexity in the 70s\nand fell back to low complexity levels shortly afterwards, whereas styles like\n\"folk rock\" remained at constant high complexity levels. We show that changes\nin the complexity of a style are related to its number of sales and to the\nnumber of artists contributing to that style. As a style attracts a growing\nnumber of artists, its instrumentational variety usually increases. At the same\ntime the instrumentational uniformity of a style decreases, i.e. a unique\nstylistic and increasingly complex expression pattern emerges. In contrast,\nalbum sales of a given style typically increase with decreasing complexity.\nThis can be interpreted as music becoming increasingly formulaic once\ncommercial or mainstream success sets in.\n", "  We derive a two-layer multiplex Kuramoto model from weakly coupled\nWilson-Cowan oscillators on a cortical network with inhibitory synaptic time\ndelays. Depending on the coupling strength and a phase shift parameter, related\nto cerebral blood flow and GABA concentration, respectively, we numerically\nidentify three macroscopic phases: unsynchronized, synchronized, and chaotic\ndynamics. These correspond to physiological background-, epileptic seizure-,\nand resting-state cortical activity, respectively. We also observe frequency\nsuppression at the transition from resting-state to seizure activity.\n", "  In many different fields of science, it is useful to characterize physical\nstates and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory\nof communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent\nexamples. Questions addressed by a theory of resources include: Which resources\ncan be converted into which other ones? What is the rate at which arbitrarily\nmany copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of\nanother? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible?\nHow does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical\ndefinition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general\ntheorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of\nprocesses wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable\nat no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes\ncan be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource\ntheories fit into our framework. Our abstract characterization of resource\ntheories is a first step in a larger project of identifying universal features\nand principles of resource theories. In this vein, we identify a few general\nresults concerning resource convertibility.\n", "  The strong experimental evidence for the violation of Bell's inequalities is\nwidely interpreted as the ultimate proof of the impossibility to describe\nBell's polarization states of two entangled particles in terms of a local and\nrealistic statistical model of hidden variables in which the observers are free\nto choose the settings of their measurements. In this paper we note, however,\nthat Bell's theorem relies crucially on a fourth implicit theoretical\nassumption, in addition to the explicit hypotheses of locality, physical\nrealism and 'free will'. Namely, we note that the proof of Bell's inequalities\nfor generic models of hidden variables implicitly assumes that there exists an\nabsolute reference frame of angular coordinates, with respect to which we can\ndefine the polarization properties of the hidden configurations of the pair of\nparticles. This implicit additional assumption, however, is not required by any\nfundamental physical principle and, indeed, it may be incorrect if the hidden\nconfiguration of the pair of entangled particles breaks the rotational symmetry\nalong an otherwise arbitrary direction. We explicitly show that by giving up to\nthis additional implicit assumption it is possible to build a local and\nrealistic model of hidden variables for Bell's polarization states, which\ncomplies with the demands of 'free-will' and fully reproduces the quantum\nmechanical predictions. The model presented here offers a new insight into the\nnotion of quantum entanglement and the role of measurements in the dynamics of\nquantum systems. It may help also to develop new tools for performing numerical\nsimulations of quantum systems.\n", "  Quantum superposition states are behind many of the curious phenomena\nexhibited by quantum systems, including Bell non-locality, quantum\ninterference, quantum computational speed-up, and the measurement problem. At\nthe same time, many qualitative properties of quantum superpositions can also\nbe observed in classical probability distributions leading to a suspicion that\nsuperpositions may be explicable as probability distributions over less\nproblematic states, that is, a suspicion that superpositions are\n\\emph{epistemic}. Here, it is proved that, for any quantum system of dimension\n$d>3$, this cannot be the case for almost all superpositions. Equivalently, any\nunderlying ontology must contain ontic superposition states. A related question\nconcerns the more general possibility that some pairs of non-orthogonal quantum\nstates $|\\psi\\rangle,|\\phi\\rangle$ could be ontologically indistinct (there are\nontological states which fail to distinguish between these quantum states). A\nsimilar method proves that if $|\\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle|^{2}\\in(0,\\frac{1}{4})$\nthen $|\\psi\\rangle,|\\phi\\rangle$ must approach ontological distinctness as\n$d\\rightarrow\\infty$. The robustness of these results to small experimental\nerror is also discussed.\n", "  We report modifications of the ferroelectric and electrocaloric properties of\nBaTiO$_3$ by defects. For this purpose, we have combined \\textit{ab\ninitio}-based molecular dynamics simulations with a simple model for defects.\nWe find that different kinds of defects modify the ferroelectric transition\ntemperatures and polarization, reduce the thermal hysteresis of the transition\nand are no obstacle for a large caloric response. For a locally reduced\npolarization the ferroelectric transition temperature and the adiabatic\nresponse are slightly reduced. For polar defects an intriguing picture emerges.\nThe transition temperature is increased by polar defects and the temperature\nrange of the large caloric response is broadened. Even more remarkable, we find\nan inverse caloric effect in a broad temperature range.\n", "  Over the past few years, there has been a growing interest in layered\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).\nMost studies so far have focused on the electronic and optoelectronic\nproperties of single-layer MoS2, whose band structure features a direct\nbandgap, in sharp contrast to the indirect bandgap of thicker MoS2. In this\npaper, we present a systematic study of the thickness-dependent electrical and\nthermoelectric properties of few-layer MoS2. We observe that the electrical\nconductivity () increases as we reduce the thickness of MoS2 and peaks at about\ntwo layers, with six-time larger conductivity than our thickest sample\n(23-layer MoS2). Using a back-gate voltage, we modulate the Fermi energy () of\nthe sample where an increase in the Seebeck coefficient () is observed with\ndecreasing gate voltage () towards the subthreshold (OFF state) of the device,\nreaching as large as in a four-layer MoS2. While previous reports have focused\non a single-layer MoS2 and measured Seebeck coefficient in the OFF state, which\nhas vanishing electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor (), we\nshow that MoS2-based devices in their ON state can have as large as in the\ntwo-layer sample. The increases with decreasing thickness then drops abruptly\nfrom double-layer to single-layer MoS2, a feature we suggest as due to a change\nin the energy dependence of the electron mean-free-path according to our\ntheoretical calculation. Moreover, we show that care must be taken in\nthermoelectric measurements in the OFF state to avoid obtaining erroneously\nlarge Seebeck coefficients when the channel resistance is very high. Our study\npaves the way towards a more comprehensive examination of the thermoelectric\nperformance of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors.\n", "  In the context of conformal field theories in general space-time dimension,\nwe find all the possible singularities of the conformal blocks as functions of\nthe scaling dimension $\\Delta$ of the exchanged operator. In particular, we\nargue, using representation theory of parabolic Verma modules, that in odd\nspacetime dimension the singularities are only simple poles. We discuss how to\nuse this information to write recursion relations that determine the conformal\nblocks. We first recover the recursion relation introduced in 1307.6856 for\nconformal blocks of external scalar operators. We then generalize this\nrecursion relation for the conformal blocks associated to the four point\nfunction of three scalar and one vector operator. Finally we specialize to the\ncase in which the vector operator is a conserved current.\n", "  We consider a simple model of communities interacting via bilinear terms.\nAfter analyzing the thermal equilibrium case, which can be described by an\nHamiltonian, we introduce the dynamics that, for Ising-like variables, reduces\nto a Glauber-like dynamics. We analyze and compare four different versions of\nthe dynamics: flow (differential equations), map (discrete-time dynamics),\nlocal-time update flow, and local-time update map. The presence of only\nbilinear interactions prevent the flow cases to develop any dynamical\ninstability, the system converging always to the thermal equilibrium. The\nsituation is different for the map when unfriendly couplings are involved,\nwhere period-two oscillations arise. In the case of the map with local-time\nupdates, oscillations of any period and chaos can arise as a consequence of the\nreciprocal \"tension\" accumulated among the communities during their sleeping\ntime interval. The resulting chaos can be of two kinds: true chaos\ncharacterized by positive Lyapunov exponent and bifurcation cascades, or\nmarginal chaos characterized by zero Lyapunov exponent and critical continuous\nregions.\n", "  Exactly solvable frustrated quantum spin models consisting of a diamond unit\nstructure are presented. The ground states are characterized by tetramer-dimer\nstates with a macroscopic degeneracy in a certain range of isotropic exchange\ninteraction. The lower bound of the excitation gap is exactly calculated to be\nfinite and the bulk entropy in the limit of zero temperature remains finite\ndepending on the shape of the boundary of system. Residual entropy is in a\nrange of 0~6.1% of the entropy at high temperature for hexagonal diamond\nlattice and 0~8.4% for square diamond lattice. These diamond lattices are\ngeneralized to any dimensions and it is likely to be synthesized\nexperimentally.\n", "  We propose a new efficient algorithm to obtain the locally minimal generating\nset of the syzygies for an ideal, i.e. a generating set whose proper subsets\ncannot be generating sets. Syzygy is a concept widely used in the current study\nof scattering amplitudes. This new algorithm can deal with more syzygies\neffectively because a new generation of syzygies is obtained in each step and\nthe irreducibility of this generation is also verified in the process. This\nefficient algorithm can also be applied in getting the syzygies for the\nmodules. We also show a typical example to illustrate the potential application\nof this method in scattering amplitudes, especially the Integral-By-Part(IBP)\nrelations of the characteristic two-loop diagrams in the Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  Sensitive detection of weak magnetic moments is an essential capability in\nmany areas of nanoscale science and technology, including nanomagnetism,\nquantum readout of spins, and nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging. Here, we\nshow that the write head of a commercial hard drive may enable significant\nadvances in nanoscale spin detection. By approaching a sharp diamond tip to\nwithin 5 nm from the pole and measuring the induced diamagnetic moment with a\nnanomechanical force transducer, we demonstrate a spin sensitivity of 0.032\nBohr magnetons per root Hz, equivalent to 21 proton magnetic moments. The high\nsensitivity is enabled in part by the pole's strong magnetic gradient of up to\n28 million Tesla per meter and in part by the absence of non-contact friction\ndue to the extremely flat writer surface. In addition, we demonstrate\nquantitative imaging of the pole field with about 10 nm spatial resolution. We\nforesee diverse applications for write heads in experimental condensed matter\nphysics, especially in spintronics, ultrafast spin manipulation, and mesoscopic\nphysics.\n", "  Accurate treatment of amide resonance is important in electronic structure\ncalculation of protein, for Resonance-Assisted Hydrogen Bonding in the hydrogen\nbonded chains of backbone amides of protein secondary structures such as beta\nsheets and alpha helices is determined by amide resonance. Variation in amide\nresonance is the means by which the hydrogen bonding in these chains is\ncooperative.\n  Amide carbonyl orbitals are revealed by Natural Bond Orbital, NBO, analysis\nto substantially maintain sigma/pi separation in the presence of torsional\nhyperconjugative interactions with wavefunction methods but not with\nestablished Density Functional Theory, DFT, methods. This DFT error is most\npronounced with small basis sets such as are used with DFT for proteins to\nreduce the basis function count. This error disturbs calculation of a range of\namide donor-acceptor and steric interactions.\n  This finding has important implications for the selection of electronic\nstructure methods and basis sets for protein calculations. For example, great\ncaution is needed in interpreting the results of applying established DFT\nmethods to proteins containing any beta sheets. We recommend that every protein\nDFT calculation be accompanied by NBO assessment of maintenance of amide\ncarbonyl sigma/pi separation and absence of carbonyl bond bending. Further, we\npropose that these metrics be standard benchmarks of electronic structure\nmethods and basis sets.\n", "  We present the first detailed computation of the conversion of a bound muon\ninto an electron mediated by a doubly charged $SU(2)$ singlet scalar. Although\nsuch particles are not too exotic, up to now their contribution to $\\mu$-$e$\nconversion is unknown. We close this gap by presenting a detailed calculation,\nwhich will allow the reader not only to fully comprehend the discussion but\nalso to generalise our results to similar cases if needed. We furthermore\ncompare the predictions, for both the general case and for an example model\nfeaturing a neutrino mass at 2-loop level, to current experimental data and\nfuture sensitivities. We show that, depending on the explicit values of the\ncouplings as well as on the actual future limits on the branching ratio,\n$\\mu$-$e$ conversion may potentially yield a lower limit on the doubly charged\nsinglet scalar mass which is stronger than what could be obtained by colliders.\nOur results considerably strengthen the case for low-energy lepton flavour\nviolation searches being a very valuable addition to collider experiments.\n", "  The discussions on the connection between gravity and thermodynamics attract\nmuch attention recently. We consider a static self-gravitating perfect fluid\nsystem in $f(R)$ gravity, which is an important theory could explain the\naccelerated expansion of the universe. We first show that the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation of $f(R)$ theories can be obtained by\nthermodynamical method in spherical symmetric spacetime. Then we prove that the\nmaximum entropy principle is also valid for $f(R)$ gravity in general static\nspacetimes beyond spherical symmetry. The result shows that if the constraint\nequation is satisfied and the temperature of fluid obeys Tolmans law, the\nextrema of total entropy implies other components of gravitational equations.\nConversely, if $f(R)$ gravitational equation hold, the total entropy of the\nfluid should be extremum. Our work suggests a general and solid connection\nbetween $f(R)$ gravity and thermodynamics.\n", "  Given a $M\\times M$ Hermitian matrix $\\mathcal{H}$ with possibly degenerate\neigenvalues $\\mathcal{E}_1 < \\mathcal{E}_2 < \\mathcal{E}_3< \\dots$, we provide,\nin the limit $M\\to\\infty$, a lower bound for the gap $\\mu_2 = \\mathcal{E}_2 -\n\\mathcal{E}_1$ assuming that (i) the eigenvector (eigenvectors) associated to\n$\\mathcal{E}_1$ is ergodic (are all ergodic) and (ii) the off-diagonal terms of\n$\\mathcal{H}$ vanish for $M\\to\\infty$ more slowly than $M^{-2}$. Under these\nhypotheses, we find $\\varliminf_{M\\to\\infty} \\mu_2 \\geq \\varlimsup_{M\\to\\infty}\n\\min_{n} \\mathcal{H}_{n,n}$. This general result turns out to be important for\nupper bounding the relaxation time of linear master equations characterized by\na matrix equal, or isospectral, to $\\mathcal{H}$. As an application, we\nconsider symmetric random walks with infinitesimal jump rates and show that the\nrelaxation time is upper bounded by the configurations (or nodes) with minimal\ndegree.\n", "  We study the first law of black hole thermodynamics in the presence of\nsurrounding gravitational fields and argue that variations of these fields are\nnaturally incorporated in the first law by defining gravitational tension or\ngravitational binding energy. We demonstrate that this notion can also be\napplied in Anti-de Sitter spacetime, in which the surrounding gravitational\nfield is sourced by a cosmological fluid, therefore showing that spacetime\nvolume and gravitational tension encode the same physics as spacetime pressure\nand black hole volume. We furthermore show that it is possible to introduce a\ndefinition of spacetime pressure and black hole volume for any spacetime with\ncharacteristic length scales which does not necessarily require a cosmological\nconstant sourcing Einstein equations. However, we show that black hole volume\nis non-universal in the flat spacetime limit, questioning its significance. We\nillustrate these ideas by studying the resulting black hole volume of\nKaluza-Klein black holes and of a toy model for a black hole binary system in\nfive spacetime dimensions (the black saturn solution) as well as of several\nnovel perturbative black hole solutions. These include the higher-dimensional\nKerr-Newman solution in Anti-de Sitter spacetime as well as other black holes\nin plane wave and Lifshitz spacetimes.\n", "  The closure of cooperative chains of Hydrogen Bonding, HB, to form cycles can\nenhance cooperativity. Cycles of charge transfer can balance charge into and\nout of every site, eliminating the charge build-up that limits the\ncooperativity of open unidirectional cooperative chains. If cycles of\ncooperative HB exist in proteins, these could be expected to be significant in\nprotein structure and function in ways described below. We find no mention of\nan example of this kind of cycle in the literature. We investigate whether\ncooperative HB cycles not traversing solvent, ligand or modified residues occur\nin proteins by means including search of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\nspectroscopy entries of the Protein Data Bank.\n  For the direct interactions of inter-amide HB, when the energy associated\nwith Natural Bond Orbital, NBO, steric exchange is deducted from that of NBO\ndonor-acceptor interactions, the result is close to zero, so that HB is not\nprimarily due to the sum of direct inter-amide NBO interactions. The NBO\nbinding energy is primarily associated with the increase in resonance of the\namides, a consequence of which is that the majority of the NBO binding energy\nis susceptible to variation by electrostatic field with component parallel or\nantiparallel to an amide C-N bond.\n  The question of what geometry most favours HB in amides is revisited with\nemphasis on the inequivalence of amide/carbonyl oxygen lone pairs.\n  A possible avenue for the design of HB-chaining polymers with improved\nstability is discussed.\n", "  Recently the power of positive partial transpose preserving (PPTp) and\nno-signalling (NS) codes in quantum communication has been studied. We continue\nwith this line of research and show that the NS/PPTp/NS$\\cap$PPTp codes\nassisted zero-error quantum capacity depends only on the non-commutative\nbipartite graph of the channel and the one-shot case can be computed\nefficiently by semidefinite programming (SDP). As an example, the activated\nPPTp codes assisted zero-error quantum capacity is carefully studied. We then\npresent a general SDP upper bound $Q_\\Gamma$ of quantum capacity and show it is\nalways smaller than or equal to the \"Partial transposition bound\" introduced by\nHolevo and Werner, and the inequality could be strict. This upper bound is\nfound to be additive, and thus is an upper bound of the potential PPTp assisted\nquantum capacity as well. We further demonstrate that $Q_\\Gamma$ is strictly\nbetter than several previously known upper bounds for an explicit class of\nquantum channels. Finally, we show that $Q_\\Gamma$ can be used to bound the\nsuper-activation of quantum capacity.\n", "  Coupling mechanical degrees of freedom with plasmonic resonances has\npotential applications in optomechanics, sensing, and active plasmonics. Here\nwe demonstrate a suspended two-wire plasmonic nano-antenna acting like a\nnano-electrometer. The antenna wires are supported and electrically connected\nvia thin leads without disturbing the antenna resonance. As a voltage is\napplied, equal charges are induced on both antenna wires. The resulting\nequilibrium between the repulsive Coulomb force and the restoring elastic\nbending force enables us to precisely control the gap size. As a result the\nresonance wavelength and the field enhancement of the suspended optical\nnano-antenna (SONA) can be reversibly tuned. Our experiments highlight the\npotential to realize large bandwidth optical nanoelectromechanical systems\n(NEMS).\n", "  We propose a new principle of operation in vacuum electron-beam-based\noscillators that leads to a low beam current for starting oscillations. The\nprinciple is based on super synchronous operation of an electron beam\ninteracting with four degenerate electromagnetic modes in a slow-wave structure\n(SWS). The four mode super synchronous regime is associated with a very special\ndegeneracy condition in the dispersion diagram of a cold periodic SWS called\ndegenerate band edge (DBE). This regime features a giant group delay in the\nfinitelength SWS and low starting-oscillation beam current. The starting beam\ncurrent is at least an order of magnitude smaller compared to a conventional\nbackward wave oscillator (BWO) of the same length. As a representative example\nwe consider a SWS conceived by a periodically-loaded metallic waveguide\nsupporting a DBE, and investigate starting-oscillation conditions using Pierce\ntheory generalized to coupled transmission lines (CTL). The proposed super\nsynchronism regime can be straightforwardly adapted to waveguide geometries\nothers than the periodically-loaded waveguide considered here since DBE is a\ngeneral property that can be realized in a variety of structures.\n", "  The flavour changing decays of the top quark are severely suppressed in the\nStandard Model by virtue of the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani mechanism. Many\nbeyond Standard Model extensions predict the decay rates at a level that is\nobservable in the LHC. We perform a complete one-loop calculation of the\nflavour changing top quark decays $t\\to c\\gamma$ and $t\\to ch$ in the universal\nextra dimensional model. Apart from considering the decay rates in the minimal\nversion of the model, we also calculate the rates in the non-minimal scenario\nwhere the presence of boundary localised terms interestingly modify the set-up.\nWe find that the decay rates in the minimal variant of the model do not change\nmuch from their Standard Model values. In the non-minimal version of this\nmodel, these decay rates can be higher for specific choices of the boundary\nlocalised parameters for a certain range of inverse compactification radius.\nBut these model parameters lead to Kaluza-Klein particle masses that are in\ntension with various searches at the LHC.\n", "  One of the current major challenges surrounding the use of quantum annealers\nfor solving practical optimization problems is their inability to encode even\nmoderately sized problems---the main reason for this being the rigid layout of\ntheir quantum bits as well as their sparse connectivity. In particular, the\nimplementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of\npractical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful\npenalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian --- a technique that often requires an\n`all-to-all' connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique\ndesigned to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on\nthe construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of\nthe problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose\ngeneral guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an\narbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our\nmethod by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism,\nnot-all-equal 3SAT, and the so-called Lechner, Hauke and Zoller constraints. We\nalso discuss the significance of our approach in the context of current and\nfuture experimental quantum annealers.\n", "  We apply noise thermometry to characterize charge and thermoelectric\ntransport in single InAs nanowires (NWs) at a bath temperature of 4.2 K. Shot\nnoise measurements identify elastic diffusive transport in our NWs with\nnegligible electron-phonon interaction. This enables us to set up a measurement\nof the diffusion thermopower. Unlike in previous approaches, we make use of a\nprimary electronic noise thermometry to calibrate a thermal bias across the NW.\nIn particular, this enables us to apply a contact heating scheme, which is much\nmore efficient in creating the thermal bias as compared to conventional\nsubstrate heating. The measured thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient exhibits\nstrong mesoscopic fluctuations in dependence on the back-gate voltage that is\nused to tune the NW carrier density. We analyze the transport and\nthermoelectric data in terms of approximate Mott's thermopower relation and to\nevaluate a gate-voltage to Fermi energy conversion factor.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites with general formula $APbX_4$ are attracting\nincreasing interest as solution processable, white-light emissive materials.\nRecent studies have shown that their broadband emission is related to the\nformation of intra-gap color centers; however, the nature and dynamics of the\nemissive species have remained elusive. Here we show that the broadband\nphotoluminescence of the 2D perovskites $(EDBE)PbCl_4$ and $(EDBE)PbBr_4$ stems\nfrom the localization of small polarons within the lattice distortion field.\nUsing a combination of spectroscopic techniques and first-principles\ncalculations, we infer the formation of ${Pb_2}^{3+}$, $Pb^{3+}$, and ${X_2}^-$\n(where X=Cl or Br) species confined within the inorganic perovskite framework.\nDue to strong Coulombic interactions, these species retain their original\nexcitonic character and form self-trapped polaron-excitons acting as radiative\ncolor centers. These findings are expected to be applicable to a broad class of\nwhite-light emitting perovskites with large polaron relaxation energy.\n", "  Gravity plays a determining role in the evolution of the molecular ISM. In\n\\citet{2016arXiv160304342L}, we proposed a measure called gravitational energy\nspectrum to quantify the importance of gravity on multiple physical scales. In\nthis work, using a wavelet-based decomposition technique, we derive the\ngravitational energy spectra of the Orion A and the Orion B molecular cloud\nfrom observational data. The gravitational energy spectra exhibit\npower-law-like behaviours. From a few pc down to $\\sim 0.1 $ pc scale, the\nOrion A and Orion B molecular cloud have $E_{\\rm p}(k)\\sim k^{-1.88}$ and\n$E_{\\rm p}(k)\\sim k^{-2.09}$, respectively. These scaling exponents are close\nto the scaling exponents of the kinetic energy power spectrum of compressible\nturbulence (where $E\\sim k^{-2}$), with a near-equipartition of turbulent\nversus gravitational energy on multiple scales. This provides a clear evidence\nthat gravity is able to counteract effectively against turbulent motion for\nthese length scales. The results confirm our earlier analytical estimates. For\nthe Orion A molecular cloud, gravity inevitably dominates over turbulence\ninside the cloud. Our results provide a clear observational proof that gravity\nis playing a determining role in the evolution these molecular clouds from the\ncloud scale down to $\\sim 0.1\\;\\rm pc$. { However, turbulence is likely to\ndominate in clouds like California. } The method is general and should be\napplicable to all the astrophysical problems where gravity plays a role.\n", "  Ward identities in the most general \"network matrix model\" can be described\nin terms of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebras (DIM). This confirms an expectation\nthat such algebras and their various limits/reductions are the relevant\nsubstitutes/deformations of the Virasoro/W-algebra for (q, t) and (q_1, q_2,\nq_3) deformed network matrix models. Exhaustive for these purposes should be\nthe Pagoda triple-affine elliptic DIM, which corresponds to networks associated\nwith 6d gauge theories with adjoint matter (double elliptic systems). We\nprovide some details on elliptic qq-characters.\n", "  The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes observed\nthe BL Lac object H1722+119 (redshift unknown) for six consecutive nights\nbetween 2013 May 17 and 22, for a total of 12.5 h. The observations were\ntriggered by high activity in the optical band measured by the KVA (Kungliga\nVetenskapsakademien) telescope. The source was for the first time detected in\nthe very high energy (VHE, $E > 100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-ray band with a statistical\nsignificance of 5.9 $\\sigma$. The integral flux above 150 GeV is estimated to\nbe $(2.0\\pm 0.5)$ per cent of the Crab Nebula flux. We used contemporaneous\nhigh energy (HE, 100 MeV $ < E < 100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-ray observations from\nFermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) to estimate the redshift of the source. Within\nthe framework of the current extragalactic background light models, we estimate\nthe redshift to be $z = 0.34 \\pm 0.15$. Additionally, we used contemporaneous\nX-ray to radio data collected by the instruments on board the Swift satellite,\nthe KVA, and the OVRO (Owens Valley Radio Observatory) telescope to study\nmultifrequency characteristics of the source. We found no significant temporal\nvariability of the flux in the HE and VHE bands. The flux in the optical and\nradio wavebands, on the other hand, did vary with different patterns. The\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of H1722+119 shows surprising behaviour in\nthe $\\sim 3\\times10^{14} - 10^{18}$ Hz frequency range. It can be modelled\nusing an inhomogeneous helical jet synchrotron self-Compton model.\n", "  We propose a microwave frequency single photon transistor which can operate\nunder continuous wave probing, and represents an efficient single microwave\nphoton detector. It can be realized using an impedance matched system of a\nthree level artificial ladder-type atom coupled to two microwave cavities\nconnected to input/output waveguides. Using a classical drive on the upper\ntransition, we find parameter space where a single photon control pulse\nincident on one of cavities can be fully absorbed into hybridized excited\nstates. This subsequently leads to series of quantum jumps in the upper\nmanifold and the appearance of a photon flux leaving the second cavity through\na separate input/output port. The proposal does not require time variation of\nthe probe signals, thus corresponding to a passive version of single photon\ntransistor. The resulting device is robust to qubit dephasing processes,\npossesses low dark count rate for large anharmonicity, and can be readily\nimplemented using current technology.\n", "  This is the third in a series of papers that develop a new and flexible model\nto predict weak-lensing (WL) peak counts, which have been shown to be a very\nvaluable non-Gaussian probe of cosmology. In this paper, we compare the\ncosmological information extracted from WL peak counts using different\nfiltering techniques of the galaxy shear data, including linear filtering with\na Gaussian and two compensated filters (the starlet wavelet and the aperture\nmass), and the nonlinear filtering method MRLens. We present improvements to\nour model that account for realistic survey conditions, which are masks,\nshear-to-convergence transformations, and non-constant noise. We create\nsimulated peak counts from our stochastic model, from which we obtain\nconstraints on the matter density $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$, the power spectrum\nnormalisation $\\sigma_8$, and the dark-energy parameter $w_0$. We use two\nmethods for parameter inference, a copula likelihood, and approximate Bayesian\ncomputation (ABC). We measure the contour width in the\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$-$\\sigma_8$ degeneracy direction and the figure of merit to\ncompare parameter constraints from different filtering techniques. We find that\nstarlet filtering outperforms the Gaussian kernel, and that including peak\ncounts from different smoothing scales helps to lift parameter degeneracies.\nPeak counts from different smoothing scales with a compensated filter show very\nlittle cross-correlation, and adding information from different scales can\ntherefore strongly enhance the available information. Measuring peak counts\nseparately from different scales yields tighter constraints than using a\ncombined peak histogram from a single map that includes multiscale information.\nOur results suggest that a compensated filter function with counts included\nseparately from different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on\ncosmological parameters from WL peaks.\n", "  We derive a family of exact solutions for bi-metric gravity with an exchange\nsymmetry between the two metrics. In this two-parameter family of solutions the\ngravitational field is sourced by a time-independent massless scalar field. We\nfind that the only limit in which the scalar field entirely vanishes is flat\nspace. The regular Schwarzschild-solution is left with a scalar field hidden in\nthe second metric's sector.\n", "  We discuss the energetic cost of superadiabatic models of quantum\ncomputation. Specifically, we investigate the energy-time complementarity in\ngeneral transitionless controlled evolutions and in shortcuts to the adiabatic\nquantum search over an unstructured list. We show that the additional energy\nresources required by superadiabaticity for arbitrary controlled evolutions can\nbe minimized by using probabilistic dynamics, so that the optimal success\nprobability is fixed by the choice of the evolution time. In the case of analog\nquantum search, we show that the superadiabatic approach induces a non-oracular\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian, with the same energy-time complexity as\nequivalent adiabatic implementations.\n", "  We report the synthesis of high quality single crystals of BaMnBi2 and\ninvestigate the transport properties of the samples. The Hall data reveals\nelectron-type carriers and a mobility mu(5K) =1500cm2/Vs. The temperature\ndependence of magnetization displays behavior that is different from CaMnBi2 or\nSrMnBi2 , which suggests the possible different magnetic structure of BaMnBi2.\nAngle-dependent magnetoresistance reveals the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi\nsurface. A crossover from semiclassical MR-H2 dependence in low field to MR-H\ndependence in high field is observed in transverse magnetoresistance. Our\nresults indicate the anisotropic Dirac fermion states in BaMnBi2.\n", "  Charged Higgs bosons produced in association with a single top quark and\ndecaying via $H^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau\\nu$ are searched for with the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC, using proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nTeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The\nfinal state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic $\\tau$ decay and\nmissing transverse momentum, as well as a hadronically decaying top quark,\nresulting in the absence of high-transverse-momentum electrons and muons. The\ndata are found to be consistent with the expected background from Standard\nModel processes. A statistical analysis leads to $95\\%$ confidence-level upper\nlimits on the production cross section times branching fraction, $\\sigma(pp\n\\rightarrow [b]t H^{\\pm}) \\times \\mbox{BR}(H^{\\pm} \\rightarrow \\tau\\nu)$,\nbetween 1.9 pb and 15 fb, for charged Higgs boson masses ranging from 200 to\n2000 GeV. The exclusion limits for this search surpass those obtained with the\nproton-proton collision data recorded at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV.\n", "  Most warm Jupiters (gas-giant planets with $0.1~{\\rm AU}\\lesssim a \\lesssim1$\nAU) have pericenter distances that are too large for significant orbital\nmigration by tidal friction. We study the possibility that the warm Jupiters\nare undergoing secular eccentricity oscillations excited by an outer companion\n(a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this\nmodel the warm Jupiters migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of\nthe oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically\nobserved at much lower eccentricities. We show that the steady-state\neccentricity distribution of the warm Jupiters migrating by this mechanism is\napproximately flat, which is consistent with the observed distribution if and\nonly if we restrict the sample to warm Jupiters that have outer companions\ndetected by radial-velocity surveys. The eccentricity distribution of warm\nJupiters without companions exhibits a peak at low eccentricities ($e\\lesssim\n0.2$) that must be explained by a different formation mechanism. Based on a\npopulation-synthesis study we find that high-eccentricity migration excited by\nan outer planetary companion (i) can account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the warm\nJupiters and most of the warm Jupiters with $e\\gtrsim 0.4$, a fraction that is\nconsistent with the observed population of warm Jupiters with outer companions;\n(ii) can produce most of the observed population of hot Jupiters, with a\nsemimajor axis distribution that matches the observations, but fails to account\nadequately for $\\sim 60\\%$ of hot Jupiters with projected obliquities $\\lesssim\n20^\\circ$. Thus $\\sim 20\\%$ of the warm Jupiters and $\\sim 60\\%$ of the hot\nJupiters can be produced by high-eccentricity migration. We also provide\npredictions for the expected mutual inclinations and spin-orbit angles of the\nplanetary systems with hot and warm Jupiters produced by high-eccentricity\nmigration.\n", "  We investigate transport and shot noise in lateral N-TI-S contacts, where N\nis a normal metal, TI is a Bi-based three dimensional topological insulator (3D\nTI), and S is an s-type superconductor. In normal state, the devices are in the\nelastic diffusive transport regime, as demonstrated by a nearly universal value\nof the shot noise Fano factor $F_{\\rm N}\\approx1/3$ in magnetic field and in\nreference normal contact. In the absence of magnetic field, we identify the\nAndreev reflection (AR) regime, which gives rise to the effective charge\ndoubling in shot noise measurements. Surprisingly, the Fano factor $F_{\\rm\nAR}\\approx0.22\\pm0.02$ is considerably reduced in the AR regime compared to\n$F_{\\rm N}$, in contrast to previous AR experiments in normal metals and\nsemiconductors. We suggest that this effect is related to a finite thermal\nconduction of the proximized, superconducting TI owing to a residual density of\nstates at low energies.\n", "  The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) refers to the generation of a spin current as a\nresult of a temperature gradient in magnetic materials including insulators.\nThe SSE is applicable to thermoelectric generation because the thermally\ngenerated spin current can be converted into a charge current via spin-orbit\ninteraction in conductive materials adjacent to the magnets. The\ninsulator-based SSE device exhibits unconventional characteristics potentially\nuseful for thermoelectric applications, such as simple structure, device-design\nflexibility, and convenient scaling capability. In this article, we review\nrecent studies on the SSE from the viewpoint of thermoelectric applications.\nFirstly, we introduce the thermoelectric generation process and measurement\nconfiguration of the SSE, followed by showing fundamental characteristics of\nthe SSE device. Secondly, a theory of the thermoelectric conversion efficiency\nof the SSE device is presented, which clarifies the difference between the SSE\nand conventional thermoelectric effects and the efficiency limit of the SSE\ndevice. Finally, we show preliminary demonstrations of the SSE in various\ndevice structures for future thermoelectric applications and discuss prospects\nof the SSE-based thermoelectric technologies.\n", "  We investigate collective modes in three dimensional (3D) gapless multi-Weyl\nsemimetals with anisotropic energy band dispersions (i.e., $E\\sim \\sqrt{\nk_{\\parallel}^{2J} + k_z^2}$, where $k_{\\parallel}$ and $k_z$ are wave vectors\nand $J$ is a positive integer). For comparison, we also consider the gapless\nsemimetals with the isotropic band dispersions (i.e., $E\\sim k^J$). We\ncalculate analytically long-wavelength plasma frequencies incorporating\ninterband transitions and chiral properties of carriers. For both the isotropic\nand anisotropic cases, we find that interband transitions and chirality lead to\nthe depolarization shift of plasma frequencies. For the isotropic parabolic\nband dispersion (i.e., $N=2$, $E\\sim k^2$), the long-wavelength plasma\nfrequencies lie outside the single particle excitation regions for all carrier\ndensities, and thus the plasmons do not decay via Landau damping. For the\nhigher-order band dispersions ($N \\ge 3$) the long-wavelength plasmons\nexperience damping below a critical density. For systems with the anisotropic\ndispersion the density dependence of the long-wavelength plasma frequency along\nthe direction of non-linear dispersion behaves like that of the isotropic\nlinear band model ($N=1$), while along the direction of linear dispersion it\nbehaves like that of the isotropic non-linear model ($N \\ge 2$). Plasmons along\nboth directions remain undamped over a broad range of densities due to the\nchirality induced depolarization shift. Our results provide a comprehensive\npicture of how band dispersion and chirality affect plasmon behaviors in 3D\ngapless chiral systems with the arbitrary band dispersion.\n", "  We briefly describe the construction of St\\\"{a}\\-kel-Killing and Killing-Yano\ntensors on toric Sasaki-Einstein manifolds without working out intricate\ngeneralized Killing equations. The integrals of geodesic motions are expressed\nin terms of Killing vectors and Kill\\-ing-Yano tensors of the homogeneous\nSasaki-Einstein space $T^{1,1}$. We discuss the integrability of geodesics and\nconstruct explicitly the action-angle variables. Two pairs of frequencies of\nthe geodesic motions are resonant giving way to chaotic behavior when the\nsystem is perturbed.\n", "  We employ a field-theoretical variational approach to study the behavior of\nionic solutions in the grand canonical ensemble. To describe properly the\nhardcore interactions between ions, we use a cutoff in Fourier space for the\nelectrostatic contribution of the grand potential and the Carnahan-Starling\nequation of state with a modified chemical potential for the pressure one. We\nfirst calibrate our method by comparing its predictions at room temperature\nwith Monte Carlo results for excess chemical potential and energy. We then\nvalidate our approach in the bulk phase by describing the classical \"ionic\nliquid-vapor\" phase transition induced by ionic correlations at low\ntemperature, before applying it to electrolytes at room temperature confined to\nnanopores embedded in a low dielectric medium and coupled to an external\nreservoir of ions. The ionic concentration in the nanopore is then correctly\ndescribed from very low bulk concentrations, where dielectric exclusion shifts\nthe transition up to room temperature for sufficiently tight nanopores, to high\nconcentrations where hardcore interactions dominate which, as expected, modify\nonly slightly this ionic \"capillary evaporation\".\n", "  It is widely believed that high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates\nemerges from doped Mott insulators. The physics of the parent state seems\ndeceivingly simple: The hopping of the electrons from site to site is\nprohibited because their on-site Coulomb repulsion U is larger than the kinetic\nenergy gain t. When doping these materials by inserting a small percentage of\nextra carriers, the electrons become mobile but the strong correlations from\nthe Mott state are thought to survive; inhomogeneous electronic order, a\nmysterious pseudogap and, eventually, superconductivity appear. How the\ninsertion of dopant atoms drives this evolution is not known, nor whether these\nphenomena are mere distractions specific to hole-doped cuprates or represent\nthe genuine physics of doped Mott insulators. Here, we visualize the evolution\nof the electronic states of (Sr1-xLax)2IrO4, which is an effective spin-1/2\nMott insulator like the cuprates, but is chemically radically different. Using\nspectroscopic-imaging STM, we find that for doping concentration of x=5%, an\ninhomogeneous, phase separated state emerges, with the nucleation of pseudogap\npuddles around clusters of dopant atoms. Within these puddles, we observe the\nsame glassy electronic order that is so iconic for the underdoped cuprates.\nFurther, we illuminate the genesis of this state using the unique possibility\nto localize dopant atoms on topographs in these samples. At low doping, we find\nevidence for much deeper trapping of carriers compared to the cuprates. This\nleads to fully gapped spectra with the chemical potential at mid-gap, which\nabruptly collapse at a threshold of around 4%. Our results clarify the melting\nof the Mott state, and establish phase separation and electronic order as\ngeneric features of doped Mott insulators.\n", "  We propose a dynamical scheme for measuring the full counting statistics in a\nmesoscopic conductor using an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The\nconductor couples capacitively to one arm of the interferometer and causes a\nphase shift which is proportional to the number of transferred charges.\nImportantly, the full counting statistics can be obtained from average current\nmeasurements at the outputs of the interferometer. The counting field can be\ncontrolled by varying the time delay between two separate voltage signals\napplied to the conductor and the interferometer, respectively. As a specific\napplication we consider measuring the entanglement entropy generated by\npartitioning electrons on a quantum point contact. Our scheme is robust against\nmoderate environmental dephasing and can be realized thanks to recent advances\nin giga-hertz quantum electronics.\n", "  The spin dynamics of Tb(OETAP)$_2$ single ion magnets was investigated by\nmeans of muon spin resonance ($\\mu$SR) both in the bulk material as well as\nwhen the system is embedded into PEDOT:PSS polymer conductor. The\ncharacteristic spin fluctuation time is characterized by a high temperature\nactivated trend, with an energy barrier around 320 K, and by a low temperature\ntunneling regime. When the single ion magnet is embedded into the polymer the\nenergy barrier only slightly decreases and the fluctuation time remains of the\nsame order of magnitude even at low temperature. This finding shows that these\nsingle molecule magnets preserve their characteristics which, if combined with\nthose of the conducting polymer, result in a hybrid material of potential\ninterest for organic spintronics.\n", "  Spin-liquid states are often described as the antithesis of magnetic order.\nRecently, however, it has been proposed that in certain frustrated magnets the\nmagnetic degrees of freedom may \"fragment\" in such a way as to give rise to a\ncoexistence of spin liquid and ordered phases. Recent neutron-scattering\nresults [S. Petit, E. Lhotel, B. Canals, M. Ciomaga Hatnean, J. Ollivier, H.\nMuttka, E. Ressouche, A. R. Wildes, M. R. Lees, and G. Balakrishnan, Nat. Phys.\n12, 746 (2016)] suggest that this scenario may be realized in the pyrochlore\nmagnet Nd2Zr2O7. These observations show the characteristic pinch-point\nfeatures of a Coulombic spin liquid occurring alongside the Bragg peaks of an\n\"all-in-all-out\" ordered state. Here we explain the quantum origins of this\napparent magnetic moment fragmentation, within the framework of a quantum model\nof nearest-neighbor exchange, appropriate to Nd2Zr2O7. This model is able to\ncapture both the ground-state order and the pinch points observed at finite\nenergy. The observed fragmentation arises due to the combination of the unusual\nsymmetry properties of the Nd3+ ionic wave functions and the structure of\nequations of motion of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The results of our\nanalysis suggest that Nd2Zr2O7 is proximate to a U(1) spin-liquid phase and is\na promising candidate for the observation of a Higgs transition in a magnetic\nsystem.\n", "  The absence of the quadratic divergence in the Higgs sector of the Standard\nModel in the dimensional regularization is usually regarded to be an\nexceptional property of a specific regularization. To understand what is going\non in the dimensional regularization, we illustrate how to reproduce the\nresults of the dimensional regularization for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory in\nthe more conventional regularization such as the higher derivative\nregularization; the basic postulate involved is that the quadratically\ndivergent induced mass, which is independent of the scale change of the\nphysical mass, is kinematical and unphysical. This is consistent with the\nderivation of the Callan-Symanzik equation, which is a comparison of two\ntheories with slightly different masses, for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory\nwithout encountering the quadratic divergence. We thus suggest that the\ndimensional regularization is generic in a bottom-up approach starting with a\nsuccessful low-energy theory. We also define a modified version of the mass\nindependent renormalization for a scalar field which leads to the homogeneous\nrenormalization group equation. Implications of the present analysis on the\nStandard Model at high energies and the presence or absence of SUSY at LHC\nenergies are briefly discussed.\n", "  In various multiorbital systems, the emergence of the orbital fluctuations\nand its role on the pairing mechanism attract increasing attention. To archive\ndeep understanding on these issues, we perform the\nfunctional-renormalization-group (fRG) study for the two-orbital Hubbard model.\nThe vertex corrections for the electron-boson coupling ($U$-VC), which are\ndropped in the Migdal-Eliashberg gap equation, are obtained by solving the RG\nequation. We reveal that the dressed electron-boson coupling for the\ncharge-channel, $U_{eff}^c$, becomes much larger than the bare Coulomb\ninteraction, $U^0$, due to the $U$-VC in the presence of moderate spin\nfluctuations. For this reason, the attractive pairing interaction due to the\ncharge or orbital fluctuations is enlarged by the factor $(U_{eff}^c/U^0)^2 >>\n1$. In contrast, the spin fluctuation pairing interaction is suppressed by the\nspin-channel $U$-VC, because of the relation $U_{eff}^s << U^0$. The present\nstudy demonstrates that the orbital or charge fluctuation pairing mechanism can\nbe realized in various multiorbital systems thanks to the $U$-VC, such as in\nFe-based superconductors.\n", "  We give a complete classification of conformally covariant differential\noperators between the spaces of $i$-forms on the sphere $S^n$ and $j$-forms on\nthe totally geodesic hypersphere $S^{n-1}$. Moreover, we find explicit\nformul{\\ae} for these new matrix-valued operators in the flat coordinates in\nterms of basic operators in differential geometry and classical orthogonal\npolynomials. We also establish matrix-valued factorization identities among all\npossible combinations of conformally covariant differential operators. The main\nmachinery of the proof is the \"F-method\" based on the \"algebraic Fourier\ntransform of Verma modules\" (Kobayashi-Pevzner [Selecta Math. 2016]) and its\nextension to matrix-valued case developed here. A short summary of the main\nresults was announced in [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2016].\n", "  Differential expansion (DE) for a Wilson loop average in representation $R$\nis built to respect degenerations of representations for small groups. At the\nsame time it behaves nicely under some changes of the loop, e.g. of some knots\nin the case of $3d$ Chern-Simons theory. Especially simple is the relation\nbetween the DE for the trefoil $3_1$ and for the figure eight knot $4_1$. Since\narbitrary colored HOMFLY for the trefoil are known from the Rosso-Jones\nformula, it is therefore enough to find their DE in order to make a conjecture\nfor the figure eight. We fulfil this program for all rectangular representation\n$R=[r^s]$, i.e. make a plausible conjecture for the rectangularly colored\nHOMFLY of the figure eight knot, which generalizes the old result for totally\nsymmetric and antisymmetric representations.\n", "  We study the cosmological implications of interactions between spacetime\nquanta in the Group Field Theory (GFT) approach to Quantum Gravity from a\nphenomenological perspective. Our work represents a first step towards\nunderstanding Early Universe Cosmology by studying the dynamics of the emergent\ncontinuum spacetime, as obtained from a fundamentally discrete microscopic\ntheory. In particular, we show how GFT interactions lead to a recollapse of the\nUniverse while preserving the bounce replacing the initial singularity, which\nhas already been shown to occur in the free case. It is remarkable that cyclic\ncosmologies are thus obtained in this framework without any a priori assumption\non the geometry of spatial sections of the emergent spacetime. Furthermore, we\nshow how interactions make it possible to have an early epoch of accelerated\nexpansion, which can be made to last for an arbitrarily large number of\ne-folds, without the need to introduce an ad hoc potential for the scalar\nfield.\n", "  We construct time and radial dependent solutions that describe p-branes in\nchargeless S-brane backgrounds. In particular, there are some new M5- and\nD3-branes among our solutions which have AdS limits and contain a cosmological\nsingularity as well. We also find a time-dependent version of the dyonic\nmembrane configuration in 11-dimensions by applying a Lunin-Maldacena\ndeformation to our new M5-brane solution.\n", "  Projective measurement can increase the entropy of a state $\\rho$, the\nincreased entropy is not only up to the basis of projective measurement, but\nalso has something to do with the properties of the state itself. In this paper\nwe define this increased entropy as basis entropy. And then we discuss the\nusefulness of this new concept by showing its application in deciding whether a\nstate is pure or not and detecting the existence of quantum discord. And as\nshown in the paper, this new concept can also be used to describe decoherence.\n", "  In single field slow-roll inflation, one expects that the spectral index $n_s\n-1$ is first order in slow-roll parameters. Similarly, its running $\\alpha_s =\ndn_s/d \\log k$ and the running of the running $\\beta_s = d\\alpha_s/d \\log k$\nare second and third order and therefore expected to be progressively smaller,\nand usually negative. Hence, such models of inflation are in considerable\ntension with a recent analysis hinting that $\\beta_s$ may actually be positive,\nand larger than $\\alpha_s$. Motivated by this, in this work we ask the question\nof what kinds of inflationary models may be useful in achieving such a\nhierarchy of runnings, particularly focusing on two--field models of inflation\nin which the late-time transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes\nallows for a much more diverse range of phenomenology. We calculate the\nrunnings due to this effect and briefly apply our results to assessing the\nfeasibility of finding $|\\beta_s| \\gtrsim |\\alpha_s|$ in some specific models.\n", "  It is widely believed that the leading secular loop corrections from quantum\ngravity can be subsumed into a coordinate redefinition. Hence the apparent\ninfrared logarithm corrections to any quantity would be just the result of\ntaking the expectation value of the tree order quantity at the transformed\ncoordinates in the graviton vacuum. We term this the Transformation Ansatz and\nwe compare its predictions against explicit one loop computations in Maxwell +\nEinstein and Dirac + Einstein on de Sitter background. In each case the ansatz\nfails.\n", "  Long coherence times are key to the performance of quantum bits (qubits).\nHere, we experimentally and theoretically show that the Hahn-echo coherence\ntime (T2) of electron spins associated with divacancy defects in 4H-SiC reaches\n1.3 ms, one of the longest T2 times of an electron spin in a naturally isotopic\ncrystal. Using a first-principles microscopic quantum-bath model, we find that\ntwo factors determine the unusually robust coherence. First, in the presence of\nmoderate magnetic fields (300 G and above), the 29Si and 13C paramagnetic\nnuclear spin baths are decoupled. In addition, because SiC is a binary crystal,\nhomo-nuclear spin pairs are both diluted and forbidden from forming strongly\ncoupled, nearest-neighbor spin pairs. Longer neighbor distances result in fewer\nnuclear spin flip-flops, a less fluctuating intra-crystalline magnetic\nenvironment, and thus a longer T2 time. Our results point to polyatomic\ncrystals as promising hosts for coherent qubits in the solid state.\n", "  We present a detailed description of the design, construction, and\nperformance of high-power ultrafast Yb:fiber laser frequency combs in operation\nin our laboratory. We discuss two such laser systems: an 87 MHz, 9 W, 85 fs\nlaser operating at 1060 nm and an 87 MHz, 80 W, 155 fs laser operating at 1035\nnm. Both are constructed using low-cost, commercially available components, and\ncan be assembled using only basic tools for cleaving and splicing single-mode\nfibers. We describe practical methods for achieving and characterizing\nlow-noise single-pulse operation and long-term stability from Yb:fiber\noscillators based on nonlinear polarization evolution. Stabilization of the\ncombs using a variety of transducers, including a new method for tuning the\ncarrier-envelope offset frequency, is discussed. High average power is achieved\nthrough chirped-pulse amplification in simple fiber amplifiers based on\ndouble-clad photonic crystal fibers. We describe the use of these combs in\nseveral applications, including ultrasensitive femtosecond time-resolved\nspectroscopy and cavity-enhanced high-order harmonic generation.\n", "  While the positive outcomes of undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have\nbeen extensively categorized, the mechanisms for those outcomes are less\nunderstood. Through lightly structured focus group interviews, we have\nextracted the cognitive tasks that students identify as engaging in during\ntheir UREs. We also use their many comparative statements about their\ncoursework, especially lab courses, to evaluate their experimental\nphysics-related cognitive tasks in those environments. We find there are a\nnumber of cognitive tasks consistently encountered in physics UREs that are\npresent in most experimental research. These are seldom encountered in lab or\nlecture courses, with some notable exceptions. Having time to reflect and fix\nor revise, and having a sense of autonomy, were both repeatedly cited as key\nenablers of the benefits of UREs. We also identify tasks encountered in actual\nexperimental research that are not encountered in UREs. We use these findings\nto identify opportunities for better integration of the cognitive tasks in UREs\nand lab courses, as well as discussing the barriers that exist. This work\nresponds to extensive calls for science education to better develop students'\nscientific skills and practices, as well as calls to expose more students to\nscientific research.\n", "  We consider a measurement of the position of a spot painted on the surface of\na trapped nano-optomechanical sphere. The measurement extracts information\nabout the position of the spot and in doing so measures a combination of the\norientation and position of the sphere. The quantum back-action of the\nmeasurement entangles and correlates these two degrees of freedom. Such a\nmeasurement is not available for atoms or ions, and provides a mechanism to\nprobe the quantum mechanical properties of trapped optomechanical spheres. In\nperforming simulations of this measurement process we also test a numerical\nmethod introduced recently by Rouchon and collaborators for solving stochastic\nmaster equations. This method guarantees the positivity of the density matrix\nwhen the Lindblad operators for all simultaneous continuous measurements are\nmutually commuting. We show that it is both simpler and far more efficient than\nprevious methods.\n", "  Rhombohedral multilayer graphene is a physical realization of the chiral\ntwo-dimensional electron gas that can host zero-line modes (ZLMs), also known\nas kink states, when the local ap opened by inversion symmetry breaking\npotential changes sign in real space. Here we study how the variations in the\nlocal stacking coordination of multilayer graphene affects the formation of the\nZLMs. Our analysis indicates that the valley Hall effect develops whenever an\ninterlayer potential difference is able to open up a band gap in stacking\nfaulted multilayer graphene, and that ZLMs can appear at the domain walls\nseparating two distinct regions with imperfect rhombohedral stacking\nconfigurations. Based on a tight-binding formulation with distant hopping terms\nbetween carbon atoms, we first show that topologically distinct domains\ncharacterized by the valley Chern number are separated by a metallic region\nconnecting AA and AA$'$ stacking line in the layer translation vector space. We\nfind that gapless states appear at the interface between the two stacking\nfaulted domains with different layer translation or with opposite perpendicular\nelectric field if their valley Chern numbers are different.\n", "  We demonstrate a coherent and dynamic beam splitter based on light storage in\ncold atoms. An input weak laser pulse is first stored in a cold atom ensemble\nvia electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). A set of\ncounter-propagating control fields, applied at a later time, retrieves the\nstored pulse into two output spatial modes. The high visibility interference\nbetween the two output pulses clearly demonstrates that the beam splitting\nprocess is coherent. Furthermore, by manipulating the control lasers, it is\npossible to dynamically control the storage time, the power splitting ratio,\nthe relative phase, and the optical frequencies of the output pulses. The\nactive beam splitter demonstrated in this work is expected to significantly\nreduce the resource requirement in photonic quantum information and in\nall-optical information processing as a single cold atom ensemble can\nfunctionally replace a variety of optical elements, including beam splitters,\nmirrors, phase shifters, and optical quantum memories.\n", "  We present a systematic procedure to obtain the one-loop low-energy effective\nLagrangian resulting from integrating out the heavy fields of a given\nultraviolet theory. We show that the matching coefficients are determined\nentirely by the hard region of the functional determinant involving the heavy\nfields. This represents an important simplification with respect the\nconventional matching approach, where the full and effective theory\ncontributions have to be computed separately and a cancellation of the infrared\ndivergent parts has to take place. We illustrate the method with a descriptive\ntoy model and with an extension of the Standard Model with a heavy real scalar\ntriplet. A comparison with other schemes that have been put forward recently is\nalso provided.\n", "  Following up on the recent work of Cachazo, He and Yuan\n\\cite{arXiv:1503.04816 [hep-th]}, we derive the double soft graviton theorem in\nperturbative gravity. We show that the double soft theorem derived using CHY\nformula precisely matches with the perturbative computation involving Feynman\ndiagrams. In particular, we find how certain delicate limits of Feynman\ndiagrams play an important role in obtaining this equivalence.\n", "  One of the cornerstones of modern physics is Einstein's special relativity,\nwith its constant speed of light and zero photon mass assumptions. Constraint\non the rest mass m_{\\gamma} of photons is a fundamental way to test Einstein's\ntheory, as well as other essential electromagnetic and particle theories. Since\nnon-zero photon mass can give rise to frequency-(or energy-) dependent\ndispersions, measuring the time delay of photons with different frequencies\nemitted from explosive astrophysical events is an important and\nmodel-independent method to put such a constraint. The cosmological gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), with short time scales, high redshifts as well as broadband\nprompt and afterglow emissions, provide an ideal testbed for m_{\\gamma}\nconstraints. In this paper we calculate the upper limits of the photon mass\nwith GRB early time radio afterglow observations as well as multi-band radio\npeaks, thus improve the results of Schaefer (1999) by nearly half an order of\nmagnitude.\n", "  The pentagram map is a discrete integrable system on the moduli space of\nplanar polygons. The corresponding first integrals are so-called monodromy\ninvariants $E_1, O_1, E_2, O_2,\\dots$ By analyzing the combinatorics of these\ninvariants, R.Schwartz and S.Tabachnikov have recently proved that for polygons\ninscribed in a conic section one has $E_k = O_k$ for all $k$. In this paper we\ngive a simple conceptual proof of the Schwartz-Tabachnikov theorem. Our main\nobservation is that for inscribed polygons the corresponding monodromy\nsatisfies a certain self-duality relation. From this we also deduce that the\nspace of inscribed polygons with fixed values of the monodromy invariants is an\nopen dense subset in the Prym variety (i.e., a half-dimensional torus in the\nJacobian) of the spectral curve. As a byproduct, we also prove another\nconjecture of Schwartz and Tabachnikov on positivity of monodromy invariants\nfor convex polygons.\n", "  We develop a model based on a multiple scattering theory to describe the\ndiffusion of polarized light in disordered media exhibiting short-range\nstructural correlations. Starting from exact expressions of the average field\nand the field spatial correlation function, we derive a radiative transfer\nequation for the polarization-resolved specific intensity that is valid for\nweak disorder and we solve it analytically in the diffusion limit. A\ndecomposition of the specific intensity in terms of polarization eigenmodes\nreveals how structural correlations, represented via the standard anisotropic\nscattering parameter $g$, affect the diffusion of polarized light. More\nspecifically, we find that propagation through each polarization eigenchannel\nis described by its own transport mean free path that depends on $g$ in a\nspecific and non-trivial way.\n", "  Sn0.8Ag0.2Te is a new superconductor with Tc ~ 2.4 K. The superconducting\nproperties of Sn0.8Ag0.2Te have been investigated by specific heat measurements\nunder magnetic fields. Bulk nature of superconductivity was confirmed from the\namplitude of the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition, and the\namplitude is consistent with fully-gapped superconductivity. Upper critical\nfield was estimated from specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements\nunder magnetic fields. The Hall coefficient was positive, suggesting that the\nAg acts as a p-type dopant in Sn0.8Ag0.2Te.\n", "  Charges are everywhere because most atoms are charged. Chemical bonds are\nformed by electrons with their charge. Charges move and interact according to\nMaxwell's equations in space and in atoms where the equations of\nelectrodynamics are embedded in Schroedinger's equation as the potential.\nMaxwell's equations are universal, valid inside atoms and between stars from\ntimes much shorter than those of atomic motion (0.1 femtoseconds) to years (32\nmega-seconds). Maxwell's equations enforce the conservation of current.\nAnalysis shows that the electric field can take on whatever value is needed to\nensure conservation of current. The properties of matter rearrange themselves\nto satisfy Maxwell's equations and conservation of current. Conservation of\ncurrent is as universal as Maxwell's equations themselves. Yet equations of\nelectrodynamics find little place in the literature of material physics,\nchemistry, or biochemistry. Kinetic models of chemistry and Markov treatments\nof atomic motion are ordinary differential equations in time and do not satisfy\nconservation of current unless modified significantly. Systems at equilibrium,\nwithout macroscopic flow, have thermal fluctuating currents that are conserved\naccording to the Maxwell equations although their macroscopic averages are\nzero. The macroscopic consequences of atomic scale fluctuating thermal currents\nare not known but are likely to be substantial because of the nonlinear\ninteractions in systems like these, in which 'everything interacts with\neverything else'.\n  Conclusion: current needs to be conserved in models of material systems, even\nin simplified versions.\n", "  We analyse the evolution of cosmological perturbations which leads to the\nformation of large voids in the distribution of galaxies. We assume that\nperturbations are spherical and all components of the Universe - radiation,\nmatter and dark energy - are continuous media with ideal fluid energy-momentum\ntensors, which interact only gravitationally. Equations of the evolution of\nperturbations in the comoving to cosmological background reference frame for\nevery component are obtained from equations of conservation and Einstein's ones\nand are integrated by modified Euler method. Initial conditions are set at the\nearly stage of evolution in the radiation-dominated epoch, when the scale of\nperturbation is mush larger than the particle horizon. Results show how the\nprofiles of density and velocity of matter in spherical voids with different\noverdensity shells are formed.\n", "  We present a numerical study of quasi-1D frustrated Josephson junction\nladders with diagonal couplings and open boundary conditions, in the large\ncapacitance limit. We derive a correspondence between the energy of this\nJosephson junction ladder and the expectation value of the Hamiltonian of an\nanalogous tight-binding model, and show how the overall superconducting state\nof the chain is equivalent to the minimum energy state of the tight-binding\nmodel in the subspace of one-particle states with uniform density. To satisfy\nthe constraint of uniform density, the superconducting state of the ladder is\nwritten as a linear combination of the allowed k-states of the tight-binding\nmodel with open boundaries. Above a critical value of the parameter t (ratio\nbetween the intra-rung and inter-rung Josephson couplings), the ladder\nspontaneously develop currents at the edges which spread to the bulk as t is\nincreased until complete coverage is reached. Above a certain value of t, which\nvaries with ladder size (t = 1 for an infinite-sized ladder), the edge currents\nare destroyed. The value t = 1 corresponds, in the tight-binding model, to the\nopening of a gap between two bands. We argue that the disappearance of the edge\ncurrents with this gap opening is not coincidental, and that this points to a\ntopological origin for these edge current states.\n", "  Charged Particle Therapy is a technique for cancer treatment that exploits\nhadron beams, mostly protons and carbons. A critical issue is the monitoring of\nthe dose released by the beam to the tumor and to the surrounding tissues. We\npresent the design of a new tracking device for monitoring on-line the dose in\nion therapy through the detection of secondary charged particles produced by\nthe beam interactions in the patient tissues. In fact, the charged particle\nemission shape can be correlated with the spatial dose release and the Bragg\npeak position. The detector uses the information provided by 12 layers of\nscintillating fibers followed by a plastic scintillator and a small calorimeter\nmade of a pixelated Lutetium Fine Silicate crystal. Simulations have been\nperformed to evaluate the achievable spatial resolution and a possible\napplication of the device for the monitoring of the dose profile in a real\ntreatment is presented.\n", "  We investigate social networks of characters found in cultural works such as\nnovels and films. These character networks exhibit many of the properties of\ncomplex networks such as skewed degree distribution and community structure,\nbut may be of relatively small order with a high multiplicity of edges.\nBuilding on recent work of beveridge, we consider graph extraction,\nvisualization, and network statistics for three novels: Twilight by Stephanie\nMeyer, Steven King's The Stand, and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet\nof Fire. Coupling with 800 character networks from films found in the\nhttp://moviegalaxies.com/ database, we compare the data sets to simulations\nfrom various stochastic complex networks models including random graphs with\ngiven expected degrees (also known as the Chung-Lu model), the configuration\nmodel, and the preferential attachment model. Using machine learning techniques\nbased on motif (or small subgraph) counts, we determine that the Chung-Lu model\nbest fits character networks and we conjecture why this may be the case.\n", "  In this paper we extend our techniques, developed in a previous paper (Du,\netc, JHEP 05(2016)086) for direct evaluation of arbitrary $n$-point tree-level\nMHV amplitudes in 4d Yang-Mills and gravity theory using the Cachazo-He-Yuan\n(CHY) formalism, to the 4d Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) theory. Any single-trace\ncolor-ordered $n$-point tree-level MHV amplitude in EYM theory, obtained by a\ndirect evaluation of the CHY formula, is of an elegant factorized form of a\nParke-Taylor factor and a Hodges determinant, much simpler and more compact\nthan the existing formulas in the literature. We prove that our new expression\nis equivalent to the conjectured Selivanov-Bern-De Freitas-Wong (SBDW) formula,\nwith the help of a new theorem showing that the SBDW generating function has a\ngraph theory interpretation. Together with Ref. (Du, etc, JHEP 05(2016)086), we\nprovide strong analytic evidence for hidden simplicity in quantum field theory.\n", "  Random sequential adsorption of linear and square particles with excluded\nvolume interaction is studied numerically on planar lattices considering\nGaussian distributions of lateral sizes of the incident particles, with several\nvalues of the average and of the width-to-average ratio $w$. When the coverage\nis plotted as function of the logarithm of time $t$, the maximum slope is\nattained at a time $t_M$ of the same order of the time $\\tau$ of incidence of\none monolayer, which is related to the molecular flux and/or sticking\ncoefficients. For various values of the average $\\mu$ and $w$, we obtain\n$1.5\\tau < t_M < 5\\tau$ for linear particles and $.3\\tau< t_M < \\tau$ for\nsquare particles. At $t_M$, the coverages with linear and square particles are\nnear .3 and .2, respectively. Extrapolations show that coverages may vary with\n$\\mu$ up to 20% and 2% for linear and square particles, respectively, for\n$\\mu\\ge 64$, fixed time, and constant $w$. All coverage $\\theta$ versus $\\log\nt$ plots have approximately the same shape, but other quantities measured at\ntimes of order $t_M$ help to distinguish narrow and broad incident\ndistributions. The adsorbed particle size distributions are close to the\nincident ones up to long times for small $w$, but appreciably change in time\nfor larger $w$, acquiring a monotonically decreasing shape for $w = 1/2$ at\ntimes of order $100\\tau$ . At $t_M$, incident and adsorbed distributions are\napproximately the same for $w \\le 1/8$ and show significant differences for $w\n\\ge 1/2$; this result may be used as a consistency test in applications of the\nmodel. The pair correlation function $g (r; t)$ for $w = 1/8$ has a well\ndefined oscillatory structure at $10t_M$, with a minimum at $r\\approx\\mu$ and\nmaximum at $r \\approx 1.5\\mu$, but this structure is not observed for $w \\ge\n1/4$.\n", "  Photoionization from energetically distinct electronic states may have a\nrelative time delay of tens of attoseconds. Here we demonstrate that pulses of\noptical vortices allow measuring such attoseconds delays from magnetic\nsublevels, even from a spherically symmetric target. The difference in the time\ndelay is substantial and exhibits a strong angular dependence. Furthermore, we\nfind an atomic scale variation in the time delays depending on the target\norbital position in the laser spot. The findings offer thus a qualitatively new\nway for a spatio-temporal sensing of the magnetic states from which the\nphotoelectrons originate, with a spatial resolution way below the diffraction\nlimit of the vortex beam. Our conclusions follow from analytical considerations\nbased on symmetry, complemented and confirmed with full numerical simulations\nof the quantum dynamics.\n", "  A trace gas sensor, based on quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy\n(QEPAS), consisting of two acoustically coupled micro-resonators (mR) with an\noff-axis 20 kHz quartz tuning fork (QTF) is demonstrated. The complete\nacoustically coupled mR system is optimized based on finite element simulations\nand experimentally verified. The QEPAS sensor is pumped resonantly by a\nnanosecond pulsed single-mode mid-infrared optical parametric oscillator (MIR\nOPO). The sensor is used for spectroscopic measurements on methane in the 3.1\num to 3.5 um wavelength region with a resolution bandwidth of 1 cm^-1 and a\ndetection limit of 0.8 ppm. An Allan deviation analysis shows that the\ndetection limit at optimum integration time for the QEPAS sensor is 32\nppbv@190s and that the background noise is solely due to the thermal noise of\nthe QTF.\n", "  The ultraviolet (UV) window has been largely unexplored through balloons for\nastronomy. We discuss here the development of a compact near-UV spectrograph\nwith fiber optics input for balloon ights. It is a modified Czerny-Turner\nsystem built using off-the-shelf components. The system is portable and\nscalable to different telescopes. The use of re ecting optics reduces the\ntransmission loss in the UV. It employs an image-intensified CMOS sensor,\noperating in photon counting mode, as the detector of choice. A lightweight\npointing system developed for stable pointing to observe astronomical sources\nis also discussed, together with the methods to improve its accuracy, e.g.\nusing the in-house build star sensor and others. Our primary scientific\nobjectives include the observation of bright Solar System objects such as\nvisible to eye comets, Moon and planets. Studies of planets can give us\nvaluable information about the planetary aurorae, helping to model and compare\natmospheres of other planets and the Earth. The other major objective is to\nlook at the diffuse UV atmospheric emission features (airglow lines), and at\ncolumn densities of trace gases. This UV window includes several lines\nimportant to atmospheric chemistry, e.g. SO2, O3, HCHO, BrO. The spectrograph\nenables simultaneous measurement of various trace gases, as well as provides\nbetter accuracy at higher altitudes compared to electromechanical trace gas\nmeasurement sondes. These lines contaminate most astronomical observations but\nare poorly characterized. Other objectives may include sprites in the\natmosphere and meteor ashes from high altitude burn-outs. Our recent\nexperiments and observations with high-altitude balloons are discussed.\n", "  The paper deals with collapse dynamics of a spherically symmetric massive\nstar in the framework of non-equilibrium themodynamic prescription through\nparticle creation mechanism. The matter content in the star is in the form of\nperfect uid with barotropic equation of state and the dissipative phenomena due\nto non-equilibrium thermodynamics is in the form of bulk viscosity. For\nsimplicity, the thermodynamic system is chosen to be adiabatic (i.e.,\nisentropic) so that the effective bulk viscous pressure is linearly related to\nthe particle creation rate. As a result, the evolution of the collapsing star\nalso depends on the particle creation rate. By proper choice of creation rate\nas a function of the Hubble parameter, it is found that the end state of the\ncollapse may be either a black hole or a naked singularity.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of laser pulse amplification with respect to\noperation regimes, gain dynamics, and highly stable operation points of Ho:YLF\nregenerative amplifiers (RAs). The findings are expected to be more generic\nthan for this specific case. Operation regimes are distinguished with respect\nto pulse energy and the appearance of pulse instability, and are studied as a\nfunction of the repetition rate, seed energy, and pump intensity. The\ncorresponding gain dynamics are presented, identifying highly stable operation\npoints related to high gain build -up during pumping and high gain depletion\nduring pulse amplification. These operation points are studied numerically and\nexperimentally as a function of several parameters, thereby achieving, for our\nHo:YLF RA, highly stable output pulses with measured fluctuations of only 0.19%\n(standard deviation).\n", "  In a previous study, we investigated the frequency distribution of the email\nsize in the system log data of the main email server for the staff on a campus\nnetwork. We found that the frequencies of email sizes followed a power-law\ndistribution and discovered two inflection points in the distribution. After\nanalyzing these results, we collected new system log data for both staff and\nstudents for the period from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2015 and analyzed the\nfrequency distributions per academic year. The results of the earlier\ninvestigation were replicated for each of these distributions. Then, we\ndisaggregated the system log data for the staff for the period from May 1, 2015\nto July 31, 2015 using the email header \"Content-Type\" and created four\nsubdistributions. Frequency distributions were calculated for the disaggregated\ndata. We then proposed and evaluated a model to explain the overall frequency\ndistribution as a sum of the four subdistributions. The correlation coefficient\nbetween the observed frequency distribution and the distribution predicted by\nour model was 0.8408 for the staff. This coefficient confirmed that our\napproach can successfully model and predict the size distribution of emails.\n", "  In X-ray phase contrast imaging, phase retrieval from intensity measurements\nis the key for further quantitative analysis and tomographic reconstructions.\nIn this letter, we present a single-shot approach for quantitative phase\nretrieval in high-energy X-ray grating interferometry. The proposed approach\nmakes use of the phase-attenuation duality of soft tissues when being imaged\nwith high-energy X-rays. The phase retrieval formula is derived and presented,\nand tested by numerical experiments including photon shot noise. The good\nagreement between retrieval results and theoretical values confirms the\nfeasibility of the presented approach.\n", "  In this note we first review the degenerate vacua arising from the BMS\nsymmetries. According to the discussion in [1] one can define BMS-analogous\nsupertranslation and superrotation for spacetime with black hole in Gaussian\nnull coordinates. In the leading and subleading orders of near horizon\napproximation, the infinitely degenerate black hole solutions are derived by\nconsidering Einstein equations with or without cosmological constant, and they\nare related to each other by the diffeomorphism generated by horizon\nsupertranslation. Higher order results and degenerate Rindler horizon solutions\nalso are given in appendices.\n", "  We study a quantum XX chain coupled to two heat reservoirs that act on\nmultiple-sites and are kept at different temperatures and chemical potentials.\nThe baths are described by Lindblad dissipators which are constructed by direct\ncoupling to the fermionic normal modes of the chain. Using a perturbative\nmethod, we are able to find analytical formulas for all steady-state properties\nof the system. We compute both the particle/magnetization current and the\nenergy current, both of which are found to have the structure of Landauer's\nformula. We also obtain exact formulas for the Onsager coefficients. All\nproperties are found to differ substantially from those of a single-site bath.\nIn particular, we find a strong dependence on the intensity of the bath\ncouplings. In the weak coupling regime, we show that the Onsager reciprocal\nrelations are satisfied.\n", "  This work investigates energy filtering in nanowires, where pass and\nstopbands are obtained by including superlattices in the wire. When a pair of\nsuch superlattices is placed in series, each being controlled by a gate, it can\nact as a transistor where the (mis-)alignment of its minibands turns the device\non (off). It is shown that, in the ballistic current-regime, the transition\nbetween the on and off state occurs in a narrow gate-bias range, giving rise to\nsub-60 mV per decade switching behavior.\n", "  The chemical tagging technique proposed by Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn (2002) is\nbased on the idea that stars formed from the same molecular cloud should share\nthe same chemical signature. Thus, using only the chemical composition of stars\nwe should be able to re-group the ones that once belonged to the same stellar\naggregate. In Blanco-Cuaresma et al. (2015), we tested the technique on open\ncluster stars using iSpec (Blanco-Cuaresma et al. 2014a), we demonstrated their\nchemical homogeneity but we found that the 14 studied elements lead to chemical\nsignatures too similar to reliably distinguish stars from different clusters.\nThis represents a challenge to the technique and a new question was open: Could\nthe inclusion of other elements help to better distinguish stars from different\naggregates? With an updated and improved version of iSpec, we derived\nabundances for 28 elements using spectra from HARPS, UVES and NARVAL archives\nfor the open clusters M67 and IC4651, and we found that the chemical signatures\nof both clusters are very similar.\n", "  The simultaneous control of optical and mechanical waves has enabled a range\nof fundamental and technological breakthroughs, from the demonstration of\nultra-stable frequency reference devices to the exploration of the\nquantum-classical boundaries in laser-cooling experiments. More recently, such\nan opto-mechanical interaction has been observed in integrated nano-waveguides\nand microcavities in the Brillouin regime, where short-wavelength mechanical\nmodes scatters light at several GHz. Here we engineer coupled optical\nmicrocavities spectra to enable a low threshold excitation of mechanical\ntravelling-wave modes through backward stimulated Brillouin scattering.\nExploring the backward scattering we propose microcavity designs supporting\nsuper high frequency modes ($\\sim25$ GHz) an large optomechanical coupling\nrates ($g_0/2\\pi \\sim 50$ kHz).\n", "  We present a concept of surface decomposition extended from double Fourier\nseries to nonnegative sinusoidal wave surfaces, on the basis of which linear\nion sources apply to the ultra-precision fabrication of complex surfaces and\ndiffractive optics. It is the first time that we have a surface descriptor for\nbuilding a relationship between the fabrication process of optical surfaces and\nthe surface characterization based on PSD analysis, which akin to Zernike\npolynomials used for mapping the relationship between surface errors and Seidel\naberrations. Also, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional scanning of linear\nion source is applicable to the removal of surface errors caused by small-tool\npolishing in raster scan mode as well as the fabrication of beam sampling\ngrating of high diffractive uniformity without a post-processing procedure. The\nsimulation results show that, in theory, optical fabrication with linear ion\nsource is feasible and even of higher output efficiency compared with the\nconventional approach.\n", "  The first Advanced LIGO observing run detected two black hole merger events\nwith confidence and likely a third. Many groups organized to followup the\nevents in the optical even though the strong theoretical prior that no optical\nemission should be seen. We carry through the logic of this by asking about the\nexperimental upper limits to the optical light from Advanced LIGO black hole\nmergere events. We inventory the published optical searches for transient\nevents associated with the black hole mergers. We describe the factors that go\ninto a formal limit on the visibility of an event (sky area coverage, the\ncoverage factor of the camera, the fraction of sky not covered by intervening\nobjects), and list what is known from the literature of the followup teams\nquantitative assessment of each factor. Where possible we calculate the total\nprobability from each group that the source was imaged. The calculation of\nconfidence level is reviewed for the case of no background. We find that an\nexperimental 95% upper limit on the magnitude of a black hole requires the sum\nof the total probabilities over all events to be more than 3. In the first\nAdvanced LIGO observing run we were far from reaching that threshold.\n", "  High-Q optical resonators allow label-free detection of individual\nnanoparticles through perturbation of optical signatures but have practical\nlimitations due to reliance on random diffusion to deliver particles to the\nsensing region. We have recently developed microfluidic optomechanical\nresonators that allow detection of free-flowing particles in fluid media with\nnear perfect detection efficiency, without requiring labeling, binding, or\ndirect access to the optical mode. Rapid detection of single particles is\nachieved through a long-range optomechanical interaction that influences the\nscattered light spectra from the resonator, which can be quantified with\npost-processing. Here, we present a hybrid electromechanical-optomechanical\ntechnique for substantially increasing the bandwidth of these\noptomechanofluidic sensors, enabling real-time operation. The presented system\ndemonstrates temporal resolution of better than 20~\\us (50,000 events/second)\nwith particle sensing resolution down to 490 nm, operating in the air without\nany stabilization or environmental control. Our technique significantly\nenhances the sensing capabilities of high-Q optical resonators into the\nmechanics domain, and allows extremely high-throughput analysis of large\nnanoparticle populations.\n", "  We demonstrate the trapping and sympathetic cooling of B$^{+}$ ions in a\nCoulomb crystal of laser-cooled Ca$^{+}$, We non-destructively confirm the\npresence of the both B$^+$ isotopes by resonant excitation of the secular\nmotion. The B$^{+}$ ions are loaded by ablation of boron and the secular\nexcitation spectrum also reveals features consistent with ions of the form\nB$_{n}^{+}$.\n", "  The synthesis of materials in high-pressure experiments has recently\nattracted increasing attention, especially since the discovery of record\nbreaking superconducting temperatures in the sulfur-hydrogen and other\nhydrogen-rich systems. Commonly, the initial precursor in a high pressure\nexperiment contains constituent elements that are known to form compounds at\nambient conditions, however the discovery of high-pressure phases in systems\nimmiscible under ambient conditions poses an additional materials design\nchallenge. We performed an extensive multi component $ab\\,initio$ structural\nsearch in the immiscible Fe--Bi system at high pressure and report on the\nsurprising discovery of two stable compounds at pressures above $\\approx36$\nGPa, FeBi$_2$ and FeBi$_3$. According to our predictions, FeBi$_2$ is a metal\nat the border of magnetism with a conventional electron-phonon mediated\nsuperconducting transition temperature of $T_{\\rm c}=1.3$ K at 40 GPa. In\nanalogy to other iron-based materials, FeBi$_2$ is possibly a non-conventional\nsuperconductor with a real $T_{\\rm c}$ significantly exceeding the values\nobtained within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory.\n", "  Causal nature of the acoustic response, for any materials or structures,\ndictates an inequality that relates the absorption spectrum of the sample to\nits thickness. We present a general recipe for constructing sound-absorbing\nstructures that can attain near-equality for the causal relation with very high\nabsorption performance; such structures are denoted optimal. Our strategy\ninvolves using carefully designed acoustic metamaterials as backing to a thin\nlayer of conventional sound absorbing material, e.g., acoustic sponge. By using\nthis design approach, we have realized a 12 cm-thick structure that exhibits\nbroadband, near-perfect flat absorption spectrum starting at around 400 Hz.\nFrom the causal relation, the calculated minimum sample thickness is 11.5 cm\nfor the observed absorption spectrum. We present the theory that underlies such\nabsorption performance, involving the evanescent waves and their interaction\nwith a dissipative medium, and show the excellent agreement with the\nexperiment.\n", "  In this paper, the dependence of the broad Fe K$\\alpha$ line on the physical\nparameters of AGN, such as the black hole mass $M_{BH}$, accretion rate\n(equivalently represented by Eddington ratio $\\lambda_{Edd}$), and optical\nclassification, is investigated by applying the X-ray spectra stacking method\nto a large sample of AGN which have well measured optical parameters. A broad\nline feature is detected ($>3\\sigma$) in the stacked spectra of the high\n$\\lambda_{Edd}$ sub-sample ($\\log\\lambda_{Edd}>-0.9$). The profile of the broad\nline can be well fitted with relativistic broad line model, with the line\nenergy consistent with highly ionized Fe K$\\alpha$ line (i.e. Fe xxvi). A model\nconsisting of multiple narrow lines cannot be ruled out, however. We found\nhints that the Fe K line becomes broader as the $\\lambda_{Edd}$ increases. No\nbroad line feature is shown in the sub-sample of broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1)\ngalaxies and in the full sample, while a broad line might be present, though at\nlow significance, in the sub-sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies.\nWe find no strong dependence of the broad line on black hole masses. Our\nresults indicate that the detection/properties of the broad Fe K$\\alpha$ line\nmay strongly depend on $\\lambda_{Edd}$, which can be explained if the\nionization state and/or truncation radius of the accretion disc changes with\n$\\lambda_{Edd}$. The non-detection of the broad line in the BLS1 sub-sample can\nbe explained if the the average EW of the relativistic Fe K$\\alpha$ line is\nweak or/and the fraction of sources with relativistic Fe K$\\alpha$ line is\nsmall in BLS1 galaxies.\n", "  A multiple scale model of the nonlinearly coupled KdV equations is\nestablished to predict mechanism of interaction of equatorial Rossby waves and\nbarotropic waves in certain case. Analytically, predicted precursor radiation\nis a centrosymmetric object and is shown in excellent quantitative agreement\nwith numerical simulations; furthermore, the multiple scale model elucidates\nthe salient mechanisms of the interaction of solitary waves and the mechanism\nfor radiation. While the atmosphere-ocean science community is very interested\nin theoretical studies of tropical wave interactions and in developing reduced\ndynamical models that can explain some key features of equatorial phenomena,\nour analytic predictions quantitively explain formation of radiation during\ninteraction in Biello's model beyond qualitative level.\n", "  Accurate enthalpies of formation are reported for known and potential\nastromolecules using high level ab initio quantum chemical calculations. A\ntotal of 130 molecules comprising of 31 isomeric groups and 24\ncyanide/isocyanide pairs with atoms ranging from 3 to 12 have been considered.\nThe results show an interesting, surprisingly not well explored, relationship\nbetween energy, stability and abundance (ESA) existing among these molecules.\nAmong the isomeric species, isomers with lower enthalpies of formation are more\neasily observed in the interstellar medium compared to their counterparts with\nhigher enthalpies of formation. Available data in literature confirm the high\nabundance of the most stable isomer over other isomers in the different groups\nconsidered. Potential for interstellar hydrogen bonding accounts for the few\nexceptions observed. Thus, in general, it suffices to say that the interstellar\nabundances of related species are directly proportional to their stabilities.\nThe immediate consequences of this relationship in addressing some of the whys\nand wherefores among astromolecules and in predicting some possible candidates\nfor future astronomical observations are discussed. Our comprehensive results\non 130 molecules indicate that the available experimental enthalpy of formation\nfor some molecules, such as NaCN, may be less reliable and new measurements may\nbe needed.\n", "  We study the spontaneous decoherence of the coupled harmonic oscillators\nconfined in a ring container, where the nearest-neighbor harmonic potentials\nare taken into consideration. Without any external symmetry breaking field or\nsurrounding environment, the quantum superposition state prepared in the\nrelative degrees of freedom gradually loses its quantum coherence\nspontaneously. This spontaneous decoherence is interpreted by the hidden\ncouplings between the center-of-mass and relative degrees of freedoms, which\nactually originates from the symmetries of the ring geometry and corresponding\nnontrivial boundary conditions. Especially, such spontaneous decoherence\ncompletely vanishes at the thermodynamical limit because the nontrivial\nboundary conditions become trivial Born-von Karman boundary conditions when the\nperimeter of the ring container tends to infinity. Our investigation shows that\na thermal macroscopic object with certain symmetries has chance to degrade its\nquantum properties even without applying an external symmetry breaking field or\nsurrounding environment.\n", "  In this paper, stability of linearly coupled dynamical systems with feedback\npinning is studied. Event-triggered rules are employed on both diffusion\ncoupling and feedback pinning to reduce the updating load of the coupled\nsystem. Here, both the coupling matrix and the set of pinned-nodes vary with\ntime are induced by a homogeneous Markov chain. For each node, the diffusion\ncoupling and feedback pinning are set up from the observation of its neighbors'\nand target's (if pinned) information at the latest event time and the next\nevent time is triggered by some specified criteria. Two event-triggering rules\nare proposed and it is proved that if the system with time-average coupling and\npinning gains are stable, the event-triggered strategies can stabilize the\nsystem if the switching is sufficiently fast. Moreover, Zeno behaviors are\nexcluded in some cases. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate\nthe theoretical results.\n", "  The frontal structure of the Southern Ocean is investigated using a\nsophisticated frontal detection methodology, the Wavelet/Higher Order\nStatistics Enhancement (WHOSE) method, introduced in \\cite{Chapman2014}. This\nmethodology is applied to 21 years of daily gridded sea-surface height (SSH)\ndata to obtain daily maps of the locations of the fronts. By forming\n`heat-maps' of the frontal occurrence frequency and then approximating these\nheat-maps by a superposition of simple functions, the time-mean locations of\nthe fronts, as well as a measure of their capacity to meander, are obtained and\nrelated to the frontal locations found by previous studies.\n  The spatial and temporal variability of the frontal structure is then\nconsidered. The number of fronts is found to be highly variable throughout the\nSouthern Ocean, increasing (`splitting') downstream of large bathymetric\nfeatures and decreasing (`merging') in regions where the fronts are tightly\ncontrolled by the underlying topography. In contrast, frontal meandering\nremains relatively constant. Contrary to many previous studies, little no\nsouthward migration of the fronts over the 1993-2014 time period is found, and\nthere is only weak sensitivity to atmospheric forcing related to SAM or ENSO.\nThe reasons for the discrepancy between this study and previous studies using\ncontour methods are investigated and it is shown that the spatial variability\nof the frontal structure is not tied to the underlying sea-surface height. It\nis argued that the results of studies using sea-surface height contours to\ndefine front must be interpreted with care.\n", "  In quantum physics we are confronted with new entities which consist\nindivisible of an energy packet and a coupled wave. The complementarity\nprinciple for certain properties of these quantum objects may be their main\nmystery. Photons are especially useful to investigate these complementary\nproperties. A series of new experiments using spontaneous parametric down\nconversion (SPDC) as a tool allowed the detailed analysis of the physical\nbackground of this complementarity and offers a new conceptual perspective.\nBased on these results a straightforward explanation of these sometimes\ncounter-intuitive effects is given.\n", "  We study, in the paradigm of open quantum systems, the dynamics of quantum\ncoherence of a static polarizable two-level atom which is coupled with a\nthermal bath of fluctuating electromagnetic field in the absence and presence\nof boundaries. The purpose is to find the conditions under which the\ndecoherence can be inhibited effectively. We find that without boundaries,\nquantum coherence of the two-level atom inevitably decreases due to the effect\nof thermal bath. However, the quantum decoherence, in the presence of a\nboundary, could be effectively inhibited when the atom is transversely\npolarizable and near this boundary. In particular, we find that in the case of\ntwo parallel reflecting boundaries, the atom with a parallel dipole\npolarization at arbitrary location between these two boundaries will be never\nsubjected to decoherence provided we take some special distances for the two\nboundaries.\n", "  We show that the usual master equation formalism of Markovian open quantum\nsystems is completely equivalent to a certain state vector formalism. The state\nvector of the system satisfies a given frictional Schr\\\"odinger equation except\nfor random instant transitions of discrete nature. Hasse's frictional\nHamiltonian is recovered for the damped harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We show that any quantum circuit of treewidth $t$, built from $r$-qubit\ngates, requires at least $\\Omega(\\frac{n^{2}}{2^{O(r\\cdot t)}\\cdot \\log^4 n})$\ngates to compute the element distinctness function. Our result generalizes a\nnear-quadratic lower bound for quantum formula size obtained by Roychowdhury\nand Vatan [SIAM J. on Computing, 2001]. The proof of our lower bound follows by\nan extension of Ne\\v{c}iporuk's method to the context of quantum circuits of\nconstant treewidth. This extension is made via a combination of techniques from\nstructural graph theory, tensor-network theory, and the connected-component\ncounting method, which is a classic tool in algebraic geometry.\n", "  We have studied the excitonic gap formation in the Bernal Stacked, bilayer\ngraphene (BLG) structures at half-filling. Considering the local Coulomb\ninteraction between the layers, we calculate the excitonic gap parameter and we\ndiscuss the role of the interlayer and intralayer Coulomb interactions and the\ninterlayer hopping on the excitonic pair formation in the BLG. Particularly, we\npredict the origin of excitonic gap formation and condensation, in relation to\nthe farthermost interband optical transition spectrum. The general diagram of\nexcitonic phase transition is given, explaining different interlayer\ncorrelation regimes. The temperature dependence of the excitonic gap parameter\nis shown and the role of the chemical potential, in the BLG, is discussed in\ndetails.\n", "  We study Floquet topological phases driven by $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric\nnonunitary time evolution in one dimension, based on an experimental setup of\ndiscrete-time quantum walks. We develop, for nonunitary time-evolution\noperators, a procedure to calculate topological invariants for Floquet\ntopological phases and find that the bulk-edge correspondence gives correct\npredictions of the emergent edge states. These edge states make exponential\ngrowth of wavefunction amplitudes at specific positions with time controllable.\nHereby, we propose that these phenomena inherent in open quantum systems are\nfeasibly observed by present experiments of quantum walks in both classical and\nquantum regimes.\n", "  Stray light in X-ray telescopes is a well-known issue. Unlike rays focused\nvia a double reflection by usual grazing-incidence geometries such as the\nWolter-I, stray rays coming from off-axis sources are reflected only once by\neither the parabolic or the hyperbolic segment. Although not focused, stray\nlight may represent a major source of background and ghost images especially\nwhen observing a field of faint sources in the vicinities of another, more\nintense, just outside the field of view of the telescope. The stray light\nproblem is faced by mounting a pre-collimator in front of the mirror module, in\norder to shade a part of the reflective surfaces that may give rise to\nsingly-reflected rays. Studying the expected stray light impact, and\nconsequently designing a pre-collimator, is a typical ray-tracing problem,\nusually time and computation consuming, especially if we consider that rays\npropagate throughout a densely nested structure. This in turn requires one to\npay attention to all the possible obstructions, increasing the complexity of\nthe simulation. In contrast, approaching the problems of stray light\ncalculation from an analytical viewpoint largely simplifies the problem, and\nmay also ease the task of designing an effective pre-collimator. In this work\nwe expose an analytical formalism that can be used to compute the stray light\nin a nested optical module in a fast and effective way, accounting for\nobstruction effects.\n", "  We consider the excitonic correlations in the two band solid state system\ncomposed of the valence band and conduction band electrons. We treat the phase\ncoherence mechanism in the system by presenting the electron operator as a\nfermion attached to the U(1) phase-flux tube. The emergent bosonic gauge field,\nrelated to the phase variables appears to be crucial for the coherent\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons. We calculate the normal excitonic\nGreen functions, and the single-particle density of states functions being a\nconvolution between bosonic and fermionic counterparts. We obtain the total\ndensity of states (DOS) as a sum of two independent parts. For the coherent\nnormal fermionic DOS, there is no hybridization-gap found in the system due to\nstrong coherence effets and phase stiffness.\n", "  We consider the open STIRAP problem by formulating it in terms of generalized\nBloch equations. Expressed in this form the resulting Liouvillian matrix is\nanalyzed in detail. As it turns out, most of the findings of open STIRAP models\ncan be understood from the spectrum and eigenstates of the Liouvillian matrix.\nAs a non-hermitian matrix we particularly discuss the mathematical structure of\nit by identifying among others the physical meaning of its eigenvectors and the\nsystem's exceptional points. We also discuss the importance of the Liouvillian\ngap which normally implies that any state becomes mixed. However, in certain\nsituations, for example the STIRAP model under influence of spontaneous\nemission, a sort of pump term appears in the equations of motion, and its\neffect is to counteract the gap induced decay such that coherence may prevail.\nAs the STIRAP driving is not perfectly adiabatic, we additionally find that for\nspontaneous emission the presence of a non-zero Liouvillian gap actually\nenhances the success rate of the process. This is thus an example of a\nenvironment assisted physical operation.\n", "  We present in this paper an update on the design of BEaTriX (Beam Expander\nTesting X-ray facility), an X-ray apparatus to be realized at INAF/OAB and that\nwill generate an expanded, uniform and parallel beam of soft X-rays. BEaTriX\nwill be used to perform the functional tests of X-ray focusing modules of large\nX-ray optics such as those for the ATHENA X-ray observatory, using the Silicon\nPore Optics (SPO) as a baseline technology, and Slumped Glass Optics (SGO) as a\npossible alternative. Performing the tests in X-rays provides the advantage of\nan in-situ, at-wavelength quality control of the optical modules produced in\nseries by the industry, performing a selection of the modules with the best\nangular resolution, and, in the case of SPOs, there is also the interesting\npossibility to align the parabolic and the hyperbolic stacks directly under\nX-rays, to minimize the aberrations. However, a parallel beam with divergence\nbelow 2 arcsec is necessary in order to measure mirror elements that are\nexpected to reach an angular resolution of about 4 arcsec, since the ATHENA\nrequirement for the entire telescope is 5 arcsec. Such a low divergence over\nthe typical aperture of modular optics would require an X-ray source to be\nlocated in a several kilometers long vacuum tube. In contrast, BEaTriX will be\ncompact enough (5 m x 14 m) to be housed in a small laboratory, will produce an\nexpanded X-ray beam 60 mm x 200 mm broad, characterized by a very low\ndivergence (1.5 arcsec HEW), strong polarization, high uniformity, and X-ray\nenergy selectable between 1.5 keV and 4.5 keV. In this work we describe the\nBEaTriX layout and show a performance simulation for the X-ray energy of 4.5\nkeV.\n", "  The LAMP (Lightweight Asymmetry and Magnetism Probe) X-ray telescope is a\nmission concept to measure the polarization of X-ray astronomical sources at\n250 eV via imaging mirrors that reflect at incidence angles near the\npolarization angle, i.e., 45 deg. Hence, it will require the adoption of\nmultilayer coatings with a few nanometers d-spacing in order to enhance the\nreflectivity. The nickel electroforming technology has already been\nsuccessfully used to fabricate the high angular resolution imaging mirrors of\nthe X-ray telescopes SAX, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT. We are investigating this\nconsolidated technology as a possible technique to manufacture focusing mirrors\nfor LAMP. Although the very good reflectivity performances of this kind of\nmirrors were already demonstrated in grazing incidence, the reflectivity and\nthe scattering properties have not been tested directly at the unusually large\nangle of 45 deg. Other possible substrates are represented by thin glass foils\nor silicon wafers. In this paper we present the results of the X-ray\nreflectivity campaign performed at the BEAR beamline of Elettra - Sincrotrone\nTrieste on multilayer coatings of various composition (Cr/C, Co/C), deposited\nwith different sputtering parameters on nickel, silicon, and glass substrates,\nusing polarized X-rays in the spectral range 240 - 290 eV.\n", "  Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has been applied to predict flow properties of\nporous media including intrinsic permeability, where it is implicitly assumed\nthat the LBM is equivalent to the incompressible (or near incompressible)\nNavier-Stokes equation. However, in LBM simulations, high-order moments, which\nare completely neglected in the Navier-Stokes equation, are still available\nthrough particle distribution functions. To ensure that the LBM simulation is\ncorrectly working at the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic level, the high-order\nmoments have to be negligible. This requires that the Knudsen number (Kn) is\nsmall so that rarefaction effect can be ignored. In this technical note, we\nelaborate this issue in LBM modelling of porous media flows, which is\nparticularly important for gas flows in ultra-tight media.\n", "  Experiments and numerical simulations of turbulent $^4$He and $^3$He-B have\nestablished that, at hydrodynamic length scales larger than the average\ndistance between quantum vortices, the energy spectrum obeys the same 5/3\nKolmogorov law which is observed in the homogeneous isotropic turbulence of\nordinary fluids. The importance of the 5/3 law is that it points to the\nexistence of a Richardson energy cascade from large eddies to small eddies.\nHowever, there is also evidence of quantum turbulent regimes without Kolmogorov\nscaling. This raises the important questions of why, in such regimes, the\nKolmogorov spectrum fails to form, what is the physical nature of turbulence\nwithout energy cascade, and whether hydrodynamical models can account for the\nunusual behaviour of turbulent superfluid helium. In this work we describe\nsimple physical mechanisms which prevent the formation of Kolmogorov scaling in\nthe thermal counterflow, and analyze the conditions necessary for emergence of\nquasiclassical regime in quantum turbulence generated by injection of vortex\nrings at low temperatures. Our models justify the hydrodynamical description of\nquantum turbulence and shed light into an unexpected regime of vortex dynamics.\n", "  We find a vacuum stationary twisted solution in four-dimensional Einstein\ngravity. Its frame dragging angular velocities are antisymmetric with respect\nto the equatorial plane. It possesses a symmetry of joint inversion of time and\nparity with respect to the equatorial plane. Its Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM)\nmass and angular momentum are zero. It is curved but regular all over the\nmanifold. Its Komar mass and Komar angular momentum are also zero. Its infinite\nred-shift surface coincides with its event horizon, since the event horizon\ndoes not rotate. Furthermore we extend this solution to the massive case, and\nfind some similar properties. This solution is a stationary axisymmetric\nsolution, but not Kerr. It explicitly proves that pure Einstein gravity permits\ndifferent rotational mode other than Kerr. Our results demonstrate that the\nEinstein theory may have much more rich structures than what we ever imagine.\n", "  We explore the connection between the distribution of particles spontaneously\nproduced from an electric field or black hole and the vacuum persistence, twice\nthe imaginary part of the one-loop effective action. Employing the\nreconstruction conjecture, we find the effective action for the Bose-Einstein\nor Fermi-Dirac distribution. The Schwinger effect in ${\\rm AdS}_2$ is computed\nvia the phase-integral method in the static coordinates. The Hawking radiation\nand Schwinger effect of a charged black hole is rederived and interpreted via\nthe phase-integral. Finally, we discuss the relation between the vacuum\npersistence and the trace or gravitational anomalies.\n", "  Opher et al. (2015), Drake et al. (2015) have shown that the heliospheric\nmagnetic field results in formation of two-jet structure of the solar wind flow\nin the inner heliosheath, i.e. in the subsonic region between the heliospheric\ntermination shock and the heliopause. In this scenario the heliopause has a\ntube-like topology as compared with a sheet-like topology in the most models of\nthe global heliosphere (e.g. Izmodenov and Alexashov, 2015). In this paper we\nexplore the two-jet scenario for a simplified astrosphere in which 1) the star\nis at rest with respect to the circumstellar medium, 2) radial magnetic field\nis neglected as compared with azimuthal component, 3) the stellar wind outflow\nis assumed to be hypersonic (both the Mach number and the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber are much greater than unity at the inflow boundary). We have shown that\nthe problem can be formulated in dimensionless form, in which the solution\ndepends only on one dimensionless parameter epsilon that is reciprocal of the\nAlfv\\'enic Mach number at the inflow boundary. This parameter is proportional\nto stellar magnetic field. We present the numerical solution of the problem for\nvarious values of epsilon. Three first integrals of the governing ideal MHD\nequations are presented, and we make use of them in order to get the plasma\ndistribution in the jets. Simple relations between distances to the termination\nshock, astropause and the size of the jet are established. These relations\nallow us to determine the stellar magnetic field from the geometrical pattern\nof the jet-like astrosphere.\n", "  Halo nuclei are excellent examples of few-body systems consisting of a core\nand weakly-bound halo nucleons. Where there is only one nucleon in the halo, as\nin 11Be, the many-body problem can be reduced to a two-body problem. The\ncontribution of the 1s1/2 orbital to the ground state configuration in 11Be,\ncharacterized by the spectroscopic factor, S, has been extracted from direct\nreaction data by many groups over the past five decades with discrepant\nresults. An experiment was performed at the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam\nFacility using a 10Be primary beam at four different energies with the goal of\nresolving the discrepancy through a consistent analysis of elastic, inelastic,\nand transfer channels. Faddeev-type calculations, released after the\npublication of the experimental results, show that dynamic core excitation in\nthe transfer process can lead to reduced differential cross sections at higher\nbeam energies. This reduction would lead to the extraction of decreasing values\nof S with increasing beam energy. A 10Be(d,p) measurement at Ed greater than 25\nMeV is necessary to investigate the effects of core excitation in the reaction.\n", "  Fluorescence microscopy is rapidly turning into nanoscopy. Among the various\nnanoscopy methods, the STED/RESOLFT super-resolution family has recently been\nexpanded to image even large fields of view within a few seconds. This advance\nrelies on using light patterns featuring substantial arrays of intensity minima\nfor discerning features by switching their fluorophores between on and off\nstates of fluorescence. Here we show that splitting the light with a grating\nand recombining it in the focal plane of the objective lens renders arrays of\nminima with wavelength-independent periodicity. This colour-independent\ncreation of periodic patterns facilitates coaligned on- and off-switching and\nreadout with combinations chosen from a range of wavelengths. Applying up to\nthree such periodic patterns on the switchable fluorescent proteins Dreiklang\nand rsCherryRev1.4, we demonstrate highly parallelized, multicolour RESOLFT\nnanoscopy in living cells at 60-80 nm resolution for 100 times 100 square\nmicrometers fields of view. We discuss the impact of novel image reconstruction\nalgorithms featuring background elimination by spatial bandpass filtering, as\nwell as strategies that incorporate complete image formation models.\n", "  In this article, we study the non-linear coupling between the stationary\n(i.e. the beating modulation signal) and transient (i.e. the laser quantum\nnoise) dynamics of a laser subjected to frequency shifted optical feedback. We\nshow how the noise power spectrum and more specifically the relaxation\noscillation frequency of the laser are modified under different optical\nfeedback condition. Specifically we study the influence of (i) the amount of\nlight returning to the laser cavity and (ii) the initial detuning between the\nfrequency shift and intrinsic relaxation frequency. The present work shows how\nthe relaxation frequency is related to the strength of the beating signal and\nthe shape of the noise power spectrum gives an image of the Transfer Modulation\nFunction (i.e. of the amplification gain) of the nonlinear-laser dynamics.The\ntheoretical predictions, confirmed by numerical resolutions, are in good\nagreements with the experimental data.\n", "  The aim of this study is first to determine the gravity field of the comet\n67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko and second to derive the solar component of the\nprecession rate and nutation coefficients of the spin axis of the comet\nnucleus, i.e. without the direct, usually larger, effect of outgassing. The\ngravity field, and related moments of inertia, are obtained from two polyhedra,\nthat are provided by the OSIRIS and NAV-CAM experiments on Rosetta, and are\nbased on the assumption of uniform density for the comet nucleus. We also\ncalculate the forced precession rate as well as the nutation coefficients on\nthe basis of Kinoshita's theory of rotation of the rigid Earth and adapted it\nto be able to indirectly include the effect of outgassing on the rotational\nparameters. The 2nd degree denormalized Stokes coefficients of comet 67P C-G\nturn out to be (bracketed numbers refer to second shape model) C20 = -6.74\n[-7.93] * 10^-2, C22 = 2.60 [2.71] * 10^-2 consistent with normalized principal\nmoments of inertia A/MR^2 = 0.13 [0.11], B/MR^2 = 0.23 [0.22], with polar\nmoment c = C/MR^2 = 0.25, depending on the choice of the polyhedron model. The\nobliquity between the rotation axis and the mean orbit normal is 52 degree, and\nthe precession rate only due to solar torques becomes 20-30 \"/y. Oscillations\nin longitude caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun turn out to be of the\norder of 1', oscillations in obliquity can be estimated to be of the order of\n0.5'.\n", "  We investigate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) for a\ntranslationally invariant quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional cubic\nlattice under the periodic boundary conditions. It is known that the ETH holds\nin this model for typical energy eigenstates in the sense that the standard\ndeviation of the expectation values of a local observable in the energy\neigenstates within the microcanonical energy shell vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit, which is called the weak ETH. Here, it is remarked that\nthe diagonal elements of a local observable in the energy representation shows\nthe large deviation behavior. This result implies that the fraction of atypical\neigenstates which do not represent thermal equilibrium is exponentially small.\n", "  In the present work, Cs aberration corrected and monochromated scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy electron energy loss spectroscopy STEM-EELS\nhas been used to explore experimental set-ups that allows bandgaps of high\nrefractive index materials to be determined. Semi-convergence and -collection\nangles in the micro-radian range were combined with off-axis or dark field EELS\nto avoid relativistic losses and guided light modes in the low loss range to\ncontribute to the acquired EEL spectra. Off-axis EELS further suppressed the\nzero loss peak and the tail of the zero loss peak. The bandgap of several\nGaAs-based materials were successfully determined by direct inspection and\nwithout any background subtraction of the EEL spectra. The presented set-up\ndoes not require that the acceleration voltage is set to below the Cerenkov\nlimit and can be applied over the entire acceleration voltage range of modern\nTEMs and for a wide range of specimen thicknesses.\n", "  For the last 100 years, General Relativity (GR) has taken over the\ngravitational theory mantle held by Newtonian Gravity for the previous 200\nyears. This article reviews the status of GR in terms of its self-consistency,\ncompleteness, and the evidence provided by observations, which have allowed GR\nto remain the champion of gravitational theories against several other classes\nof competing theories. We pay particular attention to the role of GR and\ngravity in cosmology, one of the areas in which one gravity dominates and new\nphenomena and effects challenge the orthodoxy. We also review other areas where\nthere are likely conflicts pointing to the need to replace or revise GR to\nrepresent correctly observations and consistent theoretical framework.\nObservations have long been key both to the theoretical liveliness and\nviability of GR. We conclude with a discussion of the likely developments over\nthe next 100 years.\n", "  Nanoindentation is a widely used method for sensitive exploration of the\nmechanical properties of micromechanical systems. We derived an empirical\nanalysis technique to extract stress-strain field gradient and divergence\nrepresentations from nanoindentation measurements. With this approach local\ngradients and heterogeneities can be discovered to obtain more detail about the\nsample's microstructure, thus enhancing the analytic capacity of the\nnanoindentation technique. We analysed nanoindentation tests of bulk solid\nsubstrates, namely bearing and tooling steel, and fused silica. Oscillations of\nthe stress-strain field gradient and divergence induced in the subsurface layer\nby the nanoindentation experiment were revealed. The oscillations were\nespecially prominent in single measurements at low indentation depths (< 100\nnm), whereas they were concealed in the averaged datasets. The amplitude of\nstress-strain field divergence oscillations decayed as a sublinear power-law\nwhen the indenter approached deeper atomic layers, with an exponent -0.9 for\nthe steel and -0.8 for the fused silica. The oscillations were interpreted as\nalternating strain hardening-softening cycles induced in the subsurface layers\nunder the indenter load. A selective assessment of elastic and plastic\nstress-strain field components indicated an elastic-plastic deformation process\nwhere the normal strain is transformed into the shear strain leading to a\nplastic deformation.\n", "  We analyze spacetimes with horizons and study the thermodynamic aspects of\ncausal horizons, suggesting that the resemblance between gravitational and\nthermodynamic systems has a deeper quantum mechanical origin. We find that the\nobserver dependence of such horizons is a direct consequence of associating a\ntemperature and entropy to a spacetime. The geometrical picture of a horizon\nacting as a one-way membrane for information flow can be accepted as a natural\ninterpretation of assigning a quantum field theory to a spacetime with\nboundary, ultimately leading to a close connection with thermodynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we study the smooth transition from solitons to solitary waves\nin localization, relation between energy and velocity, propagation and\nscattering property in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice analytically and\nnumerically. A soliton is a very stable solitary wave that retains its\npermanent structure after interacting with other solitary waves. A soliton\nexists when the energy is small, and it becomes a solitary wave when the energy\nincreases to the threshold. The transition could help to understand the\ndistinctly different heat conduction behaviors of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice\nat low and high temperature.\n", "  Gray (2015) argued that the Fermi paradox (FP) is a misnomer, and it is not a\nvalid paradox. Gray also speculated that the argument was misattributed to\nFermi, whose lunchtime remarks did not pertain to the existence of\nextraterrestrial intelligence, but to the feasibility of interstellar travel.\nInstead, the paradox is ascribed to Hart and Tipler, and it is further\nsuggested that the paradox is not a real problem or research subject and should\nnot be used in debates about SETI projects. The arguments given are\nunpersuasive, ahistorical, and, in at least one instance, clearly hinge on\nliteralistic and uncharitable reading of evidence. Instead, I argue the\nfollowing three points: (i) Contrary to Gray's assertion, the historical issue\nof naming of ideas or concepts is completely divorced from their epistemic\nstatus. (ii) FP is easily and smoothly generalized into the Great Silence\nparadox, so it makes no sense either theoretically or empirically to separate\nthe two. (iii) In sharp contrast to the main implication of Gray's paper, FP\nhas become more aggravated lately due to advances in astrobiology.\n", "  We report progress on extending the relativistic model-independent\nquantization condition for three particles, derived previously by two of us, to\na broader class of theories, as well as progress on checking the formalism. In\nparticular, we discuss the extension to include the possibility of 2->3 and\n3->2 transitions and the calculation of the finite-volume energy shift of an\nEfimov-like three-particle bound state. The latter agrees with the results\nobtained previously using non-relativistic quantum mechanics.\n", "  I discuss the two-particle subleading power corrections in radiative leptonic\n$B \\to \\gamma \\ell \\nu$ decay at next-to-leading order in $\\alpha_s$ with the\ndispersion approach. Employing the method of regions, factorization of the $B\n\\to \\gamma^{\\ast}$ form factors is demonstrated explicitly, at one loop, for a\nspace-like hard-collinear photon. The two-particle soft (end-point)\ncontribution is shown to be suppressed by one power of $\\Lambda/m_b$, in the\nheavy quark limit, compared with the leading power contribution computed from\nQCD factorization. I further report the recent calculation on the\nthree-particle subleading power contribution to the on-shell $B \\to \\gamma$\nform factors at tree level and demonstrate that the \"soft\" and the \"hard\"\nthree-particle corrections are of the same power, in contrast to the\ntwo-particle counterparts, as already speculated from the rapidity divergence\nin the corresponding factorization formulae. Phenomenological implications of\nthe subleading power contributions to the $B \\to \\gamma \\ell \\nu$ amplitude are\nalso addressed in detail, focusing on the determination of the inverse moment\nof the leading-twist $B$-meson distribution amplitude.\n", "  Many microorganisms, with phytoplankton and zooplankton as prominent\nexamples, display phototactic behaviour, that is, the ability to perform\ndirected motion within a light gradient. Here we experimentally demonstrate\nthat sensing of light gradients can also be achieved in a system of synthetic\nphoto-activated microparticles being exposed to an inhomogeneous laser field.\nWe observe a strong orientational response of the particles because of\ndiffusiophoretic torques, which in combination with an intensity-dependent\nparticle motility eventually leads to phototaxis. Since the aligning torques\nsaturate at high gradients, a strongly rectified particle motion is found even\nin periodic asymmetric intensity landscapes. Our results are in excellent\nagreement with numerical simulations of a minimal model and should similarly\napply to other particle propulsion mechanisms. Because light fields can be\neasily adjusted in space and time, this also allows to extend our approach to\ndynamical environments.\n", "  These are notes for four lectures on higher structures in M-theory as\npresented at workshops at the Erwin Schroedinger Institute and Tohoku\nUniversity. The first lecture gives an overview of systems of multiple\nM5-branes and introduces the relevant mathematical structures underlying a\nlocal description of higher gauge theory. In the second lecture, we develop the\ncorresponding global picture. A construction of non-abelian superconformal\ngauge theories in six dimensions using twistor spaces is discussed in the third\nlecture. The last lecture deals with the problem of higher quantization and its\nrelation to loop space. An appendix summarizes the relation between 3-Lie\nalgebras and Lie 2-algebras.\n", "  As the sample of white dwarfs with signatures of planetary systems has grown,\nstatistical studies have begun to suggest our picture of compact debris disk\nformation from disrupted planetary bodies is incomplete. Here we present the\nresults of an effort to extend the preferred dust disk model introduced by\n\\citet{jur03} to include elliptical geometries. We apply this model the\nobserved distribution of fractional infrared luminosities, and explore the\ndifference in preferred parameter spaces for a circular and highly elliptical\nmodel on a well-studied dusty white dwarf.\n", "  We focus on understanding the beaming of gravitational radiation from gamma\nray bursts (GRBs) by approximating GRBs as linearly accelerated point masses.\nFor accelerated point masses, it is known that gravitational radiation is\nbeamed isotropicly at high speeds, and beamed along the polar axis at low\nspeeds. Aside from this knowledge, there has been very little work done on\nbeaming of gravitational radiation from GRBs, and the impact beaming could have\non gravitational wave (GW) detection. We determine the following: (1) the\nobservation angle at which the most power is emitted as a function of speed,\n(2) the maximum ratio of power radiated away as a function of speed, and (3)\nthe angular distribution of power ratios at relativistic and non-relativistic\nspeeds. Additionally the dependence of the beaming of GW radiation on speed is\nessentially the opposite of the beaming of electromagnetic (EM) radiation from\nGRBs. So we investigate why this is the case by calculating the angular EM\nradiation distribution from a linear electric quadrupole, and compare this\ndistribution to the angular gravitational radiation distribution from a GRB.\n", "  An algebraic procedure to find extremal density matrices for any Hamiltonian\nof a qudit system is established. The extremal density matrices for pure states\nprovide a complete description of the system, that is, the energy spectra of\nthe Hamiltonian and their corresponding projectors. For extremal density\nmatrices representing mixed states, one gets mean values of the energy in\nbetween the maximum and minimum energies associated to the pure case. These\nextremal densities give also the corresponding mixture of eigenstates that\nyields the corresponding mean value of the energy. We enhance that the method\ncan be extended to any hermitian operator.\n", "  Hybrid perovskite solar cells, with their power conversion efficiency (PCE)\nexceeding 22%, have been representing a revolutionary concept for future energy\npower generation. Although listed among the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of\n2016, device longevity is the actual bottleneck for their real uptake in the\nmarket. Here we design an ultra-stable molecular junction of two/three\ndimensional (2D/3D) perovskites. It consists of a 2D (HOOC(CH2)2NH3)2PbI4,\nanchored at the oxide substrate, that templates the growth of a highly ordered\n3D CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite stabilizing in the orthorhombic phase, even at room\ntemperature. The unique and exceptional 2D/3D structure yields 14.6% PCE in\nsolar cells with Spiro-OMeTAD and Au, and 12.9% PCE in hole-conductor free\narchitecture. Aiming at the up-scaling of this technology, we realize 10x10 cm2\nlarge-area photovoltaic modules by a low-cost, fully printable,\nindustrial-scale process delivering 11.2% PCE. We demonstrate a record\nstability in the PCE of 5,000 hours, setting the direction for the new\ngeneration of carbon free energy.\n", "  Squeeze out happen when the expanding central fireball flows around a large\nsurface flux tube in a central Au-Au collision at RHIC. We model such an effect\nin a flux tube model. Two particle correlations with respect to the $v_2$ axis\nformed by the soft fireball particles flowing around this large flux tube is a\nway of measuring the effect.\n", "  Over the past years the LHC experiments have reported experimental evidences\nfor processes associated to photon-photon and photon-hadron interactions,\nshowing their potential to investigate the production of low- and high-mass\nsystems in exclusive events. In the particular case of the photoproduction of\nvector mesons, the experimental study of this final state is expected to shed\nlight on the description of the QCD dynamics at small values of the Bjorken-$x$\nvariable. In this paper we extend previous studies for the exclusive $J/\\Psi$\nand $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction in $pp$ collisions based on the nonlinear QCD\ndynamics by performing a detailed study of the final state distributions that\ncan be measured experimentally at the LHC and at the Future Circular Collider.\nPredictions for the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the\nvector mesons and of final-state dimuons are presented for $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} =$ 7, 13, and 100 TeV.\n", "  The development of compact and tunable room temperature sources of coherent\nTHz-frequency signals would open a way for numerous new applications. The\nexisting approaches to THz-frequency generation based on superconductor\nJosephson junctions (JJ), free electron lasers, and quantum cascades require\ncryogenic temperatures or/and complex setups, preventing the miniaturization\nand wide use of these devices. We demonstrate theoretically that a bi-layer of\na heavy metal (Pt) and a bi-axial antiferromagnetic (AFM) dielectric (NiO) can\nbe a source of a coherent THz signal. A spin-current flowing from a\nDC-current-driven Pt layer and polarized along the hard AFM anisotropy axis\nexcites a non-uniform in time precession of magnetizations sublattices in the\nAFM, due to the presence of a weak easy-plane AFM anisotropy. The frequency of\nthe AFM oscillations varies in the range of 0.1-2.0 THz with the driving\ncurrent in the Pt layer from $10^8\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^2$ to\n$10^9\\text{A}/\\text{cm}^2$. The THz-frequency signal from the AFM with the\namplitude exceeding 1 V/cm is picked up by the inverse spin-Hall effect in Pt.\nThe operation of a room-temperature AFM THz-frequency oscillator is similar to\nthat of a cryogenic JJ oscillator, with the energy of the easy-plane magnetic\nanisotropy playing the role of the Josephson energy.\n", "  This article reports on a program to obtain and understand coherent states\nfor general systems. Most recently this has included supersymmetric systems. A\nbyproduct of this work has been studies of squeezed and supersqueezed states.\nTo obtain a physical understanding of these systems has always been a primary\ngoal. In particular, in the work on supersymmetry an attempt to understand the\nrole of Grassmann numbers in quantum mechanics has been initiated.\n"]}
