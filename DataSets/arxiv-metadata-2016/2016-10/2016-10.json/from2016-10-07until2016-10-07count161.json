Hartree-Fock approximation is used for the\nself-consistent description for the first time. It is shown that the accurate\naccount of the exchange interaction between all electrons of the compound leads\nto the significant modification of the atomic valent shell which causes the\nnoticeable charge redistribution inside the endohedral compound.\n", "  We present a detailed formalism for the description of collective electron\nexcitations in fullerenes in the process of the electron inelastic scattering.\nConsidering the system as a spherical shell of a finite width, we show that the\ndifferential cross section is defined by three plasmon excitations, namely two\ncoupled modes of the surface plasmon and the volume plasmon. The interplay of\nthe three plasmons appears due to the electron diffraction of the fullerene\nshell. Plasmon modes of different angular momenta provide dominating\ncontributions to the differential cross section depending on the transferred\nmomentum.\n", "  The results of a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of the C60\ncollective excitations in the process of inelastic scattering of electrons are\npresented. The shape of the electron energy loss spectrum is observed to vary\nwhen the scattering angle increases. This variation arising due to the electron\ndiffraction of the fullerene shell is described by a new theoretical model\nwhich treats the fullerene as a spherical shell of a finite width and accounts\nfor the two modes of the surface plasmon and for the volume plasmon as well. It\nis shown that at small angles, the inelastic scattering cross section is\ndetermined mostly by the symmetric mode of the surface plasmon, while at larger\nangles, the contributions of the antisymmetric surface plasmon and the volume\nplasmon become prominent.\n", "  We introduce a new type of correction for a more accurate description of\nfullerenes within the spherically symmetric jellium model. This correction\nrepresents a pseudopotential which originates from the comparison between an\naccurate ab initio calculation and the jellium model calculation. It is shown\nthat such a correction to the jellium model allows one to account, at least\npartly, for the sp2-hybridization of carbon atomic orbitals. Therefore, it may\nbe considered as a more physically meaningful correction as compared with a\nstructureless square-well pseudopotential which has been widely used earlier.\n", "  We theoretically predict an exotic topological superfluid state with\nspatially modulated pairing gap in one-dimensional spin-orbit-coupled Fermi\ngases. This inhomogeneous topological superfluidity is induced by applying\nsimultaneously a perpendicular Zeeman magnetic field and an equally weighted\nRashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling in one-dimensional optical lattices.\nBased on the self-consistent Bogoliubov--de Gennes theory, we confirm that this\nnovel topological phase is a unique condensation of Cooper pairs, which\nmanifests the interplay between the inhomogeneity of superfluid and its\nnontrivial topological structure. The properties of the emergent Majorana bound\nstates are investigated in detail by examining the associated $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$\ntopological number, the eigenenergy and density of states spectra, as well as\nthe wave functions of the localized Majorana end modes. Experimental\nfeasibility of observing this new topological state of matter is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  By considering photoionization of the C$_{60}$ fullerene, we elucidate the\ncontributions of various classical and quantum physics phenomena appearing in\nthis process. By comparing the results, based on the {\\it ab initio} and model\napproaches, we map the well-resolved features of the photoabsoprtion spectrum\nto single-particle and collective excitations which have the different physical\nnature. It is demonstrated that the peculiarities arising in the\nphotoionization spectrum of C$_{60}$ atop the dominating plasmon excitations\nhave the quantum origin. In particular, we demonstrate that a series of\nindividual peaks can be assigned either to the optically allowed discrete\ntransitions or to ionization of particular molecular orbitals of the system.\nThe analysis performed gives a detailed information on the nature of numerous\nfeatures in the photoabsorption spectrum of C$_{60}$.\n", "  We propose an all optical ultrafast method to highly magnetize general\nquantum magnets using a circularly polarized terahertz laser. The key idea is\nto utilize a circularly polarized laser and its chirping. Through this method,\none can obtain magnetization curves of a broad class of quantum magnets as a\nfunction of time even without any static magnetic field. We numerically\ndemonstrate the laser-induced magnetization process in realistic quantum spin\nmodels and find a condition for the realization. The onset of magnetization can\nbe described by a many-body version of Landau-Zener mechanism. In a particular\nmodel, we show that a plateau state with topological properties can be realized\ndynamically.\n", "  The stability of a single-walled carbon nanotube placed on top of a catalytic\nnickel nanoparticle is investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations.\nAs a case study, we consider the $(12,0)$ nanotube consisting of 720 carbon\natoms and the icosahedral Ni$_{309}$ cluster. An explicit set of\nconstant-temperature simulations is performed in order to cover a broad\ntemperature range from 400 to 1200 K, at which a successful growth of carbon\nnanotubes has been achieved experimentally by means of chemical vapor\ndeposition. The stability of the system depending on parameters of the involved\ninteratomic interactions is analyzed. It is demonstrated that different\nscenarios of the nanotube dynamics atop the nanoparticle are possible depending\non the parameters of the Ni-C potential. When the interaction is weak the\nnanotube is stable and resembles its highly symmetric structure, while an\nincrease of the interaction energy leads to the abrupt collapse of the nanotube\nin the initial stage of simulation. In order to validate the parameters of the\nNi-C interaction utilized in the simulations, DFT calculations of the potential\nenergy surface for carbon-nickel compounds are performed. The calculated\ndissociation energy of the Ni-C bond is in good agreement with the values,\nwhich correspond to the case of a stable and not deformed nanotube simulated\nwithin the MD approach.\n", "  I stress that [PRL 111,240402(2013)] contains no result that need to be\nexplained by so-called Two State Vector Formalism, and closely inspected data\nare in disagreement with claims of Danan, Farfurnik, Bar-Ad, and Vaidman\n", "  In this letter we analyze the effect of the spin dimensionality of a physical\nsystem in two mathematical formulations of the uncertainty principle: a\ngeneralized Heisenberg uncertainty relation valid for all antisymmetric\nN-fermion wavefunctions, and the Fisher-information- based uncertainty relation\nvalid for all antisymmetric N-fermion wavefunctions of central potentials. The\naccuracy of these spin-modified uncertainty relations is examined for all atoms\nfrom Hydrogen to Lawrencium in a self-consistent framework.\n", "  We investigate the existence of resonances for two-centers Coulomb systems\nwith arbitrary charges in two dimensions, defining them in terms of generalised\ncomplex eigenvalues of a non-selfadjoint deformation of the two-centers\nSchr\\\"odinger operator. We construct the resolvent kernels of the operators and\nprove that they can be extended analytically to the second Riemann sheet. The\nresonances are then analysed by means of perturbation theory and numerical\nmethods.\n", "  Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are intuitively known to be the most\nnon-classical ones. They lead to the most radically nonclassical behavior of\nthree or more entangled quantum subsystems. However, in case of two-dimensional\nsystems, it has been shown that GHZ states lead to more robustness of Bell\nnonclassicality in case of geometrical inequalities than in case of Mermin\ninequalities. We investigate various strategies of constructing geometrical\nBell inequalities (BIs) for GHZ states for any dimensionality of subsystems.\n", "  We provide a physical explanation for enhancement of the low-energy electron\nproduction by sensitizing nanoparticles due to irradiation by fast ions. It is\ndemonstrated that a significant increase in the number of emitted electrons\narises from the collective electron excitations in the nanoparticle. We predict\na new mechanism of the yield enhancement due to the plasmon excitations and\nquantitatively estimate its contribution to the electron production. Revealing\nthe nanoscale mechanism of the electron yield enhancement, we provide an\nefficient tool for evaluating the yield of emitted electron from various\nsensitizers. It is shown that the number of low-energy electrons generated by\nthe gold and platinum nanoparticles of a given size exceeds that produced by\nthe equivalent volume of water and by other metallic (e.g., gadolinium)\nnanoparticles by an order of magnitude. This observation emphasizes the\nsensitization effect of the noble metal nanoparticles and endorses their\napplication in novel technologies of cancer therapy with ionizing radiation.\n", "  The yield of electrons generated by gold nanoparticles due to irradiation by\nfast charged projectiles is estimated. The results of calculations are compared\nto those obtained for pure water medium. It is demonstrated that a significant\nincrease in the number of emitted electrons arises from collective electron\nexcitations in the nanoparticle. The dominating enhancement mechanisms are\nrelated to the formation of (i) plasmons excited in a whole nanoparticle, and\n(ii) atomic giant resonances due to excitation of d electrons in individual\natoms. Decay of the collective electron excitations in a nanoparticle embedded\nin a biological medium thus represents an important mechanism of the low-energy\nelectron production. Parameters of the utilized model approach are justified\nthrough the calculation of the photoabsorption spectra of several gold\nnanoparticles, performed by means of time-dependent density-functional theory.\n", "  We consider the functor C that to a unital C*-algebra A assigns the partial\norder set C(A) of its commutative C*-subalgebras ordered by inclusion. We\ninvestigate how some C*-algebraic properties translate under the action of C to\norder-theoretical properties. In particular, we show that A is finite\ndimensional if and only C(A) satisfies certain chain conditions. We eventually\nshow that if A and B are C*-algebras such that A is finite dimensional and C(A)\nand C(B) are order isomorphic, then A and B must be *-isomorphic.\n", "  Space dimensionality is a crucial variable in the analysis of the structure\nand dynamics of natural systems and phenomena. The dimensionality effects of\nthe blackbody radiation has been the subject of considerable research activity\nin recent years. These studies are still somewhat fragmentary, pos- ing\nformidable qualitative and quantitative problems for various scientific and\ntechnological areas. In this work we carry out an information-theoretical\nanalysis of the spectral energy density of a d-dimensional blackbody at\ntemperature T by means of various entropy-like quantities (disequilibrium,\nShannon entropy, Fisher information) as well as by three (dimensionless)\ncomplexity measures (Cr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC). All these\nfrequency-functional quantities are calculated and discussed in terms of\ntemperature and dimensionality. It is shown that all three measures of\ncomplexity have an universal character in the sense that they depend neither on\ntemperature nor on the Planck and Boltzmann constants, but only on the the\nspace dimensionality d. Moreover, they decrease when d is increasing; in\nparticular, the values 2.28415, 1.90979 and 1.17685 are found for the\nCr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC measures of complexity of the\n3-dimensional blackbody radiation, respectively. In addition, beyond the\nfrequency at which the spectral density is maximum (which follows the\nwell-known Wien displacement law), three further characteristic frequencies are\ndefined in terms of the previous entropy quantities; they are shown to obey\nWien-like laws. The potential usefulness of these distinctive features of the\nblackbody spectrum is physically discussed.\n", "  A unified thermodynamic framework for characterization of functional\nmaterials is developed. This framework encompasses linear reversible and\nirreversible processes with thermal, electrical, magnetic, and/or mechanical\neffects coupled. The comprehensive framework combines the principles of\nclassical equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics with electrodynamics\nof continua in the infinitesimal strain regime.\n  In the first part of this paper, linear Thermo-Electro-Magneto-Mechanical\n(TEMM) quasistatic processes are characterized. Thermodynamic stability\nconditions are further imposed on the linear constitutive model and\nrestrictions on the corresponding material constants are derived. The framework\nis then extended to irreversible transport phenomena including thermoelectric,\nthermomagnetic and the state-of-the-art spintronic and spin caloritronic\neffects. Using Onsager's reciprocity relationships and the dissipation\ninequality, restrictions on the kinetic coefficients corresponding to charge,\nheat and spin transport processes are derived. All the constitutive models are\naccompanied by multiphysics interaction diagrams that highlight the various\nprocesses that can be characterized using this framework.\n", "  Gold surfaces host special electronic states that have been understood as a\nprototype of Shockley surface states (SSs). These SSs are commonly employed to\nbenchmark the capability of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nand scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We find that these Shockley SSs can be\nreinterpreted as topologically derived surface states (TDSSs) of a topological\ninsulator (TI), a recently discovered quantum state. Based on band structure\ncalculations, the Z2 topological invariant can be well defined to characterize\nthe nontrivial features of gold that we detect by ARPES. The same TDSSs are\nalso recognized on surfaces of other well-known noble metals (e.g., silver,\ncopper, platinum, and palladium). Besides providing a new understanding of\nnoble metal SSs, finding topological states on late transition metals provokes\ninteresting questions on the role of topological effects in surface-related\nprocesses, such as adsorption and catalysis.\n", "  Heisenberg-like and Fisher-information-based uncertainty relations which\nextend and generalize previous similar expressions are obtained for $N$-fermion\n$d$-dimensional systems. The contributions of both spatial and spin degrees of\nfreedom are taken into account. The accuracy of some of these generalized\nspinned uncertainty-like relations is numerically examined for a large number\nof atomic and molecular systems.\n", "  We show that the \"practical\" Bell inequalities, which use intensities as the\nobserved variables, commonly used in quantum optics and widely accepted in the\ncommunity, suffer from an inherent loophole, which severely limits the range of\nlocal hidden variable theories of light, which are invalidated by their\nviolation. We present alternative inequalities which do not suffer from any\n(theoretical) loophole. The new inequalities use redefined correlation\nfunctions, which involve averaged products of local rates rather than\nintensities. Surprisingly, the new inequalities detect entanglement in\nsituations in which the \"practical\" ones fail. Thus, we have two for the price\non one: full consistency with Bell's Theorem, and better device-independent\ndetection of entanglement.\n", "  We show that a class of parity based solutions to the strong CP problem\npredicts new colored particles with mass at the TeV scale, due to constraints\nfrom Planck suppressed operators. The new particles are copies of the Standard\nModel quarks and leptons. The new quarks can be produced at the LHC and are\neither collider stable or decay into Standard Model quarks through a Higgs, a W\nor a Z boson. We discuss some simple but generic predictions of the models for\nthe LHC and find signatures not related to the traditional solutions of the\nhierarchy problem. We thus provide alternative motivation for new physics\nsearches at the weak scale. We also briefly discuss the cosmological history of\nthese models and how to obtain successful baryogenesis.\n", "  The concept of molecular mechanics force field has been widely accepted\nnowadays for studying various processes in biomolecular systems. In this paper,\nwe suggest a modification for the standard CHARMM force field that permits\nsimulations of systems with dynamically changing molecular topologies. The\nimplementation of the modified force field was carried out in the popular\nprogram MBN Explorer, and, to support the development, we provide several\nillustrative case studies where dynamical topology is necessary. In particular,\nit is shown that the modified molecular mechanics force field can be applied\nfor studying processes where rupture of chemical bonds plays an essential role,\ne.g., in irradiation- or collision-induced damage, and also in transformation\nand fragmentation processes involving biomolecular systems.\n", "  We analyse two possible definitions of the squashed entanglement in an\ninfinite-dimensional bipartite system: direct translation of the\nfinite-dimensional definition and its universal extension. It is shown that the\nboth definitions produce the same lower semicontinuous entanglement measure\npossessing all basis properties of the squashed entanglement on the set of\nstates having at least one finite marginal entropy. Is also shown that the\nsecond definition gives an adequate extension of this measure to the set of all\nstates of infinite-dimensional bipartite system.\n  A general condition relating continuity of the squashed entanglement to\ncontinuity of the quantum mutual information is proved and its corollaries are\nconsidered.\n  Continuity bound for the squashed entanglement under the energy constraint on\none subsystem is obtained by using the tight continuity bound for conditional\nmutual information (proved in the Appendix by using Winter's technique). It is\nshown that the same continuity bound is valid for the entanglement of\nformation. As a result the asymptotic continuity of the both entanglement\nmeasures under the energy constraint on one subsystem is proved.\n", "  For a general class of gas models ---which includes discrete and continuous\nGibbsian models as well as contour or polymer ensembles--- we determine a\n\\emph{diluteness condition} that implies: (1) Uniqueness of the infinite-volume\nequilibrium measure; (2) stability of this measure under perturbations of\nparameters and discretization schemes, and (3) existence of a coupled\nperfect-simulation scheme for the infinite-volume measure together with its\nperturbations and discretizations. Some of these results have previously been\nobtained through methods based on cluster expansions. In contrast, our\ntreatment is purely probabilistic and its diluteness condition is weaker than\nexisting convergence conditions for cluster expansions.\n", "  The BRST-Antifield reformulation of the deformation problem is reviewed in a\nself-contained and heuristic way. The focus is on finding all consistent\ninteraction terms for fields propagating on a Minkowskian D-dimensional\nspacetime. Particular emphasis is put on the physical interpretation for the\nmathematical objects of the formalism.\n", "  The search for superconductivity with higher transition temperature ($T_C$)\nhas long been a challenge in research efforts ever since its first discovery in\n1911. The effort has led to the discovery of various kinds of superconductors\nand progress in the understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. The increase\nof $T_C$ has also evolved; however, the dream of realizing room-temperature\nsuperconductivity is far from reality. For superconductivity to emerge, the\neffective quasiparticle interaction should overcome the repulsive Coulomb\ninteraction. This can be realized via lattice or spin degrees of freedom. An\nalternative pairing mechanism, the excitonic mechanism, was proposed 50 years\nago, hoping to achieve higher $T_C$ than by phonon mediation. As none of\nphysics principles has ever prevented excitonic pairing, the excitonic pairing\nmechanism is revisited here and we show that the effective quasiparticle\ninteraction without lattice and spin can be attractive solely electronically.\n", "  In this work we show how to complete some Hamilton-Jacobi solutions of\nlinear, nonconservative classical oscillatory systems which appeared in the\nliterature and we extend these complete solutions to the quantum mechanical\ncase. In addition, we get the solution of the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation\nfor an electric charge in an oscillating pulsing magnetic field. We also argue\nthat for the case where a charged particle is under the action of an\noscillating magnetic field, one can apply nuclear magnetic resonance techniques\nin order to find experimental results regarding this problem. We obtain all\nresults analytically, showing that the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi formalism is a\npowerful tool to describe quantum mechanics.\n", "  There are very few systems of interacting particles (with continuous\nvariables) for which the entanglement of the concomitant eigenfunctions can be\ncomputed in an exact, analytical way. Here we present analytical calculations\nof the amount of entanglement exhibited by $s$-states of \\emph{spherium}. This\nis a system of two particles (electrons) interacting via a Coulomb potential\nand confined to a $(d-1)$-sphere (that is, to the surface of a $d$-dimensional\nball). We investigate the dependence of entanglement on the radius $R$ of the\nsystem, on the spatial dimensionality $d$, and on energy. We find that\nentanglement increases monotonically with $R$, decreases with $d$, and also\ntends to increase with the energy of the eigenstates. These trends are\ndiscussed and compared with those observed in other two-electron atomic-like\nmodels where entanglement has been investigated.\n", "  Most massive galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole in\ntheir centre surrounded by a tenuous gas environment, leading to no significant\nemission. In these quiescent galaxies, tidal disruption events represent a\npowerful detection method for the central black hole. Following the disruption,\nthe stellar debris evolves into an elongated gas stream, which partly falls\nback towards the disruption site and accretes onto the black hole producing a\nluminous flare. Using an analytical treatment, we investigate the interaction\nbetween the debris stream and the gas environment of quiescent galaxies.\nAlthough we find dynamical effects to be negligible, we demonstrate that\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability can lead to the dissolution of the stream into the\nambient medium before it reaches the black hole, likely dimming the associated\nflare. This result is robust against the presence of a typical stellar magnetic\nfield and fast cooling within the stream. Furthermore, we find this effect to\nbe enhanced for disruptions involving more massive black holes and/or giant\nstars. Consequently, although disruptions of evolved stars have been proposed\nas a useful probe of black holes with masses $\\gtrsim 10^8 \\, M_{\\odot}$, we\nargue that the associated flares are likely less luminous than expected.\n", "  A key physical quantity during reionization is the size of HII regions.\nPrevious studies found a characteristic bubble size which increases rapidly\nduring reionization, with apparent agreement between simulations and analytic\nexcursion set theory. Using four different methods, we critically examine this\nclaim. In particular, we introduce the use of the watershed algorithm -- widely\nused for void finding in galaxy surveys -- which we show to be an unbiased\nmethod with the lowest dispersion and best performance on Monte-Carlo\nrealizations of a known bubble size PDF. We find that a friends-of-friends\nalgorithm declares most of the ionized volume to be occupied by a network of\nvolume-filling regions connected by narrow tunnels. For methods tuned to detect\nthe volume-filling regions, previous apparent agreement between simulations and\ntheory is spurious, and due to a failure to correctly account for the window\nfunction of measurement schemes. The discrepancy is already obvious from visual\ninspection. Instead, HII regions in simulations are significantly larger (by\nfactors of 10-1000 in volume) than analytic predictions. The size PDF is\nnarrower, and evolves more slowly with time, than predicted. It becomes more\nsharply peaked as reionization progresses. These effects are likely caused by\nbubble mergers, which are inadequately modeled by analytic theory. Our results\nhave important consequences for high-redshift 21cm observations, the mean free\npath of ionizing photons, and the visibility of Ly-alpha emitters, and point to\na fundamental failure in our understanding of the characteristic scales of the\nreionization process.\n", "  Motivated by the overwhelming evidence some type of quantum criticality\nunderlies the power-law for the optical conductivity and $T-$linear resistivity\nin the cuprates, we demonstrate here how a scale-invariant or unparticle sector\ncan lead to a unifying description of the observed scaling forms. We adopt the\ncontinuous mass formalism or multi band (flavor) formalism of the unparticle\nsector by letting various microscopic parameters be mass-dependent. In\nparticular, we show that an effective mass that varies with the flavor index as\nwell as a running band edge and lifetime capture the AC and DC transport\nphenomenology of the cuprates. A key consequence of the running mass is that\nthe effective dynamical exponent can differ from the underlying bare critical\nexponent, thereby providing a mechanism for realizing the fractional values of\nthe dynamical exponent required in a previous analysis\\cite{ Hartnoll:2015sea}.\nWe also predict that regardless of the bare dynamical exponent, $z$, a non-zero\nanomalous dimension for the current is required. Physically, the anomalous\ndimension arises because the charge depends on the flavor, mass or energy. The\nequivalent phenomenon in a $d+1$ gravitational construction is the running of\nthe charge along the radial direction. The nature of the superconducting\ninstability in the presence of scale invariant stuff shows that the transition\ntemperature is not necessarily a monotonic function of the pairing interaction.\n", "  In this work we use the extremization method of various information-theoretic\nmeasures (Fisher information, Shannon entropy, Tsallis entropy) for\n$d$-dimensional quantum systems, which complementary describe the spreading of\nthe quantum states of natural systems. Under some given constraints, usually\none or two radial expectation values, this variational method allows us to\ndetermine an extremum-entropy distribution, which is the \\textit{least-biased}\none to characterize the state among all those compatible with the known data.\nThen we use it, together with the spin-dependent uncertainty-like relations of\nDaubechies-Thakkar type, as a tool to obtain relationships between the position\nand momentum radial expectation values of the type $\\langle\nr^{\\alpha}\\rangle^{\\frac{k}{\\alpha}}\\langle p^k\\rangle\\geq f(k,\\alpha,q,N),\nq=2s+1$, for $d$-dimensional systems of $N$ fermions with spin $s$. The\nresulting uncertainty-like products, which take into account both spatial and\nspin degrees of freedom of the fermionic constituents of the system, are shown\nto often improve the best corresponding relationships existing in the\nliterature.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the energy spread and the\ndivergence of electron beams while they interact with different laser pulses at\nintensities where quantum effects and radiation reaction are of relevance. The\ninteraction is modeled with a QED-PIC code and the results are compared with\nthose obtained with a standard PIC code with the addition of a classical\nradiation reaction module and with theoretical predictions. While classical\nradiation reaction is a continuous process, in QED, radiation emission is\nstochastic. The two pictures reconcile in the limit when the emitted photons\nenergy is small compared to the energy of the emitting electrons. The energy\nspread of the electron distribution function always tends to decrease with\nclassical radiation reaction, whereas the stochastic QED emission can also\nenlarge it. These two tendencies compete in the QED-dominated regime. Our\nanalysis, supported by the QED module, reveals an upper limit to the maximal\nattainable energy spread due to stochasticity that depends on laser intensity\nand the electron beam average energy. Beyond this limit, the energy spread\ndecreases. These findings are verified for different laser pulse lengths\nranging from short ~ 30 fs pulses presently available to the long ~ 150 fs\npulses expected in the near-future laser facilities, and compared with a\ntheoretical model. Our results also show that near future experiments will be\nable to probe this transition and to demonstrate the competition between\nenhanced QED induced energy spread and energy spectrum narrowing from classical\nradiation reaction.\n", "  We investigate the linear elastic response of amorphous solids to a shear\nstrain at zero temperature. We find that the response is characterized by at\nleast two distinct shear moduli. The first one, $\\mu_{\\rm ZFC}$, is associated\nwith the linear response of a single energy minimum. The second, $\\mu_{\\rm\nFC}$, is related to sampling, through plastic events, an ensemble of distinct\nenergy minima. We provide examples of protocols that allow one to measure both\nshear moduli. In agreement with a theoretical prediction based on the exact\nsolution in infinite spatial dimensions, the ratio $\\mu_{\\rm FC}/\\mu_{\\rm ZFC}$\nis found to vanish proportionally to the square root of pressure at the jamming\ntransition. Our results establish that amorphous solids are characterized by a\nrugged energy landscape, on which the infinite-dimensional solution can give\nuseful insight.\n", "  Particle ratios provide insight into the hadrochemistry of the event and the\nmechanisms for particle production. In Pb-Pb collisions the relative\nmulti-strange baryon yields exhibit an enhancement with respect to pp\ncollisions, whereas the short-lived K$^{*0}$ resonance is suppressed in the\nmost central events due to re-scattering of its decay daughter particles.\nMeasurements in p-Pb allow us to investigate the development of these effects\nas a function of the system size.\n  We report comprehensive results on light-flavor hadron production measured\nwith the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV,\ncovering a wide range of particle species which includes long-lived hadrons,\nresonances and multi-strange baryons. The measurements include the transverse\nmomentum spectra and the ratios of spectra among different species, and extend\nover a very large transverse momentum region, from $\\approx$100 MeV/$c$ to\n$\\approx$20 GeV/$c$, depending on the particle species.\n", "  In this proceedings contribution, we review the exact solution of the\nanisotropic hydrodynamics equations for a system subject to Gubser flow. For\nthis purpose, we use the leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics equations\nwhich assume that the distribution function is ellipsoidally symmetric in\nlocal-rest-frame momentum. We then prove that the SO(3)_q symmetry in de Sitter\nspace constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form with only one\nindependent anisotropy parameter remaining. As a consequence, the exact\nsolution reduces to the problem of solving two coupled non-linear differential\nequations. We show that, in the limit that the relaxation time goes to zero,\none obtains Gubser's ideal hydrodynamic solution and, in the limit that the\nrelaxation time goes to infinity, one obtains the exact free streaming solution\nobtained originally by Denicol et al. For finite relaxation time, we solve the\nequations numerically and compare to the exact solution of the\nrelaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to Gubser flow. Using\nthis as our standard, we find that anisotropic hydrodynamics describes the\nspatio-temporal evolution of the system better than all currently known\ndissipative hydrodynamics approaches.\n", "  Measurements of quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions have played an\nessential role in understanding the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma\ncreated in such collisions. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector,\ndesigned to trigger on and identify muons based on its precise timing\ninformation, was fully installed in STAR. It opens the door to measure\nquarkonia via the di-muon channel for the first time at the STAR experiment,\nwith the potential to separate different {\\Upsilon} states. In this talk, we\npresent the measurements of J/{\\psi} suppression and elliptic flow at\nmid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV down to low\ntransverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$). The suppression is found to decrease with\nincreasing $p_{\\rm{T}}$ while the elliptic flow is consistent with 0 for\n$p_{\\rm{T}}$ above 2 GeV/c. Furthermore, the measurement of different\n{\\Upsilon} states is explored within the precision of the available statistics.\n", "  Multiple observations of Blue Jets (BJ)) show that BJ emits a fan of\nstreamers similar to a laboratory leader. Moreover,in the exponential\natmosphere those long streamers grow preferentially upward, producing a narrow\nconeconfined by the aperture angle. It was also noticed that BJ are similar to\nthe streamer zone of a leader (streamer corona) and the modeling studies based\non the streamers fractal structure were conducted. Objective of this paper is\nto study the fractal dimension of the bunch of streamer channels emitted by BJ,\nat different altitude and under the varying reduced electric field. This\nsimilarity analysis has been done in three steps: First we described the\ndendritic structure of streamers in corona discharge applying the fractal\ntheory. Then using this model and the data from existing laboratory experiments\nwe obtained the fractal dimension of the branching streamer channels. Finally\nthe model was validated by the observations of BJ available from the\nliterature.\n", "  A state-of-the-art 3+1 dimensional cascade + viscous hydro + cascade model\nvHLLE+UrQMD has been applied to heavy ion collisions in RHIC Beam Energy Scan\nrange $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=7.7\\dots 200$ GeV. Based on comparison to available\nexperimental data it was estimated that an effective value of shear viscosity\nover entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$ in hydrodynamic stage has to decrease from\n$\\eta/s=0.2$ to $0.08$ as collision energy increases from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} =\n7.7$ to $39$ GeV, and to stay at $\\eta/s=0.08$ for $39\\le\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}\\le200$ GeV.\n  In this work we show how an equation of state with first order phase\ntransition affects the hydrodynamic evolution at those collision energies and\nchanges the results of the model as compared to \"default scenario\" with a\ncrossover type EoS from chiral model.\n", "  Entangled physical systems are an important resource in quantum information.\nSome authors claim that in fact all quantum states are entangled. In this paper\nwe show that this claim is incorrect and we discuss in operational way\ndifferences existing between separable and entangled states. A sufficient\ncondition for entanglement is the violation of Bell- CHSH-CH inequalities\nand/or steering inequalities. Since there exist experiments outside the domain\nof quantum physics violating these inequalities therefore in the operational\napproach one cannot say that the entanglement is an exclusive quantum\nphenomenon. We also explain that an unambiguous experimental certification of\nthe entanglement is a difficult task because classical statistical significance\ntests may not be trusted if sample homogeneity cannot be tested or is not\ntested carefully enough.\n", "  We explore new physics (NP) effects in Higgs-Vector boson associated\nproduction at a future International Linear Collider (ILC) via e+e- -> Zh,Zhh,\nusing effective field theory (EFT) techniques. In particular, we focus on a\ncertain class of dimension 6 operators, which are generated by tree-level\nexchanges of a new heavy vector field in the underlying theory. These operators\ninduce new contact terms of the form \\psi\\psi\\phi D\\phi, involving the Standard\nModel (SM) fermions (\\psi), gauge-bosons (D is the covariant derivative) and\nthe SM Higgs field (\\phi). We investigate the high-energy behaviour of these\nnew effective interactions in e+e- -> Zh,Zhh, imposing bounds from electroweak\nprecision measurements, and show that the ILC is an excellent testing ground\nfor probing this type of NP via e+e- -> Zh,Zhh. We also address the validity of\nthe EFT expansion and we study the correlation between the hZ and hhZ signals,\nwhich can be utilized in future searches for NP in these channels.\n", "  The energy budget and dissipation mechanisms during droplet impact on solid\nsurfaces are studied numerically and theoretically. We find that for high\nimpact velocities and negligible surface friction at the solid surface (i.e.\nfree-slip), about one half of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into\nsurface energy, independent of the impact parameters and the detailed energy\nloss mechanism(s). We argue that this seemingly universal rule is related to\nthe deformation mode of the droplet and is reminiscent of pipe flow undergoing\na sudden expansion, for which the head loss can be calculated by multiplying\nthe kinetic energy of the incoming flow by a geometrical factor. For impacts on\na no-slip surface also dissipation in the shear boundary layer at the solid\nsurface is important. In this case the geometric head loss acts as a lower\nbound on the total dissipation (i.e. the spreading on a no-slip surface\napproaches that on a free-slip surface when the droplet viscosity is send to\nzero).\n  This new view on the impact problem allows for simple analytical estimates of\nthe maximum spreading diameter of impacting drops as a function of the impact\nparameters and the properties of the solid surface. It bridges the gap between\nprevious momentum balance approaches and energy balance approaches, which\nhitherto did not give consistent predictions in the low viscosity limit. Good\nagreement is found between our models and experiments, both for impacts on\n\"slippery\" or lubricated surfaces (e.g. Leidenfrost droplet impacts and head-on\ndroplet-droplet collisions) and for impacts on no-slip surfaces.\n", "  The R\\'enyi entropies $R_{p}[\\rho]$, $p>0,\\neq 1$ of the highly-excited\nquantum states of the $D$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are\nanalytically determined by use of the strong asymptotics of the orthogonal\npolynomials which control the wavefunctions of these states, the Laguerre\npolynomials. This Rydberg energetic region is where the transition from\nclassical to quantum correspondence takes place. We first realize that these\nentropies are closely connected to the entropic moments of the\nquantum-mechanical probability $\\rho_n(\\vec{r})$ density of the Rydberg\nwavefunctions $\\Psi_{n,l,\\{\\mu\\}}(\\vec{r})$; so, to the $\\mathcal{L}_{p}$-norms\nof the associated Laguerre polynomials. Then, we determine the asymptotics\n$n\\to\\infty$ of these norms by use of modern techniques of approximation theory\nbased on the strong Laguerre asymptotics. Finally, we determine the dominant\nterm of the R\\'enyi entropies of the Rydberg states explicitly in terms of the\nhyperquantum numbers ($n,l$), the parameter order $p$ and the universe\ndimensionality $D$ for all possible cases $D\\ge 1$. We find that (a) the\nR\\'enyi entropy power decreases monotonically as the order $p$ is increasing\nand (b) the disequilibrium (closely related to the second order R\\'enyi\nentropy), which quantifies the separation of the electron distribution from\nequiprobability, has a quasi-Gaussian behavior in terms of $D$.\n", "  More than three decades ago, Detweiler provided an analytical formula for the\ngravitational resonant frequencies of rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes. In the\npresent work we shall discuss an important discrepancy between the famous {\\it\nanalytical} prediction of Detweiler and the recent {\\it numerical} results of\nZimmerman et. al. In addition, we shall refute the claim that recently appeared\nin the physics literature that the Detweiler-Teukolsky-Press resonance equation\nfor the characteristic gravitational eigenfrequencies of rapidly-rotating Kerr\nblack holes is not valid in the regime of damped quasinormal resonances with\n$\\Im\\omega/T_{\\text{BH}}\\gg1$ (here $\\omega$ and $T_{\\text{BH}}$ are\nrespectively the characteristic quasinormal resonant frequency of the Kerr\nblack hole and its Bekenstein-Hawking temperature). The main goal of the\npresent paper is to highlight and expose this important {\\it black-hole\nquasinormal mystery} (that is, the intriguing discrepancy between the\nanalytical and numerical results regarding the gravitational quasinormal\nresonance spectra of rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes).\n", "  New physics beyond the standard model (SM) can be model-independently\nformulated via dimension-6 effective operators, whose coefficients (cutoffs)\ncharacterize the scales of new physics. We study the probe of new physics\nscales from the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs\nobservables (HO) at the future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory (such as CEPC). To\noptimize constraints of new physics from all available observables, we\nestablish a scheme-independent approach. With this formulation, we treat the SM\nelectroweak parameters and the coefficients of dimension-6 operators on equal\nfooting, which can be fitted simultaneously by the same $\\chi^2$ function. As\ndeviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new physics\nparameters up to linear order and perform an analytical $\\chi^2$ fit to derive\nthe potential reach of the new physics scales. We find that the HO from both\nHiggs produnction and decay rates can probe the new physics scales up to 10TeV\n(and to 44TeV for the case of gluon-involved operator $\\mathcal{O}_g$), and the\nnew physics scales of Yukawa-type operators can be probed by the precision\nHiggs coupling measurements up to (13-25)TeV. Further including the EWPO can\npush the limit up to 35TeV. From this prospect, we demonstrate that the EWPO\nmeasured in the early phase of a Higgs factory can be as important as the Higgs\nobservables. These indirect probes of new physics scales at the Higgs factory\ncan mainly cover the energy range to be directly explored by the next\ngeneration hadron colliders of pp(50-100TeV), such as the SPPC and FCC-hh.\n", "  Though not considered in general, purely baryonic decays could shed light on\nthe puzzle of the baryon number asymmetry in the universe by means of a better\nunderstanding of the baryonic nature of our matter world. As such, they\nconstitute a yet unexplored class of decay processes worth investigating. We\npropose to search for purely baryonic decay processes at the LHCb experiment.\nNo such type of decay has ever been observed. In particular, we concentrate on\nthe decay $\\Lambda_b^0\\to p\\bar pn$, which is the simplest purely baryonic\ndecay mode, with solely spin-1/2 baryons involved. We predict its decay\nbranching ratio to be ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b^0\\to p\\bar\npn)=(2.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2})\\times 10^{-6}$, which is sufficiently large to make the\ndecay mode accessible to LHCb. Our study can be extended to other purely\nbaryonic decays such as $\\Lambda_b^0\\to p\\bar p \\Lambda$ and $\\Lambda_b^0\\to\n\\Lambda\\bar \\Lambda\\Lambda$, as well as to similar decays of anti-triplet\n$b$-baryons such as $\\Xi_b^{0,-}$.\n", "  We use two new hydrodynamical simulations of $\\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity\nto test the methodology used by Wilcox et al. 2015 (W15) in constraining the\neffects of a fifth force on the profiles of clusters of galaxies. We construct\nrealistic simulated stacked weak lensing and X-ray surface brightness cluster\nprofiles from these cosmological simulations, and then use these data projected\nalong various lines-of-sight to test the spherical symmetry of our stacking\nprocedure. We also test the applicability of the NFW profile to model weak\nlensing profiles of clusters in $f(R)$ gravity. Finally, we test the validity\nof the analytical model developed in W15 against the simulated profiles.\nOverall, we find our methodology is robust and broadly agrees with these\nsimulated data. We also apply our full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis\nfrom W15 to our simulated X-ray and lensing profiles, providing consistent\nconstraints on the modified gravity parameters as obtained from the real\ncluster data, e.g. for our $\\Lambda$CDM simulation we obtain $|f_{\\rm{R}0}| <\n8.3 \\times 10^{-5}$ (95% CL), which is in good agreement with the W15\nmeasurement of $|f_{\\rm{R}0}| < 6 \\times 10^{-5}$. Overall, these tests confirm\nthe power of our methodology which can now be applied to larger cluster samples\navailable with the next generation surveys.\n", "  We show that the scale (conformal) anomaly in field theories leads to new\nanomalous transport effects that emerge in an external electromagnetic field in\nan inhomogeneous gravitational background. In inflating geometry the QED scale\nanomaly locally generates an electric current that flows in opposite direction\nwith respect to background electric field (the scale electric effect). In a\nstatic spatially inhomogeneous gravitational background the dissipationless\nelectric current flows transversely both to the magnetic field axis and to the\ngradient of the inhomogeneity (the scale magnetic effect). The anomalous\ncurrents are proportional to the beta function of the theory.\n", "  We consider analytically and numerically head-on collision between two\nself-propelled drops. Each drop is driven by chemical reactions that produce or\nconsume the concentration isotropically. The isotropic distribution of the\nconcentration field is destabilized by motion of the drop which is itself made\nby Marangoni flow from concentration-dependent surface tension. This\nsymmetry-breaking self-propulsion is distinct from other self-propulsion\nmechanisms due to the intrinsic polarity such as squirmers and self-phoretic\nmotion; there is a bifurcation point below which the drop is stationary and\nabove which it moves spontaneously. When two drops moving along the same axis\nwith opposite direction, the interactions arise both from hydrodynamics and\nconcentration overlap. We found that two drops exhibit either elastic collision\nor fusion depending on the distance from the bifurcation point controlled, for\ninstance, by viscosity. The elastic collision results from the balance between\ndissipation and energy injection by chemical reactions. We derive the reduced\nequations for the collision between two drops and analyze the contributions\nfrom the two interactions. The concentration-mediated interaction is found to\ndominate the hydrodynamic interaction.\n", "  This paper describes the Third Public Data Release (DR3) of the Calar Alto\nLegacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. Science-grade quality data for 667\ngalaxies are made public, including the 200 galaxies of the Second Public Data\nRelease (DR2). Data were obtained with the integral-field spectrograph\nPMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Three\ndifferent spectral setups are available, i) a low-resolution V500 setup\ncovering the wavelength range 3749-7500 AA (4240-7140 AA unvignetted) with a\nspectral resolution of 6.0 AA (FWHM), for 646 galaxies, ii) a medium-resolution\nV1200 setup covering the wavelength range 3650-4840 AA (3650-4620 AA\nunvignetted) with a spectral resolution of 2.3 AA (FWHM), for 484 galaxies, and\niii) the combination of the cubes from both setups (called COMBO), with a\nspectral resolution of 6.0 AA and a wavelength range between 3700-7500 AA\n(3700-7140 AA unvignetted), for 446 galaxies. The Main Sample, selected and\nobserved according to the CALIFA survey strategy covers a redshift range\nbetween 0.005 and 0.03, spans the color-magnitude diagram and probes a wide\nrange of stellar mass, ionization conditions, and morphological types. The\nExtension Sample covers several types of galaxies that are rare in the overall\ngalaxy population and therefore not numerous or absent in the CALIFA Main\nSample. All the cubes in the data release were processed using the latest\npipeline, which includes improved versions of the calibration frames and an\neven further improved im- age reconstruction quality. In total, the third data\nrelease contains 1576 datacubes, including ~1.5 million independent spectra. It\nis available at http://califa.caha.es/DR3.\n", "  Fermi's golden rule is of great importance in quantum dynamics. However, in\nmany textbooks on quantum mechanics, its contents and limitations are obscured\nby the approximations and arguments in the derivation, which are inevitable\nbecause of the generic setting considered. Here we propose to introduce it by\nan ideal model, in which the quasi-continuum band consists of equaldistant\nlevels extending from $-\\infty $ to $+\\infty $, and each of them couples to the\ndiscrete level with the same strength. For this model, the transition\nprobability in the first order perturbation approximation can be calculated\nanalytically by invoking the Poisson summation formula. It turns out to be a\n\\emph{piecewise linear} function of time, demonstrating on one hand the key\nfeatures of Fermi's golden rule, and on the other hand that the rule breaks\ndown beyond the \\emph{Heisenberg time}, even when the first order perturbation\napproximation itself is still valid.\n", "  Numerical models of atomic diffusion in magnetic atmospheres of ApBp stars\npredict abundance structures that differ from the empirical abundance maps\nderived with (Zeeman) Doppler mapping (ZDM). Whereas both equilibrium abundance\nstratification calculations and stationary solutions to the time-dependent\ndiffusion equations predict (warped) rings about the magnetic equator in\ndipole-like magnetic geometries, spot-like structures dominate published maps.\nAn in-depth analysis of this apparent disagreement investigates the\ndetectability by means of ZDM of a variety of abundance structures, including\n(warped) rings predicted by theory, but also some complex spot-like structures.\nAs it turns out, a number of published maps have to be considered spurious\neither because strong magnetic fields have been neglected or because they are\nbased on spectra where photon noise dominates over the signal of the alleged\nabundance structures. Even when spectra of high signal to noise ratio are\navailable, it can prove altogether impossible to correctly recover shapes,\npositions and abundances of a mere handful of spots, even using all 4 Stokes\nparameters and knowing the field geometry, the recovery of (warped) rings can\nbe equally challenging. Inversions -- based on just one or two spectral lines\n-- of complex abundance maps usually admit of multiple solutions. It turns out\nthat there is no guarantee that a properly chosen regularisation function will\nlead to the true abundance map. Attention is drawn to the need for a study that\nwould elucidate the relation between the stratified, field-dependent abundance\nstructures predicted by diffusion theory and empirical maps obtained by means\nof \"canonical\" ZDM, i.e. with mean atmospheres and unstratified abundances.\nFinally we point out difficulties arising from the 3D nature of the atomic\ndiffusion process in magnetic ApBp star atmospheres.\n", "  Many calls to improve science education in college and university settings\nhave focused on improving instructor pedagogy. Meanwhile, science education at\nthe K-12 level is undergoing significant changes as a result of the emphasis on\nscientific and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary\ncore ideas. This framework of \"three-dimensional learning\" is based on the\nliterature about how people learn science and how we can help students put\ntheir knowledge to use. Recently, similar changes are underway in higher\neducation by incorporating three-dimensional learning into college science\ncourses. As these transformations move forward, it will become important to\nassess three-dimensional learning both to align assessments with the learning\nenvironment, and to assess the extent of the transformations. In this paper we\nintroduce the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which is\ndesigned to characterize and support the development of assessment tasks in\nbiology, chemistry, and physics that align with transformation efforts. We\ndescribe the development process used by our interdisciplinary team, discuss\nthe validity and reliability of the protocol, and provide evidence that the\nprotocol can distinguish between assessments that have the potential to elicit\nevidence of three-dimensional learning and those that do not.\n", "  The implementation of efficient multigrid preconditioners for elliptic\npartial differential equations (PDEs) is a challenge due to the complexity of\nthe resulting algorithms and corresponding computer code. For sophisticated\nfinite element discretisations on unstructured grids an efficient\nimplementation can be very time consuming and requires the programmer to have\nin-depth knowledge of the mathematical theory, parallel computing and\noptimisation techniques on manycore CPUs. In this paper we show how the\ndevelopment of bespoke multigrid preconditioners can be simplified\nsignificantly by using a framework which allows the expression of the each\ncomponent of the algorithm at the correct abstraction level. Our approach (1)\nallows the expression of the finite element problem in a language which is\nclose to the mathematical formulation of the problem, (2) guarantees the\nautomatic generation and efficient execution of parallel optimised low-level\ncomputer code and (3) is flexible enough to support different abstraction\nlevels and give the programmer control over details of the preconditioner. We\nuse the composable abstractions of the Firedrake/PyOP2 package to demonstrate\nthe efficiency of this approach for the solution of strongly anisotropic PDEs\nin atmospheric modelling. The weak formulation of the PDE is expressed in\nUnified Form Language (UFL) and the lower PyOP2 abstraction layer allows the\nmanual design of computational kernels for a bespoke geometric multigrid\npreconditioner. We compare the performance of this preconditioner to a\nsingle-level method and hypre's BoomerAMG algorithm. The Firedrake/PyOP2 code\nis inherently parallel and we present a detailed performance analysis for a\nsingle node (24 cores) on the ARCHER supercomputer. Our implementation utilises\na significant fraction of the available memory bandwidth and shows very good\nweak scaling on up to 6,144 compute cores.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing is becoming a mature technique for constraining\ncosmological parameters, and future surveys will be able to constrain the dark\nenergy equation of state $w$. When analyzing galaxy surveys, redshift\ninformation has proven to be a valuable addition to angular shear correlations.\nWe forecast parameter constraints on the triplet $(\\Omega_m,w,\\sigma_8)$ for an\nLSST-like photometric galaxy survey, using tomography of the shear-shear power\nspectrum, convergence peak counts and higher convergence moments. We find that\nredshift tomography with the power spectrum reduces the area of the $1\\sigma$\nconfidence interval in $(\\Omega_m,w)$ space by a factor of 8 with respect to\nthe case of the single highest redshift bin. We also find that adding\nnon-Gaussian information from the peak counts and higher-order moments of the\nconvergence field and its spatial derivatives further reduces the constrained\narea in $(\\Omega_m,w)$ by a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. When we add cosmic\nmicrowave background parameter priors from Planck to our analysis, tomography\nimproves power spectrum constraints by a factor of 3. Adding moments yields an\nimprovement by an additional factor of 2, and adding both moments and peaks\nimproves by almost a factor of 3, over power spectrum tomography alone. We\nevaluate the effect of uncorrected systematic photometric redshift errors on\nthe parameter constraints. We find that different statistics lead to different\nbias directions in parameter space, suggesting the possibility of eliminating\nthis bias via self-calibration.\n", "  Disorder or sufficiently strong interactions can render a metallic state\nunstable causing it to turn into an insulating one. Despite the fact that the\ninterplay of these two routes to a vanishing conductivity has been a central\nresearch topic, a unifying picture has not emerged so far. Here, we establish\nthat the two-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model, one of the simplest lattice\nmodels of strong electron correlation does allow for the study of this\ninterplay. In particular, we show that this model at particle-hole symmetry\npossesses three distinct thermodynamic insulating phases and exhibits Anderson\nlocalization. The previously reported metallic phase is identified as a\nfinite-size feature due to the presence of weak localization. We characterize\nthese phases by their electronic density of states, staggered occupation,\nconductivity, and the generalized inverse participation ratio. The implications\nof our findings for other strongly correlated systems are discussed.\n", "  We consider various homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of the AdS_5 x S^5\nsuperstring that can be obtained from the eta-deformed superstring and related\nmodels by singular boosts. The jordanian deformations we obtain in this way\nbehave similarly to the eta-deformed model with regard to supergravity: T\ndualizing the classical sigma model it is possible to find corresponding\nsolutions of supergravity, which, however, have dilatons that prevent T\ndualizing back. Hence the backgrounds of these jordanian deformations are not\nsolutions of supergravity. Still, they do satisfy a set of recently found\nmodified supergravity equations which implies that the corresponding sigma\nmodels are scale invariant. The abelian models that we obtain by singular\nboosts do directly correspond to solutions of supergravity. In addition to our\nmain results we consider contraction limits of our main example, which do\ncorrespond to supergravity solutions.\n", "  We develop an effective field theory (EFT) to describe the few- and many-body\npropagation of one dimensional Rydberg polaritons. We show that the photonic\ntransmission through the Rydberg medium can be found by mapping the propagation\nproblem to a non-equilibrium quench, where the role of time and space are\nreversed. We include effective range corrections in the EFT and show that they\ndominate the dynamics near scattering resonances in the presence of deep bound\nstates. Finally, we show how the long-range nature of the Rydberg-Rydberg\ninteractions induces strong effective $N$-body interactions between Rydberg\npolaritons. These results pave the way towards studying non-perturbative\neffects in quantum field theories using Rydberg polaritons.\n", "  A quantitative description of Coulomb interactions is developed for\ntwo-dimensional superconducting materials, enabling us to compare intrinsic\nwith external screening effects, such as those due to substrates. Using the\nexample of a doped monolayer of MoS2 embedded in a tunable dielectric\nenvironment, we demonstrate that the influence of external screening is limited\nto a length scale, bounded from below by the effective thickness of the\nquasi-two-dimensional material and from above by its intrinsic screening\nlength. As a consequence, it is found that unconventional Coulomb-driven\nsuperconductivity cannot be induced in MoS2 by tuning the substrate properties\nalone. Our calculations of the retarded Morel-Anderson Coulomb potential {\\mu\n*} reveal that the Coulomb interactions, renormalized by the reduced layer\nthickness and the substrate properties, can shift the onset of the\nelectron-phonon driven superconducting phase in monolayer MoS2 but do not\nsignificantly affect the critical temperature at optimal doping.\n", "  Broadband coherent light sources are becoming increasingly important for\nsensing and spectroscopic applications, especially in the mid-infrared and\nterahertz (THz) spectral regions, where the unique absorption characteristics\nof a whole host of molecules are located. The desire to miniaturize such light\nemitters has recently lead to spectacular advances with compact on-chip lasers\nthat cover both of these spectral regions. The long wavelength and the small\nsize of the sources result in a strongly diverging laser beam that is difficult\nto focus on the target that one aims to perform spectroscopy with. Here, we\nintroduce an unconventional solution to this vexing problem relying on a random\nlaser to produce coherent broadband THz radiation as well as an almost\ndiffraction limited far-field emission profile. Our random lasers do not\nrequire any fine-tuning and thus constitute a promising example of practical\ndevice applications for random lasing.\n", "  The long-term monitoring of magnetic cycles in cool stars is a key diagnostic\nin understanding how dynamo generation and amplification of magnetic fields\noccur in stars similar in structure to the Sun. We investigate the temporal\nevolution of a possible magnetic cycle, determined from its large-scale field,\nof 61 Cyg A over its activity cycle using spectropolarimetric observations and\ncompare it to the solar case. We use Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) to\nreconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry over multiple observational\nepochs spread over a time span of nine years. We investigate the time evolution\nof the different components of the large-scale field and compare it with the\nevolution of its chromospheric activity by measuring the flux in three\ndifferent chromospheric indicators: Ca II H&K, H-alpha and Ca II infra red\ntriplet lines. We also compare our results with the star's coronal activity\nusing XMM-Newton observations. The large-scale magnetic geometry of 61 Cyg A\nexhibits polarity reversals in both poloidal and toroidal field components, in\nphase with the chromospheric activity cycle. We also detect weak solar-like\ndifferential rotation with a shear level similar to the Sun. During our\nobservational time span of nine years, 61 Cyg A exhibits solar-like variations\nin its large-scale field geometry as it evolves from minimum activity to\nmaximum activity and vice versa. During its activity minimum in epoch 2007.59,\nZDI reconstructs a simple dipolar geometry which becomes more complex close to\nactivity maximum in epoch 2010.55. The radial field flips polarity and reverts\nback to a simple geometry in epoch 2013.61. The field is strongly dipolar and\nthe evolution of the dipole component of the field is reminiscent of the solar\nbehaviour. The polarity reversal of the large-scale field indicates a magnetic\ncycle that is in phase with the chromospheric and coronal cycle.\n", "  Photoionization models of HII regions require as input a description of the\nionizing SED and of the gas distribution, in terms of ionization parameter U\nand chemical abundances (e.g. O/H and N/O). A strong degeneracy exists between\nthe hardness of the SED and U, which in turn leads to high uncertainties in the\ndetermination of the other parameters, including abundances. One way to resolve\nthe degeneracy is to fix one of the parameters using additional information.\n  For each of the ~ 20000 sources of the CALIFA HII regions catalog, a grid of\nphotoionization models is computed assuming the ionizing SED being described by\nthe underlying stellar population obtained from spectral synthesis modeling.\nThe ionizing SED is then defined as the sum of various stellar bursts of\ndifferent ages and metallicities. This solves the degeneracy between the shape\nof the ionizing SED and U. The nebular metallicity (associated to O/H) is\ndefined using the classical strong line method O3N2 (which gives to our models\nthe status of \"hybrids\"). The remaining free parameters are the abundance ratio\nN/O and the ionization parameter U, which are determined by looking for the\nmodel fitting [NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb. The models are also selected to fit\n[OII]/Hb. This process leads to a set of ~ 3200 models that reproduce\nsimultaneously the three observations.\n  We find that the regions associated to young stellar bursts suffer leaking of\nthe ionizing photons, the proportion of escaping photons having a median of\n80\\%. The set of photoionization models satisfactorily reproduces the electron\ntemperature derived from the [OIII]4363/5007 line ratio. We determine new\nrelations between the ionization parameter U and the [OII]/[OIII] or\n[SII]/[SIII] line ratios. New relations between N/O and O/H and between U and\nO/H are also determined.\n  All the models are publicly available on the 3MdB database.\n", "  The NJL model for the octet baryons, using proper time regularization to\nsimulate some of the features of confinement, is solved self-consistently in\nnuclear matter. This provides an alternative framework to the MIT bag model\nwhich has been used in the quark-meson coupling model. After fitting the\nparameters of the model to the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear\nmatter the model is used to explore the equation of state of pure neutron\nmatter as well as nuclear matter at densities relevant to heavy ion collisions.\nWith a view to future studies of high mass neutron stars, the binding of\nhyperons is also explored.\n", "  Statistical models that analyse (pairwise) relations between variables\nencompass assumptions about the underlying mechanism that generated the\nassociations in the observed data. In the present paper we demonstrate that\nthree Ising model representations exist that, although each proposes a distinct\ntheoretical explanation for the observed associations, are mathematically\nequivalent. This equivalence allows the researcher to interpret the results of\none model in three different ways. We illustrate the ramifications of this by\ndiscussing concepts that are conceived as problematic in their traditional\nexplanation, yet when interpreted in the context of another explanation make\nimmediate sense.\n", "  We present a galaxy cluster survey based on XMM-Newton observations that are\nlocated in Stripe 82 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The survey covers\nan area of 11.25 deg$^2$. The X-ray cluster candidates were selected as\nserendipitously extended detected sources from the third XMM-Newton\nserendipitous source catalogue (3XMM-DR5). A cross-correlation of the candidate\nlist that comprises 94 objects with recently published X-ray and optically\nselected cluster catalogues provided optical confirmations and redshift\nestimates for about half of the candidate sample. We present a catalogue of\nX-ray cluster candidates previously known in X-ray and/or optical bands from\nthe matched catalogues or NED. The catalogue consists of 54 systems with\nredshift measurements in the range of 0.05-1.19 with a median of 0.36. Of\nthese, 45 clusters have spectroscopic confirmations as stated in the matched\ncatalogues. We spectroscopically confirmed another 6 clusters from the\navailable spectroscopic redshifts in the SDSS-DR12. The cluster catalogue\nincludes 17 newly X-ray discovered clusters, while the remainder were detected\nin previous XMM-Newton and/or ROSAT cluster surveys. Based on the available\nredshifts and fluxes given in the 3XMM-DR5 catalogue, we estimated the X-ray\nluminosities and masses for the cluster sample. We also present the list of the\nremaining X-ray cluster candidates (40 objects) that have no redshift\ninformation yet in the literature. Of these candidates, 25 sources are\nconsidered as distant cluster candidates beyond a redshift of 0.6. We also\nsearched for galaxy cluster mergers in our cluster sample and found two strong\ncandidates for newly discovered cluster mergers at redshifts of 0.11 and 0.26.\nThe X-ray and optical properties of these systems are presented.\n", "  The standard numerical tools for studying non-linear collapse of matter are\nNewtonian $N$-body simulations. Previous work has shown that these simulations\nare in accordance with General Relativity (GR) up to first order in\nperturbation theory, provided that the effects from radiation can be neglected.\nIn this paper we show that the present day matter density receives more than\n1$\\%$ corrections from radiation on large scales if Newtonian simulations are\ninitialised before $z=50$. We provide a relativistic framework in which\n\\emph{unmodified} Newtonian simulations are compatible with linear GR even in\nthe presence of radiation. Our idea is to use GR perturbation theory to keep\ntrack of the evolution of relativistic species and the relativistic space-time\nconsistent with the Newtonian trajectories computed in $N$-body simulations. If\nmetric potentials are sufficiently small, they can be computed using a\nfirst-order Einstein--Boltzmann code such as CLASS. We make this idea rigorous\nby defining a class of GR gauges, the \\emph{Newtonian motion} gauges, which are\ndefined such that matter particles follow Newtonian trajectories. We construct\na simple example of a relativistic space-time within which unmodified Newtonian\nsimulations can be interpreted.\n", "  Phase transitions and critical behavior are crucial issues both in\ntheoretical and experimental neuroscience. We report analytic and computational\nresults about phase transitions and self-organized criticality (SOC) in\nnetworks with general stochastic neurons. The stochastic neuron has a firing\nprobability given by a smooth monotonic function $\\Phi(V)$ of the membrane\npotential $V$, rather than a sharp firing threshold. We find that such networks\ncan operate in several dynamic regimes (phases) depending on the average\nsynaptic weight and the shape of the firing function $\\Phi$. In particular, we\nencounter both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions to absorbing\nstates. At the continuous transition critical boundary, neuronal avalanches\noccur whose distributions of size and duration are given by power laws, as\nobserved in biological neural networks. We also propose and test a new\nmechanism to produce SOC: the use of dynamic neuronal gains -- a form of\nshort-term plasticity probably in the axon initial segment (AIS) -- instead of\ndepressing synapses at the dendrites (as previously studied in the literature).\nThe new self-organization mechanism produces a slightly supercritical state,\nthat we called SOSC, in accord to some intuitions of Alan Turing.\n", "  Measurements of the $W^\\pm$ mass ($m_W$) provide an important consistency\ncheck of the Standard Model (SM) and constrain the possibility of physics\nbeyond the SM. Precision measurements of $m_W$ at hadron colliders are inferred\nfrom kinematic distributions of transverse variables. We examine how this\ninference is modified when considering the presence of physics beyond the SM\nexpressed in terms of local contact operators. We show that Tevatron\nmeasurements of $m_W$ using transverse variables are transparent and applicable\nas consistent constraints in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT)\nwith small measurement bias. This means that the leading challenge to\ninterpreting these measurements in the SMEFT is the pure theoretical\nuncertainty in how these measurements are mapped to Lagrangian parameters. We\nstress the need to avoid using naive combinations of Tevatron and LEPII\nmeasurements of $m_W$ without the introduction of any SMEFT theoretical error\nto avoid implicit UV assumptions. In a companion paper, we implement our\nprocedure to consistently incorporate $m_W$ measurements into a global fit.\n", "  The LAMOST-Kepler survey, whose spectra are analyzed in the present paper, is\nthe first large spectroscopic project aimed at characterizing these sources.\nOur work is focused at selecting emission-line objects and chromospherically\nactive stars and on the evaluation of the atmospheric parameters. We have used\na version of the code ROTFIT that exploits a wide and homogeneous collection of\nreal star spectra, i.e. the Indo US library. We provide a catalog with the\natmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H]), the radial velocity (RV) and an\nestimate of the projected rotation velocity (vsini). For cool stars (Teff<6000\nK) we have also calculated the H-alpha and CaII-IRT chromospheric fluxes. We\nhave derived the RV and the atmospheric parameters for 61,753 spectra of 51,385\nstars. Literature data for a few hundred stars have been used to do a quality\ncontrol of our results. The final accuracy of RV, Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]\nmeasurements is about 14 km/s, 3.5%, 0.3 dex, and 0.2 dex, respectively.\nHowever, while the Teff values are in very good agreement with the literature,\nwe noted some issues with the determination of [Fe/H] of metal poor stars and\nthe tendency, for logg, to cluster around the values typical for main sequence\nand red giant stars. We propose correction relations based on these comparison.\nThe RV distribution is asymmetric and shows an excess of stars with negative\nRVs which is larger at low metallicities. We could identify stars with variable\nRV, ultrafast rotators, and emission-line objects. Based on the H-alpha and\nCaII-IRT fluxes, we have found 442 chromospherically active stars, one of which\nis a likely accreting object. The availability of precise rotation periods from\nthe Kepler photometry has allowed us to study the dependency of the\nchromospheric fluxes on the rotation rate for a quite large sample of field\nstars.\n", "  In this work we study a classically scale-invariant extension of the Standard\nModel in which the dark matter and electroweak scales are generated through the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism. The extra $SU(3)_X$ gauge factor gets completely\nbroken by the vacuum expectation values of two scalar triplets. Out of the\neight resulting massive vector bosons the three lightest are stable due to an\nintrinsic $Z_2\\times Z_2'$ discrete symmetry and can constitute dark matter\ncandidates. We analyze the phenomenological viability of the predicted\nmulti-Higgs sector imposing theoretical and experimental constraints. We\nperform a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter predictions of the model\nsolving numerically the set of coupled Boltzmann equations involving all\nrelevant dark matter processes and explore the direct detection prospects of\nthe dark matter candidates.\n", "  We derive the improved estimators for general interactions and employ these\nfor the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. Using a worm algorithm we\nshow how measuring higher-ordered correlators leads to an improved\nhigh-frequency behavior in irreducible quantities such as the one-particle\nself-energy or the irreducible two-particle vertex for non-density-density\ninteractions. A good knowledge of the asymptotics of the two-particle vertex is\nessential for calculating non-local electronic correlations using diagrammatic\nextensions to the dynamical mean field theory as well as for calculating\nsusceptibilities. We test our algorithm against analytic results for the\nmulti-orbital atomic-limit and the Falicov-Kimball model.\n", "  We present a calculation of the twist-3 T-odd chiral-even fragmentation\nfunctions $G^{\\perp}$ and $\\tilde{G}^{\\perp}$ using a spectator model. We\nconsider the effect gluon exchange to calculate all necessary one-loop diagrams\nfor the quark-quark and quark-gluon-quark correlation functions. We find that\nthe gluon loops corrections generate non-zero contribution to these two\nfragmentation function. We numerically calculate their half-$k_T$ moments by\nintegrating over the transverse momentum and also verify the equation of motion\nrelation among $G^{\\perp}$, $\\tilde{G}^{\\perp}$ and the Collins function.\n", "  A tight-binding model of 8-Pmmn borophene, a two-dimensional boron crystal,\nis developed. We confirm that the crystal hosts massless Dirac fermions and the\nDirac points are protected by symmetry. Strain is introduced into the model,\nand it is shown to induce a pseudomagnetic field vector potential and a scalar\npotential. The dependence of the potentials on the strain tensor is calculated.\nThe physical effects controlled by pseudomagnetic field are discussed.\n", "  Measurements of the top quark mass are presented, obtained from CMS data\ncollected in proton proton collisions at the LHC at centre-of-mass energies of\n7 TeV and 8 TeV. The mass of the top quark is measured using several methods\nand channels, including the reconstructed invariant mass distribution of the\ntop quark as well as measurements based on charged particle information. The\ndependence of the mass measurement on the kinematic phase space is\ninvestigated. The results of the various channels are combined and compared to\nthe world average. The top mass is extracted from the inclusive top quark pair\nproduction cross section measured at CMS.\n", "  The nonequilibrium dynamics of anharmonic chains is studied by imposing an\ninitial domain-wall state, in which the two half lattices are prepared in\nequilibrium with distinct parameters. We analyse the Riemann problem for the\ncorresponding Euler equations and, in specific cases, compare with molecular\ndynamics. Additionally, the fluctuations of time-integrated currents are\ninvestigated. In analogy with the KPZ equation, their typical fluctuations\nshould be of size $t^{1/3}$ and have a Tracy-Widom GUE distributed amplitude.\nThe proper extension to anharmonic chains is explained and tested through\nmolecular dynamics. Our results are calibrated against the stochastic LeRoux\nlattice gas.\n", "  We use high accuracy photometric data obtained with the Kepler satellite to\nmonitor the activity modulations of the Kepler-210 planet host star over a time\nspan of more than four years. Following the phenomenology of the star's light\ncurve in combination with a five spot model, we identify six different\nso-called spot seasons. A characteristic, which is common in the majority of\nthe seasons, is the persistent appearance of spots in a specific range of\nlongitudes on the stellar surface. The most prominent period of the observed\nactivity modulations is different for each season and appears to evolve\nfollowing a specific pattern, resembling the changes in the sunspot periods\nduring the solar magnetic cycle. Under the hypothesis that the star exhibits\nsolar-like differential rotation, we suggest differential rotation values of\nKepler-210 that are similar to or smaller than that of the Sun. Finally, we\nestimate spot life times between 60 days and 90 days, taking into consideration\nthe evolution of the total covered stellar surface computed from our model.\n", "  The deviations of the mid-transit times of an exoplanet from a linear\nephemeris are usually the result of gravitational interactions with other\nbodies in the system. However, these types of transit timing variations (TTV)\ncan also be introduced by the influences of star spots on the shape of the\ntransit profile. Here we use the method of unsharp masking to investigate the\nphotometric light curves of planets with ambiguous TTV to compare the features\nin their O - C diagram with the occurrence and in-transit positions of\nspot-crossing events. This method seems to be particularly useful for the\nexamination of transit light curves with only small numbers of in-transit data\npoints, i.e., the long cadence light curves from Kepler satellite. As a proof\nof concept we apply this method to the light curve and the estimated eclipse\ntiming variations of the eclipsing binary KOI-1452, for which we prove their\nnon-gravitational nature. Furthermore, we use the method to study the rotation\nproperties of the primary star of the system KOI-1452 and show that the spots\nresponsible for the timing variations rotate with different periods than the\nmost prominent periods of the system's light curve. We argue that the main\ncontribution in the measured photometric variability of KOI-1452 originates in\ng-mode oscillations, which makes the primary star of the system a {\\gamma}-Dor\ntype variable candidate.\n", "  We consider direct detection prospects for a class of simplified models of\nfermionic dark matter (DM) coupled to left and right-handed Standard Model\nfermions via two charged scalar mediators with arbitrary mixing angle $\\alpha$.\nDM interactions with the nucleus are mediated by higher electromagnetic\nmoments, which, for Majorana DM, is the anapole moment. After giving a full\nanalytic calculation of the anapole moment, including its $\\alpha$ dependence,\nand matching with limits in the literature, we compute the DM-nucleon\nscattering cross-section and show the LUX and future LZ constraints on the\nparameter space of these models. We then compare these results with constraints\ncoming from $Fermi$-LAT continuum and line searches. Results in the\nsupersymmetric limit of these simplified models are provided in all cases. We\nfind that future direct detection experiments will be able to probe most of the\nparameter space of these models for $\\mathcal{O}(100-200)$ GeV DM and lightest\nmediator mass $\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(5\\%)$ larger than the DM mass. The direct\ndetection prospects dwindle for larger DM mass and larger mass gap between the\nDM and the lightest mediator mass, although appreciable regions are still\nprobed for $\\mathcal{O}(200)$ GeV DM and lightest mediator mass $\\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(20\\%)$ larger than the DM mass. The direct detection bounds are\nalso attenuated near certain \"blind spots\" in the parameter space, where the\nanapole moment is severely suppressed due to cancellation of different terms.\nWe carefully study these blind spots and the associated $Fermi$-LAT signals in\nthese regions.\n", "  A selection of searches by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for the\nelectroweak production of SUSY particles are used to study their impact on the\nconstraints on dark matter candidates. The searches use $20\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. A likelihood-driven scan of a\nfive-dimensional effective model focusing on the gaugino--higgsino and Higgs\nsector of the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is\nperformed. This scan uses data from direct dark matter detection experiments,\nthe relic dark matter density and precision flavour physics results. Further\nconstraints from the ATLAS Higgs mass measurement and SUSY searches at LEP are\nalso applied. A subset of models selected from this scan are used to assess the\nimpact of the selected ATLAS searches in this five-dimensional parameter space.\nThese ATLAS searches substantially impact those models for which the mass\n$m(\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1)$ of the lightest neutralino is less than 65 GeV, excluding\n86% of such models. The searches have limited impact on models with larger\n$m(\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1)$ due to either heavy electroweakinos or compressed mass\nspectra where the mass splittings between the produced particles and the\nlightest supersymmetric particle is small.\n", "  We investigate neutrino flavor transformation in the early universe in the\npresence of a lepton asymmetry, focusing on a two-flavor system with 1 - 3\nmixing parameters. We identify five distinct regimes that emerge in an\napproximate treatment neglecting collisions as the initial lepton asymmetry at\nhigh temperature is varied from values comparable to current constraints on the\nlepton number down to values at which the neutrino-neutrino forward-scattering\npotential is negligible. The characteristic phenomena occurring in these\nregimes are (1) large synchronized oscillations, (2) minimal flavor\ntransformation, (3) asymmetric (neutrino- or antineutrino-only) MSW, (4)\npartial MSW, and (5) symmetric MSW. We examine our numerical results in the\nframework of adiabaticity, and we illustrate how they are modified by\ncollisional damping. Finally, we point out the existence of matter-neutrino\nresonances in the early universe and show that they suffer from\nnon-adiabaticity.\n", "  We show the existence of a family of waves that share a common interesting\nproperty affecting the way they propagate and focus. These waves are a\nsuperposition of twin waves, which are conjugate to each other under inversion\nof the propagation direction. In analogy to holography, these twin \"real\" and\n\"virtual\" waves are related respectively to the converging and the diverging\npart of the beam and can be clearly visualized in real space at two distinct\nfoci under the action of a focusing lens. Analytic formulas for the intensity\ndistribution after focusing are derived, while numerical and experimental\ndemonstrations are given for some of the most interesting members of this\nfamily, the accelerating Airy and ring-Airy beams\n", "  Non-Maxwellian electron velocity space distribution functions (EVDF) are\nuseful signatures of plasma conditions and non-local consequences of\ncollisionless magnetic reconnection. In the past, EVDFs were obtained mainly\nfor antiparallel reconnection and under the influence of weak guide-fields in\nthe direction perpendicular to the reconnection plane. EVDFs are, however, not\nwell known, yet, for oblique (or component-) reconnection in dependence on\nstronger guide-magnetic fields and for the exhaust (outflow) region of\nreconnection away from the diffusion region. In view of the multi-spacecraft\nMagnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS), we derived the non-Maxwellian EVDFs of\ncollisionless magnetic reconnection in dependence on the guide-field strength\n$b_g$ from small ($b_g\\approx0$) to very strong ($b_g=8$) guide-fields, taking\ninto account the feedback of the self-generated turbulence. For this sake, we\ncarried out 2.5D fully-kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations using the ACRONYM\ncode. We obtained anisotropic EVDFs and electron beams propagating along the\nseparatrices as well as in the exhaust region of reconnection. The beams are\nanisotropic with a higher temperature in the direction perpendicular rather\nthan parallel to the local magnetic field. The beams propagate in the direction\nopposite to the background electrons and cause instabilities. We also obtained\nthe guide-field dependence of the relative electron-beam drift speed, threshold\nand properties of the resulting streaming instabilities including the strongly\nnon-linear saturation of the self-generated plasma turbulence. This turbulence\nand its non-linear feedback cause non-adiabatic parallel electron acceleration\nand EVDFs well beyond the limits of the quasi-linear approximation, producing\nphase space holes and an isotropizing pitch-angle scattering.\n", "  Newly discovered van der Waals materials like MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$, hexagonal\nboron nitride (h-BN), and recently $\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{N}$ have sparked\nintensive research to unveil the quantum behavior associated with their 2D\nstructure. Of great interest are 2D materials that host single quantum\nemitters. h-BN, with a band gap of 5.95 eV, has been shown to host single\nquantum emitters which are stable at room temperature in the UV and visible\nspectral range. In this paper we investigate correlations between h-BN\nstructural features and emitter location from bulk down to the monolayer at\nroom temperature. We demonstrate that chemical etching and ion irradiation can\ngenerate emitters in h-BN. We analyze the emitters' spectral features and show\nthat they are dominated by the interaction of their electronic transition with\na single Raman active mode of h-BN. Photodynamics analysis reveals diverse\nrates between the electronic states of the emitter. The emitters show excellent\nphoto stability even under ambient conditions and in monolayers. Comparing the\nexcitation polarization between different emitters unveils a connection between\ndefect orientation and the h-BN hexagonal structure. The sharp spectral\nfeatures, color diversity, room-temperature stability, long-lived metastable\nstates, ease of fabrication, proximity of the emitters to the environment,\noutstanding chemical stability, and biocompatibility of h-BN provide a\ncompletely new class of systems that can be used for sensing and quantum\nphotonics applications.\n", "  We analyze the cosmic-ray magnetohydrodynamic (CR MHD) equations to improve\nthe numerical simulations. We propose to solve them in the fully conservation\nform, which is equivalent to the conventional CR MHD equations. In the fully\nconservation form, the CR energy equation is replaced with the CR \"number\"\nconservation, where the CR number density is defined as the three fourths power\nof the CR energy density. The former contains an extra source term, while\nlatter does not. An approximate Riemann solver is derived from the CR MHD\nequations in the fully conservation form. Based on the analysis, we propose a\nnumerical scheme of which solutions satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot relation at\nany shock. We demonstrate that it reproduces the Riemann solution derived by\nPfrommer et al. (2006) for a 1D CR hydrodynamic shock tube problem. We compare\nthe solution with those obtained by solving the CR energy equation. The latter\nsolutions deviate from the Riemann solution seriously, when the CR pressure\ndominates over the gas pressure in the post-shocked gas. The former solutions\nconverge to the Riemann solution and are of the second order accuracy in space\nand time. Our numerical examples include an expansion of high pressure sphere\nin an magnetized medium. Fast and slow shocks are sharply resolved in the\nexample. We also discuss possible extension of the CR MHD equations to evaluate\nthe average CR energy.\n", "  The observation of neutrino masses, mixing and the existence of dark matter\nare amongst the most important signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model\n(SM). In this paper, we propose to extend the SM by a local $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$\ngauge symmetry, two additional complex scalars and three right-handed\nneutrinos. The $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously when one\nof the scalars acquires a vacuum expectation value. The $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ gauge\nsymmetry is known to be anomaly free and can explain the beyond SM measurement\nof the anomalous muon $({\\rm g-2})$ through additional contribution arising\nfrom the extra $Z_{\\mu\\tau}$ mediated diagram. Small neutrino masses are\nexplained naturally through the Type-I seesaw mechanism, while the mixing\nangles are predicted to be in their observed ranges due to the broken\n$L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ symmetry. The second complex scalar is shown to be stable and\nbecomes the dark matter candidate in our model. We show that while the\n$Z_{\\mu\\tau}$ portal is ineffective for the parameters needed to explain the\nanomalous muon $({\\rm g-2})$ data, the correct dark matter relic abundance can\neasily be obtained from annihilation through the Higgs portal. Annihilation of\nthe scalar dark matter in our model can also explain the Galactic Centre gamma\nray excess observed by Fermi-LAT. We show the predictions of our model for\nfuture direct detection experiments and neutrino oscillation experiments.\n", "  We compare the ability of four popular hybrid density functionals (B3LYP,\nB3PW91, HSE, and PBE0) for predicting band gaps of semiconductors and\ninsulators over a large benchmark set using a consistent methodology. We\nobserve no significant statistical dference in their overall performance\nalthough the screened hybrid HSE is more accurate for typical semiconductors.\nHSE can improve its accuracy for large large band gap materials --without\naffecting that of semiconductors-- by including a larger portion of\nHartree-Fock exchange in its short range. Given that screened hybrids are\ncomputationally much less expensive than their global counterparts, we conclude\nthat they are a better option for the black box prediction of band gaps.\n", "  The Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, experimentally determined from the ratio of\nthermal expansion to specific heat, quantifies the pressure dependence of\ncharacteristic energy scales of matter. It is highly enhanced for Kondo lattice\nsystems, whose properties strongly dependent on the pressure sensitive\nantiferromagnetic exchange interaction between f- and conduction electrons. In\nthis review, we focus on the divergence of the Gr\\\"uneisen parameter and its\nmagnetic analogue, the adiabatic magnetocaloric effect, for heavy-fermion\nmetals near quantum critical points. We compare experimental results with\ncurrent theoretical models, including the effect of strong geometrical\nfrustration. We also discuss the possibility to use materials with divergent\nmagnetic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter for adiabatic demagnetization cooling to very\nlow temperatures.\n", "  We consider the possibility of grand unification of the $\\mathrm{ SU(3)_c\n\\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$ model in an SU(6) gauge unification group. Two\npossibilities arise. Unlike other conventional grand unified theories, in SU(6)\none can embed the $\\mathrm{ SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$ model as a\nsubgroup such that different multiplets appear with different multiplicities.\nSuch a scenario may emerge from the flux breaking of the unified group in an\nE(6) F-theory GUT. This provides new ways of achieving gauge coupling\nunification in $\\mathrm{ SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$ models while\nproviding the radiative origin of neutrino masses. Alternatively, a sequential\nvariant of the $\\mathrm{ SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$ model can fit\nwithin a minimal SU(6) grand unification, which in turn can be a natural E(6)\nsubgroup. This minimal SU(6) embedding does not require any bulk exotics to\naccount for the chiral families while allowing for a TeV scale $\\mathrm{\nSU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1)_X}$ model with seesaw-type neutrino\nmasses.\n", "  The heavy fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$ continues to attract great interest\ndue to the unidentified hidden order it develops below 17.5K. The unique Ising\ncharacter of the spin fluctuations and low temperature quasiparticles is well\nestablished. We present detailed measurements of the angular anisotropy of the\nnonlinear magnetization that reveal a $\\cos^4 \\theta$ Ising anisotropy both at\nand above the ordering transition. With Landau theory, we show this implies a\nstrongly Ising character of the itinerant hidden order parameter.\n", "  We have shown previously that SOHO/UVCS data allow us to detect active region\n(AR) outflows at coronal altitudes higher than those reached by other\ninstrumentation. These outflows are thought to be a component of the slow solar\nwind. Our purpose is to study the evolution of the outflows in the intermediate\ncorona from AR 8100, from the time the AR first forms until it dissolves, after\nseveral transits at the solar limb. Data acquired by SOHO/UVCS at the time of\nthe AR limb transits, at medium latitudes and at altitudes ranging from 1.5 to\n2.3 R_sun, were used to infer the physical properties of the outflows through\nthe AR evolution. To this end, we applied the Doppler dimming technique to UVCS\nspectra. These spectra include the H I Lyman alpha line and the O VI doublet\nlines at 1031.9 and 1037.6 A. Plasma speeds and electron densities of the\noutflows were inferred over several rotations of the Sun. AR outflows are\npresent in the newly born AR and persist throughout the entire AR life.\nMoreover, we found two types of outflows at different latitudes, both possibly\noriginating in the same negative polarity area of the AR. We also analyzed the\nbehavior of the Si XII 520 A line along the UVCS slit in an attempt to reveal\nchanges in the Si abundance when different regions are traversed. Although we\nfound some evidence for a Si enrichment in the AR outflows, alternative\ninterpretations are also plausible. Our results demonstrate that outflows from\nARs are detectable in the intermediate corona throughout the whole AR lifetime.\nThis confirms that outflows contribute to the slow wind.\n", "  A scenario-based Neo-Deterministic approach to Seismic Hazard Assessment\n(NDSHA) is available nowadays, which permits considering a wide range of\npossible seismic sources as the starting point for deriving scenarios by means\nof full waveforms modeling. The method does not make use of attenuation\nrelations and naturally supplies realistic time series of ground shaking,\nincluding reliable estimates of ground displacement, readily applicable to\ncomplete engineering analysis. Based on the neo-deterministic approach, an\noperational integrated procedure for seismic hazard assessment has been\ndeveloped that allows for the definition of time dependent scenarios of ground\nshaking, through the routine updating of earthquake predictions, performed by\nmeans of the algorithms CN and M8S. The integrated NDSHA procedure for seismic\ninput definition, which is currently applied to the Italian territory, combines\ndifferent pattern recognition techniques, designed for the space-time\nidentification of strong earthquakes, with algorithms for the realistic\nmodeling of ground motion. Accordingly, a set of deterministic scenarios of\nground motion at bedrock, which refers to the time interval when a strong event\nis likely to occur within the alerted area, is defined both at regional and\nlocal scale. CN and M8S predictions, as well as the related time-dependent\nground motion scenarios associated with the alarmed areas, are routinely\nupdated since 2006. The prospective application of the time-dependent NDSHA\napproach provides information that can be useful in assigning priorities for\ntimely mitigation actions and, at the same time, allows for a rigorous\nvalidation of the proposed methodology. The results from real-time testing of\nthe time-dependent NDSHA scenarios are illustrated with specific reference to\nthe August 24th, 2016 Central Italy earthquake.\n", "  Colloidal magnetic particles embedded in an elastic polymer matrix constitute\na smart material called ferrogel. It responds to an applied external magnetic\nfield by changes in elastic properties, which can be exploited for various\napplications like dampers, vibration absorbers, or actuators. Under appropriate\nconditions, the stress-strain behavior of a ferrogel can display a fascinating\nfeature: superelasticity, the capability to reversibly deform by a huge amount\nwhile barely altering the applied load. In a previous work, using numerical\nsimulations, we investigated this behavior assuming that the magnetic moments\ncarried by the embedded particles can freely reorient to minimize their\nmagnetic interaction energy. Here, we extend the analysis to ferrogels where\nrestoring torques by the surrounding matrix hinder rotations towards a\nmagnetically favored configuration. For example, the particles can be\nchemically cross-linked into the polymer matrix and the magnetic moments can be\nfixed to the particle axes. We demonstrate that these systems still feature a\nsuperelastic regime. As before, the nonlinear stress-strain behavior can be\nreversibly tailored during operation by external magnetic fields. Yet, the\ndifferent coupling of the magnetic moments causes different types of response\nto external stimuli. For instance, an external magnetic field applied parallel\nto the stretching axis hardly affects the superelastic regime but stiffens the\nsystem beyond it. Other smart materials featuring superelasticity, e.g.\nmetallic shape-memory alloys, have already found widespread applications. Our\nsoft polymer systems offer many additional advantages like a typically higher\ndeformability and enhanced biocompatibility combined with high tunability.\n", "  Novel implementations based on dense tensor storage are presented for the\nsinglet-reference perfect quadruples (PQ) [Parkhill, Lawler, and Head-Gordon,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 130, 084101 (2009)] and perfect hextuples (PH) [Parkhill and\nHead-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 024103 (2010)] models. The methods are\nobtained as block decompositions of conventional coupled-cluster theory that\nare exact for four electrons in four orbitals (PQ) and six electrons in six\norbitals (PH), but that can also be applied to much larger systems. PQ and PH\nhave storage requirements that scale as the square, and as the cube of the\nnumber of active electrons, respectively, and exhibit quartic scaling of the\ncomputational effort for large systems. Applications of the new implementations\nare presented for full-valence calculations on linear polyenes (C n H n+2 ),\nwhich highlight the excellent computational scaling of the present\nimplementations that can routinely handle active spaces of hundreds of\nelectrons. The accuracy of the models is studied in the {\\pi} space of the\npolyenes, in hydrogen chains (H 50 ), and in the {\\pi} space of polyacene\nmolecules. In all cases, the results compare favorably to density matrix\nrenormalization group values. With the novel implementation of PQ, active\nspaces of 140 electrons in 140 orbitals can be solved in a matter of minutes on\na single core workstation, and the relatively low polynomial scaling means that\nvery large systems are also accessible using parallel computing.\n", "  The dimensionality of the Hilbert space of a Chern-Simons theory on a 3-fold,\nin the presence of Wilson lines carrying spin representations, had been counted\nby using its link with the Wess-Zumino theory, with level $k$, on the 2-sphere\nwith points (to be called punctures) marked by the piercing of the\ncorresponding Wilson lines and carrying the respective spin representations. It\nis shown, in the weak coupling (large $k$) limit, the formula decouples into\ntwo characteristically distinct parts; one mimics the dimensionality of the\nHilbert space of a collection of non-interacting spin systems and the other is\nan effective overall correction contributed by all the punctures. The exact\nformula yield from this counting has been shown earlier to have resulted from\nthe consideration of the punctures to be distinguishable. We investigate the\nsame counting problem by considering the punctures to be indistinguishable.\nAlthough the full formula remains undiscovered, nonetheless, we are able to\nimpose the relevant statistics for indistinguishable punctures in the\napproximate formula resulting from the weak coupling limit. As an implication\nof this counting, in the context of its relation to that of black hole entropy\ncalculation in quantum geometric approach, we are able to show that the\nlogarithmic area correction, with a coefficient of $-3/2$, that results in this\nmethod of entropy calculation, in independent of whether the punctures are\ndistinguishable or not.\n", "  The fundamental information-theoretic measures (the R\\'enyi $R_{p}[\\rho]$ and\nTsallis $T_{p}[\\rho]$ entropies, $p>0$) of the highly-excited (Rydberg) quantum\nstates of the $D$-dimensional ($D>1$) hydrogenic systems, which include the\nShannon entropy ($p \\to 1$) and the disequilibrium ($p = 2$), are analytically\ndetermined by use of the strong asymptotics of the Laguerre orthogonal\npolynomials which control the wavefunctions of these states. We first realize\nthat these quantities are derived from the entropic moments of the\nquantum-mechanical probability $\\rho(\\vec{r})$ densities associated to the\nRydberg hydrogenic wavefunctions $\\Psi_{n,l,\\{\\mu\\}}(\\vec{r})$, which are\nclosely connected to the $\\mathfrak{L}_{p}$-norms of the associated Laguerre\npolynomials. Then, we determine the ($n\\to\\infty$)-asymptotics of these norms\nin terms of the basic parameters of our system (the dimensionality $D$, the\nnuclear charge and the hyperquantum numbers $(n,l,\\{\\mu\\}$) of the state) by\nuse of recent techniques of approximation theory. Finally, these three entropic\nquantities are analytically and numerically discussed in terms of the basic\nparameters of the system for various particular states.\n", "  The radial expectation values of the probability density of a quantum system\nin position and momentum spaces allow one to describe numerous physical\nquantities of the system as well as to find generalized Heisenberg-like\nuncertainty relations and to bound entropic uncertainty measures. It is known\nthat the position and momentum expectation values of the main prototype of the\n$D$-dimensional Coulomb systems, the $D$-dimensional hydrogenic system, can be\nexpressed in terms of some generalized hypergeometric functions of the type\n$_{p+1}F_p(z)$ evaluated at unity with $p=2$ and $p=3$, respectively. In this\nwork we determine the position and momentum expectation values in the limit of\nlarge $D$ for all hydrogenic states from ground to very excited (Rydberg) ones\nin terms of the spatial dimensionality and the hyperquantum numbers of the\nstate under consideration. This is done by means of two different approaches to\ncalculate the leading term of the special functions $_{3}F_2\\left(1\\right)$ and\n$_{5}F_4\\left(1\\right)$ involved in the large $D$ limit of the position and\nmomentum quantities. Then, these quantities are used to obtain the generalized\nHeisenberg-like and logarithmic uncertainty relations, and some upper and lower\nbounds to the entropic uncertainty measures (Shannon, R\\'enyi, Tsallis) of the\n$D$-dimensional hydrogenic system.\n", "  The study of generic, non-linear, deformations of Special Relativity\nparametrized by a high-energy scale $M$, which was carried out at first order\nin $M$ in Phys.Rev. D86, 084032 (2012), is extended to second order. This can\nbe done systematically through a ('generalized') change of variables from\nmomentum variables that transform linearly. We discuss the different\nperspectives on the meaning of the change of variables, obtain the coefficients\nof modified composition laws and Lorentz transformations at second order, and\nwork out how $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e, the most commonly used example in the\nliterature, is reproduced as a particular case of the generic framework exposed\nhere.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks are the target of many chemical studies (both\nobservational and theoretical) as they contain the building material for\nplanets. Their large vertical and radial gradients in density and temperature\nmake them challenging objects for chemical models. In the outer part of these\ndisks, the large densities and low temperatures provide a particular\nenvironment where the binding of species onto the dust grains can be very\nefficient and can affect the gas-phase chemical composition.\n  We attempt to quantify to what extent the vertical abundance profiles and the\nintegrated column densities of molecules predicted by a detailed gas-grain code\nare affected by the treatment of the molecular hydrogen physisorption at the\nsurface of the grains. We performed three different models using the Nautilus\ngas-grain code. One model uses a H2 binding energy on the surface of water (440\nK) and produces strong sticking of H2. Another model uses a small binding\nenergy of 23 K (as if there were already a monolayer of H2), and the sticking\nof H$_2$ is almost negligible. Finally, the remaining model is an intermediate\nsolution known as the encounter desorption mechanism. We show that the\nefficiency of molecular hydrogen binding (and thus its abundance at the surface\nof the grains) can have a quantitative effect on the predicted column densities\nin the gas phase of major species such as CO, CS, CN, and HCN.\n", "  Massive binary systems are important laboratories in which to probe the\nproperties of massive stars and stellar physics in general. In this context, we\nanalysed optical spectroscopy and photometry of the eccentric short-period\nearly-type binary HD 152218 in the young open cluster NGC 6231. We\nreconstructed the spectra of the individual stars using a separating code. The\nindividual spectra were then compared with synthetic spectra obtained with the\nCMFGEN model atmosphere code. We furthermore analysed the light curve of the\nbinary and used it to constrain the orbital inclination and to derive absolute\nmasses of 19.8 +/- 1.5 and 15.0 +/- 1.1 solar masses. Combining radial velocity\nmeasurements from over 60 years, we show that the system displays apsidal\nmotion at a rate of (2.04^{+.23}_{-.24}) degree/year. Solving the\nClairaut-Radau equation, we used stellar evolution models, obtained with the\nCLES code, to compute the internal structure constants and to evaluate the\ntheoretically predicted rate of apsidal motion as a function of stellar age and\nprimary mass. In this way, we determine an age of 5.8 +/- 0.6 Myr for HD\n152218, which is towards the higher end of, but compatible with, the range of\nages of the massive star population of NGC 6231 as determined from isochrone\nfitting.\n", "  In this work, Stroh's formalism is endowed with causal properties on the\nbasis of an analysis of the radiation condition in the Green tensor of the\nelastodynamic wave equation. The modified formalism is applied to dislocations\nmoving uniformly in an anisotropic medium. In practice, accounting for\ncausality amounts to a simple analytic continuation procedure whereby to the\ndislocation velocity is added an infinitesimal positive imaginary part. This\ndevice allows for a straightforward computation of velocity-dependent field\nexpressions that are valid whatever the dislocation velocity ---including\nsupersonic regimes--- without needing to consider subsonic and supersonic cases\nseparately. As an illustration, the distortion field of a Somigliana\ndislocation of the Peierls-Nabarro-Eshelby-type with finite-width core is\ncomputed analytically, starting from the Green tensor of elastodynamics. To\nobtain the result in the form of a single compact expression, use of the\nmodified Stroh formalism requires splitting the Green function into its\nreactive and radiative parts. In supersonic regimes, the solution obtained\ndisplays Mach cones, which are supported by Dirac measures in the Volterra\nlimit. From these results, an explanation of Payton's `backward' Mach cones\n[R.G. Payton, Z. Angew. Math. Phys. 46, 282--288 (1995)] is given in terms of\nslowness surfaces, and a simple criterion for their existence is derived. The\nfindings are illustrated by full-field calculations from analytical formulas\nfor a dislocation of finite width in iron, and by Huygens-type geometric\nconstructions of Mach cones from ray surfaces.\n", "  The photon-ion merged-beams technique was used at a synchrotron light source\nfor measuring absolute cross sections of double and triple photodetachment of\nO$^{-}$ ions. The experimental photon energy range of 524-543 eV comprised the\nthreshold for K-shell ionization. Using resolving powers of up to 13,000, the\nposition, strength and width of the below-threshold 1s 2s2 2p6 2S resonance as\nwell as the positions of the 1s 2s2 2p5 3P and 1s 2s2 2p5 1P thresholds for\nK-shell ionization were determined with high precision. In addition,\nsystematically enlarged multi-configuration Dirac-Fock calculations have been\nperformed for the resonant detachment cross sections. Results from these\nab-initio computations agree very well with the measurements for the widths and\nbranching fractions for double and triple detachment, if double shake-up (and\n-down) of the valence electrons and the rearrangement of the electron density\nis taken into account. For the absolute cross sections, however, a previously\nfound discrepancy between measurements and theory is confirmed.\n", "  We present a physically consistent interpretation of the dc electrical\nproperties of niobiumnitride (NbN)-based superconducting hot-electron bolometer\n(HEB-) mixers, using concepts of nonequilibrium superconductivity. Through this\nwe clarify what physical information can be extracted from the resistive\ntransition and the dc current-voltage characteristics, measured at suitably\nchosen temperatures, and relevant for device characterization and optimization.\nWe point out that the intrinsic spatial variation of the electronic properties\nof disordered superconductors, such as NbN, leads to a variation from device to\ndevice.\n", "  We present a technique for increasing the internal quality factor of kinetic\ninductance detectors (KIDs) by nulling ambient magnetic fields with a properly\napplied magnetic field. The KIDs used in this study are made from thin-film\naluminum, they are mounted inside a light-tight package made from bulk\naluminum, and they are operated near $150 \\, \\mathrm{mK}$. Since the thin-film\naluminum has a slightly elevated critical temperature ($T_\\mathrm{c} = 1.4 \\,\n\\mathrm{K}$), it therefore transitions before the package ($T_\\mathrm{c} = 1.2\n\\, \\mathrm{K}$), which also serves as a magnetic shield. On cooldown, ambient\nmagnetic fields as small as approximately $30 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu T}$ can produce\nvortices in the thin-film aluminum as it transitions because the bulk aluminum\npackage has not yet transitioned and therefore is not yet shielding. These\nvortices become trapped inside the aluminum package below $1.2 \\, \\mathrm{K}$\nand ultimately produce low internal quality factors in the thin-film\nsuperconducting resonators. We show that by controlling the strength of the\nmagnetic field present when the thin film transitions, we can control the\ninternal quality factor of the resonators. We also compare the noise\nperformance with and without vortices present, and find no evidence for excess\nnoise beyond the increase in amplifier noise, which is expected with increasing\nloss.\n", "  The phenomenon of tumbling of microscopic objects is commonly associated with\nshear flows. We address the question of whether tumbling can also occur in\nstretching-dominated flows. To answer this, we study the dynamics of a\nsemi-flexible trumbbell in a planar extensional velocity field. We show that\nthe trumbbell undergoes a random tumbling-through-folding motion. The\nprobability distribution of long tumbling times is exponential with a time\nscale exponentially increasing with the Weissenberg number.\n", "  We compare numerical solutions to the full field equations to simplified\napproaches based on implementing three collective coordinates for kink-antikink\ninteractions within the $\\varphi^4$ and $\\phi^6$ models in one time and one\nspace dimensions. We particularly pursue the question whether the collective\ncoordinate approximation substantiates the conjecture that vibrational modes\nare important for resonance structures to occur in kink-antikink scattering.\n", "  We present encube $-$ a qualitative, quantitative and comparative\nvisualisation and analysis system, with application to high-resolution,\nimmersive three-dimensional environments and desktop displays. encube extends\nprevious comparative visualisation systems by considering: 1) the integration\nof comparative visualisation and analysis into a unified system; 2) the\ndocumentation of the discovery process; and 3) an approach that enables\nscientists to continue the research process once back at their desktop. Our\nsolution enables tablets, smartphones or laptops to be used as interaction\nunits for manipulating, organising, and querying data. We highlight the\nmodularity of encube, allowing additional functionalities to be included as\nrequired. Additionally, our approach supports a high level of collaboration\nwithin the physical environment. We show how our implementation of encube\noperates in a large-scale, hybrid visualisation and supercomputing environment\nusing the CAVE2 at Monash University, and on a local desktop, making it a\nversatile solution. We discuss how our approach can help accelerate the\ndiscovery rate in a variety of research scenarios.\n", "  The generation of the circular polarization of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) photons\nis discussed in this paper via their interactions with astroparticles in the\npresence or absence of background fields such as magnetic fields and\nnon-commutative space time geometry. Solving quantum Boltzmann equation for\nGRB-photons as a photon ensemble, we discuss the generation of circular\npolarization (as Faraday conversion phase shift $\\Delta \\phi_{FC}$) of GRBs in\nthe following cases: (i) intermediate interactions, i.e. the Compton scattering\nof GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field and in the presence of\nnon-commutative space time geometry, as well as the scattering of GRBs in\ncosmic neutrino background (CNB), and in cosmic microwave background (CMB);\n(ii) interactions with particles and fields in shock wave, i.e. the Compton\nscattering of GRBs with accelerated charged particles in the presence of\nmagnetic fields. We found that (i) after shock wave crossing, the most\ncontribution of $\\Delta \\phi_{FC}$ for energetic GRBs (in order GeV and larger)\ncomes from GRB-CMB interactions, however for low energy GRBs the contributions\nof the Compton scattering of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field\ndominate; (ii) in shock wave crossing, the magnetic filed has significant\neffects on converting GRB's linear polarization to circular one, this effect\ncan be used to better understanding magnetic profile in shock wave. The main\naim of this work is a emphasis that the studying and measuring the circular\npolarization of GRBs are helpful for better understanding of physics and\nmechanism of the generation of GRBs and their interactions before reaching us.\n", "  In this work, we study the quantum Fisher information (QFI) per particle of\nan open (particles can enter and leave the system) and dissipative (far from\nthermodynamical equilibrium) steady state system of two qubits in noisy\nchannels. We concentrate on two noisy channels these are dephasing and\nnon-dephasing channels. We will show that under certain conditions QFI per\nparticle is slightly greater than 1 for both systems. This means that both\nsystems can be slightly entangled.\n", "  We generalize the current algebra of constraints of U-duality-covariant\ncritical superstrings to include the generator responsible for the dynamics of\nthe fundamental brane. This allows us to define $\\kappa$ symmetry and to write\na worldvolume action in Hamiltonian form that is manifestly supersymmetric in\nthe target space. The Lagrangian form of this action is generally covariant,\nbut the worldvolume metric has fewer components than expected.\n", "  Equivalence between algebraic structures generated by parastatisticstriple\nrelations of Green (1953) and Greenberg -- Messiah (1965), and certain\northosymplectic $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Lie superalgebras is\nfound explicitly. Moreover, it is shown that such superalgebras give more\ncomplex para-Fermi and para-Bose systems then ones of Green -- Greenberg --\nMessiah.\n", "  The MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG) has gained great interest in\nneurorehabilitation training due to its high temporal resolution. The challenge\nis to localize the active regions of the brain in a fast and accurate way. In\nthis paper we use an inversion method based on random spatial sampling to solve\nthe real-time MEG inverse problem. Several numerical tests on synthetic but\nrealistic data show that the method takes just a few hundredths of a second on\na laptop to produce an accurate map of the electric activity inside the brain.\nMoreover, it requires very little memory storage. For this reasons the random\nsampling method is particularly attractive in real-time MEG applications.\n", "  We establish universality at the hard edge for general beta ensembles\nprovided that the background potential V is a polynomial such that x -> V(x^2)\nis uniformly convex and beta is larger than or equal to one. The method rests\non the corresponding tridiagonal matrix models, showing that their appropriate\ncontinuum scaling limit is given by the Stochastic Bessel Operator. As\nconjectured by Edelman-Sutton and rigorously established by Ramirez-Rider, the\nlatter characterizes the hard edge in the case of linear potential and all beta\n(the classical \"beta-Laguerre\" ensembles)\n", "  Direct imaging observations constrain the fraction of stars orbited by gas\ngiant planets with separations greater than 10 au to about 0.01 only. This is\nwidely believed to indicate that massive protoplanetary discs rarely fragment\non planetary mass objects. I use numerical simulations of gas clumps embedded\nin massive gas discs to show that these observations are consistent with $\\sim\n0.2 - 10$ planetary mass clumps per star being born in young gravitationally\nunstable discs. A trio of processes -- rapid clump migration, tidal disruption\nand runaway gas accretion -- destroys or transforms all of the simulated clumps\ninto other objects, resulting in a desert of gas giants beyond separation of\napproximately 10 au. The cooling rate of the disc controls which of the three\nprocesses is dominant. For cooling rates faster than a few local dynamical\ntimes, clumps always grow rapidly and become massive brown dwarfs or low mass\nstars. For longer cooling times, post-collapse (high density) planets migrate\ninward to $\\sim 10-20$ au where they open a gap in the disc and then continue\nto migrate inward much less rapidly. Pre-collapse (low density) planets are\ntidally disrupted and may leave massive solid cores behind. Gas giant planets\nobserved inside the desert, such as those in HR 8799, must have followed an\nunusual evolutionary path, e.g., their host disc being dispersed in a\ncatastrophic fashion.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamical systems may be exposed to tipping points, critical\nthresholds at which small changes in the external inputs or in the systems\nparameters abruptly shift the system to an alternative state with a contrasting\ndynamical behavior. While tipping in a fold bifurcation of an equilibrium is\nwell understood, much less is known about tipping of oscillations (limit\ncycles) though this dynamics are the typical response of many natural systems\nto a periodic external forcing, like e.g. seasonal forcing in ecology and\nclimate sciences. We provide a detailed analysis of tipping phenomena in\nperiodically forced systems and show that, when limit cycles are considered, a\ntransient structure, so-called channel, plays a fundamental role in the\ntransition. Specifically, we demonstrate that trajectories crossing such\nchannel conserve, for a characteristic time, the twisting behavior of the\nstable limit cycle destroyed in the fold bifurcation of cycles. As a\nconsequence, this channel acts like a ghost of the limit cycle destroyed in the\ncritical transition and instead of the expected abrupt transition we find a\nsmooth one. This smoothness is also the reason that it is difficult to\nprecisely determine the transition point employing the usual indicators of\ntipping points, like critical slowing down and flickering.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be a discovery machine for\nthe astronomy and physics communities, revealing astrophysical phenomena from\nthe Solar System to the outer reaches of the observable Universe. While many\ndiscoveries will be made using LSST data alone, taking full scientific\nadvantage of LSST will require ground-based optical-infrared (OIR) supporting\ncapabilities, e.g., observing time on telescopes, instrumentation, computing\nresources, and other infrastructure. This community-based study identifies,\nfrom a science-driven perspective, capabilities that are needed to maximize\nLSST science. Expanding on the initial steps taken in the 2015 OIR System\nReport, the study takes a detailed, quantitative look at the capabilities\nneeded to accomplish six representative LSST-enabled science programs that\nconnect closely with scientific priorities from the 2010 decadal surveys. The\nstudy prioritizes the resources needed to accomplish the science programs and\nhighlights ways that existing, planned, and future resources could be\npositioned to accomplish the science goals.\n", "  Quantum information and computation provide a fascinating twist on the notion\nof proofs in computational complexity theory. For instance, one may consider a\nquantum computational analogue of the complexity class \\class{NP}, known as\nQMA, in which a quantum state plays the role of a proof (also called a\ncertificate or witness), and is checked by a polynomial-time quantum\ncomputation. For some problems, the fact that a quantum proof state could be a\nsuperposition over exponentially many classical states appears to offer\ncomputational advantages over classical proof strings. In the interactive proof\nsystem setting, one may consider a verifier and one or more provers that\nexchange and process quantum information rather than classical information\nduring an interaction for a given input string, giving rise to quantum\ncomplexity classes such as QIP, QSZK, and QMIP* that represent natural quantum\nanalogues of IP, SZK, and MIP. While quantum interactive proof systems inherit\nsome properties from their classical counterparts, they also possess distinct\nand uniquely quantum features that lead to an interesting landscape of\ncomplexity classes based on variants of this model.\n  In this survey we provide an overview of many of the known results concerning\nquantum proofs, computational models based on this concept, and properties of\nthe complexity classes they define. In particular, we discuss non-interactive\nproofs and the complexity class QMA, single-prover quantum interactive proof\nsystems and the complexity class QIP, statistical zero-knowledge quantum\ninteractive proof systems and the complexity class \\class{QSZK}, and\nmultiprover interactive proof systems and the complexity classes QMIP, QMIP*,\nand MIP*.\n", "  Here, we present a concept based on the realization that a complex medium can\nbe used as a simple interferometer. Changes in the wavefront of an incident\ncoherent beam can be retrieved by analyzing changes in speckle patterns when\nthe beam passes through a light diffuser. We demonstrate that the spatial\nintensity correlations of the speckle patterns are independent of the light\ndiffusers, and are solely determined by the phase changes of an incident beam.\nWith numerical simulations using the random matrix theory, and an experimental\npressure-driven wavefront-deforming setup using a microfluidic channel, we\ntheoretically and experimentally confirm the universal sensitivity of speckle\nintensity correlations, which is attributed to the conservation of optical\nfield correlation despite multiple light scattering. This work demonstrates\nthat a complex media is a simple interferometer, and presents opportunities to\nreplace complicated reference-beam-assisted interferometers with a simple and\ncompact scattering layer in various applications in metrology, analytical\nchemistry, and biomedicine.\n", "  Excitons in semiconductors and insulators consist of fermionic subsystems,\nelectrons and holes, whose attractive interaction facilitates bound\nquasiparticles with quasi-bosonic character due to even-numbered pair spins. In\nthe presence of a degenerate electron gas, such excitons dissociate due to free\ncarrier screening, leaving a spectrally broad and faint optical signature\nbehind. Contrary to this expected behaviour, we have discovered pronounced\nemission traces in bulk, germanium-doped GaN up to 100 K, mimicking excitonic\nbehaviour at high free electron concentrations from 3.4E19/cm3 to 8.9E19/cm3.\nConsequently, we show that a degenerate, three-dimensional electron gas\nstabilizes a novel class of quasiparticles, named collexons, by many-particle\neffects dominated by exchange of electrons with the Fermi gas. The observation\nof collexons and their stabilisation with rising doping concentration, is\nfacilitated by a superior crystal quality due to perfect substitution of the\nhost atom with the dopant.\n", "  PG0948+534 is currently one of the hottest DA white dwarf stars, and is also\none of the most mysterious. Attempts to model the sharp, deep absorption\nfeatures of this star have been unsuccessful. In these proceedings we describe\nour analysis of PG0948+534. We perform a line survey of the UV spectrum of\nPG0948+534, making detections of 300+ absorption features, and identifying four\ndistinct velocity regimes. We find evidence of circumstellar absorption in the\nprofiles of C {\\sc iv} and Si {\\sc iv}. Using non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium model atmospheres, we are able to correctly model the absorption\nfeatures of the star, providing abundance measurements for C, N, O, and Si for\nPG0948+534 for the first time. We also revise the effective temperature and\ngravity for this star using models including these new abundances.\n", "  The New Horizons flyby of Pluto confirmed the existence of hazes in its\natmosphere. Observations of a large high- to low- phase brightness ratio,\ncombined with the blue color of the haze, suggest that the haze particles are\nfractal aggregates, analogous to the photochemical hazes on Titan. Therefore,\nstudying the Pluto hazes can shed light on the similarities and differences\nbetween the Pluto and Titan atmospheres. We model the haze distribution using\nthe Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres assuming that the\ndistribution is shaped by sedimentation and coagulation of particles\noriginating from photochemistry. Hazes composed of both purely spherical and\npurely fractal aggregate particles are considered. Agreement between model\nresults and occultation observations is obtained with aggregate particles when\nthe downward flux of photochemical products is equal to the column-integrated\nmethane destruction rate ~1.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-14}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, while\nfor spherical particles the mass flux must be 2-3 times greater. This flux is\nnearly identical to the haze production flux of Titan previously obtained by\ncomparing microphysical model results to Cassini observations. The aggregate\nparticle radius is sensitive to particle charging, and a particle charge to\nradius ratio of 30 e-/{\\mu}m is necessary to produce ~0.1-0.2 {\\mu}m aggregates\nnear Pluto's surface, in accordance with forward scattering measurements. Such\na particle charge to radius ratio is 2-4 times higher than those previously\nobtained for Titan. Hazes composed of spheres with the same particle charge to\nradius ratio have particles that are 4 times smaller. These results further\nsuggest that the haze particles are fractal aggregates. We also consider the\neffect of condensation of HCN, and C$_{2}$-hydrocarbons on the haze particles,\nwhich may play an important role in shaping their distributions.\n", "  Indirect reciprocity based on reputation is a leading mechanism driving human\ncooperation, where monitoring of behaviour and sharing reputation-related\ninformation are crucial. Because collecting information is costly, a tragedy of\nthe commons can arise, with some individuals free-riding on information\nsupplied by others. This can be overcome by organising monitors that aggregate\ninformation, supported by fees from their information users. We analyse a\nco-evolutionary model of individuals playing a social dilemma game and monitors\nwatching them; monitors provide information and players vote for a more\nbeneficial monitor. We find that (1) monitors that simply rate defection badly\ncannot stabilise cooperation---they have to overlook defection against\nill-reputed players; (2) such overlooking monitors can stabilise cooperation if\nplayers vote for monitors rather than to change their own strategy; (3) STERN\nmonitors, who rate cooperation with ill-reputed players badly, stabilise\ncooperation more easily than MILD monitors, who do not do so; (4) a STERN\nmonitor wins if it competes with a MILD monitor; and (5) STERN monitors require\na high level of surveillance and achieve only lower levels of cooperation,\nwhereas MILD monitors achieve higher levels of cooperation with loose and thus\nlower cost monitoring.\n", "  Uncertainty relations occupy a fundamental position in quantum mechanics. We\npropose stronger variance-based uncertainty relations for the product and sum\nof variances of two incompatible observables in a finite dimensional Hilbert\nspace. It is shown that the new uncertainty relations provide near-optimal\nstate-dependent bounds, which can be useful for quantum metrology, entanglement\ndetection etc. in quantum information theory. It is further shown that the\nuncertainty relations are related to the \"spreads\" of the distribution of\nmeasurement outcomes caused by incompatible observables. Intuitively, this\nmeans that the ability of learning the distribution has both the upper and\nlower bounds. Combination of these bounds provides naturally an uncertainty\ninterval which captures the essence of uncertainty in quantum theory. Finally,\nwe explain how to employ entropic uncertainty relations to derive lower bounds\nfor the product of variances of incompatible observables.\n", "  We present an isogeometric analysis of time-harmonic exterior acoustic\nproblems. The infinite space is truncated by a fictitious boundary and (simple)\nabsorbing boundary conditions are applied. The truncation error is included in\nthe exact solution so that the reported error is an indicator of the\nperformance of the isogeometric analysis, in particular of the related\npollution error. Numerical results performed with high-order basis functions\n(third or fourth orders) showed no visible pollution error even for very high\nfrequencies. This property combined with exact geometrical representation makes\nisogeometric analysis a very promising platform to solve high-frequency\nacoustic problems.\n", "  We present our recent efforts to determine the matrix elements associated\nwith the transition between the nucleon and a nucleon resonance induced by the\nvector current, which are necessary ingredients for models of neutrino-induced\nreactions in the resonance region. This is accomplished by making the\ncomprehensive analysis of the data for various meson photo- and\nelectro-production reactions off the nucleon within a sophisticated\ncoupled-channels framework, which is known as the ANL-Osaka dynamical\ncoupled-channels model. We also give a brief introduction to our project for\nconstructing a unified neutrino reaction model conducted at the J-PARC Branch\nof the KEK Theory Center.\n", "  Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)\nare attractive materials for next generation nanoscale optoelectronic\napplications. Understanding nanoscale optical behavior of the edges and grain\nboundaries of synthetically grown TMDCs is vital for optimizing their\noptoelectronic properties. Elucidating the nanoscale optical properties of 2D\nmaterials through far-field optical microscopy requires a diffraction-limited\noptical beam diameter sub-micron in size. Here we present our experimental work\non spatial photoluminescence (PL) scanning of large size ( $\\geq 50$ microns)\nmonolayer MoS$_2$ grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a diffraction\nlimited blue laser beam spot (wavelength 405 nm) with a beam diameter as small\nas 200 nm allowing us to probe nanoscale excitonic phenomena which was not\nobserved before. We have found several important features: (i) there exists a\nsub-micron width strip ($\\sim 500$ nm) along the edges that fluoresces $\\sim\n1000 \\%$ brighter than the region far inside; (ii) there is another brighter\nwide region consisting of parallel fluorescing lines ending at the corners of\nthe zig-zag peripheral edges; (iii) there is a giant blue shifted A-excitonic\npeak, as large as $\\sim 120$ meV, in the PL spectra from the edges. Using\ndensity functional theory calculations, we attribute this giant blue shift to\nthe adsorption of oxygen dimers at the edges, which reduces the excitonic\nbinding energy. Our results not only shed light on defect-induced excitonic\nproperties, but also offer an attractive route to tailor optical properties at\nthe TMDC edges through defect engineering.\n", "  Needles at different orientations are placed in an i.i.d. manner at points of\na Poisson point process on $\\mathbb R^2$ of density $\\lambda$. Needles at the\nsame direction have the same length, while needles at different directions\nmaybe of different lengths. We study the geometry of a finite cluster when\nneedles have only two possible orientations and when needles have only three\npossible orientations. In both these cases the asymptotic shape of the finite\ncluster as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ is shown to consists of needles only in two\ndirections. In the two orientations case the shape does not depend on the\norientation but just on the i.i.d. structure of the orientations, while in the\nthree orientations case the shape depend on all the parameters, i.e. the i.i.d.\nstructure of the orientations, the lengths and the orientations of the needles.\n", "  We study the stationary Wigner equation on a bounded, one-dimensional spatial\ndomain with inflow boundary conditions by using the parity decomposition in\n(Barletti and weifel, Trans. Theory Stat. Phys., 507--520, 2001). The\ndecomposition reduces the half-range, two-point boundary value problem into two\ndecoupled initial value problems of the even part and the odd part. Without\nusing a cutoff approximation around zero velocity, we prove that the initial\nvalue problem for the even part is well-posed. For the odd part, we prove the\nuniqueness of the solution in the odd $L^2$-space by analyzing the moment\nsystem. An example is provided to show that how to use the analysis to obtain\nthe solution of the stationary Wigner equation with inflow boundary conditions.\n", "  In 1963, Eugene Paul Wigner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his\ncontributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles,\nparticularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry\nprinciples. There are no disputes about this statement. On the other hand,\nthere still is a question of why the statement did not mention Wigner's 1939\npaper on the Lorentz group, which was regarded by Wigner and many others as his\nmost important contribution in physics. By many physicists, this paper was\nregarded as a mathematical exposition having nothing to do with physics.\nHowever, it has been more than one half century since 1963, and it is of\ninterest to see what progress has been made toward understanding physical\nimplications of this paper and its historical role in physics. Wigner in his\n1963 paper defined the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations do\nnot change the four-momentum of a given particle, and he called them the little\ngroups. Thus, Wigner's little groups are for internal space-time symmetries of\nparticles in the Lorentz-covariant world. Indeed, this subgroup can explain the\nelectron spin and spins of other massive particles. However, for massless\nparticles, there was a gap between his little group and electromagnetic waves\nderivable Maxwell's equations. This gap was not completely removed until 1990.\nThe purpose of this report is to review the stormy historical process in which\nthis gap is cleared. It is concluded that Wigner's little groups indeed can be\ncombined into one Lorentz-covariant formula which can dictate the symmetry of\nthe internal space-time time symmetries of massive and massless particles in\nthe Lorentz covariant world, just like Einstein's energy-momentum relation\napplicable to both slow and massless particles.\n", "  The d-band center model of Hammer and N{\\o}rskov is widely used in\nunderstanding and predicting catalytic activity on transition metal (TM)\nsurfaces. Here, we demonstrate that this model is inadequate for capturing the\ncomplete catalytic activity of the magnetically polarized TM surfaces and\npropose its generalization. We validate the generalized model through\ncomparison of adsorption energies of the NH$_3$ molecule on the surfaces of 3d\nTMs (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn) determined with spin-polarized density\nfunctional theory (DFT)-based methods with the predictions of our model.\nCompared to the conventional d-band model, where the nature of the\nmetal-adsorbate interaction is entirely determined through the energy and the\noccupation of the d-band center, we emphasize that for the surfaces with high\nspin polarization, the metal-adsorbate system can be stabilized through a\ncompetition of the spin-dependent metal-adsorbate interactions.\n", "  Numerical simulations of QCD-like theories which are chirally broken but\nexhibit a very small beta function reveal a flavor-singlet scalar, or\n\"dilatonic meson,\" which is much lighter than any other states except pions. We\ndevelop a systematic low-energy expansion for the pions and the dilatonic\nmeson, in which the presence of the latter is attributed to an approximate\nscale symmetry. In order to justify the power counting we invoke the Veneziano\nlimit, in which the number of flavors $N_f$ in the fundamental representation\ngrows in proportion with the number of colors $N_c$, while the ratio $N_f/N_c$\nis kept close to, but below, the critical value where the conformal window is\nentered.\n", "  Quantum size effect-induced heat capacity of metal nanoparticles at low\ntemperatures was predicted 79 years ago to be exponential. This, however, has\nnot been reported until date. In defiance, we demonstrate here observation of\nexponentially decaying heat capacity, below 45.2 K, associated with quantum\njumps, exceptionally in 4 nm naturally assembled hexagonal closed packed (hcp)\nlattice of nickel nanoparticles; high magnetic fields have negligible effect on\nthese features. Magnetic susceptibilities in contrast reveal evolution of\nquantum size effects with decrease in particle size. They exhibit sharp rise\nbelow about 30 K and vestiges of saturations below 5 K. The former is explained\nby Curie-like characteristics of odd electrons while the latter tend towards\nthe orthogonal even-like case. These characteristics, ascribed to the ensembles\nof Ni nanoparticles, will give a new direction in understanding this crucial\nthermodynamic phenome-non.\n", "  GaP/Si(100) is considered as pseudomporphic virtual substrate for III/V-on-Si\nintegration in order to reduce defects related to polar-on-nonpolar\nheteroepitaxy. The atomic structure of the GaP/Si(100) heterointerface is\ndecisive to yield low defect densities and its dependence on nucleation\nconditions is still under debate. Recently, Beyer et al. suggested the\nformation of a 'pyramidal' structure as a general mechanism at\npolar-on-nonpolar interfaces [A. Beyer et al., Chem. Mat. 28, 3265 (2016)].\nHowever, their DFT studies neglected the dependence of the calculated\ninterfacial energies on appropriate chemical potentials and their findings are\ncontradictory to recent and past experimental data.\n", "  Families of soliton pairs, namely vector solitons, are found within the\ncontext of a coupled nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger system of equations, as\nappropriate for modeling beam propagation in nematic liquid crystals. In the\nfocusing case, bright soliton pairs have been found to exist provided their\namplitudes satisfy a specific condition. In our analytical approach, focused on\nthe defocusing regime, we rely on a multiscale expansion methods, which reveals\nthe existence of dark-dark and antidark-antidark solitons, obeying an effective\nKorteweg-de Vries equation, as well as dark-bright solitons, obeying an\neffective Mel'nikov system. These pairs are discriminated by the sign of a\nconstant that links all physical parameters of the system to the amplitude of\nthe stable continuous wave solutions, and, much like the focusing case, the\nsolitons' amplitudes are linked leading to mutual guiding.\n", "  We have investigated the core issue of atomic lattices in monodispersed Ni\nnanoparticles (NPs) of sizes 3.8 nm to 10.1 nm using detailed analysis of X-ray\ndiffraction, synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and\nmagnetization data. This has revealed the very remarkable coexistence of atomic\nface-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) lattices in samples\nwith particle size less than or equal to 6.0 nm with the prevalence of only fcc\nphase beyond this. They are also associated with reduced coordination number,\nmodified electronic structure, and surface atom coordination with ligands.\nMagnetization data furthermore reveal coexistence of ferromagnetism and\nsuperparamagnetism at 300 K. Considered to be due to dominant roles of ligands,\nthey are likely to open up far-reaching implications to their future\napplications.\n", "  The three parameters Mittag--Leffler function (often referred as the\nPrabhakar function) has important applications, mainly in physics of\ndielectrics, in describing anomalous relaxation of non--Debye type. This paper\nconcerns with the investigation of the conditions, on the characteristic\nparameters, under which the function is locally integrable and completely\nmonotonic; these properties are essential for the physical feasibility of the\ncorresponding models. In particular the classical Havriliak--Negami model is\nextended to a wider range of the parameters. The problem of the numerical\nevaluation of the three parameters Mittag--Leffler function is also addressed\nand three different approaches are discussed and compared. Numerical\nsimulations are hence used to validate the theoretical findings and present\nsome graphs of the function under investigation.\n", "  Electrical properties of multi-layer graphene are subject to variations due\nto random interlayer alignments. In this work we reported graphene interlayer\nconductance without special layer aligning. Ohmic contacts between two graphene\nlayers are observed with resistance variations of more than one order. With\nRaman spectroscopy we identify that the lattice angle between twisted graphene\nlayers is the key variation source. The angular dependence and temperature\ndependence of the interlayer conductance suggest that a phonon assistant\ntunneling mechanism is valid for the interlayer transport of graphene prepared\nby multiple transfer process. We finally derive that the multi-layer graphene\nresistance shows an exponential-like distribution due to the random interlayer\nmisalignments.\n", "  In this work we study theoretically the axial spectral asymmetry of a 1D\nperiodic multilayer systems composed by hybrid two-layers\n(isotropic/anisotropic) and for photon energies close to the electronic energy\ngaps of semiconductors (excitons). The non-normal optical properties of these\nresonant non-magnetic photonic crystals, where linear and quadratic spatial\ndispersion effects are both present, will be computed in the framework of\nexciton-polariton by self-consistent Maxwell-Schroedinger equation solutions in\nthe effective mass approximation. The tailoring of hybrid crystal, where\nexciton-polariton unidirectional oblique propagation is observed, will be\ncomputed by implementing a simple two-layers minimum model.\n", "  Perovskite photovoltaics (PVs) have attracted attention because of their\nexcellent power conversion efficiency (PCE). Critical issues related to large\narea PV performance, reliability and lifetime need to be addressed. Here, we\nshow that doped metal oxides can provide ideal electron selectivity, improved\nreliability and stability for perovskite PVs. We report p-i-n perovskite PVs\nwith device areas ranging from 0.09cm2 to 0.5cm2 incorporating a thick aluminum\ndoped zinc oxide (AZO) electron selective contact with hysteresis-free PCE of\nover 13% and high fill factor values in the range of 80%. AZO provides suitable\nenergy levels for carrier selectivity, neutralizes the presence of pinholes and\nprovides intimate interfaces. Devices using AZO exhibit an average PCE increase\nof over 20% compared with the devices without AZO and maintain the high PCE for\nthe larger area devices reported. Furthermore, the device stability of p-i-n\nperovskite solar cells under the ISOS-D-1 is enhanced when AZO is used, and\nmaintains 100% of the initial PCE for over 1000 hours of exposure when AZO/Au\nis used as the top electrode. Our results indicate the importance of doped\nmetal oxides as carrier selective contacts to achieve reliable and high\nperformance long lived large area perovskite solar cells.\n", "  This paper presents the misestimation of temperature when observations from a\nkappa distributed plasma are analyzed as a Maxwellian. One common method to\ncalculate the space plasma parameters is by fitting the observed distributions\nusing known analytical forms. More often, the distribution function is included\nin a forward model of the instrument's response, which is used to reproduce the\nobserved energy spectrograms for a given set of plasma parameters. In both\ncases, the modeled plasma distribution fits the measurements to estimate the\nplasma parameters. The distribution function is often considered to be\nMaxwellian even though in many cases the plasma is better described by a kappa\ndistribution. In this work we show that if the plasma is described by a kappa\ndistribution, the derived temperature assuming Maxwell distribution can be\nsignificantly off. More specifically, we derive the plasma temperature by\nfitting a Maxwell distribution to pseudo-data produced by a kappa distribution,\nand then examine the difference of the derived temperature as a function of the\nkappa index. We further consider the concept of using a forward model of a\ntypical plasma instrument to fit its observations. We find that the relative\nerror of the derived temperature is highly depended on the kappa index and\noccasionally on the instrument's field of view and response.\n", "  The full monolayer of pentacene adsorbed on rutile TiO$_2$(110) provides an\nintriguing model to study charge-transfer excitations where the optically\nexcited electrons and holes reside on different sides of the internal interface\nbetween the pentacene monolayer and the TiO$_2$ surface. In this work we\ninvestigate the electronic properties of this system with density functional\ntheory, and compute its excitonic and optical properties making use of \\emph{ab\ninitio} matrix elements. The pentacene molecules are found to lie flat on the\nsurface, head to tail, and slightly tilted towards the troughs of the oxygen\nrows of the surface --- in agreement with experiment. Molecular states appear\nin the band gap of the clean TiO$_2$ surface which enable charge transfer\nexcitations directly from the molecular HOMO to the TiO$_2$ conduction band.\nThe calculated optical spectrum shows a strong polarization dependence and\ndisplays excitonic resonances corresponding to the charge-transfer states. We\ncharacterize the computed excitons by their symmetry and location in k-space\nand use this information to explain the polarization dependence of the optical\nspectrum.\n", "  Erosion, entrainment and deposition are complex and dominant, but yet poorly\nunderstood, mechanical processes in geophysical mass flows. Here, we propose a\nnovel, process-based, two-phase, erosion-deposition model capable of adequately\ndescribing these complex phenomena commonly observed in landslides, avalanches,\ndebris flows and bedload transport. The model is based on the jump in the\nmomentum flux including changes of material and flow properties along the\nflow-bed interface and enhances an existing general two-phase mass flow model\n(Pudasaini, 2012). A two-phase variably saturated erodible basal morphology is\nintroduced and allows for the evolution of erosion-deposition-depths,\nincorporating the inherent physical process including momentum and rheological\nchanges of the flowing mixture. By rigorous derivation, we show that\nappropriate incorporation of the mass and momentum productions or losses in\nconservative model formulation is essential for the physically correct and\nmathematically consistent description of erosion-entrainment-deposition\nprocesses. We show that mechanically deposition is the reversed process of\nerosion. We derive mechanically consistent closures for coefficients emerging\nin the erosion rate models. We prove that effectively reduced friction in\nerosion is equivalent to the momentum production. With this, we solve the long\nstanding dilemma of mass mobility, and show that erosion enhances the mass flow\nmobility. The novel enhanced real two-phase model reveals some major aspects of\nthe mechanics associated with erosion, entrainment and deposition. The model\nappropriately captures the emergence and propagation of complex frontal surge\ndynamics associated with the frontal ambient-drag with erosion.\n", "  Piezoresponse Force Microscopy is a powerful but delicate nanoscale technique\nthat measures the mechanical response resulting from the application of a\nhighly localized electric field. Though mechanical response is normally due to\npiezoelectricity, other physical phenomena, especially electrostatic\ninteraction, can contribute to the signal read. We address this problematic\nthrough the use of longer ultra-stiff probes providing state of the art\nsensitivity, with the lowest electrostatic interaction and avoiding working in\nhigh frequency regime. In order to find this solution we develop a theoretical\ndescription addressing the effects of electrostatic contributions in the total\ncantilever vibration and its quantification for different setups. The theory is\nsubsequently tested in a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystal, a\nsample with well-defined 0deg and 180deg domains, using different commercial\navailable conductive tips. We employ the theoretical description to compare the\nelectrostatic contribution effects into the total phase recorded. Through\nexperimental data our description is corroborated for each of the tested\ncommercially available probes. We propose that a larger probe length can be a\nsolution to avoid electrostatic forces, so the cantilever-sample electrostatic\ninteraction is reduced. For hard oxide samples we propose an ultra-stiff\ncantilever which avoids the use of high frequency voltage but still diminishing\nelectrostatic forces. Our proposed commercially available solution have great\nimplications into avoiding artifacts while studying soft biological samples,\nmultiferroic oxides, and thin film ferroelectric materials and it opens a new\nwindow into tip engineering.\n", "  Energy coupling during relativistically intense laser-matter interactions is\nencoded in the attosecond motion of strongly driven electrons at the pre-formed\nplasma-vacuum boundary. Studying and controlling this motion can reveal details\nabout the microscopic processes that govern a vast array of light-matter\ninteraction physics and applications. These include research areas right at the\nforefront of extreme laser-plasma science such as laser-driven ion\nacceleration1, bright attosecond pulse generation2,3 and efficient energy\ncoupling for the generation and study of warm dense matter4. Here we\ndemonstrate attosecond control over the trajectories of relativistic electron\nbunches formed during such interactions by studying the emission of extreme\nultraviolet (XUV) harmonic radiation. We describe how the precise addition of a\nsecond laser beam operating at the second harmonic of the driving laser pulse\ncan significantly transform the interaction by modifying the accelerating\npotential provided by the fundamental frequency to drive strong coherent\nemission. Numerical particle-in-cell code simulations and experimental\nobservations demonstrate that this modification is extremely sensitive to the\nrelative phase of the two beams and can lead to significant enhancements in the\nresulting harmonic yield. This work also reveals that the ability to control\nthese extreme interactions with attosecond precision is an essential\nrequirement for generation of ultra-bright, high temporal contrast attosecond\nradiation for atomic and molecular pump-probe experiments5,6.\n", "  Inferring strength and direction of interactions from electroencephalographic\n(EEG) recordings is of crucial importance to improve our understanding of\ndynamical interdependencies underlying various physiologic and pathophysiologic\nconditions in the human epileptic brain. We here use approaches from symbolic\nanalysis to investigate---in a time-resolved manner---weighted and directed,\nshort- to long-ranged interactions between various brain regions constituting\nthe epileptic network. Our observations point to complex spatial-temporal\ninterdependencies underlying the epileptic process and their role in the\ngeneration of epileptic seizures, despite the massive reduction of the complex\ninformation content of multi-day, multi-channel EEG recordings through\nsymbolisation. We discuss limitations and potential future improvements of this\napproach.\n", "  We propose a new compressive imaging method for reconstructing 2D or 3D\nobjects from their scattered wave-field measurements. Our method relies on a\nnovel, nonlinear measurement model that can account for the multiple scattering\nphenomenon, which makes the method preferable in applications where linear\nmeasurement models are inaccurate. We construct the measurement model by\nexpanding the scattered wave-field with an accelerated-gradient method, which\nis guaranteed to converge and is suitable for large-scale problems. We provide\nexplicit formulas for computing the gradient of our measurement model with\nrespect to the unknown image, which enables image formation with a sparsity-\ndriven numerical optimization algorithm. We validate the method both\nanalytically and with numerical simulations.\n", "  The ability to maintain coherence and control in a qubit is a major\nrequirement for quantum computation. We show theoretically that long coherence\ntimes can be achieved above boiling point of liquid helium in charge qubits of\noxide double quantum dots. Detuning the dots to a fraction of the optical\nphonon energy, increasing the electron-phonon coupling, reducing the\nadiabaticity, or decreasing the temperature enhances the coherence time. We\nconsider a system that is initially decoupled from the phonon bath in the\npolaronic frame of reference and solve the non-Markovian quantum master\nequation; we find that the system decoheres after a long time, despite the fact\nthat no energy is exchanged with the bath.\n", "  Radiative power balance of a planet in the solar system is delineated. The\nterrestrial powers are transformed to average global flux in an effective\natmospheric column (EAC) approximation, its components are delineated. The\nestimated and measured secular changes of the average global flux are compared\nto the fluxes derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law using the observed global\nannual temperatures in the decades between 1880 and 2010. The conclusion of\nthis procedure is that the radiative contribution of the greenhouse gas ${\\rm\nCO}_2$ is some $21\\pm 7$~\\% to the observed global warming from the end of the\nXIXth century excluding the feedback mechanisms playing determining role in the\nclimate system. Stationary radiative flux transfer is treated in an air column\nas a function of the column density of the absorbent. Upper and lower limit of\nradiative forcing is given by assuming true absorption and coherent scatter of\nthe monochromatic radiation. An integral formula is given for the outgoing long\nwave radiation (OLR) as a function of column density of the components of\ngreenhouse gases.\n", "  A study of differential cross sections for the production of four jets in\nmulti-Regge kinematics is presented, the main focus lying on azimuthal angle\ndependences. The theoretical setup consists in the jet production from a single\nBFKL ladder with a convolution of three BFKL Green functions, where two\nforward/backward jets are always tagged in the final state. Furthermore, the\ntagging of two further jets in more central regions of the detectors with a\nrelative separation in rapidity from each other is requested. It is found, as\nresult, that the dependence on the transverse momenta and the rapidities of the\ntwo central jets can be considered as a distinct signal of the onset of BFKL\ndynamics.\n", "  There is increasing evidence for specific cortical and subcortical\nlarge-scale human epileptic networks to be involved in the generation, spread,\nand termination of not only primary generalized but also focal onset seizures.\nThe complex dynamics of such networks has been studied with methods of analysis\nfrom graph theory. In addition to investigating network-specific\ncharacteristics, recent studies aim to determine the functional role of single\nnodes---such as the epileptic focus---in epileptic brain networks and their\nrelationship to ictogenesis. Utilizing the concept of betweenness centrality to\nassess the importance of network nodes, previous studies reported the epileptic\nfocus to be of highest importance prior to seizures, which would support the\nnotion of a network hub that facilitates seizure activity. We performed a\ntime-resolved analysis of various aspects of node importance in epileptic brain\nnetworks derived from long-term, multi-channel, intracranial\nelectroencephalographic recordings from an epilepsy patient. Our preliminary\nfindings indicate that the epileptic focus is not consistently the most\nimportant network node, but node importance may drastically vary over time.\n", "  Bursting neurons are considered to be a potential cause of over-excitability\nand seizure susceptibility. The functional influence of these neurons in\nextended epileptic networks is still poorly understood. There is mounting\nevidence that the dynamics of neuronal networks is influenced not only by\nneuronal and synaptic properties but also by network topology. We investigate\nnumerically the influence of different neuron dynamics on global synchrony in\nneuronal networks with complex connection topologies.\n", "  The concept of \"remote synchronization\" (RS) was introduced in [Phys. Rev. E\n85, 026208 (2012)], where synchronization in a star network of Stuart-Landau\noscillators was investigated. In the RS regime therein described, the central\nhub served as a transmitter of information between peripheral nodes, while\nmaintaining independent dynamics that were asynchronous with the rest of the\nnetwork. One of the key conclusions of that paper was that RS cannot occur in\npure phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that the RS regime can exist in\nnetworks of Kuramoto oscillators, and that hub nodes can actively drive remote\nsynchronization even in the presence of a repulsive mean field. We apply this\nmodel to study the synchronization dynamics in complex networks endowed with\nhub-nodes, an ubiquitous feature of many natural networks. We show that a\nchange in the natural frequency of a hub can alone reshape synchronization\npatterns, and switch from direct to remote synchronization, or to hub-driven\ndesynchronization. We discuss the potential role of this phenomenon in\nreal-world networks, including the Karate-club and brain connectivity networks.\n", "  We study the Kondo lattice model on the geometrically frustrated\nShastry-Sutherland lattice focusing on the quantum phase transition between the\nvalence bond solid and the heavy fermion liquid phase. By explicitly including\nspinon pairing of local moments at the mean-field level, we establish the\nemergence of a unique heavy fermion superconducting phase induced by dimer\nordering of the local moments coexisting with Kondo hybridization. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that for suitable choices of parameters, a partial\nKondo-screening phase, where some of the valence bonds are broken, precedes the\naforementioned dimer-induced superconducting phase. Our results have important\nimplications in understanding the experimental observations in the heavy\nfermion Shasstry-Sutherland compounds.\n", "  X-ray diffraction studies of the bond-orientational order in the hexatic-B\nphase of 75OBC and 3(10)OBC compounds are presented. The temperature evolution\nof an angular profile of a single diffraction peak is analyzed. Close to the\nhexatic-B-smectic-A transition these profiles can be approximated by the\nGaussian function. At lower temperatures in the hexatic-B phase the profiles\nare better fitted by the Voigt function. Theoretical analysis of the width of\ndiffraction peaks in three-dimentional (3D) hexatics is performed on the basis\nof the effective Hamiltonian introduced by Aharony and Kardar. Theoretical\nestimations are in good agreement with the results of x-ray experiments.\n", "  In lattice Quantum Field Theory, we are often presented with integrals over\npolynomials of coefficients of matrices in U(N) or SU(N) with respect to the\nHaar measure. In some physical situations, e.g., in presence of a chemical\npotential, these integrals are numerically very difficult since their\nintegrands are highly oscillatory which manifests itself in form of the sign\nproblem. In these cases, Monte Carlo methods often fail to be adequate,\nrendering such computations practically impossible. We propose a new class of\nintegration rules on U(N) and SU(N) which are derived from polynomially exact\nrules on spheres. We will examine these quadrature rules and their efficiency\nat the example of a 0+1 dimensional QCD for a non-zero quark mass and chemical\npotential. In particular, we will demonstrate the failure of Monte Carlo\nmethods in such applications and that we can obtain polynomially exact,\narbitrary precision results using the new integration rules.\n", "  We examined the sensitivity of microtubule spools to transport velocity.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we determined that the steady-state number and size of\nspools remained constant over a seven-fold range of velocities. Our data on the\nkinetics of spool assembly further suggest that the main mechanisms underlying\nspool growth vary during assembly.\n", "  Four principles are proposed to underlie the quantum theory of gravity. We\nshow that these suffice to recover the Einstein equations. We also suggest that\nMOND results from a modification of the classical equivalence principle, due to\nquantum gravity effects.\n", "  We set up the statistical mechanics for a nearly flat, thermally equilibrated\nfluid membrane, attached to an elastic network through one of its sides. We\npredict that the resulting structural (inversion) asymmetry of the membrane,\nnotably due to the elastic network attached to one of its sides, can generate a\nlocal spontaneous curvature $C_0$, that may in turn destabilize the otherwise\nflat membrane. As $C_0$ rises above a threshold at a fixed temperature, a flat\ntethered membrane in the thermodynamic limit becomes structurally unstable,\nsignaling {\\em crumpling} of the flat membrane. In-vitro experiments on red\nblood cell membranes after depletion of adenosine-tri-phosphate molecules and\nartificial deposition of spectrin filaments on lipid bilayers may be used to\nverify our results.\n", "  Tailoring of electromagnetic spontaneous emission predicted by E. M. Purcell\nmore than 50 years ago has undoubtedly proven to be one of the most important\neffects in the rich areas of quantum optics and nanophotonics. Although during\nthe past decades the research in this field has been focused on electric dipole\nemission, the recent progress in nanofabrication and study of magnetic quantum\nemitters, such as rare-earth ions, has stimulated the investigation of the\nmagnetic side of spontaneous emission. Here, we review the state-of-the-art\nadvances in the field of spontaneous emission enhancement of magnetic dipole\nquantum emitters with the use of various nanophotonics systems. We provide the\ngeneral theory describing the Purcell effect of magnetic emitters, overview\nrealizations of specific nanophotonics structures allowing for the enhanced\nmagnetic dipole spontaneous emission, and give an outlook on the challenges in\nthis field, which remain open to future research.\n", "  Rapid construction of phase diagrams is a central tenet of combinatorial\nmaterials science with accelerated materials discovery efforts often hampered\nby challenges in interpreting combinatorial x-ray diffraction datasets, which\nwe address by developing AgileFD, an artificial intelligence algorithm that\nenables rapid phase mapping from a combinatorial library of x-ray diffraction\npatterns. AgileFD models alloying-based peak shifting through a novel expansion\nof convolutional nonnegative matrix factorization, which not only improves the\nidentification of constituent phases but also maps their concentration and\nlattice parameter as a function of composition. By incorporating Gibbs phase\nrule into the algorithm, physically meaningful phase maps are obtained with\nunsupervised operation, and more refined solutions are attained by injecting\nexpert knowledge of the system. The algorithm is demonstrated through\ninvestigation of the V-Mn-Nb oxide system where decomposition of eight oxide\nphases, including two with substantial alloying, provides the first phase map\nfor this pseudo-ternary system. This phase map enables interpretation of\nhigh-throughput band gap data, leading to the discovery of new solar light\nabsorbers and the alloying-based tuning of the direct-allowed band-gap energy\nof MnV2O6. The open-source family of AgileFD algorithms can be implemented into\na broad range of high throughput workflows to accelerate materials discovery.\n", "  The recent explosion of research interest in Weyl semimetals has led to many\nproposed Weyl semimetal candidates and a few experimental observations of a\nWeyl semimetal in real materials. Through this experience, we have come to\nappreciate that typical Weyl semimetals host many Weyl points. For instance,\nthe first Weyl semimetal observed in experiment, TaAs, hosts 24 Weyl points.\nSimilarly, the Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ series, recently under study as the first\nType II Weyl semimetal, has eight Weyl points. However, it is well-understood\nthat for a Weyl semimetal without inversion symmetry but with time-reversal\nsymmetry, the minimum number of Weyl points is four. Realizing such a minimal\nWeyl semimetal is fundamentally relevant because it would offer the simplest\n\"hydrogen atom\" example of an inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. At the same\ntime, transport experiments and device applications may be simpler in a system\nwith as few Weyl points as possible. Recently, TaIrTe$_4$ has been predicted to\nbe a minimal, inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. However, crucially, the Weyl\npoints and Fermi arcs live entirely above the Fermi level, making them\ninaccessible to conventional angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).\nHere we use pump-probe ARPES to directly access the band structure above the\nFermi level in TaIrTe$_4$. We directly observe Weyl points and topological\nFermi arcs, showing that TaIrTe$_4$ is a Weyl semimetal. We find that, in\ntotal, TaIrTe$_4$ has four Weyl points, providing the first example of a\nminimal inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. Our results hold promise for\naccessing exotic transport phenomena arising in Weyl semimetals in a real\nmaterial.\n", "  $BF$ gravity comprises all the formulations of gravity that are based on\ndeformations of $BF$ theory. Such deformations consist of either constraints or\npotential terms added to the topological $BF$ action that turn some of the\ngauge degrees of freedom into physical ones, particularly giving rise to\ngeneral relativity. The $BF$ formulations have provided new and deep insights\ninto many classical and quantum aspects of the gravitational field, setting the\nfoundations for the approach to quantum gravity known as spinfoam models. In\nthis review, we present a self-contained and unified treatment of the $BF$\nformulations of $D$-dimensional general relativity and other related models,\nfocusing on the classical aspects of them and including some new results.\n"]}
