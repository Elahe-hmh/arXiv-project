The Grand Unification of the observed strong, electromagnetic and\nweak interactions implies relations between time variation of the finestructure\nconstant alpha and the QCD scale $\\Lambda_c$. The astrophysical observation of\na variation implies a time variation of $10^{-15} / year$. Several experiments\nin Quantum Optics, which were designed to look for a time variation of\n$\\Lambda_c$, are discussed.\n", "  In case of chiral U_A(1) symmetry restoration the mass of the eta' boson (the\nninth, would-be Goldstone boson) is decreased, thus its production cross\nsection is heavily enhanced. The eta' decays (through one of its decay\nchannels) into five pions. These pions will not be correlated in terms of\nBose-Einsten correlations, thus the production enhancement changes the strength\nof two-pion correlation functions at low momentum. Preliminary results strongly\nsupport the mass decrease of the eta' boson. In this paper we propose a method\nto select pions coming from eta' decays. We investigate the efficiency of the\nproposed kinematical cut in several collision systems and energies with several\nsimulators. We prove that our method can be used in all investigeted collision\nsystems.\n", "  The time evolution of the quark gluon plasma created in gold-gold collisions\nof the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be described by\nhydrodynamical models. Distribution of hadrons reflects the freeze-out state of\nthe matter. To investigate the time evolution one needs to analyze penetrating\nprobes, such as direct photon spectra. Distributions of low energy photons was\npublished in 2010 by PHENIX. In this paper we analyze a 3+1 dimensional\nsolution of relativistic hydrodynamics and calculate momentum distribution of\ndirect photons. Using earlier fits of this model to hadronic spectra, we\ncompare photon calculations to measurements and find that the initial\ntemperature of the center of the fireball is at least 519+-12 MeV, while for\nthe equation of state we get c_s= 0.36+-0.02.\n", "  Approximation algorithms for classical constraint satisfaction problems are\none of the main research areas in theoretical computer science. Here we define\na natural approximation version of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem\nand initiate its study. We present two main results. The first shows that a\nnon-trivial approximation ratio can be obtained in the class NP using product\nstates. The second result (which builds on the first one), gives a polynomial\ntime (classical) algorithm providing a similar approximation ratio for dense\ninstances of the problem. The latter result is based on an adaptation of the\n\"exhaustive sampling method\" by Arora et al. [J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 58, p.193\n(1999)] to the quantum setting, and might be of independent interest.\n", "  We show that the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory of gravity with torsion\nnot only extends general relativity to account for the intrinsic spin of\nmatter, but it may also eliminate major problems in gravitational physics and\nanswer major questions in cosmology. These problems and questions include: the\norigin of the Universe, the existence of singularities in black holes, the\nnature of inflation and dark energy, the origin of the matter-antimatter\nasymmetry in the Universe, and the nature of dark matter.\n", "  In this work, the nutation momentum acting upon the Earth from the Moon's\nperigee mass that has not been taken into account in the Earth's\nprecession-nutation theory was revealed. This missing momentum exhibits itself\nin the so-called \"local latitude variation\" with the Chandler's period. The\nresults of our work raise the question of updating the Earth's\nprecession-nutation theory and revising some postulates of the time service,\nastronomy, geophysics, satellite navigation, etc.\n", "  In this thesis is studied three of the fundamental properties of clusters of\nmatter made of quarks u, d and s called strangelets: the energy per baryon, the\nradius and the electric charge, all in the presence of intense magnetic fields\nand finite temperature. Two cases will take our attention: unpaired phase\nstrangelets, where there is no restriction to the number of flavors of quarks,\nand a particular case of the color superconducting phase, where exists a\nrestriction to the quark numbers and an additional energy gap. We study the\nstability of strangelets, measured by the energy per baryon, to compare later\nwith that of the 56Fe : the most stable isotope known in nature. We employ the\nLiquid Drop formalism of the Bag Model MIT to describe the interaction between\nquarks. We conclude that the field effects tend to decrease the energy per\nbaryon of strangelets and temperature produces the opposite effect. It is also\nshown that strangelets in the color superconducting phase are more stable than\nthose in the unpaired phase for an energy gap of about 100MeV. The radius of\nstrangelets shows an analogous behavior with the baryon number, as that of the\nnuclei, and shows small variations with the magnetic field and temperature. It\nis obtained that the presence of magnetic fields modify the values of the\nelectric charge regarding the non-magnetized case, being these higher (lower)\nfor strangelets in the unpaired phase (superconducting).\n", "  Thermonuclear runaway burning of carbon is in rare cases observed from\naccreting neutron stars as day-long X-ray flares called superbursts. In the few\ncases where the onset is observed, superbursts exhibit a short precursor burst\nat the start. In each instance, however, the data was of insufficient quality\nfor spectral analysis of the precursor. Using data from the propane\nanti-coincidence detector of the PCA instrument on RXTE, we perform the first\ndetailed time resolved spectroscopy of precursors. For a superburst from 4U\n1820-30 we demonstrate the presence of photospheric radius expansion. We find\nthe precursor to be 1.4-2 times more energetic than other short bursts from\nthis source, indicating that the burning of accreted helium is insufficient to\nexplain the full precursor. Shock heating would be able to account for the\nlacking energy. We argue that this precursor is a strong indication that the\nsuperburst starts as a detonation, and that a shock induces the precursor.\nFurthermore, we employ our technique to study the superexpansion phase of the\nsame superburst in greater detail.\n", "  The polynomial hierarchy plays a central role in classical complexity theory.\nHere, we define a quantum generalization of the polynomial hierarchy, and\ninitiate its study. We show that not only are there natural complete problems\nfor the second level of this quantum hierarchy, but that these problems are in\nfact hard to approximate. Using these techniques, we also obtain hardness of\napproximation for the class QCMA. Our approach is based on the use of\ndispersers, and is inspired by the classical results of Umans regarding\nhardness of approximation for the second level of the classical polynomial\nhierarchy [Umans, FOCS 1999]. The problems for which we prove hardness of\napproximation for include, among others, a quantum version of the Succinct Set\nCover problem, and a variant of the local Hamiltonian problem with hybrid\nclassical-quantum ground states.\n", "  We consider the relativistic scattering of unequal-mass scalar particles\nthrough graviton exchange in the small-angle high-energy regime and calculate\nthe scattering amplitude up to the next-to-leading eikonal correction,\nincluding gravitational effects of the same order. We find that only one set of\nthese power corrections (the seagull and graviton loop contributions) are\nconsistent with the exponentiation of a corrected phase in impact parameter\nspace, once all possible graviton exchanges are summed. The other set (arising\nfrom propagator expansions) starts at the second loop order. Both of these\nleading power corrections are suppressed by a single power of the ratio of\nmomentum transfer to the energy of the light particle in the rest frame of the\nheavy particle, independent of the heavy particle mass. For large enough\nheavy-particle mass, the saddle point for the impact parameter is modified\ncompared to the leading order by a multiple of the Schwarzschild radius\ndetermined by the mass of the heavy particle, independent of the energy of the\nlight particle.\n", "  We analyse equilibrium phases in a multi-type lattice Widom-Rowlinson model\nwith (i) four particle types, (ii) varying exclusion diameters between\ndifferent particle types and (iii) large values of fugacity. Contrary to an\nexpectation, it is not the most \"aggressive\" species, with largest diameters,\nwhich dominates the equilibrium measure, but the \"most tolerant\" one, which has\nsmallest exclusion diameters. Results of numerical simulations are presented,\nshowing densities of species in equilibrium phases and confirming the\ntheoretical picture.\n", "  In this paper we compare the integrable hard hexagon model with the\nnon-integrable hard squares model by means of partition function roots and\ntransfer matrix eigenvalues. We consider partition functions for toroidal,\ncylindrical, and free-free boundary conditions up to sizes $40\\times40$ and\ntransfer matrices up to 30 sites. For all boundary conditions the hard squares\nroots are seen to lie in a bounded area of the complex fugacity plane along\nwith the universal hard core line segment on the negative real fugacity axis.\nThe density of roots on this line segment matches the derivative of the phase\ndifference between the eigenvalues of largest (and equal) moduli and exhibits\nmuch greater structure than the corresponding density of hard hexagons. We also\nstudy the special point $z=-1$ of hard squares where all eigenvalues have unit\nmodulus, and we give several conjectures for the value at $z=-1$ of the\npartition functions.\n", "  We prove that the empirical density of states of quantum spin glasses on\narbitrary graphs converges to a normal distribution as long as the maximal\ndegree is negligible compared with the total number of edges. This extends the\nrecent results of [6] that were proved for graphs with bounded chromatic number\nand with symmetric coupling distribution. Furthermore, we generalise the result\nto arbitrary hypergraphs. We test the optimality of our condition on the\nmaximal degree for $p$-uniform hypergraphs that correspond to $p$-spin glass\nHamiltonians acting on $n$ distinguishable spin-$1/2$ particles. At the\ncritical threshold $p=n^{1/2}$ we find a sharp classical-quantum phase\ntransition between the normal distribution and the Wigner semicircle law. The\nformer is characteristic to classical systems with commuting variables, while\nthe latter is a signature of noncommutative random matrix theory.\n", "  The inorganic CsI(Tl) crystal scintillator is a candidate served as an\nanti-compton detector for China Dark matter EXperiment (CDEX). Studying the\nintrinsic radiopurity of CsI(Tl) crystal is an issue of major importance. The\ntiming, energy and spatial correlations, as well as the capability of pulse\nshape discrimination provide powerful methods for the measurement of intrinsic\nradiopurities. The experimental design, detector performance and\nevent-selection algorithms are described. A total of 359*3 kg-days data from\nthree prototypes of CsI(Tl) crystals were taken at China Jinping underground\nlaboratory where offers a good shielding environment. The contamination levels\nof internal isotopes from Cs-137, Th-232 and U-238 series, as well as the upper\nbounds of U-235 series are reported. Identification of the whole alpha8 peaks\nfrom U/Th decay chains and derivation of those corresponding quenching factors\nare achieved.\n", "  We study the effect of noise on the dynamics of passively mode-locked\nsemiconductor lasers both experimentally and theoretically. A method combining\nanalytical and numerical approaches for estimation of pulse timing jitter is\nproposed. We investigate how the presence of dynamical features such as\nwavelength bistability affects timing jitter.\n", "  The construction of a continuum limit for the dynamics of loop quantum\ngravity is unavoidable to complete the theory. We explain that such a\nconstruction is equivalent to obtaining the continuum physical Hilbert space,\nwhich encodes the solutions of the theory. We present iterative coarse graining\nmethods to construct physical states in a truncation scheme and explain in\nwhich sense this scheme represents a renormalization flow. We comment on the\nrole of diffeomorphism symmetry as an indicator for the continuum limit.\n", "  Prior distributions of binarized natural images are learned by using a\nBoltzmann machine. According the results of this study, there emerges a\nstructure with two sublattices in the interactions, and the nearest-neighbor\nand next-nearest-neighbor interactions correspondingly take two discriminative\nvalues, which reflects the individual characteristics of the three sets of\npictures that we process. Meanwhile, in a longer spatial scale, a longer-range,\nalthough still rapidly decaying, ferromagnetic interaction commonly appears in\nall cases. The characteristic length scale of the interactions is universally\nup to approximately four lattice spacings $\\xi \\approx 4$. These results are\nderived by using the mean-field method, which effectively reduces the\ncomputational time required in a Boltzmann machine. An improved mean-field\nmethod called the Bethe approximation also gives the same results, as well as\nthe Monte Carlo method does for small size images. These reinforce the validity\nof our analysis and findings. Relations to criticality, frustration, and\nsimple-cell receptive fields are also discussed.\n", "  We present a multiscale quantum-defect theory based on the first analytic\nsolution for a two-scale long range potential consisting of a Coulomb potential\nand a polarization potential. In its application to atomic structure, the\ntheory extends the systematic understanding of atomic Rydberg states, as\nafforded by the standard single-scale quantum-defect theory, to a much greater\nrange of energies to include the first few excited states and even the ground\nstate. Such a level of understanding has important implications not only on\natomic structure, but also on the electronic structure of molecules and on\natomic and molecular interactions and reactions. We demonstrate the theory by\nshowing that it provides an analytic description of the energy variations of\nthe standard Coulomb quantum defects for alkali-metal atoms.\n", "  The electronic bands are classified according to their topology. We compute\nthe connection and curvature for the electronic bands and show that the\nphysical properties are determined by topological invariants which are\nequivalent to the existence of the zero modes. We apply this method to the\nTopological Insulators and Topogical Superconductors.\n", "  We present a study on the effect of undetected stellar companions on the\nderived planetary radii for the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). The current\nproduction of the KOI list assumes that the each KOI is a single star. Not\naccounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets towards\nsmaller radii. The bias towards smaller radii depends on the properties of the\ncompanion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion\nstars. Defining a planetary radius correction factor $X_R$, we find that if the\nKOIs are assumed to be single, then, {\\it on average}, the planetary radii may\nbe underestimated by a factor of $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx 1.5$. If typical\nradial velocity and high resolution imaging observations are performed and no\ncompanions are detected, this factor reduces to $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx\n1.2$. The correction factor $\\langle X_R \\rangle$ is dependent upon the primary\nstar properties and ranges from $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx 1.6$ for A and F\nstars to $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx 1.2$ for K and M stars. For missions like\nK2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler target\nsample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the radius correction\nfactor to $\\langle X_R \\rangle \\approx 1.1$. Finally, we show that if the\nstellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, occurrence rate\ncalculations for Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small\nplanets by as much as $15-20$\\%.\n", "  We present a first-principles theoretical analysis of the entanglement of two\nsuperconducting qubits in spatially separated microwave cavities by a\nsequential (cascaded) probe of the two cavities with a coherent mode, that\nprovides a full characterization of both the continuous measurement induced\ndynamics and the entanglement generation. We use the SLH formalism to derive\nthe full quantum master equation for the coupled qubits and cavities system,\nwithin the rotating wave and dispersive approximations, and conditioned\nequations for the cavity fields. We then develop effective stochastic master\nequations for the dynamics of the qubit system in both a polaronic reference\nframe and a reduced representation within the laboratory frame. We compare\nsimulations with and analyze tradeoffs between these two representations,\nincluding the onset of a non-Markovian regime for simulations in the reduced\nrepresentation. We provide conditions for ensuring persistence of entanglement\nand show that using shaped pulses enables these conditions to be met at all\ntimes under general experimental conditions. The resulting entanglement is\nshown to be robust with respect to measurement imperfections and loss channels.\nWe also study the effects of qubit driving and relaxation dynamics during a\nweak measurement, as a prelude to modeling measurement-based feedback control\nin this cascaded system.\n", "  The geometric framework for the Hamilton-Jacobi theory developed in previous\nworks is extended for multisymplectic first-order classical field theories. The\nHamilton-Jacobi problem is stated for the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian\nformalisms of these theories as a particular case of a more general problem,\nand the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for field theories is recovered from\nthis geometrical setting. Particular and complete solutions to these problems\nare defined and characterized in several equivalent ways in both formalisms,\nand the equivalence between them is proved. The use of distributions in jet\nbundles that represent the solutions to the field equations is the fundamental\ntool in this formulation. Some examples are analyzed and, in particular, the\nHamilton-Jacobi equation for non-autonomous mechanical systems is obtained as a\nspecial case of our results.\n", "  We study first and second order conformal symmetries of the Yamabe Laplacian\non a general pseudo-Riemannian manifold and of the Paneitz operator on Einstein\nspaces. We show that first order conformal symmetries of the Yamabe operator\ninduce second order conformal symmetries. We show that on an Einstein space\nevery conformal Killing vector field induces a conformal symmetry of the\nPaneitz operator and, conversely, every first order conformal symmetry of the\nPaneitz operator arises from a conformal Killing vector field. Possible\nextensions of our main theorems are illustrated by examples. We correct\nformulas in a paper of B. Carter and a paper of Kamran and McLenaghan.\n", "  We study various self-avoiding walks (SAWs) which are constrained to lie in\nthe upper half-plane and are subjected to a compressive force. This force is\napplied to the vertex or vertices of the walk located at the maximum distance\nabove the boundary of the half-space. In the case of bridges, this is the\nunique end-point. In the case of SAWs or self-avoiding polygons, this\ncorresponds to all vertices of maximal height. We first use the conjectured\nrelation with the Schramm-Loewner evolution to predict the form of the\npartition function including the values of the exponents, and then we use\nseries analysis to test these predictions.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of precision frequency metrology with large\nion crystals. For clock candidates with a negative differential static\npolarisability, we show that micromotion effects should not impede the\nperformance of the clock. Using Lu+ as a specific example, we show that\nquadrupole shifts due to the electric fields from neighbouring ions do not\nsignificantly affect clock performance. We also show that effects from the\ntensor polarisability can be effectively managed with a compensation laser at\nleast for a small number of ions (<1000). These results provide new\npossibilities for ion-based atomic clocks, allowing them to achieve stability\nlevels comparable to neutral atoms in optical lattices and a viable path to\ngreater levels of accuracy.\n", "  We investigate the one-dimensional $p$-wave superconducting model with\nperiodically modulated hopping and show that under time-reversal symmetry, the\nnumber of the Majorana zero modes (MZMs) strongly depends on the modulation\nperiod. If the modulation period is odd, there can be at most one MZM. However\nif the period is even, the number of the MZMs can be zero, one and two. In\naddition, the MZMs will disappear as the chemical potential varies. We derive\nthe condition for the existence of the MZMs and show that the topological\nproperties in this model are dramatically different from the one with\nperiodically modulated potential.\n", "  We investigate one dimensional tight binding model in the presence of a\ncorrelated binary disorder. The disorder is due to the interaction of particles\nwith heavy immobile other species. Off-diagonal disorder is created by means of\na fast periodic modulation of interspecies interaction. The method based on\ntransfer matrix techniques allows us to calculate the energies of extended\nmodes in the correlated binary disorder. We focus on $N$-mer correlations and\nregain known results for the case of purely diagonal disorder. For off-diagonal\ndisorder we find resonant energies. We discuss ambiguous properties of those\nstates and compare analytical results with numerical calculations. Separately\nwe describe a special case of the dual random dimer model.\n", "  We investigate the performance of quantum teleportation under a lossy\nenvironment using two different types of optical hybrid qubits. One is the\nhybrid of the vacuum and single-photon states with coherent states and the\nother is the hybrid of polarized single-photon states with coherent states. We\nhave shown that the hybrid qubit using vacuum and single-photon states is\ngenerally more robust to photon loss effects compared to the one using the\nphoton polarization with respect to fidelities and success probabilities of\nquantum teleportation.\n", "  We present a new cosmological galaxy formation model, $\\nu^2$GC, as an\nupdated version of our previous model $\\nu$GC. We adopt the so-called\n\"semi-analytic\" approach, in which the formation history of dark matter halos\nis computed by ${\\it N}$-body simulations, while the baryon physics such as gas\ncooling, star formation and supernova feedback are simply modeled by\nphenomenological equations. Major updates of the model are as follows: (1) the\nmerger trees of dark matter halos are constructed in state-of-the-art ${\\it\nN}$-body simulations, (2) we introduce the formation and evolution process of\nsupermassive black holes and the suppression of gas cooling due to active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) activity, (3) we include heating of the intergalactic\ngas by the cosmic UV background, and (4) we tune some free parameters related\nto the astrophysical processes using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Our\n${\\it N}$-body simulations of dark matter halos have unprecedented box size and\nmass resolution (the largest simulation contains 550 billion particles in a\n1.12 Gpc/h box), enabling the study of much smaller and rarer objects. The\nmodel was tuned to fit the luminosity functions of local galaxies and mass\nfunction of neutral hydrogen. Local observations, such as the Tully-Fisher\nrelation, size-magnitude relation of spiral galaxies and scaling relation\nbetween the bulge mass and black hole mass were well reproduced by the model.\nMoreover, the model also well reproduced the cosmic star formation history and\nthe redshift evolution of rest-frame ${\\it K}$-band luminosity functions. The\nnumerical catalog of the simulated galaxies and AGNs is publicly available on\nthe web.\n", "  The Boolean constraint satisfaction problem 3-SAT is arguably the canonical\nNP-complete problem. In contrast, 2-SAT can not only be decided in polynomial\ntime, but in fact in deterministic linear time. In 2006, Bravyi proposed a\nphysically motivated generalization of k-SAT to the quantum setting, defining\nthe problem \"quantum k-SAT\". He showed that quantum 2-SAT is also solvable in\npolynomial time on a classical computer, in particular in deterministic time\nO(n^4), assuming unit-cost arithmetic over a field extension of the rational\nnumbers, where n is number of variables. In this paper, we present an algorithm\nfor quantum 2-SAT which runs in linear time, i.e. deterministic time O(n+m) for\nn and m the number of variables and clauses, respectively. Our approach\nexploits the transfer matrix techniques of Laumann et al. [QIC, 2010] used in\nthe study of phase transitions for random quantum 2-SAT, and bears similarities\nwith both the linear time 2-SAT algorithms of Even, Itai, and Shamir (based on\nbacktracking) [SICOMP, 1976] and Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan (based on strongly\nconnected components) [IPL, 1979].\n", "  The Pancharatnam phase deficit is defined as the difference between the\nPancharat- nam phase acquired by the global system and the sum of the\nPancharatnam phases acquired by subsystems during local unitary evolutions. We\nshow that a non-zero value of the Pancharatnam phase deficit for a composite\nquantum system can be a signature of quantum entanglement. In the context of\nmacroscopic quantum systems, we illustrate how the Pancharatnam phase deficit\ncan be used to detect macroscopically entangled states. In particular, we use\nthe Pancharatnam phase deficit to detect the entanglement for macroscopic\nsuperposition of coherent states. Furthermore, we show that by measuring the\nPancharatnam phase deficit one can measure the concurrence of two spin singlets\nbetween distant boundaries.\n", "  The structure and dynamic of social network are largely determined by the\nheterogeneous interaction activity and social capital allocation of\nindividuals. These features interplay in a non-trivial way in the formation of\nnetwork and challenge a rigorous dynamical system theory of network evolution.\nHere we study seven real networks describing temporal human interactions in\nthree different settings: scientific collaborations, Twitter mentions, and\nmobile phone calls. We find that the node's activity and social capital\nallocation can be described by two general functional forms that can be used to\ndefine a simple stochastic model for social network dynamic. This model allows\nthe explicit asymptotic solution of the Master Equation describing the system\ndynamic, and provides the scaling laws characterizing the time evolution of the\nsocial network degree distribution and individual node's ego network. The\nanalytical predictions reproduce with accuracy the empirical observations\nvalidating the theoretical approach. Our results provide a rigorous dynamical\nsystem framework that can be extended to include other features of networks'\nformation and to generate data driven predictions for the asymptotic behavior\nof large-scale social networks.\n", "  We study the effect of restart, and retry, on the mean completion time of a\ngeneric process. The need to do so arises in various branches of the sciences\nand we show that it can naturally be addressed by taking advantage of the\nclassical reaction scheme of Michaelis and Menten. Stopping a process in its\nmidst, only to start it all over again, may prolong, leave unchanged, or even\nshorten the time taken for its completion. Here we are interested in the\noptimal restart problem, i.e., in finding a restart rate which brings the mean\ncompletion time of a process to a minimum. We derive the governing equation for\nthis problem and show that it is exactly solvable in cases of particular\ninterest. We then continue to discover regimes at which solutions to the\nproblem take on universal, details independent, forms which further give rise\nto optimal scaling laws. The formalism we develop, and the results obtained,\ncan be utilized when optimizing stochastic search processes and randomized\ncomputer algorithms. An immediate connection with kinetic proofreading is also\nnoted and discussed.\n", "  The conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium of baryons (non-strange,\nstrange) and mesons (strange) are presented for central Au + Au collisions at\nFAIR energies using the microscopic transport model UrQMD. The net particle\ndensity, longitudinal-to-transverse pressure anisotropy and inverse slope\nparameters of the energy spectra of non-strange and strange hadrons are\ncalculated inside a cell in the central region within rapidity window $|y| <\n1.0$ at different time steps after the collision. We observed that the\nstrangeness content is dominated by baryons at all energies, however\ncontribution from mesons become significant at higher energies. The time scale\nobtained from local pressure (momentum) isotropization and thermalization of\nenergy spectra are nearly equal and found to decrease with increase in\nlaboratory energy. The equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the system are\nobtained with statistical thermal model. The time evolution of the entropy\ndensities at FAIR energies are found very similar with the ideal hydrodynamic\nbehaviour at top RHIC energy.\n", "  The static and dynamic properties of ring polymers in concentrated solutions\nremains one of the last deep unsolved questions in Polymer Physics. At the same\ntime, the nature of the glass transition in polymeric systems is also not well\nunderstood. In this work we study a novel glass transition in systems made of\ncircular polymers by exploiting the topological constraints that are\nconjectured to populate concentrated solutions of rings. We show that such\nrings strongly inter-penetrate through one another, generating an extensive\nnetwork of topological interactions that dramatically affects their dynamics.\nWe show that a kinetically arrested state can be induced by randomly pinning a\nsmall fraction of the rings. This occurs well above the classical glass\ntransition temperature at which microscopic mobility is lost. Our work\ndemonstrates both the existence of long-lived inter-ring penetrations and also\nrealises a novel, topologically-induced, glass transition.\n", "  We numerically analyse the behavior of the full distribution of collective\nobservables in quantum spin chains. While most of previous studies of quantum\ncritical phenomena are limited to the first moments, here we demonstrate how\nquantum fluctuations at criticality lead to highly non-Gaussian distributions\nthus violating the central limit theorem. Interestingly, we show that the\ndistributions for different system sizes collapse after scaling on the same\ncurve for a wide range of transitions: first and second order quantum\ntransitions and transitions of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. We\npropose and carefully analyse the feasibility of an experimental reconstruction\nof the distribution using light-matter interfaces for atoms in optical lattices\nor in optical resonators.\n", "  This article reviews the theoretical and experimental work related to the\nelectronic properties of bilayer graphene systems. Three types of bilayer\nstackings are discussed: the AA, AB, and twisted bilayer graphene. This review\ncovers single-electron properties, effects of static electric and magnetic\nfields, bilayer-based mesoscopic systems, spin-orbit coupling, dc transport and\noptical response, as well as spontaneous symmetry violation and other\ninteraction effects. The selection of the material aims to introduce the reader\nto the most commonly studied topics of theoretical and experimental research in\nbilayer graphene.\n", "  The ratio of the mean square amplitude root of thermal vibrations and the\ninteratomic distance is a universal constant dls at the melting temperature Tm.\nThe classical Gibbs free energy change completed by a volume energy saving els\n(or Delg)*DHm that governs the liquid to solid and liquid to ultra-stable glass\ntransformations leads to a universal constant equal to els (or Delg), DHm being\nthe crystal melting enthalpy. The minimum values 0.217 of els and 0.103 of dls\nare used to predict ultra-stable glass formation in pure metallic liquid\nelements at a universal reduced temperature 0g = (Tg-Tm)/Tm = -0.6223.\n", "  Contact geometry has been applied to various mathematical sciences, and it\nhas been proposed that a contact manifold and a strictly convex function induce\na dually flat space that is used in information geometry. Here, such a dually\nflat space is related to a Legendre submanifold in a contact manifold. In this\npaper contact geometric descriptions of vector fields on dually flat spaces are\nproposed on the basis of the theory of contact Hamiltonian vector fields. Based\non these descriptions, two ways of lifting vector fields on Legendre\nsubmanifolds to contact manifolds are given. For some classes of these lifted\nvector fields, invariant measures in contact manifolds and stability analysis\naround Legendre submanifolds are explicitly given. Throughout this paper,\nLegendre duality is explicitly stated. In addition, to show how to apply these\ngeneral methodologies to applied mathematical disciplines, electric circuit\nmodels and some examples taken from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics are\nanalyzed.\n", "  Stochastic restart may drastically reduce the expected run time of a computer\nalgorithm, expedite the completion of a complex search process, or increase the\nturnover rate of an enzymatic reaction. These diverse first-passage-time (FPT)\nprocesses seem to have very little in common but it is actually quite the other\nway around. Here we show that the relative standard deviation associated with\nthe FPT of an optimally restarted process, i.e., one that is restarted at a\n(non-zero) rate which brings the mean FPT to a minimum, is always unity. We\ninterpret, further generalize, and discuss this finding and the implications\narising from it.\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators are a class of materials with a bulk\nenergy gap and edge or surface modes, which are protected by crystalline\nsymmetry, at their boundaries. They have been realized in electronic systems:\nin particular, in SnTe. In this work, we propose a mechanism to realize\nphotonic boundary states topologically protected by crystalline symmetry. We\nmap this one-dimensional system to a two-dimensional lattice model with\nopposite magnetic fields, as well as opposite Chern numbers in its even and odd\nmirror parity subspaces, thus corresponding to a topological mirror insulator.\nFurthermore, we test how sensitive and robust edge modes depend on their mirror\nparity by performing time dependent evolution simulation of edge modes in a\nphotonic setting with realistic experimental parameters.\n", "  We combine spin polarised density functional theory and thermodynamic mean\nfield theory to describe the phase transitions of antiperovskite manganese\nnitrides. We find that the inclusion of the localized spin contribution to the\nentropy, evaluated through mean field theory, lowers the transition\ntemperatures. Furthermore, we show that the electronic entropy leads to first\norder phase transitions in agreement with experiments whereas the localized\nspin contribution adds second order character to the transition. We compare our\npredictions to available experimental data to assess the validity of the\nassumptions underpinning our multilevel modelling.\n", "  In this article, we construct the\naxialvector-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type and the\naxialvector-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type interpolating currents,\nand study the $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^\\pm$ hidden-charm pentaquark states with the\nstrangeness $S=0,\\,-1,\\,-2,\\,-3$ systematically using the QCD sum rules. The\npredicted masses of the pentaquark states\n$P_{uud}^{10\\frac{1}{2}}\\left({\\frac{3}{2}^-}\\right)$,\n$P_{uud}^{11\\frac{1}{2}}\\left({\\frac{3}{2}^-}\\right)$ and\n$P_{uud}^{11\\frac{3}{2}}\\left({\\frac{3}{2}^-}\\right)$ are compatible with the\nexperimental value $M_{P_c(4380)}=4380\\pm 8\\pm 29\\,\\rm{MeV}$ from the LHCb\ncollaboration, more experimental data are still needed to identify the\n$P_c(4380)$ unambiguously.\n", "  We study the fate of the surface states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under disorder with\nstrength larger than the bulk gap, caused by neon sputtering and nonmagnetic\nadsorbates. We find that neon sputtering introduces strong but dilute defects,\nwhich can be modeled by a unitary impurity distribution, whereas adsorbates,\nsuch as water vapor or carbon monoxide, are best described by Gaussian\ndisorder. Remarkably, these two disorder types have a dramatically different\neffect on the surface states. Our soft x-ray ARPES measurements combined with\nnumerical simulations show that unitary surface disorder pushes the Dirac state\nto inward quintuplet layers, burying it below an insulating surface layer. As a\nconsequence, the surface spectral function becomes weaker, but retains its\nquasiparticle peak. This is in contrast to Gaussian disorder, which smears out\nthe quasiparticle peak completely. At the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, the effects\nof Gaussian disorder can be reduced by removing surface adsorbates using neon\nsputtering, which, however, introduces unitary scatterers. Since unitary\ndisorder has a weaker effect than Gaussian disorder, the ARPES signal of the\nDirac surface state becomes sharper upon sputtering.\n", "  A fundamental and intrinsic property of any device or natural system is its\nrelaxation time relax, which is the time it takes to return to equilibrium\nafter the sudden change of a control parameter [1]. Reducing $tau$ relax , is\nfrequently necessary, and is often obtained by a complex feedback process. To\novercome the limitations of such an approach, alternative methods based on\ndriving have been recently demonstrated [2, 3], for isolated quantum and\nclassical systems [4--9]. Their extension to open systems in contact with a\nthermostat is a stumbling block for applications. Here, we design a\nprotocol,named Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE), that shortcuts\ntime-consuming relaxations, and we apply it to a Brownian particle trapped in\nan optical potential whose properties can be controlled in time. We implement\nthe process experimentally, showing that it allows the system to reach\nequilibrium times faster than the natural equilibration rate. We also estimate\nthe increase of the dissipated energy needed to get such a time reduction. The\nmethod paves the way for applications in micro and nano devices, where the\nreduction of operation time represents as substantial a challenge as\nminiaturization [10]. The concepts of equilibrium and of transformations from\nan equilibrium state to another, are cornerstones of thermodynamics. A textbook\nillustration is provided by the expansion of a gas, starting at equilibrium and\nexpanding to reach a new equilibrium in a larger vessel. This operation can be\nperformed either very slowly by a piston, without dissipating energy into the\nenvironment, or alternatively quickly, letting the piston freely move to reach\nthe new volume.\n", "  Uncovering the origin of unconventional superconductivity is often plagued by\nthe overwhelming material diversity with varying normal and superconducting\n(SC) properties. In this article, we deliver a comprehensive study of the SC\nproperties and phase diagrams using multiple tunings (such as disorder,\npressure or magnetic field in addition to doping and vice versa) across several\nfamilies of unconventional superconductors, including the copper-oxides,\nheavy-fermions, organics and the recently discovered iron-pnictides,\niron-chalcogenides, and oxybismuthides. We discover that all these families\noften possess two types of SC domes, with lower and higher superconducting\ntransition temperatures Tc, both unconventional but with distinct SC and normal\nstates properties. The lower Tc dome arises with or without a quantum critical\npoint (QCP), and not always associated with a non-Fermi liquid (NFL)\nbackground. On the contrary, the higher-Tc dome clearly stems from a NFL or\nstrange metal phase, without an apparent intervening phase transition or a QCP.\nThe two domes appear either fully separated in the phase diagram, or merged\ninto one, or arise independently owing to their respective normal state\ncharacteristics. Our findings suggest that a QCP-related mechanism is an\nunlikely scenario for the NFL phase in these materials, and thereby narrows the\npossibility towards short-range fluctuations of various degrees of freedom in\nthe momentum and frequency space. We also find that NFL physics may be a\ngeneric route to higher-Tc superconductivity.\n", "  We construct spacetimes which provide spherical and nonspherical models of\nblack hole formation in the flat Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW)\nuniverse with the Lemaitre--Tolman--Bondi solution and the Szekeres\nquasispherical solution, respectively. These dust solutions may contain both\nshell-crossing and shell-focusing naked singularities. These singularities can\nbe physically regarded as the breakdown of dust description, where strong\npressure gradient force plays a role. We adopt the simultaneous big bang\ncondition to extract a growing mode of adiabatic perturbation in the flat FLRW\nuniverse. If the density perturbation has a sufficiently homogeneous central\nregion and a sufficiently sharp transition to the background FLRW universe, its\ncentral shell-focusing singularity is globally covered. If the density\nconcentration is sufficiently large, no shell-crossing singularity appears and\na black hole is formed. If the density concentration is not sufficiently large,\na shell-crossing singularity appears. In this case, a large dipole moment\nsignificantly advances shell-crossing singularities and they tend to appear\nbefore the black hole formation. In contrast, a shell-crossing singularity\nunavoidably appears in the spherical and nonspherical evolution of cosmological\nvoids. The present analysis is general and applicable to cosmological nonlinear\nstructure formation described by these dust solutions.\n", "  To explain the accelerated expansion of our universe, many dark energy models\nand modified gravity theories have been proposed so far. It is argued in the\nliterature that they are difficult to be distinguished on the cosmological\nscales. Therefore, it is well motivated to consider the relevant astrophysical\nphenomena on (or below) the galactic scales. In this work, we study the\nstability of self-gravitating differentially rotating galactic disks in $f(T)$\ntheory, and obtain the local stability criteria in $f(T)$ theory, which are\nvalid for all $f(T)$ theories satisfying $f(T=0)=0$ and $f_T (T=0)\\not=0$, if\nthe adiabatic approximation and the weak field limit are considered. The\ninformation of the function $f(T)$ is mainly encoded in the parameter\n$\\alpha\\equiv 1/f_T(T=0)$. We find that the local stability criteria in $f(T)$\ntheory are quite different from the ones in Newtonian gravity, general\nrelativity, and other modified gravity theories such as $f(R)$ theory. We\nconsider that this might be a possible hint to distinguish $f(T)$ theory from\ngeneral relativity and other modified gravity theories on (or below) the\ngalactic scales.\n", "  A 994g mass p-type PCGe detector was deployed by the first phase of the China\nDark matter EXperiment aiming at the direct searches of light weakly\ninteracting massive particles. Measuring the thickness of the dead layer of a\np-type germanium detector is an issue of major importance since it determines\nthe fiducial mass of the detector. This work reports a method using an\nuncollimated 133Ba source to determine the dead layer thickness. The\nexperimental design, data analysis and Monte Carlo simulation processes, as\nwell as the statistical and systematic errors are described. An agreement\nbetween the experimental data and simulation results was achieved to derive the\nthickness of the dead layer of 1.02 mm.\n", "  The CDEX-1 experiment conducted a search of low-mass (< 10 GeV/c2) Weakly\nInteracting Massive Particles (WIMPs) dark matter at the China Jinping\nUnderground Laboratory using a p-type point-contact germanium detector with a\nfiducial mass of 915 g at a physics analysis threshold of 475 eVee. We report\nthe hardware set-up, detector characterization, data acquisition and analysis\nprocedures of this experiment. No excess of unidentified events are observed\nafter subtraction of known background. Using 335.6 kg-days of data, exclusion\nconstraints on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent and spin-dependent couplings\nare derived.\n", "  An understanding of the pinning of magnetic skyrmions to defects is crucial\nfor the development of future spintronic applications. While pinning is\ndesirable for a precise positioning of magnetic skyrmions it is detrimental\nwhen they are to be moved through a material. We use scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy to study the interaction between atomic scale defects and magnetic\nskyrmions that are only a few nanometers in diameter. The studied pinning\ncenters range from single atom inlayer defects and adatoms to clusters adsorbed\non the surface of our model system. We find very different pinning strengths\nand identify preferred positions of the skyrmion. The interaction between a\ncluster and a skyrmion can be sufficiently strong for the skyrmion to follow\nwhen the cluster is moved across the surface by lateral manipulation with the\nSTM tip.\n", "  Using black brane solutions in 5d Lifshitz-like backgrounds with arbitrary\ndynamical exponent $\\nu$, we construct the Vaidya geometry, asymptoting to the\nLifshitz-like spacetime, which represents a thin shell infalling at the speed\nof light. We apply the new Lifshitz-Vaidya background to study the\nthermalization process of the quark-gluon plasma via the thin shell approach\npreviously successfully used in several backgrounds. We find that the\nthermalization depends on the chosen direction because of the spatial\nanisotropy. The plasma thermalizes thus faster in the transversal direction\nthan in the longitudinal one. To probe the system described by the\nLifshitz-like backgrounds, we also calculate the holographic entanglement\nentropy for the subsystems delineated along both transversal and longitudinal\ndirections. We show that the entropy has some universality in the behavior for\nboth subsystems. At the same time, we find that certain characteristics\nstrongly depend on the critical exponent $\\nu$.\n", "  We examine the superradiance of a Bose-Einstein condensate pumped with a\nLaguerre-Gaussian laser of high winding number, e.g., $\\ell = 7$. The laser\nbeam transfers its orbital angular momentum (OAM) to the condensate at once due\nto the collectivity of the superradiance. An $\\ell$-fold rotational symmetric\nstructure emerges with the take place of rotatory superradiance. $\\ell$ number\nof single-charge vortices appear at the arms of this structure. Even though the\npump and the condensate profiles initially have cylindrical symmetry, we\nobserve that it is broken to $\\ell$-fold rotational symmetry during the\nsuperradiance. Breaking of the cylindrical symmetry into the $\\ell$-fold\nsymmetry and OAM transfer to the BEC become possible after the same critical\npump strength. Reorganization of the condensate resembles the ordering in the\nexperiment by Esslinger and colleagues [Nature, {\\bf 264}, 1301 (2010)]. We\nshow that the critical point for the onset of the reorganization follows the\nform of the Dicke quantum phase transition.\n", "  A quantum channel physically is a unitary interaction between the information\ncarrying system and an environment, which is initialized in a pure state before\nthe interaction. Conventionally, this state, as also the parameters of the\ninteraction, is assumed to be fixed and known to the sender and receiver. Here,\nfollowing the model introduced by us earlier [Karumanchi et al.,\narXiv[quant-ph]:1407.8160], we consider a benevolent third party, i.e. a\nhelper, controlling the environment state, and how the helper's presence\nchanges the communication game. In particular, we define and study the\nclassical capacity of a unitary interaction with helper, indeed two variants,\none where the helper can only prepare separable states across many channel\nuses, and one without this restriction. Furthermore, the two even more powerful\nscenarios of pre-shared entanglement between helper and receiver, and of\nclassical communication between sender and helper (making them conferencing\nencoders) are considered.\n", "  Singly ionised Lutetium has recently been suggested as a potential clock\ncandidate. Here we report a joint experimental and theoretical investigation of\n\\ce{Lu^+}. Measurements relevant to practical clock operation are made and\ncompared to atomic structure calculations. Calculations of scalar and tensor\npolarizabilities for clock states over a range of wavelengths are also given.\nThese results will be useful for future work with this clock candidate.\n", "  In these lectures we review how the symmetries of gravitational theories may\nbe regarded as originating from those of \"Yang-Mills squared\". We begin by\nmotivating the idea that certain aspects of gravitational theories can be\ncaptured by the product, in some sense, of two distinct Yang-Mills theories,\nparticularly in the context of scattering amplitudes. We then introduce a\nconcrete dictionary for the covariant fields of (super)gravity in terms of the\nproduct of two (super) Yang-Mills theories. The dictionary implies that the\nsymmetries of each (super) Yang-Mills factor generate the symmetries of the\ncorresponding (super)gravity theory: general covariance, $p$-form gauge\ninvariance, local Lorentz invariance, local supersymmetry, R-symmetry and\nU-duality.\n", "  Inspired by the recent measurement of the ratio of $B_c$ branching fractions\nto $J/\\psi \\pi^+$ and $J/\\psi \\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu}$ final states at the LHCb\ndetector, we study the semileptonic decays of $B_c$ meson to the S-wave ground\nand radially excited 2S and 3S charmonium states with the perturbative QCD\napproach. After evaluating the form factors for the transitions $B_c\\rightarrow\nP,V$, where $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector S-wave charmonia,\nrespectively, we calculate the branching ratios for all these semileptonic\ndecays. The theoretical uncertainty of hadronic input parameters are reduced by\nutilizing the light-cone wave function for $B_c$ meson. It is found that the\npredicted branching ratios range from $10^{-6}$ up to $10^{-2}$ and could be\nmeasured by the future LHCb experiment. Our prediction for the ratio of\nbranching fractions $\\frac{\\mathcal {BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow J/\\Psi\n\\pi^+)}{\\mathcal {BR}(B_c^+\\rightarrow J/\\Psi \\mu^+\\nu_{\\mu})}$ is in good\nagreement with the data. For $B_c\\rightarrow V l \\nu_l$ decays, the relative\ncontributions of the longitudinal and transverse polarization are discussed in\ndifferent momentum transfer squared regions. These predictions will be tested\non the ongoing and forthcoming experiments.\n", "  In Bohmian mechanics, the nodes of the wave function play an important role\nin the generation of chaos. However, so far, most of the attention has been on\nmoving nodes; little is known about the possibility of chaos in the case of\nstationary nodes. We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.\nThat is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial\nvariations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.\nAnother aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which\nquantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent. We investigate possible correlations with quantities such as the\nparticipation ratio and different measures of entanglement, for different\nsystems and different families of stationary wave functions. We find that these\nquantities often tend to correlate to the amount of chaos. However, the\ncorrelation is not perfect, because, in particular, these measures do not\ndepend on the form of the basis states used to expand the wave function, while\nthe amount of chaos does.\n", "  AGN jets carry helical magnetic fields, which can affect dark matter if the\nlatter is axionic. This preliminary study shows that, in the presence of strong\nhelical magnetic fields, the nature of the axionic condensate may change and\nbecome dark energy. Such dark energy may affect galaxy formation and galactic\ndynamics, so this possibility should not be ignored when considering axionic\ndark matter.\n", "  Blast-wave model is applied to describe the Hanbury-Brown--Twiss (HBT) radii\nof pionic systems produced in pp collisions at the LHC energies.\n", "  The recent, unexpected, findings of upstream neutral modes in particle-like\nfractional quantum Hall states, led to a realization that the nature of the\nneutral modes is far from being understood. Moreover, the observation of\nspatially separated of (at least) two downstream charge modes in hole-conjugate\nstates (see Part One - Conductance), still faces unresolved contradictions\nbetween conductance and noise measurements. In this work we show how current\nfluctuations measured in various configurations shed light on the interplay\nbetween neutral and charge modes. We demonstrate that once one of the charge\nmodes is taken out of equilibrium, counter-propagating neutral modes born in\nthe equilibration process affect the upstream charge modes, giving rise to a\nnovel mechanism for shot noise with quantized Fano factors. We present a\ntheoretical model that accounts for most of the experimental observations.\n", "  The notion of weighted quantum entropy is reviewed and considered for\nbipartite and noncomposite quantum systems. The known for the weighted entropy\ninformation inequality (subadditivity condition) is extended to the case of\nindivisible qudit system on example of qutrit. This new inequality for qutrit\ndensity matrix is discussed for different cases of weights and states. The role\nof weighted entropy is discussed in connection with studies of nonlinear\nquantum channels.\n", "  In crystals, molecules thermally vibrate around the periodic lattice sites.\nVibrational motions are well understood in terms of phonons, which carry heat\nand control heat transport. The situation is notably different in disordered\nsolids, where vibrational excitations are not phonons and can be even\nlocalized. Recent numerical work has established the concept of elastic\nheterogeneity: disordered solids show inhomogeneous local mechanical response.\nClearly, the heterogeneous nature of elastic properties strongly influences\nvibrational and thermal properties, and it is expected to be the origin of\nanomalous features, including boson peak, vibrational localization, and\ntemperature dependence of thermal conductivity. These are all crucial\nlong-standing problems in materials physics, which we address in the present\nwork. We have considered a toy model able to stabilize different states of\nmatter, by introducing an increasing amount of size disorder. The phase diagram\ngenerated by molecular dynamics simulations encompasses the perfect crystalline\nstate with a spatially homogeneous elastic moduli distribution, multiple\ndefective phases with increasing moduli heterogeneities, and eventually a\nseries of amorphous states. We have established clear correlations among the\nheterogeneous local mechanical response, vibrational states, and thermal\nconductivity. We provide evidence that elastic heterogeneity controls both\nvibrational and thermal properties, and is a key concept to understand the\nanomalous puzzling features of disordered solids.\n", "  The tuning of electrical circuit resonance with a variable capacitor, or\nvaractor, finds wide application with the most important being wireless\ntelecommunication. We demonstrate an electromechanical graphene varactor, a\nvariable capacitor wherein the capacitance is tuned by voltage controlled\ndeflection of a dense array of suspended graphene membranes. The low flexural\nrigidity of graphene monolayers is exploited to achieve low actuation voltage\nin an ultra-thin structure. Large arrays comprising thousands of suspensions\nwere fabricated to give a tunable capacitance of over 10 pF/mm$^2$, higher than\nthat achieved by traditional micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)\ntechnologies. A capacitance tuning of 55% was achieved with a 10 V actuating\nvoltage, exceeding that of conventional MEMS parallel plate capacitors.\nCapacitor behavior was investigated experimentally, and described by a simple\ntheoretical model. Mechanical properties of the graphene membranes were\nmeasured independently using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Increased graphene\nconductivity will enable the application of the compact graphene varactor to\nradio frequency systems.\n", "  Combining the recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, we construct a tight-binding\nmodel suitable for describing the band structure of monolayer FeSe grown on\nSrTiO$_{3}$. Then we propose a possible pairing function, which can well\ndescribe the gap anisotropy observed by ARPES and has a hidden sign-changing\ncharacteristic. At last, as a test of this pairing function we further study\nthe nonmagnetic impurity-induced bound states, to be verified by future STM\nexperiments.\n", "  We investigate the four-derivative free Weyl action for two-column\nmixed-symmetry field that makes use of maximal gauge symmetries. In flat space,\nthe action can be uniquely determined from gauge and Weyl (trace shift)\nsymmetry requirements. We show that there is a smooth and unique deformation of\nthe flat action to (A)dS which keeps the same amount of gauge symmetries. This\naction admits a factorization into two distinct two-derivative actions having\ngauge parameters of different Young diagrams. Hence, this factorization pattern\nnaturally extends that of the Weyl actions of symmetric higher spin fields to\nmixed-symmetry cases. The mass-deformation for these actions can be realized\npreserving one of the gauge symmetries. Although generically non-unitary, in\nspecial dimensions, unitarity is achieved selecting different mass deformations\nfor dS and AdS. We consider particular examples of our construction such as New\nMassive Gravity in three dimensions, linearized bigravity in four dimensions\nand their arbitrary dimensional generalizations.\n", "  The nonlinear theory of Landau damping of electrostatic wave envelopes (WEs)\nis revisited in a quantum electron-positron (EP) pair plasma. Starting from a\nWigner-Moyal equation coupled to the Poisson equation and applying the multiple\nscale technique, we derive a nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger (NLS) equation which\ngoverns the evolution of electrostatic WEs. It is shown that the coefficients\nof the NLS equation, including the nonlocal nonlinear term, which appears due\nto the resonant particles having group velocity of the WEs, are significantly\nmodified by the particle dispersion. The effects of the quantum parameter $H$\n(the ratio of the plasmon energy to the thermal energy densities), associated\nwith the particle dispersion, are examined on the Landau damping rate of\ncarrier waves, as well as on the modulational instability of WEs. It is found\nthat the Landau damping rate and the decay rate of the solitary wave amplitude\nare greatly reduced compared to their classical values $(H=0)$.\n", "  Optically linked ion traps are promising as components of network-based\nquantum technologies, including communication systems and modular computers.\nExperimental results achieved to date indicate that the fidelity of operations\nwithin each ion trap module will be far higher than the fidelity of operations\ninvolving the links; fortunately internal storage and processing can\neffectively upgrade the links through the process of purification. Here we\nperform the most detailed analysis to date on this purification task, using a\nprotocol which is balanced to maximise fidelity while minimising the device\ncomplexity and the time cost of the process. Moreover we 'compile down' the\nquantum circuit to device-level operations including cooling and shutting\nevents. We find that a linear trap with only five ions (two of one species,\nthree of another) can support our protocol while incorporating desirable\nfeatures such as 'global control', i.e. laser control pulses need only target\nan entire zone rather than differentiating one ion from its neighbour. To\nevaluate the capabilities of such a module we consider its use both as a\nuniversal communications node for quantum key distribution, and as the basic\nrepeating unit of a quantum computer. For the latter case we evaluate the\nthreshold for fault tolerant quantum computing using the surface code, finding\nacceptable fidelities for the 'raw' entangling link as low as 83% (or under 75%\nif an additional ion is available).\n", "  We study the information loss of a class of inference strategies that is\nsolely based on time averaging. For an array of independent binary sensors\n(e.g., receptors, single electron transistors) measuring a weak random signal\n(e.g., ligand concentration, gate voltage) this information loss is up to 0.5\nbit per measurement irrespective of the number of sensors. We derive a\ncondition related to the local detailed balance relation that determines\nwhether or not such a loss of information occurs. Specifically, if the free\nenergy difference arising from the signal is symmetrically distributed among\nthe forward and backward rates, time integration mechanisms will capture the\nfull information about the signal. As an implication, for the linear noise\napproximation, we can identify the same loss of information, arising from its\ninherent simplification of the dynamics.\n", "  We show the renormalization of contact interaction for odd-wave scattering in\none-dimension(1D). Based on the renormalized interaction, we exactly solve the\ntwo-body problem in a harmonic trap, and further explore the universal\nproperties of spin-polarized fermions near odd-wave resonance using the\noperator product expansion method. It is found that the high-momentum\ndistribution behaves as $C/k^2$, with $C$ the odd-wave contact. Various\nuniversal relations are derived. Our work suggests a new universal system\nemergent in 1D with large odd-wave scattering length.\n", "  In a gas of $N$ weakly interacting bosons \\cite{Bogo1, Bogo2}, a truncated\ncanonic Hamiltonian $\\widetilde{h}_c$ follows from dropping all the interaction\nterms between free bosons with momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{k}\\ne\\mathbf{0}$.\nBogoliubov Canonic Approximation (BCA) is a further manipulation, replacing the\nnumber \\emph{operator} $\\widetilde{N}_{in}$ of free particles in\n$\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$, with the total number $N$ of bosons. BCA transforms\n$\\widetilde{h}_c$ into a different Hamiltonian\n$H_{BCA}=\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}\\ne\\mathbf{0}}\\epsilon(k)B^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}B_\\mathbf{k}+const$,\nwhere $B^\\dagger_\\mathbf{k}$ and $B_\\mathbf{k}$ create/annihilate non\ninteracting pseudoparticles. The problem of the \\emph{exact} eigenstates of the\ntruncated Hamiltonian is completely solved in the thermodynamic limit (TL) for\na special class of eigensolutions $|\\:S,\\:\\mathbf{k}\\:\\rangle_{c}$, denoted as\n\\textquoteleft s-pseudobosons\\textquoteright, with energies\n$\\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$ and \\emph{zero} total momentum. Some preliminary results\nare given for the exact eigenstates (denoted as \\textquoteleft\n$\\eta$-pseudobosons\\textquoteright), carrying a total momentum\n$\\eta\\hbar\\mathbf{k}$ ($\\eta=\\:1,\\:2,\\: \\dots$). A comparison is done with\n$H_{BCA}$ and with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory (GPT), showing that some\ndifferences between exact and BCA/GPT results persist even in the TL. Finally,\nit is argued that the emission of $\\eta$-pseudobosons, which is responsible for\nthe dissipation $\\acute{a}$ \\emph{la} Landau \\cite{L}, could be significantly\ndifferent from the usual picture, based on BCA pseudobosons.\n", "  Counterfactual definiteness must be used as at least one of the postulates or\naxioms that are necessary to derive Bell-type inequalities. It is considered by\nmany to be a postulate that is not only commensurate with classical physics (as\nfor example Einstein's special relativity), but also separates and\ndistinguishes classical physics from quantum mechanics. It is the purpose of\nthis paper to show that Bell's choice of mathematical functions and independent\nvariables implicitly includes counterfactual definiteness and reduces the\ngenerality of the physics of Bell-type theories so significantly that no\nmeaningful comparison of these theories with actual Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen\nexperiments can be made.\n", "  We solve exactly the dielectric response of a non-insulating sphere of radius\n$a$ suspended in symmetric, univalent electrolyte solution, with\nideally-polarizable interface but without significant $\\zeta$-potential. We\nthen use this solution to derive the dielectric response of a dilute random\nsuspension of such spheres, with volume fraction $f\\ll1$, within the\nMaxwell-Garnett Effective Medium Approximation. Surprisingly, we discover a\nhuge dielectric enhancement in this bare essential model of dielectric\nresponses of solids in electrolyte solution: at low frequency $\\omega\\tau_D \\ll\n(\\lambda/a) / (\\sigma_w / \\sigma_s+1/2)$, the real part of the effective\ndielectric constant of the mixture is $1-(3f/2)+(9f/4)(a/\\lambda)$. Here\n$\\sigma_{w/s}$ is the conductivity of the electrolyte solution/solids,\n$\\lambda$ is the Debye screening length in the solution, $\\tau_D=\\lambda^2/D$\nis the standard time scale of diffusion and $D$ is the ion diffusion\ncoefficient. As $\\lambda$ is of the order nm even for dilute electrolyte\nsolution, even for sub-mm spheres and low volume fraction $f=0.05$ the huge\ngeometric factor $a/\\lambda$ implies an over $10^4$-fold enhancement.\nFurthermore, we show that this enhancement produces a significant low frequency\n($\\omega\\tau_D\\ll1$) phase shift $\\tan\\theta = \\mathrm{Re}~ \\epsilon(\\omega) /\n\\mathrm{Im} ~\\epsilon(\\omega)$ in a simple impedance measurement of the\nmixture, which is usually negligible in pure electrolyte solution. The phase\nshift has a scale-invariant maximum\n$\\tan\\theta_{\\mathrm{max}}=(9/4)f/(2\\sigma_w/\\sigma_s+1)$ at\n$\\omega_{\\mathrm{max}}=(2D/\\lambda a)/(2\\sigma_w/\\sigma_s+1)$. We provide a\nphysical picture of the enhancement from an accumulation of charges in a thin\nExternally Induced Double Layer (EIDL) due to the blocking boundary conditions\non interfaces.\n", "  John Bell is generally credited to have accomplished the remarkable \"proof\"\nthat any theory of physics, which is both Einstein-local and \"realistic\"\n(counterfactually definite), results in a strong upper bound to the\ncorrelations that are measured in space and time. He thus predicts that\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments cannot violate Bell- type inequalities. We\npresent a counterexample to this claim, based on discrete-event computer\nsimulations. Our model-results fully agree with the predictions of quantum\ntheory for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments and are free of the\ndetection- or a coincidence-loophole.\n", "  In an optomechanical setup, the coupling between cavity and resonator can be\nincreased by tuning them to the same frequency. We study this interaction\nbetween a carbon nanotube resonator and a radio-frequency circuit. In this\nresonant regime, the vacuum optomechanical coupling is enhanced by the DC\nvoltage coupling the cavity and the mechanical resonator. Using the cavity to\ndetect the nanotube's motion, we observe and simulate interference between\nmechanical and electrical oscillations. We measure the mechanical ring-down and\nshow that further improvements to the system could enable measurement of\nmechanical motion at the quantum limit.\n", "  We investigate a single laser driven atom trapped in a non-harmonic\npotential. We present the performance of ground-state laser cooling and Doppler\ncooling and the signatures of the center-of-mass motion in the power spectrum\nof the scattered light. In order to illustrate the results we provide two\nexplicit examples for the confining potential: the infinite square well and the\nMorse potential.\n", "  The scattering matrix $S$ obeys the unitary relation $S^\\dagger S=1$ in a\nHermitian system and the symmetry property ${\\cal PT}S{\\cal PT}=S^{-1}$ in a\nParity-Time (${\\cal PT}$) symmetric system. Here we report a different symmetry\nrelation of the $S$ matrix in a one-dimensional heterostructure, which is given\nby the amplitude ratio of the incident waves in the scattering eigenstates. It\noriginates from the optical reciprocity and holds independent of the\nHermiticity or $\\cal PT$ symmetry of the system. Using this symmetry relation,\nwe probe a quasi-transition that is reminiscent of the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of a $\\cal PT$-symmetric $S$ matrix, now with unbalanced gain and loss\nand even in the absence of gain. We show that the additional symmetry relation\nprovides a clear evidence of an exceptional point, even when all other\nsignatures of the $\\cal PT$ symmetry breaking are completely erased. We also\ndiscuss the existence of a final exceptional point in this correspondence,\nwhich is attributed to asymmetric reflections from the two sides of the\nheterostructure.\n", "  CT protocol design and quality control would benefit from automated tools to\nestimate the quality of generated CT images. These tools could be used to\nidentify erroneous CT acquisitions or refine protocols to achieve certain\nsignal to noise characteristics. This paper investigates blind estimation\nmethods to determine global signal strength and noise levels in chest CT\nimages. Methods: We propose novel performance metrics corresponding to the\naccuracy of noise and signal estimation. We implement and evaluate the noise\nestimation performance of six spatial- and frequency- based methods, derived\nfrom conventional image filtering algorithms. Algorithms were tested on patient\ndata sets from whole-body repeat CT acquisitions performed with a higher and\nlower dose technique over the same scan region. Results: The proposed\nperformance metrics can evaluate the relative tradeoff of filter parameters and\nnoise estimation performance. The proposed automated methods tend to\nunderestimate CT image noise at low-flux levels. Initial application of\nmethodology suggests that anisotropic diffusion and Wavelet-transform based\nfilters provide optimal estimates of noise. Furthermore, methodology does not\nprovide accurate estimates of absolute noise levels, but can provide estimates\nof relative change and/or trends in noise levels.\n", "  This paper considers aspects of 4-manifold topology from the point of view of\nthe null cone of a neutral metric, a point of view we call neutral causal\ntopology. In particular, we construct and investigate neutral 4-manifolds with\nnull boundaries that arise from canonical 3- and 4-dimensional settings.\n  A null hypersurface is foliated by its normal and, in the neutral case,\ninherits a pair of totally null planes at each point. This paper focuses on\nthese plane bundles in a number of classical settings\n  The first construction is the conformal compactification of flat neutral\n4-space into the 4-ball. The null foliation on the boundary in this case is the\nHopf fibration on the 3-sphere and the totally null planes in the boundary are\nintegrable. The metric on the 4-ball is a conformally flat, scalar-flat,\npositive Ricci curvature neutral metric.\n  The second constructions are subsets of the 4-dimensional space of oriented\ngeodesics in a 3-dimensional space-form, equipped with its canonical neutral\nmetric. We consider all oriented geodesics tangent to a given embedded strictly\nconvex 2-sphere.\n  The third is a neutral geometric model for the intersection of two surfaces\nin a 4-manifold. The surfaces are the sets of oriented normal lines to two\nround spheres in Euclidean 3-space, which form Lagrangian surfaces in the\n4-dimensional space of all oriented lines. The intersection of the boundaries\nof their normal neighbourhoods form tori that we prove are totally real and\nLorentz if the spheres do not intersect.\n  We conclude with possible topological applications of the three\nconstructions, including neutral Kirby calculus, neutral knot invariants and\nneutral Casson handles, respectively.\n", "  The self-similar expansion of a blast wave, well-studied in air, has peculiar\ncounterparts in dense and dissipative media such as granular gases. Recent\nresults have shown that, while the traditional Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov (TvNS)\nderivation is not applicable to such granular blasts, they can nevertheless be\nwell understood via a combination of microscopic and hydrodynamic insights. In\nthis article, we provide a detailed analysis of these methods associating\nMolecular Dynamics simulations and continuum equations, which successfully\npredict hydrodynamic profiles, scaling properties and the instability of the\nself-similar solution. We also present new results for the energy conserving\ncase, including the particle-level analysis of the classic TvNS solution and\nits breakdown at higher densities.\n", "  We demonstrate an accurate method to control the motion of a micromechanical\noscillator in contact with a thermal bath. The experiment is carried out on the\ncantilever tip of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Applying an appropriate\ntime dependent external force, we decrease the time necessary to reach\nequilibrium by two orders of magnitude compared to the intrinsic equilibration\ntime. Finally, we analyze the energetic cost of such a fast equilibration, by\nmeasuring with kBT accuracy the energy exchanges along the process.\n", "  Far as we know there are not exact solutions to the equation of motion for a\nrelativistic harmonic oscillator. In this paper, the relativistic harmonic\noscillator equation which is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation is\nstudied by means of a combined use of the Adomian Decomposition Method and the\nLaplace Transform (LADM). The results that we have obtained, a series of powers\nof functions, have never been reported and show a very good match when compared\nwith other approximate solutions, obtained by different methods. The method\nhere proposed works with high degree of accuracy and because it requires less\ncomputational effort, it is very convenient to solve this kind of nonlinear\ndifferential equations.\n", "  One of the most important problems in development is how epigenetic domains\ncan be first established, and then maintained, within cells. To address this\nquestion, we propose a framework which couples 3D chromatin folding dynamics,\nto a \"recolouring\" process modelling the writing of epigenetic marks. Because\nmany intra-chromatin interactions are mediated by bridging proteins, we\nconsider a \"two-state\" model with self-attractive interactions between two\nepigenetic marks which are alike (either active or inactive). This model\ndisplays a first-order-like transition between a swollen, epigenetically\ndisordered, phase, and a compact, epigenetically coherent, chromatin globule.\nIf the self-attraction strength exceeds a threshold, the chromatin dynamics\nbecomes glassy, and the corresponding interaction network freezes. By modifying\nthe epigenetic read-write process according to more biologically-inspired\nassumptions, our polymer model with recolouring recapitulates the\nultrasensitive response of epigenetic switches to perturbations, and accounts\nfor multi-domain conformations, strikingly similar to the\ntopologically-associating-domains observed in eukaryotic chromosomes.\n", "  We study the problem of flow of a neutral gas past an infinite cylinder at\nright angle to its axis at low Reynolds number when the fluid is characterized\nby broken time-reversal invariance, and hence by odd viscosity in addition to\nthe normal even one. We solve the Oseen approximation to Navier-Stokes equation\nand calculate the lift force which appears due to the odd viscosity.\n", "  Minimal hybrid inflation in supergravity has been ruled out by the 2015\nPlanck observations because the spectral index of the produced curvature\nperturbation falls outside observational bounds. To resurrect the model, a\nnumber of modifications have been put forward but many of them spoil the\naccidental cancellation that resolves the eta-problem and require complicated\nKahler constructions to counterbalance the lost cancellation. In contrast, in\nthis paper the model is rendered viable by supplementing the scenario with a\nbrief period of thermal inflation, which follows the reheating of primordial\ninflation. The scalar field responsible for thermal inflation requires a large\nnon-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) and a flat potential. We investigate\nthe VEV of such a flaton field and its subsequent effect on the inflationary\nobservables. We find that, for large VEV, minimal hybrid inflation in\nsupergravity produces a spectral index within the 1-sigma Planck bound and a\ntensor-to-scalar ratio which may be observable in the near future. The\nmechanism is applicable to other inflationary models.\n", "  The underlying physics of basketball shooting seems to be a straightforward\nexample of the Newtonian mechanics that can easily be traced by numerical\nmethods. However, a human basketball player does not make use of all the\npossible basketball trajectories. Instead, a basketball player will build up a\ndatabase of successful shots and select the trajectory that has the greatest\ntolerance to small variations of the real world. We simulate the basketball\nplayer's shooting training as a Monte Carlo sequence to build optimal shooting\nstrategies, such as the launch speed and angle of the basketball, and whether\nto take a direct shot or a bank shot, as a function of the player's court\npositions and height. The phase space volume that belongs to the successful\nlaunch velocities generated by Monte Carlo simulations are then used as the\ncriterion to optimize a shooting strategy that incorporates not only\nmechanical, but human factors as well.\n", "  We provide a characterization of energy in the form of exchanged heat and\nwork between two interacting constituents of a closed, bipartite, correlated\nquantum system. By defining a binding energy we derive a consistent quantum\nformulation of the first law of thermodynamics, in which the role of\ncorrelations becomes evident, and this formulation reduces to the standard\nclassical picture in relevant systems. We next discuss the emergence of the\nsecond law of thermodynamics under certain---but fairly general---conditions\nsuch as the Markovian assumption. We illustrate the role of correlations and\ninteractions in thermodynamics through two examples.\n", "  It is commonly believed that quantum isolated systems satisfying the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) are diffusive. We show that this\nassumption is too restrictive, since there are systems that are asymptotically\nin a thermal state, yet exhibit anomalous, subdiffusive thermalization. We show\nthat such systems satisfy a modified version of the ETH ansatz and derive a\ngeneral connection between the scaling of the variance of the offdiagonal\nmatrix elements of local operators, written in the eigenbasis of the\nHamiltonian, and the dynamical exponent. We find that for subdiffusively\nthermalizing systems the variance scales more slowly with system size than\nexpected for diffusive systems. We corroborate our findings by numerically\nstudying the distribution of the coefficients of the eigenfunctions and the\noffdiagonal matrix elements of local operators of the random field Heisenberg\nchain, which has anomalous transport in its thermal phase. Surprisingly, this\nsystem also has non-Gaussian distributions of the eigenfunctions, thus directly\nviolating Berry's conjecture.\n", "  We present a ground-based near-infrared search for lensed supernovae behind\nthe massive cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18, one of the most powerful\ngravitational telescopes that nature provides. Our survey was based on\nmulti-epoch $J$-band observations with the HAWK-I instrument on VLT, with\nsupporting optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our search resulted\nin the discovery of five high-redshift, $0.671<z<1.703$, photometrically\nclassified core-collapse supernovae with magnifications in the range $\\Delta m$\n= $-0.31$ to $-1.58$ mag, as calculated from lensing models in the literature.\nThanks to the power of the lensing cluster, the survey had the sensitivity to\ndetect supernovae up to very high-redshifts, $z$$\\sim$$3$, albeit for a limited\nregion of space. We present a study of the core-collapse supernova rates for\n$0.4\\leq z< 2.9$, and find good agreement with both previous estimates, and the\npredictions from the star formation history. During our survey, we also\ndiscovered 2 type Ia supernovae in A1689 cluster members, which allowed us to\ndetermine the cluster Ia rate to be $0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.09}\\pm0.01$\n$\\rm{SNuB}$$\\,h^2$ (SNuB$\\equiv 10^{-12} \\,\\rm{SNe} \\, L^{-1}_{\\odot,B}\nyr^{-1}$). The cluster rate normalized by the stellar mass is\n$0.10^{+0.13}_{-0.06}\\pm0.02$ in $\\rm SNuM$$\\,h^2$ (SNuM$\\equiv 10^{-12}\n\\,\\rm{SNe} \\, M^{-1}_{\\odot} yr^{-1}$). Furthermore, we explore the optimal\nfuture survey for improving the core-collapse supernova rate measurements at\n$z\\gtrsim2$ using gravitational telescopes, as well as for the detections with\nmultiply lensed images, and find that the planned WFIRST space mission has\nexcellent prospects. Massive clusters can be used as gravitational telescopes\nto significantly expand the survey range of supernova searches, with important\nimplications for the study of the high-$z$ transient universe.\n", "  We study how low-energy charge carriers scatter off periodic and linear\ngraphene grain boundaries oriented along the zigzag direction with a\nperiodicity three times greater than that of pristine graphene. These defects\nmap the two Dirac points into the same position, and thus allow for intervalley\nscattering to occur. Starting from graphene's first-neighbor tight-binding\nmodel we show how can we compute the boundary condition seen by graphene's\nmassless Dirac fermions at such grain boundaries. We illustrate this procedure\nfor the 3-periodic pentagon-only grain boundary, and then work out the\nlow-energy electronic scattering off this linear defect. We also compute the\neffective generalized potential seen by the Dirac fermions at the grain\nboundary region.\n", "  We show that it is possible to significantly reduce quadrupole and tensor\npolarizability shifts of a clock transition by operating at a judiciously\nchosen field-insensitive point. In some cases shifts are almost completely\neliminated making the transition an effective J = 0 to J = 0 candidate. This\nsignificantly improves the feasibility of a recent proposal for clock operation\nwith large ion crystals. For such multi-ion clocks, geometric constraints and\nselection rules naturally divide clock operation into two categories based on\nthe orientation of the magnetic field. We discuss the limitations imposed on\neach type and how calibrations might be carried out for clock operation.\n", "  We construct a new set of boundary conditions for higher spin gravity,\ninspired by a recent \"soft Heisenberg hair\"-proposal for General Relativity on\nthree-dimensional Anti-de Sitter. The asymptotic symmetry algebra consists of a\nset of affine $\\hat u(1)$ current algebras. Its associated canonical charges\ngenerate higher spin soft hair. We focus first on the spin-3 case and then\nextend some of our main results to spin-$N$, many of which resemble the spin-2\nresults: the generators of the asymptotic $W_3$ algebra naturally emerge from\ncomposite operators of the $\\hat u(1)$ charges through a twisted Sugawara\nconstruction; our boundary conditions ensure regularity of the Euclidean\nsolutions space independently of the values of the charges; solutions, which we\ncall \"higher spin black flowers\", are stationary but not necessarily\nspherically symmetric. Finally, we derive the entropy of higher spin black\nflowers, and find that for the branch that is continuously connected to the BTZ\nblack hole, it depends only on the affine purely gravitational zero modes.\nUsing our map to $W$-algebra currents we recover well-known expressions for\nhigher spin entropy. We also address higher spin black flowers in the metric\nformalism and achieve full consistency with previous results.\n", "  Here we report the synthesis, structure and detailed characterisation of\nthree n-membered oxovanadium rings,\nNa$_n$[(V=O)$_n$Na$_n$(H$_2$O)$_n$($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, or\n$\\gamma$-CD)$_2$]$m$H$_2$O (n = 6, 7, or 8), prepared by the reactions of\n(V=O)SO$_4$$\\cdot$$x$H$_2$O with $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, or $\\gamma$-cyclodextrins\n(CDs) and NaOH in water. Their alternating heterometallic vanadium/sodium\ncyclic core structures were sandwiched between two CD moieties such that O-Na-O\ngroups separated neighbouring vanadyl ions. Antiferromagnetic interactions\nbetween the $S$ = 1/2 vanadyl ions led to $S$ = 0 ground states for the\neven-membered rings, but to two quasi-degenerate $S$ = 1/2 states for the\nspin-frustrated heptanuclear cluster.\n", "  We study the large-$N$ scaling behavior of the $\\theta$ dependence of the\nground-state energy density $E(\\theta)$ of four-dimensional (4D) $SU(N)$ gauge\ntheories and two-dimensional (2D) $CP^{N-1}$ models, where $\\theta$ is the\nparameter associated with the Lagrangian topological term. We consider its\n$\\theta$ expansion around $\\theta=0$, $E(\\theta)-E(0) = {1\\over 2}\\chi\n\\,\\theta^2 ( 1 + b_2 \\theta^2 + b_4\\theta^4 +\\cdots)$ where $\\chi$ is the\ntopological susceptibility and $b_{2n}$ are dimensionless coefficients. We\nfocus on the first few coefficients $b_{2n}$, which parametrize the deviation\nfrom a simple Gaussian distribution of the topological charge at $\\theta=0$. We\npresent a numerical analysis of Monte Carlo simulations of 4D $SU(N)$ lattice\ngauge theories for $N=3,\\,4,\\,6$ in the presence of an imaginary $\\theta$ term.\nThe results provide a robust evidence of the large-$N$ behavior predicted by\nstandard large-$N$ scaling arguments, i.e. $b_{2n}= O(N^{-2n})$. In particular,\nwe obtain $b_2=\\bar{b}_2/N^2 + O(1/N^4)$ with $\\bar{b}_2=-0.23(3)$. We also\nshow that the large-$N$ scaling scenario applies to 2D $CP^{N-1}$ models as\nwell, by an analytic computation of the leading large-$N$ dependence.\n", "  A measurement of the total $pp$ cross section at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV\nis presented. An integrated luminosity of $500$ $\\mu$b$^{-1}$ was accumulated\nin a special run with high-$\\beta^{\\star}$ beam optics to measure the\ndifferential elastic cross section as a function of the Mandelstam momentum\ntransfer variable $t$. The measurement is performed with the ALFA sub-detector\nof ATLAS. Using a fit to the differential elastic cross section in the $-t$\nrange from $0.014$ GeV$^2$ to $0.1$ GeV$^2$ to extrapolate $t\\rightarrow 0$,\nthe total cross section, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}(pp\\rightarrow X)$, is measured\nvia the optical theorem to be: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tot}}(pp\\rightarrow X) =\n{96.07} \\; \\pm 0.18 \\; ({{stat.}}) \\pm 0.85 \\; ({{exp.}}) \\pm 0.31 \\; ({extr.})\n\\; {mb} \\;,$ where the first error is statistical, the second accounts for all\nexperimental systematic uncertainties and the last is related to uncertainties\nin the extrapolation $t\\rightarrow 0$. In addition, the slope of the\nexponential function describing the elastic cross section at small $t$ is\ndetermined to be $B = 19.74 \\pm 0.05 \\; ({{stat.}}) \\pm 0.23 \\; ({{syst.}}) \\;\n{GeV}^{-2}$.\n", "  Supersolid phases as a result of a coexistence of superfluid and density\nordered checkerboard phases are predicted to appear in ultracold Fermi\nmolecules confined in a bilayer array of two-dimensional square optical\nlattices. We demonstrate the existence of these phases within the inhomogeneous\nmean-field approach. In particular, we show that tuning the interlayer\nseparation distance at a fixed value of the chemical potential produces\ndifferent fractions of superfluid, density ordered, and supersolid phases.\n", "  Taking into account the mass splittings between three active neutrinos, we\ninvestigate impacts of dark energy on constraining the total neutrino mass\n$\\sum m_{\\nu}$ by using recent cosmological observations. We consider two\ntypical dark energy models, namely, the $w$CDM model and the holographic dark\nenergy (HDE) model, which both have an additional free parameter compared with\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model. We employ the Planck 2015 data of CMB temperature and\npolarization anisotropies, combined with low-redshift measurements on BAO\ndistance scales, type Ia supernovae, Hubble constant, and Planck lensing.\nCompared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model, our study shows that the upper limit on\n$\\sum m_{\\nu}$ becomes much looser in the $w$CDM model while much tighter in\nthe HDE model. In the HDE model, we obtain the $95\\%$ CL upper limit $\\sum\nm_{\\nu}<0.105~\\textrm{eV}$ for three degenerate neutrinos. This might be the\nmost stringent constraint on $\\sum m_{\\nu}$ by far and is almost on the verge\nof diagnosing the neutrino mass hierachies in the HDE model. However, the\ndifference of $\\chi^2$ is still not significant enough to distinguish the\nneutrino mass hierarchies, even though the minimal $\\chi^2$ of the normal\nhierarchy is slightly smaller than that of the inverted hierarchy.\n", "  We propose a scheme for quantum teleportation between two qubits, coupled\nsequentially to a cavity field. An implementation of the scheme is analyzed\nwith superconducting qubits and a transmission line resonator, where\nmeasurements are restricted to continuous probing of the field leaking from the\nresonator rather than instantaneous projective Bell state measurement. We show\nthat the past quantum state formalism [S. Gammelmark et al, Phys. Rev. 111,\n160401] can be successfully applied to estimate what would have been the most\nlikely Bell measurement outcome conditioned on our continuous signal record.\nThis information determines which local operation on the target qubit yields\nthe optimal teleportation fidelity. Our results emphasize the significance of\napplying a detailed analysis of quantum measurements in feed-forward protocols\nin non-ideal leaky quantum systems.\n", "  The consistency with Onsager's theorem is examined for commonly used\nperturbative approaches, such as the Redfield and second-order von Neumann\nmaster equations, for thermoelectric transport through nanostructures. We study\na double quantum dot, which requires coherences between states for a correct\ndescription, and we find that these perturbative approaches violate Onsager's\ntheorem. We show that the deviations from the theorem scale with the\nlead-coupling strength in an order beyond the one considered systematically in\nthe respective approach.\n", "  Quantum digital signatures apply quantum mechanics to the problem of\nguaranteeing message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical\nsecurity, which are complementary to the confidentiality realized by quantum\nkey distribution. Previous experimental demonstrations have been limited to\ntransmission distances of less than 5-km of optical fiber in a laboratory\nsetting. Here we report the first demonstration of quantum digital signatures\nover installed optical fiber as well as the longest transmission link reported\nto date. This demonstration used a 90-km long differential phase shift quantum\nkey distribution system to achieve approximately one signed bit per second - an\nincrease in the signature generation rate of several orders of magnitude over\nprevious optical fiber demonstrations.\n", "  Single crystals of $R$Mg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ ($R$=Y, Ce-Nd, Gd-Dy, Yb) were grown\nusing a high-temperature solution growth technique and were characterized by\nmeasurements of room-temperature x-ray diffraction, temperature-dependent\nspecific heat and temperature-, field-dependent resistivity and anisotropic\nmagnetization. YMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ is a non-local-moment-bearing metal with an\nelectronic specific heat coefficient, $\\gamma \\sim$ 15 mJ/mol K$^2$. Yb is\ndivalent and basically non-moment bearing in YbMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$. Ce is\ntrivalent in CeMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ with two magnetic transitions being observed at\n2.1 K and 1.5 K. PrMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ does not exhibit any magnetic phase\ntransition down to 0.5 K. The other members being studied ($R$=Nd, Gd-Dy) all\nexhibits antiferromagnetic transitions at low-temperatures ranging from 3.2 K\nfor NdMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ to 11.9 K for TbMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$. Whereas\nGdMg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ is isotropic in its paramagnetic state due to zero angular\nmomentum ($L$=0), all the other local-moment-bearing members manifest an\nanisotropic, planar magnetization in their paramagnetic states. To further\nstudy this planar anisotropy, detailed angular-dependent magnetization was\ncarried out on magnetically diluted (Y$_{0.99}$Tb$_{0.01}$)Mg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$ and\n(Y$_{0.99}$Dy$_{0.01}$)Mg$_{2}$Cu$_{9}$. Despite the strong, planar\nmagnetization anisotropy, the in-plane magnetic anisotropy is weak and\nfield-dependent. A set of crystal electric field parameters are proposed to\nexplain the observed magnetic anisotropy.\n", "  The local measurement of $H_0$ is in tension with the prediction of\n$\\Lambda$CDM model based on the Planck data. This tension may imply that dark\nenergy is strengthened in the late-time Universe. We employ the latest\ncosmological observations on CMB, BAO, LSS, SNe, $H(z)$ and $H_0$ to constrain\nseveral interacting dark energy models. Our results show no significant\nindications for the interaction between dark energy and dark matter. The $H_0$\ntension can be moderately alleviated, but not totally released.\n", "  We study the time evolution in the transverse-field Ising chain subject to\nquantum quenches of finite duration, ie, a continuous change in the transverse\nmagnetic field over a finite time. Specifically, we consider the dynamics of\nthe total energy, one- and two-point correlation functions and Loschmidt echo\nduring and after the quench as well as their stationary behaviour at late\ntimes. We investigate how different quench protocols affect the dynamics and\nidentify universal properties of the relaxation.\n", "  We study the collapse process of a homogeneous perfect fluid (in FLRW\nbackground) with a barotropic equation of state in Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in\nthe presence of phase space deformation effects. Such a deformation is\nintroduced as a particular type of non-commutativity between phase space\ncoordinates. For the commutative case, it has been shown in the literature [1],\nthat the dust collapse in BD theory leads to the formation of a spacetime\nsingularity which is covered by an event horizon. In comparison to general\nrelativity (GR), the authors concluded that the final state of black holes in\nBD theory is identical to the GR case but differs from GR during the dynamical\nevolution of the collapse process. However, the presence of non-commutative\neffects influences the dynamics of the collapse scenario and consequently a\nnon-singular evolution is developed in the sense that a bounce emerges at a\nminimum radius, after which an expanding phase begins. Such a behavior is\nobserved for positive values of the BD coupling parameter. For large positive\nvalues of the BD coupling parameter, when non-commutative effects are present,\nthe dynamics of collapse process differs from the GR case. Finally, we show\nthat for negative values of the BD coupling parameter, the singularity is\nreplaced by an oscillatory bounce occurring at a finite time, with the\nfrequency of oscillation and amplitude being damped at late times.\n", "  This summary presents personal highlights from the Structure Functions and\nPDFs Working Group (WG1) at DIS 2016.\n", "  We propose methods of optical pumping that are applicable to open,\nhigh-angular-momentum transitions in atoms and molecules, for which\nconventional optical pumping would lead to significant population loss. Instead\nof applying circularly polarized cw light, as in conventional optical pumping,\nwe propose to use techniques for coherent population transfer (e.g., adiabatic\nfast passage) to arrange the atoms so as to increase the entropy removed from\nthe system with each spontaneous decay from the upper state. This minimizes the\nnumber of spontaneous-emission events required to produce a stretched state,\nthus reducing the population loss due to decay to other states. To produce a\nstretched state in a manifold with angular momentum J, conventional optical\npumping requires about 2J spontaneous decays per atom, one of our proposed\nmethods reduces this to about log_2(2J), while another of the methods reduces\nit to about one spontaneous decay, independent of J.\n", "  In this talk, we first briefly review the isospin dependence of the total\nnucleon effective mass $M^{\\ast}_{J}$ inferred from analyzing nucleon-nucleus\nscattering data within an isospin dependent non-relativistic optical potential\nmodel, and the isospin dependence of the nucleon E-mass $M^{\\ast,\\rm{E}}_{J}$\nobtained from applying the Migdal-Luttinger theorem to a phenomenological\nsingle-nucleon momentum distribution in nuclei constrained by recent\nelectron-nucleus scattering experiments. Combining information about the\nisospin dependence of both the nucleon total effective mass and E-mass, we then\ninfer the isospin dependence of nucleon k-mass using the well-known relation\n$M^{\\ast}_{J}=M^{\\ast,\\rm{E}}_{J}\\cdot M^{\\ast,\\rm{k}}_{J}$. Implications of\nthe results on the nucleon mean free path (MFP) in neutron-rich matter are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Nonlinear nanophotonics is a rapidly developing field with many useful\napplications for a design of nonlinear nanoantennas, light sources, nanolasers,\nsensors, and ultrafast miniature metadevices. A tight confinement of the local\nelectromagnetic fields in resonant photonic nanostructures can boost nonlinear\noptical effects, thus offering versatile opportunities for subwavelength\ncontrol of light. To achieve the desired functionalities, it is essential to\ngain flexible control over the near- and far-field properties of\nnanostructures. Thus, both modal and multipolar analyses are widely exploited\nfor engineering nonlinear scattering from resonant nanoscale elements, in\nparticular for enhancing the near-field interaction, tailoring the far-field\nmultipolar interference, and optimization of the radiation directionality.\nHere, we review the recent advances in this recently emerged research field\nranging from metallic structures exhibiting localized plasmonic resonances to\nhybrid metal-dielectric and all-dielectric nanostructures driven by Mie-type\nmultipolar resonances and optically-induced magnetic response.\n", "  Superconductors and multiferroics are two of the hottest branches in\ncondensed matter physics. The connections between those two fields are\nfundamentally meaningful to unify the physical rules of correlated electrons.\nRecently, BaFe$_2$Se$_3$, was predicted to be multiferroic [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 187204 (2014)] due to its unique one-dimensional block-type\nantiferromagnetism. Here, another iron-selenide KFe$_2$Se$_2$, a parent state\nof iron-based superconductor, is predicted to be multiferroic. Its\ntwo-dimensional block-type antiferromagnetism can generate a moderate electric\ndipole for each Fe-Se layer via the Fe-Se-Fe exchange striction. Different\nstacking configurations of these magnetic blocks give closely proximate\nenergies and thus the ground state of KFe$_2$Se$_2$ may be switchable between\nantiferroelectric and ferroelectric phases.\n", "  The valence and spin state evolution of Mn and Co on TbMn$_{\\rm 1-x}$Co$_{\\rm\nx}$O$_3$ series is precisely determined by means of soft and hard x-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and K$\\beta$ x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES).\nOur results show the change from Mn$^{3+}$ to Mn$^{4+}$ both high-spin (HS)\ntogether with the evolution from Co$^{2+}$ HS to Co$^{3+}$ low-spin (LS) with\nincreasing $\\rm x$. In addition, high energy resolution XAS spectra on the K\npre-edge region are interpreted in terms of the strong charge transfer and\nhybridization effects along the series. These results correlate well with the\nspin values of Mn and Co atoms obtained from the K$\\beta$ XES data. From this\nstudy, we determine that Co enters into the transition metal sublattice of\nTbMnO$_3$ as a divalent ion in HS state, destabilizing the Mn long range\nmagnetic order since very low doping compositions (${\\rm x} \\le 0.1$). Samples\nin the intermediate composition range ($0.4 \\le {\\rm x} \\le 0.6$) adopt the\ncrystal structure of a double perovskite with long range ferromagnetic ordering\nwhich is due to Mn$^{4+}$-O-Co$^{2+}$ superexchange interactions with both\ncations in HS configuration. Ferromagnetism vanishes for ${\\rm x} \\ge 0.7$ due\nto the structural disorder that collapses the double perovskite structure. The\nspectroscopic techniques reveal the occurrence of Mn$^{4+}$ HS and a\nfluctuating valence state Co$^{2+}$ HS/Co$^{3+}$ LS in this composition range.\nDisorder and competitive interactions lead to a magnetic glassy behaviour in\nthese samples.\n", "  I report a theoretical study of collective coherent quantum-mechanical\noscillations in disordered superconducting quantum metamaterials (SQMs), i.e\nartificially fabricated arrays of interacting qubits (two-levels system). An\nunavoidable disorder in qubits parameters results in a substantial spread of\nqubits frequencies, and in the absence of electromagnetic interaction between\nqubits these individual quantum-mechanical oscillations of single qubits\nmanifest themselves by a large number of small resonant drops in the frequency\ndependent transmission of electromagnetic waves propagating through disordered\nSQM, $D(\\omega)$. We show that even a weak electromagnetic interaction between\nadjacent qubits can overcome the disorder and establish completely or partially\n\\emph{synchronized} quantum-mechanical dynamic state in the disordered SQM. In\nsuch a state a large amount of qubits displays the collective quantum\nmechanical oscillations, and this collective behavior manifests itself by a few\ngiant resonant drops in the $D(\\omega)$ dependence. The size of a system $r_0$\nshowing the collective (synchronized) quantum-mechanical behavior is determined\nin the one-dimensional SQMs as $r_0 \\simeq a [K/\\delta \\Delta]^2$, where $K$,\n$\\delta \\Delta$, $a$ are the energy of nearest-neighbor interaction, the spread\nof qubits energy splitting, and the distance between qubits, accordingly. We\nshow that this phenomenon has an origin in the Anderson localization of\nspinon-type excitations arising in the SQM. Our analysis is also in a good\naccord with recent experiments on the electrodynamics of the disordered 1D\nSQMs.\n", "  Resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) has recently become an increasingly important\ntool for the study of ordering phenomena in correlated electron systems. Yet,\nthe interpretation of the RXS experiments remains theoretically challenging due\nto the complexity of the RXS cross-section. Central to this debate is the\nrecent proposal that impurity-induced Friedel oscillations, akin to\nquasiparticle interference signals observed with the scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM), can lead to scattering peaks in the RXS experiments. The\npossibility that quasiparticle properties can be probed in RXS measurements\nopens up a new avenue to study the bulk band structure of materials with the\norbital and element selectivity provided by RXS. Here, we test these ideas by\ncombining RXS and STM measurements of the heavy fermion compound CeMIn$_5$ (M =\nCo, Rh). Temperature and doping dependent RXS measurements at the Ce-M$_4$ edge\nshow a broad scattering enhancement that correlates with the appearance of\nheavy f-electron bands in these compounds. The scattering enhancement is\nconsistent with the measured quasiparticle interference signal in the STM\nmeasurements, indicating that quasiparticle interference can be probed through\nthe momentum distribution of RXS signals. Overall, our experiments demonstrate\nnew opportunities for studies of correlated electronic systems using the RXS\ntechnique.\n", "  It has been shown in the past that many real-world networks exhibit community\nstructures and non-trivial clustering which comes with the occurrence of a\nnotable number of triangular connections. Yet the influence of such connection\npatterns on the dynamics of disease transmission is not fully understood. In\norder to study their role in the context of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible\n(SIS) epidemics we use the Triadic Random Graph (TRG) model to construct small\nnetworks (N=49) from distinct, closed, directed triadic subpatterns. We compare\nvarious global properties of TRGs and use the N-intertwined mean-field\napproximation (NIMFA) model to perform numerical simulations of SIS-dynamics on\nTRGs. The results show that the infection spread on undirected TRGs displays\nvery similar behavior to TRGs with an abundance of (directed) feed-back-loops,\nwhile using (directed) feed-forward-loops as network-entities significantly\nslows down the epidemic and lowers the number of infected individuals in the\nendemic state. Moreover, we introduce a novel stochastic approach for modelling\nthe SIS-epidemics on TRGs based on characterizing nodes according to their set\nof $\\left(k_{in},k_{out}\\right)$ within triads. Within this model, the topology\nof the network is given by the number and the local structure of directed\ntriadic motifs and not by the adjacency matrix. Nevertheless, the outcome of\nsimulations is qualitatively similar to the results of the NIMFA model.\n", "  The original ALHAMBRA catalogue contained over 400,000 galaxies selected\nusing a synthetic F814W image, to the magnitude limit AB(F814W)$\\approx$24.5.\nGiven the photometric redshift depth of the ALHAMBRA multiband data (<z>=0.86)\nand the approximately $I$-band selection, there is a noticeable bias against\nred objects at moderate redshift. We avoid this bias by creating a new\ncatalogue selected in the $K_s$ band. This newly obtained catalogue is\ncertainly shallower in terms of apparent magnitude, but deeper in terms of\nredshift, with a significant population of red objects at $z>1$. We select\nobjects using the $K_s$ band images, which reach an approximate AB magnitude\nlimit $K_s \\approx 22$. We generate masks and derive completeness functions to\ncharacterize the sample. We have tested the quality of the photometry and\nphotometric redshifts using both internal and external checks. Our final\ncatalogue includes $\\approx 95,000$ sources down to $K_s \\approx 22$, with a\nsignificant tail towards high redshift. We have checked that there is a large\nsample of objects with spectral energy distributions that correspond to that of\nmassive, passively evolving galaxies at $z > 1$, reaching as far as $z \\approx\n2.5$. We have tested the possibility of combining our data with deep infrared\nobservations at longer wavelengths, particularly Spitzer IRAC data.\n", "  The effect of force-depending radiation reaction on charge motion traveling\ninside an undulator is studied using the new force approach for radiation\nreaction. The effect on the dynamics of a charged particle is determined with\nthe hope that this one can be measured experimentally and can be determined\nwhether or not this approach points on the right direction to understand the\nnature of radiation reaction.\n", "  One of the most challenging problems in polymer physics is providing a\ntheoretical description for the behaviour of rings in dense solutions and\nmelts. Although it is nowadays well established that the overall size of a ring\nin these conditions scales like that of a collapsed globule, there is\ncompelling evidence that rings may exhibit ramified and tree-like\nconformations. In this work I show how to characterise these local tree-like\nstructures by measuring the local writhing of the rings' segments and by\nidentifying the patterns of intra-chain contacts. These quantities reveal two\nmajor topological structures: loops and terminal branches which strongly\nsuggest that the strictly double-folded \"lattice animal\" picture for rings in\nthe melt may be replaced by a more relaxed tree-like structure accommodating\nloops. In particular, I show that one can identify hierarchically looped\nstructures whose degree increases linearly with the size of a ring, and that\nterminal branches are found to store about 30% of the whole ring mass,\nirrespectively of its length. Finally, I draw an analogy between rings in the\nmelt and slip-linked chains, where contact points are enforced by mobile\nslip-links and for which a field-theoretic treatment can be employed to get\nsome insight into their typical conformations. These findings are ultimately\ndiscussed in the light of recent works on the static structure of rings and on\nthe existence of inter-ring threadings.\n", "  We present a study of the flavor form factors in the framework of a hard-wall\nAdS/QCD model and compare with the available experimental data. We obtain the\nflavor form factors by decomposing the Dirac and Pauli form factors for the\nnucleons using the charge and isospin symmetry. Further, we present a detailed\nstudy of the flavor structures of the charge and anomalous magnetization\ndensities in the transverse plane. Both the unpolarized and the transversely\npolarized nucleons are considered here. We compare the AdS/QCD results with two\nstandard phenomenological parametrizations.\n", "  We report absolutely calibrated measurements of diffuse radio emission\nbetween 90 and 190 MHz from the Experiment to Detect the Global EoR Signature\n(EDGES). EDGES employs a wide beam zenith-pointing dipole antenna centred on a\ndeclination of -26.7$^\\circ$. We measure the sky brightness temperature as a\nfunction of frequency averaged over the EDGES beam from 211 nights of data\nacquired from July 2015 to March 2016. We derive the spectral index, $\\beta$,\nas a function of local sidereal time (LST) and find -2.60 > $\\beta$ > -2.62\n$\\pm$0.02 between 0 and 12 h LST. When the Galactic Centre is in the sky, the\nspectral index flattens, reaching $\\beta$ = -2.50 $\\pm$0.02 at 17.7 h. The\nEDGES instrument is shown to be very stable throughout the observations with\nnight-to-night reproducibility of $\\sigma_{\\beta}$ < 0.003. Including\nsystematic uncertainty, the overall uncertainty of $\\beta$ is 0.02 across all\nLST bins. These results improve on the earlier findings of Rogers & Bowman\n(2008) by reducing the spectral index uncertainty from 0.10 to 0.02 while\nconsidering more extensive sources of errors. We compare our measurements with\nspectral index simulations derived from the Global Sky Model (GSM) of de\nOliveira-Costa et al. (2008) and with fits between the Guzm\\'an et al. (2011)\n45 MHz and Haslam et al. (1982) 408 MHz maps. We find good agreement at the\ntransit of the Galactic Centre. Away from transit, the GSM tends to\nover-predict (GSM less negative) by 0.05 < $\\Delta_{\\beta} =\n\\beta_{\\text{GSM}}-\\beta_{\\text{EDGES}}$ < 0.12, while the 45-408 MHz fits tend\nto over-predict by $\\Delta_{\\beta}$ < 0.05.\n", "  A fundamental assumption in the theory of brane world is that all matter and\nradiation are confined on the four-dimensional brane and only gravitons can\npropagate in the five-dimensional bulk spacetime. The brane world theory did\nnot provide an explanation for the existence of electromagnetic fields and the\norigin of the electromagnetic field equation. In this paper, we propose a model\nfor explaining the existence of electromagnetic fields on a brane and deriving\nthe electromagnetic field equation. Similar to the case in Kaluza-Klein theory,\nwe find that electromagnetic fields and the electromagnetic field equation can\nbe derived from the five-dimensional Einstein field equation. However, the\nderived electromagnetic field equation differs from the Maxwell equation by\ncontaining a term with the electromagnetic potential vector coupled to the\nspacetime curvature tensor. So it can be considered as generalization of the\nMaxwell equation in a curved spacetime. The gravitational field equation on the\nbrane is also derived with the stress-energy tensor for electromagnetic fields\nexplicitly included and the Weyl tensor term explicitly expressed with matter\nfields and their derivatives in the direction of the extra-dimension. The model\nproposed in the paper can be regarded as unification of electromagnetic and\ngravitational interactions in the framework of brane world theory.\n", "  The purpose of the paper is mainly to investigate the quantum critical\nbehavior of two-dimensional XY spin system by calculating quantum correlation\nand monogamy relation through implementation of quantum renormalization group\ntheory. Numerical analysis indicates that quantum correlation as well as\nquantum nonlocality can be used to efficiently detect the quantum critical\nproperty in two-dimensional XY spin system. The nonanalytic behavior of the\nfirst derivative of quantum correlation approaches infinity and the critical\npoint is reached as the size of the model increases. Furthermore, we discuss\nthe quantum correlation distribution in this model based on square of\nconcurrence (SC) and square of quantum discord (SQD). The monogamous properties\nof SC and SQD are obtained for the present system. We finally reveal that the\nmonogamy score can be used to capture the quantum critical point.\n", "  Optical microcavities supporting exciton-polariton quasi-particles offer one\nof the most powerful platforms for investigation of rapidly developing area of\ntopological photonics in general, and of photonic topological insulators in\nparticular. Energy bands of the microcavity polariton graphene are readily\ncontrolled by magnetic field and influenced by the spin-orbit coupling effects,\na combination leading to formation of linear unidirectional edge states in\npolariton topological insulators as predicted very recently. In this work we\ndepart from the linear limit of non-interacting polaritons and predict\ninstabilities of the nonlinear topological edge states resulting in formation\nof the localized topological quasi-solitons, which are exceptionally robust and\nimmune to backscattering wavepackets propagating along the graphene lattice\nedge. Our results provide a background for experimental studies of nonlinear\npolariton topological insulators and can influence other subareas of photonics\nand condensed matter physics, where nonlinearities and spin-orbit effects are\noften important and utilized for applications.\n", "  We have developed a technique to tune the carrier density in graphene using a\nlithium-ion-based solid electrolyte. We demonstrate that the solid electrolyte\ncan be used as both a substrate to support graphene and a back gate.It can\ninduce a change in the carrier density as large as 1*10^14/cm^2, which is much\nlarger than that induced with oxide-film dielectrics, and it is comparable with\nthat induced by liquid electrolytes. Gate modulation of the carrier density is\nstill visible at 150 K, which is lower than the glass transition temperature of\nmost liquid gating electrolytes.\n", "  Context. The Blazhko effect, in RR Lyrae type stars, is a century old\nmystery. Dozens of theory exists, but none have been able to entirely reproduce\nthe observational facts associated to this modulation phenomenon. Existing\ntheory all rely on the usual continuous modelization of the star. Aims. We\npresent a new paradigm which will not only explain the Blazhko effect, but at\nthe same time, will give us alternative explanations to the red limit of the\ninstability strip, the synchronization of layers, the mode selection and the\nexistence of a limit cycle for radially pulsating stars. Methods. We describe\nthe RR Lyrae type pulsating stars as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.\nConsidering a spatial discretisation of the star, supposing a spherical\nsymmetry, we develop the equation of motion and energy up to the third order in\nthe radial and adiabatic case. Then, we include the influence of the ionization\nregion as a relaxation oscillator by including elements from synchronisation\ntheory. Results. This discrete approach allows us to exploit existing results\nin the coupled nonlinear oscillator field. For instance, the study of\nsynchronicity leads to an explanation of the mode selection, the layers\nsynchronisation, the limit cycle and the red limit of the instability strip.\nBut, most of all, the analogy with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) experiment\nenables us to understand the Blazhko effect. The transfer of energy between\ndifferent modes, as induced by solitons, not only gives a plausible theory for\nlightcurve modulation, but also explains the asymmetry of sidelobes.\n", "  The long-time thermal relaxation of (TMTTF)$_2$Br, Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$\nand Sr$_2$Ca$_{12}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ single crystals at temperatures below 1 K\nand magnetic field up to 10 T is investigated. The data allow us to determine\nthe relaxation time spectrum of the low energy excitations caused by the\ncharge-density wave (CDW) or spin-density wave (SDW). The relaxation time is\nmainly determined by a thermal activated process for all investigated\nmaterials. The maximum relaxation time increases with increasing magnetic\nfield. The distribution of barrier heights corresponds to one or two Gaussian\nfunctions. The doping of Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_{x}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ with Ca leads to\na drastic shift of the relaxation time spectrum to longer time. The maximum\nrelaxation time changes from 50 s (x = 0) to 3000 s (x = 12) at 0.1 K and 10 T.\nThe observed thermal relaxation at x=12 clearly indicates the formation of the\nSDW ground state at low temperatures.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the band properties of 2D honeycomb plasmonic\nlattices consisting of metallic nanoparticles. By means of the coupled dipole\nmethod and quasi-static approximation, we theoretically analyze the band\nstructures stemming from near-field interaction of localized surface plasmon\npolaritons for both the infinite lattice and ribbons. Naturally, the\ninteraction of point dipoles decouples into independent out-of-plane and\nin-plane polarizations. For the out-of-plane modes, both the bulk spectrum and\nthe range of the momentum $k_{\\parallel}$ where edge states exist in ribbons\nare similar to the electronic bands in graphene. Nevertheless, the in-plane\npolarized modes show significant differences, which do not only possess\nadditional non-flat edge states in ribbons, but also have different\ndistributions of the flat edge states in reciprocal space. For in-plane\npolarized modes, we derived the bulk-edge correspondence, namely, the relation\nbetween the number of flat edge states at a fixed $k_\\parallel$, Zak phases of\nthe bulk bands and the winding number associated with the bulk hamiltonian, and\nverified it through four typical ribbon boundaries, i.e. zigzag, bearded\nzigzag, armchair, and bearded armchair. Our approach gives a new topological\nunderstanding of edge states in such plasmonic systems, and may also apply to\nother 2D \"vector wave\" systems.\n", "  Complex Langevin simulations have been able to successfully reproduce results\nfrom Monte Carlo methods in the region where the sign problem is mild and make\npredictions when it is exponentially hard. We present here our study of the QCD\nphase diagram and the boundary between the confined and deconfined phases in\nthe limit of heavy and dense quarks (HDQCD) for 3 different lattice volumes. We\nalso briefly discuss instabilities encountered in our simulations.\n", "  The paper focuses on the fact that quantum projective measurements do not\nnecessarily conserve energy. On the other hand the Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY)\ntheorem states that assuming a \"standard\" von Neumann measurement model and\n\"additivity\" of the total energy operator, projective measurements of a system\nmust conserve energy as defined by the system's energy operator. This paper\nexplores the ideas behind the WAY theorem in hopes of uncovering the origin of\nthe contradiction.\n  After Araki and Yanase published their proof of the WAY theorem, Yanase\nappended a new condition now known as the Yanase condition. Under the\nsimplifying assumption that the observable being measured has discrete and\nnon-degenerate eigenvalues, we prove that the Yanase condition actually follows\nfrom the hypotheses of the original WAY theorem.\n  The paper also proves that the hypotheses of the WAY theorem, together with\nthe simplifying assumption, imply that the energy operator for the measuring\napparatus must be a multiple of the identity, which seems physically unlikely.\nIt seems probable that this surprising conclusion, along with the Yanase\ncondition, also holds without the simplifying assumption.\n", "  We investigate the nature of low T/W dynamical instabilities in\ndifferentially rotating stars by means of linear perturbation. Here, T and W\nrepresent rotational kinetic energy and the gravitational binding energy of the\nstar. This is the first attempt to investigate low T/W dynamical instabilities\nas a complete set of the eigenvalue problem. Our equilibrium configuration has\n\"constant\" specific angular momentum distribution, which potentially contains a\nsingular solution in the perturbed enthalpy at corotation radius in linear\nperturbation. We find the unstable normal modes of differentially rotating\nstars by solving the eigenvalue problem along the equatorial plane of the star,\nimposing the regularity condition on the center and the vanished enthalpy at\nthe oscillating equatorial surface. We find that the existing pulsation modes\nbecome unstable due to the existence of the corotation radius inside the star.\nThe feature of the unstable mode eigenfrequency and its eigenfunction in the\nlinear analysis roughly agrees with that in three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations in Newtonian gravity. Therefore, our normal mode analysis in the\nequatorial motion proves valid to find the unstable equilibrium stars\nefficiently. Moreover, the nature of the eigenfunction that oscillates between\ncorotation and the surface radius for unstable stars requires reinterpretation\nof the pulsation modes in differentially rotating stars.\n", "  We study the excesses of $R(D^{(*)})$ and muon $g-2$ in the framework of a\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model with top quark flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC)\ncouplings. Considering the relevant theoretical and experimental constraints,\nwe find that the $R(D^{(*)})$ and muon $g-2$ excesses can be simultaneously\nexplained in a parameter space allowed by the constraints. In such a parameter\nspace the pseudoscalar ($A$) has a mass between 20 GeV and 150 GeV so that it\ncan be produced from the top quark FCNC decay $t\\to A c$. Focusing on its\ndominant decay $A\\to \\tau\\bar{\\tau}$, we perform a detailed simulation on\n$pp\\to t\\bar{t}\\to Wb Ac\\to jjbc\\tau\\bar{\\tau}$ and find that the $2\\sigma$\nupper limits from a data set of 30 (100) fb$^{-1}$ at the 13 TeV LHC can mostly\n(entirely) exclude such a parameter space.\n", "  The dynamical processes that control star formation in molecular clouds are\nnot well understood, and in particular, it is unclear if rotation plays a major\nrole in cloud evolution. We investigate the importance of rotation in cloud\nevolution by studying the kinematic structure of a spiral-shaped Galactic\nmolecular cloud G052.24+00.74. The cloud belongs to a large filament, and is\nstretching over ~ 100 pc above the Galactic disk midplane. The spiral-shaped\nmorphology of the cloud suggests that the cloud is rotating. We have analysed\nthe kinematic structure of the cloud, and study the fragmentation and star\nformation. We find that the cloud exhibits a regular velocity pattern along\nwest-east direction - a velocity shift of ~ 10 km/s at a scale of ~ 30 pc. The\nkinematic structure of the cloud can be reasonably explained by a model that\nassumes rotational support. Similarly to our Galaxy, the cloud rotates with a\nprograde motion. We use the formalism of Toomre (1964) to study the cloud's\nstability, and find that it is unstable and should fragment. The separation of\nclumps can be consistently reproduced assuming gravitational instability,\nsuggesting that fragmentation is determined by the interplay between rotation\nand gravity. Star formation occurs in massive, gravitational bound clumps.\n", "  We study the evolution of structures in turbulent, self-gravitating media,\nand present an analytical criterion $M_{\\rm crit} \\approx \\epsilon_{\\rm\ncascade}^{2/3} \\eta^{-2/3} G^{-1} l^{5/3}$ (where $M_{\\rm crit}$ is the\ncritical mass, $l$ is the scale, $\\epsilon_{\\rm cascade}\\approx \\eta\n\\sigma_{\\rm v}^3 /l $ is the turbulence energy dissipation rate of the ambient\nmedium, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $\\sigma_{\\rm v}$ is the velocity\ndispersion, $l$ is the scale and $\\eta\\approx 0.2$ is an efficiency parameter)\nfor an object to undergo quasi-isolated gravitational collapse. The criterion\nalso defines the critical scale ($l_{\\rm crit} \\approx \\epsilon_{\\rm\ncascade}^{1/2} \\eta^{-1/2} G^{-3/4} \\rho^{-3/4}$) for turbulent gravitational\ninstability to develop. The analytical formalism explains the size dependence\nof the masses of the progenitors of star clusters ($M_{\\rm cluster} \\sim R_{\\rm\ncluster}^{1.67}$) in our Galaxy.\n", "  We report the electromotive force (EMF) properties generated in 3d-transition\nferromagnetic metal (FM = Fe, Co, and Ni80Fe20) films themselves under their\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR). For Fe and Co films, the EMF due to the\nanomalous-Hall effect is dominantly generated under their FMR. Meanwhile, for a\nNi80Fe20 film, the EMF due to the inverse spin-Hall effect in the Ni80Fe20 film\nitself under the FMR is mainly generated. This tendency is qualitatively\nexplained with differences of the spin polarization, the spin Hall\nconductivity, the anomalous Hall conductivity, the magnetization saturation,\nand the resistivity of the FM films.\n", "  Determining ground state energies of quantum systems by hybrid\nclassical/quantum methods has emerged as a promising candidate application for\nnear-term quantum computational resources. Short of large-scale fault-tolerant\nquantum computers, small-scale devices can be leveraged with current\ncomputational techniques to identify important subspaces of relatively large\nHamiltonians. Inspired by the work that described the merging of dynamical\nmean-field theory (DMFT) with a small-scale quantum computational resource as\nan impurity solver [Bauer et al., arXiv:1510.03859v2], we describe an\nalternative embedding scheme, density matrix embedding theory (DMET), that\nnaturally fits with the output from the variational quantum eigensolver and\nother hybrid approaches. This approach is validated using a quantum abstract\nmachine simulator [Smith et al., arXiv:1608.03355] that reproduces the ground\nstate energy of the Hubbard model converged to the infinite limit.\n", "  Kinetic models of solid thermal decomposition are traditionally used for\nindividual fit of isothermal decomposition experimental data. However, this\nmethodology can provide unacceptable errors in some cases. To solve this\nproblem, a neural network (MLP) was developed and adopted in this work. The\nimplemented algorithm uses the rate constants as predetermined weights between\nthe input and intermediate layer and kinetic models as activation functions of\nneurons in the hidden layer. The contribution of each model in the overall fit\nof the experimental data is calculated as the weights between the intermediate\nand output layer. In this way, the phenomenon is better described as a sum of\nkinetic processes. Two rigid polyurethane foam samples: loaded with Al2O3 and\nno inorganic filler were used in this work. The R3 model described the thermal\ndecomposition kinetic process for all temperatures for both foams with smaller\nresidual error. However, the network residual errors are on average 102 times\nlower compared to this individual kinetic model. This improved methodology\nallows detailed study of physical processes and therefore a more accurate\ndetermination of kinetic parameters such as the activation energy and frequency\nfactor.\n", "  With the potential prospects of the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ at high-luminosity\ndedicated heavy-flavor factories, the bottom-changing ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$\n$B_{c}{\\pi}$, $B_{c}K$ weak decays are studied with the pQCD approach. It is\nfound that branching ratio for the color-favored and CKM-favored\n${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\pi}$ decay can reach up to ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-11})$. So the ${\\Upsilon}(1S)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\pi}$ decay might be\nmeasured promisingly by the future experiments.\n", "  The mechanical properties of crystalline materials can be substantially\nmodified under confinement. Such modified macroscopic properties are usually\ngoverned by the altered microstructures and internal stress fields. Here, we\nuse a parallel plate geometry to apply a quasi-static squeeze flow crushing a\ncolloidal polycrystal while simultaneously imaging it with confocal microscopy.\nThe confocal images are used to quantify the local structure order and, in\nconjunction with Stress Assessment from Local Structural Anisotropy (SALSA),\ndetermine the stress at the single-particle scale. We find that during\ncompression, the crystalline regions break into small domains with different\ngeometric packing. These domains are characterized by a pressure and deviatoric\nstress that are highly localized with correlation lengths that are half those\nfound in bulk. Furthermore, the mean deviatoric stress almost doubles,\nsuggesting a higher brittleness in the highly-confined samples.\n", "  Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions (B(GT)) in electron-capture (EC)\ndaughters stemming from the parent ground state are computed with the\nshell-model in the full pf-shell space, with quasi-particle random-phase\napproximation (QRPA) in the formalism of Krumlinde and M\\\"oller and with an\nApproximate Method (AM) for assigning an effective B(GT). These are compared to\ndata available from decay and charge-exchange (CE) experiments across titanium\nisotopes in the pf-shell from A=43 to A=62, the largest set available for any\nchain of isotopes in the pf-shell. The present study is the first to examine\nB(GT) and the associated EC rates across a particular chain of isotopes with\nthe purpose of examining rate sensitivities as neutron number increases. EC\nrates are also computed for a wide variety of stellar electron densities and\ntemperatures providing concise estimates of the relative size of rate\nsensitivities for particular astrophysical scenarios. This work underscores the\nastrophysical motivation for CE experiments in inverse kinematics for nuclei\naway from stability at the luminosities of future Radioactive Ion Beam\nFacilities.\n", "  Coarse grid projection (CGP) methodology is a novel multigrid method for\nsystems involving decoupled nonlinear evolution equations and linear elliptic\nPoisson equations. The nonlinear equations are solved on a fine grid and the\nlinear equations are solved on a corresponding coarsened grid. Mapping\noperators execute data transfer between the grids. The CGP framework is\nconstructed upon spatial and temporal discretization schemes. This framework\nhas been established for finite volume/difference discretizations as well as\nexplicit time integration methods. In this article we present for the first\ntime a version of CGP for finite element discretizations, which uses a\nsemi-implicit time integration scheme. The mapping functions correspond to the\nfinite-element shape functions. With the novel data structure introduced, the\nmapping computational cost becomes insignificant. We apply CGP to\npressure-correction schemes used for the incompressible Navier-Stokes flow\ncomputations. This version is validated on standard test cases with realistic\nboundary conditions using unstructured triangular meshes. We also pioneer\ninvestigations of the effects of CGP on the accuracy of the pressure field. It\nis found that although CGP reduces the pressure field accuracy, it preserves\nthe accuracy of the pressure gradient and thus the velocity field, while\nachieving speedup factors ranging from approximately 2 to 30. Exploring the\ninfluence of boundary conditions on CGP, the minimum speedup occurs for\nvelocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the maximum speedup occurs for\nopen boundary conditions. We discuss the CGP method as a guide for partial mesh\nrefinement of incompressible flow computations and show its application for\nsimulations of flow over a backward-facing step and flow past a cylinder.\n", "  The precise measurement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment\n$a_\\mathrm{\\mu}$ has stimulated much theoretical and experimental efforts over\nmore than six decades. The last experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory,\nUpton, NY, USA obtained a value more than three standard deviations larger than\npredicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, and is one of the\nstrongest hints for physics beyond the Standard Model. A new experiment at\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA to measure\n$a_\\mathrm{\\mu}$ with fourfold increased precision to $140\\,\\mathrm{ppb}$ is\ncurrently in its commissioning phase. While the new experiment will reuse the\n$1.45\\,\\mathrm{T}$ superconducting muon storage ring which was shipped from\nBrookhaven National Laboratory, most of the other instrumentation of the\nexperiment will be new. This will allow the experiment to make efficient use of\nthe significantly higher number of muons available at the new muon campus. We\ndiscuss the general status of the experiment and in particular focus on the\nimproved tools available to homogenize and determine the magnetic field in the\nmuon storage ring.\n", "  We report a THz emitter with excellent performances based on nonmagnetic (NM)\nand ferromagnetic (FM) heterostructures. The spin currents are first excited by\nthe femtosecond laser beam in the NM/FM bilayer, and then transient charge\ncurrents are generated by inverse spin Hall effect, leading to THz emission out\nof the structure. The broadband THz waves emitted from our film stacks have a\npeak intensity exceeding 500 um thick ZnTe crystals (standard THz emitters).\nOur device is insensitive to the polarization of an incident laser beam which\nindicates the noise resistive feature. In contrast, the polarization of THz\nwaves is fully controllable by an external magnetic field. We have also\nfabricated the devices on flexible substrates with a great performance, and\ndemonstrated that the devices can be driven by low power lasers. Together with\nthe low cost and mass productive sputtering growth method for the film stacks,\nthe proposed THz emitters can be readily applied to a wide range of THz\nequipment. Our study also points towards an alternative approach to\ncharacterize spintronic devices with NM/FM bilayers.\n", "  We study the spin orbit torque (SOT) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) in the dual-interfaced Co-Ni perpendicular multilayers. Through the\ncombination of top and bottom layer materials (Pt, Ta, MgO and Cu), SOT and DMI\nare efficiently manipulated due to an enhancement or cancellation of the top\nand bottom contributions. However, SOT is found to originate mostly from the\nbulk of a heavy metal (HM), while DMI is more of interfacial origin. In\naddition, we find that the direction of the domain wall (DW) motion can be\neither along or against the electron flow depending on the DW tilting angle\nwhen there is a large DMI. Such an abnormal DW motion induces a large assist\nfield required for hysteretic magnetization reversal. Our results provide\ninsight into the role of DMI in SOT driven magnetization switching, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of achieving desirable SOT and DMI for spintronic\ndevices.\n", "  Spin waves are propagating disturbances in the magnetization of magnetic\nmaterials. One of their interesting properties is the nonreciprocity,\nexhibiting that their amplitude depends on the magnetization direction.\nNonreciprocity in spin waves is of great interest in both fundamental science\nand applications, as it offers an extra knob to control the flow of waves for\nthe technological fields of logics and switch applications. We show a high\nnonreciprocity in spin waves from Ta/Py bilayer systems with out-of-plane\nmagnetic fields. The nonreciprocity depends on the thickness of Ta underlayer\nwhich is found to induce an interfacial anisotropy. The origin of observed high\nnonreciprocity is twofold; different polarities of the in-plane magnetization\ndue to different angles of canted out-of-plane anisotropy and the spin pumping\neffect at the Ta/Py interface. Our findings provide an opportunity to engineer\nhighly efficient nonreciprocal spin wave based applications such as\nnonreciprocal microwave devices, magnonic logic gates, and information\ntransports.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) form a new class of materials with insulating\nbulk and surface conduction ensured by topologically protected surface states\n(TPSS). We investigate the impact of the helicity of a normally incident laser\nbeam on the photovoltaic effect in the TI Bi2Se3. The observation of a helicity\ndependent photovoltaic effect for normally incident light indicates the\npresence of out-of-plane spin components for some TPSSs due to the hexagonal\nwarping. In addition, fluctuations in the electrostatic potential at the\nsurface locally break the rotational symmetry of the film allowing the helicity\ndependent photovoltaic effect. Our result suggests that engineering local\nelectrostatic potentials in Bi2Se3 would allow the control of optically\ngenerated spin currents, which may be useful for applications in\nspin-optoelectronics.\n", "  Explicit multi-soliton and multi-peakon solutions of the Dullin-Gottwald-Holm\nequation are constructed via Darboux transformation and direct computation,\nrespectively. To this end we first map the Dullin-Gottwald-Holm equation to a\nnegative order KdV equation by a reciprocal transformation. Then we use the\nDarboux matrix approach to derive multi-soliton solutions of the\nDullin-Gottwald-Holm equation from the solutions of the negative order KdV\nequation. Finally, we find multi-peakon solutions of the Dullin-Gottwald-Holm\nequation in weak sense. For $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\alpha\\neq \\frac{1}{2}$,\nseveral types of two-peakon solutions are discussed in detail. Moreover, the\ndynamic behaviors of the obtained solutions are illustrated through some\nfigures.\n", "  Small angle neutron scattering measurements on a bulk single crystal of the\ndoped chiral magnet Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with $x$=0.3 reveal a pronounced effect\nof the magnetic history and cooling rates on the magnetic phase diagram. The\nextracted phase diagrams are qualitatively different for zero and field cooling\nand reveal a metastable skyrmion lattice phase outside the A-phase for the\nlatter case. These thermodynamically metastable skyrmion lattice correlations\ncoexist with the conical phase and can be enhanced by increasing the cooling\nrate. They appear in a wide region of the phase diagram at temperatures below\nthe $A$-phase but also at fields considerably smaller or higher than the fields\nrequired to stabilize the A-phase.\n", "  In the present work we introduce a path to the controlled construction of\nDSSCs based on hierarchically structured single walled, self-organized TiO2\nlayers. In a first step we describe a simple approach to selectively remove the\ninner detrimental shell of anodic TiO2 nanotubes (NTs). This then allows\ncontrolled well-defined layer-by-layer decoration of these TiO2-NT walls with\nTiO2 nanoparticles (this in contrast to conventional TiO2 nanotubes). We show\nthat such defined multiple layered decoration can be optimized to build dye\nsensitized solar cells that (under back-side illumination conditions) can yield\nsolar light conversion efficiencies in the range of 8 %. The beneficial effects\nobserved can be ascribed to a combination of three factors : 1) improved\nelectronic properties of the single walled tubes themselves, 2) a further\nimprovement of the electronic properties by the defined TiCl4 treatment, and 3)\na higher specific dye loading that becomes possible for the layer-by-layer\ndecorated single walled tubes.\n", "  When submitted to a constant mechanical load, many amorphous solids display\npower law creep followed by fluidization. A fundamental understanding of these\nprocesses is still far from being achieved. Here, we characterize creep and\nfluidization on the basis of a mesoscopic viscoplastic model that includes\nthermally activated yielding events and a broad distribution of energy\nbarriers, which may be lowered under the effect of a local deformation. We\nrelate the creep exponent observed before fluidization to the width of barrier\ndistribution and to the specific form of stress redistribution following\nyielding events. We show that Andrade creep is accompanied by local\nstrain-hardening driven by stress redistribution and find that the fluidization\ndepends exponentially on the applied stress. The simulation results are\ninterpreted in the light of a mean-field analysis, and should help in\nrationalizing the creep phenomenology of amorphous solids.\n", "  We study incompressible imbalanced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the\npresence of background velocity shears. Using scaling arguments, we show that\nthe turbulent cascade is significantly accelerated when the background velocity\nshear is stronger than the velocity shears in the subdominant Alfv% \\'{e}n\nwaves at the injection scale. The spectral transport is then controlled by the\nbackground shear rather than the turbulent shears and the Tchen spectrum with\nspectral index $-1$ is formed. This spectrum extends from the injection scale\nto the scale of the spectral break where the subdominant wave shear becomes\nequal to the background shear. The estimated spectral breaks and power spectra\nare in good agreement with those observed in the fast solar wind. The proposed\nmechanism can contribute to enhanced turbulent cascades and modified $-1$\nspectra observed in the fast solar wind with strong velocity shears. This\nmechanism can also operate in many other astrophysical environments where\nturbulence develops on top of non-uniform plasma flows.\n", "  In this paper we study the two disks capacitor, for equal and different\nradii. The new results obtained allow a complete characterization of capacity\ncoefficients and forces at short distances. An extensive numerical calculation\nconfirms the theoretical results. The study shows the existence of a hierarchy\nin the divergent behavior of the capacitance coefficients and this implies some\nunusual behavior of the forces, strictly related to the dimensionality of the\nnear-contact zone between electrodes.\n", "  The so-called Weyl transform is a linear map from a commutative algebra of\nfunctions to a noncommutative algebra of linear operators, characterized by an\naction on Cartesian coordinate functions of the form $(x, y) \\mapsto (X, Y)$\nsuch that $XY -YX = i\\epsilon I$, i.e. the defining relation for the Heisenberg\nLie algebra. Study of this transform has been expansive. We summarize many\nimportant results from the literature. The primary goal of this work is to\nprove the final result: the realization of the polar transformation $(\\rho,\ne^{i\\theta}) \\mapsto (R, e^{i\\Theta})$ in terms of explicit orthogonal function\nexpansions, while starting from elementary principles and utilizing minimal\nmachinery. Our results are not strictly original but their presentation here is\nintended to simplify introduction to these subjects in a novel manner.\n", "  Thermal fluctuations in cell membranes manifest as an excess area (${\\cal\nA}_{\\rm ex}$) which governs a multitude of physical process at the sub-micron\nscale. We present a theoretical framework, based on an in silico tether pulling\nmethod, which may be used to reliably estimate ${\\cal A}_{\\rm ex}$ in live\ncells. The tether forces estimated from our simulations compare well with our\nexperimental measurements for tethers extracted from ruptured GUVs and HeLa\ncells. We demonstrate the significance and validity of our method by showing\nthat all our calculations along with experiments of tether extraction in 15\ndifferent cell types collapse onto two unified scaling relationships mapping\ntether force, tether radius, bending stiffness $\\kappa$, and membrane tension\n$\\sigma$. We show that $R_{\\rm bead}$, the size of the wetting region, is an\nimportant determinant of the radius of the extracted tether, which is equal to\n$\\xi=\\sqrt{\\kappa/2\\sigma}$ (a characteristic length scale of the membrane) for\n$R_{\\rm bead}<\\xi$, and is equal to $R_{\\rm bead}$ for $R_{\\rm bead}>\\xi$. We\nalso find that the estimated excess area follows a linear scaling behavior that\nonly depends on the true value of ${\\cal A}_{\\rm ex}$ for the membrane, based\non which we propose a self-consistent technique to estimate the range of excess\nmembrane areas in a cell.\n", "  I introduce a new parametrization of a bosonic Lax operator for the algebraic\nBethe ansatz method with the $gl(2)$-invariant $R$-matrix and use it to present\nthe exact solution of a generalized two-sites Bose-Hubbard model with\nasymmetric tunnelling. In the no interaction limit I show that the Bethe ansatz\nequations can be written as a $S^{N-1}$ sphere, where $N$ is the total number\nof atoms in the condensate.\n", "  In this paper, a thermal cascaded lattice Boltzmann method (TCLBM) is\ndeveloped in combination with the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach.\nA density distribution function relaxed by the cascaded scheme is employed to\nsolve the flow field, and a total energy distribution function relaxed by the\nBGK scheme is used to solve temperature field, where two distribution functions\nare coupled naturally. The forcing terms are incorporated by means of central\nmoments, which is consistent with the previous force scheme [Premnath \\emph{et\nal.}, Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{80}, 036702 (2009)] but the derivation is more\nintelligible and the evolution process is simpler. In the method, the viscous\nheat dissipation and compression work are taken into account, the Prandtl\nnumber and specific-heat ratio are adjustable, the external force is considered\ndirectly without the Boussinesq assumption, and the low-Mach number\ncompressible flows can also be simulated. The forcing scheme is tested by\nsimulating a steady Taylor-Green flow, and the new TCLBM is then tested by\nnumerical experiments of the thermal Couette flow, low-Mach number shock tube\nproblem, and Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection. The simulation results agree well\nwith the analytical solutions and/or results given by previous researchers.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to implement the contact\nangle boundary condition on immersed surfaces for phase-field simulations of\ntwo-phase flows using the Cahn-Hilliard equation on a Cartesian mesh. This\nsimple and effective method was inspired by previous works on the geometric\nformulation of the wetting boundary condition. In two dimensions, by making\nfull use of the hyperbolic tangent profile of the order parameter, we were able\nto obtain its unknown value at a ghost point from the information at only one\npoint in the fluid. This is in contrast with previous approaches using\ninterpolations involving several points. The special feature allows this method\nto be easily implemented on immersed surfaces (including curved ones) that cut\nthrough the grid lines. It is verified through the study of two examples: (1)\nthe shape of a drop on a circular cylinder with different contact angles; (2)\nthe spreading of a drop on an embedded inclined wall with a given contact\nangle.\n", "  In [HLY1], Hosono, Lian, and Yau posed a conjecture characterizing the set of\nsolutions to certain Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky hypergeometric equations which\nare realized as periods of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in a Gorenstein Fano toric\nvariety $X$. We prove this conjecture in the case where $X$ is a complex\nprojective space.\n", "  We recall Dirac's early proposals to develop a description of quantum\nphenomena in terms of a non-commutative algebra in which he suggested a way to\nconstruct what he called `quantum trajectories'. Generalising these ideas, we\nshow how they are related to weak values and explore their use in the\nexperimental construction of quantum trajectories. We discuss covering spaces\nwhich play an essential role in accounting for the `wave' properties of quantum\nparticles. We briefly point out how new mathematical techniques take us beyond\nHilbert space and into a deeper structure which connects with the algebras\noriginally introduced by Born, Heisenberg and Jordan. This enables us to bring\nout the geometric aspects of quantum phenomena.\n", "  In this paper, a new earthquake location method based on the waveform\ninversion is proposed. As is known to all, the waveform misfit function is very\nsensitive to the phase shift between the synthetic waveform signal and the real\nwaveform signal. Thus, the convergence domain of the conventional waveform\nbased earthquake location methods is very small. In present study, by\nintroducing and solving a simple sub-optimization problem, we greatly expand\nthe convergence domain of the waveform based earthquake location method.\nAccording to a large number of numerical experiments, the new method expands\nthe range of convergence by several tens of times. This allows us to locate the\nearthquake accurately even from some relatively bad initial values.\n", "  The recent discoveries of ferroelectric metal and Weyl semimetal (WSM) have\nstimulated a natural question: whether these two exotic states of matter can\ncoexist in a single material or not. These two discoveries ensure us that\nphysically it is possible since both of them share the same necessary\ncondition, the broken inversion symmetry. Here, by using first-principles\ncalculations, we demonstrate that the experimentally synthesized nonmagnetic\nHgPbO$_3$ represents a unique example of such hybrid \"\\emph{Weyl ferroelectric\nsemimetal}\". Its centrosymmetric $R\\bar{3}c$ phase will undergo a ferroelectric\nphase transition to the ferroelectric $R3c$ structure. Both phases are metallic\nand the ferroelectric phase owns a spontaneous polarization of 33\n$\\mu$C/cm$^2$. Most importantly, it also harbors six pairs of chiral Weyl nodes\naround the Fermi level to be an oxide WSM. The structural symmetry broken phase\ntransition induces a topological phase transition. The coexistence of\nferroelectricity and Weyl nodes in HgPbO$_3$ is an ideal platform for exploring\nmultiphase interaction and mutual control. The Weyl nodes can be tuned by\nexternal pulse electric field, which is promising for potential applications of\nintegrated topotronic and ferroelectric devices.\n", "  Biomimetic hydrogels based on natural polymers are a promising class of\nbiomaterial, mimicking the natural extra-cellular matrix of biological tissues\nand providing cues for cell attachment, proliferation and differentiation. With\na view to providing an upstream method to guide subsequent experimental design,\nthe aim of this study was to introduce a mathematical model that described the\nrheological properties of a hydrogel system based on covalently crosslinked\ncollagen triple helices. In light of their organization, such gels exhibit\nlimited collagen bundling that cannot be described by existing fibril network\nmodels. The model presented here treats collagen triple helices as discrete\nsemi-flexible polymers, permits full access to metrics for network\nmicrostructure, and should provide a comprehensive understanding of the\nparameter space associated with the development of such multi-functional\nmaterials. Triple helical hydrogel networks were experimentally obtained via\nreaction of type I collagen with both aromatic and aliphatic diacids. The\ncomplex modulus G* was found from rheological testing in linear shear and\nquantitatively compared to model predictions. In silico data from the\ncomputational model successfully described the experimental trends in hydrogel\nstorage modulus with either (i) the concentration of collagen triple helices\nduring crosslinking reaction or (ii) the type of crosslinking segment\nintroduced in resulting hydrogel networks. This approach may pave the way to a\nstep change in the rational design of biomimetic triple helical collagen\nsystems with controlled multi-functionality.\n", "  Self-assembling peptides (SAPs) have shown to offer great promise in\ntherapeutics and have the ability to undergo self-assembly and form ordered\nnanostructures. However SAP gels are often associated with inherent weak and\ntransient mechanical properties and incorporation of them into polymeric\nmatrices is a route to enhance their mechanical stability. The aim of this work\nwas to incorporate P11-8 peptide (CH3COQQRFOWOFEQQNH2) within\npoly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous webs via one-step electrospinning,\naiming to establish the underlying relationships between spinning process,\nmolecular peptide conformation, and material internal architecture.\nElectrospinning of PCL solutions (6% w/w) in hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)\ncontaining up to 40 mg/ml P11-8 resulted in the formation of fibres in both\nnano- (10-100 nm) and submicron range (100-700 nm), in contrast to PCL only\nwebs, which displayed a predominantly submicron fibre distribution. FTIR and CD\nspectroscopy on both PCL/peptide solutions and resulting electrospun webs\nrevealed monomeric and beta-sheet secondary conformation, respectively,\nsuggesting the occurrence of peptide self-assembly during electrospinning due\nto solvent evaporation. The peptide concentration (0 -> 40 mg/ml) was found to\nprimarily affect the internal structure of the fabric at the nano-scale, whilst\nwater as well as cell culture medium contact angles were dramatically\ndecreased. Nearly no cytotoxic response (> 90% cell viability) was observed\nwhen L929 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in contact with electrospun peptide\nloaded samples. This novel nanofibrous architecture may be the basis for an\ninteresting material platform for e.g. hard tissue repair, in light of the\npresence of the self assembled P11-8 in the PCL fibrous structure.\n", "  The present short note is simply intended to communicate that I have\nanalytically diagonalized the Bogoliubov truncated Hamiltonian\n$H_c$~\\cite{Bogo1,Bogo2}, in an interacting bosonic gas. This is the natural\nprosecution of my work~\\cite{MS}, now denoted as (I), where the diagonalization\nwas performed only in the subspace corresponding to zero momentum collective\nexcitations (CE).\n", "  Hydrogen can be stored in containers or in materials. In materials it can\nexist in molecular or atomic forms. The atomic form can further exist as\nmultiple phases. Molecular hydrogen can be adsorbed on the surface or can be\npresent inside the material. In the current work, we demonstrate for the first\ntime, a methodology to store hydrogen in nearly all conceivable forms. At the\nheart of this strategy is the novel concept of storage of molecular hydrogen in\nmetal Pd nanocontainers. The existence of multiple phases of hydrogen is\nconfirmed by x ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance\nand pressure-composition isotherm measurements. Enhancement in storage capacity\nas compared to nanocrystals of the same mass is observed (36 percent increase\nat 1 atm and 25C). About 18 percent of the hydrogen stored is in the molecular\nform and interestingly this is achieved at room temperature and 1 atm pressure.\n", "  We calculate accurate eigenvalues of the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the\npotential $V(r)=V_{0}r^{\\alpha}$, $\\alpha \\geq -1$, $V_{0}\\alpha >0$. We resort\nto the Riccati-Pad\\'e method that is based on a rational approximation to the\nlogarithmic derivative of the wavefunction. This approach applies when $\\alpha\n$ is a rational number.\n", "  We consider a Weyl semimetal with two nodes and derive the scattering\nHamiltonian in the presence of a boundary at $z=0$. We compute the\nphotoemission spectrum and demonstrate the presence of the Fermi arcs which\nconnect the two nodes. In the presence of an electric field parallel to the\nscattering surface we observe the one dimensional chiral anomaly.\n", "  Classical Be stars are introduced as object class and their particular\npotential for space based photometry is highlighted. A brief summary of the\nvarious types of variability observed in Be stars makes clear that an\ninterpretation of every single frequency as a pulsation mode falls short,\ninstead there are as well purely circumstellar variations and those that\noriginate in the immediate stellar to circumstellar interaction region. In\nparticular the latter offer great potential, as they are linked to one of the\nfew remaining great riddles of Be stars, namely how they feed their disks.\n", "  $3+1$ formulations of the Einstein field equations have become an invaluable\ntool in Numerical relativity, having been used successfully in modeling\nspacetimes of black hole collisions, stellar collapse and other complex\nsystems. It is plausible that similar considerations could prove fruitful for\nmodified gravity theories. In this article, we pursue from a numerical\nrelativistic viewpoint the $3+1$ formulation of metric $f(R)$ gravity as it\narises from the fourth order equations of motion, without invoking the\ndynamical equivalence with Brans-Dicke theories. We present the resulting\nsystem of evolution and constraint equations for a generic function $f(R)$,\nsubject to the usual viability conditions. We confirm that the time propagation\nof the $f(R)$ Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints take the same Mathematical\nform as in general relativity, irrespective of the $f(R)$ model. We further\nrecast the 3+1 system in a form akin to the BSSNOK formulation of numerical\nrelativity. Without assuming any specific model, we show that the ADM version\nof $f(R)$ is weakly hyperbolic and is plagued by similar zero speed modes as in\nthe general relativity case. On the other hand the BSSNOK version is strongly\nhyperbolic and hence a promising formulation for numerical simulations in\nmetric $f(R)$ theories.\n", "  Using population synthesis, we study a double-degenerate (DD) scenario for\nSNe Ia, aiming to estimate the maximum possible contribution to the rate of SNe\nfrom this scenario and the dependence of the delay-time distribution (DTD) on\nit. We make an extreme assumption that all mergers of super-Chandrasekhar pairs\nof CO white dwarfs (WDs) and mergers of CO WDs more massive than 0.47 $M_\\odot$\nwith hybrid or helium WDs more massive than 0.37$M_\\odot$ produce SNe Ia. The\nmodels are parametrized by the product of the common envelope efficiency and\nthe parameter of binding energy of stellar envelopes $\\alpha_{ce}\\lambda$,\nwhich we vary between 0.25 and 2. The best agreement with observations is\nobtained for $\\alpha_{ce}\\lambda$=2. A substantial contribution to the rate of\nSNe Ia is provided by the pairs with a hybrid WD. The estimated Galactic rate\nof SNe Ia is $6.5 10^{-3}$ per yr (for the mass of the bulge and thin disk\nequal to $7.2 10^{10} M_\\odot$), which is comparable to the observational\nestimate $(5.4\\pm0.12) 10^{-3}$ per yr. The model DTD for 1 to 8 Gyr range\nsatisfactorily fits DTD for SNe Ia in the field galaxies (Maoz et al. 2012).\nFor this epoch, model DTD is a power low with an index -1.64. At earlier and\nlater epochs our DTD has a deficit of events, as in other studies. Marginal\nagreement with observational DTD is achieved even if only CO+CO WD with\n$M_1\\geq0.8\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_2\\geq0.6\\,M_\\odot$ produce SNe Ia. A better\nagreement of observed and model DTD may be obtained if tidal effects are weaker\nthan assumed and/or metallicity of population is much lower than solar.\n", "  We expand the definition of our recently proposed proton conduction\nmechanism, the packed-acid mechanism, which occurs under conditions of\nconcentrated proton donors. The original definition stated that acid-acid\ninteractions, which help overcome the barrier of the rate-determining step,\noccur only when a hydrogen bond is formed directly between proton donors. Here,\nit is shown that proton donors can interact with each other even when the\ndonors are separated via several H-bonds. The effect of these interactions on\nproton diffusivity is confirmed by ab initio calculations.\n", "  The light emitted from the stellar photosphere serves as a unique signature\nfor the nature of stars. The behaviour of these stellar lines depend upon the\nsurface temperature, mass, evolutionary status and chemical composition of the\nstar. With the advent of high-resolution spectrographs coupled with medium to\nlarge aperture telescopes around the globe, there is plenty of high-resolution\nand high signal-to-noise ratio data available to the astronomy community. Apart\nfrom radial velocity (RV) studies, such data offer us the unique opportunity to\nstudy chemical composition and atmospheric properties of the star. The\nprocedure used to derive these parameters must be automated and well adaptable\nto data available from any high-resolution spectrograph. We hereby present an\nIDL code, PARAS SPEC, which was primary designed to handle high-resolution\nspectroscopy data from PARAS spectrograph coupled with the 1.2~m telescope at\nMt. Abu, India. This code is designed to adapt with data from other\nspectrographs as well. The code PARAS SPEC estimates the stellar atmospheric\nparameters from the analysis of stellar spectra based on two primary methods,\nsynthetic spectral fitting and equivalent width method. Synthetic spectral\nfitting method involves fitting of the observed spectrum with different\nsynthetic spectra for a set of stellar parameters. The second method is based\non equivalent widths (EWs) that are used to derive abundances for a set of Fe~I\nand Fe~II lines from the observed spectra. The detailed methodology used to\ndesign this code and comparison of the results from literature values are\npresented in this paper.\n", "  We construct the tripartite Bell-type inequalities of product states for\nl1-norm of coherence, relative entropy of coherence and skew information. Some\nthree-qubit entangled states violate these inequalities. Particulary, the\ntripartite Bell-type inequality for relative entropy of coherence is always\nviolated by the W class pure or mixed states as well as the GHZ class pure or\nmixed states, being used as entanglement witness.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the long-time behavior of solutions for the\nthree dimensional viscous primitive equations of large-scale moist atmosphere.\nWe prove the existence of a global attractor for the three dimensional viscous\nprimitive equations of large-scale moist atmosphere by asymptotic a priori\nestimate and construct an exponential attractor by using the smoothing property\nof the semigroup generated by the three dimensional viscous primitive equations\nof large-scale moist atmosphere. As a byproduct, we obtain the fractal\ndimension of the global attractor for the semigroup generated by the three\ndimensional viscous primitive equations of large-scale moist atmosphere is\nfinite, which is in consistent with the results in \\cite{jn2,jn1}.\n", "  Families of one-point interactions are derived from the system consisting of\nregularized two- and three-delta potentials using different paths of the\nconvergence of corresponding transmission matrices in the squeezing limit. This\nlimit is controlled by the relative rate of shrinking the width of delta-like\nfunctions and the distance between these functions using the power\nparameterization: width $l =\\varepsilon^{\\mu -1}$, $\\mu \\in [2,\\, \\infty]$ (for\nwidth) and $r = \\varepsilon^\\tau$, $\\tau \\in [1,\\, \\infty]$ (for distance). It\nis shown that at some values of real coefficients (intensities $a_1$, $a_2$ and\n$a_3$) at the delta potentials, the transmission across the limit point\ninteractions is non-zero, whereas outside these (resonance) values the\none-point interactions are opaque splitting the system at the point of\nsingularity into two independent subsystems. The resonance sets of intensities\nat which a non-zero transmission occurs are proved to be of four types\ndepending on the way of squeezing the regularized system to one point. In its\nturn, on these sets the limit one-point interactions are observed to be either\nsingle- or multiple-resonant-tunnelling potentials also depending on the\nsqueezing way. In the two-delta case the resonance sets are curves on the\n$(a_1,a_2)$-plane and surfaces in the $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$-space for the three-delta\nsystem. A new phenomenon of furcation of single-valued resonance sets to\nmulti-valued ones is observed under approaching the parameter $\\mu >2$ to the\nvalue $\\mu =2$.\n", "  Generating and detecting a prescribed single-electron state is an important\nstep towards solid-state fermion optics. We propose how to generate an electron\nin a Gaussian state, using a quantum-dot pump with gigahertz operation and\nrealistic parameters. With the help of a strong magnetic field, the electron\noccupies a coherent state in the pump, insensitive to the details of\nnonadiabatic evolution. The state changes during the emission from the pump,\ngoverned by competition between the Landauer-Buttiker traversal time and the\npassage time. When the former is much shorter than the latter, the emitted\nstate is a Gaussian wave packet. The Gaussian packet can be identified by using\na dynamical potential barrier, with a resolution reaching the Heisenberg\nminimal uncertainty $\\hbar/2$.\n", "  We analyze the production rate of photons from the thermal medium above the\ndeconfinement temperature with a quark propagator obtained from a lattice QCD\nnumerical simulation. The photon-quark vertex is determined gauge-invariantly,\nso as to satisfy the Ward-Takahashi identity. The obtained photon production\nrate shows a suppression compared to perturbative results.\n", "  Oil prices above $100/barrel values have proven unaffordable for the world\neconomy, while lower prices have proven unaffordable for unconventional oil\nsources, resulting in a frantic price swing since 2007-2008. We identify and\ncombine for the first time the competing dynamics of oil price, economic growth\nand extraction costs in a single model aiming to evaluate the near-term\nconsequences of these dynamics onto forthcoming oil supply. Policies able to\ncope with the consequences of the resulting energy scenario are suggested in\nthe conclusions.\n", "  We examine observational signatures of the asymptotically de Sitter branch of\nstatic spherically symmetric Horndeski/Galileon solutions. Our analysis\nreveales that possible deviations of the photon sphere size from those of the\nGR Schwarzshild solution are vanishing compared to the resolution of modern\nradio-interferometric observations. These deviations are heavily suppressed by\nthe bounds coming from the weak-field observation. We conclude that shadow size\nwould not be a useful characteristic to distinguish the Horndeski/Galileon\nstatic spherically symmetric spacetimes in the foreseeable future.\n", "  We discuss the generalization of the classical isoperimetric inequality to\nasymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds. It has been discovered that the\nAdS/CFT correspondence in string theory requires that such an inequality hold\nin order to be internally consistent. In a particular application, to the\nsystems formed in collisions of heavy ions in particle colliders, we show how\nto formulate this inequality in terms of measurable physical quantities, the\nmagnetic field and the temperature. Experiments under way at CERN in Geneva can\nthus be said to be testing an isoperimetric inequality.\n", "  The laboratory detection of previously unobserved resonance-stabilized\nC$_9$H$_5$ and C$_9$H$_9$ radicals in the supersonic expansion of a hydrocarbon\ndischarge source is reported. The radicals are tentatively assigned as\nacetylenic-substituted cyclopentadienyl C$_9$H$_5$ and vinyl-substituted benzyl\nC$_9$H$_9$ species. They are found to feature visible absorption bands that\ncoincide with a few very weak diffuse interstellar bands toward HD183143 and\nHD204827.\n", "  Lateral interactions of oxygen adatoms derived from first-principles\ncalculations of the O-Pd(100) system had been claimed to include trio- and\nquattro terms beside pair interactions. This paper is dedicated to extend an\nearlier model for substrate strain mediated interactions between adatom pairs\nto include trio- and quattro terms. While monomers (sitting on high symmetric\nsites) are supposed to create isotropic stress on the substrate, dimers would\ncreate anisotropic stress. The requirement of mechanical equilibrium allows to\nformulate the elastic energy as a sum of pair-, trio- and quattro terms, solved\nby respective an eigenvalue problems. Resulting interactions are strongly angle\ndependent and also reflect the elastic anisotropy of the substrate. A continuum\nelastic model supports the long range character of the elastic interaction but\nshould also describe some short range features. For the elastically isotropic\ntungsten substrate a closed solution for quattro interactions is presented, for\ntrio inter cations numerical values are given.\n", "  Recently, trace distance measure of coherence has been proposed for\ncharacterizing the coherence of a given quantum state. However, it seems\ndifficult to estimate the optimal incoherent state for high dimensional states.\nAn explicit expression for the trace distance measure of coherence for a class\nof qudit states is provided. We show that the closest incoherent state to the\nclass of qudit states is just the diagonal matrix obtained from it by deleting\nall off-diagonal elements. It is also shown that the measure of coherence\ninduced by trace distance can act as a measure of coherence for this class of\nqudit states with some restrictions on the strictly incoherent operations.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss some consequences of rotation and mass loss on the\nevolved stages of massive star evolution. The physical reasons of the time\nevolution of the surface velocity are explained, and then we show how the\nlate-time evolution of massive stars are impacted in combination with the\neffects of mass loss. The most interesting result is that in some cases, a\nmassive star can have a blue-red-blue evolution, opening the possibility that\nBlue Supergiants are composed by two distinct populations of stars: one just\nleaving the main sequence and crossing the HRD for the first time, and the\nother one evolving back to the blue side of the HRD after a Red Supergiant\nphase. We discuss a few possible observational tests that can allow to\ndistinguish these two populations, and how supergiant B[e] stars fit in this\ncontext.\n", "  A wide spectrum of Peritrichous bacteria undergo considerable physiological\nchanges when they are inoculated onto nutrition-rich surfaces and exhibit a\nrapid and collective migration denoted as swarming. Thereby, the length of such\nswarmer cells and their number of flagella increases substantially. In this\narticle, we investigated the properties of individual E. coli-type swarmer\ncells confined between two parallel walls via mesoscale hydrodynamic\nsimulations, combining molecular dynamics simulations of the swarmer cell with\nthe multiparticle particle collision dynamics approach for the embedding fluid.\nE. coli-type swarmer cells are three-times longer than their planktonic counter\nparts, but their flagella density is comparable. By varying the wall\nseparation, we analyze the confinement effect on the flagella arrangement, on\nthe distribution of cells in the gap between the walls, and on the cell\ndynamics. We find only a weak dependence of confinement on the bundle structure\nand dynamics. The distribution of cells in the gap changes from a\ngeometry-dominated behavior for very narrow to fluid-dominated behavior for\nwider gaps, where cells are preferentially located in the gap center for\nnarrower gaps and stay preferentially next to one of the walls for wider gaps.\nDynamically, the cells exhibit a wide spectrum of migration behaviors,\ndepending on their flagella bundle arrangement, and ranges from straight\nswimming to wall rolling.\n", "  Dense, He-rich atmospheres of cool white dwarfs represent a challenge to the\nmodeling. This is because these atmospheres are constituted of a dense fluid in\nwhich strong multi-atomic interactions determine their physics and chemistry.\nTherefore, the ideal-gas-based description of absorption is no longer adequate,\nwhich makes the opacities of these atmospheres difficult to model. This is\nillustrated with severe problems in fitting the spectra of cool, He-rich stars.\nGood description of the infrared (IR) opacity is essential for proper\nassignment of the atmospheric parameters of these stars. Using methods of\ncomputational quantum chemistry we simulate the IR absorption of dense He/H\nmedia. We found a significant IR absorption from He atoms (He-He-He CIA\nopacity) and a strong pressure distortion of the H$_2$-He collision-induced\nabsorption (CIA). We discuss the implication of these results for\ninterpretation of the spectra of cool stars.\n", "  We solved the one-dimensional position-dependent mass Dirac equation in the\npresence of the cusp potential and reported the solutions in terms of the\nWhittaker functions. We have derived the reflection and transmission\ncoefficients by making use of the matching conditions on the wave functions.\nThe effect of position dependent mass on the reflection and transmission\ncoefficients of the system is duly investigated.\n", "  The consequences for direct reactions of the dynamical non-locality generated\nby the excitation of the target and projectile are much less studied than the\neffects of non-locality arising from exchange processes. Here we are concerned\nwith the dynamical non-locality due to projectile excitation in deuteron\ninduced reactions. The consequences of this non-locality can be studied by the\ncomparison of deuteron induced direct reactions calculated with alternative\nrepresentations of the elastic channel wave functions: (i) the elastic channel\nwave functions from coupled channel (CC) calculations involving specific\nreaction processes, and, (ii) elastic channel wave functions calculated from\nlocal potentials that exactly reproduce the elastic scattering $S$-matrix from\nthe same CC calculations. In this work we produce the local equivalent deuteron\npotentials required for the study of direct reactions involving deuterons.\nThese will enable the study of the effects of dynamical non-locality following\na method previously employed in an investigation of the effects of non-locality\ndue to target excitation. In this work we consider only excitations due to\ndeuteron breakup, and some new properties of the breakup dynamical polarization\npotential (DPP) emerge that reveal dynamical non-locality directly. In\naddition, we evaluate the TELP inversion method and find that it fails to\nreproduce some features of the DPP due to breakup.\n", "  The accurate spatial location of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is crucial for both\nproducing a detector response matrix (DRM) and follow-up observations by other\ninstruments. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of\nview (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a\nnon-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each\nof its 14 detectors to localize transients. Improving its ability to accurately\nlocate GRBs and other transients is vital to the paradigm of multi-messenger\nastronomy, including the electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave\nsignals. Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs ({\\tt\nBALROG}) method for localizing and characterising GBM transients. Our approach\neliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for\nthe location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the\nuncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and\nproduces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and\nthose for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position. While\ncomputationally expensive, {\\tt BALROG} can be implemented to enable quick\nfollow-up of all GBM transient signals. Also, we identify possible response\nproblems that require attention as well as caution when using standard, public\nGBM DRMs. Finally, we examine the effects of including the variance in location\non the spectral parameters of GRB 080916C. We find that spectral parameters\nchange and no extra components are required when these effects are included in\ncontrast to when we use a fixed location. This finding has the potential to\nalter both the GRB spectral catalogs as well as the reported spectral\ncomposition of some well-known GRBs.\n", "  One of the most important questions in game theory concerns how mutual\ncooperation can be achieved and maintained in a social dilemma. In Axelrod's\ntournaments of the iterated prisoner's dilemma, Tit-for-Tat (TFT) demonstrated\nthe role of reciprocity in the emergence of cooperation. However, the stability\nof TFT does not hold in the presence of implementation error, and a TFT\npopulation is prone to neutral drift to unconditional cooperation, which\neventually invites defectors. We argue that a combination of TFT and anti-TFT\n(ATFT) overcomes these difficulties in a noisy environment, provided that ATFT\nis defined as choosing the opposite to the opponent's last move. According to\nthis TFT-ATFT strategy, a player normally uses TFT; turns to ATFT upon\nrecognizing his or her own error; returns to TFT either when mutual cooperation\nis recovered or when the opponent unilaterally defects twice in a row. The\nproposed strategy provides simple and deterministic behavioral rules for\ncorrecting implementation error in a way that cannot be exploited by the\nopponent, and suppresses the neutral drift to unconditional cooperation.\n", "  We discuss chiral symmetry restoration and eigenmode localisation in\nfinite-temperature QCD by looking at the lattice Dirac operator as a random\nHamiltonian. We argue that the features of QCD relevant to both phenomena are\nthe presence of order in the Polyakov line configuration, and the correlations\nthat this induces between spatial links across time slices. This ties the fate\nof chiral symmetry and of localisation of the lowest Dirac eigenmodes to the\nconfining properties of the theory. We then show numerical results obtained in\na QCD-inspired Anderson-like toy model, derived by radically simplifying the\nQCD dynamics while keeping the important features mentioned above. The toy\nmodel reproduces all the important qualitative aspects of chiral symmetry\nbreaking and localisation in QCD, thus supporting the central role played by\nthe confinement/deconfinement transition in triggering both phenomena.\n", "  We report the influence of the In mole fraction on the material and\nelectrical characteristics of p-i-n InxGa1-xN homojunctions (x = 0.10-0.40)\nsynthesized by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy on GaN-on-sapphire\nsubstrates. Junctions terminated with p-InGaN present improved carrier\nextraction efficiency in comparison with devices capped with p-GaN, due to the\ndeleterious effect of polarization discontinuities on the device performance.\nWe demonstrate that the presence of Mg does not perturb the In incorporation in\nInGaN, and it leads to a significant reduction of the stacking fault density.\np-In0.3Ga0.7N layers with a hole concentration of 3.2x1018 cm-3 are\ndemonstrated. InGaN homojunction devices show a peak EQE = 14+-2% in the\nblue-to-orange spectral region, and an extended cutoff to 600 nm.\n", "  Taking into account microscopic properties of most usual high-$T_{c}$\nsuperconductors, like cuprates, we define a class of microscopic model\nHamiltonians for two fermions (electrons or holes) and one boson (bipolaron) on\nthe two-dimensional square lattice. We establish that these model Hamiltonians\ncan show d-wave paring at the bottom of their spectrum, despite their space\nisotropy. This phenomenon appear when a \"giant electron-phonon anomaly\" is\npresent at the boundaries of the Brillouin zone (\"half breathing\"\nbond-stretching mode), like in doped cuprates. Our results can be used to\nderive effective electron-electron interactions mediated by bipolarons and we\ndiscuss regimes where the corresponding model is relevant for the physics of\nhigh-temperature superconductivity and can be mathematically rigorously\nstudied.\n", "  At zero temperature the negative-parity ground states of the nucleon and\ndelta baryons are non-degenerate with the positive-parity partners due to\nspontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. However, chiral symmetry is expected\nto be restored at sufficiently high temperature, in particular when going from\nthe hadronic to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase. This would imply that\nchannels with opposite parity become degenerate. We study the nucleon (spin\n$1/2$) and $\\Delta$ (spin $3/2$) baryons in both parity sectors using lattice\nQCD. The range of temperatures spans both the hadronic and QGP phases. Using\nthe FASTSUM anisotropic $N_f = 2 + 1$ ensembles, we analyze the correlation\nfunctions and the spectral functions using respectively exponential fits and\nthe Maximum Entropy Method. We find clear evidence of in-medium effects in the\nhadronic phase, especially for the negative-parity ground state, and of parity\ndoubling in the QGP phase.\n", "  Perturbation Theory to Large Scale Structure Cosmology proposes corrections\nto the linearly evolved density contrast and velocity in terms of a series\ndevelopment in which all terms are integrals of powers of the linear density\ncontrast multiplied by kernels. We discuss the symmetry properties of these\nkernels and show that their full symmetrized versions can be decomposed in\ndifferent classes of subkernels. We will construct classes of subkernels with\nimproved symmetry properties, and provide recurrence relations to generate\nthem.\n", "  Multiple ultrasound elastography techniques rely on acoustic radiation force\n(ARF) in monitoring high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. However,\nARF is dependent on tissue attenuation and sound speed, both of which are also\nknown to change with temperature making the therapy monitoring more\nchallenging. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of tissue are also\ntemperature dependent, which affects the displacements induced by ARF. The aim\nof this study is to quantify the temperature dependent changes in the acoustic\nand viscoelastic properties of liver and investigate their effect on ARF\ninduced displacements by using both experimental methods and simulations.\nFurthermore, the temperature dependent viscoelastic properties of liver are\nexperimentally measured over a frequency range of 0.1-200 Hz at temperatures\nreaching 80 C, and both conventional and fractional Zener models are used to\nfit the data.\n  The fractional Zener model was found to fit better with the experimental\nviscoelasticity data with respect to the conventional model with up to two\nmagnitudes lower sum of squared errors (SSE). The characteristics of\nexperimental displacement data were also seen in the simulations due to the\nchanges in attenuation coefficient and lesion development. At low temperatures\nbefore thermal ablation, attenuation was found to affect the displacement\namplitude. At higher temperature, the decrease in displacement amplitude occurs\napproximately at 60-70 C due to the combined effect of viscoelasticity changes\nand lesion growth overpowering the effect of attenuation. The results suggest\nthat it is necessary to monitor displacement continuously during HIFU therapy\nin order to ascertain when ablation occurs.\n", "  We show that the~braneworld rotating Kerr--Newman black hole and naked\nsingularity spacetimes with both positive and negative braneworld tidal charge\nparameter can be separated into fourteen classes according to properties of\ncircular geodesics governing the~Keplerian accretion. We determine efficiency\nof the~Keplerian accretion disks for all braneworld Kerr--Newman spacetimes. We\ndemonstrate occurrence of an~infinitely deep gravitational potential in\nKerr--Newman naked singularity spacetimes having the~braneworld dimensionless\ntidal charge $b \\in (1/4,1)$ and the~dimensionless spin $a \\in\n(2\\sqrt{b}-\\sqrt{b(4b-1)},2\\sqrt{b}+\\sqrt{b(4b-1)})$, implying unbound\nefficiency of the~Keplerian accretion and possibility to extract the~whole\nnaked singularity mass. Therefore, we call them braneworld \"mining-unstable\"\nKerr--Newman naked singularity spacetimes. Fundamental restriction on\nthe~relevance of the~extraordinary but fully classical phenomenon of the~mining\ninstability is given by validity of the~assumption of geodesic motion of\nthe~accreting matter.\n", "  Summer 2015 marked the 100th anniversary of the excavation by J.W. Fewkes of\nthe Sun Temple in Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado; an ancient ceremonial\ncomplex of unknown purpose, prominently located atop a mesa, constructed by the\nPueblo Indians approximately 1000 years ago. In this analysis we perform a\ndigital survey of the site, and examine the possibility that four key\ntower-like elements of the complex were used for observation of the rise or set\nof celestial bodies known to be sacred to the Pueblo Indians.\n  We find statistically significant evidence that the site was used for\nastronomical observation of the rise and/or set of nearly all such bodies. The\nSun Temple appears to represent the most comprehensive prehistoric astronomical\nobservatory yet uncovered.\n", "  Scalar cosmological perturbations in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) is\nrevisited in a covariant manner, using self dual Ashtekar variables. For\nreal-valued Ashtekar-Barbero variables, this `deformed algebra' approach has\nbeen shown to implement holonomy corrections from loop quantum gravity (LQG) in\na consistent manner, albeit deforming the algebra of modified constraints in\nthe process. This deformation has serious conceptual ramifications, not the\nleast of them being an effective `signature-change' in the deep quantum regime.\nIn this paper, we show that working with self dual variables lead to an\nundeformed algebra of hypersurface deformations, even after including holonomy\ncorrections in the effective constraints. As a necessary consequence, the\ndiffeomorphism constraint picks up non-perturbative quantum corrections thus\nhinting at a modification of the underlying space-time structure, a novel\ningredient compared to the usual treatment of (spatial) diffeomorphisms in LQG.\nThis work extends a similar result obtained in the context of spherically\nsymmetric gravity coupled to a scalar field, suggesting that self dual\nvariables could be better suited than their real counterparts to treat\ninhomogeneous LQG models.\n", "  We aimed at collecting all known white dwarf pulsators with\nhydrogen-dominated atmospheres and list their main photometric and atmospheric\nparameters together with their pulsation periods and amplitudes observed at\ndifferent epochs. For this purpose, we explored the pulsating white dwarf\nrelated literature with the systematic use of the SIMBAD and the NASA's\nAstrophysics Data System (ADS) databases. We summarized our results in four\ntables listing seven ZZ Ceti stars in detached white dwarf plus main-sequence\nbinaries, seven extremely low-mass DA pulsators, three hot DAVs and 180 ZZ Ceti\nstars.\n", "  We study effects originating from the strong spin orbit coupling in CoFeB/MgO\nheterostructures with heavy metal (HM) underlayers. The perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy at the CoFeB/MgO interface, the spin Hall angle of the heavy metal\nlayer, current induced torques and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the\nHM/CoFeB interfaces are studied for films in which the early 5d transition\nmetals are used as the HM underlayer. We show how the choice of the HM layer\ninfluences these intricate spin orbit effects that emerge within the bulk and\nat interfaces of the heterostructures.\n", "  The two most powerful optical/IR telescopes in history -- NASA's Hubble and\nJames Webb Space Telescopes -- will be in space at the same time. We have a\nunique opportunity to leverage the 1.5 million kilometer separation between the\ntwo telescopic nodal points to obtain simultaneously captured stereoscopic\nimages of asteroids, comets, moons and planets in our Solar System. Given the\nrecent resurgence in stereo-3D movies and the recent emergence of VR-enabled\nmobile devices, these stereoscopic images provide a unique opportunity to\nengage the public with unprecedented views of various Solar System objects.\nHere, we present the technical requirements for acquiring stereoscopic images\nof Solar System objects, given the constraints of the telescopic equipment and\nthe orbits of the target objects, and we present a handful of examples.\n", "  We review the current status of vector boson fusion and vector boson\nscattering studies in the frame of Run-2 of LHC. These processes are equally\ninteresting and challenging, and new ideas have to be applied for their\nexperimental analysis. These channels are optimal for the search of new\nphysics, and therefore we discuss two promising techniques for this purpose:\nstandard model effective field theory and pseudo observables. Regarding their\nimplementation in the analyses, we also discuss briefly how these techniques\nshould be included in the Monte Carlo generators.\n", "  A strategy is developed for generating equilibrated high molecular-weight\npolymer melts described with microscopic detail by sequentially backmapping\ncoarse-grained (CG) configurations. The microscopic test model is generic but\nretains features like hard excluded volume interactions and realistic melt\ndensities. The microscopic representation is mapped onto a model of soft\nspheres with fluctuating size, where each sphere represents a microscopic\nsubchain with $N_{\\rm b}$ monomers. By varying $N_{\\rm b}$ a hierarchy of CG\nrepresentations at different resolutions is obtained. Within this hierarchy, CG\nconfigurations equilibrated with Monte Carlo at low resolution are sequentially\nfine-grained into CG melts described with higher resolution. A Molecular\nDynamics scheme is employed to slowly introduce the microscopic details into\nthe latter. All backmapping steps involve only local polymer relaxation thus\nthe computational efficiency of the scheme is independent of molecular weight,\nbeing just proportional to system size. To demonstrate the robustness of the\napproach, microscopic configurations containing up to $n=1000$ chains with\npolymerization degrees $N=2000$ are generated and equilibration is confirmed by\nmonitoring key structural and conformational properties. The extension to much\nlonger chains or branched polymers is straightforward.\n", "  Mesoscale behavior of polymers is frequently described by universal laws.\nThis physical property motivates us to propose a new modeling concept, grouping\npolymers into classes with a common long-wavelength representation. In the same\nclass samples of different materials can be generated from this representation,\nencoded in a single library system. We focus on homopolymer melts, grouped\naccording to the invariant degree of polymerization. They are described with a\nbead-spring model, varying chain stiffness and density to mimic chemical\ndiversity. In a renormalization group-like fashion library samples provide a\nuniversal blob-based description, hierarchically backmapped to create\nconfigurations of other class-members. Thus large systems with\nexperimentally-relevant invariant degree of polymerizations (so far accessible\nonly on very coarse-grained level) can be microscopically described.\nEquilibration is verified comparing conformations and melt structure with\nsmaller scale conventional simulations.\n", "  Some gaps in the mosaic of binary star evolution have recently been filled by\nthe discoveries of helium-core white dwarf progenitors (often called extremely\nlow mass (ELM) white dwarfs) as stripped cores of first-giant branch objects.\nTwo varieties can be distinguished. One class is made up by SB1 binaries,\ncompanions being white dwarfs as well, another class, the so-called EL CVn\nstars, are composite spectrum binaries, with A-Type companions. Pulsating stars\nare found among both classes. A riddle is posed by the apparently single\nobjects. There is a one-to-one correspondence of the phenomena found for these\nnew classes of star to those observed for sdB stars. In fact, standard\nevolutionary scenarios explain the origin of sdB stars as red giants that have\nbeen stripped close to the tip of first red giant branch. A subgroup of\nsubluminous B stars can also be identified as stripped helium-cores of red\ngiants. They form an extension of the ELM sequence to higher temperatures.\nHence low mass white dwarfs of helium cores and sdB stars in binaries are close\nrelatives in terms of stellar evolution.\n", "  Keller and Wadsley (2016) have smugly suggested, recently, that the end of\nMOND may be in view. This is based on their claim that their highly-restricted\nsample of $\\Lambda$CDM-simulated galaxies are \"consistent\" with the observed\nMOND mass-discrepancy-acceleration relation (MDAR), in particular, with its\nrecent update by McGaugh et al. (2016), based on the SPARC sample. From this\nthey extrapolate to \"$\\Lambda$CDM is fully consistent\" with the MDAR. I explain\nwhy these simulated galaxies do not show that $\\Lambda$CDM accounts for the\nMDAR. a. Their sample of simulated galaxies contains only 18 high-mass\ngalaxies, within a narrow range of one order of magnitude in baryonic mass, at\nthe very high end of the observed, SPARC sample, which spans 4.5 orders of\nmagnitude in mass. More importantly, the simulated sample has none of the\nlow-mass, low-acceleration galaxies -- abundant in SPARC -- which encapsulate\nthe crux and the nontrivial aspects of the predicted and observed MDAR. The\nlow-acceleration part of the simulated MDAR is achieved, rather trivially, from\nthe flattish-velocity-curve regions of the simulated high-mass galaxies. b.\nHalf of the simulated galaxies have \"wrong\" rotation curves that differ greatly\nfrom any observed ones. This, does not prevent these wrong galaxies from lying\non the observed MDAR (for trivial reasons, again). They, in fact, define the\nhigh-acceleration branch of the simulated MDAR. c. To boot, even if\n$\\Lambda$CDM were made \"consistent\" with the MDAR through the elaborate\nadjustments that the simulations allow, this would not obviate MOND, which\npredicts much more than the MDAR.\n", "  The three dimensional vibrations in a periodically poled ZX-cut Lithium\nNiobate thin bar with 0.3-mm long domains are considered. The acoustical\nvibrations may be excited by the 1) longitudinal acousto-electric current when\na radio frequency voltage is parallel to the x-axis, and 2) transverse electric\nfield when a radio frequency voltage is parallel to the z-axis. The\ncomputations by the Final Element Method reveal all the three displacements\nalong the x, y, and z crystallographic axes. The amplitudes may be different\nfor two types of vibration excitations. The positions of peaks in admittance\nversus frequency correlate with the frequencies of maximum acoustic amplitudes.\nThe superlattice with 0.3-mm long domains along the x-axis is fabricated in the\nz-cut 0.5-mm-thick wafer. The experimental data on the radio frequency\nadmittance versus frequency is in agreement with the corresponding theoretical\ncomputations.\n", "  We work with a UV conformal U(1)' extension of the Standard Model, motivated\nby the hierarchy problem and recent collider anomalies. This model admits\nfermionic vector portal WIMP dark matter charged under the U(1)' gauge group.\nThe asymptotically safe boundary conditions can be used to fix the coupling\nparameters, which allows the observed thermal relic abundance to constrain the\nmass of the dark matter particle. This highly restricts the parameter space,\nallowing strong predictions to be made. The parameter space of several UV\nconformal U(1)' scenarios will be explored, and both bounds and possible\nsignals from direct and indirect detection observation methods will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments on DNA replication, we apply a one-dimensional\nnucleation-and-growth model to DNA-replication kinetics, focusing on how to\nextract the time-dependent nucleation rate I(t) and growth speed v from data.\nWe discuss generic experimental problems, namely spatial inhomogeneity,\nmeasurement noise, and finite-size effects. After evaluating how each of these\naffects the measurements of I(t) and v, we give guidelines for the design of\nexperiments. These ideas are then discussed in the context of the\nDNA-replication experiments.\n"]}
