The symmetric geometry provides a much lower magnetic field curvature\nper fixed length that promises longer coherence time for atom interferometers.\nA double-tape design of each coil allows a smooth translation of guided atoms\nwithout addition of an external bias field. The guide is also immune from the\ncurrent and thermal noise by virtue of the turns averaging and a large working\ndistance, respectively. We present the experimental results of guide\napplication to atom interferometry.\n", "  The Rooted Maps Theory, a branch of the Theory of Homology, is shown to be a\npowerful tool for investigating the topological properties of Feynman diagrams,\nrelated to the single particle propagator in the quantum many-body systems. The\nnumerical correspondence between the number of this class of Feynman diagrams\nas a function of perturbative order and the number of rooted maps as a function\nof the number of edges is studied. A graphical procedure to associate Feynman\ndiagrams and rooted maps is then stated. Finally, starting from rooted maps\nprinciples, an original definition of the genus of a Feynman diagram, which\ntotally differs from the usual one, is given.\n", "  Entanglement entropy obeys a 'first law', an exact quantum generalization of\nthe ordinary first law of thermodynamics. In any CFT with a semiclassical\nholographic dual, this first law has an interpretation in the dual\ngravitational theory as a constraint on the spacetimes dual to CFT states. For\nsmall perturbations around the CFT vacuum state, we show that the set of such\nconstraints for all ball-shaped spatial regions in the CFT is exactly\nequivalent to the requirement that the dual geometry satisfy the gravitational\nequations of motion, linearized about pure AdS. For theories with entanglement\nentropy computed by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula $S=A/(4G_N)$, we obtain the\nlinearized Einstein equations. For theories in which the vacuum entanglement\nentropy for a ball is computed by more general Wald functionals, we obtain the\nlinearized equations for the associated higher-curvature theories. Using the\nfirst law, we also derive the holographic dictionary for the stress tensor,\ngiven the holographic formula for entanglement entropy. This method provides a\nsimple alternative to holographic renormalization for computing the stress\ntensor expectation value in arbitrary higher derivative gravitational theories.\n", "  We demonstrate control of the differential Zeeman shift between clock states\nof ultracold rubidium atoms by means of non-resonant microwave dressing. Using\nthe dc-field dependence of the microwave detuning, we suppress the first and\nsecond order differential Zeeman shift in magnetically trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms.\nBy dressing the state pair 5S$_{1/2} F= 1, m_F = -1$ and $F= 2, m_F = 1$, a\nresidual frequency spread of <0.1 Hz in a range of 100 mG around a chosen\nmagnetic offset field can be achieved. This is one order of magnitude smaller\nthan the shift of the bare states at the magic field of the Breit-Rabi\nparabola. We further identify double magic points, around which the clock\nfrequency is insensitive to fluctuations both in the magnetic field and the\ndressing Rabi frequency. The technique is compatible with chip-based cold atom\nsystems and allows the creation of clock and qubit states with reduced\nsensitivity to magnetic field noise.\n", "  Under ideal conditions, quantum metrology promises a precision gain over\nclassical techniques scaling quadratically with the number of probe particles.\nAt the same time, no-go results have shown that generic, uncorrelated noise\nlimits the quantum advantage to a constant factor. In frequency estimation\nscenarios, however, there are exceptions to this rule and, in particular, it\nhas been found that transversal dephasing does allow for a scaling quantum\nadvantage. Yet, it has remained unclear whether such exemptions can be\nexploited in practical scenarios. Here, we argue that the transversal-noise\nmodel applies to the setting of recent magnetometry experiments and show that a\nscaling advantage can be maintained with one-axis-twisted spin-squeezed states\nand Ramsey-interferometry-like measurements. This is achieved by exploiting the\ngeometry of the setup that, as we demonstrate, has a strong influence on the\nachievable quantum enhancement for experimentally feasible parameter settings.\nWhen, in addition to the dominant transversal noise, other sources of\ndecoherence are present, the quantum advantage is asymptotically bounded by a\nconstant, but this constant may be significantly improved by exploring the\ngeometry.\n", "  The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)---a popular method for performing\ndata-driven Koopman spectral analysis---has gained increased adoption as a\ntechnique for extracting dynamically meaningful spatio-temporal descriptions of\nfluid flows from snapshot measurements. Often times, DMD descriptions can be\nused for predictive purposes as well, which enables informed decision-making\nbased on DMD model-forecasts. Despite its widespread use and utility, DMD\nregularly fails to yield accurate dynamical descriptions when the measured\nsnapshot data are imprecise due to, e.g., sensor noise. Here, we express DMD as\na two-stage algorithm in order to isolate a source of systematic error. We show\nthat DMD's first stage, a subspace projection step, systematically introduces\nbias errors by processing snapshots asymmetrically. To remove this systematic\nerror, we propose utilizing an augmented snapshot matrix in a subspace\nprojection step, as in problems of total least-squares, in order to account for\nthe error present in all snapshots. The resulting unbiased and noise-aware\ntotal DMD (TDMD) formulation reduces to standard DMD in the absence of snapshot\nerrors, while the two-stage perspective generalizes the de-biasing framework to\nother related methods as well. TDMD's performance is demonstrated in numerical\nand experimental fluids examples.\n", "  These lecture notes grew out of a series of lectures given by the second\nnamed author in short courses in Toulouse, Matsumoto, and Darmstadt. The main\naim is to explain some aspects of the theory of \"Regularity structures\"\ndeveloped recently by Hairer in arXiv:1303.5113 . This theory gives a way to\nstudy well-posedness for a class of stochastic PDEs that could not be treated\npreviously. Prominent examples include the KPZ equation as well as the dynamic\n$\\Phi^4_3$ model. Such equations can be expanded into formal perturbative\nexpansions. Roughly speaking the theory of regularity structures provides a way\nto truncate this expansion after finitely many terms and to solve a fixed point\nproblem for the \"remainder\". The key ingredient is a new notion of \"regularity\"\nwhich is based on the terms of this expansion.\n", "  Understanding the pseudo-gap phase which opens in the under-doped regime of\ncuprate superconductors is one of the most enduring challenges of the physics\nof these compounds. A depletion in the electronic density of states is\nobserved, which is gapping out part of the Fermi surface, leading to the\nformation of mysterious lines of massless excitations- the Fermi arcs. Here we\ngive a new theoretical account of the physics of the pseudo-gap phase in terms\nof the emergence of local patches of particle-hole pairs generated by SU(2)\nsymmetry fluctuations. The proliferation of these local patches accounts\nnaturally for the robustness of the pseudo-gap phase to disturbances like\ndisorder or magnetic field and is shown to gap out part fo the Fermi surface,\nleading to the formation of the Fermi arcs. Most noticeably, we show that these\npatches induce a modulated charge distribution on the Oxygen atoms, in\nremarkable agreement with recent X-ray and STM observations.\n", "  The spin and density response functions in the random phase approximation\n(RPA) are derived by linearizing the kinetic equation including a magnetic\nfield, the spin-orbit coupling, and mean fields with respect to an external\nelectric field. Different polarization functions appear describing various\nprecession motions showing Rabi satellites due to an effective Zeeman field.\nThe latter turns out to consist of the mean-field magnetization, the magnetic\nfield, and the spin-orbit vector. The collective modes for charged and neutral\nsystems are derived and a threefold splitting of the spin waves dependent on\nthe polarization and spin-orbit coupling is shown. The dielectric function\nincluding spin-orbit coupling, polarization and magnetic fields is presented\nanalytically for long wave lengths and in the static limit. The dynamical\nscreening length as well as the long-wavelength dielectric function shows an\ninstability in charge modes, which are interpreted as spin segregation and\ndomain formation. The spin response describes a crossover from damped\noscillatory behavior to exponentially damped behavior dependent on the\npolarization and collision frequency. The magnetic field causes ellipsoidal\ntrajectories of the spin response to an external electric field and the\nspin-orbit coupling causes a rotation of the spin axes. The spin-dephasing\ntimes are extracted and discussed in dependence on the polarization, magnetic\nfield, spin-orbit coupling and single-particle relaxation times.\n", "  In the present paper, we investigate the cosmographic problem using the\nbias-variance trade-off. We find that both the z-redshift and the\n$y=z/(1+z)$-redshift can present a small bias estimation. It means that the\ncosmography can describe the supernova data more accurately. Minimizing risk,\nit suggests that cosmography up to the second order is the best approximation.\nForecasting the constraint from future measurements, we find that future\nsupernova and redshift drift can significantly improve the constraint, thus\nhaving the potential to solve the cosmographic problem. We also exploit the\nvalues of cosmography on the deceleration parameter and equation of state of\ndark energy $w(z)$. We find that supernova cosmography cannot give stable\nestimations on them. However, much useful information was obtained, such as\nthat the cosmography favors a complicated dark energy with varying $w(z)$, and\nthe derivative $dw/dz<0$ for low redshift. The cosmography is helpful to model\nthe dark energy.\n", "  We derive a metric-like Lagrangian and equations of motion, in AdS space, for\nmultiplets of fermionic fields with spin ranged from 1/2 to s, from their\nframe-like formulation.\n", "  Quantum key distribution can be enhanced and extended if nonclassical\nsingle-photon states of light are used. We study a connection between the\nsecurity of quantum key distribution and quantum non-Gaussianity of light\narriving at the receiver's detection system after the propagation through a\nnoisy quantum channel, being under full control of an eavesdropper performing\ngeneral collective attacks. We show that while quantum nonclassicality\nexhibited by the light arriving at the receiver's station is a necessary\nindication of the security of the discrete-variable protocols, quantum\nnon-Gaussianity can be a sufficient indication of their security. Therefore,\nchecking for non-Gaussianity of this light by performing standard\nautocorrelation function measurement can be used for prior verification of the\nusability of prepare-and-measure schemes. It can play similar role to the prior\nverification of the quantum correlations sufficient to violate Bell\ninequalities for entanglement-based protocols.\n", "  We study the translocation of polymers across varying-section channels. Using\nsystematic approximations, we derive a simplified model that reduces the\nproblem of polymer translocation through varying-section channels to that of a\npoint-like particle under the action of an effective potential. Such a model\nallows us to identify the relevant parameters controlling the polymers dynamics\nand, in particular, their translocation time. By comparing our analytical\nresults with numerical simulations we show that, under suitable conditions, our\nmodel provides reliable predictions of the dynamics of both Gaussian and\nself-avoiding polymers, in two- and three-dimensional confinement. Moreover,\nboth theoretical predictions, as well Brownian dynamic results, show a\nnon-monotonous dependence of polymer translocation velocity as a function of\npolymer size, a feature that can be exploited for polymer separation.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD $[{\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s \\alpha^3)]$ and electroweak (EW) $[{\\cal O}(\\alpha^4)]$ corrections\nto the $WWW$ production at the LHC and deal with the subsequent leptonic decays\nfrom $W$ bosons by adopting an improved narrow-width approximation which takes\ninto account the spin correlation and finite-width effects. The NLO QCD\ncorrection from the real jet radiation is discussed, which significantly\nenhances the production rate, particularly in the high-energy region. We also\nprovide the integrated cross section for the $WWW$ production and various\nkinematic distributions of final products at the QCD+EW NLO. We find that the\nconvergence of the perturbative QCD description can be improved by applying a\nhard jet veto in the event selection, but this jet veto would introduce a new\nsource of theoretical uncertainty. The pure NLO QCD relative correction to the\nintegrated cross section for the $W^+W^-W^+$ production at the $14~{\\rm TeV}$\nLHC is on the order of $30\\%$ in the jet-veto event selection scheme with\n$p^{\\, {\\rm cut}}_{T,\\, {\\rm jet}} = 50~{\\rm GeV}$, while the genuine NLO EW\nrelative correction can reach about $15\\%$ in the inclusive event selection\nscheme. Our numerical results show that both the NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections\nshould be taken into consideration in precision predictions.\n", "  Despite the wide usage of information as a concept in science, we have yet to\ndevelop a clear & concise scientific definition. This paper is aimed at laying\nthe foundations for a new theory concerning the mechanics of information\nalongside its intimate relationship with working processes. Principally it aims\nto provide a better understanding of what information is. We find that like\nentropy, information is also a state variable, and both their values are\nsurprisingly contextual. Conversely, contrary to popular belief, we find that\ninformation is not negative entropy. However, unlike entropy, information can\nbe both positive and negative. We further find that it is possible to consider\na communications process as a working process and that Shannon's entropy is\nonly applicable to the modelling of statistical distributions. In extension, it\nappears that information could exist within any system, even thermodynamic\nsystems at equilibrium. Surprisingly, the amount of mechanical work a\nthermodynamic system can do directly relates to the appropriate corresponding\ninformation available. If the system does not have corresponding information,\nit can do no work irrespective of how much energy it may contain. Following the\ntheory we present, it will become evident to the reader that information is an\nintrinsic property which exists naturally within our universe, and not an\nabstract human notion.\n", "  Admissible structure constants related to the dual Lie superalgebras of\nparticular Lie superalgebra $({\\cal C}^3 + {\\cal A})$ are found by\nstraightforward calculations from the matrix form of super Jacobi and mixed\nsuper Jacobi identities which are obtained from adjoint representation. Then,\nby making use of the automorphism supergroup of the Lie superalgebra $({\\cal\nC}^3 + {\\cal A})$, the Lie superbialgebra structures on the Lie superalgebra\n$({\\cal C}^3 + {\\cal A})$ are obtained and classified into inequivalent 31\nfamilies. We also determine all corresponding coboundary and bi-r-matrix Lie\nsuperbialgebras. The quantum deformations associated with some Lie\nsuperbialgebras $({\\cal C}^3 + {\\cal A})$ are obtained, together with the\ncorresponding deformed Casimir elements. As an application of these quantum\ndeformations, we construct a deformed integrable Hamiltonian system from the\nrepresentation of the Hopf superalgebra ${{U}_{_\\lambda}}^{\\hspace{-1mm}({\\cal\nC}_{p=1}^{2,\\epsilon} \\oplus {\\cal A}_{1,1})}\\big(({\\cal C}^3+{\\cal A})\\big)$.\n", "  Applying the recently developed dynamical perturbation formalism on\ncosmological background to scalar-tensor theory, we provide a solid theoretical\nbasis and a rigorous justification for phenomenological models of orbital\ndynamics that are currently used to interpret experimental measurements of the\ntime-dependent gravitational constant. We derive the field equations for the\nscalar-tensor perturbations and study their gauge freedom associated with the\ncosmological expansion. We find a new gauge eliminating a prohibitive number of\ngauge modes in the field equations and significantly simplifying post-Newtonian\nequations of motion for localized astronomical systems in the universe with\ntime-dependent gravitational constant. We identify several new post-Newtonian\nterms and calculate their effect on secular cosmological evolution of the\nosculating orbital elements.\n", "  Based on the quantum kinetic equations for systems with SU(2) structure,\nregularization-free density and pseudospin currents are calculated in graphene\nrealized as the infinite mass-limit of electrons with quadratic dispersion and\na proper spin-orbit coupling. Correspondingly the currents possess no\nquasiparticle part but only anomalous parts. The intraband and interband\nconductivities are discussed with respect to magnetic fields and magnetic\ndomain puddles. It is found that the magnetic field and meanfield of domains\ncan be represented by an effective Zeeman field. For large Zeeman fields the\ndynamical conductivities become independent of the density and are universal in\nthis sense. The different limits of vanishing density, relaxation, frequency,\nand Zeeman field are not interchangeable. The optical conductivity agrees well\nwith the experimental values using screened impurity scattering and an\neffective Zeeman field. The universal value of Hall conductivity is shown to be\nmodified due to the Zeeman field. The pseudospin current reveals an anomaly\nsince a quasiparticle part appears though it vanishes for particle currents.\nThe density and pseudospin response functions to an external electric field are\ncalculated and the dielectric function is discussed with respect to collective\nexcitations. A frequency and wave-vector range is identified where the\ndielectric function changes sign and the repulsive Coulomb potential becomes\neffectively attractive allowing Cooper pairing.\n", "  We analyze a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a dark sector\ncomposed of a scalar and a fermion, both singlets under the SM gauge group but\ncharged under a dark sector symmetry group. Sterile neutrinos, which are\nsinglets under both groups, mediate the interactions between the dark sector\nand the SM particles, and generate masses for the active neutrinos via the\nseesaw mechanism. We explore the parameter space region where the observed Dark\nMatter relic abundance is determined by the annihilation into sterile\nneutrinos, both for fermion and scalar Dark Matter particles. The scalar Dark\nMatter case provides an interesting alternative to the usual Higgs portal\nscenario. We also study the constraints from direct Dark Matter searches and\nthe prospects for indirect detection via sterile neutrino decays to leptons,\nwhich may be able to rule out Dark Matter masses below and around 100 GeV.\n", "  Fractal dimension is defined on the base of entropy, including macro state\nentropy and information entropy. The generalized correlation dimension of\nmultifractals is based on Renyi entropy. However, the mathematical transform\nfrom entropy to fractal dimension is not yet clear in both theory and practice.\nThis paper is devoted to revealing the new equivalence relation between spatial\nentropy and fractal dimension using functional box-counting method. Based on\nvaried regular fractals, the numerical relationship between spatial entropy and\nfractal dimension is examined. The results show that the ratio of actual\nentropy (Mq) to the maximum entropy (Mmax) equals the ratio of actual dimension\n(Dq) to the maximum dimension (Dmax). The spatial entropy and fractal dimension\nof complex spatial systems can be converted into one another by means of\nfunctional box-counting method. The theoretical inference is verified by\nobservational data of urban form. A conclusion is that normalized spatial\nentropy is equal to normalized fractal dimension. Fractal dimensions proved to\nbe the characteristic values of entropies. In empirical studies, if the linear\nsize of spatial measurement is small enough, a normalized entropy value is\ninfinitely approximate to the corresponding normalized fractal dimension value.\nBased on the theoretical result, new spatial measurements of urban space\nfilling can be defined, and multifractal parameters can be generalized to\ndescribe both simple systems and complex systems.\n", "  Heralded near-deterministic multi-qubit controlled phase gates with\nintegrated error detection have recently been proposed by Borregaard et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 110502 (2015)]. This protocol is based on a single\nfour-level atom (a heralding quartit) and $N$ three-level atoms (operational\nqutrits) coupled to a single-resonator mode acting as a cavity bus. Here we\ngeneralize this method for two distant resonators without the cavity bus\nbetween the heralding and operational atoms. Specifically, we analyze the\ntwo-qubit controlled-Z gate and its multi-qubit-controlled generalization\n(i.e., a Toffoli-like gate) acting on the two-lowest levels of $N$ qutrits\ninside one resonator, with their successful actions being heralded by an\nauxiliary microwave-driven quartit inside the other resonator. Moreover, we\npropose a circuit-quantum-electrodynamics realization of the protocol with flux\nand phase qudits in linearly-coupled transmission-line resonators with\ndissipation. These methods offer a quadratic fidelity improvement compared to\ncavity-assisted deterministic gates.\n", "  We investigate open- and closed-loop active control for aerodynamic drag\nreduction of a car model. Turbulent flow around a blunt-edged Ahmed body is\nexamined at $Re_{H}\\approx3\\times10^{5}$ based on body height. The actuation is\nperformed with pulsed jets at all trailing edges combined with a Coanda\ndeflection surface. The flow is monitored with pressure sensors distributed at\nthe rear side. We apply a model-free control strategy building on Dracopoulos &\nKent (Neural Comput. & Applic., vol. 6, 1997, pp. 214-228) and Gautier et al.\n(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 770, 2015, pp. 442-457). The optimized control laws\ncomprise periodic forcing, multi-frequency forcing and sensor-based feedback\nincluding also time-history information feedback and combination thereof. Key\nenabler is linear genetic programming as simple and efficient framework for\nmultiple inputs (actuators) and multiple outputs (sensors). The proposed linear\ngenetic programming control can select the best open- or closed-loop control in\nan unsupervised manner. Approximately 33% base pressure recovery associated\nwith 22% drag reduction is achieved in all considered classes of control laws.\nIntriguingly, the feedback actuation emulates periodic high-frequency forcing\nby selecting one pressure sensor in the optimal control law. Our control\nstrategy is, in principle, applicable to all multiple actuators and sensors\nexperiments.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment (Sanchez-Yamagishi et.al, arXiv:1602.06815)\nreporting evidence of helical spin-polarized edge states in layer-biased\ntwisted bilayer graphene under a magnetic flux, we study the possibility of\nstabilising a Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) phase in such a system, without Zeeman or\nspin-orbit couplings, and with a QSH gap induced instead by electronic\ninteractions. We analyse how magnetic flux, electric field, interlayer rotation\nangle, and interactions (treated at a mean field level) combine to produce a\npseudo-QSH with broken time-reversal symmetry, and spin-polarized helical edge\nstates. The effect is a consequence of a robust interaction-induced\nferrimagnetic ordering of the Quantum Hall ground state under an interlayer\nbias, provided the two rotated layers are effectively decoupled at low\nenergies. We discuss in detail the electronic structure, and the constraints on\nsystem parameters, such as the angle, interactions and magnetic flux, required\nto reach the pseudo-QSH phase. We find, in particular, that purely local\nelectronic interactions are not sufficient to account for the experimental\nobservations, which demand at least nearest-neighbour interactions to be\nincluded.\n", "  We examine the stability of steady-state galileon accretion for the case of a\nSchwarzshild black hole. Considering the galileon action up to the cubic term\nin a static and spherically symmetric background we obtain the general solution\nfor the equation of motion which is divided in two branches. By perturbing this\nsolution we define an effective metric which determines the propagation of\nfluctuations. In this general picture we establish the position of the sonic\nhorizon together with the matching condition of the two branches on it.\nRestricting to the case of a Schwarzschild background, we show, via the\nanalysis of the energy of the perturbations and its time derivative, that the\naccreting field is linearly stable.\n", "  In breathing pyrochlores and kagomes, couplings between neighbouring\ntetrahedra and triangles are free to differ. Breathing lattices thus offer the\npossibility to explore a different facet of the rich physics of these systems.\nHere we consider nearest-neighbour classical Heisenberg interactions, both\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic, and study how the anisotropy of breathing\nlattices modifies the mode spectrum of pyrochlore and kagome systems. The\nnature and degeneracy of the flat bands are shown to be preserved for any value\nof the anisotropy. These flat bands can coexist with Dirac nodes at the\n$\\Gamma$ point when the model becomes particle-hole symmetric. We also derive\nthe nature of the ground state for the breathing kagome lattice, which bears a\nspontaneous chirality when neighbouring triangles are alternatively\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic.\n", "  The celebrated Sommerfeld wedge diffraction solution is reexamined from a\nnull interior field perspective. Exact surface currents provided by that\nsolution, when considered as disembodied half-plane laminae radiating into an\nambient, uniform space both inside and outside the wedge proper, do succeed in\nreconstituting both a specular, mirror field above the exposed face, and a\nshielding plane-wave field of a sign opposite to that of the incoming\nexcitation which, under superposition, creates both the classical,\ngeometric-optics shadow, and a strictly null interior field at the dominant,\nplane-wave level. Both mirror and shadow radiated fields are controlled by the\nresidue at just one simple pole encountered during a spectral radiative field\nassembly, fixed in place by incidence direction $\\phi_{0}$ as measured from the\nexposed face. The radiated fields further provide diffractive contributions\ndrawn from two saddle points that track observation angle $\\phi.$ Even these,\nmore or less asymptotic contributions, are found to cancel exactly within the\nwedge interior, while, on the outside, they recover in its every detail the\ncanonical structure lying at the base of GTD (geometric theory of diffraction).\nIt is earnestly hoped that this revised scattering viewpoint, while leaving\nintact all details of the existing solution, will impart to it a fresh,\nphysically robust meaning. Moreover, since this viewpoint confirms, admittedly\nin an extreme limit, the concept of field self-consistency (Ewald-Oseen\nextinction in more picturesque language), perhaps such explicit vindication may\nyet encourage efforts to seek exact solutions to scattering/diffraction by\nelectromagnetically permeable (dielectric) wedges, efforts that harness\nintegral equations with polarization/ohmic currents distributed throughout\nwedge volumes as sources radiating into an ambient, uniform reference medium.\n", "  We study in this work the dynamics of a granular impurity immersed in a\nlow-density granular gas of identical particles. For description of the\nkinetics of the granular gas and the impurity particles we use the rough hard\nsphere collisional model. We take into account the effects of non-conservation\nof energy upon particle collision. We find an (approximate) analytical solution\nof the pertinent kinetic equations for the single-particle velocity\ndistribution functions that reproduces reasonably well the properties of\ntranslational/rotational energy non-equipartition. We assess the accuracy of\nthe theoretical solution by comparing with computer simulations. For this, we\nuse two independent computer data sets, from molecular dynamics (MD) and from\nDirect Simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC). Both approach well, with different\ndegrees, the kinetic theory within a reasonable range of parameter values.\n", "  A fractal is in essence a hierarchy with cascade structure, which can be\ndescribed with a set of exponential functions. From these exponential\nfunctions, a set of power laws indicative of scaling can be derived. Hierarchy\nstructure and spatial network proved to be associated with one another. This\npaper is devoted to exploring the theory of fractal analysis of complex systems\nby means of hierarchical scaling. Two research methods are utilized to make\nthis study, including logic analysis method and empirical analysis method. The\nmain results are as follows. First, a fractal system such as Cantor set is\ndescribed from the hierarchical angle of view; based on hierarchical structure,\nthree approaches are proposed to estimate fractal dimension. Second, the\nhierarchical scaling can be generalized to describe multifractals, fractal\ncomplementary sets, and self-similar curve such as logarithmic spiral. Third,\ncomplex systems such as urban systems are demonstrated to be a self-similar\nhierarchy. The human settlements in Germany and the population of different\nlanguages in the world are taken as two examples to make empirical analyses.\nThis study may be revealing for associating fractal analysis with other types\nof scaling analysis of complex systems, and spatial optimization theory may be\ndeveloped in future by combining the theories of fractals, allometry, and\nhierarchy.\n", "  In this work we introduce a stochastic model to describe directional changes\nin the movement of swimming bacteria. We use the probability density function\n(PDF) of turn angles, measured on tumbling wild-type {\\it E. coli}, to build a\nLangevin equation for the deflection of the bacterial body swimming in\nisotropic media. We have solved this equation analytically by means of the\nGreen function method and shown that three parameters are sufficient to\ndescribe the movement: the characteristic time, the steady-state solution and\nthe control parameter. We conclude that the tumble motion, which is manifested\nas abrupt turns, is primarily caused by the rotational boost generated by the\nflagellar motor and complementarily by the rotational diffusion introduced by\nnoise. We show that in the tumble motion the deflection is a non-stationary\nstochastic process during times at which the tumbling occurs. By tuning the\ncontrol parameter our model is able to explain small turns of the bacteria\naround their centres of mass along the run. We show that the deflection during\nthe run is an OrnsteinUhlenbeck process, which for typical run times is\nstationary. We conclude that, along the run, the rotational boosts do not exist\nand that only the rotational diffusion remains. Thus we have a single model to\nexplain the turns of through a critical value that can explain the transition\nbetween the two turn behaviours. This model is the bacterium during the run or\ntumble movements, through a control parameter that can be tuned also able to\nexplain in a very satisfactory way all available statistical experimental data,\nsuch as PDFs and average values of turning angles times, of both run and tumble\nmotions.\n", "  The number of walks from one vertex to another in a finite graph can be\ncounted by the adjacency matrix. In this paper, we prove two theorems that\nconnect the graph Laplacian with two types of walks in a graph. By defining two\ntypes of walks and giving orientation to a finite graph, one can easily count\nthe number of the total signs of each kind of walk from one element to another\nof a fixed length.\n", "  We make a detailed study on the photoproduction mechanism of the doubly heavy\nflavored $B_c^{(*)}$ meson at the purposed Large Hadron Electron Collider\n(LHeC) within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD. In addition to the\nphotoproduction mechanism via the gluon-induced channel $\\gamma + g \\to\nB_c^{(*)} + b + \\bar{c}$, the extrinsic heavy quark mechanism via the two\nchannels $\\gamma + c \\to B_c^{(*)} + b $ and $\\gamma + \\bar{b} \\to B_c^{(*)} +\n\\bar{c}$ has also been studied. Those two extrinsic channels are generally\nsuppressed by the heavy quark distribution functions in proton, which however\nprovide significant contributions in low and intermediate $p_T$ region. A\ndetailed comparison of those channels together with the theoretical\nuncertainties has been presented. By summing up all the mentioned\nphotoproduction channels, we observe that about $(1.04^{+0.90}_{-0.53})\\times\n10^{5}$ $B_c$ and $(4.86^{+3.72}_{-2.30})\\times 10^{5}$ $B_c^*$ events can be\ngenerated at the LHeC in one operation year with the proton-electron collision\nenergy $\\sqrt{S}=1.30$ TeV and the luminosity ${\\mathcal L}\\simeq 10^{33}$\n${\\rm cm}^{-2} {\\rm s}^{-1}$. Here the errors are for $m_c=1.50\\pm0.20$ GeV and\n$m_b=4.9\\pm0.40$ GeV. Thus, in addition to the hadronic experiments, the LHeC\nshall provide another helpful platform for studying the $B_c^{(*)}$ meson\nproperties, especially to test the extrinsic heavy quark mechanism.\n", "  Circadian clocks must be able to entrain to time-varying signals to keep\ntheir oscillations in phase with the day-night rhythm. On the other hand, they\nmust also exhibit input compensation: their period must remain about one day in\ndifferent constant environments. The post-translational oscillator of the Kai\nsystem can be entrained by transient or oscillatory changes in the ATP\nfraction, yet is insensitive to constant changes in this fraction. We study in\nthree different models of this system how these two seemingly conflicting\ncriteria are met: the Van Zon model (Van Zon et al., PNAS, 2007), the Rust\nmodel (Phong et al., PNAS, 2013), and our new model (Paijmans et al.,\narXiv:1612.02715). We find that the new model exhibits the best trade-off\nbetween input compensation and entrainability: on the footing of equal\nphase-response curves, it exhibits the strongest input compensation. Performing\nstochastic simulations at the level of individual hexamers allows us to\nidentify a new mechanism, which is employed by the new model to achieve input\ncompensation: At lower ATP fraction, the individual hexamers make a shorter\ncycle in the phosphorylation state space, which compensates for the slower pace\nat which they traverse the cycle.\n", "  The BPS spectrum of string theory on AdS$_3\\times {\\rm S}^3 \\times {\\rm S}^3\n\\times {\\rm S}^1$ is determined using a world-sheet description in terms of WZW\nmodels. It is found that the theory only has BPS states with $j^+ = j^-$ where\n$j^{\\pm}$ refer to the spins of the $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebras of the large\n${\\cal N}=4$ superconformal algebra. We then re-examine the BPS spectrum of the\ncorresponding supergravity and find that, in contradistinction to previous\nclaims in the literature, also in supergravity only the states with $j^+=j^-$\nare BPS. This resolves a number of long-standing puzzles regarding the BPS\nspectrum of string theory and supergravity in this background.\n", "  Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality that\nis not yet adopted by clinical practice. Most of the working MPI prototypes\nincluding commercial-grade research MPI scanners utilize cylindrical bores that\nlimit the access to the scanner and the imaging volume. Recently a single-sided\nor an asymmetric device that is based on a field-free point (FFP) coplanar coil\ntopology has been introduced that shows promise in alleviating access\nconstraint issues. In this paper, we present a simulation study of selection\ncoils for a novel design of a single-sided MPI device that has an advantage of\na more sensitive field-free line (FFL) topology.\n", "  The observation of the decay $\\varXi^{-}_{b}\\to J/\\psi\\varLambda K^{-}$ is\nreported, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n$3~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb detector in $pp$ collisions at\ncentre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8~\\mathrm{TeV}$. The production rate of\n$\\varXi_{b}^{-}$ baryons detected in the decay $\\varXi_{b}^{-}\\to\nJ/\\psi\\varLambda K^{-}$ is measured relative to that of $\\varLambda_{b}^{0}$\nbaryons using the decay $\\varLambda_{b}^{0}\\to J/\\psi \\varLambda$. Integrated\nover the $b$-baryon transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}<25~\\mathrm{GeV/}c $ and\nrapidity $2.0<y<4.5$, the measured ratio is \\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{f_{\\varXi_{b}^{-}}}{f_{\\varLambda_{b}^{0}}}\\frac{\\mathcal{B}(\\varXi_{b}^{-}\\to\nJ/\\psi\\varLambda K^{-})}{\\mathcal{B}(\\varLambda_{b}^{0}\\to J/\\psi\n\\varLambda)}=(4.19\\pm 0.29~(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm0.15~(\\mathrm{syst}))\\times\n10^{-2}, \\end{equation*}where $f_{\\varXi_{b}^{-}}$ and $f_{\\varLambda_{b}^{0}}$\nare the fragmentation fractions of $b\\to\\varXi_{b}^{-}$ and\n$b\\to\\varLambda_{b}^{0}$ transitions, and $\\mathcal{B}$ represents the\nbranching fraction of the corresponding $b$-baryon decay. The mass difference\nbetween $\\varXi_{b}^{-}$ and $\\varLambda_{b}^{0}$ baryons is measured to be\n\\begin{equation*}\nM(\\varXi_{b}^{-})-M(\\varLambda_{b}^{0})=177.08\\pm0.47~(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm0.16~(\\mathrm{syst}\n)~\\mathrm{MeV/}c^{2}. \\end{equation*}\n", "  A search for the production of a single top quark in association with a Z\nboson is presented, both to identify the expected standard model process and to\nsearch for flavour-changing neutral current interactions. The data sample\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns recorded by\nthe CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV.\nFinal states with three leptons (electrons or muons) and at least one jet are\ninvestigated. An events yield compatible with tZq standard model production is\nobserved, and the corresponding cross section is measured to be sigma( p p -> t\nZ q -> l nu b l+ l- q ) = 10 +8/-7 fb with a significance of 2.4 standard\ndeviations. No presence of flavour-changing neutral current production of tZq\nis observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the branching\nfractions of a top quark decaying to a Z boson and an up or a charm quark are\nfound to be B( t -> Z u ) < 0.022% and B( t -> Z c ) < 0.049%.\n", "  A search for events containing four top quarks (ttbar-ttbar) is reported from\nproton-proton collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.6 inverse femtobarns. The\nanalysis considers the single-lepton (e or mu)+jets and the opposite-sign\ndilepton (mu+mu-, mu+/- e-/+, or e+e-)+jets channels. It uses boosted decision\ntrees to combine information on the global event and jet properties to\ndistinguish between ttbar-ttbar and ttbar production. The number of events\nobserved after all selection requirements is consistent with expectations from\nbackground and standard model signal predictions, and an upper limit is set on\nthe cross section for ttbar-ttbar production in the standard model of 94 fb at\n95% confidence level (10.2 times the prediction), with an expected limit of 118\nfb. This is combined with the results from the published CMS search in the\nsame-sign dilepton channel, resulting in an improved limit of 69 fb at 95%\nconfidence level (7.4 times the prediction), with an expected limit of 71 fb.\nThese are the strongest constraints on the rate of ttbar-ttbar production to\ndate.\n", "  We report on temperature-dependent magnetospectroscopy of two HgTe/CdHgTe\nquantum wells below and above the critical well thickness $d_c$. Our results,\nobtained in magnetic fields up to 16 T and temperature range from 2 K to 150 K,\nclearly indicate a change of the band-gap energy with temperature. The quantum\nwell wider than $d_c$ evidences a temperature-driven transition from\ntopological insulator to semiconductor phases. At the critical temperature of\n90 K, the merging of inter- and intra-band transitions in weak magnetic fields\nclearly specifies the formation of gapless state, revealing the appearance of\nsingle-valley massless Dirac fermions with velocity of $5.6\\times10^5$\nm$\\times$s$^{-1}$. For both quantum wells, the energies extracted from\nexperimental data are in good agreement with calculations on the basis of the\n8-band Kane Hamiltonian with temperature-dependent parameters.\n", "  We present a method of sensing AC magnetic fields. The method is based on the\nconstruction of a robust qubit by the application of continuous driving fields.\nSpecifically, magnetic noise and power fluctuations of the driving fields do\nnot operate within the robust qubit subspace, and hence, robustness to both\nexternal and controller noise is achieved. We consider trapped-ion based\nimplementation via the dipole transitions, which is relevant for several types\nof ions, such as the $^{40}{\\rm{Ca}}^{+}$, $^{88}{\\rm{Sr}}^{+}$, and the\n$^{138}{\\rm{Ba}}^{+}$ ions. Taking experimental errors into account, we\nconclude that the coherence time of the robust qubit can be improved by up to\n$\\sim 4$ orders of magnitude compared to the coherence time of the bare states.\nWe show how the robust qubit can be utilized for the task of sensing AC\nmagnetic fields, leading to an improvement of $\\sim 2$ orders of magnitude of\nthe sensitivity. In addition, we present a microwave based sensing scheme that\nis suitable for ions with a hyperfine structure, such as the\n$^{9}{\\rm{Be}}^{+}$,$^{25}{\\rm{Mg}}^{+}$,$^{43}{\\rm{Ca}}^{+}$,$^{87}{\\rm{Sr}}^{+}$,$^{137}{\\rm{Ba}}^{+}$,$^{111}{\\rm{Cd}}^{+}$,$^{171}{\\rm{Yb}}^{+}$,\nand the $^{199}{\\rm{Hg}}^{+}$ ions. This scheme enables the enhanced sensing of\nhigh frequency fields at the GHz level.\n", "  The photoproduction of doubly heavy baryon, $\\Xi_{cc}$, $\\Xi_{bc}$ and\n$\\Xi_{bb}$, is predicted within the nonrelativistic QCD at the Large Hadron\nElectron Collider (LHeC). The $\\Xi_{QQ'}$ production via the photon-gluon\nfusing channel $\\gamma + g \\to \\langle{QQ'}\\rangle[n] +\\bar{Q} +\\bar{Q'}$ and\nthe extrinsic heavy quark channel $\\gamma + Q \\to\n\\langle{QQ'}\\rangle[n]+\\bar{Q'}$ have been considered, where $Q$ or $Q'$ stand\nfor heavy $c$ or $b$ quark and $\\langle{QQ'}\\rangle[n]$ stands for a $QQ'$\ndiquark with given spin- and color- configurations $[n]$. The diquark shall\nfragmentate into $\\Xi_{QQ'}$ baryon with high probability. For $\\Xi_{cc}$ and\n$\\Xi_{bb}$ production, $[n]$ equals $[^1S_0]_{\\textbf{6}}$ (in configurations\nspin-singlet $^1S_0$-wave and color-sextuplet $\\textbf{6}$) or\n$[^3S_1]_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ (in configurations spin-triplet $^3S_1$-wave and\ncolor-antitriplet $\\bar{\\textbf{3}}$) and for $\\Xi_{bc}$ production, $[n]$\nequals $[^1S_0]_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$, $[^1S_0]_{{\\textbf{6}}}$,\n$[^3S_1]_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ or $[^3S_1]_{\\textbf{6}}$. A detailed comparison\nof those channels and configurations on total and differential cross sections,\ntogether with their uncertainties, is presented. We find the dominate\ncontributions for $\\Xi_{QQ'}$ production are from extrinsic heavy quark channel\nand for $[^3S_1]_{\\bar{\\textbf{3}}}$ configuration; While other diquark states\ncan also provide sizable contributions to the $\\Xi_{QQ'}$ production. As a\ncombination of all the mentioned channels and configurations and by taking\n$m_c=1.80\\pm0.10$ GeV and $m_b=5.1\\pm0.20$ GeV, we observe that\n$(6.70^{+1.40}_{-1.10})\\times 10^{3}$ $\\Xi_{bb}$, $(8.81^{+3.08}_{-2.20})\\times\n10^{6}$ $\\Xi_{cc}$ and $(4.63^{+1.21}_{-0.92})\\times 10^{5}$ $\\Xi_{bc}$ events\ncan be generated at the LHeC in one operation year.\n", "  We study an extended Standard Model with a gauged U(1)$^{\\prime}$ flavor\nsymmetry, motivated not only by the fermion mass hierarchy but also by the\nexcesses in $B \\to K^{(*)} l l$ reported by the LHCb collaborations. The\nU(1)$^{\\prime}$ charges are assigned to quarks and leptons in a\nflavor-dependent manner, and flavored Higgs doublets are also introduced in\norder to detail the Yukawa couplings at the renormalizable level. Then, the\nfermion mass hierarchy is realized by the vacuum alignment of the Higgs\ndoublets. In this model, flavor-changing currents involving the gauge boson of\nU(1)$^{\\prime}$ and the scalars generated by the Higgs doublets are predicted\nand the observables in the $B \\to K^{(*)} l l$ process possibly deviate from\nthe Standard Model predictions. We study the possibility that these new\nflavor-changing interactions can explain the excesses in the $B \\to K^{(*)} l\nl$ process, and we derive some predictions for the other flavor-violating\nprocesses based on the analysis. We specifically investigate the $\\Delta F=2$\nprocesses and the other $B$ decays: e.g., $B \\to X_s \\gamma$ and $B \\to D^{(*)}\n\\tau \\nu$, where the deviations are reported by the Belle and $BABAR$\ncollaborations.\n", "  A search for dark matter particles is performed using events with large\nmissing transverse momentum, at least one energetic jet, and no leptons, in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at\nthe LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9\ninverse femtobarns. The search includes events with jets from the hadronic\ndecays of a W or Z boson. The data are found to be in agreement with the\npredicted background contributions from standard model processes. The results\nare presented in terms of simplified models in which dark matter particles are\nproduced through interactions involving a vector, axial-vector, scalar, or\npseudoscalar mediator. Vector and axial-vector mediator particles with masses\nup to 1.95 TeV, and scalar and pseudoscalar mediator particles with masses up\nto 100 and 430 GeV respectively, are excluded at 95% confidence level. The\nresults are also interpreted in terms of the invisible decays of the Higgs\nboson, yielding an observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.44\n(0.56) on the corresponding branching fraction. The results of this search\nprovide the strongest constraints on the dark matter pair production cross\nsection through vector and axial-vector mediators at a particle collider. When\ncompared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this\nsearch provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and\n550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. The\nsearch yields stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 200 GeV,\nassuming a pseudoscalar mediator, when compared to the indirect detection\nresults from Fermi-LAT.\n", "  In a seminal paper [D. N. Page, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 1291 (1993)], Page\nproved that the average entanglement entropy of subsystems of random pure\nstates is $S_{\\rm ave}\\simeq\\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm A} - (1/2) {\\cal D}_{\\rm\nA}^2/{\\cal D}$ for $1\\ll{\\cal D}_{\\rm A}\\leq\\sqrt{\\cal D}$, where ${\\cal\nD}_{\\rm A}$ and ${\\cal D}$ are the Hilbert space dimensions of the subsystem\nand the system, respectively. Hence, typical pure states are (nearly) maximally\nentangled. We develop tools to compute the average entanglement entropy\n$\\langle S\\rangle$ of all eigenstates of quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians. In\nparticular, we derive exact bounds for the most general translationally\ninvariant models $\\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm A} - (\\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm A})^2/\\ln{\\cal D}\n\\leq \\langle S \\rangle \\leq \\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm A} - [1/(2\\ln2)] (\\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm\nA})^2/\\ln{\\cal D}$. Consequently we prove that: (i) if the subsystem size is a\nfinite fraction of the system size then $\\langle S\\rangle<\\ln{\\cal D}_{\\rm A}$\nin the thermodynamic limit, i.e., the average over eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian departs from the result for typical pure states, and (ii) in the\nlimit in which the subsystem size is a vanishing fraction of the system size,\nthe average entanglement entropy is maximal, i.e., typical eigenstates of such\nHamiltonians exhibit eigenstate thermalization.\n", "  Using a Luttinger liquid theory we investigate the time evolution of the\nparticle density of a one-dimensional spinful fermionic system with open\nboundaries and subject to a finite-duration quench of the inter-particle\ninteraction. Taking into account also the turning on of an umklapp perturbation\nto the system Hamiltonian as a result of the quench, we study the possible\nformation of a Wigner molecule inside the system, focusing in particular on the\nsudden and adiabatic regimes. We show that the creation of this correlated\nstate is essentially due to the propagation of \"light-cone\" perturbations\nthrough system which arise after both switching on and switching off the\nquenching protocol and that its behavior strongly depends on the quench\nduration.\n", "  Left-handed materials usually are realized in artificial subwavelength\nstructures. Here we show that some anisotropic superconductors, such as\n$\\mathrm{Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\\delta}}$, $\\mathrm{YBa_2Cu_xO_y}$ and\n$\\mathrm{La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4}$, are intrinsic left-handed materials. The\ncondition is that the plasma frequency in the $c$ axis, $\\omega_c$, and in the\n$ab$ plane, $\\omega_{ab}$, and the operating frequency, $\\omega$, satisfy\n$\\omega_c<\\omega<\\omega_{ab}$. In addition $\\omega$ should be smaller than the\nsuperconducting energy gap to sustain superconductivity. We study the\nreflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves, and reveal negative\nrefraction and backward wave with phase velocity opposite to the direction of\nenergy flux propagation. We also discuss possible approaches of improvement,\nmaking these properties feasible for experimental validation. Being intrinsic\nleft-hand materials, the anisotropic superconductors are promising for\napplications in novel electromagnetic devices in the terahertz frequency band.\n", "  We derive two-loop anomalous dimensions for four-Fermi operators in\nsupersymmetric theories using the effective Kahler potential. We introduce the\ngeneral forms in generic gauge theories and apply our results to the\nflavor-changing operators in (minimal) supersymmetric standard models.\n", "  Resonant Raman scattering is investigated in monolayer WS$_2$ at low\ntemperature with the aid of an unconventional spectroscopy technique, $i.e.$,\nRaman scattering excitation (RSE). The RSE spectrum is made up by sweeping the\nexcitation energy, when the detection energy is fixed in resonance with\nexcitonic transitions related to neutral and/or charged excitons. We\ndemonstrate that the shape of the RSE spectrum strongly depends on a selected\ndetection energy. The out-going resonance with the neutral exciton leads to an\nextremely rich RSE spectrum displaying several Raman scattering features not\nreported so far, while no clear effect on the associated background\nphotoluminescence is observed. Instead, a strong enhancement of the emission\ndue to the negatively charged exciton is apparent when the out-going photons\nresonate with this exciton. Presented results show that the RSE spectroscopy\ncan be a useful technique to study electron-phonon interactions in thin layers\nof transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  We present a monolithic solution to extract efficiently light from terahertz\nquantum cascade lasers with metal-metal waveguides suitable for broadband\nfrequency comb applications. The design is optimized for a bandwidth of 500 GHz\naround a center frequency of 2.6 THz. A five-fold increase in total output\npower is observed compared to standard metal-metal waveguides. The extractor\nfeatures a single-lobed far-field pattern and increases the frequency comb\ndynamical range to cover more than 50 % of the laser dynamic range. Frequency\ncomb operation up to a spectral bandwidth of 670 GHz is achieved.\n", "  The results of the probabilistic analysis of the direct numerical simulations\nof irregular unidirectional deep-water waves are discussed. It is shown that an\noccurrence of large-amplitude soliton-like groups represents an extraordinary\ncase, which is able to increase noticeably the probability of high waves even\nin moderately rough sea conditions. The ensemble of wave realizations should be\nlarge enough to take these rare events into account. Hence we provide a\nstriking example when long-living coherent structures make the water wave\nstatistics extreme.\n", "  Many of the fascinating and unconventional properties of several\ntransition-metal compounds with partially filled d-shells are due to strong\nelectronic correlations. While local correlations are in principle treated\nexactly within the frame of the dynamical mean-field theory, there are two\nmajor and interlinked routes for important further methodical advances: On the\none hand, there is a strong need for methods being able to describe\nmaterial-specific aspects, i.e., methods combining the DMFT with modern\nband-structure theory, and, on the other hand, nonlocal correlations beyond the\nmean-field paradigm must be accounted for. Referring to several concrete\nexample systems, we argue why these two routes are worth pursuing and how they\ncan be combined, we describe several related methodical developments and\npresent respective results, and we discuss possible ways to overcome remaining\nobstacles.\n", "  Synergies between evolutionary game theory and statistical physics have\nsignificantly improved our understanding of public cooperation in structured\npopulations. Multiplex networks, in particular, provide the theoretical\nframework within network science that allows us to mathematically describe the\nrich structure of interactions characterizing human societies. While research\nhas shown that multiplex networks may enhance the resilience of cooperation,\nthe interplay between the overlap in the structure of the layers and the\ncontrol parameters of the corresponding games has not yet been investigated.\nWith this aim, we consider here the public goods game on a multiplex network,\nand we unveil the role of the number of layers and the overlap of links, as\nwell as the impact of different synergy factors in different layers, on the\nonset of cooperation. We show that enhanced public cooperation emerges only\nwhen a significant edge overlap is combined with at least one layer being able\nto sustain some cooperation by means of a sufficiently high synergy factor. In\nthe absence of either of these conditions, the evolution of cooperation in\nmultiplex networks is determined by the bounds of traditional network\nreciprocity with no enhanced resilience. These results caution against overly\noptimistic predictions that the presence of multiple social domains may in\nitself promote cooperation, and they help us better understand the complexity\nbehind prosocial behavior in layered social systems.\n", "  The ordering wave vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ of a spin density wave (SDW),\nstabilized within the superconducting state of $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ in a high\nmagnetic field, has been shown to be hypersensitive to the direction of the\nfield. $\\mathbf{Q}$ can be switched from a nodal direction of the $d$-wave\nsuperconducting order parameter to a perpendicular node by rotating the\nin-plane magnetic field through the antinodal direction within a fraction of a\ndegree. Here, we address the dynamics of the switching of $\\mathbf{Q}$. We use\na free energy functional based on the magnetization density, which describes\nthe condensation of magnetic fluctuations of nodal quasiparticles, and show\nthat the switching process includes closing of the SDW gap at one $\\mathbf{Q}$\nand then reopening the SDW gap at another $\\mathbf{Q}$ perpendicular to the\nfirst one. The magnetic field couples to $\\mathbf{Q}$ through the spin-orbit\ninteraction. Our calculations show that the width of the hysteretic region of\nswitching depends linearly on the deviation of magnetic field from the critical\nfield associated with the SDW transition, consistent with our thermal\nconductivity measurements. The agreement between theory and experiment supports\nour scenario of the hypersensitivity of the $Q$ phase on the direction of\nmagnetic field, as well as the magnon condensation as the origin of the SDW\nphase in $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$.\n", "  Extensive cooperation among unrelated individuals is unique to humans, who\noften sacrifice personal benefits for the common good and work together to\nachieve what they are unable to execute alone. The evolutionary success of our\nspecies is indeed due, to a large degree, to our unparalleled other-regarding\nabilities. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of human cooperation remains a\nformidable challenge. Recent research in social science indicates that it is\nimportant to focus on the collective behavior that emerges as the result of the\ninteractions among individuals, groups, and even societies. Non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics, in particular Monte Carlo methods and the theory of\ncollective behavior of interacting particles near phase transition points, has\nproven to be very valuable for understanding counterintuitive evolutionary\noutcomes. By studying models of human cooperation as classical spin models, a\nphysicist can draw on familiar settings from statistical physics. However,\nunlike pairwise interactions among particles that typically govern solid-state\nphysics systems, interactions among humans often involve group interactions,\nand they also involve a larger number of possible states even for the most\nsimplified description of reality. The complexity of solutions therefore often\nsurpasses that observed in physical systems. Here we review experimental and\ntheoretical research that advances our understanding of human cooperation,\nfocusing on spatial pattern formation, on the spatiotemporal dynamics of\nobserved solutions, and on self-organization that may either promote or hinder\nsocially favorable states.\n", "  A study of the group properties of galaxies in our immediate neighborhood\nprovides a singular opportunity to observationally constrain the halo mass\nfunction, a fundamental characterization of galaxy formation. Detailed studies\nof individual groups have provided the coefficients of scaling relations\nbetween a proxy for the virial radius, velocity dispersion, and mass that\nusefully allows groups to be defined over the range $10^{10} - 10^{15}$\n$M_\\odot$. At a second hierarchical level, associations are defined as regions\naround collapsed halos extending to the zero velocity surface at the decoupling\nfrom cosmic expansion. The most remarkable result of the study emerges from the\nconstruction of the halo mass function from the sample. At $\\sim10^{12}$\n$M_\\odot$ there is a jog from the expectation Sheth-Tormen function, such that\nhalo counts drop by a factor $\\sim 3$ in all lower mass bins.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar flares are the large-scale and most\nenergetic eruptive phenomena in our solar system and able to release a large\nquantity of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar atmosphere into the solar\nwind. When these high-speed magnetized plasmas along with the energetic\nparticles arrive at the Earth, they may interact with the magnetosphere and\nionosphere, and seriously affect the safety of human high-tech activities in\nouter space. The travel time of a CME to 1 AU is about 1-3 days, while\nenergetic particles from the eruptions arrive even earlier. An efficient\nforecast of these phenomena therefore requires a clear detection of CMEs/flares\nat the stage as early as possible. To estimate the possibility of an eruption\nleading to a CME/flare, we need to elucidate some fundamental but elusive\nprocesses including in particular the origin and structures of CMEs/flares.\nUnderstanding these processes can not only improve the prediction of the\noccurrence of CMEs/flares and their effects on geospace and the heliosphere but\nalso help understand the mass ejections and flares on other solar-type stars.\nThe main purpose of this review is to address the origin and early structures\nof CMEs/flares, from multi-wavelength observational perspective. First of all,\nwe start with the ongoing debate of whether the pre-eruptive configuration,\ni.e., a helical magnetic flux rope (MFR), of CMEs/flares exists before the\neruption and then emphatically introduce observational manifestations of the\nMFR. Secondly, we elaborate on the possible formation mechanisms of the MFR\nthrough distinct ways. Thirdly, we discuss the initiation of the MFR and\nassociated dynamics during its evolution toward the CME/flare. Finally, we come\nto some conclusions and put forward some prospects in the future.\n", "  We use the LHCb data on the forward production of $D$ mesons at 7, 13 and 5\nTeV to make a direct determination of the gluon distribution, $xg$, at NLO in\nthe $10^{-5} \\lesssim x \\lesssim 10^{-4}$ region. We first use a simple\nparametrization of the gluon density in each of the four transverse momentum\nintervals of the detected $D$ mesons. Second, we use a double log\nparametrization to make a combined fit to all the LHCb $D$ meson data. The\nvalues found for $xg$ in the above $x$ domain are of the similar magnitude (or\na bit larger) than the central values of extrapolations of the gluons obtained\nby the global PDF analyses into this small $x$ region. However, in contrast, we\nfind $xg$ has a weak dependence on $x$.\n", "  By combining the algebraic Bethe ansatz and the off-diagonal Bethe ansatz, we\ninvestigate the supersymmetric t-J model with generic open boundaries. The\neigenvalues of the transfer matrix are given in terms of an inhomogeneous T-Q\nrelation, and the corresponding eigenstates are expressed in terms of nested\nBethe states which have well-defined homogeneous limit. This exact solution\nprovides basis for further analyzing the thermodynamic properties and\ncorrelation functions of the model.\n", "  Recent experiments have reported the emergence of high temperature\nsuperconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ between 43K and 123K in a\npotassium doped aromatic hydrocarbon para-Terphenyl or p-Terphenyl. This\nachievement provides the record for the highest Tc in an organic superconductor\novercoming the previous record of Tc=38 K in Cs3C60 fulleride. Here we propose\nthat the driving mechanism is the quantum resonance between superconducting\ngaps near a Lifshitz transition which belongs to the class of Fano resonances\ncalled shape resonances. For the case of p-Terphenyl our numerical solutions of\nthe multi gap equation shows that high Tc is driven by tuning the chemical\npotential by K doping and it appears only in a narrow energy range near a\nLifshitz transition. At the maximum critical temperature, Tc=123K, the\ncondensate in the appearing new small Fermi surface pocket is in the BCS-BEC\ncrossover while the Tc drops below 0.3 K where it is in the BEC regime. Finally\nwe predict the experimental results which can support or falsify our proposed\nmechanism: a) the variation of the isotope coefficient as a function of the\ncritical temperature and b) the variation of the gaps and their ratios\n2Delta/Tc as a function of Tc.\n", "  A grand canonical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is presented for studying the\nlattice gas model (LGM) of multiple protein sequence alignment, which\ncoherently combines long-range interactions and variable-length insertions. MC\nsimulations are used for both parameter optimization of the model and\nproduction runs to explore the sequence subspace around a given protein family.\nIn this Note, I describe the details of the MC algorithm as well as some\npreliminary results of MC simulations with various temperatures and chemical\npotentials, and compare them with the mean-field approximation. The existence\nof a two-state transition in the sequence space is suggested for the SH3 domain\nfamily, and inappropriateness of the mean-field approximation for the LGM is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  We report the development of programs for on-the-fly surface hopping dynamics\nsimulations in the gas and condensed phases on the potential energy surfaces\ncomputed by multistate multireference perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2) with\nfull internal contraction. On-the-fly nonadiabatic dynamics simulations are\nmade possible by improving the algorithm for XMS-CASPT2 nuclear energy gradient\nand derivative coupling evaluation. The program is interfaced to a surface\nhopping dynamics program, Newton-X, and a classical molecular dynamics package,\ntinker, to realize such simulations. On-the-fly XMS-CASPT2 surface-hopping\ndynamics simulations of 9H-adenine and an anionic GFP model chromophore\n(para-hydroxybenzilideneimidazolin-5-one) in water are presented to demonstrate\nthe applicability of our program to sizable systems. Our program is implemented\nin the bagel package, which is publicly available under the GNU General Public\nLicense.\n", "  In this paper we estimate the time resolution of the J-PET scanner built from\nplastic scintillators. We incorporate the method of signal processing using the\nTikhonov regularization framework and the Kernel Density Estimation method. We\nobtain simple, closed-form analytical formulas for time resolutions. The\nproposed method is validated using signals registered by means of the single\ndetection unit of the J-PET tomograph built out from 30 cm long plastic\nscintillator strip. It is shown that the experimental and theoretical results,\nobtained for the J-PET scanner equipped with vacuum tube photomultipliers, are\nconsistent.\n", "  The interplay of rotation and manifested magnetic activity on ultracool\ndwarfs (UCDs) is of key importance for gathering clues as to the operation of\nthe dynamos within these objects. A number of magnetized UCDs host kG-strength\nmagnetic fields. It was recently reported that the L8 dwarf WISEP\nJ060738.65+242953.4 is a radio-emitting UCD that is likely observed pole-on,\ndue to its lack of photometric variability and narrow spectral lines. Follow-up\nradio observations at Arecibo Observatory, together with careful analysis of\npreviously published details, however, suggest that the scientific and\nstatistical significance of the radio and spectroscopic data have been\noverstated. If the UCD is observed along its aligned spin/magnetic axis, the\nabsence of observed H$\\alpha$ activity may present challenges to the auroral\nmodel of UCD magnetism, although short or long-term cyclic magnetic activity\nmay explain this behavior. Monte Carlo simulations presented here suggest that\nthe source probably rotates with v sin i=6-12 km s$^{-1}$, indicating that its\ninclination angle and rotational velocity are unexceptional and that its\nangular momentum has evolved as expected for brown dwarfs observed in ~1\nMyr-old clusters. The discovery and verification of the most rapidly and\nslowest rotating brown dwarfs place valuable constraints on the angular\nmomentum evolution and magnetic activity history of these objects.\n", "  We present a procedure for calculating expected exoplanet imaging yields,\nwhich explicitly separates the effects of instrument performance from\nassumptions of planet distributions. This `depth of search' approach allows for\nfast recalculation of yield values for variations in instrument parameters. We\nalso describe a new target star selection metric with no dependence on an\nassumed planet population that can be used as a proxy for single-visit\ncompleteness. This approach allows for the recovery of the total mission\ncompleteness via convolution of the depth of search grid with an equivalent\ngrid of assumed occurrence rates and integration over the part of the grid\nrepresenting the population of interest (e.g., Earth-like planets on habitable\nzone orbits, etc.). In this work, we discuss the practical details of\ncalculating the depth of search and present results of such calculations for\none design iteration of the WFIRST coronagraphs.\n", "  Recent measurements have revealed a number of intriguing deviations from the\nStandard Model predictions in $B$ meson decays, in particular in observables\ntesting lepton flavour universality. We review their experimental status and\ntheoretical description in terms of effective Hamiltonians. We also discuss\npossible new physics interpretations in terms of simplified models and\nsummarise their status in view of the stringent constraints from flavour\nphysics and high-$p_T$ collider searches.\n", "  The wetting behavior of a liquid on solid substrates is governed by the\nnature of the effective interaction between the liquid-gas and the solid-liquid\ninterfaces, which is described by the binding or wetting potential $g(h)$ which\nis an excess free energy per unit area that depends on the liquid film height\n$h$. Given a microscopic theory for the liquid, to determine $g(h)$ one must\ncalculate the free energy for liquid films of any given value of $h$; i.e. one\nneeds to create and analyze out-of-equilibrium states, since at equilibrium\nthere is a unique value of $h$, specified by the temperature and chemical\npotential of the surrounding gas. Here we introduce a Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)\napproach to calculate $g(h)$ and illustrate the method by applying it in\nconjunction with a microscopic lattice density functional theory for the\nliquid. We show too that the NEB results are identical to those obtained with\nan established method based on using a fictitious additional potential to\nstabilize the non-equilibrium states. The advantages of the NEB approach are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We report on the first implementation of ultrafast near field nanoscopy\ncarried out with the transient pseudoheterodyne detection method (Tr-pHD). This\nmethod is well suited for efficient and artifact free pump-probe\nscattering-type near-field optical microscopy with nanometer scale resolution.\nThe Tr-pHD technique is critically compared to other data acquisition methods\nand found to offer significant advantages. Experimental evidence for the\nadvantages of Tr-pHD is provided in the Near-IR frequency range. Crucial\nfactors involved in achieving proper performance of the Tr-pHD method with\npulsed laser sources are analyzed and detailed in this work. We applied this\nnovel method to time-resolved and spatially resolved studies of the\nphoto-induced effects in the insulator-to-metal transition system vanadium\ndioxide with nanometer scale resolution.\n", "  We compute the $g=1, n=1$ B-model Gromov-Witten invariant of an elliptic\ncurve E directly from the derived category D(E). More precisely, we carry out\nthe computation of the categorical Gromov-Witten invariant defined by Costello\nusing as target a cyclic $A_\\infty$ model of D(E) described by Polishchuk.\n  This is the first non-trivial computation of a positive genus categorical\nGromov-Witten invariant, and the result agrees with the prediction of mirror\nsymmetry: it matches the classical (non-categorical) Gromov-Witten invariants\nof a symplectic 2-torus computed by Dijkgraaf.\n", "  We present an x-ray magnetic dichroism (XMCD) and soft x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS) study to address the nature of emerging magnetic order in\nmetallic Copper as Cobalt is added to the matrix. For this purpose line shape\nand energy position of XAS and XMCD spectra will be analyzed for a series of\nCo/Cu alloys as well as a multilayer reference. We observe an increased\nhybridization between Cu and Co sites as well as increased localization of the\nCu d-electrons and an induced magnetic moment in Cu. The emergence of long\nrange magnetic order in non-magnetic materials that are in proximity to a\nferromagnet is significant for a comprehensive interpretation of transport\nphenomena at ferromagnetic/non-magnetic interfaces, like e.g. the giant\nmagnetoresistance effect. The presented results will further enable us to\ninterpret Cu XMCD and XAS spectra acquired from unknown Co/Cu samples to\nidentify the environment of Cu atoms exhibiting proximity induced magnetism.\n", "  We study the generation of biphoton modally entangled states in such\nwaveguide structures that lead to spectrum broadening. The process of\nspontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) has been considered for the\nbiphoton generation. The main subject of our study is the dependence of the\nbiphoton spectra on the structure spatial characteristics. The representation\nof the core structures as definite assembles of nonlinear layers allows us to\nfind analytical description for biphoton spectrum. We show that chirped\nbiphotons with discrete as well as continuous spectra can be generated\ndepending on the waveguide structure. The conditions for spectrum\ndiscretization are obtained analytically. It is shown that the biphoton\nentangled states can be controlled by varying the parameters of the waveguide\nstructure.\n", "  The optical potential is a powerful instrument for calculations on a wide\nvariety of nuclear reactions, in particular, for quasi-elastic lepton-nucleus\nscattering. Phenomenological optical potentials are successful in the\ndescription of data but may produce uncertainties in the interpretation of the\nresults. Two recent theoretical optical potentials are presented: a global\nrelativistic folding optical potential, that has been employed in relativistic\nmodels for quasi-elastic lepton-nucleus scattering, and a non relativistic\noptical potential derived from nucleon-nucleon chiral potentials at fourth\norder (N4LO), that has been applied to elastic proton-nucleus scattering.\n", "  We describe preliminary investigations of using Docker for the deployment and\ntesting of astronomy software. Docker is a relatively new containerisation\ntechnology that is developing rapidly and being adopted across a range of\ndomains. It is based upon virtualization at operating system level, which\npresents many advantages in comparison to the more traditional hardware\nvirtualization that underpins most cloud computing infrastructure today. A\nparticular strength of Docker is its simple format for describing and managing\nsoftware containers, which has benefits for software developers, system\nadministrators and end users.\n  We report on our experiences from two projects -- a simple activity to\ndemonstrate how Docker works, and a more elaborate set of services that\ndemonstrates more of its capabilities and what they can achieve within an\nastronomical context -- and include an account of how we solved problems\nthrough interaction with Docker's very active open source development\ncommunity, which is currently the key to the most effective use of this\nrapidly-changing technology.\n", "  We demonstrate the linearity and stability of a gamma-ray scintillation\ndetector comprised of a NaI(Tl) crystal and a scientific-grade CMOS camera.\nAfter calibration, this detector exhibits excellent linearity more than three\ndecades of activity levels. Because the detector is not counting pulses, no\ndead-time correction is required. When high activity sources are brought into\nclose proximity to the NaI crystal, several minutes are required for the\nscintillation to achieve a steady state. On longer time scales, we measure\ndrifts of a few percent over several days. These instabilities have important\nimplications for precision determinations of nuclear decay rate stability.\n", "  There is a low frequency of sunspot observations in some years of the 17th\nand 18th century. In particular, the interval 1777-1795 is one of the periods\nwith scarce observations in the databases. In this note, we report a sunspot\nobservation carried out the 3rd November 1779 by Giuseppe Toaldo and Andrea\nComparetti.\n", "  The fraction of galaxies supported by internal rotation compared to galaxies\nstabilized by internal pressure provides a strong constraint on galaxy\nformation models. In integral field spectroscopy surveys, this fraction is\nbiased because survey instruments typically only trace the inner parts of the\nmost massive galaxies. We present aperture corrections for the two most widely\nused stellar kinematic quantities $V/\\sigma$ and $\\lambda_{R}$. Our\ndemonstration involves integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and the\nATLAS$^{\\rm{3D}}$ Survey. We find a tight relation for both $V/\\sigma$ and\n$\\lambda_{R}$ when measured in different apertures that can be used as a linear\ntransformation as a function of radius, i.e., a first-order aperture\ncorrection. We find that $V/\\sigma$ and $\\lambda_{R}$ radial growth curves are\nwell approximated by second order polynomials. By only fitting the inner\nprofile (0.5$R_{\\rm{e}}$), we successfully recover the profile out to one\n$R_{\\rm{e}}$ if a constraint between the linear and quadratic parameter in the\nfit is applied. However, the aperture corrections for $V/\\sigma$ and\n$\\lambda_{R}$ derived by extrapolating the profiles perform as well as applying\na first-order correction. With our aperture-corrected $\\lambda_{R}$\nmeasurements, we find that the fraction of slow rotating galaxies increases\nwith stellar mass. For galaxies with $\\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot}>$ 11, the fraction\nof slow rotators is $35.9\\pm4.3$ percent, but is underestimated if galaxies\nwithout coverage beyond one $R_{\\rm{e}}$ are not included in the sample\n($24.2\\pm5.3$ percent). With measurements out to the largest aperture radius\nthe slow rotator fraction is similar as compared to using aperture corrected\nvalues ($38.3\\pm4.4$ percent). Thus, aperture effects can significantly bias\nstellar kinematic IFS studies, but this bias can now be removed with the method\noutlined here.\n", "  Approximately once every $10^4$ years, a star passes close enough to the\nsupermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way to be pulled\napart by the black hole's tidal forces. The star is then \"spaghettified\" into a\nlong stream of matter, with approximately one half being bound to Sgr A* and\nthe other half unbound. Within this stream, the local self-gravity dominates\nthe tidal field of Sgr A*, which at minimum restricts the stream to a small\nfinite width. As the stream cools from adiabatic expansion and begins to\nrecombine, the residual self-gravity allows for planetary-mass fragments to\nform along the length of the stream; these fragments are then shot out into the\ngalaxy at range of velocities, with the fastest moving at ~10% c. We determine\nthe phase space distributions of these fragments for a realistic ensemble of\nstellar disruptions, along with the local density of fragments in the solar\nneighborhood. We find that ~$10^7$ fragments produced by Sgr A* accumulate\nwithin the Milky Way over its lifetime, that there are ~$10^7$ fragments that\nlie within 1 Mpc of the Milky Way originating from other galaxies, and that the\nnearest fragment to our Sun is on average 500 pc distant.\n", "  Conventional fracture data collection methods are usually implemented on\nplanar surfaces or assuming they are planar; these methods may introduce\nsampling errors on uneven outcrop surfaces. Consequently, data collected on\nlimited types of outcrop surfaces (mainly bedding surfaces) may not be a\nsufficient representation of fracture network characteristic in outcrops.\nRecent development of techniques that obtain DOMs from outcrops and extract the\nfull extent of individual fractures offers the opportunity to address the\nproblem of performing the conventional sampling methods on uneven outcrop\nsurfaces. In this study, we propose a new method that performs outcrop fracture\ncharacterization on suppositional planes cutting through DOMs. The\nsuppositional plane is the best fit plane of the outcrop surface, and the\nfracture trace map is extracted on the suppositional plane so that the fracture\nnetwork can be further characterized. The amount of sampling errors introduced\nby the conventional methods and avoided by the new method on 16 uneven outcrop\nsurfaces with different roughnesses are estimated. The results show that the\nconventional sampling methods don't apply to outcrops other than bedding\nsurfaces or outcrops whose roughness > 0.04 m, and that the proposed method can\ngreatly extend the types of outcrop surfaces for outcrop fracture\ncharacterization with the suppositional plane cutting through DOMs.\n", "  Noncommutativity lies in the heart of quantum theory and provides rich set of\ninteresting questions in physics and mathematics. In this work I present some\nof them through the concept of Joint Numerical Range (JNR) - the set of\nsimultaneously attainable averages of quantum observables, which in general\nneed not commute. Full description of JNR geometry quickly becomes complex as\nthe dimensionality of quantum system grows. In this thesis I present already\nexisting results in the theory of JNR, generalizations of the formalism and\napplications of JNR in the theory of phase transitions and uncertainty\nrelations.\n", "  When a drop dries, it often leaves a ring-shaped stain through a ubiquitous\nphenomenon known as the coffee-ring effect. This also occurs when the liquid\ncontains suspended microbes; evaporation leaves cells at higher concentrations\nin the ring than the drop interior. Using biofilm experiments and cellular\nautomata simulations, we show that the physical structure created by the\ncoffee-ring effect can dramatically alter the outcome of inter-bacterial\ncompetition. We experimentally study this effect using two strains of\n$\\textit{Vibrio cholerae}$ that compete using a contact-dependent killing\nmechanism termed the type 6 secretion system. By creating a heterogeneous\ndensity profile, the coffee-ring effect changes the outcome of competition: the\nbacterial strain that wins in the low-density interior loses in the far denser\nring. Through simulations parameterized with experimentally-determined density\nprofiles, we recapitulate our experimental findings. We examine the role of a\n$\\textit{V. cholerae}$ strain's frequency, its relative efficacy at killing\ncompetitors, and the initial concentration of cells in the droplet in\ndetermining the outcome of competition. By scaling from individual cellular\ninteractions to overall changes in strain frequency, our work demonstrates how\nthe coffee-ring effect plays a powerful role in structuring microbial\ncommunities, indirectly driving ecological changes in community composition.\n", "  Conservation laws are formulated for systems of differential equations by\nusing symmetries and adjoint symmetries, and an application to systems of\nevolution equations is made, together with illustrative examples. The\nformulation does not require the existence of a Lagrangian for a given system,\nand the presented examples include computations of conserved densities for the\nheat equation, Burgers' equation and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\n", "  We demonstrate the strong coupling of both magnons and phonons to terahertz\n(THz) frequency electromagnetic (EM) waves confined to a photonic crystal (PhC)\ncavity. Our cavity consists of a two-dimensional array of air-holes cut into a\nhybrid slab of ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$) and erbium\northoferrite (ErFeO$_3$), a canted antiferromagnetic crystal. The phonons in\nLiNbO$_3$ and the magnons in ErFeO$_3$ are strongly coupled to the electric and\nmagnetic field components of the confined EM wave, respectively. This leads to\nthe formation of new cavity magnon-phonon-polariton modes, which we\nexperimentally observe as a normal-mode splitting in the frequency spectrum and\nan avoided crossing in the temperature-frequency plot. The cavity also has a\nmode volume of $V=3.4\\times10^{-3}\\lambda^3\\simeq0.5(\\lambda/n)^3$ $\\mu$m$^3$\nand can achieve a Q-factor as high as 1000. These factors facilitate the\npursuit of the fields of THz cavity spintronics and quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have\nbeen employed to investigate the structural, electronic, and gas-sensing\nproperties of pure, defected, and doped germanene nanosheets. Our calculations\nhave revealed that while a pristine germanene nanosheet adsorbs CO2 weakly, H2S\nmoderately, and SO2 strongly, the introduction of vacancy defects increases the\nsensitivity significantly which is promising for future gas-sensing\napplications.Mulliken population analysis imparts that an appreciable amount of\ncharge transfer occurs between gas molecules and a germanene nanosheet which\nsupports our results for adsorption energies of the systems. The enhancement of\nthe interactions between gas molecules and the germanene nanosheet has been\nfurther investigated by density of states.Projected density of states provides\ndetailed insight of the gas molecules contribution in the gas-sensing\nsystem.Additionally, the influences of substituted dopant atoms such as B, N,\nand Al in the germanene nanosheet have also been considered to study the impact\non its gas sensing ability. There was no significant improvement found in doped\ngas sensing capability of germanene over the vacancy defects, except for CO2\nupon adsorption on N-doped germanene.\n", "  Complex oxide systems have attracted considerable attention because of their\nfascinating properties, including the magnetic ordering at the conducting\ninterface between two band insulators, such as LaAlO3 (LAO) and SrTiO3 (STO).\nHowever, the manipulation of the spin degree of freedom at the LAO/STO\nheterointerface has remained elusive. Here, we have fabricated hybrid magnetic\ntunnel junctions consisting of Co and LAO/STO ferromagnets with the insertion\nof a Ti layer in between, which clearly exhibit magnetic switching and the\ntunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect below 10 K. The magnitude and the of\nthe TMR are strongly dependent on the direction of the rotational magnetic\nfield parallel to the LAO/STO plane, which is attributed to a strong\nRashba-type spin orbit coupling in the LAO/STO heterostructure. Our study\nprovides a further support for the existence of the macroscopic ferromagnetism\nat LAO/STO heterointerfaces and opens a novel route to realize interfacial\nspintronics devices.\n", "  We detect and characterise extended, diffuse radio emission from galaxy\nclusters at 168 MHz within the Epoch of Reionization 0-hour field; a $45^\\circ\n\\times 45^\\circ$ region of the southern sky centred on R. A. $= 0^\\circ$, decl.\n$=-27^\\circ$. We detect 31 diffuse radio sources; 3 of which are newly detected\nhaloes in Abell 0141, Abell 2811, and Abell S1121; 2 newly detected relics in\nAbell 0033 and Abell 2751; 5 new halo candidates and a further 5 new relic\ncandidates. Further, we detect a new phoenix candidate in Abell 2556 as well as\n2 candidate dead radio galaxies at the centres of Abell 0122 and Abell S1136\nlikely associated with the brightest cluster galaxies. Beyond this we find 2\nclusters with unclassifiable, diffuse steep-spectrum emission as well as a\ncandidate double relic system associated with RXC J2351.0-1934. We present\nmeasured source properties such as their integrated flux densities, spectral\nindices, and sizes where possible. We find several of the diffuse sources to be\nultra-steep including the halo in Abell 0141 which has $\\alpha \\leq -2.1 \\pm\n0.1$ making it one of the steepest halos known. Finally, we compare our sample\nof haloes with previously detected haloes and revisit established scaling\nrelations of the radio halo power ($P_{1.4}$) with the cluster X-ray luminosity\n($L_{\\mathrm{X}}$) and mass ($M_{500}$). We find consistent fitting parameters\nfor assumed power law relationships, and find that the $P_{1.4}-L_{\\mathrm{X}}$\nhas less raw scatter than the corresponding $P_{1.4}-M_{500}$ despite\ninhomogeneous $L_{\\mathrm{X}}$ measurements. These scaling relation properties\nare consistent with a sample of only non-cool core clusters hosting radio\nhaloes.\n", "  We discuss Kondo phenomena in a seven-orbital impurity Anderson model\nhybridized with $\\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons by employing a numerical\nrenormalization group method. In particular, we focus on the case with three\nlocal $f$ electrons, corresponding to a Nd$^{3+}$ ion. For realistic values of\nCoulomb interactions, spin-orbit coupling, cubic crystalline electric field\npotentials, and hybridization, we find a residual entropy of $0.5\\log 2$, a\ncharacteristic of two-channel Kondo phenomena, for the wide range of parameters\nof the local $\\Gamma_6$ ground state. This is considered to be the magnetic\ntwo-channel Kondo effect, consistent with the result from an extended $s$-$d$\nmodel constructed on the basis of the $j$-$j$ coupling scheme. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss candidates of Nd compounds to observe the two-channel Kondo\neffect.\n", "  The coordinate Bethe Ansatz solution of the log-gamma polymer is extended to\nboundary conditions with one fixed end and the other attached to one half of a\none-dimensional lattice. The large-time limit is studied using a saddle-point\napproximation,and the cumulative distribution function of the rescaled free\nenergy of a long polymer is expressed as a Fredholm determinant. Scaling limits\nof the kernel are identified, leading to a crossover from the GUE to the GOE\nTracy--Widom distributions. The continuum limit reproduces the crossover from\ndroplet to flat initial conditions of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation.\n", "  A path integral on a link complement of a three-sphere fixes a vector (the\n\"link state\") in Chern-Simons theory. The link state can be written in a\ncertain basis with the colored link invariants as its coefficients. We use\nsymmetric webs to systematically compute the colored link invariants, by which\nwe can write down the multi-partite entangled state of any given link. It is\nstill unknown if a product state necessarily implies that the corresponding\ncomponents are unlinked, and we leave it as a conjecture.\n", "  We study solutions of the Friedmann equations in case of the homogeneous\nisotropic Universe filled with a perfect fluid. The main points concern the\nmonotony properties of the solutions, the possibility to extend the solutions\non all times and occurrence of singularities. We present a qualitative\nclassification of all possible solutions in case of the general smooth\nbarotropic equation of state of the fluid, provided the speed of sound is\nfinite. The list of possible scenarios includes analogs of the \"Big Rip\" in the\nfuture and/or in the past as well as singularity free solutions and oscillating\nUniverses. Extensions of the results to the multicomponent fluids are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In nuclei with valence nucleons are say identical nucleons and say these\nnucleons occupy several-$j$ orbits, then it is possible to consider pair\ncreation operator $S_+$ to be a sum of the single-$j$ shell pair creation\noperators $S_+(j)$ with arbitrary phases, $S_+=\\sum_j \\alpha_j S_+(j);\n\\alpha_j=\\pm 1$. In this situation, it is possible to define multi-orbit or\ngeneralized seniority that corresponds to the quasi-spin $SU(2)$ algebra\ngenerated by $S_+$, $S_-=(S_+)^\\dagger$ and $S_0=(\\hat{n} -\\Omega)/2$\noperators; $\\hat{n}$ is number operator and $\\Omega=[\\sum_j (2j+1)]/2$. There\nare now multiple pairing quasi-spin $SU(2)$ algebras. Also, the $\\alpha_j$'s\nand the generators of the corresponding generalized seniority generating\nsympletic algebras $Sp(2\\Omega)$ in $U(2\\Omega) \\supset Sp(2\\Omega)$ have\none-to-one correspondence. Using these, derived are the special seniority\nselection rules for electromagnetic transitions. A particular choice for\n$\\alpha_j$'s as advocated by Arvieu and Moszkowski (AM) in the past gives\npairing Hamiltonians having maximum correlation with well known effective\ninteractions. The various results derived for identical fermion systems are\nshown to extend to identical boson systems with the bosons occupying\nseveral-$\\ell$ orbits as for example in $sd$, $sp$, $sdg$ and $sdpf$ IBM's. The\nquasi-spin algebra here is $SU(1,1)$ and the generalized seniority quantum\nnumber is generated by $SO(2\\Omega)$ in $U(2\\Omega) \\supset SO(2\\Omega)$. The\ndifferent $SO(2\\Omega)$ algebras here will be important in the study of quantum\nphase transitions and order-chaos transitions in nuclei.\n", "  Ultrathin two-dimensional nanosheets raise a rapidly increasing interest due\nto their unique dimensionality-dependent properties. Most of the\ntwo-dimensional materials are obtained by exfoliation of layered bulk materials\nor are grown on substrates by vapor deposition methods. To produce\nfree-standing nanosheets, solution-based colloidal methods are emerging as\npromising routes. In this work, we demonstrate ultrathin CdSe nanosheets with\ncontrollable size, shape and phase. The key of our approach is the use of\nhalogenated alkanes as additives in a hot-injection synthesis. Increasing\nconcentrations of bromoalkanes can tune the shape from sexangular to\nquadrangular to triangular and the phase from zinc blende to wurtzite. Geometry\nand crystal structure evolution of the nanosheets take place in the presence of\nhalide ions, acting as cadmium complexing agents and as surface X-type ligands,\naccording to mass spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies. Our\nexperimental findings show that the degree of these changes depends on the\nmolecular structure of the halogen alkanes and the type of halogen atom.\n", "  The fluid-mechanics community is currently divided in assessing the\nboundaries of applicability of the macroscopic approach to fluid mechanical\nproblems. Can the dynamics of nano-droplets be described by the same\nmacroscopic equations as the ones used for macro-droplets? To the greatest\ndegree, this question should be addressed to the moving contact-line problem.\nThe problem is naturally multiscale, where even using a slip boundary condition\nresults in spurious numerical solutions and transcendental stagnation regions\nin modelling in the vicinity of the contact line. In this publication, it has\nbeen demonstrated via the mutual comparison between macroscopic modelling and\nmolecular dynamics simulations that a small, albeit natural, change in the\nboundary conditions is all that is necessary to completely regularize the\nproblem and eliminate these nonphysical effects. The limits of macroscopic\napproach applied to the moving contact-line problem have been tested and\nvalidated from the first microscopic principles of molecular dynamic\nsimulations.\n", "  In this paper, a cost-effective prototype data acquisition system\nspecifically designed for Schumann resonance measurements and an adequate\nsignal processing method are described in detail. The implemented system\ncaptures the magnetic component of the Schumann resonance signal, using a\nmagnetic antenna, at much higher sampling rates than the Nyquist rate for\nefficient signal improvement. In order to obtain the characteristics of the\nindividual resonances of the SR spectrum a new and efficient software was\ndeveloped. The processing techniques used in this software are analyzed\nthoroughly in the following. Evaluation of system's performance and operation\nis realized using preliminary measurements taken in the region of Northwest\nGreece.\n", "  Generalizations of classical theta functions are proposed that include any\neven number of analytic parameters for which conditions of quasi-periodicity\nare fulfilled and that are representations of extended Heisenberg group.\nDifferential equations for generalized theta functions and finite non-unitary\nrepresentations of extended Heisenberg group are presented so as other\nproperties and possible applications are pointed out such as a projective\nembedding of tori by means of generalized theta functions.\n", "  Chaos associated with bifurcation makes a new science, but the origin and\nessence of chaos are not yet clear. Based on the well-known logistic map, chaos\nused to be regarded as intrinsic randomicity of determinate dynamics systems.\nHowever, urbanization dynamics indicates new explanation about it. Using\nmathematical derivation, numerical computation, and empirical analysis, we can\nexplore chaotic dynamics of urbanization. The key is the formula of\nurbanization level. The urbanization curve can be described with the logistic\nfunction, which can be transformed into 1-dimensional map and thus produce\nbifurcation and chaos. On the other hand, the logistic model of urbanization\ncurve can be derived from the rural-urban population interaction model, and the\nrural-urban interaction model can be discretized to a 2-dimensional map. An\ninteresting finding is that the 2-dimensional rural-urban coupling map can\ncreate the same bifurcation and chaos patterns as those from the 1-dimensional\nlogistic map. This suggests that the urban bifurcation and chaos come from\nspatial interaction between rural and urban population rather than pure\nintrinsic randomicity of determinate models. This discovery provides a new way\nof looking at origin and essence of bifurcation and chaos. By analogy with\nurbanization models, the classical predator-prey interaction model can be\ndeveloped to interpret the complex dynamics of the logistic map in physical and\nsocial sciences.\n", "  It is widely believed that the Hawking effect might hold clues to the\npossible, yet unknown, trans-Planckian physics. On the other hand, one could\nask whether the effect itself might be altered by such trans-Planckian physics.\nWe seek an answer to this question within a framework where matter field is\nquantized using polymer quantization, a canonical quantization technique\nemployed in loop quantum gravity. We provide an exact derivation of the Hawking\neffect using canonical formulation by introducing a set of near-null\ncoordinates which allows one to overcome the challenges posed by a\nHamiltonian-based derivation of the Hawking effect. Subsequently, we show that\nin polymer quantization the Hawking effect is short-lived and it eventually\ndisappears for an asymptotic future observer. Such an observer finds the\nduration of the Hawking effect to be few milliseconds for a solar mass black\nhole whereas it is few years for an ultra-massive black hole. Consequently, it\nprovides a new way to resolve the so-called information loss paradox.\n", "  Urban structure detection is a basic task in urban geography. Clustering is a\ncore technology to detect the patterns of urban spatial structure, urban\nfunctional region, and so on. In big data era, diverse urban sensing datasets\nrecording information like human behaviour and human social activity, suffer\nfrom complexity in high dimension and high noise. And unfortunately, the\nstate-of-the-art clustering methods does not handle the problem with high\ndimension and high noise issues concurrently. In this paper, a probabilistic\nembedding clustering method is proposed. Firstly, we come up with a\nProbabilistic Embedding Model (PEM) to find latent features from high\ndimensional urban sensing data by learning via probabilistic model. By latent\nfeatures, we could catch essential features hidden in high dimensional data\nknown as patterns; with the probabilistic model, we can also reduce uncertainty\ncaused by high noise. Secondly, through tuning the parameters, our model could\ndiscover two kinds of urban structure, the homophily and structural\nequivalence, which means communities with intensive interaction or in the same\nroles in urban structure. We evaluated the performance of our model by\nconducting experiments on real-world data and experiments with real data in\nShanghai (China) proved that our method could discover two kinds of urban\nstructure, the homophily and structural equivalence, which means clustering\ncommunity with intensive interaction or under the same roles in urban space.\n", "  Integration of active matter in larger micro-devices can provide an embedded\nsource of propulsion and lead to self-actuated micromachining systems that do\nnot rely on any external power or control apparatus. Here we demonstrate that\nJanus colloids can self-assemble around micro-fabricated rotors in reproducible\nconfigurations with a high degree of spatial and orientational order. The final\nconfiguration maximizes the torque applied on the rotor leading to a\nunidirectional and steady rotating motion. We discuss how the interplay between\ngeometry and dynamical behavior consistently leads to the self-assembly of\nautonomous micromotors starting from randomly distributed building blocks.\n", "  We study the behavior of the soliton which, while moving in non-dissipative\nmedium encounters a barrier with finite dissipation. The modelling included the\ncase of a finite dissipative layer similar to a wave passing through the\nair-glass-air as well as a wave passing from a non-dissipative layer into a\ndissipative one (similar to the passage of light from air to water).\n  The dissipation predictably results in reducing the soliton\namplitude/velocity, but some new effects occur in the case of finite barrier on\nthe soliton path: after the wave leaves the dissipative barrier it retains a\nsoliton form, yet a reflection wave arises as small and quasi-harmonic\noscillations (a breather). The breather spreads faster than the soliton as\nmoves through the barrier.\n", "  The study of chemically peculiar (CP) stars in open clusters provides\nvaluable information about their evolutionary status. Their detection can be\nperformed using the $\\Delta a$ photometric system, which maps a characteristic\nflux depression at $\\lambda \\sim 5200$ \\AA. This paper aims at studying the\noccurrence of CP stars in the earliest stages of evolution of a stellar\npopulation by applying this technique to Hogg 16, a very young Galactic open\ncluster (about 25 Myr). We identified several peculiar candidates: two B-type\nstars with a negative $\\Delta a$ index (CD-60 4701, CPD-60 4706) are likely\nemission-line (Be) stars, even though spectral measurements are necessary for a\nproper classification of the second one; a third object (CD-60 4703),\nidentified as a Be candidate in literature, appears to be a background B-type\nsupergiant with no significant $\\Delta a$ index, which does not rule out the\npossibility that it is indeed peculiar as the normality line of $\\Delta a$ for\nsupergiants has not been studied in detail yet. A fourth object (CD-60 4699)\nappears to be a magnetic CP star of 8 M$_\\odot$, but obtained spectral data\nseem to rule out this hypothesis. Three more magnetic CP star candidates are\nfound in the domain of early F-type stars. One is a probable nonmember and\nclose to the border of significance, but the other two are probably pre-main\nsequence cluster objects. This is very promising, as it can lead to very strong\nconstraints to the diffusion theory. Finally, we derived the fundamental\nparameters of Hogg 16 and provide for the first time an estimate of its metal\ncontent.\n", "  Magnonics, i.e. the artificial manipulation of spin waves, is a flourishing\nfield of research with many potential uses in data processing within reach.\nApart from the technological applications the possibility to directly influence\nand observe these types of waves is of great interest for fundamental research.\nGuidance and steering of spin waves has been previously shown and lateral spin\nwave confinement has been achieved. However, true spin wave focusing with both\nlateral confinement and increase in amplitude has not been shown before. Here,\nwe show for the first time spin wave focusing by realizing a Fresnel zone plate\ntype lens. Using x-ray microscopy we are able to directly image the propagation\nof spin waves into the nanometer sized focal spot. Furthermore, we observe that\nthe focal spot can be freely moved in a large area by small variations of the\nbias field. Thus, this type of lens provides a steerable intense nanometer\nsized spin wave source. Potentially, this could be used to selectively\nilluminate magnonic devices like nano oscillators with a steerable spin wave\nbeam.\n", "  Manipulation of thin sheets by folding and cutting offers opportunity to\nengineer structures with novel mechanical properties, and to prescribe complex\nforce-displacement relationships via material elasticity in combination with\nthe trajectory imposed by the fold topology. We study the mechanics of cellular\nKirigami that rotates upon compression, which we call Flexigami; the addition\nof diagonal cuts to an equivalent closed cell permits its reversible collapse\nwithout incurring significant tensile strains in its panels. Using\nfinite-element modeling and experiment we show how the mechanics of flexigami\nis governed by the coupled rigidity of the panels and hinges and we design\nflexigami to achieve reversible force response ranging from smooth\nmono-stability to sharp bi-stability. We then demonstrate the use of flexigami\nto construct laminates with multi-stable behavior, a rotary-linear boom\nactuator, and self-deploying cells with activated hinges. Advanced digital\nfabrication methods can enable the practical use of flexigami and other\nmetamaterials that share its underlying principles, for applications such as\nmorphing structures, soft robotics and medical devices.\n", "  We demonstrate a new paradigm for the wireless harvesting of mechanical\nenergy via a 3D-printed triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) which comprises a\ngraphene polylactic acid (gPLA) nanocomposite and Teflon. The synergistic\ncombination of eco-friendly PLA with graphene in our TENG exhibited an output\nvoltage > 2 kV with an instantaneous peak power of 70 mW, which in turn\ngenerated a strong electric field to enable the wireless transmission of\nharvested energy over a distance of 3 m. Specifically, we demonstrate wireless\nand secure actuatation of smart-home applications such as smart tint windows,\ntemperature sensors, liquid crystal displays, and security alarms either with a\nsingle or a specific user-defined passcode of mechanical pulses (e.g.,\nFibonacci sequence). Notably, such high electric output of a gPLA-based TENG\nenabled unprecedented wireless transmission of harvested mechanical energy into\na capacitor, thus obviating the need for additional electronics or energy\nsources. The scalable additive manufacturing approach for gPLA-based TENGs,\nalong with their high electrical output can revolutionize the present method of\nharnessing the mechanical energy available in our environment.\n", "  We develop new optimization methodology for planning installation of Flexible\nAlternating Current Transmission System (FACTS) devices of the parallel and\nshunt types into large power transmission systems, which allows to delay or\navoid installations of generally much more expensive power lines. Methodology\ntakes as an input projected economic development, expressed through a paced\ngrowth of the system loads, as well as uncertainties, expressed through\nmultiple scenarios of the growth. We price new devices according to their\ncapacities. Installation cost contributes to the optimization objective in\ncombination with the cost of operations integrated over time and averaged over\nthe scenarios. The multi-stage (-time-frame) optimization aims to achieve a\ngradual distribution of new resources in space and time. Constraints on the\ninvestment budget, or equivalently constraint on building capacity, is\nintroduced at each time frame. Our approach adjusts operationally not only\nnewly installed FACTS devices but also other already existing flexible degrees\nof freedom. This complex optimization problem is stated using the most general\nAC Power Flows. Non-linear, non-convex, multiple-scenario and multi-time-frame\noptimization is resolved via efficient heuristics, consisting of a sequence of\nalternating Linear Programmings or Quadratic Programmings (depending on the\ngeneration cost) and AC-PF solution steps designed to maintain operational\nfeasibility for all scenarios. Computational scalability and application of the\nnewly developed approach is illustrated on the example of the 2736-nodes large\nPolish system. One most important advantage of the framework is that the\noptimal capacity of FACTS is build up gradually at each time frame in a limited\nnumber of locations, thus allowing to prepare the system better for possible\ncongestion due to future economic and other uncertainties.\n", "  As a generalization of the two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D FT) and 2D\nfractional Fourier transform, the 2D nonseparable linear canonical transform\n(2D NsLCT) is useful in optics, signal and image processing. To reduce the\ndigital implementation complexity of the 2D NsLCT, some previous works\ndecomposed the 2D NsLCT into several low-complexity operations, including 2D\nFT, 2D chirp multiplication (2D CM) and 2D affine transformations. However, 2D\naffine transformations will introduce interpolation error. In this paper, we\npropose a new decomposition called CM-CC-CM-CC decomposition, which decomposes\nthe 2D NsLCT into two 2D CMs and two 2D chirp convolutions (2D CCs). No 2D\naffine transforms are involved. Simulation results show that the proposed\nmethods have higher accuracy, lower computational complexity and smaller error\nin the additivity property compared with the previous works. Plus, the proposed\nmethods have perfect reversibility property that one can reconstruct the input\nsignal/image losslessly from the output.\n", "  As an extension of the 2D fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) and a special\ncase of the 2D linear canonical transform (LCT), the gyrator transform was\nintroduced to produce rotations in twisted space/spatial-frequency planes. It\nis a useful tool in optics, signal processing and image processing. In this\npaper, we develop discrete gyrator transforms (DGTs) based on the 2D LCT.\nTaking the advantage of the additivity property of the 2D LCT, we propose three\nkinds of DGTs, each of which is a cascade of low-complexity operators. These\nDGTs have different constraints, characteristics, and properties, and are\nrealized by different computational algorithms. Besides, we propose a kind of\nDGT based on the eigenfunctions of the gyrator transform. This DGT is an\northonormal transform, and thus its comprehensive properties, especially the\nadditivity property, make it more useful in many applications. We also develop\nan efficient computational algorithm to significantly reduce the complexity of\nthis DGT. At the end, a brief review of some important applications of the DGTs\nis presented, including mode conversion, sampling and reconstruction,\nwatermarking, and image encryption.\n", "  Engineering multiphoton states is an outstanding challenge with applications\nin multiple fields, such as quan- tum metrology, quantum lithography or even\nbiological systems. State-of-the-art methods to obtain them rely on\npost-selection, multi-level systems or Rydberg atomic ensembles. Recently, it\nwas shown that a strongly driven two-level system interacting with a detuned\ncavity mode can be engineered to continuously emit n-photon states. In the\npresent work, we show that spectral filtering of its emission relaxes\nconsiderably the requirements on the system parameters even to the more\naccessible bad-cavity situation, opening up the possibility of implementing\nthis protocol in a much wider landscape of different platforms. This\nimprovement is based on a key observation: in the imperfect case where only a\ncertain fraction of emission is composed of n-photon states, these have a well\ndefined energy separated from the rest of the signal, which allows to reveal\nand purify multiphoton emission just by frequency filtering. We demonstrate\nthese results by obtaining analytical expressions for relevant figures of merit\nof multiphoton emission, such as the n-photon coupling rate between cavity and\nemitter, the fraction of light emitted as n-photon states, and n-photon\nemission rates. This allows us to make a systematic study of such figures of\nmerit as a function of the system parameters and demonstrate the viability of\nthe protocol in several relevant types of cavity QED setups, where we take into\naccount the impact of their respective experimental limitations.\n", "  Explicit separability of general two qubits density matrices is related to\nLorentz transformations. We use the 4-dimensional form R(u,v=0,1,2,3) of the\nHilbert-Schmidt (HS) decomposition of the density matrix. For the generic case\nin which Lorentz transformations diagonalize R(u,v=0,1,2,3) (into\ns(0),s(1),s(2),s(3)) we give relations between the R parameters and the s\nparameters. In particular we consider two cases: a) Two qubits density matrices\nwith one pair of linear terms in the HS decomposition. b) Two qubits density\nmatrices with two or three symmetric pairs of linear terms. Some of the\ntheoretical results are demonstrated by numerical calculations. The four\nnon-generic cases (which may be reduced to case a) are analyzed and the\nnon-generic property is related explicitly to Lorentz velocity beta=1 which is\nnot reachable physically\n", "  In this paper, we investigate a class of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory of\ngravity for warm inflation. We present some models where the early-time\nacceleration is realized in the weak and in the strong dissipation regime.\nCosmological perturbations are analyzed.\n", "  A quark model with general Yang-Mills $SU_3$ symmetry leads to fourth-order\nfield equations and linear confining potential. The confining gauge bosons\n(`confions') are treated as off-mass-shell particles and their indefinite\nenergies are unobservable due to confinement. The ultraviolet divergence of the\nmodel appears to be no worse than that of QCD by power counting. Explicit\ncalculations of the confion self-energy show that the usual Faddeev-Popov\nghosts are inadequate to restore gauge symmetry for gauge invariant Lagrangians\nwith higher order derivatives. `Computer experiments' with FeynCalc lead to a\nsimple empirical method to restore the gauge invariance of the second-order\nconfion self-energy with arbitrary gauge parameters. The approximate results of\nthird-order vertex corrections suggest that the confining model could be\nasymptotically free.\n", "  Compton scattering is one of the promising probe to quantitate of the Li\nunder in-operando condition, since high-energy X-rays which have high\npenetration power into the materials are used as incident beam and Compton\nscattered energy spectrum have specific line-shape by the elements. We develop\nin-operando quantitation method of Li composition in the electrodes by using\nline-shape (Sparameter) analysis of Compton scattered energy spectrum. In this\nstudy, we apply S-parameter analysis to commercial coin cell Li-ion\nrechargeable battery and obtain the variation of S-parameters during\ncharge/discharge cycle at positive and negative electrodes. By using\ncalibration curves for Li composition in the electrodes, we determine the\nchange of Li composition of positive and negative electrodes through\nS-parameters, simultaneously.\n", "  Two fundamental problems for extraterrestrial intelligences (ETIs) attempting\nto establish interstellar communication are timing and energy consumption.\nHumanity's study of exoplanets via their transit across the host star\nhighlights a means of solving both problems. An ETI 'A' can communicate with\nETI 'B' if B is observing transiting planets in A's star system, either by\nbuilding structures to produce artificial transits observable by B, or by\nemitting signals at B during transit, at significantly lower energy consumption\nthan typical electromagnetic transmission schemes.\n  This can produce a network of interconnected civilisations, establishing\ncontact via observing each other's transits. Assuming that civilisations reside\nin a Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ), I conduct Monte Carlo Realisation\nsimulations of the establishment and growth of this network, and analyse its\nproperties in the context of graph theory.\n  I find that at any instant, only a few civilisations are correctly aligned to\ncommunicate via transits. However, we should expect the true network to be\ncumulative, where a \"handshake\" connection at any time guarantees connection in\nthe future via e.g. electromagnetic signals. In all our simulations, the\ncumulative network connects all civilisations together in a complete network.\nIf civilisations share knowledge of their network connections, the network can\nbe fully complete on timescales of order a hundred thousand years. Once\nestablished, this network can connect any two civilisations either directly, or\nvia intermediate civilisations, with a path much less than the dimensions of\nthe GHZ.\n", "  In uniaxial soft matter with a reorientational nonlinearity, such as nematic\nliquid crystals, a light beam in the extraordinary polarization walks off its\nwavevector due to birefringence, while it undergoes self-focusing via an\nincrease in refractive index and eventually forms a spatial soliton. Hereby the\ntrajectory evolution of solitons in nematic liquid crystals- nematicons- in the\npresence of a linearly varying transverse orientation of the optic axis is\nanalysed. In this study we use and compare two approaches: i) a slowly varying\n(adiabatic) approximation based on momentum conservation of the soliton in a\nHamiltonian sense; ii) the Frank-Oseen elastic theory coupled with a fully\nvectorial and nonlinear beam propagation method. The models provide comparable\nresults in such a non-homogeneously oriented uniaxial medium and predict curved\nsoliton paths with either monotonic or non-monotonic curvatures. The minimal\npower needed to excite a solitary wave via reorientation remains essentially\nthe same in both uniform and modulated cases.\n", "  The observation of distinct peaks in tokamak core reflectometry measurements\n- named quasi-coherent-modes (QCMs) - are identified as a signature of\nTrapped-Electron-Mode (TEM) turbulence [H. Arnichand et al. 2016 Plasma Phys.\nControl. Fusion 58 014037]. This phenomenon is investigated with detailed\nlinear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations using the \\gene code. A Tore-Supra\ndensity scan is studied, which traverses through a Linear (LOC) to Saturated\n(SOC) Ohmic Confinement transition. The LOC and SOC phases are both simulated\nseparately. In the LOC phase, where QCMs are observed, TEMs are robustly\npredicted unstable in linear studies. In the later SOC phase, where QCMs are no\nlonger observed, ITG modes are identified. In nonlinear simulations, in the ITG\n(SOC) phase, a broadband spectrum is seen. In the TEM (LOC) phase, a clear\nemergence of a peak at the TEM frequencies is seen. This is due to reduced\nnonlinear frequency broadening of the underlying linear modes in the TEM regime\ncompared with the ITG regime. A synthetic diagnostic of the nonlinearly\nsimulated frequency spectra reproduces the features observed in the\nreflectometry measurements. These results support the identification of core\nQCMs as an experimental marker for TEM turbulence\n", "  Some Bravais lattices have a particular geometry that can slow down the\nmotion of Bloch electrons by pre-localization due to the band-structure\nproperties. Another known source of electronic localization in solids is the\nCoulomb repulsion in partially filled d- or f-orbitals, which leads to the\nformation of local magnetic moments. The combination of these two effects is\nusually considered of little relevance to strongly correlated materials. Here\nwe show that it represents, instead, the underlying physical mechanism in two\nof the most important ferromagnets: nickel and iron. In nickel, the van Hove\nsingularity has an unexpected impact on the magnetism. As a result, the\nelectron-electron scattering rate is linear in temperature, in violation of the\nconventional Landau theory of metals. This is true even at Earth's core\npressures, at which iron is instead a good Fermi liquid. The importance of\nnickel in models of geomagnetism may have therefore to be reconsidered.\n", "  We extend Guderley's problem of finding a self-similar scaling solution for a\nconverging cylindrical or spherical shock wave from the ideal gas case to the\ncase of flows with an arbitrary equation of state closure model, giving\nnecessary conditions for the existence of a solution. The necessary condition\nis a thermodynamic one, namely that the adiabatic bulk modulus, $K_S$, of the\nfluid be of the form $pf(\\rho)$ where $p$ is pressure, $\\rho$ is mass density,\nand $f$ is an arbitrary function. Although this condition has appeared in the\nliterature before, here we give a more rigorous and extensive treatment. Of\nparticular interest is our novel analysis of the governing ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs), which shows that, in general, the Guderley\nproblem is always an eigenvalue problem. The need for an eigenvalue arises from\nbasic shock stability principles -- an interesting connection to the existing\nliterature on the relationship between self-similarity of the second kind and\nstability. We also investigate a special case, usually neglected by previous\nauthors, where assuming constant shock velocity yields a reduction to ODEs for\nevery material, but those ODEs never have a bounded, differentiable solution.\nThis theoretical work is motivated by the need for more realistic test problems\nin the verification of inviscid compressible flow codes that simulate flows in\na variety of non-ideal gas materials.\n", "  Control of light by an external magnetic field is one of the important\nmethods for modulation of its intensity and polarisation. Magneto-optical\neffects at the nanoscale are usually observed in magnetophotonic crystals,\nnanostructured hybrid materials or magnetoplasmonic crystals. An indirect\naction of an external magnetic field (e.g. through the Faraday effect) is\nexplained by the fact that natural materials exhibit negligible magnetism at\noptical frequencies. However, the concept of metamaterials overcome this\nlimitation imposed by nature by designing artificial subwavelength meta-atoms\nthat support a strong magnetic response, usually termed as optical magnetism,\neven when they are made of nonmagnetic materials. The fundamental question is\nwhat would be the effect of the interaction between an external magnetic field\nand an optically-induced magnetic response of metamaterial structures. Here we\nmake the first step toward answering this fundamental question and demonstrate\nthe multifold enhancement of the magneto-optical response of nanoantenna\nlattices due to the optical magnetism.\n", "  Solubility of dyes in amphiphilic association structures of water, SDS and\npenthanol system (i.e. in the phases of microemulsions and liquid crystals) was\nattracted much interest due to its wide industrial and technological\napplications. This research was focused on understanding the solubility\nlimitation of methyl red and methylene blue in microemulsion and liquid crystal\nphases. Experimental results showed that the highest solubility of methyl red\nwas in LLC, followed by w/o microemulsion and o/w microemulsion, respectively,\nwhereas the highest solubility of methylene blue was in w/o microemulsion,\nfollowed by o/w microemulsion and LLC, respectively. Hence, a chemical dynamics\nstrongly played an important role in the solubility limitation of methyl red\nand methylene blue in microemulsions and liquid crystal phases.\n", "  This is the second part of the notes to the course on quantum theory of large\nsystems of non-relativistic matter taught by J. Fr\\\"{o}hlich at the 1994 Les\nHouches summer school. It is devoted to a sketchy exposition of some of the\nbeautiful and important, recent results of J.Feldman and E.Trubowitz, and J.\nFeldman, H. Kn\\\"{o}rrer, D. Lehmann, J. Magnen, V. Rivasseau and E. Trubowitz.\nTheir results are about a mathematical analysis of non-relativistic many-body\ntheory, in particular of the Landau-Fermi liquid and BCS superconductivity,\nusing Wilson's renormalization group methods and the techniques of the\n$1/N$-expansion. While their work is ultimately aimed at a complete\nmathematical control (beyond perturbative expansions) of systems of weakly\ncoupled electron gases at positive density and small or zero temperature, we\ncan only illustrate some of their ideas within the context of perturbative\nsolutions of Wilson-type renormalization group flow equations (we calculate\nleading-order terms in a $1/N$-expansion, where $N$ is an energy scale) and of\none-loop effective potential calculations of the BCS superconducting ground\nstate.
