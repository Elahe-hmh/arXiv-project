plane with\nidentical rectangular scatterers disposed at each integer point. We prove that\nindependently of the size of the scatterers, generically with respect to the\nangle, the polynomial diffusion rate in this billiard is 2/3.\n", "  Leaves of vascular plants are arranged regularly around stems, a phenomenon\nknown as phyllotaxis. A constant angle between two successive leaves is called\ndivergence angle. On the one side, the divergence angle $\\alpha_0$ of an\ninitial pattern of leaf primordia at a shoot apex is most commonly an\nirrational number of about 137.5 degrees, called limit divergence. On the other\nside, the divergence $\\alpha$ of a final pattern of leaf traces in the vascular\nsystem of a mature stem is expressed in terms of a sequence of rational\nnumbers, 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13, 8/21, called phyllotactic fractions. The\nmathematical relationship between the initial divergence $\\alpha_0$, the final\ndivergence $\\alpha$, and the number of internodes traversed by the leaf traces\n$n_c$ is investigated by means of a theoretical model of vascular phyllotaxis.\nIt is shown that continuous changes of the trace length $n_c$ induce\ntransitions between the fractional orders in the vascular structure. The\nvascular phyllotaxis transition suggests an evolutionary mechanism for the\nphenomenon of phyllotaxis. To provide supporting evidence for the model and\nmechanism, available experimental results for fossil remains of Lepidodendron\nand the vascular structure of Linum and Populus are analyzed with the model.\n", "  We study the problem of inviscid slightly compressible fluids in a bounded\ndomain. We find a unique solution to the initial-boundary value problem and\nshow that it is near the analogous solution for an incompressible fluid\nprovided the initial conditions for the two problems are close. In particular,\nthe divergence of the initial velocity of the compressible flow at time zero is\nassumed to be small. Furthermore we find that solutions to the compressible\nmotion problem in Lagrangian coordinates depend differentiably on their initial\ndata, an unexpected result for this type of non-linear equations.\n", "  In this paper, we describe several different meanings for the concept of\nGibbs measure on the lattice $\\mathbb{N}$ in the context of finite alphabets\n(or state space). We compare and analyze these \"in principle\" distinct notions:\nDLR-Gibbs measures, Thermodynamic Limit and eigenprobabilities for the dual of\nthe Ruelle operator (also called conformal measures).\n  Among other things we extended the classical notion of a Gibbsian\nspecification on $\\mathbb{N}$ in such way that the similarity of many results\nin Statistical Mechanics and Dynamical System becomes apparent. One of our main\nresult claims that the construction of the conformal Measures in Dynamical\nSystems for Walters potentials, using the Ruelle operator, can be formulated in\nterms of Specification. We also describe the Ising model, with\n$1/r^{2+\\varepsilon}$ interaction energy, in the Thermodynamic Formalism\nsetting and prove that its associated potential is in Walters space - we\npresent an explicit expression. We also provide an alternative way for\nobtaining the uniqueness of the DLR-Gibbs measures.\n", "  The optimal efficiency of quantum (or classical) heat engines whose heat\nbaths are $n$-particle systems is given by the information geometry and the\nstrong large deviation. We give the optimal work extraction process as a\nconcrete energy-preserving unitary time evolution among the heat baths and the\nwork storage. We show that our optimal work extraction turns the disordered\nenergy of the heat baths to the ordered energy of the work storage, by\nevaluating the ratio of the entropy difference to the energy difference in the\nheat baths and the work storage, respectively. By comparing the statistical\nmechanical optimal efficiency with the macroscopic thermodynamic bound, we\nevaluate the accuracy of the macroscopic thermodynamics with finite-size heat\nbaths from the statistical mechanical viewpoint. We also evaluate the quantum\ncoherence effect on the optimal efficiency of the cycle processes without\nrestricting their cycle time, by comparing the classical and quantum optimal\nefficiencies.\n", "  Recently, 23 cases of umbral moonshine, relating mock modular forms and\nfinite groups, have been discovered in the context of the 23 even unimodular\nNiemeier lattices. One of the 23 cases in fact coincides with the so-called\nMathieu moonshine, discovered in the context of K3 non-linear sigma models. In\nthis paper we establish a uniform relation between all 23 cases of umbral\nmoonshine and K3 sigma models, and thereby take a first step in placing umbral\nmoonshine into a geometric and physical context. This is achieved by relating\nthe ADE root systems of the Niemeier lattices to the ADE du Val singularities\nthat a K3 surface can develop, and the configuration of smooth rational curves\nin their resolutions. A geometric interpretation of our results is given in\nterms of the marking of K3 surfaces by Niemeier lattices.\n", "  The spin wave interference is studied in two dimensional Ising ferromagnet\ndriven by two coherent spherical magnetic field waves by Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The spin waves are found to propagate and interfere according to\nthe classic rule of interference pattern generated by two point sources. The\ninterference pattern of spin wave is observed in one boundary of the lattice.\nThe interference pattern is detected and studied by spin flip statistics at\nhigh and low temperatures. The destructive interference is manifested as the\nlarge number of spin flips and vice versa.\n", "  Zeldovich's stretch-twist fold (STF) dynamo provided a breakthrough in\nconceptual understanding of fast dynamos, including fluctuation or small scale\ndynamos. We study the evolution and saturation behaviour of two types of\nBaker's map dynamos, which have been used to model Zeldovich's STF dynamo\nprocess. Using such maps allows one to analyze dynamos at much higher magnetic\nReynolds numbers $R_M$ as compared to direct numerical simulations. In the\n2-strip map dynamo there is constant constructive folding while the 4-strip map\ndynamo also allows the possibility of field reversal. Incorporating a diffusive\nstep parameterised by $R_M$, we find that the magnetic field $B(x)$ is\namplified only above a critical $R_M=R_{crit} \\sim 4$ for both types of\ndynamos. We explore the saturation of these dynamos in 3 ways; by a\nrenormalized decrease of the effective $R_M$ (Case I) or due to a decrease in\nthe efficiency of field amplification by stretching (Case II), or a combination\nof both effects (Case III). For Case I, we show that $B(x)$ in the saturated\nstate, for both types of maps, goes back to the marginal eigenfunction, which\nis obtained for the critical $R_M=R_{crit}$. This is independent of the initial\n$R_M=R_{M0}$. On the other hand in Case II, for the 2-strip map, we show that\n$B(x)$ now saturates preserving the structure of the kinematic eigenfunction.\nThus the energy is transferred to larger scales in Case I but remains at the\nsmallest resistive scales in Case II. For the 4-strip map, the $B(x)$\noscillates with time, although with a structure similar to the kinematic\neigenfunction. Interestingly, the saturated state for Case III shows an\nintermediate behaviour, with $B(x)$ now similar to the kinematic eigenfunction\nfor an intermediate $R_M=R_{sat}$, with $R_{M0}>R_{sat}>R_{crit}$. These\nsaturation properties are akin to the ones discussed in the context of\nfluctuation dynamos.\n", "  We investigate the possible presence of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf\ngalaxies and other nearby galaxies to identify candidates for follow-up\nconfirmation and dynamical mass measurements. We use the Wide-field Infrared\nSurvey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky Release Source Catalog and examine the infrared\ncolours of a sample of dwarf galaxies and other nearby galaxies in order to\nidentify both unobscured and obscured candidate AGN by applying the infrared\ncolour diagnostic. Stellar masses of galaxies are obtained using a combination\nof three independent methods. Black hole masses are estimated using the\nbolometric luminosity of the AGN candidates and computed for three cases of the\nbolometric-to-Eddington luminosity ratio. We identify 303 candidate AGN, of\nwhich 276 were subsequently found to have been independently identified as AGN\nvia other methods. The remaining 9% require follow-up observations for\nconfirmation. The activity is detected in galaxies with stellar masses from ~\n10^6 to 10^9 solar masses; assuming the candidates are AGN, the black hole\nmasses are estimated to be ~ 10^3 - 10^6 solar masses, adopting L_bol = 0.1\nL_Edd. The black hole masses probed are several orders of magnitude smaller\nthan previously reported for centrally located massive black holes. We examine\nthe stellar mass versus black hole mass relationship in this low galaxy mass\nregime. We find that it is consistent with the existing relation extending\nlinearly (in log-log space) into the lower mass regime. These findings suggest\nthat CMBH are present in low-mass galaxies and in the Local Universe, and\nprovide new impetus for follow-up dynamical studies of quiescent black holes in\nlocal dwarf galaxies.\n", "  The responsibility of the electric field $E$ in the modification of the\nnature of the space is proved. We investigate the way the fundamental strings\nare related to supergravity background of D5-branes; i.e. once the endpoints of\nthe D-strings are electrified the flat space becomes curved. We study the\nelectrified relative and overall transverse perturbations of fuzzy funnel\nsolutions of intersecting $(N,N_f)$-strings and D5-branes in flat and\nsupergravity backgrounds respectively. As result the perturbations have a\ndiscontinuity which corresponds to a zero phase shift realizing Polchinski's\nopen string Neumann boundary condition. And once the electric field $E$ is\nturned on in flat space these perturbations decrease and when $E$ is close to\nthe critical value $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ the perturbations disappear forever and\nthe string coupling becomes strong. At this stage the space is considered\ncurved and the electric field is responsible for this effect. This phenomena is\nalso enhanced by the behavior of the potential $V$ associated to the\nperturbations $\\Phi$ on the funnel solutions under the influence of the\nelectric field. The potential goes too fast to $-\\infty$ when $E$ goes to the\ncritical value $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ in flat space which looks like a kink to\nincrease the velocity for $\\Phi$ to disappear. But in curved space and close to\nthe intersecting point we do not find any perturbation for all $E$ and there is\nno effect of $E$ on $V$ and this is a sign to the absence of the perturbation\neffects in supergravity background. This clarifies the existence of a relation\nbetween the electric field and the supergravity background.\n", "  Many-body entangled states are key elements in quantum information science\nand quantum metrology. One important problem in establishing a high degree of\nmany-body entanglement using optical techniques is the leakage of the system\ninformation via the light that creates such entanglement. We propose an\nall-optical interference-based approach to erase this information. Unwanted\natom-light entanglement can be removed by destructive interference of three or\nmore successive atom-light interactions, with only the desired effective\natom-atom interaction left. This quantum erasure protocol allows implementation\nof Heisenberg-limited spin squeezing using coherent light and a cold or warm\natomic ensemble. Calculations show that significant improvement in the\nsqueezing exceeding 10 dB is obtained compared to previous methods, and\nsubstantial spin squeezing is attainable even under moderate experimental\nconditions. Our method enables the efficient creation of many-body entangled\nstates with simple setups, and thus is promising for advancing technologies in\nquantum metrology and quantum information processing.\n", "  The potential energy problem in a gravitationally bound two-body system has\nrecently been studied in the framework of a proposed impact model of\ngravitation \\citep{WilDwi}. The result was applied to the free fall of the\nso-called Mintrop--Ball in G\\\"ottingen with the implicit assumption that the\nmass distribution of the system is extremely unbalanced. An attempt to\ngeneralize the study to arbitrary mass distributions indicated a conflict with\nthe energy conservation law in a closed system. This necessitated us to\nreconsider an earlier assumption made in selecting a specific process out of\ntwo options \\citep{Wiletal}. With the result obtained here we can now make an\neducated selection and reverse our choice. The consequences are presented and\ndiscussed in detail for several processes. Energy and momentum conservation\ncould now be demonstrated in all cases.\n", "  Efficient thermalization of overlapping supernovae within star-forming\ngalaxies may produce a supernova-heated fluid that drives galactic winds. For\nfiducial assumptions about the timescale for cloud shredding from\nhigh-resolution simulations (which neglect magnetic fields) we show that cool\nclouds with temperature from $T_{c}\\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}$ K seen in emission and\nabsorption in galactic winds cannot be accelerated to observed velocities by\nthe ram pressure of a hot wind. Taking into account both the radial structure\nof the hot flow and gravity, we show that this conclusion holds over a wide\nrange of galaxy, cloud, and hot wind properties. This finding calls into\nquestion the prevailing picture whereby the cool atomic gas seen in galactic\nwinds is entrained and accelerated by the hot flow. Given these difficulties\nwith ram pressure acceleration, we discuss alternative models for the origin of\nhigh velocity cool gas outflows. Another possibility is that magnetic fields in\ncool clouds are sufficiently important that they prolong the cloud's life. For\n$T_{c}=10^{3}$\\,K and $10^{4}$\\,K clouds, we show that if conductive\nevaporation can be neglected, the cloud shredding timescale must be $\\sim15$\nand 5 times longer, respectively, than the values from hydrodynamical\nsimulations in order for cool cloud velocities to reach those seen in\nobservations.\n", "  We present an interface between the multipurpose NLO Monte Carlo tool\nMadGraph5_aMC@NLO and the automated one-loop amplitude generator GoSam. As a\nfirst application of this novel framework, we compute the NLO corrections to\n$pp \\to t\\bar{t}H$ and $pp \\to t\\bar{t}\\gamma\\gamma$ matched to a parton\nshower. In the phenomenological analyses of these processes, we focus our\nattention on observables which are sensitive to the polarisation of the top\nquarks.\n", "  We develop two approximation schemes for solving the cell equation and the\ndiscounted cell equation using Aubry-Mather-Fathi theory. The Hamiltonian is\nsupposed to be Tonelli, time-independent , and periodic in space. By Legendre\ntransform it is equivalent to find a fixed point of some nonlinear operator,\ncalled Lax-Oleinik operator, which may be discounted or not. By discretizing in\ntime, we are led to solve an additive eigenvalue problem involving a discrete\nLax-Oleinik operator. We show how to approximate the effective Hamiltonian and\nsome weak KAM solutions by letting the time step in the discrete model tend to\nzero. We also obtain a selected discrete weak KAM solution as in [Davini et al\n2014] and show it converges to a particular solution of the cell equation. In\norder to unify the two settings, continuous and discrete , we develop a more\ngeneral formalism of short-range interactions.\n", "  Continuous symmetry breaking (CSB) in low-dimensional systems, forbidden by\nthe Mermin-Wagner theorem for short-range interactions, may take place in the\npresence of slowly decaying long-range interactions. Nevertheless, there is no\nstringent bound on how slowly interactions should decay to give rise to CSB in\n1D quantum systems at zero temperature. Here, we study a long-range interacting\nspin chain with $U(1)$ symmetry and power-law interactions\n$V(r)\\sim1/r^\\alpha$, directly relevant to ion-trap experiments. Using\nbosonization and renormalization group theory, we find CSB for $\\alpha$ smaller\nthan a critical exponent $\\alpha_c(\\le 3)$ depending on the microscopic\nparameters of the model. Furthermore, the transition from the gapless XY phase\nto the gapless CSB phase is mediated by the breaking of conformal symmetry due\nto long-range interactions, and is described by a new universality class akin\nto the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analytical findings are\nin good agreement with a numerical calculation. Signatures of the CSB phase\nshould be accessible in existing trapped-ion experiments.\n", "  I explicitly construct a strong zero mode in the XYZ chain or, equivalently,\nMajorana wires coupled via a four-fermion interaction. The strong zero mode is\nan operator that pairs states in different symmetry sectors, resulting in\nidentical spectra up to exponentially small finite-size corrections. Such\npairing occurs in the Ising/Majorana fermion chain and possibly in\nparafermionic systems and strongly disordered many-body localized phases. The\nproof here shows that the strong zero mode occurs in a clean interacting\nsystem, and that it possesses some remarkable structure -- despite being a\nrather elaborate operator, it squares to the identity. Eigenstate phase\ntransitions separate regions with different types of pairing.\n", "  Two-dimensional crystalline membranes have recently been realized\nexperimentally in such systems as graphene and molybdenum disulfide, sparking a\nresurgence in interest in their statistical properties. Thermal fluctuations\ncan significantly affect the effective mechanical properties of properly\nthermalized membranes, renormalizing both bending rigidity and elastic moduli\nso that in particular they become stiffer to bending than their bare bending\nrigidity would suggest. We use molecular dynamics simulations to examine how\nthe mechanical behavior of thermalized two-dimensional clamped ribbons\n(cantilevers) depends on their precise topology and geometry. We find that a\nsimple slit smooths roughness as measured by the variance of height\nfluctuations. This counterintuitive effect may be due to the counter-posed\ncoupling of the lips of the slit to twist in the intact regions of the ribbon.\n", "  Recent developments in the study of the moonshine phenomenon, including\numbral and Conway moonshine, suggest that it may play an important role in\nencoding the action of finite symmetry groups on the BPS spectrum of K3 string\ntheory. To test and clarify these proposed K3-moonshine connections, we study\nLandau-Ginzburg orbifolds that flow to conformal field theories in the moduli\nspace of K3 sigma models. We compute K3 elliptic genera twined by discrete\nsymmetries that are manifest in the UV description, though often inaccessible\nin the IR. We obtain various twining functions coinciding with moonshine\npredictions that have not been observed in physical theories before. These\ninclude twining functions arising from Mathieu moonshine, other cases of umbral\nmoonshine, and Conway moonshine. For instance, all functions arising from\n$M_{11} \\subset 2.M_{12}$ moonshine appear as explicit twining genera in the LG\nmodels, which moreover admit a uniform description in terms of its natural\n12-dimensional representation. Our results provide strong evidence for the\nrelevance of umbral moonshine for K3 symmetries, as well as new hints for its\neventual explanation.\n", "  In this work we explore the consequences of considering from the very\nbeginning the stationary and axisymmetric properties of the Kerr black hole as\none attempts to derive this solution through the Kerr-Schild ansatz. The first\nconsequence is kinematical and is based on a new stationary and axisymmetric\nversion of the Kerr theorem that yields to the precise shear-free and geodesic\nnull congruence of flat spacetime characterizing the Kerr solution. A\nstraightforward advantage of this strategy is that now the parameter $a$\nappears naturally as associated to the conserved angular momentum of the\ngeodesics due to axisymmetry. The second consequence is dynamical and takes\ninto account the circularity theorem. In fact, a stationary-axisymmetric\nKerr-Schild ansatz is in general incompatible with the circularity property\nwarranted by vacuum Einstein equations unless the remaining angular dependence\nin the Kerr-Schild profile appears fixed in a precise way. Thanks to these two\ningredients, the integration of the Einstein equations reduces to a simple\nordinary differential equation on the radial dependence, whose integration\nconstant is precisely the mass $m$. This derivation of the Kerr solution is\nsimple but rigorous, and it may be suitable for any textbook.\n", "  We present a novel way to organise the finite size spectra of a class of\nconformal field theories (CFT) with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ or (non-linear)\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal symmetry. Generalising the spinon basis of the\n$SU(n)_1$ WZW theories, we introduce supersymmetric spinons $(\\phi^-,\n\\phi^{+})$, which form a representation of the supersymmetry algebra. In each\ncase, we show how to construct a multi-spinon basis of the chiral CFT spectra.\nThe multi-spinon states are labelled by a collection $\\{ n_j \\}$ of (discrete)\nmomenta. The state-content for given choice of $\\{ n_j \\}$ is determined\nthrough a generalised exclusion principle, similar to Haldane's `motif' rules\nfor the $SU(n)_1$ theories. In the simplest case, which is the ${\\cal N}=2$\nsuperconformal theory with central charge $c=1$, we develop an algebraic\nframework similar to the Yangian symmetry of the $SU(2)_1$ theory. It includes\nan operator $H_2$, akin to a CFT Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian, which is\ndiagonalised by multi-spinon states. In all cases studied, we obtain finite\npartition sums by capping the spinon-momenta to some finite value. For the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal CFTs, this finitisation precisely leads to the\nso-called M$_k$ supersymmetric lattice models with characteristic order-$k$\nexclusion rules on the lattice. Finitising the $c=2$ CFT with non-linear ${\\cal\nN}=4$ superconformal symmetry similarly gives lattice model partition sums for\nspin-full fermions with on-site and nearest neighbour exclusion.\n", "  Isotope shifts of transition frequencies in atoms constrain generic long- and\nintermediate-range interactions. We focus on new physics scenarios that can be\nmost strongly constrained by King Linearity Violation such as models with B-L\nvector bosons, Higgs portal and chameleon. With the anticipated precision, King\nLinearity Violation has the potential to set the strongest laboratory bounds on\nthese models in some regions of parameter space. Furthermore, we show that this\nmethod can probe the couplings relevant for the protophobic interpretation of\nthe recently reported Be anomaly. We extend the formalism to include an\narbitrary number of transitions and isotope pairs and fit the new physics\ncoupling to the currently available isotope shift measurements.\n", "  In the present work, focusing on one of the most popular problems in modern\ngravitation theories, we consider generalized Lanndau-Liftshitz energy-momentum\nrelation to calculate energy distribution of the Bianchi-Type VI spacetime in\n$f(R)$ gravity. Additionally, the results are specified by using some\nwell-known $f(R)$-gravity models.\n", "  Neutron scattering studies have been carried out on polycrystalline samples\nof a series of rare earth intermetallic compounds RCuAs$_2$ (R = Pr, Nd, Dy,\nTb, Ho and Yb) as a function of temperature to determine the magnetic\nstructures and the order parameters. These compounds crystallize in the\nZrCuSi$_2$ type structure, which is similar to that of the RFeAsO (space group\nP4/nmm) class of iron-based superconductors. PrCuAs$_2$ develops commensurate\nmagnetic order with K = (0, 0, 0.5) below T$_N$ = 6.4 (2) K, with the ordered\nmoments pointing along the c-axis. The irreducible representation analysis\nshows either a ${\\Gamma}$$^1_2$ or ${\\Gamma}$$^1_3$ representation. NdCuAs$_2$\nand DyCuAs$_2$ order below T$_N$ = 3.54(5) K and T$_N$ = 10.1(2) K,\nrespectively, with the same ordering wave vector but the moments lying in the\na-b plane (with a ${\\Gamma}$$^2_9$ or ${\\Gamma}$$^2_{10}$ representation).\nTbCuAs$_2$ and HoCuAs$_2$ exhibit incommensurate magnetic structures below\nT$_N$ = 9.44(7) and 4.41(2) K, respectively. For TbCuAs$_2$, two separate\nmagnetic ordering wave vectors are established as K$_{1(Tb)}$ =\n(0.240,0.155,0.48) and K$_{2(Tb)}$ = (0.205, 0.115, 0.28), whereas HoCuAs$_2$\nforms a single K$_{(Ho)}$ = (0.121, 0.041, 0.376) magnetic structure with\n3$^{rd}$ order harmonic magnetic peaks. YbCuAs$_2$ does not exhibit any\nmagnetic Bragg peaks at 1.5 K, while susceptibility measurements indicate an\nantiferromagnetic-like transition at 4 K, suggesting that either the ordering\nis not long range in nature or the ordered moment is below the sensitivity\nlimit of $\\approx$ 0.2 $\\mu_B$.\n", "  Lattice translation symmetry gives rise to a large class of \"weak\"\ntopological insulators (TIs), characterized by translation-protected gapless\nsurface states and dislocation bound states. In this work we show that space\ngroup symmetries lead to constraints on the weak topological indices that\ndefine these phases. In particular we show that screw rotation symmetry\nenforces the Hall conductivity along the screw axis to be quantized in\nmultiples of the screw rank, which generally applies to interacting systems. We\nfurther show that certain 3D weak indices associated with quantum spin Hall\neffects (class AII) are forbidden by the Bravais-lattice and by glide or\neven-fold screw symmetries. These results put a strong constraints on\ncandidates of weak TIs in the experimental and numerical search for topological\nmaterials, based on the crystal structure alone.\n", "  We present an error correcting protocol that enhances the lifetime of\nstabilizer code based qubits which are susceptible to the creation of pairs of\nlocalized defects (due to string-like error operators) at finite temperature,\nsuch as the toric code. The primary tool employed is dynamic application of a\nlocal, unitary operator which exchanges defects and thereby translates\nlocalized excitations. Crucially, the protocol does not require any\nmeasurements of stabilizer operators, and therefore can be used to enhance the\nlifetime of a qubit in the absence of such experimental resources.\n", "  The recent LIGO observation sparked interest in the field of gravity wave\nsignals. Besides the gravity wave observation the LIGO collaboration used the\ninspiraling black hole pair to constrain the graviton mass. Unlike general\nrelativity, $f(R)$ theories have a characteristic non-zero mass graviton. We\napply the constraint on the graviton mass to viable $f(R)$ models to find the\neffects on model parameters. We find it possible to constrain the parameter\nspace with the gravity wave based observations. We make a case study for the\npopular Hu-Sawicki model and find a parameter bracket. The result generalizes\nto other $f(R)$ theories and can be used to contain the parameter space.\n", "  The minimum of the Gutzwiller energy functional depends on the number of\nparameters considered in the variational state. For a three-orbital Hubbard\nmodel we find that the frequently used diagonal Ansatz is very accurate in\nhigh-symmetry situations. For lower symmetry, induced by a crystal-field\nsplitting or the spin-orbit coupling, the discrepancies in energy between the\nmost general and a diagonal Gutzwiller Ansatz can be quite significant. We\ndiscuss approximate schemes that may be employed in multi-band cases where a\nminimization of the general Gutzwiller energy functional is too demanding\nnumerically.\n", "  This study is conducted to examine the validity of generalized second law of\nthermodynamics (GSLT) in flat FRW for modified teleparallel gravity involving\ncoupling between a scalar field with the torsion scalar $T$ and the boundary\nterm $B=2\\nabla_{\\mu}T^{\\mu}$. This theory is very useful since it can\nreproduce other important well-known scalar field theories in suitable limits.\nThe validity of the first and second law of thermodynamics at the apparent\nhorizon is discussed for any coupling. As examples, we have also explored the\nvalidity of those thermodynamics laws in some new cosmological solutions under\nthe theory. Additionally, we have also considered the logarithmic entropy\ncorrected relation and discuss the GSLT at the apparent horizon.\n", "  We present a Ginzburg-Landau theory of micro phase separation in a bidisperse\nchiral membrane consisting of rods of opposite handendness. This model system\nundergoes a phase transition from an equilibrium state where the two components\nare completely phase separated to a microphase separated state composed of\ndomains of a finite size comparable to the twist penetration depth.\nCharacterizing the phenomenology using linear stability analysis and numerical\nstudies, we trace the origin of the discontinuous change in domain size that\noccurs during this to a competition between the cost of creating an interface\nand the gain in twist energy for small domains in which the twist penetrates\ndeep into the center of the domain.\n", "  The distribution of entangled quantum systems among two or more nodes of a\nnetwork is a key task at the basis of quantum communication, quantum\ncomputation and quantum cryptography. Unfortunately the transmission lines used\nin this procedure can introduce so much perturbations and noise in the\ntransmitted signal that prevent the possibility of restoring quantum\ncorrelations in the received messages either by means of encoding optimization\nor by exploiting local operations and classical communication. In this work we\npresent a procedure which allows one to improve the performance of some of\nthese channels. The mechanism underpinning this result is a protocol which we\ndub cut-and-paste, as it consists in extracting and reshuffling the\nsub-components of these communication lines, which finally succeed in\n\"correcting each other\". The proof of this counterin- tuitive phenomenon, while\nimproving our theoretical understanding of quantum entanglement, has also a\ndirect application in the realization of quantum information networks based on\nimperfect and highly noisy communication lines. A quantum optics experiment,\nbased on the transmission of single-photon polarization states, is also\npresented which provides a proof-of-principle test of the proposed protocol.\n", "  We consider quantum algorithms for the unique sink orientation problem on\ncubes. This problem is widely considered to be of intermediate computational\ncomplexity. This is because there no known polynomial algorithm (classical or\nquantum) from the problem and yet it arrises as part of a series of problems\nfor which it being intractable would imply complexity theoretic collapses. We\ngive a reduction which proves that if one can efficiently evaluate the kth\npower of the unique sink orientation outmap, then there exists a polynomial\ntime quantum algorithm for the unique sink orientation problem on cubes.\n", "  Magnetic dipole moment and mean-square charge radius of $^{199}$Pt\n($I^{\\pi}=$ 5/2$^-$) have been evaluated for the first time from the\ninvestigation of the hyperfine splitting of the $\\lambda_1=$ 248.792 nm\ntransition by in-gas-cell laser ionization spectroscopy. Neutron-rich nucleus\n$^{199}$Pt was produced by multi-nucleon transfer reaction at the KISS where\nthe nuclear spectroscopy in the vicinity of $N=$ 126 is planed from the aspect\nof an astrophysical interest as well as the nuclear structure. Measured\nmagnetic dipole moment $+$0.63(13)$\\mu_{\\rm N}$ is consistent with the\nsystematics of those of nuclei with $I^{\\pi}=$ 5/2$^-$. The deformation\nparameter $|<\\beta_2^2>^{1/2}|$ evaluated from the isotope shift indicates the\ngradual shape change to spherical shape of platinum isotopes with increasing\nneutron number toward $N=$ 126.\n", "  Assuming a well-behaving quantum-to-classical transition, measuring large\nquantum systems should be highly informative with low measurement-induced\ndisturbance, while the coupling between system and measurement apparatus is\n\"fairly simple\" and weak. Here, we show that this is indeed possible within the\nformalism of quantum mechanics. We discuss an example of estimating the\ncollective magnetization of a spin ensemble by simultaneous measuring three\northogonal spin directions. For the task of estimating the direction of a\nspin-coherent state, we find that the average guessing fidelity and the system\ndisturbance are nonmonotonic functions of the coupling strength. Strikingly, we\ndiscover an intermediate regime for the coupling strength where the guessing\nfidelity is quasi-optimal, while the measured state is almost not disturbed.\n", "  We refute all claims of the \"Comment on \"Normalization of quasinormal modes\nin leaky optical cavities and plasmonic resonators\" \" by E. A. Muljarov and W.\nLangbein (arXiv:1602.07278v1). Based entirely on information already contained\nin our original article (P. T. Kristensen, R.-C. Ge and S. Hughes, Physical\nReview A 92, 053810 (2015)), we dismiss every point of criticism as being\ncompletely unjustified and point out how important parts of our argumentation\nappear to have been overlooked by the Comment Authors. In addition, we provide\nadditional calculations showing directly the link between the normalizations by\nSauvan et al. and Muljarov et al., which were not included in our original\narticle.\n", "  We study the dynamical thermal conductivity of the Kitaev spin model on a\ntwo-leg ladder. In contrast to conventional integrable one-dimensional spin\nsystems, we show that heat transport is completely dissipative. This is a\ndirect consequence of fractionalization of spins into mobile Majorana matter\nand a static $Z_{2}$ gauge field, which acts as an emergent thermally activated\ndisorder. Our finding rests on three complementary calculations of the current\ncorrelation function, comprising a phenomenological mean-field treatment of\nthermal gauge fluctuations, a complete summation over all gauge sectors, as\nwell as exact diagonalization of the original spin model. The results will also\nbe contrasted against the conductivity discarding gauge fluctuations.\n", "  Calculations of the reaction rate of the proton radiative capture on 3H at\ntemperatures from 0.01 T9 up to 5 T9, which are based on the theoretical\nresults for the astrophysical S-factor and take into account the latest\nexperimental data, were carried out. Theoretical results for the S-factor at\nenergies from 1 keV up to 5 MeV were obtained in the framework of the modified\npotential cluster model with the classification of orbital states according to\nYoung tableaux. On the basis of used nuclear model of the interaction of p and\n3H particles there was shown possibility of description the latest experimental\ndata for the S-factor at the energy range from 50 keV up to 5 MeV.\n", "  So far the spectra $E_n(N)$ of the paradigm model of complex\nPT(Parity-Time)-symmetric potential $V_{BB}(x,N)=-(ix)^N$ is known to be\nanalytically continued for $N > 4$. Consequently, the well known eigenvalues of\nthe Hermitian cases ($N=6,10$) cannot be recovered. Here, we illustrate Kato's\ntheorem that even if a Hamiltonian $H(\\lambda)$ is an analytic function of a\nreal parameter $\\lambda$, its eigenvalues $E_n(\\lambda)$ may not be analytic at\nfinite number of Isolated Points (IPs). In this light, we present the Dirichlet\nspectra $E_n(N)$ of $V_{BB}(x,N)$ for $2\\le N<12$ using the numerical\nintegration of Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation with $\\psi(x=\\pm \\infty)=0$ and the\ndiagonalization of $H=p^2/2\\mu+V_{BB}(x,N)$ in the harmonic oscillator basis.\nWe show that these real discrete spectra are consistent with the most simple\ntwo-turning point CWKB (C refers to complex turning points) method provided we\nchoose the maximal turning points (MxTP) [$-a+ib,a+ib, a, b \\in {\\cal R}$] such\nthat $|a|$ is the largest for a given energy among all (multiple) turning\npoints. We find that $E_n(N)$ are continuous function of $N$ but non-analytic\n(their first derivative is discontinuous) at IPs $N=4,8$; where the Dirichlet\nspectrum is null (as $V_{BB}$ becomes a Hermitian flat-top potential barrier).\nAt $N=6$ and $10$, $V_{BB}(x,N)$ becomes a Hermitian well and we recover its\nwell known eigenvalues.\n", "  This paper is interested to the study of the geodesic motion in the spacetime\nof a SU(2)-colored (A)dS black hole solving in conformal gravity. With the help\nof Weierstrass elliptic and Kleinian $\\sigma$ functions we derive the\nanalytical solutions for the equation of motion of test particles and light\nrays, and we classify the solutions of the geodesic equation according to the\nparticle's energy and angular momentum. Also, we produce examples of possible\norbit types.\n", "  General Relativity has had tremendous successes on both theoretical and\nexperimental fronts for over a century by now. However, the theory contents are\nfar from being exhausted. Only very recently, with gravitational wave detection\nfrom colliding black holes, have we started probing gravity behavior in the\nstrongly non-linear regime. Even today, black hole studies keep revealing more\nand more paradoxes and bizarre results. In this paper, inspired by David\nHilbert's startling observation, we show that, contrary to the conventional\nwisdom, a freely falling test particle feels gravitational repulsion by a black\nhole as seen by an asymptotic observer. We dig deeper into this relativistic\ngravity surprising behavior and offer some explanations.\n", "  It has recently been shown that there exists a class of stable gapless spin\nliquids in 3+1 dimensions described by higher rank tensor U(1) gauge fields,\ngiving rise to an emergent tensor electromagnetism. The tensor gauge field of\nthese theories couples naturally to subdimensional particles (such as\nfractons), which are restricted by gauge invariance to move only along\nlower-dimensional subspaces of the system. We here work out some of the basic\ngeneralized electromagnetic properties of subdimensional particles coupled to\ntensor electromagnetism, such as generalized electrostatic fields, potential\nformulations, Lorentz forces, Maxwell equations, and Biot-Savart laws. Some\nconcepts from conventional electromagnetism will carry over directly, while\nothers require significant modification.\n", "  Upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will measure\ntemperature fluctuations on small angular scales with unprecedented precision.\nSmall-scale CMB fluctuations are a mixture of late-time effects: gravitational\nlensing, Doppler shifting of CMB photons by moving electrons (the kSZ effect),\nand residual foregrounds. We propose a new statistic which separates the kSZ\nsignal from the others, and also allows the kSZ signal to be decomposed in\nredshift bins. The decomposition extends to high redshift, and does not require\nexternal datasets such as galaxy surveys. In particular, the high-redshift\nsignal from patchy reionization can be cleanly isolated, enabling future CMB\nexperiments to make high-significance and qualitatively new measurements of the\nreionization era.\n", "  In this article, we shed some light on the field theoretic aspect of the\nspherically symmetric trapping horizon in Vaidya spacetime. The effective field\nequations are that of a Chern-Simons theory coupled to bulk sources through two\ndifferent couplings, one is purely geometric and the other is matter dependent.\nThis is an effective generalization of the equilibrium horizon scenario where\nthe Chern-Simons theory is coupled to the bulk geometry through a constant\nmatter-independent coupling. Further, we note that the field equations\npulled-back to a cross-section of the horizon is inadequate to manifest the\nnature of the horizon. Hence, contrary to the usual practice, the evolution\nequation needs to be considered at least while passing on to the quantum\ntheory.\n", "  Temperature-sensitive hydrogels based on polymers such as\npoly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) undergo a volume phase transition in\nresponse to changes in temperature. During this transition, distinct changes in\nboth thermal and mechanical properties are observed. Here, we illustrate and\nexploit the inherent thermodynamic link between thermal and mechanical\nproperties by showing that the compressive elastic modulus of PNIPAM hydrogels\ncan be probed using differential scanning calorimetry. We validate our approach\nby using conventional osmotic compression tests. Our method could be\nparticularly valuable for determining the mechanical response of\nthermosensitive submicron-sized and/or oddly shaped particles, to which\nstandard methods are not readily applicable.\n", "  The determination of the injection composition of cosmic ray nuclei within\nastrophysical sources requires sufficiently accurate descriptions of the source\nphysics and the propagation - apart from controlling astrophysical\nuncertainties. We therefore study the implications of nuclear data and models\nfor cosmic ray astrophysics, which involves the photo-disintegration of nuclei\nup to iron in astrophysical environments. We demonstrate that the impact of\nnuclear model uncertainties is potentially larger in environments with\nnon-thermal radiation fields than in the cosmic microwave background. We also\nstudy the impact of nuclear models on the nuclear cascade in a gamma-ray burst\nradiation field, simulated at a level of complexity comparable to the most\nprecise cosmic ray propagation code. We conclude with an isotope chart\ndescribing which information is in principle necessary to describe nuclear\ninteractions in cosmic ray sources and propagation.\n", "  In this paper we consider modification of electronic properties of\ngraphene-based topological insulator in the presence of wedge disclination and\nmagnetic field by adopting the Kane-Mele model with intrinsic spin-orbit\ncoupling. Using the properly defined Dirac-Weyl equation for this system, an\nexact solution for the Landau levels is obtained. The influence of the\ntopological defect on the evolution of Landau levels is discussed.\n", "  By performing explicit computations of correlation functions, we find\nevidence that there is a sector of the two matrix model defined by the $SU(2)$\nsector of ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, that can be reduced to\neigenvalue dynamics. There is an interesting generalization of the usual Van\nder Monde determinant that plays a role. The observables we study are the BPS\noperators of the $SU(2)$ sector and include traces of products of both\nmatrices, which are genuine multi matrix observables. These operators are\nassociated to supergravity solutions of string theory.\n", "  Entanglement is a central feature of quantum theory. Mathematical properties\nand physical applications of pure state entanglement make it a template to\nstudy quantum correlations. However, an extension of entanglement measures to\nmixed states in terms of separability does not always correspond to all the\noperational aspects. Quantum discord measures allow an alternative way to\nextend the idea of quantum correlations to mixed states. In many cases these\nextensions are motivated by physical scenarios and quantum information\nprotocols. In this chapter we discuss several settings involving correlated\nquantum systems, ranging from distributed gates to detectors testing quantum\nfields. In each setting we show how entanglement fails to capture the relevant\nfeatures of the correlated system, and discuss the role of discord as a\npossible alternative.\n", "  We demonstrate that the highly sensitive phase-contrast properties of Bragg\ncoherent diffraction measurements combined with the translational diversity of\nptychography can provide a Bragg \"dark field\" imaging method capable of\nrevealing the finger print of domain structure in metallic thin films.\nExperimental diffraction data was taken from a epitaxially grown niobium\nmetallic thin film on sapphire; and analysed with the help of a careful\ncombination of implemented refinement mechanisms.\n", "  In the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, the violation of\nseparate number conservation laws for the three dimensional left and right\nhanded Weyl fermions is known as the chiral anomaly. The recent discovery of\nWeyl and Dirac semimetals has paved the way for experimentally testing the\neffects of chiral anomaly via longitudinal magneto-transport measurements. More\nrecently, a type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase has been proposed, where the\nnodal points possess a finite density of states due to the touching between\nelectron- and hole- pockets. It has been suggested that the main difference\nbetween the two types of WSMs (type-I and type-II) is that in the latter,\nchiral anomaly and the associated longitudinal magneto-resistance are strongly\nanisotropic, vanishing when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the\ndirection of tilt of Weyl fermion cones in a type-II WSM. We analyze chiral\nanomaly in a type-II WSM in quasiclassical Boltzmann framework, and find that\nthe chiral anomaly induced positive longitudinal magneto-conductivity is\npresent along any arbitrary direction.\n", "  We study the ground state phase diagram of the Anderson-Hubbard model with\ncorrelated hopping at half filling in one-dimension. The Hamiltonian has a\nlocal Coulomb repulsion $U$ and a disorder potential with local energies\nrandomly distributed in the interval $(-W,+W)$ with equal probability, acting\non the singly occupied sites. The hopping process which modifies the number of\ndoubly occupied sites is forbidden. The hopping between nearest-neighbor singly\noccupied and empty sites or between singly occupied and doubly occupied sites\nhave the same amplitude $t$. We identify three different phases as functions of\nthe disorder amplitude $W$ and Coulomb interaction strength $U>0$. When $U<4t$\nthe system shows a metallic phase (i) only when no disorder is present $W=0$ or\nan Anderson-localized phase (ii) when disorder is introduced $W\\neq 0$. When\n$U>4t$ the Anderson-localized phase survives as long as disorder effects\ndominates on the interaction effects, otherwise a Mott insulator phase (iii)\narises. The phases (i) and (ii) are characterized by a finite density of\ndoublons and a vanishing charge gap between the ground state and the excited\nstates. The phase (iii) is characterized by vanishing density of doublons and a\nfinite gap for the charge excitations.\n", "  Coherent, large scale dynamics in many nonequilibrium physical, biological,\nor information transport networks are driven by small-scale local energy input.\nHere, we introduce and explore an analytically tractable nonlinear model for\ncompressible active flow networks. In contrast to thermally-driven systems, we\nfind that active friction selects discrete states with a limited number of\noscillation modes activated at distinct fixed amplitudes. Using perturbation\ntheory, we systematically predict the stationary states of noisy networks and\nfind good agreement with a Bayesian state estimation based on a hidden Markov\nmodel applied to simulated time series data. Our results suggest that the\nmacroscopic response of active network structures, from actomyosin force\nnetworks to cytoplasmic flows, can be dominated by a significantly reduced\nnumber of modes, in contrast to energy equipartition in thermal equilibrium.\nThe model is also well-suited to study topological sound modes and spectral\nband gaps in active matter.\n", "  The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) is an option for a future e+e- collider\noperating at centre-of-mass energies up to 3 TeV, providing sensitivity to a\nwide range of new physics phenomena and precision physics measurements at the\nenergy frontier. This paper is the first comprehensive presentation of the\nHiggs physics reach of CLIC operating at three energy stages: sqrt(s) = 350\nGeV, 1.4 TeV and 3 TeV. The initial stage of operation allows the study of\nHiggs boson production in Higgsstrahlung (e+e- -> ZH) and WW-fusion (e+e- ->\nHnunu), resulting in precise measurements of the production cross sections, the\nHiggs total decay width Gamma_H, and model-independent determinations of the\nHiggs couplings. Operation at sqrt(s) > 1 TeV provides high-statistics samples\nof Higgs bosons produced through WW-fusion, enabling tight constraints on the\nHiggs boson couplings. Studies of the rarer processes e+e- -> ttH and e+e- ->\nHHnunu allow measurements of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs boson\nself-coupling. This paper presents detailed studies of the precision achievable\nwith Higgs measurements at CLIC and describes the interpretation of these\nmeasurements in a global fit.\n", "  We have determined the magnetic structure of the noncentrosymmetric\nheavy-fermion superconductor CePt3Si using elastic polarized neutron scattering\nwith field-projected (longitudinal) XYZ polarization analysis. We find that the\nmagnetic moment has components both in the tetragonal basal plane and along the\ntetragonal four-fold axis. Such a magnetic structure is not symmetry-allowed if\nthe magnetic phase transition is second order, and may imply that CePt3Si has\nlower symmetry in the superconducting state than originally thought.\n", "  Among the key insights into the glass transition has been the identification\nof a non-equilibrium phase transition in trajectory space which reveals phase\ncoexistence between the normal supercooled liquid (active phase) and a glassy\nstate (inactive phase). Here we present evidence that such a transition occurs\nin experiment. In colloidal hard spheres we find a non-Gaussian distribution of\ntrajectories leaning towards those rich in locally favoured structures (LFS),\nassociated with the emergence of slow dynamics. This we interpret as evidence\nfor an non-equilibrium transition to an inactive LFS-rich phase. Reweighting\ntrajectories reveals a first-order phase transition in trajectory space between\na normal liquid and a LFS-rich phase. We further find evidence of a purely\ndynamical transition in trajectory space.\n", "  We derive and study the hyperbolic reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations (HRMB), a\nsimplified model for the dynamics of strongly correlated Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs), and in particular for the interaction between the BEC atoms\nand its evaporated atoms under the strong interactions. This equation is one\namong four which are proven to be integrable via the existence of a Lax pair,\nand thus the method of inverse scattering transform. Another equation is the\nreduced Maxwell-Bloch equation of quantum optics and the two others do not have\nphysical applications yet. By studying the linear stability of the constant\nsolutions of these four equations we observe various regimes, from stable, to\nmodulational unstable and unstable at all frequencies. The finite dimensional\nreduction of the RMB equations is also used to give more insight into the\nconstant solutions of these equations. From this study, we find that the HRMB\nequation arising from strongly correlated BECS is stable under the particular\ncondition that the transition rate of evaporation is not too large compared to\nthe number of evaporated atoms. We then derive explicit soliton solutions of\nthe RMB equations and use numerical simulations to show collisions of solitons\nand kink solitons.\n", "  We report the magnetic response of Co/Pt multilayers to picosecond electrical\nheating. Using photoconductive Auston switches, we generate electrical pulses\nwith 5.5 picosecond duration and hundreds of pico-Joules to pass through Co/Pt\nmultilayers. The electrical pulse heats the electrons in the Co/Pt multilayers\nand causes an ultrafast reduction in the magnetic moment. A comparison between\noptical and electrically induced demagnetization of the Co/Pt multilayers\nreveals significantly different dynamics for optical vs. electrical heating. We\nattribute the disparate dynamics to the dependence of the electron-phonon\ninteraction on the average energy and total number of initially excited\nelectrons.\n", "  Context. Most of the studies on extragalactic {\\gamma}-ray propagation\nperformed up to now only accounted for primary gamma-ray absorption and\nadiabatic losses (\"absorption-only model\"). However, there is growing evidence\nthat this model is oversimplified and must be modified in some way. In\nparticular, it was found that the intensity extrapolated from the\noptically-thin energy range of some blazar spectra is insufficient to explain\nthe optically-thick part of these spectra. This effect was interpreted as an\nindication for {\\gamma}-axion-like particle (ALP) oscillation. On the other\nhand, there are many hints that a secondary component from electromagnetic\ncascades initiated by primary {\\gamma}-rays or nuclei may be observed in the\nspectra of some blazars. Aims. We study the impact of electromagnetic cascades\nfrom primary {\\gamma}-rays or protons on the physical interpretation of blazar\nspectra obtained with imaging Cherenkov telescopes. Methods. We use the\npublicly-available code ELMAG to compute observable spectra of electromagnetic\ncascades from primary {\\gamma}-rays. For the case of primary proton, we develop\na simple, fast and reasonably accurate hybrid method to calculate the\nobservable spectrum. We perform the fitting of the observed spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) with various physical models: the absorption-only model,\nthe \"electromagnetic cascade model\" (for the case of primary {\\gamma}-rays),\nand several versions of the hadronic cascade model (for the case of primary\nproton). We distinguish the following species of hadronic cascade models: 1)\n\"basic hadronic model\", where it is assumed that the proton beam travels\nundisturbed by extragalactic magnetic field and that all observable\n{\\gamma}-rays are produced by primary protons through photohadronic processes\nwith subsequent development of electromagnetic cascades /abridged\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations with background magnetic fields are used to\ndetermine the magnetic moments of the octet baryons. Computations are performed\nat the physical value of the strange quark mass, and two values of the light\nquark mass, one corresponding to the three-flavor symmetric point, where the\npion mass is 800 MeV, and the other corresponding to a pion mass of 450 MeV.\nThe moments are found to exhibit only mild pion-mass dependence when expressed\nin terms of appropriately chosen magneton units- the natural baryon magneton. A\ncurious pattern is revealed among the anomalous baryon magnetic moments which\nis linked to the constituent quark model, however, careful scrutiny exposes\nadditional features. Relations expected to hold in the large-Nc limit of QCD\nare studied; and, in one case, a clear preference for the quark model over the\nlarge-Nc prediction is found. The magnetically coupled Lambda-Sigma system is\ntreated in detail at the three-flavor symmetric point, with the lattice QCD\nresults comparing favorably with predictions based on SU(3)F symmetry. This\nanalysis enables the first extraction of the isovector transition magnetic\npolarizability. The possibility that large magnetic fields stabilize strange\nmatter is explored, but such a scenario is found to be unlikely.\n", "  It is well documented that subjecting perpendicular magnetic films which\nexhibit the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) to an in-plane\nmagnetic field results in a domain wall (DW) energy, $\\sigma$, that is highly\nanisotropic with respect to the orientation of the DW in the film plane,\n$\\Theta$. We demonstrate that this anisotropy has a profound impact on the\nelastic response of the DW as characterized by the surface stiffness,\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\Theta) = \\sigma(\\Theta) + \\sigma\"(\\Theta)$, and evaluate its\ndependence on the length scale of deformation. The influence of the stiffness\non DW mobility in the creep regime is assessed, with analytic and numerical\ncalculations showing trends in $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ that better represent\nexperimental measurements of domain wall velocity in magnetic thin films\ncompared to $\\sigma$ alone. Our treatment provides experimental support for\ntheoretical models of the mobility of anisotropic elastic manifolds and makes\nprogress toward a more complete understanding of magnetic domain wall creep.\n", "  We have verified a mechanism for Raman excitation of atoms through continuum\nlevels previously obtained by quantum optimal control using the\nmulti-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF) method. For the\noptimal control, which requires running multiple propagations to determine the\noptimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the\nnecessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization\npathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these\npathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent\norbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman\nexcitation of the Ne $1s^22s^22p^53p^1$ valence state via the metastable\n$1s^22s^12p^63p^1$ resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence\nexcitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a\nshorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This\nprocess represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy\nscheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations.\nAlthough at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the\nMCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization of the atom, at slightly lower\nintensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to\nhold qualitatively. Quantitatively, the MCTDHF populations are reduced from the\nTDCIS calculations by a factor of 4.\n", "  We report the magnetic response of Au/GdFeCo bilayers to optical irradiation\nof the Au surface. For bilayers with Au thickness greater than 50 nm, the great\nmajority of energy is absorbed by the Au electrons, creating an initial\ntemperature differential of thousands of Kelvin between the Au and GdFeCo\nlayers. The resulting electronic heat currents between the Au and GdFeCo layers\nlast for several picoseconds with energy flux in excess of 2 TW m-2, and\nprovide sufficient heating to the GdFeCo electrons to induce deterministic\nreversal of the magnetic moment.\n", "  We present a general theory to explore energy transfer in nonequilibrium\nspin-boson models within the framework of nonequilibrium Green's function\n(NEGF). In contrast to conventionally used NEGF methods based on a perturbation\nexpansion in the system-bath coupling, we adopt the polaron transformation to\nthe Hamiltonian and identify the tunneling term as a perturbation with the\nsystem-bath coupling being treated nonperturbatively, herein termed the\npolaron-transformed NEGF method. To evaluate terms in the Dyson series, we\nfurther utilize the Majorana-fermion representation. The proposed method not\nonly allows us to deal with weak as well as strong coupling regime, but also\nenables an investigation on the role of bias. As an application of the method,\nwe study the energy transfer between two Ohmic bosonic baths mediated by a\nspin. For a unbiased spin system, our energy current result smoothly bridges\npredictions of two benchmarks, namely, the quantum master equation and the\nnonequilibrium non-interacting blip approximation, thus our method is beyond\nexisting theories. In case of a biased spin system, we reveal a bias-induced\nnonmomotonic behavior of the energy conductance in the intermediate coupling\nregime, due to the resonant character of the energy transfer. This finding may\noffer a nontrivial quantum control knob over energy transfer at the nanoscale.\n", "  For theories of relativistic matter fields there exist two possible\ndefinitions of the stress-energy tensor, one defined by a variation of the\naction with the coframes at fixed connection, and the other at fixed torsion.\nThese two stress-energy tensors do not necessarily coincide and it is the\nlatter that corresponds to the Cauchy stress measured in the lab. In this note\nwe discuss the corresponding issue for non-relativistic matter theories. We\npoint out that while the physical non-relativistic stress, momentum, and mass\ncurrents are defined by a variation of the action at fixed torsion, the energy\ncurrent does not admit such a description and is naturally defined at fixed\nconnection. Any attempt to define an energy current at fixed torsion results in\nan ambiguity which cannot be resolved from the background spacetime data or\nconservation laws. We also provide computations of these quantities for some\nsimple non-relativistic actions.\n", "  The correct identification of topological magnetic objects in experiments is\nan important issue. In the present work we report on the characterization of\nmetastable skyrmionic spin structures with various topological charges\n($Q=-3,-2,-1,0,+1,+2$) in the (Pt$_{1-x}$Ir$_{x}$)Fe/Pd(111) ultrathin magnetic\nfilm by performing spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM)\ncalculations. We find that an out-of-plane magnetized tip already results in\ndistinguished SP-STM contrasts for the different skyrmionic structures\ncorresponding to their symmetries. Our work also establishes an understanding\nof the relationship between in-plane SP-STM contrasts and skyrmionic topologies\nthrough an investigation of the variation of the in-plane angle between the\nspins along the perimeter of the structures, which can be characterized by the\nlocal vorticity or linear density of the winding number. For spin structures\nexhibiting a uniform sign of the local vorticity throughout the whole\nskyrmionic area, we demonstrate that (i) $|Q|$ can be determined from a single\nSP-STM image taken by any in-plane magnetized tip, and (ii) an in-plane tip\nmagnetization rotation provides the sign of $Q$ independently of the sign of\nthe effective spin polarization in the tunnel junction. We also discuss cases\nwhere the local vorticity is changing sign. Finally, by increasing the Ir\ncontent of the PtIr overlayer, we find an appearing secondary outer ring\nin-plane SP-STM contrast that is indicative of attractive skyrmions or\nantiskyrmions.\n", "  Efficient sources of individual pairs of entangled photons are required for\nquantum networks to operate using fibre optic infrastructure. Entangled light\ncan be generated by quantum dots (QDs) with naturally small\nfine-structure-splitting (FSS) between exciton eigenstates. Moreover, QDs can\nbe engineered to emit at standard telecom wavelengths. To achieve sufficient\nsignal intensity for applications, QDs have been incorporated into 1D optical\nmicrocavities. However, combining these properties in a single device has so\nfar proved elusive. Here, we introduce a growth strategy to realise QDs with\nsmall FSS in the conventional telecom band, and within an optical cavity. Our\napproach employs droplet-epitaxy of InAs quantum dots on (001) substrates. We\nshow the scheme improves the symmetry of the dots by 72%. Furthermore, our\ntechnique is universal, and produces low FSS QDs by molecular beam epitaxy on\nGaAs emitting at ~900nm, and metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy on InP emitting\nat 1550 nm, with mean FSS 4x smaller than for Stranski-Krastanow QDs.\n", "  The Gaia astrometric mission may offer an unprecedented opportunity to\ndiscover new tidal streams in the Galactic halo. To test this, we apply nGC3, a\ngreat-circle-cell count method that combines position and proper motion data to\nidentify streams, to ten mock Gaia catalogues of K giants and RR Lyrae stars\nconstructed from cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogues. We analyse\ntwo sets of simulations, one using a combination of $N$-body and\nsemi-analytical methods which has extremely high resolution, the other using\nhydro-dynamical methods, which captures the dynamics of baryons, including the\nformation of an in situ halo. These ten realisations of plausible Galactic\nmerger histories allow us to assess the potential for the recovery of tidal\nstreams in different Milky Way formation scenarios. We include the\nGaia~selection function and observational errors in these mock catalogues. We\nfind that the nGC3 method has a well-defined detection boundary in the space of\nstream width and projected overdensity, that can be predicted based on direct\nobservables alone. We predict that about 4-13 dwarf galaxy streams can be\ndetected in a typical Milky Way-mass halo with Gaia+nGC3, with an estimated\nefficiency of $>$80\\% inside the detection boundary. The progenitors of these\nstreams are in the mass range of the classical dwarf galaxies and may have been\naccreted as early as redshift $\\sim3$. Finally, we analyse how different\npossible extensions of the Gaia mission will improve the detection of tidal\nstreams.\n", "  We study four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric $U(N)$ gauge theory\nwith $2N$ fundamental hypermultiplets in the self-dual $\\Omega$-background. The\npartition function simplifies at special points of the parameter space and is\nrelated to the partition function of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on\n$S^{2}$. We also consider the insertion of a Wilson loop operator in\ntwo-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and find the corresponding operator in the\nfour-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory.\n", "  Black holes (BHs) surrounded by accretion disks are present in the Universe\nat different scales of masses, from microquasars up to the active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs). The current picture remains ad hoc due to the complexity of the\nmagnetic field action. In addition, accretion disks at high Eddington rates can\nbe radiation-pressure dominated and, according to some of the heating\nprescriptions, thermally unstable. The observational verification of their\nresulting variability patterns may shed light on both the role of radiation\npressure and magnetic fields. We compute the structure and time evolution of an\naccretion disk, using the code GLADIS (which models the global accretion disk\ninstability). We supplement this model with a modified viscosity prescription,\nwhich can to some extent describe the magnetisation of the disk. We study the\nresults for a large grid of models, to cover the whole parameter space, and we\nderive conclusions separately for different scales of black hole masses, which\nare characteristic for various types of cosmic sources. We show the\ndependencies between the flare or outburst duration, its amplitude, and period,\non the accretion rate and viscosity scaling. We show that if the heating rate\nin the accretion disk grows more rapidly with the total pressure and\ntemperature, the instability results in longer and sharper flares. In general,\nwe confirm that the disks around the supermassive black holes are more\nradiation-pressure dominated and present relatively brighter bursts. Our method\ncan also be used as an independent tool for the black hole mass determination,\nwhich we confront now for the intermediate black hole in the source HLX-1.\n", "  We study high temperature spin transport in a disordered Heisenberg chain in\nthe ergodic regime when bulk dephasing is present. We find that while dephasing\nalways renders the transport diffusive, there is nonetheless a remnant of the\ndiffusive to sub-diffusive transition found in a system without dephasing\nmanifested in the behaviour of the diffusion constant with the dephasing\nstrength. By studying finite-size effects we show numerically and theoretically\nthat this feature is caused by the competition between large crossover length\nscales associated to disorder and dephasing that control the dynamics observed\nin the thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate that this competition may lead to a\ndephasing enhanced transport in this model.\n", "  In the next decade, new astrophysical instruments will deliver the first\nlarge-scale maps of gravitational waves and radio sources. Therefore, it is\ntimely to investigate the possibility to combine them to provide new and\ncomplementary ways to study the Universe. Using simulated catalogues\nappropriate to the planned surveys, it is possible to predict measurements of\nthe cross-correlation between radio sources and GW maps and the effects of a\nstochastic gravitational wave background on galaxy maps. Effects of GWs on the\nlarge scale structure of the Universe can be used to investigate the nature of\nthe progenitors of merging BHs, the validity of Einstein's General Relativity,\nmodels for dark energy, and detect a stochastic background of GW. The results\nobtained show that the galaxy-GW cross-correlation can provide useful\ninformation in the near future, while the detection of tensor perturbation\neffects on the LSS will require instruments with capabilities beyond the\ncurrently planned next generation of radio arrays. Nevertheless, any\ninformation from the combination of galaxy surveys with GW maps will help\nprovide additional information for the newly born gravitational wave astronomy.\n", "  Degenerate perturbation theory from quantum mechanics is inadequate in\ndensity functional theory (DFT) because of nonlinearity in the Kohn-Sham\npotential. Herein, we develop the fully general perturbation theory for\nopen-shell, degenerate systems in Kohn-Sham DFT, without assuming the presence\nof symmetry or equal occupation of degenerate orbitals. To demonstrate the\nresulting methodology, we apply it to the iron atom in the central field\napproximation, perturbed by an electric quadrupole. This system was chosen\nbecause it displays both symmetry required degeneracy, between the five\n3\\textit{d} orbitals, as well as accidental degeneracy, between the 3\\textit{d}\nand 4\\textit{s} orbitals. The quadrupole potential couples the degenerate\n3\\textit{d} and 4\\textit{s} states, serving as an example of the most general\nperturbation.\n", "  Shocks act to convert incoming supersonic flows to heat, and in collisionless\nplasmas the shock layer forms on kinetic plasma scales through collective\nelectromagnetic effects. These collisionless shocks have been observed in many\nspace and astrophysical systems [Smith 1975, Smith 1980, Burlaga 2008, Sulaiman\n2015], and are believed to accelerate particles, including cosmic rays, to\nextremely high energies [Kazanas 1986, Loeb 2000, Bamba 2003, Masters 2013,\nAckermann 2013]. Of particular importance are the class of high-Mach number,\nsupercritical shocks [Balogh 2013] ($M_A\\gtrsim4$), which must reflect\nsignificant numbers of particles back into the upstream to accommodate entropy\nproduction, and in doing so seed proposed particle acceleration mechanisms\n[Blandford 1978, McClements 2001, Caprioli 2014, Matsumoto 2015]. Here we\npresent the first laboratory generation of high-Mach number magnetized\ncollisionless shocks created through the interaction of an expanding\nlaser-driven plasma with a magnetized ambient plasma. Time-resolved,\ntwo-dimensional imaging of plasma density and magnetic fields shows the\nformation and evolution of a supercritical shock propagating at magnetosonic\nMach number $M_{ms}\\approx12$. Particle-in-cell simulations constrained by\nexperimental data show in detail the shock formation, separate reflection\ndynamics of C$^{+6}$ and H$^{+1}$ ions in the multi-species ambient plasma, and\ndensity and magnetic field compressions and overshoots in the shock layer. The\ndevelopment of this experimental platform complements present remote sensing\nand spacecraft observations, and opens the way for controlled laboratory\ninvestigations of high-Mach number collisionless shocks, including the\nmechanisms and efficiency of particle acceleration.\n", "  Quantum number-path entanglement is a resource for super-sensitive quantum\nmetrology and in particular provides for sub-shotnoise or even\nHeisenberg-limited sensitivity. However, such number-path entanglement has\nthought to have been resource intensive to create in the first place ---\ntypically requiring either very strong nonlinearities, or nondeterministic\npreparation schemes with feed-forward, which are difficult to implement.\nRecently in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 170802 (2015)] we showed that number-path\nentanglement from a BosonSampling inspired interferometer can be used to beat\nthe shot-noise limit. In this manuscript we compare and contrast different\ninterferometric schemes, discuss resource counting, calculate exact quantum\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds, and study details of experimental errors.\n", "  We apply the replica trick to compute the entropy of a cylinder amplitude in\nstring theory. We focus on the contribution from non-perturbative winding modes\nand impose tadpole cancellation to understand the correct prescription for\nintegrating over moduli. Choosing the entangling surface to cut longitudinally\nover the whole length of the cylinder, we obtain an answer that is interpreted\nas the entropy of a density matrix. We recast this result in target space\nlanguage, both in the open and closed string picture.\n", "  We study the confinement-deconfinement transition in $SU(2)$ gauge theory in\nthe presence of massless bosons using lattice Monte Carlo simulations. The\nnature of this transition depends on the temporal extent ($N_\\tau$) of the\nEuclidean lattice. We find that the transition is a cross-over for $N_\\tau=2,4$\nand second order with $3D$ Ising universality class for $N_\\tau=8$. Our results\nshow that the second order transition is accompanied by realization of the\n$Z_2$ symmetry.\n", "  The formation and properties of envelope dispersive shock wave (DSW)\nexcitations from repulsive nonlinear waves in a magnetic film are studied.\nExperiments involve the excitation of a spin-wave step pulse in a low-loss\nmagnetic Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ thin film strip, in which the spin-wave amplitude\nincreases rapidly, realizing the canonical Riemann problem of shock theory.\nUnder certain conditions, the envelope of the spin-wave pulse evolves into a\nDSW that consists of an expanding train of nonlinear oscillations with\namplitudes increasing from front to back, terminated by a black soliton. The\nonset of DSW self-cavitation, indicated by a point of zero power and a\nconcomitant 180 phase jump, is observed for sufficiently large steps,\nindicative of the bidirectional dispersive hydrodynamic nature of the DSW. The\nexperimental observations are interpreted with theory and simulations of the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  The mergers of double neutron star (NS-NS) and black hole (BH)-NS binaries\nare promising gravitational wave (GW) sources for Advanced LIGO and future GW\ndetectors. The neutron-rich ejecta from such merger events undergoes rapid\nneutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, enriching our Galaxy with rare\nheavy elements like gold and platinum. The radioactive decay of these unstable\nnuclei also powers a rapidly evolving, supernova-like transient known as a\n\"kilonova\". Kilonovae provide an approximately isotropic electromagnetic\ncounterpart to the GW signal, which also provides a unique and direct probe of\nan important, if not dominant, r-process site. This handbook reviews the\nhistory and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm of week-long\nemission with a spectral peak at near-infrared wavelengths. Using a simple\nlight curve model to illustrate the basic physics, I introduce potentially\nimportant variations on this canonical picture, including: ~day-long optical\n(\"blue\") emission from lanthanide-free components of the ejecta; ~hours-long\nprecursor UV/blue emission, powered by the decay of free neutrons in the\noutermost ejecta layers; and enhanced emission due to energy input from a\nlong-lived central engine, such as an accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. I\nassess the prospects of detecting kilonovae following future GW detections of\nNS-NS/BH-NS mergers in light of the recent follow-up campaign of the LIGO\nbinary BH-BH mergers.\n", "  There is recent evidence that the $XY$ spin model on complex networks can\ndisplay three different macroscopic states in response to the topology of the\nnetwork underpinning the interactions of the spins. In this work, we present a\nnovel way to characterise the macroscopic states of the $XY$ spin model based\non the spectral decomposition of time series using topological information\nabout the underlying networks. We use three different classes of networks to\ngenerate time series of the spins for the three possible macroscopic states. We\nthen use the temporal Graph Signal Transform technique to decompose the time\nseries of the spins on the eigenbasis of the Laplacian. From this\ndecomposition, we produce spatial power spectra, which summarise the activation\nof structural modes by the non-linear dynamics, and thus coherent patterns of\nactivity of the spins. These signatures of the macroscopic states are\nindependent of the underlying networks and can thus be used as universal\nsignatures for the macroscopic states. This work opens new avenues to analyse\nand characterise dynamics on complex networks using temporal Graph Signal\nAnalysis.\n", "  We study a model of interacting fermions in one dimension subject to random,\nuncorrelated onsite disorder. The model realizes an interaction-driven quantum\nphase transition between an ergodic and a many-body localized phase (MBL). We\npropose a single-particle framework to characterize these phases by the\neigenstates (the natural orbitals) and the eigenvalues (the occupation\nspectrum) of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM) in many-body eigenstates.\nAs a main result, we find that the natural orbitals are localized in the MBL\nphase, but delocalized in the ergodic phase. This qualitative change in these\nsingle-particle states is a many-body effect, since without interactions the\nsingle-particle energy eigenstates are all localized. The occupation spectrum\nin the ergodic phase is thermal in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis, while in the MBL phase the occupations preserve a discontinuity at\nan emergent Fermi edge. This suggests that the MBL eigenstates are weakly\ndressed Slater determinants, with the eigenstates of the underlying Anderson\nproblem as reference states. We discuss the statistical properties of the\nnatural orbitals and of the occupation spectrum in the two phases and as the\ntransition is approached. Our results are consistent with the existing picture\nof emergent integrability and localized integrals of motion, or quasiparticles,\nin the MBL phase. We emphasize the close analogy of the MBL phase to a\nzero-temperature Fermi liquid: in the studied model, the MBL phase is\nadiabatically connected to the Anderson insulator and the occupation-spectrum\ndiscontinuity directly indicates the presence of quasiparticles localized in\nreal space. Finally, we show that the same picture emerges for interacting\nfermions in the presence of an experimentally-relevant bichromatic lattice and\nthereby demonstrate that our findings are not limited to a specific model.\n", "  We study the relationship between the granular contact angle distribution and\nlocal particle friction on the macroscopic friction and bulk modulus in\nnon-cohesive disk packings. Molecular dynamics in two dimensions are used to\nsimulate uniaxial loading-unloading cycles imposed on the granular packings.\nWhile macroscopic Mohr-friction depends on the granular pack geometric details,\nit reaches a stationary limit after a finite number of loading-unloading cycles\nthat render well-defined values for bulk modulus, grain coordination, porosity,\nand friction. For random packings and for all polydispersities analyzed, we\nfound that as inter-particle friction increases, the bulk modulus for the limit\ncycle decreases linearly, while the mean coordination number is reduced and the\nporosity increased, also as approximately linear functions. On the other hand,\nthe macroscopic Mohr-friction increases in a monotonous trend with\ninter-particle friction. The latter result is compared to a theoretical model\nwhich assumes the existence of sliding planes corresponding to definite\nMohr-friction values. The simulation results for macroscopic friction are well\ndescribed by the theoretical model that incorporates the local neighbour angle\ndistribution that can be quantified through the contact angle entropy. As local\nfriction is increased, the limit entropy of the neighbour angle distribution is\nreduced, thus introducing the geometric component to granular friction.\nSurprisingly, once the limit cycle is reached, the Mohr-friction seem to be\ninsensitive to polydispersity as has been recently reported.\n", "  Flares from the supermassive black hole in our Galaxy, Sagittarius~A$^\\star$\n(Sgr A$^\\star$), are routinely observed over the last decade or so. Despite\nnumerous observational and theoretical efforts, the nature of such flares still\nremains poorly understood, although a few phenomenological scenarios have been\nproposed. In this work, we develop the Yuan et al. (2009) scenario into a\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for Sgr A$^\\star$ flares. This model is\nanalogous with the theory of solar flares and coronal mass ejection in solar\nphysics. In the model, magnetic field loops emerge from the accretion flow onto\nSgr A$^\\star$ and are twisted to form flux ropes because of shear and\nturbulence. The magnetic energy is also accumulated in this process until a\nthreshold is reached. This then results in a catastrophic evolution of a flux\nrope with the help of magnetic reconnection in the current sheet. In this\ncatastrophic process, the magnetic energy is partially converted into the\nenergy of non-thermal electrons. We have quantitatively calculated the\ndynamical evolution of the height, size, and velocity of the flux rope, as well\nas the magnetic field in the flare regions, and the energy distribution of\nrelativistic electrons in this process. We further calculate the synchrotron\nradiation from these electrons and compare the obtained light curves with the\nobserved ones. We find that the model can reasonably explain the main\nobservations of near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray flares including their light\ncurves and spectra. It can also potentially explain the frequency-dependent\ntime delay seen in radio flare light curves.\n", "  While macroscopic properties of spin glasses have been thoroughly\ninvestigated, their manifestation in the corresponding microscopic\nconfigurations is much less understood. Cases where both descriptions have been\nprovided, such as constraint satisfaction problems, are limited to their ground\nstate properties. To identify the emerging microscopic structures with\nmacroscopic phases at different temperatures, we study the $p$-spin model with\n$p\\!=\\!3$. We investigate the properties of self-sustained clusters, defined as\nvariable sets where in-cluster induced fields dominate over the field induced\nby out-cluster spins, giving rise to stable configurations with respect to\nfluctuations. We compute the entropy of self-sustained clusters as a function\nof temperature and their sizes. In-cluster fields properties and the difference\nbetween in-cluster and out-cluster fields support the observation of\nslow-evolving spins in spin models. The findings are corroborated by\nobservations in finite dimensional lattices at low temperatures.\n", "  Tunneling of a particle through a potential barrier remains one of the most\nremarkable quantum phenomena. Owing to advances in laser technology, electric\nfields comparable to those electrons experience in atoms are readily generated\nand open opportunities to dynamically investigate the process of electron\ntunneling through the potential barrier formed by the superposition of both\nlaser and atomic fields. Attosecond-time and angstrom-space resolution of the\nstrong laser-field technique allow to address fundamental questions related to\ntunneling, which are still open and debated: Which time is spent under the\nbarrier and what momentum is picked up by the particle in the meantime? In this\ncombined experimental and theoretical study we demonstrate that for\nstrong-field ionization the leading quantum mechanical Wigner treatment for the\ntime resolved description of tunneling is valid. We achieve a high sensitivity\non the tunneling barrier and unambiguously isolate its effects by performing a\ndifferential study of two systems with almost identical tunneling geometry.\nMoreover, working with a low frequency laser, we essentially limit the\nnon-adiabaticity of the process as a major source of uncertainty. The agreement\nbetween experiment and theory implies two substantial corrections with respect\nto the widely employed quasiclassical treatment: In addition to a non-vanishing\nlongitudinal momentum along the laser field-direction we provide clear evidence\nfor a non-zero tunneling time delay. This addresses also the fundamental\nquestion how the transition occurs from the tunnel barrier to free space\nclassical evolution of the ejected electron.\n", "  We investigate superconducting interference device (SQUID) with two\nasymmetric Josephson junctions coupled to a mechanical resonator embedded in\nthe loop of the SQUID. We quantize this system in the case when the frequency\nof the mechanical resonator is much lower than the cavity frequency of the\nSQUID and in the case when they are comparable. In the first case, the\nradiation pressure and cross-Kerr type interactions arise and are modified by\nasymmetry. Cross-Kerr type coupling is the leading term at the extremum points\nwhere radiation pressure is zero. In the second case, the main interaction is\nsingle-photon beam splitter, which exists only at finite asymmetry. Another\ninteraction in this regime is of cross-Kerr type, which exists at all\nasymmetries, but generally much weaker than the beam splitter interaction.\nIncreasing magnetic field can substantially enhance optomechanical couplings\nstrength with the potential for the radiation pressure coupling to reach the\nsingle-photon strong coupling regime, even the ultrastrong coupling regime, in\nwhich the single-photon coupling rate exceeds the mechanical frequency.\n", "  The cosmic neutrino flux recently discovered by IceCube will be instrumental\nin probing the highest-energy astrophysical processes. Nevertheless, the origin\nof these neutrinos is still unknown. While it would be more straightforward to\nidentify a transient, or galactic source class, finding a population of\ndistant, continuous sources is challenging. We introduce a source-type\nclassification technique that incorporates all available information from\ncatalogs of source candidates. We show that IceCube-Gen2 can statistically\nestablish the origin of cosmic neutrinos even for the most challenging source\npopulations--starburst galaxies, AGN or galaxy clusters, if neutrino track\ndirections can be reconstructed with a precision ~$0.3^\\circ$. We further show\nthat source catalog out to ~100 Mpc can be sufficient for the most challenging\nsource types, allowing for more straightforward source surveys. We also\ncharacterize the role of detector properties, namely angular resolution, size\nand veto power in order to understand the effects of IceCube-Gen2's design\nspecifics.\n", "  Supersolid inflation is a class of inflationary theories that simultaneously\nbreaks time and space reparameterization invariance during inflation, with\ndistinctive features for the dynamics of cosmological fluctuations. We\ninvestigate concrete realizations of such a scenario, including non-minimal\ncouplings between gravity and the fields driving inflation. We focus in\nparticular on the dynamics of primordial gravitational waves and discuss how\ntheir properties depend on the pattern of symmetry breaking that we consider.\nTensor modes can have a blue spectrum, and for the first time we build models\nin which the squeezed limit of primordial tensor bispectra can be\nparametrically enhanced with respect to standard single-field scenarios. At\nleading order in a perturbative expansion, the tensor-to-scalar ratio depends\nonly on the parameter controlling the breaking of space-reparameterization. It\nis independent from the quantities controlling the breaking of\ntime-reparameterization, and this represents a difference with respect to\nstandard single-field inflationary models.\n", "  Atmospheric tides can strongly affect the rotational dynamics of planets. In\nthe family of Earth-like planets, such as Venus, this physical mechanism\ncoupled with solid tides makes the angular velocity evolve over long timescales\nand determines the equilibrium configurations of their spin. Contrary to the\nsolid core, the atmosphere is submitted to both tidal gravitational potential\nand insolation flux coming from the star. The complex response of the gas is\nintrinsically linked to its physical properties. This dependence has to be\ncharacterized and quantified to study the large variety of extrasolar planetary\nsystems. We develop a theoretical global model where radiative losses, which\nare predominant in slowly rotating atmospheres, are taken into account. We\nanalytically compute the tidal perturbation of pressure, density, temperature\nand velocity field from which we deduce the expressions of atmospheric Love\nnumbers and tidal torque exerted by the star. The dynamics of atmospheric tides\ndepends on the frequency regime of the tidal perturbation: the thermal regime\nnear synchronization and the dynamical regime characterizing fast-rotating\nplanets. The dependence of the torque on the tidal frequency is quantified for\nEarth-like and Venus-like exoplanets and is in good agreement with the results\ngiven by Global Climate Models (GCM) simulations. Introducing dissipative\nprocesses such as radiation regularizes the tidal response of the atmosphere,\notherwise it is singular at synchronization. We demonstrate the important role\nplayed by the physical and dynamical properties of a super-Earth atmosphere\n(e.g. Coriolis, stratification, background pressure, density, temperature,\nradiative emission) and point out the key parameters defining tidal regimes\n(e.g. inertia, Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a, radiative frequencies, tidal frequency) and\ncharacterize the behaviour of the fluid shell with dissipation.\n", "  We search for runaway stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by computing\nthe space velocities of the visually brightest stars in the LMC that are\nincluded in the Gaia TGAS proper motion catalog. We compare with predictions\nfrom stellar dynamical models to obtain (peculiar) velocities relative to their\nlocal stellar environment. Two of the 31 stars have unusually high proper\nmotions. Of the remaining 29 stars we find that most objects in this sample\nhave velocities in very good agreement with model predictions of a circularly\nrotating disk model. Indeed the excellent fit to the model implies that the\nTGAS uncertainty estimates are likely overestimated. The fastest outliers in\nthis subsample contain the LBV R71 and a few other well known emission line\nobjects though in no case do we derive velocities consistent with fast (~100\nkm/s) runaways. Our results imply that R 71 in particular has a moderate\ndeviation from the local stellar velocity field (40 km/s) lending support to\nthe proposition that this object cannot have evolved as a normal single star\nsince it lies too far from massive star forming complexes to have arrived at\nits current position during its lifetime. Our findings therefore strengthen the\ncase for this LBV being the result of binary evolution. Of the two stars with\nunusually high proper motions we find that one, the isolated B1.5 Ia+\nsupergiant Sk-67 2 (HIP 22237), is a candidate hypervelocity star, the TGAS\nproper motion implying a very large peculiar transverse velocity (~360 km/s)\ndirected radially away from the LMC centre. If confirmed, for example by Gaia\nData Release 2, it would imply that this massive supergiant, on the periphery\nof the LMC, is leaving the galaxy where it will explode as a supernova.\n", "  The competition between the torques induced by solid and thermal tides drives\nthe rotational dynamics of Venus-like planets and super-Earths orbiting in the\nhabitable zone of low-mass stars. The tidal responses of the atmosphere and\ntelluric core are related to their respective physical properties and strongly\ndepend on the tidal frequency. The resulting torque determines the possible\nequilibrium states of the planet's spin. We compute here an analytic expression\nfor the total tidal torque exerted on a Venus-like planet. This expression is\nused to characterize the equilibrium rotation of the body. Close to the star,\nthe solid tide dominates. Far from it, the thermal tide drives the rotational\ndynamics of the planet. The transition regime corresponds to the habitable\nzone, where prograde and retrograde equilibrium states appear. We demonstrate\nthe strong impact of the atmospheric properties and of the rheology of the\nsolid part on the rotational dynamics of Venus-like planets, highlighting the\nkey role played by dissipative mechanisms in the stability of equilibrium\nconfigurations.\n", "  We analyze the impact of QCD corrections on limits derived from neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$). As demonstrated previously, the effect of\nthe color-mismatch arising from loops with gluons linking the quarks from\ndifferent color-singlet currents participating in the effective operators has a\ndramatic impact on the predictions for some particular Wilson coefficients.\nHere, we consider all possible contributions from heavy particle exchange, i.e.\nthe so-called short-range mechanism of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. All high-scale\nmodels (HSM) in this class match at some scale around a $\\sim$ few TeV with the\ncorresponding effective theory, containing a certain set of effective\ndimension-9 operators. Many of these HSM receive contributions from more than\none of the basic operators and we calculate limits on these models using the\nlatest experimental data. We also show with one non-trivial example, how to\nderive limits on more complicated models, in which many different Feynman\ndiagrams contribute to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay, using our general method.\n", "  While originally motivated by quantum computation, quantum error correction\n(QEC) is currently providing valuable insights into many-body quantum physics\nsuch as topological phases of matter. Furthermore, mounting evidence\noriginating from holography research (AdS/CFT), indicates that QEC should also\nbe pertinent for conformal field theories. With this motivation in mind, we\nintroduce quantum source-channel codes, which combine features of\nlossy-compression and approximate quantum error correction, both of which are\npredicted in holography. Through a recent construction for approximate recovery\nmaps, we derive guarantees on its erasure decoding performance from\ncalculations of an entropic quantity called conditional mutual information. As\nan example, we consider Gibbs states of the transverse field Ising model at\ncriticality and provide evidence that they exhibit non-trivial protection from\nlocal erasure. This gives rise to the first concrete interpretation of a bona\nfide conformal field theory as a quantum error correcting code. We argue that\nquantum source-channel codes are of independent interest beyond holography.\n", "  Taking the decoherence into account, we investigate nonclassical features of\nthe optical Schr\\\"odinger cat states in one mode and two coupled-modes systems\nwith two-photon driving. In the one mode system, the relationship between the\nSchr\\\"odinger cat states and the system parameters is derived. We observe that\nin the presence of single-photon decay the steady states would be a mixture of\nSchr\\\"odinger cats. The dynamics and steady states of such a cat versus\nsingle-photon decay are examined. In the two coupled-modes cases with linear\nand nonlinear couplings, the dynamics of entanglement and mutual information\nare examined with two different initial states and single-photon decay.\nCompared to the linear coupling case, more complicated structure appears in the\nWigner function in the nonlinear coupling case. The joint quadrature\ndistributions are also explored. Such nonclassical states can be used not only\nin exploring the boundary between the classical and the quantum worlds but also\nin quantum metrology and quantum information processing.\n", "  Asymptotically free renormalization group trajectories can be constructed in\nnonabelian Higgs models with the aid of generalized boundary conditions imposed\non the renormalized action. We detail this construction within the languages of\nsimple low-order perturbation theory, effective field theory, as well as modern\nfunctional renormalization group equations. We construct a family of explicit\nscaling solutions using a controlled weak-coupling expansion in the\nultraviolet, and obtain a standard Wilsonian RG relevance classification of\nperturbations about scaling solutions. We obtain global information about the\nquasi-fixed function for the scalar potential by means of analytic asymptotic\nexpansions and numerical shooting methods. Further analytical evidence for such\nasymptotically free theories is provided in the large-N limit. We estimate the\nlong-range properties of these theories, and identify initial/boundary\nconditions giving rise to a conventional Higgs phase.\n", "  The observed number of dwarf galaxies as a function of rotation velocity is\nsignificantly smaller than predicted by the standard model of cosmology. This\ndiscrepancy cannot be simply solved by assuming strong baryonic feedback\nprocesses, since they would violate the observed relation between maximum\ncircular velocity ($v_{\\rm max}$) and baryon mass of galaxies. A speculative\nbut tantalising possibility is that the mismatch between observation and theory\npoints towards the existence of non-cold or non-collisionless dark matter (DM).\nIn this paper, we investigate the effects of warm, mixed (i.e warm plus cold),\nand self-interacting DM scenarios on the abundance of dwarf galaxies and the\nrelation between observed HI line-width and maximum circular velocity. Both\neffects have the potential to alleviate the apparent mismatch between the\nobserved and theoretical abundance of galaxies as a function of $v_{\\rm max}$.\nFor the case of warm and mixed DM, we show that the discrepancy disappears,\neven for luke-warm models that evade stringent bounds from the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest. Self-interacting DM scenarios can also provide a solution as long as\nthey lead to extended ($\\gtrsim 1.5$ kpc) dark matter cores in the density\nprofiles of dwarf galaxies. Only models with velocity-dependent cross sections\ncan yield such cores without violating other observational constraints at\nlarger scales.\n", "  We use holography to study a $(1+1)$-dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT)\ncoupled to an impurity. The CFT is an $SU(N)$ gauge theory at large $N$, with\nstrong gauge interactions. The impurity is an $SU(N)$ spin. We trigger an\nimpurity Renormalization Group (RG) flow via a Kondo coupling. The Kondo effect\noccurs only below the critical temperature of a large-$N$ mean-field\ntransition. We show that at all temperatures $T$, impurity spectral functions\nexhibit a Fano resonance, which in the low-$T$ phase is a large-$N$\nmanifestation of the Kondo resonance. We thus provide an example in which the\nKondo resonance survives strong correlations, and uncover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating Fano resonances, via RG flows between $(0 + 1)$-dimensional fixed\npoints\n", "  A strategy for generating entanglement in two separated optomechanical\noscillators is analysed, using entangled radiation produced from downconversion\nand stored in an initiating cavity. We show that the use of pulsed entanglement\nwith optimally shaped temporal modes can efficiently transfer quantum\nentanglement into a mechanical mode, then remove it after a fixed waiting time\nfor measurement. This protocol could provide new avenues to test for bounds on\ndecoherence in massive systems that are spatially separated, as originally\nsuggested by Wendell Furry [1] not long after the discussion by\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) and Schrodinger of entanglement.\n", "  We analyze the chiral magnetic effect in a homogeneous neutral plasma from\nthe point of view of energy conservation, and construct an effective potential\nfor the growth of maximally helical perturbations of the electromagnetic field.\nWe show that a negative curvature at the origin of the potential, indicating\ninstability of the plasma, is induced by a chiral asymmetry in electron Fermi\nenergy, as opposed to number density, while the potential grows at large field\nvalue. It follows that the ground state for a plasma has zero magnetic\nhelicity; a nonzero electron mass will allow an excited state of a plasma with\nnonzero helicity to relax to that ground state quickly. We conclude that a\nchiral plasma instability triggered by weak interactions is not a viable\nmechanism for explaining magnetic fields in stars except possibly when dynamics\ndrives the system far from equilibrium.\n", "  We present a fully analytical halo model of colour-dependent clustering that\nincorporates the effects of galactic conformity in a halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD) framework. The model, based on our previous numerical work,\ndescribes conformity through a correlation between the colour of a galaxy and\nthe concentration of its parent halo, leading to a correlation between central\nand satellite galaxy colours at fixed halo mass. The strength of the\ncorrelation is set by a tunable `group quenching efficiency', and the model can\nseparately describe group-level correlations between galaxy colour (1-halo\nconformity) and large scale correlations induced by assembly bias (2-halo\nconformity). We validate our analytical results using clustering measurements\nin mock galaxy catalogs, finding that the model is accurate at the 10-20\npercent level for a wide range of luminosities and length scales. We apply the\nformalism to interpret the colour-dependent clustering of galaxies in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find good overall agreement between the data and\na model that has 1-halo conformity at a level consistent with previous results\nbased on an SDSS group catalog, although the clustering data require satellites\nto be redder than suggested by the group catalog. Within our modelling\nuncertainties, however, we do not find strong evidence of 2-halo conformity\ndriven by assembly bias in SDSS clustering.\n", "  We initiate a study of the bootstrap programme for field theories with BMS\nsymmetry. Specifically, we look at two-dimensional field theories with BMS3\nsymmetry and, using highest weight representations, we construct the BMS\nbootstrap equation by formulating the notion of crossing symmetry in the\nfour-point functions of these field theories. In the limit of large central\ncharges, we find analytic expressions for the BMS blocks that are the basic\ningredients for the solution of the bootstrap equation. This constitutes, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the first example of the formulation and significant\nsteps towards the solution of a bootstrap equation in a theory which is not a\nrelativistic conformal field theory.\n", "  The growing number of phased array feeds (PAF) being built for radio\nastronomy demonstrates an increasing need for low noise amplifiers (LNA) that\nare designed for repeatability, low noise, and ease of manufacture. Specific\ndesign features which help to achieve these goals include the use of unpackaged\ntransistors (for cryogenic operation), single-polarity biasing, straight\nplug-in RF interfaces to facilitate installation and re-work, and the use of\noff-the shelf components. The focal L-band array for the Green Bank Telescope\n(FLAG) is a cooperative effort by Brigham Young University (BYU) and the\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) using warm dipole antennae and\ncryogenic Silicon Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (SiGe HBT) LNAs.\nThese LNAs have an in band gain average of 38 dB and 4.85 Kelvin average noise\ntemperature. Although the FLAG instrument was the driving instrument behind\nthis development, most of the key features of the design and the advantages\nthey offer apply broadly to other array feeds, including independent-beam and\nphased, and for many antenna types such as horn, dipole, Vivaldi,\nconnected-bowtie, etc. This paper will focus on the unique requirements array\nfeeds have for low noise amplifiers and how amplifier manufacturing can\naccommodate these needs.\n", "  In this paper we address the following two closely related questions. First,\nwe complete the classification of finite symmetry groups of type IIA string\ntheory on $K3\\times \\mathbb R^6$, where Niemeier lattices play an important\nrole. This extends earlier results by including points in the moduli space with\nenhanced gauge symmetries in spacetime, or, equivalently, where the world-sheet\nCFT becomes singular. After classifying the symmetries as abstract groups, we\nstudy how they act on the BPS states of the theory. In particular, we classify\nthe conjugacy classes in the T-duality group $O^+(\\Gamma^{4,20})$ which\nrepresent physically distinct symmetries. Subsequently, we make two conjectures\nregarding the connection between the corresponding twining genera of $K3$ CFTs\nand Conway and umbral moonshine, building upon earlier work on the relation\nbetween moonshine and the $K3$ elliptic genus.\n", "  We revisit the effective field theory of the standard model that is extended\nwith sterile neutrinos, $N$. We examine the basis of complete and independent\neffective operators involving $N$ up to mass dimension seven (dim-7). By\nemploying equations of motion, integration by parts, and Fierz and group\nidentities, we construct relations among operators that were considered\nindependent in the previous literature, and find seven redundant operators at\ndim-6, sixteen redundant operators and two new operators at dim-7. The correct\nnumbers of operators involving $N$ are, without counting Hermitian conjugates,\n$16~(L\\cap B)+1~(\\slashed{L}\\cap B)+2~(\\slashed{L}\\cap\\slashed{B})$ at dim-6,\nand $47~(\\slashed{L}\\cap B)+5~(\\slashed{L}\\cap\\slashed{B})$ at dim-7. Here\n$L/B~(\\slashed L/\\slashed B)$ stands for lepton/baryon number conservation\n(violation). We verify our counting by the Hilbert series approach for $n_f$\ngenerations of the standard model fermions and sterile neutrinos. When\noperators involving different flavors of fermions are counted separately and\ntheir Hermitian conjugates are included, we find there are $29~(1614)$ and\n$80~(4206)$ operators involving sterile neutrinos at dim-6 and dim-7\nrespectively for $n_f=1~(3)$.\n", "  Supersymmetric microstate geometries with five non-compact dimensions have\nrecently been shown by Eperon, Reall, and Santos (ERS) to exhibit a non-linear\ninstability featuring the growth of excitations at an \"evanescent ergosurface\"\nof infinite redshift. We argue that this growth may be treated as adiabatic\nevolution along a family of exactly supersymmetric solutions in the limit where\nthe excitations are Aichelburg-Sexl-like shockwaves. In the 2-charge system\nsuch solutions may be constructed explicitly, incorporating full backreaction,\nand are in fact special cases of known microstate geometries. In a near-horizon\nlimit, they reduce to Aichelburg-Sexl shockwaves in $AdS_3 \\times S^3$\npropagating along one of the angular directions of the sphere. Noting that the\nERS analysis is valid in the limit of large microstate angular momentum $j$, we\nuse the above identification to interpret their instability as a transition\nfrom rare smooth microstates with large angular momentum to more typical\nmicrostates with smaller angular momentum. This entropic driving terminates\nwhen the angular momentum decreases to $j \\sim \\sqrt{n_1n_5}$ where the density\nof microstates is maximal. We argue that, at this point, the large stringy\ncorrections to such microstates will render them non-linearly stable. We\nidentify a possible mechanism for this stabilization and detail an illustrative\ntoy model.\n", "  We identify a velocity distribution function of ideal gas particles that is\ncompatible with the local equilibrium assumption and the fundamental\nthermodynamic relation satisfying the endoreversibility. We find that this\ndistribution is a Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution with a spatially uniform\ntemperature and a spatially varying local center-of-mass velocity. We construct\nthe local equilibrium Carnot cycle of an ideal gas, based on this distribution,\nand show that the efficiency of the present cycle is given by the\nendoreversible Carnot efficiency using the molecular kinetic temperatures of\nthe gas. We also obtain an analytic expression of the efficiency at maximum\npower of our cycle under a small temperature difference. Our theory is also\nconfirmed by a molecular dynamics simulation.\n", "  We use three dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to study\nthe effects of magnetic fields on the energy transport and structure of\nradiation pressure dominated main sequence massive star envelopes at the region\nof the iron opacity peak. We focus on the regime where the local thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient\nconvective energy transport. We begin with initially weak magnetic fields\nrelative to the thermal pressure, from 100-1000G in differing geometries. The\nunstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the\nmagnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent\nkinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's\npresence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent\nenvelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons\nto diffuse out through low density regions. Magnetic buoyancy brings small\nscale magnetic fields to the photosphere and increases the vertical energy\ntransport with the energy advection velocity proportional to the Alfv\\'en\nvelocity, although in all cases we study photon diffusion still dominates the\nenergy transport. The increased radiative and advective energy transport causes\nthe stellar envelope to shrink by several scale heights. We also find larger\nturbulent velocity fluctuations compared to the purely hydrodynamic case,\nreaching $\\approx$ 100 km/s at the stellar photosphere. The photosphere also\nshows vertical oscillations with similar averaged velocities and periods of a\nfew hours. The increased turbulent velocity and oscillations will have strong\nimpacts on the line broadening and periodic signals in massive stars.\n", "  The Feynman-Hellmann theorem can be derived from the long Euclidean-time\nlimit of correlation functions determined with functional derivatives of the\npartition function. Using this insight, we fully develop an improved method for\ncomputing matrix elements of external currents utilizing only two-point\ncorrelation functions. Our method applies to matrix elements of any external\nbilinear current, including nonzero momentum transfer, flavor-changing, and two\nor more current insertion matrix elements. The ability to identify and control\nall the systematic uncertainties in the analysis of the correlation functions\nstems from the unique time dependence of the ground-state matrix elements and\nthe fact that all excited states and contact terms are Euclidean-time\ndependent. We demonstrate the utility of our method with a calculation of the\nnucleon axial charge using gradient-flowed domain-wall valence quarks on the\n$N_f=2+1+1$ MILC highly improved staggered quark ensemble with lattice spacing\nand pion mass of approximately 0.15 fm and 310 MeV respectively. We show full\ncontrol over excited-state systematics with the new method and obtain a value\nof $g_A = 1.213(26)$ with a quark-mass-dependent renormalization coefficient.\n", "  The possible disruption of a microtubule during mitosis can control the\nduplication of a cancer cell. Cancer detection and treatment may be possible\nbased on the detection and control of microtubule mechanical oscillations in\ncells through external fields (e.g. electromagnetic or ultrasound). However,\nlittle is known about the dynamic (high-frequency) mechanical properties of\nmicrotubules. Here we propose to control the vibrations of a doubly clamped\nmicrotubule by tip electrodes and to detect its motion via the optomechanical\ncoupling between the vibrational modes of the microtubule and an optical\ncavity. In the presence of a red-detuned strong pump laser, this coupling leads\nto optomechanical induced transparency of an optical probe field, which can be\ndetected with state-of the art technology. The center frequency and linewidth\nof the transparency peak give the resonance frequency and damping rate of the\nmicrotubule respectively, while the height of the peak reveals information\nabout the microtubule-cavity field coupling. Our method should yield new\nknowledge about the physical properties of microtubules, which will enhance our\ncapability to design physical cancer treatment protocols as alternatives to\nchemotherapeutic drugs.\n", "  Although both epitaxial quantum dots (QDs) and colloidal nanocrystals (NCs)\nare quantum-confined semiconductor nanostructures, so far they have\ndemonstrated dramatically-different exciton fine structure splittings (FSSs) at\nthe cryogenic temperature. The single-QD photoluminescence (PL) is dominated by\nthe bright-exciton FSS, while it is the energy separation between bright and\ndark excitons that is often referred to as the FSS in a single NC. Here we show\nthat, in single perovskite CsPbI3 NCs synthesized from a colloidal approach, a\nbright-exciton FSS as large as hundreds of {\\mu}eV can be resolved with two\northogonally- and linearly-polarized PL peaks. This PL doublet could switch to\na single peak when a single CsPbI3 NC is photo-charged to eliminate the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction. The above findings have prepared an\nefficient platform suitable for probing exciton and spin dynamics of\nsemiconductor nanostructures at the visible-wavelength range, from which a\nvariety of practical applications such as in entangled photon-pair source and\nquantum information processing can be envisioned.\n", "  MeV dark matter (DM) particles annihilating or decaying to electron-positron\npairs cannot, in principle, be observed via local cosmic-ray (CR) measurements\nbecause of the shielding solar magnetic field. In this letter, we take\nadvantage of spacecraft Voyager 1's capacity for detecting interstellar CRs\nsince it crossed the heliopause in 2012. This opens up a new avenue to probe DM\nin the sub-GeV energy/mass range that we exploit here for the first time. From\na complete description of the transport of electrons and positrons at low\nenergy, we derive predictions for both the secondary astrophysical background\nand the pair production mechanisms relevant to DM annihilation or decay down to\nthe MeV mass range. Interestingly, we show that reacceleration may push\npositrons up to energies larger than the DM particle mass. We combine the\nconstraints from the Voyager and AMS-02 data to get novel limits covering a\nvery extended DM particle mass range, from MeV to TeV. In the MeV mass range,\nour limits reach annihilation cross sections of order $\\langle \\sigma v\\rangle\n\\sim 10^{-28}{\\rm cm^3/s}$. An interesting aspect is that these limits barely\ndepend on the details of cosmic-ray propagation in the weak reacceleration\ncase, a configuration which seems to be favored by the most recent\nboron-to-carbon ($B/C$) data. Though extracted from a completely different and\nnew probe, these bounds have a strength similar to those obtained with the\ncosmic microwave background --- they are even more stringent for $p$-wave\nannihilation.\n", "  We analyze an open quantum system under the influence of more than one\nenvironment: a dephasing bath and a probability-absorbing bath that represents\na decay channel, as encountered in many models of quantum networks. In our\ncase, dephasing is modeled by random fluctuations of the site energies, while\nthe absorbing bath is modeled with an external lead attached to the system. We\nanalyze under which conditions the effects of the two baths can enter\nadditively the quantum master equation. When such additivity is legitimate, the\nreduced master equation corresponds to the evolution generated by an effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian and a Haken-Strobl dephasing super-operator. We find\nthat the additive decomposition is a good approximation when the strength of\ndephasing is small compared to the bandwidth of the probability-absorbing bath.\n", "  The physical processes taking place at the surface and near the surface of\nsolids is so rich and versatile that sometimes they seem to be the\ninexhaustible subject of fundamental research. In particular, since the\ndiscovery by Lord Rayleigh surface waves in solids focus increased attention of\nscientists, because their experimental and theoretical studies can serve as the\nsource of unique information about the surface impact on the dynamics and\nstructure of the atomic lattice, structural instabilities and phase transitions\ninduced by the surface, and explore the properties of phonons in\nspatially-confined systems The existence of purely shear surface wave is\nimpossible in non-piezoelectrics within the framework of the classical theory\nof elasticity, because the Rayleigh surface waves have different polarization\nand are the mixture of shear and dilatational waves. We showed that the\n\"forbidden\" shear surface wave (shortly Flexo-SW) can propagate near the\nsurface of all crystalline dielectrics due to the omnipresent flexoelectric\ncoupling. The appearance and penetration depth of the Flexo-SW is ruled by the\nflexocoupling strength. In particular the penetration depth of transverse\nacoustic mode diverges in the absence of the flexoelectric coupling and so\nthese waves become indistinguishable from the bulk waves. For paraelectrics\nsuch as strontium titanate with typical flexoeletric coefficients (~2V) the\npenetration depth of the Flexo-SW can reach more than tens microns at THz\nfrequencies. The circumstances can explain the absence of experimental\nobservations of the missed surface waves in thick layers and bulk materials.\nHowever we predict that the peaks of neutron intensity corresponding to the\nsurface Flexo-SW and bulk phonon modes can be separated in non-piezoelectric\nthin films of thickness ~(20 - 50)nm.\n", "  The asymptotical behavior of physical quantities, like the order parameter,\nthe replicon and longitudinal masses, is studied around the zero-field spin\nglass transition point when a small external magnetic field is applied. An\neffective field theory to model this asymptotics contains a small perturbation\nin its Lagrangian which breaks the zero-field symmetry. A first order\nrenormalization group supplemented by perturbational results provides the\nscaling functions. The perturbative zero of the scaling function for the\nreplicon mass defines a generic Almeida-Thouless surface stemming from the\nzero-field fixed point.\n", "  A search is presented for W' bosons in events with an electron or muon and\nlarge missing transverse momentum, using proton-proton collision data at\nsqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector in 2015 and corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. No evidence of an excess of\nevents relative to the standard model expectations is observed. For a W' boson\ndescribed by the sequential standard model, upper limits at 95% confidence\nlevel are set on the product of the production cross section and branching\nfraction and lower limits are established on the new boson mass. Masses below\n4.1 TeV are excluded combining electron and muon decay channels, significantly\nimproving upon the results obtained with the 8 TeV data. Exclusion limits at\n95% confidence level on the product of the W' production cross section and\nbranching fraction are also derived in combination with the 8 TeV data.\nFinally, exclusion limits are set for the production of generic W' bosons\ndecaying into this final state using a model-independent approach.\n", "  A transformation optics approach was used to derive a general method for\ndesigning electromagnetic devices able to manipulate the wave vectors in the\nspecific manner required by the functionality of the device. While the wave\npaths inside the device remain of a secondary importance the wave vectors are\ngradually changed in the desired way by choosing the appropriate coordinate\ntransformation. The proposed method was applied to design both converging and\ndiverging flat lenses. Computer simulations revealed the focusing ability of a\nconverging flat lens designed using the proposed technique.\n", "  For a brief moment, a binary black hole (BBH) merger can be the most powerful\nastrophysical event in the visible universe. Here we present a model fit for\nthis gravitational-wave peak luminosity of nonprecessing quasicircular BBH\nsystems as a function of the masses and spins of the component black holes,\nbased on numerical relativity (NR) simulations and the hierarchical fitting\napproach introduced by X. Jim\\'enez-Forteza et al. [Phys. Rev. D 95, 064024\n(2017), arXiv:1611.00332]. This fit improves over previous results in accuracy\nand parameter-space coverage and can be used to infer posterior distributions\nfor the peak luminosity of future astrophysical signals like GW150914 and\nGW151226. The model is calibrated to the l<=6 modes of 378 nonprecessing NR\nsimulations up to mass ratios of 18 and dimensionless spin magnitudes up to\n0.995, and includes unequal-spin effects. We also constrain the fit to\nperturbative numerical results for large mass ratios. Studies of key\ncontributions to the uncertainty in NR peak luminosities, such as (i) mode\nselection, (ii) finite resolution, (iii) finite extraction radius, and (iv)\ndifferent methods for converting NR waveforms to luminosity, allow us to use NR\nsimulations from four different codes as a homogeneous calibration set. This\nstudy of systematic fits to combined NR and large-mass-ratio data, including\nhigher modes, also paves the way for improved inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform\nmodels.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the role of additional light fields not directly\ncoupled to the background during preheating. We extend our previous study that\nproved that the production of particles associated with such fields can be\nabundant due to quantum corrections, even for the massless states. We also\nobtain the expression for the occupation number operator in terms of\ninteracting fields which includes the non-linear effects important for\nnon-perturbative particle production. We show that adding too many light\ndegrees of freedom without direct interactions with the background might\nattenuate or even quench preheating as the result of backreaction effects.\n", "  We report the detection of two dwarf galaxies in a projected distance of ~50\nkpc from NGC 7331 and suspect the physical nature of dwarfs of this spiral\ngalaxy.\n", "  We analyzed the 2.6-mm CO and 21-cm HI lines toward the Magellanic\nsuperbubble 30 Doradus C, in order to reveal the associated molecular and\natomic gas. We uncovered five molecular clouds in a velocity range from 251 to\n276 km s$^{-1}$ toward the western shell. The non-thermal X-rays are clearly\nenhanced around the molecular clouds on a pc scale, suggesting possible\nevidence for magnetic field amplification via shock-cloud interaction. The\nthermal X-rays are brighter in the eastern shell, where there are no dense\nmolecular or atomic clouds, opposite to the western shell. The TeV $\\gamma$-ray\ndistribution may spatially match the total interstellar proton column density\nas well as the non-thermal X-rays. If the hadronic $\\gamma$-ray is dominant,\nthe total energy of the cosmic-ray protons is at least $\\sim1.2 \\times 10^{50}$\nerg with the estimated mean interstellar proton density $\\sim60$ cm$^{-3}$. In\naddition the $\\gamma$-ray flux associated with the molecular cloud (e.g., MC3)\ncould be detected and resolved by the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). This\nshould permit CTA to probe the diffusion of cosmic-rays into the associated\ndense ISM.\n", "  We study the performance of a single qubit-laser as a quantum sensor to\nmeasure the amplitude and phase of a driving field. By using parameter\nestimation theory we show that certain suitable field quadratures are optimal\nobservables in the lasing phase. The quantum Fisher information scales linearly\nwith the number of bosons and thus the precision can be enhanced by increasing\nthe incoherent pumping acting on the qubit. If we restrict ourselves to\nmeasurements of the boson number observable, then the optimal operating point\nis the critical point of the lasing phase transition. Our results point out to\nan intimate connection between symmetry breaking, dissipative phase transitions\nand efficient parameter estimation.\n", "  The Be X-ray pulsar, SMC X-3 underwent a giant outburst from 2016 August to\n2017 March, which was monitored with the Swift satellite. During the outburst,\nits broadband flux increased dramatically, and the unabsorbed X-ray luminosity\nreached an extreme value of $\\sim 10^{39}$ erg/s around August 24. Using the\nSwift/XRT data, we measure the observed pulse frequency of the neutron star to\ncompute the orbital parameters of the binary system. After applying the orbital\ncorrections to Swift observations, we find that the spin frequency increases\nsteadily from 128.02 mHz on August 10 and approach to spin equilibrium $\\sim\n128.74$ mHz in 2017 January with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{\\rm X} \\sim\n2\\times10^{37}$ erg/s, indicating a strong dipolar magnetic field $B \\sim\n6.8\\times10^{12}$ G at the neutron star surface. The spin-up rate is tightly\ncorrelated with its X-ray luminosity during the super-Eddington outburst. The\npulse profile in the Swift/XRT data is variable, showing double peaks at the\nearly stage of outburst and then merging into a single peak at low luminosity.\nAdditionally, we report that a low temperature ($kT \\sim 0.2$ keV) thermal\ncomponent emerges in the phase-averaged spectra as the flux decays, and it may\nbe produced from the outer truncated disk or the boundary layer between the\nexterior flow and the magnetosphere.\n", "  Cluster expansion (CE) is effective in modeling the stability of metallic\nalloys, but sometimes cluster expansions fail. Failures are often attributed to\natomic relaxation in the DFT-calculated data, but there is no metric for\nquantifying the degree of relaxation. Additionally, numerical errors can also\nbe responsible for slow CE convergence. We studied over one hundred different\nHamiltonians and identified a heuristic, based on a normalized mean-squared\ndisplacement of atomic positions in a crystal, to determine if the effects of\nrelaxation in CE data are too severe to build a reliable CE model. Using this\nheuristic, CE practitioners can determine a priori whether or not an alloy\nsystem can be reliably expanded in the cluster basis. We also examined the\nerror distributions of the fitting data. We find no clear relationship between\nthe type of error distribution and CE prediction ability, but there are clear\ncorrelations between CE formalism reliability, model complexity, and the number\nof significant terms in the model. Our results show that the \\emph{size} of the\nerrors is much more important than their distribution.\n", "  Under a MONDian view, astrophysical systems are expected to follow Newtonian\ndynamics whenever the local acceleration is above the critical $a_{0}=1.2\n\\times 10^{-10} m s^{-2}$, and enter a modified regime for accelerations below\nthis critical value. Indeed, the dark matter phenomenology on galactic and\nsubgalactic scales appears always, and only, at low accelerations. It is\nstandard to find the $a<a_{0}$ regime towards the low density outskirts of\nastronomical systems, where under a Newtonian interpretation, dark matter\nbecomes conspicuous. Thus, it is standard to find, and to think, of the dense\ncentral regions of observed systems as purely Newtonian. However, under\nspherical symmetry in the MONDian as in the Newtonian case, the local\nacceleration will tend to zero as one approaches the very centre of a mass\ndistribution. It is clear that for spherically symmetric systems, an inner\n$a<a_{0}$ region will necessarily appear interior to a critical radius which\nwill depend on the details of the density profile in question. Here we\ncalculate analytically such a critical radius for a constant density core, and\nnumerically for a cored isothermal profile. Under a Newtonian interpretation,\nsuch a central MONDian region will be interpreted as extra mass, analogous to\nthe controversial black holes sometimes inferred to lie at the centres of\nglobular clusters, despite an absence of nuclear activity detected to date. We\ncalculate this effect and give predictions for the \"central black hole\" mass to\nbe expected under Newtonian interpretations of low density Galactic globular\nclusters.\n", "  We introduce the notion of a dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP)\nthat characterises dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) occurring in the\nsubsequent temporal evolution of \"two dimensional\" closed quantum systems,\nfollowing a quench (or ramping) of a parameter of the Hamiltonian, {which\ngeneralizes the notion of DTOP introduced in Budich and Heyl, Phys. Rev. B 93,\n085416 (2016) for one-dimensional situations}. This DTOP is obtained from the\n\"gauge-invariant\" Pancharatnam phase extracted from the Loschmidt overlap,\ni.e., the modulus of the overlap between the initially prepared state and its\ntime evolved counterpart reached following a temporal evolution generated by\nthe time-independent final Hamiltonian. This generic proposal is illustrated\nconsidering DQPTs occurring in the subsequent temporal evolution following a\nsudden quench of the staggered mass of the topological Haldane model on a\nhexagonal lattice where it stays fixed to zero or unity and makes a\ndiscontinuous jump between these two values at critical times at which DQPTs\noccur.\n", "  The phase transition responsible for axion dark matter production can create\nlarge amplitude isocurvature perturbations which collapse into dense objects\nknown as axion miniclusters. We use microlensing data from the EROS survey, and\nfrom recent observations with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam to place constraints\non the minicluster scenario. We compute the microlensing event rate for\nminiclusters treating them as spatially extended objects with an extended mass\nfunction. Using the published bounds on the number of microlensing events we\nbound the fraction of DM collapsed into miniclusters, $f_{\\rm MC}$. For an\naxion with temperature dependent mass consistent with the QCD axion we find\n$f_{\\rm MC}<0.22(m_a/100\\,\\mu\\text{eV})^{-0.57}$, which represents the first\nobservational constraint on the minicluster fraction. We forecast that a\nhigh-efficiency observation of ten nights with Subaru would be sufficient to\nconstrain $f_{\\rm MC}\\lesssim 0.1$ over the entire QCD axion mass range. We\nmake various approximations to derive these constraints and dedicated analyses\nby the observing teams of EROS and Subaru are necessary to confirm our results.\nIf accurate theoretical predictions for $f_{\\rm MC}$ can be made in future then\nmicrolensing can be used to exclude, or discover, the QCD axion. Further\ndetails of our computations are presented in a companion paper.\n", "  In a quantum theory of cosmology spacetime behaves classically only in\nlimited patches of the configuration space on which the wave function of the\nuniverse is defined. Quantum transitions can connect classical evolution in\ndifferent patches. Working in the saddle point approximation and in\nminisuperspace we compute quantum transitions connecting inflationary histories\nacross a de Sitter like throat or a singularity. This supplies probabilities\nfor how an inflating universe, when evolved backwards, transitions and branches\ninto an ensemble of histories on the opposite side of a quantum bounce.\nGeneralising our analysis to scalar potentials with negative regions we\nidentify saddle points describing a quantum transition between a classically\ncontracting, crunching ekpyrotic phase and an inflationary universe.\n", "  Based on recent work, formamide might be a potentially very important\nmolecule in the emergence of terrestrial life. Although detected in the\ninterstellar medium for decades, its formation route is still debated, whether\nin the gas phase or on the dust grain surfaces. Molecular deuteration has\nproven to be, in other cases, an efficient way to identify how a molecule is\nsynthesised. For formamide, new published observations towards the\nIRAS16293-2422 B hot corino show that its three deuterated forms have all the\nsame deuteration ratio, 2--5%, and that this is a factor 3--8 smaller than that\nmeasured for H2CO towards the IRAS16293-2422 protostar. Following a previous\nwork on the gas-phase formamide formation via the reaction NH2 + H2CO -> HCONH2\n+ H, we present here new calculations of the rate coefficients for the\nproduction of monodeuterated formamide through the same reaction, starting from\nmonodeuterated NH2 or H2CO. Some misconceptions regarding our previous\ntreatment of the reaction are also cleared up. The results of the new\ncomputations show that, at the 100 K temperature of the hot corino, the rate of\ndeuteration of the three forms is the same, within 20%. On the contrary, the\nreaction between non-deuterated species proceeds three times faster than that\nwith deuterated ones. These results confirm that a gas-phase route for the\nformation of formamide is perfectly in agreement with the available\nobservations.\n", "  The pseudospin of Dirac electrons in graphene manifests itself in a peculiar\nmomentum anisotropy for photo-excited electron-hole pairs. These interband\nexcitations are in fact forbidden along the direction of the light\npolarization, and are maximum perpendicular to it. Here, we use time- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the resulting\nunconventional hot carrier dynamics, sampling carrier distributions as a\nfunction of energy and in-plane momentum. We first show that the\nrapidly-established quasi-thermal electron distribution initially exhibits an\nazimuth-dependent temperature, consistent with relaxation through collinear\nelectron-electron scattering. Azimuthal thermalization is found to occur only\nat longer time delays, at a rate that depends on the substrate and the static\ndoping level. Further, we observe pronounced differences in the electron and\nhole dynamics in n-doped samples. By simulating the Coulomb- and\nphonon-mediated carrier dynamics we are able to disentangle the influence of\nexcitation fluence, screening, and doping, and develop a microscopic picture of\nthe carrier dynamics in photo-excited graphene. Our results clarify new aspects\nof hot carrier dynamics that are unique to Dirac materials, with relevance for\nphoto-control experiments and optoelectronic device applications.\n", "  Quantum annealing is an optimization technique which potentially leverages\nquantum tunneling to enhance computational performance. Existing quantum\nannealers use superconducting flux qubits with short coherence times, limited\nprimarily by the use of large persistent currents $I_\\mathrm{p}$. Here, we\nexamine an alternative approach, using qubits with smaller $I_\\mathrm{p}$ and\nlonger coherence times. We demonstrate tunable coupling, a basic building block\nfor quantum annealing, between two flux qubits with small ($\\sim\n50~\\mathrm{nA}$) persistent currents. Furthermore, we characterize qubit\ncoherence as a function of coupler setting and investigate the effect of flux\nnoise in the coupler loop on qubit coherence. Our results provide insight into\nthe available design space for next-generation quantum annealers with improved\ncoherence.\n", "  We summarize some predictions from the model of supermassive object with\nmagnetic monopoles which match up with recent astronomical observations\nquantitatively. They may be the signals for existence of magnetic monopoles in\nthe supermassive objects, such as one at the Galactic Center.\n", "  Inclusive isolated-photon production in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV is studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using a data set\nwith an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The cross section is measured\nas a function of the photon transverse energy above 125 GeV in different\nregions of photon pseudorapidity. Next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD and\nMonte Carlo event-generator predictions are compared to the cross-section\nmeasurements and provide an adequate description of the data.\n", "  Spin polarization observables of the deuteron photodisintegration at low\nenergies are studied in a pionless effective field theory up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). The total and differential cross\nsections, induced neutron polarization $P_{y'}$, and tensor analyzing powers\n$T_{20}$ and $T_{22}$ of the process are calculated at photon energies from the\nbreakup threshold to 20~MeV. We find that the NNLO corrections in the cross\nsections and $P_{y'}$ converge well whereas they turn out to be important\ncontributions in $T_{20}$ and $T_{22}$. We discuss the discrepancy between\ntheory and experiment in $P_{y'}$ still persisting as well as an implication of\nour result to the first measurement of $T_{20}$ at low energies in the HIGS\nfacility.\n", "  The morphology of flame fronts propagating in reactive systems comprised of\nrandomly positioned, point-like sources is studied. The solution of the\ntemperature field and the initiation of new sources is implemented using the\nsuperposition of the Green's function for the diffusion equation, eliminating\nthe need to use finite difference approximations. The heat released from\ntriggered sources diffuses outward from each source, activating new sources and\nenabling a mechanism of flame propagation. Systems of $40000$ sources in a\n$200$ by $200$ two-dimensional domain were tracked using computer simulations,\nand statistical ensembles of $120$ realizations of each system were averaged to\ndetermine the statistical properties of the flame fronts. The reactive system\nof sources is parameterized by two non-dimensional values: The heat release\ntime (normalized by interparticle diffusion time) and the ignition temperature\n(normalized by adiabatic flame temperature). These two parameters were\nsystematically varied for different simulations to investigate their influence\non front propagation. For sufficiently fast heat release and low ignition\ntemperature, the front roughness (defined as the RMS deviation of the ignition\ntemperature contour from the average flame position) grew following a power law\ndependence that was in excellent agreement with the KPZ universality class\n($\\beta = 1/3$). As the reaction time was increased, lower values of the\nroughening exponent were observed, and at a sufficiently great value of\nreaction time, reversion to a steady, constant-width thermal flame was observed\nthat matched the solution from classical combustion theory. Deviation away from\nKPZ scaling was also observed as the ignition temperature was increased. The\nfeatures of this system that permit it to exhibit both KPZ and non-KPZ scaling\nare discussed.\n", "  We analyze commonly used expressions for computing the nucleon electric\ndipole form factors (EDFF) $F_3$ and moments (EDM) on a lattice and find that\nthey lead to spurious contributions from the Pauli form factor $F_2$ due to\ninadequate definition of these form factors when parity mixing of lattice\nnucleon fields is involved. Using chirally symmetric domain wall fermions, we\ncalculate the proton and the neutron EDFF induced by the CP-violating quark\nchromo-EDM interaction using the corrected expression. In addition, we\ncalculate the electric dipole moment of the neutron using background electric\nfield that respects time translation invariance and boundary conditions, and\nfind that it decidedly agrees with the new formula but not the old formula for\n$F_3$. Finally, we analyze some selected lattice results for the nucleon EDM\nand observe that after the correction is applied, they either agree with zero\nor are substantially reduced in magnitude, thus reconciling their difference\nfrom phenomenological estimates of the nucleon EDM.\n", "  We study the efficiency of estimation procedures where the temperature of an\nexternal bath is indirectly recovered by monitoring the transformations induced\non a probing system that is put in thermal contact with the bath. In particular\nwe compare the performances of sequential measurement schemes where the probe\nis initialized only once and measured repeatedly during its interaction with\nthe bath, with those of measure & re-prepare approaches where instead, after\neach interaction-and-measurement stage, the probe is reinitialized into the\nsame fiduciary state. From our analysis it is revealed that the sequential\napproach, while being in general not capable of providing the best accuracy\nachievable, is nonetheless more versatile with respect to the choice of the\ninitial state of the probe, yielding on average smaller indetermination levels.\n", "  Radiatively inefficient accretion flow models have been shown to accurately\naccount for the spectrum and luminosity observed from Sgr A* in the X-ray\nregime down to mm wavelengths. However, observations at a few GHz cannot be\nexplained by thermal electrons alone but require the presence of an additional\nnon-thermal particle population. Here, we propose a model for the origin of\nsuch a population in the accretion flow via means of a pulsar orbiting the\nsupermassive black hole in our Galaxy. Interactions between the relativistic\npulsar wind with the disc lead to the formation of a bow shock in the wind.\nDuring the pulsar's transit through the accretion disc, relativistic pairs,\naccelerated at the shock front, are injected into the disc. The radio-emitting\nparticles are long-lived and remain within the disc long after the pulsar's\ntransit. Periodic pulsar transits through the disc result in regular injection\nepisodes of non-thermal particles. We show that for a pulsar with spin-down\nluminosity $L_{\\rm sd} \\sim 3\\times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a wind Lorentz\nfactor of $\\gamma_{\\rm w} \\sim 10^4$ a quasi-steady synchrotron emission is\nestablished with luminosities in the $1-10$ GHz range comparable to the\nobserved one.\n", "  We achieve the strong coupling regime between an ensemble of phosphorus donor\nspins in a highly enriched $^{28}$Si crystal and a 3D dielectric resonator.\nSpins were polarized beyond Boltzmann equilibrium using spin selective optical\nexcitation of the no-phonon bound exciton transition resulting in $N$ =\n$3.6\\cdot10^{13}$ unpaired spins in the ensemble. We observed a normal mode\nsplitting of the spin ensemble-cavity polariton resonances of 2$g\\sqrt{N}$ =\n580 kHz (where each spin is coupled with strength $g$) in a cavity with a\nquality factor of 75,000 ($\\gamma \\ll \\kappa \\approx$ 60 kHz where $\\gamma$ and\n$\\kappa$ are the spin dephasing and cavity loss rates, respectively). The spin\nensemble has a long dephasing time (T$_2^*$ = 9 $\\mu$s) providing a wide window\nfor viewing the dynamics of the coupled spin ensemble-cavity system. The free\ninduction decay shows up to a dozen collapses and revivals revealing a coherent\nexchange of excitations between the superradiant state of the spin ensemble and\nthe cavity at the rate $g\\sqrt{N}$. The ensemble is found to evolve as a single\nlarge pseudospin according to the Tavis-Cummings model due to minimal\ninhomogeneous broadening and uniform spin-cavity coupling. We demonstrate\nindependent control of the total spin and the initial Z-projection of the\npsuedospin using optical excitation and microwave manipulation respectively. We\nvary the microwave excitation power to rotate the pseudospin on the Bloch\nsphere and observe a long delay in the onset of the superradiant emission as\nthe pseudospin approaches full inversion. This delay is accompanied by an\nabrupt $\\pi$ phase shift in the peusdospin microwave emission. The scaling of\nthis delay with the initial angle and the sudden phase shift are explained by\nthe Tavis-Cummings model.\n", "  This work deals with twinlike models that support topological structures such\nas kinks, vortices and monopoles. We investigate the equations of motion and\ndevelop the first order framework to show how to build distinct models with the\nsame solution and energy density, as required to make them twinlike models. We\nalso investigate how the stability under small fluctuations behaves and\nintroduce the conditions to get the same stability on general grounds. In\nparticular, we study models that support kinks, vortices and monopoles in one,\ntwo, and three spatial dimensions, respectively.\n", "  We prove a key result regarding the mass and angular momentum content of\nlinear vacuum perturbations of the Kerr metric obtained through the formalism\ndeveloped by Chrzarnowski, Cohen, and Kegeles (CCK). More precisely we prove\nthat the Abbott-Deser mass and angular momentum integrals of any such\nperturbation vanish, when that perturbation was obtained from a regular Fourier\nmode of the Hertz potential. As a corollary we obtain a generalization of\nprevious results on the completion of the `no string' radiation gauge metric\nperturbation generated by a point particle. We find that for any bound orbit\naround a Kerr black hole, the mass and angular momentum perturbations\ncompleting the CCK metric are simply the energy and angular momentum of the\nparticle \"outside\" the orbit and vanish \"inside\" the orbit.\n", "  Lowered isothermal models, such as the multimass Michie-King models, have\nbeen successful in describing observational data of globular clusters. In this\nstudy we assess whether such models are able to describe the phase space\nproperties of evolutionary $N$-body models. We compare the multimass models as\nimplemented in (Gieles \\& Zocchi) to $N$-body models of star clusters with\ndifferent retention fractions for the black holes and neutron stars evolving in\na tidal field. We find that multimass models successfully reproduce the density\nand velocity dispersion profiles of the different mass components in all\nevolutionary phases and for different remnants retention. We further use these\nresults to study the evolution of global model parameters. We find that over\nthe lifetime of clusters, radial anisotropy gradually evolves from the low-mass\nto the high-mass components and we identify features in the properties of\nobservable stars that are indicative of the presence of stellar-mass black\nholes. We find that the model velocity scale depends on mass as $m^{-\\delta}$,\nwith $\\delta\\simeq0.5$ for almost all models, but the dependence of central\nvelocity dispersion on $m$ can be shallower, depending on the dark remnant\ncontent, and agrees well with that of the $N$-body models. The reported model\nparameters, and correlations amongst them, can be used as theoretical priors\nwhen fitting these types of mass models to observational data.\n", "  We use molecular dynamics to study the vibrations of a thermally fluctuating\ntwo-dimensional elastic membrane clamped at both ends. We directly extract the\neigenmodes from resonant peaks in the frequency domain of the time-dependent\nheight and measure the dependence of the corresponding eigenfrequencies on the\nmicroscopic bending rigidity of the membrane, taking care also of the subtle\nrole of thermal contraction in generating a tension when the projected area is\nfixed. At finite temperatures we show that the effective (macroscopic) bending\nrigidity tends to a constant as the bare bending rigidity vanishes, consistent\nwith theoretical arguments that the large-scale bending rigidity of the\nmembrane arises from a strong thermal renormalization of the microscopic\nbending rigidity. Experimental realizations include covalently-bonded\ntwo-dimensional atomically thin membranes such as graphene and molybdenum\ndisulfide or soft matter systems such as the spectrin skeleton of red blood\ncells or diblock copolymers.\n", "  We have studied the magnetoresistance of the quantum point contact fabricated\non the high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) exposed to microwave\nirradiation. The resistance reveals giant $B$-periodic oscillations with the\nrelative amplitude $\\Delta R/R$ of up to $700$\\% resulting from the propagation\nand interference of the edge magnetoplasmons (EMPs) in the sample. This giant\nphotoconductance is attributed to the considerably large local electron density\nmodulation in the vicinity of the point contact. We have also analyzed the\noscillation periods $\\Delta B$ of the resistance oscillations and, comparing\nthe data with the EMP theory, extracted the EMP interference length $L$. We\nhave found that the length $L$ substantially exceeds the distance between the\ncontact leads but rather corresponds to the distance between metallic contact\npads measured along the edge of the 2DEG. This resolves existing controversy in\nthe literature and should help to properly design highly sensitive microwave\nand terahertz spectrometers based on the discussed effect.\n", "  We present a model for the origin of the extended law of star formation in\nwhich the surface density of star formation ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) depends not\nonly on the local surface density of the gas ($\\Sigma_{g}$), but also on the\nstellar surface density ($\\Sigma_{*}$), the velocity dispersion of the stars,\nand on the scaling laws of turbulence in the gas. We compare our model with the\nspiral, face-on galaxy NGC 628 and show that the dependence of the star\nformation rate on the entire set of physical quantities for both gas and stars\ncan help explain both the observed general trends in the\n$\\Sigma_{g}-\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ and $\\Sigma_{*}-\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ relations, but\nalso, and equally important, the scatter in these relations at any value of\n$\\Sigma_{g}$ and $\\Sigma_{*}$. Our results point out to the crucial role played\nby existing stars along with the gaseous component in setting the conditions\nfor large scale gravitational instabilities and star formation in galactic\ndisks.\n", "  We present a clustering comparison of 12 galaxy formation models (including\nSemi-Analytic Models (SAMs) and Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) models) all\nrun on halo catalogues and merger trees extracted from a single {\\Lambda}CDM\nN-body simulation. We compare the results of the measurements of the mean halo\noccupation numbers, the radial distribution of galaxies in haloes and the\n2-Point Correlation Functions (2PCF). We also study the implications of the\ndifferent treatments of orphan (galaxies not assigned to any dark matter\nsubhalo) and non-orphan galaxies in these measurements. Our main result is that\nthe galaxy formation models generally agree in their clustering predictions but\nthey disagree significantly between HOD and SAMs for the orphan satellites.\nAlthough there is a very good agreement between the models on the 2PCF of\ncentral galaxies, the scatter between the models when orphan satellites are\nincluded can be larger than a factor of 2 for scales smaller than 1 Mpc/h. We\nalso show that galaxy formation models that do not include orphan satellite\ngalaxies have a significantly lower 2PCF on small scales, consistent with\nprevious studies. Finally, we show that the 2PCF of orphan satellites is\nremarkably different between SAMs and HOD models. Orphan satellites in SAMs\npresent a higher clustering than in HOD models because they tend to occupy more\nmassive haloes. We conclude that orphan satellites have an important role on\ngalaxy clustering and they are the main cause of the differences in the\nclustering between HOD models and SAMs.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the magnetic phase transition induced by the\nshort-ranged electron-electron interactions in a Weyl semimetal by using the\nperturbative renormalization-group method. We find that the critical point\nassociated with the quantum phase transition is characterized by a Gaussian\nfixed point perturbed by a dangerously irrelevant operator. Although the\nlow-energy and long-distance physics is governed by a free theory, the\nvelocities of the fermionic quasiparticles and the magnetic excitations suffer\nfrom nontrivial renormalization effects. In particular, their ratio approaches\none, which indicates an emergent Lorentz symmetry at low energies. We further\ninvestigate the stability of the fixed point in the presence of weak disorder.\nWe show that while the fixed point is generally stable against weak disorder,\namong those disorders that are consistent with the emergent chiral symmetry of\nthe clean system, a moderately strong random chemical potential and/or random\nvector potential may induce a quantum phase transition towards a\ndisorder-dominated phase. We propose a global phase diagram of the Weyl\nsemimetal in the presence of both electron-electron interactions and disorder\nbased on our results.\n", "  We use the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-boson formalism to study the temperature\ndependence of paramagnetic phases of the one-band Hubbard model for a variety\nof band structures. We calculate the Fermi liquid quasiparticle spectral weight\n$Z$ and identify the temperature at which it decreases significantly to a\ncrossover to a bad metal region. Near the Mott metal-insulator transition, this\ncoherence temperature $T_\\textrm{coh}$ is much lower than the Fermi temperature\nof the uncorrelated Fermi gas, as is observed in a broad range of strongly\ncorrelated electron materials. After a proper rescaling of temperature and\ninteraction, we find a universal behavior that is independent of the band\nstructure of the system. We obtain the temperature-interaction phase diagram as\na function of doping, and we compare the temperature dependence of the double\noccupancy, entropy, and charge compressibility with previous results obtained\nwith Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. We analyse the stability of the method by\ncalculating the charge compressibility.\n", "  We show that the standard perturbative (i.e., cubic) description of the\nthermal nonlinear response of small metal nanospheres to intense continuous\nwave illumination is insufficient already beyond temperature rises of a few\ntens of degrees. In some cases, a cubic-quintic nonlinear response is\nsufficient to describe accurately the intensity dependence of the temperature,\npermittivity and field, while in other cases, a full non-perturbative\ndescription is required. We further analyze the relative importance of the\nvarious contributions to the thermal nonlinearity, identify a qualitative\ndifference between Au and Ag, and show that the thermo-optical nonlinearity of\nthe host typically plays a minor role, but its thermal conductivity is\nimportant.\n", "  Coupling photons to Rydberg excitations in a cold atomic gas yields\nunprecedentedly large optical nonlinearities at the level of individual light\nquanta, where the formation of nearby dark-state polaritons is blocked by the\nstrong interactions between Rydberg atoms. This blockade mechanism, however,\nrealizes an inherently dissipative nonlinearity, which limits the performance\nof practical applications. In this work, we propose a new approach to strong\nphoton interactions via a largely coherent mechanism at drastically suppressed\nphoton losses. Rather than a polariton blockade, it is based on an interaction\ninduced conversion between distinct types of dark-state polaritons with\ndifferent propagation characteristics. We outline a specific implementation of\nthis approach and show that it permits to turn a single photon into an\neffective mirror with a robust and continuously tuneable reflection phase. We\ndescribe potential applications, including a detailed discussion of achievable\noperational fidelities.\n", "  We present a largely model independent analysis of the lighter Heavy\nQuarkonium Hybrids based on the strong coupling regime of Potential\nNon-Relativistic QCD (pNRQCD). We calculate the spectrum at leading order,\nincluding the mixing of static hybrid states. We use potentials that fulfill\nthe required short and long distance theoretical constraints and fit well the\navailable lattice data. We argue that the decay width to the lower lying Heavy\nQuarkonia can be reliably estimated in some cases, and provide results for a\nselected set of decays. We also consider the mixing with Heavy Quarkonium\nstates. We establish the form of the mixing potential at $O(1/m_Q)$, $m_Q$\nbeing the mass of the heavy quarks, and work out its short and long distance\nconstraints. The weak coupling regime of pNRQCD and the effective string theory\nof QCD are used for that goal. We show that the mixing effects may indeed be\nimportant and produce large spin symmetry violations. Most of the isospin zero\nXYZ states fit well in our spectrum, either as a Hybrid or standard Quarkonium\ncandidates.\n", "  Entanglement growth and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC) are used to\nassess the propagation of information in isolated quantum systems. In this\nwork, using large scale exact time-evolution we show that for weakly disordered\nnonintegrable systems information propagates behind a ballistically moving\nfront, and the entanglement entropy growths linearly in time. For stronger\ndisorder the motion of the information front is algebraic and sub-ballistic and\nis characterized by an exponent which depends on the strength of the disorder,\nsimilarly to the sublinear growth of the entanglement entropy. We show that the\ndynamical exponent associated with the information front coincides with the\nexponent of the growth of the entanglement entropy for both weak and strong\ndisorder. We also demonstrate that the temporal dependence of the OTOC is\ncharacterized by a fast\\emph onnonexponential\\emph default growth, followed by\na slow saturation after the passage of the information front. Finally,we\ndiscuss the implications of this behavioral change on the growth of the\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  The Kagome-lattice-based material, Volborthite, $\\mathrm{Cu_3 V_2 O_7 (OH)_2\n\\cdot 2 H_2 O}$, has been considered as a promising platform for discovery of\nunusual quantum ground states due to the frustrated nature of spin\ninteractions. Here we explore possible quantum spin liquid and magnetically\nordered phases in a two-dimensional non-symmorphic lattice described by $p2gg$\nlayer space group, which is consistent with the spatial anisotropy of the spin\nmodel derived from density functional theory (DFT) for Volborthite. Using the\nprojective symmetry group (PSG) analysis and Schwinger boson mean field theory,\nwe classify possible spin liquid phases with bosonic spinons and investigate\nmagnetically ordered phases connected to such states. It is shown, in general,\nthat only translationally invariant mean field states are allowed in\ntwo-dimensional non-symmorphic lattices, which simplifies the classification\nconsiderably. The mean field phase diagram of the DFT-derived spin model is\nstudied and it is found that possible quantum spin liquid phases are connected\nto two types of magnetically ordered phases, a coplanar incommensurate $(q,0)$\nspiral order as the ground state and a closely competing coplanar commensurate\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$ spin density wave order. In addition, periodicity enhancement of\nthe two-spinon continuum, a signature of symmetry fractionalization, is found\nin the spin liquid phases connected to the $(\\pi,\\pi)$ spin density wave order.\nWe discuss relevance of these results to recent and future experiments on\nVolborthite.\n", "  Interference effects form a fundamental pillar of quantum mechanics. In this\npaper, we examine the interference in spin-orbit coupled transverse magnetic\nfocusing, where a weak magnetic field is used to focus charge carries over\nmesoscopic scales. We determine a semi-classical form for the Green's function\nin a weak magnetic field, for the case of both spin-less and spin-orbit coupled\ncharge carriers. The obtained forms for the Greens' function are independent of\nparticle dispersion and are thus applicable to a wide variety of systems.\n", "  We numerically investigate and experimentally demonstrate an in-situ\ntopological band transition in a highly tunable mechanical system made of\ncylindrical granular particles. This system allows us to tune its\ninter-particle stiffness in a controllable way, simply by changing the contact\nangles between the cylinders. The spatial variation of particles' stiffness\nresults in an in-situ transition of the system's topology. This manifests as\nthe emergence of a boundary mode in the finite system, which we observe\nexperimentally via laser Doppler vibrometry. When two topologically different\nsystems are placed adjacently, we analytically predict and computationally and\nexperimentally demonstrate the existence of a finite-frequency topologically\nprotected mode at their interface.\n", "  The spin-pumping mechanism is probed through a tunnelling MgO interlayer in\nFe/Pt bilayers. We show by ferromagnetic resonance technique and spin-pumping\nexperiments that spin currents can tunnel through the MgO interlayer for\nthickness up to 2~{nm} and can produce significant voltages in the Pt layer.\nThe electrical detection of spin-pumping furthermore reveals the critical role\nof rectification and shunting effects on the generated voltages. The non zero\nspin current transport through a few monolayers of an insulating interlayer\nmight initiate further studies on the role of very thin oxides in spin-pumping\nexperiments.\n", "  By combining bulk sensitive soft-X-ray angular-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and accurate first-principles calculations we explored the bulk\nelectronic properties of WTe$_2$, a candidate type-II Weyl semimetal featuring\na large non-saturating magnetoresistance. Despite the layered geometry\nsuggesting a two-dimensional electronic structure, we find a three-dimensional\nelectronic dispersion. We report an evident band dispersion in the reciprocal\ndirection perpendicular to the layers, implying that electrons can also travel\ncoherently when crossing from one layer to the other. The measured Fermi\nsurface is characterized by two well-separated electron and hole pockets at\neither side of the $\\Gamma$ point, differently from previous more surface\nsensitive ARPES experiments that additionally found a significant quasiparticle\nweight at the zone center. Moreover, we observe a significant sensitivity of\nthe bulk electronic structure of WTe$_2$ around the Fermi level to electronic\ncorrelations and renormalizations due to self-energy effects, previously\nneglected in first-principles descriptions.\n", "  Magnetic Skyrmions belong to the most interesting spin structures for the\ndevelopment of future information technology as they have been predicted to be\ntopologically protected. To quantify their stability, we use an innovative\nmultiscale approach to simulating spin dynamics based on the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The multiscale approach overcomes the\nmicromagnetic limitations that have hindered realistic studies using\nconventional techniques. We first demonstrate how the stability of a Skyrmion\nis influenced by the refinement of the computational mesh and reveal that\nconventionally employed traditional micromagnetic simulations are inadequate\nfor this task. Furthermore, we determine the stability quantitatively using our\nmultiscale approach. As a key operation for devices, the process of\nannihilating a Skyrmion by exciting it with a spin polarized current pulse is\nanalyzed, showing that Skyrmions can be reliably deleted by designing the pulse\nshape.\n", "  Graded index media whose electric susceptibility satisfies the spatial\nKramers-Kronig relations are known to be one-way reflectionless to\nelectromagnetic radiation, for all angles of incidence. We demonstrate how a\nfamily of these media, in addition to being reflectionless, also have\nnegligible transmission. To this end, we discuss how the transmission\ncoefficient for the propagation of waves through a medium whose permittivity is\nbuilt from poles in the complex position plane, with residues that sum to\ninfinity, can be controlled by tuning the positions and residues of the poles.\nIn particular, we have shown how to make the transmission arbitrarily small,\nand hence maximise the absorption of the wave's energy. This behaviour is\nconfirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  Large surveys producing tera- and petabyte-scale databases require\nmachine-learning and knowledge discovery methods to deal with the overwhelming\nquantity of data and the difficulties of extracting concise, meaningful\ninformation with reliable assessment of its uncertainty. This study\ninvestigates the potential of a few machine-learning methods for the automated\nanalysis of eclipsing binaries in the data of such surveys. We aim to aid the\nextraction of samples of eclipsing binaries from such databases and to provide\nbasic information about the objects. We estimate class labels according to two\nclassification systems, one based on the light curve morphology (EA/EB/EW\nclasses) and the other based on the physical characteristics of the binary\nsystem (system morphology classes; detached through overcontact systems).\nFurthermore, we explore low-dimensional surfaces along which the light curves\nof eclipsing binaries are concentrated, to use in the characterization of the\nbinary systems and in the exploration of biases of the full unknown Gaia data\nwith respect to the training sets. We explore the performance of principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest\nclassification and self-organizing maps (SOM). We pre-process the photometric\ntime series by combining a double Gaussian profile fit and a smoothing spline,\nin order to de-noise and interpolate the observed light curves. We achieve\nfurther denoising, and selected the most important variability elements from\nthe light curves using PCA. We perform supervised classification using random\nforest and LDA based on the PC decomposition, while SOM gives a continuous\n2-dimensional manifold of the light curves arranged by a few important\nfeatures. We estimate the uncertainty of the supervised methods due to the\nspecific finite training set using ensembles of models constructed on\nrandomized training sets.\n", "  T2HK and T2HKK are the proposed extensions of the of T2K experiments in Japan\nand DUNE is the future long-baseline program of Fermilab. All these three\nexperiments will use extremely high beam power and large detector volumes to\nobserve neutrino oscillation. Because of the large statistics, these\nexperiments will be highly sensitive to systematics. Thus a small change in the\nsystematics can cause a significant change in their sensitivities. To\nunderstand this, we do a comparative study of T2HK, T2HKK and DUNE with respect\nto their systematic errors. Specifically we study the effect of the systematics\nin the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of the mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{CP}$ in the standard three flavor scenario and also\nanalyze the role of systematic uncertainties in constraining the parameters of\nthe nonstandard interactions in neutrino propagation. Taking the overall\nsystematics for signal and background normalization, we quantify how the\nsensitivities of these experiments change if the systematics are varied from\n$1\\%$ to $7\\%$.\n", "  The goal of this article is to initiate a discussion on what it takes to\nclaim \"there is no new physics at the weak scale,\" namely that the Standard\nModel (SM) is \"isolated.\" The lack of discovery of beyond the SM (BSM) physics\nsuggests that this may be the case. But to truly establish this statement\nrequires proving all \"connected\" BSM theories are false, which presents a\nsignificant challenge. We propose a general approach to quantitatively assess\nthe current status and future prospects of establishing the isolated SM (ISM),\nwhich we give a reasonable definition of. We consider broad elements of BSM\ntheories, and show many examples where current experimental results are not\nsufficient to verify the ISM. In some cases, there is a clear roadmap for the\nfuture experimental program, which we outline, while in other cases, further\nefforts -- both theoretical and experimental -- are needed in order to robustly\nclaim the establishment of the ISM in the absence of new physics discoveries.\n", "  In arXiv:1601.02203, a simple model has been proposed in order to solve one\nof the problems related with the cosmological constant. The model is given by a\ntopological field theory and the model has an infinite numbers of the BRS\nsymmetries. The BRS symmetries are, however, spontaneously broken in general.\nIn this paper, we investigate the BRS symmetry in more details and show that\nthere is one and only one BRS symmetry which is not broken and the unitarity\ncan be guaranteed. In the model, the quantum problem of the vacuum energy,\nwhich may be identified with the cosmological constant, reduces to the\nclassical problem of the initial condition. In this paper, we investigate the\ncosmology given by the model and specify the region of the initial conditions\nwhich could be consistent with the evolution of the universe. We also show that\nthere is a stable solution describing the de Sitter space-time, which may\nexplain the accelerating expansion in the current universe.\n", "  Linear perturbations of the wave dark matter, or $\\psi$ dark matter\n($\\psi$DM), of particle mass $\\sim 10^{-22}$eV in the radiation-dominant era\nare analyzed, and the matter power spectrum at the photon-matter equality is\nobtained. We identify four phases of evolution for $\\psi$DM perturbations,\nwhere the dynamics can be vastly different from the counterparts of cold dark\nmatter (CDM). While in late stages after mass oscillation long-wave $\\psi$DM\nperturbations are almost identical to CDM perturbations, some subtle\ndifferences remain, let alone intermediate-to-short waves that bear no\nresemblance with those of CDM throughout the whole evolutionary history. The\ndissimilarity is due to quantum mechanical effects which lead to severe mode\nsuppression. We also discuss the axion model with a cosine field potential. The\npower spectrum of axion models are generally almost identical to those of\n$\\psi$DM, but in the extreme case when the initial axion angle is near the\nfield potential top, this axion model predict a power excess over a range of\nwave number and a higher spectral cutoff than $\\psi$DM as if $\\psi$DM had a\nhigher particle mass.\n", "  We present the calibration between the dust continuum luminosity and\ninterstellar gas content obtained from the Valpara\\'{i}so ALMA Line Emission\nSurvey (VALES) sample of 67 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at\n0.02<$z$<0.35. We use CO(1-0) observations from the Atacama Large\nMillimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) to trace the molecular gas mass,\n$M_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}$, and estimate the rest-frame monochromatic luminosity at\n850 $\\mu$m, $L_{\\nu_{850}}$, by extrapolating the dust continuum from MAGPHYS\nmodelling of the far-ultraviolet to submillimetre spectral energy distribution\nsampled by the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Adopting $\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}$ = 6.5 (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{2}$)$^{-1}$, the average ratio of\n$L_{\\nu_{850}}/M_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ = (6.4$\\pm$1.4)$\\times10^{19}$ erg s$^{-1}$\nHz$^{-1}$ $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with literature\nvalues. We obtain a linear fit of $\\log_{10}$\n($M_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) = (0.92$\\pm$0.02) $\\log_{10}$\n($L_{\\nu_{850}}$/erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$)-(17.31$\\pm$0.59). We provide relations\nbetween $L_{\\nu_{850}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{ISM}}$ when\ncombining the VALES and literature samples, and adopting a Galactic\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ value.\n", "  Quantum information theory along with holography play central roles in our\nunderstanding of quantum gravity. Exploring their connections will lead to\nprofound impacts on our understanding of the modern physics and is thus a key\nchallenge for present theory and experiments. In this paper, we investigate a\nrecent conjectured connection between reduced fidelity susceptibility and\nholographic complexity (the RFS/HC duality for short). We give a quantitative\nproof of the duality by performing both holographic and field theoretical\ncomputations. In addition, holographic complexity in $AdS_{2+1}$ are explored\nand several important properties are obtained. These properties allow us, via\nthe RFS/HC duality, to obtain a set of remarkable identities of the reduced\nfidelity susceptibility, which may have significant implications for our\nunderstanding of the reduced fidelity susceptibility. Moreover, utilizing these\nproperties and the recent proposed diagnostic tool based on the fidelity\nsusceptibility, experimental verification of the RFS/HC duality becomes\npossible.\n", "  We analyse extreme event statistics of experimentally realized Markov chains\nwith various drifts. Our Markov chains are individual trajectories of a single\natom diffusing in a one dimensional periodic potential. Based on more than 500\nindividual atomic traces we verify the applicability of the Sparre Andersen\ntheorem to our system despite the presence of a drift. We present detailed\nanalysis of four different rare event statistics for our system: the\ndistributions of extreme values, of record values, of extreme value occurrence\nin the chain, and of the number of records in the chain. We observe that for\nour data the shape of the extreme event distributions is dominated by the\nunderlying exponential distance distribution extracted from the atomic traces.\nFurthermore, we find that even small drifts influence the statistics of extreme\nevents and record values, which is supported by numerical simulations, and we\nidentify cases in which the drift can be determined without information about\nthe underlying random variable distributions. Our results facilitate the use of\nextreme event statistics as a signal for small drifts in correlated\ntrajectories.\n", "  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey pipeline photometry underestimates the\nbrightnesses of the most luminous galaxies. This is mainly because (i) the SDSS\noverestimates the sky background and (ii) single or two-component Sersic-based\nmodels better fit the surface brightness profile of galaxies, especially at\nhigh luminosities, than does the de Vaucouleurs model used by the SDSS\npipeline. We use the PyMorph photometric reductions to isolate effect (ii) and\nshow that it is the same in the full sample as in small group environments, and\nfor satellites in the most massive clusters as well. None of these are expected\nto be significantly affected by intracluster light (ICL). We only see an\nadditional effect for centrals in the most massive halos, but we argue that\neven this is not dominated by ICL. Hence, for the vast majority of galaxies,\nthe differences between PyMorph and SDSS pipeline photometry cannot be ascribed\nto the semantics of whether or not one includes the ICL when describing the\nstellar mass of massive galaxies. Rather, they likely reflect differences in\nstar formation or assembly histories. Failure to account for the SDSS\nunderestimate has significantly biased most previous estimates of the SDSS\nluminosity and stellar mass functions, and therefore Halo Model estimates of\nthe z ~ 0.1 relation between the mass of a halo and that of the galaxy at its\ncenter. We also show that when one studies correlations, at fixed group mass,\nwith a quantity which was not used to define the groups, then selection effects\nappear. We show why such effects arise, and should not be mistaken for physical\neffects.\n", "  We investigate the photoproduction of $\\Lambda(1405)\\equiv\\Lambda^*$ hyperon\nresonance, i.e., $\\gamma p\\to K^+\\Lambda^*$, employing the effective Lagrangian\napproach with the $t$-channel Regge trajectories at tree level. We extensively\nexplore the effects from the nucleon resonances in the vicinity of the\nthreshold $\\sqrt{s}_\\mathrm{th}\\approx1900$ MeV, i.e., $N(2000)$, $N(2030)$,\n$N(2055)$, $N(2095)$, and $N(2100)$, and observe that they are of great\nimportance to reproduce the recent CLAS/Jlab experimental data. Total and\ndifferential cross sections are given as numerical results and compared with\nthe experimental data, in addition to the $t$-channel momentum transfer and\nphoton-beam asymmetry. The invariant-mass plots for $\\gamma p\\to\nK^+\\pi^0\\Sigma^0$ via $\\Lambda^*$ are also extracted from the two-body process\nresults, showing a qualitative agreement with the data. We also discuss the\nconstituent-counting rule for the internal structure of $\\Lambda^*$, resulting\nin that $\\Lambda^*$ appears to be different from a simple three-quark $(uds)$\nstate.\n", "  We quantify the amount of regulation required to control growth in living\ncells by a Maximum Entropy approach to the space of underlying metabolic states\ndescribed by genome-scale models. Results obtained for E. coli and human cells\nare consistent with experiments and point to different regulatory strategies by\nwhich growth can be fostered or repressed. Moreover we explicitly connect the\n`inverse temperature' that controls MaxEnt distributions to the growth\ndynamics, showing that the initial size of a colony may be crucial in\ndetermining how an exponentially growing population organizes the phenotypic\nspace.\n", "  We consider a Rashba nanowire with proximity gap which can be brought into\nthe topological phase by tuning external magnetic field or chemical potential.\nWe study spin and charge of the bulk quasiparticle states when passing through\nthe topological transition for open and closed systems. We show, analytically\nand numerically, that the spin of bulk states around the topological gap\nreverses its sign when crossing the transition due to band inversion,\nindependent of the presence of Majorana fermions in the system. This spin\nreversal can be considered as a bulk signature of topological superconductivity\nthat can be accessed experimentally. We find a similar behaviour for the charge\nof the bulk quasiparticle states, also exhibiting a sign reversal at the\ntransition. We show that these signatures are robust against random static\ndisorder.\n", "  Honeycomb iridates such as $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ are argued to realize\nKitaev spin-anisotropic magnetic exchange, along with Heisenberg and possibly\nother couplings. While systems with pure Kitaev interactions are candidates to\nrealize a quantum spin liquid ground state, in $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ it has\nbeen shown that the balance of magnetic interactions leads to the\nincommensurate spiral spin order at ambient pressure below 38 K. We study the\nfragility of this state in single crystals of $\\gamma$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ using\nresonant x-ray scattering (RXS) under applied hydrostatic pressures of up to\n3.0 GPa. RXS is a direct probe of the underlying electronic order, and we\nobserve the abrupt disappearance of the $q$=(0.57, 0, 0) spiral order at a\ncritical pressure $P_c = 1.5\\ $GPa with no accompanying change in the symmetry\nof the lattice. This dramatic disappearance is in stark contrast with recent\nstudies of $\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ that show continuous suppression of the spiral\norder in magnetic field; under pressure, a new and possibly nonmagnetic ground\nstate emerges.\n", "  One of the scientific objectives of the Ooty Wide Field Array(OWFA) is to\nobserve the redshifted HI emission from z ~ 3.35. Although predictions spell\nout optimistic outcomes in reasonable integration times, these studies were\nbased purely on analytical assumptions, without accounting for limiting\nsystematics. A software model for OWFA has been developed with a view to\nunderstanding the instrument-induced systematics, by describing a complete\nsoftware model for the instrument. This model has been implemented through a\nsuite of programs, together called Prowess, which has been conceived with a\ndual role of an emulator as well as observatory data analysis software. The\nprogramming philosophy followed in building Prowess enables any user to define\nan own set of functions and add new functionality. This paper describes a\nco-ordinate system suitable for OWFA in which the baselines are defined. The\nforegrounds are simulated from their angular power spectra. The visibilities\nare then computed from the foregrounds. These visibilities are then used for\nfurther processing, such as calibration and power spectrum estimation. The\npackage allows for rich visualisation features in multiple output formats in an\ninteractive fashion, giving the user an intuitive feel for the data. Prowess\nhas been extensively used for numerical predictions of the foregrounds for the\nOWFA HI experiment.\n", "  We analyze the well observed flare-CME event from October 1, 2011\n(SOL2011-10-01T09:18) covering the complete chain of action - from Sun to Earth\n- for a better understanding of the dynamic evolution of the CME and its\nembedded magnetic field. We study the solar surface and atmosphere associated\nwith the flare-CME from SDO and ground-based instruments, and also track the\nCME signature off-limb from combined EUV and white-light data with STEREO. By\napplying 3D reconstruction techniques (GCS, total mass) to stereoscopic\nSTEREO-SoHO coronagraph data, we track the temporal and spatial evolution of\nthe CME in interplanetary space and derive its geometry and 3D-mass. We combine\nthe GCS and Lundquist model results to derive the axial flux and helicity of\nthe MC from in-situ measurements (Wind). This is compared to nonlinear\nforce-free (NLFF) model results as well as to the reconnected magnetic flux\nderived from the flare ribbons (flare reconnection flux) and the magnetic flux\nencompassed by the associated dimming (dimming flux). We find that magnetic\nreconnection processes were already ongoing before the start of the impulsive\nflare phase, adding magnetic flux to the flux rope before its final eruption.\nThe dimming flux increases by more than 25% after the end of the flare,\nindicating that magnetic flux is still added to the flux rope after eruption.\nHence, the derived flare reconnection flux is most probably a lower limit for\nestimating the magnetic flux within the flux rope. We find that the magnetic\nhelicity and axial magnetic flux are reduced in interplanetary space by ~50%\nand 75%, respectively, possibly indicating to an erosion process. A mass\nincrease of 10% for the CME is observed over the distance range from ~4-20 Rs.\nThe temporal evolution of the CME associated core dimming regions supports the\nscenario that fast outflows might supply additional mass to the rear part of\nthe CME.\n", "  We propose a route towards engineering non-thermal states of matter, which\nshow largely unexplored physics. The main idea relies on the adiabatic passage\nof a thermal ensemble under slow variations of the system Hamiltonian. If the\ntemperature of the initial thermal ensemble is either zero or infinite the\nensemble after the passage is a simple thermal one with the same vanishing or\ninfinite temperature. However, for any finite non-zero temperature intriguing\nnon-thermal ensembles can be achieved. We exemplify this in: (a) a single\noscillator (b) a dimerized interacting one dimensional chain of spinless\nfermions, (c) a BCS-type superconductor and (d) the topological Kitaev chain.\nWe solve these models with a combination of methods; either exactly,\nnumerically using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) or within an\napproximate functional renormalization group (FRG) scheme. The designed states\nshow strongly non-thermal behavior in each of the considered models. For\nexample, for the chain of spinless fermions we exemplify how long ranged\nnon-thermal power-law correlations can be stabilized and for the Kitaev chain\nwe elucidate how the non-thermal ensemble can largely alter the transition\ntemperature separating topological and trivial phases.\n", "  The pion superfluid and the corresponding Goldstone and soft modes are\ninvestigated in two-flavor quark-meson model with functional renormalization\ngroup. By solving the flow equations for the effective potential and the meson\ntwo-point functions at finite temperature and isospin density, the critical\ntemperature for the superfluid increases sizeably in comparison with solving\nthe flow equation for the potential only. The spectral function for the soft\nmode shows clearly a transition from meson gas to quark gas with increasing\ntemperature and a crossover from BEC to BCS pairing of quarks with increasing\nisospin density.\n", "  In the half-filled zero-energy Landau level of bilayer graphene, competing\nphases with spontaneously broken symmetries and an intriguing quantum critical\nbehavior have been predicted. Here we investigate signatures of these\nbroken-symmetry phases in thermal transport measurements. To this end we\ncalculate the spectrum of spin and valley waves in the $\\nu=0$ quantum Hall\nstate of bilayer graphene. The presence of Goldstone modes enables heat\ntransport even at low temperatures, which can serve as compelling evidence for\nspontaneous symmetry breaking. By varying external electric and magnetic fields\nit is possible to determine the nature of the symmetry breaking and\ntemperature-dependent measurements may yield additional information about\ngapped modes.\n", "  We choose a complete set of square integrable functions as basis for the\nexpansion of the wavefunction in configuration space such that the matrix\nrepresentation of the nonrelativistic time-independent wave operator is\ntridiagonal and symmetric. Consequently, the matrix wave equation becomes a\nsymmetric three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the\nwavefunction in this basis. The recursion relation is then solved exactly in\nterms of orthogonal polynomials in the energy. Some of these polynomials are\nnot found in the mathematics literature. The asymptotics of these polynomials\ngive the phase shift of the continuous energy scattering states and the\nspectrum for the discrete energy bound states. Depending on the space and\nboundary conditions, the basis functions are written in terms of either the\nLaguerre or Jacobi polynomials. The tridiagonal requirement limits the number\nof potential functions that yield exact solutions of the wave equation.\nNonetheless, the class of exactly solvable problems in this approach is larger\nthan the conventional class (see Table 12). We also give very accurate results\nfor cases where the wave operator matrix is not tridiagonal but its elements\ncould be evaluated either exactly or numerically with high precision.\n", "  We calculate the g-factor of the 6s6p 3P0 state of 199 and 201 mercury\nisotopes using a relativistic high-precision all-order method that combines the\nconfiguration interaction and the coupled-cluster approaches. Our values\n$g(199Hg) = -0.9485(49)*10^{-3}$ and $g(201Hg) = -0.3504(18)*10^{-3}$ are in\nagreement with the experimental measurements within the 0.5% theoretical\nuncertainty. We also calculate the hyperfine quenching rate of the 6s6p 3P0\nstate in 199Hg and 201Hg and determine its lifetime to be 1.3 and 1.9 s,\nrespectively.\n", "  In the present work, the isotropic and homogenous solutions with spatial\ncurvature $k=0$ of four dimensional Gauss-Bonnet models are characterized. The\nmain assumption is that the scalar field $\\phi$ which is coupled to the\nGauss-Bonnet term has no potential [50]-[51]. Some singular and some eternal\nsolutions are described. The evolution of the universe is given in terms of a\ncurve $\\gamma=(H(\\phi), \\phi)$ which is the solution of a polynomial equation\n$P(H^2, \\phi)=0$ with $\\phi$ dependent coefficients. In addition, it is shown\nthat the initial conditions in these models put several restrictions on the\nevolution. For instance, an universe initially contracting will be contracting\nalways for future times and an universe that is expanding was always expanding\nat past times. Thus, there are no cyclic cosmological solutions for this model.\nThese results are universal, that is, independent on the form of the coupling\n$f(\\phi)$ between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet term. In addition, a\nproof that at a turning point $\\dot{\\phi}\\to0$ a singularity necessarily\nemerges is presented. This is valid unless the Hubble constant $H\\to 0$ at this\npoint. This proof is based on the Raychaudhuri equation for the model. The\ndescription presented here is in part inspired in the works [32]-[34]. However,\nthe mathematical methods that are implemented are complementary of those in\nthese references, and they may be helpful for study more complicated situations\nin a future.\n", "  We study the fluctuations of the work performed on a driven quantum system,\ndefined as the difference between subsequent measurements of energy\neigenvalues. These work fluctuations are governed by statistical theorems with\nsimilar expressions in classical and quantum physics. In this article we show\nthat we can distinguish quantum and classical work fluctuations, as the latter\ncan be described by a macrorealistic theory and hence obey Leggett-Garg\ninequalities. We show that these inequalities are violated by quantum processes\nin a driven two-level system and in a harmonic oscillator subject to a\nsqueezing transformation.\n", "  We construct canonical realizations of the $\\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra as\nsymmetry algebras of a free Klein-Gordon (KG) field in $2+1$ dimensions, for\nboth the massive and massless case. We consider two types of realizations, one\non-shell, written in terms of the Fourier modes of the scalar field, and the\nother one off-shell with non-local transformations written in terms of the KG\nfield and its momenta. These realizations contain both supertranslations and\nsuperrotations, for which we construct the corresponding Noether charges.\n", "  It was recently proposed in\nhttps://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.94.043322 [Herdeiro &\nDoyon Phys.,Rev.,E (2016)] a numerical method showing a precise sampling of the\ninfinite plane 2d critical Ising model for finite lattice subsections. The\npresent note extends the method to a larger class of models, namely the $O(n)$\nloop gas models for $n \\in (1,2]$. We argue that even though the Gibbs measure\nis non local, it is factorizable on finite subsections when sufficient\ninformation on the loops touching the boundaries is stored. Our results attempt\nto show that provided an efficient Markov chain mixing algorithm and an\nimproved discrete lattice dilation procedure the planar limit of the $O(n)$\nmodels can be numerically studied with efficiency similar to the Ising case.\nThis confirms that scale invariance is the only requirement for the present\nnumerical method to work.\n", "  Thanks to their unique properties, nematic liquid crystals feature a variety\nof mechanisms for light-matter interactions. For continuous-wave optical\nexcitations, the two dominant contributions stem from reorientational and\nthermal nonlinearities. We thoroughly analyze the competing roles of these two\nnonlinear responses with reference to self-focusing/defocusing and, eventually,\nthe formation of nonlinear diffraction-free wavepackets, the so-called spatial\noptical solitons. To this extent we refer to dye-doped nematic liquid crystals\nin planar cells and continuous-wave beams at two distinct wavelengths in order\nto adjust the relative weights of the two responses. The theoretical analysis\nis complemented by numerical simulations in the highly nonlocal approximation\nand compared to experimental results.\n", "  Theoretical predictions have lead to the experimental synthesis of new low\ndimensional layered structures. Herein we show for the very first time that\ncompounds of carbon monosulfide exhibit a great variety of layered\nnanostructures, such as chains arrays, monolayers, and thin films. We find that\nthe chains arrays are the most stable because they are mainly\ndimensionality-driven by the $sp^2$ hybridization of sulfur and carbon\norbitals. Furthermore, the chains arrays are direct gap semiconductors. In\ncontrast to thin films, the monolayers are stable at room temperature with a\nsemiconductor phase followed in energy by a metallic phase. Then, we achieve a\nsemiconductor-to-metal phase transition in carbon sulfur monolayers, which can\nbe driven by strain engineering controlling conductivity and carrier mobility.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of relic density of dark matter particles\nco-annihilating with a top or bottom partner, by properly including the QCD\nbound-states (onia) effects of the colored partners, as well as the relevant\nelectroweak processes which become important in the low mass region. We\ncarefully set up the complete framework that incorporates the relevant\ncontributions and investigate their effects on the cosmologically preferred\nmass spectrum, which turn out to be comparable in size to those coming from the\nSommerfeld enhancement. We apply the calculation to three scenarios: bino-stop\nand bino-sbottom co-annihilations in supersymmetry, and a vector dark matter\nco-annihilating with a fermionic top partner. In addition, we confront our\nanalysis of the relic abundance with recent direct detection experiments and\ncollider searches at the LHC, which have important implications in the\nbino-stop and bino-sbottom scenarios. In particular, in the bino-stop case\nrecent LHC limits have excluded regions of parameter with a direct detection\nrate that is above the neutrino floor.\n", "  The interplay of BCS superconductivity and nontrivial band topology is\nexpected to give rise to opportunities for creating topological\nsuperconductors, achieved through pairing spin-filtered boundary modes via\nsuperconducting proximity effects. The thus-engineered topological\nsuperconductivity can, for example, facilitate the search for Majorana fermion\nquasiparticles in condensed matter systems. Here we report a first-principles\nstudy of Mg$_2$Pb and predict that it should be a superconducting topological\nmaterial. The band topology of Mg$_2$Pb is identical to that of the archetypal\nquantum spin Hall insulator HgTe, while isostructural and isoelectronic\nMg$_2$Sn is topologically trivial; a trivial to topological transition is\npredicted for Mg$_2$Sn$_{1-x}$Pb$_x$ for x~0.77. We propose that\nMg$_2$Pb-Mg$_2$Sn quantum wells should generate robust spin-filtered edge\ncurrents in analogy to HgTe/CdTe quantum wells. In addition, our calculations\npredict that Mg$_2$Pb should become superconducting upon electron doping.\nTherefore, Mg$_2$Pb is expected to provide a practical material platform for\nstudying emergent phenomena arising from the interplay of superconductivity and\nband topology.\n", "  We use a set of N-body simulations employing a modified gravity (MG) model\nwith Vainshtein screening to study matter and halo hierarchical clustering. As\ntest-case scenarios we consider two normal branch Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati\n(nDGP) gravity models with mild and strong growth rate enhancement. We study\nhigher-order correlation functions $\\xi_n(R)$ up to $n=9$ and associated\nhierarchical amplitudes $S_n(R)\\equiv\\xi_n(R)/\\sigma(R)^{2n-2}$. We find that\nthe matter PDFs are strongly affected by the fifth-force on scales up to\n$50h^{-1}$Mpc, and the deviations from GR are maximised at $z=0$. For reduced\ncumulants $S_n$, we find that at small scales $R\\leq10h^{-1}$Mpc the MG is\ncharacterised by lower values, with the deviation growing from $7\\%$ in the\nreduced skewness up to even $40\\%$ in $S_5$. To study the halo clustering we\nuse a simple abundance matching and divide haloes into thee fixed number\ndensity samples. The halo two-point functions are weakly affected, with a\nrelative boost of the order of a few percent appearing only at the smallest\npair separations ($r\\leq 5h^{-1}$Mpc). In contrast, we find a strong MG signal\nin $S_n(R)$'s, which are enhanced compared to GR. The strong model exhibits a\n$>3\\sigma$ level signal at various scales for all halo samples and in all\ncumulants. In this context, we find that the reduced kurtosis to be an\nespecially promising cosmological probe of MG. Even the mild nDGP model leaves\na $3\\sigma$ imprint at small scales $R\\leq3h^{-1}$Mpc, while the stronger model\ndeviates from a GR-signature at nearly all scales with a significance of\n$>5\\sigma$. Since the signal is persistent in all halo samples and over a range\nof scales, we advocate that the reduced kurtosis estimated from galaxy\ncatalogues can potentially constitute a strong MG-model discriminatory as well\nas GR self-consistency test.\n", "  We calculate the universal contribution to the $\\alpha$-Renyi entropy from a\ncubic trihedral corner in the boundary of the entangling region in 3+1\ndimensions for a massless free scalar. The universal number, $v_{\\alpha}$, is\nmanifest as the coefficient of a scaling term that is logarithmic in the size\nof the entangling region. Our numerical calculations find that this universal\ncoefficient has both larger magnitude and the opposite sign to that induced by\na smooth spherical entangling boundary in 3+1 dimensions, for which there is a\nwell-known subleading logarithmic scaling. Despite these differences, up to the\nuncertainty of our finite-size lattice calculations, the functional dependence\nof the trihedral coefficient $v_{\\alpha}$ on the R\\'enyi index $\\alpha$ is\nindistinguishable from that for a sphere, which is known analytically for a\nmassless free scalar. We comment on the possible source of this\n$\\alpha$-dependence arising from the general structure of (3+1)-dimensional\nconformal field theories, and suggest calculations past the free scalar which\ncould further illuminate the general structure of the trihedral divergence in\nthe R\\'enyi entropy.\n", "  We show that a quantum subsystem can become significantly entangled with a\nclassical background through a process with little or none semi-classical\nback-reactions. We study two quantum harmonic oscillators coupled to each other\nin a time-independent Hamiltonian. We compare it to its semi-classical\napproximation in which one of the oscillators is treated as the classical\nbackground. In this approximation, the remaining quantum oscillator has an\neffective Hamiltonian which is time-dependent, and its evolution appears to be\nunitary. However, in the fully quantum model, the two oscillators can entangle\nwith each other. Thus the unitarity of either individual oscillator is never\nguaranteed. We derive the critical time scale after which the unitarity of\neither individual oscillator is irrevocably lost. In particular, we give an\nexample that in the adiabatic limit, unitarity is lost before other relevant\nquestions can be addressed.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) group V elemental materials have attracted widespread\nattention due to their nonzero band gap while displaying high electron\nmobility. Using first-principles calculations, we propose a series of new\nelemental bilayers with group V elements (Bi, Sb, As). Our study reveals the\ndynamical stability of 4, 6, and 8-atom ring structures, demonstrating their\npossible coexistence in such bilayer systems. The proposed structures for Sb\nand As are large-gap semiconductors that are potentially interesting for\napplications in future nanodevices. The Bi structures have nontrivial\ntopological properties with a large and direct nontrivial band gap. The\nnontrivial gap is shown to arise from a band inversion at the Brillouin zone\ncenter due to the strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in Bi atoms.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the possibility to tune the properties of these\nmaterials by enhancing the ratio of 6-atom rings to 4 and 8-atom rings, which\nresults in wider nontrivial band gaps and lower formation energies.\n", "  The propagation of nonlinear waves in a lattice of repelling particles is\nstudied theoretically and experimentally. A simple experimental setup is\nproposed, consisting in an array of coupled magnetic dipoles. By driving\nharmonically the lattice at one boundary, we excite propagating waves and\ndemonstrate different regimes of mode conversion into higher harmonics,\nstrongly influenced by dispersion and discreteness. The phenomenon of acoustic\ndilatation of the chain is also predicted and discussed. The results are\ncompared with the theoretical predictions of $\\alpha$-FPU equation, describing\na chain of masses connected by nonlinear quadratic springs. The results can be\nextrapolated to other systems described by this equation.\n", "  We revisit the problem of the bulk-boundary unitarity clash in 2 + 1\ndimensional gravity theories, which has been an obstacle in providing a viable\ndual two-dimensional conformal field theory for bulk gravity in anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) spacetime. Chiral gravity, which is a particular limit of cosmological\ntopologically massive gravity (TMG), suffers from pertur- bative log-modes with\nnegative energies inducing a non-unitary logarithmic boundary field theory. We\nshow here that any f(R) extension of TMG does not improve the situation. We\nalso study the perturbative modes in the metric formulation of minimal massive\ngravity- originally constructed in a first-order formulation-and find that the\nmassive mode has again negative energy except in the chiral limit. We comment\non this issue and also discuss a possible solution to the problem of negative\nenergy modes. In any of these theories, the infinitesimal dangerous\ndeformations might not be integrable to full solutions; this suggests a\nlinearization instability of AdS spacetime in the direction of the perturbative\nlog-modes.\n", "  The X-class solar flare of October 23, 2012, generated continuum photospheric\nemission and a strong helioseismic wave (\"sunquake\") that points to an\nintensive energy release in the dense part of the solar atmosphere. We study\nproperties of the energy release with high temporal and spatial resolutions,\nusing photospheric data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and hard X-ray observations made by the\nRamaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). For this analysis we\nuse level-1 HMI data (filtergrams), obtained by scanning the Fe I line\n(6731~\\AA) with the time cadence of $\\sim 3.6$ s and spatial resolution of\n$\\sim 0.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ per pixel. It is found that the photospheric\ndisturbances caused by the flare spatially coincide with the region of hard\nX-ray emission, but are delayed by $\\lesssim 4$ seconds. This delay is\nconsistent with predictions of the flare hydrodynamics RADYN models. However,\nthe models fail to explain the magnitude of variations observed by the HMI. The\ndata indicate that the photospheric impact and helioseismic wave might be\ncaused by the electron energy flux substantially higher than that in the\ncurrent flare radiative hydrodynamic models.\n", "  Puppis A is a very famous and extensively studied supernova remnant (SNR)\nthat shows strong evidence of shock-cloud interaction. We re-analyze the GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission of it using seven years Pass 8 data recorded by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). The morphology of the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nis more compatible with that of the thermal X-ray and IR emissions than the\nradio image, which suggests a possible correlation between the gamma-ray\nemitting region and dense clouds. The $\\gamma$-ray spectrum in the energy range\nof 1-500 GeV shows a break at $7.92\\pm1.91$ GeV with the photon indices of\n$1.81\\pm0.08$ below the break and $2.53\\pm0.12$ above the break, which can\nnaturally explain the lack of TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission from Puppis A. The\nmulti-wavelength observations favor a hadronic origin for the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission.\n", "  We experimentally study the mechanical pressure exerted by a set of\nrespectively passive isotropic and self-propelled polar disks onto two\ndifferent flexible unidimensional membranes. In the case of the isotropic\ndisks, the mechanical pressure, inferred from the shape of the membrane, is\nidentical for both membranes and follows the equilibrium equation of state for\nhard disks. On the contrary, for the self-propelled disks, the mechanical\npressure strongly depends on the membrane in use, and is thus not a state\nvariable. When self propelled disks are present on both sides of the membrane,\nwe observe an instability of the membrane akin to the one predicted\ntheoretically for Active Brownian Particles against a soft wall. In that case,\nthe integrated mechanical pressure difference across the membrane can not be\ncomputed from the sole knowledge of the packing fractions on both sides; a\nfurther evidence of the absence of equation of state.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope has detected an extended region of GeV\nemission toward the Galactic Center that is currently thought to be powered by\ndark matter annihilation or a population of young and/or millisecond pulsars.\nIn a test of the pulsar hypothesis, we have carried out an initial search of a\n20 deg**2 area centered on the peak of the galactic center GeV excess.\nCandidate pulsars were identified as a compact, steep spectrum continuum radio\nsource on interferometric images and followed with targeted single-dish\npulsation searches. We report the discovery of the recycled pulsar PSR\n1751-2737 with a spin period of 2.23 ms. PSR 1751-2737 appears to be an\nisolated recycled pulsar located within the disk of our Galaxy, and it is not\npart of the putative bulge population of pulsars that are thought to be\nresponsible for the excess GeV emission. However, our initial success in this\nsmall pilot survey suggests that this hybrid method (i.e. wide-field\ninterferometric imaging followed up with single dish pulsation searches) may be\nan efficient alternative strategy for testing whether a putative bulge\npopulation of pulsars is responsible for the GeV excess.\n", "  We demonstrate that two-dimensional atomic emitter arrays with subwavelength\nspacing constitute topologically protected quantum optical systems where the\nphoton propagation is robust against large imperfections while losses\nassociated with free space emission are strongly suppressed. Breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry with a magnetic field results in gapped photonic bands\nwith non-trivial Chern numbers and topologically protected, long-lived edge\nstates. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of constituent emitters, such systems\nprovide a platform for exploring quantum optical analogues of interacting\ntopological systems.\n", "  We study theoretically the edge fracture instability in sheared complex\nfluids, by means of linear stability analysis and direct nonlinear simulations.\nWe derive an exact analytical expression for the onset of edge fracture in\nterms of the shear-rate derivative of the fluid's second normal stress\ndifference, the shear-rate derivative of the shear stress, the jump in shear\nstress across the interface between the fluid and the outside medium (usually\nair), the surface tension of that interface, and the rheometer gap size. We\nprovide a full mechanistic understanding of the edge fracture instability,\ncarefully validated against our simulations. These findings, which are robust\nwith respect to choice of rheological constitutive model, also suggest a\npossible route to mitigating edge fracture, potentially allowing\nexperimentalists to achieve and accurately measure stronger flows than\nhitherto.\n", "  A class of Adaptive Decoders (AD's) for coherent-state sequences is studied,\nincluding in particular the most common technology for optical-signal\nprocessing, e.g., interferometers, coherent displacements and photon-counting\ndetectors. More generally we consider AD's comprising adaptive procedures based\non passive multi-mode Gaussian unitaries and arbitrary single-mode destructive\nmeasurements. For classical communication on quantum phase-insensitive Gaussian\nchannels with a coherent-state encoding, we show that the AD's optimal\ninformation transmission rate is not greater than that of a single-mode\ndecoder. Our result also implies that the ultimate classical capacity of\nquantum phase-insensitive Gaussian channels is unlikely to be achieved with the\nconsidered class of AD's.\n", "  In this work we study the imprints of a primordial cosmic string on\ninflationary power spectrum. Cosmic string induces two distinct contributions\non curvature perturbations power spectrum. The first type of correction\nrespects the translation invariance while violating isotropy. This generates\nquadrupolar statistical anisotropy in CMB maps which is constrained by the\nPlanck data. The second contribution breaks both homogeneity and isotropy,\ngenerating a dipolar power asymmetry in variance of temperature fluctuations\nwith its amplitude falling on small scales. We show that the strongest\nconstraint on the tension of string is obtained from the quadrupolar anisotropy\nand argue that the mass scale of underlying theory responsible for the\nformation of string can not be much higher than the GUT scale. The predictions\nof string for the diagonal and off-diagonal components of CMB angular power\nspectrum are presented.\n", "  A simple approach based on the separation of wounded nucleons in an A-A\ncollision in two categories, those suffering single collisions - corona and the\nrest - core, estimated within a Glauber Monte-Carlo approach, explains the\ncentrality dependence of the light flavor hadrons production in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV. The core contribution does not include\nany dependence of any process on the fireball shape as a function of the impact\nparameter. Therefore, the ratios of the $p_T$ distributions to the one\ncorresponding to the minimum bias pp collisions at the same energy, each of\nthem normalised to the corresponding charged particle density, the $\\langle\np_T\\rangle$ and transverse energy per unit of rapidity are reproduced less\naccurate by such an approach. The results show that the corona contribution\nplays an important role also at LHC energies and it has to be considered in\norder to evidence the centrality dependence of different observables related to\nthe core properties and dynamics.\n", "  Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) provides the only known systematic,\nnonperturbative method for first-principles calculations of nucleon structure.\nHowever, for quantities such as lightfront parton distribution functions (PDFs)\nand generalized parton distributions (GPDs), the restriction to Euclidean time\nprevents direct calculation of the desired observable. Recently, progress has\nbeen made in relating these quantities to matrix elements of spatially\nnonlocal, zero-time operators, referred to as quasidistributions. Even for\nthese time-independent matrix elements, potential subtleties have been\nidentified in the role of the Euclidean signature. In this work, we investigate\nthe analytic behavior of spatially non-local correlation functions and\ndemonstrate that the matrix elements obtained from Euclidean lattice QCD are\nidentical to those obtained using the LSZ reduction formula in Minkowski space.\nAfter arguing the equivalence on general grounds, we also show that it holds in\na perturbative calculation, where special care is needed to identify the\nlattice prediction. Finally we present a proof of the uniqueness of the matrix\nelements obtained from Minkowski and Euclidean correlation functions to all\norder in perturbation theory.\n", "  The existence of baryon asymmetry and dark matter in the Universe may be\nrelated to CP-violating reactions of three heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) with\nmasses well below the Fermi scale. The dynamical description of the lepton\nasymmetry generation, which is the key ingredient of baryogenesis and of dark\nmatter production, is quite complicated due to the presence of many different\nrelaxation time scales and the necessity to include quantum-mechanical coherent\neffects in HNL oscillations. We derive kinetic equations accounting for fermion\nnumber violating effects missed so far and identify one of the domains of HNL\nmasses that can potentially lead to large lepton asymmetry generation boosting\nthe sterile neutrino dark matter production.\n", "  Heavy vector-like quarks (VLQs) appear in many models of beyond the Standard\nModel physics. Direct experimental searches require these new quarks to be\nheavy, $\\gsim$ 800-1000 GeV. We perform a global fit of the parameters of\nsimple VLQ models in minimal representations of $SU(2)_L$ to precision data and\nHiggs rates. An interesting connection between anomalous $Z b {\\overline {b}}$\ninteractions and Higgs physics in VLQ models is discussed. Finally, we present\nour analysis in an effective field theory (EFT) framework and show that the\nparameters of VLQ models are already highly constrained. Exact and approximate\nanalytical formulas for the $S$ and $T$ parameters in the VLQ models we\nconsider are posted at\nhttps://quark.phy.bnl.gov/Digital_Data_Archive/dawson/vlq_17/ as Mathematica\nfiles.\n", "  The galaxy M49 (NGC 4472) is the brightest early-type galaxy in the Virgo\nCluster. It is located in Subcluster B and has an unusually blue, metal-poor\nouter halo. Planetary nebulae (PNe) are excellent tracers of diffuse galaxy and\nintragroup light. We present a photometric survey of PNe in the galaxy's\nextended halo to characterise its PN population, as well as the surrounding\nintragroup light (IGL) of the Subcluster B. PNe were identified based on their\nbright [OIII]5007 \\AA\\ emission and absence of a broad-band continuum. We\nidentify 738 PNe out to a radius of 155 kpc from M49's centre from which we\ndefine a complete sample of 624 PNe within a limiting magnitude of m_5007=28.8.\nComparing the PN number density to the broad-band stellar surface brightness\nprofile, we find a variation of the PN-specific frequency (alpha-parameter)\nwith radius. The outer halo beyond 60 kpc has a 3.2 times higher\nalpha-parameter compared to the main galaxy halo, which is likely due to\ncontribution from the surrounding blue IGL. We use the Planetary Nebulae\nLuminosity Function (PNLF) as an indicator of distance and stellar population.\nIts slope, which correlates empirically with galaxy type, varies within the\ninner halo. In the eastern quadrant of M49, the PNLF slope is shallower,\nindicating an additional localised, bright PN population following an accretion\nevent, likely that of the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC1249. We also determined a\ndistance modulus of mu = 31.29+/-0.08 for M49, corresponding to a physical\ndistance of 18.1+/-0.6 Mpc, which agrees with a recent surface-brightness\nfluctuations distance. The PN populations in the outer halo of M49 are\nconsistent with the presence of a main Sersic galaxy halo with a slight (B-V)\ncolour gradient of 10${}^{-4}$ mag/arcsec surrounded by intragroup light with a\nvery blue colour of (B-V)=0.25 and a constant surface brightness mu_V=28.0\nmag/arcsec${}^2$.\n", "  The Advanced LIGO observatories detected gravitational waves from two binary\nblack hole mergers during their first observation run (O1). We present a\nhigh-energy neutrino follow-up search for the second gravitational wave event,\nGW151226, as well as for gravitational wave candidate LVT151012. We find 2 and\n4 neutrino candidates detected by IceCube, and 1 and 0 detected by ANTARES,\nwithin $\\pm500$ s around the respective gravitational wave signals, consistent\nwith the expected background rate. None of these neutrino candidates are found\nto be directionally coincident with GW151226 or LVT151012. We use non-detection\nto constrain isotropic-equivalent high-energy neutrino emission from GW151226\nadopting the GW event's 3D localization, to less than $2\\times\n10^{51}-2\\times10^{54}$ erg.\n", "  Grids of DAV star models are evolved by \\texttt{WDEC}, taking the element\ndiffusion effect into account. The grid parameters are hydrogen mass\nlog($M_{H}/M_{*}$), helium mass log($M_{He}/M_{*}$), stellar mass $M_{\\rm *}$,\nand effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$ for DAV stars. The core compositions\nare from white dwarf models evolved by \\texttt{MESA}. Therefore, those DAV star\nmodels evolved by \\texttt{WDEC} have historically viable core compositions.\nBased on those DAV star models, we studied the rate of period change\n($\\dot{P}(k)$) for different values of H, He, $M_{\\rm *}$, and $T_{\\rm eff}$.\nThe results are consistent with previous work. Two DAV stars G117-B15A and R548\nhave been observed around forty years. The rates of period change of two\nlarge-amplitude modes were obtained through O-C method. We did\nasteroseismological study on the two DAV stars and then obtained a best-fitting\nmodel for each star. Based on the two best-fitting models, the mode\nidentifications ($l$, $k$) of the observed modes for G117-B15A and R548 are\nconsistent with previous work. Both the observed modes and the observed\n$\\dot{P}$s can be fitted by calculated ones. The results indicate that our\nmethod of evolving DAV star models is feasible.\n", "  The first measurement of the jet mass m[jet] of top quark jets produced in t\nt-bar events from pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is reported for the jet with\nthe largest transverse momentum pt in highly boosted hadronic top quark decays.\nThe data sample, collected with the CMS detector, corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The measurement is performed in the\nlepton+jets channel in which the products of the semileptonic decay t to bW\nwith W to l nu where l is an electron or muon, are used to select t t-bar\nevents with large Lorentz boosts. The products of the fully hadronic decay t to\nbW with W to q q'-bar are reconstructed using a single Cambridge-Aachen jet\nwith distance parameter R = 1.2, and pt > 400 GeV. The t t-bar cross section as\na function of m[jet] is unfolded at the particle level and is used to test the\nmodelling of highly boosted top quark production. The peak position of the\nm[jet] distribution is sensitive to the top quark mass m[t], and the data are\nused to extract a value of m[t] to assess this sensitivity.\n", "  We study the size-dependent exciton fine structure in monolayer black\nphosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) deposited on different substrates (isolated, Si\nand SiO$_2$) using a combination of tight-binding method to calculate the\nsingle-particle states, and the configuration interaction formalism to\ndetermine the excitonic spectrum. We demonstrate that the substrate plays a\ndramatic role on the excitonic gaps and excitonic spectrum of the QDs. For\nreasonably high dielectric constants ($\\varepsilon_{sub} \\sim \\varepsilon_{Si}\n= 11.7 \\varepsilon_0$), the excitonic gap can be described by a single power\nlaw $E_X(R) = E_X^{(bulk)} + C/R^{\\gamma}$. For low dielectric constants\n$\\varepsilon_{sub} \\leq \\varepsilon_{SiO_2} = 3.9 \\varepsilon_0$, the size\ndependence of the excitonic gaps requires the sum of two power laws $E_X(R) =\nE_g^{(bulk)} + A/ R^{n} - B/R^{m}$ to describe both strong and weak quantum\nconfinement regimes, where $A$, $B$, $C$, $\\gamma$, $n$, and $m$ are\nsubstrate-dependent parameters. We also predict that the exciton lifetimes\nexhibit a strong temperature dependence, ranging between 2-8 ns (Si substrate)\nand 3-11 ns (SiO$_2$ substrate) for QDs up 10 nm in size.\n", "  Beaming effect is important for the observational properties of blazars. In\nthis work, we collect 91 $Fermi$ blazars with available radio Doppler factors.\n$\\gamma$-ray Doppler factors are estimated and compared with radio Doppler\nfactors for some sources. The intrinsic (de-beamed) $\\gamma$-ray flux density\n($f^{\\rm in}_{\\gamma}$), intrinsic $\\gamma$-ray luminosity ($L^{\\rm\nin}_{\\gamma}$), and intrinsic synchrotron peak frequency ($\\nu_{\\rm p}^{\\rm\nin}$) are calculated. Then we study the correlations between $f^{\\rm\nin}_{\\gamma}$ and redshift and find that they follow the theoretical relation:\n$\\log f = -2.0 \\log z + {\\rm const}$. When the subclasses are considered, we\nfind that stationary jets are perhaps dominant in low synchrotron peaked\nblazars. 63 $Fermi$ blazars with both available short variability time scales\n($\\Delta T$) and Doppler factors are also collected. We find that the intrinsic\nrelationship between $L ^{\\rm in}_{\\gamma}$ and $\\Delta T^{\\rm in}$ obeys the\nElliot \\& Shapiro and the Abramowicz \\& Nobili relations. Strong positive\ncorrelation between $f_{\\gamma}^{\\rm in}$ and $\\nu_{\\rm p}^{\\rm in}$ is found,\nsuggesting that synchrotron emissions are highly correlated with $\\gamma$-ray\nemissions.\n", "  We provide the necessary framework for carrying out stochastic positive-P and\ngauge-P simulations of bosonic systems with long range interactions. In these\napproaches, the quantum evolution is sampled by trajectories in phase space,\nallowing calculation of correlations without truncation of the Hilbert space or\nother approximations to the quantum state. The main drawback is that the\nsimulation time is limited by noise arising from interactions.\n  We show that the long-range character of these interactions does not further\nincrease the limitations of these methods, in contrast to the situation for\nalternatives such as the density matrix renormalisation group. Furthermore,\nstochastic gauge techniques can also successfully extend simulation times in\nthe long-range-interaction case, by making using of parameters that affect the\nnoise properties of trajectories, without affecting physical observables.\n  We derive essential results that significantly aid the use of these methods:\nestimates of the available simulation time, optimized stochastic gauges, a\ngeneral form of the characteristic stochastic variance and adaptations for very\nlarge systems. Testing the performance of particular drift and diffusion gauges\nfor nonlocal interactions, we find that, for small to medium systems, drift\ngauges are beneficial, whereas for sufficiently large systems, it is optimal to\nuse only a diffusion gauge.\n  The methods are illustrated with direct numerical simulations of interaction\nquenches in extended Bose-Hubbard lattice systems and the excitation of Rydberg\nstates in a Bose-Einstein condensate, also without the need for the typical\nfrozen gas approximation. We demonstrate that gauges can indeed lengthen the\nuseful simulation time.\n", "  We study an inverse seesaw model of neutrino mass within the framework of\n$S_4$ flavour symmetry from the requirement of generating non-zero reactor\nmixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ along with correct dark matter relic abundance. The\nleading order $S_4$ model gives rise to tri-bimaximal type leptonic mixing\nresulting in $\\theta_{13}=0$. Non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ is generated at one loop\nlevel by extending the model with additional scalar and fermion fields which\ntake part in the loop correction. The particles going inside the loop are odd\nunder an in-built $Z^{\\text{Dark}}_2$ symmetry such that the lightest\n$Z^{\\text{Dark}}_2$ odd particle can be a dark matter candidate. Correct\nneutrino and dark matter phenomenology can be achieved for such one loop\ncorrections either to the light neutrino mass matrix or to the charged lepton\nmass matrix although the latter case is found to be more predictive. The\npredictions for neutrinoless double beta decay is also discussed and inverted\nhierarchy in the charged lepton correction case is found to be disfavoured by\nthe latest KamLAND-Zen data.\n", "  Imaging studies with the VLA have revealed HI emission associated with the\nextended circumstellar shells of red giants. We analyse the spectral map\nobtained on Y CVn, a J-type carbon star on the AGB. The HI line profiles can be\ninterpreted with a model of a detached shell resulting from the interaction of\na stellar outflow with the local interstellar medium. We reproduce the spectral\nmap by introducing a distortion along a direction corresponding to the star's\nmotion in space. We then use this fitting to simulate observations expected\nfrom the FAST radiotelescope, and discuss its potential for improving\nourdescription of the outer regions of circumstellar shells.\n", "  Scalar tops in the supersymmetric model affect the potential of the standard\nmodel-like Higgs at the quatum level. In light of the equivalence theorem, the\ndeviation of the potential from the standard model can be traced by\nlongitudinal gauge bosons. In this work, high energy longitudinal W boson\nscattering is studied in a TeV-scale scalar top scenario. O(1-10%) deviation\nfrom the standard model prediction in the differential cross section is found\ndepending on whether the observed Higgs mass is explained only by scalar tops\nor by additional contributions at a higher scale.\n", "  The Milky Way bulge shows a box/peanut or X-shaped bulge (hereafter BP/X)\nwhen viewed in infrared or microwave bands. We examine orbits in an N-body\nmodel of a barred disk galaxy that is scaled to match the kinematics of the\nMilky Way (MW) bulge. We generate maps of projected stellar surface density,\nunsharp masked images, 3D excess-mass distributions (showing mass outside\nellipsoids), line-of-sight number count distributions, and 2D line-of-sight\nkinematics for the simulation as well as co-added orbit families, in order to\nidentify the orbits primarily responsible for the BP/X shape. We estimate that\nbetween 19-23\\% of the mass of the bar is associated with the BP/X shape and\nthat most bar orbits contribute to this shape which is clearly seen in\nprojected surface density maps and 3D excess mass for non-resonant box orbits,\n\"banana\" orbits, \"fish/pretzel\" orbits and \"brezel\" orbits. {We find that\nnearly all bar orbit families contribute some mass to the 3D BP/X-shape. All\nco-added orbit families show a bifurcation in stellar number count distribution\nwith heliocentric distance that resembles the bifurcation observed in red clump\nstars in the MW. However, only the box orbit family shows an increasing\nseparation of peaks with increasing galactic latitude $|b|$, similar to that\nobserved.} Our analysis shows that no single orbit family fully explains all\nthe observed features associated with the MW's BP/X shaped bulge, but\ncollectively the non-resonant boxes and various resonant boxlet orbits\ncontribute at different distances from the center to produce this feature. We\npropose that since box orbits have three incommensurable orbital fundamental\nfrequencies, their 3-dimensional shapes are highly flexible and, like Lissajous\nfigures, this family of orbits is most easily able to adapt to evolution in the\nshape of the underlying potential.\n", "  CONTEXT - Transient low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) often show outbursts\nlasting typically a few-weeks and characterized by a high X-ray luminosity\n($L_{x} \\approx 10^{36}-10^{38}$ erg/sec), while for most of the time they are\nfound in X-ray quiescence ($L_X\\approx10^{31} -10^{33}$ erg/sec). EXO 1745-248\nis one of them. AIMS - The broad-band coverage, and the sensitivity of\ninstrument on board of {\\xmm} and {\\igr}, offers the opportunity to\ncharacterize the hard X-ray spectrum during {\\exo} outburst. METHODS - In this\npaper we report on quasi-simultaneous {\\xmm} and {\\igr} observations of the\nX-ray transient {\\exo} located in the globular cluster Terzan 5, performed ten\ndays after the beginning of the outburst (on 2015 March 16th) shown by the\nsource between March and June 2015. The source was caught in a hard state,\nemitting a 0.8-100 keV luminosity of $\\simeq10^{37}$~{\\lumcgs}. RESULTS - The\nspectral continuum was dominated by thermal Comptonization of seed photons with\ntemperature $kT_{in}\\simeq1.3$ keV, by a cloud with moderate optical depth\n$\\tau\\simeq2$ and electron temperature $kT_e\\simeq 40$ keV. A weaker soft\nthermal component at temperature $kT_{th}\\simeq0.6$--0.7 keV and compatible\nwith a fraction of the neutron star radius was also detected. A rich emission\nline spectrum was observed by the EPIC-pn on-board {\\xmm}; features at energies\ncompatible with K-$\\alpha$ transitions of ionized sulfur, argon, calcium and\niron were detected, with a broadness compatible with either thermal Compton\nbroadening or Doppler broadening in the inner parts of an accretion disk\ntruncated at $20\\pm6$ gravitational radii from the neutron star. Strikingly, at\nleast one narrow emission line ascribed to neutral or mildly ionized iron is\nneeded to model the prominent emission complex detected between 5.5 and 7.5\nkeV. (Abridged)\n", "  We provide a procedure to determine if a given nonlocal operator in a large N\nholographic CFT is dual to a local bulk operator on the geometry associated\nwith a particular code subspace of the CFT. This procedure does not presuppose\nknowledge of the bulk geometry. We are able to pick out local operators in a\nlarge region of the bulk, called the \"localizable region,\"' that can extend\nbeyond event horizons in certain cases. The method relies heavily on the\nquantum-error correcting structure of AdS/CFT and, in particular, on\nentanglement wedge reconstruction. As a byproduct of this machinery, we are\nable to reconstruct the metric in the localizable region up to a conformal\nfactor. This suggests a connection between our program and the recent\nlight-cone cut approach to bulk reconstruction.\n", "  This is the first of two articles on the study of a particle system model\nthat exhibits a Turing instability type effect. The model is based on two\ndiscrete lines (or toruses) with Ising spins, that evolve according to a\ncontinuous time Markov process defined in terms of macroscopic Kac potentials\nand local interactions. For fixed time, we prove that the density fields weakly\nconverge to the solution of a system of partial differential equations\ninvolving convolutions. The presence of local interactions results in the lack\nof propagation of chaos, reason why the hydrodynamic limit cannot be obtained\nfrom previous results.\n", "  We study the intra-cluster magnetic field in the poor galaxy cluster Abell\n194 by complementing radio data, at different frequencies, with data in the\noptical and X-ray bands. We analyze new total intensity and polarization\nobservations of Abell 194 obtained with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). We\nuse the SRT data in combination with archival Very Large Array observations to\nderive both the spectral aging and Rotation Measure (RM) images of the radio\ngalaxies 3C40A and 3C40B embedded in Abell 194. The optical analysis indicates\nthat Abell 194 does not show a major and recent cluster merger, but rather\nagrees with a scenario of accretion of small groups. Under the minimum energy\nassumption, the lifetimes of synchrotron electrons in 3C40B measured from the\nspectral break are found to be 157 Myrs. The break frequency image and the\nelectron density profile inferred from the X-ray emission are used in\ncombination with the RM data to constrain the intra-cluster magnetic field\npower spectrum. By assuming a Kolmogorov power law power spectrum, we find that\nthe RM data in Abell 194 are well described by a magnetic field with a maximum\nscale of fluctuations of Lambda_max=64 kpc and a central magnetic field\nstrength of <B0>=1.5 microG. Further out, the field decreases with the radius\nfollowing the gas density to the power of eta=1.1. Comparing Abell 194 with a\nsmall sample of galaxy clusters, there is a hint of a trend between central\nelectron densities and magnetic field strengths.\n", "  We derive and compare the fractions of cool-core clusters in the {\\em Planck}\nEarly Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sample of 164 clusters with $z \\leq 0.35$ and in a\nflux-limited X-ray sample of 100 clusters with $z \\leq 0.30$, using {\\em\nChandra} observations. We use four metrics to identify cool-core clusters: 1)\nthe concentration parameter: the ratio of the integrated emissivity profile\nwithin 0.15 $r_{500}$ to that within $r_{500}$, and 2) the ratio of the\nintegrated emissivity profile within 40 kpc to that within 400 kpc, 3) the\ncuspiness of the gas density profile: the negative of the logarithmic\nderivative of the gas density with respect to the radius, measured at 0.04\n$r_{500}$, and 4) the central gas density, measured at 0.01 $r_{500}$. We find\nthat the sample of X-ray selected clusters, as characterized by each of these\nmetrics, contains a significantly larger fraction of cool-core clusters\ncompared to the sample of SZ selected clusters (44$\\pm$7\\% vs. 28$\\pm$4\\% using\nthe concentration parameter in the 0.15--1.0 $r_{500}$ range, 61$\\pm$8\\% vs.\n36$\\pm$5\\% using the concentration parameter in the 40--400 kpc range,\n64$\\pm$8\\% vs. 38$\\pm$5\\% using the cuspiness, and 53$\\pm$7\\% vs. 39$\\pm$5\\%\nusing the central gas density). Qualitatively, cool-core clusters are more\nX-ray luminous at fixed mass. Hence, our X-ray flux-limited sample, compared to\nthe approximately mass-limited SZ sample, is over-represented with cool-core\nclusters. We describe a simple quantitative model that uses the excess\nluminosity of cool-core clusters compared to non-cool-core clusters at fixed\nmass to successfully predict the observed fraction of cool-core clusters in\nX-ray selected samples.\n", "  In the conventional framework for cosmological dynamics the scale factor\n$a(t)$ is assumed to obey the `background' Friedmann equation for a perfectly\nhomogeneous universe while particles move according to equations of motions\ndriven by the gravity of the density fluctuations. It has recently been\nsuggested that the emergence of structure modifies the evolution of $a(t)$ via\nNewtonian (or `kinematic') backreaction and that this may avoid the need for\ndark energy. Here we point out that the conventional system of equations is\nexact in Newtonian gravity and there is no approximation in the use of the\nhomogeneous universe equation for $a(t)$. The recently proposed modification of\nRacz et al.\\ (2017) does not reduce to Newtonian gravity in the limit of low\nvelocities. We discuss the relation of this to the `generalised Friedmann\nequation' of Buchert and Ehlers. These are quite different things; their\nformula describes individual regions and is obtained under the restrictive\nassumption that the matter behaves like a pressure-free fluid whereas our\nresult is exact for collisionless dynamics and is an auxiliary relation\nappearing in the structure equations. We use the symmetry of the general\nvelocity autocorrelation function to show how Buchert's $\\cal Q$ tends very\nrapidly to zero for large volume and that this does not simply arise `by\nconstruction' through the adoption of periodic boundary conditions as has been\nclaimed. We conclude that, to the extent that Newtonian gravity accurately\ndescribes the low-$z$ universe, there is no backreaction of structure on $a(t)$\nand that the need for dark energy cannot be avoided in this way.\n", "  Using 1-D non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium time-dependent\nradiative-transfer simulations, we study the ejecta properties required to\nmatch the early and late-time photometric and spectroscopic properties of\nsupernovae (SNe) associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). To\nmatch the short rise time, narrow light curve peak, and extremely broad\nspectral lines of SN1998bw requires a model with <3Msun ejecta but a high\nexplosion energy of a few 1e52erg and 0.5Msun of Ni56. However the relatively\nhigh luminosity, the presence of narrow spectral lines of intermediate mass\nelements, and the low ionization at the nebular stage are matched with a more\nstandard C-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) star explosion, with an ejecta of >10Msun, an\nexplosion energy >1e51erg, and only 0.1Msun of Ni56. As the two models are\nmutually exclusive, the breaking of spherical symmetry is essential to match\nthe early/late photometric/spectroscopic properties of SN1998bw. This\nconclusion confirms the notion that the ejecta of SN1998bw is aspherical on\nlarge scales. More generally, with asphericity, the energetics and Ni56 mass of\nLGRB/SNe are reduced and their ejecta mass is increased, favoring a massive\nfast-rotating Wolf-Rayet star progenitor. Contrary to persisting claims in\nfavor of the proto-magnetar model for LGRB/SNe, such progenitor/ejecta\nproperties are compatible with collapsar formation. Ejecta properties of\nLGRB/SNe inferred from 1D radiative-transfer modeling are fundamentally flawed.\n", "  We combine Gaia data release 1 astrometry with Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) images taken some ~10-15 years earlier, to measure proper motions of\nstars in the halo of our Galaxy. The SDSS-Gaia proper motions have typical\nstatistical errors of 2 mas/yr down to r ~ 20 mag, and are robust to variations\nwith magnitude and colour. Armed with this exquisite set of halo proper\nmotions, we identify RR Lyrae, blue horizontal branch (BHB), and K giant stars\nin the halo, and measure their net rotation with respect to the Galactic disc.\nWe find evidence for a gently rotating prograde signal (< $V_\\phi$ > ~ 5-25\nkm/s) in the halo stars, which shows little variation with Galactocentric\nradius out to 50 kpc. The average rotation signal for the three populations is\n< $V_\\phi$ > = 14 +/- 2 +/- 10 (syst.) km/s. There is also tentative evidence\nfor a kinematic correlation with metallicity, whereby the metal richer BHB and\nK giant stars have slightly stronger prograde rotation than the metal poorer\nstars. Using the Auriga simulation suite we find that the old (T >10 Gyr) stars\nin the simulated halos exhibit mild prograde rotation, with little dependence\non radius or metallicity, in general agreement with the observations. The weak\nhalo rotation suggests that the Milky Way has a minor in situ halo component,\nand has undergone a relatively quiet accretion history.\n", "  Do quantum correlations play a role in high temperature dynamics of many-body\nsystems? A common expectation is that thermal fluctuations lead to fast\ndecoherence and make dynamics classical. In this paper, we provide a striking\nexample of a single particle created in a featureless, infinite temperature\nspin bath which not only exhibits non-classical dynamics but also induces\nstrong long-lived correlations between the surrounding spins. We study the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a hole created in a fermionic or bosonic Mott\ninsulator in the atomic limit, which corresponds to a degenerate spin system.\nIn the absence of interactions, the spin correlations arise purely from quantum\ninterference, and the correlations are both antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic, in striking contrast to the equilibrium Nagaoka effect. These\nresults are relevant for several condensed matter spin systems, and should be\nobservable using state of the art bosonic or fermionic quantum gas microscopes.\n", "  We present a feasible protocol using traveling wave field to experimentally\nobserve negative response, i.e., to obtain a decrease in the output field\nintensity when the input field intensity is increased. Our protocol uses one\nbeam splitter and two mirrors to direct the traveling wave field into a lossy\ncavity in which there is a three-level atom in a lambda configuration. In our\nscheme, the input field impinges on a beam splitter and, while the transmitted\npart is used to drive the cavity mode, the reflected part is used as the\ncontrol field to obtain negative response of the output field. We show that the\ngreater cooperativity of the atom-cavity system, the more pronounced the\nnegative response. The system we are proposing can be used to protect devices\nsensitive to intense fields, since the intensity of the output field, which\nshould be directed to the device to be protected, is diminished when the\nintensity of the input field increases.\n", "  Mass loss is a key uncertainty in the evolution of massive stars. Stellar\nevolution calculations must employ parametric algorithms for mass loss, and\nusually only include stellar winds. We carry out a parameter study of the\neffects of wind mass loss on massive star evolution using the open-source\nstellar evolution code MESA. We provide a systematic comparison of wind mass\nloss algorithms for solar-metallicity, nonrotating, single stars in the initial\nmass range of $15-35\\,M_\\odot$. We consider combinations drawn from two hot\nphase algorithms, three cool phase algorithms, and two Wolf-Rayet algorithms.\nWe consider linear wind efficiency scale factors of $1$, $0.33$, and $0.1$ to\naccount for reductions in mass loss rates due to wind inhomogeneities. We find\nthat the initial to final mass mapping for each zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS)\nmass has a $\\sim 50\\%$ uncertainty if all algorithm combinations and wind\nefficiencies are considered. The ad-hoc efficiency scale factor dominates this\nuncertainty. While the final total mass and internal structure of our models\nvary tremendously with mass loss treatment, final observable parameters are\nmuch less sensitive for ZAMS mass $\\lesssim 30\\,M_\\odot$. This indicates that\nuncertainty in wind mass loss does not negatively affect estimates of the ZAMS\nmass of most single-star supernova progenitors from pre-explosion observations.\nFurthermore, we show that the internal structure of presupernova stars is\nsensitive to variations in both main sequence and post main-sequence mass loss.\nWe find that the compactness parameter $\\xi\\propto M/R(M)$ varies by as much as\n$30\\%$ for a given ZAMS mass evolved with different wind efficiencies and mass\nloss algorithm combinations. [abridged]\n", "  We investigate a stress-energy tensor for a CFT at strong coupling inside a\nsmall five-dimensional rotating Myers-Perry black hole with equal angular\nmomenta by using the holographic method. As a gravitational dual, we\nperturbatively construct a black droplet solution by applying the \"derivative\nexpansion\" method, generalizing the work of Haddad (arXiv:1207.2305), and\nanalytically compute the holographic stress-energy tensor for our solution. We\nfind that the stress-energy tensor is finite at both the future and past outer\n(event) horizons, and that the energy density is negative just outside the\nevent horizons due to the Hawking effect. Furthermore, we apply the holographic\nmethod to the question of quantum instability of the Cauchy horizon since, by\nconstruction, our black droplet solution also admits a Cauchy horizon inside.\nWe analytically show that the null-null component of the holographic\nstress-energy tensor negatively diverges at the Cauchy horizon, suggesting that\na singularity appears there, in favor of strong cosmic censorship.\n", "  Solid-state thermionic power generators are an alternative to thermoelectric\nmodules. In this manuscript, we develop an analytical model to investigate the\nperformance of these generators in the non-linear regime. We identify\ndimensionless parameters determining their performance and provide measures to\nestimate acceptable range of thermal and electrical resistances of thermionic\ngenerators. We find the relation between the optimum load resistance and the\ninternal resistance and suggest guide lines for the design of thermionic power\ngenerators. Finally, we show that in the nonlinear regime, thermionic power\ngenerators can have efficiency values higher than the state of the art\nthermoelectric modules.\n", "  The spin of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars at low metallicity (Z) is most relevant for\nour understanding of gravitational wave sources such as GW 150914, as well as\nthe incidence of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two scenarios have been\nsuggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and\nquasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical\nevolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might\nenable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample. We measure WR wind asymmetries with VLT-FORS linear\nspectropolarimetry. We report the detection of new line effects in the LMC WN\nstar BAT99-43 and the WC star BAT99-70, as well as the famous WR/LBV HD 5980 in\nthe SMC, which might be evolving chemically homogeneously. With the previous\nreported line effects in the late-type WNL (Ofpe/WN9) objects BAT99-22 and\nBAT99-33, this brings the total LMC WR sample to 4, i.e. a frequency of ~10%.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the incidence of line effects amongst low-Z WR stars is\nnot found to be any higher than amongst the Galactic WR sample, challenging the\nrotationally-induced CHE model. As WR mass loss is likely Z-dependent, our\nMagellanic Cloud line-effect WR stars may maintain their surface rotation and\nfulfill the basic conditions for producing long GRBs, both via the classical\npost-red supergiant (RSG) or luminous blue variable (LBV) channel, as well as\nresulting from CHE due to physics specific to very massive stars (VMS).\n", "  A search is presented for extra spatial dimensions, quantum black holes, and\nquark contact interactions in measurements of dijet angular distributions in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. The data were collected with the\nCMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.6\ninverse femtobarns. The distributions are found to be in agreement with\npredictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics that include electroweak\ncorrections. Limits for different contact interaction models are obtained in a\nbenchmark model, valid to next-to-leading order in QCD, in which only\nleft-handed quarks participate, quark contact interactions are excluded up to a\nscale of 11.5 or 14.7 TeV for destructive or constructive interference,\nrespectively. The production of quantum black holes is excluded for masses\nbelow 7.8 or 5.3 TeV, depending on the model. The lower limits for the scales\nof virtual graviton exchange in the Arkani-Hamed--Dimopoulos--Dvali model of\nextra spatial dimensions are in the range 7.9-11.2 TeV, and are the most\nstringent set of limits available.\n", "  \"EIT waves\" are freely-propagating global pulses in the low corona which are\nstrongly associated with the initial evolution of coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs). They are thought to be large-amplitude, fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic\nwaves initially driven by the rapid expansion of a CME in the low corona. An\n\"EIT wave\" was observed on 6 July 2012 to impact an adjacent trans-equatorial\nloop system which then exhibited a decaying oscillation as it returned to rest.\nObservations of the loop oscillations were used to estimate the magnetic field\nstrength of the loop system by studying the decaying oscillation of the loop,\nmeasuring the propagation of ubiquitous transverse waves in the loop and\nextrapolating the magnetic field from observed magnetograms. Observations from\nthe Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO/AIA) and the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) were used to study\nthe event. An Empirical Mode Decomposition analysis was used to characterise\nthe oscillation of the loop system in CoMP Doppler velocity and line width and\nin AIA intensity. The loop system was shown to oscillate in the 2nd harmonic\nmode rather than at the fundamental frequency, with the seismological analysis\nreturning an estimated magnetic field strength of ~5.5+/-1.5 G. This compares\nto the magnetic field strength estimates of ~1-9 G and ~3-9 G found using the\nmeasurements of transverse wave propagation and magnetic field extrapolation\nrespectively.\n", "  The M$_k$ models for 1D lattice fermions are characterised by ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetry and by an order-$k$ clustering property. This paper highlights\nconnections with quantum field theories (QFTs) in various regimes. At\ncriticality the QFTs are minimal models of ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric\nconformal field theory (CFT) - we analyse finite size spectra on open chains\nwith a variety of supersymmetry preserving boundary conditions. Specific\nstaggering perturbations lead to a gapped regime corresponding to massive\n${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric QFT with Chebyshev superpotentials. At `extreme\nstaggering' we uncover a simple physical picture with degenerate supersymmetric\nvacua and mobile kinks. We connect this kink-picture to the Chebyshev QFTs and\nuse it to derive novel CFT character formulas. For clarity the focus in this\npaper is on the simplest models, M$_1$, M$_2$ and M$_3$.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a topological Kitaev chain connected to a double\nquantum-dot (QD) setup hybridized with metallic leads. In this system we\nobserve the emergence of two striking phenomena: (i) a decrypted Majorana\nfermion (MF) qubit recorded over a single QD, which is detectable by means of\nconductance measurements due to the asymmetrical MF-qubit leaked state into the\nQDs; (ii) an encrypted qubit recorded in both QDs when the leakage is\nsymmetrical. In such a regime, we have a cryptographylike manifestation, since\nthe MF qubit becomes bound states in the continuum, which is not detectable in\nconductance experiments.\n", "  Observations at 37 GHz, performed at Mets\\\"ahovi Radio Observatory, are\npresented for a sample of 78 radio-loud and radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1\n(NLS1) galaxies, together with additional lower and higher frequency radio data\nfrom RATAN-600, Owens Valley Radio Observatory, and the Planck satellite. Most\nof the data have been gathered between February 2012 and April 2015 but for\nsome sources even longer lightcurves exist. The detection rate at 37 GHz is\naround 19%, comparable to other populations of active galactic nuclei presumed\nto be faint at radio frequencies, such as BL Lac objects. Variability and\nspectral indices are determined for sources with enough detections. Based on\nthe radio data, many NLS1 galaxies show a blazar-like radio spectra exhibiting\nsignificant variability. The spectra at a given time are often inverted or\nconvex. The source of the high-frequency radio emission in NLS1 galaxies,\ndetected at 37 GHz, is most probably a relativistic jet rather than star\nformation. Jets in NLS1 galaxies are therefore expected to be a much more\ncommon phenomenon than earlier assumed.\n", "  We report the discovery of a super-Earth mass planet in the microlensing\nevent MOA-2012-BLG-505. This event has the second shortest event timescale of\n$t_{\\rm E}=10 \\pm 1$ days where the observed data show evidence of planetary\ncompanion. Our 15 minute high cadence survey observation schedule revealed the\nshort subtle planetary signature. The system shows the well known close/wide\ndegeneracy. The planet/host-star mass ratio is $q =2.1 \\times 10^{-4}$ and the\nprojected separation normalized by the Einstein radius is s = 1.1 or 0.9 for\nthe wide and close solutions, respectively. We estimate the physical parameters\nof the system by using a Bayesian analysis and find that the lens consists of a\nsuper-Earth with a mass of $6.7^{+10.7}_{-3.6}M_{\\oplus}$ orbiting around a\nbrown-dwarf or late M-dwarf host with a mass of $0.10^{+0.16}_{-0.05}M_{\\odot}$\nwith a projected star-planet separation of $0.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$AU. The system is\nat a distance of $7.2 \\pm 1.1$ kpc, i.e., it is likely to be in the Galactic\nbulge. The small angular Einstein radius ($\\theta_{\\rm E}=0.12 \\pm 0.02$ mas)\nand short event timescale are typical for a low-mass lens in the Galactic\nbulge. Such low-mass planetary systems in the Bulge are rare because the\ndetection efficiency of planets in short microlensing events is relatively low.\nThis discovery may suggest that such low mass planetary systems are abundant in\nthe Bulge and currently on-going high cadence survey programs will detect more\nsuch events and may reveal an abundance of such planetary systems.\n", "  We calculate the double-spin asymmetries $A_{\\mathrm{LL}}$ for the processes\n$\\ell N\\to h X$ and $\\ell N\\to {\\mathrm{jet}}\\, X$ at next-to-leading order\naccuracy in perturbative QCD. We compare our theoretical results for\n$A_{\\mathrm{LL}}$ to data from the SLAC E155 experiment, finding only partially\nsatisfactory agreement. We conclude that measurements of $A_{\\mathrm{LL}}$ and\nthe relevant polarized and unpolarized cross sections should be performed at\nthe present-day fixed-target lepton scattering experiments, as well as at a\nfuture electron ion collider, in order to verify our understanding of this\nprocess. We present predictions of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetries for\nthese experiments.\n", "  We show that generic pure states (states drawn according to the Haar measure)\nof four particles of equal internal dimension are uniquely determined among all\nother pure states by their two-body marginals. In fact, certain subsets of\nthree of the two-body marginals suffice for the characterization. We also\ndiscuss generalizations of the statement to pure states of more particles,\nshowing that these are almost always determined among pure states by three of\ntheir $(n-2)$-body marginals. Finally, we present special families of symmetric\npure four-particle states that share the same two-body marginals and are\ntherefore undetermined. These are four-qubit Dicke states in superposition with\ngeneralized GHZ states.\n", "  The localization of the repeating FRB 121102 to a low-metallicity dwarf\ngalaxy at $z=0.193$, and its association with a quiescent radio source,\nsuggests the possibility that FRBs originate from magnetars, formed by the\nunusual supernovae in such galaxies. We investigate this via a comparison of\nmagnetar birth rates, the FRB volumetric rate, and host galaxy demographics. We\ncalculate average volumetric rates of possible millisecond magnetar production\nchannels such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), long and short gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), and general magnetar production via core-collapse supernovae.\nFor each channel we also explore the expected host galaxy demographics using\ntheir known properties. We determine for the first time the number density of\nFRB emitters (the product of their volumetric birthrate and lifetime), $R_{\\rm\nFRB}\\tau\\approx 10^4$Gpc$^{-3}$, assuming that FRBs are predominantly emitted\nfrom repetitive sources similar to FRB 121102 and adopting a beaming factor of\n0.1. By comparing rates we find that production via rare channels (SLSNe, GRBs)\nimplies a typical FRB lifetime of $\\approx$30-300 yr, in good agreement with\nother lines of argument. The total energy emitted over this time is consistent\nwith the available energy stored in the magnetic field. On the other hand, any\nrelation to magnetars produced via normal core-collapse supernovae leads to a\nvery short lifetime of $\\approx$0.5yr, in conflict with both theory and\nobservation. We demonstrate that due to the diverse host galaxy distributions\nof the different progenitor channels, many possible sources of FRB birth can be\nruled out with $\\lesssim 10$ host galaxy identifications. Conversely, targeted\nsearches of galaxies that have previously hosted decades-old SLSNe and GRBs may\nbe a fruitful strategy for discovering new FRBs and related quiescent radio\nsources, and determining the nature of their progenitors.\n", "  The covariant chiral kinetic equation (CCKE) is derived from the\n4-dimensional Wigner function by an improved perturbative method under the\nstatic equilibrium conditions. The chiral kinetic equation in 3-dimensions can\nbe obtained by intergation over the time component of the 4-momentum. There is\nfreedom to add more terms to the CCKE allowed by conservation laws. In the\nderivation of the 3-dimensional equation, there is also freedom to choose\ncoefficients of some terms in $dx_{0}/d\\tau$ and $d\\mathbf{x}/d\\tau$ ($\\tau$ is\na parameter along the worldline, and $(x_{0},\\mathbf{x})$ denotes the\ntime-space position of a particle) whose 3-mometum integrals are vanishing. So\nthe 3-dimensional chiral kinetic equation derived from the CCKE is not uniquely\ndetermined in the current approach. To go beyond the current approach, one\nneeds a new way of building up the 3-dimensional chiral kinetic equation from\nthe CCKE or directly from covariant Wigner equations.\n", "  We have extended the semianalytic technique of Iyer and Will for computing\nthe complex quasinormal frequencies of black holes, $\\omega,$ by constructing\nthe Pad\\'e approximants of the (formal) series for $\\omega^{2}$. It is shown\nthat for the (so far best documented) quasinormal frequencies of the\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes the Pad\\'e transforms\n$P_{6}^{6}$ and $P_{7}^{6}$ are, within the domain of applicability, always in\nexcellent agreement with the numerical results. We argue that the method may\nserve as the black box with the \"potential\" $Q(x)$ as an input and the accurate\nquasinormal modes as the output. The generalizations and modifications of the\nmethod are briefly discussed as well as the preliminary results for other\nclasses of the black holes.\n", "  We report a single-crystal neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron\nscattering study on the spin 1/2 cuprate Cu$_3$Bi(SeO$_3$)$_2$O$_2$Cl,\ncomplemented by dielectric and electric polarization measurements. The study\nclarifies a number of open issues concerning this complex material, whose\nfrustrated interactions on a kagome-like lattice, combined with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, are expected to stabilize an exotic canted\nantiferromagnetic order. In particular, we determine the nature of the\nstructural transition occurring at 115 K, the magnetic structure below 25 K\nresolved in the updated space group, and the microscopic ingredients at the\norigin of this magnetic arrangement. This was achieved by an analysis of the\nmeasured gapped spin waves, which signifies the need of an unexpected and\nsignificant anisotropic exchange beyond the proposed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions. Finally, we discuss the mutliferroic properties of this material\nwith respect to the space group symmetries.\n", "  We directly image individual vortex positions in nanocrystals in order to\nunveil the structural property that contributes to the depletion of the\nentropy-jump entailed at the first-order transition. On reducing the\nnanocrystal size the density of topological defects increases near the edges\nover a characteristic length. Within this \"healing-length\" distance from the\nsample edge vortex rows tend to bend while towards the center of the sample the\npositional order of the vortex structure is what is expected for the\nBragg-glass phase. This suggests that the healing-length may be a key quantity\nto model the entropy-jump depletion in the first-order transition of\nextremely-layered vortex nanocrystals.\n", "  We present the results of our continued systematic search for near-infrared\n(NIR) candidate counterparts to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) within 10\nMpc. We observed 42 ULXs in 24 nearby galaxies and detected NIR candidate\ncounterparts to 15 ULXs. Fourteen of these ULXs appear to have a single\ncandidate counterpart in our images and the remaining ULX has 2 candidate\ncounterparts. Seven ULXs have candidate counterparts with absolute magnitudes\nin the range between -9.26 and -11.18 mag, consistent with them being red\nsupergiants (RSGs). The other eight ULXs have candidate counterparts with\nabsolute magnitudes too bright to be a single stellar source. Some of these NIR\nsources show extended morphology or colours expected for Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN), strongly suggesting that they are likely stellar clusters or background\ngalaxies. The red supergiant candidate counterparts form a valuable sample for\nfollow-up spectroscopic observations to confirm their nature, with the ultimate\ngoal of directly measuring the mass of the compact accretor that powers the ULX\nusing binary Doppler shifts.\n", "  We obtain the exact (confluent Heun) solutions to the massive scalar field in\na Gravity's Rainbow Schwarzschild metric. With these solutions at hand, we\nstudy the Hawking radiation resulting from the tunneling rate through the event\nhorizon. We show that the emission spectrum obeys non-extensive statistics and\nis halted when a certain mass remnant is reached. Next, we infer constraints on\nthe rainbow parameters from recent LHC particle physics experiments and Hubble\nSTIS astrophysics measurements. Finally, we study the low frequency limit in\norder to find the modified energy spectrum around the source.\n", "  We present a computational study of 2$p$ core-level X-ray photoemission\nspectra of transition metal monoxides MO (M=Ni, Co, Mn) and sesquioxides\nM$_2$O$_3$ (M=V, Cr, Fe) using a theoretical framework based on the\nlocal-density approximation (LDA) $+$ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We\nfind a very good description of the fine spectral features, which improves\nconsiderably over the conventional cluster model. We analyze the role of the\nnon-local screening and its relationship to the long-range magnetic order and\nthe lattice geometry. Our results reveal the potential of the present method\nfor the analysis and interpretation of the modern high-energy-resolution\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper, the second in a series investigating FR II radio galaxies at\nlow frequencies, we use LOFAR and VLA observations between 117 and 456 MHz in\naddition to archival data to determine the dynamics and energetics of two radio\ngalaxies, 3C452 and 3C223, through fitting of spectral ageing models on small\nspatial scales. We provide improved measurements for the physical extent of the\ntwo sources, including a previously unknown low surface brightness extension to\nthe northern lobe of 3C223, and revised energetics based on these values. We\nfind spectral ages of $77.05^{+9.22}_{-8.74}$ and $84.96^{+15.02}_{-13.83}$ Myr\nfor 3C452 and 3C223 respectively suggesting a characteristic advance speed for\nthe lobes of around one per cent the speed of light. For 3C452 we show that,\neven for a magnetic field strength not assumed to be in equipartition, a\ndisparity of factor of approximately 2 exists between the spectral age and that\ndetermined from a dynamical standpoint. We confirm that the injection index of\nboth sources (as derived from the lobe emission) remains steeper than\nclassically assumed values even when considered on well resolved scales at low\nfrequencies, but find an unexpected sharp discontinuity between the spectrum of\nthe hotspots and the surrounding lobe emission. We suggest that this\ndiscrepancy is due to the absorption of hotspot emission and/or non-homogeneous\nand additional acceleration mechanisms and, as such, hotspots should not be\nused in the determination of the underlying initial electron energy\ndistribution.\n", "  Cosmological surveys in the far infrared are known to suffer from confusion.\nThe Bayesian de-blending tool, XID+, currently provides one of the best ways to\nde-confuse deep Herschel SPIRE images, using a flat flux density prior. This\nwork is to demonstrate that existing multi-wavelength data sets can be\nexploited to improve XID+ by providing an informed prior, resulting in more\naccurate and precise extracted flux densities. Photometric data for galaxies in\nthe COSMOS field were used to constrain spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nusing the fitting tool CIGALE. These SEDs were used to create Gaussian prior\nestimates in the SPIRE bands for XID+. The multi-wavelength photometry and the\nextracted SPIRE flux densities were run through CIGALE again to allow us to\ncompare the performance of the two priors. Inferred ALMA flux densities\n(F$^i$), at 870$\\mu$m and 1250$\\mu$m, from the best fitting SEDs from the\nsecond CIGALE run were compared with measured ALMA flux densities (F$^m$) as an\nindependent performance validation. Similar validations were conducted with the\nSED modelling and fitting tool MAGPHYS and modified black body functions to\ntest for model dependency. We demonstrate a clear improvement in agreement\nbetween the flux densities extracted with XID+ and existing data at other\nwavelengths when using the new informed Gaussian prior over the original\nuninformed prior. The residuals between F$^m$ and F$^i$ were calculated. For\nthe Gaussian prior, these residuals, expressed as a multiple of the ALMA error\n($\\sigma$), have a smaller standard deviation, 7.95$\\sigma$ for the Gaussian\nprior compared to 12.21$\\sigma$ for the flat prior, reduced mean, 1.83$\\sigma$\ncompared to 3.44$\\sigma$, and have reduced skew to positive values, 7.97\ncompared to 11.50. These results were determined to not be significantly model\ndependent. This results in statistically more reliable SPIRE flux densities.\n", "  In order to clarify the nature of hypernuclear low-lying states, we carry out\na comprehensive study for the structure of\n$^{144-154}_{~~~~~~~~\\Lambda}$Sm-hypernuclei, which exhibit a transition from\nvibrational to rotational characters as the neutron number increases. To this\nend, we employ a microscopic particle-core coupling scheme based on a covariant\ndensity functional theory. We find that the positive-parity ground-state band\nin the hypernuclei shares a similar structure to that of the corresponding core\nnucleus. That is, regardless of whether the core nucleus is spherical or\ndeformed, each hypernuclear state is dominated by the single configuration of\nthe $\\Lambda$ particle in the $s_{1/2}$ state ($\\Lambda s_{1/2}$) coupled to\none core state of the ground band. In contrast, the low-lying negative-parity\nstates mainly consist of $\\Lambda p_{1/2}$ and $\\Lambda p_{3/2}$ configurations\ncoupled to plural nuclear core states. We show that, while the mixing amplitude\nbetween these configurations is negligibly small in spherical and\nweakly-deformed nuclei, it strongly increases as the core nucleus undergoes a\ntransition to a well-deformed shape, being consistent with the Nilsson wave\nfunctions. We demonstrate that the structure of these negative-parity states\nwith spin $I$ can be well understood based on the $LS$ coupling scheme, with\nthe total orbital angular momentum of $L=[I\\otimes 1]$ and the spin angular\nmomentum of $S=1/2$.\n", "  In the last decades, the early pre main sequence stellar rotational evolution\npicture has been constrained by studies targeting different young regions at a\nvariety of ages. Observational studies suggest a mass-rotation dependence, and\nfor some mass ranges a connection between rotation and the presence of a\ncircumstellar disk. Not still fully explored, though, is the role of\nenvironmental conditions on the rotational regulation.\n  We investigate the rotational properties of candidate members of the young\nmassive association Cygnus OB2. The Stetson variability index, Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram, Saunders statistics, string/rope length method, and visual\nverification of folded light curves were applied to select 1224 periodic\nvariable stars. Completeness and contamination of the periodic sample was\nderived from Monte Carlo simulations, out of which 894 periods were considered\nreliable. Our study was considered reasonably complete for periods from 2 to 30\ndays.\n  The general rotational scenario seen in other young regions is confirmed by\nCygnus OB2 period distributions, with disked stars rotating on average slower\nthan non-disked stars. A mass-rotation dependence was also verified, but as in\nNGC 6530, lower mass stars are rotating on average slower than higher mass\nstars, with an excess of slow rotators among the lower mass population. The\neffect of the environment on the rotational properties of the association was\ninvestigated by re-analysing the results while taking into account the incident\nUV radiation arising from O stars in the association. Results compatible with\nthe disk-locking scenario were verified for stars with low UV incidence, but no\nstatistical significant relation between rotation and disk presence was\nverified for stars with high UV incidence suggesting that massive stars can\nhave an important role on regulating the rotation of nearby low mass stars.\n", "  Measurements of line-of-sight dependent clustering via the galaxy power\nspectrum's multipole moments constitute a powerful tool for testing theoretical\nmodels in large-scale structure. Recent work shows that this measurement,\nincluding a moving line-of-sight, can be accelerated using Fast Fourier\nTransforms (FFTs) by decomposing the Legendre polynomials into products of\nCartesian vectors. Here, we present a faster, optimal means of using FFTs for\nthis measurement. We avoid redundancy present in the Cartesian decomposition by\nusing a spherical harmonic decomposition of the Legendre polynomials.\nConsequently, our method is substantially faster: a given multipole of order\n$\\ell$ requires only $2\\ell+1$ FFTs rather than the $(\\ell+1)(\\ell+2)/2$ FFTs\nof the Cartesian approach. For the hexadecapole ($\\ell = 4$), this translates\nto $40\\%$ fewer FFTs, with increased savings for higher $\\ell$. The reduction\nin wall-clock time enables the calculation of finely-binned wedges in\n$P(k,\\mu)$, obtained by computing multipoles up to a large $\\ell_{\\rm max}$ and\ncombining them. This transformation has a number of advantages. We demonstrate\nthat by using non-uniform bins in $\\mu$, we can isolate plane-of-sky (angular)\nsystematics to a narrow bin at $\\mu \\simeq 0$ while eliminating the\ncontamination from all other bins. We also show that the covariance matrix of\nclustering wedges binned uniformly in $\\mu$ becomes ill-conditioned when\ncombining multipoles up to large values of $\\ell_{\\rm max}$, but that the\nproblem can be avoided with non-uniform binning. As an example, we present\nresults using $\\ell_{\\rm max}=16$, for which our procedure requires a factor of\n3.4 fewer FFTs than the Cartesian method, while removing the first $\\mu$ bin\nleads only to a 7% increase in statistical error on $f \\sigma_8$, as compared\nto a 54% increase with $\\ell_{\\rm max}=4$.\n", "  We present a new tool for colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) studies,\n$Powerful~CMD$. This tool is built on the basis of the advanced stellar\npopulation synthesis (ASPS) model, in which single stars, binary stars,\nrotating stars, and star formation history have been taken into account. Via\n$Powerful~CMD$, the distance modulus, colour excess, metallicity, age, binary\nfraction, rotating star fraction, and star formation history of star clusters\ncan be determined simultaneously from observed CMDs. The new tool is tested via\nboth simulated and real star clusters. Five parameters of clusters NGC6362,\nNGC6652, NGC6838 and M67 are determined and compared to other works. It is\nshown that this tool is useful for CMD studies, in particular for those with\nthe data of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Moreover, we find that the\ninclusion of binaries in theoretical stellar population models may lead to\nsmaller colour excess compared to the case of single star population models.\n", "  Inter-Landau-level transitions break particle hole symmetry and will choose\neither the Pfaffian or the anti-Pfaffian state as the absolute ground state at\n5/2 filling of the fractional quantum Hall effect. An approach based on\ntruncating the Hilbert space has favored the anti-Pfaffian. A second approach\nbased on an effective Hamiltonian produced the Pfaffian. In this letter\nperturbation theory is applied to finite sizes without bias to any specific\npseudo-potential component. This method also singles out the anti-Pfaffian. A\ncritical piece of the effective Hamiltonian, which was absent in previous\nstudies, reverts the ground state at 5/2 to the anti-Pfaffian.\n", "  To clarify certain nonlinear properties of strong gravitational field, we\ninvestigate cylindrically symmetric gravitational waves that are localized as\nregular wave packets in the space of radial and time coordinates. The waves are\nconstructed by applying a certain kind of harmonic mapping method to the seed\nsolutions with linear polarization, which are generalizations of the solution\nrepresenting a cylindrical gravitational pulse wave discussed by Weber-Wheeler\nand Bonnor. The solutions obtained here, though their form is rather simple,\nshow occurrence of strong mutual conversion between a linear mode and a cross\nmode apparently. The single localized wave shows the conversion in the vicinity\nof the symmetric axis where the self-interaction is strengthened, and the\ncollision between multiple waves also causes the conversion. These phenomena\ncan be thought to be the emergence of genuine nonlinearity that the Einstein\ngravity holds. Finally we discuss a simple, but interesting application of the\nsolutions to the case of the Einstein-Maxwell system.\n", "  The H2O Southern Galactic Plane Survey (HOPS) has mapped 100 square degrees\nof the Galactic plane for water masers and thermal molecular line emission\nusing the 22-m Mopra telescope. We describe the automated spectral-line fitting\npipelines used to determine the properties of emission detected in HOPS\ndatacubes, and use these to derive the physical and kinematic properties of gas\nin the survey. A combination of the angular resolution, sensitivity, velocity\nresolution and high critical density of lines targeted make the HOPS data cubes\nideally suited to finding precursor clouds to the most massive and dense\nstellar clusters in the Galaxy. We compile a list of the most massive HOPS\nammonia regions and investigate whether any may be young massive cluster\nprogenitor gas clouds. HOPS is also ideally suited to trace the flows of dense\ngas in the Galactic Centre. We find the kinematic structure of gas within the\ninner 500pc of the Galaxy is consistent with recent predictions for the\ndynamical evolution of gas flows in the centre of the Milky Way. We confirm a\nrecent finding that the dense gas in the inner 100pc has an oscillatory\nkinematic structure with characteristic length scale of ~20pc, and also\nidentify similar oscillatory kinematic structure in the gas at radii larger\nthan 100pc. Finally, we make all of the above fits and the remaining HOPS data\ncubes across the 100 square degrees of the survey available to the community.\n", "  It is possible that the formation of the Oort Cloud dates back to the\nearliest epochs of solar system history. At that time, the Sun was almost\ncertainly a member of the stellar cluster, where it was born. Since the solar\nbirth cluster is likely to have been massive (1000--10 000 Msol), and therefore\nlong-lived, an issue concerns the survival of such a primordial Oort Cloud. We\nhave investigated this issue by simulating the orbital evolution of Oort Cloud\ncomets for several hundred Myr, assuming the Sun to start its life as a typical\nmember of such a massive cluster. We have devised a synthetic representation of\nthe relevant dynamics, where the cluster potential is represented by a King\nmodel, and about 20 close encounters with individual cluster stars are selected\nand integrated based on the solar orbit and the cluster structure. Thousands of\nindividual simulations are made, each including 3 000 comets with orbits with\nthree different initial semi-major axes. Practically the entire initial Oort\nCloud is found to be lost for our choice of semi-major axes (5 000--20 000 au),\nindependent of the cluster mass, although the chance of survival is better for\nthe smaller cluster, since in a certain fraction of the simulations the Sun\norbits at relatively safe distances from the dense cluster centre. For the\nrange of birth cluster sizes that we investigate, a primordial Oort Cloud will\nlikely survive only as a small inner core with semi-major axes < 3 000 au. Such\na population of comets would be inert to orbital diffusion into an outer halo\nand subsequent injection into observable orbits. Some mechanism is therefore\nneeded to accomplish this transfer, in case the Oort Cloud is primordial and\nthe birth cluster did not have a low mass. From this point of view, our results\nlend some support to a delayed formation of the Oort Cloud, that occurred after\nthe Sun had left its birth cluster.\n", "  We propose a model with two Higgs doublet where quark and charged-lepton\nmasses in the first and second families are induced at one-loop level, and\nneutrino masses are induced at the two-loop level. In our model we introduce an\nextra $U(1)_R$ gauge symmetry that plays a crucial role in achieving desired\nterms in no conflict with anomaly cancellation. We show the mechanism to\ngenerate fermion masses, the resultant mass matrices and Yukawa interactions in\nmass eigenstates, and discuss several interesting phenomenologies such as muon\nanomalous magnetic dipole moment and dark matter candidate that are arisen from\nthis model.\n", "  The deformation operator of the D1D5 orbifold CFT, a twist 2 operator, drives\nthe CFT towards the black hole dual and its physics is key to understanding\nthermalization in the D1D5 system. To further study this deformation, we extend\nprevious work on the effect of twist 2 operators to a method that works for\nhigher orders, in the continuum limit. Our component twist method works by\nbuilding higher twist operators out of twist 2 operators together with\nknowledge of Bogoliubov transformations. Consequently, this method sidesteps\nlimitations in Lunin-Mathur technology by avoiding lifts to the covering space.\nWe verify the method by reproducing results obtainable with Lunin-Mathur\ntechnology. Going further, our method upholds a previously conjectured scaling\nlaw in the continuum limit that applies to any generic configuration of twists.\nWe illustrate this with computations for a new configuration of two twist 2\noperators that twists three copies together.\n", "  $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted enormous attention since it has been proposed\nas a prime candidate to study fractionalized magnetic excitations akin to\nKitaev's honeycomb-lattice spin liquid. We have performed a detailed\nspecific-heat investigation at temperatures down to $0.4$ K in applied magnetic\nfields up to $9$ T for fields parallel to the $ab$ plane. We find a suppression\nof the zero-field antiferromagnetic order, together with an increase of the\nlow-temperature specific heat, with increasing field up to $\\mu_0H_c\\approx\n6.9$ T. Above $H_c$, the magnetic contribution to the low-temperature specific\nheat is strongly suppressed, implying the opening of a spin-excitation gap. Our\ndata point toward a field-induced quantum critical point (QCP) at $H_c$; this\nis supported by universal scaling behavior near $H_c$. Remarkably, the data\nalso reveal the existence of a small characteristic energy scale well below\n$1$~meV above which the excitation spectrum changes qualitatively. We relate\nthe data to theoretical calculations based on a $J_1$--$K_1$--$\\Gamma_1$--$J_3$\nhoneycomb model.\n", "  Following our work presented in Dai et al. (2016), we report our detailed\ndata analysis for another 38 Fermi gamma-ray un-associated sources. These\nsources are selected from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) third source\ncatalog on the basis of the properties of known gamma-ray millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) and for the purpose of finding likely candidate MSPs. From our analysis\nof the LAT data, we identify that among the 38 sources, 28 of them are single\npoint-like sources with clean background and their spectra show significant\ncurvature. We also conduct analysis of archival X-ray data available for 24 of\nthe 28 sources. In the fields of 10 sources, there are at least one X-ray\nobject, and in those of the other 14 sources, no X-ray object is detected but\nprobably due to the X-ray observations being short. We discuss the possible MSP\nnature for these sources. Six of them(J0514.6-4406, J1035.7-6720, J1624.2-4041,\nJ1744.1-7619, J1946.4-5403, and J2039.6-5618) are most likely associated with\npulsars because of multi-wavelength identifications including direct radio or\ngamma-ray detection of pulsations. To firmly establish the associations or\nverify the MSP nature for other sources, deep X-ray and/or optical observations\nare needed.\n", "  New populations of hyper-luminous, dust-obscured quasars have been recently\ndiscovered around the peak epoch of galaxy formation ($z \\sim 2-3$), in\naddition to similar sources found at lower redshifts. Such dusty quasars are\noften interpreted as sources `in transition', from dust-enshrouded starbursts\nto unobscured luminous quasars, along the evolutionary sequence. Here we\nconsider the role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiative feedback,\ndriven by radiation pressure on dust, in high-luminosity, dust-obscured\nsources. We analyse how the radiation pressure-driven dusty shell models, with\ndifferent shell mass configurations, may be applied to the different\npopulations of dusty quasars reported in recent observations. We find that\nexpanding shells, sweeping up matter from the surrounding environment, may\naccount for prolonged obscuration in dusty quasars, e.g. for a central\nluminosity of $L \\sim 10^{47}$erg/s, a typical obscured phase (with extinction\nin the range $A_{V} \\sim 1-10$ mags) may last a few $\\sim 10^6$yr. On the other\nhand, fixed-mass shells, coupled with high dust-to-gas ratios, may explain the\nextreme outflows recently discovered in red quasars at high redshifts. We\ndiscuss how the interaction between AGN radiative feedback and the ambient\nmedium at different temporal stages in the evolutionary sequence may contribute\nto shape the observational appearance of dusty quasar populations.\n", "  Spin currents can be generated on an ultrafast timescale by excitation of a\nferromagnetic (FM) thin film with a femtosecond laser-pulse. Recently, it has\nbeen demonstrated that these ultrafast spin currents can transport angular\nmomentum to neighbouring FM layers, being able to change both the magnitude and\norientation of the magnetization in the adjacent layer. In this work, both the\ngeneration and absorption of these optically excited spin currents are\ninvestigated. This is done using non-collinear magnetic bilayers, i.e. two FM\nlayers separated by a conductive spacer. Spin currents are generated in a Co/Ni\nmultilayer with out-of-plane (OOP) anisotropy, and absorbed by a Co layer with\nan in-plane (IP) anisotropy. This behaviour is confirmed by careful analysis of\nthe laser-pulse induced magnetization dynamics, whereafter it is demonstrated\nthat the transverse spin current is absorbed very locally near the injection\ninterface of the IP layer (90% within the first approx. 2 nm). Moreover, it\nwill also be shown that this local absorption results in the excitation of THz\nstanding spin waves within the IP layer. The dispersion measured for these high\nfrequency spin waves shows a discrepancy with respect to the theoretical\npredictions, for which a first explanation involving intermixed interface\nregions is proposed. Lastly, the spin current generation is investigated using\ndifferent number of repeats for the Co/Ni multilayer, which proves to be of\ngreat relevance for identifying the optical spin current generation mechanism.\n", "  IGR~J18245--2452/PSR J1824--2452I is one of the rare transitional accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars, showing direct evidence of switches between states\nof rotation powered radio pulsations and accretion powered X-ray pulsations,\ndubbed transitional pulsars. IGR~J18245--2452 is the only transitional pulsar\nso far to have shown a full accretion episode, reaching an X-ray luminosity of\n$\\sim10^{37}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ permitting its discovery with INTEGRAL in 2013. In\nthis paper, we report on a detailed analysis of the data collected with the\nIBIS/ISGRI and the two JEM-X monitors on-board INTEGRAL at the time of the 2013\noutburst. We make use of some complementary data obtained with the instruments\non-board XMM-Newton and Swift in order to perform the averaged broad-band\nspectral analysis of the source in the energy range 0.4 -- 250~keV. We have\nfound that this spectrum is the hardest among the accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsars. We improved the ephemeris, now valid across its full outburst, and\nreport the detection of pulsed emission up to $\\sim60$ keV in both the ISGRI\n($10.9 \\sigma$) and Fermi/GBM ($5.9 \\sigma$) bandpass. The alignment of the\nISGRI and Fermi GBM 20 -- 60 keV pulse profiles are consistent at a $\\sim25\\\n\\mu$s level. We compared the pulse profiles obtained at soft X-rays with \\xmm\\\nwith the soft \\gr-ray ones, and derived the pulsed fractions of the fundamental\nand first harmonic, as well as the time lag of the fundamental harmonic, up to\n$150\\ \\mu$s, as a function of energy. We report on a thermonuclear X-ray burst\ndetected with \\Integ, and using the properties of the previously type-I X-ray\nburst, we show that all these events are powered primarily by helium ignited at\na depth of $y_{\\rm ign} \\approx 2.7\\times10^8$ g cm${}^{-2}$. For such a helium\nburst the estimated recurrence time of $\\Delta t_{\\rm rec}\\approx5.6$ d is in\nagreement with the observations.\n", "  Spin pumping refers to the microwave-driven spin current injection from a\nferromagnet into the adjacent target material. We theoretically investigate the\nspin pumping into superconductors by fully taking account of impurity\nspin-orbit scattering that is indispensable to describe diffusive spin\ntransport with finite spin diffusion length. We calculate temperature\ndependence of the spin pumping signal and show that a pronounced coherence peak\nappears immediately below the superconducting transition temperature Tc, which\nsurvives even in the presence of the spin-orbit scattering. The phenomenon\nprovides us with a new way of studying the dynamic spin susceptibility in a\nsuperconducting thin film. This is contrasted with the nuclear magnetic\nresonance technique used to study a bulk superconductor.\n", "  We propose a new realization of strongly interacting massive particles (SIMP)\nas self-interacting dark matter, where SIMPs couple to the Standard Model\nsector through an axion-like particle. Our model gets over major obstacles\naccompanying the original SIMP model, such as a missing mechanism of\nkinetically equilibrating SIMPs with the SM plasma as well as marginal\nperturbativity of the chiral Lagrangian density. Remarkably, the parameter\nregion realizing $\\sigma_{\\rm self}/m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq 0.1 \\textrm{--} 1 \\, {\\rm\ncm}^{2}/{\\rm g}$ is within the reach of future beam dump experiments such as\nthe Search for Hidden Particles (SHiP) experiment.\n", "  We obtain a family of exact solutions describing magnetized black holes in an\nexternal gravitational field. Locally the solutions can be interpreted as\nrepresenting the near-horizon region of a black hole, which interacts with a\nsurrounding matter distribution producing a strong magnetic field. Thus, the\nsolutions reflect the influence of both a gravitational and an electromagnetic\nexternal potential in the strong field regime. The static members in the family\nare generalizations of the Schwarzschild solution in the described environment,\nwhile the rotating ones generalize the magnetized Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution\nwhen the influence of an external gravitational source is also taken into\naccount. Technically, the solutions are obtained by means of a Harrison\ntransformation. We examine the thermodynamical properties of the solutions, and\ncompare them with the corresponding isolated black holes, and with the\nparticular cases when the interaction with only one of the external potentials\nis taken into account. For the static black holes the influence of the external\ngravitational and magnetic fields is factorized in a sense, both affecting\ndifferent properties, and leaving the rest intact. For the rotating solutions\nthe external gravitational and magnetic fields are coupled through the\nconditions for avoiding conical singularities. The Meissner effect is observed\nfor extremal rotating solutions only in the zero-charge limit, similar to the\nmagnetized Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole.\n", "  We present a detailed study of open heavy flavor production in high-energy\n$pp$ collisions at the LHC in the color dipole framework. The transverse\nmomentum distributions of produced $b$-jets, accounting for the jet energy\nloss, as well as produced open charm $D$ and bottom $B$ mesons in distinct\nrapidity intervals relevant for LHC measurements are computed. The dipole model\nresults for the differential $b$-jet production cross section are compared to\nthe recent ATLAS and CMS data while the results for $D$ and $B$ mesons\nproduction cross sections -- to the corresponding LHCb data. Several models for\nthe phenomenological dipole cross section have been employed to estimate\ntheoretical uncertainties of the dipole model predictions. We demonstrate that\nthe primordial transverse momentum distribution of the projectile gluon\nsignificantly affects the meson spectra at low transverse momenta and\ncontributes to the largest uncertainty of the dipole model predictions.\n", "  We investigate the physical consequences of the survival of the effects of\nthe U(1)_A anomaly in the chiral symmetric phase of QCD, and show that the free\nenergy density is a singular function of the quark mass m, in the chiral limit,\nand that the $\\sigma$ and $\\bar\\pi$ susceptibilities diverge in this limit at\nany $T\\ge T_c$. We also show that the difference between the $\\bar\\pi$ and\n$\\bar\\delta$ susceptibilities diverges in the chiral limit at any $T\\ge T_c$, a\nresult which seems to be excluded by recent results of Tomiya et al. from\nnumerical simulations of two-flavor QCD. We also discuss on the generalization\nof these results to the $N_f\\ge 3$ model.\n", "  The sample of known star clusters, the fundamental building blocks of\ngalaxies, in the Milky Way is still extremely incomplete for objects beyond a\ndistance of 1-2kpc. Many of the more distant and young clusters are compact and\nhidden behind large amounts of extinction. We thus utilised the deep high\nresolution near infrared surveys UGPS and VVV to uncover so far unknown compact\nclusters and to analyse their properties.\n  Images of all objects in the area covered by these two surveys, and which are\nlisted as Galaxy in SIMBAD have been inspected and 125 so far unknown stellar\nclusters and candidate clusters have been identified. Based on the frequent\nassociations with star formation indicators (nebulosities, IRAS sources, Hii\nregions, masers) we find that the typical cluster in our sample is young, at\ndistances between 1-10kpc and has a typical apparent radius of 25arcsec. We\nsuggest more systematic searches e.g. at all positions of 2MASS extended\nsources to increase the completeness of the known cluster sample beyond\ndistances of 2kpc.\n", "  The cosmogenic neutron yield $Y_n$ characterizes the matter ability to\nproduce neutrons under the effect of cosmic ray muons with spectrum and average\nenergy corresponding to an observation depth. The yield is the basic\ncharacteristic of cosmogenic neutrons. The neutron production rate and neutron\nflux both are derivatives of the yield. The constancy of the exponents $\\alpha$\nand $\\beta$ in the known dependences of the yield on energy $Y_n {\\propto}\nE_{\\mu}^\\alpha$ and the atomic weight $Y_n {\\propto} A^\\beta$ allows to combine\nthese dependences in a single formula and to connect the yield with muon energy\nloss in the matter. As a result, the phenomenological formulas for the yield of\nmuon-induced charged pions and neutrons can be obtained. These expressions both\nare associated with nuclear loss of the ultrarelativistic muons, which provides\nthe main contribution to the total neutron yield. The total yield can be\ndescribed by a universal formula, which is the best fit of experimental data.\n", "  We present high statistics simulation data for the average time $\\langle\nT_{\\rm cover}(L)\\rangle$ that a random walk needs to cover completely a\n2-dimensional torus of size $L\\times L$. They confirm the mathematical\nprediction that $\\langle T_{\\rm cover}(L)\\rangle \\sim (L \\ln L)^2$ for large\n$L$, but the prefactor {\\it seems} to deviate significantly from the supposedly\nexact result $4/\\pi$ derived by A. Dembo {\\it et al.}, Ann. Math. {\\bf 160},\n433 (2004), if the most straightforward extrapolation is used. On the other\nhand, we find that this scaling does hold for the time $ T_{\\rm N(t)=1}(L)$ at\nwhich the average number of yet unvisited sites is 1, as also predicted\npreviously. This might suggest (wrongly) that $\\langle T_{\\rm cover}(L)\\rangle$\nand $T_{\\rm N(t)=1}(L)$ scale differently, although the distribution of\nrescaled cover times becomes sharp in the limit $L\\to\\infty$. But our results\ncan be reconciled with those of Dembo {\\it et al.} by a very slow and {\\it\nnon-monotonic} convergence of $\\langle T_{\\rm cover}(L)\\rangle/(L \\ln L)^2$, as\nhad been indeed proven by Belius {\\it et al.} [Prob. Theory \\& Related Fields\n{\\bf 167}, 1 (2014)] for Brownian walks, and was conjectured by them to hold\nalso for lattice walks.\n", "  $\\gamma$ Cas is the prototype of a small population of B0-B1.5 III-V\nclassical Be (cBe) stars that emit anomalous and hard X-rays with a unique\narray of properties. $\\gamma$ Cas is known to host, like other cBe stars, a\ndecretion disk and also a low mass companion. Recently Postnov et al. have\nposited that this companion is a magnetized rapidly spinning neutron star that\ndeflects direct gravitational accretion from a stellar/disk wind via the\n\"propeller mechanism.\" These authors state that the key X-ray observations are\n\"remarkably well produced\" in this scenario. We reexamine this mechanism in\ndetail and conclude that there are a number of fatal objections in its\napplication to the $\\gamma$ Cas case. Among other considerations these issues\ninclude the prediction under the propeller scenario of a much smaller\npopulation of $\\gamma$ Cas stars than is observed and the lack of allowance for\nobserved correlations of X-ray and UV and/or optical properties over a variety\nof timescales.\n", "  We extend previous searches for X-ray spectral modulations induced by\nALP-photon conversion to a variety of new sources, all consisting of quasars or\nAGNs located in or behind galaxy clusters. We consider a total of seven new\nsources, with data drawn from the Chandra archive. In all cases the spectrum is\nwell fit by an absorbed power-law with no evidence for spectral modulations,\nallowing constraints to be placed on the ALP-photon coupling parameter\n$g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$. Two sources are particularly good: the Seyfert galaxy\n2E3140 in A1795 and the AGN NGC3862 within the cluster A1367, leading to 95\\%\nbounds for light ALPs ($m_a \\lesssim 10^{-12} {\\rm eV}$) of $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}\n\\lesssim 1.5 \\times 10^{-12} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ and $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma} \\lesssim\n2.4 \\times 10^{-12} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ respectively.\n", "  We reexamine, update and extend a suggestion we made fifteen years ago for\nmeasuring the photon polarization in $b \\to s\\gamma$ by observing in $B \\to\nK\\pi\\pi\\gamma$ an asymmetry of the photon with respect to the $K\\pi\\pi$ plane.\nAsymmetries are calculated for different charged final states due to\nintermediate $K_1(1400)$ and $K_1(1270)$ resonant states. Three distinct\ninterference mechanisms are identified contributing to asymmetries at different\nlevels for these two kaon resonances. For $K_1(1400)$ decays including a final\nstate $\\pi^0$ an asymmetry around $+30\\%$ is calculated, dominated by\ninterference of two intermediate $K^*\\pi$ states, while an asymmetry around\n$+10\\%$ in decays including final $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ is dominated by interference of\n$S$ and $D$ wave $K^*\\pi$ amplitudes. In decays via $K_1(1270)$ to final states\nincluding a $\\pi^0$ a negative asymmetry is favored up to $-10\\%$ if one\nassumes $S$ wave dominance in decays to $K^*\\pi$ and $K\\rho$, while in decays\ninvolving $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ the asymmetry can vary anywhere in the range $-13\\%$ to\n$+24\\%$ depending on unknown phases. For more precise asymmetry predictions in\nthe latter decays we propose studying phases in $K_1 \\to K^*\\pi, K\\rho$ by\nperforming dedicated amplitude analyses of $B\\to J/\\psi(\\psi') K\\pi\\pi$. In\norder to increase statistics in studies of $B\\to K\\pi\\pi\\gamma$ we suggest\nusing isospin symmetry to combine in the same analysis samples of charged and\nneutral $B$ decays.\n", "  We study dark matter production in scenarios where a scale invariant hidden\nsector interacts with the Standard Model degrees of freedom via a Higgs portal\n$\\lambda \\Phi^\\dagger\\Phi s^2$. If the hidden sector is very weakly coupled to\nthe SM but exhibits strong interactions within its own particle species, the\ndark matter abundance may arise as a result of a dark freeze-out occurring in\nthe hidden sector. Because of scale invariance, the free parameters in the\nhidden sector are determined and the dark matter candidate exhibits a 'WIMP\nmiracle of the second kind'. Demonstrating the predictive power of scale\ninvariance, we carry out thorough analysis of dark matter production in several\nbenchmark scenarios where the hidden sector contains either a scalar, fermion\n(sterile neutrino), or vector dark matter, and discuss the observational\nconsequences of these scenarios.\n", "  We present an analysis of the long-term X-ray variability of the extreme\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy IRAS 13224-3809 using principal component\nanalysis (PCA) and fractional excess variability (Fvar) spectra to identify\nmodel-independent spectral components. We identify a series of variability\npeaks in both the first PCA component and Fvar spectrum which correspond to the\nstrongest predicted absorption lines from the ultra-fast outflow (UFO)\ndiscovered by Parker et al. (2017). We also find higher order PCA components,\nwhich correspond to variability of the soft excess and reflection features. The\nsubtle differences between RMS and PCA results argue that the observed\nflux-dependence of the absorption is due to increased ionization of the gas,\nrather than changes in column density or covering fraction. This result\ndemonstrates that we can detect outflows from variability alone, and that\nvariability studies of UFOs are an extremely promising avenue for future\nresearch.\n", "  Entangled quantum states, such as N00N states, are of major importance for\nquantum technologies due to their quantum-enhanced performance. At the same\ntime, their quantum correlations are relatively vulnerable when they are\nsubjected to imperfections. Therefore, it is crucial to determine under which\ncircumstances their distinct quantum features can be exploited. In this paper,\nwe study the entanglement property of noisy N00N states. This class of states\nis a generalization of N00N states including various attenuation effects, such\nas mixing, constant or fluctuating losses, and dephasing. To verify their\nentanglement, we pursue two strategies: detection-based entanglement witnesses\nand entanglement quasiprobabilities. Both methods result from our solution of\nso-called separability eigenvalue equations. In particular, the entanglement\nquasiprobabilities allow for a full entanglement characterization. As examples\nof our general treatment, the cases of N00N states subjected to Gaussian\ndephasing and fluctuating atmospheric losses are explicitly studied. In any\ncorrelated fluctuating loss channel, entanglement is found to survive for\nnon-zero transmissivity. In addition, an extension of our approach to\nmultipartite systems is given, and the relation to the quantum-optical\nnonclassicality in phase-space is discussed.\n", "  We obtain Euler-Lagrange equations, transversality conditions and a\nNoether-like theorem for Herglotz-type variational problems with Lagrangians\ndepending on generalized fractional derivatives. As an application, we consider\na damped harmonic oscillator with time-depending mass and elasticity, and\narbitrary memory effects.\n", "  We present the results of a set of N-body simulations following the long-term\nevolution of the rotational properties of star cluster models evolving in the\nexternal tidal field of their host galaxy, after an initial phase of violent\nrelaxation. The effects of two-body relaxation and escape of stars lead to a\nredistribution of the ordered kinetic energy from the inner to the outer\nregions, ultimately determining a progressive general loss of angular momentum;\nthese effects are reflected in the overall decline the rotation curve as the\ncluster evolves and loses stars.\n  We show that all of our models share the same dependence of the remaining\nfraction of the initial rotation on the fraction of the initial mass lost. As\nthe cluster evolves and loses part of its initial angular momentum, it becomes\nincreasingly dominated by random motions, but even after several tens of\nrelaxation times, and losing a significant fraction of its initial mass, a\ncluster can still be characterized by a non-negligible ratio of the rotational\nvelocity to the velocity dispersion. This result is in qualitative agreement\nwith the recently observed kinematical complexity which characterizes several\nGalactic globular clusters.\n", "  We study the stability of a recently proposed model of scalar-field matter\ncalled mimetic dark matter or imperfect dark matter. It has been known that\nmimetic matter with higher derivative terms suffers from gradient instabilities\nin scalar perturbations. To seek for an instability-free extension of imperfect\ndark matter, we develop an effective theory of cosmological perturbations\nsubject to the constraint on the scalar field's kinetic term. This is done by\nusing the unifying framework of general scalar-tensor theories based on the ADM\nformalism. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to construct a model of\nimperfect dark matter which is free from ghost and gradient instabilities. As a\nside remark, we also show that mimetic $F({\\cal R})$ theory is plagued with the\nOstrogradsky instability.\n", "  In this work we study how a viral capsid can change conformation using\ntechniques of Large Deviations Theory for stochastic differential equations.\nThe viral capsid is a model of a complex system in which many units - the\nproteins forming the capsomers - interact by weak forces to form a structure\nwith exceptional mechanical resistance. The destabilization of such a structure\nis interesting both per se, since it is related either to infection or\nmaturation processes, and because it yields insights into the stability of\ncomplex structures in which the constitutive elements interact by weak\nattractive forces. We focus here on a simplified model of a dodecahederal viral\ncapsid, and assume that the capsomers are rigid plaquettes with one degree of\nfreedom each. We compute the most probable transition path from the closed\ncapsid to the final configuration using minimum energy paths, and discuss the\nstability of intermediate states.\n", "  We present an approach for reconstructing networks of pulse-coupled\nneuron-like oscillators from passive observation of pulse trains of all nodes.\nIt is assumed that units are described by their phase response curves and that\ntheir phases are instantaneously reset by incoming pulses. Using an iterative\nprocedure, we recover the properties of all nodes, namely their phase response\ncurves and natural frequencies, as well as strengths of all directed\nconnections.\n", "  We present an overview of the first data release (DR1) and first-look science\nfrom the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green\nBank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_V \\gtrsim 7$\nmag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key\nmolecular tracers. This first release includes the data for four regions in\nGould Belt clouds: B18 in Taurus, NGC 1333 in Perseus, L1688 in Ophiuchus, and\nOrion A North in Orion. We compare the NH$_3$ emission to dust continuum\nemission from Herschel, and find that the two tracers correspond closely.\nNH$_3$ is present in over 60\\% of lines-of-sight with $A_V \\gtrsim 7$ mag in\nthree of the four DR1 regions, in agreement with expectations from previous\nobservations. The sole exception is B18, where NH$_3$ is detected toward ~ 40\\%\nof lines-of-sight with $A_V \\gtrsim 7$ mag. Moreover, we find that the NH$_3$\nemission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense\ncores. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$ column\ndensities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$\n(1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion,\n${\\sigma}_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_K$, vary systematically between\nthe regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value\nand spread of ${\\sigma}_v$ and $T_K$ with increasing star formation activity.\nThe data presented in this paper are publicly available.\n", "  We present optical integral field spectroscopy $-$ obtained with the Gemini\nMulti-Object Spectrograph $-$ of the inner $4.0 \\times 5.8$ kpc$^2$ of the\nnarrow line radio galaxy 3C 33 at a spatial resolution of 0.58 kpc. The gas\nemission shows three brightest structures: a strong knot of nuclear emission\nand two other knots at $\\approx 1.4$ kpc south-west and north-east of the\nnucleus along the ionization axis. We detect two kinematic components in the\nemission lines profiles, with a \"broader component\" (with velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma > 150$ km s$^{-1}$) being dominant within a $\\sim$ 1 kpc wide strip\n(\"the nuclear strip\") running from the south-east to the north-west,\nperpendicular to the radio jet, and a narrower component ($\\sigma < 100$ km\ns$^{-1}$) dominating elsewhere. Centroid velocity maps reveal a rotation\npattern with velocity amplitudes reaching $\\sim \\pm 350$ km s$^{-1}$ in the\nregion dominated by the narrow component, while residual blueshifts and\nredshifts relative to rotation are observed in the nuclear strip, where we also\nobserve the highest values of the [N II]/H{\\alpha}, [S II]/H{\\alpha} and [O\nI]/H{\\alpha} line ratios, and an increase of the gas temperature ($\\sim 18000$\nK), velocity dispersion and electron density ($\\sim 500$ cm$^{-3}$). We\ninterpret these residuals and increased line ratios as due to a lateral\nexpansion of the ambient gas in the nuclear strip due to shocks produced by the\npassage of the radio jet. The effect of this expansion in the surrounding\nmedium is very small, as its estimated kinetic power represents only $2.6 - 3.0\n\\times 10^{-5}$ of the AGN bolometric luminosity. A possible signature of\ninflow is revealed by an increase in the [O I]/H{\\alpha} ratio values and\nvelocity dispersions in the shape of two spiral arms extending to 2.3 kpc\nnorth-east and south-west from the nucleus.\n", "  The radiative transport of photons through arbitrary three-dimensional (3D)\nstructures of dust is a challenging problem due to the anisotropic scattering\nof dust grains and strong coupling between different spatial regions. The\nradiative transfer problem in 3D is solved using Monte Carlo or Ray Tracing\ntechniques as no full analytic solution exists for the true 3D structures. We\nprovide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark composed of a slab of\ndust with uniform density externally illuminated by a star. This simple 3D\nbenchmark is explicitly formulated to provide tests of the different components\nof the radiative transfer problem including dust absorption, scattering, and\nemission. This benchmark includes models with a range of dust optical depths\nfully probing cases that are optically thin at all wavelengths to optically\nthick at most wavelengths. This benchmark includes solutions for the full dust\nemission including single photon (stochastic) heating as well as two\nsimplifying approximations: One where all grains are considered in equilibrium\nwith the radiation field and one where the emission is from a single effective\ngrain with size-distribution-averaged properties. A total of six Monte Carlo\ncodes and one Ray Tracing code provide solutions to this benchmark. Comparison\nof the results revealed that the global SEDs are consistent on average to a few\npercent for all but the scattered stellar flux at very high optical depths. The\nimage results are consistent within 10%, again except for the stellar scattered\nflux at very high optical depths. The lack of agreement between different codes\nof the scattered flux at high optical depths is quantified for the first time.\nWe provide the first 3D dust radiative transfer benchmark and validate the\naccuracy of this benchmark through comparisons between multiple independent\ncodes and detailed convergence tests.\n", "  In an analogy to the odd-dimensional case we define the parity anomaly as the\npart of the one-loop effective action for fermions associated with spectral\nasymmetry of the Dirac operator. This quantity is computed directly on\nfour-dimensional manifolds with boundary and related to the Chern-Simons\ncurrent on the boundary. Despite a quite unusual Chern-Simons level obtained,\nthe action is gauge invariant and passes all consistency checks.\n", "  In the landscape perspective, our Universe begins with a quantum tunneling\nfrom an eternally-inflating parent vacuum, followed by a period of slow-roll\ninflation. We investigate the tunneling process and calculate the probability\ndistribution for the initial conditions and for the number of e-folds of\nslow-roll inflation, modeling the landscape by a small-field one-dimensional\nrandom Gaussian potential. We find that such a landscape is fully consistent\nwith observations, but the probability for future detection of spatial\ncurvature is rather low, $P \\sim 10^{-3}$.\n", "  Signaling in enzymatic networks is typically triggered by environmental\nfluctuations, resulting in a series of stochastic chemical reactions, leading\nto corruption of the signal by noise. For example, information flow is\ninitiated by binding of extracellular ligands to receptors, which is\ntransmitted through a {cascade involving} kinase-phosphatase stochastic\nchemical reactions. For a class of such networks, we develop a general\nfield-theoretic approach in order to calculate the error in signal transmission\nas a function of an appropriate control variable. Application of the theory to\na simple push-pull network, a module in the kinase-phosphatase cascade,\nrecovers the exact results for error in signal transmission previously obtained\nusing umbral calculus (Phys. Rev. X., {\\bf 4}, 041017 (2014)). We illustrate\nthe generality of the theory by studying the minimal errors in noise reduction\nin a reaction cascade with two connected push-pull modules. Such a cascade\nbehaves as an effective {three-species} network with a pseudo intermediate. In\nthis case, optimal information transfer, resulting in the smallest square of\nthe error between the input and output, occurs with a time delay, which is\ngiven by the inverse of the decay rate of the pseudo intermediate. There are\nsubstantial deviations between simulations and predictions of the linear theory\nin error in signal propagation in an enzymatic push-pull network for a certain\nrange of parameters. Inclusion of second order perturbative corrections shows\nthat differences between simulations and theoretical predictions are minimized.\nOur study establishes that {a} field theoretic formulation {of} stochastic\nbiological {signaling offers} a systematic way to understand error propagation\nin networks of arbitrary complexity.\n", "  After the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GW), detection of\nstochastic background of GWs is an important next step, and the first GW event\nsuggests that it is within the reach of the second-generation ground-based GW\ndetectors. Such a GW signal is typically tiny, and can be detected by\ncross-correlating the data from two spatially separated detectors if the\ndetector noise is uncorrelated. It has been advocated, however, that the global\nmagnetic fields in the Earth-ionosphere cavity produce the environmental\ndisturbances at low-frequency bands, known as Schumann resonances, which\npotentially couple with GW detectors. In this paper, we present a simple\nanalytical model to estimate its impact on the detection of stochastic GWs. The\nmodel crucially depends on the geometry of the detector pair through the\ndirectional coupling, and we investigate the basic properties of the correlated\nmagnetic noise based on the analytic expressions. The model reproduces the\nmajor trend of the recently measured global correlation between the GW\ndetectors via magnetometer. The estimated values of the impact of correlated\nnoise also match those obtained from the measurement. Finally, we give an\nimplication to the detection of stochastic GWs including upcoming detectors,\nKAGRA and LIGO India. The model suggests that LIGO Hanford-Virgo and\nVirgo-KAGRA pairs are possibly less sensitive to the correlated noise, and can\nachieve a better sensitivity to the stochastic GW signal in the most\npessimistic case.\n", "  We present a comprehensive \\textit{ab initio} analysis of the spin-charge\ncorrelations at the Tl/Si(111) surface, where the spin-orbit interaction is so\nstrong that a detailed treatment of the non-collinear electron spin appears\ndecisive for the correct description of the response properties. The\nrelativistic limit enforces a unified treatment of the spin and charge\ndensities as a four-vector, and the response function acquires then a\n4$\\times$4 tensor structure. Our all-electron implementation allows to resolve\nthe real space structure of the possible collective modes, and demonstrates the\nemergence of a novel collective excitation combining transverse-spin and\nordinary charge oscillations of a similar order of magnitude, whose spin\ncharacter is strongly enhanced as we approach the $q$$\\rightarrow$0 momentum\nlimit.\n", "  We study the dark matter phenomenology of non-minimal composite Higgs models\nwith $SO(7)$ broken to the exceptional group $G_2$. In addition to the Higgs,\nthree pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons arise, one of which is electrically\nneutral. A parity symmetry is enough to ensure this resonance is stable. In\nfact, if the breaking of the Goldstone symmetry is driven by the fermion\nsector, this $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is automatically unbroken in the\nelectroweak phase. In this case, the relic density, as well as the expected\nindirect, direct and collider signals are then uniquely determined by the value\nof the compositeness scale, $f$. Current experimental bounds allow to account\nfor a large fraction of the dark matter of the Universe if the dark matter\nparticle is part of an electroweak triplet. The totality of the relic abundance\ncan be accommodated if instead this particle is a composite singlet. In both\ncases, the scale $f$ and the dark matter mass are of the order of a few TeV.\n", "  We study localization and charge dynamics in a monochromatically driven\none-dimensional Anderson insulator focussing on the low-frequency,\nstrong-driving regime. We study this problem using a mapping of the Floquet\nHamiltonian to a hopping problem with correlated disorder in one higher\nharmonic-space dimension. We show that (i) resonances in this model correspond\nto \\emph{adiabatic} Landau-Zener (LZ) transitions that occur due to level\ncrossings between lattice sites over the course of dynamics; (ii) the\nproliferation of these resonances leads to dynamics that \\emph{appear}\ndiffusive over a single drive cycle, but the system always remains localized;\n(iii) actual charge transport occurs over many drive cycles due to slow\ndephasing between these LZ orbits and is logarithmic-in-time, with a crucial\nrole being played by far-off Mott-like resonances; and (iv) applying a\nspatially-varying random phase to the drive tends to decrease localization,\nsuggestive of weak-localization physics. We derive the conditions for the\nstrong driving regime, determining the parametric dependencies of the size of\nFloquet eigenstates, and time-scales associated with the dynamics, and\ncorroborate the findings using both numerical scaling collapses and analytical\narguments.\n", "  The statistical-thermodynamic dislocation theory developed in previous papers\nis used here in an analysis of high-temperature deformation of aluminum and\nsteel. Using physics-based parameters that we expect theoretically to be\nindependent of strain rate and temperature, we are able to fit experimental\nstress-strain curves for three different strain rates and three different\ntemperatures for each of these two materials. Our theoretical curves include\nyielding transitions at zero strain in agreement with experiment. We find that\nthermal softening effects are important even at the lowest temperatures and\nsmallest strain rates.\n", "  NGC\\,2403, NGC\\,300 and M33 are three nearby pure-disc galaxies with similar\nstellar mass in different environments, they are benchmarks for understanding\nlate-type spiral galaxies in different environments. The chemical evolution and\ngrowth of their discs are investigated by using the simple chemical evolution\nmodel, in which their discs are assumed to originate and grow through the\naccretion of the primordial gas, and the gas outflow process is also taken into\naccount. Through comparative study of the best-fitting model predicted star\nformation histories for them, we hope to derive a picture of the local\nenvironment on the evolution and star formation histories of galaxies and\nwhether or not the isolated galaxies follow similar evolution history. Our\nresults show that these three galaxies accumulated more than 50 percent of\ntheir stellar mass at $z\\,<\\,1$. It can be also found that the metallicity\ngradients in isolated spiral galaxies NGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 are similar and\nobviously steeper than that in M33, when the metallicity gradients are\nexpressed in ${\\rm dex}\\,R_{\\rm 25}^{-1}$. The similar metallicity gradients in\nNGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 indicate that they may experience similar chemical\nevolutionary histories. The principal epoch of star formation on the discs of\nNGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 is earlier than that on the disc of M33, and the mean\nage of stellar populations along the discs of both NGC\\,2403 and NGC\\,300 is\nolder than that of M33. Our results indicates that the evolution and star\nformation history of a galaxy indeed depends on its local environment, at least\nfor galaxies with stellar mass of $10^{9.2}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}\\sim10^{9.7}\\,\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We complete the construction of the sphaleron $\\widehat{S}$ in $SU(3)$\nYang-Mills-Higgs theory with a single Higgs triplet by solving the reduced\nfield equations numerically. The energy of the $SU(3)$ sphaleron $\\widehat{S}$\nis found to be of the same order as the energy of a previously known solution,\nthe embedded $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ sphaleron $S$. In addition, we discuss\n$\\widehat{S}$ in an extended $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with three Higgs\ntriplets, where all eight gauge bosons get an equal mass in the vacuum. This\nextended $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs theory may be considered as a toy model of\nquantum chromodynamics without quark fields and we conjecture that the\n$\\widehat{S}$ gauge fields play a significant role in the nonperturbative\ndynamics of quantum chromodynamics (which does not have fundamental scalar\nfields but gets a mass scale from quantum effects).\n", "  There is increasing numerical evidence that scalar fields can form long-lived\nquasi-bound states around black holes. Recent perturbative and numerical\nrelativity calculations have provided further confirmation in a variety of\nphysical systems, including both static and accreting black holes, and\ncollapsing fermionic stars. In this work we investigate this issue yet again in\nthe context of gravitationally unstable boson stars leading to black hole\nformation. We build a large sample of spherically symmetric initial models,\nboth stable and unstable, incorporating a self-interaction potential with a\nquartic term. The three different outcomes of unstable models, namely migration\nto the stable branch, total dispersion, and collapse to a black hole, are also\npresent for self-interacting boson stars. Our simulations show that for\nblack-hole-forming models, a scalar-field remnant is found outside the\nblack-hole horizon, oscillating at a different frequency than that of the\noriginal boson star. This result is in good agreement with recent spherically\nsymmetric simulations of unstable Proca stars collapsing to black holes.\n", "  Surface impurities and contamination often seriously degrade the properties\nof two-dimensional materials such as graphene. To remove contamination, thermal\nannealing is commonly used. We present a comparative analysis of annealing\ntreatments in air and in vacuum, both ex situ and \"pre-situ\", where an\nultra-high vacuum treatment chamber is directly connected to an\naberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. While ex situ\ntreatments do remove contamination, it is challenging to obtain atomically\nclean surfaces after ambient transfer. However, pre-situ cleaning with\nradiative or laser heating appears reliable and well suited to clean graphene\nwithout undue damage to its structure.\n", "  Proposed near-future upgrades of the current advanced interferometric\ngravitational wave detectors include the usage of frequency dependent squeezed\nlight to reduce the current sensitivity-limiting quantum noise. We quantify and\ndescribe the degradation effects that spatial mode-mismatches between optical\nresonators have on the squeezed field. These mode-mismatches can to first order\nbe described by scattering of light into second-order Gaussian modes. As a\ndemonstration of principle, we also show that squeezing the second-order\nHermite-Gaussian modes $\\mathrm{HG}_{02}$ and $\\mathrm{HG}_{20}$, in addition\nto the fundamental mode, has the potential to increase the robustness to\nspatial mode-mismatches. This scheme, however, requires independently optimized\nsqueeze angles for each squeezed spatial mode, which would be challenging to\nrealise in practise.\n", "  The interplay of almost degenerate levels in quantum dots and molecular\njunctions with possibly different couplings to the reservoirs has lead to many\nobservable phenomena, such as the Fano effect, transmission phase slips and the\nSU(4) Kondo effect. Here we predict a dramatic repeated disappearance and\nreemergence of the SU(4) and anomalous SU(2) Kondo effects with increasing gate\nvoltage. This phenomenon is attributed to the level occupation switching which\nhas been previously invoked to explain the universal transmission phase slips\nin the conductance through a quantum dot. We use analytical arguments and\nnumerical renormalization group calculations to explain the observations and\ndiscuss their experimental relevance and dependence on the physical parameters.\n", "  This work analyses the effect of the Helium content on synthetic\nPeriod-Luminosity Relations (PLRs) and Period-Wesenheit Relations (PWRs) of\nCepheids and the systematic uncertainties on the derived distances that a\nhidden population of He-enhanced Cepheids may generate. We use new stellar and\npulsation models to build a homogeneous and consistent framework to derive the\nCepheid features. The Cepheid populations expected in synthetic color-magnitude\ndiagrams of young stellar systems (from 20 Myr to 250 Myr) are computed in\nseveral photometric bands for Y = 0.25 and Y = 0.35, at a fixed metallicity (Z\n= 0.008). The PLRs appear to be very similar in the two cases, with negligible\neffects (few %) on distances, while PWRs differ somewhat, with systematic\nuncertainties in deriving distances as high as about 7% at log P < 1.5.\nStatistical effects due to the number of variables used to determine the\nrelations contribute to a distance systematic error of the order of few\npercent, with values decreasing from optical to near-infrared bands. The\nempirical PWRs derived from multi-wavelength datasets for the Large Magellanic\nCloud (LMC) is in a very good agreement with our theoretical PWRs obtained with\na standard He content, supporting the evidence that LMC Cepheids do not show\nany He effect.\n", "  The equations of state, formation energy and migration energy barrier of the\noxygen vacancy in SrFeO${_3}$ and LaFeO${_3}$ were calculated with the\ndiffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method. Calculations were also performed\nwith various Density Functional Theory (DFT) approximations for comparison. DMC\nreproduces the measured cohesive energies of these materials with errors below\n0.23(5) eV and the structural properties within 1% of the experimental values.\nThe DMC formation energies of the oxygen vacancy in SrFeO${_3}$ and LaFeO${_3}$\nunder oxygen-rich conditions are 1.3(1) and 6.24(7) eV, respectively. Similar\ncalculations with semi-local DFT approximations for LaFeO$_3$ yielded vacancy\nformation energies 1.5 eV lower. Comparison of charge density evaluated with\nDMC and DFT approximations shows that DFT tends to overdelocalize the electrons\nin defected SrFeO${_3}$ and LaFeO${_3}$. Calculations with DMC and LDA yield\nsimilar vacancy migration energy barriers, indicating that steric/electrostatic\neffects mainly determine migration barriers in these materials.\n", "  This work analyses the quantum properties of counter-propagating twin beams\ngenerated by a Mirrorless Optical Parametric Oscillator in the continuous\nvariable regime. Despite the lack of the filtering effect of a cavity, we show\nthat in the vicinity of its threshold it may generate high levels of narrowband\nsqueezing and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlation, completely comparable\nto what can be obtained in standard optical parametric oscillators.\n", "  $J/\\psi$ observables of p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV\nare calculated using the PYTHIA event generator for the production of $c$ and\n$\\bar c$ and the Wigner density formalism. The charm quark momentum from PYTHIA\nis tuned in such a way that the transverse momentum and rapidity distribution\ncorrespond to the Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations\nand hence to the experimental data for open charm mesons. Using the Wigner\ndensity of the charmonium wave function we calculate for each charm quark pair\nthe probability to form a charmonium. As a result, the experimental data on the\ntotal $J/\\psi$ yield, its rapidity and transverse momentum distribution as well\nas the fractions of feed-down from excited states of charmonium are reproduced.\nApplying the same approach to relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we find, if\nquark gluon plasma (QGP) effects are ignored, a considerable enhancement of the\nprimordial $J/\\psi$'s.\n", "  We study interacting Majorana fermions in two dimensions as a low-energy\neffective model of a vortex lattice in two-dimensional time-reversal-invariant\ntopological superconductors. For that purpose, we implement ab-initio quantum\nMonte Carlo simulation to the Majorana fermion system in which the\npath-integral measure is given by a semi-positive Pfaffian. We discuss\nspontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry at finite temperature.\n", "  We present a formalism to compute Brownian thermal noise in functional\noptical surfaces such as grating reflectors, photonic crystal slabs or complex\nmetamaterials. Such computations are based on a specific readout variable,\ntypically a surface integral of a dielectric interface displacement weighed by\na form factor. This paper shows how to relate this form factor to Maxwell's\nstress tensor computed on all interfaces of the moving surface. As an example,\nwe examine Brownian thermal noise in monolithic T-shape grating reflectors. The\nprevious computations by Heinert et al. [Heinert et al., PRD 88 (2013)]\nutilizing a simplified readout form factor produced estimates of thermal noise\nthat are tens of percent higher than those of the exact analysis in the present\npaper. The relation between the form factor and Maxwell's stress tensor implies\na close correlation between the optical properties of functional optical\nsurfaces and thermal noise.\n", "  $8-Pmmn$ borophene is a polymorph of borophene which hosts an anisotropic\ntilted Dirac cone. Using a low energy effective Hamiltonian for borophene, we\nanalytically calculate the density-density response function of borophene and\nstudy its anisotropic plasmon dispersion and screening properties. We find that\nthe anisotropic plasmon mode in $8-Pmmn$ borophene, remains undamped for higher\nenergies along the mirror symmetry direction. The friedel oscillation in\nborophene is found to decay as $r^{-3}$ in the large $r$ limit, with both the\namplitude as well as the periodicity of the Friedel oscillations being\nanisotropic.\n", "  We consider Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) on graphs with transient\nadjacency matrix and obtain a quasi-free state exhibiting BEC is non-factor and\ndecompose into generalized coherent states. We review necessary and sufficient\nconditions that a generalized coherent state is faithful, factor, and pure and\ngeneralized coherent states are quasi-equivalent as well.\n", "  In this article the study of four dimensional spaces with NUT charges and\ntheir ground states is continued. In particular, through the introduction of an\nimproved action principle containing topological densities, it is shown that\nthese spaces have simple and sound thermodynamic relations. As an example the\nentropy of Taub-Bolt-AdS solution is computed in terms of a Noether charge.\n", "  We present an improved result of lattice computation of the proton decay\nmatrix elements in $N_f=2+1$ QCD. In this study, the significant improvement of\nstatistical accuracy by adopting the error reduction technique of\nAll-mode-averaging, is achieved for relevant form factor to proton (and also\nneutron) decay on the gauge ensemble of $N_f=2+1$ domain-wall fermions in\n$m_\\pi=0.34$--0.69 GeV on 2.7~fm$^3$ lattice as used in our previous work\n\\cite{Aoki:2013yxa}. We improve total accuracy of matrix elements to 10--15\\%\nfrom 30--40\\% for $p\\rightarrow\\pi e^+$ or from 20--40\\% for $p\\rightarrow K\n\\bar\\nu$. The accuracy of the low energy constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in the\nleading-order baryon chiral perturbation theory (BChPT) of proton decay are\nalso improved. The relevant form factors of $p\\rightarrow \\pi$ estimated\nthrough the \"direct\" lattice calculation from three-point function appear to be\n1.4 times smaller than those from the \"indirect\" method using BChPT with\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. It turns out that the utilization of our result will\nprovide a factor 2--3 larger proton partial lifetime than that obtained using\nBChPT. We also discuss the use of these parameters in a dark matter model.\n", "  Beam dump experiments have been used to search for new particles, $\\phi$,\nwith null results interpreted in terms of limits on masses $m_\\phi$ and\ncoupling constants $\\epsilon$. However these limits have been obtained by using\napproximations [including the Weizs\\\"{a}cker-Williams (WW) approximation] or\nMonte-Carlo simulations. We display methods to obtain the cross section and the\nresulting particle production rates without using approximations on the phase\nspace integral or Monte-Carlo simulations. In our previous work we examined the\ncase of the new scalar boson production; in this paper we explore all possible\nnew spin-0 and spin-1 particles. We show that the approximations cannot be used\nto obtain accurate values of cross sections. The corresponding exclusion plots\ndiffer by substantial amounts when seen on a linear scale. Furthermore, a new\nregion ($m_\\phi<2m_e$) of parameter space can be explored without using one of\nthe common approximations, $m_\\phi\\gg m_e$. We derive new expressions for the\nthree photon decays of dark photon and four photon decays of new axial-vector\nbosons. As a result, the production cross section and exclusion region of\ndifferent low mass ($m_\\phi<2m_e$) bosons are very different. Moreover, our\nmethod can be used as a consistency check for Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  Experimental realizations of topological quantum systems and detections of\ntopological invariants in ultracold atomic systems have been a greatly\nattractive topic. In this work, we propose a scheme to realize topologically\ndifferent phases in a bichromatic optical lattice subjected to a periodically\ndriven tilt harmonic oscillation, which can be effectively described by a\nsuperlattice model with tunable long-range hopping processes. By tuning the\nratio of nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping\namplitudes, the system undergoes a topological phase transition accompanied by\nthe change of topological numbers of the lowest band from -1 to 2. Using a\nslowly time-periodic modulation, the system emerges distinct quantized\ntopological pumped charges (TPCs) of atoms in the filled band for different\ntopological phases. Our scheme is realizable in current cold atomic technique.\n", "  We use integrated-light spectroscopic observations to measure metallicities\nand chemical abundances for two extragalactic young massive star clusters\n(NGC1313-379 and NGC1705-1). The spectra were obtained with the X-Shooter\nspectrograph on the ESO Very Large Telescope. We compute synthetic\nintegrated-light spectra, based on colour-magnitude diagrams for the brightest\nstars in the clusters from Hubble Space Telescope photometry and theoretical\nisochrones. Furthermore, we test the uncertainties arising from the use of\nColour Magnitude Diagram (CMD) +Isochrone method compared to an Isochrone-Only\nmethod. The abundances of the model spectra are iteratively adjusted until the\nbest fit to the observations is obtained. In this work we mainly focus on the\noptical part of the spectra. We find metallicities of [Fe/H] = $-$0.84 $\\pm$\n0.07 and [Fe/H] = $-$0.78 $\\pm$ 0.10 for NGC1313-379 and NGC1705-1,\nrespectively. We measure [$\\alpha$/Fe]=$+$0.06 $\\pm$ 0.11 for NGC1313-379 and a\nsuper-solar [$\\alpha$/Fe]=$+$0.32 $\\pm$ 0.12 for NGC1705-1. The roughly solar\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] ratio in NGC1313-379 resembles those for young stellar\npopulations in the Milky Way (MW) and the Magellanic Clouds, whereas the\nenhanced [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratio in NGC1705-1 is similar to that found for the\ncluster NGC1569-B by previous studies. Such super-solar [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios\nare also predicted by chemical evolution models that incorporate the bursty\nstar formation histories of these dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, our\n$\\alpha$-element abundances agree with abundance measurements from H II regions\nin both galaxies. In general we derive Fe-peak abundances similar to those\nobserved in the MW and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) for both young massive\nclusters. For these elements, however, we recommend higher-resolution\nobservations to improve the Fe-peak abundance measurements.\n", "  On small scales the observable Universe is highly inhomogeneous, with\ngalaxies and clusters forming a complex web of voids and filaments. The optical\nproperties of such configurations can be quite different from the perfectly\nsmooth Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) solutions that are\nfrequently used in cosmology, and must be well understood if we are to make\nprecise inferences about fundamental physics from cosmological observations. We\ninvestigate this problem by calculating redshifts and luminosity distances\nwithin a class of cosmological models that are constructed explicitly in order\nto allow for large density contrasts on small scales. Our study of optics is\nthen achieved by propagating one hundred thousand null geodesics through such\nspace-times, with matter arranged in either compact opaque objects or diffuse\ntransparent haloes. We find that in the absence of opaque objects, the mean of\nour ray tracing results faithfully reproduces the expectations from FLRW\ncosmology. When opaque objects with sizes similar to those of galactic bulges\nare introduced, however, we find that the mean of distance measures can be\nshifted up from FLRW predictions by as much as $10\\%$. This bias is due to the\nviable photon trajectories being restricted by the presence of the opaque\nobjects, which means that they cannot probe the regions of space-time with the\nhighest curvature. It corresponds to a positive bias of order $10\\%$ in the\nestimation of $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ and highlights the important consequences that\nastronomical selection effects can have on cosmological observables.\n", "  We study the effects of spatial dispersion in disordered noncentrosymmetric\nmetals. These include the kinetic magnetoelectric effect, natural optical\nactivity of metals, as well as the so-called dynamic chiral magnetic effect as\na particular case of the latter. These effects are determined by the linear in\nthe wave vector of an electromagnetic perturbation contribution to the\nconductivity tensor of a material, and stem from the magnetic moments of\nquasiparticles near the Fermi surface. We identify new disorder-induced\ncontributions to these magnetic moments that come from the skew scattering and\nside jump processes, familiar from the theory of anomalous Hall effect. We show\nthat at low frequencies the spatial dispersion of the conductivity tensor comes\nmainly either from the skew scattering or intrinsic contribution, and there is\nalways a region of frequencies in which the intrinsic mechanism dominates. Our\nresults imply that in clean three-dimensional metals, current-induced\nmagnetization is in general determined by impurity skew scattering, rather than\nintrinsic contributions. Intrinsic effects are expected to dominate in cubic\nenantiomorphic crystals with point groups $T$ and $O$, and in polycrystalline\nsamples, regardless of their mobility.\n", "  Using Maxwell-Bloch equations it has been shown how the superradiance can\nlead to amplification and gain at a frequency much larger than the pumping\nfrequency. This remarkable effect has been examined in terms of a simpler model\ninvolving two coupled oscillators with one of them paramet- rically driven. We\nshow that this coupled oscillator model has a hidden parity-time (PT) symmetry\nfor QASER, we thus bring PT symmetry to the realm of parametrically coupled\nresonators. More- over, we find that the QASER gain arises from the broken PT\nsymmetry phase. We then quantize the simplified version of the QASER using\nquantum Langevin equations. The quantum description enables us to understand\nhow the system starts from quantum fluctuations.\n", "  In this work, we demonstrate the use of frequency-tunable superconducting\nNbTiN coplanar waveguide microresonators for multi-frequency pulsed electron\nspin resonance (ESR) experiments. By applying a bias current to the center pin,\nthe resonance frequency ($\\sim$7.6 GHz) can be continuously tuned by as much as\n95 MHz in 270 ns without a change in the quality factor of 3000 at 2K. We\ndemonstrate the ESR performance of our resonators by measuring donor spin\nensembles in silicon and show that adiabatic pulses can be used to overcome\nmagnetic field inhomogeneities and microwave power limitations due to the\napplied bias current. We take advantage of the rapid tunability of these\nresonators to manipulate both phosphorus and arsenic spins in a single pulse\nsequence, demonstrating pulsed double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Our\nNbTiN resonator design is useful for multi-frequency pulsed ESR and should also\nhave applications in experiments where spin ensembles are used as quantum\nmemories.\n", "  We study the stability of pentaquarks within a schematic model based on SU(3)\ncolor symmetry, by taking into account algebraic arguments leading to a\nchromoelectric interaction containing two- and three-body parts. It has already\nbeen proven that such an interaction can influence the spectrum of ordinary\nbaryons and the stability of tetraquarks and hexaquarks.\n", "  The {\\eta} Carinae binary system hosts the most massive stars with the\nhighest known mass-loss rate. Its dense wind encounters the faster wind\nexpelled by the companion, dissipating mechanical energy in the shock,\naccelerating particles up to relativistic energies and producing high-energy\n(HE) {\\gamma}-rays. We used the first 7-year data of the Fermi LAT which span\ntwo passages of {\\eta} Carinae at periastron. We extracted low and HE light\ncurves and spectra in different orbital phase bins using the new PASS8\npipeline. We used particle acceleration in hydrodynamic simulations of the\nsystem in a multi-cell geometry and compared the prediction with the\nobservations. The {\\gamma}-ray emission location is compatible with {\\eta}\nCarinae. Two emission components are distinguished. The low-energy (LE) one\ncuts off below 10 GeV and its flux, modulated by the orbital motion, varies by\na factor < 2. Short-term variability occurs at periastron. The HE component\nflux varies by a factor 3-4 but differently during the two periastrons. The\nvariabilities observed at LE and HE during the first half of the observations,\nmatch the prediction of the simulation, assuming a surface magnetic field of\n500 G. The HE component and the thermal X-ray emission were weaker than\nexpected around the second periastron suggesting a modification of the wind\ndensity in the inner wind collision region (WCR). Diffuse shock acceleration in\nthe WCR provides a convincing match to the observations and new diagnostic\ntools to probe the geometry and energetics of the system. Further observations\nare required to explain the periastron-to-periastron HE variability and to\nassociate it firmly with hadronic origin. {\\eta} Carinae is a pevatron at\nperiastron. Its $\\nu$ flux can be detected by IceCube after many years of\nobservations. Orbital modulations of the HE component can be distinguished from\nthose of photo absorption by CTA.\n", "  We show that the property of existence of solution to the Strominger system\nin dimension six is neither open nor closed under holomorphic deformations of\nthe complex structure. These results are obtained both in the case of positive\nslope parameter as well as in the case of negative slope parameter in the\nanomaly cancellation equation.\n", "  We present single-dish CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations for 14 low-redshift\nquasi-stellar objects (QSOs). In combination with optical integral field\nspectroscopy we study how the cold gas content relates to the star formation\nrate (SFR) and black hole accretion rate. CO(1-0) is detected in 8 of 14\ntargets and CO(2-1) is detected in 7 out of 11 cases. The majority of\ndisc-dominated QSOs reveal gas fractions and depletion times well matching\nnormal star forming systems. Two gas-rich major mergers show clear starburst\nsignatures with higher than average gas fractions and shorter depletion times.\nBulge-dominated QSO hosts are mainly undetected in CO(1-0) which corresponds,\non average, to lower gas fractions than in disc-dominated counterparts. Their\nSFRs however imply shorter than average depletion times and higher star\nformation efficiencies. Negative QSO feedback through removal of cold gas seems\nto play a negligible role in our sample. We find a trend between black hole\naccretion rate and total molecular gas content for disc-dominated QSOs when\ncombined with literature samples. We interpret this as an upper envelope for\nnuclear activity which is well represented by a scaling relation between the\ntotal and circum-nuclear gas reservoir accessible for accretion.\nBulge-dominated QSOs significantly differ from that scaling relation and appear\nuncorrelated with the total molecular gas content. This could be explained\neither by a more compact gas reservoir, blow out of the gas envelope through\noutflows, or a different ISM phase composition.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic behavior of finite-size systems close to a\nfirst-order transition (FOT). We develop a dynamic finite-size scaling (DFSS)\ntheory for the dynamic behavior in the coexistence region where different\nphases coexist. It is characterized by an exponentially large time scale\nrelated to the tunneling between the two phases. We show that, when considering\ntime scales of the order of the tunneling time, the dynamic behavior can be\ndescribed by a two-state coarse-grained dynamics. This allows us to obtain\nexact predictions for the dynamical scaling functions. To test the general DFSS\ntheory at FOTs, we consider the two-dimensional Ising model in the\nlow-temperature phase, where the external magnetic field drives a FOT, and the\n20-state Potts model, which undergoes a thermal FOT. Numerical results for a\npurely relaxational dynamics fully confirm the general theory.\n", "  We present the results of a {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} ACS/HRC FUV, ACS/WFC\noptical study into the cluster populations of a sample of 22 Luminous Infrared\nGalaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey. Through integrated\nbroadband photometry we have derived ages and masses for a total of 484 star\nclusters contained within these systems. This allows us to examine the\nproperties of star clusters found in the extreme environments of LIRGs relative\nto lower luminosity star-forming galaxies in the local Universe. We find that\nby adopting a Bruzual \\& Charlot simple stellar population (SSP) model and\nSalpeter initial mass function, the age distribution of clusters declines as\n$dN/d\\tau = \\tau^{-0.9 +/- 0.3}$, consistent with the age distribution derived\nfor the Antennae Galaxies, and interpreted as evidence for rapid cluster\ndisruption occuring in the strong tidal fields of merging galaxies. The large\nnumber of $10^{6} M_{\\odot}$ young clusters identified in the sample also\nsuggests that LIRGs are capable of producing more high-mass clusters than what\nis observed to date in any lower luminosity star-forming galaxy in the local\nUniverse. The observed cluster mass distribution of $dN/dM = M^{-1.95 +/-\n0.11}$ is consistent with the canonical -2 power law used to describe the\nunderlying initial cluster mass function (ICMF) for a wide range of galactic\nenvironments. We interpret this as evidence against mass-dependent cluster\ndisruption, which would flatten the observed CMF relative to the underlying\nICMF distribution.\n", "  We explore the evolution of the internal gas kinematics of star-forming\ngalaxies from the peak of cosmic star-formation at $z\\sim2$ to today.\nMeasurements of galaxy rotation velocity $V_{rot}$, which quantify ordered\nmotions, and gas velocity dispersion $\\sigma_g$, which quantify disordered\nmotions, are adopted from the DEEP2 and SIGMA surveys. This sample covers a\ncontinuous baseline in redshift from $z=2.5$ to $z=0.1$, spanning 10 Gyrs. At\nlow redshift, nearly all sufficiently massive star-forming galaxies are\nrotationally supported ($V_{rot}>\\sigma_g$). By $z=2$, the percentage of\ngalaxies with rotational support has declined to 50$\\%$ at low stellar mass\n($10^{9}-10^{10}\\,M_{\\odot}$) and 70$\\%$ at high stellar mass\n($10^{10}-10^{11}M_{\\odot}$). For $V_{rot}\\,>\\,3\\,\\sigma_g$, the percentage\ndrops below 35$\\%$ for all masses. From $z\\,=\\,2$ to now, galaxies exhibit\nremarkably smooth kinematic evolution on average. All galaxies tend towards\nrotational support with time, and it is reached earlier in higher mass systems.\nThis is mostly due to an average decline in $\\sigma_g$ by a factor of 3 since a\nredshift of 2, which is independent of mass. Over the same time period,\n$V_{rot}$ increases by a factor of 1.5 for low mass systems, but does not\nevolve for high mass systems. These trends in $V_{rot}$ and $\\sigma_g$ with\ntime are at a fixed stellar mass and should not be interpreted as evolutionary\ntracks for galaxy populations. When galaxy populations are linked in time with\nabundance matching, not only does $\\sigma_g$ decline with time as before, but\n$V_{rot}$ strongly increases with time for all galaxy masses. This enhances the\nevolution in $V_{rot}/\\sigma_g$. These results indicate that $z\\,=\\,2$ is a\nperiod of disk assembly, during which the strong rotational support present in\ntoday's massive disk galaxies is only just beginning to emerge.\n", "  In this paper we investigate effects of the $r$-mode instability on a newborn\nrapidly-rotating magnetar with fall-back accretion. Such a magnetar could\nusually occur in core-collapse supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. We find that\nthe magnetar's spin and $r$-mode evolution are influenced by accretion. If the\nmagnetar is sufficiently spun up to a few milliseconds, gravitational radiation\nleads to the growth of the $r$-mode amplitude significantly. The maximum\n$r$-mode amplitude reaches an order $\\sim 0.001$ when the damping due to the\ngrowth of a toroidal magnetic field balances the growth of the $r$-mode\namplitude. If such a sufficiently spun-up magnetar was located at a distance\nless than 1\\,Mpc, then gravitational waves would be detectable by the Einstein\nTelescope but would have an extremely low event rate. However, if the spin-up\nis insufficient, the growth of the $r$-mode amplitude is mainly due to the\naccretion torque. In this case, the maximum $r$-mode amplitude is of the order\nof $\\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$.\n", "  Post starburst E+A galaxies are thought to have experienced a significant\nstarburst that was quenched abruptly. Their disturbed, bulge-dominated\nmorphologies suggest that they are merger remnants. We present ESI/Keck\nobservations of SDSS J132401.63+454620.6, a post starburst galaxy at redshift z\n= 0.125, with a starburst that started 400 Myr ago, and other properties, like\nstar formation rate (SFR) consistent with what is measured in ultra luminous\ninfrared galaxies (ULRIGs). The galaxy shows both zero velocity narrow lines,\nand blueshifted broader Balmer and forbidden emission lines (FWHM=1350 +- 240\nkm/s). The narrow component is consistent with LINER-like emission, and the\nbroader component with Seyfert-like emission, both photoionized by an active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) whose properties we measure and model. The velocity\ndispersion of the broad component exceeds the escape velocity, and we estimate\nthe mass outflow rate to be in the range 4-120 Mo/yr. This is the first\nreported case of AGN-driven outflows, traced by ionized gas, in post starburst\nE+A galaxies. We show, by ways of a simple model, that the observed AGN-driven\nwinds can consistently evolve a ULIRG into the observed galaxy. Our findings\nreinforce the evolutionary scenario where the more massive ULIRGs are quenched\nby negative AGN feedback, evolve first to post starburst galaxies, and later\nbecome typical red and dead ellipticals.\n", "  We present ALMA images of the dust and molecular line emission in the Orion\nHot Core at 349 GHz. At 0.2\" angular resolution the images reveal multiple\nclumps in an arc ~ 1\" east of Orion Source I, the protostar at the center of\nthe Kleinmann-Low Nebula, and another chain of peaks from IRc7 towards the\nsouthwest. The molecular line images show narrow filamentary structures at\nvelocities > 10 km/s away from the heavily resolved ambient cloud velocity ~5\nkm/s. Many of these filaments trace the SiO outflow from Source I, and lie\nalong the edges of the dust emission. Molecular line emission at excitation\ntemperatures 300--2000 K, and velocities > 10 km/s from the ambient cloud,\nsuggest that the Hot Core may be heated in shocks by the outflow from Source I\nor from the BN/Source I explosion. The spectral line observations also reveal a\nremarkable molecular ring, ~ 2\" south of Source I, with a diameter ~ 600 AU.\nThe ring is seen in high excitation transitions of HC3N, HCN v2=1, and SO2. An\nimpact of ejecta from the BN/Source I explosion with a dense dust clump could\nresult in the observed ring of shocked material.\n", "  We explore the impact of dimensionality on the scattering of a small bosonic\nensemble in an elongated harmonic trap off a centered repulsive barrier,\nthereby taking particle correlations into account. The loss of coherence as\nwell as the oscillation of the center of mass are studied and we analyze the\ninfluence of both particle and spatial correlations. Two different mechanisms\nof coherence losses in dependence of the aspect ratio are found. For small\naspect ratios, loss of coherence between the region close to the barrier and\nouter regions occurs, due to spatial correlations, and for large aspect ratios,\nincoherence between the two density fragments of the left and right side of the\nbarrier arises, due to particle correlations. Apart form the decay of the\ncenter of mass motion induced by the reflection and transmission, further\neffects due to the particle and spatial correlations are explored. For tight\ntransversal traps, the amplitude of the center of mass oscillation experiences\na weaker damping, which can be traced back to the population of a second\nnatural orbital, and for a weaker transversal confinement, we detect a strong\ndecay, due to the possibility of transferring energy to transversal excited\nmodes. These effects are enhanced if the aspect ratio is integer valued.\n", "  We investigate the axion inflation model derived by poly-instanton effects in\ntype II superstring theories. Poly-instanton effects are instanton effects\ncorrected by another instanton and it can generate the modulus-axion potential\nwith the double exponential function. Although the axion has a period of small\nvalue, this potential can have a flat region because its derivatives are\nexponentially suppressed by non-perturbative effects. From the view point of\nthe cosmic inflation, such potential is interesting. In this paper, we\nnumerically study the possibilities for realizing the cosmic inflation. We also\nstudy their spectral index and other cosmological observables, numerically.\n", "  Over the next decade, improvements in cosmological parameter constraints will\nbe driven by surveys of large-scale structure. Its inherent non-linearity\nsuggests that significant information will be embedded in higher correlations\nbeyond the two-point function. Extracting this information is extremely\nchallenging: it requires accurate theoretical modelling and significant\ncomputational resources to estimate the covariance matrix describing\ncorrelations between different Fourier configurations. We investigate whether\nit is possible to reduce the covariance matrix without significant loss of\ninformation by using a proxy that aggregates the bispectrum over a subset of\nFourier configurations. Specifically, we study the constraints on $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters from combining the power spectrum with (a) the modal bispectrum\ndecomposition, (b) the line correlation function and (c) the integrated\nbispectrum. We forecast the error bars achievable on $\\Lambda$CDM parameters\nusing these proxies in a future galaxy survey and compare them to those\nobtained from measurements of the Fourier bispectrum, including simple\nestimates of their degradation in the presence of shot noise. Our results\ndemonstrate that the modal bispectrum performs as well as the Fourier\nbispectrum, even with considerably fewer modes than Fourier configurations. The\nline correlation function has good performance but does not match the modal\nbispectrum. The integrated bispectrum is comparatively insensitive to changes\nin the background cosmology. We find that adding bispectrum data can improve\nconstraints on bias parameters and the normalization $\\sigma_8$ by up to 5\ncompared to power spectrum measurements alone. For other parameters,\nimprovements of up to $\\sim$ 20% are possible. Finally, we use a range of\ntheoretical models to explore how the sophistication required for realistic\npredictions varies with each proxy. (abridged)\n", "  The construction of the cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR) has been\nwidely studied. However, its consistency with various new observables remains a\ntopic of interest. We present a new way to constrain the CDDR $\\eta(z)$ using\ndifferent dynamic and geometric properties of strong gravitational lenses (SGL)\nalong with SNe Ia observations. We use a sample of $102$ SGL with the\nmeasurement of corresponding velocity dispersion $\\sigma_0$ and Einstein radius\n$\\theta_E$. In addition, we also use a dataset of $12$ two image lensing\nsystems containing the measure of time delay $\\Delta t$ between source images.\nJointly these two datasets give us the angular diameter distance $D_{A_{ol}}$\nof the lens. Further, for luminosity distance, we use the $740$ observations\nfrom JLA compilation of SNe Ia. To study the combined behavior of these\ndatasets we use a model independent method, Gaussian Process (GP). We also\ncheck the efficiency of GP by applying it on simulated datasets, which are\ngenerated in a phenomenological way by using realistic cosmological error bars.\nFinally, we conclude that the combined bounds from the SGL and SNe Ia\nobservation do not favor any deviation of CDDR and are in concordance with the\nstandard value ($\\eta=1$) within $2\\sigma$ confidence region, which further\nstrengthens the theoretical acceptance of CDDR.\n", "  Recently a generic model has been proposed for the single-particle properties\nof gapless superconductors with simultaneously present pair-conserving and\npair-breaking impurity scattering (the so-called Dynes superconductors). Here\nwe calculate the optical conductivity of the Dynes superconductors. Our\napproach is applicable for all disorder strengths from the clean up to the\ndirty limit and for all relative ratios of the two types of scattering,\nnevertheless the complexity of our description is equivalent to that of the\nwidely used Mattis-Bardeen theory. We identify two optical fingerprints of the\nDynes superconductors: (i) the presence of two absorption edges and (ii) a\nfinite absorption at vanishing frequencies even at the lowest temperatures. We\ndemonstrate that the recent anomalous optical data on thin MoN films can be\nreasonably fitted by our theory.\n", "  The time-evolution of matter fields in black hole exterior spacetimes is a\nwell-studied subject, spanning several decades of research. However, the\nbehavior of fields in the black hole interior spacetime, has only relatively\nrecently begun receiving some attention from the research community. In this\npaper, we numerically study the late-time evolution of scalar fields in both\nSchwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, including the black hole interior. We\nrecover the expected late-time power-law \"tails\" on the exterior (null\ninfinity, time-like infinity and the horizon). In the interior region, we find\nan interesting oscillatory behavior that is characterized by the multipole\nindex $\\ell$ of the scalar field. In addition, we also study the extremal Kerr\ncase and find strong indications of an instability developing at the horizon.\n", "  The ground state of BaFe12O19 (BFO) is controversial as three different\nquantum states, namely quantum paraelectric, frustrated antiferroelectric and\nquantum electric dipole liquid (QEDL), have been proposed. We have investigated\nthe quantum critical behavior of BFO as a function of chemical pressure (a\nnon-thermal variable) generated by smaller isovalent ion Ca2+ at the Ba2+ site.\nAnalysis of synchrotron x-ray diffraction data confirms that Ca2+ substitution\ngenerates positive chemical pressure. Our dielectric measurements reveal that\nCa2+ substitution drives BFO away from its quantum critical point (QCP) and\nstabilizes a quantum electric dipolar glass state whose dielectric peak\ntemperature (Tc) increases with increasing Ca2+ content as Tc ~ (x-xc)1/2, a\ncanonical signature of quantum phase transitions. Our dielectric measurements\nreveal that pure BFO is slightly away from its QCP with a Tc of 2.91 K.\nSpecific heat measurements reveal excess specific heat of non-Debye and\nnon-magnetic origin with linear temperature dependence below Tc which could be\ndue to QEDL state of BFO.\n", "  Although time-dependent random media with short range correlations lead to\n(possibly biased) normal tracer diffusion, anomalous fluctuations occur away\nfrom the most probable direction. This was pointed out recently in 1D lattice\nrandom walks, where statistics related to the 1D Kardar- Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality class, i.e. the GUE Tracy Widom distribution, were shown to arise.\nHere we provide a simple picture for this correspondence, directly in the\ncontinuum as well as for lattice models, which allows to study arbitrary space\ndimension and to predict a variety of universal distributions. In $d = 1$ we\npredict and verify numerically the emergence of the GOE Tracy-Widom\ndistribution for the fluctuations of the transition probability. In $d = 3$ we\npredict a phase transition from Gaussian fluctuations to 3D-KPZ type\nfluctuations as the bias is increased. We predict KPZ universal distributions\nfor the arrival time of a first particle from a cloud diffusing in such media.\n", "  We report the discovery of a binary composed of two brown dwarfs, based on\nthe analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2016-BLG-1469. Thanks to detection\nof both finite-source and microlens-parallax effects, we are able to measure\nboth the masses $M_1\\sim 0.05\\ M_\\odot$, $M_2\\sim 0.01\\ M_\\odot$, and distance\n$D_{\\rm L} \\sim 4.5$ kpc, as well as the projected separation $a_\\perp \\sim\n0.33$ au. This is the third brown-dwarf binary detected using the microlensing\nmethod, demonstrating the usefulness of microlensing in detecting field\nbrown-dwarf binaries with separations less than 1 au.\n", "  Spiral arms are the most singular features in disc galaxies. These structures\ncan exhibit different patterns, namely grand design and flocculent arms, with\neasily distinguishable characteristics. However, their origin and the\nmechanisms shaping them are unclear. The overall role of spirals in the\nchemical evolution of disc galaxies is another unsolved question. In\nparticular, it has not been fully explored if the \\hii\\,regions of spiral arms\npresent different properties from those located in the interarm regions. Here\nwe analyse the radial oxygen abundance gradient of the arm and interarm star\nforming regions of 63 face-on spiral galaxies using CALIFA Integral Field\nSpectroscopy data. We focus the analysis on three characteristic parameters of\nthe profile: slope, zero-point, and scatter. The sample is morphologically\nseparated into flocculent versus grand design spirals and barred versus\nunbarred galaxies. We find subtle but statistically significant differences\nbetween the arm and interarm distributions for flocculent galaxies, suggesting\nthat the mechanisms generating the spiral structure in these galaxies may be\ndifferent to those producing grand design systems, for which no significant\ndifferences are found. We also find small differences in barred galaxies, not\nobserved in unbarred systems, hinting that bars may affect the chemical\ndistribution of these galaxies but not strongly enough as to be reflected in\nthe overall abundance distribution. In light of these results, we propose bars\nand flocculent structure as two distinct mechanisms inducing differences in the\nabundance distribution between arm and interarm star forming regions.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo population synthesis study of white dwarf-main\nsequence (WD+MS) binaries in the Galactic disk aimed at reproducing the\nensemble properties of the entire population observed by the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) Data Release 12. Our simulations take into account all known\nobservational biases and use the most up-to-date stellar evolutionary models.\nThis allows us to perform a sound comparison between the simulations and the\nobservational data. We find that the properties of the simulated and observed\nparameter distributions agree best when assuming low values of the common\nenvelope efficiency (0.2-0.3), a result that is in agreement with previous\nfindings obtained by observational and population synthesis studies of close\nSDSS WD+MS binaries. We also show that all synthetic populations that result\nfrom adopting an initial mass ratio distribution with a positive slope are\nexcluded by observations. Finally, we confirm that the properties of the\nsimulated WD+MS binary populations are nearly independent of the age adopted\nfor the thin disk, on the contribution of WD+MS binaries from the thick disk\n(0-17 per cent of the total population) and on the assumed fraction of the\ninternal energy that is used to eject the envelope during the common envelope\nphase (0.1-0.5).\n", "  A brief Chandra observation of the ultraluminous quasar, SDSS\nJ010013.02+280225.8 at redshift 6.326, showed it to be a relatively bright,\nsoft X-ray source with a count rate of about 1 ct/ks. In this paper we present\nresults for the quasar from a 65ks XMM-Newton observation, which well\nconstrains its spectral shape. The quasar is clearly detected with a total of\n$\\sim$ 460 net counts in the 0.2-10 keV band. The spectrum is characterised by\na simple power-law model with photon index of $\\Gamma = 2.30^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$,\nand the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is $3.14\\times10^{45}$ erg\n$\\text{s}^{-1}$. The 1 $\\sigma$ upper limit to any intrinsic absorption column\ndensity is $N_{H} = 6.07\\times 10^{22} {\\text{cm}}^{-2}$. No significant iron\nemission lines were detected. We derive the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio\n$\\alpha_{\\text{ox}}$ of $-1.74\\pm$0.01, consistent with the values found in\nother quasars of comparable ultraviolet luminosity. We did not detect\nsignificant flux variations either in the XMM-Newton exposure or between\nXMM-Newton and XMM-Newton observations, which are separated by $\\sim$ 8 months.\nThe X-ray observation enables the bolometric luminosity to be calculated after\nmodelling the spectral energy distribution: the accretion rate is found to be\nsub-Eddington.\n", "  The gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary black hole (BBH) with masses\nbetween 10^4 and 10^7 Msun can be detected with the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) once their orbital frequency exceeds 10^-4 - 10^-5 Hz. The\nbinary separation at this stage is approximately a=100 R_g (gravitational\nradius), and the orbital speed is of order v/c=0.1. We argue that at this\nstage, the binary will be producing bright electromagnetic (EM) radiation via\ngas bound to the individual BHs. Both BHs will have their own photospheres in\nX-ray and possibly also in optical bands. Relativistic Doppler modulations and\nlensing effects will inevitably imprint periodic variability in the EM\nlight-curve, tracking the phase of the orbital motion, and serving as a\ntemplate for the GW inspiral waveform. Advanced localization of the source by\nLISA weeks to months prior to merger will enable a measurement of this EM chirp\nby wide-field X-ray or optical instruments. A comparison of the phases of the\nGW and EM chirp signals will help break degeneracies between system parameters,\nand probe a fractional difference difference Delta v in the propagation speed\nof photons and gravitons as low as Delta v/c = O(10^-17).\n", "  The performance of optical fiber systems based on nonlinear\nfrequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) or on more conventional transmission\ntechniques is compared through numerical simulations. Some critical issues\naffecting NFDM systems-namely, the strict requirements needed to avoid burst\ninteraction due to signal dispersion and the unfavorable dependence of\nperformance on burst length-are investigated, highlighting their potentially\ndisruptive effect in terms of spectral efficiency. Two digital processing\ntechniques are finally proposed to halve the guard time between NFDM symbol\nbursts and reduce the size of the processing window at the receiver, increasing\nspectral efficiency and reducing computational complexity.\n", "  We compute the four-loop contributions to the photon quark and Higgs quark\nform factors involving two closed fermion loops. We present analytical results\nfor all non-planar master integrals of the two non-planar integral families\nwhich enter our calculation.\n", "  We have measured the probability distribution function (PDF) of cosmic matter\ndensity field from a suite of N-body simulations. We propose the generalized\nnormal distribution of version 2 (Nv2) as an alternative fitting formula to the\nwell-known log-normal distribution. We find that Nv2 provides significantly\nbetter fit than the log-normal distribution for all smoothing radii (2, 5, 10,\n25 [Mpc/h]) that we studied. The improvement is substantial in the underdense\nregions. The development of non- Gaissianities in the cosmic matter density\nfield is captured by continuous evolution of the skewness and shifts parameters\nof the Nv2 distribution. We present the redshift evolution of these parameters\nfor aforementioned smoothing radii and various background cosmology models. All\nthe PDFs measured from large and high-resolution N-body simulations that we use\nin this study can be obtained from a Web site at\nhttps://astro.kias.re.kr/jhshin.\n", "  Observations of supernova remnants (SNRs) are a powerful tool for\ninvestigating the later stages of stellar evolution, the properties of the\nambient interstellar medium, and the physics of particle acceleration and\nshocks. For a fraction of SNRs, multi-wavelength coverage from radio to ultra\nhigh-energies has been provided, constraining their contributions to the\nproduction of Galactic cosmic rays. Although radio emission is the most common\nidentifier of SNRs and a prime probe for refining models, high-resolution\nimages at frequencies above 5 GHz are surprisingly lacking, even for bright and\nwell-known SNRs such as IC443 and W44. In the frameworks of the Astronomical\nValidation and Early Science Program with the 64-m single-dish Sardinia Radio\nTelescope, we provided, for the first time, single-dish deep imaging at 7 GHz\nof the IC443 and W44 complexes coupled with spatially-resolved spectra in the\n1.5-7 GHz frequency range. Our images were obtained through on-the-fly mapping\ntechniques, providing antenna beam oversampling and resulting in accurate\ncontinuum flux density measurements. The integrated flux densities associated\nwith IC443 are S_1.5GHz = 134 +/- 4 Jy and S_7GHz = 67 +/- 3 Jy. For W44, we\nmeasured total flux densities of S_1.5GHz = 214 +/- 6 Jy and S_7GHz = 94 +/- 4\nJy. Spectral index maps provide evidence of a wide physical parameter scatter\namong different SNR regions: a flat spectrum is observed from the brightest SNR\nregions at the shock, while steeper spectral indices (up to 0.7) are observed\nin fainter cooling regions, disentangling in this way different populations and\nspectra of radio/gamma-ray-emitting electrons in these SNRs.\n", "  We analytically derive the expressions for the structure of the inner region\nof protoplanetary disks based on the results from the recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations. The inner part of a disk can be divided into four regions:\ndust-free region with gas temperature in the optically thin limit, optically\nthin dust halo, optically thick condensation front and the classical optically\nthick region in order from the inside. We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio\nprofile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation\nregulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust\nhalo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available\nsilicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is\ndetermined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal\nto the characteristic temperature $\\sim 1200{\\,\\rm K}$. We derive the mid-plane\ntemperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation with the\nadditional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a\nresult, the overall temperature profile is step-like with steep gradients at\nthe borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet\ntraps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction\nwith the gas disk stops. The temperature at the border between the two\noutermost regions coincides with the temperature needed to activate\nmagnetorotational instability, suggesting that the inner edge of the dead zone\nmust lie at this border. The radius of the dead-zone inner edge predicted from\nour solution is $\\sim$ 2-3 times larger than that expected from the classical\noptically thick temperature.\n", "  We analyzed the star HD 171219, one of the relatively bright Be stars\nobserved in the seismo field of the CoRoT satellite, in order to determine its\nphysical and pulsation characteristics. Classical Be stars are main-sequence\nobjects of mainly B-type, whose spectra show, or had shown at some epoch,\nBalmer lines in emission and an infrared excess. Both characteristics are\nattributed to an equatorially concentrated circumstellar disk fed by\nnon-periodic mass-loss episodes (outbursts). Be stars often show nonradial\npulsation gravity modes and, as more recently discovered, stochastically\nexcited oscillations. Applying the CLEANEST algorithm to the high-cadence and\nhighly photometrically precise measurements of the HD 171219 light curve led us\nto perform an unprecedented detailed analysis of its nonradial pulsations. Tens\nof frequencies have been detected in the object compatible with nonradial\ng-modes. Additional high-resolution ground-based spectroscopic observations\nwere obtained at La Silla (HARPS) and Haute Provence (SOPHIE) observatories\nduring the month preceding CoRoT observations. Additional information was\nobtained from low-resolution spectra from the BeSS database. From spectral line\nfitting we determined physical parameters of the star, which is seen\nequator-on. We also found in the ground data the same frequencies as in CoRoT\ndata. Additionally, we analyzed the circumstellar activity through the\ntraditional method of V/R emission H{\\alpha} line variation. A quintuplet was\nidentified at approximately 1.113 c/d (12.88 {\\mu}Hz) with a separation of\n0.017 c/d that can be attributed to a pulsation degree l~2. The light curve\nshows six small- to medium-scale outbursts during the CoRoT observations. The\nintensity of the main frequencies varies after each outburst, suggesting a\npossible correlation between the nonradial pulsations regime and the feeding of\nthe envelope.\n", "  We used archival International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) high-dispersion,\nshort wavelength spectra data to search for evidence of the spectra of hot\nsubdwarf companions of six rapidly rotating Be stars in binary systems. We\nsearched for the signature of a hot companion through an analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions of observed and model spectra that were separated\ninto primary and secondary components using a Doppler tomography algorithm and\nadopted spectroscopic orbital solutions. A positive detection of the flux from\na hot companion was made for the reconstructed secondary cross-correlation\nfunction of just one target, 60 Cygni (B1 Ve). We estimate that the companion\nof the Be star in 60 Cygni has $T_{\\rm eff} = 42 \\pm 4$ kK, mass ratio $M_2/M_1\n= 0.15 \\pm 0.02$, and monochromatic flux ratio ${f_2}/{f_1} = 0.034 \\pm 0.002$\nin the spectral region near 1525 \\AA. If the companions of the other target Be\nstars are also hot, then they must be faint and contribute less than $\\approx\n1\\%$ of the UV flux ($<0.6 \\%$ in the case of $\\gamma$ Cas). We also discuss in\nan appendix a shell episode of Pleione (28 Tau) recorded in the IUE spectra.\n", "  We aim to use statistical analysis of a large number of various galaxies to\nprobe, model, and understand relations between different galaxy properties and\nmagnetic fields. We have compiled a sample of 55 galaxies including low-mass\ndwarf and Magellanic-types, normal spirals and several massive starbursts, and\napplied principal component analysis (PCA) and regression methods to assess the\nimpact of various galaxy properties on the observed magnetic fields. According\nto PCA the global galaxy parameters (like HI, H2, and dynamical mass, star\nformation rate (SFR), near-infrared luminosity, size, and rotational velocity)\nare all mutually correlated and can be reduced to a single principal component.\nFurther PCA performed for global and intensive (not size related) properties of\ngalaxies (such as gas density, and surface density of the star formation rate,\nSSFR), indicates that magnetic field strength B is connected mainly to the\nintensive parameters, while the global parameters have only weak relationships\nwith B. We find that the tightest relationship of B is with SSFR, which is\ndescribed by a power-law with an index of 0.33+-0.03. The observed weaker\nassociations of B with galaxy dynamical mass and the rotational velocity we\ninterpret as indirect ones, resulting from the observed connection of the\nglobal SFR with the available total H2 mass in galaxies. Using our sample we\nconstructed a diagram of B across the Hubble sequence which reveals that high\nvalues of B are not restricted by the Hubble type. However, weaker fields\nappear exclusively in later Hubble types and B as low as about 5muG is not seen\namong typical spirals. The processes of generation of magnetic field in the\ndwarf and Magellanic-type galaxies are similar to those in the massive spirals\nand starbursts and are mainly coupled to local star-formation activity\ninvolving the small-scale dynamo mechanism.\n", "  We present the evolution of the Cosmic Spectral Energy Distribution (CSED)\nfrom $z = 1 - 0$. Our CSEDs originate from stacking individual spectral energy\ndistribution fits based on panchromatic photometry from the Galaxy and Mass\nAssembly (GAMA) and COSMOS datasets in ten redshift intervals with completeness\ncorrections applied. Below $z = 0.45$, we have credible SED fits from 100 nm to\n1 mm. Due to the relatively low sensitivity of the far-infrared data, our\nfar-infrared CSEDs contain a mix of predicted and measured fluxes above $z =\n0.45$. Our results include appropriate errors to highlight the impact of these\ncorrections. We show that the bolometric energy output of the Universe has\ndeclined by a factor of roughly four -- from $5.1 \\pm 1.0$ at $z \\sim 1$ to\n$1.3 \\pm 0.3 \\times 10^{35}~h_{70}$~W~Mpc$^{-3}$ at the current epoch. We show\nthat this decrease is robust to cosmic variance, SED modelling and other\nvarious types of error. Our CSEDs are also consistent with an increase in the\nmean age of stellar populations. We also show that dust attenuation has\ndecreased over the same period, with the photon escape fraction at 150~nm\nincreasing from $16 \\pm 3$ at $z \\sim 1$ to $24 \\pm 5$ per cent at the current\nepoch, equivalent to a decrease in $A_\\mathrm{FUV}$ of 0.4~mag. Our CSEDs\naccount for $68 \\pm 12$ and $61 \\pm 13$ per cent of the cosmic optical and\ninfrared backgrounds respectively as defined from integrated galaxy counts and\nare consistent with previous estimates of the cosmic infrared background with\nredshift.\n", "  The superconducting transition of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ with three distinct\nsulphur concentrations $x$ was studied under hydrostatic pressure up to\n$\\sim$70 kbar via bulk AC susceptibility. The pressure dependence of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) features a small dome-shaped\nvariation at low pressures for $x=0.04$ and $x=0.12$, followed by a more\nsubstantial $T_c$ enhancement to a value of around 30 K at moderate pressures.\nIn $x=0.21$, a similar overall pressure dependence of $T_c$ is observed, except\nthat the small dome at low pressures is flattened. For all three\nconcentrations, a significant weakening of the diamagnetic shielding is\nobserved beyond the pressure around which the maximum $T_c$ of 30 K is reached\nnear the verge of pressure-induced magnetic phase. This observation points to a\nstrong competition between the magnetic and high-$T_c$ superconducting states\nat high pressure in this system.\n", "  Experiment and theory indicate that UPt3 is a topological superconductor in\nan odd-parity state, based in part from temperature independence of the NMR\nKnight shift. However, quasiparticle spin-flip scattering near a surface, where\nthe Knight shift is measured, might be responsible. We use polarized neutron\nscattering to measure the bulk susceptibility with H||c, finding consistency\nwith the Knight shift but inconsistent with theory for this field orientation.\nWe infer that neither spin susceptibility nor Knight shift are a reliable\nindication of odd-parity.\n", "  We carry out magnetohydrodynamical simulations with FLASH of the formation of\na single, a tight binary ($a\\sim$2.5 AU) and a wide binary star ($a\\sim$45 AU).\nWe study the outflows and jets from these systems to understand the\ncontributions the circumstellar and circumbinary discs have on the efficiency\nand morphology of the outflow. In the single star and tight binary case we\nobtain a single pair of jets launched from the system, while in the wide binary\ncase two pairs of jets are observed. This implies that in the tight binary case\nthe contribution of the circumbinary disc on the outflow is greater than that\nin the wide binary case. We also find that the single star case is the most\nefficient at transporting mass, linear and angular momentum from the system,\nwhile the wide binary case is less efficient ($\\sim$50$\\%, \\sim$33$\\%,\n\\sim$42$\\%$ of the respective quantities in the single star case). The tight\nbinary's efficiency falls between the other two cases ($\\sim$71$\\%, \\sim$66$\\%,\n\\sim$87$\\%$ of the respective quantities in the single star case). By studying\nthe magnetic field structure we deduce that the outflows in the single star and\ntight binary star case are magnetocentrifugally driven, whereas in the wide\nbinary star case the outflows are driven by a magnetic pressure gradient.\n", "  In this article, we derive and compute the sensitivity of measurements of\ncoupling between normal modes of oscillation in the Sun to underlying flows.\nThe theory is based on first-Born perturbation theory, and the analysis is\ncarried out using the formalism described by \\citet{lavely92}. Albeit tedious,\nwe detail the derivation and compute the sensitivity of specific pairs of\ncoupled normal modes to anomalies in the interior. Indeed, these kernels are\ncritical for the accurate inference of convective flow amplitudes and\nlarge-scale circulations in the solar interior. We resolve some inconsistencies\nin the derivation of \\citet{lavely92} and reformulate the fluid-continuity\ncondition. We also derive and compute sound-speed kernels, paving the way for\ninverting for thermal anomalies alongside flows.\n", "  We have observed the Vela pulsar for one year using a Phased Array Feed (PAF)\nreceiver on the 12-metre antenna of the Parkes Test-Bed Facility. These\nobservations have allowed us to investigate the stability of the PAF\nbeam-weights over time, to demonstrate that pulsars can be timed over long\nperiods using PAF technology and to detect and study the most recent glitch\nevent that occurred on 12 December 2016. The beam-weights are shown to be\nstable to 1% on time scales on the order of three weeks. We discuss the\nimplications of this for monitoring pulsars using PAFs on single dish\ntelescopes.\n", "  During February 2016, CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science and the\nMax-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy installed, commissioned and carried\nout science observations with a phased array feed (PAF) receiver system on the\n64m diameter Parkes radio telescope. Here we demonstrate that the PAF can be\nused for pulsar observations and we highlight some unique capabilities. We\ndemonstrate that the pulse profiles obtained using the PAF can be calibrated\nand that multiple pulsars can be simultaneously observed. Significantly, we\nfind that an intrinsic polarisation leakage of -31dB can be achieved with a PAF\nbeam offset from the centre of the field of view. We discuss the possibilities\nfor using a PAF for future pulsar observations and for searching for fast radio\nbursts with the Parkes and Effelsberg telescopes.\n", "  Winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are commonly assumed to be\ndriven by radiative acceleration of dust grains. For M-type AGB stars, the\nnature of the wind-driving dust species has been a matter of intense debate. A\nproposed source of the radiation pressure triggering the outflows is photon\nscattering on Fe-free silicate grains. This wind-driving mechanism requires\ngrain radii of about 0.1 - 1 micron in order to make the dust particles\nefficient at scattering radiation around the stellar flux maximum. Grain size\nis therefore an important parameter for understanding the physics behind the\nwinds of M-type AGB stars. We seek to investigate the diagnostic potential of\nscattered polarized light for determining dust grain sizes. We have developed a\nnew tool for computing synthetic images of scattered light in dust and gas\nshells around AGB stars, which can be applied to detailed models of dynamical\natmospheres and dust-driven winds. We present maps of polarized light using\ndynamical models computed with the DARWIN code. The synthetic images clearly\nshow that the intensity of the polarized light, the position of the inner edge\nof the dust shell, and the size of the dust grains near the inner edge are all\nchanging with the luminosity phase. Non-spherical structures in the dust shells\ncan also have an impact on the polarized light. We simulate this effect by\ncombining different pulsation phases into a single 3D structure before\ncomputing synthetic images. An asymmetry of the circumstellar envelope can\ncreate a net polarization, which can be used as diagnostics for the grain size.\nThe ratio between the size of the scattering particles and the observed\nwavelength determines at what wavelengths net polarization switches direction.\nIf observed, this can be used to constrain average particle sizes.\n", "  The solar transition region satisfies the conditions for presence of\nnon-Maxwellian electron energy distributions with high-energy tails at energies\ncorresponding to the ionization potentials of many ions emitting in the EUV and\nUV portions of the spectrum. We calculate the synthetic Si IV, O IV, and S IV\nspectra in the far ultra-violet (FUV) channel of the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS). Ionization, recombination, and excitation rates are\nobtained by integration of the cross-sections or their approximations over the\nmodel electron distributions considering particle propagation from the hotter\ncorona. The ionization rates are significantly affected by the presence of\nhigh-energy tails. This leads to the peaks of the relative abundance of\nindividual ions to be broadened with pronounced low-temperature shoulders. As a\nresult, the contribution functions of individual lines observable by IRIS also\nexhibit low-temperature shoulders, or their peaks are shifted to temperatures\nan order of magnitude lower than for the Maxwellian distribution. The\nintegrated emergent spectra can show enhancements of Si IV compared toO IV by\nmore than a factor of two. The high-energy particles can have significant\nimpact on the emergent spectra and their presence needs to be considered even\nin situations without strong local acceleration.\n", "  We used Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) in the Integral Field Unit\nmode to map the stellar population, emission line flux distributions and gas\nkinematics in the inner kpc of NGC 5044. From the stellar populations synthesis\nwe found that the continuum emission is dominated by old high metallicity stars\n($\\sim$13 Gyr, 2.5Z$\\odot$). Also, its nuclear emission is diluted by a non\nthermal emission, which we attribute to the presence of a weak active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). In addition, we report for the first time a broad component\n(FWHM$\\sim$ 3000km$s^{-1}$) in the H$\\alpha$ emission line in the nuclear\nregion of NGC 5044. By using emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams we found\nthat two dominant ionization processes coexist, while the nuclear region (inner\n200 pc) is ionized by a low luminosity AGN, the filamentary structures are\nconsistent with being excited by shocks. The H$\\alpha$ velocity field shows\nevidence of a rotating disk, which has a velocity amplitude of\n$\\sim$240kms$^{-1}$ at $\\sim$ 136 pc from the nucleus. Assuming a Keplerian\napproach we estimated that the mass inside this radius is $1.9\\times10^9$\n$M_{\\odot}$, which is in agreement with the value obtained through the\nM-$\\sigma$ relation, $ M_{SMBH}=1.8\\pm1.6\\times10^{9}M_{\\odot}$. Modelling the\nionized gas velocity field by a rotating disk component plus inflows towards\nthe nucleus along filamentary structures, we obtain a mass inflow rate of\n$\\sim$0.4 M$_\\odot$. This inflow rate is enough to power the central AGN in NGC\n5044.\n", "  We examine in detail 15 Babylonian observations of lunar appulses and\noccultations made between 80 and 419 BC for the purpose of setting useful\nlimits on Earth's clock error, as quantified by $\\Delta$T, the difference\nbetween Terrestrial Time and Universal time. Our results are generally in\nagreement with reconstructions of $\\Delta$T using untimed solar eclipse\nobservations from the same period. We suggest a revised version of the simple\nquadratic fit to $\\Delta$T in light of the new results.\n", "  We theoretically study the oscillatory dynamics of a vortex core in a\nferrimagnetic disk near its angular momentum compensation point, where the spin\ndensity vanishes but the magnetization is finite. Due to the finite\nmagnetostatic energy, a ferrimagnetic disk of suitable geometry can support a\nvortex as a ground state similar to a ferromagnetic disk. In the vicinity of\nthe angular momentum compensation point, the dynamics of the vortex resemble\nthose of an antiferromagnetic vortex, which is described by equations of motion\nanalogous to Newton's second law for the motion of particles. Owing to the\nantiferromagnetic nature of the dynamics, the vortex oscillation frequency can\nbe an order of magnitude larger than the frequency of a ferromagnetic vortex,\namounting to tens of GHz in common transition-metal based alloys. We show that\nthe frequency can be controlled either by applying an external field or by\nchanging the temperature. In particular, the latter property allows us to\ndetect the angular momentum compensation temperature, at which the lowest\neigenfrequency attains its maximum, by performing FMR measurements on the\nvortex disk. Our work proposes a ferrimagnetic vortex disk as a tunable source\nof fast magnetic oscillations and a useful platform to study the properties of\nferrimagnets.\n", "  A hard three-loop correction to parapositronium energy levels of order\n$m\\alpha^7$ is calculated. This nonlogarithmic contribution is due to the\ninsertions of one-loop photon propagator in the fermion lines in the diagrams\nwith virtual two-photon annihilation. We obtained $\\Delta\nE=0.03297(2)(m\\alpha^7/\\pi^3)$ for this energy shift.\n", "  The ground state of the diatomic molecules in nature is inevitably bonding,\nand its first excited state is antibonding. We demonstrate theoretically that,\nfor a pair of distant adatoms placed buried in three-dimensional-Dirac\nsemimetals, this natural order of the states can be reversed and an antibonding\nground state occurs at the lowest energy of the so-called bound states in the\ncontinuum. We propose an experimental protocol with the use of a scanning\ntunneling microscope tip to visualize the topographic map of the local density\nof states on the surface of the system to reveal the emerging physics.\n", "  We present analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations in the 3-79 keV energy band\nof the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, taken in 2013. The broadband sensitivity of\nNuSTAR, covering the Fe K$\\alpha$ line and Compton reflection hump, enables\ntight constraints to be placed on reflection features in AGN X-ray spectra,\nthereby providing insight into the geometry of the circumnuclear material. In\nthis observation, we found the X-ray spectrum of NGC 4388 to be well described\nby a moderately absorbed power law with non-relativistic reflection. We fit the\nspectrum with phenomenological reflection models and a physical torus model,\nand find the source to be absorbed by Compton-thin material (N$_{H} =\n(6.5\\pm0.8)\\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) with a very weak Compton reflection hump\n(R $<$ 0.09) and an exceptionally large Fe K$\\alpha$ line (EW $=\n368^{+56}_{-53}$ eV) for a source with weak or no reflection. Calculations\nusing a thin-shell approximation for the expected Fe K$\\alpha$ EW indicate that\nan Fe K$\\alpha$ line originating from Compton-thin material presents a possible\nexplanation.\n", "  Numerical simulations have become a necessary tool to describe the complex\ninteractions among the different processes involved in galaxy formation and\nevolution, unfeasible via an analytic approach. The last decade has seen a\ngreat effort by the scientific community in improving the sub-grid physics\nmodelling and the numerical techniques used to make numerical simulations more\npredictive. Although the recently publicly available code GIZMO has proven to\nbe successful in reproducing galaxy properties when coupled with the model of\nthe MUFASA simulations and the more sophisticated prescriptions of the Feedback\nIn Realistic Environments (FIRE) set-up, it has not been tested yet using\ndelayed cooling supernova feedback, which still represent a reasonable approach\nfor large cosmological simulations, for which detailed sub-grid models are\nprohibitive. In order to limit the computational cost and to be able to resolve\nthe disc structure in the galaxies we perform a suite of zoom-in cosmological\nsimulations with rather low resolution centred around a sub-L* galaxy with a\nhalo mass of $3\\times 10^{11}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$ at $z=0$, to investigate the\nability of this simple model, coupled with the new hydrodynamic method of\nGIZMO, to reproduce observed galaxy scaling relations (stellar to halo mass,\nstellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher, stellar mass-metallicity and mass-size). We\nfind that the results are in good agreement with the main scaling relations,\nexcept for the total stellar mass, larger than that predicted by the abundance\nmatching technique, and the effective sizes for the most massive galaxies in\nthe sample, which are too small.\n", "  LSI +61 303 is one of the few X-ray binaries with a Be star companion from\nwhich radio, X-rays and high-energy gamma-ray (GeV and TeV) emission have been\nobserved. The nature of the high energy activity of the system is not yet fully\nunderstood, but it is widely believed that it is generated due to the\ninteraction of the relativistic electrons leaving the compact object with the\nphotons and non-relativistic wind of the Be star. The superorbital variability\nof the system has been observed in the radio, optical and X-ray domains and\ncould be due to the cyclic change of the Be star disk size. In this paper we\nsystematically review all publicly available data from Suzaku, XMM-Newton,\nChandra and Swift observatories in order to measure the absorption profile of\nthe circumstellar Be disk as a function of orbital and superorbital phases. We\nalso discuss short-term variability of the system, found during the analysis\nand its implications for the understanding of the physical processes in this\nsystem.\n", "  We report our recent Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton X-ray and Lijiang optical\nobservations on PSR J2032+4127/MT91 213, the gamma-ray binary candidate with a\nperiod of 45-50 years. The coming periastron of the system was predicted to be\nin November 2017, around which high-energy flares from keV to TeV are expected.\nRecent studies with Chandra and Swift X-ray observations taken in 2015/16\nshowed that its X-ray emission has been brighter by a factors of ~10 than that\nbefore 2013, probably revealing some on-going activities between the pulsar\nwind and the stellar wind. Our new Swift/XRT lightcurve shows no strong\nevidence of a single vigorous brightening trend, but rather several strong\nX-ray flares on weekly to monthly timescales with a slowly brightening\nbaseline, namely the low state. The NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations taken\nduring the flaring and the low states, respectively, show a denser environment\nand a softer power-law index during the flaring state, implying that the pulsar\nwind interacted with stronger stellar winds of the companion to produce the\nflares. These precursors would be crucial in studying the predicted giant\noutburst from this extreme gamma-ray binary during the periastron passage in\nlate 2017.\n", "  We have observed the protoplanetary disk of the well-known young Herbig star\nHD 142527 using ZIMPOL Polarimetric Differential Imaging with the VBB (Very\nBroad Band, ~600-900nm) filter. We obtained two datasets in May 2015 and March\n2016. Our data allow us to explore dust scattering around the star down to a\nradius of ~0.025\" (~4au). The well-known outer disk is clearly detected, at\nhigher resolution than before, and shows previously unknown sub-structures,\nincluding spirals going inwards into the cavity. Close to the star, dust\nscattering is detected at high signal-to-noise ratio, but it is unclear whether\nthe signal represents the inner disk, which has been linked to the two\nprominent local minima in the scattering of the outer disk, interpreted as\nshadows. An interpretation of an inclined inner disk combined with a dust halo\nis compatible with both our and previous observations, but other arrangements\nof the dust cannot be ruled out. Dust scattering is also present within the\nlarge gap between ~30 and ~140au. The comparison of the two datasets suggests\nrapid evolution of the inner regions of the disk, potentially driven by the\ninteraction with the close-in M-dwarf companion, around which no polarimetric\nsignal is detected.\n", "  We present the detection of 89 low surface brightness (LSB), and thus low\nstellar density galaxy candidates in the Perseus cluster core, of the kind\nnamed \"ultra-diffuse galaxies\", with mean effective V-band surface brightnesses\n24.8-27.1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, total V-band magnitudes -11.8 to -15.5 mag, and\nhalf-light radii 0.7-4.1 kpc. The candidates have been identified in a deep\nmosaic covering 0.3 square degrees, based on wide-field imaging data obtained\nwith the William Herschel Telescope. We find that the LSB galaxy population is\ndepleted in the cluster centre and only very few LSB candidates have half-light\nradii larger than 3 kpc. This appears consistent with an estimate of their\ntidal radius, which does not reach beyond the stellar extent even if we assume\na high dark matter content (M/L=100). In fact, three of our candidates seem to\nbe associated with tidal streams, which points to their current disruption.\nGiven that published data on faint LSB candidates in the Coma cluster - with\nits comparable central density to Perseus - show the same dearth of large\nobjects in the core region, we conclude that these cannot survive the strong\ntides in the centres of massive clusters.\n", "  We explore physical properties of the shocked external medium (i.e., a shell)\nin 3C 84 associated with the recurrent radio lobe born around 1960. In the\nprevious work of Ito et al., we investigated a dynamical and radiative\nevolution of such a shell after the central engine stops the jet launching and\nwe found that a fossil shell emission overwhelms that of the rapidly fading\nradio lobe. We apply this model to 3C 84 and find the followings: (i) The\nfossil shell made of shocked diffuse ambient matter with the number density of\n0.3 cm$^{-3}$ radiates bright Inverse-Compton (IC) emission with the seed\nphotons of the radio emission from the central compact region and the IC\nemission is above the sensitivity threshold of the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA). (ii) When the fossil shell is produced in a geometrically thick ionized\nplasma with the number density of $10^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ and the field strength in\nthe shell may reach about 17 mG in the presence of magnetic fields\namplification and the radio emission becomes comparable to the sensitivity of\ndeep imaging VLBI observations. A possible production of ultra high energy\ncosmic-rays (UHECRs) in the dense shocked plasma is also argued.\n", "  In its first four years of operation, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\ndetected 3033 $\\gamma$-ray emitting sources. In the Fermi-LAT Third Source\nCatalogue (3FGL) about 50% of the sources have no clear association with a\nlikely $\\gamma$-ray emitter. We use an artificial neural network algorithm\naimed at distinguishing BL Lacs from FSRQs to investigate the source subclass\nof 559 3FGL unassociated sources characterised by $\\gamma$-ray properties very\nsimilar to those of Active Galactic Nuclei. Based on our method, we can\nclassify 271 objects as BL Lac candidates, 185 as FSRQ candidates, leaving only\n103 without a clear classification. we suggest a new zoo for $\\gamma$-ray\nobjects, where the percentage of sources of uncertain type drops from 52% to\nless than 10%. The result of this study opens up new considerations on the\npopulation of the $\\gamma$-ray sky, and it will facilitate the planning of\nsignificant samples for rigorous analyses and multiwavelength observational\ncampaigns.\n", "  We characterize the K I D1 & D2 lines in order to determine whether they\ncould complement the 850 nm window, containing the Ca II infrared triplet lines\nand several Zeeman sensitive photospheric lines, that was studied previously.\nWe investigate the effect of partial redistribution on the intensity profiles,\ntheir sensitivity to changes in different atmospheric parameters, and the\nspatial distribution of Zeeman polarization signals employing a realistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation. The results show that these lines form in the\nupper photosphere at around 500 km and that they are sensitive to the line of\nsight velocity and magnetic field strength at heights where neither the\nphotospheric lines nor the Ca II infrared lines are. However, at the same time,\nwe found that their sensitivity to the temperature essentially comes from the\nphotosphere. Then, we conclude that the K I lines provide a complement to the\nlines in the 850 nm window for the determination of atmospheric parameters in\nthe upper photosphere, especially for the line of sight velocity and the\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We present a study of the consequences of an initial mass function that is\nstochastically sampled on the main emission lines used for gas-phase\nmetallicity estimates in extra-galactic sources. We use the stochastic stellar\npopulation code SLUG and the photoionisation code Cloudy to show that the\nstochastic sampling of the massive end of the mass function can lead to clear\nvariations in the relative production of energetic emission lines such as\n[OIII] relative to that of Balmer lines. We use this to study the impact on the\nTe, N2O2, R23 and O3N2 metallicity calibrators. We find that stochastic\nsampling of the IMF leads to a systematic over-estimate of O/H in galaxies with\nlow star formation rates (< $10^{-3}$ M$_\\odot$/yr) when using the N2O2, R23\nand O3N2 strong-line methods, and an under-estimate when using the Te method on\ngalaxies of sub-solar metallicity. We point out that while the\nSFR(Ha)-to-SFR(UV) ratio can be used to identify systems where the initial mass\nfunction might be insufficiently sampled, it does not provide sufficient\ninformation to fully correct the metallicity calibrations at low star formation\nrates. Care must therefore be given in the choice of metallicity indicators in\nsuch systems, with the N2O2 indicator proving most robust of those tested by\nus, with a bias of 0.08 dex for models with SFR = $10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$/yr and\nsolar metallicity.\n", "  The deep connection between galaxies and their supermassive black holes is\ncentral to modern astrophysics and cosmology. The observed correlation between\ngalaxy and black hole mass is usually attributed to the contribution of major\nmergers to both. We make use of a sample of galaxies whose disk-dominated\nmorphologies indicate a major-merger-free history and show that such systems\nare capable of growing supermassive black holes at rates similar to quasars.\nComparing black hole masses to conservative upper limits on bulge masses, we\nshow that the black holes in the sample are typically larger than expected if\nprocesses creating bulges are also the primary driver of black hole growth. The\nsame relation between black hole and total stellar mass of the galaxy is found\nfor the merger-free sample as for a sample which has experienced substantial\nmergers, indicating that major mergers do not play a significant role in\ncontrolling the coevolution of galaxies and black holes. We suggest that more\nfundamental processes which contribute to galaxy assembly are also responsible\nfor black hole growth.\n", "  We present here parameter distributions and fundamental scaling relations for\n190 galaxies as part of the Spectroscopy and H-bang Imaging of Virgo cluster\ngalaxies (SHIVir) survey. We find the distribution of galaxy velocities to be\nbimodal about $V_{\\rm circ} \\sim 125$ km ${\\rm s^{-1}}$, hinting at the\nexistence of dynamically unstable modes in the inner regions of galaxies. An\nanalysis of the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) of late-type galaxies (LTGs) and\nfundamental plane (FP) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) is also presented,\nyielding a compendium of galaxy scaling relations. The slope and zero-point of\nthe Virgo TFR match those of field galaxies, while scatter differences likely\nreflect distinct evolutionary histories. The velocities minimizing scatter for\nthe TFR and FP are measured at large apertures where the baryonic fraction\nbecomes subdominant. While TFR residuals remain independent of any galaxy\nparameters, FP residuals (i.e. the FP \"tilt\") correlate strongly with the\ndynamical-to-stellar mass ratio, yielding stringent galaxy formation\nconstraints. Furthermore, we construct a stellar-to-total mass relation (STMR)\nfor ETGs and LTGs and find linear but distinct trends over the range $M_{*} =\n10^{8-11} M_{\\odot}$. Stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs), which probe the\nextended dark matter halo, can be scaled down to masses estimated within the\noptical radius, showing a tight match with the Virgo STMR at low masses;\nhowever, possibly inadequate halo abundance matching prescriptions and broad\nradial scalings complicate this comparison at all masses. While ETGs appear to\nbe more compact than LTGs of the same stellar mass in projected space, their\nmass-size relations in physical space are identical. The trends reported here\ncall for validation through well-resolved numerical simulations.\n", "  The age distributions of stellar cluster populations have long been proposed\nto probe the recent formation history of the host galaxy. However, progress is\nhampered by the limited understanding of cluster disruption by evaporation and\ntidal shocks. We study the age distributions of clusters in smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies, which include a\nself-consistent, physical model for the formation and dynamical evolution of\nthe cluster population and account for the variation of cluster disruption in\ntime and space. We show that the downward slope of the cluster age distribution\ndue to disruption cannot be reproduced with a single functional form, because\nthe disruption rate exhibits systematic trends with cluster age (the `cruel\ncradle effect'). This problem is resolved by using the median cluster age to\ntrace cluster disruption. Across 120 independent galaxy snapshots and simulated\ncluster populations, we perform two-dimensional power law fits of the median\ncluster age to various macroscopic physical quantities and find that it scales\nas $t_{\\rm med}\\propto \\Sigma^{-0.51\\pm0.03}\\sigma_{\\rm\n1D}^{-0.85\\pm0.10}M_{\\rm min}^\\gamma$, for the gas surface density $\\Sigma$,\ngas velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm 1D}$, and minimum cluster mass $M_{\\rm\nmin}$. This scaling accurately describes observed cluster populations and\nindicates disruption by impulsive tidal shocks from the interstellar medium.\nThe term $M_{\\rm min}^\\gamma$ provides a model-independent way to measure the\nmass dependence of the cluster disruption time $\\gamma$. Finally, the\nensemble-average cluster lifetime depends on the gas density less strongly than\nthe instantaneous disruption time of single clusters. These results reflect the\nvariation of cluster disruption in time and space. We provide quantitative ways\nof accounting for these physics in cluster population studies.\n", "  At $z=1-3$, the formation of new stars is dominated by dusty galaxies whose\nfar-IR emission indicates they contain colder dust than local galaxies of a\nsimilar luminosity. We explore the reasons for the evolving IR emission of\nsimilar galaxies over cosmic time using: 1) Local galaxies from GOALS $(L_{\\rm\nIR}=10^{11}-10^{12}\\,L_\\odot)$; 2) Galaxies at $z\\sim0.1-0.5$ from the 5MUSES\n($L_{\\rm IR}=10^{10}-10^{12}\\,L_\\odot$); 3) IR luminous galaxies spanning\n$z=0.5-3$ from GOODS and Spitzer xFLS ($L_{\\rm IR}>10^{11}\\,L_\\odot$). All\nsamples have Spitzer mid-IR spectra, and Herschel and ground-based\nsubmillimeter imaging covering the full IR spectral energy distribution,\nallowing us to robustly measure $L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}$,\n$T_{\\rm dust}$, and $M_{\\rm dust}$ for every galaxy. Despite similar infrared\nluminosities, $z>0.5$ dusty star forming galaxies have a factor of 5 higher\ndust masses and 5K colder temperatures. The increase in dust mass is linked\nwith an increase in the gas fractions with redshift, and we do not observe a\nsimilar increase in stellar mass or star formation efficiency.\n$L_{160}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}/L_{70}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}$, a proxy\nfor $T_{\\rm dust}$, is strongly correlated with $L_{\\rm\nIR}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\\rm dust}$ independently of redshift. We\nmeasure merger classification and galaxy size for a subsample, and there is no\nobvious correlation between these parameters and $L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm\n\\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\\rm dust}$ or $L_{160}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle\nSF}/L_{70}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}$. In dusty star forming galaxies, the\nchange in $L_{\\rm IR}^{\\rm\\scriptscriptstyle SF}/M_{\\rm dust}$ can fully\naccount for the observed colder dust temperatures, suggesting that any change\nin the spatial extent of the interstellar medium is a second order effect.\n", "  Due to the nature depending on only the gravitational field, microlensing, in\nprinciple, provides an important tool to detect faint and even dark brown\ndwarfs. However, the number of identified brown dwarfs is limited due to the\ndifficulty of the lens mass measurement that is needed to check the substellar\nnature of the lensing object. In this work, we report a microlensing brown\ndwarf discovered from the analysis of the gravitational binary-lens event\nOGLE-2014-BLG-1112. We identify the brown-dwarf nature of the lens companion by\nmeasuring the lens mass from the detections of both microlens-parallax and\nfinite-source effects. We find that the companion has a mass of $(3.03 \\pm\n0.78)\\times 10^{-2}\\ M_\\odot$ and it is orbiting a solar-type primary star with\na mass of $1.07 \\pm 0.28\\ M_\\odot$. The estimated projected separation between\nthe lens components is $9.63 \\pm 1.33$ au and the distance to the lens is $4.84\n\\pm 0.67$ kpc. We discuss the usefulness of space-based microlensing\nobservations in detecting brown dwarfs through the channel of binary-lens\nevents.\n", "  We have performed a search for planetary-mass brown dwarfs in the Chamaeleon\nI star-forming region using proper motions and photometry measured from optical\nand infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Hubble Space\nTelescope, and ground-based facilities. Through near-infrared spectroscopy at\nGemini Observatory, we have confirmed six of the candidates as new late-type\nmembers of Chamaeleon I >M7.75. One of these objects, Cha J11110675-7636030,\nhas the faintest extinction-corrected M_K among known members, which\ncorresponds to a mass of 3-6 M_Jup according to evolutionary models. That\nobject and two other new members have redder mid-IR colors than young\nphotospheres at <M9.5, which may indicate the presence of disks. However, since\nthose objects may be later than M9.5 and the mid-IR colors of young\nphotospheres are ill-defined at those types, we cannot determine conclusively\nwhether color excesses from disks are present. If Cha J11110675-7636030 does\nhave a disk, it would be a contender for the least-massive known brown dwarf\nwith a disk. Since the new brown dwarfs that we have found extend below our\ncompleteness limit of 6-10 M_Jup, deeper observations are needed to measure the\nminimum mass of the initial mass function in Chamaeleon I.\n", "  During five decades astronomers have been puzzled by the presence of strong\nabsorption features including metal lines, observed in the optical and\nultraviolet spectra of quasars, signalling in- and outflowing gas winds with\nrelative velocities up to several thousands of km/sec. In particular the\nlocation of these winds - close to the quasar, further out in its host galaxy,\nor in its direct environment - and the possible impact on their surroundings\nhave been issues of intense discussion and uncertainty. Using our Herschel\nSpace Observatory data, we report a tendency for this so-called associated\nmetal absorption to occur along with prodigious star formation in the quasar\nhost galaxy, indicating that the two phenomena are likely to be interrelated,\nthat the gas winds likely occur on the kiloparsec scale and would then have a\nstrong impact on the interstellar medium of the galaxy. This correlation\nmoreover would imply that the unusually high cold dust luminosities in these\nquasars are connected with ongoing star formation. Given that we find no\ncorrelation with the AGN strength, the wind feedback which we establish in\nthese radio-loud objects is most likely associated with their host star\nformation rather than with their black hole accretion.\n", "  We present first results of a novel technique that provides, for the first\ntime, constraints on the energy input flux at the coronal base\n($r\\sim\\,1.025\\,{\\rm R}_\\odot$) of the quiet-Sun at a global scale. By\ncombining differential emission measure tomography (DEMT) of EUV images, with\nglobal models of the coronal magnetic field, we estimate the energy input flux\nat the coronal base that is required to maintain thermodynamically stable\nstructures. The technique is described in detail and first applied to data\nprovided by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) instrument, on board the\nSolar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission, and the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly (AIA) instrument, on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) mission, for two solar rotations with different levels of activity. Our\nanalysis indicates that the typical energy input flux at the coronal base of\nmagnetic loops in the quiet-Sun is in the range $\\sim\\,0.5-2.0\\times 10^5\\,{\\rm\n(erg\\,sec^{-1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2})}$, depending on the structure size and level of\nactivity. A large fraction of this energy input, or even its totality, could be\naccounted for by Alfv\\'en waves, as shown by recent independent observational\nestimates derived from determinations of the non-thermal broadening of spectral\nlines in the coronal base of quiet-Sun regions. This new tomography product\nwill be useful for validation of coronal heating models in magnetohydrodinamic\nsimulations of the global corona.\n", "  We present a SOFIA FORCAST grism spectroscopic survey to examine the\nmineralogy of the circumstellar dust in a sample of post-asymptotic giant\nbranch yellow supergiants that are believed to be the precursors of planetary\nnebulae. Our mineralogical model of each star indicates the presence of both\ncarbon rich and oxygen rich dust species-contrary to simple dredge-up\nmodels-with a majority of the dust in the form of amorphous carbon and\ngraphite. The oxygen rich dust is primarily in the form of amorphous silicates.\nThe spectra do not exhibit any prominent crystalline silicate emission\nfeatures. For most of the systems, our analysis suggests that the grains are\nrelatively large and have undergone significant processing, supporting the\nhypothesis that the dust is confined to a Keplerian disk and that we are\nviewing the heavily processed, central regions of the disk from a nearly\nface-on orientation. These results help to determine the physical properties of\nthe post-AGB circumstellar environment and to constrain models of post-AGB mass\nloss and planetary nebula formation.\n", "  We present 114 trigonometric parallaxes for 107 nearby white dwarf (WD)\nsystems from both the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Parallax\nInvestigation (CTIOPI) and the U. S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS)\nparallax programs. Of these, 76 parallaxes for 69 systems were measured by the\nCTIOPI program and 38 parallaxes for as many systems were measured by the NOFS\nprogram. A total of 50 systems are confirmed to be within the 25 pc horizon of\ninterest. Coupled with a spectroscopic confirmation of a common proper motion\ncompanion to a Hipparcos star within 25 pc as well as confirmation parallax\ndeterminations for two WD systems included in the recently released Tycho Gaia\nAstrometric Solution (TGAS) catalog, we add 53 new systems to the 25 pc WD\nsample $-$ a 42% increase. Our sample presented here includes four strong\ncandidate halo systems, a new metal-rich DAZ WD, a confirmation of a recently\ndiscovered nearby short-period (P = 2.85 hr) double degenerate, a WD with a new\nastrometric pertubation (long period, unconstrained with our data), and a new\ntriple system where the WD companion main-sequence star has an astrometric\nperturbation (P $\\sim$ 1.6 yr).\n", "  We study theoretically the concept of homogenization in optics using an\nensemble of randomly distributed resonant stationary atoms with density $\\rho$.\nThe ensemble is dense enough for the usual condition for homogenization, viz.\n$\\rho\\lambda^3 \\gg 1$, to be reached. Introducing the coherent and incoherent\nscattered powers, we define two criteria to define the homogenization regime.\nWe find that when the excitation field is tuned in a broad frequency range\naround the resonance, none of the criteria for homogenization is fulfilled,\nmeaning that the condition $\\rho\\lambda^3\\gg 1$ is not sufficient to\ncharacterize the homogenized regime around the atomic resonance. We interpret\nthese results as a consequence of the light-induced dipole-dipole interactions\nbetween the atoms, which implies a description of scattering in terms of\ncollective modes rather than as a sequence of individual scattering events.\nFinally, we show that, although homogenization can never be reached for a dense\nensemble of randomly positioned laser-cooled atoms around resonance, it becomes\npossible if one introduces spatial correlations in the positions of the atoms\nor non-radiative losses, such as would be the case for organic molecules or\nquantum dots coupled to a phonon bath.\n", "  The form factors of the rare $\\Lambda_b\\to n l^+l^-$ decays are calculated in\nthe framework of the relativistic quark-diquark picture of baryons with the\nconsistent account of the relativistic effects. Their momentum transfer squared\ndependence is determined explicitly in the whole accessible kinematical range.\nThe decay branching fractions, forward-backward asymmetries and the fractions\nof longitudinally polarized dileptons are determined. The branching fraction of\nthe rare $\\Lambda_b\\to n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decay are found to be ${\\rm\nBr}(\\Lambda_b\\to n\\mu^+\\mu^-)=(3.75\\pm0.38)\\times10^{-8}$ and thus could be\nmeasured at the LHC. Prediction for the branching fraction of the rare\nradiative $\\Lambda_b\\to n \\gamma$ decay is also given.\n", "  We describe how meteors recorded at the Earth can be used to partly\nreconstruct the meteoroid environments of the planets if a large sample (i.e.\nmillions of orbits at a minimum) is available. The process involves selecting\nfrom the Earth-based sample those meteors which passed near a planet's orbit\nprior to arriving at the Earth, and so carry information about the planetary\nmeteoroid environment. Indeed this process can be extended to any location in\nthe Solar System, though some regions of space are better sampled than others.\n  From such a reconstruction performed with data from the Canadian Meteor Orbit\nRadar (CMOR), we reveal that Mars has apex, helion, anti-helion and toroidal\nsporadic sources, much as Earth does. Such reconstructions, albeit partial,\nhave the potential to provide a wealth of detail about planetary meteoroid\nenvironments, and to allow for the ground-truthing of model meteoroid\npopulations without in situ sampling.\n", "  The frequent misunderstanding of information entropy is pointed out. It is\nshown that, contrary to fortuitous situations and common beliefs, there is no\ngeneral interrelation between the information entropy and the thermodynamical\nentropy. We point out that the change of information entropy during measurement\nis determined by the resolution of the measurement instrument and these changes\ndo not have a general and clear-cut interrelation with the change of thermal\nentropy. Moreover, these changes can be separated in space and time. We show\nclassical physical considerations and examples to support this conclusion.\nFinally, we show that information entropy can violate the Third Law of\nThermodynamics which is another indication of major differences from thermal\nentropy.\n", "  Truncated accretion disks are commonly invoked to explain the\nspectro-temporal variability from accreting black holes in both small systems,\ni.e. state transitions in galactic black hole binaries (GBHBs), and large\nsystems, i.e. low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). In the canonical\ntruncated disk model of moderately low accretion rate systems, gas in the inner\nregion of the accretion disk occupies a hot, radiatively inefficient phase,\nwhich leads to a geometrically thick disk, while the gas in the outer region\noccupies a cooler, radiatively efficient phase that resides in the standard\ngeometrically thin disk. Observationally, there is strong empirical evidence to\nsupport this phenomenological model, but a detailed understanding of the\ndynamics of truncated disks is lacking. We present a well-resolved viscous,\nhydrodynamic simulation that uses an ad hoc cooling prescription to drive a\nthermal instability and, hence, produce the first sustained truncated accretion\ndisk. With this simulation, we perform a study of the dynamics, angular\nmomentum transport, and energetics of a truncated disk. We find that time\nvariability introduced by the quasi-periodic transition of gas from efficient\ncooling to inefficient cooling impacts the evolution of the simulated disk. A\nconsequence of the thermal instability is that an outflow is launched from the\nhot/cold gas interface which drives large, sub-Keplerian convective cells in\nthe disk atmosphere. The convective cells introduce a viscous $\\theta-\\phi$\nstress that is less than the generic $r-\\phi$ viscous stress component, but\ngreatly influences the evolution of the disk. In the truncated disk, we find\nthat the bulk of the accreted gas is in the hot phase.\n", "  We explore the quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with multiple periods in hard\nX-ray (HXR) emission from Fermi/GBM during the impulsive phase of solar flare\n(SOL2014-09-10). The completely new observational result is that the shorter\nperiods appear at lower energies of the X-ray photons at the beginning and the\nlonger periods appear at higher energies at the end, with some intersection of\nthe periods at medium energies. We also find the shorter and then the longer\nperiods during the same phase of this flare. Using the wavelet power spectrum\nand fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum, we analyze the normalized rapidly\nvarying signal divided by its slowly varying signal, which is the smoothed\noriginal HXR flux. The periods of 27 s and 37 s are derived at lower energy\nchannels between 17:25 UT and 17:29 UT, i.e., 12.0-27.3 keV and 27.3-50.9 keV.\nThen the periods of 27 s, 46 s and 60 s are observed at medium-energy channel\nfrom 17:26 UT to 17:33 UT, such as 50.9-102.3 keV. And the period of 80 s is\ndetected at higher energy channel from 17:28 UT to 17:33 UT, such as\n102.3-296.4 keV.\n", "  Ground-based astronomical observations may be limited by telluric water vapor\nabsorption, which is highly variable in time and significantly complicates both\nspectroscopy and photometry in the near-infrared (NIR). To achieve the\nsensitivity required to detect Earth-sized exoplanets in the NIR, simultaneous\nmonitoring of precipitable water vapor (PWV) becomes necessary to mitigate the\nimpact of variable telluric lines on radial velocity measurements and transit\nlight curves. To address this issue, we present the Camera for the Automatic\nMonitoring of Atmospheric Lines (CAMAL), a stand-alone, inexpensive six-inch\naperture telescope dedicated to measuring PWV at the Fred Lawrence Whipple\nObservatory on Mount Hopkins. CAMAL utilizes three narrowband NIR filters to\ntrace the amount of atmospheric water vapor affecting simultaneous observations\nwith the MINiature Exoplanet Radial Velocity Array (MINERVA) and MINERVA-Red\ntelescopes. Here we present the current design of CAMAL, discuss our data\nanalysis methods, and show results from 11 nights of PWV measurements taken\nwith CAMAL. For seven nights of data, we have independent PWV measurements\nextracted from high-resolution stellar spectra taken with the Tillinghast\nReflector Echelle Spectrometer (TRES) also located on Mount Hopkins. We use the\nTRES spectra to calibrate the CAMAL absolute PWV scale. Comparisons between\nCAMAL and TRES PWV estimates show excellent agreement, matching to within 1 mm\nover a 10 mm range in PWV. Analysis of CAMAL's photometric precision propagates\nto PWV measurements precise to better than 0.5 mm in dry (PWV < 4 mm)\nconditions. We also find that CAMAL-derived PWVs are highly correlated with\nthose from a GPS-based water vapor monitor located approximately 90 km away at\nKitt Peak National Observatory, with a root mean square PWV difference of 0.8\nmm.\n", "  Genetic information is stored in a linear sequence of base-pairs; however,\nthermal fluctuations and complex DNA conformations such as folds and loops make\nit challenging to order genomic material for in vitro analysis. In this work,\nwe discover that rotation-induced macromolecular spooling of DNA around a\nrotating microwire can monotonically order genomic bases, overcoming this\nchallenge. We use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize\nlong DNA strands deforming and elongating in shear flow near a rotating\nmicrowire, in agreement with numerical simulations. While untethered DNA is\nobserved to elongate substantially, in agreement with our theory and numerical\nsimulations, strong extension of DNA becomes possible by introducing tethering.\nFor the case of tethered polymers, we show that increasing the rotation rate\ncan deterministically spool a substantial portion of the chain into a fully\nstretched, single-file conformation. When applied to DNA, the fraction of\ngenetic information sequentially ordered on the microwire surface will increase\nwith the contour length, despite the increased entropy. This ability to handle\nlong strands of DNA is in contrast to modern DNA sample preparation\ntechnologies for sequencing and mapping, which are typically restricted to\ncomparatively short strands resulting in challenges in reconstructing the\ngenome. Thus, in addition to discovering new rotation-induced macromolecular\ndynamics, this work inspires new approaches to handling genomic-length DNA\nstrands.\n", "  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in astrophysical\nenvironments, as revealed by their pronounced emission features at 3.3, 6.2,\n7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 $\\mu$m commonly ascribed to the C--H and C--C\nvibrational modes. Although these features have long been predicted to be\npolarized, previous searches for PAH polarization led to null or, at best,\ntentative detections. Here we report the definite detection of polarized PAH\nemission at 11.3 $\\mu$m in the nebula associated with the Herbig Be star MWC\n1080. We measure a polarization degree of 1.9$\\pm$0.2\\%, which is unexpectedly\nhigh compared to models. This poses a challenge in the current understanding of\nthe alignment of PAHs, which is required to polarize the PAH emission but\nthought to be substantially suppressed. PAH alignment with a magnetic field via\na resonance paramagnetic relaxation process may account for such a high level\nof polarization.\n", "  Due to the quick evolution of the solar chromosphere, its magnetic field\ncannot be inferred reliably without accounting for the temporal variations of\nits polarized light. This has been broadly overlooked in the modelling and\ninterpretation of the polarization due to technical problems (e.g., lack of\ntemporal resolution or of time-dependent MHD solar models) and/or because many\npolarization measurements can apparently be explained without dynamics. Here,\nwe show that the temporal evolution is critic for explaining the spectral-line\nscattering polarization because of its sensitivity to rapidly-varying physical\nquantities and the possibility of signal cancellations and attenuation during\nextended time integration. For studying the combined effect of time-varying\nmagnetic fields and kinematics, we solved the 1.5D NLTE problem of the second\nkind in time-dependent 3D R-MHD solar models and we synthesized the Hanle and\nZeeman polarization in forward scattering for the chromospheric {\\lambda}4227\nline. We find that the quiet-sun polarization amplitudes depend on the\nperiodicity and spectral coherence of the signal enhacements produced by\nkinematics, but that substantially larger linear polarization signals should\nexist all over the solar disk for short integration times. The spectral\nmorphology of the polarization is discussed as a combination of Hanle, Zeeman,\ndynamic effects and partial redistribution. We give physical references for\nobservations by degrading and characterizing our slit time-series in different\nspatio-temporal resolutions. The implications of our results for the\ninterpretation of the second solar spectrum and for the investigation of the\nsolar atmospheric heatings are discussed.\n", "  For a bipartite state with equal local dimension d, we prove that one can\nobtain work gain under Landauer's erasure process on one party in identically\nand independently distributed (iid) limit when the corresponding fully\nentangled fraction is larger than 1/d. By processing a given state to the\nmaximally mixed state, we give an approximation for the largest extractable\nwork with an error in the energy scale, which becomes negligible in the large\nsystem limit. As a step to link quantum thermodynamics and quantum nonlocality,\nwe also provide a simple picture to approximate the optimal work extraction and\nsuggest a potential thermodynamic interpretation of fully entangled fraction\nfor isotropic states.\n", "  The acoustic properties of a fish school have been modelled using a cloud of\nbubbles. Similar to how bubble clouds present a collective monopole mode, a\nfish school also shows a collective breathing mode in which the whole school\nresonates as a single body. Here, we conjecture that the underwater acoustic\nnoise of the ocean amplified by the multiple scattering of swim bladders in the\nfish school might produce attractive acoustic forces that are strong enough to\naccount for the schooling mechanism. Our model predicts the presence of\nattractive Bjerknes forces, as large as 30% of the fish weight for 20-metre\nlarge fish schools, and that the attractive force on every fish in the centre\nof the school is cancelled when the fish increase/decrease the volume/pressure\nof its gas bladder. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of\na purely mechanical force that might contribute to fish being bound to or\nreleased from the school. The study may lead to new areas of research in many\nscientific fields beyond the nearest-neighbour interaction mechanism\ncustomarily used, and it would help in our understanding of collective\nprocesses of systems in ecology, physics, chemistry, and biology.\n", "  Using a new type of oscillation map, made from the radio spectra by the\nwavelet technique, we study the 18 April 2014 M7.3 flare\n(SOL2014-04-18T13:03:00L245C017). We find a quasi-periodic character of this\nflare with periods in the range 65-115 seconds. At the very beginning of this\nflare, in connection with the drifting pulsation structure (plasmoid ejection)\nwe find the 65-115 s oscillation phase drifting slowly towards lower\nfrequencies, which indicates an upward propagating wave initiated at the start\nof the magnetic reconnection. In the drifting pulsation structure many periods\n(1-200 seconds) are found documenting multi-scale and multi-periodic processes.\nOn this drifting structure fiber bursts with a characteristic period of about\none second are superimposed, whose frequency drift is similar to that of the\ndrifting 65-115 s oscillation phase. We also check periods found in this flare\nby EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS)/Hinode and Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS) observations. We recognize the type III bursts (electron\nbeams) as proposed, but their time coincidence with the EIS and IRIS peaks is\nnot very good. This is probably due to the radio spectrum beeing a whole-disk\nrecord consisting of all bursts from any location while the EIS and IRIS peaks\nare emitted only from locations of slits in the EIS and IRIS observations.\n", "  The multi-phase-field approach is generalized to treat capillarity-driven\ndiffusion parallel to the surfaces and phase-boundaries, i.e. the boundaries\nbetween a condensed phase and its vapor and the boundaries between two or\nmultiple condensed phases. The effect of capillarity is modeled via\ncurvature-dependence of the chemical potential whose gradient gives rise to\ndiffusion. The model is used to study thermal grooving on the surface of a\npolycrystalline body. Decaying oscillations of the surface profile during\nthermal grooving, postulated by Hillert long ago but reported only in few\nstudies so far, are observed and discussed. Furthermore, annealing of\nmulti-nano-clusters on a deformable free surface is investigated using the\nproposed model. Results of these simulations suggest that the characteristic\ncrater-like structure with an elevated perimeter, observed in recent\nexperiments, is a transient non-equilibrium state during the annealing process.\n", "  Pre-stellar cores represent the initial conditions in the process of star and\nplanet formation, therefore it is important to study their physical and\nchemical structure. Because of their volatility, nitrogen-bearing molecules are\nkey to study the dense and cold gas present in pre-stellar cores. The NH_3\nrotational transition detected with Herschel-HIFI provides a unique combination\nof sensitivity and spectral resolution to further investigate physical and\nchemical processes in pre-stellar cores. Here we present the velocity-resolved\nHerschel-HIFI observations of the ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) line at 572 GHz and study\nthe abundance profile of ammonia across the pre-stellar core L1544 to test\ncurrent theories of its physical and chemical structure.\n  Recently calculated collisional coefficients have been included in our\nnon-LTE radiative transfer code to reproduce Herschel observations. A gas-grain\nchemical model, including spin-state chemistry and applied to the (static)\nphysical structure of L1544 is also used to infer the abundance profile of\northo-NH_3 . The hyperfine structure of ortho-NH_3(1_0-0_0) is resolved for the\nfirst time in space. All the hyperfine components are strongly self-absorbed.\nThe profile can be reproduced if the core is contracting in quasi-equilibrium,\nconsistent with previous work, and if the NH_3 abundance is slightly rising\ntoward the core centre, as deduced from previous interferometric observations\nof para-NH_3(1,1). The chemical model overestimates the NH_3 abundance at radii\nbetween ~ 4000 and 15000 AU by about two orders of magnitude and underestimates\nthe abundance toward the core centre by more than one order of magnitude. Our\nobservations show that chemical models applied to static clouds have problems\nin reproducing NH_3 observations.\n", "  Several trace constituents can reach saturation vapor pressure in Pluto's\npresent day atmosphere. As such, we describe a search for discrete could\nfeatures in Pluto's atmosphere using New Horizons data obtained on 14-15 July\n2015, during the Pluto flyby closest approach. We report that Pluto's present\nday atmosphere is at least largely (>99% by surface area) free of discrete\nclouds. We also report a handful of features that may plausibly be clouds, all\nof which were detected obliquely and at high phase observing geometry. No cloud\ncandidates were identified away from the terminators or in low phase\n(backscattering geometry) images.\n", "  Recent ALMA observations indicate that CW Leo, the closest carbon-rich AGB\nstar to the Sun, might have a low-mass stellar companion. We present archival\nground-based astrometric measurements of CW Leo obtained within the context of\nthe Torino Parallax Program and with $>6$ yr ($1995 - 2001$) of time baseline.\nThe residuals to a single-star solution show significant curvature, and they\nare strongly correlated with the well-known $I$-band photometric variations due\nto stellar pulsations. We describe successfully the astrometry of CW Leo with a\nvariability-induced motion (VIM) + acceleration model. We obtain proper motion\nand parallax of the center-of-mass of the binary, the former in fair agreement\nwith recent estimates, the latter at the near end of the range of inferred\ndistances based on indirect methods. The VIM + acceleration model results allow\nus to derive a companion mass in agreement with that inferred by ALMA, they\npoint towards a somewhat longer period than implied by ALMA, but are not\ncompatible with much longer period estimates. These data will constitute a\nfundamental contribution towards the full understanding of the orbital\narchitecture of the system when combined with Gaia astrometry, providing a\n$\\sim 25$\\,yr time baseline.\n", "  We have monitored the BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714 in the optical bands\nduring 2012 January and February with long time spans on intraday timescales\n($>$5 hr) and high time resolutions. During this monitoring period, the object\nshows violent flaring activity both in short and intraday timescales. The\nobject has high value of duty cycle. The light curves detected as intraday\nvariability (IDV) show variability of various shapes. The variability amplitude\nis from 12.81 per cent to 33.22 per cent, and the average value $19.92\\pm5.87$\nper cent. The overall magnitude variabilities are $\\bigtriangleup B=1^{\\rm\nm}.24$, $\\bigtriangleup V=1^{\\rm m}.42$, $\\bigtriangleup R=1^{\\rm m}.3$,\n$\\bigtriangleup I=1^{\\rm m}.23$ respectively. During the observations, the\naverage change rate is $<CR>=0.035\\pm0.009$ Mag/h during the ascent and\n$<CR>=0.035\\pm0.014$ Mag/h during the descent. However, different cases are\nfound on certain nights. There are good inter-bands correlations but not\nsignificant time lags for intraday and short timescales. The results of the\nautocorrelation function show that the variability timescales range from 0.054\nday to 0.134 day. Most of nights show bluer when brighter (BWB) chromatic\ntrend; a weak redder with brighter (RWB) trend is found; a few nights show no\ncorrelations between magnitude and color index. The BWB trend appears in the\nshort timescales. During the flare the spectral index exhibits a clockwise loop\nfor inter-nights. A shock-in-jet model and the shock wave propagating along a\nhelical path are likely to explain the variability and color index variability.\n", "  We examine the relationship between magnetic flux generation, taken as an\nindicator of large-scale dynamo action, and magnetic helicity, computed as an\nintegral over the dynamo volume, in a simple dynamo. We consider dynamo action\ndriven by Magneto-Rotational Turbulence (MRT) within the shearing-box\napproximation. We consider magnetically open boundary conditions that allow a\nflux of helicity in or out of the computational domain. We circumvent the\nproblem of the lack of gauge invariance in open domains by choosing a\nparticular gauge -- the winding gauge -- that provides a natural interpretation\nin terms of average winding number of pairwise field lines. We use this gauge\nprecisely to define and measure the helicity and helicity flux for several\nrealizations of dynamo action. We find in these cases, that the system as a\nwhole does not break reflectional symmetry and the total helicity remains small\neven in cases when substantial magnetic flux is generated. We find no\nparticular connection between the generation of magnetic flux and the helicity\nor the helicity flux through the boundaries. We suggest that this result may be\ndue to the essentially nonlinear nature of the dynamo processes in MRT.\n", "  We present the first scattered light image of the debris disk around HD\n129590, a ~1.3 M$_\\odot$ G1V member of the Scorpius Centaurus association with\nage ~10-16 Myr. The debris disk is imaged with the high contrast imaging\ninstrument SPHERE at the Very Large Telescope, and is revealed by both the\nIRDIS and IFS subsytems, operating in the H and YJ bands respectively. The disk\nhas a high infrared luminosity of\n$L_{\\textrm{IR}}/L_{\\textrm{star}}$~5$\\times$10$^{-3}$, and has been resolved\nin other studies using ALMA. We detect a nearly edge on ring, with evidence of\nan inner clearing. We fit the debris disk using a model characterized by a\nsingle bright ring, with radius ~60-70 AU, in broad agreement with previous\nanalysis of the target SED. The disk is vertically thin, and has an inclination\nangle of ~75$^\\circ$. Along with other previously imaged edge-on disks in the\nSco-Cen association such as HD 110058, HD 115600, and HD 111520, this disk\nimage will allow of the structure and morphology of very young debris disks,\nshortly after the epoch of planet formation has ceased.\n", "  We discovered two small high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs) in HCN $J=4-3$\nand $J=3-2$ maps of the central 20 pc of our Galaxy. Both HVCCs have broad\nvelocity widths ($\\Delta V \\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$) and compact sizes ($d\\sim\n1$ pc), and originate from the dense molecular clouds in the position-velocity\nspace. One of them has a faint counterpart in a Paschen-$\\alpha$ image. Their\nspatial structure, kinematics, and absence of luminous stellar object are\ncompatible with the notion that each of the small HVCCs is driven by the plunge\nof an invisible compact object into a molecular cloud. Such objects are most\nlikely inactive, isolated black holes.\n", "  We explore the sensitivity of weak lensing observables to the expansion\nhistory of the universe and to the growth of cosmic structures, as well as the\nrelative contribution of both effects to constraining cosmological parameters.\nWe utilize ray-tracing dark-matter-only N-body simulations and validate our\ntechnique by comparing our results for the convergence power spectrum with\nanalytic results from past studies. We then extend our analysis to non-Gaussian\nobservables which cannot be easily treated analytically. We study the\nconvergence (equilateral) bispectrum and two topological observables, lensing\npeaks and Minkowski functionals, focusing on their sensitivity to the matter\ndensity $\\Omega_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. We find that a\ncancelation between the geometry and growth effects is a common feature for all\nobservables, and exists at the map level. It weakens the overall sensitivity by\nup to a factor of 3 and 1.5 for $w$ and $\\Omega_m$, respectively, with the\nbispectrum worst affected. However, combining geometry and growth information\nalleviates the degeneracy between $\\Omega_m$ and $w$ from either effect alone.\nAs a result, the magnitude of marginalized errors remain similar to those\nobtained from growth-only effects, but with the correlation between the two\nparameters switching sign. These results shed light on the origin of\ncosmology-sensitivity of non-Gaussian statistics, and should be useful in\noptimizing combinations of observables.\n", "  We experimentally study spin-Hall nano-oscillators based on [Co/Ni]\nmultilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We show that these devices\nare capable of single-frequency auto-oscillations at current densities\ncomparable to those in the in-plane magnetized oscillators. The demonstrated\noscillators exhibit large magnetization precession amplitudes, and their\noscillation frequency is highly tunable by the electric current. These features\nmake them promising for applications in high-speed integrated microwave\ncircuits.\n", "  We study structural and electronic properties of graphene grown on SiC\nsubstrate using scanning tunneling microscope (STM), spot-profile-analysis low\nenergy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED) and angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES). We find several new replicas of Dirac cones in the\nBrillouin zone (BZ). Their locations can be understood in terms of combination\nof basis vectors linked to SiC 6x6 and graphene 6xsqrt(3) x 6sqrt(3)\nreconstruction. Therefore these new features originate from the Moie caused by\nthe lattice mismatch between SiC and graphene. More specifically, Dirac cones\nreplicas are caused by underlying weak modulation of the ionic potential by the\nsubstrate that is then experienced by the electrons in the graphene. We also\ndemonstrate that this effect is equally strong in single and tri-layer\ngraphene, therefore the additional Dirac cones are intrinsic features rather\nthan result of photoelectron diffraction. These new features in the electronic\nstructure are very important for the interpretation of recent transport\nmeasurements and can assist in tuning the properties of graphene for practical\napplications.\n", "  The recent discovery of the planetary system hosted by the ultracool dwarf\nstar TRAPPIST-1 could open new perspectives into the investigation of planetary\nclimates of Earth-sized exoplanets, their atmospheres and their possible\nhabitability. In this paper, we use a simple climate-vegetation energy-balance\nmodel to study the climate of the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets and the climate\ndependence on the global albedo, on the fraction of vegetation that could cover\ntheir surfaces and on the different greenhouse conditions. The model allows us\nto investigate whether liquid water could be maintained on the planetary\nsurfaces (i.e., by defining a \"surface water zone\") in different planetary\nconditions, with or without the presence of greenhouse effect.\n  It is shown that planet TRAPPIST-1d seems to be the most stable from an\nEarth-like perspective, since it resides in the surface water zone for a wide\nrange of reasonable values of the model parameters. Moreover, according to the\nmodel outer planets (f, g and h) cannot host liquid water on their surfaces,\neven for Earth-like conditions, entering a snowball state. Although very\nsimple, the model allows to extract the main features of the TRAPPIST-1\nplanetary climates.\n", "  We carry out high resolution calculations of the solar overshoot region with\nunprecedentedly realistic parameters, especially the small energy flux compared\nwith $\\rho c^3_\\mathrm{s}$, where $\\rho$ and $c_\\mathrm{s}$ are density and\nspeed of sound. Our main purpose is to investigate behavior of the overshoot\nand the small-scale dynamo with parameters as close as possible to those of the\nSun. Our calculations show that the bottom part of the convection zone becomes\nsubadiabatic, which efficiently suppresses downflows. As a result we see a\nsteep transition from the CZ to the RZ whose width is estimated 0.4% of the\nlocal pressure scale height. This result is consistent with a semi-analytic\nconvection/overshoot model. We also find that the small-scale dynamo becomes\nefficient with a smaller energy flux. The sudden suppression of the downflows\naround the base of the convection zone increases the efficiency of the\nsmall-scale dynamo.\n", "  The mass evaporation rate of globular clusters evolving in a strong Galactic\ntidal field is derived through the analysis of large, multi-mass $N$-body\nsimulations. For comparison, we also study the same evaporation rates using\nMOCCA Monte Carlo models for globular cluster evolution. Our results show that\nthe mass evaporation rate is a dynamical value; that is, far from a constant\nsingle number found in earlier analytical work and commonly used in the\nliterature. Moreover, the evaporation rate derived with these simulations is\nhigher than values previously published. These models also show that the value\nof the mass evaporation rate depends on the strength of the tidal field. We\ngive an analytical estimate of the mass evaporation rate as a function of time\nand galactocentric distance xi(R_{GC},t). Upon extrapolating this formula to\nsmaller R_{GC} values, our results provide tentative evidence for a very high\nxi value at small R_{GC}. Our results suggest that the corresponding mass loss\nin the inner Galactic potential could be high and it should be accounted for\nwhen star clusters pass within it. This has direct relevance to nuclear cluster\nformation/growth via the infall of globular clusters through dynamical\nfriction. As an illustrative example, we estimate how the evaporation rate\nincreases for a ~10^5 solar masses globular cluster that decays through\ndynamical friction into the galactic centre. We discuss the findings of this\nwork in relation to the formation of nuclear star clusters by inspiraling\nglobular clusters.\n", "  This study shows that a relativistic Hall effect significantly changes the\nproperties of wave propagation by deriving a linear dispersion relation for\nrelativistic Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD). Whereas, in non- relativistic\nHMHD, the phase and group velocities of fast magnetosonic wave become\nanisotropic with an increasing Hall effect, the relativistic Hall effect brings\nupper bounds to the anisotropies. The Alfve\\'en wave group velocity with strong\nHall effect also becomes less anisotropic than non-relativistic case. Moreover,\nthe group velocity surfaces of Alfv\\'en and fast waves coalesce into a single\nsurface in the direction other than near perpendicular to the ambient magnetic\nfield. It is also remarkable that a characteristic scale length of the\nrelativistic HMHD depends on ion temperature, magnetic field strength, and\ndensity while the non-relativistic HMHD scale length, i.e., ion skin depth,\ndepends only on density. The modified characteristic scale length increases as\nthe ion temperature increases and decreases as the magnetic field strength\nincreases.\n", "  Light walls, as ensembles of oscillating bright structures rooted in sunspot\nlight bridges, have not been well studied, although they are important for\nunderstanding sunspot properties. Using the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph and Solar Dynamics Observatory observations, here we study the\nevolution of two oscillating light walls each within its own active region\n(AR). The emission of each light wall decays greatly after the appearance of\nadjacent brightenings. For the first light wall, rooted within AR 12565, the\naverage height, amplitude, and oscillation period significantly decrease from\n3.5 Mm, 1.7 Mm, and 8.5 min to 1.6 Mm, 0.4 Mm, and 3.0 min, respectively. For\nthe second light wall, rooted within AR 12597, the mean height, amplitude, and\noscillation period of the light wall decrease from 2.1 Mm, 0.5 Mm, and 3.0 min\nto 1.5 Mm, 0.2 Mm, and 2.1 min, respectively. Particularly, a part of the\nsecond light wall becomes even invisible after the influence of nearby\nbrightening. These results reveal that the light walls are suppressed by nearby\nbrightenings. Considering the complex magnetic topology in light bridges, we\nconjecture that the fading of light walls may be caused by a drop in the\nmagnetic pressure, where flux is cancelled by magnetic reconnection at the site\nof the nearby brightening. Another hypothesis is that the wall fading is due to\nthe suppression of driver source (p-mode oscillation), resulting from the\nnearby avalanche of downward particles along reconnected brightening loops.\n", "  The ambitious goals of precision cosmology with wide-field optical surveys\nsuch as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST) demand, as their foundation, precision CCD astronomy. This in turn\nrequires an understanding of previously uncharacterized sources of systematic\nerror in CCD sensors, many of which manifest themselves as static effective\nvariations in pixel area. Such variation renders a critical assumption behind\nthe traditional procedure of flat fielding--that a sensor's pixels comprise a\nuniform grid--invalid. In this work, we present a method to infer a curl-free\nmodel of a sensor's underlying pixel grid from flat field images, incorporating\nthe superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects--both known and\nunknown--present in flat field data. We use these pixel grid models to estimate\nthe overall impact of sensor systematics on photometry, astrometry, and PSF\nshape measurements in a representative sensor from the Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam) and a prototype LSST sensor. Applying the method to DECam data recovers\nknown significant sensor effects for which corrections are currently being\ndeveloped within DES. For an LSST prototype CCD with pixel-response\nnon-uniformity (PRNU) of 0.4%, we find the impact of \"improper\" flat-fielding\non these observables is negligible in nominal .7\" seeing conditions. These\nerrors scale linearly with the PRNU, so for future LSST production sensors,\nwhich may have larger PRNU, our method provides a way to assess whether\npixel-level calibration beyond flat fielding will be required.\n", "  We use three different techniques to identify hundreds of white dwarf (WD)\ncandidates in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS) based on\nphotometry from the NGVS and GUViCS, and proper motions derived from the NGVS\nand the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Photometric distances for these\ncandidates are calculated using theoretical color-absolute magnitude relations\nwhile effective temperatures are measured by fitting their spectral energy\ndistributions. Disk and halo WD candidates are separated using a tangential\nvelocity cut of 200 km~s$^{-1}$ in a reduced proper motion diagram, which leads\nto a sample of six halo WD candidates. Cooling ages, calculated for an assumed\nWD mass of 0.6$M_{\\odot}$, range between 60 Myr and 6 Gyr, although these\nestimates depend sensitively on the adopted mass. Luminosity functions for the\ndisk and halo subsamples are constructed and compared to previous results from\nthe SDSS and SuperCOSMOS survey. We compute a number density of (2.81 $\\pm$\n0.52) $\\times 10^{-3}$~pc$^{-3}$ for the disk WD population--- consistent with\nprevious measurements. We find (7.85 $\\pm$ 4.55) $\\times 10^{-6}$~pc$^{-3}$ for\nthe halo, or 0.3\\% of the disk. Observed stellar counts are also compared to\npredictions made by the TRILEGAL and Besan\\c{c}on stellar population synthesis\nmodels. The comparison suggests that the TRILEGAL model overpredicts the total\nnumber of WDs. The WD counts predicted by the Besan\\c{c}on model agree with the\nobservations, although a discrepancy arises when comparing the predicted and\nobserved halo WD populations; the difference is likely due to the WD masses in\nthe adopted model halo.\n", "  The spectrum of the MeV tail detected in the black-hole candidate Cygnus X-1\nremains controversial as it appeared much harder when observed with the\nINTEGRAL Imager IBIS than with the INTEGRAL spectrometer SPI or CGRO. We\npresent an independent analysis of the spectra of Cygnus X-1 observed by IBIS\nin the hard and soft states. We developed a new analysis software for the\nPICsIT detector layer and for the Compton mode data of the IBIS instrument and\ncalibrated the idiosyncrasies of the PICsIT front-end electronics. The spectra\nof Cygnus X-1 obtained for the hard and soft states with the INTEGRAL imager\nIBIS are compatible with those obtained with the INTEGRAL spectrometer SPI,\nwith CGRO, and with the models that attribute the MeV hard tail either to\nhybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonisation or to synchrotron emission.\n", "  How magnetic energy is injected and released in the solar corona, keeping it\nheated to several million degrees, remains elusive. Coronal heating generally\nincreases with increasing magnetic field strength. From comparison of a\nnon-linear force-free model of the three-dimensional active-region coronal\nfield to observed extreme-ultraviolet loops, we find that (1) umbra-to-umbra\ncoronal loops, despite being rooted in the strongest magnetic flux, are\ninvisible, and (2) the brightest loops have one foot in an umbra or penumbra\nand the other foot in another sunspot's penumbra or in unipolar or\nmixed-polarity plage. The invisibility of umbra-to-umbra loops is new evidence\nthat magnetoconvection drives solar-stellar coronal heating: evidently the\nstrong umbral field at \\underline{both} ends quenches the magnetoconvection and\nhence the heating. Broadly, our results indicate that, depending on the field\nstrength in both feet, the photospheric feet of a coronal loop on any\nconvective star can either engender or quench coronal heating in the loop's\nbody.\n", "  We have analyzed the theoretical model envelopes of eight Kepler F-stars by\ncomputing the phase shift of the acoustic waves, $\\alpha(\\omega)$, and its\nrelated function, $\\beta(\\omega)$. The latter is shown to be a powerful probe\nof the external stellar layers since it is particularly sensitive to the\npartial ionization zones located in these upper layers. We found that these\ntheoretical envelopes can be organized into two groups, each of which is\ncharacterized by a distinct $\\beta(\\omega)$ shape that we show to reflect the\ndifferences related to the magnitudes of ionization processes. Since\n$\\beta(\\omega)$ can also be determined from the experimental frequencies, we\ncompared our theoretical results with the observable $\\beta(\\omega)$. Using the\nfunction $\\beta(\\omega)$, and with the purpose of quantifying the magnitude of\nthe ionization processes occurring in the outer layers of these stars, we\ndefine two indexes, $\\Delta \\beta_1$ and $\\Delta \\beta_2$. These indexes allow\nus to connect the microphysics of the interior of the star with macroscopic\nobservable characteristics. Motivated by the distinct magnetic activity\nbehaviors of F-stars, we studied the relation between the star's rotation\nperiod and these indexes. We found a trend, in the form of a power-law\ndependence, that favors the idea that ionization is acting as an underlying\nmechanism, which is crucial for understanding the relation between rotation and\nmagnetism and even observational features such as the Kraft break.\n", "  The climate of early Mars has been hotly debated for decades. Although most\ninvestigators believe that the geology indicates the presence of surface water,\ndisagreement has persisted regarding how warm and wet the surface must have\nbeen and how long such conditions may have existed. Although the geologic\nevidence is most easily explained by a persistently warm climate, the perceived\ndifficulty that climate models have in generating warm surface conditions has\nseeded various models that assume a cold and glaciated early Mars punctuated by\ntransient warming episodes. However, I use a single-column radiative-convective\nclimate model to show that it is relatively more straightforward to satisfy\nwarm and relatively unglaciated early Mars conditions, requiring only about 1\npercent H2 and 3 bar CO2 or about 20 percent H2 and 0.55 bar CO2. In contrast,\nthe reflectivity of surface ice greatly increases the difficulty to transiently\nwarm an initially frozen surface. Surface pressure thresholds required for warm\nconditions increase about 10 to 60 percent for transient warming models,\ndepending on ice cover fraction. No warm solution is possible for ice cover\nfractions exceeding 40, 70, and 85 percent for mixed snow and ice and 25, 35,\nand 49 percent for fresher snow and ice at H2 concentrations of 3, 10, and 20\npercent, respectively. If high temperatures (298 to 323 K) were required to\nproduce the observed surface clay amounts on a transiently warm early Mars\n(Bishop et al), I show that such temperatures would have required surface\npressures that exceed available paleopressure constraints for nearly all H2\nconcentrations considered (1 to 20 percent). I then argue that a warm and\nsemi-arid climate remains the simplest and most logical solution to Mars\npaleoclimate.\n", "  For lensed galaxy SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 at redshift z=2.481, which is\nmagnified by a factor of 28 +- 8, we analyze the morphology of star formation\nas traced by rest-frame ultraviolet emission, in both the highly-magnified\nsource plane, and in simulations of how this galaxy would appear without\nlensing magnification. Were this galaxy not lensed but drawn from an HST deep\nfield, we would conclude that almost all its star formation arises from an\nexponential disk (S\\'ersic index of 1.0 +- 0.4) with an effective radius of r_e\n= 2.7 +- 0.3 kpc measured from two-dimensional fitting to F606W using Galfit,\nand r_e=1.9 +- 0.1 kpc measured by fitting a radial profile to F606W elliptical\nisophotes. At the normal spatial resolution of the deep fields, there is no\nsign of clumpy star formation within SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 . However, the\nenhanced spatial resolution enabled by gravitational lensing tells a very\ndifferent story: much of the star formation arises in two dozen clumps with\nsizes of r=30--50 pc spread across the 7 kpc length of the galaxy. The color\nand spatial distribution of the diffuse component suggests that still smaller\nclumps are unresolved. Despite this clumpy, messy morphology, the radial\nprofile is still well-characterized by an exponential profile. In this lensed\ngalaxy, stars are forming in complexes with sizes well below 100 pc; such sizes\nare wholly unexplored by surveys of galaxy evolution at 1<z<3.\n", "  We present measurements of the surface density of star formation, the\nstar-forming clump luminosity function, and the clump size distribution\nfunction, for the lensed galaxy SGAS J111020.0+645950.8 at a redshift of\nz=2.481. The physical size scales that we probe, radii r=30--50 pc, are\nconsiderably smaller scales than have yet been studied at these redshifts. The\nstar formation surface density we find within these small clumps is consistent\nwith surface densities measured previously for other lensed galaxies at similar\nredshift. Twenty-two percent of the rest-frame ultraviolet light in this lensed\ngalaxy arises from small clumps, with r<100 pc. Within the range of overlap,\nthe clump luminosity function measured for this lensed galaxy is remarkably\nsimilar to those of z~0 galaxies. In this galaxy, star-forming regions smaller\nthan 100 pc---physical scales not usually resolved at these redshifts by\ncurrent telescopes---are important locations of star formation in the distant\nuniverse. If this galaxy is representative, this may contradict the theoretical\npicture in which the critical size scale for star formation in the distant\nuniverse is of order 1 kiloparsec. Instead, our results suggest that current\ntelescopes have not yet resolved the critical size scales of star-forming\nactivity in galaxies over most of cosmic time.\n", "  Using the combined resolving power of the Hubble Space Telescope and\ngravitational lensing, we resolve star-forming structures in a z~2.5 galaxy on\nscales much smaller than the usual kiloparsec diffraction limit of HST. SGAS\nJ111020.0+645950.8 is a clumpy, star forming galaxy lensed by the galaxy\ncluster SDSS J1110+6459 at z = 0.659, with a total magnification ~30x across\nthe entire arc. We use a hybrid parametric/non-parametric strong lensing mass\nmodel to compute the deflection and magnification of this giant arc,\nreconstruct the light distribution of the lensed galaxy in the source plane,\nand resolve the star formation into two dozen clumps. We develop a\nforward-modeling technique to model each clump in the source plane. We ray\ntrace the model to the image plane, convolve with the instrumental point spread\nfunction (PSF), and compare with the GALFIT model of the clumps in the image\nplane, which decomposes clump structure from more extended emission. This\ntechnique has the advantage, over ray tracing, by accounting for the asymmetric\nlensing shear of the galaxy in the image plane and the instrument PSF. At this\nresolution, we can begin to study star formation on a clump-by-clump basis,\ntoward the goal of understanding feedback mechanisms and the buildup of\nexponential disks at high redshift.\n", "  We prove many factorization formulas for highest weight Macdonald polynomials\nindexed by particular partitions called quasistaircases. As a consequence we\nprove a conjecture of Bernevig and Haldane stated in the context of the\nfractional quantum Hall theory.\n", "  One of the long-standing problems of star formation is the excess of angular\nmomentum of the parent molecular cloud. In the classical picture, a fraction of\nangular momentum of the circumstellar material is removed by the\nmagneto-centrifugally driven disk wind that is launched from a wide region\nthroughout the disk. In this work, we investigate the kinematics in the\nenvelope-disk transition zone of the Class I object BHB07-11, in the B59 core.\nFor this purpose, we used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in\nextended configuration to observe the thermal dust continuum emission\n($\\lambda_0 \\sim$ 1.3 mm) and molecular lines (CO, C$^{18}$O and H$_2$CO),\nwhich are suitable tracers of disk, envelope, and outflow dynamics at a spatial\nresolution of $\\sim 30$ AU. We report a bipolar outflow that was launched at\nsymmetric positions with respect to the disk ($\\sim$80~AU in radius), but was\nconcentrated at a distance of 90--130~AU from the disk center. The two outflow\nlobes had a conical shape and the gas inside was accelerating. The large offset\nof the launching position coincided with the landing site of the infall\nmaterial from the extended spiral structure (seen in dust) onto the disk. This\nindicates that bipolar outflows are efficiently launched within a narrow region\noutside the disk edge. We also identify a sharp transition in the gas\nkinematics across the tip of the spiral structure, which pinpoints the location\nof the so-called centrifugal barrier.\n", "  Valleytronics is quickly emerging as an exciting field in fundamental and\napplied research. In this Letter, we study the acoustic version of valley\nstates in sonic crystals and reveal a vortex nature of such states. Besides the\nselection rules established for exciting valley polarized states, a mimicked\nspin Hall effect of sound is proposed further. The extraordinary chirality of\nvalley vortex states, detectable in experiments, may open new possibility in\nsound manipulations. This is appealing to scalar acoustics that lacks spin\ndegree of freedom inherently. Besides, the valley selection enables a handy way\nto create vortex matter in acoustics, in which the vortex chirality can be\ncontrolled flexibly. Potential applications can be anticipated with the exotic\ninteraction of acoustic vortices with matter, such as to trigger the rotation\nof the trapped microparticles without contact.\n", "  Muon imaging has recently emerged as a powerful method to complement standard\ngeophysical tools in the understanding of the Earth's subsurface. Muon\nmeasurements can yield a radiography of the average density along the muon\npath, allowing to image large volumes of a geological body from a single\nobservation point. Here we jointly invert muon data from three simultaneous\ntelescope acquisitions together with gravity data to estimate the\nthree-dimensional density structure of the La Soufri\\`ere de Guadeloupe lava\nDome. Our unique dataset allows us to achieve an unprecedented spatial\nresolution with this novel technique. The retrieved density model reveals an\nextensive, low-density anomaly where the most active part of the volcanic\nhydrothermal system is located, supporting previous studies that indicate this\nregion as the most likely to be involved in a partial edifice collapse.\n", "  The properties of the dusty tori in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been\ninvestigated in detail, mainly focusing on the geometry and components;\nhowever, the kinematics of the torus is still not clear. The narrow iron\nK$\\alpha$ line at 6.4 keV is thought to be produced by the X-ray reflection\nfrom the torus. Thus, the velocity-resolved reverberation mapping of it is able\nto constrain the kinematics of the torus. Such effort is limited by the\nspectral resolution of current CCD detectors and should be possible with the\nmicrocalorimeter on the next generation X-ray satellite. In this paper, we\nfirst construct the response functions of the torus under a uniform inflow, a\nKeplerian rotation, and a uniform outflow. Then the energy-dependent light\ncurve of the narrow iron K$\\alpha$ line is simulated according to the\nperformance of the X-ray Integral Field Unit in Athena. Finally, the\nenergy-dependent cross-correlation function is calculated to reveal the\nkinematic signal. According to our results, one hundred observations with 5 ks\nexposure of each are sufficient to distinguish the above three velocity fields.\nAlthough the real geometry and velocity field of the torus could be more\ncomplex than we assumed, the present result proves the feasibility of the\nvelocity-resolved reverberation mapping of the narrow iron K$\\alpha$ line. The\ncombination of the dynamics of the torus with those of the broad line region\nand the host galaxy is instructive for the understanding of the feeding and\nfeedback process of AGNs.\n", "  The 10m Prototype facility at the Albert-Einstein-Institute (AEI) in Hanover,\nGermany, employs three large seismic attenuation systems to reduce mechanical\nmotion. The AEI Seismic-Attenuation-System (AEI-SAS) uses mechanical\nanti-springs in order to achieve resonance frequencies below 0.5Hz. This system\nprovides passive isolation from ground motion by a factor of about 400 in the\nhorizontal direction at 4Hz and in the vertical direction at 9Hz. The presented\nisolation performance is measured under vacuum conditions using a combination\nof commercial and custom-made inertial sensors. Detailed analysis of this\nperformance led to the design and implementation of tuned dampers to mitigate\nthe effect of the unavoidable higher order modes of the system. These dampers\nreduce RMS motion substantially in the frequency range between 10 and 100Hz in\n6 degrees of freedom. The results presented here demonstrate that the AEI-SAS\nprovides substantial passive isolation at all the fundamental mirror-suspension\nresonances.\n", "  The notion of complex energy landscape underpins the intriguing dynamical\nbehaviors in many complex systems ranging from polymers, to brain activity, to\nsocial networks and glass transitions. The spin glass state found in dilute\nmagnetic alloys has been an exceptionally convenient laboratory frame for\nstudying complex dynamics resulting from a hierarchical energy landscape with\nrugged funnels. Here, we show, by a bulk susceptibility and Monte Carlo\nsimulation study, that densely populated frustrated magnets in a spin jam state\nexhibit much weaker memory effects than spin glasses, and the characteristic\nproperties can be reproduced by a nonhierarchical landscape with a wide and\nnearly flat but rough bottom. Our results illustrate that the memory effects\ncan be used to probe different slow dynamics of glassy materials, hence opening\na window to explore their distinct energy landscapes.\n", "  We construct a hidden variable model for the EPR correlations using a\nRestricted Boltzmann Machine. The model reproduces the expected correlations\nand thus violates the Bell inequality, as required by Bell's theorem. Unlike\nmost hidden-variable models, this model does not violate the $locality$\nassumption in Bell's argument. Rather, it violates $measurement$\n$independence$, albeit in a decidedly non-conspiratorial way.\n", "  Visinelli and Gondolo (2015, hereafter VG15) derived analytic expressions for\nthe evolution of the dark matter temperature in a generic cosmological model.\nThey then calculated the dark matter kinetic decoupling temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{kd}}$ and compared their results to the Gelmini and Gondolo (2008,\nhereafter GG08) calculation of $T_{\\mathrm{kd}}$ in an early matter-dominated\nera (EMDE), which occurs when the Universe is dominated by either a decaying\noscillating scalar field or a semistable massive particle before Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis. VG15 found that dark matter decouples at a lower temperature\nin an EMDE than it would in a radiation-dominated era, while GG08 found that\ndark matter decouples at a higher temperature in an EMDE than it would in a\nradiation-dominated era. VG15 attributed this discrepancy to the presence of a\nmatching constant that ensures that the dark matter temperature is continuous\nduring the transition from the EMDE to the subsequent radiation-dominated era\nand concluded that the GG08 result is incorrect. We show that the disparity is\ndue to the fact that VG15 compared $T_\\mathrm{kd}$ in an EMDE to the decoupling\ntemperature in a radiation-dominated universe that would result in the same\ndark matter temperature at late times. Since decoupling during an EMDE leaves\nthe dark matter colder than it would be if it decoupled during radiation\ndomination, this temperature is much higher than $T_\\mathrm{kd}$ in a standard\nthermal history, which is indeed lower than $T_{\\mathrm{kd}}$ in an EMDE, as\nstated by GG08.\n", "  Patsourakos et al. (Astrophys. J. 817, 14, 2016) and Patsourakos and\nGeorgoulis (Astron. Astrophys. 595, A121, 2016) introduced a method to infer\nthe axial magnetic field in flux-rope coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the\nsolar corona and farther away in the interplanetary medium. The method, based\non the conservation principle of magnetic helicity, uses the relative magnetic\nhelicity of the solar source region as input estimates, along with the radius\nand length of the corresponding CME flux rope. The method was initially applied\nto cylindrical force-free flux ropes, with encouraging results. We hereby\nextend our framework along two distinct lines. First, we generalize our\nformalism to several possible flux-rope configurations (linear and nonlinear\nforce-free, non-force-free, spheromak, and torus) to investigate the dependence\nof the resulting CME axial magnetic field on input parameters and the employed\nflux-rope configuration. Second, we generalize our framework to both Sun-like\nand active M-dwarf stars hosting superflares. In a qualitative sense, we find\nthat Earth may not experience severe atmosphere-eroding magnetospheric\ncompression even for eruptive solar superflares with energies ~ 10^4 times\nhigher than those of the largest Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES) X-class flares currently observed. In addition, the two\nrecently discovered exoplanets with the highest Earth-similarity index, Kepler\n438b and Proxima b, seem to lie in the prohibitive zone of atmospheric erosion\ndue to interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), except when they possess planetary magnetic\nfields that are much higher than that of Earth.\n", "  Many properties of the atomic nucleus, such as vibrations, rotations and\nincompressibility, can be interpreted as due to a two component quantum liquid\nof protons and neutrons. Electron scattering measurements on stable nuclei\ndemonstrate that their central densities are saturated, as for liquid drops. In\nexotic nuclei near the limits of mass and charge, with large imbalances in\ntheir proton and neutron numbers, the possibility of a depleted central\ndensity, or a 'bubble' structure, has been discussed in a recurrent manner\nsince the 1970s. Here we report first experimental evidence that points to a\ndepletion of the central density of protons in the short-lived nucleus 34Si.\nThe proton-to-neutron density asymmetry in 34Si offers the possibility to place\nconstraints on the density and isospin dependence of the spin--orbit force-on\nwhich nuclear models have disagreed for decades-and on its stabilizing effect\ntowards limits of nuclear existence.\n", "  What is conducted in the present work is the study of self-gravity effects on\nvertical structure of magnetized neutrino-dominated accretion disc (termed NDAF\nand considered as a central engine for Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)). Some of the\ndisc physical time scales such as viscous, cooling and diffusion time scales,\nthat are supposed to play a pivotal role in the late time evolutions of the\ndisc, have been studied. It is of our interest to investigate the possibility\nof the X-ray flares occurrence, observed in late time GRB's extended emission\nthrough the \"magnetic barrier\" and \"fragmentation\" processes in our model. The\nresults lead us to interpret self-gravity as an amplifier for Blandford-Payne\nluminosity (BP power) and the generated magnetic field, but a suppressor for\nneutrino luminosity and magnetic barrier process via highlighting fragmentation\nmechanism in the outer disc, especially for the higher mass accretion rates.\n", "  Time-bin encoding is an attractive method for transmitting photonic qubits\nover long distances with minimal decoherence. It allows a simple receiver for\nquantum key distribution (QKD) that extracts a key by measuring time of arrival\nof photons and detects eavesdropping by measuring interference of pulses in\ndifferent time bins. In the past, coherent pulses have been generated using a\nCW laser and an intensity modulator. A greatly simplified transmitter is\nproposed and demonstrated here that works by directly modulating the laser\ndiode. Coherence between pulses is maintained by a weak seed laser. The\nmodulator-free source creates time-bin encoded pulses with a high extinction\nratio (29.4 dB) and an interference visibility above 97 %. The resulting QKD\ntransmitter gives estimated secure key rates up to 4.57 Mbit/s, the highest yet\nreported for coherent-one-way QKD, and can be programmed for all protocols\nusing weak coherent pulses.\n", "  Since 2012, thanks to the installation of the high resolution echelle\nspectrograph in the optical range HARPS-N, the Italian telescope TNG (La Palma)\nbecame one of the key facilities for the study of the extrasolar planets. In\n2014 TNG also offered GIANO to the scientific community, providing a\nnear-infrared (NIR) cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy covering 0.97 - 2.45\nmicron at a resolution of 50,000. GIANO, although designed for direct\nlight-feed from the telescope at the Nasmyth-B focus, was provisionally mounted\non the rotating building and connected via fibers to only available interface\nat the Nasmyth-A focal plane. The synergy between these two instruments is\nparticularly appealing for a wide range of science cases, especially for the\nsearch for exoplanets around young and active stars and the characterisation of\ntheir atmosphere. Through the funding scheme \"WOW\" (a Way to Others Worlds),\nthe Italian National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) proposed to position\nGIANO at the focal station for which it was originally designed and the\nsimultaneous use of these spectrographs with the aim to achieve high-resolution\nspectroscopy in a wide wavelength range (0.383-2.45 micron) obtained in a\nsingle exposure, giving rise to the project called GIARPS (GIANO-B & HARPS-N).\nBecause of its characteristics GIARPS can be considered the first and unique\nworldwide instrument providing not only high resolution in a large wavelength\nband, but also a high precision radial velocity measurement both in the visible\nand in the NIR arm, since in the next future GIANO-B will be equipped with gas\nabsorption cells.\n", "  This paper pointed out that the usual gyrocenter transform, which implements\nsingle-parameter Lie transform perturbation theory on Lagrangian differential\n1-form of the orbit of charged particles immersed in a strong magnetic field,\nis not a near identical coordinate transform, and further causes some\nunphysical terms in the eventual orbit equations.\n", "  We demonstrate the potential of Deep Learning methods for measurements of\ncosmological parameters from density fields, focusing on the extraction of\nnon-Gaussian information. We consider weak lensing mass maps as our dataset. We\naim for our method to be able to distinguish between five models, which were\nchosen to lie along the $\\sigma_8$ - $\\Omega_m$ degeneracy, and have nearly the\nsame two-point statistics. We design and implement a Deep Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (DCNN) which learns the relation between five cosmological models and\nthe mass maps they generate. We develop a new training strategy which ensures\nthe good performance of the network for high levels of noise. We compare the\nperformance of this approach to commonly used non-Gaussian statistics, namely\nthe skewness and kurtosis of the convergence maps. We find that our\nimplementation of DCNN outperforms the skewness and kurtosis statistics,\nespecially for high noise levels. The network maintains the mean discrimination\nefficiency greater than $85\\%$ even for noise levels corresponding to ground\nbased lensing observations, while the other statistics perform worse in this\nsetting, achieving efficiency less than $70\\%$. This demonstrates the ability\nof CNN-based methods to efficiently break the $\\sigma_8$ - $\\Omega_m$\ndegeneracy with weak lensing mass maps alone. We discuss the potential of this\nmethod to be applied to the analysis of real weak lensing data and other\ndatasets.\n", "  In this paper, the theoretical terms of contemporary cosmology are examined\nas intellectual artefacts. An ontology and methodology are introduced for this\npurpose, which includes defining the concept of a hypothetical object.\nIntroducing a hypothetical object is contrasted with the modification of\nphysical laws as alternative ways of explaining the discrepancy between\nobservations and theoretical predictions. Historical examples of theory choice,\nwhich involved these alternatives, are discussed. This is followed by a study\nof theory choice in contemporary cosmology. In particular, the focus is on the\ncase of dark matter and modified gravity as alternative explanations for\nobserved mass discrepancies in galaxies and galaxy clusters. These alternatives\nare analyzed, and their similarities and differences to the historical examples\nare pointed out.\n", "  We investigate the quantum dynamics of a harmonically trapped particle (e.g.\nan ion) that is immersed in a Bose--Einstein condensate. The ultracold\nenvironment acts as a refrigerator, and thus, the influence on the motion of\nthe ion is dissipative. We study the fully coupled quantum dynamics of particle\nand Bose gas in a linearized regime, treating the quasi-particle excitations of\nthe gas as a (non-Markovian) environment for the particle dynamics. The density\noperator of the latter follows a known non-Markovian master equation with a\nhighly non-trivial bath correlation function that we determine and study in\ndetail. The corresponding damping rate and frequency shift of the particle\noscillations can be read off. We are able to identify a Quantum Landau\ncriterion for harmonically trapped particles in a superfluid environment: for\nfrequencies $\\omega$ well below the chemical potential, the damping rate is\nstrongly suppressed by a power law $\\omega^4$. This criterion can be seen as\nemerging from the classical Landau criterion involving a critical velocity\ncombined with Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for the localized wave packet\nof the quantum particle. Furthermore, due to the finite size of the Bose gas,\nafter some time we observe memory effects and thus non-Markovian dynamics of\nthe quantum oscillator.\n", "  A summary, from an experimental perspective, of the $52^{\\rm nd}$ Rencontres\nde Moriond session on Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories is\npresented.\n", "  In quantum mechanics, accidental degeneracy refers to energy degeneracy that\noccurs coincidentally, without any protection by symmetry. Here, we prove a\ntheorem stating that any two-fold degeneracy (accidental or not) in a quantum\nsystem is protected by a novel hidden symmetry, which can be expressed by an\nantiunitary operator with its square being -1. In this sense, the so-called\naccidental degeneracy is not really accidental, and this actually implies a\nhidden antiunitary symmetry.\n", "  With the manuscript of the Sidereus Nuncius preserved at the Biblioteca\nNazionale of Florence are included 7 watercolors of the Moon painted by Galileo\nhimself. We suggest that some of them, and in particular the drawing of the 30\nNov 1609 of the very first Moon's observations, illustrate the phenomenon of\nthe Earthshine of the Moon, which was discussed in some detail in the Sidereus\nNuncius to provide evidence of the similarity of Earth to other celestial\nbodies. The watercolors were used as models for the engraving of the Moon in\nthe Sidereus but, surprisingly, the secondary light had not been reproduced.\nGalileo may have decided for the inclusion of the passage on the Earthshine\nonly at a very late stage of the editorial process. Galileo's hesitation shows\nhow contentious was this issue already recognized as a possible discriminant\nbetween the different systems of the world.\n", "  A formulation of $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a\nspacetime-dependent gauge coupling allows to study the breaking of conformal\nsymmetry at the quantum level. The theory has an energy-momentum tensor that is\nonly conserved if an equation of motion for the coupling is imposed. It admits\nnon-trivial solitons, among which the Wu-Yang monopole that can be regularized\nand turns out to be massless. On the other hand, the ordinary BPS monopole is\nonly a solution in the large $N_c$ limit.\n", "  We have combined the wide-area Herschel-ATLAS far-IR survey with\nspectroscopic redshifts from GAMA and SDSS to define a sample of 21\nlow--redshift ($z_{\\rm spec} < 0.5$) analogs of submm galaxies (SMGs). These\nhave been selected because their dust temperatures and total IR luminosities\nare similar to those for the classical high-redshift SMG population. As well as\npresenting the sample, in this paper we report $^{12}$CO(2-1) and\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) observations of 16 low-redshift analogs of SMGs taken with the\nIRAM-30m telescope. We have obtained that low-redshift analogs of SMGs\nrepresent a very diverse population, similar to what has been found for\nhigh-redshift SMGs. A large variety in the molecular gas excitation or\n$^{12}$CO(2-1)/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratio is seen, meaning that extrapolations\nfrom $J \\geq 2$ CO lines can result in very uncertain molecular gas mass\ndeterminations. Our sources with $^{12}$CO(1-0) detections follow the dust--gas\ncorrelation found in previous work at different redshifts and luminosities. The\nmolecular gas mass of low-redshift SMGs has an average value of $M_{\\rm H_2}\n\\sim 1.6 \\times 10^{10}\\,M_\\odot$ and will be consumed in $\\sim 100 \\, {\\rm\nMyr}$ . We also find a wide range of molecular gas fractions, with the highest\nvalues being compatible with those found in high-redshift SMGs with\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) detections, which are only the most luminous. Low-redshift SMGs\noffer a unique opportunity to study the properties of extreme star formation in\na detail not possible at higher redshifts.\n", "  Foreground removal is the most important step in detecting the large-scale\nredshifted HI 21-cm signal. Modelling foreground spectra is challenging and is\nfurther complicated by the chromatic response of the telescope. We present a\nmulti-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) estimator for use in a survey for\nredshifted HI 21-cm emission from z~3.35, and demonstrate its ability to\naccurately characterize the foregrounds. This survey will be carried out with\nthe two wide-field interferometer modes of the upgraded Ooty Radio Telescope,\ncalled the Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA), at 326.5 MHz. We have tailored the\ntwo-visibility correlation for OWFA to estimate the MAPS and test it with\nsimulated foregrounds. In the process, we describe a software model that\nencodes the geometry and the details of the telescope, and simulates a\nrealistic model for the bright radio sky. This article presents simulations\nwhich include the full chromatic response of the telescope, in addition to the\nfrequency dependence intrinsic to the foregrounds. We find that the visibility\ncorrelation MAPS estimator recovers the input angular power spectrum\naccurately, and that the instrument response to the foregrounds dominates the\nsystematic errors in the recovered foreground power spectra.\n", "  Nonlocality is the most characteristic feature of quantum mechanics. John\nBell, in his seminal 1964 work, proved that local-realism imposes a bound on\nthe correlations among the measurement statistics of distant observers.\nSurpassing this bound rules out local-realistic description of microscopic\nphenomena, establishing the presence of nonlocal correlation. To manifest\nnonlocality, it requires, in the simplest scenario, two measurements performed\nrandomly by each of two distant observers. In this work, we propose a novel\nframework where three measurements, two on Alice's side and one on Bob's side,\nsuffice to reveal quantum nonlocality and hence does not require all-out\nrandomness in measurement choice. Our method relies on a very naive operational\ntask in quantum information theory, namely, the minimal error state\ndiscrimination. As a practical implication this method constitutes an\neconomical entanglement detection scheme, which uses a less number of entangled\nstates compared to all such existing schemes. Moreover, the method applies to\nclass of generalized probability theories containing quantum theory as a\nspecial example.\n", "  Inspired by the long wave-length limit of topological M-theory, which\nre-constructs the theory of $3+1$D gravity in the self-dual variables'\nformulation, we conjecture the existence of a duality between Hilbert spaces,\nthe ${\\bf H}$-duality, to unify topological M-theory and loop quantum gravity\n(LQG). By ${\\bf H}$-duality non-trivial gravitational holonomies of the\nkinematical Hilbert space of LQG correspond to space-like M-branes. The\nspinfoam approach captures the non-perturbative dynamics of space-like\nM-branes, and can be claimed to be dual to the S-branes foam. The Hamiltonian\nconstraint dealt with in LQG is reinterpreted as a quantum superposition of\nSM-brane nucleations and decays.\n", "  A mathematical model of the metabolic process of formation of the hemostasis\nin a blood-carrying vessel is constructed. As distinct from the earlier\ndeveloped model of the multienzyme prostacyclin-thromboxane system of blood,\nthis model includes, for the first time, the influence of the level of \"bad\ncholesterol\", i.e., low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), on the hemostasis. The\nconditions, under which the self-organization of the system appears, and the\nmodes of autooscillations and chaos in the metabolic process, which affects the\nformation of hemostasis and the development of thrombophilia, are found. With\nthe aid of a phase-parametric diagram, the scenario of their appearance is\nstudied. The bifurcations of doubling of a period and the transition to chaotic\noscillations as a result of the intermittence are found. The obtained strange\nattractors are formed due to a mixing funnel. The full spectra of Lyapunov's\nindices, KS-entropies, \"predictability horizons\", and Lyapunov's dimensions of\nstrange attractors are calculated. The reasons for a change in the cyclicity of\nthe given metabolic process, its stability, and the physiological manifestation\nin the blood-carrying system are discussed. The role of physiologically active\nsubstances in a decrease in the level of cholesterol in blood vessels is\nestimated.\n", "  The exponential speedups promised by Hamiltonian simulation on a quantum\ncomputer depends crucially on structure in both the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$, and\nthe quantum circuit $\\hat{U}$ that encodes its description. In the quest to\nbetter approximate time-evolution $e^{-i\\hat{H}t}$ with error $\\epsilon$, we\nmotivate a systematic approach to understanding and exploiting structure, in a\nsetting where Hamiltonians are encoded as measurement operators of unitary\ncircuits $\\hat{U}$ for generalized measurement. This allows us to define a\n\\emph{uniform spectral amplification} problem on this framework for expanding\nthe spectrum of encoded Hamiltonian with exponentially small distortion. We\npresent general solutions to uniform spectral amplification in a hierarchy\nwhere factoring $\\hat{U}$ into $n=1,2,3$ unitary oracles represents increasing\nstructural knowledge of the encoding. Combined with structural knowledge of the\nHamiltonian, specializing these results allow us simulate time-evolution by\n$d$-sparse Hamiltonians using $\\mathcal{O}\\left(t(d \\|\\hat\nH\\|_{\\text{max}}\\|\\hat H\\|_{1})^{1/2}\\log{(t\\|\\hat{H}\\|/\\epsilon)}\\right)$\nqueries, where $\\|\\hat H\\|\\le \\|\\hat H\\|_1\\le d\\|\\hat H\\|_{\\text{max}}$. Up to\nlogarithmic factors, this is a polynomial improvement upon prior art using\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(td\\|\\hat\nH\\|_{\\text{max}}+\\frac{\\log{(1/\\epsilon)}}{\\log\\log{(1/\\epsilon)}}\\right)$ or\n$\\mathcal{O}(t^{3/2}(d \\|\\hat H\\|_{\\text{max}}\\|\\hat H\\|_{1}\\|\\hat\nH\\|/\\epsilon)^{1/2})$ queries. In the process, we also prove a matching lower\nbound of $\\Omega(t(d\\|\\hat H\\|_{\\text{max}}\\|\\hat H\\|_{1})^{1/2})$ queries,\npresent a distortion-free generalization of spectral gap amplification, and an\namplitude amplification algorithm that performs multiplication on unknown state\namplitudes.\n", "  Topic of the thesis is a theoretical description of the ultracold atomic\ngases in one- and two-dimensional optical lattices in the presence of the\ndisorder leading to the Anderson localization. The disorder is created by\ninteraction of the main fraction of atoms with the second immobilized fraction\ndistributed randomly over the lattice.\n  In low-dimensional systems there is no transition from the Anderson localized\nto the conducting phase, although in the presence of correlations a discrete\nset of extended states can exist. The first part of the thesis is devoted to\nproperties of such states. In the finite size lattices, the presence of those\nstates results in the appearance of `windows of transport' -- energy ranges, in\nwhich the localization length is longer than the system size.The analytical\nmethod of determining the extended states energies for correlations of\ngeneralized $N$-mers type is presented, along with a proof that indeed those\nstates are extended in the infinite system. Subsequently, the way of\nexperimental creation of this type of correlations is proposed, as well as the\ntechnique of generation of the disorder in the tunneling amplitudes, which\nsignificantly enhances tunability of the proposed energy filters.\n  The second part of the thesis describes the method which allows to simulate a\nspecific type of the disorder: random magnetic field. Systems of such a class,\ncreated in a two dimensional lattice using simultaneous fast periodic\nmodulation of the lattice height and interactions with immobilized species, may\nallow in future to investigate the range of topics from the condensed matter\nphysics, for example fractional quantum Hall effect at half-filling. In the\nthesis, the most interesting features observed upon investigation of such\nsystems are presented. Especially, the anomalously low localization length for\ncorrelated disorder is explained.\n", "  We present a statistical framework to compare spectral-line data cubes of\nmolecular clouds and use the framework to perform an analysis of various\nstatistical tools developed from methods proposed in the literature. We test\nwhether our methods are sensitive to changes in the underlying physical\nproperties of the clouds or whether their behaviour is governed by random\nfluctuations. We perform a set of 32 self-gravitating magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations that test all combinations of five physical parameters -- Mach\nnumber, plasma parameter, virial parameter, driving scales, and solenoidal\ndriving fraction -- each of which can be set to a low or high value. We create\nmock observational data sets of ${\\rm ^{13}CO}$(1-0) emission from each\nsimulation. We compare these mock data to a those generated from a set of\nbaseline simulations using pseudo-distance metrics based on 18 different\nstatistical techniques that have previously been used to study molecular\nclouds. We analyze these results using methods from the statistical field of\nexperimental design and find that several of the statistics can reliably track\nchanges in the underlying physics. Our analysis shows that the interactions\nbetween parameters are often among the most significant effects. A small\nfraction of statistics are also sensitive to changes in magnetic field\nproperties. We use this framework to compare the set of simulations to\nobservations of three nearby star-forming regions: NGC 1333, Oph A, and IC 348.\nWe find that no one simulation agrees significantly better with the\nobservations, although there is evidence that the high Mach number simulations\nare more consistent with the observations.\n", "  Single magnetic atoms or molecules with large single-ion magnetic anisotropy\nare highly desired for future applications in high-density data storage and\nquantum computation. Here we have synthesized an Fe-porphyrin complex on\nAu(111) substrate in a controlled way, and revealed large magnetic anisotropy\nenergy of more than 15 meV by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy. Two magnetic states with opposite spin directions are\ndiscriminated by inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy in varied magnetic\nfield, and are found to have long spin lifetimes. First-principle calculations\nreveal that the weak ligand filed in this complex keeps the Fe atom in a\nhigh-spin state and preserves its large orbital angular momentum, which gives\nrise to an easy-axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and large magnetic\nanisotropy energy by spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  The most general expressions of the stored energies for time-harmonic\nelectromagnetic fields are derived from the time-domain Poynting theorem, and\nare valuable in characterizing the energy storage and transport properties of\ncomplex media. A new energy conservation law for the time-harmonic\nelectromagnetic fields, which involves the derived general expressions of the\nstored energies, is introduced. In contrast to the well-established Poynting\ntheorem for time-harmonic fields, the real part of the new energy conservation\nlaw gives an equation for the sum of stored electric and magnetic field\nenergies; the imaginary part involves an equation related to the difference\nbetween the dissipated electric and magnetic field energies. In a lossless\nisotropic and homogeneous medium, the new energy conservation law has a clear\nphysical implication: the stored electromagnetic field energy of a radiating\nsystem enclosed by a surface is equal to the total field energy inside the\nsurface subtracted by the field energy flowing out of the surface.\n", "  We describe the propagation of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)\nby means of a Boltzmann transport approach. Non-perturbative interaction\nbetween heavy quarks and light quarks have been taken into account through a\nquasi-particle approach in which light partons are dressed with thermal masses\ntuned to lQCD thermodynamics. Such a model is able to describe the main feature\nof the non-perturbative dynamics: the enhancement of the interaction strength\nnear $T_c$. We show that the resulting charm in-medium evolution is able to\ncorrectly predict simultaneously the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{AA}$, and\nthe elliptic flow, $v_2$, at both RHIC and LHC energies and at different\ncentralities. The hadronization of charm quarks is described by mean of an\nhybrid model of fragmentation plus coalescence and plays a key role toward the\nagreeement with experimental data.\n  We also performed calculations within the Langevin approach which can lead to\nvery similar $R_{AA}(p_T)$ as Boltzmann, but the charm drag coefficient as to\nbe reduced by about a $30\\%$ and also generates an elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ is\nabout a $15\\%$ smaller. We finally compare the space diffusion coefficient\n$2\\pi TD_s$ extracted by our phenomenological approach to lattice QCD results,\nfinding a satisfying agreement within the present systematic uncertainties. Our\nanalysis implies a charm thermalization time, in the $p\\rightarrow 0$ limit, of\nabout $4-6 \\, fm/c$ which is smaller than the QGP lifetime at LHC energy.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and MoS2, have been\nattracting wide interest in surface enhancement Raman spectroscopy. This\nperspective gives an overview of recent developments in 2D materials'\napplication in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This review focuses on the\napplications of using bare 2D materials and metal/2D material hybrid substrate\nfor Raman enhancement. The Raman enhancing mechanism of 2D materials will also\nbe discussed. The progress covered herein shows great promise for widespread\nadoption of 2D materials in SERS application.\n", "  We examine motion of test particles with various masses, electric charges and\ndilatonic charges in a background metric and fields of a charged dilatonic\nblack hole.\n", "  This paper investigates the emergence of amplitude death and revival of\noscillations from the suppression states in a system of coupled dynamical units\ninteracting through delayed cyclic mode. In order to resurrect the oscillation\nfrom amplitude death state, we introduce asymmetry and feedback parameter in\nthe cyclic coupling forms as a result of which the death region shrinks due to\nhigher asymmetry and lower feedback parameter values for coupled oscillatory\nsystems. Some analytical conditions are derived for amplitude death and revival\nof oscillations in two coupled limit cycle oscillators and corresponding\nnumerical simulations confirm the obtained theoretical results. We also report\nthat the death state and revival of oscillations from quenched state are\npossible in the network of identical coupled oscillators. The proposed\nmechanism has also been examined using chaotic Lorenz oscillator.\n", "  We study the constructive role of noises in a Lorenz system with functional\ndelay. The effect of delay can change the dynamics of the system to a chaotic\none from its steady state. Induced synchronization with white and colored (red\nand green) noises are observed between two identical uncoupled systems and\nenhancement of synchrony is also observed with unidirectional coupling. We\ninvestigate both the phenomena in a globally coupled network in the presence of\nwhite and color noises.\n", "  The suppression of oscillations in coupled systems may lead to several\nunwanted situations, which requires a suitable treatment to overcome the\nsuppression. In this paper, we show that the environmental coupling in the\npresence of direct interaction, which can suppress oscillation even in a\nnetwork of identical oscillators, can be modified by introducing a feedback\nfactor in the coupling scheme in order to restore the oscillation. We inspect\nhow the introduction of the feedback factor helps to resurrect oscillation from\nvarious kind of death states. We numerically verify the resurrection of\noscillations for two paradigmatic limit cycle systems, namely Landau-Stuart and\nVan der Pol oscillators and also in generic chaotic Lorenz oscillator. We also\nstudy the effect of parameter mismatch in the process of restoring oscillation\nfor coupled oscillators.\n", "  The properties of nucleus-acoustic (NA) solitary waves (SWs) and double\nlayers (DLs) in a four-component magnetized degenerate quantum plasma system\n(containing non-degenerate inertial light nuclei, both non-relativistically and\nultra-relativistically degenerate electrons and positrons, and immobile heavy\nnuclei) are theoretically investigated by the reductive perturbation method.\nThe Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV), the modified K-dV (MK-dV), and the Gardner\nequations are derived to examine the basic features (viz. amplitude, speed, and\nwidth) of NA SWs and DLs. It is found that the effects of the\nultra-relativistically degenerate electrons and positrons, stationary heavy\nnuclei, external magnetic field (obliqueness), etc. significantly modify the\nbasic features of the NA SWs and DLs. The basic features and the underlying\nphysics of NA SWs and DLs, which are relevant to some astrophysical compact\nobjects including white dwarfs and neutron stars, are pinpointed.\n", "  The formation and propagation of small amplitude Heavy-ion-acoustic (HIA)\nsolitary waves and double layers in an unmagnetized collisionless\nmulti-component plasma system consisting of superthermal electrons, Boltzmann\ndistributed light ions, and adiabatic positively charged inertial heavy ions\nare theoretically investigated. The reductive perturbation technique is\nemployed to derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mK-dV) and standard Gardner\n(SG) equations. The solitary wave (SW) solution of mK-dV and SG equations as\nwell as Double Layers (DLs) solution of SG equation is studied for analysis of\nhigher-order nonlinearity. It is found that the plasma system under\nconsideration supports positive and negative potential Gardner solitons but\nonly positive potential mK-dV solitons. In addition, it is shown that, the\nbasic properties of HIA mK-dV and Gardner solitons and DLs (viz. polarity,\namplitude, width, and phase speed) are incomparably influenced by the\nadiabaticity effect of heavy ions and the superthermality effect of electrons.\nThe relevance of the present findings to the system of space plasmas as well as\nto the system of researchers interest is specified.\n", "  The propagation of ion-acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) in a magnetized,\ncollisionless degenerate plasma system for describing collective plasma\noscillations in dense quantum plasmas with relativistically degenerate\nelectrons, oppositely charged inertial ions, and positively charged immobile\nheavy elements is investigated theoretically. The perturbations of the\nmagnetized quantum plasma are studied employing the reductive perturbation\ntechnique to derive the Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV) and the modified K-dV (mK-dV)\nequations that admits solitary wave solutions. Chandrasekhar limits are used to\ninvestigate the degeneracy effects of interstellar compact objects through\nequation of state for degenerate electrons in case of non-relativistic and\nultra-relativistic cases. The basic properties of small but finite-amplitude\nIASWs are modified significantly by the combined effects of the degenerate\nelectron number density, pair ion number density, static heavy element number\ndensity and magnetic field. It is found that the obliqueness affects both the\namplitude and width of the solitary waves, whereas the other parameters mainly\ninfluence the width of the solitons. The results presented in this paper can be\nuseful for future investigations of astrophysical multi-ion plasmas.\n", "  The heavy ion acoustic solitary waves (HIASWs) in a magnetized,\ncollisionless, three component space plasma system in the presence of dynamical\nheavy particles and bi-kappa distributed two distinct temperature of electrons\nhas been carried out. The Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV), the modified K-dV (mK-dV),\nand the further mK-dV (fmK-dV) equations are derived by employing the well\nknown reductive perturbation method. The basic features of HIASWs (speed,\namplitude, width etc.) are found to be significantly modified by the effects of\nnumber density of plasma species, superthermal electrons with two distinct\ntemperatures and the magnetic field (obliqueness). The K-dV and fm-KdV solitons\nexhibit both compressive and rarefactive structures, whereas the mK-dV solitons\nsupport only compressive structures. In order to trace the vicinity of the\ncritical heavy ion density, neither the magnetized KdV nor magnetized mKdV\nequation is suitable for describing the HIASWs. Therefore, we have considered a\nhigher order nonlinearity to describe the solitary profiles by deriving fmK-dV\nequation. The implication of our results in some space and laboratory plasma\nsituations are concisely discussed.\n", "  Myths and legends across the world contain many stories of deluges and\nfloods. Some of these have been attributed to tsunami events. Doggerland in the\nsouthern North Sea is a submerged landscape thought to have been heavily\naffected by a tsunami such that it was abandoned by Mesolithic human\npopulations at the time of the event. The tsunami was generated by the Storegga\nsubmarine landslide off the Norwegian coast which failed around 8150 years ago.\nAt this time there were also rapid changes in sea level associated with\ndeglaciation of the Laurentide ice sheet and drainage of its large proglacial\nlakes, with the largest sea level jumps occurring just prior to the Storegga\nevent. The tsunami affected a large area of the North Atlantic leaving\nsedimentary deposits across the region, from Greenland, through the Faroes, the\nUK, Norway and Denmark. From these sediments, run-up heights of up to 20 metres\nhave been estimated in the Shetland Isles and several metres on mainland\nScotland. However, sediments are not preserved everywhere and so reconstructing\nhow the tsunami propagated across the North Atlantic before inundating the\nlandscape must be performed using numerical models. These models can also be\nused to recreate the tsunami interactions with now submerged landscapes, such\nas Doggerland. Here, the Storegga submarine slide is simulated, generating a\ntsunami which is then propagated across the North Atlantic and used to\nreconstruct the inundation on the Shetlands, Moray Firth and Doggerland. The\nuncertainty in reconstructing palaeobathymetry and the Storegga slide itself\nresults in lower inundation levels than the sediment deposits suggest. Despite\nthese uncertainties, these results suggest Doggerland was not as severely\naffected as previous studies implied. It is suggested therefore that the\nabandonment of Doggerland was primarily caused by rapid sea level rise prior to\nthe tsunami event.\n", "  Pristine graphene is thought lack of catalytic activity up to date, although\nusing graphene-plus-heteroatom materials as catalysts has become a subject of\nintensive research because it can be metal saving, eco-friendly and ultimately\nsustainable. Here we report observations of catalytic reactions of\nhigh-quality, clean, pristine graphene when immersed into organics containing\nC=O bonds, like acetone, acetic acid and acetaldehyde. The C=O bonds were found\nto break and form polymers including polyethers. The reaction rate is highly\ntemperature dependent. The reaction products mainly physically adsorb on\ngraphene and do not cause increase of defect density in graphene, hence\ngraphene retains its intrinsic properties. This new catalysis shall not only\nfind practical importance but also deepen our understanding on the role of\ngraphene in all graphene based catalysis.\n", "  We discuss the adsorption of semiflexible polymers to a planar attractive\nwall and focus on the questions of the adsorption threshold for polymers of\n{\\it finite} length and their loop and tail distributions using both\nMonte-Carlo simulations and analytical arguments. For the adsorption threshold,\nwe find three regimes: (i) a flexible or Gaussian regime if the persistence\nlength is smaller than the adsorption potential range, (ii) a semiflexible\nregime if the persistence length is larger than the potential range, and (iii)\nfor finite polymers, a novel crossover to a rigid rod regime if the deflection\nlength exceeds the contour length. In the flexible and semiflexible regime,\nfinite size corrections arise because the correlation length exceeds the\ncontour length. In the rigid rod regime, however, it is essential how the\nglobal orientational or translational degrees of freedom are restricted by\ngrafting or confinement. We discuss finite size corrections for polymers\ngrafted to the adsorbing surface and for polymers confined by a second\n(parallel) hard wall. Based on these results we obtain a method to analyze\nadsorption data for finite semiflexible polymers such as filamentous actin. For\nthe loop and tail distributions, we find power laws with an exponential decay\non length scales exceeding the correlation length. We derive and confirm the\nloop and tail power law exponents for flexible and semiflexible polymers. This\nallows us to explain that, close to the transition, semiflexible polymers have\nsignificantly smaller loops and both flexible and semiflexible polymers desorb\nby expanding their tail length. The tail distribution allows us to extract the\nfree energy per length of adsorption for actin filaments from experimental data\n[D. Welch et al., Soft Matter 11, 7507 (2015)].\n", "  Recent experimental observations of laser-induced adsorption at the interface\nbetween an alkali vapor and a dielectric surface have demonstrated the\npossibility of growing metallic films of nanometric thickness on dielectric\nsurfaces, with arbitrary shapes determined by the intensity profile of the\nlight. The mechanisms directly responsible for the accumulation of atoms at the\nirradiated surface have been shown to involve photo-ionization of atoms very\nclose to the surface. However, the existence of a vapor-pressure threshold for\ninitiating the film growth still raises questions on the processes occurring at\nthe surface. In this letter, we report on the observation that the\nvapor-pressure threshold corresponds to a minimum adatom coverage necessary for\nthe surface to effectively neutralize the incoming ions and make possible the\ngrowth of a multilayer film. We discuss the hypothesis that the coverage\nthreshold is a surface conductivity threshold.\n", "  Within a mathematical model, the metabolic process of glycolysis is studied.\nThe general scheme of glycolysis is considered as a natural result of the\nbiochemical evolution. By using the theory of dissipative structures, the\nconditions of self-organization of the given process are sought. The\nautocatalytic processes resulting in the conservation of cyclicity in the\ndynamics of the process are determined. The conditions of breaking of the\nsynchronization of the process, increase in the multiplicity of a cyclicity,\nand appearance of chaotic modes are studied. The phase-parametric diagrams of a\ncascade of bifurcations, which characterize the transition to chaotic modes\naccording to the Feigenbaum scenario and the intermittence, are constructed.\nThe strange attractors formed as a result of the funnel effect are found. The\ncomplete spectra of Lyapunov indices and divergences for the obtained modes are\ncalculated. The values of KS-entropy, horizons of predictability, and Lyapunov\ndimensions of strange attractors are determined. Some conclusions concerning\nthe structural-functional connections in glycolysis and their influence on the\nstability of the metabolic process in a cell are presented.\n", "  As a way to recall and honour Guido Altarelli I contribute to the discussion\non the prospect for the future of Particle Physics. I do this because I am sure\nthat Guido would have liked the discussion, even though I am not equally sure\nthat he would have agreed on all the opinions I express here.\n", "  Chaos and ergodicity are the cornerstones of statistical physics and\nthermodynamics. While classically even small systems like a particle in a\ntwo-dimensional cavity, can exhibit chaotic behavior and thereby relax to a\nmicrocanonical ensemble, quantum systems formally can not. Recent theoretical\nbreakthroughs and, in particular, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis\n(ETH) however indicate that quantum systems can also thermalize. In fact ETH\nprovided us with a framework connecting microscopic models and macroscopic\nphenomena, based on the notion of highly entangled quantum states. Such\nthermalization was beautifully demonstrated experimentally by A. Kaufman et.\nal. who studied relaxation dynamics of a small lattice system of interacting\nbosonic particles. By directly measuring the entanglement entropy of\nsubsystems, as well as other observables, they showed that after the initial\ntransient time the system locally relaxes to a thermal ensemble while globally\nmaintaining a zero-entropy pure state.\n", "  The utility of resonant scattering spectroscopies for identifying electronic\nsymmetries and density distributions changes dramatically as a function of\nphoton energy. In the hard X-ray regime, strong core hole monopole potentials\ntend to produce X-ray absorption features with well defined electron number on\nthe scattering site. By contrast, in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), resonant\nscattering from Mott insulators tends to reveal spectra that are characteristic\nof only the nominal valence, and are insensitive to deviations from nominal\nvalence brought on by metal-ligand hybridization. Here, atomic multiplet\nsimulations are used to investigate the interplay of monopolar and mulitpolar\nCoulomb interactions in the VUV and soft X-ray regimes, to identify how charge\ntransfer thresholds and other signatures of mixed valence can manifest in this\nlow photon energy regime. The study focuses on the Mott insulator NiO as a well\ncharacterized model system, and extrapolates interactions into non-physical\nregimes to identify principles that shape the spectral features.\n", "  Within a mathematical model, the process of interaction of the metabolic\nprocesses such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is studied. As a result of the\nrunning of two opposite processes in a cell, the conditions for their\ninteraction and the self-organization in a single dissipative system are\ncreated.\n", "  One of the most important geodesics in a black-hole spacetime is the\nmarginally bound spherical orbit. This critical geodesic represents the\ninnermost spherical orbit which is bound to the central black hole. The radii\n$r_{\\text{mb}}({\\bar a})$ of the marginally bound {\\it equatorial} circular\ngeodesics of rotating Kerr black holes were found analytically by Bardeen {\\it\net. al.} more than four decades ago (here $\\bar a\\equiv J/M^2$ is the\ndimensionless angular-momentum of the black hole). On the other hand, no\nclosed-form formula exists in the literature for the radii of generic ({\\it\nnon}-equatorial) marginally bound geodesics of the rotating Kerr spacetime. In\nthe present study we analyze the critical (marginally bound) orbits of rapidly\nrotating Kerr black holes. In particular, we derive a simple {\\it analytical}\nformula for the radii $r_{\\text{mb}}(\\bar a\\simeq 1;\\cos i)$ of the marginally\nbound spherical orbits, where $\\cos i$ is an effective inclination angle (with\nrespect to the black-hole equatorial plane) of the geodesic. We find that the\nmarginally bound spherical orbits of rapidly-rotating black holes are\ncharacterized by a critical inclination angle, $\\cos i=\\sqrt{{2/3}}$, above\nwhich the coordinate radii of the geodesics approach the black-hole radius in\nthe extremal $\\bar a\\to1$ limit. It is shown that this critical inclination\nangle signals a transition in the physical properties of the orbits: in\nparticular, it separates marginally bound spherical geodesics which lie a\nfinite proper distance from the black-hole horizon from marginally bound\ngeodesics which lie an infinite proper distance from the horizon.\n", "  We present a method to derive an analytical expression for the roughness of\nan eroded surface whose dynamics are ruled by cellular automaton. Starting from\nthe automaton, we obtain the time evolution of the height average and height\nvariance (roughness). We apply this method to the etching model in 1 + 1\ndimensions, and then we obtain the roughness exponent. Using this in\nconjunction with the Galilean invariance we obtain the other exponents, which\nperfectly match the numerical results obtained from simulations. These\nexponents are exact, and they are the same as those exhibited by the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) model for this dimension. Therefore, our results\nprovide proof for the conjecture that the etching and KPZ models belong to the\nsame universality class. Moreover, the method is general, and it can be applied\nto other cellular automata models.\n", "  Besides the target to pursue the narrow bandwidth X-ray pulses, the large\nbandwidth free-electron laser pulses are also strongly demanded to satisfy a\nwide range of scientific user experiments. In this paper, using the\ntransversely tilt beam enabled by deflecting cavity and/or corrugated\nstructure, the potential of large bandwidth X-ray free-electron lasers\ngeneration with the natural gradient of the planar undulator are discussed.\nTheoretical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrated that X-ray\nbandwidth exceeding 5% can be observed with the optimized free-electron laser\nparameters.\n", "  In this work we generalize the etching model (Mello et al 2001 Phys. Rev. E\n63 041113) to d + 1 dimensions. The dynamic exponents of this model are\ncompatible with those of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. We\ninvestigate the roughness dynamics with surfaces up to d=6. We show that the\ndata from all substrate lengths and for all dimensions can be collapsed into\none common curve. We determine the dynamic exponents as a function of the\ndimension. Moreover, our results suggest that d=4 is not an upper critical\ndimension for the etching model, and that it fulfills the Galilean invariance.\n", "  It is shown that the generators of Clifford algebras behave as creation and\nannihilation operators for fermions and bosons. They can create extended\nobjects, such as strings and branes, and can induce curved metric of our\nspacetime. At a fixed point, we consider the Clifford algebra $Cl(8)$ of the\n8-dimensional phase space, and show that one quarter of the basis elements of\n$Cl(8)$ can represent all known particles of the first generation of the\nStandard model, whereas the other three quarters are invisible to us and can\nthus correspond to dark matter.\n", "  The damped driven nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) has been used to\nunderstand a range of physical phenomena in diverse systems. Studying this\nequation in the context of optical hyper-parametric oscillators in\nanomalous-dispersion dissipative cavities, where NLSE is usually referred to as\nthe Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), we are led to a new, reduced nonlinear\noscillator model which uncovers the essence of the spontaneous creation of\nsharply peaked pulses in optical resonators. We identify attracting solutions\nfor this model which correspond to stable cavity solitons and Turing patterns,\nand study their degree of stability. The reduced model embodies the fundamental\nconnection between mode synchronization and spatiotemporal pattern formation,\nand represents a novel class of self-synchronization processes in which\ncoupling between nonlinear oscillators is governed by energy and momentum\nconservation.\n", "  Simulations of charge transport in graphene are presented by implementing a\nrecent method published on the paper: V. Romano, A. Majorana, M. Coco, \"DSMC\nmethod consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle and comparison with\ndeterministic solutions for charge transport in graphene\", Journal of\nComputational Physics 302 (2015) 267-284. After an overview of the most\nimportant aspects of the semiclassical transport model for the dynamics of\nelectrons in monolayer graphene, it is made a comparison in computational time\nbetween MATLAB and Fortran implementations of the algorithms. Therefore it is\nstudied the case of graphene on substrates which it is produced original\nresults by introducing models for the distribution of distances between\ngraphene's atoms and impurities. Finally simulations, by choosing different\nkind of substrates, are done.\n  -----\n  Le simulazioni per il trasporto di cariche nel grafene sono presentate\nimplementando un recente metodo pubblicato nell'articolo: V. Romano, A.\nMajorana, M.

Dopo una panoramica sugli\naspetti pi\\`u importanti del modello di trasporto semiclassico per la dinamica\ndegli elettroni nel grafene sospeso, \\`e stato effettuato un confronto del\ntempo computazionale tra le implementazioni MATLAB e Fortran dell'algoritmo.\nInoltre \\`e stato anche studiato il caso del grafene su substrato su cui sono\nstati prodotti dei risultati originali considerando dei modelli per la\ndistribuzione delle distanze tra gli atomi del grafene e le impurezze. Infine\nsono state effettuate delle simulazioni scegliendo substrati di diversa natura.\n", "  Stochastic models of surface growth are usually based on randomly choosing a\nsubstrate site to perform iterative steps, as in the etching model [1]. In this\npaper I modify the etching model to perform sequential, instead of random,\nsubstrate scan. The randomicity is introduced not in the site selection but in\nthe choice of the rule to be followed in each site. The change positively\naffects the study of dynamic and asymptotic properties, by reducing the finite\nsize ef- fect and the short-time anomaly and by increasing the saturation time.\nIt also has computational benefits: better use of the cache memory and the\npossibility of parallel implementation.\n", "  The distribution of a population throughout the physiological age of the\nindividuals is very relevant information in population studies. It has been\nmodeled by the Langevin and the Fokker- Planck equations. A major problem with\nthese equations is that they allow the physiological age to move back in time.\nThis paper proposes an Infinitesimally ratcheted random walk as a way to solve\nthat problem. Two mathematical representations are proposed. One of them uses a\nnon-local scalar field. The other one is local, but involves a multi-component\nfield of speed states. These two formulations are compared to each other and to\nthe Fokker-Planck equation. The relevant properties are discussed. The dynamics\nof the mean and variance of the population age resulting from the two proposed\nformulations are obtained.\n", "  Radioactive waste disposal in deep boreholes may be more \"ready\" than\ndisposal in mined geologic repositories since mankind has greater experience\noperating small deep holes - boreholes, than big shallow holes - mines. There\nare several thousand precedents for constructing >2 km deep boreholes and\nseveral hundred precedents for disposing long-lived wastes in boreholes.\nBorehole disposal is likely to be faster, cheaper, and more flexible than mined\ndisposal, while also offering greater long-term isolation. Isolation would rely\non the great depth, water density gradients, and reducing conditions to prevent\nvertical movement of waste up the borehole.\n", "  Tungsten oxide and its associated bronzes (compounds of tungsten oxide and an\nalkali metal) are well known for their interesting optical and electrical\ncharacteristics. We have modified the transport properties of thin WO$_3$ films\nby electrolyte gating using both ionic liquids and polymer electrolytes. We are\nable to tune the resistivity of the gated film by more than five orders of\nmagnitude, and a clear insulator-to-metal transition is observed. To clarify\nthe doping mechanism, we have performed a series of incisive operando\nexperiments, ruling out both a purely electronic effect (charge accumulation\nnear the interface) and oxygen-related mechanisms. We propose instead that\nhydrogen intercalation is responsible for doping WO$_3$ into a highly\nconductive ground state and provide evidence that it can be described as a\ndense polaronic gas.\n", "  In recent years, the Characteristic formulation of numerical relativity has\nfound increasing use in the extraction of gravitational radiation from\nnumerically generated spacetimes. In this paper, we formulate the\nCharacteristic initial value problem for $f(R)$ gravity. We consider, in\nparticular, the vacuum field equations of Metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan\nframe, without utilising the dynamical equivalence with scalar-tensor theories.\nWe present the full hierarchy of non-linear hypersurface and evolution\nequations necessary for numerical implementation in both tensorial and eth\nforms. Furthermore, we specialise the resulting equations to situations where\nthe spacetime is almost Minkowski and almost Schwarszchild using standard\nlinearization techniques. We obtain analytic solutions for the dominant\n$\\ell=2$ mode and show that they satisfy the concomitant constraints. These\nresults are ideally suited as testbed solutions for numerical codes. Finally,\nwe point out that the Characteristic formulation can be used as a complementary\nanalytic tool to the $1+1+2$ semi-tetrad formulation.\n", "  We propose a new implementation of real-space renormalization group (RG)\ntransformations for quantum states on a lattice. Key to this approach is the\nremoval of short-ranged entanglement, similar to Vidal's entanglement\nrenormalization (ER), which allows a proper RG flow to be achieved. However,\nour proposal only uses operators that act locally within each block, such that\nthe use of disentanglers acting across block boundaries is not required. By\navoiding the use of disentanglers we argue many tensor network algorithms for\nstudying quantum many-body systems can be significantly improved. The\neffectiveness of this RG approach is demonstrated through application to the\nground state of a 1D system at criticality, which is shown to reach a\nscale-invariant fixed point.\n", "  We review some of the results that have been derived in the last years on\nconformal invariance, scaling limits and properties of some two-dimensional\nrandom curves. In particular, we describe the intuitive ideas that lead to the\ndefinition of the Schramm-Loewner evolutions SLE, we define these objects,\nstudy its various properties, show how to compute (probabilities, critical\nexponents) using SLE, relate SLE to planar Brownian motions (i.e. the\ndetermination of the critical exponents), planar self-avoiding walks, critical\npercolation, loop-erased random walks and uniform spanning trees.\n", "  These are the lecture notes from a course given in July 2005 at the summer\nschool in Les Houches. We describe some recent results concerning\ntwo-dimensional conformally invariant systems. In particular, we discuss\nconformally invariant measures on loops and conformal loop-ensembles (CLE).\n"]}
