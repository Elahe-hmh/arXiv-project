demonstrate a straightforward implementation of a push-button like\nsingle-photon source which is based on a strongly coupled atom-cavity system.\nThe device operates intermittently for periods of up to 100 microseconds, with\nsingle-photon repetition rates of 1.0 MHz and an efficiency of 60 %. Atoms are\nloaded into the cavity using an atomic fountain, with the upper turning point\nnear the cavity's mode centre. This ensures long interaction times without any\ndisturbances induced by trapping potentials. The latter is the key to reaching\ndeterministic efficiencies as high as obtained in probabalistic\nphoton-heralding schemes. The price to pay is the random loading of atoms into\nthe cavity and the resulting intermittency. However, for all practical\npurposes, this has a negligible impact.\n", "  It is shown that a general model for particle detection in combination with a\nlinear application of the Wigner rotations, which correspond to\nmomentum-dependent changes of the particle spin under Lorentz transformations,\nto the state of a massive relativistic particle in a superposition of two\ncounter-propagating momentum states leads to a paradox. The paradoxical\nbehavior is that the probability of finding the particle at different positions\nwould depend on the reference frame. A solution to the paradox is given when\nthe physical construction of the corresponding state is taken into account,\nsuggesting that we cannot in general linearly apply the Wigner rotations to a\nquantum state without considering the appropriate physical interpretation.\n", "  Recent advances in silicon nanofabrication have allowed the manipulation of\nspin qubits that are extremely isolated from noise sources, being therefore the\nsemiconductor equivalent of single atoms in vacuum. We investigate the\npossibility of directly coupling an electron spin qubit to a superconducting\nresonator magnetic vacuum field. By using resonators modified to increase the\nvacuum magnetic field at the qubit location, and isotopically purified 28Si\nsubstrates, it is possible to achieve coupling rates faster than the single\nspin dephasing. This opens up new avenues for circuit-quantum electrodynamics\nwith spins, and provides a pathway for dispersive read-out of spin qubits via\nsuperconducting resonators.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing can cause displacements, magnification, rotation\nand shearing of the images of distant galaxies. Most studies focus on the shear\nand magnification effects since they are more easily observed. In this paper we\nfocus on the effect of lensing displacements on wide field images. Galaxies at\nredshifts 0.5--1 are typically displaced by 1 arcminute, and the displacements\nare coherent over degree-size patches. However the displacement effect is\nredshift-dependent, so there is a visible relative shift between galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts, even if they are close on the sky. We show that the\nreconstruction of the original galaxy position is now feasible with lensing\nsurveys that cover many hundreds of square degrees. We test with simulations\ntwo approaches to \"delensing\": one uses shear measurements and the other uses\nthe foreground galaxy distribution as a proxy for the mass. We also estimate\nthe effect of foreground deflections on galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements and\nfind it is relevant only for LSST and Euclid-era surveys.\n", "  We study phase diffusion in a Bose-Einstein condensate of light in a\ndye-filled optical microcavity, i.e., the spreading of the probability\ndistribution for the condensate phase. To observe this phenomenon, we propose\nan interference experiment between the condensed photons and an external laser.\nWe determine the average interference patterns, considering quantum and thermal\nfluctuations as well as dissipative effects due to the dye. Moreover, we show\nthat a representative outcome of individual measurements can be obtained from a\nstochastic equation for the global phase of the condensate.\n", "  We investigate the existence and stability of discrete breathers in a chain\nof masses connected by linear springs and subjected to vibro-impact on-site\npotentials. The latter are comprised of harmonic springs and rigid constraints\nlimiting the possible motion of the masses. Local dissipation is introduced\nthrough a non-unit restitution coefficient characterizing the impacts. The\nsystem is excited by uniform time-periodic forcing. The present work is aimed\nto study the existence and stability of similar breathers in the space of\nparameters, if additional harmonic potentials are introduced.\nExistence-stability patterns of the breathers in the parameter space and\npossible bifurcation scenarios are investigated analytically and numerically.\nIn particular, it is shown that the addition of harmonic on-site potential can\nsubstantially extend the stability domain, at least close to the anti-continuum\nlimit. This result can be treated as an increase in the robustness of the\nbreather from the perspective of possible practical applications.\n", "  Boron Carbide exhibits a broad composition range, implying a degree of\nintrinsic substitutional disorder. While the observed phase has rhombohedral\nsymmetry (space group R3(bar)m), the enthalpy minimizing structure has lower,\nmonoclinic, symmetry (space group Cm). The crystallographic primitive cell\nconsists of a 12-atom icosahedron placed at the vertex of a rhombohedral\nlattice, together with a 3-atom chain along the 3-fold axis. In the limit of\nhigh carbon content, approaching 20% carbon, the icosahedra are usually of type\nB11Cp, where the p indicates the carbon resides on a polar site, while the\nchains are of type C-B-C. We establish an atomic interaction model for this\ncomposition limit, fit to density functional theory total energies, that allows\nus to investigate the substitutional disorder using Monte Carlo simulations\naugmented by multiple histogram analysis. We find that the low temperature\nmonoclinic Cm structure disorders through a pair of phase transitions, first\nvia a 3-state Potts-like transition to space group R3m, then via an Ising-like\ntransition to the experimentally observed R3(bar)m symmetry. The R3m and Cm\nphases are electrically polarized, while the high temperature R3(bar)m phase is\nnonpolar.\n", "  I examine the topic of training scientific generalists. To focus the\ndiscussion, I propose the creation of a new graduate program, analogous in\nstructure to existing MD/PhD programs, aimed at training a critical mass of\nscientific researchers with substantial intellectual breadth. In addition to\ncompleting the normal requirements for a PhD, students would undergo an\nintense, several year training period designed to expose them to the core\nvocabulary of multiple subjects at the graduate level. After providing some\nhistorical and philosophical context for this proposal, I outline how such a\nprogram could be implemented with little institutional overhead by existing\nresearch universities. Finally, I discuss alternative possibilities for\ntraining generalists by taking advantage of contemporary developments in online\nlearning and open science.\n", "  This study investigates the representations and understandings of electric\nfields expressed by Chinese high school students 15 to 16 years old who have\nnot received high school level physics instruction. The physics education\nresearch literature has reported students conceptions of electric fields\npost-instruction as indicated by students performance on textbook-style\nquestions. It has, however, inadequately captured student ideas expressed in\nother situations yet informative to educational research. In this study, we\nexplore students ideas of electric fields pre-instruction as shown by students\nrepresentations produced in open-ended activities. 92 participant students\ncompleted a worksheet that involved drawing comic strips about electric charges\nas characters of a cartoon series. Three students who had spontaneously\nproduced arrow diagrams were interviewed individually after class. We\nidentified nine ideas related to electric fields that these three students\nspontaneously leveraged in the comic strip activity. In this paper, we describe\nin detail each idea and its situated context. As most research in the\nliterature has understood students as having relatively fixed conceptions and\nmostly identified divergences in those conceptions from canonical targets, this\nstudy shows students reasoning to be more variable in particular moments, and\nthat variability includes common sense resources that can be productive for\nlearning about electric fields.\n", "  Ab initio electronic structure calculations based on density functional\ntheory and tight-binding methods for the thermoelectric properties of p-type\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ films are presented. The thickness-dependent electrical\nconductivity and the ther- mopower are computed in the diffusive limit of\ntransport based on the Boltzmann equation. Contributions of the bulk and the\nsurface to the transport coefficients are separated which enables to identify a\nclear impact of the topological surface state on the thermoelectric properties.\nBy tuning the charge carrier concentration, a crossover between a\nsurface-state-dominant and a Fuchs-Sondheimer transport regime is achieved. The\ncalculations are corroborated by thermoelectric transport measurements on\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ films grown by atomic layer deposition.\n", "  The stochastic thermodynamics of a dilute, well-stirred mixture of\nchemically-reacting species is built on the stochastic trajectories of reaction\nevents obtained from the Chemical Master Equation. However, when the molecular\npopulations are large, the discrete Chemical Master Equation can be\napproximated with a continuous diffusion process, like the Chemical Langevin\nEquation or Low Noise Approximation. In this paper, we investigate to what\nextent these diffusion approximations inherit the stochastic thermodynamics of\nthe Chemical Master Equation. We find that a stochastic-thermodynamic\ndescription is only valid at a detailed-balanced, equilibrium steady state.\nAway from equilibrium, where there is no consistent stochastic thermodynamics,\nwe show that one can still use the diffusive solutions to approximate the\nunderlying thermodynamics of the Chemical Master Equation.\n", "  In a previous paper, we have put forward an interpretation of quantum\nmechanics based on a non-relativistic, Lagrangian 3+1 formalism of a closed\nUniverse $M$, existing on timeless configuration space $\\mathcal{M}$. However,\nnot much was said there about the role of locality, which was not assumed. This\npaper is an attempt to fill that gap. To deal with the challenges gauge\nsymmetries may pose to a good definition of locality, I start by demanding\nsymmetries to have an action on $\\mathcal{M}$ so that the quotient wrt the\nsymmetries respects certain factorizations of $\\mathcal{M}$. These\nfactorizations are algebraic splits of $\\mathcal{M}$ into sub-spaces\n$\\mathcal{M}=\\bigoplus_i \\mathcal{M}_{O_i}$-- each factor corresponding to a\nphysical sub-region $O_i$. This deals with kinematic locality, but locality in\nfull can only emerge dynamically, and is not postulated. I describe conditions\nunder which it can be said to have emerged. The dynamics of $O$ is independent\nof its complement, $M-O$, if the projection of extremal curves on $M$ onto the\nspace of extremal curves intrinsic to $O$ is a surjective map. This roughly\ncorresponds to $e^{i\\hat{H}t}\\circ \\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{O}}= \\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{\nO}}\\circ e^{i\\hat{H}t}$, where $\\mathsf{pr}_{\\mbox{ O}}:\\mathcal{M}\\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{M}_O^{\\partial O}$ is a linear projection. This criterion for locality\ncan be made approximate -- an impossible feat had it been already postulated --\nand it can be applied for theories which do not have hyperbolic equations of\nmotion, and/or no fixed causal structure. When two regions are \\emph{mutually\nindependent} according to the criterion proposed here, the semi-classical path\nintegral kernel factorizes, showing cluster decomposition which is what one\nwould like to obtain from any definition of locality.\n", "  The theory presented in this monograph establishes the first mathematically\nrigorous result on the global nonlinear stability of self-gravitating matter\nunder small perturbations of an asymptotically flat, spacelike hypersurface of\nMinkowski spacetime. It allows one to exclude the existence of dynamically\nunstable, self-gravitating massive fields and, therefore, solves a\nlong-standing open problem in General Relativity. By a significant extension of\nthe Hyperboloidal Foliation Method they introduced in 2014, the authors\nestablish global-in-time existence for the Einstein equations expressed as a\ncoupled wave-Klein-Gordon system of partial differential equations. The metric\nand matter fields are sought for in Sobolev-type functional spaces, suitably\ndefined from the translations and the boosts of Minkowski spacetime.\n", "  The paper deals with the problem of the rigorous description of the evolution\nof states of large particle quantum systems by means of correlation operators.\nA nonperturbative solution of the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of nonlinear\nevolution equations for a sequence of marginal correlation operators is\nconstructed. For initial states specified in terms of a one-particle density\noperator and correlation operators we also develop an approach to the\ndescription of the processes of the creation and the propagation of\ncorrelations within the framework of a one-particle density operator. Moreover,\nthe mean field asymptotic behavior of constructed marginal correlation\noperators is established.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging with tremendous\npotential in many optoelectronic applications due to their strong light-matter\ninteractions. To fully explore their potential in photoconductive detectors,\nhigh responsivity and weak signal detection are required. Here, we present high\nresponsivity phototransistors based on few-layer rhenium disulfide (ReS2).\nDepending on the back gate voltage, source drain bias and incident optical\nlight intensity, the maximum attainable photoresponsivity can reach as high as\n88,600 A W-1, which is a record value compared to other two-dimensional\nmaterials with similar device structures and two orders of magnitude higher\nthan that of monolayer MoS2. Such high photoresponsivity is attributed to the\nincreased light absorption as well as the gain enhancement due to the existence\nof trap states in the few-layer ReS2 flakes. It further enables the detection\nof weak signals, as successfully demonstrated with weak light sources including\na lighter and limited fluorescent lighting. Our studies underscore ReS2 as a\npromising material for future sensitive optoelectronic applications.\n", "  We review the classical properties of Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz and\nPost-Wintenitz systems and their relation with N-dimensional rational Calogero\nmodel with oscillator and Coulomb potentials, paying special attention to their\nhidden symmetries. Then we show that combining the radial coordinate and\nmomentum in a single complex coordinate in proper way, we get an elegant\ndescription for the hidden and dynamical symmetries in these systems related\nwith action-angle variables.\n", "  Van der Waals junctions of two-dimensional materials with an atomically sharp\ninterface open up unprecedented opportunities to design and study functional\nheterostructures. Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides have shown\ntremendous potential for future applications due to their unique electronic\nproperties and strong light-matter interaction. However, many important\noptoelectronic applications, such as broadband photodetection, are severely\nhindered by their limited spectral range and reduced light absorption. Here, we\npresent a p-g-n heterostructure formed by sandwiching graphene with a gapless\nbandstructure and wide absorption spectrum in an atomically thin p-n junction\nto overcome these major limitations. We have successfully demonstrated a\nMoS2-graphene-WSe2 heterostructure for broadband photodetection in the visible\nto short-wavelength infrared range at room temperature that exhibits\ncompetitive device performance, including a specific detectivity of up to 1011\nJones in the near-infrared region. Our results pave the way toward the\nimplementation of atomically thin heterostructures for broadband and sensitive\noptoelectronic applications.\n", "  Computation models such as circuits describe sequences of computation steps\nthat are carried out one after the other. In other words, algorithm design is\ntraditionally subject to the restriction imposed by a fixed causal order. We\naddress a novel computing paradigm beyond quantum computing, replacing this\nassumption by mere logical consistency: We study non-causal circuits, where a\nfixed time structure within a gate is locally assumed whilst the global causal\nstructure between the gates is dropped. We present examples of logically\nconsistent non- causal circuits outperforming all causal ones; they imply that\nsuppressing loops entirely is more restrictive than just avoiding the\ncontradictions they can give rise to. That fact is already known for\ncorrelations as well as for communication, and we here extend it to\ncomputation.\n", "  In this work we show that (real space) curvature in the geometry of curved\nwaveguides with Rashba spin orbit interaction (RSOI) can lead to out of plane\nspin accumulations. We first derive the RSOI Hamiltonian on arbitrarily curved\nsurfaces. We then analyze the effects of curvature with two distinct methods.\nWe first apply an adiabatic approximation on gently curved, planar waveguides\nlying flat on the $xy$ plane to show that analogous to the acceleration of the\ncharge carriers by an electric field, the change in momentum direction of the\ncharge carriers as they move along the waveguide leads to an out of plane spin\naccumulation. We then use the Heisenberg equations of motion to establish the\nrelationships between spin currents and accumulations on non-planar waveguides.\nThese relations predict the existence of out of plane spin accumulation on\nasymmetrically curved, non-planar waveguides. We finally solve for the\neigenstates on such waveguides numerically, and present numerical results to\nverify our earlier analytic predictions.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that exhibit\nmany fascinating features. As compared to the well-studied cryogenic Bloch\nskyrmions in bulk materials, we focus on the room-temperature N\\'eel skyrmions\nin thin-film systems with an interfacial broken inversion symmetry in this\narticle. Specifically, we show the stabilization, the creation, and the\nimplementation of N\\'eel skyrmions that are enabled by the electrical\ncurrent-induced spin-orbit torques. Towards the nanoscale N\\'eel skyrmions, we\nfurther discuss the challenges from both material optimization and imaging\ncharacterization perspectives.\n", "  We present results from a deep Chandra X-ray observation of a merging galaxy\ncluster A520. A high-resolution gas temperature map, after the subtraction of\nthe cluster-scale emission, reveals a long trail of dense, cool clumps ---\napparently the fragments of a cool core that has been completely stripped from\nthe infalling subcluster by ram pressure. In this scenario, we can assume that\nthe clumps are still connected by the magnetic field lines. The observed\ntemperature variations imply that thermal conductivity is suppressed by a\nfactor >100 across the presumed direction of the magnetic field (as found in\nother clusters), and is also suppressed -along- the field lines by a factor of\nseveral. Two massive clumps in the periphery of A520, visible in the weak\nlensing mass map and the X-ray image, have apparently been completely stripped\nof gas during the merger, but then re-accreted the surrounding high-entropy gas\nupon exit from the cluster. An X-ray hydrostatic mass estimate for one of the\nclumps (that has simple geometry) agrees with the lensing mass. Its current gas\nmass to total mass ratio is very low, 1.5-3%, which makes it a \"dark\nsubcluster\". We also found a curious low X-ray brightness channel (likely a\nlow-density sheet in projection) going across the cluster along the direction\nof an apparent secondary merger. The channel may be caused by plasma depletion\nin a region of an amplified magnetic field (with plasma $\\beta\\sim 10-20$). The\nshock in A520 will be studied in a separate paper.\n", "  We find a strong-converse bound on the private capacity of a quantum channel\nassisted by unlimited two-way classical communication. The bound is based on\nthe max-relative entropy of entanglement and its proof uses a new inequality\nfor the sandwiched R\\'{e}nyi divergences based on complex interpolation\ntechniques. We provide explicit examples of quantum channels where our bound\nimproves both the transposition bound (on the quantum capacity assisted by\nclassical communication) and the bound based on the squashed entanglement\nintroduced by Takeoka et al.. As an application we study a repeater version of\nthe private capacity assisted by classical communication and provide an example\nof a quantum channel with negligible private repeater capacity.\n", "  Magneto-transport properties of SrIrO$_3$ thin films epitaxially grown on\nSrTiO$_3$, using reactive RF sputtering, are investigated. A large anisotropy\nbetween the in-plane and the out-of-plane resistivities is found, as well as a\nsignature of the substrate cubic to tetragonal transition. Both observations\nresult from the structural distortion associated to the epitaxial strain. The\nlow-temperature and field dependences of the Hall number are interpreted as due\nto the contribution of Coulomb interactions to weak localization, evidencing\nthe strong correlations in this material. The introduction of a contribution\nfrom magnetic scatters, in the analysis of magnetoconductance in the weakly\nlocalized regime, is proposed as an alternative to an anomalously large\ntemperature dependence of the Land\\'{e} coefficient.\n", "  This paper extends an earlier one describing the Higgs boson $H$ as a light\ncomposite scalar in a strong extended technicolor model of electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. The Higgs mass $M_H$ is made much smaller than $\\Lambda_{ETC}$ by\ntuning the ETC coupling very close to the critical value for electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. The technicolor interaction, neglected in the earlier paper,\nis considered here. Its weakness relative to extended technicolor is essential\nto understanding the lightness of $H$ compared to the low-lying spin-one\ntechnihadrons. Technicolor cannot be completely ignored, but implementing\ntechnigluon exchange together with strong extended technicolor appears\ndifficult. We propose a solution that turns out to leave the results of the\nearlier paper essentially unchanged. An argument is then presented that masses\nof the spin-one technifermion bound states, $\\rho_H$ and $a_H$, are much larger\nthan $M_H$ and, plausibly, controlled by technicolor. Assuming $M_{\\rho_H}$ and\n$M_{a_H}$ are in the TeV-energy region, we identify $\\rho_H$ and $a_H$ with the\ndiboson excesses observed near $2\\,{\\rm TeV}$ by ATLAS and CMS in LHC Run 1\ndata, and we discuss their phenomenology for Runs 2 and 3.\n", "  A permutation-invariant quantum code on $N$ qudits is any subspace stabilized\nby the matrix representation of the symmetric group $S_N$ as permutation\nmatrices that permute the underlying $N$ subsystems. When each subsystem is a\ncomplex Euclidean space of dimension $q \\ge 2$, any permutation-invariant code\nis a subspace of the symmetric subspace of $(\\mathbb C^q)^N.$ We give an\nalgebraic construction of new families of of $d$-dimensional\npermutation-invariant codes on at least $(2t+1)^2(d-1)$ qudits that can also\ncorrect $t$ errors for $d \\ge 2$. The construction of our codes relies on a\nreal polynomial with multiple roots at the roots of unity, and a sequence of\n$q-1$ real polynomials that satisfy some combinatorial constraints. When $N >\n(2t+1)^2(d-1)$, we prove constructively that an uncountable number of such\ncodes exist.\n", "  Abramo and D'Angelo (in press) doubt the validity of established\nsize-independent indicators measuring citation impact and plead in favor of\nmeasuring scientific efficiency (by using the Fractional Scientific Strength\nindicator). This note is intended to comment on some questionable and a few\nfavorable approaches in the paper by Abramo and D'Angelo (in press).\n", "  The interaction between swimming microorganisms or artificial self-propelled\ncolloids and passive (tracer) particles in a fluid leads to enhanced diffusion\nof the tracers. This enhancement has attracted strong interest, as it could\nlead to new strategies to tackle the difficult problem of mixing on a\nmicrofluidic scale. Most of the theoretical work on this topic has focused on\nhydrodynamic interactions between the tracers and swimmers in a bulk fluid.\nHowever, in simulations, periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are often imposed\non the sample and the fluid. Here, we theoretically analyze the effect of PBCs\non the hydrodynamic interactions between tracer particles and microswimmers. We\nformulate an Ewald sum for the leading-order stresslet singularity produced by\na swimmer to probe the effect of PBCs on tracer trajectories. We find that\nintroducing periodicity into the system has a surprisingly significant effect,\neven for relatively small swimmer-tracer separations. We also find that the\nbulk limit is only reached for very large system sizes, which are challenging\nto simulate with most hydrodynamic solvers.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of nonabelian T-duality on various\nidentification of the group of target space isometries of nonlinear sigma\nmodels with its orbits, i.e. with respect to the location of the group unit on\nmanifolds invariant under the isometry group. We show that T-duals constructed\nby isometry groups of dimension less than the dimension of the\n(pseudo)riemannian manifold may depend not only on the initial metric but also\non the choice of manifolds defining positions of group units on each of the\nsubmanifold invariant under the isometry group. We investigate whether this\ndependence can be compensated by coordinate transformation.\n", "  The color superconductivity was studied with an adaptation of the Nambu and\nJona-Lasinio model (NJL). This one was coupled to a Polyakov loop, to form the\nPNJL model. A $\\mu$-dependent Polyakov loop potential was considered. An\nobjective of the presented works was to describe the analytical calculations\nrequired to establish the equations to be solved, in all of the treated cases.\nThey concerned the normal quark phase, the 2-flavor color-superconducting and\nthe color-flavor-locked phases, in an SU(3)f X SU(3)c description. The\ncalculations were performed according to the temperature T, the chemical\npotentials $\\mu_{f}$ or according to the densities $\\rho_{f}$, with or without\nthe isospin symmetry. Among the obtained results, it was found that at low T,\nthe restoration of the chiral symmetry, the deconfinement transition and the\ntransition between the normal quark and 2-flavor color-superconducting phases\noccur via first order phase transitions at the same chemical potential.\nMoreover, an sSC phase was identified in the $\\rho_{q}$, $\\rho_{s}$ plane.\n", "  Real-life, out-of-laboratory, measurements of pedestrian movements allow\nextensive and fully-resolved statistical analyses. However, data acquisition in\nreal-life is subjected to the wide heterogeneity that characterizes crowd flows\nover time. Disparate flow conditions, such as co-flows and counter-flows at low\nand at high pedestrian densities, typically follow randomly one another. When\nanalysing the data in order to study the dynamics and behaviour of pedestrians\nit is crucial to be able disentangle and to properly select (query) data from\nstatistically homogeneous flow conditions in order to avoid spurious statistics\nand to enable qualitative comparisons. In this paper we extend our previous\nanalysis on the asymmetric pedestrian dynamics on a staircase landing, where we\ncollected a large statistical database of measurements from ad hoc continuous\nrecordings. This contribution has a two-fold aim: first, method-wise, we\ndiscuss two possible approaches to query experimental datasets for homogeneous\nflow conditions. For given flow conditions, we can either agglomerate\nmeasurements on a time-frame basis (Eulerian queries) or on a trajectory basis\n(Lagrangian queries). Second, we employ these two different perspectives to\nfurther explore asymmetries in the pedestrian dynamics in our measurement site.\nWe report cross-comparisons of statistics of pedestrian positions, velocities\nand accelerations vs. flow conditions as well as vs. Eulerian or Lagrangian\napproach.\n", "  In this study, the analysis of the mechanical response of realistic\nfullerene-nanotube nanotruss networks with face-centered cubic geometry is\nperformed by using molecular dynamics with reactive potentials. In particular,\nthe mechanical properties of these novel architectures are investigated in both\ncompressive and tensile regimes, by straining along different directions a\nnumber of truss geometries. Our atomistic simulations reveal a similar behavior\nunder tensile stress for all the samples. Conversely, under compressive regimes\nthe emergence of a response that depends on the orientation of load is observed\ntogether with a peculiar local instability. Due to this instability, some of\nthese nanotruss networks present a negative Poisson ratio in compression, like\nre-entrant foams. Finally, the performance of these nanotruss networks is\nanalyzed with regards to their use as impact energy absorbers, finding\nproperties outperforming materials traditionally used in these applications.\n", "  Most theoretical studies of tunneling in Dirac and the closely related Weyl\nsemimetals have modeled these materials as single Weyl nodes described by the\nthree-dimensional Dirac equation $H = v_f \\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}$. The\ninfluence of scattering between the different valleys centered around different\nWeyl nodes, and the Fermi arc states which connect these nodes are hence not\nevident from these studies. In this work we study the tunneling in a thin film\nsystem of the Dirac semimetal $\\text{Na}_3\\text{Bi}$ consisting of a central\nsegment with a gate potential, sandwiched between identical semi-infinite\nsource and drain segments. The model Hamiltonian we use for\n$\\text{Na}_3\\text{Bi}$ gives, for each spin, two Weyl nodes separated in\n$k$-space symmetrically about $k_z=0$. The presence of a top and bottom surface\nin the thin film geometry results in the appearance of Fermi arc states and\nenergy subbands. We show that (for each spin) the presence of two Weyl nodes\nand the Fermi arc states result in enhanced transmission oscillations, and\nfinite transmission even when the energy falls within the \\textit{bulk} band\ngap in the central segment respectively. These features are not evident in\nsingle Weyl node models.\n", "  Quantum discord in a bipartite system can be dynamically revealed and\nquantified through purely local operations on one of the two subsystems. To\nachieve this, the local detection method harnesses the influence of initial\ncorrelations on the reduced dynamics of an interacting bipartite system. This\narticle's aim is to provide an accessible introduction to this method and to\nreview recent theoretical and experimental progress.\n", "  A NASA sounding rocket for high contrast imaging with a visible nulling\ncoronagraph, the Planet Imaging Coronagraphic Technology Using a Reconfigurable\nExperimental Base (PICTURE-B) payload has made two suborbital attempts to\nobserve the warm dust disk inferred around Epsilon Eridani. We present results\nfrom the November 2015 launch demonstrating active wavefront sensing in space\nwith a piezoelectric mirror stage and a micromachine deformable mirror along\nwith precision pointing and lightweight optics in space.\n", "  In this paper, a new field-normalized indicator is introduced, which is\nrooted in early insights in bibliometrics, and is compared with several\nestablished field-normalized indicators (e.g. the mean normalized citation\nscore, MNCS, and indicators based on percentile approaches). Garfield (1979)\nemphasizes that bare citation counts from different fields cannot be compared\nfor evaluative purposes, because the \"citation potential\" can vary\nsignificantly between the fields. Garfield (1979) suggests that \"the most\naccurate measure of citation potential is the average number of references per\npaper published in a given field\". Based on this suggestion, the new indicator\nis basically defined as follows: the citation count of a focal paper is divided\nby the mean number of cited references in a field to normalize citations. The\nnew indicator is called citation score normalized by cited references (CSNCR).\nThe theoretical analysis of the CSNCR shows that it has the properties of\nconsistency and homogeneous normalization. The close relation of the new\nindicator to the MNCS is discussed. The empirical comparison of the CSNCR with\nother field-normalized indicators shows that it is slightly poorer able to\nfield-normalize citation counts than other cited-side normalized indicators\n(e.g. the MNCS), but its results are favorable compared to two citing-side\nindicator variants (SNCS indicators). Taken as a whole, the results of this\nstudy confirm the ability of established indicators to field-normalize\ncitations.\n", "  The weak bosons are bound states of new constituents. The p-wave excitations\nare studied. The state with the lowest mass is identified with the boson, which\nhas been discovered at the LHC. Specific properties of the excited bosons are\ndiscussed, in particular their decays into weak bosons and photons. The stable\nfermion, consisting of three haplons, provides the dark matter in our universe.\n", "  Employing partially overlapping overhead \\kinectTMS sensors and automatic\npedestrian tracking algorithms we recorded the crowd traffic in a rectilinear\nsection of the main walkway of Eindhoven train station on a 24/7 basis. Beside\ngiving access to the train platforms (it passes underneath the railways), the\nwalkway plays an important connection role in the city. Several crowding\nscenarios occur during the day, including high- and low-density dynamics in\nuni- and bi-directional regimes. In this paper we discuss our recording\ntechnique and we illustrate preliminary data analyses. Via fundamental\ndiagrams-like representations we report pedestrian velocities and fluxes vs.\npedestrian density. Considering the density range $0$ - $1.1\\,$ped/m$^2$, we\nfind that at densities lower than $0.8\\,$ped/m$^2$ pedestrians in\nunidirectional flows walk faster than in bidirectional regimes. On the\nopposite, velocities and fluxes for even bidirectional flows are higher above\n$0.8\\,$ped/m$^2$.\n", "  Recent empirical work highlights the heterogeneity of social competitions\nsuch as political campaigns: proponents of some ideologies seek debate and\nconversation, others create echo chambers. While symmetric and static network\nstructure is typically used as a substrate to study such competitor dynamics,\nnetwork structure can instead be interpreted as a signature of the competitor\nstrategies, yielding competition dynamics on adaptive networks. Here we\ndemonstrate that tradeoffs between aggressiveness and defensiveness (i.e.,\ntargeting adversaries vs. targeting like-minded individuals) creates\nparadoxical behaviour such as non-transitive dynamics. And while there is an\noptimal strategy in a two competitor system, three competitor systems have no\nsuch solution; the introduction of extreme strategies can easily affect the\noutcome of a competition, even if the extreme strategies have no chance of\nwinning. Not only are these results reminiscent of classic paradoxical results\nfrom evolutionary game theory, but the structure of social networks created by\nour model can be mapped to particular forms of payoff matrices. Consequently,\nsocial structure can act as a measurable metric for social games which in turn\nallows us to provide a game theoretical perspective on online political\ndebates.\n", "  In this work we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the surface states of a\nhollow topological insulator (TI) nanotube with finite width walls. Unlike a\nsolid TI cylinder, a TI nanotube possesses both an inner as well as outer\nsurface on which the states localized at each surface are coupled together. The\ncurvature along the circumference of the nanotube leads to a spatial variation\nof the spin orbit interaction field experienced by the charge carriers as well\nas an asymmetry between the inner and outer surfaces of the nanotube. Both of\nthese features result in terms in the effective Hamiltonian for a TI nanotube\nabsent in that of a flat TI thin film of the same thickness. We calculate the\nnumerical values of the parameters for a \\ce{Bi2Se3} nanotube as a function of\nthe inner and outer radius, and show that the differing relative magnitudes\nbetween the parameters result in qualitatively differing behaviour for the\neigenstates of tubes of different dimensions.\n", "  Population-wide oscillations are ubiquitously observed in mesoscopic signals\nof cortical activity. In these network states a global oscillatory cycle\nmodulates the propensity of neurons to fire. Synchronous activation of neurons\nhas been hypothesized to be a separate channel of signal processing information\nin the brain. A salient question is therefore if and how oscillations interact\nwith spike synchrony and in how far these channels can be considered separate.\nExperiments indeed showed that correlated spiking co-modulates with the static\nfiring rate and is also tightly locked to the phase of beta-oscillations. While\nthe dependence of correlations on the mean rate is well understood in\nfeed-forward networks, it remains unclear why and by which mechanisms\ncorrelations tightly lock to an oscillatory cycle. We here demonstrate that\nsuch correlated activation of pairs of neurons is qualitatively explained by\nperiodically-driven random networks. We identify the mechanisms by which\ncovariances depend on a driving periodic stimulus. Mean-field theory combined\nwith linear response theory yields closed-form expressions for the\ncyclostationary mean activities and pairwise zero-time-lag covariances of\nbinary recurrent random networks. Two distinct mechanisms cause time-dependent\ncovariances: the modulation of the susceptibility of single neurons (via the\nexternal input and network feedback) and the time-varying variances of single\nunit activities. For some parameters, the effectively inhibitory recurrent\nfeedback leads to resonant covariances even if mean activities show\nnon-resonant behavior. Our analytical results open the question of\ntime-modulated synchronous activity to a quantitative analysis.\n", "  The electric field effect is a useful means of elucidating intrinsic material\nproperties as well as for designing functional devices. The\nelectric-double-layer transistor (EDLT) enables the control of carrier density\nin a wide range, which is recently proved to be an effective tool for the\ninvestigation of thermoelectric properties. Here, we report the gate-tuning of\nthermoelectric power in a black phosphorus (BP) single crystal flake with the\nthickness of 40 nm. Using an EDLT configuration, we successfully control the\nthermoelectric power (S), and find that the S of ion-gated BP reached +510\n$\\mu$V/K at 210 K in the hole depleted state, which is much higher than the\nreported bulk single crystal value of +340 $\\mu$V/K at 300 K. We compared this\nexperimental data with the first-principles-based calculation and found that\nthis enhancement is qualitatively explained by the effective thinning of the\nconduction channel of the BP flake and non-uniformity of the channel owing to\nthe gate operation in a depletion mode. Our results provide new opportunities\nfor further engineering BP as a thermoelectric material in nanoscale.\n", "  This paper considers the yielding response of a neutron star crust to smooth,\nunbalanced Maxwell stresses imposed at the core-crust boundary, and the\ncoupling of the dynamic crust to the external magnetic field. Stress buildup\nand yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion\nradiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase\nthe creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to\nbe possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal\nconduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and\ntime-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is\ndeveloped. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst\ntimescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant\nmagnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying\npower-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized\nsub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust. A one-dimensional model of\nstress relaxation in the vertically stratified crust shows that a modest\nincrease in applied stress allows embedded magnetic shear to escape the star\nover $\\sim$ 3-10 ms, dissipating greater energy if the exterior field is\nalready sheared. Several such zones coupled to each other naturally yield a\nburst of duration $\\sim$ 0.1 s, as is observed over a wide range of burst\nenergies. The collective interaction of many plastic zones forces an\noverstability of global elastic modes of the crust, consistent with QPO\nactivity extending over $\\gtrsim$ 100 s. Giant flares probably involve sudden\nmeltdown in localized zones, with high-frequency ($\\gg$ 100 Hz) QPOs\ncorresponding to standing Alfv\\'en waves within these zones.\n", "  We report results of an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves with\nfrequency between 50 and 510 Hz from isolated compact objects, i.e. neutron\nstars. A new hierarchical multi-stage approach is taken, supported by the\ncomputing power of the Einstein@Home project, allowing to probe more deeply\nthan ever before. 16 million sub-threshold candidates from the initial search\n[LVC,arXiv:1606.09619] are followed up in three stages. None of those\ncandidates is consistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 90%\nconfidence level upper limits are placed on the amplitudes of continuous waves\nfrom the target population. Between 170.5 and 171 Hz we set the most\nconstraining 90% confidence upper limit on the strain amplitude h0 at 4.3x10-25\n, while at the high end of our frequency range we achieve an upper limit of\n7.6x10-25. These are the most constraining all-sky upper limits to date and\nconstrain the ellipticity of rotating compact objects emitting at 300 Hz at a\ndistance D to less than 6x10-7 [d/100pc].\n", "  We provide the exact non-Markovian master equation for a two-level system\ninteracting with a thermal bosonic bath, and we write the solution of such a\nmaster equation in terms of the Bloch vector. We show that previous\napproximated results are particular limits of our exact master equation. We\ngeneralize these results to more complex systems involving an arbitrary number\nof two-level systems coupled to different thermal baths, providing the exact\nmaster equations also for these systems. As an example of this general case we\nderive the master equation for the Jaynes-Cummings model.\n", "  In atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), reduced\ndielectric screening of the Coulomb interaction leads to strongly correlated\nmany-body states, including excitons and trions, that dominate the optical\nproperties. Higher-order states, such as bound biexcitons, are possible but are\ndifficult to identify unambiguously using linear optical spectroscopy methods\nalone. Here, we implement polarization-resolved two-dimensional coherent\nspectroscopy to unravel the complex optical response of monolayer MoSe$_2$ and\nidentify multiple higher-order correlated states. Decisive signatures of\nneutral and charged inter-valley biexcitons appear in cross-polarized\ntwo-dimensional spectra as distinct resonances with respective ~20 meV and ~5\nmeV binding energies--similar to recent calculations using variational and\nMonte Carlo methods. A theoretical model taking into account the\nvalley-dependent optical selection rules reveals the specific quantum pathways\nthat give rise to these states. Inter-valley biexcitons identified here,\ncomprised of neutral and charged excitons from different valleys, offer new\nopportunities for creating exotic exciton-polariton condensates and for\ndeveloping ultrathin biexciton lasers and polarization-entangled photon\nsources.\n", "  The harmonics effect on ion-bulk (IBk) waves has been researched by Vlasov\nsimulation. The condition of excitation of a large-amplitude IBk waves is given\nto explain the phenomenon of strong short-wavelength electrostatic activity in\nsolar wind. When $k$ is much lower than $k_{lor}/2$ ($k_{lor}$ is the wave\nnumber at loss-of-resonance point), the IBk waves will not be excited to a\nlarge amplitude, because a large part of energy will be spread to harmonics.\nThe nature of nonlinear IBk waves in the condition of $k<k_{lor}/2$ is undamped\nBernstein-Greene-Kruskal-like waves with harmonics superposition. Only when the\nwave number $k$ of IBk waves satisfies $k_{lor}/2\\lesssim k\\leq k_{lor}$, can a\nlarge-amplitude and mono-frequency IBk wave be excited. These results give a\nguidance for a novel scattering mechanism related to IBk waves in the field of\nlaser plasma interaction.\n", "  We introduce a minimalistic quantum motor for coupled energy and particle\ntransport. The system is composed of two spins, each coupled to a different\nbath and to a particle which can move on a ring consisting of three sites. We\nshow that the energy flowing from the baths to the system can be partially\nconverted to perform work against an external driving, even in the presence of\nmoderate dissipation. We also analytically demonstrate the necessity of\ncoupling between the spins. We suggest an experimental realization of our model\nusing trapped ions or quantum dots.\n", "  Properties of particles in Kerr metric are compared with properties of\nparticles in rotating coordinates in Minkowski space-time. It is shown that\nparticles with negative and zero energies existing in the ergosphere of the\nrotating black hole also exist in the region out of the static limit in\nrotating coordinates in Minkowski space-time. Some similarities like the\nPenrose process and differences in both cases are analyzed.\n", "  We present a feedback protocol that is able to confine a system to a single\nmicro-state without heat dissipation. The protocol adjusts the Hamiltonian of\nthe system in such a way that the Bayesian posterior distribution after\nmeasurement is in equilibrium. As a result, the whole process satisfies\nfeedback reversibility -- the process is indistinguishable from its time\nreversal -- and assures the lowest possible dissipation for confinement. In\nspite of the whole process being reversible it can surprisingly be implemented\nin finite time. We illustrate the idea with a Brownian particle in a harmonic\ntrap with increasing stiffness and present a general theory of reversible\nfeedback confinement for systems with discrete states.\n", "  Miniaturized heat engines constitutes a fascinating field of current\nresearch. They are being studied theoretically as well as experimentally, with\nexperiments involving colloidal particles and harmonic traps and even bacterial\nbaths acting like thermal baths. They are interesting to study because usual\nequilibrium thermodynamic notions can not be applied directly to these systems.\nThese systems are micron sized or even smaller and they are subjected to laud\nthermal fluctuations. Thus one needs to study the behavior of such systems in\nterms of these fluctuations. Average thermodynamic quantities like work done,\nheat exchanged, efficiency loose meaning unless otherwise supported by their\nfull probability distributions. Earlier studies on micro-engines are concerned\nwith applying Carnot or Stirling engine protocols to miniaturized systems,\nwhere system undergoes typical two isothermal and two adiabatic changes. Unlike\nthese models we for the first time, study a prototype system of two classical\nIsing spins driven by time dependent, phase different, external magnetic\nfields. These spins are {\\it simultaneously} in contact with two heat\nreservoirs at different temperatures for the full duration of the driving\nprotocol. Performance of the model as an engine or a refrigerator depends only\non a single parameter namely the phase between two external drivings. We study\nthis system in terms of fluctuations in efficiency and coefficient of\nperformance (COP). We also find full distributions of these quantities\nnumerically and also study the tails of these distributions. We also study\nreliability of this engine. We find the fluctuations dominate mean values of\nefficiency and COP and their probability distributions are broad with power law\ntails.\n", "  Analyzing pseudo-telepathy graph games, we propose a way to build\ncontextuality scenarios exhibiting the quantum supremacy using graph states. We\nconsider the combinatorial structures that generate equivalent scenarios. We\nintroduce a new tool called multipartiteness width to investigate which\nscenarios are harder to decompose and show that there exist graphs generating\nscenarios with a linear multipartiteness width.\n", "  The detailed characterization of non-trivial coherence properties of\ncomposite quantum systems of increasing size is an indispensable prerequisite\nfor scalable quantum computation, as well as for understanding of\nnonequilibrium many-body physics. Here we show how autocorrelation functions in\nan interacting system of phonons as well as the quantum discord between\ndistinct degrees of freedoms can be extracted from a small controllable part of\nthe system. As a benchmark, we show this in chains of up to 42 trapped ions, by\ntracing a single phonon excitation through interferometric measurements of only\na single ion in the chain. We observe the spreading and partial refocusing of\nthe excitation in the chain, even on a background of thermal excitations. We\nfurther show how this local observable reflects the dynamical evolution of\nquantum discord between the electronic state and the vibrational degrees of\nfreedom of the probe ion.\n", "  We have studied the collective motion of polar active particles confined to\nellipsoidal surfaces. The geometric constraints lead to the formation of\nvortices that encircle surface points of constant curvature (umbilics). We have\nfound that collective motion patterns are particularly rich on ellipsoids, with\nfour umbilics where vortices tend to be located near pairs of umbilical points\nto minimize their interaction energy. Our results provide a new perspective on\nthe migration of living cells, which most likely use the information provided\nfrom the curved substrate geometry to guide their collective motion.\n", "  In this paper, we first obtain the ($n+1$)-dimensional dilaton-Lifshitz black\nhole (BH) solutions in the presence of Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics. We\nfind that there are two different solutions for $z=n+1$ and $z\\neq n+1$ cases\n($z$ is dynamical critical exponent). We show that the thermodynamics first law\nis satisfied for both cases. Then, we turn to study different phase transitions\n(PTs) for our BHs. We start with study of Hawking-Page PT for both linearly and\nBI charged BHs. After that, we discuss the PTs inside the BHs. We present the\nimproved Davies quantities and prove that the PT points shown by them coincide\nwith Ruppeiner ones. We show that the zero temperature PTs are transitions on\nradiance properties of BHs by using Landau-Lifshitz theory. Next, we turn to\nstudy Ruppeiner geometry of linearly and BI charged BHs. For linearly charged\ncase, we show that there are no PT at finite temperature for the case $z\\geq\n2$. For $z<2$, it is found that the number of finite temperature PT points\ndepends on the value of BH charge and is not more than two. When we have two\nfinite temperature PT points, there are no thermally stable BH between these\ntwo points and we have discontinues small/large BH PTs. As expected, for small\nBHs, we observe finite magnitude for Ruppeiner invariant which shows the finite\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules while for large BHs, the correlation\nis very small. Finally, we study the Ruppeiner geometry and thermal stability\nof BI charged Lifshtiz BHs for different values of $z$. We observe that small\nBHs are thermally unstable in some situations. Also, the behavior of\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules for large BHs is the same as linearly\ncharged case. In both linearly and BI charged cases, for some choices of\nparameters, the BH systems behave like a Van der Waals gas near transition\npoint.\n", "  The coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for the g.s. of the three-species\ncondensates (3-BEC) have been solved analytically under the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation. Six types of spatial configurations in miscible phase are found.\nThe whole parameter-space has been divided into zones each supports a specific\nconfiguration (miscible or immiscible). The borders of the zones are described\nby analytical formulae. Due to the division, the variation of the spatial\nconfiguration against the parameters can be visualized, and the effects of the\nparameters can be thereby understood. There are regions in the parameter-space\nwhere the configuration is highly sensitive to the parameters. These regions\nare tunable and valuable for the determination of the parameters.\n", "  Claude Francis Milliet Dechales described the Coriolis effect in his 1674\nCursus seu Mundus Mathematicus. Dechales discussed and illustrated the\ndeflection of both falling bodies and of projectiles launched toward the poles\nthat should occur on a rotating Earth. Interestingly, this was done as an\nargument against the Earth's rotation, the deflections not having been observed\nat the time. Dechales's work follows on that of Giovanni Battista Riccioli, who\nhad also described the effect in his Almagestum Novum of 1651.\n", "  We consider a nonlinear evolution equation for complex-valued functions of a\nreal positive time variable and a p-adic spatial variable. This equation is a\nnon-Archimedean counterpart of the fractional porous medium equation.\nDeveloping, as a tool, an $L^1$-theory of Vladimirov's p-adic fractional\ndifferentiation operator, we prove m-accretivity of the appropriate nonlinear\noperator, thus obtaining the existence and uniqueness of a mild solution. We\ngive also an example of an explicit solution of the p-adic porous medium\nequation.\n", "  Lorentz gauge theory of gravity was recently introduced. We study the\nhomogeneous and isotropic universe of this theory. It is shown that some time\nafter the matter in the universe is diluted enough, at $z \\sim 0.6$, the\ndecelerating expansion shifts spontaneously to an accelerating one without a\ndark energy. We discuss that Lorentz gauge theory puts no constraint on the\ntotal energy content of the universe at present time and therefore the\nmagnitude of vacuum energy predicted by field theory is not contradictory\nanymore. It is demonstrated that in this theory the limit on the number of\nrelativistic particles in the universe is much looser than in GR. An\ninflationary mechanism is discussed as well. We show that the theory, unlike\nGR, does not require the slow-roll or similar conditions to drive the inflation\nat the beginning of the universe.\n", "  Porous graphene structures, also termed graphene nanomeshes (GNMs), are\ngarnering increasing interest due to their potential application to important\ntechnologies such as chemical sensing, ion-filtration, and nanoelectronics.\nSemiconducting GNMs designed to have fractional eV band gaps are good\ncandidates for graphene-based electronics, provided that a mechanism for their\nstable and controlled doping is developed. Recent work has shown that\ncontrolled passivation of the edges of subnanometer pores and subsequent doping\nby atoms or molecules gives rise to {\\it p}- and {\\it n}-doped GNM structures.\nHowever, these structures are difficult to fabricate at the nanoscale. Here, we\nuse first principle calculations to study the effect of the pore size on the\ndoping physics of GNM structures with larger pores that can potentially host\nmore than a single dopant. We show that such doping mechanism is effective even\nfor pores with relatively large radii. We also study the effect of the number\nof dopants per pore on doping stability. We find that stable rigid band {\\it\nn}- and {\\it p}-doping emerges in such structures even if the dopants form a\nnano-cluster in the pore - rigid band doping is achieved in all {\\it n}- and\n{\\it p}-doping studied. Such doped large-pore GNM structures have potential\napplications as field effect transistors, and as transparent conducting\nelectrodes.\n", "  Stochasticity can play an important role in the dynamics of biologically\nrelevant populations. These span a broad range of scales: from intra-cellular\npopulations of molecules to population of cells and then to groups of plants,\nanimals and people. Large deviations in stochastic population dynamics - such\nas those determining population extinction, fixation or switching between\ndifferent states - are presently in a focus of attention of statistical\nphysicists. We review recent progress in applying different variants of\ndissipative WKB approximation (after Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin) to this\nclass of problems. The WKB approximation allows one to evaluate the mean time\nand/or probability of population extinction, fixation and switches resulting\nfrom either intrinsic (demographic) noise, or a combination of the demographic\nnoise and environmental variations, deterministic or random. We mostly cover\nwell-mixed populations, single and multiple, but also briefly consider\npopulations on heterogeneous networks and spatial populations. The spatial\nsetting also allows one to study large fluctuations of the speed of biological\ninvasions. Finally, we briefly discuss possible directions of future work.\n", "  We briefly discuss the intriguing case of a phenomenological\nnon-gravitational coupling in the dark sector, where the interaction is\nparameterized as an energy transfer either from dark matter to dark energy or\nthe opposite. We show that a non-zero coupling with an energy flow from the\nlatter to the former leads to a full reconciliation of the tension between\nhigh- and low-redshift observations present in the standard cosmological model.\n", "  The security of quantum key distribution protocols hinges upon features of\nphysical systems that are uniquely quantum in nature. We explore the role of\nquantumness as qualified by quantum contextuality, in quantum key distribution\nschemes. We present a new quantum key distribution protocol whose security\ndepends uponthe KCBS inequality and contextuality monogamy. We explicitly\ncalculate the key rate, error rate introduced between Alice-Bob communication\ndue to the presence of Eve, and the information-gain by Eve. This protocol\nprovides a new framework for quantum key distribution which has conceptual and\npractical advantages over other quantum protocols.\n", "  Quantum computing has undergone rapid development in recent years. Owing to\nlimitations on scalability, personal quantum computers still seem slightly\nunrealistic in the near future. The first practical quantum computer for\nordinary users is likely to be on the cloud. However, the adoption of cloud\ncomputing is possible only if security is ensured. Homomorphic encryption is a\ncryptographic protocol that allows computation to be performed on encrypted\ndata without decrypting them, so it is well suited to cloud computing. Here, we\nfirst applied homomorphic encryption on IBM's cloud quantum computer platform.\nIn our experiments, we successfully implemented a quantum algorithm for linear\nequations while protecting our privacy. This demonstration opens a feasible\npath to the next stage of development of cloud quantum information technology.\n", "  Stochastic unravelings represent a useful tool to describe the dynamics of\nopen quantum systems and standard methods, such as quantum state diffusion\n(QSD), call for the complete positivity of the open-system dynamics. Here, we\npresent a generalization of QSD, which also applies to positive, but not\ncompletely positive evolutions. The rate and the action of the diffusive\nprocesses involved in the unraveling are obtained by applying a proper\ntransformation to the operators which define the master equation. The\nunraveling is first defined for semigroup dynamics and then extended to a\ndefinite class of time-dependent generators. We test our approach on a\nprototypical model for the description of exciton transfer, keeping track of\nrelevant phenomena, which are instead disregarded within the standard,\ncompletely positive framework.\n", "  We propose a new model to create a light meson in the heavy quarkonium\ntransition, which is inspired by the Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Hadronic\ntransitions of $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ higher charmonia with the emission of an $\\eta$\nmeson are studied in the framework of the proposed model. The model shows its\npotential to reproduce the observed decay widths and make predictions for the\nunobserved channels. We present our predictions for the decay width of $\\Psi\n\\to J/\\psi \\eta$ and $\\Psi \\to h_{c}(1P)\\eta$, where $\\Psi$ are higher $S$ and\n$D$ wave vector charmonia, which provide useful references to search for higher\ncharmonia and determine their properties in forthcoming experiments. The\npredicted branching fraction $\\mathcal B(\\psi(4415)\\to\nh_{c}(1P)\\eta)=4.62\\times 10^{-4}$ is one order of magnitude smaller than the\n$J/\\psi \\eta$ channel. Estimates of partial decay width $\\Gamma(Y \\to J/\\psi\n\\eta)$ are given for $Y(4360)$, $Y(4390)$ and $Y(4660)$ by assuming them as\n$c\\bar{c}$ bound states with quantum numbers $3 ^3D_1$, $3 ^3D_1$ and $5\n^3S_1$, respectively. Our results are in favor of these assignments for\n$Y(4360)$ and $Y(4660)$. The corresponding experimental data for these $Y$\nstates has large statistical errors which do not provide any constraint on the\nmixing angle if we introduce $S-D$ mixing. To identify $Y(4390)$, precise\nmeasurements on its hadronic branching fraction are required which are eagerly\nawaited from BESIII.\n", "  Mesoscopic quantum superpositions, or Schr\\\"odinger cat states, are widely\nstudied for fundamental investigations of quantum measurement and decoherence\nas well as applications in sensing and quantum information science. The\ngeneration and maintenance of such states relies upon a balance between\nefficient external coherent control of the system and sufficient isolation from\nthe environment. Here we create a variety of cat states of a single trapped\natom's motion in a harmonic oscillator using ultrafast laser pulses. These\npulses produce high fidelity impulsive forces that separate the atom into\nwidely-separated positions, without restrictions that typically limit the speed\nof the interaction or the size and complexity of the resulting motional\nsuperposition. This allows us to quickly generate and measure cat states larger\nthan previously achieved in a harmonic oscillator, and create complex\nmulti-component superposition states in atoms.\n", "  We express modular and weak values of observables of three- and higher-level\nquantum systems in their polar form. The Majorana representation of N-level\nsystems in terms of symmetric states of N-1 qubits provides us with a\ndescription on the Bloch sphere. With this geometric approach, we find that\nmodular and weak values of observables of N-level quantum systems can be\nfactored in N-1 contributions. Their modulus is determined by the product of\nN-1 ratios involving projection probabilities between qubits, while their\nargument is deduced from a sum of N-1 solid angles on the Bloch sphere. These\ntheoretical results allow us to study the geometric origin of the quantum phase\ndiscontinuity around singularities of weak values in three-level systems. We\nalso analyze the three-box paradox [1] from the point of view of a bipartite\nquantum system. In the Majorana representation of this paradox, an observer\ncomes to opposite conclusions about the entanglement state of the particles\nthat were successfully pre- and postselected.\n", "  We study by means of bulk and local probes the d-metal alloy Ni$_{1-x}$V$_x$\nclose to the quantum critical concentration, $x_c \\approx 11.6\\%$, where the\nferromagnetic transition temperature vanishes. The magnetization-field curve in\nthe ferromagnetic phase takes an anomalous power-law form with a nonuniversal\nexponent that is strongly $x$-dependent and mirrors the behavior in the\nparamagnetic phase. Muon spin rotation experiments demonstrate inhomogeneous\nmagnetic order and indicate the presence of dynamic fluctuating magnetic\nclusters. These results provide strong evidence for a quantum Griffiths phase\non the ferromagnetic side of the quantum phase transition.\n", "  Imaginary potential and entropic force represent different mechanisms for\nmelting the heavy quarkonium. In this paper, we study the chemical potential\neffect on these two quantities with respect to a moving quarkonium from the\nAdS/CTF duality. We observe that for both mechanisms the chemical potential has\nthe same effect: the presence of the chemical potential tends to decrease the\ndissociation length.\n", "  We give a quantum algorithm for finding a marked element on the grid when\nthere are multiple marked elements. Our algorithm uses quadratically fewer\nsteps than a random walk on the grid, ignoring logarithmic factors. This is the\nfirst known quantum walk that finds a marked element in a number of steps less\nthan the square-root of the extended hitting time. We also give a new tighter\nupper bound on the extended hitting time of a marked subset, expressed in terms\nof the hitting times of its members.\n", "  We elaborate on Abelian complex scalar models, which are dictated by natural\nactions (all couplings are of order one), at fixed and large global $U(1)$\ncharge in an arbitrary number of dimensions. The ground state $|\n\\upsilon\\rangle$ is coherently constructed by the zero modes and the appearance\nof a centrifugal potential is quantum mechanically verified. Using the path\nintegral formulation we systematically analyze the quantum fluctuations around\n$| \\upsilon\\rangle$ in order to derive an effective action for the Goldstone\nmode, which becomes perturbatively meaningful when the charge is large. In this\nregime we explicitly show that the whole construction is stable against quantum\ncorrections, in the sense that any higher derivative couplings to Goldstone's\ntree-level action are suppressed by appropriate powers of the large charge.\n", "  It has become customary to use a smoothing algorithm called \"gradient flow\"\nto fix the lattice spacing in a simulation, through a parameter called $t_0$.\nIt is shown that in order to keep the length $t_0$ fixed with respect to\nmesonic or gluonic observables as the number of colors $N_c$ is varied, the\nfiducial point for the flow parameter must be scaled nearly linearly in $N_c$.\nIn simulations with dynamical fermions, the dependence of $t_0$ on the\npseudoscalar meson mass flattens as the number of colors rises, in a way which\nis consistent with large $N_c$ expectations.\n", "  The quantum spin liquid material herbertsmithite is described by an\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice with non-negligible\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction~(DMI). A well established phase transition to\nthe $\\mathbf q=0$ long-range order occurs in this model when the DMI strength\nincreases, but the precise nature of a small-DMI phase remains controversial.\nHere, we describe a new phase obtained from Schwinger-boson mean-field theory\nthat is stable at small DMI, and which can explain the dispersionless spectrum\nseen in inelastic neutron scattering experiment by Han et al (Nature (London)\n492, 406 (2012)}). It is a time-reversal symmetry breaking $\\mathbb Z_2$ spin\nliquid, with the unique property of a small and constant spin gap in an\nextended region of the Brillouin zone. The phase diagram as a function of DMI\nand spin size is given, and dynamical spin structure factors are presented.\n", "  Poynting's theorem is used to obtain an expression for the turbulent\npower-spectral density as function of frequency and wavenumber in low-frequency\nmagnetic turbulence. No reference is made to Elsasser variables as is usually\ndone in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence mixing mechanical and electromagnetic\nturbulence. We rather stay with an implicit form of the mechanical part of\nturbulence as suggested by electromagnetic theory in arbitrary media. All of\nmechanics and flows is included into a turbulent response function which by\nappropriate observations can be determined from knowledge of the turbulent\nfluctuation spectra. This approach is not guided by the wish of developing a\ncomplete theory of turbulence. It aims on the identification of the response\nfunction from observations as input into a theory which afterwards attempts its\ninterpretation. Combination of both the magnetic and electric power spectral\ndensities leads to a representation of the turbulent response function, i.e.\nthe turbulent conductivity spectrum $\\sigma_{\\omega k}$ as function of\nfrequency $\\omega$ and wavenumber $k$. {It is given as the ratio of magnetic to\nelectric power spectral densities in frequency space. This knowledge allows for\nformally writing down a turbulent dispersion relation. Power law inertial range\nspectra result in a power law turbulent conductivity spectrum. These can be\ncompared with observations in the solar wind. Keywords: MHD turbulence,\nturbulent dispersion relation, turbulent response function, solar wind\nturbulence\n", "  Large-deviations theory deals with tails of probability distributions and the\nrare events of random processes, for example spreading packets of particles.\nMathematically, it concerns the exponential fall-of of the density of\nthin-tailed systems. Here we investigate the spatial density $P_t(x)$ of laser\ncooled atoms, where at intermediate length scales the shape is fat-tailed. We\nfocus on the rare events beyond this range, which dominate important\nstatistical properties of the system. Through a novel friction mechanism\ninduced by the laser fields, the density is explored with the recently proposed\nnonnormalized infinite-covariant density approach. The small and large\nfluctuations give rise to a bi-fractal nature of the spreading packet.\n", "  The venerable phenomena of Anderson localization, along with the much more\nrecent many-body localization, both depend crucially on the presence of\ndisorder. The latter enters either in the form of quenched disorder in the\nparameters of the Hamiltonian, or through a special choice of a disordered\ninitial state. Here we present a model with localization arising in a very\nsimple, completely translationally invariant quantum model, with only local\ninteractions between spins and fermions. By identifying an extensive set of\nconserved quantities, we show that the system generates purely dynamically its\nown disorder, which gives rise to localization of fermionic degrees of freedom.\nOur work gives an answer to a decades old question whether quenched disorder is\na necessary condition for localization. It also offers new insights into the\nphysics of many-body localization, lattice gauge theories, and quantum\ndisentangled liquids.\n", "  In this paper, we study the multiplicative behaviour of quantum channels,\nmathematically described by trace preserving, completely positive maps on\nmatrix algebras. It turns out that the multiplicative domain of a unital\nquantum channel has a close connection to its spectral properties. A structure\ntheorem, which reveals the automorphic property of an arbitrary unital quantum\nchannel on a subalgebra, is presented. Various classes of quantum channels\n(irreducible, primitive etc.) are then analysed in terms of this stabilising\nsubalgebra. The notion of the multiplicative index of a unital quantum channel\nis introduced, which measures the number of times a unital channel needs to be\ncomposed with itself for the multiplicative algebra to stabilise. We show that\nthe maps that have trivial multiplicative domains are dense in completely\nbounded norm topology in the set of all unital completely positive maps. Some\napplications in quantum information theory are discussed.\n", "  We explicitly calculate the gravitational wave memory effect for classical\npoint particle sources in linearized gravity off of an even dimensional\nMinkowski background. We show that there is no memory effect in $d>4$\ndimensions, in agreement with the general analysis of Hollands, Ishibashi, and\nWald (2016).\n", "  As machine learning algorithms become increasingly sophisticated to exploit\nsubtle features of the data, they often become more dependent on simulations.\nThis paper presents a new approach called weakly supervised classification in\nwhich class proportions are the only input into the machine learning algorithm.\nUsing one of the most challenging binary classification tasks in high energy\nphysics - quark versus gluon tagging - we show that weakly supervised\nclassification can match the performance of fully supervised algorithms.\nFurthermore, by design, the new algorithm is insensitive to any mis-modeling of\ndiscriminating features in the data by the simulation. Weakly supervised\nclassification is a general procedure that can be applied to a wide variety of\nlearning problems to boost performance and robustness when detailed simulations\nare not reliable or not available.\n", "  Using multiwavelets, we have obtained total energies and corresponding\natomization energies for the GGA-PBE and hybrid-PBE0 density functionals for a\ntest set of 211 molecules with an unprecedented and guaranteed $\\mu$Hartree\naccuracy. These quasi-exact references allow us to quantify the accuracy of\nstandard all-electron basis sets that are believed to be highly accurate for\nmolecules, such as Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), all-electron numeric\natom-centered orbitals (NAOs) and full-potential augmented plane wave (APW)\nmethods. We show that NAOs are able to achieve the so-called chemical accuracy\n(1 kcal/mol) for the typical basis set sizes used in applications, for both\ntotal and atomization energies. For GTOs, a triple-zeta quality basis has mean\nerrors of ~10kcal/mol in total energies, while chemical accuracy is almost\nreached for a quintuple-zeta basis. Due to systematic error cancellations,\natomization energy errors are reduced by almost an order of magnitude, placing\nchemical accuracy within reach also for medium to large GTO bases, albeit with\nsignificant outliers. In order to check the accuracy of the computed densities,\nwe have also investigated the dipole moments, where in general, only the\nlargest NAO and GTO bases are able to yield errors below 0.01 Debye. The\nobserved errors are similar across the different functionals considered here.\n", "  The model describing interaction between two-level atoms and a single mode\nfield in an optical cavity enclosed by a medium with Kerr nonlinearity is\nconsidered in our paper. We study the model within the framework of the\nanalytical solution obtained by application of the quantum inverse method\n(QIM). The dynamic correlation functions are calculated and transition elements\nof photons are represented in the determinant form. The obtained answers depend\non the solutions of Bethe equations. We provide the numerical solutions of\nthese equations for the different parameters of the model and study the\nbehaviour of certain dynamical correlation functions.\n", "  The propagation characteristics of small-amplitude dust-acoustic (DA)\nsolitary waves (SWs) and shocks are studied in an unmagnetized dusty plasma\nwith a pair of trapped positive and negative ions. Using the standard reductive\nperturbation technique with two different scaling of stretched coordinates, the\nevolution equations for DA SWs and shocks are derived in the forms of complex\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) and complex Burgers' equations. The effects of dust\ncharge variation, the dust thermal pressure, and the ratios of positive to\nnegative ion number densities as well as the free to trapped ion temperatures\non the profiles of SWs and shocks are analysed and discussed.\n", "  We study the nonlinear propagation of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) in an\nunmagnetized collisionless plasma with the effects of electron and ion Landau\ndamping in the weak quantum (semiclassical) regime, i.e., when the typical\nion-acoustic (IA) length scale is larger than the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength. Starting from a set of classical and semiclassical Vlasov equations\nfor ions and electrons, coupled to the Poisson equation, we derive a modified\n(by the particle dispersion) Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation which governs the\nevolution of IAWs with the effects of wave-particle resonance. It is found that\nin contrast to the classical results, the nonlinear IAW speed $(\\lambda)$ and\nthe linear Landau damping rate $(\\gamma)$ are no longer constants, but can vary\nwith the wave number $(k)$ due to the quantum particle dispersion. The effects\nof the quantum parameter $H$ (the ratio of the plasmon energy to the thermal\nenergy) and the electron to ion temperature ratio $(T)$ on the profiles of\n$\\lambda$, $\\gamma$ and the solitary wave amplitude are also studied. It is\nshown that the decay rate of the wave amplitude is reduced by the effects of\n$H$.\n", "  The learning rate is an information-theoretical quantity for bipartite Markov\nchains describing two coupled subsystems. It is defined as the rate at which\ntransitions in the downstream subsystem tend to increase the mutual information\nbetween the two subsystems, and is bounded by the dissipation arising from\nthese transitions. Its physical interpretation, however, is unclear, although\nit has been used as a metric for the sensing performance of the downstream\nsubsystem. In this paper, we explore the behaviour of the learning rate for a\nnumber of simple model systems, establishing when and how its behaviour is\ndistinct from the instantaneous mutual information between subsystems. In the\nsimplest case, the two are almost equivalent. In more complex steady-state\nsystems, the mutual information and the learning rate behave qualitatively\ndistinctly, with the learning rate clearly now reflecting the rate at which the\ndownstream system must update its information in response to changes in the\nupstream system. It is not clear whether this quantity is the most natural\nmeasure for sensor performance, and, indeed, we provide an example in which\noptimising the learning rate over a region of parameter space of the downstream\nsystem yields an apparently sub-optimal sensor.\n", "  As one of the simple alkali metals, sodium has been of fundamental interest\nfor shock physics experiments, but knowledge of its equation of state (EOS) in\nhot, dense regimes is not well known. By combining path integral Monte Carlo\n(PIMC) results for partially-ionized states [B. Militzer and K. P. Driver,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 115, 176403 (2015)] at high temperatures and density\nfunctional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) results at lower temperatures, we\nhave constructed a coherent equation of state for sodium over a wide\ndensity-temperature range of $1.93-11.60$ g/cm$^{3}$ and $10^3-1.29\\times10^8$\nK. We find that a localized, Hartree-Fock nodal structure in PIMC yields\npressures and internal energies that are consistent with DFT-MD at intermediate\ntemperatures of $2\\times10^6$ K. Since PIMC and DFT-MD provide a\nfirst-principles treatment of electron shell and excitation effects, we are\nable to identify two compression maxima in the shock Hugoniot curve\ncorresponding to $K$-shell and $L$-shell ionization. Our Hugoniot curves\nprovide a benchmark for widely-used EOS models, SESAME, LEOS, and Purgatorio.\nDue to the low ambient density, sodium has an unusually high first compression\nmaximum along the shock Hugoniot curve. At beyond 10$^7$ K, we show that the\nradiation effect leads to very high compression along the Hugoniot curve,\nsurpassing relativistic corrections, and observe an increasing deviation of the\nshock and particle velocities from a linear relation. We also compute the\ntemperature-density dependence of thermal and pressure ionization processes.\n", "  In this paper, we constructed an acoustic thin-shell wormhole (ATW) under\nneo-Newtonian theory using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions. To determine\nthe stability of the ATW by applying the cut-and-paste method, we found the\nsurface density and surface pressure of the ATW under neo-Newtonian\nhydrodynamics just after obtaining an analog acoustic neo-Newtonian solution.\nWe focused on the effects of the neo-Newtonian parameters by performing\nstability analyses using different types of fluids, such as a linear barotropic\nfluid (LBF), a Chaplygin fluid (CF), a logarithmic fluid (LogF), and a\npolytropic fluid (PF). We showed that a fluid with negative energy is required\nat the throat to keep the wormhole stable. The ATW can be stable if suitable\nvalues of the neo-Newtonian parameters $\\varsigma$, $A$, and $B$ are chosen.\n", "  We study BPS jumping loci, or the subloci in moduli spaces of supersymmetric\nstring vacua where BPS states come into existence discontinuously. This\nphenomenon is distinct from wall-crossing. We argue that these loci should be\nthought of as special cycles in the sense of Noether-Lefschetz loci or special\nShimura subvarieties, which are indeed examples of BPS jumping loci for certain\nstring compactifications. We use the Hodge-elliptic genus as an informative\ntool, suggesting that our work can be extended to understand the jumping\nbehavior of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants.\n", "  In this article we investigate the Hawking radiation of vector particles from\nthe apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the\nframework of quantum tunneling method. Furthermore we use Proca equation, a\nrelativistic wave equation for a massive/massless spin-1 particle (massless\n$\\gamma$ photons, weak massive $W^{\\pm}$ and $Z^{0}$ bosons, strong massless\ngluons and $\\rho$ and $\\omega$ mesons) together with a Painlev\\'{e} spacetime\nmetric for the FRW universe. We solve the Proca equation via Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) equation and the WKB approximation method. We recover the same result for\nthe Hawking temperature associated with vector particles as in the case of\nscalar and Dirac particles tunnelled from outside to the inside of the apparent\nhorizon in a FRW universe.\n", "  It has been suggested that high-energy gamma-ray emission ($>100{\\rm MeV}$)\nof nearby star-forming galaxies may be produced predominantly by cosmic rays\ncolliding with the interstellar medium through neutral pion decay. The\npion-decay mechanism predicts a unique spectral signature in the gamma-ray\nspectrum, characterized by a fast rising spectrum and a spectral break below a\nfew hundreds of MeV. We here report the evidence of a spectral break around 500\nMeV in the disk emission of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is found in the\nanalysis of the gamma-ray data extending down to 60 MeV observed by {\\it\nFermi}-Large Area Telescope. The break is well consistent with the pion-decay\nmodel for the gamma-ray emission, although leptonic models, such as the\nelectron bremsstrahlung emission, cannot be ruled out completely.\n", "  Spontaneous, synchronous bursting of neural population is a widely observed\nphenomenon in nervous networks, which is considered important for functions and\ndysfunctions of the brain. However, how the global synchrony across a large\nnumber of neurons emerges from an initially non-bursting network state is not\nfully understood. In this study, we develop a new state-space reconstruction\nmethod combined with high-resolution recordings of cultured neurons. This\nmethod extracts deterministic signatures of upcoming global bursts in \"local\"\ndynamics of individual neurons during non-bursting periods. We find that local\ninformation within a single-cell time series can compare with or even\noutperform the global mean field activity for predicting future global bursts.\nMoreover, the inter-cell variability in the burst predictability is found to\nreflect the network structure realized in the non-bursting periods. These\nfindings demonstrate the deterministic mechanisms underlying the locally\nconcentrated early-warnings of the global state transition in self-organized\nnetworks.\n", "  In the absence of external driving, a system exposed to thermal fluctuations\nwill relax to equilibrium. However, the constant input of work makes it\npossible to counteract this relaxation, and maintain the system in a\nnonequilibrium steady state. In this Article, we use the stochastic\nthermodynamics of Markov jump processes to compute the minimum rate at which\nenergy must be supplied and dissipated to maintain an arbitrary nonequilibrium\ndistribution in a given energy landscape. This lower bound depends on two\nfactors: the undriven probability current in the equilibrium state, and the\ndistance from thermal equilibrium of the target distribution. By showing the\nconsequences of this result in a few simple examples, we suggest general\nimplications for the required energetic costs of macromolecular repair and\ncytosolic protein localization.\n", "  We consider the family of renormalizable scalar QFTs with self-interacting\npotentials of highest monomial $\\phi^{m}$ below their upper critical dimensions\n$d_c=\\frac{2m}{m-2}$, and study them using a combination of CFT constraints,\nSchwinger-Dyson equation and the free theory behavior at the upper critical\ndimension. For even integers $m \\ge 4$ these theories coincide with the\nLandau-Ginzburg description of multi-critical phenomena and interpolate with\nthe unitary minimal models in $d=2$, while for odd $m$ the theories are\nnon-unitary and start at $m=3$ with the Lee-Yang universality class. For all\nthe even potentials and for the Lee-Yang universality class, we show how the\nassumption of conformal invariance is enough to compute the scaling dimensions\nof the local operators $\\phi^k$ and of some families of structure constants in\neither the coupling's or the $\\epsilon$-expansion. For all other odd potentials\nwe express some scaling dimensions and structure constants in the coupling's\nexpansion.\n", "  As an improvement of the QCD sum rule method to study modifications of light\nvector mesons in nuclear matter and/or at finite temperature, we calculate the\nWilson coefficients of all independent gluonic non-scalar operators up to\ndimension 6 in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the vector channel for\nlight quarks. To obtain the gluon part of the light quark OPE from the heavy\nquark one, we also compute the heavy quark expansion of the relevant quark\ncondensates. Together with the results for the quark operators that are already\navailable in the literature, this completes the OPE of the vector channel in a\nhot or dense medium for operators up to dimension 6.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new type of electromagnetic memory. It is a\n`magnetic' type, or B mode, radiation memory effect. Rather than a residual\nvelocity, we find a position displacement of a charged particle induced by the\nB mode radiation with memory. We find two types of electromagnetic displacement\n(ordinary and null). We also show that the null electromagnetic memory formulas\nare nothing but a Fourier transformation of soft photon theorems.\n", "  We demonstrate a practical scalable approach to the fabrication of tunable\nmetamaterials. Designed for THz wavelengths, the metamaterial is comprised of\npolyurethane filled with an array of indium wires using the well-established\nfiber drawing technique. Modification of the dimensions of the metamaterial\nprovides tunability: by compressing the metamaterial we demonstrated a 50%\nplasma frequency shift using THz time domain spectroscopy. Releasing the\ncompression allowed the metamaterial to return to its original dimensions and\nplasma frequency, demonstrating dynamic reversible tunability.\n", "  On an infinite, radial metric tree graph we consider the corresponding\nLaplacian equipped with self-adjoint vertex conditions from a large class\nincluding $\\delta$- and weighted $\\delta'$-couplings. Assuming the numbers of\ndifferent edge lengths, branching numbers and different coupling conditions to\nbe finite, we prove that the presence of absolutely continuous spectrum implies\nthat the sequence of geometric data of the tree as well as the coupling\nconditions are eventually periodic. On the other hand, we provide examples of\nself-adjoint, non-periodic couplings which admit absolutely continuous\nspectrum.\n", "  The cosmic neutrino background is a key prediction of Big Bang cosmology\nwhich has not been observed yet. The movement of the earth through this\nneutrino bath creates a force on a pendulum, as if it was exposed to a cosmic\nwind. We revise here estimates for the resulting pendulum acceleration and\ncompare it to the theoretical sensitivity of an experimental setup where the\npendulum position is measured using current laser interferometer technology as\nemployed in gravitational wave detectors. We discuss how a significant\nimprovement of this setup can be envisaged in a micro gravity environment. The\nproposed setup could simultaneously function as a dark matter detector in the\nsub-MeV range, which currently eludes direct detection constraints.\n", "  We develop a general approach to analytically calculate the perturbations\n$\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}$ of the orbital component of the change\n$\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}$ of the times of arrival of the pulses emitted by a\nbinary pulsar p induced by the post-Keplerian accelerations due to the mass\nquadrupole $Q_2$, and the post-Newtonian gravitoelectric (GE) and\nLense-Thirring (LT) fields. We apply our results to the so-far still\nhypothetical scenario involving a pulsar orbiting the Supermassive Black Hole\nin in the Galactic Center at Sgr A$^\\ast$. We also evaluate the gravitomagnetic\nand quadrupolar Shapiro-like propagation delays $\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{prop}$. By\nassuming the orbit of the existing S2 main sequence star and a time span as\nlong as its orbital period $P_\\textrm{b}$, we obtain\n$\\left|\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^\\textrm{GE}\\right|\\lesssim\n10^3~\\textrm{s},~\\left|\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^\\textrm{LT}\\right|\\lesssim\n0.6~\\textrm{s},\\left|\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^{Q_2}\\right|\\lesssim\n0.04~\\textrm{s}$. Faster $\\left(P_\\textrm{b} = 5~\\textrm{yr}\\right)$ and more\neccentric $\\left(e=0.97\\right)$ orbits would imply net shifts per revolution as\nlarge as\n$\\left|\\left\\langle\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^\\textrm{GE}\\right\\rangle\\right|\\lesssim\n10~\\textrm{Ms},~\\left|\\left\\langle\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^\\textrm{LT}\\right\\rangle\\right|\\lesssim\n400~\\textrm{s},\\left|\\left\\langle\\Delta\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{p}^{Q_2}\\right\\rangle\\right|\\lesssim\n10^3~\\textrm{s}$, depending on the other orbital parameters and the initial\nepoch. For the propagation delays, we have\n$\\left|\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{prop}^\\textrm{LT}\\right|\\lesssim\n0.02~\\textrm{s},~\\left|\\delta\\tau_\\textrm{prop}^{Q_2}\\right|\\lesssim\n1~\\mu\\textrm{s}$. The expected precision in pulsar timing in Sgr A$^\\ast$ is of\nthe order of $100~\\mu\\textrm{s}$, or, perhaps, even $1-10~\\mu\\textrm{s}$.\n", "  We extend our previous analysis of holographic heavy ion collisions in\nnon-conformal theories. We provide a detailed description of our numerical\ncode. We study collisions at different energies in gauge theories with\ndifferent degrees of non-conformality. We compare four relaxation times: the\nhydrodynamization time (when hydrodynamics becomes applicable), the EoSization\ntime (when the average pressure approaches its equilibrium value), the\nisotropization time (when the longitudinal and transverse pressures approach\neach other) and the condensate relaxation time (when the expectation value of a\nscalar operator approaches its equilibrium value). We find that these processes\ncan occur in several different orderings. In particular, the condensate can\nremain far from equilibrium even long after the plasma has hydrodynamized and\nEoSized. We also explore the rapidity distribution of the energy density at\nhydrodynamization. This is far from boost-invariant and its width decreases as\nthe non-conformality increases. Nevertheless, the velocity field at\nhydrodynamization is almost exactly boost-invariant regardless of the\nnon-conformality. This result may be used to constrain the initialization of\nhydrodynamic fields in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We construct a model in which the cosmological constant is canceled from the\ngravitational equations of motion. Our model relies on two key ingredients: a\nnonlocal constraint on the action, which forces the spacetime average of the\nLagrangian density to vanish, and a dynamical way for this condition to be\nsatisfied classically with arbitrary matter content. We implement the former\ncondition with a spatially-constant Lagrange multiplier associated with the\nvolume form and the latter by including a free four-form gauge field strength\nin the action. These two features are enough to remove the cosmological\nconstant from the Einstein equation. The model is consistent with all\ncosmological and experimental bounds on modification of gravity and allows for\nboth cosmic inflation and the present epoch of acceleration.\n", "  Ag$_5$Pb$_2$O$_6$ has attracted considerable attention due to its novel\nnearly-free-electron superconductivity, but its electronic structure and\norbital character of the Cooper-pair electrons remain controversial. Here, we\npresent a method utilizing core-level photoemission to show that Pb 6$s$\nelectrons dominate near the Fermi level. We observe a strongly asymmetric Pb\n4$f_{7/2}$ core-level spectrum, while a Ag 3$d_{5/2}$ spectrum is well\nexplained by two symmetric peaks. The asymmetry in the Pb 4$f_{7/2}$ spectrum\noriginates from the local attractive interaction between conducting Pb 6$s$\nelectrons and a Pb 4$f_{7/2}$ core hole, which implies a dominant Pb 6$s$\ncontribution to the metallic conduction. In addition, the observed Pb\n4$f_{7/2}$ spectrum is not explained by the well-known Doniach-\\v{S}unji\\'{c}\nlineshape for a simple metal. The spectrum is successfully generated by\nemploying a Pb 6$s$ partial density of states from local density approximation\ncalculations, thus confirming the Pb 6$s$ dominant character and\nfree-electron-like density of states of Ag$_5$Pb$_2$O$_6$.\n", "  We adapt the well known \"displace, cut and reflect\" method to construct exact\nsolutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations corresponding to infinitesimally\nthin disks of matter endowed with dipole magnetic fields, which are entirely\nsupported by surface polar currents on the disk. Our starting point is the\nGutsunaev-Manko axisymmetric solution describing massive magnetic dipoles in\nGeneral Relativity, from which we obtain a continuous three-parameter family of\nasymptotically flat static magnetized disks with finite mass and energy. For\nstrong magnetic fields, the disk surface density profile resembles some well\nknown self-gravitating ring-like structures.\n  We show that many of these solutions can be indeed stable and, hence, they\ncould be in principle useful for the study of the abundant astrophysical\nsituations involving disks of matter and magnetic fields.\n", "  \\begin{abstract} This paper deals with a precise description of the region of\n{\\it zitterbewegung} below the Compton scale and the stochastic nature\nassociated with it. We endeavour to delineate this particular region by means\nof {\\it Ito's calculus} and instigate certain features that are in sharp\ncontrast with conventional physics. Interestingly, our work substantiates that\nthe {\\it zitterbewegung region} represents a pre-spacetime region and from\ntherein emerges the notion of our conventional spacetime. Interestingly, this\nunique region engenders the relativistic and quantum mechanical aspects of\nspacetime.\n", "  From 1972 and the Meadows report to 1997 and the ratification of the Kyoto\nProtocol by most of the countries in the world, the global energy policy\nframework has undergone a paradigm shift, as human societies have been leaving\naside the sole economic growth to embrace the broader concept of sustainable\ndevelopment. As new electrification vectors, modern renewable power systems,\nsuch as solar PV, have sprung up in the wake of this major mutation and have\ntypically been following an exponential growth since the mid-nineties.\nElectricity as well as its lack indeed holds a central position within the\nhuman development apparatus, from highly interconnected centralized power\nnetworks reaching 100 % of the population in developed countries, to the almost\n500 millions people without access to electricity in the multidimensionally\npoor rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. The encounter of the worldwide energy\ncontext being changed with each of these specific social-energy paradigms has\nended up considering two strategies for integrating renewable resources in\npower systems: the grid-connected architecture for meeting the sustainable\ndevelopment requirements, and the rural off-grid electrification for settling\nthe lack of human development. By means of a historical and cross-sectional\noverview, we depict here the ins and outs of this protean pattern and, using\nthe case of solar PV, analyze how it has eventually affected the development\nand sustainability of renewable power systems in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n", "  We show that a simple artificial neural network trained on entanglement\nspectra of individual states of a many-body quantum system can be used to\ndetermine the transition between a many-body localized and a thermalizing\nregime. Specifically, we study the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain in a random\nexternal field. We employ a multilayer perceptron with a single hidden layer,\nwhich is trained on labeled entanglement spectra pertaining to the fully\nlocalized and fully thermal regimes. We then apply this network to classify\nspectra belonging to states in the transition region. For training, we use a\ncost function that contains, in addition to the usual error and regularization\nparts, a term that favors a confident classification of the transition region\nstates. The resulting phase diagram is in good agreement with the one obtained\nby more conventional methods and can be computed for small systems. In\nparticular, the neural network outperforms conventional methods in classifying\nindividual eigenstates pertaining to a single disorder realization. It allows\nus to map out the structure of these eigenstates across the transition with\nspatial resolution. Furthermore, we analyze the network operation using the\ndreaming technique to show that the neural network correctly learns by itself\nthe power-law structure of the entanglement spectra in the many-body localized\nregime.\n", "  In this work we discuss the existence of time-translation symmetry breaking\nin a kicked infinite-range-interacting clean spin system described by the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. This Floquet time crystal is robust under\nperturbations of the kicking protocol, its existence being intimately linked to\nthe underlying $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking of the time-independent model.\nWe show that the model being infinite-range and having an extensive amount of\nsymmetry breaking eigenstates is essential for having the time-crystal\nbehaviour. In particular we discuss the properties of the Floquet spectrum, and\nshow the existence of doublets of Floquet states which are respectively even\nand odd superposition of symmetry broken states and have quasi-energies\ndiffering of half the driving frequencies, a key essence of Floquet time\ncrystals. Remarkably, the stability of the time-crystal phase can be directly\nanalysed in the limit of infinite size, discussing the properties of the\ncorresponding classical phase space. Through a detailed analysis of the\nrobustness of the time crystal to various perturbations we are able to map the\ncorresponding phase diagram. We finally discuss the possibility of an\nexperimental implementation by means of trapped ions.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium phase transition between survival and extinction\nof spatially extended biological populations using an agent-based model. We\nespecially focus on the effects of global temporal fluctuations of the\nenvironmental conditions, i.e., temporal disorder. Using large-scale\nMonte-Carlo simulations of up to $3\\times 10^7$ organisms and $10^5$\ngenerations, we find the extinction transition in time-independent environments\nto be in the well-known directed percolation universality class. In contrast,\ntemporal disorder leads to a highly unusual extinction transition characterized\nby logarithmically slow population decay and enormous fluctuations even for\nlarge populations. The simulations provide strong evidence for this transition\nto be of exotic infinite-noise type, as recently predicted by a renormalization\ngroup theory. The transition is accompanied by temporal Griffiths phases\nfeaturing a power-law dependence of the life time on the population size.\n", "  A computational method, based on $\\ell_1$-minimization, is proposed for the\nproblem of link flow correction, when the available traffic flow data on many\nlinks in a road network are inconsistent with respect to the flow conservation\nlaw. Without extra information, the problem is generally ill-posed when a large\nportion of the link sensors are unhealthy. It is possible, however, to correct\nthe corrupted link flows \\textit{accurately} with the proposed method under a\nrecoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located\nat certain links. We analytically identify the links that are robust to\nmiscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by\nintroducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it. The\nrecoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated\nrecoverability being greater than 1. In a more realistic setting, besides the\nunhealthy link sensors, small measurement noises may be present at the other\nsensors. Under the same recoverability condition, our method guarantees to give\nan estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground-truth data and leads to a\nbound for the correction error. Both synthetic and real-world examples are\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "  It was recently shown that odd-frequency superconducting pair amplitudes can\nbe induced in conventional superconductors subjected to a spatially-nonuniform\ntime-dependent drive. It has also been shown that, in the presence of interband\nscattering, multiband superconductors will possess bulk odd-frequency\nsuperconducting pair amplitudes. In this work we build on these previous\nresults to demonstrate that by subjecting a multiband superconductor with\ninterband scattering to a time-dependent drive even-frequency pair amplitudes\ncan be converted to odd-frequency pair amplitudes and vice versa. We will\ndiscuss the physical conditions under which these pair symmetry conversions can\nbe achieved and possible experimental signatures of their presence.\n", "  We present and analyze two pathways to produce commercial optical-fiber patch\ncords with stable long-term transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) at powers up\nto $\\sim$ 200 mW, and typical bulk transmission between 66-75\\%. Commercial\nfiber patch cords in the UV are of great interest across a wide variety of\nscientific applications ranging from biology to metrology, and the lack of\navailability has yet to be suitably addressed. We provide a guide to producing\nsuch solarization-resistant, hydrogen-passivated, polarization-maintaining,\nconnectorized and jacketed optical fibers compatible with demanding scientific\nand industrial applications. Our presentation describes the fabrication and\nhydrogen loading procedure in detail and presents a high-pressure vessel\ndesign, calculations of required \\Ht\\ loading times, and information on patch\ncord handling and the mitigation of bending sensitivities. Transmission at 313\nnm is measured over many months for cumulative energy on the fiber output of >\n10 kJ with no demonstrable degradation due to UV solarization, in contrast to\nstandard uncured fibers. Polarization sensitivity and stability are\ncharacterized yielding polarization extinction ratios between 15 dB and 25 dB\nat 313 nm, where we find patch cords become linearly polarizing. We observe\nthat particle deposition at the fiber facet induced by high-intensity UV\nexposure can (reversibly) deteriorate patch cord performance and describe a\ntechnique for nitrogen purging of fiber collimators which mitigates this\nphenomenon.\n", "  We study behaviour of gravitational waves in the recently introduced general\nrelativistic polytropic spheres containing a region of trapped null geodesics\nextended around radius of the stable null circular geodesic that can exist for\nthe polytropic index $N>2.138$ and the relativistic parameter, giving ratio of\nthe central pressure $p_\\mathrm{c}$ to the central energy density\n$\\rho_\\mathrm{c}$, higher than $\\sigma = 0.677$. In the trapping zones of such\npolytropes, the effective potential of the axial gravitational wave\nperturbations resembles those related to the ultracompact uniform density\nobjects, giving thus similar long-lived axial gravitational modes. These\nlong-lived linear perturbations are related to the stable circular null\ngeodesic and due to additional non-linear phenomena could lead to conversion of\nthe trapping zone to a black hole. We give in the eikonal limit examples of the\nlong-lived gravitational modes, their oscillatory frequencies and slow damping\nrates, for the trapping zones of the polytropes with $N \\in (2.138,4)$.\nHowever, in the trapping polytropes the long-lived damped modes exist only for\nvery large values of the multipole number $\\ell>50$, while for smaller values\nof $\\ell$ the numerical calculations indicate existence of fast growing\nunstable axial gravitational modes. We demonstrate that for polytropes with $N\n\\geq 3.78$, the trapping region is by many orders smaller than extension of the\npolytrope, and the mass contained in the trapping zone is about $10^{-3}$ of\nthe total mass of the polytrope. Therefore, the gravitational instability of\nsuch trapping zones could serve as a model explaining creation of central\nsupermassive black holes in galactic halos or galaxy clusters.\n", "  The evolution of particle detectors has always pushed the technological limit\nin order to provide enabling technologies to researchers in all fields of\nscience. One archetypal example is the evolution of silicon detectors, from a\nsystem with a few channels 30 years ago, to the tens of millions of independent\npixels currently used to track charged particles in all major particle physics\nexperiments. Nowadays, silicon detectors are ubiquitous not only in research\nlaboratories but in almost every high-tech apparatus, from portable phones to\nhospitals. In this contribution, we present a new direction in the evolution of\nsilicon detectors for charge particle tracking, namely the inclusion of very\naccurate timing information. This enhancement of the present silicon detector\nparadigm is enabled by the inclusion of controlled low gain in the detector\nresponse, therefore increasing the detector output signal sufficiently to make\ntiming measurement possible. After providing a short overview of the advantage\nof this new technology, we present the necessary conditions that need to be met\nfor both sensor and readout electronics in order to achieve 4-dimensional\ntracking. In the last section we present the experimental results,\ndemonstrating the validity of our research path.\n", "  A stationary axially symmetric solution describing a rotating anisotropic\nsource for Einstein Field Equations(EFE) is proposed which matches to the\nexterior Kerr metric. The anisotropic source satisfies all energy conditions -\nweak, strong, and dominant energy condition - for a wide range of metric's free\nparameters values. The resultant energy-momentum tensor components, and\nconsequently energy density and pressure profiles, redshift function and\nangular velocity are singularity free and behave as expected. As rotation\nparameter goes to zero a spherical source consisting of normal and exotic\nmatter is retrieved for the exterior Schwarzschild solution; the corresponding\nredshift function, however, is well-behaved and positive definite. This is the\nfirst solution of its kind.\n", "  The mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, pertaining to important applications\nsuch as molecular 'fingerprint' imaging, remote sensing, free space\ntelecommunication and optical radar, is of particular scientific interest and\ntechnological importance. However, state-of-the-art materials for MIR detection\nare limited by intrinsic noise and inconvenient fabrication processes,\nresulting in high cost photodetectors requiring cryogenic operation. We report\nblack arsenic-phosphorus-based long wavelength infrared photodetectors with\nroom temperature operation up to 8.2 um, entering the second MIR atmospheric\ntransmission window. Combined with a van der Waals heterojunction, room\ntemperature specific detectivity higher than 4.9*10^9 Jones was obtained in the\n3-5 um range. The photodetector works in a zero-bias photovoltaic mode,\nenabling fast photoresponse and low dark noise. Our van der Waals\nheterojunction photodector not only exemplify black arsenic-phosphorus as a\npromising candidate for MIR opto-electronic applications, but also pave the way\nfor a general strategy to suppress 1/f noise in photonic devices.\n", "  We present a fully ab initio based scheme to compute transport properties,\ni.e. the electrical conductivity {\\sigma} and thermopower S, in the presence of\nelectron-phonon interaction. Therefore, we explicitly investigate the\nk-dependent structure of the Eliashberg spectral function , the coupling\nstrength, the linewidth and the relaxation time {\\tau}. We obtain a\nstate-dependent {\\tau} and show its necessity to reproduce the increased\nthermopower at temperatures below the Debye temperature, without accounting for\nthe phonon-drag effect. Despite the detailed investigations of various k and q\ndependencies, the presented scheme can be easily applied to more complicated\nsystems.\n", "  We develop a general framework for the evaluation of $d$-dimensional cut\nFeynman integrals based on the Baikov-Lee representation of purely-virtual\nFeynman integrals. We implement the generalized Cutkosky cutting rule using\nCauchy's residue theorem and identify a set of constraints which determine the\nintegration domain. The method applies equally well to Feynman integrals with a\nunitarity cut in a single kinematic channel and to maximally-cut Feynman\nintegrals. Our cut Baikov-Lee representation reproduces the expected relation\nbetween cuts and discontinuities in a given kinematic channel and furthermore\nmakes the dependence on the kinematic variables manifest from the beginning. By\ncombining the Baikov-Lee representation of maximally-cut Feynman integrals and\nthe properties of periods of algebraic curves, we are able to obtain complete\nsolution sets for the homogeneous differential equations satisfied by Feynman\nintegrals which go beyond multiple polylogarithms. We apply our formalism to\nthe direct evaluation of a number of interesting cut Feynman integrals.\n", "  The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source that produced FRB 121102 was\nrecently localized in a star forming galaxy at $z=0.193$, which is associated\nwith an extended radio source at the burst location. One possibility is that\nthe repeating FRBs are produced by a new-born magnetar, which also powers the\nradio nebula. If so, the magnetar may produce $\\gamma$-ray emission due to\nmagnetic dipolar spin-down. The luminosity depends on the magnetar spin\nparameters and age. We process the eight-year Fermi LAT data at the position of\nFRB 121102 and place an energy flux upper limit of $\\sim 10^{-11} \\ {\\rm erg \\\ncm^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}$ in time bins with six-month intervals, and an accumulated\nenergy flux upper limit of $\\sim 4\\times 10^{-12} \\ {\\rm erg \\ cm^{-2} \\\ns^{-1}}$ over the eight year span. The corresponding $\\gamma$-ray luminosity\nupper limits are $\\sim 10^{45} \\ {\\rm erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and $\\sim 4\\times 10^{44}\n\\ {\\rm erg \\ s^{-1}}$ for the time-resolved and time-integrated analyses,\nrespectively. We discuss the implications of these limits on the young magnetar\nmodel.\n", "  The Local arm of the Milky Way, a short spiral feature near the Sun whose\nexistence is known for decades, was recently observed in detail with different\ntracers. Many efforts have been dedicated to elaborate plausible hypotheses\nconcerning the origin of the main spiral arms of the Galaxy; however, up to\nnow, no specific mechanism for the origin of the Local arm was proposed. Here\nwe explain, for the first time, the Local arm as an outcome of the spiral\ncorotation resonance, which traps arm tracers and the Sun inside it. We show\nthat the majority of maser sources belonging to the Local arm, together with\nthe Sun, evolve inside the corotation resonance, never crossing the main spiral\narms but instead oscillating in the region between them. This peculiar behavior\nof the Sun could have numerous consequences to our understanding of the local\nkinematics of stars, the Galactic Habitable Zone, and the Solar System\nevolution.\n", "  The development of an analytically iterative method for solving steady-state\nas well as unsteady-state problems of cosmic-ray (CR) modulation is proposed.\nIterations for obtaining the solutions are constructed for the spherically\nsymmetric form of the CR propagation equation. The main solution of the\nconsidered problem consists of the zero-order solution that is obtained during\nthe initial iteration and amendments that may be obtained by subsequent\niterations. The finding of the zero-order solution is based on the CR isotropy\nduring propagation in the space, whereas the anisotropy is taken into account\nwhen finding the next amendments. To begin with, the method is applied to solve\nthe problem of CR modulation where the diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$ and the\nsolar wind speed $u$ are constants with an Local Interstellar Spectra (LIS)\nspectrum. The solution obtained with two iterations was compared with an\nanalytical solution and with numerical solutions. Finally, solutions that have\nonly one iteration for two problems of CR modulation with $u = constant$ and\nthe same form of LIS spectrum were obtained and tested against numerical\nsolutions. For the first problem, $\\kappa$ is proportional to the momentum of\nthe particle $p$, so it has the form $\\kappa=k_0\\eta$, where\n$\\eta=\\frac{p}{m_0c}$. For the second problem, the diffusion coefficient is\ngiven in the form $\\kappa=k_0\\beta\\eta$, where $\\beta=\\frac{v}{c}$ is the\nparticle speed relative to the speed of light. There was a good matching of the\nobtained solutions with the numerical solutions as well as with the analytical\nsolution for the problem where $\\kappa = constant$.\n", "  Polarized radio emission has been mapped with great detail in several\nGalactic supernova remnants (SNRs), but has not yet been exploited to the\nextent it deserves. We have developed a method to model maps of the Stokes\nparameters for shell-like SNRs during their Sedov evolution phase. At first,\n3-dimensional structure of a SNR has been computed, by modeling the\ndistribution of the magnetohydrodynamic parameters and of the accelerated\nparticles. The generation and dissipation of the turbulent component of\nmagnetic field everywhere in SNR are also considered taking into account its\ninteraction with accelerated particles. Then, in order to model the emission,\nwe have used a generalization of the classical synchrotron theory, valid for\nthe case in which the magnetic field has ordered and disordered components.\nFinally, 2-dimensional projected maps have been derived, for different\norientations of SNR and of interstellar magnetic field with respect to the\nobserver. An important effect to consider is the Faraday rotation of the\npolarization planes inside the SNR interior. In this paper we present details\nof the model, and describe general properties of the images.\n", "  The hypothesis of a recent origin of Saturn's rings and its mid-sized moons\nis actively debated. It was suggested that a proto-Rhea and a proto-Dione might\nhave collided recently, giving birth to the modern system of mid-sized moons.\nIt is also suggested that the rapid viscous spreading of the debris may have\nimplanted mass inside Saturn's Roche limit, giving birth to the modern Saturn's\nring system. However, this scenario has been only investigated in very\nsimplified way for the moment. This paper investigates it in detail to assess\nits plausibility by using $N$-body simulations and analytical arguments. When\nthe debris disk is dominated by its largest remnant, $N$-body simulations show\nthat the system quickly re-accrete into a single satellite without significant\nspreading. On the other hand, if the disk is composed of small particles,\nanalytical arguments suggest that the disk experiences dynamical evolutions in\nthree steps. The disk starts significantly excited after the impact and\ncollisional damping dominates over the viscous spreading. After the system\nflattens, the system can become gravitationally unstable when particles are\nsmaller than $\\sim$ 100 m. However, the particles grow faster than spreading.\nThen, the system becomes gravitationally stable again and accretion continues\nat a slower pace, but spreading is inhibited. Therefore, the debris is expected\nto re-accrete into several large bodies. In conclusion, our results show that\nsuch a scenario may not form the today's ring system. In contrast, our results\nsuggest that today's mid-sized moons are likely re-accreted from such a\ncatastrophic event.\n", "  The direct growth of graphene on semiconducting or insulating substrates\nmight help to overcome main drawbacks of metal-based synthesis, like metal-atom\ncontaminations of graphene, transfer issues, etc. Here we present the growth of\ngraphene on n-doped semiconducting Ge(110) by using an atomic carbon source and\nthe study of the structural and electronic properties of the obtained\ninterface. We found that graphene interacts weakly with the underlying Ge(110)\nsubstrate that keeps graphene's electronic structure almost intact promoting\nthis interface for future graphene-semiconductor applications. The effect of\ndopants in Ge on the electronic properties of graphene is also discussed.\n", "  We consider collisional studies of linear polyatomic ions immersed in\nultracold atomic gases and investigate the intermolecular interactions and\nchemical reactions of several molecular anions ($\\mathrm{OH}^-$,\n$\\mathrm{CN}^-$, $\\mathrm{NCO}^-$, $\\mathrm{C}_2\\mathrm{H}^-$,\n$\\mathrm{C}_4\\mathrm{H}^-$) with alkali-metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) and\nalkaline-earth-metal (Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) atoms. State-of-the-art ab initio\ntechniques are applied to compute the potential energy surfaces (PESs) for\nthese systems. The coupled cluster method restricted to single, double, and\nnoniterative triple excitations, CCSD(T), is employed and the scalar\nrelativistic effects in heavier metal atoms are modeled within the small-core\nenergy-consistent pseudopotentials. The leading long-range isotropic and\nanisotropic induction and dispersion interaction coefficients are obtained\nwithin the perturbation theory. The PESs are characterized in detail and their\nuniversal similarities typical for systems dominated by the induction\ninteraction are discussed. The two-dimensional PESs are provided for selected\nsystems and can be employed in scattering calculations. The possible channels\nof chemical reactions and their control are analyzed based on the energetics of\nreactants. The present study of the electronic structure is the first step\ntowards the evaluation of prospects for sympathetic cooling and controlled\nchemistry of linear polyatomic ions with ultracold atoms.\n", "  Nuclear starbursts and AGN activity are the main heating processes in\nluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) and their relationship is fundamental to\nunderstand galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the star-formation and AGN\nactivity of a sample of 11 local LIRGs imaged with subarcsecond angular\nresolution at radio (8.4GHz) and near-infrared ($2.2\\mu$m) wavelengths. This\nallows us to characterize the central kpc of these galaxies with a spatial\nresolution of $\\simeq100$pc. In general, we find a good spatial correlation\nbetween the radio and the near-IR emission, although radio emission tends to be\nmore concentrated in the nuclear regions. Additionally, we use an MCMC code to\nmodel their multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) using template\nlibraries of starburst, AGN and spheroidal/cirrus models, determining the\nluminosity contribution of each component, and finding that all sources in our\nsample are starburst-dominated, except for NGC6926 with an AGN contribution of\n$\\simeq64$\\%. Our sources show high star formation rates ($40$ to\n$167M_\\odot\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), supernova rates (0.4 to\n$2.0\\mathrm{SN}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), and similar starburst ages (13 to\n$29\\mathrm{Myr}$), except for the young starburst (9Myr) in NGC6926. A\ncomparison of our derived star-forming parameters with estimates obtained from\ndifferent IR and radio tracers shows an overall consistency among the different\nstar formation tracers. AGN tracers based on mid-IR, high-ionization line\nratios also show an overall agreement with our SED model fit estimates for the\nAGN. Finally, we use our wide-band VLA observations to determine pixel-by-pixel\nradio spectral indices for all galaxies in our sample, finding a typical median\nvalue ($\\alpha\\simeq-0.8$) for synchrotron-powered LIRGs.\n", "  Modulating the amplitude and phase of light is at the heart of many\napplications such as wavefront shaping, transformation optics, phased arrays,\nmodulators and sensors. Performing this task with high efficiency and small\nfootprint is a formidable challenge. Metasurfaces and plasmonics are promising\n, but metals exhibit weak electro-optic effects. Two-dimensional materials,\nsuch as graphene, have shown great performance as modulators with small drive\nvoltages. Here we show a graphene plasmonic phase modulator which is capable of\ntuning the phase between 0 and 2{\\pi} in situ. With a footprint of 350nm it is\nmore than 30 times smaller than the 10.6$\\mu$m free space wavelength. The\nmodulation is achieved by spatially controlling the plasmon phase velocity in a\ndevice where the spatial carrier density profile is tunable. We provide a\nscattering theory for plasmons propagating through spatial density profiles.\nThis work constitutes a first step towards two-dimensional transformation\noptics for ultra-compact modulators and biosensing.\n", "  Using high-quality observed period-luminosity relations in both Magellanic\nClouds in VIJHKs bands and optical and near-infrared Wesenheit indices we\ndetermine the effect of metallicity on Cepheid P-L relations by comparing the\nrelative distance between LMC and SMC as determined from the Cepheids to the\ndistance difference between the Clouds which has been derived with very high\naccuracy from late-type eclipsing binary systems. Within an uncertainty of 3%\nwhich is dominated by the uncertainty on the mean metallicity difference\nbetween the Cepheid populations in LMC and SMC we find metallicity effects\nsmaller than 2% in all bands and in the Wesenheit indices, consistent with a\nzero metallicity effect. This result is valid for the metallicity range from\n-0.35 dex to -0.75 dex corresponding to the mean [Fe/H] values for classical\nCepheids in LMC and SMC, respectively. Yet most Cepheids in galaxies beyond the\nLocal Group and located in the less crowded outer regions of these galaxies do\nfall into this metallicity regime, making our result important for applications\nto determine the distances to spiral galaxies well beyond the Local Group. Our\nresult supports previous findings which indicated a very small metallicity\neffect on the near-infrared absolute magnitudes of classical Cepheids, and\nresolves the dispute about the size and sign of the metallicity effect in the\noptical spectral range. It also resolves one of the most pressing problems in\nthe quest towards a measurement of the Hubble constant with an accuracy of 1%\nfrom the Cepheid-supernova Ia method.\n", "  In this letter, we report our systematic construction of the lattice\nHamiltonian model of topological orders on open surfaces, with explicit\nboundary terms. We do this mainly for the Levin-Wen stringnet model. The full\nHamiltonian in our approach yields a topologically protected, gapped energy\nspectrum, with the corresponding wave functions robust under\ntopology-preserving transformations of the lattice of the system. We explicitly\npresent the wavefunctions of the ground states and boundary elementary\nexcitations. We construct the creation and hopping operators of boundary\nquasi-particles. We find that given a bulk topological order, the gapped\nboundary conditions are classified by Frobenius algebras in its input data.\nEmergent topological properties of the ground states and boundary excitations\nare characterized by (bi-) modules over Frobenius algebras.\n", "  Special Relativity (SR) determines the properties of synchrotron radiation,\nbut the corresponding mechanisms are frequently misunderstood. Time dilation is\noften invoked among the causes, whereas its role would violate the principles\nof SR. We show that the correct explanation of the synchrotron radiation\nproperties is provided by a combination of the Doppler shift, not dependent on\ntime dilation effects, contrary to a common belief, and of the Lorentz\ntransformation into the particle reference frame of the electromagnetic field\nof the emission-inducing device, also with no contribution from time dilation.\nWe close by reminding the reader that much if not all of our argument has been\navailable since the inception of SR, a research discipline of its own standing.\n", "  To help reveal the complete picture of linear kinetic drift modes, four\nindependent numerical approaches, based on integral equation, Euler initial\nvalue simulation, Euler matrix eigenvalue solution and Lagrangian particle\nsimulation, respectively, are used to solve the linear gyrokinetic\nelectrostatic drift modes equation in Z-pinch with slab simplification and in\ntokamak with ballooning space coordinate. We identify that these approaches can\nyield the same solution with the difference smaller than 1\\%, and the\ndiscrepancies mainly come from the numerical convergence, which is the first\ndetailed benchmark of four independent numerical approaches for gyrokinetic\nlinear drift modes. Using these approaches, we find that the entropy mode and\ninterchange mode are on the same branch in Z-pinch, and the entropy mode can\nhave both electron and ion branches. And, at strong gradient, more than one\neigenstate of the ion temperature gradient mode (ITG) can be unstable and the\nmost unstable one can be on non-ground eigenstates. The propagation of ITGs\nfrom ion to electron diamagnetic direction at strong gradient is also observed,\nwhich implies that the propagation direction is not a decisive criterion for\nthe experimental diagnosis of turbulent mode at the edge plasmas.\n", "  We revisit the precision of the measurement of track parameters (position,\nangle) with optimal methods in the presence of detector resolution, multiple\nscattering and zero magnetic field. We then obtain an optimal estimator of the\ntrack momentum by a Bayesian analysis of the filtering innovations of a series\nof Kalman filters applied to the track.\n  This work could pave the way to the development of autonomous\nhigh-performance gas time-projection chambers (TPC) or silicon wafer gamma-ray\nspace telescopes and be a powerful guide in the optimisation of the design of\nthe multi-kilo-ton liquid argon TPCs that are under development for neutrino\nstudies.\n", "  We present a quasi-analytical solution of a spin-orbital model of KCuF$_{3}$,\nusing the variational method for Green's functions. By analyzing the spectra\nfor different partial bosonic compositions as well as the full solution, we\nshow that hole propagation needs both orbiton and magnon excitations to\ndevelop, but the orbitons dominate the picture. We further elucidate the role\nof the different bosons by analyzing the self-energies for simplified models,\nestablishing that because of the nature of the spin-orbital ground state,\nmagnons alone do not produce a full quasiparticle band, in contrast to\norbitons. Finally, using the electron-hole transformation between the $e_g$\nstates of KCuF$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ we suggest the qualitative scenario for\nphotoemission experiments in LaMnO$_3$.\n", "  Although pathway-specific kinetic theories are fundamentally important to\ndescribe and understand reversible polymerisation kinetics, they come in\nprinciple at a cost of having a large number of system-specific parameters.\nHere, we construct a dynamical Landau theory to describe the kinetics of\nactivated linear supramolecular self-assembly, which drastically reduces the\nnumber of parameters and still describes most of the interesting and generic\nbehavior of the system in hand. This phenomenological approach hinges on the\nfact that if nucleated, the polymerisation transition resembles a phase\ntransition. We are able to describe hysteresis, overshooting, undershooting and\nthe existence of a lag time before polymerisation takes off, and pinpoint the\nconditions required for observing these types of phenomenon in the assembly and\ndisassembly kinetics. We argue that the phenomenological kinetic parameter in\nour theory is a pathway controller, i.e., it controls the relative weights of\nthe molecular pathways through which self-assembly takes place.\n", "  We study the role of hydrodynamic interactions for the relaxation of\nsegments' orientations in dendrimers. The dynamics is considered in the Zimm\nframework. It is shown that inclusion of correlations between segments'\norientations plays a major role for the segments' mobility, that reveals itself\nin the NMR relaxation functions. The enhancement of the reorientation dynamics\nof segments due to the hydrodynamic interactions is more significant for the\ninner segments. This effect is clearly pronounced in the reduced spectral\ndensity $\\omega J(\\omega)$, whose maximum shifts to higher frequencies when the\nhydrodynamic interactions are taken into account.\n", "  This paper starts with the most basic SU(5) Grand Unified Theory, coupled to\nSupergravity. Then it builds a new theory, incorporating the ideas of\nSuppressed SUSY. Suppressed SUSY is an alternative to the spontaneous breaking\nof SUSY. It does not need an invisible sector or explicit soft breaking of\nSUSY. It varies the content of the supermultiplets while keeping the\nrestrictive nature of SUSY. For the simple model and sector constructed here,\nSuppressed SUSY has only three dimensionless parameters, plus the Planck mass.\nAt tree level, this predicts a set of 8 different new masses, along with a\ncosmological constant that is naturally zero. The X and Y vector bosons get\nPlanck scale masses $2 \\sqrt{10} g_5 M_{\\rm P}$. The five scalar multiplets\nthat accompany the Higgs, and the Gravitino, all get colossally huge\n`SuperPlanck' scale masses of order $M_{\\rm SP} \\approx 10^{17} M_{\\rm P}$ from\na see-saw mechanism that arises from the theory. This new mass spectrum, the\nwell-known $SU(5)$ weak angle problem, and the cosmological constant value,\nshould serve as guides for further modifications for the new Action.\n", "  In the Standard Model (SM) we calculate the decay rate of the neutron\nradiative beta decay to order \"O(\\alpha^2/\\pi^2 ~ 10^{-5})\", where \"\\alpha$\"is\nthe fine--structure constant, and radiative corrections to order \"O(\\alpha/\\pi\n~ 10^{-3})\". The obtained results together with the recent analysis of the\nneutron radiative beta decay to next-to-leading order in the large proton-mass\nexpansion, performed by Ivanov et al. Phys. Rev. D95, 033007 (2017), describe\nrecent experimental data by the RDK II Collaboration (Bales et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 116, 242501 (2016)) within 1.5 standard deviations. We argue a\nsubstantial influence of strong low-energy interactions of hadrons coupled to\nphotons on the properties of the amplitude of the neutron radiative beta decay\nunder gauge transformations of real and virtual photons.\n", "  This new book by cosmologists Geraint F. Lewis and Luke A. Barnes is another\nentry in the long list of cosmology-centered physics books intended for a large\naudience. While many such books aim at advancing a novel scientific theory, A\nFortunate Universe has no such scientific pretense. Its goals are to assert\nthat the universe is fine-tuned for life, to defend that this fact can\nreasonably motivate further scientific inquiry as to why it is so, and to show\nthat the multiverse and intelligent design hypotheses are reasonable proposals\nto explain this fine-tuning. This book's potential contribution, therefore,\nlies in how convincingly and efficiently it can make that case.\n", "  Conventional magnonic devices use three classes of magnetostatic waves that\nrequire detailed manipulation of magnetization structure that makes the design\nand the device/circuitry scalability difficult tasks. Here, we demonstrate that\ndevices based on topological exchange spin waves do not suffer from the problem\nwith additional nice features of nano-scale wavelength and high frequency. Two\nresults are reported. 1) A perpendicular ferromagnet on a honeycomb lattice is\ngenerically a topological magnetic material in the sense that topologically\nprotected chiral edge spin waves exist in the band gap as long as spin-orbit\ninduced nearest-neighbor pseudodipolar interaction (and/or next-nearest\nneighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction) is present. 2) As a proof of\nconcept, spin wave beamsplitters and spin wave interferometers are designed by\nusing domain walls to manipulate the propagation of topologically protected\nchiral spin waves. Since magnetic domain walls can be controlled by magnetic\nfields or electric current/fields, one can essentially draw, erase and redraw\ndifferent spin wave devices and circuitry on the same magnetic plate so that\nthe proposed devices are reconfigurable and tunable. Devices made from magnetic\ntopological materials are robust against both internal and external\nperturbations such as the spin wave frequency variation and device geometry as\nwell as defects.\n", "  With a majority of 'Yes' votes in the Constitutional Referendum of 2017,\nTurkey continues its transition from democracy to autocracy. By the will of the\nTurkish people, this referendum transferred practically all executive power to\npresident Erdogan. However, the referendum was confronted with a substantial\nnumber of allegations of electoral misconducts and irregularities, ranging from\nstate coercion of 'No' supporters to the controversial validity of unstamped\nballots. In this note we report the results of an election forensic analysis of\nthe 2017 referendum to clarify to what extent these voting irregularities were\npresent and if they were able to influence the outcome of the referendum. We\nspecifically apply novel statistical forensics tests to further identify the\nspecific nature of electoral malpractices. In particular, we test whether the\ndata contains fingerprints for ballot-stuffing (submission of multiple ballots\nper person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of\nvoters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the\nelection results. We find systematic and highly significant support for the\npresence of both, ballot-stuffing and voter rigging. In 6% of stations we find\nsigns for ballot-stuffing with an error (probability of ballot-stuffing not\nhappening) of 0.15% (3 sigma event). The influence of these vote distortions\nwere large enough to tip the overall balance from 'No' to a majority of 'Yes'\nvotes.\n", "  Despite the importance of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) for modern\nastrophysics, their detailed mechanism is still not fully understood. In this\ncontribution, we present recent findings from numerical explosion models in the\ncontext of the observed diversity of SNe Ia and we discuss how these models can\nhelp to shed light on the explosion mechanism and the progenitor stars of SNe\nIa. In addition, we introduce the Heidelberg Supernova Model Archive (HESMA), a\nnew online data base where we provide integrated isotopic abundances and\nradially averaged ejecta profiles and synthetic observables for a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art explosion models.\n", "  Earth's tectonic processes regulate the formation of continental crust,\ncontrol its unique deep water and carbon cycles, and are vital to its surface\nhabitability. A major driver of steady-state plate tectonics on Earth is the\nsinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking\nis the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the\nlithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust\nand lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk\ncomposition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building\nelements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy.\nWe present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary\ndifferentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and\nshow that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances\ncontrol a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived,\nmelt-extracted crusts that sink. Those planets forming with a higher\nconcentration of Si and Na abundances are less likely to undergo sustained\ntectonics compared to the Earth. We find only 1/3 of the range of stellar\ncompositions observed in the Galaxy is likely to host planets able to sustain\ndensity-driven tectonics compared to the Sun/Earth. Systems outside of this\ncompositional range are less likely to produce planets able to tectonically\nregulate their climate and may be inhospitable to life as we know it.\n", "  Spectral line inversion codes are tools used to interpret spectropolarimetric\ndata; in general, their function is to analyze a set of observed Stokes\nprofiles, and infer the physical properties of the line-formation region in\nwhich the Stokes profiles were formed. For the SOLIS/VSM 6302v pipeline, the\ninversion is based on a Milne-Eddington model atmosphere, optimized to\nreproduce the observed Stokes profiles of both Fe I lines at 6301.5 and 6302.5\nAngstroms . This document provides a detailed overview of the SOLIS/VSM remix\nof the VFISV (Very Fast Inversion of the Stokes Vector) inversion code, as it\nis implemented in the SOLIS/VSM pipeline environment.\n", "  We use the visibility algorithm to construct the time series networks\nobtained from the time series of different dynamical regimes of the logistic\nmap. We define the simplicial characterisers of networks which can analyse the\nsimplicial structure at both the global and local levels. These characterisers\nare used to analyse the TS networks obtained in different dynamical regimes of\nthe logisitic map. It is seen that the simplicial characterisers are able to\ndistinguish between distinct dynamical regimes. We also apply the simplicial\ncharacterisers to time series networks constructed from fMRI data, where the\npreliminary results indicate that the characterisers are able to differentiate\nbetween distinct TS networks.\n", "  New machine learning based algorithms have been developed and tested for\nMonte Carlo integration based on generative Boosted Decision Trees and Deep\nNeural Networks. Both of these algorithms exhibit substantial improvements\ncompared to existing algorithms for non-factorizable integrands in terms of the\nachievable integration precision for a given number of target function\nevaluations. Large scale Monte Carlo generation of complex collider physics\nprocesses with improved efficiency can be achieved by implementing these\nalgorithms into commonly used matrix element Monte Carlo generators once their\nrobustness is demonstrated and performance validated for the relevant classes\nof matrix elements.\n", "  In the past decade, the discovery of active pharmaceutical substances with\nhigh therapeutic value but poor aqueous solubility has increased, thus making\nit challenging to formulate these compounds as oral dosage forms. The\nbioavailability of these drugs can be increased by formulating these drugs as\nan amorphous drug delivery system. Use of porous media like mesoporous silica\nhas been investigated as a potential means to increase the solubility of poorly\nsoluble drugs and to stabilize the amorphous drug delivery system. These\nmaterials have nanosized capillaries and the large surface area which enable\nthe materials to accommodate high drug loading and promote the controlled and\nfast release. Therefore, mesoporous silica has been used as a carrier in the\nsolid dispersion to form an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD). Mesoporous silica\nis also being used as an adsorbent in a conventional solid dispersion, which\nhas many useful aspects. This review focuses on the use of mesoporous silica in\nASD as potential means to increase the dissolution rate and to provide or\nincrease the stability of the ASD. First, an overview of mesoporous silica and\nthe classification is discussed. Subsequently, methods of drug incorporation,\nthe stability of dispersion and, much more are discussed.\n", "  In this note I survey the extensive literature on the dynamics of large\nseries arrays of identical current biased Josephson junctions coupled through\nvarious shared loads. The equations describing the dynamics are invariant under\npermutation of the junctions so that in addition to the usual dynamical systems\nand numerical methods, group theoretic methods can be applied. In practice it\nis desirable to operate these circuits at a stable in-phase oscillation. The\nworks summarized here are devoted to the study of where in parameter space the\nin-phase oscillations are stable and how the stability is lost. In particular,\nthey focus on the variety of states produced through bifurcation as the\nin-phase oscillation loses stability. These states include discrete rotating\nwaves and semirotors.\n", "  Introducing a new method, we demonstrate how the action of reduced operators\ncan be derived without resorting to a recoupling theory and how they exactly\nreproduce the results obtained in the standard approach of Quantum Reduced Loop\nGravity (QRLG). This is particularly relevant while dealing with volume\noperator when dealing with the coupling of matter fields to gravity. Apart from\nreinforcing the close link between QRLG and loop quantum cosmology (LQC), this\nprocedure also sheds new light on the issue of how to extract the continuum\nlimit, without resorting to the large-$j$ expansion, thereby pointing towards a\nnew approach to tackle this problem.\n", "  We reply to the objections raised in a recent Comment (arXiv:1706.03023)\nregarding our observation of slow magnetic fluctuations and critical slowing\ndown of magnetic fluctuations in the pseudogap phase of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ by\nzero-field and longitudinal-field muon spin relaxation (arXiv:1703.06799).\n", "  Recently, three-component new fermions in topological semimetal MoP are\nexperimentally observed, which may have potential applications like topological\nqubits, low-power electronics and spintronics. These are closely related to\nthermal transport properties of MoP. In this work, the phonon transport of MoP\nis investigated by solving the linearized phonon Boltzmann equation within the\nsingle-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The calculated\nroom-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is 18.41 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1}\nK^{-1}}$ and 34.71 $\\mathrm{W m^{-1} K^{-1}}$ along the in- and cross-plane\ndirections, exhibiting very strong anisotropy. The isotope and size effects on\nthe lattice thermal conductivity are also considered. It is found that isotope\nscattering produces little effect, and phonon has little contribution to the\nlattice thermal conductivity, when phonon mean free path(MFP) is larger than\n0.15 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ at 300 K. It is noted that average room-temperature\nlattice thermal conductivity of MoP is lower than that of representative Weyl\nsemimetal TaAs, which is due to smaller group velocities and larger\nGr$\\mathrm{\\ddot{u}}$neisen parameters. Our works provide valuable informations\nfor the thermal management of MoP-based nano-electronics devices, and motivate\nfurther experimental works to study thermal transport of MoP.\n", "  A physical theory consists of the mathematical formalism and an\ninterpretation, which contains the definition of symbols, measurement\nassignments, concepts and principles, and an ontology. We present a scheme to\nclassify these different levels of a physical theory and apply it to Newtonian\nMechanics and the interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. We show that this\nclassification scheme is embedded in the methodology of philosophy of science.\nWith this scheme, different interpretations of Quantum Mechanics can be\ncompared concerning the formalism and the used conceptions, and it serves as a\nguidance to identify ontological entities and reality conceptions in the\ndifferent interpretations. Inspired by the commitments on the ontological\nlevel, we propose two heuristics concerning ontological statements.\n", "  In this paper, we interpret the dark energy phenomenon as an averaged effect\ncaused by small scale inhomogeneities of the universe with the use of the\nspatial averaged approach of Buchert. Two models are considered here, one of\nwhich assumes that the backreaction term ${\\cal Q}_\\CD$ and the averaged\nspatial Ricci scalar $\\average{\\CR}$ obey the scaling laws of the volume scale\nfactor $a_\\CD$ at adequately late times, and the other one adopts the ansatz\nthat the backreaction term ${\\cal Q}_\\CD$ is a constant in the recent universe.\nThanks to the effective geometry introduced by Larena et. al. in their previous\nwork, we confront these two backreaction models with latest type Ia supernova\nand Hubble parameter observations, coming out with the results that the\nconstant backreaction model is slightly favoured over the other model, and\nwithin $1\\sigma$ confidence interval of the parameter $n$ in the scaling\nbackreaction model, $\\mid{\\cal Q}_\\CD\\mid$ decreases with the increase of the\nvolume scale factor $a_\\CD$ at adequately late times. Also, the numerical\nsimulation results show that the constant backreaction model predicts a smaller\nexpansion rate and decelerated expansion rate than the other model does at\nredshifts higher than about 1, and both backreaction terms begin to accelerate\nthe universe at a redshift around 0.6. In addition, by confronting the standard\ncosmological model against the same datasets, we find that the effective\ngeometry tends to push the constraint toward a smaller cosmological constant\nterm.\n", "  The acknowledged model for networks of collaborations is the hypergraph\nmodel. Nonetheless when it comes to be visualized hypergraphs are transformed\ninto simple graphs. Very often, the transformation is made by clique expansion\nof the hyperedges resulting in a loss of information for the user and in\nartificially more complex graphs due to the high number of edges represented.\nThe extra-node representation gives substantial improvement in the\nvisualisation of hypergraphs and in the retrieval of information. This paper\naims at showing qualitatively and quantitatively how the extra-node\nrepresentation can improve the visualisation of hypergraphs without loss of\ninformation.\n", "  Effective gauge theories based on slave particle construction are widely used\nto describe quantum number fractionalization in strongly correlated electron\nsystems. However, even setting aside the intense debates on the confinement\nissue of the slave particles, there are still significant conflicts between\ntheory and experiment. In particular, a $T^{2/3}$ specific heat anomaly has\nbeen predicted as the key signature of low-lying gauge fluctuation in a $U(1)$\nspin liquid with a large spinon Fermi surface, which is however never observed.\nHere we show that such an anomaly is actually an artifact of a Gaussian\napproximation and is absent when the no double occupancy constraint on the\nslave particles is strictly enforced. We also show that projective construction\nbased on slave particle representation provides a unified understanding on the\nmechanism of spin fractionalization and the nonlocal nature of a physical\nspinon in one and two dimensional spin liquids.\n", "  Martin David Kruskal was one of the most versatile theoretical physicists of\nhis generation and is distinguished for his enduring work in several different\nareas, most notably plasma physics, a memorable detour into relativity, and his\npioneering work in nonlinear waves. In the latter, together with Norman\nZabusky, he invented the concept of the soliton and, with others, developed its\napplication to classes of partial differential equations of physical\nsignificance.\n", "  We show how to analyze the motion of very low dissipation suspended mirrors\nin a Fabry-Perot. The very precise measurements of the mirrors motion can be\ndetermined, also in the presence of a disturbing noise, by means of the sudden\nreflectivity changes in special points of the mirrors positions. When the\nmirrors cross such positions, the effective opto-mechanical potential that\narises in the device is (roughly) at a maximum. We show that the motion cross\nsuch potential maxima is not only confused by the presence of noise, but also\nfavoured by noise itself that induces hoppings. Thus, the measurements of the\ntimes at which the crossings occur can be exploited to identify the properties\nof the applied signal. We also show how to circumvent the difficulty of the\nextremely long transient that occur in the system analyzing the escape average\ntime with two different methods: a direct sample average and the indirect\nestimate from the tail distribution. Numerical simulations and physical insight\nsuggest that the indirect estimate, through the analysis of the distribution\ntails with an appropriated cut off is robust against the disturbances that\narise from the presence of transient dynamics.\n", "  A new framework is sketched for the treatment of the hadronisation of a\nhighly-virtual quark and anti-quark jet pair created in electron-positron\nannihilations. As in such a case, factorization theorem does not work, a new\nscale-evolution equation is proposed for the fragmentation functions. In this\napproach, the virtuality of the leading parton (taken to be equal to the mass\nof the jet it induces) is used as fragmentation scale.\n", "  The expected universality of small-scale properties of turbulent flows\nimplies isotropic properties of the velocity gradient tensor in the very large\nReynolds number limit. Using direct numerical simulations, we determine the\ntensors formed by n = 2 and 3 velocity gradients at a single point in turbulent\nhomogeneous shear flows, and in the log-layer of a turbulent channel flow, and\nwe characterize the departure of these tensors from the corresponding isotropic\nprediction. Specifically, we separate the even components of the tensors,\ninvariant under reflexion with respect to all axes, from the odd ones, which\nidentically vanish in the absence of shear. Our results indicate that the\nlargest deviation from isotropy comes from the odd component of the third\nvelocity gradient correlation function, especially from the third moment of the\nderivative along the normal direction of the streamwise velocity component. At\nthe Reynolds numbers considered (R_lambda ~ 140), we observe that these second\nand third order correlation functions are significantly larger in turbulent\nchannel flows than in homogeneous shear flow. Overall, our work demonstrates\nthat a mean shear leads to relatively simple structure of the velocity gradient\ntensor. How isotropy is restored in the very large Reynolds limit remains to be\nunderstood.\n", "  It is generally difficult to predict the positions of mutations in genomic\nDNA at the nucleotide level. Retroviral DNA insertion is one mode of mutation,\nresulting in host infections that are difficult to treat. This mutation process\ninvolves the integration of retroviral DNA into the host-infected cellular\ngenomic DNA following the interaction between host DNA and a pre-integration\ncomplex consisting of retroviral DNA and integrase. Here, we report that\nretroviral insertion sites around a hotspot within the Zfp521 and N-myc genes\ncan be predicted by a periodic function that is deduced using the diffraction\nlattice model. In conclusion, the mutagenesis process is described by a\nbiophysical model for DNA-DNA interactions.\n", "  We examine in this work the role of disorder in contributing to the sluggish\nrelaxation observed in intrinsic electron-glasses. Our approach is guided by\nseveral empirical observations: First and foremost, Anderson localization is a\npre-requisite for observing these nonequilibrium phenomena. Secondly, sluggish\nrelaxation appears to favor Anderson-insulators with relatively large\nFermi-energies (hence proportionally large disorder). These observations\nmotivated us to consider a way to measure the underlying disorder in a\nrealistic Anderson insulator. Optical study using a series of amorphous\nindium-oxide (In_{x}O) establish a simple connection between\ncarrier-concentration and the disorder necessary to approach the\nmetal-insulator transition from the insulating side. This is used to estimate\nthe typical magnitude of the quenched potential-fluctuation in the\nelectron-glass phase of this system. The implications of our findings on the\nslow dynamics of Anderson-insulators are discussed. In particular, the reason\nfor the absence of a memory-dip and the accompanying electron-glass effects in\nlightly-doped semiconductors emerges as a natural consequence of their weak\ndisorder.\n", "  We report on dynamic effects associated with thermally-annealing amorphous\nindium-oxide films. In this process the resistance of a given sample may\ndecrease by several orders of magnitude at room-temperatures, while its\namorphous structure is preserved. The main effect of the process is\ndensification - increased system density. The study includes the evolution of\nthe system resistivity during and after the thermal-treatment, the changes in\nthe conductance-noise, and accompanying changes in the optical properties. The\nsample resistance is used to monitor the system dynamics during the annealing\nperiod as well as the relaxation that ensues after its termination. These\nreveal slow processes that fit well a stretched-exponential law, a behavior\nthat is commonly observed in structural glasses. There is an intriguing\nsimilarity between these effects and those obtained in high-pressure\ndensification experiments. Both protocols exhibit the \"slow spring-back\"\neffect, a familiar response of memory-foams. A heuristic picture based on a\nmodified Lennard-Jones potential for the effective interparticle interaction is\nargued to qualitatively account for these densification-rarefaction phenomena\nin amorphous materials whether affected by thermal-treatment or by application\nof high-pressure.\n", "  Educational research has shown that narratives are useful tools that can help\nyoung students make sense of scientific phenomena. Based on previous research,\nI argue that narratives can also become tools for high school students to make\nsense of concepts such as the electric field. In this paper I examine high\nschool students visual and oral narratives in which they describe the\ninteraction among electric charges as if they were characters of a cartoon\nseries. The study investigates: given the prompt to produce narratives for\nelectrostatic phenomena during a classroom activity prior to receiving formal\ninstruction, (1) what ideas of electrostatics do students attend to in their\nnarratives?; (2) what role do students narratives play in their understanding\nof electrostatics? The participants were a group of high school students\nengaged in an open-ended classroom activity prior to receiving formal\ninstruction about electrostatics. During the activity, the group was asked to\ndraw comic strips for electric charges. In addition to individual work,\nstudents shared their work within small groups as well as with the whole group.\nPost activity, six students from a small group were interviewed individually\nabout their work. In this paper I present two cases in which students produced\nnarratives to express their ideas about electrostatics in different ways. In\neach case, I present student work for the comic strip activity (visual\nnarratives), their oral descriptions of their work (oral narratives) during the\ninterview and/or to their peers during class, and the their ideas of the\nelectric interactions expressed through their narratives.\n", "  This study investigates a group of high school students in a physics\nclassroom interacting with a computer simulation that simulates the\nelectrostatic interaction as a hockey game, the Electric Field Hockey. The\nactivity featured in this study took place prior to the students receiving\nformal instruction about the electric field. The learning goal was to allow\nstudents to explore the simulated electrostatic phenomena. The study asks the\nfollowing research question: How do high school students collectively explore\nsimulated electrostatic phenomena while interacting with the Electric Field\nHockey computer simulation during a classroom activity? In this paper, through\ncareful analysis of classroom videos, I present a case study about the group\nmentioned above. The results show that high school students encountered and\ndealt with multiple types of tensions in the activity and explored the\nelectrostatic phenomena simulated by the Electric Field Hockey. Students\nprioritized exploring different types of phenomena when they encountered\ndifferent types of tensions. Based on the findings I propose: When carrying out\nan activity with a novel educational tool, a teacher can attend to, and jump in\nat appropriate points, when tensions arises thus to orient students to explore\nthe simulated physical phenomena in more productive ways.\n", "  While there exists a significant number of web interactives for introductory\nphysics, students are almost never shown the computer code that generates these\ninteractives even when the physics parts of these programs are relatively\nsimple. Building off of a set of carefully-designed classical mechanics\nprogramming exercises that were constructed with this goal in mind, we present\na series of electromagnetism programming exercises in a browser-based framework\ncalled p5.js. Importantly, this framework can be used to highlight the physics\naspects of an interactive simulation code while obscuring other details. This\napproach allows absolute beginner programmers to gain experience in modifying\nand running the program without becoming overwhelmed. We plan to probe the\nimpact on student conceptual learning using the Brief Electricity and Magnetism\nAssessment and other questions. We invite collaborators and teachers to adopt\nthis framework in their high school or early undergraduate classes. All\nexercises are available at http://compadre.org/PICUP\n", "  The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) began\nmillimeter-precision ranging to the Moon in 2006. Until now, a comprehensive\nvalidation of APOLLO system range accuracy has not been possible because of\ncentimeter-scale deficiencies in computational models of the Earth-Moon range,\nand because APOLLO lacked an internal timing calibration system. Here, we\nreport on the development of a system that enables in-situ calibration of the\ntiming response of the APOLLO apparatus, simultaneous with lunar range\nmeasurements. The system was installed in August 2016. Preliminary results show\nthat the APOLLO system can provide lunar range measurements with millimeter\naccuracy.\n", "  Mn doping of group-IV semiconductors (Si/Ge) is achieved by embedding a thin\nMn-film as a {\\delta}-doped layer in group-IV matrix. The Mn-layer consists of\na dense layer of monoatomic Mn-wires, which are oriented perpendicular to the\nSi(001)-(2x1) dimer rows, or Mn-clusters. The nanostructures are covered with\nan amorphous Si or Ge capping layer, which conserves the identity of the\n{\\delta}-doped layer. The analysis of the bonding environment with STM is\ncombined with the element-specific detection of the magnetic signature with\nX-ray magnetic circular dichroism. The largest moment (2.5 {\\mu}B/Mn) is\nmeasured for Mn-wires, which have ionic bonding character, with an a-Ge\noverlayer cap, a-Si capping leads to a slightly reduced moment which has its\norigin in subtle variation of bonding geometry. Our results directly confirm\ntheoretical predictions on magnetism for Mn-adatoms on Si(001). The moment is\nquenched to 0.5{\\mu}B/Mn for {\\delta}-doped layers, which are dominated by\nclusters, and thus develop an antiferromagnetic component from Mn-Mn bonding.\n", "  Understanding the formation of wide binary systems of very low mass stars (M\n$\\le$ 0.1 Msun) is challenging. The most obvious route is via widely separated\nlow-mass collapsing fragments produced through turbulent fragmentation of a\nmolecular core. However, close binaries/multiples from disk fragmentation can\nalso evolve to wide binaries over a few initial crossing times of the stellar\ncluster through tidal evolution. Finding an isolated low mass wide binary\nsystem in the earliest stage of formation, before tidal evolution could occur,\nwould prove that turbulent fragmentation is a viable mechanism for (very) low\nmass wide binaries. Here we report high resolution ALMA observations of a known\nwide-separation protostellar binary, showing that each component has a\ncircumstellar disk. The system is too young to have evolved from a close binary\nand the disk axes are misaligned, providing strong support for the turbulent\nfragmentation model. Masses of both stars are derived from the Keplerian\nrotation of the disks; both are very low mass stars.\n", "  Indian Centre for Space Physics has taken a novel strategy to study low\nenergy cosmic rays and astrophysical X-ray sources which involve very light\nweight payloads up to about five kilograms on board a single or multiple\nballoons which are usually used for meteorological purposes. The mission\nduration could be anywhere from 3-12 hours. Our strategy provides extreme\nflexibility in mission preparation and its operation using a very economical\nbudget. There are several limitations but our innovative approach has been able\nto extract significant amount of scientific data out of these missions. So far,\nover one hundred missions have been completed by us to near space and a wealth\nof data has been collected. The payloads are recovered and are used again.\nScientific data is stored on board computer and the atmospheric data or payload\nlocation is sent to ground in real time. Since each mission is different, we\npresent here the general strategy for a typical payload and provide some\nresults we obtained in some of these missions.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is about to enter construction phase and\none of its main key science projects is to perform an unbiased survey in search\nof extragalactic sources. We make use of both the latest blazar gamma--ray\nluminosity function and spectral energy distribution to derive the expected\nnumber of detectable sources for both the planned Northern and Southern arrays\nof the CTA observatory. We find that a shallow, wide survey of about 0.5 hour\nper field of view would lead to the highest number of blazar detections.\nFurthermore, we investigate the effect of axion-like particles and secondary\ngamma rays from propagating cosmic rays on the source count distribution, since\nthese processes predict different spectral shape from standard extragalactic\nbackground light attenuation. We can generally expect more distant objects in\nthe secondary gamma-ray scenario, while axion-like particles do not\nsignificantly alter the expected distribution. Yet, we find that, these results\nstrongly depend on the assumed magnetic field strength during the propagation.\nWe also provide source count predictions for the High Altitude Water Cherenkov\nobservatory (HAWC), the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and\na novel proposal of a hybrid detector.\n", "  A nonlinear interaction between photons is observed in a process that\ninvolves charge sources. To observe this process in a vacuum, there are a\ngrowing number of theoretical and experimental studies. This process may\ncontain exotic contribution from new physics beyond the Standard Model of\nparticle physics, and is probed by experiments using a high-power laser or a\nhigh-field magnet, and more recently using an X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL).\nHere, we review the present status of our experiments testing various vacuum\nprocesses. We describe four experiments with a focus on those using an XFEL:\n(i) photon-photon scattering in the x-ray region, (ii) laser-induced\nbirefringence and diffraction of x rays, (iii) vacuum birefringence induced by\na high-field magnet, and (iv) a dedicated search for axion-like particles using\nthe magnet and x rays.\n", "  The evolution of the Langton's ant on a 2D lattice is studied from the \"ant's\nframework\". The aim of this article is twofold. Firstly, to see if one can\nexplain the emergent behaviour of the ant as an analogous sytem of a particle\ncrossing an horizon. Secondly, pointing toward some directions for an\nexplanation, the evolution of the density of one color is studied and\ncommented.\n", "  We study the phase transition of nuclear (baryonic) matter in the model of\none-dimensional random fluctuation walk. The stochastic fields (forces)\ninfluence intrinsic to Bose-Einstein correlations between two identical\nparticles is a particular ingridient of the model. The solution in terms of the\ncharacteristic functional equation contains the regular (homogenious) and the\nsingular non-analytical (non-homogenious) parts for baryonic matter (BM) and\nanomaly matter (AM), respectively. The conditions to phase transition from BM\nto AM are found.\n", "  Cosmic ray flux in our planetary system is primarily modulated by solar\nactivity. Radiation effects of cosmic rays on the Earth strongly depend on\nlatitude due to the variation of the geomagnetic field strength. To study these\neffects we carried out a series of measurements of the radiation\ncharacteristics in the atmosphere due to cosmic rays from various places\n(geomagnetic latitude: ~ 14.50 deg N) in West Bengal, India, located near the\nTropic of Cancer, for several years (2012-2016) particularly covering the solar\nmaximum in the 24th solar cycle. We present low energy ($15-140$ keV) secondary\nradiation measurement results extending from the ground till the near space (~\n40 km) using a scintillator detector on board rubber weather balloons. We also\nconcentrate on the cosmic ray intensity at the Regener-Pfotzer maxima and find\na strong anti-correlation between this intensity and the solar activity even at\nlow geomagnetic latitudes.\n", "  Proper motions of collisionless pointlike objects in a spherically symmetric\nsystem, for example stars in a galaxy, can be used to test whether that system\nis in equilibrium, with no assumptions regarding isotropy. In particular, the\nfourth order spherical Jeans equation yields expressions for two observable\nquantities characterizing the departure from equilibrium, both of which can be\nexpressed in terms of time derivatives of first and third moments of the\nvelocities. As illustrations, we compute these quantities for tracer\ndistributions drawn from an exact equilibrium configuration and also from near\nequilibrium configurations generated using the N-body code GALIC.\n", "  The technique of distributed dislocations proved to be in the past an\neffective approach in studying crack problems within classical elasticity. The\npresent work is intended to extend this technique in studying crack problems\nwithin couple-stress elasticity, i.e. within a theory accounting for effects of\nmicrostructure. This extension is not an obvious one since rotations and\ncouple-stresses are involved in the theory employed to analyze the crack\nproblems. Here, the technique is introduced to study the case of a mode I\ncrack. Due to the nature of the boundary conditions that arise in couple-stress\nelasticity, the crack is modeled by a continuous distribution of climb\ndislocations and constrained wedge disclinations (the concept of \"constrained\nwedge disclination\" is first introduced in the present work). These\ndistributions create both standard stresses and couple stresses in the body. In\nparticular, it is shown that the mode-I case is governed by a system of coupled\nsingular integral equations with both Cauchy-type and logarithmic kernels. The\nnumerical solution of this system shows that a cracked solid governed by\ncouple-stress elasticity behaves in a more rigid way (having increased\nstiffness) as compared to a solid governed by classical elasticity. Also, the\nstress level at the crack-tip region is appreciably higher than the one\npredicted by classical elasticity.\n", "  A conformal coating technique with nanocarbon was developed to enhance the\nsurface properties of alumina nanoparticles for bio-applications. The\nultra-thin carbon layer induces new surface properties such as water\ndispersion, cytocompatibility and tuneable surface chemistry, while maintaining\nthe optical properties of the core particle. The possibility of using these\nparticles as agents for DNA sensing was demonstrated in a competitive assay.\nAdditionally, the inherent fluorescence of the core alumina particles provided\na unique platform for localization and monitoring of living organisms, allowing\nsimultaneous cell monitoring and intra-cellular sensing. Nanoparticles were\nable to carry genes to the cells and release them in an environment where\nspecific biomarkers were present.\n", "  Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are complex electronic systems which exhibit a\nmultitude of collective phenomena. Two archetypal examples are VO2 and NdNiO3,\nwhich undergo a metal-insulator phase-transition (MIT), the origin of which is\nstill under debate. Here we report the discovery of a memory effect in both\nsystems, manifest through an increase of resistance at a specific temperature,\nwhich is set by reversing the temperature-ramp from heating to cooling during\nthe MIT. The characteristics of this ramp-reversal memory effect do not\ncoincide with any previously reported history or memory effects in manganites,\nelectron-glass or magnetic systems. From a broad range of experimental\nfeatures, supported by theoretical modelling, we find that the main ingredients\nfor the effect to arise are the spatial phase-separation of metallic and\ninsulating regions during the MIT and the coupling of lattice strain to the\nlocal critical temperature of the phase transition. We conclude that the\nemergent memory effect originates from phase boundaries at the\nreversal-temperature leaving `scars` in the underlying lattice structure,\ngiving rise to a local increase in the transition temperature. The universality\nand robustness of the effect shed new light on the MIT in complex oxides.\n", "  Acoustic quadrupole modes of sunlike stars vibrate when perturbed by a\npassing gravitational wave generated somewhere in the Universe. Here, we\ncompute the imprint of the gravitational waves on the acoustic spectrum of\nthese stars for gravitational events occurring near the supermassive black hole\nlocated at the center of the Milky Way. We found that in most cases the impact\nof gravitational waves in low-order quadrupole modes is not above the current\nobservational threshold of detectability, although this should be in the reach\nof the next generation of near infrared observatories and asteroseismology\nsatellite missions. Equally, we found that it is possible to follow the end\nphase of the coalescence of binaries with large chirp masses, as these\nphenomena have a unique imprint in the spectra of sunlike stars affecting\nsequentially several low-order quadrupole modes. Moreover, we discuss the\ndifferent imprints on the acoustic spectra of the different types of binary\nsystems constituted either by two white dwarfs, two neutron stars, two black\nholes or a compact star and a massive black hole.\n", "  In part I we introduce vertex rings, which bear the same relation to vertex\nalgebras (or VOAs) as commutative, associative rings do to commutative,\nassociative algebras over the complex numbers. We show that vertex rings are\ncharacterized by Goddard axioms. These include a generalization of the\ntranslation-covariance axiom of VOA theory that involves a canonical\nHasse-Schmidt derivation naturally associated to any vertex ring. We give\nseveral illustrative applications of these axioms, including the construction\nof vertex rings associated with the Virasoro algebra. We consider some\ncategories of vertex rings, and the role played by the center of a vertex ring.\nIn part II we extend the theory of Pierce bundles associated to a commutative\nring to the setting of vertex rings. This amounts to the construction of\ncertain reduced etale bundles of vertex rings functorially associated to a\nvertex ring. We introduce von Neumann regular vertex rings as a generalization\nof von Neumann regular commutative rings; we obtain a characterization of this\nclass of vertex rings as those whose Pierce bundles are bundles of simple\nvertex rings.\n", "  Hawking, Perry and Strominger recently invoked BMS symmetry charges in an\nattempt to resolve the black hole information paradox. Here we propose an\nalternative scenario that is based on the Kac-Moody charges. We show that the\nrole of BMS charges can be played by an infinite set of symmetries that emerge\nfrom the space-time foam predicted by quantum gravity. Specifically, we focus\non Yang-Mills fields embedded in the gravity described by the Holst\nformulation, and argue that the Yang-Mills and gravitational self-duality\nconditions in space-time bubbles are related to a new infinite dimensional\nglobal symmetry, hidden in the Lagrangian. Such a symmetry is manifested by the\nKac-Moody algebra, with zero central charges. This implies the existence, in\nthe space-time foam, of an infinite number of different instantons that are\ninterconnected by the Kac-Moody symmetry. These modes puncture the horizons of\nthe building block of the space-time bubbles. On the other hand, the same\nKac-Moody symmetry is retried in non-perturbative regime at the level of the\ngravitational quantum loops. The new result carries consequences on the no-hair\ntheorem and on the study of quantum black holes. In particular, instantonic\nmoduli of the Kac-Moody charges are quantum hairs encoding the missing black\nhole information, subtly compatible with the no hair theorem.\n", "  We review the possibilities for in situ energy resources on Titan for use by\nfuture humans, including chemical, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and\nhydropower. All of these options, with the possible exception of geothermal,\nrepresent effective sources of power. Combustion of methane (after electrolysis\nof the native water), in combination with another source of power such as\nnuclear, is a viable option; another chemical source of energy is the\nhydrogenation of acetylene. The large seas Kraken and Ligeia potentially\nrepresent effective sources of hydropower. Wind power, particularly at\naltitudes ~40 km, is expected to be productive. Despite the distance from the\nsun and the absorbing atmosphere, solar power is (as on Earth) an extremely\nefficient source of power on Titan.\n", "  We have obtained deep narrowband images in the near-infrared H2 (2.122\nmicrons) emission line for a sample of 15 faint Isaac Newton Telescope\nPhotometric Halpha Survey (IPHAS) bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe) to search for\nmolecular material. H2 emission is found in most of them (14 out of 15), mostly\nassociated with rings at their equatorial regions and with their bipolar lobes.\nThese detections add to the high occurrence of H2 emission among bipolar PNe\nreported in previous works, resulting from the large reservoir of molecular\nmaterial in these sources and the suitable excitation conditions for H2\nemission. The correlation between detailed bipolar morphology and H2 luminosity\nis also confirmed: bipolar PNe with broad equatorial rings (R-BPNe) have almost\nno continuum emission, are H2 brighter and have larger H2/Brgamma line ratio\nthan bipolar PNe with pinched equatorial waists (W-BPNe). The origin of this\ndichotomy is unclear. The larger size and age of R-BPNe are consistent with\nshock excitation of H2, whereas ultraviolet pumping is most likely the\nexcitation mechanism in the smaller and younger W-BPNe, which would explain\ntheir lower H2 luminosity. Although both types of bipolar PNe seem to proceed\nfrom the same progenitor population, this does not imply that R-BPNe descend\nfrom W-BPNe. Otherwise, we note that some of the H2-weak bipolar PNe harbor\npost-common envelope binary systems and symbiotic stars. Finally, we suggest\nthat the long-living H2 emission from R-BPNe arises from a discrete\ndistribution of compact knots embedded within the ionized gas at the equatorial\nregion.\n", "  This paper presents a new acoustic emission (AE) source localization for\nisotropic plates with reflecting boundaries. This approach that has no blind\nspot leverages multimodal edge reflections to identify AE sources with only a\nsingle sensor. The implementation of the proposed approach involves three main\nsteps. First, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the dispersion curves\nof the fundamental Lamb wave modes are utilized to estimate the distance\nbetween an AE source and a sensor. This step uses a modal acoustic emission\napproach. Then, an analytical model is proposed that uses the estimated\ndistances to simulate the edge-reflected waves. Finally, the correlation\nbetween the experimental and the simulated waveforms is used to estimate the\nlocation of AE sources. Hsu-Nielson pencil lead break (PLB) tests were\nperformed on an aluminum plate to validate this algorithm and promising results\nwere achieved. Based on these results, the paper reports the statistics of the\nlocalization errors.\n", "  In the spirit of multi-scale modelling magnetization dynamics at elevated\ntemperature is often simulated in terms of a spin model where the model\nparameters are derived from first principles. While these parameters are mostly\nassumed temperature-independent and thermal properties arise from spin\nfluctuations only, other scenarios are also possible. Choosing bcc Fe as an\nexample, we investigate the influence of different kinds of model assumptions\non ultra-fast spin dynamics, where following a femtosecond laser pulse a sample\nis demagnetized due to a sudden rise of the electron temperature. While\ndifferent model assumptions do not affect the simulational results\nqualitatively, their details do depend on the nature of the modelling.\n", "  Magnons can generate a spin current, and the standard generating mechanism\nrequires at least one external field. Since this mechanism is often applied to\na multilayer system including a magnet and a paramagnetic metal, the system can\npossess not only the charge current induced by the spin current but also the\ncharge current induced by the external field. The latter is an unnecessary\naccompaniment. Here we show that the tunneling of a magnon pair between chiral\nmagnets can generate a spin current even without external fields. This\nphenomenon originates from a phase difference between magnon pairs of separate,\nweakly coupled chiral magnets, and is essentially different from the mechanism\nusing the angle degree of freedom of the magnon Bose-Einstein condensates. The\npair's tunneling is possible in chiral magnets due to lack of the\nGoldstone-type gapless excitations. This phenomenon opens the door to\nspintronics not requiring any external field and using the magnon pair\ntunneling.\n", "  Many-site Bose-Hubbard lattices display complex semiclassical dynamics, with\nboth chaotic and regular features. We have characterised chaos in the\nsemiclassical dynamics of short Bose-Hubbard chains using both stroboscopic\nphase space projections and finite-time Lyapunov exponents. We found that chaos\nwas present for intermediate collisional nonlinearity in the open trimer and\nquatramer systems, with soft chaos and Kolmogoroff-Arnold-Moser islands\nevident. We have found that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents are consistent\nwith stroboscopic maps for the prediction of chaos in these small systems. This\ngives us confidence that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents will be a useful\ntool for the characterisation of chaos in larger systems, where meaningful\nphase-space projections are not possible and the dimensionality of the problem\ncan make the standard methods intractable.\n", "  This comment is devoted to the recalculation of the Casimir energy of a\nmassless scalar field in the Kerr black hole surrounded by quintessence derived\nin [B. Toshmatov, Z. Stuchl\\'{i}k and B. Ahmedov, Eur. Phys. J. Plus {\\bf 132},\n98 (2017)] and its comparison with the results recently obtained in [V. B.\nBezerra, M. S. Cunha, L. F. F. Freitas and C. R. Muniz, Mod. Phys. Lett. A {\\bf\n32}, 1750005 (2017)] in the spacetime [S. G. Ghosh, Eur. Phys. J. C {\\bf 76},\n222 (2016)]. We have shown that in the more realistic spacetime which does not\nhave the failures illustrated here, the Casimir energy is significantly bigger\nthan that derived in [V. B. Bezerra, M. S. Cunha, L. F. F. Freitas and C. R.\nMuniz, Mod. Phys. Lett. A {\\bf 32}, 1750005 (2017)], and the difference becomes\ncrucial especially in the regions of near horizons of the spacetime.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a central paradigm of elementary particle\nphysics, magnetism, superfluidity and superconductivity. According to\nGoldstone's theorem, phase transitions that break continuous symmetries lead to\nthe existence of gapless excitations in the long-wavelength limit. These\nGoldstone modes generally dominate the low-energy excitations, showing that\nsymmetry breaking has a profound impact on the physical properties of matter.\nHere, we present the first comprehensive study of the elementary excitations in\na homogeneous strongly interacting Fermi gas through the crossover from a\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nof molecules using two-photon Bragg spectroscopy. The spectra exhibit a\ndiscrete Goldstone mode, associated with the broken symmetry superfluid phase,\nas well as pair breaking single-particle excitations. Our techniques yield a\ndirect determination of the superfluid pairing gap and speed of sound in close\nagreement with a strong-coupling theory.\n", "  In our previous article (Priyal et al. in Solar Phys. 289, 127, 2014) we have\ndiscussed the details of observations and methodology adopted to analyze the\nCa-K spectroheliograms obtained at the Kodaikanal Observatory (KO) to study the\nvariation of Ca-K plage areas, enhanced network (EN), and active network (AN)\nfor Solar Cycles, namely 19, 20, and 21. Now, we have derived the areas of\nchromospheric features using KO Ca-K spectroheliograms to study the long-term\nvariations of Solar Cycles 14 to 21. The comparison of the derived plage areas\nfrom the data obtained at the KO observatory for the period 1906-1985 with that\nof MWO, NSO for the period 1965-2002, earlier measurements made by Tlatov,\nPevtsov, and Singh (Solar Phys. 255, 239, 2009) for KO data, and the SIDC\nsunspot numbers shows a good correlation. The uniformity of the data obtained\nwith the same instrument remaining with the same specifications provided a\nunique opportunity to study long-term intensity variations in plages and\nnetwork regions. Therefore, we have investigated the variation of the intensity\ncontrast of these features with time at a temporal resolution of six months\nassuming that the quiet-background chromosphere remains unchanged during the\nperiod 1906-2005 and found that the average intensity of the AN, representing\nthe changes in small-scale activity over solar surface, varies with solar cycle\nbeing less during the minimum phase. In addition, the average intensity of\nplages and EN varies with a very long period having a maximum value during\nSolar Cycle 19, which was the strongest solar cycle of twentieth century.\n", "  The polarization characteristics of zebra patterns (ZPs) in type IV solar\nbursts were studied. We analyzed 21 ZP events observed by the Assembly of\nMetric-band Aperture Telescope and Real-time Analysis System between 2010 and\n2015 and identified the following characteristics: a degree of circular\npolarization (DCP) in the range of 0%-70%, a temporal delay of 0-70 ms between\nthe two circularly polarized components (i.e., the right- and left-handed\ncomponents), and dominant ordinary-mode emission in about 81% of the events.\nFor most events, the relation between the dominant and delayed components could\nbe interpreted in the framework of fundamental plasma emission and\ndepolarization during propagation, though the values of DCP and delay were\ndistributed across wide ranges. Furthermore, it was found that the DCP and\ndelay were positively correlated (rank correlation coefficient R = 0.62). As a\npossible interpretation of this relationship, we considered a model based on\ndepolarization due to reflections at sharp density boundaries assuming\nfundamental plasma emission. The model calculations of depolarization including\nmultiple reflections and group delay during propagation in the inhomogeneous\ncorona showed that the DCP and delay decreased as the number of reflections\nincreased, which is consistent with the observational results. The dispersive\npolarization characteristics could be explained by the different numbers of\nreflections causing depolarization.\n", "  We theoretically investigate normal-state properties of a unitary Bose-Fermi\nmixture. Including strong hetero-pairing fluctuations, we evaluate the Bose and\nFermi chemical potential, internal energy, pressure, entropy, as well as\nspecific heat at constant volume $C_V$, within the framework of a combined\nstrong-coupling theory with exact thermodynamic identities. We show that\nhetero-pairing fluctuations at the unitarity cause non-monotonic temperature\ndependence of $C_V$, being qualitatively different from the monotonic behavior\nof this quantity in the weak- and strong-coupling limit. On the other hand,\nsuch an anomalous behavior is not seen in the other quantities. Our results\nindicate that the specific heat $C_V$, which has recently become observable in\ncold atom physics, is a useful quantity for understanding strong-coupling\naspects of this quantum system.\n", "  The interactions between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and metal adatoms as well as\nmetal contacts are studied by means of ab initio electronic structure\ncalculations. We show that the electronic properties of a semiconducting (8,4)\nCNT can be modified by small amounts of Pd adatoms. Such a decoration conserves\nthe piezoelectric properties of the CNT. Besides the electronic influence, the\nstability of a single adatom, which is of big importance for future technology\napplications, is investigated as well. We find only small energy barriers for\nthe diffusion of a Pd adatom on the CNT surface. Thus, single Pd adatoms will\nbe mobile at room temperature. Finally we present results for the interaction\nbetween a metallic (6,0) CNT and metal surfaces. Binding energies and distances\nfor Al, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt, and Au are discussed and compared, showing remarkable\nagreement between the interaction of single metal atoms and metal surfaces with\nCNTs.\n", "  We examine the stability of some non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions\nthat have been found recently. The first solution is AdS_5 X M_6, for M_6 an\nstretched CP^3. We consider breathing and squashing mode deformations of the\nmetric, and find that the solution is stable against small fluctuations of this\nkind. Next we consider type IIB solution of AdS_2 X M_8, where the compact\nspace is a U(1) bundle over N(1,1). We study its stability under the\ndeformation of M_8 and the 5-form flux. In this case we also find that the\nsolution is stable under small fluctuation modes of the corresponding\ndeformations.\n", "  A nanoscopic simulation for an acceleration sensor is aimed based on the\npiezoresistive effect of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Therefore, a compact model is\nbuilt from density functional theory (DFT), compared with results of molecular\ndynamics (MD) that describes the mechanics of carbon nanotubes in a\nparameterized way. The results for the interesting kind of CNTs [(6,3) and\n(7,4)] within the two approaches agree in a satisfying way, when\nDFT-calculations are performed with atomic configurations obtained by MD\ngeometry optimization. Geometry optimization yields the Poisson ratio for CNTs.\nThus, values from MD and DFT are compared. The simulation finally aims the\nmodeling of the conductive behavior of CNTs when strain is applied, but this\nneeds further verification. Here, we present the prediction of the tight\nbinding model for suitable CNTs.\n", "  Despite the popularity of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for general\npurpose computing, one should not forget about the practicality of the GPU for\nfast scientific visualisation. As astronomers have increasing access to three\ndimensional (3D) data from instruments and facilities like integral field units\nand radio interferometers, visualisation techniques such as volume rendering\noffer means to quickly explore spectral cubes as a whole. As most 3D\nvisualisation techniques have been developed in fields of research like medical\nimaging and fluid dynamics, many transfer functions are not optimal for\nastronomical data. We demonstrate how transfer functions and graphics shaders\ncan be exploited to provide new astronomy-specific explorative colouring\nmethods. We present 12 shaders, including four novel transfer functions\nspecifically designed to produce intuitive and informative 3D visualisations of\nspectral cube data. We compare their utility to classic colour mapping. The\nremaining shaders highlight how common computation like filtering, smoothing\nand line ratio algorithms can be integrated as part of the graphics pipeline.\nWe discuss how this can be achieved by utilising the parallelism of modern GPUs\nalong with a shading language, letting astronomers apply these new techniques\nat interactive frame rates. All shaders investigated in this work are included\nin the open source software shwirl (Vohl, 2017).\n", "  The paper presents a solution to the Boltzmann kinetic equation based on the\nconstruction of its discrete conservative model. Discrete analogue of the\ncollision integral is presented as a contraction of a tensor, which is\nindependent from the initial distribution function, colliding with a tensor\ncomposed of medium densities in the cells. Numerical implementation of the\ndiscrete model is demonstrated on the example of the isotropic gas relaxation\nproblem applied to the hard spheres model. The key feature of the method is\nindependence of the collision tensor components from the distribution function.\nConsequently the components of the collision tensor are calculated once for\nvarious initial distribution functions, which substantially increases\nperformance of the suggested method.\n", "  Accurate and fast modeling of electric fields in layered structures have a\ngreat scientific and practical value. Prevalent method for that is\ntransfer-matrix method. However, transfer matrix method is limited to infinite\nplane wave calculations, which can become a limiting factor if a very narrow\nresonances, e.g. long range surface plasmon polaritons, are present in the\nstructure. In this paper we extend the functionality of standard and nonlinear\ntransfer-matrix method to include beams with arbitrary profile and propose\napplications for the method.\n", "  More than 80 years ago, Born-Infeld electrodynamics was proposed in order to\nremove the point charge singularity in Maxwell electrodynamics. In this work,\nafter a brief introduction to Lagrangian formulation of Abelian Born-Infeld\nmodel in the presence of an external source, we obtain the explicit forms of\nGauss's law and the energy density of an electrostatic field for Born-Infeld\nelectrostatics. The electric field and the stored electrostatic energy per unit\nlength for an infinite charged line and an infinitely long cylinder in\nBorn-Infeld electrostatics are calculated. Numerical estimations in this paper\nshow that the nonlinear corrections to Maxwell electrodynamics are considerable\nonly for strong electric fields. We present an action functional for Abelian\nBorn-Infeld model with an auxiliary scalar field in the presence of an external\nsource. This action functional is a generalization of the action functional\nwhich was presented by Tseytlin in his studies on low energy dynamics of\n$D$-branes (Nucl. Phys. \\textbf{B469}, 51 (1996); Int. J. Mod. Phys. A\n\\textbf{19}, 3427 (2004)). Finally, we derive the symmetric energy-momentum\ntensor for Abelian Born-Infeld model with an auxiliary scalar field.\n", "  We propose to generate optical vortices using a degenerate optical resonator\nwith an intra-cavity spiral phase plate (SPP). The rays retracing skewed\nV-shaped paths in the resonator are phase-locked to form vortex laser with\nwavefront dislocation mirroring the topological charge of the SPP. Experimental\ndemonstrations on diode-pumped solid state system using Nd:YAG crystal emitted\nrandomly polarized optical vortices at a wavelength of 1064nm when the pump\npower went above 1.52W and the slope efficiency was 0.19. For long-term\noperations a power fluctuation of 2.2\\% and pointing stability of 2.6$\\mu$rads\nwas measured. This system also serves an useful platform to study the laser\ndynamics and to combine radiations coherently.\n", "  We present a new catalogue of solar energetic particle events near the Earth,\ncovering solar cycle 23 and the majority of solar cycle 24 (1996-2016), based\non the 55-80 MeV proton intensity data gathered by the SOHO/ERNE experiment. In\naddition to ERNE proton and heavy ion observations, data from the ACE/EPAM\n(near-relativistic electrons), SOHO/EPHIN (relativistic electrons), SOHO/LASCO\n(coronal mass ejections, CMEs), and GOES soft X-ray experiments are also\nconsidered and the associations between the particle and CME/X-ray events\ndeduced to obtain a better understanding of each event. A total of 176 SEP\nevents have been identified as having occurred during the time period of\ninterest; their onset and solar release times have been estimated using both\nvelocity dispersion analysis (VDA) and time-shifting analysis (TSA) for\nprotons, as well as TSA for near-relativistic electrons. Additionally, a brief\nstatistical analysis has been performed on the VDA and TSA results, as well as\nthe X-rays and CMEs associated with the proton/electron events, both to test\nthe viability of the VDA and to investigate possible differences between the\ntwo solar cycles. We find, in confirmation of a number of previous studies,\nthat VDA results for protons that yield an apparent path length of 1 AU < s <~\n3 AU seem to be useful, but those outside this range are probably unreliable,\nas evidenced by the anticorrelation between apparent path length and release\ntime estimated from the X-ray activity. It also appears that even the\nfirst-arriving energetic protons apparently undergo significant pitch angle\nscattering in the interplanetary medium, with the resulting apparent path\nlength being on average about twice the length of the spiral magnetic field.\nThe analysis indicates an increase in high-energy SEP events originating from\nthe far eastern solar hemisphere; e.g., such an event...\n", "  In this note, we speculate about the fundamental role being played by the\n$SO(8)$ group representations displaying the triality structure that\nnecessarily arise in models constructed under the free fermionic methodology as\nbeing remnants of the higher-dimensional triality algebra tri$(\\mathbb{O}) =\n\\mathfrak{so}(8)$.\n", "  By using semi-analytical method,we investigate the transmission and\nreflection coefficient and absorption and scattering cross section of spin\n0,1,2 particles which are massless from a charged non rotating black holes.\nHere orbiting scattering can be characterized of massless particles from\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole at a critical angular momentum. We examine the\neffects upon reflection,transmission,scattering and absorption cross section\ndue to the black hole charge. We find that with the increase of charge the\nabsorption cross section decreased in spin-2 particle while in case of spin 0\nparticle it is reversed and in case of spin 1 the effect is negligible due to\ncharge.\n", "  Phase transitions are a central theme of statistical mechanics, and of\nprobability more generally. Lattice spin models represent a general paradigm\nfor phase transitions in finite dimensions, describing ferromagnets and even\nsome fluids (lattice gases). It has been understood since the 1980s that random\ngeometric representations, such as the random walk and random current\nrepresentations, are powerful tools to understand spin models. In addition to\ntechniques intrinsic to spin models, such representations provide access to\nrich ideas from percolation theory. In recent years, for two-dimensional spin\nmodels, these ideas have been further combined with ideas from discrete complex\nanalysis. Spectacular results obtained through these connections include the\nproofs that interfaces of the two-dimensional Ising model have conformally\ninvariant scaling limits given by SLE curves, that the connective constant of\nthe self-avoiding walk on the hexagonal lattice is given by $\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt 2}$.\nIn higher dimensions, the understanding also progresses with the proof that the\nphase transition of Potts models is sharp, and that the magnetization of the\nthree-dimensional Ising model vanishes at the critical point.\n", "  The emergence of the magnetic minibads in the quasienergy spectrum of\ngraphene superlattice subjected to the quantizing magnetic field and\nelectromagnetic radiation was investigated. The graphene superlattice was\nassumed to be formed by space-periodical modulation of the gap in the vicinity\nof the Dirac point of the graphene band structure. The explicit form of the\nFloquet spectrum of electron was derived in the case of weak spatial\nmodulation. Minibads widths were shown to change with ac electric field\namplitude. The possibility of electron-electron bound states was shown. The\nbinding energies of these states were shown to be the function of the amplitude\nof ac electric field.\n", "  Atmospheric wavefront prediction based on previous wavefront sensor\nmeasurements can greatly enhance the performance of adaptive optics systems. We\npropose an optimal linear approach based on the Empirical Orthogonal Functions\n(EOF) framework commonly employed for atmospheric predictions. The approach\noffers increased robustness and significant performance advantages over\npreviously proposed wavefront prediction algorithms. It can be implemented as a\nlinear pattern matching algorithm, which decomposes in real time the input\n(most recent wavefront sensor measurements) into a linear sum of previously\nencountered patterns, and uses the coefficients of this linear expansion to\npredict the future state. The process is robust against evolving conditions,\nunknown spatio-temporal correlations and non-periodic transient events, and\nenables multiple sensors (for example accelerometers) to contribute to the\nwavefront estimation. We illustrate the EOFs advantages through numerical\nsimulations, and demonstrate filter convergence within 1 minute on a 1 kHz rate\nsystem. We show that the EOFs approach provides significant gains in high\ncontrast imaging by simultaneously reducing residual speckle halo and producing\na residual speckle halo that is spatially and temporally uncorrelated.\n", "  Pillared Graphene Frameworks are a novel class of microporous materials made\nby graphene sheets separated by organic spacers. One of their main features is\nthat the pillar type and density can be chosen to tune the material properties.\nIn this work, we present a computer simulation study of adsorption and dynamics\nof H$_{4}$, CH$_{2}$, CO$_{2}$, N$_{2}$ and O$_{2}$ and binary mixtures\nthereof, in Pillared Graphene Frameworks with nitrogen-containing organic\nspacers. In general, we find that pillar density plays the most important role\nin determining gas adsorption. In the low-pressure regime (< 10 bar) the amount\nof gas adsorbed is an increasing function of pillar density. At higher\npressures the opposite trend is observed. Diffusion coefficients were computed\nfor representative structures taking into account the framework flexibility\nthat is essential in assessing the dynamical properties of the adsorbed gases.\nGood performance for the gas separation in CH$_{4}$/H$_{2}$, CO$_{2}$/H$_{2}$\nand CO$_{2}$/N$_{2}$ mixtures was found with values comparable to those of\nmetal-organic frameworks and zeolites.\n", "  It is surprising that only an enhanced low-dose-rate sensitivity (ELDRS), but\nnot its contrariety, a reduced low-dose-rate sensitivity (RLDRS), is\nexperimentally observed in bipolar junction transistors. In this work, we\nattribute this strong asymmetry to an overwhelming superiority of hydrogen\ncracking reactions relative to Shockley-Read-Hall recombinations. We\ndemonstrate that this situation can be completely reversed and an RLDRS effect\ncan occur by decreasing the concentration ratio between hydrogen and\nrecombination centers. We show that the decrease of recombination rate of holes\n(generation rate of protons) with increasing dose rate is responsible for the\npositive (negative) dose-rate dependence of RLDRS (ELDRS). We also find an\nRLDRS-ELDRS transition for decreasing dose rate, in which the transition point\ncan be controlled by the concentration ratio. The proposed RLDRS effect and its\ntunability pave a way for a credible acceleration test of the total ionizing\ndose damage in different low dose rate environments.\n", "  We implement a simple hydrodynamical model to study behavioural swimming tilt\nangle of open swimmbladder fish. For this purpose we study the stability of\nforces acting on a fish swimming horizontally with constant velocity.\nAdditionally, the open swimbladder compression with the depth is modelled by\nBoyle's law. With these, our model gives an analytical solution relating the\ndepth with the body tilt angle and the velocity. An interesting result for\nsteady horizontal swimming is that the body tilt decreases with velocity almost\nlike $v^{-1}$. Moreover, we give an expression for the maximum tilt angle.\nThen, by introducing the assumption of constant swimming power we relate the\nswimming velocity with the tilting. Furthermore, we show that the\nhydrodynamical influence of a temperature gradient produced by a thermocline\nseems to be negligible for the fish tilting. These results are considerably\nhelpful for more realistic modelling of the \\emph{acoustic target strength} of\nfish. Finally, we tested our results by comparing the hydrodynamics solutions\nwith others obtained from acoustic observations and simulations of target\nstrength for Argentine anchovy.\n", "  How self-loops on vertices affect quantum walks is an interesting issue, and\nself-loops play important roles in quantum walk based algorithms. However, the\noriginal model that adjusting the effect of self-loops by changing their number\nhas limitations. For example, the effect of self-loops cannot be adjusted\ncontinuously, for their number must be an integer. In this paper, we proposed a\nmodel of adjustable self-loop on discrete-time quantum walk, whose weight is\ncontrolled by a real parameter in the coin operator. The proposed method not\nonly generalises the situations where the number of self-loops is an integer,\nbut also provides a way to adjust the weight of the self-loop continuously. It\nenhances the potential of self-loops in applications. For instance, we improve\nthe success rate of the quantum walk based search on a $20\\times20$\ntwo-dimension lattice from $23.6\\%$ to $97.2\\%$ by the proposed method. And the\nsuccess rate of the improved search, which only scales as $O(1/\\log{N})$ before\nbeing improved, even increases slightly with the size of the lattice. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an improvement is\nachieved on the quantum walk based spatial search.\n", "  Using modified microscopic model of GPI by taking into account the\npiezoelectric coupling with strains $\\varepsilon_i$ in the frames of\ntwo-particle cluster approximation, the components of polarization vector and\nstatic dielectric permittivity tensor of the crystal at applying the external\ntransverse electric fields $E_1$ and $E_3$ are calculated. An analysis of the\ninfluence of these fields on thermodynamic characteristics of GPI is carried\nout. A satisfactory quantitative description of the available experimental data\nfor these characteristics has been obtained at a proper choice of the model\nparameters.\n", "  This note is a geometric commentary on maximum-entropy proofs. Its purpose is\nto illustrate the geometric structures involved in such proofs, to explain more\nin detail why the maximization of the entropy can be turned into the\nminimization of a potential function, and to show how Lagrange transforms\nemerge from this. A synopsis of the main functions involved in the proof and of\ntheir very different properties is given at the end, together with a brief\ndiscussion of exponential families of probabilities, which also appear in the\nproof.\n", "  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling molecule in cancer cells.\nHowever, the significant secretion of H2O2 by cancer cells have been rarely\nobserved. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a near room temperature ionized gas\ncomposed of neutral particles, charged particles, reactive species, and\nelectrons. Here, we first demonstrated that breast cancer cells and pancreatic\nadenocarcinoma cells generated micromolar level H2O2 during just 1 min of\ndirect CAP treatment on these cells. The cell-based H2O2 generation is affected\nby the medium volume, the cell confluence, as well as the discharge voltage.\nThe application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in the cancer treatment has\nbeen intensively investigated over the past decade. Several cellular responses\nto the CAP treatment have been observed including the consumption of the\nCAP-originated reactive species, the rise of intracellular reactive oxygen\nspecies, the damage on DNA and mitochondria, as well as the activation of\napoptotic events. This is a new previously unknown cellular response to CAP,\nwhich provides a new prospective to understand the interaction between CAP and\ncells.\n", "  The astronomical observation of isopropyl cyanide further stresses the link\nbetween the chemical composition of the ISM and molecular composition of the\nmeteorites in which there is a dominance of branched chain amino acids as\ncompared to the straight. However, observations of more branched chain\nmolecules in ISM will firmly establish this link. In the light of this, we have\nconsidered C5H9N isomeric group in which the next higher member of the alkyl\ncyanide and other branched chain isomers belong. High-level quantum chemical\ncalculations have been employed in estimating accurate energies of these\nisomers. From the results, the only isomer of the group that has been\nastronomically searched, n-butyl cyanide is not the most stable isomer and\ntherefore, which might explain why its search could only yield upper limits of\nits column density without a successful detection. Rather, the two most stable\nisomers of the group are the branched chain isomers, tert-butylnitrile and\nisobutyl cyanide. Based on the rotational constants of these isomers, it is\nfound that the expected intensity of tert-butylnitrile is the maximum among\nthis isomeric group. Thus, this is proposed as the most probable candidate for\nastronomical observation. A simple LTE (Local thermodynamic equilibrium)\nmodelling has also been carried out to check the possibility of detecting\ntert-butyl cyanide in the millimetre-wave region.\n", "  The application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to\nstatistical physic problems has seen a surge of interest for their ability to\ndiscriminate phases of matter by extracting essential features in the many-body\nwavefunction or the ensemble of correlators sampled in Monte Carlo simulations.\nHere we introduce a gener- alization of supervised machine learning approaches\nthat allows to accurately map out phase diagrams of inter- acting many-body\nsystems without any prior knowledge, e.g. of their general topology or the\nnumber of distinct phases. To substantiate the versatility of this approach,\nwhich combines convolutional neural networks with quantum Monte Carlo sampling,\nwe map out the phase diagrams of interacting boson and fermion models both at\nzero and finite temperatures and show that first-order, second-order, and\nKosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions can all be identified. We explicitly\ndemonstrate that our approach is capable of identifying the phase transition to\nnon-trivial many-body phases such as superfluids or topologically ordered\nphases without supervision.\n", "  We study various properties of the soliton solutions of the modified\nregularized long-wave equation. This model possesses exact one- and two-soliton\nsolutions but no other solutions are known. We show that numerical\nthree-soliton configurations, for which the initial conditions were taken in\nthe form of a linear superposition of three single-soliton solutions, evolve in\ntime as three-soliton solutions of the model and in their scatterings each\nindividual soliton experiences a total phase-shift that is the sum of pairwise\nphase-shifts. We also investigate the soliton resolution conjecture for this\nequation, and find that individual soliton-like lumps initially evolve very\nmuch like lumps for integrable models but eventually (at least) some blow-up,\nsuggesting basic instability of the model.\n", "  The optical, elastic anisotropic and thermodynamic properties of TiN in the\nNaCl (B1) structure are analyzed in detail in the temperature range from 0 to\n2000 K and the pressure range from 0 to 20 GPa. From the calculated dielectric\nconstants, a first order isostructural phase transition between 29 and 30 GPa\nis found for TiN. The absorption spectra exhibit high values ranging from the\nfar infrared region to the ultra-violet one. The anisotropy value of Young's\nmodulus of TiN is smaller than that of c-BN at 0 GPa and the anisotropy of TiN\nclearly increases with an increase of pressure. The effects of pressure and\ntemperature on the bulk modulus, Gr\\\"uneisen parameter, Gibbs free energy, and\nDebye temperature are significant. The Gr\\\"uneisen parameter of TiN is much\nlarger than that of c-BN. At temperatures below 1000 K, TiN's heat capacity is\nmuch larger than that of c-BN.\n"]}
