Our work is the generalization of the time-honored\nwork by Jackson, Feenberg, and Campbell for bosons, that provides, in its most\nadvanced implementation, quantitative predictions for the dynamic structure\nfunction in the whole experimentally accessible energy/momentum regime. Our\nview is that the same physical effects -- namely fluctuations of the wave\nfunction at an atomic length scale -- are responsible for the correct\nenergetics of the excitations in both Bose and Fermi fluids. Besides a\ncomprehensive derivation of the fermion version of the theory and discussion of\nthe approximations made, we present results for homogeneous He-3 and electrons\nin three dimensions. We find indeed a significant lowering of the zero sound\nmode in He-3 and a broadening of the collective mode due to the coupling to\nparticle-hole excitations in good agreement with experiments. The most visible\neffect in electronic systems is the appearance of a ``double-plasmon''\nexcitation.\n", "  We study n-string scattering amplitudes in three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter\nspace (AdS3). We focus our attention on the processes in which the winding\nnumber conservation is violated maximally; that is, those processes in which it\nis violated in n-2 units. A worldsheet conformal field theory calculation leads\nus to confirm a previous conjecture about the functional form of these\nobservables.\n", "  We use an extended version of the hadronic SU(3) non-linear realization of\nthe sigma model that also includes quarks to study hybrid stars. Within this\napproach, the degrees of freedom change naturally as the temperature/density\nincreases. Different prescriptions of charge neutrality, local and global, are\ntested and the influence of strong magnetic fields and the anomalous magnetic\nmoment on the particle population is discussed.\n", "  Collective motion of animal groups often undergoes changes due to\nperturbations. In a topological sense, we describe these changes as switching\nbetween low-dimensional embedding manifolds underlying a group of evolving\nagents. To characterize such manifolds, first we introduce a simple mapping of\nagents between time-steps. Then, we construct a novel metric which is\nsusceptible to variations in the collective motion, thus revealing distinct\nunderlying manifolds. The method is validated through three sample scenarios\nsimulated using a Vicsek model, namely switching of speed, coordination, and\nstructure of a group. Combined with a dimensionality reduction technique that\nis used to infer the dimensionality of the embedding manifold, this approach\nprovides an effective model-free framework for the analysis of collective\nbehavior across animal species.\n", "  We propose a 2-Higgs doublet model where the symmetry is extended by\n$S_{3}\\otimes Z_{3}\\otimes Z_{3}^{\\prime }\\otimes Z_{14}$ and the field content\nis enlarged by extra $SU(2)_{L}$ singlet scalar fields. $S_3$ makes the model\npredictive and leads to viable fermion masses and mixing. The observed\nhierarchy of the quark masses arises from the $Z_{3}^{\\prime }$ and $Z_{14}$\nsymmetries. The light neutrino masses are generated through a type I seesaw\nmechanism with two heavy Majorana neutrinos. In the lepton sector we obtain\nmixing angles that are nearly tri-bi-maximal, in an excellent agreement with\nthe observed lepton parameters. The vacuum expectation values required for the\nmodel are naturally obtained from the scalar potential, and we analyze the\nscalar sector properties further constraining the model through the $\\gamma\n\\gamma$ decay channel and the $T$ and $S$ parameters.\n", "  Three-dimensional confinement allows semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) to\nexhibit size-tunable electronic and optical properties that enable a wide range\nof opto-electronic applications from displays, solar cells and bio-medical\nimaging to single-electron devices. Additional modalities such as spin and\nvalley properties can provide further degrees of freedom requisite for quantum\ninformation and spintronics. When seeking to combine these material features\ninto QD structures, however, confinement can cause hybridization that inhibits\nthe robustness of these emergent properties for insertion into quantum devices.\nHere, we show that a new class of laterally-confined materials, monolayer\nMoS$_2$ QDs, can be created through top-down nanopatterning of an\natomically-thin two-dimensional semiconductor so that they exhibit the same\nvalley polarization as in a continuous monolayer sheet.\nSemiconductor-compatible nanofabrication process allows for these\nlow-dimensional materials to be integrated into complex systems, an important\nfeature for advancing quantum information applications. The inherited bulk spin\nand valley properties, the size dependence of excitonic energies, and the\nability to fabricate MoS$_2$ QDs using semiconductor-compatible processing\nsuggest that monolayer semiconductor QDs have the potential to be multimodal\nbuilding blocks of integrated quantum information and spintronics systems.\n", "  Strong pinning depends on the pinning force strength and number density of\neffective defects. Using hydrostatic pressure method, we demonstrate that\nhydrostatic pressure up to 1.2 GPa can significantly enhance flux pinning or Jc\nby a factor of up to 5 especially in both low and high fields in optimally\ndoped Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 crystals. Our analysis on the flux pining mechanism\nindicate that both pinning centre number density (Np) and pinning force (Fp)\nare greatly increased by the pressure and contribute to strong pinning.\n", "  We propose a simple and predictive model of fermion masses and mixing in a\nwarped extra dimension, with the smallest discrete non-Abelian group $S_{3}$\nand the discrete symmetries $Z_{2}\\otimes Z_{4}$. Standard Model fields\npropagate in the bulk and the mass hierarchies and mixing angles are accounted\nfor the fermion zero modes localization profiles, similarly to the the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the\nfirst implementation of an $S_{3}$ flavor symmetry in this type of warped extra\ndimension framework. Our model successfully describes the fermion masses and\nmixing pattern and is consistent with the current low energy fermion flavor\ndata. The discrete flavor symmetry in our model leads to predictive mixing\ninspired textures, where the Cabbibo mixing arises from the down type quark\nsector whereas up type quark sector contributes to the remaining mixing angles.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of high-order sideband transitions at\nthe single-photon level in a quantum circuit system of a flux qubit\nultrastrongly coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. With the coupling\nstrength reaching 10% of the resonator's fundamental frequency, we obtain clear\nsignatures of higher-order red and first-order blue-sideband transitions, which\nare mainly due to the ultrastrong Rabi coupling. Our observation advances the\nunderstanding of ultrastrongly-coupled systems and paves the way to study\nhigh-order processes in the quantum Rabi model at the single-photon level.\n", "  Electric magnetic duality symmetry is well understood in vacuum. For light\npropagating through a medium this symmetry is typically broken. We investigate\nunder what conditions duality transformation is preserved in a linear medium\nand employ these conditions to generalise the definition of optical helicity to\na general linear medium. We will discuss some unique properties duality\nsymmetric media possess, provided they exist and reformulate Maxwell's equation\nin such a way that they explicitly show the decoupling of opposite helicities.\nThe feasibility of constructing a duality symmetric medium is discussed.\n", "  The free-space transfer of high-fidelity optical signals between remote\nlocations has many applications, including both classical and quantum\ncommunication, precision navigation, clock synchronization, etc. The physical\nprocesses that contribute to signal fading and loss need to be carefully\nanalyzed in the theory of light propagation through the atmospheric turbulence.\nHere we derive the probability distribution for the atmospheric transmittance\nincluding beam wandering, beam shape deformation, and beam-broadening effects.\nOur model, referred to as the elliptic-beam approximation, applies to weak,\nweak-to-moderate, and strong turbulence and hence to the most important regimes\nin atmospheric communication scenarios.\n", "  Reconstructing magnetizations from measurements of the generated magnetic\npotential is generally non-unique. The non-uniqueness still remains if one\nrestricts the magnetization to those induced by an ambient magnetic dipole\nfield (i.e., the magnetization is described by a scalar susceptibility and the\ndipole direction). Here, we investigate the situation under the additional\nconstraint that the susceptibility is either spatially localized in a subregion\nof the sphere or that it is band-limited. If the dipole direction is known,\nthen the susceptibility is uniquely determined under the spatial localization\nconstraint while it is only determined up to a constant under the the\nassumption of band-limitedness. If the dipole direction is not known,\nuniqueness is lost again. However, we show that all dipole directions that\ncould possibly generate the measured magnetic potential need to be zeros of a\ncertain polynomial which can be computed from the given potential. We provide\nexamples of non-uniqueness of the dipole direction and examples on how to find\nadmissible candidates for the dipole direction under the spatial localization\nconstraint.\n", "  Superradiant lasers based on atomic ensembles exhibiting ultra-narrow optical\ntransitions can emit light of unprecedented spectral purity and may serve as\nactive atomic clocks. We consider two frequency-detuned active atomic clocks,\nwhich are coupled in a cascaded setup, i.e. as master & slave lasers, and study\nthe synchronization of the slave to the master clock. In a setup where both\natomic ensembles are coupled to a common cavity mode such synchronization\nphenomena have been predicted by Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 154101\n(2014)] and experimentally observed by Weiner et al. [arXiv:1503.06464 (2015)].\nHere we demonstrate that synchronization still occurs in cascaded setups but\nexhibits distinctly different phase diagrams. We study the characteristics of\nsynchronization in comparison to the case of coupling through a common cavity.\nWe also consider synchronization through a classical channel where light of the\nmaster laser is measured phase sensitively and the slave laser is injection\nlocked by feedback and compare to the results achievable by coupling through\nquantum channels.\n", "  We study the exotic decay of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) into a pair of\nlight spin-0 particles ($\\phi$) which subsequently decays and results in a $4b$\nfinal state. This decay mode is well motivated in the Next to Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) and extended Higgs sector models. Instead\nof searching at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the High Luminosity Large\nHadron Collider (HL-LHC) which are beset by large Standard Model (SM)\nbackgrounds, we investigate this decay channel at the much cleaner Large Hadron\nElectron Collider (LHeC). With some simple selection cuts this channel becomes\nnearly free of background at this $ep$ machine, in stark contrast with the\nsituation at the (HL-)LHC. With a parton level analysis we show that for the\n$\\phi$ mass range $[20,60]GeV$, with $100\\,fb^{-1}$ luminosity the LHeC is\ngenerally capable of constraining\n$C_{4b}^2\\equiv\\kappa_{V}^2\\times\\text{Br}(h\\rightarrow\\phi\\phi)\\times\\text{Br}^2(\\phi\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b})$ ($\\kappa_{V}$ denotes the $hVV(V=W,Z)$ coupling strength relative to\nthe SM value) to a few percent level ($95\\%$ CLs). With $1\\,ab^{-1}$ luminosity\n$C_{4b}^2$ at a few per mille level can be probed. These sensitivities are much\nbetter than the HL-LHC performance and demonstrate the important role expected\nto be played by the LHeC in probing exotic Higgs decay processes, in addition\nto the already proposed invisible Higgs decay channel.\n", "  We classify possible boundary conditions of a 6d Dirac fermion $\\Psi$ on a\nrectangle under the requirement that the 4d Lorentz structure is maintained,\nand derive the profiles and spectrum of the zero modes and nonzero KK modes\nunder the two specific boundary conditions, (i) 4d-chirality positive\ncomponents being zero at the boundaries and (ii) 2d-chirality positive\ncomponents being zero at the boundaries. In the case of (i), twofold\ndegenerated chiral zero modes appear which are localized towards specific\ndirections of the rectangle pointed by an angle parameter $\\theta$. This leads\nto an implication for a new direction of pursuing the origin of three\ngenerations in the matter fields of the standard model, even though\ntriple-degenerated zero modes are not realized in the six dimensions. The\nemergence of the angle parameter $\\theta$ originates from a rotational symmetry\nin the degenerated chiral zero modes on the rectangle extra dimensions since\nthey do not feel the boundaries. In the case of (ii), this rotational symmetry\nis promoted to the two-dimensional conformal symmetry though no chiral massless\nzero mode appears. We also discuss the correspondence between our model on a\nrectangle and orbifold models in some details.\n", "  Animals live in groups to defend against predation and to obtain food.\nHowever, for some animals --- especially ones that spend long periods of time\nfeeding --- there are costs if a group chooses to move on before their\nnutritional needs are satisfied. If the conflict between feeding and keeping up\nwith a group becomes too large, it may be advantageous to some animals to split\ninto subgroups of animals with similar nutritional needs. We model the costs\nand benefits of splitting by a herd of cows using a cost function (CF) that\nquantifies individual variation in hunger, desire to lie down, and predation\nrisk. We model the costs associated with hunger and lying desire as the\nstandard deviations of individuals within a group, and we model predation risk\nas an inverse exponential function of group size. We minimize the cost function\nover all plausible groups that can arise from a given herd and study the\ndynamics of group splitting. We explore our model using two examples: (1) we\nconsider group switching and group fission in a herd of relatively homogeneous\ncows; and (2) we examine a herd with an equal number of adult males (larger\nanimals) and adult females (smaller animals).\n", "  Productive societies feature high levels of cooperation and strong\nconnections between individuals. Public Goods Games (PGGs) are frequently used\nto study the development of social connections and cooperative behavior in\nmodel societies. In such games, contributions to the public good are made only\nby cooperators, while all players, including defectors, can reap public goods\nbenefits. Classic results of game theory show that mutual defection, as opposed\nto cooperation, is the Nash Equilibrium of PGGs in well-mixed populations,\nwhere each player interacts with all others. In this paper, we explore the\ncoevolutionary dynamics of a low information public goods game on a network\nwithout spatial constraints in which players adapt to their environment in\norder to increase individual payoffs. Players adapt by changing their\nstrategies, either to cooperate or to defect, and by altering their social\nconnections. We find that even if players do not know other players' strategies\nand connectivity, cooperation can arise and persist despite large short-term\nfluctuations.\n", "  We give an overview of recent progress in the spectroscopic study of nucleon\nresonances within the dynamical coupled-channels analysis of meson-production\nreactions. The important role of multichannel reaction dynamics in\nunderstanding various properties of nucleon resonances is emphasized.\n", "  Nanophotonics focuses on the control of light and the interaction with matter\nby the aid of intricate nanostructures. Typically, a photonic nanostructure is\ncarefully designed for a specific application and any imperfections may reduce\nits performance, i.e., a thorough investigation of the role of unavoidable\nfabrication imperfections is essential for any application. However, another\napproach to nanophotonic applications exists where fabrication disorder is used\nto induce functionalities by enhancing light-matter interaction. Disorder leads\nto multiple scattering of light, which is the realm of statistical optics where\nlight propagation requires a statistical description. We review here the recent\nprogress on disordered photonic nanostructures and the potential implications\nfor quantum photonics devices.\n", "  We prove that the energy gap of the model proposed by Zhang, Ahmadain, and\nKlich [1] is exponentially small in the square of the system size. In [2] a\nclass of exactly solvable quantum spin chain models was proposed that have\ninteger spins ($s$), with a nearest neighbors Hamiltonian, and a unique ground\nstate. The ground state can be seen as a uniform superposition of all\n$s-$colored Motzkin walks. The half-chain entanglement entropy provably\nviolates the area law by a square root factor in the system's size\n($\\sim\\sqrt{n}$) for $s>1$. For $s=1$, the violation is logarithmic [3].\nMoreover in [2] it was proved that the gap vanishes polynomially and is\n$O(n^{-c})$ with $c\\ge2$.\n  Recently, a deformation of [2], which we call \"weighted Motzkin quantum spin\nchain\" was proposed [1]. This model has a unique ground state that is a\nsuperposition of the $s-$colored Motzkin walks weighted by\n$t^{\\text{area\\{Motzkin walk\\}}}$ with $t>1$. The most surprising feature of\nthis model is that it violates the area law by a factor of $n$. Here we prove\nthat the gap of this model is upper bounded by $8ns\\text{ }t^{-n^{2}/3}$ for\n$t>1$.\n", "  We investigate the surface plasmonic lattice solitons (PLSs) in semi-infinite\ngraphene sheet arrays. The surface soliton is formed as the SPPs tunneling is\ninhibited by the graphene nonlinearity, and meanwhile the incident power should\nbe above a threshold value. Thanks to the strong confinement of surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs) on graphene, the effective width of surface PLSs can be\nsqueezed into deep-subwavelength scale of ~ 0.001{\\lambda}. Based on the stable\npropagation of surface PLSs, we find that the light propagation can be switched\nfrom the array boundary to the inner graphene sheets by reducing the incident\npower or increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The study may find\npromising application in optical switches on deep-subwavelength scale.\n", "  Sequences of compatible quantum measurements can be contextual and any\nsimulation with a classical model accounting for the quantum observations,\nneeds to use some internal memory. In Ref. [New J. Phys. 13, 113011 (2011)], it\nwas shown that simulating the sequences of compatible observables from the\nPeres-Mermin scenario requires at least three different memory states in order\nto be not in contradiction with the deterministic predictions of quantum\ntheory. We extend this analysis to the probabilistic quantum predictions and\nask how much memory is required to simulate the quantum correlations generated\nby any quantum state. We find, that even in this comprehensive approach only\nthree internal states are required for the perfect simulation of the quantum\ncorrelations in the Peres-Mermin scenario.\n", "  We construct new equations of state for baryons at sub-nuclear densities for\nthe use in core-collapse supernova simulations. The abundance of various nuclei\nis obtained together with thermodynamic quantities. The formulation is an\nextension of the previous model, in which we adopted the relativistic mean\nfield theory with the TM1 parameter set for nucleons, the quantum approach for\n$d$, $t$, $h$ and $\\alpha$ as well as the liquid drop model for the other\nnuclei under the nuclear statistical equilibrium. We reformulate the model of\nthe light nuclei other than $d$, $t$, $h$ and $\\alpha$ based on the\nquasi-particle description. Furthermore, we modify the model so that the\ntemperature dependences of surface and shell energies of heavy nuclei could be\ntaken into account. The pasta phases for heavy nuclei and the Pauli- and\nself-energy shifts for $d$, $t$, $h$ and $\\alpha$ are taken into account in the\nsame way as in the previous model. We find that nuclear composition is\nconsiderably affected by the modifications in this work, whereas\nthermodynamical quantities are not changed much. In particular, the washout of\nshell effect has a great impact on the mass distribution above $T \\sim 1$ MeV.\nThis improvement may have an important effect on the rates of electron captures\nand coherent neutrino scatterings on nuclei in supernova cores.\n", "  Studies of the effective regime of loop quantum gravity (LQG) revealed that,\nin the limit of Planckian curvature scales, spacetime may undergo a transition\nfrom the Lorentzian to Euclidean signature. This effect is a consequence of\nquantum modifications of the hypersurface deformation algebra, which in the\nlinearized case is equivalent to a deformed version of the Poincar\\'e algebra.\nIn this paper the latter relation is applied to the LQG-inspired hypersurface\ndeformation algebra that is characterized by the above mentioned signature\nchange.\n  While the exact form of the deformed Poincar\\'e algebra is not uniquely\ndetermined, the algebra under consideration is representative enough to capture\na number of qualitative features. In particular, the analysis reveals that the\nsignature change can be associated with two symmetric invariant energy scales,\nwhich separate three physically disconnected momentum subspaces.\n  Furthermore, the invariant measure on momentum space is derived, which allows\nto properly define the average return probability, characterizing a fictitious\ndiffusion process on spacetime. The diffusion is subsequently studied in the\nmomentum representation for all possible variants of the model. Finally, the\nspectral dimension of spacetime is calculated in each case as a function of the\nscale parameter. In the most interesting case the deformation is of the\nasymptotically ultralocal type and the spectral dimension undergoes a reduction\nto $d_S = 1$ in the UV limit.\n", "  Energy band realignment at the interfaces between materials in\nheterostructures can give rise to unique electronic characteristics and\nnon-trivial low-dimensional charge states. In a homojunction of monolayer and\nmultilayer MoS$_2$, the thickness-dependent band structure implies the\npossibility of band realignment and a new interface charge state with\nproperties distinct from the isolated layers. In this report, we probe the\ninterface charge state using scanning photocurrent microscopy and\ngate-dependent transport with source-drain bias applied along the interface.\nEnhanced photoresponse observed at the interface is attributed to band bending.\nThe effective conductivity of a material with a monolayer-multilayer interface\nof MoS$_2$ is demonstrated to be higher than that of independent monolayers or\nmultilayers of MoS$_2$. A classic heterostructure model is constructed to\ninterpret the electrical properties at the interface. Our work reveals that the\nband engineering at the transition metal dichalcogenides monolayer/multilayer\ninterfaces can enhance the longitudinal conductance and field-effect mobility\nof the composite monolayer and multilayer devices.\n", "  Geopolitics focuses on political power in relation to geographic space.\nInteractions among world countries have been widely studied at various scales,\nobserving economic exchanges, world history or international politics among\nothers. This work exhibits the potential of Wikipedia mining for such studies.\nIndeed, Wikipedia stores valuable fine-grained dependencies among countries by\nlinking webpages together for diverse types of interactions (not only related\nto economical, political or historical facts). We mine herein the Wikipedia\nnetworks of several language editions using the recently proposed method of\nreduced Google matrix analysis. This approach allows to establish direct and\nhidden links between a subset of nodes that belong to a much larger directed\nnetwork. Our study concentrates on 40 major countries chosen worldwide. Our aim\nis to offer a multicultural perspective on their interactions by comparing\nnetworks extracted from five different Wikipedia language editions, emphasizing\nEnglish, Russian and Arabic ones. We demonstrate that this approach allows to\nrecover meaningful direct and hidden links among the 40 countries of interest.\n", "  We investigate the tunneling conductance of Weyl semimetal with tilted energy\ndispersion by considering electron transmission through a p-n-p junction with\none-dimensional electric and magnetic barrier. In the presence of both electric\nand magnetic barriers, we found that a large conductance gap can be produced by\nthe aid of tilted energy dispersion without a band gap. The origin of this\neffect is the shift of the electrons wave-vector at barrier boundaries caused\nby i) the pseudo-magnetic field induced by electrical potential, i.e., a newly\ndiscovered feature that is only possible in the materials possessing tilted\nenergy dispersion, ii) the real magnetic field induced by ferromagnetic layer\ndeposited on the top of the system. We use realistic barrier structure\napplicable in current nanotechnology and analyze the temperature dependence of\nthe tunneling conductance. The new approach presented here may resolve a major\nproblem of possible transistor applications in topological semimetals, i.e.,\nthe absence of normal backscattering and gapless band structure.\n", "  A wide range of electrochemical reactions of practical importance occur at\nthe interface between a semiconductor and an electrolyte. We present an\nembedded density-functional theory method using the recently released\nself-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) approach to study these interfaces.\nIn this model, a quantum description of the surface is incorporated into a\ncontinuum representation of the bending of the bands within the electrode. The\nmodel is applied to understand the electrical response of silicon electrodes in\nsolution, providing microscopic insights into the low-voltage region, where\nsurface states determine the electrification of the semiconductor electrode.\n", "  The recent discovery of topologically protected surface states in the\nnoncentrosymmetric $\\alpha$-BiPd and the centrosymmetric $\\beta$-Bi$_{2}$Pd has\nrenewed the interest in the Bi-Pd family of superconductors. Here, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations to investigate the structure, electronic, and\ntopological features of $\\beta$-Bi$_{2}$Pd, in bulk and in thin films of\nvarious thicknesses. We find that the Van der Waals dispersion corrections are\nimportant for reproducing the experimental structural parameters, while the\nspin-orbit interaction is critical for properly describing the appearance of\ntopological electronic states. By increasing the thickness of the slab, the\nDirac-cone surface states and the Rashba-type surface states gradually emerge\nat 9 and 11 triple-layers.\n", "  In this article we apply background-independent renormalization group methods\nto spin foam quantum gravity. It is aimed at extending and elucidating the\nanalysis of a companion letter, in which the existence of a fixed point in the\ntruncated RG flow for the model was reported. Here we repeat the analysis with\nvarious modifications, and find that both qualitative and quantitative features\nof the fixed point are robust in this setting. We also go into details about\nthe various approximation schemes employed in the analysis.\n", "  We demonstrate a new method for projective single-shot measurement of two\nelectron spin states (singlet versus triplet) in an array of gate-defined\nlateral quantum dots in GaAs. The measurement has very high fidelity and is\nrobust with respect to electric and magnetic fluctuations in the environment.\nIt exploits a long-lived metastable charge state, which increases both the\ncontrast and the duration of the charge signal distinguishing the two\nmeasurement outcomes. This method allows us to evaluate the charge measurement\nerror and the spin-to-charge conversion error separately. We specify conditions\nunder which this method can be used, and project its general applicability to\nscalable quantum dot arrays in GaAs or silicon.\n", "  We derive the complete set of evolutions of chirality-odd twist-3\nfragmentation functions at one-loop level. There are totally nine real twist-3\nfragmentation functions, among which seven are independent. The\nrenormalization-scale dependence of the nine functions has an important\nimplication for studies of single transverse-spin asymmetries. We find that the\nevolutions of the three complex fragmentation functions defined by\nquark-gluon-quark operator are mixed with themselves. There is no mixing with\nthe fragmentation functions defined only with bilinear quark field operators.\nIn the large-$N_c$ limit the evolutions of the three complex fragmentation\nfunctions are simplified and reduced to six homogenous equations.\n", "  Single layers of transition metal dichalcogenides are two-dimensional direct\nbandgap semiconductors with degenerate, but inequivalent, `valleys' in the\nelectronic structure that can be selectively excited by polarized light.\nCoherent superpositions of light and matter, exciton-polaritons, have been\nobserved when these materials are strongly coupled to photons, but these hybrid\nquasiparticles do not harness the valley-sensitive excitations of monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. Here, we demonstrate evidence for valley\npolarized exciton-polaritons in monolayers of MoS$_2$ embedded in a dielectric\nmicrocavity. Unlike traditional microcavity exciton-polaritons, these\nlight-matter quasiparticles emit polarized light with spectral Rabi splitting.\nThe interplay of cavity-modified exciton dynamics and intervalley relaxation in\nthe high-cooperativity regime causes valley polarized exciton-polaritons to\npersist to room temperature, distinct from the vanishing polarization in bare\nmonolayers. Achieving polarization-sensitive polaritonic devices operating at\nroom temperature presents a pathway for manipulating novel valley degrees of\nfreedom in coherent states of light and matter.\n", "  We review recent advances on the record statistics of strongly correlated\ntime series, whose entries denote the positions of a random walk or a L\\'evy\nflight on a line. After a brief survey of the theory of records for independent\nand identically distributed random variables, we focus on random walks. During\nthe last few years, it was indeed realized that random walks are a very useful\n\"laboratory\" to test the effects of correlations on the record statistics. We\nstart with the simple one-dimensional random walk with symmetric jumps (both\ncontinuous and discrete) and discuss in detail the statistics of the number of\nrecords, as well as of the ages of the records, i.e., the lapses of time\nbetween two successive record breaking events. Then we review the results that\nwere obtained for a wide variety of random walk models, including random walks\nwith a linear drift, continuous time random walks, constrained random walks\n(like the random walk bridge) and the case of multiple independent random\nwalkers. Finally, we discuss further observables related to records, like the\nrecord increments, as well as some questions raised by physical applications of\nrecord statistics, like the effects of measurement error and noise.\n", "  Single-photon subtraction plays important roles in optical quantum\ninformation processing as it provides a non-Gaussian characteristic in\ncontinuous-variable quantum information. While the conventional way of\nimplementing single-photon subtraction based on a low-reflectance beam splitter\nworks properly for a single-mode quantum state, it is unsuitable for a\nmultimode quantum state because a single photon is subtracted from all multiple\nmodes without maintaining their mode coherence. Here we experimentally\nimplement and characterize a mode-tunable coherent single-photon subtractor\nbased on sum frequency generation. It can subtract a single photon exclusively\nfrom one desired time-frequency mode of light or from a coherent superposition\nof multiple time-frequency modes. To fully characterize the implemented\nsingle-photon subtractions, we employ quantum process tomography based on\ncoherent states. The mode-tunable coherent single-photon subtractor will be an\nessential element for realizing non-Gaussian quantum networks necessary to get\na quantum advantage in information processing.\n", "  Atomic monolayers represent a novel class of materials to study localized and\nfree excitons in two dimensions and to engineer optoelectronic devices based on\ntheir significant optical response. Here, we investigate the role of the\nsubstrate on the photoluminescense response of MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers\nexfoliated either on SiO$_2$ or epitaxially grown InGaP substrates. In the case\nof MoSe$_2$, we observe a significant qualitative modification of the emission\nspectrum, which is widely dominated by the trion resonance on InGaP substrates.\nHowever, the effects of inhomogeneous broadening of the emission features are\nstrongly reduced. Even more strikingly, in sheets of WSe$_2$, we could\nroutinely observe emission lines from localized excitons with linewidths down\nto the resolution limit of 70\\,$\\mu$ eV. This is in stark contrast to reference\nsamples featuring WSe$_2$ monolayers on SiO$_2$ surfaces, where the emission\nspectra from localized defects are widely dominated by spectral diffusion and\nblinking behaviour. Our experiment outlines the enormous potential of\nIII-V-monolayer hybrid architectures to obtain high quality emission signals\nfrom atomic monolayers, which are straight forward to integrate into\nnanophotonic and integrated optoelectronic devices.\n", "  We present a quantitative analysis on the response of a dilute active\nsuspension of self-propelled rods (swimmers) in a planar channel subjected to\nan imposed shear flow. To best capture the salient features of shear-induced\neffects, we consider the case of an imposed Couette flow, providing a constant\nshear rate across the channel. We argue that the steady-state behavior of\nswimmers can be understood in the light of a population splitting phenomenon,\noccurring as the shear rate exceeds a certain threshold, initiating the\nreversal of swimming direction for a finite fraction of swimmers from down- to\nupstream or vice versa, depending on swimmer position within the channel.\nSwimmers thus split into two distinct, statistically significant and oppositely\nswimming majority and minority populations. The onset of population splitting\ntranslates into a transition from a self-propulsion-dominated regime to a\nshear-dominated regime, corresponding to a unimodal-to-bimodal change in the\nprobability distribution function of the swimmer orientation. We present a\nphase diagram in terms of the swim and flow Peclet numbers showing the\nseparation of these two regimes by a discontinuous transition line. Our results\nshed further light on the behavior of swimmers in a shear flow and provide an\nexplanation for the previously reported non-monotonic behavior of the mean,\nnear-wall, parallel-to-flow orientation of swimmers with increasing shear\nstrength.\n", "  We consider the technologically relevant costs of operating a reliable bit\nthat can be erased rapidly. We find that both erasing and reliability times are\nnon-monotonic in the underlying friction, leading to a trade-off between\nerasing speed and bit reliability. Fast erasure is possible at the expense of\nlow reliability at moderate friction, and high reliability comes at the expense\nof slow erasure in the underdamped and overdamped limits. Within a given class\nof bit parameters and control strategies, we define \"optimal\" designs of bits\nthat meet the desired reliability and erasing time requirements with the lowest\noperational work cost. We find that optimal designs always saturate the bound\non the erasing time requirement, but can exceed the required reliability time\nif critically damped. The non-trivial geometry of the reliability and erasing\ntime-scales allows us to exclude large regions of parameter space as\nsub-optimal. We find that optimal designs are either critically damped or close\nto critical damping under the erasing procedure.\n", "  We present a relativistic description of electron vortex beams in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field. Including spin from the beginning reveals that\nspin-polarized electron vortex beams have a complicated azimuthal current\nstructure, containing small rings of counterrotating current between rings of\nstronger corotating current. Contrary to many other problems in relativistic\nquantum mechanics, there exists a set of vortex beams with exactly zero\nspin-orbit mixing in the highly relativistic and nonparaxial regime. The well\ndefined phase structure of these beams is analogous to simpler scalar vortex\nbeams, owing to the protection by the Zeeman effect. For states that do show\nspin-orbit mixing, the spin polarization across the beam is nonuniform\nrendering the spin and orbital degrees of freedom inherently inseparable.\n", "  We describe a two-orbital tight-binding model with bases belonging to the\n$\\Gamma_8$ quartet. The model captures several characteristics of the\nFermiology unravelled by the recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic\n(ARPES) measurements on cerium hexaboride CeB$_6$ samples cleaved along\ndifferent high-symmetry crystallographic directions, which includes the\nellipsoid-like Fermi surfaces (FSs) with major axes directed along $\\Gamma$-X.\nWe calculate various multipolar susceptibilities within the model and identify\nthe susceptibility that shows the strongest divergence in the presence of\nstandard onsite Coulomb interactions and discuss it's possible implication and\nrelevance with regard to the signature of strong ferromagnetic correlations\nexistent in various phases as shown by the recent experiments.\n", "  In this work, we have developed an elegant algorithm to study the\ncosmological consequences from a huge class of quantum field theories (i.e.\nsuperstring theory, supergravity, extra dimensional theory, modified gravity\netc.), which are equivalently described by soft attractors in the effective\nfield theory framework. In this description we have restricted our analysis for\ntwo scalar fields - dilaton and Higgsotic fields minimally coupled with\nEinstein gravity, which can be generalized for any arbitrary number of scalar\nfield contents with generalized non-canonical and non-minimal interactions. We\nhave explicitly used $R^2$ gravity, from which we have studied the attractor\nand non-attractor phase by exactly computing two point, three point and four\npoint correlation functions from scalar fluctuations using In-In\n(Schwinger-Keldysh) and $\\delta {\\cal N}$ formalism. We have also presented\ntheoretical bounds on the amplitude, tilt and running of the primordial power\nspectrum, various shapes (equilateral, squeezed, folded kite or counter\ncollinear) of the amplitude as obtained from three and four point scalar\nfunctions, which are consistent with observed data. Also the results from two\npoint tensor fluctuations and field excursion formula are explicitly presented\nfor attractor and non-attractor phase. Further, reheating constraints, scale\ndependent behaviour of the couplings and the dynamical solution for the dilaton\nand Higgsotic fields are also presented. New sets of consistency relations\nbetween two, three and four point observables are also presented, which shows\nsignificant deviation from canonical slow roll models. Additionally, three\npossible theoretical proposals have presented to overcome the tachyonic\ninstability at the time of late time acceleration. Finally, we have also\nprovided the bulk interpretation from the three and four point scalar\ncorrelation functions for completeness.\n", "  The past decade's apparent success in predicting and experimentally\ndiscovering distinct classes of topological insulators (TIs) and semimetals\nmasks a fundamental shortcoming: out of 200,000 stoichiometric compounds extant\nin material databases, only several hundred of them are topologically\nnontrivial. Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem\nwith the current piecemeal approach to finding them? To address this, we\npropose a new and complete electronic band theory that highlights the link\nbetween topology and local chemical bonding, and combines this with the\nconventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a\ndescription of the universal global properties of all possible band structures\nand materials, comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space\nand a dual group theoretical description in real space. We classify the\npossible band structures for all 230 crystal symmetry groups that arise from\nlocal atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial. We show how\nour topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the\npower of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.\n", "  We prove a new polygamy relation of multi-party quantum entanglement in terms\nof R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement of assistance for $\\left( {\\sqrt 7 - 1}\n\\right)/2\\leq\\alpha \\leq \\left( {\\sqrt 13 - 1} \\right)/2$. This class of\npolygamy inequality reduces to the polygamy inequality based on entanglement of\nassistance since R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement is a generalization of\nentanglement of formation. We further show that the polygamy inequality also\nholds for the $\\mu$th power of R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement of assistance.\n", "  We device an efficient book-keeping of excluded energy-sign and\nscattering-channel combinations for the loop four-momenta associated with\nmassive quasi-particles, circulating in (connected) bubble diagrams subject to\nvertex constraints inherited from the thermal ground state. The according\nradiative corrections modify the free thermal-quasiparticle pressure at one\nloop. Increasing the loop order in two-particle irreducible (2PI) bubble\ndiagrams, we exemplarily demonstrate a suppressing effect of the vertex\nconstraints on the number of valid combinations. This increasingly strong\nsuppression gave rise to the conjecture in hep-th/0609033 that the loop\nexpansion would terminate at a finite order. Albeit the low-temperature\ndependence of the 2PI 3-loop diagram complies with this behaviour, a thorough\nanalysis of the high-temperature situation reveals that the leading power in\ntemperature is thirteen such that this diagram dominates all lower loop orders\nfor sufficiently high temperatures. An all-loop-order resummation of 2PI\ndiagrams with dihedral symmetry is thus required, defining an extremely\nwell-bounded analytical continuation of the low-temperatures result.\n", "  We theoretically investigate Klein tunneling processes in photonic artificial\ngraphene. Klein tunneling is a phenomenon in which a particle with Dirac\ndispersion going through a potential step shows a characteristic angle- and\nenergy-dependent transmission. We consider a generic photonic system consisting\nof a honeycomb-shaped array of sites with losses, illuminated by coherent\nmonochromatic light. We show how the transmission and reflection coefficients\ncan be obtained from the steady-state field profile of the driven-dissipative\nsystem. Despite the presence of photonic losses, we recover the main scattering\nfeatures predicted by the general theory of Klein tunneling. Signatures of\nnegative refraction and the orientation dependence of the intervalley\nscattering are also highlighted. Our results will stimulate the experimental\nstudy of intricate transport phenomena using driven-dissipative photonic\nsimulators.\n", "  We study the effect of Freudenthal duality on supersymmetric extremal black\nhole attractors in N = 2, D = 4 ungauged supergravity. Freudenthal duality acts\non the dyonic black hole charges as an anti-involution which keeps the black\nhole entropy and the critical points of the effective black hole potential\ninvariant. We analyze its effect on the recently discovered distinct, mutually\nexclusive phases of axionic supersymmetric black holes, related to the\nexistence of non-trivial involutory constant matrices. In particular, we\nconsider a supersymmetric D0-D4-D6 black hole and we explicitly Freudenthal-map\nit to a supersymmetric D0-D2-D4-D6 black hole. We thus show that the charge\nrepresentation space of a supersymmetric D0-D2-D4-D6 black hole also contains\nmutually exclusive domains.\n", "  We discuss about the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST), anti-BRST and\n(anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations and derive their corresponding\nconserved charges in the case of a two (1+1)-dimensional (2D) self-interacting\nnon-Abelian gauge theory (without any interaction with matter fields). We point\nout a set of novel features that emerge out in the BRST and co-BRST analysis of\nthe above 2D gauge theory. The algebraic structures of the symmetry operators\n(and corresponding conserved charges) and their relationship with the\ncohomological operators of differential geometry are established, too. To be\nmore precise, we demonstrate the existence of a single Lagrangian density that\nrespects the continuous symmetries which obey proper algebraic structure of the\ncohomological operators of differential geometry. We lay emphasis on the\nexistence and properties of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions in the\ncontext of (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations and pinpoint\ntheir differences and similarities. All the observations, connected with the\n(anti-)co-BRST symmetries, are completely novel.\n", "  We present an embedding approach for semiconductors and insulators based on\nor- bital rotations in the space of occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. We have\nimplemented our approach in the popular VASP software package. We demonstrate\nits power for defect structures in silicon and polaron formation in titania,\ntwo challenging cases for conventional Kohn-Sham density functional theory.\n", "  Phoxonic crystal as a means of guiding and confining electromagnetic and\nelastic waves has already attracted attentions. Lack of exact knowledge on how\nthese two types of waves interact inside this crystal and how electromagnetic\nwave evolves through this interaction has increased this field complexity. Here\nwe explain how an elastic wave affects an electromagnetic wave through\nphoto-elasticity and interface displacement mechanisms in a phoxonic crystal\nslab waveguide. We obtain a master equation which can describe electromagnetic\nwave evolution. In this equation we define a coupling parameter and calculate\nits value for different modes of electromagnetic and elastic waves and show it\nvanishes for some types of modes . Finally we solve the master equation for a\ntypical phoxonic crystal slab waveguide and illustrate the electromagnetic wave\nevolution.\n", "  The determination of the CP nature of the Higgs coupling to top quarks is\naddressed in this paper, using $t{\\bar t} h$ events produced in $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nTeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Dileptonic final states are employed,\nwith two oppositely charged leptons and four jets, corresponding to the decays\n$t\\rightarrow bW^+ \\rightarrow b \\ell^+\\nu_\\ell$, $\\bar{t}\\rightarrow\n\\bar{b}W^- \\rightarrow \\bar{b} \\ell^-\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ and $h\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b}$. Pure scalar ($h=H$), pure pseudo-scalar ($h=A$) and CP-violating\nHiggs boson signal events, generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, are fully\nreconstructed through a kinematic fit. We furthermore generate samples that\nhave both a CP-even and a CP-odd component in the $t \\bar t h$ coupling in\norder to probe the ratio of the two components. New angular distributions of\nthe decay products, as well as CP angular asymmetries, are explored in order to\nseparate the scalar from the pseudo-scalar components of the Higgs boson and\nreduce the contribution from the dominant irreducible background, $t{\\bar\nt}b{\\bar b}$. Significant differences between the angular distributions and\nasymmetries are observed, even after the full kinematic fit reconstruction of\nthe events, allowing to define the best observables for a global fit of the\nHiggs couplings parameters.\n", "  We study the effective potential in renormalizable quantum gravity with a\nsingle dimensionless conformal coupling without a Landau pole. In order to\ndescribe a background-free dynamics at the Planck scale and beyond, the\nconformal-factor field is quantized exactly in a nonperturbative manner. Since\nthis field does not receive renormalization, the field-independent constant in\nthe effective potential becomes itself invariant under the renormalization\ngroup flow. That is to say, it gives the physical cosmological constant. We\nexplicitly calculate the physical cosmological constant at the one-loop level\nin the Landau gauge. We find that it is given by a function of renormalized\nquantities of the cosmological constant, the Planck mass and the coupling\nconstant, and it should be the observed value. It will give a new perspective\non the cosmological constant problem free from an ultraviolet cutoff.\n", "  We study the effect of inhomogeneity, which is induced by the graviton mass\nin massive gravity, on the mutual information and the chaotic behavior of a\n2+1-dimensional field theory from the gauge/gravity duality. When the system is\nnear-homogeneous, the mutual information increases as the graviton mass grows.\nHowever, when the system is far from homogeneity, the mutual information\ndecreases as the graviton mass increases. By adding the perturbations of energy\ninto the system, we investigate the dynamical mutual information in the shock\nwave geometry. We find that the greater perturbations disrupt the mutual\ninformation more rapidly, which resembles the butterfly effect in chaos theory.\nBesides, the greater inhomogeneity reduces the dynamical mutual information\nmore quickly just as in the static case.\n", "  Motivated by recent developments in perturbative calculations of the\nnonlinear evolution of large-scale structure, we present an iterative algorithm\nto reconstruct the initial conditions in a given volume starting from the dark\nmatter distribution in real space. In our algorithm, objects are first moved\nback iteratively along estimated potential gradients, with a progressively\nreduced smoothing scale, until a nearly uniform catalog is obtained. The linear\ninitial density is then estimated as the divergence of the cumulative\ndisplacement, with an optional second-order correction. This algorithm should\nundo nonlinear effects up to one-loop order, including the higher-order\ninfrared resummation piece. We test the method using dark matter simulations in\nreal space. At redshift $z=0$, we find that after eight iterations the\nreconstructed density is more than $95\\%$ correlated with the initial density\nat $k\\le 0.35\\; h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The reconstruction also reduces the power\nin the difference between reconstructed and initial fields by more than 2\norders of magnitude at $k\\le 0.2\\; h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and it extends the\nrange of scales where the full broadband shape of the power spectrum matches\nlinear theory by a factor of 2-3. As a specific application, we consider\nmeasurements of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale that can be\nimproved by reducing the degradation effects of large-scale flows. In our\nidealized dark matter simulations, the method improves the BAO signal-to-noise\nratio by a factor of 2.7 at $z=0$ and by a factor of 2.5 at $z=0.6$, improving\nstandard BAO reconstruction by $70\\%$ at $z=0$ and $30\\%$ at $z=0.6$, and\nmatching the optimal BAO signal and signal-to-noise ratio of the linear density\nin the same volume. For BAO, the iterative nature of the reconstruction is the\nmost important aspect.\n", "  We study the partition function of odd-dimensional conformal field theories\nplaced on spheres with a squashed metric. We establish that the round sphere\nprovides a local extremum for the free energy which, in general, is not a\nglobal extremum. In addition, we show that the leading quadratic correction to\nthe free energy around this extremum is proportional to the coefficient, $C_T$,\ndetermining the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor in the CFT.\nFor three-dimensional CFTs, we compute explicitly this proportionality constant\nfor a class of squashing deformations which preserve an $SU(2)\\times U(1)$\nisometry group on the sphere. In addition, we evaluate the free energy as a\nfunction of the squashing parameter for theories of free bosons, free fermions,\nas well as CFTs holographically dual to Einstein gravity with a negative\ncosmological constant. We observe that, after suitable normalization, the\ndependence of the free energy on the squashing parameter for all these theories\nis nearly universal for a large region of parameter space and is well\napproximated by a simple quadratic function arising from holography. We\ngeneralize our results to five-dimensional CFTs and, in this context, we also\nstudy theories holographically dual to six-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity.\n", "  Principles are central to physical reasoning, particularly in the search for\na theory of quantum gravity (QG), where novel empirical data is lacking. One\nprinciple widely adopted in the search for QG is UV completion: the idea that a\ntheory should (formally) hold up to all possible high energies. We\nargue---\\textit{contra} standard scientific practice---that UV-completion is\npoorly-motivated as a guiding principle in theory-construction, and cannot be\nused as a criterion of theory-justification in the search for QG. For this, we\nexplore the reasons for expecting, or desiring, a UV-complete theory, as well\nas analyse how UV completion is used, and how it should be used, in various\nspecific approaches to QG.\n", "  We study the origin of the universe (or pre-inflation) by suggesting that the\nprimordial space-time in the universe suffered a global topological phase\ntransition, from a 4D Euclidean manifold to an asymptotic 4D hyperbolic one. We\nintroduce a complex time, $\\tau$, such that its real part becomes dominant\nafter started the topological phase transition. Before the big bang, $\\tau$ is\na space-like coordinate, so that can be considered as a reversal variable.\nAfter the phase transition is converted in a causal variable. The formalism\nsolves in a natural manner the quantum to classical transition of the\ngeometrical relativistic quantum fluctuations: $\\sigma$, which has a geometric\norigin.\n", "  We study spin torques induced by Rashba spin-orbit coupling in\ntwo-dimensional ferromagnets under the good-metal condition\n$\\epsilon_{F}\\tau/\\hbar\\gg1$ ($\\epsilon_{F}$ the Fermi energy, $\\tau$ the\nelectron lifetime) by employing the Kubo formula. We find that, in the presence\nof spin-dependent disorder the Rashba torque changes greatly as the system\nevolves out of the weak disorder limit where $\\hbar/\\tau$ is much smaller than\nany intrinsic energy scale characterizing the multiband structure. The\nantidamping-like component of Rashba torque can be comparable to and larger\nthan the field-like one out of the weak disorder limit. The semiclassical\nBoltzmann theory produces the same results as microscopic linear response\ncalculations only in the weak disorder limit. Our analysis indicates that rich\nbehaviors of various nonequilibrium phenomena beyond the Boltzmann theory may\nalso be present even when $\\epsilon_{F}\\tau/\\hbar\\gg1$ in multiband systems\nwhere $\\epsilon_{F}$ is not the unique intrinsic energy scale.\n", "  Flux growth of single crystals is normally performed in a vertical\nconfiguration with an upright refractory container holding the flux melt. At\nhigh temperatures, flux dissolves the charge forming a homogeneous solution\nbefore nucleation and growth of crystals take place under proper\nsupersaturation generated by cooling or evaporating the flux. In this work, we\nreport flux growth in a horizontal configuration with a temperature gradient\nalong the horizontal axis: a liquid transport growth analogous to the vapor\ntransport technique. In a typical liquid transport growth, the charge is kept\nat the hot end of the refractory container and the flux melt dissolves the\ncharge and transfers it to the cold end. Once the concentration of charge is\nabove the solubility limit at the cold end, the thermodynamically stable phase\nnucleates and grows. Compared to the vertical flux growth, the liquid transport\ngrowth can provide a large quantity of crystals in a single growth since the\ncharge/flux ratio is not limited by the solubility limit at the growth\ntemperature. This technique is complementary to the vertical flux growth and\ncan be considered when a large amount of crystals are needed but the yield from\nthe conventional vertical flux growth is limited. We applied this technique to\nthe growth of IrSb$_3$, Mo$_3$Sb$_7$, MnBi from self flux, and the growth of\nFeSe, CrTe$_3$, NiPSe$_3$, FePSe$_3$, and InCuP$_2$S$_6$ from a halide flux.\n", "  We investigate certain properties of $\\mathfrak{su}(N)$-valued\ntwo-dimensional soliton surfaces associated with the integrable\n$\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ sigma models constructed by the orthogonal rank-one\nHermitian projectors, which are defined on the two-dimensional Riemann sphere\nwith finite action functional. Several new properties of the projectors mapping\nonto one-dimensional subspaces as well as their relations with three mutually\ndifferent immersion formulas, namely, the generalized Weierstrass, Sym-Tafel\nand Fokas-Gel'fand have been discussed in detail. Explicit connections among\nthese three surfaces are also established by purely analytical descriptions\nand, it is demonstrated that the three immersion formulas actually correspond\nto the single surface parametrized by some specific conditions.\n", "  In this letter we analyze the effects of an externally applied electric field\non thermal fluctuations for a fluid containing charged species. We show in\nparticular that the fluctuating Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for charged\nmultispecies diffusion coupled with the fluctuating fluid momentum equation,\nresult in enhanced charge transport. Although this transport is advective in\nnature, it can macroscopically be represented as electrodiffusion with\nrenormalized electric conductivity. We calculate the renormalized electric\nconductivity by deriving and integrating the structure factor coefficients of\nthe fluctuating quantities and show that the renormalized electric conductivity\nand diffusion coefficients are consistent although they originate from\ndifferent noise terms. In addition, the fluctuating hydrodynamics approach\nrecovers the electrophoretic and relaxation corrections obtained by\nDebye-Huckel-Onsager theory, and provides a quantitative theory that predicts a\nnon-zero cross-diffusion Maxwell-Stefan coefficient that agrees well with\nexperimental measurements. Finally, we show that strong applied electric fields\nresult in anisotropically enhanced velocity fluctuations and reduced\nfluctuations of salt concentrations.\n", "  A numerical method for free boundary problems for the equation \\[\nu_{xx}-q(x)u=u_t \\] is proposed. The method is based on recent results from\ntransmutation operators theory allowing one to construct efficiently a complete\nsystem of solutions for this equation generalizing the system of heat\npolynomials. The corresponding implementation algorithm is presented.\n", "  We have analyzed in detail the propagation of a minimally coupled massless\nscalar field in the gravitational background of a four-dimensional\nEinstein-Born-Infeld dilaton charged black hole. We have obtained analytical\nexpressions for the absorption cross section as well as for the decay rate for\nthe scalar field in the aforementioned spacetime, and we have shown graphically\nits behavior for different values of the free parameters of the theory.\n", "  We report the independent experimental confirmation of an isomeric state in\nthe proton drip-line nucleus $^{26}$P. The ${\\gamma}$-ray energy and half-life\ndetermined are 164.4 $\\pm$ 0.3 (sys) $\\pm$ 0.2 (stat) keV and 104 $\\pm$ 14 ns,\nrespectively, which are in agreement with the previously reported values. These\nvalues are used to set a semi-empirical limit on the proton separation energy\nof $^{26}$P, with the conclusion that it can be bound or unbound.\n", "  In this paper we propose a very special relativity (VSR)-inspired description\nof the axion electrodynamics. This proposal is based upon the construction of a\nproper study of the SIM$(2)$--VSR gauge-symmetry. It is shown that the VSR\nnonlocal effects give a health departure from the usual axion field theory. The\naxionic classical dynamics is analysed in full detail, first by a discussion of\nits solution in the presence of an external magnetic field. Next, we compute\nphoton-axion transition in VSR scenario by means of Primakoff interaction,\nshowing the change of a linearly polarized light to a circular one. Afterwards,\nduality symmetry is discussed in the VSR framework.\n", "  PKS 1155+251 is a radio-loud quasar source at z=0.203. Observations using\nvery long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at ~2, 5, 8 and 15 GHz show that the\nstructure of the radio source is quite complicated on parsec scales and that\nthe outer hot spots are apparently undergoing a significant contraction.\nBecause these results cannot be fully explained based on the compact symmetric\nobject (CSO) scenario with a radio core located between the northern and\nsouthern complexes, we made observations with the Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA) at 24 and 43 GHz to search for compact substructures and alternative\ninterpretations. The results show that the radio core revealed in the previous\nVLBI observations remains compact with a flat spectrum in our\nsub-milli-arcsecond--resolution images; the northern lobe emission becomes\nfaint at 24 GHz and is mostly resolving out at 43 GHz; the southern complex is\nmore bright but has been resolved into the brightest southern-end (S1) and jet\nor tail alike components westwards. Explaining the southern components aligned\nwestward with a standard CSO scenario alone remains a challenge. As for the\nflatter spectral index of the southern-end component S1 between 24 and 43 GHz\nin our observations and the significant 15 GHz VLBA flux variability of S1, an\nalternative scenario is that the southern complex may be powered by a secondary\nblack hole residing at S1. But more sensitive and high-resolution VLBI\nmonitoring is required to discriminate the CSO and the binary black hole\nscenarios.\n", "  We have derived a general separability criterion for a class of two mode\nnon-Gaussian continuous variable systems, obtained earlier using PPT, violation\nof which provides sufficient condition for entanglement. It has been obtained\nby utilizing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and from the basic definition of\nseparable states. This criterion coincides with the work of Agarwal and Biswas\n[4] which involved inequality involving higher order correlation, for testing\nentanglement in non-Gaussian states.\n", "  We prove a tight uniform continuity bound for a family of entropies which\nincludes the von Neumann entropy, the Tsallis entropy and the $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi\nentropy, $S_\\alpha$, for $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$. We establish necessary and\nsufficient conditions for equality in the continuity bound and prove that these\nconditions are the same for every member of the family. Our result builds on\nrecent work in which we constructed a state which was majorized by every state\nin a neighbourhood ($\\varepsilon$-ball) of a given state, and thus was the\nminimal state in majorization order in the $\\varepsilon$-ball. This minimal\nstate satisfies a particular semigroup property, which we exploit to prove our\nbound.\n", "  We investigate the special K\\\"ahler geometry of the base of the Hitchin\nintegrable system in terms of spectral curves and topological recursion. The\nTaylor expansion of the special K\\\"ahler metric about any point in the base may\nbe computed by integrating the $g = 0$ Eynard-Orantin invariants of the\ncorresponding spectral curve over cycles. In particular, we show that the\nDonagi-Markman cubic is computed by the invariant $W^{(0)}_3$. We use\ntopological recursion to go one step beyond this and compute the symmetric\nquartic of second derivatives of the period matrix.\n", "  This paper presents an overview and discussion of magnetocapillary\nself-assemblies. New results are presented, in particular concerning the\npossible development of future applications. These self-organizing structures\npossess the notable ability to move along an interface when powered by an\noscillatory, uniform magnetic field. The system is constructed as follows. Soft\nmagnetic particles are placed on a liquid interface, and submitted to a\nmagnetic induction field. An attractive force due to the curvature of the\ninterface around the particles competes with an interaction between magnetic\ndipoles. Ordered structures can spontaneously emerge from these conditions.\nFurthermore, time-dependent magnetic fields can produce a wide range of dynamic\nbehaviours, including non-time-reversible deformation sequences that produce\ntranslational motion at low Reynolds number. In other words, due to a\nspontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the assembly can turn into a\nsurface microswimmer. Trajectories have been shown to be precisely\ncontrollable. As a consequence, this system offers a way to produce microrobots\nable to perform different tasks. This is illustrated in this paper by the\ncapture, transport and release of a floating cargo, and the controlled mixing\nof fluids at low Reynolds number.\n", "  With the aid of the symbolic computations software; Wolfram Mathematica 9,\nthe powerful sine-Gordon expansion method is used in examining the analytical\nsolution of the longitudinal wave equation in a magneto-electro-elastic\ncircular rod. Sine-Gordon expansion method is based on the well-known\nsine-Gordon equation and a wave transformation. The longitudinal wave equation\nis an equation that arises in mathematical physics with dispersion caused by\nthe transverse Poisson's effect in a magneto-electro-elastic circular rod. We\nsuccessfully get some solutions with the complex, trigonometric and hyperbolic\nfunction structure. We present the numerical simulations of all the obtained\nsolutions by choosing appropriate values of the parameters. We give the\nphysical meanings of some of the obtained analytical solutions which\nsignificantly explain some practical physical problems.\n", "  The thermo-kinetic inhibition mechanism of six imidazolium-based ionic\nliquids (ILs) on methane clathrate hydrate formation and growth is studied in\nthis work using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The ionic liquids\ninvestigated include\n1-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-3-methylimidazoliumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide\n([C3(OH)2mim][f2N]), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium\nbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide ([C2OHmim][f2N]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium\ntetrafluoroborate ([C2mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate\n([C4mim][BF4]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][OAc]) and\n1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ethylsulfate ([C2mim][EtSO4]). Simulations showed\nthat [C2OHmim][f2N] and [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] are strongly hydrated compared to\nother ILs because of hydrogen bonding between OH groups of the cation and water\nmolecules. They also exhibit high diffusion rates towards crystal surface and\nbond to it through strong intermolecular interactions. As a result, these two\nILs are stronger thermo-kinetic inhibitors for formation and growth of methane\nhydrates compared to other ILs studied in this work as well as conventional\ninhibitors like methanol and NaCl. The simulations also revealed that cations\nof [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] show that the presence of ions near the\nhydrate crystal causes hindrance for water and guest molecules adsorbing on the\nhydrate surface, which inhibits the growth of hydrate crystals. In addition, it\nis shown that [C3(OH)2mim][f2N] and [C2OHmim][f2N] are more likely to inhibit\nhydrate formation.\n", "  In this paper, we present an analytical calculation of the rotational\nmobility functions of a particle rotating on the centerline of an elastic\ncylindrical tube whose membrane exhibits resistance towards shearing and\nbending. We find that the correction to the particle rotational mobility about\nthe cylinder axis depends solely on membrane shearing properties while both\nshearing and bending manifest themselves for the rotational mobility about an\naxis perpendicular to the cylinder axis. In the quasi-steady limit of vanishing\nfrequency, the particle rotational mobility nearby a no-slip rigid cylinder is\nrecovered only if the membrane possesses a non-vanishing resistance towards\nshearing. We further show that for the asymmetric rotation along the cylinder\nradial axis, a coupling between shearing and bending exists. Our analytical\npredictions are compared and validated with corresponding boundary integral\nsimulations where a very good agreement is obtained.\n", "  A semi-process is an analog of the semi-flow for non-autonomous differential\nequations or inclusions. We prove an abstract result on the existence of\nmeasurable semi-processes in the situations where there is no uniqueness. Also,\nwe allow solutions to blow up in finite time and then obtain local\nsemi-processes.\n", "  Effects associated with the change in the local density of photonic states in\na periodic structure based on alternating \\textit{a}-Si$_{1-x}$C$_x$:H and\n\\textit{a}-SiO$_2$ amorphous layers forming a one-dimensional (1D) photonic\ncrystal have been analyzed. The use of \\textit{a}-Si$_{1-x}$C$_x$:H as the\nemitting material made it possible to examine the transformation of the\nphotoluminescence spectrum contour that is comparable in width with the\nphotonic stop-band. It was experimentally demonstrated that the emission is\nenhanced and suppressed in the vicinity of the stop-band. The relative\nintensities of the luminescence peaks at different edges of the stop-band vary\nwith the detuning of the stop-band position and photoluminescence peak of a\nsingle \\textit{a}-Si$_{1-x}$C$_x$:H film. The Purcell effect in the system\nunder consideration was theoretically described by the method in which the\nlocal density of photonic states is calculated in terms of a 1D model. %A good\nagreement was obtained between the experimentally measured and calculated\nspectra. It was shown that the specific part of local density of states\nsubstantially increases at the long-wavelength (low-frequency) edge of the\nstop-band of a 1D photonic crystal as a result of the predominant localization\nof the electric field of the light wave in the spatial regions of\n\\textit{a}-Si$_{1-x}$C$_x$:H which have a higher relative permittivity as\ncompared with \\textit{a}-SiO$_2$.\n", "  Soliton self-frequency shifts (SSFS) can be suppressed in optical fibers\nthrough spectral recoil, but this process leads to losses through continuous\ntransfer of energy to a dispersive wave. We demonstrate a novel way to alter\nthe strength of SSFS in photonic crystal fibers through a frequency-dependent\nnonlinear parameter $\\gamma(\\omega)$. Our numerical simulations show both\nsuppression and enhancement of SSFS depending on the sign of nonlinear slope. A\nlarge enough positive value of this slope can lead to total suppression of\nSSFS, without spectral recoil and without energy transfer to a resonant\ndispersive wave. Numerical simulations are supported by mathematical\npredictions based on the moment method.\n", "  The partition function for quantum weighted double Hurwitz numbers can be\ninterpreted in terms of the energy distribution of a quantum Bose gas with\nvanishing fugacity. We compute the leading term of the partition function and\nthe quantum weighted Hurwitz numbers in the zero temperature limit $T\n\\rightarrow 0$, as well as the next order corrections. The leading term is\nshown to reproduce the case of uniformly weighted Hurwitz numbers of Belyi\ncurves. In particular, the KP or Toda $\\tau$-function serving as generating\nfunction for the quantum Hurwitz numbers is shown in the limit to give the one\nfor Belyi curves and, with suitable scaling, the same holds true for the\npartition function, the weights and the expectations of Hurwitz numbers.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for micron-scale acoustic wave components and\ncircuits on chip in solid planar structures that do not require suspension. We\nleverage evanescent guiding of acoustic waves by high slowness contrast\nmaterials readily available in silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor\n(CMOS) processes. High slowness contrast provides strong confinement of GHz\nfrequency acoustic fields in micron-scale structures. We address the\nfundamental implications of intrinsic material and radiation losses on\noperating frequency, bandwidth, device size and as a result practicality of\nmulti-element microphononic circuits based on solid embedded waveguides. We\nshow that a family of acoustic components based on evanescently guided acoustic\nwaves, including waveguide bends, evanescent couplers, Y-splitters, and\nacoustic-wave microring resonators, can be realized in compact, micron-scale\nstructures, and provide basic scaling and performance arguments for these\ncomponents based on material properties and simulations. We further find that\nwave propagation losses are expected to permit high quality factor (Q),\nnarrowband resonators and propagation lengths allowing delay lines and the\ncoupling or cascading of multiple components to form functional circuits, of\npotential utility in guided acoustic signal processing on chip. We also address\nand simulate bends and radiation loss, providing insight into routing and\nresonators. Such circuits could be monolithically integrated with electronic\nand photonic circuits on a single chip with expanded capabilities.\n", "  We present results of multicolor UBVRI observations of the type 1 Seyfert\ngalaxy (SyG 1) NGC 7469 carried out at the 1.5-meter telescope of the Maidanak\nObservatory (Uzbekistan) in 2008-2014. Analysis of the light curves indicates\nthe presence of another slow flare of a long-term variability in 2009-2014 with\na maximum in 2011-2012. We investigate properties of the long-term variability\nin 2009-2014, present (U-B)-(B-V) color diagrams for maxima and minima of NGC\n7469 nuclear variability using various apertures and compare them with the\nblack-body gas radiation which models the accretion disk radiation. Color-index\nmeasurements shows that the color becomes bluer at maximum brightness,\nindicating a higher temperature of the accretion disk. We have analysed the\nrelation of X-ray and optical variability of NGC 7469 in 2008 and 2009 in\ncomparison with the activity minimum in 2003. In 2008 the correlation\ncoefficient between the X-ray and optical radiation is close to 0.5. Such poor\ncorrelation can be explained by the influence of an SN 1a explosion in close\nproximity to the nucleus of NGC 7469. The SN manifests itself in the optical\nband but does not affect the X-ray variability pattern. Comparison of the\nvariability data in 2009 reveals a good correlation between the optical (U\nband) and the X-ray (7-10 keV) variability with the correlation coefficient of\nabout 0.93. The correlation coefficient and the lag depend on the wavelength in\nthe optical and X-ray bands. The lag between the X-ray and optical fluxes in\n2009 is 2-4 days. In 2003 the lag is almost zero.\n", "  To investigate the role of tachysterol in the photophysical/chemical\nregulation of vitamin D photosynthesis, we studied its electronic absorption\nproperties and excited state dynamics using time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT), coupled cluster theory (CC2), and non-adiabatic molecular\ndynamics. In excellent agreement with experiments, the simulated electronic\nspectrum shows a broad absorption band covering the spectra of the other\nvitamin D photoisomers. The broad band stems from the spectral overlap of four\ndifferent ground state rotamers. After photoexcitation, the first excited\nsinglet state (S1) decays within 882 fs. The S1 dynamics is characterized by a\nstrong twisting of the central double bond. 96% of all trajectories relax\nwithout chemical transformation to the ground state. In 2.3 % of the\ntrajectories we observed [1,5]-sigmatropic hydrogen shift forming the partly\ndeconjugated toxisterol D1. 1.4 % previtamin D formation is observed via\nhula-twist double bond isomerization. We find a strong dependence between\nphotoreactivity and dihedral angle conformation: hydrogen shift only occurs in\ncEc and cEt rotamers and double bond isomerization occurs mainly in cEc\nrotamers. Our study confirms the hypothesis that cEc rotamers are more prone to\nprevitamin D formation than other isomers. We also observe the formation of a\ncyclobutene-toxisterol in the hot ground state (0.7 %). Due to its strong\nabsorption and unreactive behavior, tachysterol acts mainly as a sun shield\nsuppressing previtamin D formation. Tachysterol shows stronger toxisterol\nformation than previtamin D. Absorption of low energy UV light by the cEc\nrotamer can lead to previtamin D formation. Our study reinforces a recent\nhypothesis that tachysterol can act as a previtamin D source when only low\nenergy ultraviolet light is available, as it is the case in winter or in the\nmorning and evening hours of the day.\n", "  Understanding the relationship between the structure of light-harvesting\nsystems and their excitation energy transfer properties is of fundamental\nimportance in many applications including the development of next generation\nphotovoltaics. Natural light harvesting in photosynthesis shows remarkable\nexcitation energy transfer properties, which suggests that pigment-protein\ncomplexes could serve as blueprints for the design of nature inspired devices.\nMechanistic insights into energy transport dynamics can be gained by leveraging\nnumerically involved propagation schemes such as the hierarchical equations of\nmotion (HEOM). Solving these equations, however, is computationally costly due\nto the adverse scaling with the number of pigments. Therefore virtual\nhigh-throughput screening, which has become a powerful tool in material\ndiscovery, is less readily applicable for the search of novel excitonic\ndevices. We propose the use of artificial neural networks to bypass the\ncomputational limitations of established techniques for exploring the\nstructure-dynamics relation in excitonic systems. Once trained, our neural\nnetworks reduce computational costs by several orders of magnitudes. Our\npredicted transfer times and transfer efficiencies exhibit similar or even\nhigher accuracies than frequently used approximate methods such as secular\nRedfield theory\n", "  We provide a new perspective on non-Hermitian evolution in quantum mechanics\nby emphasizing the same method as in the Hermitian quantum evolution. We first\ngive a precise description of the non unitary evolution, and collecting the\nbasic results around it and postulating the norm preserving. This cautionary\npostulate imposing that the time evolution of a non Hermitian quantum system\npreserves the inner products between the associated states must not be read\nnaively. We also give an example showing that the solutions of time-dependent\nnon Hermitian Hamiltonian systems given by a linear combination of SU(1,1) and\nSU(2) are obtained thanks to time-dependent non-unitary transformation.\n", "  We introduce FORM 4.2, a new minor release of the symbolic manipulation\ntoolkit. We demonstrate several new features, such as a new pattern matching\noption, new output optimization, and automatic expansion of rational functions.\n", "  Using the most basic mathematical tools, I present the full analysis of the\nexperiment decribed in [A. Danan, D. Farfurnik, S. Bar-Ad, and L. Vaidman, {\\em\nPhys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf 111}, 240402 (2013)]. First, I confirm that the data\npresented therein are in full agreement with the standard quantum mechanics. I\nthen show other symptoms of presence of photons at all mirrors in the setup. I\nthen analytically explain both the absence of peaks a Readers of [A. Danan, D.\nFarfurnik, S. Bar-Ad, and L. Vaidman, {\\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf 111}, 240402\n(2013)] are made to expect and presence of those not discussed in the\nReference.\n", "  We propose a minority route choice game to investigate the effect of the\nnetwork structure on traffic network performance under the assumption of\ndrivers' bounded rationality. We investigate ring-and-hub topologies to capture\nthe nature of traffic networks in cities, and employ a minority game-based\ninductive learning process to model the characteristic behavior under the route\nchoice scenario. Through numerical experiments, we find that topological\nchanges in traffic networks induce a phase transition from an uncongested phase\nto a congested phase. Understanding this phase transition is helpful in\nplanning new traffic networks.\n", "  Neural networks are composed of neurons and synapses, which are responsible\nfor learning in a slow adaptive dynamical process. Here we experimentally show\nthat neurons act like independent anisotropic multiplex hubs, which relay and\nmute incoming signals following their input directions. Theoretically, the\nobserved information routing enriches the computational capabilities of neurons\nby allowing, for instance, equalization among different information routes in\nthe network, as well as high-frequency transmission of complex time-dependent\nsignals constructed via several parallel routes. In addition, this kind of hubs\nadaptively eliminate very noisy neurons from the dynamics of the network,\npreventing masking of information transmission. The timescales for these\nfeatures are several seconds at most, as opposed to the imprint of information\nby the synaptic plasticity, a process which exceeds minutes. Results open the\nhorizon to the understanding of fast and adaptive learning realities in higher\ncognitive functionalities of the brain.\n", "  A metamaterial absorber converts solar radiation into heat for applications\nin thermoelectric generators and solar thermophotovoltaics. A metamaterial\nabsorber typically consists of metallic parts separated by an insulator layer\nwhich does not allow the total heat extraction via direct heat conduction.\nHere, we propose wide-angle and broadband metamaterial absorber comprising an\ninsulator layer, metal grating, and metal back plane (IMM) that allows the\ntotal heat extraction via direct heat conduction. We have formulated the\nquasi-analytical solution (QANS) of the IMM-absorber by applying the\ncoupled-mode analysis with new technique for taking finite dielectric constant\nof a metal into account. The QANS are consistent with finite difference time\ndomain (FDTD) simulation. We fine that the IMM-absorbers made by tungsten and\nsilver metals give the best and worse average absorbance over the wavelength\nrange 400-1,200 nm, respectively. The best IMM-absorber shows the optimized\naverage absorbance 96.2%. The broadband absorption results from the excitations\nof insulator-metal waveguide resonance and slit waveguide resonance that are\ninsensitive to incident angles. The averaged absorbance is above 90.0% for the\nincident angles 0-66 degree. The IMM-absorber performance may be enhanced by\nusing metal rod array with engineered supperlattice.\n", "  Pure Yang-Mills amplitudes with all external gluons carrying positive\nhelicity, known as all-plus amplitudes, have an especially simple structure.\nThe tree amplitudes vanish and, up to at least two loops, the loop-level\namplitudes are related to those of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills (SYM)\ntheory. This makes all-plus amplitudes a useful testing ground for new methods\nof simplifying more general classes of amplitudes. In this thesis we consider\nthree new approaches, focusing on the structure before integration.\n", "  Catastrophic failures are complete and sudden collapses in the activity of\nlarge networks such as economics, electrical power grids and computer networks,\nwhich typically require a manual recovery process. Here we experimentally show\nthat excitatory neural networks are governed by a non-Poissonian reoccurrence\nof catastrophic failures, where their repetition time follows a multimodal\ndistribution characterized by a few tenths of a second and tens of seconds\ntimescales. The mechanism underlying the termination and reappearance of\nnetwork activity is quantitatively shown here to be associated with nodal\ntime-dependent features, neuronal plasticity, where hyperactive nodes damage\nthe response capability of their neighbors. It presents a complementary\nmechanism for the emergence of Poissonian catastrophic failures from damage\nconductivity. The effect that hyperactive nodes degenerate their neighbors\nrepresents a type of local competition which is a common feature in the\ndynamics of real-world complex networks, whereas their spontaneous recoveries\nrepresent a vitality which enhances reliable functionality.\n", "  The increasing number of recording electrodes enhances the capability of\ncapturing the network's cooperative activity, however, using too many monitors\nmight alter the properties of the measured neural network and induce noise.\nUsing a technique that merges simultaneous multi-patch-clamp and\nmulti-electrode array recordings of neural networks in-vitro, we show that the\nmembrane potential of a single neuron is a reliable and super-sensitive probe\nfor monitoring such cooperative activities and their detailed rhythms.\nSpecifically, the membrane potential and the spiking activity of a single\nneuron are either highly correlated or highly anti-correlated with the\ntime-dependent macroscopic activity of the entire network. This surprising\nobservation also sheds light on the cooperative origin of neuronal burst in\ncultured networks. Our findings present an alternative flexible approach to the\ntechnique based on a massive tiling of networks by large-scale arrays of\nelectrodes to monitor their activity.\n", "  Quasicrystals possess long-range order but lack the translational symmetry of\ncrystalline solids. In solid state physics, periodicity is one of the\nfundamental properties that prescribes the electronic band structure in\ncrystals. In the absence of periodicity and the presence of quasicrystalline\norder, the ways that electronic states change remain a mystery. Scanning\ntunneling microscopy and atomic manipulation can be used to assemble a\ntwo-dimensional quasicrystalline structure mapped upon the Penrose tiling.\nHere, carbon monoxide molecules are arranged on the surface of Cu(111) one at a\ntime to form the potential landscape that mimics the ionic potential of atoms\nin natural materials by constraining the electrons in the two-dimensional\nsurface state of Cu(111). The real-space images reveal the presence of the\nquasiperiodic order in the electronic wave functions and the Fourier analysis\nof our results links the energy of the resonant states to the local vertex\nstructure of the quasicrystal.\n", "  An increasing number of papers propose routes to implement thermal\ncounterparts of electronic rectification. These schemes are mainly based on\ncombinations of crystal anharmonicity and broken mirror symmetry. With respect\nto graphene, proposals pivot around shape asymmetry induced by using\nhetero-structures of nano-patterned or defected sections of pristine graphene.\nUsing Molecular Dynamics (MD) we show that it suffices to split a graphene\nnano-ribbon into two unequal strained sections using external force which leads\nto large asymmetry in the forward and reverse heat fluxes. We find that the\ncorresponding rectification ratio is enhanced by up to 60 %. Also, and more\nimportantly, the polarity is controllable on-the-fly, i.e. by changing the\nposition where force is applied. Based upon our results we propose a\nthermo-electric device which obviates the complex nano-patterning and\nlithography required to pattern graphene every time a new rectification value\nor sign is sought for, opening a route to simpler fabrication and\ncharacterization of phononic phenomena in 2D materials.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations of a tangent-soft-sphere bead-spring\npolymer model, we examine the degree to which semiflexible polymer melts\nsolidify at isostaticity. Flexible and stiff chains crystallize when they are\nisostatic as defined by appropriate degree-of-freedom-counting arguments.\nSemiflexible chains also solidify when isostatic if a generalized isostaticity\ncriterion that accounts for the slow freezing out of configurational freedom as\nchain stiffness increases is employed. The dependence of the average\ncoordination number at solidification $Z(T_s)$ on chains' characteristic ratio\n$C_\\infty$ has the same functional form [$Z \\simeq a - b\\ln(C_\\infty)$] as the\ndependence of the average coordination number at jamming $Z(\\phi_J)$ on\n$C_\\infty$ in athermal systems, suggesting that jamming-related phenomena play\na significant role in thermal polymer solidification.\n", "  We study the duality between theories of a fundamental scalar or fermion\ncoupled to $U(N)$ Chern-Simons gauge theory at the level of the three-sphere\npartition function, or equivalently entanglement entropy across a circle. The\nduality relation between the sphere free energies of the large $N$ bosonic and\nfermionic conformal theories is sensitive to certain shifts in the Chern-Simons\nlevel already at order $N$. We first study a similar duality in a ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theory, where it can be checked exactly\nusing localization. At large $N$, the free energies of supersymmetric and\nnon-supersymmetric theories are related in a simple way, and we use this fact\nto obtain an explicit solution for the scalar and fermion free energies which\nobey the duality map and have the expected weak and strong coupling behaviors.\nWe also suggest that a worldline representation of the free energy allows to\nrelate its calculation to a sum of Wilson loops in pure Chern-Simons theory. In\nthe supersymmetric case, we find that this approach precisely reproduces the\nlocalization prediction. In the non-supersymmetric case, we observe that a\nresult consistent with the boson/fermion duality can be obtained using a\ncertain framing prescription, which remains to be understood. We also briefly\ndiscuss the case of massive theories, and compare the small mass expansion of\nthe free energy to previously known results for the correlation functions of\nbilinear operators in flat space.\n"]}
