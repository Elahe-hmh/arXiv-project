A crucial role is played by integral\nlattices of the division algebras and associated discrete matrix groups. Our\nfindings can be summarized by saying that the even subgroups, W^+, of the\nKac-Moody Weyl groups, W, are isomorphic to generalized modular groups over K\nfor the simply laced algebras, and to certain finite extensions thereof for the\nnon-simply laced algebras. This hints at an extended theory of modular forms\nand functions.\n", "  The convergence of the Rayleigh-Ritz method with nonlinear parameters\noptimized through minimization of the trace of the truncated matrix is\ndemonstrated by a comparison with analytically known eigenstates of various\nquasi-solvable systems. We show that the basis of the harmonic oscillator\neigenfunctions with optimized frequency ? enables determination of boundstate\nenergies of one-dimensional oscillators to an arbitrary accuracy, even in the\ncase of highly anharmonic multi-well potentials. The same is true in the\nspherically symmetric case of V (r) = {\\omega}2r2 2 + {\\lambda}rk, if k > 0.\nFor spiked oscillators with k < -1, the basis of the pseudoharmonic oscillator\neigenfunctions with two parameters ? and {\\gamma} is more suitable, and\noptimization of the latter appears crucial for a precise determination of the\nspectrum.\n", "  A one-dimensional system of two trapped bosons which interact through a\ncontact potential is studied using the optimized configuration interaction\nmethod. The rapid convergence of the method is demonstrated for trapping\npotentials of convex and non-convex shapes. The energy spectra, as well as\nnatural orbitals and their occupation numbers are determined in function of the\ninter-boson interaction strength. Entanglement characteristics are discussed in\ndependence on the shape of the confining potential.\n", "  We study a two-dimensional system of two Coulombically interacting electrons\nin an external harmonic confining potential. More precisely, we present\ncalculations for the singlet ground-state of the system. We explain the nature\nof the degeneracy in the spectrum of the reduced density matrix and provide\ndetailed results for the dependencies of the entanglement on the interaction\nstrength. Among other features, it is indicated that in the limit of an\ninfinitely strong interaction, the angular and radial correlations are\nasymptotically independent of each other. Appearing in this limit, the pure\nradial correlation effects are quantitatively investigated for the first time.\n", "  We consider a class of asymptotic representations of the Borel subalgebra of\nthe quantum affine superalgebra U_q(gl(M|N)^). This is characterized by\nDrinfeld rational fractions. In particular, we consider contractions of\nU_q(gl(M|N)) in the FRT formulation and obtain explicit solutions of the graded\nYang-Baxter equation in terms of q-oscillator superalgebras. These solutions\ncorrespond to L-operators for Baxter Q-operators. We also discuss an extension\nof these representations to the ones for contracted algebras of U_q(gl(M|N)^)\nby considering the action of renormalized generators of the other side of the\nBorel subalgebra. We define model independent universal Q-operators as the\nsupertrace of the universal R-matrix and write universal T-operators in terms\nof these Q-operators based on shift operators on the supercharacters. These\ninclude our previous work on U_q(sl(2|1)^) case [arXiv:0805.4274] in part, and\nalso give a cue for the operator realization of our Wronskian-like formulas on\nT-and Q-functions in [arXiv:0906.2039, arXiv:1109.5524].\n", "  We measure an aluminum superconducting double quantum dot and find that its\nelectrical impedance, specifically its quantum capacitance, depends on whether\nor not it contains a single broken Cooper pair. In this way we are able to\nobserve, in real time, the thermally activated breaking and recombination of\nCooper pairs. Furthermore, we apply external microwave light and break single\nCooper pairs by the absorption of single microwave photons.\n", "  We study a system of two Coulombically interacting electrons in an external\nharmonic potential in the presence of an on-centre Coulomb impurity. Detailed\nresults for the dependencies of the reduced von Neumann entropy on the control\nparameters of the system are provided for both the ground state and the triplet\nS states with the lowest energy. Among other features, it is found that in the\nweak confinement regime the entanglement is strongly affected by the presence\nof an acceptor impurity.\n", "  We bring attention to the fact that Maxwell's mean free path for a dilute\nhard-sphere gas in thermal equilibrium, $(\\sqrt{2}\\sigma n)^{-1}$, which is\nordinarily obtained by multiplying the average speed by the average time\nbetween collisions, is also the statistical mean of the distribution of free\npath lengths in such a gas.\n", "  In this paper we study Jackiw-Rebbi model, in which a massless fermion is\ncoupled to the kink of $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory through a Yukawa interaction. In\nthe original Jackiw-Rebbi model the soliton is prescribed. However, we are\ninterested in the back-reaction of the fermion on the soliton besides the\neffect of the soliton on the fermion. Also, as a particular example, we\nconsider a minimal supersymmetric kink model, $\\mathcal{N}=1$, in ($1+1$)\ndimensions. In this case, the bosonic self-coupling, $\\lambda$, and the Yukawa\ncoupling between fermion and soliton, $g$, have specific relation,\n$g=\\sqrt{\\lambda/2}$. As the set of coupled equations of motion of the system\nis not analytically solvable, we use a numerical method to solve it\nself-consistently. We obtain the bound energy spectrum, bound states of the\nsystem and the corresponding shape of the soliton using a relaxation method,\nexcept for the zero mode fermionic state and threshold energies which are\nanalytically solvable. With the aid of these results we are able to show how\nthe soliton is affected in general and supersymmetric cases. The results we\nobtain are consistent with the ones in the literature, considering the soliton\nas background.\n", "  We explore ground-state entanglement properties of helium atom confined at\nthe center of an impenetrable spherical cavity of varying radius by using\nexplicitly correlated Hylleraas-type basis set. Results for the dependencies of\nthe von Neumann and linear entanglement entropic measures on the cavity radius\nare discussed in details. Some highly accurate numerical results for the von\nNeumann and linear entropy are reported for the first time. It is found that\nthe transition to the strong confinement regime is manifested by the entropies\nas an appearance of the inflection points on their variations.\n", "  The first study of $\\phi$-meson production in p-Pb collisions at forward and\nbackward rapidity, at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}} = 5.02$~TeV, has been performed with the ALICE apparatus at the LHC. The\n$\\phi$-mesons have been identified in the dimuon decay channel in the\ntransverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) range $1 < p_{\\rm T} < 7$ GeV/$c$, both in\nthe p-going ($2.03 < y < 3.53$) and the Pb-going ($-4.46 < y < -2.96$)\ndirections, where $y$ stands for the rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon\ncentre-of-mass, the integrated luminosity amounting to $5.01 \\pm\n0.19$~nb$^{-1}$ and $5.81 \\pm 0.20$~nb$^{-1}$, respectively, for the two data\nsamples. Differential cross sections as a function of transverse momentum and\nrapidity are presented. The forward-backward ratio for $\\phi$-meson production\nis measured for $2.96<|y|<3.53$, resulting in a ratio $\\sim 0.5$ with no\nsignificant $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence within the uncertainties. The $p_{\\rm T}$\ndependence of the $\\phi$ nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ exhibits an\nenhancement up to a factor 1.6 at $p_{\\rm T}$ = 3-4 GeV/$c$ in the Pb-going\ndirection. The $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence of the $\\phi$-meson cross section in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV, which is used to determine a reference for\nthe p-Pb results, is also presented here for $1 < p_{\\rm T} < 5$ GeV/$c$ and\n$2.5 <y < 4$ for a $78 \\pm 3$~nb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity sample.\n", "  A version of the Schwarzschild metric to be valid in microphysics is\nproposed. The source fluid is anisotropic with $p_{r} = -\\rho$ and fluctuating\ntangential pressures. At large distances with respect to the Compton wavelength\nassociated to the source particle, they do not depend on the mass $m$ of the\nsource and everywhere depend on $\\hbar$ and the velocity of light $c$ but not\non the Newton constant $G$. The particle may be a black hole for $m \\geq m_{P}$\nonly and when $m = m_{P}$ it becomes an extremal black hole. The Komar energy\n$W$ of the gravitational fluid is $mc^{2}$ for $\\hbar = 0$ and at large\ndistances and vanishes at $r_{0} = 2\\hbar/emc$. The WEC is violated when $r <\nr_{0}/2$ due to the negative tangential pressures. The horizon entropy for the\nextremal black hole is finite though $W$ and the temperature $T$ are vanishing\nthere.\n", "  Coherently driven atomic gases inside optical cavities hold great promise for\ngenerating rich dynamics and exotic states of matter. It was shown recently\nthat an exotic topological superradiant state exists in a two-component\ndegenerate Fermi gas coupled to a cavity, where local order parameters coexist\nwith global topological invariants. In this work, we characterize in detail\nvarious properties of this exotic state, focusing on the feedback interactions\nbetween the atoms and the cavity field. In particular, we demonstrate that\ncavity-induced interband coupling plays a crucial role in inducing the\ntopological phase transition between the conventional and topological\nsuperradiant states. We analyze the interesting signatures in the cavity field\nleft by the closing and reopening of the atomic bulk gap across the topological\nphase boundary and discuss the robustness of the topological superradiant state\nby investigating the steady-state phase diagram under various conditions.\nFurthermore, we consider the interaction effect and discuss the interplay\nbetween the pairing order in atomic ensembles and the superradiance of the\ncavity mode. Our work provides many valuable insights into the unique\ncavity--atom hybrid system under study and is helpful for future experimental\nexploration of the topological superradiant state.\n", "  We propose a quantitative test of the quantum nonlocality in the\nelectromagnetic interaction that generates the Aharonov-Bohm effect. For this\npurpose, we derive an interaction Lagrangian based on the local action of\ngauge-invariant quantities only, and compare it with the standard\npotential-based (\"nonlocal\") Lagrangian. It is shown that the two models\nprovide identical results for any phenomena involving classical equations of\nmotion or topological quantum phases. Interestingly, we find an example\nviolating this equivalence, that is, the interference of single charges\ncoproduced from two independent sources. Whereas a well-defined phase shift of\nthe interference is predicted in the \"local\" model, the standard nonlocal\nLagrangian does not provide a gauge-invariant phase shift. This implies that an\nobservation of the interference in the proposed setup can rule out the\ngauge-dependent potential-based model. This result has profound implications as\nit can settle the issue of dynamical nonlocality in the quantum electromagnetic\ninteraction.\n", "  We study the semi-inclusive limit of the deep inelastic scattering and\nDrell-Yan (DY) processes in soft collinear effective theory. In this regime\nso-called threshold logarithms must be resummed to render perturbation theory\nwell behaved. Part of this resummation occurs via the Dokshitzer, Gribov,\nLipatov, Altarelli, Parisi (DGLAP) equation, which at threshold contains a\nlarge logarithm that calls into question the convergence of the anomalous\ndimension. We demonstrate here that the problematic logarithm is related to\nrapidity divergences, and by introducing a rapidity regulator can be tamed. We\nshow that resumming the rapidity logarithms allows us to reproduce the standard\nDGLAP running at threshold as long as a set of potentially large\nnon-perturbative logarithms are absorbed into the definition of the parton\ndistribution function (PDF). These terms could, in turn, explain the steep\nfall-off of the PDF in the endpoint. We then go on to show that the resummation\nof rapidity divergences does not change the standard threshold resummation in\nDY, nor do our results depend on the rapidity regulator we choose to use.\n", "  We explore the reach of a 100 TeV proton collider to discover KK gluons in a\nwarped extra dimension. These particles are templates for color adjoint vectors\nthat couple dominantly to the top quark. We examine their production rate at\nNLO in the six-flavor m-ACOT scheme for a variety of reference models defining\ntheir coupling to quarks, largely inspired by the RS model of a warped extra\ndimension. In agreement with previous calculations aimed at lower energy\nmachines, we find that the NLO corrections are typically negative, resulting in\na $K$-factor of around 0.7 (depending on the model) and with a residual scale\ndependence on the order of $\\pm 20\\%$, greater than the variation from the\nscale exhibited by the na\\\"{i}ve LO estimate.\n", "  A number of recent works have discussed the issue of spin polarization of a\nMajorana zero mode in condensed matter systems. Here we show that the spin\npolarization density of a Majorana zero mode, computed as an average of the\nspin operator over its wave function, vanishes everywhere. A single\nnon-degenerate Majorana zero mode, therefore, does not couple to an applied\nmagnetic field, except via hybridization with higher energy excited states (if\npresent), which may perturb its wave function. If `spin' is defined by\nconsidering only the particle components of the wave function, as has been done\nin some recent works, Majorana zero modes do have a non-zero spatial profile of\nthis quantity, measurable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.\nHowever, if such a quantity is measured in spin-resolved tunneling experiments\n(without spatial resolution), we show that it cannot be used as a unique\nsignature of Majorana zero modes in the topologically non-trivial\nsuperconducting phase. As a byproduct, we show that in spatially inhomogeneous\nsystems, accidental zero energy modes, which for all practical purposes behave\nas Majorana zero modes (including giving rise to a zero bias conductance peak\nof height 2e^2/h), can appear with increasing magnetic field even in the\nabsence of a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT). But only after gap\nclosing and the associated TQPT, the modes are localized near the system edges,\nresulting in the maximum topological protection. In the light of these\nconsiderations, demonstrating the nonlocal character of the\ntopologically-protected Majorana pair and its emergence {\\em after} the systems\nundergo a TQPT, become critical tasks for the ongoing experimental search for\nMajorana bound states in condensed matter systems.\n", "  Studying the role of activity parameters and the nature of time-symmetric\npath-variables constitutes an important part of nonequilibrium physics, so we\nargue. The relevant variables are residence times and the undirected traffic\nbetween different states. Parameters are the reactivities, escape rates and\naccessibilities and how those possibly depend on the imposed driving. All those\ncount in the frenetic contribution to statistical forces, response and\nfluctuations, operational even in the stationary distribution when far enough\nfrom equilibrium. As these time-symmetric aspects can vary independently from\nthe entropy production we call the resulting effects non-dissipative, ranking\namong features of nonequilibrium that have traditionally not been much included\nin statistical mechanics until recently. Those effects can be linked to\nlocalization such as in negative differential conductivity, in jamming or\nglassy behavior or in the slowing down of thermalization. Activities may decide\nthe direction of physical currents away from equilibrium, and the nature of the\nstationary distribution, including its population inversion, is not as in\nequilibrium decided by energy-entropy content. The ubiquity of non-dissipative\neffects and of that frenetic contribution in theoretical considerations invites\na more operational understanding and statistical forces outside equilibrium\nappear to provide such a frenometry.\n", "  Yoichiro Nambu put a great foot print in nuclear physics in the era of its\nfundamental developments including his pioneering insight into essential\ningredients of repulsive core of nuclear force and its relation to the\nsaturation of nuclear matter. The present review article focuses onto recent\ndevelopments of the interaction models between colliding nuclei in terms of\nBrueckner's G-matrix theory staring from realistic nuclear forces and the\nsaturation property of symmetric nuclear matter as well as neutron-star matter.\nA recently proposed unique scenario of extracting the saturation property of\nnuclear matter and stiffness of neutron stars through the analysis of\nnucleus-nucleus elastic scattering in laboratories is presented in some detail.\n", "  We extend Feynman's analysis of an infinite ladder circuit to fractal\ncircuits, providing examples in which fractal circuits constructed with purely\nimaginary impedances can have characteristic impedances with positive real\npart. Using (weak) self-similarity of our fractal structures, we provide\nalgorithms for studying the equilibrium distribution of energy on these\ncircuits. This extends the analysis of self-similar resistance networks\nintroduced by Fukushima, Kigami, Kusuoka, and more recently studied by\nStrichartz et al.\n", "  A particular framework for quantum gravity is the doubly special relativity\n(DSR) formalism that introduces a new observer independent scale (the Planck\nscale). We resort to the methods of statistical mechanics in this framework to\ndetermine how the deformed dispersion relation affects the thermodynamics of a\nphoton gas. The ensuing modifications to the density of states, partition\nfunction, pressure, internal energy, entropy, free energy and specific heat are\ncalculated. These results are compared with the outcome obtained in the Lorentz\nviolating model of Camacho and Marcias (Gen. Relativ. Gravit. 39: 1175-1183,\n2007). The two types of models predict different results due to different\nspacetime structure near the Planck scale. The resulting modifications can be\ninterpreted as a consequence of the deformed Lorentz symmetry present in the\nparticular model we have considered. In the low energy limit, our calculation\ncoincides with usual results of photon thermodynamics in special relativity\n(SR) theory, in contrast to the study presented in (Phys. Rev. D81, 085039\n(2010)).\n", "  Local inertial frame invariance is taken as the fundamental principle of\nphysical geometry, where a local inertial frame is represented by a verbein.\nInvariance of the vierbein with respect to local Lorentz transformations then\nexpresses local inertial frame invariance. The dynamics of physical geometry\ndevelops as a gauge theory of the verbein that is closely analogous to the\nYang-Mills field provided the verbein connection and curvature correspond to\nthe geometric potential and field respectively. The resulting theory is shown\nto be equivalent to Einstein's tensor form of relativistic gravitation.\n", "  Constitutions help define domestic political orders, but are known to be\ninfluenced by two international mechanisms: one that reflects global temporal\ntrends in legal development, and another that reflects international network\ndynamics such as shared colonial history. We introduce the provision space; the\ngrowing set of all legal provisions existing in the world's constitutions over\ntime. Through this we uncover a third mechanism influencing constitutional\nchange: hierarchical dependencies between legal provisions, under which the\nadoption of essential, fundamental provisions precedes more advanced\nprovisions. This third mechanism appears to play an especially important role\nin the emergence of new political rights, and may therefore provide a useful\nroadmap for advocates of those rights. We further characterise each legal\nprovision in terms of the strength of these mechanisms.\n", "  The notion of Bregman divergence and sufficiency will be defined on general\nconvex state spaces. It is demonstrated that only spectral sets can have a\nBregman divergence that satisfies a sufficiency condition. Positive elements\nwith trace 1 in a Jordan algebra are examples of spectral sets, and the most\nimportant example is the set of density matrices with complex entries. It is\nconjectured that information theoretic considerations lead directly to the\nnotion of Jordan algebra under some regularity conditions.\n", "  Many extensions of Einstein's theory of gravity have been studied and\nproposed with various motivations like the quest for a quantum theory of\ngravity to extensions of anomalies in observations at the solar system,\ngalactic and cosmological scales. These extensions include adding higher powers\nof Ricci curvature $R$, coupling the Ricci curvature with scalar fields and\ngeneralized functions of $R$. In addition when viewed from the perspective of\nSupergravity (SUGRA) many of these theories may originate from the same SUGRA\ntheory interpreted in different frames. SUGRA therefore serves as a good\nframework for organizing and generalizing theories of gravity beyond General\nRelativity. All these theories when applied to inflation (a rapid expansion of\nearly Universe in which primordial gravitational waves might be generated and\nmight still be detectable by the imprint they left or by the ripples that\npersist today) can have distinct signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background\nradiation temperature and polarization anisotropies. In this review we give a\ndetailed discussion on the standard model of cosmology ($\\Lambda$CDM),\ninflation and cosmological perturbation theory. We survey the theories of\ngravity beyond Einstein's General Relativity, specially which arise from SUGRA,\nand study the consequences of these theories in the context of inflation and\nput bounds on the theories and the parameters therein from the observational\nexperiments like Planck, Keck/BICEP. The possibility of testing these theories\nin the near future in CMB observations and new data coming from colliders like\nthe LHC, provides an unique opportunity for constructing verifiable models of\nparticle physics and General Relativity.\n", "  Coupling a microscopic mechanical resonator to a nano-scale quantum system\nenables control of the mechanical resonator via the quantum system, and vice\nversa. The coupling is usually achieved through functionalization of the\nmechanical resonator but this results in additional mass and dissipation\nchannels. An alternative is an intrinsic coupling based on strain. We employ\nhere a monolithic semiconductor system. The nano-scale quantum system is a\nquantum dot; the mechanical resonator a microscopic trumpet which\nsimultaneously optimizes the mechanical and photonic properties. The quantum\ndot transition is driven resonantly. Via the resonance fluorescence, we observe\nmechanical Brownian motion even at 4K, and demonstrate a coupling to mechanical\nmodes of different types. We identify a mechanical mode with a cooperativity\nlarger than one. We show analytically that the Heisenberg limit on displacement\nmeasurement can be reached with an embedded two-level system in the case of a\ntransform-limited optical emitter with perfect photon detection. We argue that\noperation close to the Heisenberg limit is achievable with state-of-the-art\nquantum dot devices.\n", "  The Fermi surface of elemental bismuth consists of three small rotationally\nequivalent electron pockets, offering a valley degree of freedom to charge\ncarriers. A relatively small magnetic field can confine electrons to their\nlowest Landau level. This is the quantum limit attained in other dilute metals\nupon application of sufficiently strong magnetic field. Here, we report on the\nobservation of another threshold magnetic field never encountered before in any\nother solid. Above this field, $B_{\\rm{empty}}$, one or two valleys become\ntotally empty. Drying up a Fermi sea by magnetic field in the Brillouin zone\nleads to a manyfold enhancement in electric conductance. We trace the origin of\nthe large drop in magnetoresistance across $B_{\\rm{empty}}$ to transfer of\ncarriers between valleys with highly anisotropic mobilities. The\nnon-interacting picture of electrons with field-dependent mobility explains\nmost results. Coulomb interaction may play a role in shaping the fine details.\n", "  NaOsO3 hosts a rare manifestation of a metal-insulator transition driven by\nmagnetic correlations, placing the magnetic exchange interactions in a central\nrole. We use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to directly probe these\nmagnetic exchange interactions. A dispersive and strongly gapped (58 meV)\nexcitation is observed indicating appreciable spin-orbit coupling in this 5d3\nsystem. The excitation is well described within a minimal model Hamiltonian\nwith strong anisotropy and Heisenberg exchange (J1=J2=13.9 meV). The observed\nbehavior places NaOsO3 on the boundary between localized and itinerant\nmagnetism.\n", "  Macro-realism is the position that certain \"macroscopic\" observables must\nalways possess definite values: e.g. the table is in some definite position,\neven if we don't know what that is precisely. The traditional understanding is\nthat by assuming macro-realism one can derive the Leggett-Garg inequalities,\nwhich constrain the possible statistics from certain experiments. Since quantum\nexperiments can violate the Leggett-Garg inequalities, this is taken to rule\nout the possibility of macro-realism in a quantum universe. However, recent\nanalyses have exposed loopholes in the Leggett-Garg argument, which allow many\ntypes of macro-realism to be compatible with quantum theory and hence violation\nof the Leggett-Garg inequalities. This paper takes a different approach to\nruling out macro-realism and the result is a no-go theorem for macro-realism in\nquantum theory that is stronger than the Leggett-Garg argument. This approach\nuses the framework of ontological models: an elegant way to reason about\nfoundational issues in quantum theory which has successfully produced many\nother recent results, such as the PBR theorem.\n", "  In this work we consider the ground space connectivity problem for commuting\nlocal Hamiltonians. The ground space connectivity problem asks whether it is\npossible to go from one (efficiently preparable) state to another by applying a\npolynomial length sequence of 2-qubit unitaries while remaining at all times in\na state with low energy for a given Hamiltonian $H$. It was shown in [Gharibian\nand Sikora, ICALP'15] that this problem is QCMA-complete for general local\nHamiltonians, where QCMA is defined as QMA with a classical witness and BQP\nverifier. Here we show that the commuting version of the problem is also\nQCMA-complete. This provides one of the first examples where commuting local\nHamiltonians exhibit complexity theoretic hardness equivalent to general local\nHamiltonians.\n", "  The maximum size of a cosmic structure is given by the maximum turnaround\nradius -- the scale where the attraction due to its mass is balanced by the\nrepulsion due to dark energy. We derive generic formulae for the estimation of\nthe maximum turnaround radius in any theory of gravity obeying the Einstein\nequivalence principle, in two situations: on a spherically symmetric spacetime\nand on a perturbed Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. We show that the two\nformulae agree. As an application of our formula, we calculate the maximum\nturnaround radius in the case of the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity. We find\nthat for this theory, such maximum sizes always lie above the \\LCDM value, by a\nfactor $1 + \\frac{1}{3\\omega}$, where $\\omega\\gg 1$ is the Brans-Dicke\nparameter, implying consistency of the theory with current data.\n", "  We apply conformal field theory analysis to the $k$-channel SU($N$) Kondo\nsystem, and find a peculiar behavior in the cases $N > k > 1$, which we call\nFermi/non-Fermi mixing: The low temperature scaling is described as the Fermi\nliquid, while the zero temperature IR fixed point exhibits the non-Fermi liquid\nsignature. We also show that the Wilson ratio is no longer universal for the\ncases $N > k > 1$. The deviation from the universal value of the Wilson ratio\ncould be used as an experimental signal of the Fermi/non-Fermi mixing.\n", "  On the basis of the Poincare-Weyl gauge theory of gravitation, a new\nconformal Weyl-Dirac theory of gravitation is proposed, which is a\ngravitational theory in Cartan-Weyl spacetime with the Dirac scalar field\nrepresenting the dark matter model. A static approximate axially symmetric\nsolution of the field equations in vacuum is obtained. On the base of this\nsolution in the Newtonian approximation one considers the problem of rotation\nvelocities in spiral components of galaxies.\n", "  We have performed a combined first-principles and micromagnetic study on the\nstrain effects in Nd-Fe-B magnets. First-principles calculations on Nd2Fe14B\nreveal that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (K) is insensitive to the\ndeformation along c axis and the ab in-plane shrinkage is responsible for the K\nreduction. The predicted K is more sensitive to the lattice deformation than\nwhat the previous phenomenological model suggests. The biaxial and triaxial\nstress states have a greater impact on K. Negative K occurs in a much wider\nstrain range in the ab biaxial stress state. Micromagnetic simulations of\nNd-Fe-B magnets using first-principles results show that a 3-4% local strain in\na 2-nm-wide region near the interface around the grain boundaries and triple\njunctions leads to a negative local K and thus decreases the coercivity by\n~60%. The local ab biaxial stress state is more likely to induce a large loss\nof coercivity. In addition to the local stress states and strain levels\nthemselves, the shape of the interfaces and the intergranular phases also makes\na difference in determining the coercivity. Smoothing the edge and reducing the\nsharp angle of the triple regions in Nd-Fe-B magnets would be favorable for a\ncoercivity enhancement.\n", "  Empirical models of galaxy formation require assumptions about the\ncorrelations between galaxy and halo properties. These may be calibrated\nagainst observations or inferred from physical models such as hydrodynamical\nsimulations. In this Letter, we use the EAGLE simulation to investigate the\ncorrelation of galaxy size with halo properties. We motivate this analysis by\nnoting that the common assumption of angular momentum partition between baryons\nand dark matter in rotationally supported galaxies overpredicts both the spread\nin the stellar mass-size relation and the anticorrelation of size and velocity\nresiduals, indicating a problem with the galaxy-halo connection it implies. We\nfind the EAGLE galaxy population to perform significantly better on both\nstatistics, and trace this success to the weakness of the correlations of\ngalaxy size with halo mass, concentration and spin at fixed stellar mass. Using\nthese correlations in empirical models will enable fine-grained aspects of\ngalaxy scalings to be matched.\n", "  A wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources are expected to\ncontribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Following the\nobservations of GW150914 and GW151226, the rate and mass of coalescing binary\nblack holes appear to be greater than many previous expectations. As a result,\nthe stochastic background from unresolved compact binary coalescences is\nexpected to be particularly loud. We perform a search for the isotropic\nstochastic gravitational-wave background using data from Advanced LIGO's first\nobserving run. The data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave\nsignal. We constrain the dimensionless energy density of gravitational waves to\nbe $\\Omega_0<1.7\\times 10^{-7}$ with 95% confidence, assuming a flat energy\ndensity spectrum in the most sensitive part of the LIGO band (20-86 Hz). This\nis a factor of ~33 times more sensitive than previous measurements. We also\nconstrain arbitrary power-law spectra. Finally, we investigate the implications\nof this search for the background of binary black holes using an astrophysical\nmodel for the background.\n", "  We study properties of some standard network models when the population is\nsplit into two types and the connection pattern between the types is varied.\nThe studied models are generalizations of the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graph, the\nconfiguration model and a preferential attachment graph. For the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graph and the configuration model, the focus is on the\ncomponent structure. We derive expressions for the critical parameter,\nindicating when there is a giant component in the graph, and study the size of\nthe largest component by aid of simulations. When the expected degrees in the\ngraph are fixed and the connections are shifted so that more edges connect\nvertices of different types, we find that the critical parameter decreases. The\nsize of the largest component in the supercritical regime can be both\nincreasing and decreasing as the connections change, depending on the\ncombination of types. For the preferential attachment model, we analyze the\ndegree distributions of the two types and derive explicit expressions for the\ndegree exponents. The exponents are confirmed by simulations that also\nillustrate other properties of the degree structure.\n", "  We report the discovery of a stellar over-density 8$^{\\circ}$ north of the\ncenter of the Small Magellanic Cloud (Small Magellanic Cloud Northern\nOver-Density; SMCNOD) using data from the first two years of the Dark Energy\nSurvey (DES) and the first year of the MAGellanic SatelLITEs Survey (MagLiteS).\nThe SMCNOD is indistinguishable in age, metallicity and distance from the\nnearby SMC stars, being primarly composed of intermediate-age stars (6 Gyr,\nZ=0.001), with a small fraction of young stars (1 Gyr, Z=0.01). The SMCNOD has\nan elongated shape with an ellipticity of 0.6 and a size of $\\sim$ 6x2 deg. It\nhas an absolute magnitude of $M_V \\cong$ -7.7, $r_h = 2.1$ kpc, and\n$\\mu_V(r<r_h)$ = 31.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We estimate a stellar mass of $\\sim\n10^5$ $M_{\\odot}$, following a Kroupa mass function. The SMCNOD was probably\nremoved from the SMC disk by tidal stripping, since it is located near the head\nof the Magellanic Stream, and the literature indicates likely recent LMC-SMC\nencounters. This scenario is supported by the lack of significant HI gas. Other\npotential scenarios for the SMCNOD origin are a transient over-density within\nthe SMC tidal radius or a primordial SMC satellite in advanced stage of\ndisruption.\n", "  Based on an exposition of the underlying physics and applied mathematics in\narXiv:1603.00899, this paper in five separate parts presents a description of\nthe properties of the amplitude functions of the hydrogen atom according to\nwave mechanics in the coordinate representation in all four systems of\ncoordinates in which Schroedinger's equations are separable, explicitly I\nspherical polar coordinates, II paraboloidal coordinates, III ellipsoidal\ncoordinates and IV spheroconical coordinates; part V discusses the implications\nof these multiple systems in which these atomic orbitals can be directly\ncalculated. Most published plots of orbitals are inaccurate. In particular,\nparts I - IV contain many accurate plots of the surfaces of amplitude functions\nin the various systems with a common criterion for the amplitude at which the\nsurface is constructed. Although the plots are generated from amplitude\nfunctions in the specified systems of coordinates, the plots are translated to\ncartesian coordinates that the eye can recognise. The surfaces of the amplitude\nfunctions in ellipsoidal and spheroconical functions are previously unreported,\nwith the accurate surfaces in spherical polar and paraboloidal coordinates for\na direct comparison.\n", "  There is a widespread belief among inflationary cosmologists that a local\nobserver cannot sense super-horizon gravitons. The argument goes that a local\nobserver would subsume super-horizon gravitons into a redefinition of his\ncoordinate system. We show that adopting this view for pure gravity on de\nSitter background leads to time variation in the Hubble parameter measured by a\nlocal observer. It also leads to a violation of the gravitational field\nequation $R = 4 \\Lambda$ because that equation is obeyed by the full metric,\nrather than the one which has been cleansed of super-horizon modes.\n", "  In this work, we perform linear perturbation on general relativistic\nisothermal accretion onto a non-rotating astrophysical black hole to study the\nsalient features of the corresponding emergent acoustic metric. For spherically\nsymmetric accretion as well as for the axially symmetric matter flow for three\ndifferent geometric configuration of matter, we perturb the velocity potential,\nthe mass accretion rate, and the integral solution of the time independent part\nof the general relativistic Euler equation to obtain such acoustic geometry. We\nprovide the procedure to locate the acoustic horizon and identify such horizon\nwith the transonic surfaces of the accreting matter through the construction of\nthe corresponding causal structures. We then discuss how one can compute the\nvalue of the acoustic surface gravity in terms of the accretion variable\ncorresponding to the background flow solutions - i.e., stationary integral\ntransonic accretion solutions for different matter geometries. We show that the\nsalient features of the acoustic geometry is independent of the physical\nvariable we perturb, but sensitively depends on the geometric configuration of\nthe black hole accretion disc.\n", "  In the context of OPE and using the large-$\\beta_0$ approximation, we propose\na method to define Wilson coefficients free from uncertainties due to IR\nrenormalons. We first introduce a general observable $X(Q^2)$ with an explicit\nIR cutoff, and then we extract a genuine UV contribution $X_\\mathrm{UV}$ as a\ncutoff-independent part. $X_\\mathrm{UV}$ includes power corrections $\\sim\n(\\Lambda_\\mathrm{QCD}^2/Q^2)^n$ which are independent of renormalons. Using the\nintegration-by-regions method, we observe that $X_\\mathrm{UV}$ coincides with\nthe leading Wilson coefficient in OPE and also clarify that the power\ncorrections originate from UV region. We examine scheme dependence of\n$X_\\mathrm{UV}$ and single out a specific scheme favorable in terms of\nanalytical properties. Our method would be optimal with respect to\nsystematicity, analyticity and stability. We test our formulation with the\nexamples of the Adler function, QCD force between $Q \\bar{Q}$, and $R$-ratio in\n$e^{+} e^{-}$ collision.\n", "  Logarithmic score and information divergence appear in information theory,\nstatistics, statistical mechanics, and portfolio theory. We demonstrate that\nall these topics involve some kind of optimization that leads directly to\nregret functions and such regret functions are often given by a Bregman\ndivergence. If the regret function also fulfills a sufficiency condition it\nmust be proportional to information divergence. We will demonstrate that\nsufficiency is equivalent to the apparently weaker notion of locality and it is\nalso equivalent to the apparently stronger notion of monotonicity. These\nsufficiency conditions have quite different relevance in the different areas of\napplication, and often they are not fulfilled. Therefore sufficiency conditions\ncan be used to explain when results from one area can be transferred directly\nto another and when one will experience differences.\n", "  We discuss the systematic expansion of the solution of the Fokker-Planck\nequation with the help of the eigenfunctions of the time-dependent\nFokker-Planck operator. The expansion parameter is the time derivative of the\nexternal parameter which controls the form of an external potential. Our\nexpansion corresponds to the perturbative calculation of the adiabatic motion\nin quantum mechanics. With this method, we derive a new formula to calculate\nthe irreversible work order by order, which is expressed as the expectation\nvalue with a pseudo density matrix. Applying this method to the case of the\nharmonic potential, we show that the first order term of the expansion gives\nthe exact result. Because we do not need to solve the coupled differential\nequations of moments, our method simplifies the calculations of various\nfunctions such as the fluctuation of the irreversible work per unit time. We\nfurther investigate the exact optimized protocol to minimize the irreversible\nwork by calculating its variation with respect to the control parameter itself.\n", "  We report on an ion-optical system that serves as a microscope for ultracold\nground state and Rydberg atoms. The system is designed to achieve a\nmagnification of up to 1000 and a spatial resolution in the 100 nm range,\nthereby surpassing many standard imaging techniques for cold atoms. The\nmicroscope consists of four electrostatic lenses and a microchannel plate in\nconjunction with a delay line detector in order to achieve single particle\nsensitivity with high temporal and spatial resolution. We describe the design\nprocess of the microscope including ion-optical simulations of the imaging\nsystem and characterize aberrations and the resolution limit. Furthermore, we\npresent the experimental realization of the microscope in a cold atom setup and\ninvestigate its performance by patterned ionization with a structure size down\nto 2.7 {\\mu}m. The microscope meets the requirements for studying various\nmany-body effects, ranging from correlations in cold quantum gases up to\nRydberg molecule formation.\n", "  Light localization and intensity enhancement in a woodpile layer-by-layer\nphotonic crystal, whose interlayer distance along the propagation direction is\ngradually varied, has been theoretically predicted and experimentally\ndemonstrated. The phenomenon is shown to be related to the progressive slowing\ndown and stopping of the incoming wave, as a result of the gradual variation of\nthe local dispersion. The light localization is chromatically resolved, since\nevery frequency component is stopped and reflected back at different spatial\npositions. It has been further discussed that the peculiar relation between the\nstopping distance and the wave vector distribution can substantially increase\nthe enhancement factor to more than two orders of magnitude. Compared to\npreviously reported one- and two-dimensional photonic crystal configurations,\nthe proposed scheme has the advantage of reducing the propagation losses by\nproviding a three-dimensional photonic bandgap confinement in all directions.\nThe slowing down and localization of waves inside photonic media can be\nexploited in many applications that requires enhanced interaction of light and\nmatter.\n", "  Albeit radial migration must be a ubiquitous process in disc galaxies, its\nsignificance in the evolution of stellar discs is not always reflected through\nglobal trends. However, there are other key observables, such as the\nmetallicity distribution function (MDF), that may shed some light in this\nmatter. We argue that the shape of the MDF not only tells us whether the\nstellar disc experienced radial migration, but it also contains important clues\non the structure that triggered it. Specifically, the MDF contains information\nabout the dynamics and morphology of the spiral pattern. To constrain the\nspiral parameters, we have included a detailed chemical tagging in our\nsimulations; this allows us to produce a restriction of the structural\nparameters of the spiral arms in the Milky Way as well as a method to constrain\nchemical evolution models towards the center of the Galactic disc, where no\nchemical model provides information. We also found that it is unlikely that the\nSun was formed near its current galactocentric position, therefore it might be\ninaccurate to consider the Sun as representative of the chemical abundances in\nthe solar neighborhood. We also show that a stellar disc of the Milky Way,\nafter evolving dynamically and chemically for 5 Gyr, preserves 80% of its\noriginal global metallicity gradient despite having suffered important heating\nand radial migration; this means that the presence of a metallicity gradient in\na given galaxy, does not guarantee that radial mixing has not played a role in\nits evolution.\n", "  Recent remarkable progress in wave-front shaping has enabled control of light\npropagation inside linear media to focus and image through scattering objects.\nIn particular, light propagation in multimode fibers comprises complex\nintermodal interactions and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. Control of physical\nphenomena in multimode fibers and its applications is in its infancy, opening\nopportunities to take advantage of complex mode interactions. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a wave-front shaping approach for controlling nonlinear phenomena\nin multimode fibers. Using a spatial light modulator at the fiber input and a\ngenetic algorithm optimization, we control a highly nonlinear stimulated Raman\nscattering cascade and its interplay with four wave mixing via a flexible\nimplicit control on the superposition of modes that are coupled into the fiber.\nWe show for the first time versatile spectrum manipulations including shifts,\nsuppression, and enhancement of Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks. These\ndemonstrations illustrate the power of wave-front shaping to control and\noptimize nonlinear wave propagation.\n", "  The Discrete NonLinear Schr\\\"odinger (DNLS) equation displays a parameter\nregion characterized by the presence of localized excitations (breathers).\nWhile their formation is well understood and it is expected that the asymptotic\nconfiguration comprises a single breather on top of a background, it is not\nclear why the dynamics of a multi-breather configuration is essentially frozen.\nIn order to investigate this question, we introduce simple stochastic models,\ncharacterized by suitable conservation laws. We focus on the role of the\ncoupling strength between localized excitations and background. In the DNLS\nmodel, higher breathers interact more weakly, as a result of their faster\nrotation. In our stochastic models, the strength of the coupling is controlled\ndirectly by an amplitude-dependent parameter. In the case of a power-law\ndecrease, the associated coarsening process undergoes a slowing down if the\ndecay rate is larger than a critical value. In the case of an exponential\ndecrease, a freezing effect is observed that is reminiscent of the scenario\nobserved in the DNLS. This last regime arises spontaneously when direct energy\ndiffusion between breathers and background is blocked below a certain\nthreshold.\n", "  The planets of the Solar System divide neatly between those with atmospheres\nand those without when arranged by insolation ($I$) and escape velocity\n($v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$). The dividing line goes as $I \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^4$.\nExoplanets with reported masses and radii are shown to crowd against the\nextrapolation of the Solar System trend, making a metaphorical cosmic shoreline\nthat unites all the planets. The $I \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^4$ relation may\nimplicate thermal escape. We therefore address the general behavior of\nhydrodynamic thermal escape models ranging from Pluto to highly-irradiated\nExtrasolar Giant Planets (EGPs). Energy-limited escape is harder to test\nbecause copious XUV radiation is mostly a feature of young stars, and hence\nrequires extrapolating to historic XUV fluences ($I_{\\mathrm{xuv}}$) using\nproxies and power laws. An energy-limited shoreline should scale as\n$I_{\\mathrm{xuv}} \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^3\\sqrt{\\rho}$, which differs\ndistinctly from the apparent $I_{\\mathrm{xuv}} \\propto v_{\\mathrm{esc}}^4$\nrelation. Energy-limited escape does provide good quantitative agreement to the\nhighly irradiated EGPs. Diffusion-limited escape implies that no planet can\nlose more than 1% of its mass as H$_2$. Impact erosion, to the extent that\nimpact velocities $v_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ can be estimated for exoplanets, fits to a\n$v_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\approx 4\\,-\\,5\\, v_{\\mathrm{esc}}$ shoreline. The\nproportionality constant is consistent with what the collision of comet\nShoemaker-Levy 9 showed us we should expect of modest impacts in deep\natmospheres. With respect to the shoreline, Proxima Centauri b is on the\nmetaphorical beach. Known hazards include its rapid energetic accretion, high\nimpact velocities, its early life on the wrong side of the runaway greenhouse,\nand Proxima Centauri's XUV radiation. In its favor is a vast phase space of\nunknown unknowns.\n", "  We use dimensional regularization in pure quantum gravity on de Sitter\nbackground to evaluate the one loop expectation value of an invariant operator\nwhich gives the local expansion rate. We show that the renormalization of this\nnonlocal composite operator can be accomplished using the counterterms of a\nsimple local theory of gravity plus matter, at least at one loop order. This\nrenormalization completely absorbs the one loop correction, which accords with\nthe prediction that the lowest secular back-reaction should be a 2-loop effect.\n", "  A classification of SU(2)-invariant Projected Entangled Paired States (PEPS)\non the square lattice, based on a unique site tensor, has been recently\nintroduced by Mambrini et al.~\\cite{Mambrini2016}. It is not clear whether such\nSU(2)-invariant PEPS can either i) exhibit long-range magnetic order (like in\nthe N\\'eel phase) or ii) describe a genuine quantum critical point (QCP) or\nquantum critical phase (QCPh) separating two ordered phases. Here, we identify\na specific family of SU(2)-invariant PEPS of the classification which provides\nexcellent variational energies for the $J_1-J_2$ frustrated Heisenberg model,\nespecially at $J_2=0.5$, corresponding to the approximate location of the QCP\nor QCPh separating the N\\'eel phase from a dimerized phase. The PEPS are build\nfrom virtual states belonging to the $\\frac{1}{2}^{\\otimes N} \\oplus 0$\nSU(2)-representation, i.e. with $N$ \"colors\" of virtual\n\\hbox{spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$}. Using a full update infinite-PEPS approach directly\nin the thermodynamic limit, based on the Corner Transfer Matrix renormalization\nalgorithm supplemented by a Conjugate Gradient optimization scheme, we provide\nevidence of i) the absence of magnetic order and of ii) diverging correlation\nlengths (i.e. showing no sign of saturation with increasing environment\ndimension) in both the singlet and triplet channels, when the number of colors\n$N\\ge 3$. We argue that such a PEPS gives a qualitative description of the QCP\nor QCPh of the $J_1-J_2$ model.\n", "  We introduce a multi-mode squeezing coefficient to characterize entanglement\nin $N$-partite continuous-variable systems. The coefficient relates to the\nsqueezing of collective observables in the $2N$-dimensional phase space and can\nbe readily extracted from the covariance matrix. Simple extensions further\npermit to reveal entanglement within specific partitions of a multipartite\nsystem. Applications with nonlinear observables allow for the detection of\nnon-Gaussian entanglement.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize a multiqubit tunable phase gate in a circuit\nQED setup where two resonators, each coupling with a qudit, are interconnected\nto a common qudit (d=4). In this proposal, only two levels of each qudit serve\nas the logical states and the other two levels are used for the gate\nrealization. The proposal is efficient and simple because only a classical\nmicrowave pulse is needed, no matter how many qudits are involved, which\nsignificantly reduces experimental difficulty. In a nonresonant case, the\ntunable phase gate can be achieved readily, while under the resonant condition,\na {\\pi}-phase gate can be realized after a full cycle of Rabi oscillation where\nthe gate speed is rather fast due to the resonant interaction. We have shown\nthat the resulting effective dynamics allows for the creation of a\nhigh-fidelity phase gate. The influence of various decoherence processes such\nas the decay of the resonator mode and the relaxation of the qudits is\ninvestigated. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be easily generalized to\nrealize N-qubit phase gate.\n", "  A search for magnetic monopoles using five years of data recorded with the\nANTARES neutrino telescope from January 2008 to December 2012 with a total live\ntime of 1121 days is presented. The analysis is carried out in the range\n$\\beta$ $>$ $0.6$ of magnetic monopole velocities using a strategy based on\nrun-by-run Monte Carlo simulations. No signal above the background expectation\nfrom atmospheric muons and atmospheric neutrinos is observed, and upper limits\nare set on the magnetic monopole flux ranging from $5.7 \\times 10^{-16}$ to\n$1.5 \\times 10^{-18}$ cm$^{-2} \\cdot $ s$^{-1} \\cdot $ sr$^{-1}$.\n", "  In this Letter, we study the collective behaviour of a large number of\nself-propelled microswimmers immersed in a fluid. Using unprecedently\nlarge-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations, we reproduce the transition to\nbacterial turbulence. We show that, even well below the transition, swimmers\nmove in a correlated fashion that cannot be described by a mean-field approach.\nWe develop a novel kinetic theory that captures these correlations and is\nnon-perturbative in the swimmer density. To provide an experimentally\naccessible measure of correlations, we calculate the diffusivity of passive\ntracers and reveal its non-trivial density dependence. The theory is in\nquantitative agreement with the lattice Boltzmann simulations and captures the\nasymmetry between pusher and puller swimmers below the transition to\nturbulence.\n", "  In order to obtain the analytic expression of an amplitude from a generic\nCHY-integrand, a new algorithm based on the so-called cross-ratio identities\nhas been proposed recently. In this paper, we apply this new approach to a\nvariety of theories including: non-linear sigma model, special Galileon theory,\npure Yang-Mills theory, pure gravity, Born-Infeld theory, Dirac-Born-Infeld\ntheory and its extension, Yang-Mills-scalar theory, Einstein-Maxwell theory as\nwell as Einstein-Yang-Mills theory. CHY-integrands of these theories which\ncontain higher-order poles can be calculated conveniently by using the\ncross-ratio identity method, and all results above have been verified\nnumerically.\n", "  Fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon, electric charge and\nstrangeness number, are sensitive observables in heavy-ion collisions to search\nfor the QCD phase transition and critical point. In this paper, we performed a\nsystematical analysis on the various cumulants and cumulant ratios of\nevent-by-event net-strangeness distributions in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV from UrQMD model. We\nperformed a systematical study on the contributions from various strange\nbaryons and mesons to the net-strangeness fluctuations. The results demonstrate\nthat the cumulants and cumulant ratios of net-strangeness distributions\nextracted from different strange particles show very different centrality and\nenergy dependence behavior. By comparing with the net-kaon fluctuations, we\nfound that the strange baryons play an important role in the fluctuations of\nnet-strangeness. This study can provide useful baselines to study the QCD phase\ntransition and search for the QCD critical point by using the fluctuations of\nnet-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions experiment. It can help us to\nunderstand non-critical physics contributions to the fluctuations of\nnet-strangeness.\n", "  Motivated by the recent proposal of the splashback radius as a physical\nboundary of dark matter halos, we present a parallel computer code for Subhalo\nand PARticle Trajectory Analysis (SPARTA). The code analyzes the orbits of all\nsimulation particles in all host halos, billions of orbits in the case of\ntypical cosmological N-body simulations. Within this general framework, we\ndevelop an algorithm that accurately extracts the location of the first\napocenter of particles after infall into a halo, or splashback. We define the\nsplashback radius of a halo as the smoothed average of the apocenter radii of\nindividual particles. This definition allows us to reliably measure the\nsplashback radii of 95% of host halos above a resolution limit of 1000\nparticles. We show that, on average, the splashback radius and mass are\nconverged to better than 5% accuracy with respect to mass resolution, snapshot\nspacing, and all free parameters of the method.\n", "  The splashback radius $R_{\\rm sp}$, the apocentric radius of particles on\ntheir first orbit after falling into a dark matter halo, has recently been\nsuggested as a physically motivated halo boundary that separates accreting from\norbiting material. Using the SPARTA code presented in Paper I, we analyze the\norbits of billions of particles in cosmological simulations of structure\nformation and measure $R_{\\rm sp}$ for a large sample of halos that span a mass\nrange from dwarf galaxy to massive cluster halos, reach redshift 8, and include\nWMAP, Planck, and self-similar cosmologies. We analyze the dependence of\n$R_{\\rm sp}/R_{\\rm 200m}$ and $M_{\\rm sp}/M_{\\rm 200m}$ on the mass accretion\nrate $\\Gamma$, halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. The scatter in these\nrelations varies between 0.02 and 0.1 dex. While we confirm the known trend\nthat $R_{\\rm sp}/R_{\\rm 200m}$ decreases with $\\Gamma$, the relationships turn\nout to be more complex than previously thought, demonstrating that $R_{\\rm sp}$\nis an independent definition of the halo boundary that cannot trivially be\nreconstructed from spherical overdensity definitions. We present fitting\nfunctions for $R_{\\rm sp}/R_{\\rm 200m}$ and $M_{\\rm sp}/M_{\\rm 200m}$ as a\nfunction of accretion rate, peak height, and redshift, achieving an accuracy of\n5% or better everywhere in the parameter space explored. We discuss the\nphysical meaning of the distribution of particle apocenters and show that the\npreviously proposed definition of $R_{\\rm sp}$ as the radius of the steepest\nlogarithmic density slope encloses roughly three-quarters of the apocenters.\nFinally, we conclude that no analytical model presented thus far can fully\nexplain our results.\n", "  Recent work has shown that use of quantum feedback can significantly enhance\nboth the speed and success rate of measurement-based remote entanglement\ngeneration, but it is generally unknown what feedback protocols are optimal for\nthese tasks. Here we consider two common measurements that are capable of\nprojecting into pairwise entangled states, namely half- and full-parity\nmeasurements of two qubits, and determine in each case a globally optimal\nprotocol for generation of entanglement. For the half-parity measurement, we\nrederive a previously described protocol using more general methods and prove\nthat it is globally optimal for several figures of merit, including maximal\nconcurrence or fidelity, and minimal time to reach a specified concurrence or\nfidelity. For the full-parity measurement, we derive a protocol for rapid\nentanglement generation related to that of (C. Hill, J. Ralph, Phys. Rev. A 77,\n014305 (2008)), and then map the dynamics of the concurrence of the state to\nthe Bloch vector length of an effective qubit. This mapping allows us to prove\nseveral optimality results for feedback protocols with full-parity\nmeasurements. We further show that our full-parity protocol transfers\nentanglement optimally from one qubit to the other amongst all\nmeasurement-based schemes. The methods developed here will be useful for\nderiving feedback protocols and determining their optimality properties in many\nother quantum systems subject to measurement and unitary operations.\n", "  We compare failure distributions of quantum error correction circuits for\nstochastic errors and coherent errors. We utilize a fully coherent simulation\nof a fault tolerant quantum error correcting circuit for a $d=3$ Steane and\nsurface code. We find that the output distributions are markedly different for\nthe two error models, showing that no simple mapping between the two error\nmodels exists. Coherent errors create very broad and heavy-tailed failure\ndistributions. This suggests that they are susceptible to outlier events and\nthat mean statistics, such as pseudo-threshold estimates, may not provide the\nkey figure of merit. This provides further statistical insight into why\ncoherent errors can be so harmful for quantum error correction. These output\nprobability distributions may also provide a useful metric that can be utilized\nwhen optimizing quantum error correcting codes and decoding procedures for\npurely coherent errors.\n", "  The absolute number and the density profiles of different types of stars in\nthe solar neighborhood are a fundamental anchor for studies of the initial mass\nfunction, stellar evolution, and galactic structure. Using data from the Gaia\nDR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution, we reconstruct Gaia's selection function\nand we determine Gaia's volume completeness, the local number density, and the\nvertical profiles of different spectral types along the main sequence from\nearly A stars to late K stars as well as along the giant branch. We clearly\ndetect the expected flattening of the stellar density profile near the\nmid-plane for all stellar types: All vertical profiles are well represented by\nsech^2 profiles, with scale heights ranging from ~50 pc for A stars to ~150 pc\nfor G and K dwarfs and giants. We determine the luminosity function along the\nmain sequence for M_V < 7 (M >~ $0.72 M_\\odot$) and along the giant branch for\nM_J >~ -2.5. Converting this to a mass function, we find that the high-mass (M\n> $1\\,M_\\odot$) present-day mass function along the main sequence is d n / d M\n= 0.016 $(M/M_\\odot)^{-4.7}$ stars/pc^3/$M_\\odot$. Extrapolating below M =\n$0.72\\,M_\\odot$, we find a total mid-plane stellar density of 0.040+/-0.002\n$M_\\odot$/pc^3. Giants contribute 0.00039+/-0.00001 stars/pc^3 or about\n0.00046+/-0.00005 $M_\\odot$/pc^3. The star-formation rate surface density is\n\\Sigma(t) = 7+/-1 exp(-t/[7+/-1 Gyr]) $M_\\odot$/pc^2/Gyr. Overall, we find that\nGaia DR1's selection biases are manageable and allow a detailed new inventory\nof the solar neighborhood to be made that agrees with and extends previous\nstudies. This bodes well for mapping the Milky Way with the full Gaia data set.\n", "  It has recently been reported that certain thin timelike shells undergo\noscillatory motion in AdS. In this paper, we compute two-point function of a\nprobe field in the geodesic approximation in such an oscillating shell\nbackground. We confirm that the two-point function exhibits an oscillatory\nbehaviour following the motion of the shell. We show that similar oscillatory\ndynamics is possible when the perfect fluid on the shell has a polytropic\nequation of state. Moreover, we show that certain ball like configurations in\nAdS also exhibit oscillatory motion and comment on how such a solution can be\nsmoothly matched to an appropriate exterior solution. We also demonstrate that\nthe weak energy condition is satisfied for these oscillatory configurations.\n", "  It has been recently demonstrated that a singlet-triplet spin qubit in\nsemiconductor double quantum dots can be controlled by changing the height of\nthe potential barrier between the two dots (\"barrier control\"), which has led\nto a considerable reduction of charge noises as compared to the traditional\ntilt control method. In this paper we show, through a\nmolecular-orbital-theoretic calculation of double quantum dots influenced by a\ncharged impurity, that the relative charge noise for a system under the barrier\ncontrol not only is smaller than that for the tilt control, but actually\ndecreases as a function of an increasing exchange interaction. This is\nunderstood as a combined consequence of the greatly suppressed detuning noise\nwhen the two dots are symmetrically operated, as well as an enhancement of the\ninter-dot hopping energy of an electron when the barrier is lowered which in\nturn reduces the relative charge noise at large exchange interaction values. We\nhave also studied the response of the qubit to charged impurities at different\nlocations, and found that the improvement of barrier control is least for\nimpurities equidistant from the two dots due to the small detuning noise they\ncause, but is otherwise significant along other directions.\n", "  This paper investigates the problem of a relativistic Dirac half integer spin\nfree particle tunneling through a rectangular quantum-mechanical barrier. If\nthe energy difference between the barrier and the particle is positive, and the\nbarrier width is large enough, there is proof that the tunneling may be\nsuperluminal. For first spinor components of particle and antiparticle states,\nthe tunneling is always superluminal regardless the barrier width. Conversely,\nthe second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states may be either\nsubluminal or superluminal depending on the barrier width. These results derive\nfrom studying the tunneling time in terms of phase time. For the first spinor\ncomponents of particle and antiparticle states, it is always negative while for\nthe second spinor components of particle and antiparticle states, it is always\npositive, whatever the height and width of the barrier. In total, the tunneling\ntime always remains positive for particle states while it becomes negative for\nantiparticle ones. Furthermore, the phase time tends to zero, increasing the\npotential barrier both for particle and antiparticle states. This agrees with\nthe interpretation of quantum tunneling that the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple provides. This study results are innovative with respect to those\navailable in the literature. Moreover, they show that the superluminal\nbehaviour of particles occurs in those processes with high-energy confinement.\n", "  Hybrid graphene photoconductor/phototransistor has achieved giant\nphotoresponsivity, but its response speed dramatically degrades as the expense\ndue to the long lifetime of trapped interfacial carriers. In this work, by\nintercalating a large-area atomically thin MoS2 film into a hybrid graphene\nphotoconductor, we have developed a prototype tunneling photoconductor, which\nexhibits a record-fast response (rising time ~17 ns) and a high responsivity\n(~$3\\times10^4$ A/W at 635 nm and 16.8 nW illumination) across the broad\nspectral range. We demonstrate that the photo-excited carriers generated in\nsilicon are transferred into graphene through a tunneling process rather than\ncarrier drift. The atomically thin MoS2 film not only serves as tunneling layer\nbut also passivates surface states, which in combination delivers a superior\nresponse speed (~3 order of magnitude improved than a device without MoS2\nlayer), while the responsivity remains high. This intriguing tunneling\nphotoconductor integrates both fast response and high responsivity and thus has\nsignificant potential in practical applications of optoelectronic devices.\n", "  As another step towards understanding the long-term evolution of the magnetic\nfield in neutron stars, we provide the first simulations of ambipolar diffusion\nin a spherical star. Restricting ourselves to axial symmetry, we consider a\ncharged-particle fluid of protons and electrons carrying the magnetic flux\nthrough a motionless, uniform background of neutrons that exerts a collisional\ndrag force on the former. We also ignore the possible impact of beta decays,\nproton superconductivity, and neutron superfluidity. All initial magnetic field\nconfigurations considered are found to evolve on the analytically expected\ntime-scales towards \"barotropic equilibria\" satisfying the \"Grad-Shafranov\nequation\", in which the magnetic force is balanced by the degeneracy pressure\ngradient, so ambipolar diffusion is choked. These equilibria are so-called\n\"twisted torus\" configurations, which include poloidal and toroidal components,\nthe latter restricted to the toroidal volumes in which the poloidal field lines\nclose inside the star. In axial symmetry, they appear to be stable, although\nthey are likely to undergo non-axially symmetric instabilities.\n", "  The antiferromagnet (AFM) / ferromagnet (FM) interfaces are of central\nimportance in recently developed pure electric or ultrafast control of FM\nspins, where the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here we report the\ndirect observation of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) across the AFM/FM\ninterface of IrMn/CoFeB thin films. The interfacial DMI is quantitatively\nmeasured from the asymmetric spin wave dispersion in the FM layer using\nBrillouin light scattering. The DMI strength is enhanced by a factor of 7 with\nincreasing IrMn layer thickness in the range of 1- 7.5 nm. Our findings provide\ndeeper insight into the coupling at AFM/FM interface and may stimulate new\ndevice concepts utilizing chiral spin textures such as magnetic skyrmions in\nAFM/FM heterostructures.\n", "  We develop the formalism for computing gravitational corrections to vacuum\ndecay from de Sitter space as a sub-Planckian perturbative expansion.\nNon-minimal coupling to gravity can be encoded in an effective potential. The\nColeman bounce continuously deforms into the Hawking-Moss bounce, until they\ncoincide for a critical value of the Hubble constant. As an application, we\nreconsider the decay of the electroweak Higgs vacuum during inflation. Our\nvacuum decay computation reproduces and improves bounds on the maximal\ninflationary Hubble scale previously computed through statistical techniques.\n", "  The superfluid drag effect, in hydrodynamics of pulsating neutron stars, is\nconventionally described with the aid of the entrainment matrix relating the\nmass currents with the velocities of superfluid flows in the system. Equations\nfor the entrainment matrix of a superfluid mixture of neutrons and protons are\nderived with allowance for the strong dependence of the energy gaps on the\nvelocities of superfluid flows. The calculations are carried out in the frame\nof the Fermi-liquid theory. The equations obtained are highly nonlinear.\nNumerical solutions to the equations for some typical cases demonstrate that\nthe components of the entrainment matrix possess a highly nonlinear dependence\non the velocities of the two superflows simultaneously. This effect, previously\nignored, can greatly influence the dynamics of neutron stars.\n", "  We present an exhaustive census of Lyman alpha (Ly$\\alpha$) emission in the\ngeneral galaxy population at $3<z<4.6$. We use the Michigan/Magellan Fiber\nSystem (M2FS) spectrograph to study a stellar mass (M$_*$) selected sample of\n625 galaxies homogeneously distributed in the range\n$7.6<\\log{\\mbox{M$_*$/M$_{\\odot}$}}<10.6$. Our sample is selected from the\n3D-HST/CANDELS survey, which provides the complementary data to estimate\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent widths ($W_{Ly\\alpha}$) and escape fractions ($f_{esc}$)\nfor our galaxies. We find both quantities to anti-correlate with M$_*$,\nstar-formation rate (SFR), UV luminosity, and UV slope ($\\beta$). We then model\nthe $W_{Ly\\alpha}$ distribution as a function of M$_{UV}$ and $\\beta$ using a\nBayesian approach. Based on our model and matching the properties of typical\nLyman break galaxy (LBG) selections, we conclude that the $W_{Ly\\alpha}$\ndistribution in such samples is heavily dependent on the limiting M$_{UV}$ of\nthe survey. Regarding narrowband surveys, we find their $W_{Ly\\alpha}$\nselections to bias samples toward low M$_*$, while their line-flux limitations\npreferentially leave out low-SFR galaxies. We can also use our model to predict\nthe fraction of Ly$\\alpha$-emitting LBGs at $4\\leqslant z\\leqslant 7$. We show\nthat reported drops in the Ly$\\alpha$ fraction at $z\\geqslant6$, usually\nattributed to the rapidly increasing neutral gas fraction of the universe, can\nalso be explained by survey M$_{UV}$ incompleteness. This result does not\ndismiss reionization occurring at $z\\sim7$, but highlights that current data is\nnot inconsistent with this process taking place at $z>7$.\n", "  The ALICE Collaboration aims at studying the physics of strongly interacting\nmatter by building up a dedicated heavy-ion detector. The Inner Tracking System\n(ITS) is located in the heart of the ALICE Detector surrounding the interaction\npoint. Now, ALICE has a plan to upgrade the inner tracking system for rare\nprobes at low transverse momentum. The new ITS composes of seven layers of\nsilicon pixel sensor on the supporting structure. One goal of the new design is\nto reduce the material budget ($X/X_0$) per layer to 0.3$\\%$ for inner layers\nand 0.8$\\%$ for middle and outer layers. In this work, we perform the\ncalculations based on detailed geometry descriptions of different supporting\nstructures for inner and outer barrel using ALIROOT. Our results show that it\nis possible to reduce the material budget of the inner and outer barrel to the\nvalue that we have expected. The manufacturing of such prototypes are also\npossible.\n", "  Many kinds of active particles, such as bacteria or active colloids, move in\na thermostatted fluid by means of self-propulsion. Energy injected by such a\nnon-equilibrium force is eventually dissipated as heat in the thermostat. Since\nthermal fluctuations are much faster and weaker than self-propulsion forces,\nthey are often neglected, blurring the identification of dissipated heat in\ntheoretical models. For the same reason, some freedom - or arbitrariness -\nappears when defining entropy production. Recently three different recipes to\ndefine heat and entropy production have been proposed for the same model where\nthe role of self-propulsion is played by a Gaussian coloured noise. Here we\ncompare and discuss the relation between such proposals and their physical\nmeaning. One of these proposals takes into account the heat exchanged with a\nnon-equilibrium active bath: such an \"active heat\" satisfies the original\nClausius relation and can be experimentally verified.\n", "  In this paper, the first order radiative correction to the Casimir energy for\na massive scalar field in the $\\phi^4$ theory on a spherical surface with $S^2$\ntopology was calculated. In common methods for calculating the radiative\ncorrection to the Casimir energy, the counter-terms related to free theory are\nused. However, in this study, by using a systematic perturbation expansion, the\nobtained counter-terms in renormalization program were automatically\nposition-dependent. We maintained that this dependency was permitted,\nreflecting the effects of the boundary conditions imposed or background space\nin the problem. Additionally, along with the renormalization program, a\nsupplementary regularization technique that we named Box Subtraction Scheme\n(BSS) was performed. This scheme presents a useful method for the\nregularization of divergences, providing a situation that the infinities would\nbe removed spontaneously without any ambiguity. Analysis of the necessary\nlimits of the obtained results for the Casimir energy of the massive and\nmassless scalar field confirmed the appropriate and reasonable consistency of\nthe answers.\n", "  In this work, methods to determine more accurate doping profiles in\nsemiconductors is explored where trap-induced artifacts such as hysteresis and\ndoping artifacts are observed. Specifically in CIGS, it is shown that this fast\ncapacitance-voltage (C-V) approach presented here allows for accurate doping\nprofile measurement even at room temperature, which is typically not possible\ndue to the large ratio of trap concentration to doping. Using deep level\ntransient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurement, the deep trap responsible for the\nabnormal C-V measurement above 200 K is identified. Importantly, this fast C-V\ncan be used for fast evaluation on the production line to monitor the true\ndoping concentration, and even estimate the trap concentration. Additionally,\nthe influence of high conductance on the apparent doping profile at different\ntemperature is investigated.\n", "  This document describes a quantum assembly language (QASM) called OpenQASM\nthat is used to implement experiments with low depth quantum circuits. OpenQASM\nrepresents universal physical circuits over the CNOT plus SU(2) basis with\nstraight-line code that includes measurement, reset, fast feedback, and gate\nsubroutines. The simple text language can be written by hand or by higher level\ntools and may be executed on the IBM Q Experience.\n", "  Colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are powerful tools that might be used to\ninfer stellar properties in globular clusters (GCs), for example, the binary\nfraction and their mass ratio ($q$) distribution. In the past few years,\nobservations have revealed that q distributions of GC main-sequence (MS)\nbinaries are generally flat, and a distribution characterized by a strong\nincrease towards q $\\approx$ 1 is not typical in GCs. In numerical simulations\nof GC evolution with the initial binary population (IBP) described by Kroupa,\nsynthetic CMD colour distributions exhibit a peak associated with binaries that\nhave q $\\approx$ 1. While the Kroupa IBP reproduces binary properties in\nstar-forming regions, clusters and the Galactic field, the peak in the q\ndistribution towards q $\\approx$ 1 observed for GC simulations is not\nconsistent with distributions derived from observations. The objective of this\npaper is to refine and further improve the physical formulation of\npre-main-sequence eigenevolution proposed by Kroupa in order to achieve CMD\ncolour distributions of simulated GC models similar to those observed in real\nGCs, and to get a similarly good agreement with binary properties for late-type\nbinaries in the Galactic field. We present in this paper a modified Kroupa IBP,\nin which early-type stars follow observational distributions, and late-type\nstars are generated according to slightly modified pre-main-sequence\neigenevolution prescriptions. Our modifications not only lead to a\nqualitatively good agreement with respect to long-term observations of\nlate-type binaries in the Galactic field, but also resolve the above-mentioned\nproblem related to binary distributions in GC models.\n", "  The minimum of 4-terminal conductance occurring at its charge neutral point\nhas proven to be a robust empirical feature of graphene, persisting with\nchanges to temperature, applied magnetic field, substrate, and layer thickness,\nthough the theoretical mechanisms involved in transport about this point --\nvanishing density of states, conventional band gap opening, and broken symmetry\nquantum Hall mobility gaps -- vary widely depending on the regime. In this\npaper, we report on observations of a regime where the 4-terminal conductance\nminimum ceases to exist: transport in monolayer graphene connected to bilayer\ngraphene during the onset of the quantum Hall effect. As monolayer and bilayer\ngraphene have distinct zero-energy Landau levels that form about the charge\nneutral point, our observations suggest that competitions between the differing\nmany-body orderings of these states as they emerge may underlie this anomalous\nconductance.\n", "  Despite of the appearance of numerous new materials, the iron based alloys\nand steels continue to play an essential role in modern technology. The\nproperties of a steel are determined by its structural state (ferrite,\ncementite, pearlite, bainite, martensite, and their combination) that is formed\nunder thermal treatment as a result of the shear lattice reconstruction \"gamma\"\n(fcc) -> \"alpha\" (bcc) and carbon diffusion redistribution. We present a review\non a recent progress in the development of a quantitative theory of the phase\ntransformations and microstructure formation in steel that is based on an ab\ninitio parameterization of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional. The\nresults of computer modeling describe the regular change of transformation\nscenario under cooling from ferritic (nucleation and diffusion-controlled\ngrowth of the \"alpha\" phase to martensitic (the shear lattice instability\n\"gamma\" -> \"alpha\"). It has been shown that the increase in short-range\nmagnetic order with decreasing the temperature plays a key role in the change\nof transformation scenarios. Phase-field modeling in the framework of a\ndiscussed approach demonstrates the typical transformation patterns.\n", "  We describe theoretical and practical aspects of spin-echo modulated\nsmall-angle neutron scattering (SEMSANS) as well as the potential combination\nwith SANS. Based on the preliminary technical designs of SKADI (a SANS\ninstrument proposed for the European Spallation Source) and a SEMSANS add-on,\nwe assess the practicability, feasibility and scientific merit of a combined\nSANS and SEMSANS setup by calculating tentative SANS and SEMSANS results for\nsoft matter, geology and advanced material samples that have been previously\nstudied by scattering methods. We conclude that lengths from 1 nm up to 0.01 mm\ncan be observed simultaneously in a single measurement. Thus, the combination\nof SANS and SEMSANS instrument is suited for the simultaneous observation of a\nwide range of length scales, e.g. for time-resolved studies of kinetic\nprocesses in complex multiscale systems.\n", "  Crack initiation emerges due to a combination of elasticity, plasticity, and\ndisorder, and it is heavily dependent on the material's microstructural\ndetails. In this paper, we investigate brittle metals with coarse-grained,\nmicrostructural disorder that could originate in a material's manufacturing\nprocess, such as alloying. As an investigational tool, we consider crack\ninitiation from a surface, ellipsoidal notch: As the radius of curvature at the\nnotch increases, there is a dynamic transition from notch-induced crack\ninitiation to bulk-disorder crack nucleation. We perform extensive and\nrealistic simulations using a phase-field approach coupled to crystal\nplasticity. Furthermore, the microstructural disorder and notch width are\nvaried in order to study the transition. We identify this transition for\nvarious disorder strengths in terms of the damage evolution. Above the\ntransition, we identify detectable precursors to crack initiation that we\nquantify in terms of the expected stress drops during mode I fracture loading.\nWe discuss ways to observe and analyze this brittle to quasi-brittle transition\nin experiments.\n", "  Resonant soft X-ray scattering was used to determine the presence of more\nsubtle orderings not detected in standard structural analyses. By tuning to\nspecific Co absorption edges, arrangements particular to the electronic states\nof those elements are enhanced. We have discovered an ordering commensurate to\nthe lattice at the ($\\frac{1}{4}~\\frac{1}{4}~\\frac{1}{4}$) position.\nIncommensurate peaks near this position were also observed. The intensity of\nthese peaks depends on the oxygen concentration of the sample, and can be\nsuppressed at temperatures above 320 K. Regular orderings of charge density\nwhich closely match the underlying lattice may help to explain the observed\npropensity for SrCoO$_{3-y}$ (0 $\\leq$ y $\\leq\\frac{1}{2}$) to stabilize at\nparticular phases.\n", "  Bacteria at fluid interfaces endure physical and chemical stresses unique to\nthese highly asymmetric environments. The responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nPAO1 and PA14 to a hexadecane-water interface are compared. PAO1 cells form\nelastic films of bacteria, excreted polysaccharides and proteins, whereas PA14\ncells move actively without forming an elastic film. Studies of PAO1 mutants\nshow that, unlike solid-supported biofilms, elastic interfacial film formation\noccurs in the absence of flagella, pili, or certain polysaccharides. Highly\ninduced genes identified in transcriptional profiling include those for\nputative enzymes and a carbohydrate metabolism enzyme, alkB2; this latter gene\nis not upregulated in PA14 cells. Notably, PAO1 mutants lacking the alkB2 gene\nfail to form an elastic layer. Rather, they form an active film like that\nformed by PA14. These findings demonstrate that genetic expression is altered\nby interfacial confinement, and suggest that the ability to metabolize alkanes\nmay play a role in elastic film formation at oil-water interfaces.\n", "  In these proceedings I review the status of an ongoing project that aims at\nsolving the quark propagator Dyson-Schwinger equation in the complex domain.\nThe novel aspect of the approach is that the non-analyticities arising\nthroughout the iteration of the equation are to be taken into account in an\nappropriate way through dynamic contour deformation. Because of the complexity\nof the approach, these studies are undertaken in a heavily truncated scenario\nthat serves as a toy model for the development of the numerical techniques that\nare required to treat the system in a mathematically sound way.\n", "  Quasi-periodic structures of quasicrystals yield novel effects in diverse\nsystems. However, there is little investigation on employing quasi-periodic\nstructures in the morphology control. Here, we show the use of quasi-periodic\nsurface structures in controlling the transition of liquid droplets. Although\nsurface structures seem random-like, we find that on these surfaces, droplets\nspread to well-defined 5-fold symmetric shapes and the symmetry of droplet\nshapes spontaneously restore during spreading, hitherto unreported in the\nmorphology control of droplets. To obtain physical insights into these symmetry\ntransitions, we conduct energy analysis and perform systematic experiments by\nvarying properties of both liquid droplet and patterned surface. The results\nshow the dominant factors in determining droplet shapes to be surface\ntopography and the self-similarity of the surface structure. Our findings\nsignificantly advance the control capability of the droplet morphology. Such a\nquasi-periodic patterning strategy can offer a new method to achieve complex\npatterns.\n", "  To improve atomically controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of\ngraphene, understanding the evolution from various carbon species to a graphene\nnuclei on various catalyst surfaces is essential. Experimentally, an\nultra-stable carbon cluster on Ru(0001), Rh(111) surfaces was observed, while\nits structure and formation process were still under highly debate. Using ab\ninitio calculations and kinetic analyses, we disclosed a specific type of\ncarbon clusters, composed of a C21 core and a few dangling C atoms around, were\nexceptional stable in the size range from 21 to 27. The most stable one of\nthem, an isomer of C24 characterized as three dangling C atoms attached to the\nC21 (denoted as C21-3C), is the most promising candidate for the experimental\nobservation. The ultra-stability of C21-3C originates from both the stable core\nand the appropriate passivation of dangling carbon atoms by the catalyst\nsurface.\n", "  Ni-based superalloys have been the subject of enormous usage in scenarios\nwhere the loading is heavy and often occurs at elevated temperatures. The\nstrengthening mechanisms that come into play within the metallic lattice have\nbeen studied extensively as micromechanical MMC models. These continuum\nformulations suffer from several limitations. The underlying mechanisms at the\natomistic scale have not yet been well understood. The report attempts to model\nthe interaction of moving dislocation with cuboidal precipitates and explain\nthe strengthening effect. The effect of particle size and inter-particle\ndistance on the strength are evaluated. Several physically meaningful results\nhave also been interpreted and shown.\n", "  The assumption that we are typical observers plays a core role in attempts to\nmake multiverse theories empirically testable. A widely shared worry about this\nassumption is that it suffers from systematic ambiguity concerning the\nreference class of observers with respect to which typicality is assumed. As a\nway out, Srednicki and Hartle recommend that we empirically test typicality\nwith respect to different candidate reference classes in analogy to how we test\nphysical theories. Unfortunately, as this paper argues, this idea fails because\ntypicality is not the kind of assumption that can be subjected to empirical\ntests. As an alternative, a background information constraint on observer\nreference class choice is suggested according to which the observer reference\nclass should be chosen such that it includes precisely those observers who one\ncould possibly be, given one's assumed background information.\n", "  We study fluctuations and correlations of the average transverse momentum of\nparticles emitted in heavy-ion collisions. Fluctuations of the average\ntransverse momentum are related to event-by-event fluctuations of the size and\nentropy of the initial source. Hydrodynamic calculations using a Glauber model\nwith quark degrees of freedom reproduce the data. We study correlations of the\naverage transverse momentum in different rapidity bins. We propose a definition\nof the observable that can be directly related to correlations of the\ncollective flow variables.\n", "  Among asteroids there exist ambiguities in their rotation period\ndeterminations. They are due to incomplete coverage of the rotation, noise\nand/or aliases resulting from gaps between separate lightcurves. To help to\nremove such uncertainties, basic characteristic of the lightcurves resulting\nfrom constraints imposed by the asteroid shapes and geometries of observations\nshould be identified. We simulated light variations of asteroids which shapes\nwere modelled as Gaussian random spheres, with random orientations of spin\nvectors and phase angles changed every $5^\\circ$ from $0^\\circ$ to $65^\\circ$.\nThis produced 1.4 mln lightcurves. For each simulated lightcurve Fourier\nanalysis has been made and the harmonic of the highest amplitude was recorded.\nFrom the statistical point of view, all lightcurves observed at phase angles\n$\\alpha < 30^\\circ$, with peak-to-peak amplitudes $A>0.2$ mag are bimodal.\nSecond most frequently dominating harmonic is the first one, with the 3rd\nharmonic following right after. For 1% of lightcurves with amplitudes $A < 0.1$\nmag and phase angles $\\alpha < 40^\\circ$ 4th harmonic dominates.\n", "  We are reporting that the Lugiato-Lefever equation describing the frequency\ncomb generation in ring resonators with the localized pump and loss terms also\ndescribes the simultaneous nonlinear resonances leading to the multistability\nof nonlinear modes and coexisting solitons that are associated with the\nspectrally distinct frequency combs.\n", "  We study the dynamics of solutions of infinitely thin needles up to densities\ndeep in the semidilute regime by Brownian dynamics simulations. For high\ndensities, these solutions become strongly entangled and the motion of a needle\nis essentially restricted to a one-dimensional sliding in a confining tube\ncomposed of neighboring needles. From the density-dependent behavior of the\norientational and translational diffusion, we extract the long-time transport\ncoefficients and the geometry of the confining tube. The sliding motion within\nthe tube becomes visible in the non-Gaussian parameter of the translational\nmotion as an extended plateau at intermediate times and in the intermediate\nscattering function as an algebraic decay. This transient dynamic arrest is\nalso corroborated by the local exponent of the mean-square displacements\nperpendicular to the needle axis. Moreover, the probability distribution of the\ndisplacements perpendicular to the needle becomes strongly non-Gaussian, rather\nit displays an exponential distribution for large displacements. On the other\nhand, based on the analysis of higher-order correlations of the orientation we\nfind that the rotational motion becomes diffusive again for strong confinement.\nAt coarse-grained time and length scales, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the\nneedle for the high entanglement is captured by a single freely diffusing\nphantom needle with long-time transport coefficients obtained from the needle\nin solution. The time-dependent dynamics of the phantom needle is also assessed\nanalytically in terms of spheroidal wave functions. The dynamic behavior of the\nneedle in solution is found to be identical to needle Lorentz systems, where a\ntracer needle explores a quenched disordered array of other needles.\n", "  We introduce the generalized Lugiato-Lefever equation describing nonlinear\neffects in the bottle microresonators. We demonstrate that the nonlinear modes\nof these resonators can form multiple coexisting and overlapping nonlinear\nresonances and that their instabilities lead to the generation of the low\nrepetition rate frequency combs.\n", "  We present experimental and numerical data on the supercontinuum generation\nin an optical fiber pumped in the normal dispersion range where the seeded dark\nand the spontaneously generated bright solitons contribute to the spectral\nbroadening. We report the dispersive radiation arising from the interaction of\nthe bright and dark solitons. This radiation consists of the two weak\ndispersing pulses that continuously shift their frequencies and shape the short\nand long wavelength wings of the supercontinuum spectrum.\n", "  The metabolic process in a cell is modeled with the use of the Fourier\ntransformation. The histograms of the invariant measures of chaotic attractors\nare constructed. In particular, a scenario of adaptation of the metabolic\nprocess under a change in the dissipation of a kinetic membrane potential and\nthe sequence of the modes of self-organization and deterministic chaos are\ndetermined. Respectively, the spectral mapping of the attractors of these modes\nis considered. The structural-functional connections of the metabolic process\nin a cell as an integral dissipative system are analyzed.\n", "  After the discovery of Dirac fermions in graphene, it has become a natural\nquestion to ask whether it is possible to realize Dirac fermions in other\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials as well. In this work, we report the discovery\nof multiple Dirac-like electronic bands in ultrathin Ge films grown on Au(111)\nby angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. By tuning the thickness of the\nfilms, we are able to observe the evolution of their electronic structure when\npassing through the monolayer limit. Our discovery may signify the synthesis of\ngermanene, a 2D honeycomb structure made of Ge, which is a promising platform\nfor exploring exotic topological phenomena and enabling potential applications.\n", "  Performance of triple GEM prototypes has been evaluated by means of a muon\nbeam at the H4 line of the SPS test area at CERN. The data from two planar\nprototypes have been reconstructed and analyzed offline with two clusterization\nmethods: the enter of gravity of the charge distribution and the micro Time\nProjection Chamber (\\muTPC). Concerning the spatial resolution, the charge\ncentroid cluster reconstruction performs extremely well with no magnetic field:\nthe resolution is well below 100 \\mum . Increasing the magnetic field\nintensity, the resolution degrades almost linearly as effect of the Lorentz\nforce that displaces, broadens and asymmetrizes the electron avalanche. Tuning\nthe electric fields of the GEM prototype we could achieve the unprecedented\nspatial resolution of 190 \\mum at 1 Tesla. In order to boost the spatial\nresolution with strong magnetic field and inclined tracks a \\muTPC cluster\nreconstruction has been investigated. Such a readout mode exploits the good\ntime resolution of the GEM detector and electronics to reconstruct the\ntrajectory of the particle inside the conversion gap. Beside the improvement of\nthe spatial resolution, information on the track angle can be also extracted.\nThe new clustering algorithm has been tested with diagonal tracks with no\nmagnetic field showing a resolution between 100 um and 150 um for the incident\nangle ranging from 10{\\deg} to 45{\\deg} . Studies show similar performance with\n1 Tesla magnetic field. This is the first use of a \\muTPC readout with a triple\nGEM detector in magnetic field. This study has shown that a combined readout is\ncapable to guarantee stable performance over a broad spectrum of particle\nmomenta and incident angles, up to a 1 Tesla magnetic field.\n", "  Theoretically research of the behavior of $^{41}$K $D_1$ and $D_2$ lines for\n$\\pi$ polarized resonant light is conducted in the presence of strong magnetic\nfield when the total electronic angular momentum $J$ and nuclear spin $I$ are\ndecoupled. We show that in the case of linear polarization and for D1 line\nthere are two transitions, so called guiding transitions (GT) that maintain\ntheir probabilities and frequency slopes. In Hyperfine Paschen-Back (HPB)\nregime other transitions are coming together to those GTs, making 2 groups (4\nin each). Each transition in the group has the same frequency slope and\nprobability as the GT in their group. It is demonstrated that from 12 ($D_1$)\nand 20 ($D_2$) initially allowed Zeeman transitions (taking into account the\nselection rules) at low B-field, only 8 transitions in each $D$ line remain in\nabsorption spectra at $B > 200$ G. A complete HPB regime for relatively low\nmagnetic fields $B \\sim 200$ G has been observed. This value is the smallest\nfor all alkali metals.\n", "  We comment on some aspects of the paper entitled \"Evanescent-wave Johnson\nnoise in small devices\" recently posted by V. N. Premakumar, M. G. Vavilov and\nR. Joynt.\n", "  Online Social Communities (OSCs) provide a medium for connecting people,\nsharing news, eliciting information, and finding jobs, among others. The\ndynamics of the interaction among the members of OSCs is not always growth\ndynamics. Instead, a $\\textit{decay}$ or $\\textit{inactivity}$ dynamics often\nhappens, which makes an OSC obsolete. Understanding the behavior and the\ncharacteristics of the members of an inactive community help to sustain the\ngrowth dynamics of these communities and, possibly, prevents them from being\nout of service. In this work, we provide two prediction models for predicting\nthe interaction decay of community members, namely: a Simple Threshold Model\n(STM) and a supervised machine learning classification framework. We conducted\nevaluation experiments for our prediction models supported by a $\\textit{ground\ntruth}$ of decayed communities extracted from the StackExchange platform. The\nresults of the experiments revealed that it is possible, with satisfactory\nprediction performance in terms of the F1-score and the accuracy, to predict\nthe decay of the activity of the members of these communities using\nnetwork-based attributes and network-exogenous attributes of the members. The\nupper bound of the prediction performance of the methods we used is $0.91$ and\n$0.83$ for the F1-score and the accuracy, respectively. These results indicate\nthat network-based attributes are correlated with the activity of the members\nand that we can find decay patterns in terms of these attributes. The results\nalso showed that the structure of the decayed communities can be used to\nsupport the alive communities by discovering inactive members.\n", "  We investigate a Born - Infeld-type model of nonlinear electrodynamics,\npossessing three parameters, coupled with general relativity. As a particular\ncase Born-Infeld electrodynamics is reproduced. There is no singularity of the\nelectric field at the centre of point-like charged particles and self-energy of\ncharges is finite in this model. The magnetized black hole is studied and\nsolutions are obtained. We find the asymptotic of the metric and mass functions\nat $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ and $r\\rightarrow 0$, and corrections to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m solution. Thermodynamics of black holes is investigated.\nWe calculate the Hawking temperature of black holes and show that black holes\nare stable and there are no phase transitions in the model under consideration.\n", "  During the past century, the electromagnetic field momentum in material media\nhas been under debate in the Abraham-Minkowski controversy as convincing\narguments have been advanced in favor of both the Abraham and Minkowski forms\nof photon momentum. Here we study the photon momentum and optical forces in\ncavity structures in the cases of dynamical and steady-state fields. In the\ndescription of the single-photon transmission process, we use a field-kinetic\none-photon theory. Our model suggests that in the medium photons couple with\nthe induced atomic dipoles forming polariton quasiparticles with the Minkowski\nform momentum. The Abraham momentum can be associated to the electromagnetic\nfield part of the coupled polariton state. The polariton with the Minkowski\nmomentum is shown to obey the uniform center of mass of energy motion that has\npreviously been interpreted to support only the Abraham momentum. When\ndescribing the steady-state nonequilibrium field distributions we use the\nrecently developed quantized fluctuational electrodynamics (QFED) formalism.\nWhile allowing detailed studies of light propagation and quantum field\nfluctuations in interfering structures, our methods also provide practical\ntools for modeling optical energy transfer and the formation of thermal balance\nin nanodevices as well as studying electromagnetic forces in optomechanical\ndevices.\n", "  Conventionally, theories of electromagnetic waves in a medium assume that\nonly the energy of the field propagates in a transparent medium and the medium\nis left undisturbed. Consequently, the transport of mass density and the\nrelated kinetic and elastic energies of atoms is neglected. We have recently\npresented foundations of a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by\nconsidering a light wave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms\ndriven by optoelastic forces between the induced dipoles and the\nelectromagnetic field. In the previously discussed mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle approach, we considered the light pulse as an isolated coupled\nstate between the photon and matter and showed that the momentum and the\ntransferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and the\nfundamental conservation laws of nature. In the present work, we combine the\nelectrodynamics of continuous media and elasticity theory to account for the\nspace- and time dependent dynamics of the light pulse and the associated mass\nand momentum distributions of the mass density wave (MDW). In this optoelastic\ncontinuum dynamics (OCD) approach, we obtain a numerically accurate solution of\nthe Newtonian continuum dynamics of the medium when the light pulse is\npropagating in it. For an incoming Gaussian light pulse having total energy\n$E_0$ in vacuum, the OCD simulations of the light pulse propagating in a\ncrystal having refractive index $n$ give the same momentum $p=nE_0/c$ and the\ntransferred mass $\\delta m=(n^2-1)E_0/c^2$ as the MP quasiparticle approach.\nSince the elastic forces are included in our theory on equal footing with the\noptical forces, our theory also predicts how the mass and thermal equilibria\nare re-established by elastic waves.\n", "  Nanoscale structuring holds promise to improve thermoelectric properties of\nmaterials for energy conversion and photodetection. We report a study of the\nspatial distribution of the photothermoelectric voltage in thin-film nanowire\ndevices fabricated from single metal. A focused laser beam is used to locally\nheat the metal nanostructure via a combination of direct absorption and\nexcitation of a plasmon resonance in Au devices. As seen previously, in\nnanowires shorter than the spot size of the laser, we observe a thermoelectric\nvoltage distribution that is consistent with the local Seebeck coefficient\nbeing spatially dependent on the width of the nanostructure. In longer\nstructures, we observe extreme variability of the net thermoelectric voltage as\nthe laser spot is scanned along the length of the nanowire. The sign and\nmagnitude of the thermoelectric voltage is sensitive to the structural defects,\nmetal grain structure, and surface passivation of the nanowire. This finding\nopens the possibility of improved local control of the thermoelectric\nproperties at the nanoscale.\n", "  We use CRPropa 3 to show how the expected cosmogenic neutrino and gamma-ray\nspectra depend on the maximum energy of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nat their sources, on the spectral index at injection and on the chemical\ncomposition of UHECRs. The isotropic diffuse gamma-ray background measured by\nFermi/LAT is already close to touching upon a model with co-moving source\nevolution and with the chemical composition, spectral index and maximum\nacceleration energy optimized to provide the best fit to the UHECR spectrum and\ncomposition measured by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. Additionally, the\ndetectable fraction of protons present at the highest energies in UHECRs, for\nexperiments with sensitivities to the single-flavor neutrino flux at $\\sim1$\nEeV in the range of $\\sim 10^{-8}$ - $10^{-10}$ GeV cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\nsr$^{-1}$, is shown as a function of the evolution of UHECR sources.\nExperiments that reach this sensitivity will be able to significantly constrain\nthe proton fraction for realistic source evolution models.\n", "  We review our analysis of $\\pi K$ scattering using forward dispersion\nrelations. The method yields a set of simple parameterizations that are\ncompatible with forward dispersion relations up to 1.6 GeV while still\ndescribing the data. Once the partial waves are obtained, we calculate the\npoles in the complex plane by means of Pad\\'e approximants, thus avoiding a\nparticular model for the pole parameterization. The resonances calculated below\n1.8 GeV are the much debated scalar $\\kappa$-meson, nowadays known as\n$K_0^*(800)$, the scalar $K_0^*(1430)$, the $K^*(892)$ and $K_1^*(1410)$\nvectors, the spin-two $K_2^*(1430)$ as well as the spin-three $K^*_3(1780)$.\n", "  EUTelescope is arguably the most used software to reconstruct tracks from\ntelescope data. This guide explains how to install a version adapted for the\nreconstruction of ITk Strip test beam data. In this version, an example of such\nreconstruction with 2016 data is provided. In addition, this example will be\nexplained step-by-step and a general overview of how to operate EUTelescope is\ngiven. It is also briefly explained how the post-reconstruction analysis has\nbeen performed. The aim of this guide is to be used a starting point for\nEUTelescope beginners in future test beam reconstruction and analysis works. It\nis focused on reconstruction for the ATLAS ITk Strip detector using a binary\nread-out.\n", "  It is of great importance to develop inorganic solid electrolytes with high\nionic conductivity, thus enabling solid state Li-ion batteries to address the\nnotorious safety issue about the current technology due to use of highly\nflammable liquid organic electrolytes. On the basis of systematic first\nprinciples modelling, we have formulated new inorganic electrolytes with\nultra-low activation energies for long-distance diffusion of Li+ ions, through\nalloying in the cubic Li6PA5X chalcogenides (chalcogen A; halogen X). We find\nthat the long-distance transportation of Li+ is dictated by inter-octahedral\ndiffusion, as the activation energy for Li+ to migrate over a Li6A octahedron\nis minimal. The inter-octahedral diffusion barrier for Li+ is largely dependent\non the interaction with chalcogen anions in the compound. Radical reduction of\ndiffusion barrier for Li+ ions can be realized through isovalent substitution\nof S using elements of lower electronegativity, together with smaller halogen\nions on the X site.\n", "  Finding the best model to describe the {\\alpha}-decay process is an old and\nongoing challenge in nuclear physics. The present work systematically studied\n{\\alpha}-decay half-lives for the favored ground-state-to-ground-state\ntransitions of 344 isotopes of nuclei with 52 <= Z <= 107 using 28 versions of\nthe proximity potential model in the framework of the WKB approximation. The\npresent study introduces the best proximity versions with the fewest deviations\nwith respect to experimental values. The models for Prox. 77-set 4, Prox.\n77-set 5, and Dutt 2011 with the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of <1 were\nfound to predict {\\alpha}-decay half-lives better than the other models.\nComparison with fusion studies shows that Dutt 2011 is an appropriate model\nboth for {\\alpha}-decay studies and for prediction of the barrier\ncharacteristic in heavy-ion fusion reactions. The calculation of {\\alpha}-decay\nhalf-lives were repeated for even-even, even-odd, odd-even, and odd-odd nuclei.\nThis detailed comparative study reveals that for these versions the half-lives\nof the even-even nuclei with RMSDs of <0.6 show less deviation than the\neven-odd, odd-even, and odd-odd nuclei.\n", "  Intrinsic instability of trajectories characterizes chaotic dynamical\nsystems. We report here that trajectories can exhibit a surprisingly high\ndegree of stability, over a very long time, in a chaotic dynamical system. We\nprovide a detailed quantitative description of this effect for a\none-dimensional model of inertial particles in a turbulent flow using\nlarge-deviation theory. Specifically, the determination of the entropy function\nfor the distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents reduces to the analysis\nof a Schr\\\"odinger equation, which is tackled by semi-classical methods.\n", "  Networks are widely used to model real-world systems and uncover their\ntopological features. Network properties such as the degree distribution and\nshortest path length have been computed in numerous real-world networks, and\nmost of them have been shown to be both scale-free and small-world networks.\nGraphlets and network motifs are subgraph patterns that capture richer\nstructural information than aforementioned global network properties, and these\nlocal features are often used for network comparison. However, past work on\ngraphlets and network motifs is almost exclusively applicable only for static\nnetworks. Many systems are better represented as temporal networks which depict\nnot only how a system was at a given stage but also how they evolved.\nTime-dependent information is crucial in temporal networks and, by disregarding\nthat data, static methods can not achieve the best possible results. This paper\nintroduces an extension of graphlets for temporal networks. Our proposed method\nenumerates all 4-node graphlet-orbits in each network-snapshot, building the\ncorresponding orbit-transition matrix in the process. Our hypothesis is that\nnetworks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions\nwhich better identify them than simple static patterns, and this is assessed on\na set of real temporal networks split into categories. In order to perform\ntemporal network comparison we put forward an orbit-transition-agreement metric\n(OTA). OTA correctly groups a set of temporal networks that both static network\nmotifs and graphlets fail to do so adequately. Furthermore, our method produces\ninterpretable results which we use to uncover characteristic orbit transitions,\nand that can be regarded as a network-fingerprint.\n", "  The power series method has been adapted to compute the spectrum of the\nSchrodinger equation for central potential of the form $V(r)={d_{-2}\\over\nr^2}+{d_{-1}\\over r}+\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} d_{i}r^i$. The bound-state energies\nare given as zeros of a calculable function, if the potential is confined in a\nspherical box. For an unconfined potential the interval bounding the energy\neigenvalues can be determined in a similar way with an arbitrarily chosen\nprecision. The very accurate results for various spherically symmetric\nanharmonic potentials are presented.\n", "  We present an analysis of the two-dimensional Schrodinger equation for two\nelectrons interacting via Coulombic force and confined in an anizotropic\nharmonic potential. The separable case of wy = 2wx is studied particularly\ncarefully. The closed-form expressions for bound-state energies and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions are found at some particular values of wx. For\nhighly-accurate determination of energy levels at other values of wx, we apply\nan efficient scheme based on the Frobenius expansion.\n"]}
