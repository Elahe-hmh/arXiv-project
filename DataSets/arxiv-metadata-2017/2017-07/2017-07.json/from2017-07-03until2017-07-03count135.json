We argue that for analytic\ndiffeomorphisms, the flux operators can be only constants as functions on the\nconfiguration space in representations with no anomaly, which are zero in the\nstandard representation.\n", "  We present 'BYTe', a comprehensive 'hot' line list for the ro-vibrational\ntransitions of ammonia, 14NH3, in its ground electronic state. This line list\nhas been computed variationally using the program suite TROVE, a new\nspectroscopically-determined potential energy surface and an ab initio dipole\nmoment surface. BYTe, is designed to be used at all temperatures up to 1500K.\nIt comprises 1137650964 transitions in the frequency range from 0 to 12000\ncm-1, constructed from 1366519 energy levels below 18000 cm-1 having J values\nbelow 36. Comparisons with laboratory data confirm the accuracy of the line\nlist which is suitable for modelling a variety of astrophysical problems\nincluding the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs.\n", "  A pendulum prepared perfectly inverted and motionless is a prototype of\nunstable equilibria and corresponds to an unstable hyperbolic fixed point in\nthe dynamical phase space. Unstable fixed points are central to understanding\nHamiltonian chaos in classical systems. In many-body quantum systems,\nmean-field approximations fail in the vicinity of unstable fixed points and\nlead to dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations. Here, we measure the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body quantum pendulum initialized to a\nhyperbolic fixed point of the phase space. The experiment uses a spin-1 Bose\ncondensate, which exhibits Josephson dynamics in the spin populations that\ncorrespond in the mean-field limit to motion of a non-rigid mechanical\npendulum. The condensate is initialized to a minimum uncertainty spin state,\nand quantum fluctuations lead to non-linear spin evolution along a separatrix\nand non-Gaussian probability distributions that are measured to be in good\nagreement with exact quantum calculations up to 0.25 s. At longer times, atomic\nloss due to the finite lifetime of the condensate leads to larger spin\noscillation amplitudes compared to no loss case as orbits depart from the\nseparatrix. This demonstrates how decoherence of a many-body system can result\nin more apparent coherent behaviour. This experiment provides new avenues for\nstudying macroscopic spin systems in the quantum limit and for investigations\nof important topics in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.\n", "  We calculate the quantum capacity of an amplitude-damping channel with time\ncorrelated Markov noise, for two channel uses. Our results show that memory of\nthe channel increases it's ability to transmit quantum information\nsignificantly. We analyze and compare our findings with earlier numerical\nresults on amplitude-damping channel with memory. An upper bound on the amount\nof quantum information transmitted over the channel in presence of memory, for\nan arbitrary number of channel uses is also presented.\n", "  Here we analyse cavity-mediated laser cooling for an experimental setup with\nan external trap which strongly confines the motion of a particle in the\ndirection of the cavity axis. It is shown that the stationary state phonon\nnumber exhibits three sharp minima as a function of the atom-cavity detuning\ndue to a direct atom-phonon-photon coupling term in the system Hamiltonian.\nThese resonances have the same origin as the Mollow triplet in the resonance\nfluorescence of a laser-driven atomic system. It is shown that a laser-Rabi\nfrequency-dependent atom-cavity detuning yields the lowest stationary state\nphonon number for a wide range of experimental parameters.\n", "  This note is devoted to representation of some evolution semigroups. The\nsemigroups are generated by pseudo-differential operators, which are obtained\nby different (parametrized by a number $\\tau$) procedures of quantization from\na certain class of functions (or symbols) defined on the phase space. This\nclass contains functions which are second order polynomials with respect to the\nmomentum variable and also some other functions. The considered semigroups are\nrepresented as limits of $n$-fold iterated integrals when $n$ tends to infinity\n(such representations are called Feynman formulae). Some of these\nrepresentations are constructed with the help of another pseudo-differential\noperators, obtained by the same procedure of quantization (such representations\nare called Hamiltonian Feynman formulae). Some representations are based on\nintegral operators with elementary kernels (these ones are called Lagrangian\nFeynman formulae and are suitable for computations). A family of phase space\nFeynman pseudomeasures corresponding to different procedures of quantization is\nintroduced. The considered evolution semigroups are represented also as phase\nspace Feynman path integrals with respect to these Feynman pseudomeasures. The\nobtained Lagrangian Feynman formulae allow to calculate these phase space\nFeynman path integrals and to connect them with some functional integrals with\nrespect to probability measures.\n", "  Entangled states in high dimensional systems are of great interest due to the\nextended possibilities they provide in quantum information processing.\nRecently, Sun et al. [Phys. Rev. A 82, 052323 (2010)] and Kim et al. [Nat.\nPhys. 8, 117 (2012)] pointed out that weak measurement and quantum weak\nmeasurement reversal can actively combat decoherence. We generalize their\nstudies from qubits to qutrits under amplitude damping decoherence. We find\nthat the qutrit-qutrit entanglement can be partially retrieved for certain\ninitial states when only weak measurement reversals are performed. However, we\ncan completely defeat amplitude damping decoherence for any initial states by\nthe combination of prior weak measurements and post optimal weak measurement\nreversals. The experimental feasibility of our schemes is also discussed.\n", "  The ESA Gaia mission uses two telescopes to create the most ambitious survey\nof the Galaxy. The angle between them must be known with exquisite precision\nand accuracy. An interferometer: the Basic Angle Monitoring system measures its\nvariations. High quality data have been retrieved and analysed for more than a\nyear. A summary of the in-orbit performance and some early results are\npresented\n", "  In this paper we study the Parisi variational problem for mixed $p$-spin\nglasses with Ising spins. Our starting point is a characterization of Parisi\nmeasures whose origin lies in the first order optimality conditions for the\nParisi functional, which is known to be strictly convex. Using this\ncharacterization, we study the phase diagram in the temperature-external field\nplane. We begin by deriving self-consistency conditions for Parisi measures\nthat generalize those of de Almeida and Thouless to all levels of Replica\nSymmetry Breaking (RSB) and all models. As a consequence, we conjecture that\nfor all models the Replica Symmetric (RS) phase is the region determined by the\nnatural analogue of the de Almeida-Thouless condition. We show that for all\nmodels, the complement of this region is in the RSB phase. Furthermore, we show\nthat the conjectured phase boundary is exactly the phase boundary in the plane\nless a bounded set. In the case of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we extend\nthis last result to show that this bounded set does not contain the critical\npoint at zero external field.\n", "  Stationary axisymmetric binary systems of unequal counterrotating Kerr-Newman\nsources with a massless strut in between are studied. By means of the choice of\na suitable parametrization, the axis conditions and the absence of individual\nmagnetic charges are fulfilled; thus, the entire metric reduces to a\n6-parametric asymptotically flat exact solution. Later on, with the purpose to\ndescribe interacting black holes, the analytic functional form of the horizon\nhalf-length parameter $\\sigma_{k}$ is obtained explicitly in terms of physical\nKomar parameters: mass $M_{k}$, electric charge $Q_{k}$, angular momentum\n$J_{k}$, and coordinate distance $R$, where the seven physical parameters\nsatisfy a simple algebraic relation. Finally, in the limit of extreme black\nholes, the full metric is derived in a closed analytical form, and a study on\nthe absence or appearance of naked singularities off the axis is presented.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the dimensionality of a single electrically driven\nvortex bounded by two no-slip and perfectly insulating horizontal walls distant\nby $h$. The study was performed in the weakly inertial limit by means of an\nasymptotic expansion, which is valid for any Hartmann number. We show that the\ndimensionality of the leading order can be fully described using the single\nparameter $l_z^\\nu / h$, where $l_z^\\nu$ represents the distance over which the\nLorentz force is able to act before being balanced by viscous dissipation. The\nbase flow happens to introduce inertial recirculations in the meridional plane\nat the first order, which are shown to follow two radically different\nmechanisms: inverse Ekman pumping driven by a vertical pressure gradient along\nthe axis of the vortex, or direct Ekman pumping driven by a radial pressure\ngradient in the Hartman boundary layers. We demonstrate that when the base flow\nis quasi-2D, the relative importance of direct and inverse pumping is solely\ndetermined by the aspect ratio $\\eta / h$, where $\\eta$ refers to the width of\nthe vortex. Of both mechanisms, only inverse pumping appears to act as a\nsignificant source of helicity.\n", "  We consider the Dirichlet to Neumann operator for abelian Yang- Mills\nboundary conditions. We treat the case for space-time manifolds with general\nsmooth boundary components. The aim is constructing a complex structure for the\nsymplectic space of boundary conditions of Euler-Lagrange solutions modulo\ngauge. Thus we prepare a suitable scenario for geometric quantization of\nabelian gauge fields following a symplectic reduction procedure in a Lagrangian\nsetting.\n", "  This paper discusses a collective quantum effect which might play an\nimportant role in sonoluminescence experiments. We suggest that it occurs\nduring the final stages of the collapse phase and enhances the heating of the\nparticles inside the bubble.\n", "  A Lagrangian formulation is constructed for particle interpretations of\nquantum mechanics, a well-known example of such an interpretation being the\nBohm model. The advantages of such a description are that the equations for\nparticle motion, field evolution and conservation laws can all be deduced from\na single Lagrangian density expression. The formalism presented is Lorentz\ninvariant. This paper follows on from a previous one which was limited to the\nsingle-particle case. The present paper treats the more general case of many\nparticles in an entangled state. It is found that describing more than one\nparticle while maintaining a relativistic description requires the\nspecification of final boundary conditions as well as the usual initial ones,\nwith the experimenter's controllable choice of the final conditions thereby\nexerting a backwards-in-time influence. This retrocausality then allows an\nimportant theoretical step forward to be made, namely that it becomes possible\nto dispense with the usual, many-dimensional description in configuration space\nand instead revert to a description in spacetime using separate,\nsingle-particle wavefunctions.\n", "  We revisit the $m \\alpha^6 (m/M)$ order corrections to the hyperfine\nsplitting in the H$_2^+$ ion, and find a hitherto unrecognized second-order\nrelativistic contribution associated with the vibrational motion of the nuclei.\nInclusion of this correction term produces theoretical predictions which are in\nexcellent agreement with experimental data [K. B. Jefferts, Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\\n\\textbf{23}, 1476 (1969)], thereby concluding a nearly fifty years long\ntheoretical quest to explain the experimental results within their 1-ppm error.\nThe agreement between theory and experiment corroborates the proton structural\nproperties as derived from the hyperfine structure of atomic hydrogen. Our work\nfurthermore indicates that for future improvements, a full three-body\nevaluation of the $m \\alpha^6 (m/M)$ correction term will be mandatory.\n", "  In this paper we present some new cosmological solutions in massive gravity\ntheory. Some homogeneous and isotropic solutions correctly describe accelerated\nevolutions for the universe. The study was realized considering a specific form\nto the fiducial metric and found different functions and constant parameters of\nthe theory that guarantees the conservation of the energy momentum tensor.\nSeveral accelerating cosmologies were found, all of them reproducing a\ncosmological constant term proportional to the graviton mass, with a de Sitter\ntype solution for the scale factor. We have also verified that when the\nfiducial metric is close to the physical metric the solutions are absent,\nexcept for some specific open cases.\n", "  We consider a scaling limit of a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) with\na nonlocal nonlinearity showing that it reproduces in the limit of cutoff\nremoval a NLS equation with nonlinearity concentrated at a point. The\nregularized dynamics is described by the equation \\begin{equation*}\ni\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t} \\psi^\\varepsilon(t)= -\\Delta \\psi^\\varepsilon(t)\n+ g(\\varepsilon,\\mu,|(\\rho^\\varepsilon,\\psi^\\varepsilon(t))|^{2\\mu})\n(\\rho^\\varepsilon,\\psi^\\varepsilon(t)) \\rho^\\varepsilon \\end{equation*} where\n$\\rho^{\\varepsilon} \\to \\delta_0$ weakly and the function $g$ embodies the\nnonlinearity and the scaling and has to be fine tuned in order to have a\nnontrivial limit dynamics. The limit dynamics is a nonlinear version of point\ninteraction in dimension three and it has been previously studied in several\npapers as regards the well-posedness, blow-up and asymptotic properties of\nsolutions. Our result is the first justification of the model as the point\nlimit of a regularized dynamics.\n", "  Propagation of light beams through scattering or multimode systems may lead\nto randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is\nnot lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of\nthe original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the\nscattering system. Here, we show that we can automatically unscramble four\noptical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide,\nundoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of\nsilicon photonics Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Using embedded transparent\ndetectors and a progressive tuning algorithm, the mesh self-configures\nautomatically and reset itself after significantly perturbing the mixing,\nwithout turning off the beams. We demonstrate the recovery of four separate 10\nGbits/s information channels, with residual cross-talk between beams of -20dB.\nThis principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should\nbe applicable in a wide range of optical applications.\n", "  In this paper, we study the low temperature limit of the spherical\nCrisanti-Sommers variational problem. We identify the $\\Gamma$-limit of the\nCrisanti-Sommers functionals, thereby establishing a rigorous variational\nproblem for the ground state energy of spherical mixed $p$-spin glasses. As an\napplication, we compute moderate deviations of the corresponding minimizers in\nthe low temperature limit. In particular, for a large class of models this\nyields moderate deviations for the overlap distribution. We then analyze the\nground state energy problem. We show that this variational problem is dual to\nan obstacle-type problem. This duality is at the heart of our analysis. We\npresent the regularity theory of the optimizers of the primal and dual\nproblems. This culminates in a simple method for constructing a finite\ndimensional space in which these optimizers live for any model. As a\nconsequence of these results, we unify independent predictions of\nCrisanti-Leuzzi and Auffinger-Ben Arous regarding the 1RSB phase in this limit.\nWe find that the \"positive replicon eigenvalue\" and \"pure-like\" conditions are\ntogether necessary for optimality, but that neither are themselves sufficient,\nanswering a question of Auffinger and Ben Arous in the negative. We end by\nproving that these conditions completely characterize the 1RSB phase in\n$2+p$-spin models.\n", "  We investigate how a Higgs mechanism could be responsible for the emergence\nof gravity in extensions of Einstein theory. In this scenario, at high\nenergies, symmetry restoration could \"turn off\" gravity, with dramatic\nimplications for cosmology and quantum gravity. The sense in which gravity is\nmuted depends on the details of the implementation. In the most extreme case\ngravity's dynamical degrees of freedom would only be unleashed after the Higgs\nfield acquires a non-trivial vacuum expectation value, with gravity reduced to\na topological field theory in the symmetric phase. We might also identify the\nHiggs and the Brans-Dicke fields in such a way that in the unbroken phase\nNewton's constant vanishes, decoupling matter and gravity. We discuss the broad\nimplications of these scenarios.\n", "  The coupling between lattice and charge degrees of freedom in condensed\nmatter materials is ubiquitous and can often result in interesting properties\nand ordered phases, including conventional superconductivity, charge density\nwave order, and metal-insulator transitions. Angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and both neutron and non-resonant x-ray scattering serve as\neffective probes for determining the behavior of appropriate, individual\ndegrees of freedom -- the electronic structure and lattice excitation, or\nphonon dispersion, respectively. However, each provides less direct information\nabout the mutual coupling between the degrees of freedom, usual through\nself-energy effects, which tend to renormalize and broaden spectral features\nprecisely where the coupling is strong, impacting ones ability to quantitively\ncharacterize the coupling. Here we demonstrate that resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering, or RIXS, can be an effective tool to directly determine the\nrelative strength and momentum dependence of the electron-phonon coupling in\ncondensed matter systems. Using a diagrammatic approach for an 8-band model of\ncopper oxides, we study the contributions from the lowest order diagrams to the\nfull RIXS intensity for a realistic scattering geometry, accounting for matrix\nelement effects in the scattering cross-section as well as the momentum\ndependence of the electron-phonon coupling vertex. A detailed examination of\nthese maps offers a unique perspective into the characteristics of\nelectron-phonon coupling, which complements both neutron and non-resonant x-ray\nscattering, as well as Raman and infrared conductivity.\n", "  The projective construction of quantum states for field theories may be\nflawed--in some cases the construction may possibly lead to spaces of quantum\nstates which are \"too small\" to be used in quantization of field theories. Here\nwe present a slight modification of the construction which is free from this\nflaw.\n", "  We use recently developed angulon theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 203001\n(2015)] to study the rotational spectrum of a cyanide molecular anion immersed\ninto Bose-Einstein condensates of rubidium and strontium. Based on $\\textit {ab\ninitio}$ potential energy surfaces, we provide a detailed study of the\nrotational Lamb shift and many-body-induced fine structure which arise due to\ndressing of molecular rotation by a field of phonon excitations. We demonstrate\nthat the magnitude of these effects is large enough in order to be observed in\nmodern experiments on cold molecular ions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel\nmethod to construct pseudopotentials starting from the $\\textit {ab initio}$\npotential energy surfaces, which provides a means to obtain effective coupling\nconstants for low-energy polaron models.\n", "  Rare trajectories of stochastic systems are important to understand --\nbecause of their potential impact. However, their properties are by definition\ndifficult to sample directly. Population dynamics provides a numerical tool\nallowing their study, by means of simulating a large number of copies of the\nsystem, which are subjected to selection rules that favor the rare trajectories\nof interest. Such algorithms are plagued by finite simulation time- and finite\npopulation size- effects that can render their use delicate. In this paper, we\npresent a numerical approach which uses the finite-time and finite-size\nscalings of estimators of the large deviation functions associated to the\ndistribution of rare trajectories. The method we propose allows one to extract\nthe infinite-time and infinite-size limit of these estimators which -- as shown\non the contact process -- provides a significant improvement of the large\ndeviation functions estimators compared to the the standard one.\n", "  We have calculated the in-medium magnetic moments of octet baryons in the\npresence of hot and dense symmetric nuclear matter. Effective magnetic moments\nof baryons have been derived from medium modified quark masses within chiral\nSU(3) quark mean field model.\n  Further, for better insight of medium modification of baryonic magnetic\nmoments, we have considered the explicit contributions from the valence quarks,\nsea quarks as well as sea orbital angular momentum of sea quarks. These effects\nhave been successful in giving the description of baryonic magnetic moments in\nvacuum.\n  The magnetic moments of baryons are found to vary significantly as a function\nof density of nuclear medium.\n", "  A graph is regularizable if it is possible to assign weights to its edges so\nthat all nodes have the same degree. Weights can be positive, nonnegative or\narbitrary as soon as the regularization degree is not null. Positive and\nnonnegative regularizable graphs have been thoroughly investigated in the\nliterature. In this work, we propose and study arbitrarily regularizable\ngraphs. In particular, we investigate necessary and sufficient regularization\nconditions on the topology of the graph and of the corresponding adjacency\nmatrix. Moreover, we study the computational complexity of the regularization\nproblem and characterize it as a linear programming model.\n", "  Gender differences in collaborative research have received little attention\nwhen compared with the growing importance that women hold in academia and\nresearch. Unsurprisingly, most of bibliometric databases have a strong lack of\ndirectly available information by gender. Although empirical-based network\napproaches are often used in the study of research collaboration, the studies\nabout the influence of gender dissimilarities on the resulting topological\noutcomes are still scarce. Here, networks of scientific subjects are used to\ncharacterize patterns that might be associated to five categories of\nauthorships which were built based on gender. We find enough evidence that\ngender imbalance in scientific authorships brings a peculiar trait to the\nnetworks induced from papers published in Web of Science (WoS) indexed journals\nof Economics over the period 2010-2015 and having at least one author\naffiliated to a Portuguese institution. Our results show the emergence of a\nspecific pattern when the network of co-occurring subjects is induced from a\nset of papers exclusively authored by men. Such a male-exclusive authorship\ncondition is found to be the solely responsible for the emergence that\nparticular shape in the network structure. This peculiar trait might facilitate\nfuture network analyses of research collaboration and interdisciplinarity.\n", "  In recent years entanglement measures, such as the von Neumann and the\nR\\'enyi entropies, provided a unique opportunity to access elusive feature of\nquantum many-body systems. However, extracting entanglement properties\nanalytically, experimentally, or in numerical simulations can be a formidable\ntask. Here, by combining the replica trick and the Jarzynski equality we devise\na new effective out-of-equilibrium protocol for measuring the equilibrium\nR\\'enyi entropies. The key idea is to perform a quench in the geometry of the\nreplicas. The R\\'enyi entropies are obtained as the exponential average of the\nwork performed during the quench. We illustrate an application of the method in\nclassical Monte Carlo simulations, although it could be useful in different\ncontexts, such as in Quantum Monte Carlo, or experimentally in cold-atom\nsystems. The method is most effective in the quasi-static regime, i.e., for a\nslow quench, where it allows to obtain the R\\'enyi entropies in a single\nrealization of the protocol. As a benchmark, we present results for the R\\'enyi\nentropies in the Ising universality class in $1$$+$$1$ dimensions, which are\nfound in perfect agreement with the well-known Conformal Field Theory (CFT)\npredictions.\n", "  Aeolian transport of sand and dust is driven by turbulent winds that\nfluctuate over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. However, commonly\nused aeolian transport models do not explicitly account for such fluctuations,\nlikely contributing to substantial discrepancies between models and\nmeasurements. Underlying this problem is the absence of accurate sand flux\nmeasurements at the short time scales at which wind speed fluctuates. Here, we\ndraw on extensive field measurements of aeolian saltation to develop a\nmethodology for generating high-frequency (25 Hz) time series of total\n(vertically-integrated) saltation flux, namely by calibrating high-frequency\n(HF) particle counts to low-frequency (LF) flux measurements. The methodology\nfollows four steps: (1) fit exponential curves to vertical profiles of\nsaltation flux from LF saltation traps, (2) determine empirical calibration\nfactors through comparison of LF exponential fits to HF number counts over\nconcurrent time intervals, (3) apply these calibration factors to subsamples of\nthe saltation count time series to obtain HF height-specific saltation fluxes,\nand (4) aggregate the calibrated HF height-specific saltation fluxes into\nestimates of total saltation fluxes. When coupled to high-frequency\nmeasurements of wind velocity, this methodology offers new opportunities for\nunderstanding how aeolian saltation dynamics respond to variability in driving\nwinds over time scales from tens of milliseconds to days.\n", "  One of the largest uncertainties in the Point Source (PS) studies, at\nFermi-LAT energies, is the uncertainty in the diffuse background. In general\nthere are two approaches for PS analysis: background-dependent methods, that\ninclude modeling of the diffuse background, and background-independent methods.\nIn this work we study PGWave, which is one of the background-independent\nmethods, based on wavelet filtering to find significant clusters of gamma rays.\nPGWave is already used in the Fermi-LAT catalog pipeline for finding candidate\nsources. We test PGWave, not only for source detection, but especially to\nestimate the flux without the need of a background model. We use Monte Carlo\n(MC) simulation to study the accuracy of PS detection and estimation of the\nflux. We present preliminary results of these MC studies.\n", "  We report on the characterization of near-ultraviolet high density silicon\nphotomultiplier (\\SiPM) developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (\\FBK) at\ncryogenic temperature. A dedicated setup was built to measure the primary dark\nnoise and correlated noise of the \\SiPMs\\ between 40 and 300~K. Moreover, an\nanalysis program and data acquisition system were developed to allow the\nprecise characterization of these parameters, some of which can vary up to 7\norders of magnitude between room temperature and 40~K. We demonstrate that it\nis possible to operate the \\FBK\\ near-ultraviolet high density \\SiPMs\\ at\ntemperatures lower than 100~K with a dark rate below 0.01 cps/mm$^2$ and total\ncorrelated noise probability below 35\\% at an over-voltage of 6~V. These\nresults are relevant for the development of future cryogenic particle detectors\nusing \\SiPMs\\ as photosensors.\n", "  A simple kinetic theory to exhibit a discontinuous shear thickening (DST) is\nproposed. The model includes the collision integral and the friction from\nenvironment as well as a thermostat term characterized by $T_{\\rm ex}$. The\nviscosity of this model is proportional to $\\dot\\gamma^2$ for large shear rate\n$\\dot\\gamma$, while it is Newtonian for low $\\dot\\gamma$. The emergence of the\nDST is enhanced for lower density and lower nonzero $T_{\\rm ex}$.\n", "  The inflationary universe can be viewed as a \"Cosmological Collider\" with\nenergy of Hubble scale, producing very massive particles and recording their\ncharacteristic signals in primordial non-Gaussianities. To utilize this\ncollider to explore any new physics at very high scales, it is a prerequisite\nto understand the background signals from the particle physics Standard Model.\nIn this paper we describe the Standard Model background of the Cosmological\nCollider.\n", "  Condensed matter systems can host quasiparticle excitations that are\nanalogues to elementary particles such as Majorana, Weyl, and Dirac fermions.\nRecent advances in band theory have expanded the classification of fermions in\ncrystals, and revealed crystal symmetry-protected electron excitations that\nhave no high-energy counterparts. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we demonstrate the existence of a triply degenerate point in the\nelectronic structure of MoP crystal, where the quasiparticle excitations are\nbeyond the Majorana-Weyl-Dirac classification. Furthermore, we observe pairs of\nWeyl points in the bulk electronic structure coexisting with the 'new\nfermions', thus introducing a platform for studying the interplay between\ndifferent types of fermions.\n", "  A new approach for a compact radio-frequency (RF) accelerator structure is\npresented. The new accelerator architecture is based on the Multiple\nElectrostatic Quadrupole Array Linear Accelerator (MEQALAC) structure that was\nfirst developed in the 1980s. The MEQALAC utilized RF resonators producing the\naccelerating fields and providing for higher beam currents through parallel\nbeamlets focused using arrays of electrostatic quadrupoles (ESQs). While the\nearly work obtained ESQs with lateral dimensions on the order of a few\ncentimeters, using printed circuits board (PCB), we reduce the characteristic\ndimension to the millimeter regime, while massively scaling up the potential\nnumber of parallel beamlets. Using Microelectromechanical systems scalable\nfabrication approaches, we are working on further reducing the characteristic\ndimension to the sub-millimeter regime. The technology is based on\nRF-acceleration components and ESQs implemented in PCB or silicon wafers where\neach beamlet passes through beam apertures in the wafer. The complete\naccelerator is then assembled by stacking these wafers. This approach has the\npotential for fast and inexpensive batch fabrication of the components and\nflexibility in system design for application specific beam energies and\ncurrents. For prototyping the accelerator architecture, the components have\nbeen fabricated using PCB. In this paper, we present proof of concept results\nof the principal components using PCB: RF acceleration and ESQ focusing.\nOngoing developments on implementing components in silicon and scaling of the\naccelerator technology to high currents and beam energies are discussed.\n", "  Quantum metrology offers a quadratic advantage over classical approaches to\nparameter estimation problems by utilizing entanglement and nonclassicality.\nHowever, the hurdle of actually implementing the necessary quantum probe states\nand measurements, which vary drastically for different metrological scenarios,\nis usually not taken into account. We show that for a wide range of tasks in\nmetrology, 2D cluster states (a particular family of states useful for\nmeasurement-based quantum computation) can serve as flexible resources that\nallow one to efficiently prepare any required state for sensing, and perform\nappropriate (entangled) measurements using only single qubit operations.\nCrucially, the overhead in the number of qubits is less than quadratic, thus\npreserving the quantum scaling advantage. This is ensured by using a\ncompression to a logarithmically sized space that contains all relevant\ninformation for sensing. We specifically demonstrate how our method can be used\nto obtain optimal scaling for phase and frequency estimation in local\nestimation problems, as well as for the Bayesian equivalents with Gaussian\npriors of varying widths. Furthermore, we show that in the paradigmatic case of\nlocal phase estimation 1D cluster states are sufficient for optimal state\npreparation and measurement.\n", "  Very few topological systems with long-range couplings have been considered\nso far due to our lack of analytic approaches. Here we extend the Kitaev chain,\na 1D quantum liquid, to infinite-range couplings and study its topological\nproperties. We demonstrate that, even though topological phases are intimately\nlinked to the notion of locality, the infinite-range couplings give rise to\ntopological zero and non-zero energy Majorana end modes depending on the\nboundary conditions of the system. We show that the analytically derived\nproperties are to a large degree stable against modifications to decaying\nlong-range couplings. Our work opens new frontiers for topological states of\nmatter that are relevant to current experiments where suitable interactions can\nbe designed.\n", "  The Casimir effect for {mass dimension one fermion fields (sometimes called\nElko)} in $3+1$ dimension is obtained using Dirichlet boundary conditions. It\nis shown the existence of a repulsive force four times greater than the case of\nthe scalar field. The precise reason for such differences are highlighted and\ninterpreted, as well as the right parallel of the Casimir effect due to scalar\nand fermionic fields.\n", "  Recent theoretical progress indicates that spacetime and gravity emerge\ntogether from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory.\nThese ideas are best understood in Anti-de Sitter space, where they rely on the\narea law for entanglement entropy. The extension to de Sitter space requires\ntaking into account the entropy and temperature associated with the\ncosmological horizon. Using insights from string theory, black hole physics and\nquantum information theory we argue that the positive dark energy leads to a\nthermal volume law contribution to the entropy that overtakes the area law\nprecisely at the cosmological horizon. Due to the competition between area and\nvolume law entanglement the microscopic de Sitter states do not thermalise at\nsub-Hubble scales: they exhibit memory effects in the form of an entropy\ndisplacement caused by matter. The emergent laws of gravity contain an\nadditional `dark' gravitational force describing the `elastic' response due to\nthe entropy displacement. We derive an estimate of the strength of this extra\nforce in terms of the baryonic mass, Newton's constant and the Hubble\nacceleration scale a_0 =cH_0, and provide evidence for the fact that this\nadditional `dark gravity~force' explains the observed phenomena in galaxies and\nclusters currently attributed to dark matter.\n", "  The spectral characteristics of near-field thermal emission from nanoparticle\narrays are explained by comparison to the dispersions for propagating modes.\nUsing the coupled dipole model, we analytically calculate the spectral emission\nfrom single particles, chains, planes, and 3D arrays of SiO2 and SiC. We show\nthat the differences in their spectra are due to the existence or absence of\npropagating surface phonon polariton modes and that the emission is dominated\nby these modes when they are present. This work paves the way for understanding\nand control of near-field radiation in nanofluids, nanoparticle beds, and\ncertain metamaterials.\n", "  We study the spectrum and entanglement of phonons produced by temporal\nchanges in homogeneous one-dimensional atomic condensates. To characterize the\nexperimentally accessible changes, we first consider the dynamics of the\ncondensate when varying the radial trapping frequency, separately studying two\nregimes: an adiabatic one and an oscillatory one. Working in momentum space, we\nthen show that in situ measurements of the density-density correlation function\ncan be used to assess the nonseparability of the phonon state after such\nchanges. We also study time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, paying particular\nattention to the role played by the adiabaticity of opening the trap on the\nnonseparability of the final state of atoms. In both cases, we emphasize that\ncommuting measurements can suffice to assess nonseparability. Some recent\nobservations are analyzed, and we make proposals for future experiments.\n", "  The present study was undertaken with the aim of contributing to the\ncharacterization of the nonstationary variability of the hydrological regime of\nthe Kasai River using the wavelet analysis for 1940-1999. The rainfalls and\ndischarge over Kasai Basin have marked fluctuations with a perceptible downward\ntrend and some shift around 1950, 1960, 1970, 1983 and 1994. The results show\nthat rainfalls over Kasai basin and the discharge at Ilebo station patterns\nexhibit a strong annual oscillation and some intermittent oscillations in 2-8\nyears (1950-1975, 1983-1995) and 8-16 years (1970-1999) time scales. The\nwavelet coherence analysis reveals a weak possible connection between\nhydrological variables (rainfalls, discharge) and climate indices relative to\nsea surface temperature and atmospheric circulation over Atlantic tropical,\nIndian and Pacific Oceans (coherence less than 0.55).\n", "  The validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture for the Kerr-Sen black hole,\nwhich is a solution to the low-energy effective field theory for\nfour-dimensional heterotic string theory, is investigated using charged\nparticle absorption. When the black hole absorbs the particle, the charge on it\nchanges owing to the conserved quantities of the particle. Changes in the black\nhole are constrained to the equation for the motion of the particle and are\nconsistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Particle absorption increases the\nmass of the Kerr-Sen black hole to more than that of the absorbed charges such\nas angular momentum and electric charge; hence, the black hole cannot be\novercharged. In the near-extremal black hole, we observe a violation of the\ncosmic censorship conjecture for the angular momentum in the first order of\nexpansion and the electric charge in the second order. However, considering an\nadiabatic process carrying the conserved quantities as those of the black hole,\nwe prove the stability of the black hole horizon. Thus, we resolve the\nviolation. This is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics.\n", "  We study the problem of sinking particles in a realistic oceanic flow, with\nmajor energetic structures in the mesoscale, focussing in the range of particle\nsizes and densities appropriate for marine biogenic particles. Our aim is to\nunify the theoretical investigations with its applications in the oceanographic\ncontext and considering a mesoscale simulation of the oceanic velocity field.\nBy using the equation of motion of small particles in a fluid flow, we assess\nthe influence of physical processes such as the Coriolis force and the inertia\nof the particles, and we conclude that they represent negligible corrections to\nthe most important terms, which are passive motion with the velocity of the\nflow, and a constant added vertical velocity due to gravity. Even if within\nthis approximation three-dimensional clustering of particles can not occur,\ntwo-dimensional cuts or projections of the evolving three-dimensional density\ncan display inhomogeneities similar to the ones observed in sinking ocean\nparticles.\n", "  We characterize the collective modes of a soliton train in a\nquasi-one-dimensional Fermi superfluid, using a mean-field formalism. In\naddition to the expected Goldstone and Higgs modes, we find novel long-lived\ngapped modes associated with oscillations of the soliton cores. The soliton\ntrain has an instability that depends strongly on the interaction strength and\nthe spacing of solitons. It can be stabilized by filling each soliton with an\nunpaired fermion, thus forming a commensurate Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\n(FFLO) phase. We find that such a state is always dynamically stable, which\npaves the way for realizing long-lived FFLO states in experiments via phase\nimprinting.\n", "  We consider wall-to-wall transport of a passive tracer by divergence-free\nvelocity vector fields $\\mathbf{u}$. Given an enstrophy budget $\\langle |\\nabla\n\\mathbf{u}|^{2} \\rangle \\le Pe^{2}$ we construct steady two-dimensional flows\nthat transport at rates $Nu(\\mathbf{u}) \\gtrsim Pe^{2/3}/(\\log Pe)^{4/3}$ in\nthe large enstrophy limit. Combined with the known upper bound\n$Nu(\\mathbf{u})\\lesssim Pe^{2/3}$ for any such enstrophy-constrained flow, we\nconclude that maximally transporting flows satisfy $Nu\\sim Pe^{2/3}$ up to\npossible logarithmic corrections. Combined with known transport bounds in the\ncontext of Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection this establishes that while suitable\nflows approaching the \"ultimate\" heat transport scaling $Nu\\sim Ra^{1/2}$\nexist, they are not always realizable as buoyancy-driven flows. The result is\nobtained by exploiting a connection between the wall-to-wall optimal transport\nproblem and a closely related class of singularly perturbed variational\nproblems arising in the study of energy-driven pattern formation in materials\nscience.\n", "  We analyze the spectral properties of large, time-lagged correlation matrices\nusing the tools of random matrix theory. We compare predictions of the\none-dimensional spectra, based on approaches already proposed in the\nliterature. Employing the methods of free random variables and diagrammatic\ntechniques, we solve a general random matrix problem, namely the spectrum of a\nmatrix $\\frac{1}{T}XAX^{\\dagger}$, where $X$ is an $N\\times T$ Gaussian random\nmatrix and $A$ is \\textit{any} $T\\times T$, not necessarily symmetric\n(Hermitian) matrix. As a particular application, we present the spectral\nfeatures of the large lagged correlation matrices as a function of the depth of\nthe time-lag. We also analyze the properties of left and right eigenvector\ncorrelations for the time-lagged matrices. We positively verify our results by\nthe numerical simulations.\n", "  Using Floquet-Bloch theory we study the effect of circularly and linearly\npolarized light on the electronic structure of (LaNiO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_N$\nheterostructure grown along the (111) direction. In equilibrium, a\ntight-binding fit to the first principles band structure shows that\nnearest-neighbor hopping plays a dominant role while second-neighbor hopping\nbreaks the particle-hole symmetry and determines the finer band features. The\nfour bands of the LaNiO$_3$ bilayer exhibit both quadratic band touching points\nand Dirac points. By varying the amplitude of the incident light, one can\nindependently tune the first and second-neighbor hopping for fixed frequency,\nwhich leads to considerable control over the Floquet band structure. We\ninvestigate this control in detail, and study how the quadratic and Dirac band\ntouchings are influenced by the polarization and intensity of the light. We\nderive effective 2-band Hamiltonians (for both quadratic and Dirac band\ntouching points) that accurately captures these results. We further study an\nextended model which explicitly includes oxygen $p$-orbitals and compare the\nresults to the effective model that contains only the nickel $d$-orbitals. We\nconclude with a computation of the frequency dependent optical Hall\nconductivity using the full four band model and analyze the various inter-band\ncontributions of the Floquet modes.\n", "  We investigate the ergodicity and \"hot solvent/cold solute\" problems in\nmolecular dynamics simulations. While the kinetic moments and the stimulated\nNos\\'e--Hoover methods improve the ergodicity of a harmonic-oscillator system,\nboth methods exhibit the \"hot solvent/cold solute\" problem in a binary liquid\nsystem. These results show that the devices to improve the ergodicity do not\nresolve the \"hot solvent/cold solute\" problem.\n", "  The probability of non-radiative transitions in photochemical dynamics is\ndetermined by the derivative couplings, the couplings between different\nelectronic states through the nuclear degrees of freedom. Efficient and\naccurate evaluation of the derivative couplings is, therefore, of central\nimportance to realize reliable computer simulations of photochemical reactions.\nIn this work, the derivative couplings for multistate multireference\nsecond-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2) and its 'extended' variant\n(XMS-CASPT2) are studied, in which we present an algorithm for their analytical\nevaluation. The computational costs for evaluating the derivative couplings are\nessentially the same as those for calculating the nuclear energy gradients. The\ngeometries and energies calculated with XMS-CASPT2 for small molecules at\nminimum energy conical intersections (MECIs) are in good agreement with those\ncomputed by multireference configuration interaction. As numerical examples,\nMECIs are optimized using XMS-CASPT2 for stilbene and a GFP model chromophore\n(the 4-para-hydroxybenzylidene-1,2-dimethyl-imidazolin-5-one anion).\n", "  We study model spaces, in the sense of Hairer, for stochastic partial\ndifferential equations involving the fractional Laplacian. We prove that the\nfractional Laplacian is a singular kernel suitable to apply the theory of\nregularity structures. Our main contribution is to study the dependence of the\nmodel space for a regularity structure on the three-parameter problem involving\nthe spatial dimension, the polynomial order of the nonlinearity, and the\nexponent of the fractional Laplacian. The goal is to investigate the growth of\nthe model space under parameter variation. In particular, we prove several\nresults in the approaching subcriticality limit leading to universal growth\nexponents of the regularity structure. A key role is played by the viewpoint\nthat model spaces can be identified with families of rooted trees. Our proofs\nare based upon a geometrical construction similar to Newton polygons for\nclassical Taylor series and various combinatorial arguments. We also present\nseveral explicit examples listing all elements with negative homogeneity by\nimplementing a new symbolic software package to work with regularity\nstructures. We use this package to illustrate our analytical results and to\nobtain new conjectures regarding coarse-grained network measures for model\nspaces.\n", "  We investigate the optical response of strongly disordered quantum Hall\nstates in two-dimensional Dirac materials and find qualitatively different\neffects in the radiation properties of the bulk versus the edge. We show that\nthe far-field radiation from the edge is characterized by large multipole\nmoments (> 50) due to the efficient transfer of angular momentum from the\nelectrons into the scattered light. The maximum multipole transition moment is\na direct measure of the coherence length of the edge states. Accessing these\nmultipole transitions would provide new tools for optical spectroscopy and\ncontrol of quantum Hall edge states. On the other hand, the far-field radiation\nfrom the bulk appears as random dipole emission with spectral properties that\nvary with the local disorder potential. We determine the conditions under which\nthis bulk radiation can be used to image the disorder landscape. Such optical\nmeasurements can probe sub-micron length scales over large areas and provide\ncomplementary information to scanning probe techniques. Spatially resolving\nthis bulk radiation would serve as a novel probe of the percolation transition\nnear half-filling.\n", "  In this article, we study the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ $QQ\\bar{Q}\\bar{Q}$\ntetraquark states with the QCD sum rules, and obtain the predictions\n$M_{X(cc\\bar{c}\\bar{c},0^{++})} =5.99\\pm0.08\\,\\rm{GeV}$,\n$M_{X(cc\\bar{c}\\bar{c},2^{++})} =6.09\\pm0.08\\,\\rm{GeV}$,\n$M_{X(bb\\bar{b}\\bar{b},0^{++})} =18.84\\pm0.09\\,\\rm{GeV}$ and\n$M_{X(bb\\bar{b}\\bar{b},2^{++})}=18.85\\pm0.09\\,\\rm{GeV}$, which can be\nconfronted to the experimental data in the future. Furthermore, we illustrate\nthat the diquark-antidiquark type tetraquark state can be taken as a special\nsuperposition of a series of meson-meson pairs and embodies the net effects.\n", "  A quantum critical system described at low energy by a conformal field theory\n(CFT) and subjected to a time-periodic boundary drive displays multiple\ndynamical regimes depending on the drive frequency. We compute the behavior of\nquantities including the entanglement entropy and Loschmidt echo, confirming\nanalytic predictions from field theory by exact numerics on the transverse\nfield Ising model, and demonstrate universality by adding non-integrable\nperturbations. The dynamics naturally separate into three regimes: a\nslow-driving limit, which has an interpretation as multiple quantum quenches\nwith amplitude corrections from CFT; a fast-driving limit, in which the system\nbehaves as though subject to a single quantum quench; and a crossover regime\ndisplaying heating. The universal Floquet dynamics in all regimes can be\nunderstood using a combination of boundary CFT and Kibble-Zurek scaling\narguments.\n", "  The production of K$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $\\phi(1020)$ mesons in proton-proton\n(pp) and lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} =$ 2.76 TeV has\nbeen analyzed using a high luminosity data sample accumulated in 2011 with the\nALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) spectra have been measured for K$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and\n$\\phi(1020)$ mesons via their hadronic decay channels for $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ up\nto 20 GeV/$c$. The measurements in pp collisions have been compared to model\ncalculations and used to determine the nuclear modification factor and particle\nratios. The K$^{*}(892)^{0}$/K ratio exhibits significant reduction from pp to\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions, consistent with the suppression of the\nK$^{*}(892)^{0}$ yield at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ due to rescattering of its decay\nproducts in the hadronic phase. In central Pb-Pb collisions the\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ dependent $\\phi(1020)/\\pi$ and K$^{*}(892)^{0}$/$\\pi$ ratios\nshow an enhancement over pp collisions for $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $\\sim$3 GeV/$c$,\nconsistent with previous observations of strong radial flow. At high\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, particle ratios in Pb-Pb collisions are similar to those\nmeasured in pp collisions. In central Pb-Pb collisions, the production of\nK$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $\\phi(1020)$ mesons is suppressed for $p_{\\mathrm{T}}> 8$\nGeV/$c$. This suppression is similar to that of charged pions, kaons and\nprotons, indicating that the suppression does not depend on particle mass or\nflavor in the light quark sector.\n", "  A theory of low-temperature phonon-drag magnetothermopower $S_{xx}^g$ is\npresented in graphene in a quantizing magnetic field. $S_{xx}^g$ is found to\nexhibit quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field $B$ and electron\nconcentration $n_e$. Amplitude of the oscillations is found to increase\n(decrease) with increasing $B$ ($n_e$). The behavior of $S_{xx}^g$ is also\ninvestigated as a function of temperature. A large value of $S_{xx}^g $($\\sim$\nfew hundreds of $\\mu $V/K) is predicted. Numerical values of $S_{xx}^g $ are\ncompared with the measured magnetothermopower $S_{xx}$ and the diffusion\ncomponent $S_{xx}^d$ from the modified Girvin-Jonson theory.\n", "  We study the elastic scattering of a planar wave in the curved spacetime of a\ncompact object such as a neutron star, via a heuristic model: a scalar field\nimpinging upon a spherically-symmetric uniform density star of radius $R$ and\nmass $M$. For $R < r_c$, there is a divergence in the deflection function at\nthe light-ring radius $r_c = 3GM/c^2$, which leads to spiral scattering\n(orbiting) and a backward glory; whereas for $R > r_c$ there instead arises a\nstationary point in the deflection function which creates a caustic and rainbow\nscattering. As in nuclear rainbow scattering, there is an Airy-type oscillation\non a Rutherford-like cross section, followed by a shadow zone. We show that,\nfor $R \\sim 3.5 GM/c^2$, the rainbow angle lies close to $180^\\circ$, and thus\nthere arises enhanced back-scattering and glory. We explore possible\nimplications for gravitational wave astronomy, and dark matter models.\n", "  A two-step, two-color laser spectroscopy technique has been used to measure\nthe hyperfine splittings of the $8p$ excited states in $^{203}$Tl and\n$^{205}$Tl, as well as the $7s - 8p$ transition isotope shifts. For the case of\nthe $8p_{3/2}$ state, our results show a hyperfine anomaly consistent with our\nrecent measurements of other hyperfine splittings, and in disagreement with\nolder results for this state. Our measurement of the $8p_{1/2}$ isotope shift\nis also in disagreement with earlier work. In this series of experiments, a UV\nlaser was locked to the first-step transition and directed through a heated\nvapor cell, while a second spatially overlapping red laser was scanned across\nthe two second-step transitions. To facilitate accurate frequency calibration,\nradio-frequency modulation of the second-step laser was used to create\nsidebands in the Doppler-free absorption spectrum.\n", "  A mixture of two kinds of identical bosons, species $1$ and species $2$, held\nin a harmonic potential and interacting by harmonic intra-species and\ninter-species particle-particle interactions is discussed. To prove\nBose-Einstein condensation of the mixture three steps are needed. First, we\nintegrate the all-particle density matrix, employing a four-parameter matrix\nrecurrence relations, down to the lowest-order intra-species and inter-species\nreduced density matrices of the mixture. Second, the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii\n(mean-field) equations of the mixture are solved analytically. Third, we\nanalyze the mixture's reduced density matrices in the limit of an infinite\nnumber of particles of both species $1$ and $2$ (when the interaction\nparameters, i.e., the products of the number of particles times the\nintra-species and inter-species interaction strengths, are held fixed) and\nprove that: (i) Both species $1$ and $2$ are 100\\% condensed; (ii) The\ninter-species reduced density matrix per particle is separable and given by the\nproduct of the intra-species reduced density matrices per particle; and (iii)\nThe mixture's energy per particle, and reduced density matrices and densities\nper particle all coincide with the Gross-Pitaevskii quantities. Finally, when\nthe infinite-particle limit is taken with respect to, say, species $1$ only\n(with interaction parameters held fixed) we prove that: (iv) Only species $1$\nis 100\\% condensed and its reduced density matrix and density per particle, as\nwell as the mixture's energy per particle, coincide with the Gross-Pitaevskii\nquantities of species $1$ alone; and (v) The inter-species reduced density\nmatrix per particle is nonetheless separable and given by the product of the\nintra-species reduced density matrices per particle.\n", "  This paper introduces an experimental apparatus, which drives turbulence\nelectrically in a liquid metal pervaded by a high magnetic field. Unlike past\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setups involving a shallow confinement, the\nexperiment presented here drives turbulence whose dimensionality can be set\nanywhere between three-dimensional and quasi two-dimensional. In particular, we\nshow that the dimensionality and componentality of the turbulence thus\ngenerated are in fact completely fixed by the single parameter lz(li)/h, which\nquantifies the competition between the solenoidal component of the Lorentz\nforce and inertia acting on a turbulent structure of the size of the forcing\nscale li. This parameter is fully tunable thanks to the three operating\nsettings at hand: the injection scale, the intensity of the electric forcing\nand the magnitude of the magnetic field. Thanks to the very high number of\nmeasuring probes and fast acquisition rate implemented in this experiment, it\nis possible to reliably measure the finest features of the inertial range on a\nscale-wise basis.\n", "  We present a mean-field theory describing the influence of long-range dipolar\nforces on the temperature transition from the paramagnetic to ordered phases in\nfrustrated Heisenberg spiral magnets. It is shown that the dipolar interaction\nproduces a cascade of first- and second- order phase transitions between the\nparamagnetic and the spiral states upon temperature decreasing. Depending on\nsystem parameters, the following intermediate phases can arise: an\nincommensurate and a commensurate sinusoidally modulated states, spiral phases\nin which perpendicular spin components have different amplitudes and are\nmodulated with the same and with different wave vectors. We distinguish six\npossible sequences of phase transitions upon temperature decreasing at least\nfour of which were observed before experimentally in specific compounds. It is\nfound that the action of dipolar forces cannot always be modeled even\nqualitatively by small one-ion anisotropic spin interactions. We demonstrate\nthat the dipolar interaction is responsible for successive phase transitions in\nthe triangular-lattice multiferroic MnI$_2$: almost all available experimental\nfindings are described quantitatively within the mean-field theory by taking\ninto account the exchange, the dipolar and small symmetry-allowed anisotropic\nspin interactions.\n", "  Dark matter capture and annihilation in the Sun can produce detectable\nhigh-energy neutrinos, providing a probe of the dark matter-proton scattering\ncross section. We consider the case when annihilation proceeds via long-lived\ndark mediators, which allows gamma rays to escape the Sun and reduces the\nattenuation of neutrinos. For gamma rays, there are exciting new opportunities,\ndue to detailed measurements of GeV solar gamma rays with Fermi, and\nunprecedented sensitivities in the TeV range with HAWC and LHAASO. For\nneutrinos, the enhanced flux, particularly at higher energies ($\\sim$TeV),\nallows a more sensitive dark matter search with IceCube and KM3NeT. We show\nthat these search channels can be extremely powerful, potentially improving\nsensitivity to the dark matter spin-dependent scattering cross section by\nseveral orders of magnitude relative to present searches for high-energy solar\nneutrinos, as well as direct detection experiments.\n", "  This work investigates the influence of directional properties of decoherence\non kinetics rate equations. The physical reality is understood as a chain of\nunitary and decoherence events. The former are quantum-deterministic, while the\nlatter introduce uncertainty and increase entropy. For interactions of matter\nand antimatter, two approaches are considered: symmetric decoherence, which\ncorresponds to conventional symmetric (CP-invariant) thermodynamics, and\nantisymmetric decoherence, which corresponds to antisymmetric (CPT-invariant)\nthermodynamics. Radiation, in its interactions with matter and antimatter, is\nshown to be decoherence-neutral. The symmetric and antisymmetric assumptions\nresult in different interactions of radiation with matter and antimatter. The\ntheoretical predictions for these differences are testable by comparing\nabsorption (emission) of light by thermodynamic systems made of matter and\nantimatter. Canonical typicality for quantum mixtures is briefly discussed in\nthe Appendix.\n", "  We present a technique to measure the amplitude of a center-of-mass (COM)\nmotion of a two-dimensional ion crystal of $\\sim$100 ions. By sensing motion at\nfrequencies far from the COM resonance frequency, we experimentally determine\nthe technique's measurement imprecision. We resolve amplitudes as small as 50\npm, 40 times smaller than the COM mode zero-point fluctuations. The technique\nemploys a spin-dependent, optical-dipole force to couple the mechanical\noscillation to the electron spins of the trapped ions, enabling a measurement\nof one quadrature of the COM motion through a readout of the spin state. We\ndemonstrate sensitivity limits set by spin projection noise and spin\ndecoherence due to off-resonant light scattering. When performed on resonance\nwith the COM mode frequency, the technique demonstrated here can enable the\ndetection of extremely weak forces ($< \\,$1 yN) and electric fields ($< \\,$1\nnV/m), providing an opportunity to probe quantum sensing limits and search for\nphysics beyond the standard model.\n", "  In this work we study the radiative decay widths of vector quarkonia for the\nprocess of $J/\\psi(nS)\\rightarrow\\eta_{c}(nS)\\gamma$ and\n$\\Upsilon(nS)\\rightarrow\\eta_{b}(nS)\\gamma$ (for principal quantum numbers\n$n=1, 2, 3$) in the framework of Bethe-Salpeter equation under the covariant\ninstantaneous ansatz using a $4\\times 4$ form of BSE. The parameters of the\nframework were determined by a fit to the mass spectrum of ground states of\npseudoscalar and vector quarkonia, such as; $\\eta_{c}$, $\\eta_{b}$, $J/\\psi$\nand $\\Upsilon$. These input parameters so fixed were found to give good\nagreements with data on mass spectra of ground and excited states of\npseudoscalar and vector quarkonia, leptonic decay constants of pseudoscalar and\nvector quarkonia, two photon decays and two gluon decays of pseudoscalar\nquarkonia in our recent paper. With these input parameters so fixed, the\nradiative decay widths of ground (1S) and excited (2S, 3S) states of heavy\nvector quarkonia ($J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$) are calculated and found to be in\nreasonable agreement with data.\n", "  We analyse the environmental properties of 370 local early-type galaxies\n(ETGs) in the MASSIVE and ATLAS3D surveys, two complementary volume-limited\nintegral-field spectroscopic (IFS) galaxy surveys spanning absolute $K$-band\nmagnitude $-21.5 > M_K > -26.6$, or stellar mass $8 \\times 10^{9} < M_* < 2\n\\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$. We find these galaxies to reside in a diverse range of\nenvironments measured by four methods: group membership (whether a galaxy is a\nbrightest group/cluster galaxy, satellite, or isolated), halo mass, large-scale\nmass density (measured over a few Mpc), and local mass density (measured within\nthe $N$th neighbour). The spatially resolved IFS stellar kinematics provide\nrobust measurements of the spin parameter $\\lambda_e$ and enable us to examine\nthe relationship among $\\lambda_e$, $M_*$, and galaxy environment. We find a\nstrong correlation between $\\lambda_e$ and $M_*$, where the average $\\lambda_e$\ndecreases from $\\sim 0.4$ to below 0.1 with increasing mass, and the fraction\nof slow rotators $f_{\\rm slow}$ increases from $\\sim 10$% to 90%. We show for\nthe first time that at fixed $M_*$, there are almost no trends between galaxy\nspin and environment; the apparent kinematic morphology-density relation for\nETGs is therefore primarily driven by $M_*$ and is accounted for by the joint\ncorrelations between $M_*$ and spin, and between $M_*$ and environment. A\npossible exception is that the increased $f_{\\rm slow}$ at high local density\nis slightly more than expected based only on these joint correlations. Our\nresults suggest that the physical processes responsible for building up the\npresent-day stellar masses of massive galaxies are also very efficient at\nreducing their spin, in any environment.\n", "  We present a family of superintegrable (SI) sytems living on a riemannian\nsurface of revolution and which exhibits one linear integral and two integrals\nof any integer degree larger or equal to 2 in the momenta. When this degree is\n2 one recovers a metric due to Koenigs. The local structure of these systems is\nunder control of a linear ordinary differential equation of order n which is\nhomogeneous for even integrals and weakly inhomogeneous for odd integrals. The\nform of the integrals is explicitly given in the so-called simple case (see\ndefinition 2). Some globally defined examples are worked out which live either\nin H2 or in R2.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the modification of specific nonclassical\nproperties of the nonlinear coherent state on sphere upon perpendicular\npropagation through an absorptive and dispersive dielectric slab at finite\ntemperature. For this purpose, by describing the dielectric dispersion of the\nslab by Lorentz model, the quadrature squeezing and the Mandel parameter are\nevaluated for the transmitted state. A generalization of single-mode nonlinear\ncoherent state to the continuum-mode is considered. The degree of second-order\ncoherence is instead calculated for a continuum nonlinear coherent state on\nsphere, and the quantum noise effects produced by transmission through the slab\non the antibunching feature are examined. We find that near the medium\nresonance the detrimental effect of the loss and thermal fluctuations of the\nslab are not compensate with increasing the physical space curvature of the\nincident state.\n", "  We study the evolution of the eccentricity and inclination of protoplanetary\nembryos and low-mass protoplanets (from a fraction of an Earth mass to a few\nEarth masses) embedded in a protoplanetary disc, by means of three dimensional\nhydrodynamics calculations with radiative transfer in the diffusion limit. When\nthe protoplanets radiate in the surrounding disc the energy released by the\naccretion of solids, their eccentricity and inclination experience a growth\ntoward values which depend on the luminosity to mass ratio of the planet, which\nare comparable to the disc's aspect ratio and which are reached over timescales\nof a few thousand years. This growth is triggered by the appearance of a hot,\nunder-dense region in the vicinity of the planet. The growth rate of the\neccentricity is typically three times larger than that of the inclination. In\nlong term calculations, we find that the excitation of eccentricity and the\nexcitation of inclination are not independent. In the particular case in which\na planet has initially a very small eccentricity and inclination, the\neccentricity largely overruns the inclination. When the eccentricity reaches\nits asymptotic value, the growth of inclination is quenched, yielding an\neccentric orbit with a very low inclination. As a side result, we find that the\neccentricity and inclination of non-luminous planets are damped more vigorously\nin radiative discs than in isothermal discs.\n", "  The first searches for axions and axion-like particles with the Large\nUnderground Xenon (LUX) experiment are presented. Under the assumption of an\naxio-electric interaction in xenon, the coupling constant between axions and\nelectrons, gAe is tested, using data collected in 2013 with an exposure\ntotalling 95 live-days $\\times$ 118 kg. A double-sided, profile likelihood\nratio statistic test excludes gAe larger than 3.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-12}$ (90%\nC.L.) for solar axions. Assuming the DFSZ theoretical description, the upper\nlimit in coupling corresponds to an upper limit on axion mass of 0.12\neV/c$^{2}$, while for the KSVZ description masses above 36.6 eV/c$^{2}$ are\nexcluded. For galactic axion-like particles, values of gAe larger than 4.2\n$\\times$ 10$^{-13}$ are excluded for particle masses in the range 1-16\nkeV/c$^{2}$. These are the most stringent constraints to date for these\ninteractions.\n", "  We have developed a Hartree-Fock theory for electrons on a honeycomb lattice\naiming to solve a long-standing problem of the Fermi velocity renormalization\nin graphene. Our model employs no fitting parameters (like an unknown band\ncutoff) but relies on a topological invariant (crystal structure function) that\nmakes the Hartree-Fock sublattice spinor independent of the electron-electron\ninteraction. Agreement with the experimental data is obtained assuming static\nself-screening including local field effects. As an application of the model,\nwe derive an explicit expression for the optical conductivity and discuss the\nrenormalization of the Drude weight. The optical conductivity is also obtained\nvia precise quantum Monte Carlo calculations which compares well to our\nmean-field approach.\n", "  In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the low energy optical\nmagnetic response of the skyrmionic Mott insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ via high\nresolution time-domain THz spectroscopy. In zero field, a new magnetic\nexcitation not predicted by spin-wave theory with frequency $f$ = 2.03 THz is\nobserved and shown, with accompanying time-of-flight neutron scattering\nexperiments, to be a zone folded magnon from the $\\mathrm{R}$ to\n$\\mathrm{\\Gamma}$ points of the Brillouin zone. Highly sensitive polarimetry\nexperiments performed in weak magnetic fields, $\\mu_0$H $<$ 200 mT, observe\nFaraday and Kerr rotations which are proportional to the sample magnetization,\nallowing for optical detection of the skyrmion phase and construction of a\nmagnetic phase diagram. From these measurements, we extract a critical exponent\nof $\\beta$ = 0.35 $\\pm$ 0.04, in good agreement with the expected value for the\n3D Heisenberg universality class of $\\beta$ = 0.367. In large magnetic fields,\n$\\mu_0$H $>$ 5 T, we observe the magnetically active uniform mode of the\nferrimagnetic field polarized phase whose dynamics as a function of field and\ntemperature are studied. In addition to extracting a $g_\\text{eff}$ = 2.08\n$\\pm$ 0.03, we observe the uniform mode to decay through a non-Gilbert damping\nmechanism and to possesses a finite spontaneous decay rate, $\\Gamma_0$\n$\\approx$ 25 GHz, in the zero temperature limit. Our observations are\nattributed to Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interactions, which have been proposed to be\nexceptionally strong in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ and are expected to impact the low\nenergy magnetic response of such chiral magnets.\n", "  A crucial building block of the ghost free massive gravity is the square root\nfunction of a matrix. This is a problematic entity from the viewpoint of\nexistence and uniqueness properties. We accurately describe the freedom of\nchoosing a square root of a (non-degenerate) matrix. It has discrete and (in\nspecial cases) continuous parts. When continuous freedom is present, the usual\nperturbation theory in terms of matrices can be critically ill defined for some\nchoices of the square root. We consider the new formulation of massive and\nbimetric gravity which deals directly with eigenvalues (in disguise of\nelementary symmetric polynomials) instead of matrices. It allows for a\nmeaningful discussion of perturbation theory in such cases, even though certain\nnon-analytic features arise.\n", "  Conjugated system have complex behaviors when increasing the number of\nmonomers, which is one of the reasons that makes long oligomers hard to be\ncharacterized by numerical methods. An ex- ample of this are fused-azulene, a\nmolecule that has been reported to displays an increasing magnetic moment with\nsystem size. A similar system composed of symmetric fused-benzene rings is\nreported to be always no magnetic. Instead of the empiric parametrized\nPariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian, a standard model for conjugated\nmolecules, we consider the Hubbard Hamiltonian to explore a range of low\nelectronic correlation by means of perturbation theory (PT). We show that a\nsimple second-order perturbation treatment of electronic correlations by means\nof Rayleigh-Schroedinger PT allow to accurately infer about the magnetic state\nof these long complex {\\pi}-conjugated molecules. For fused-azulene our results\nsupports the hypothesis that the high-spin ground state on azulene oligomers\ncomes from the frustrated geometry of these chains. We validate this approach\nusing Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations. Our procedure\nprocedure could be helpful to describe the magnetic ground state of a larger\nset of conjugated molecules.\n", "  The impact parameter (b) dependence on the saturation scale, in the framework\nof the Color Glass Condensate (b-CGC) dipole model, is investigated from the\nconfigurational point of view. During the calculations and analysis of the\nquantum nuclear states, the critical points of stability in the configurational\nentropy setup are computed, matching the experimental parameters that define\nthe onset of the quantum regime in the b-CGC in the literature with very good\naccuracy. This new approach is crucial and important for understanding the\nstability of quantum systems in study of deep inelastic scattering processes.\n", "  We propose an efficient stepwise adiabatic merging (SAM) method to generate\nmany-body singlet states in antiferromagnetic spin-1 bosons in concatenated\noptical superlattices with isolated double-well arrays, by adiabatically\nramping up the double-well bias. With an appropriate choice of bias sweeping\nrate and magnetic field, the SAM protocol predicts a fidelity as high as 90%\nfor a sixteen-body singlet state and even higher fidelities for smaller\neven-body singlet states. During their evolution, the spin-1 bosons exhibit\ninteresting squeezing dynamics, manifested by an odd-even oscillation of the\nexperimentally observable squeezing parameter. The generated many-body singlet\nstates may find practical applications in precision measurement of magnetic\nfield gradient and in quantum information processing.\n", "  Inspired by the recent developments in the research of atom-photon quantum\ninterface and energy-time entanglement between single photon pulses, we propose\nto establish the concept of a special energy-time entanglement between a single\nphoton pulse and internal states of a single atom, which is analogous to the\nfrequency-bin entanglement between single photon pulses. We show that this type\nof entanglement arises naturally in the interaction between frequency-bin\nentangled single photon pulse pair and a single atom, via straightforward\natom-photon phase gate operations. We also discuss the properties of this type\nof entanglement and show a preliminary example of its potential application in\nquantum networking. Moreover, a quantum entanglement witness is constructed to\ndetect such entanglement from a reasonably large set of separable states.\n", "  The phase diagram of LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_x$O system has been extensively studied\nthrough hole- and electron-doping as well as As/P-substitution. It has been\nrevealed that there are three different superconducting phases with different\nFermi surface (FS) topologies and thus with possibly different pairing glues.\nOne of them is well understood as spin fluctuation-mediated superconductivity\nwithin a FS nesting scenario. Another one with the FSs in a bad nesting\ncondition must be explained in a different context such as orbital or spin\nfluctuation in strongly correlated electronic system. In both phases,\n$T$-linear resistivity was commonly observed when the superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ becomes the highest value, indicating that\nthe strength of bosonic fluctuation determines $T_{\\rm c}$. In the last\nsuperconducting phase, the nesting condition of FSs and the related bosonic\nfluctuation are moderate. Variety of phase diagram characterizes the multiple\norbital nature of the iron-based superconductors which are just near the\nboundary between weak and strong correlation regimes.\n", "  Tight-binding model on a finite chain is studied with four-fold alternated\nhopping parameters $t_{1,2,3,4}$. Imposing the open boundary conditions, the\ncorresponding recursion is solved analytically with special attention paid to\nthe occurrence of edge states. Corresponding results are strongly corroborated\nby numeric calculations. It is shown that in the system there exist four\ndifferent edge phases if the number of sites is odd, and eight edges phases if\nthe chain comprises even number of sites. Phases are labelled by\n$\\sigma_1\\equiv{\\rm sgn}(t_1t_3-t_2t_4)$, $\\sigma_2\\equiv{\\rm\nsgn}(t_1t_4-t_2t_3)$ and $\\sigma_3\\equiv{\\rm sgn}(t_1t_2-t_3t_4)$. It is shown\nthat these quantities represent gauge invariant topological indices emerging in\nthe corresponding infinite chains.\n", "  To fulfil both size and power requirements for future photonic integrated\ncircuits, an effective approach is to miniaturize photonic components. Surface\nplasmon polariton (SPP) is one of the most promising candidates for\nsubwavelength mode confinement, however, structures based on SPP are subject to\ninevitable high propagation loss. Here, we report an all-dielectric bowtie\n(ADB) waveguide consisting of two identical silicon wedges embedded in a silica\ncladding with a nanoscale gap. Because of successive slot and antislot effects,\nthe gap behaves as a 'capacitor-like' energy storage that makes the ADB\nwaveguide have similar or even smaller mode area than the hybrid plasmonic\nwaveguides recently reported. What is more important is that the ADB waveguide\nsupports a quasi-TM eigenmode, which is lossless fundamentally because of no\nmetal constituent. This makes our ADB waveguide have essential development in\npropagation length compared with the plasmonic waveguide. The ADB waveguide is\nfully compatible with semiconductor fabrication techniques and could give rise\nto truly nanoscale semiconductor-based photonics.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to explore the possibility space of scenarios of\n'contact'--the discovery of extra-terrestrial life, whether intelligent or\nnot--using a morphological approach utilising seven principal parameters,\nchosen both for their descriptiveness of the scope of possibilities, as well as\nfor their relevance in examining potential societal impacts arising from\ndifferent scenarios, including, for example, the proximity of the discovery.\nSeveral classes of contact scenario are examined, and existing approaches to\nthe search for extra-terrestrial life and intelligence are situated within the\nrange of possible search strategies and targets illuminated by this particular\nchoice of parameters, as are some examples of contact scenarios from popular\nculture. The resulting possibility space can also suggest new search strategies\nand potential targets, one of which is highlighted--that of 'galaxy-scale\nmacro-engineering'. It is hypothesised that an example of this might already be\nknown to us, namely the intriguing galaxy 'Hoag's Object' (PGC54559), and some\nspecific empirical observations are suggested in order to test this hypothesis.\nSome possible extensions to the parameters used, as well as some preliminary\nobservations about modelling the range and extent of human societal responses\nto contact, are also made.\n", "  The path towards the production of \\textit{r}-process seed nuclei follows a\ncourse where the neutron-rich light and medium mass nuclei play a crucial role.\nThe neutron capture rates for these exotic nuclei could dominate over their\n$\\alpha$-capture rates, thereby enhancing their abundances at or near the drip\nline. We calculate the radiative neutron capture cross-section for the\n$^{33}$Na(n,$\\gamma)^{34}$Na reaction via the Coulomb dissociation of $^{34}$Na\nas it undergoes elastic breakup on $^{208}$Pb when directed at a beam energy of\n100 MeV/u using the entirely quantum mechanical theory of finite range\ndistorted wave Born approximation upgraded to incorporate deformation effects.\nThe non-resonant one neutron radiative capture cross-section for\n$^{33}$Na(n,$\\gamma)^{34}$Na is calculated and is found to increase with\nincreasing deformation of $^{34}$Na. An analytic scrutiny of the capture\ncross-section with neutron separation energy as a parameter is also done at\ndifferent energy ranges. The calculated reaction rate is compared with the rate\nof the $^{33}$Na($\\alpha$,n)$^{36}$Al reaction (deduced from the\nHauser-Feshbach theory), and is found to be significantly higher below a\ntemperature of $T_9 = 2$. Further, at the equilibrium temperature of $T_9 =\n0.62$, the rate for the neutron capture had a small but non-negligible\ndependence on the structural parameters of $^{34}$Na. In addition, this neutron\ncapture rate exceeded that of the $\\alpha$-capture reaction by orders of\nmagnitude, indicating that the $\\alpha$-process should not break the\n(n,$\\gamma$) \\textit{r-}process path at the $^{33}$Na isotope, thus,\neffectively pushing the abundance of sodium isotopes towards the neutron drip\nline.\n", "  We report the results of theoretical and experimental studies of\nphotoluminescence of silicon nanocrystals in the proximity of plasmonic modes\nof different types. In our samples, the type of plasmonic mode is determined by\nthe filling ratio of a one-dimensional gold grating which covers the thin film\nwith silicon nanocrystals on a quartz substrate. We analyze the extinction and\nphotoluminesce spectra of silicon nanocrystals and show that the emitted light\nis coupled to the corresponding plasmonic mode. We also demonstrate the\nmodification of the extinction and photoluminesce spectra under the transition\nfrom surface plasmon-polaritons to waveguide plasmon-polaritons with the\ndecrease of the gold filling ratio from 1 to 0.35. Finally, we analyze the\ncontribution of individual silicon nanocrystals to the overall\nphotoluminescence intensity. We conclude that silicon nanocrystals ensemble can\nbe broken down into optically bright and optically dark nanocrystals. The\nexperimental extinction and photoluminescence spectra are in good agreement\nwith theoretical calculations performed by the Fourier modal method in the\nscattering matrix form.\n", "  This manual accompanies the release of the particle data for 24 simulations\nof the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy\nformation by the virgo consortium. It describes how to download these snapshots\nand how to extract datasets from them, emphasising the meaning of variables,\nand their units. We provide examples for extracting the particle data in\npython. This data release complements our earlier release of numerous\nintegrated properties of the galaxies in EAGLE through an SQL relational\ndatabase. This database has been updated to include the additional simulations\nthat are part of the present data release. Scientists wanting to use EAGLE may\nfind it useful to first investigate whether their analysis can be performed\nusing the database, before accessing the particle data. The particles in the\nsnapshot files are indexed by a peano-hilbert key. This allows for an eased\nextraction of simply connected spatial volumes, without needing to read the\nentire snapshot. This makes it possible to analyse many aspects of galaxies\nusing modest computing resources, even when using EAGLE simulations with large\nnumbers of particles. A reading routine is provided to simplify this process.\n", "  We have conducted two-component, non-LTE modeling of the CO lines from J =\n1-0 through J = 13-12 in 87 galaxies observed by the Herschel SPIRE Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer (FTS). We find the average pressure of the cold\nmolecular gas, traced especially by CO J = 1-0, is $\\sim 10^{5.0 \\pm 0.5}$ K\ncm$^{-3}$. The mid- to high-J lines of CO trace higher-pressure gas at $10^{6.5\n\\pm 0.6}$ K cm$^{-3}$; this pressure is slightly correlated with LFIR. Two\ncomponents are often necessary to accurately fit the Spectral Line Energy\nDistributions (SLEDs); a one-component fit often underestimates the flux of CO\nJ = 1-0 and the mass. If low-J lines are not included, mass is underestimated\nby an order of magnitude. Even when modeling the low-J lines alone or using an\n$\\alpha_{CO}$ conversion factor, the mass should be considered to be uncertain\nto a factor of at least 0.4 dex, and the vast majority of the CO luminosity\nwill be missed (median, 65%). We find a very large spread in our derived values\nof $\\alpha_{CO}$, though they do not have a discernible trend with LFIR; the\nbest fit is a constant 0.7 M$_{\\odot}$/ (K kms$^{-1}$ pc$^2$), with a standard\ndeviation of 0.36 dex, and a range of 0.3-1.6 M$_{\\odot}$/ (K kms$^{-1}$\npc$^2$). We find average molecular gas depletion times ($\\tau_{dep}$) of $10^8$\nyr that decrease with increasing SFR. Finally, we note that the J = 11-10/J =\n1-0 line flux ratio is diagnostic of the warm component pressure, and discuss\nthe implications of this comprehensive study of SPIRE FTS extragalactic spectra\nfor future study post-Herschel.\n", "  We model vortex dynamics in a 2-dimensional Bose superfluid using the\nThompson-Stamp (TS) equations of motion, which describes both the classical\nHall-Vinen-Iordanskii (HVI) dynamical regime and the fully developed quantum\nregime, and the crossover between them. The TS equations can be written in the\nform of a quantum Langevin equation. Analytic solutions are given for all of\nthese regimes for a single vortex in a 2-dimensional system. In the classical\nregime we include the vortex inertial and Langevin noise terms, which are\ndropped in the usual HVI analysis. In the quantum and crossover regimes the\neffect of memory terms is important, and leads to clear differences from the\nclassical predictions.\n", "  We show that a two-level non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with constant off-diagonal\nexchange elements can be analyzed exactly when the underlying exceptional point\nis perfectly encircled in the complex plane. The state evolution of this system\nis explicitly obtained in terms of an ensuing transfer matrix, even for large\nencirclements, regardless of adiabatic conditions. Our results clearly explain\nthe direction-dependent nature of this process and why in the adiabatic limit\nits outcome is dominated by a specific eigenstate irrespective of initial\nconditions. Moreover, numerical simulations suggest that this mechanism can\nstill persist in the presence of nonlinear effects. We further show that this\nrobust process can be harnessed to realize an optical omni-polarizer: a\nconfiguration that generates a desired polarization output regardless of the\ninput polarization state, while from the opposite direction it always produces\nthe counterpart eigenstate.\n", "  Lightcurve analysis of the asteroid 9021 Fagus observed at the Bulgarian\nNational Astronomical Observatory Rozhen during two apparitions in 2013 and\n2017 are presented. This asteroid was observed in 2013 accidentally in the\nfield of view in which our long-term target asteroid 901 Brunsia was\npositioned. A search of the Asteroid Lightcurve Database (Warner et al. 2009)\ndid not find any previously reported results for the rotation period of 9021\nFagus. Unfortunately two nights observations in 2013 showed that the rotation\nperiod could be only approximately assumed. The observations during two\nneighbouring nights in 2017 March 20 and 21 revealed the period of $5.065 \\pm\n0.002$ h with amplitude of $0.73\\pm0.02$ mag. Obtained lightcurves in\ncombination with other observational techniques, as well as with data gathered\nfrom future space mission will contribute to the enlargement of the database\nfor rotational characteristics of the asteroids.\n", "  No high-resolution canopy height map exists for global mangroves. Here we\npresent the first global mangrove height map at a consistent 30 m pixel\nresolution derived from digital elevation model data collected through shuttle\nradar topography mission. Additionally, we refined the current global mangrove\narea maps by discarding the non-mangrove areas that are included in current\nmangrove maps.\n", "  In 2016, the Department of Physics at Oregon State University began a process\nto revise our Paradigms in Physics curriculum for physics majors. We began with\na colloquium to inform the department of our plans and request their\nassistance, followed by a survey of students and faculty as well as individual\ninterviews with the faculty teaching each course. As we developed a plan to\naddress student- and faculty-identified challenges in the curriculum, we met\nwith each faculty member individually to explain and refine our proposal, which\nwas unanimously approved by the faculty. Major changes include major changes to\nseveral courses (math methods, computational physics, modern physics,\nelectronics, and classical mechanics), including the introduction of two\nsophomore-year courses designed specifically to help prepare students for their\nupper-division courses.\n", "  We study the ground state energy and the critical screening parameter of the\nYukawa potential in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After a short review of\nthe existing literature on these quantities, we apply fifth-order perturbation\ntheory to the calculation of the ground state energy, using the exact solutions\nof the Coulomb potential together with a cutoff on the principal number\nsummations. We also perform a variational calculation of the ground state\nenergy using a Coulomb-like radial wave function and the exact solution of the\ncorresponding minimization condition. For not too large values of the screening\nparameter, close agreement is found between the perturbative and variational\nresults. For the critical screening parameter, we devise a novel method that\npermits us to determine it to ten digits. This is the most precise calculation\nof this quantity to date, and allows us to resolve some discrepancies between\nprevious results.\n", "  The notion of lasing with biologics has recently been realized and has since\nrapidly developed with the collective objective of creating lasers $\\textit{in\nvivo}$. One limitation of achieving this goal is the requirement of exogenous\nlaser dyes and fluorescent materials. To circumvent this, we investigate the\nuse of cell-endogenous fluorophores - sources of cell autofluorescence - as\nlaser gain material. In this work, we study the lasing potential and efficiency\nof flavins and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H)\nusing a dye lasing model based on coupled rate equations. Analytical solutions\nfor one- and two-photon pumped system were used in multi-parameter studies. We\nfound that at physiological conditions, lasing can be supported by NAD(P)H with\ncavity quality factors of $10^5$. With the further consideration of damage\nthresholds, we recommend the use of flavins as they entail lower threshold\nrequirements. We then identify potential parameters for engineering to make the\nlasing of flavins feasible even at their low physiological intracellular\nconcentrations. We also note the higher threshold requirements and lower\nefficiencies of two-photon pumping, but recognize its potential for realizing\nlasing $\\textit{in vivo}$.\n", "  We calculate to next-to-leading order accuracy the high-energy elastic\nscattering cross section for an electron off of a classical point source. We\nuse the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme to tame the ultraviolet\ndivergences while the infrared singularities are dealt with using the well\nknown Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem. We show for the first time how to\ncorrectly apply the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem diagrammatically in a\nnext-to-leading order scattering process. We improve on previous works by\nincluding all initial and final state soft radiative processes, including\nabsorption and an infinite sum of partially disconnected amplitudes. Crucially,\nwe exploit the Monotone Convergence Theorem to prove that our delicate\nrearrangement of this formally divergent series is uniquely correct. This\nrearrangement yields a factorization of the infinite contribution from the\ninitial state soft photons that then cancels in the physically observable cross\nsection. Since we use the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme, our\nresult is valid up to arbitrarily large momentum transfers between the source\nand the scattered electron as long as $\\alpha \\log(1/\\delta)\\ll 1$ and $\\alpha\n\\log(1/\\delta)\\log(\\Delta/E)\\ll 1$, where $\\Delta$ and $\\delta$ are the\nexperimental energy and angular resolutions, respectively, and $E$ is the\nenergy of the scattered electron. Our work aims at computing the NLO\ncorrections to the energy loss of a high energetic parton propagating in a\nquark-gluon plasma.\n", "  Multiparticle interference is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of\nquantum mechanics.It was discovered in a recent experiment [Ra, Y.-S. et al,\nProc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA \\textbf{110}, 1227(2013)] that spectrally\nuncorrelated biphotons exhibited a nonmonotonic quantum-to-classical transition\nin a four-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference. In this work, we consider\nthe same scheme with spectrally correlated photons.By theoretical calculation\nand numerical simulation, we found the transition not only can be nonmonotonic\nwith negative-correlated or uncorrelated biphotons, but also can be monotonic\nwith positive-correlated biphotons. The fundamental reason for this difference\nis that the HOM-type multi-photon interference is a differential-frequency\ninterference. Our study may shed new light on understanding the role of\nfrequency entanglement in multi-photon behavior.\n", "  We considered one-dimensional quantum chains of two-level Fermi particles\ncoupled via the tunneling driven both by ac and dc fields in the regimes of\nstrong and ultrastrong coupling. The frequency of ac field is matched with the\nfrequency of the quantum transition. Based on the fundamental principles of\nelectrodynamics and quantum theory, we developed a general model of quantum\ndynamics for such interactions. We showed that the joint action of ac and dc\nfields leads to the strong mutual influence of Rabi- and Bloch oscillations one\nto another. We focused on the regime of ultrastrong coupling, for which Bloch-\nand Rabi-frequencies are a significant values of the frequency of interband\ntransition. The Hamiltonian was solved numerically with account of\nanti-resonant terms. It manifests by the appearance of great number of narrow\nhigh-amplitude resonant lines in the spectra of tunneling current and dipole\nmoment. We proposed the new concept of THz spectroscopy promising for different\napplications in future nanoelectronics and nano-photonics.\n", "  Directed assembly of colloids is an exciting field in materials science to\nform structures with new symmetries and responses. Fluid interfaces have been\nwidely exploited to make densely packed ordered structures. We have been\nstudying how interface curvature can be used in new ways to guide structure\nformation. On a fluid interface, the area of the deformation field around\nadsorbed microparticles depends on interface curvature; particles move to\nminimize the excess area of the distortions that they make in the interface.\nFor particles that are sufficiently small, this area decreases as particles\nmove along principle axes to sites of high deviatoric curvature. We have\nstudied this migration for microparticles on a curved host interface with zero\nmean curvature created by pinning an oil-water interface around a micropost.\nHere, on a similar interface, we demonstrate capillary curvature repulsion,\nthat is, we identify conditions in which microparticles migrate away from high\ncurvature sites. Using theory and experiment, we discuss the origin of these\ninteractions and their relationship to the particle's undulated contact line.\nWe discuss the implications of this new type of interaction in various contexts\nfrom materials science to microrobotics.\n", "  Hybridized molecule/metal interfaces are ubiquitous in molecular and organic\ndevices. The energy level alignment (ELA) of frontier molecular levels relative\nto the metal Fermi level (EF) is critical to the conductance and functionality\nof these devices. However, a clear understanding of the ELA that includes\nmany-electron self-energy effects is lacking. Here, we investigate the\nmany-electron effects on the ELA using state-of-the-art, benchmark GW\ncalculations on prototypical chemisorbed molecules on Au(111), in eleven\ndifferent geometries. The GW ELA is in good agreement with photoemission for\nmonolayers of benzene-diamine on Au(111). We find that in addition to static\nimage charge screening, the frontier levels in most of these geometries are\nrenormalized by additional screening from substrate-mediated intermolecular\nCoulomb interactions. For weakly chemisorbed systems, such as amines and\npyridines on Au, this additional level renormalization (~1.5 eV) comes solely\nfrom static screened exchange energy, allowing us to suggest computationally\nmore tractable schemes to predict the ELA at such interfaces. However, for more\nstrongly chemisorbed thiolate layers, dynamical effects are present. Our ab\ninitio results constitute an important step towards the understanding and\nmanipulation of functional molecular/organic systems for both fundamental\nstudies and applications.\n", "  We study rare leptonic decays of vector $B$ mesons in the scalar leptoquark\nand family non-universal $Z^\\prime$ models. We constrain these new couplings by\nusing the measured branching fractions of $B_{s,d} \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ processes\nand the existing $B_{s,d}^0-\\bar B_{s,d}^0$ mixing data. We estimate the\nbranching fractions of $B_{s,d}^* \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ in both the models, which\nare found to be reasonably enhanced from their corresponding standard model\nvalues and within the reach of Run 2-3 of LHC.\n", "  Location-based social network data offers the promise of collecting the data\nfrom a large base of users over a longer span of time at negligible cost. While\nseveral studies have applied social network data to activity and mobility\nanalysis, a comparison with travel diaries and general statistics has been\nlacking. In this paper, we analysed geo-referenced Twitter activities from a\nlarge number of users in Singapore and neighbouring countries. By combining\nthis data, population statistics and travel diaries and applying clustering\ntechniques, we addressed detection of activity locations, as well as spatial\nseparation and transitions between these locations. Kernel density estimation\nperforms best to detect activity locations due to the scattered nature of the\ntwitter data; more activity locations are detected per user than reported in\nthe travel survey. The descriptive analysis shows that determining home\nlocations is more difficult than detecting work locations for most planning\nzones. Spatial separations between detected activity locations from Twitter\ndata - as reported in a travel survey and captured by public transport smart\ncard data - are mostly similarly distributed, but also show relevant\ndifferences for very short and very long distances. This also holds for the\ntransitions between zones. Whether the differences between Twitter data and\nother data sources stem from differences in the population sub-sample,\nclustering methodology, or whether social networks are being used significantly\nmore at specific locations must be determined by further research. Despite\nthese shortcomings, location-based social network data offers a promising data\nsource for insights into activity locations and mobility patterns, especially\nfor regions where travel survey data is not readily available.\n", "  The polycrystalline Sm2MgMnO6 (SMMO) was synthesized at 1173K by means of\nsol-gel technique. Rietveld refine-ment of X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern\nconfirmed the formation of a single phase monoclinic structure with space group\nP21/n. The band gap achieved from UV-vis spectra shows the semiconducting\nnature of the material. To observe the effect of grains and grain-boundaries in\nthe conduction process and dielectric relaxation measurements are carried out\non SMMO sample at different frequencies between 313 K and 673 K. An electrical\nequivalent circuit consisting of the resistance and constant phase element is\nused to clarify the impedance data.\n", "  Electronic applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) require the deposition of\ndielectric films on the tubes while conserving their excellent electronic\nproperties. In our density functional theory study we use the trimethylaluminum\n(TMA) atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a model process for a\nCNT-functionalization. Since this functionalization relies on the presence of\nOH-groups, the CNTs are exposed to a water or oxygen pre-treatment. We show\nthat only CNTs with a single-vacancy defect are able to react with H$_{2}$O or\nO$_{2}$. Further, the defect is preferably saturated by oxygen. This leaves the\nCNT without the necessary hydroxyl groups for the first TMA addition.\nTherefore, we propose an alternative initial step after which a classical TMA\nALD process can be performed on the CNT.\n", "  The information carrier of modern technologies is the electron charge whose\ntransport inevitably generates Joule heating. Spin-waves, the collective\nprecessional motion of electron spins, do not involve moving charges and thus\navoid Joule heating. In this respect, magnonic devices in which the information\nis carried by spin-waves attract interest for low-power computing. However\nimplementation of magnonic devices for practical use suffers from low spin-wave\nsignal and on/off ratio. Here we demonstrate that cubic anisotropic materials\ncan enhance spin-wave signals by improving spin-wave amplitude as well as group\nvelocity and attenuation length. Furthermore, cubic anisotropic material shows\nan enhanced on/off ratio through a laterally localized edge mode, which closely\nmimics the gate-controlled conducting channel in traditional field-effect\ntransistors. These attractive features of cubic anisotropic materials will\ninvigorate magnonics research towards wave-based functional devices.\n", "  Ultra-low-k (ULK) materials are essential for today's production of\nintegrated circuits (ICs). However, during the manufacturing process the ULK's\nlow dielectric constant (k-value) increases due to the replacement of\nhydrophobic species with hydrophilic groups. We investigate the use of plasma\nenhanced fragmented silylation precursors to repair this damage. The\nfragmentation of the silylation precursors octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS)\nand bis(dimethylamino)-dimethylsilane (DMADMS) and their possible repair\nreactions are studied using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations.\n", "  We present theoretical investigations of a k-restore process for damaged\npourous ultra-low-k (ULK) materials. The process is based on plasma enhanced\nfragmented silylation precursors to replace k-value damaging, polar Si-OH and\nSi-H bonds by k-value lowering Si-CH$_{3}$ bonds. We employ density functional\ntheory (DFT) to determine the favored fragments of silylation precursors and\nshow the successful repair of damaged bonds on our model system. This model\nsystem consists of a small set of ULK-fragments which represent various damaged\nstates of ULK materials. Our approach provides a fast scanning method for a\nwide variety of possible repair reactions. Further, we show that oxygen\ncontaining fragments are required to repair Si-H bonds and fragments with\ndangling Si-bonds are most effective to repair polar Si-OH bonds.\n", "  In this study, predictions obtained in the four and in the five flavour\nschemes are compared for two important processes involving heavy flavours at\nthe LHC: the production of a $Z$ or a Higgs boson in association with $b$\nquarks. In particular we obtain predictions with \\Sherpa's \\MCatNLO\nimplementation for the four--flavour scheme, treating the $b$'s as massive, and\nwith multijet merging at leading and next-to leading order for the\nfive--flavour scheme. While differences between the two schemes, at the\ninclusive level, are well understood from resummation of possibly large logs\ninto the $b$-PDFs, differences in shape present a major problem for\nexperimental measurements. We make use of data for $Z+b(\\bar{b})$ production at\nthe $7$ TeV LHC to exhibit strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches\nand we use these results to validate predictions for $b$-associated Higgs-boson\nproduction at the 13 TeV Run II.\n", "  Wall-bounded flows experience a transition to turbulence characterized by the\ncoexistence of laminar and turbulent domains in some range of Reynolds number\nR, the natural control parameter. This transitional regime takes place between\nan upper threshold Rt above which turbulence is uniform (featureless) and a\nlower threshold Rg below which any form of turbulence decays, possibly at the\nend of overlong chaotic transients. The most emblematic cases of flow along\nflat plates transiting to/from turbulence according to this scenario are\nreviewed. The coexistence is generally in the form of bands, alternatively\nlaminar and turbulent, and oriented obliquely with respect to the general flow\ndirection. The final decay of the bands at Rg points to the relevance of\ndirected percolation and criticality in the sense of statistical-physics phase\ntransitions. The nature of the transition at Rt where bands form is still\nsomewhat mysterious and does not easily fit the scheme holding for\npattern-forming instabilities at increasing control parameter on a laminar\nbackground. In contrast, the bands arise at Rt out of a uniform turbulent\nbackground at a decreasing control parameter. Ingredients of a possible theory\nof laminar-turbulent patterning are discussed.\n", "  Buoyancy-driven (thermal) convection in dilute granular media, fluidized by a\nvibrating base, is known to appear without the need of lateral boundaries in a\nrestricted region of parameters (inelasticity, gravity, intensity of energy\ninjection). We have recently discovered a second buoyancy-driven convection\neffect which occurs at any value of the parameters, provided that the impact of\nparticles with the lateral walls is inelastic (Pontuale et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 117, 098006 (2016)). It is understood that this novel convection effect\nis strictly correlated to the existence of perpendicular energy fluxes: a\nvertical one, induced by both bulk and wall inelasticity, and a horizontal one,\ninduced only by dissipation at the walls. Here we first review those previous\nresults, and then present new experimental and numerical data concerning the\nvariations of box geometry, intensity of energy injection, number of particles\nand width of the box.\n", "  Machine learning methods are evaluated to study the intriguing and debated\ntopic of discrimination among different tectonic environments using geochemical\nand isotopic data. Volcanic rocks characterized by a whole geochemical\nsignature of major elements (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, CaO, MgO, Na2O, K2O),\nselected trace elements (Sr, Ba, Rb, Zr, Nb, La, Ce, Nd, Hf, Sm, Gd, Y, Yb, Lu,\nTa, Th) and isotopes (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb, 87Sr/86Sr and\n143Nd/144Nd) have been extracted from open-access and comprehensive\npetrological databases (i.e. PetDB and GEOROC). The obtained dataset has been\nanalyzed using support vector machines, a set of supervised machine learning\nmethods, which are considered particularly powerful in classification problems.\nResults from the application of the machine learning methods show that the\ncombined use of major, trace elements and isotopes allow associating the\ngeochemical composition of rocks to the relative tectonic setting with high\nclassification scores (93%, on average). The lowest scores are recorded from\nvolcanic rocks deriving from back-arc basins (65%). All the other tectonic\nsettings display higher classification scores, with oceanic islands reaching\nvalues up to 99%. Results of this study could have a significant impact in\nother petrological studies potentially opening new perspectives for\npetrologists and geochemists. Other examples of applications include the\ndevelopment of more robust geo-thermometers and geo-barometers and the\nrecognition of volcanic sources for tephra layers in tephro-chronological\nstudies.\n", "  Similarly-charged polymers in solution, known as polyelectrolytes, are known\nto form aggregated structures in the presence of oppositely charged\ncounterions. Understanding the dependence of the equilibrium phases and the\ndynamics of the process of aggregation on parameters such as backbone\nflexibility and charge density of such polymers is crucial for insights into\nvarious biological processes which involve biological polyelectrolytes such as\nprotein, DNA etc., Here, we use large-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics\nsimulations to obtain the phase diagram of the aggregated structures of\nflexible charged polymers and characterize the morphology of the aggregates as\nwell as the aggregation dynamics, in the presence of trivalent counterions.\nThree different phases are observed depending on the charge density: no\naggregation, a finite bundle phase where multiple small aggregates coexist with\na large aggregate, and a fully phase separated phase. We show that the\nflexibility of the polymer backbone causes strong entanglement between charged\npolymers leading to additional time scales in the aggregation process. Such\nslowing down of the aggregation dynamics results in the exponent,\ncharacterizing the power law decay of the number of aggregates with time, to be\ndependent on the charge density of the polymers. These results are contrary to\nthose obtained for rigid polyelectrolytes, emphasizing the role of backbone\nflexibility.\n", "  How systems are endowed with migration capacity is a fascinating question\nwith implications ranging from the design of novel active systems to the\ncontrol of microbial populations. Bacteria, which can be found in a variety of\nenvironments, have developed among the richest set of locomotion mechanisms\nboth at the microscopic and collective levels. Here, we uncover experimentally\na new mode of collective bacterial motility in humid environment through the\ndepinning of bacterial droplets. While capillary forces are notoriously\nenormous at the bacterial scale, even capable of pinning water droplets of\nmillimetric size on inclined surfaces, we show that bacteria are able to\nharness a variety of mechanisms to unpin contact lines, hence inducing a\ncollective slipping of the colony across the surface. Contrary to\nflagella-dependent migration modes like swarming we show that this much faster\n`colony surfing' still occurs in mutant strains of \\textit{Bacillus subtilis}\nlacking flagella. The active unpinning seen in our experiments relies on a\nvariety of microscopic mechanisms which could each play an important role in\nthe migration of microorganisms in humid environment.\n", "  Increasing the spatial resolution of Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled\nPlasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a challenge in microanalysis of\ngeological samples. Smaller sizes for the laser beam will allow for (1) high\nresolution determination of trace element compositions, (2) accurate estimation\nof crystal/melt partition coefficients, (3) detailed characterization of\ndiffusion profiles, and (4) analysis of fine volcanic glasses. Here, we report\nabout the figures of merit for LA-ICP Quadrupole MS down to a spatial\nresolution of 5 {\\mu}m. This study highlights the possibility to achieve\nsuitable limits of detection, accuracy and precision for geological samples\neven at spatial resolutions of the order of 5 {\\mu}m. At a beam size of 15\n{\\mu}m precision (measured as one sigma) and accuracy (expressed as relative\ndeviation from the reference value) are of the order of 10%. At a smaller beam\nsize of 8um, precision decreases to 15% for concentration above 1.7 {\\mu}g g-1.\nAs the beam size is decreased to ~5 {\\mu}m, precision declines to about 15% and\n20% for concentrations above 10 {\\mu}g g-1 using 42Ca and 29Si as internal\nstandard, respectively. Accuracy is better or equal to 10% and 13 % at beam\nsizes of 15 and 10 {\\mu}m respectively. When the spatial resolution is\nincreased to 8 {\\mu}m, accuracy remains better than 15% and 20% for 42Ca and\n29Si as internal standard, respectively. We employed such high-resolution\ntechniques to volcanic glasses in ash particles of the 2010 Eyjafjallaj\\\"okull\neruption. Our results are well consistent with the previously reported data\nobtained at lower spatial resolution, supporting the reliability of the method.\n", "  We aim at finding the value of an explanatory variable, through its\nexpression in a large data-vector, without knowing the link function between\nthe explanatory variable and the data-space. Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR)\nmethod allows for the projection of a data-vector onto a subspace consistent\nwith the explanatory variable variation. We suggest a method based on the SIR\nsubspace, that gives the most efficient estimation of an unknown explanatory\nvariable.\n", "  Micro-cantilevers (MCs) are widely used in sensing, probing and a variety of\nother purposes. Apart from Si, the most versatile material in the micro domain,\nSiO2 MCs have attracted much attention lately. In this study, fabrication of\nSiO2 MCs using wet anisotropic etching technique is reported. Thermally grown\nSiO2 (300 nm) layer on single crystalline(c-) Si is utilized for the\nmicro-fabrication. Standard lithographic procedure was followed and the\nexposure of the photo-resist was performed by mask-less direct laser writer.\nVarious orientations on the c-Si wafer, their properties and implications on\nthe structure and integrity of the released SiO2 MC are discussed. The 110\ndirection was found to be much time consuming and sticking of the released\nstructures was almost evident. On the other hand 100 and 410 directions showed\nlesser release time and higher stability of the released structures due to\nunder-etching along the width of the MCs.\n", "  While power systems are reliable infrastructures, their complex\ninterconnectivities allow for propagation of disturbances through cascading\nfailures which causes blackouts. Meanwhile the ever increasing penetration\nlevel of renewable generation into power grids introduces a massive amount of\nuncertainty to the grid that might have a severe impact on grid vulnerability\nto overload cascading failures. There are numerous studies in the literature\nthat focus on modeling cascading failures with different approaches. However,\nthere is a need for studies that simulate cascading failure considering the\nuncertainty coming from high penetration of renewable generation. In this\nstudy, the impacts of wind generation in terms of its penetration and\nuncertainty levels on grid vulnerability to cascading overload failures are\nstudied. The simulation results on IEEE 300 bus system show that uncertainty\ncoming from wind energy have severe impact on grid vulnerability to cascading\noverload failures. Results also suggest that higher penetration levels of wind\nenergy if not managed appropriately will add to this severity due to injection\nof higher uncertainties into the grid.\n", "  With a few hundred spacecraft launched to date with electric propulsion (EP),\nit is possible to conduct an epidemiological study of EP on orbit reliability.\nThe first objective of the present work was to undertake such a study and\nanalyze EP track record of on orbit anomalies and failures by different\ncovariates. The second objective was to provide a comparative analysis of EP\nfailure rates with those of chemical propulsion. After a thorough data\ncollection, 162 EP-equipped satellites launched between January 1997 and\nDecember 2015 were included in our dataset for analysis. Several statistical\nanalyses were conducted, at the aggregate level and then with the data\nstratified by severity of the anomaly, by orbit type, and by EP technology.\nMean Time To Anomaly (MTTA) and the distribution of the time to anomaly were\ninvestigated, as well as anomaly rates. The important findings in this work\ninclude the following: (1) Post-2005, EP reliability has outperformed that of\nchemical propulsion; (2) Hall thrusters have robustly outperformed chemical\npropulsion, and they maintain a small but shrinking reliability advantage over\ngridded ion engines. Other results were also provided, for example the\ndifferentials in MTTA of minor and major anomalies for gridded ion engines and\nHall thrusters. It was shown that: (3) Hall thrusters exhibit minor anomalies\nvery early on orbit, which might be indicative of infant anomalies, and thus\nwould benefit from better ground testing and acceptance procedures; (4) Strong\nevidence exists that EP anomalies (onset and likelihood) and orbit type are\ndependent, a dependence likely mediated by either the space environment or\ndifferences in thrusters duty cycles; (5) Gridded ion thrusters exhibit both\ninfant and wear-out failures, and thus would benefit from a reliability growth\nprogram that addresses both these types of problems.\n", "  A finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of broadband\nelectromagnetic metasurfaces based on direct in- corporation of Generalized\nSheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) inside a conventional Yee-cell region has\nbeen proposed, for arbitrary wave excitations. This is achieved by inserting a\nzero thickness metasurface inside bulk nodes of the Yee-cell region, giving\nrise to three distinct cell configurations - Symmetric Cell (SC), Asymmetric\nCell (AC) and Tight Asymmetric Cell (TAC). In addition, the metasurface is\nmodelled using electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities exhibiting a\nbroadband Lorentzian response. As a result, the proposed model guarantees a\nphysical and causal response from the metasurface. Several full- wave results\nare shown, and compared with analytical Fourier propagation methods showing\nexcellent results, for both 1D and 2D fields simulations. It is found that the\nTAC provides the fastest convergence among the three methods with minimum\nerror.\n", "  The predictability of extreme intensity pulses emitted by an optically\ninjected semiconductor laser is studied numerically, by using a well-known rate\nequation model. We show that symbolic ordinal time-series analysis allows to\nidentify the patterns of intensity oscillations that are likely to occur before\nan extreme pulse. The method also gives information about patterns which are\nunlikely to occur before an extreme pulse. The specific patterns identified\ncapture the topology of the underlying chaotic attractor and depend on the\nmodel parameters. The methodology proposed here can be useful for analyzing\ndata recorded from other complex systems that generate extreme fluctuations in\ntheir output signals.\n", "  The electronic property of NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device is investigated\nthrough nonequilibrium Green's functions (NEGF) in combination with density\nfunctional theory (DFT). The electronic transport properties of NiFe$_2$O$_4$\nnanowire are studied in terms of density of states, transmission spectrum and\n$I{-}V$ characteristics. The density of states gets modified with the applied\nbias voltage across NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device, the density of charge is\nobserved both in the valence band and in the conduction band on increasing the\nbias voltage. The transmission spectrum of NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device gives\nthe insights on the transition of electrons at different energy intervals. The\nfindings of the present work suggest that NiFe$_2$O$_4$ nanowire device can be\nused as negative differential resistance (NDR) device and its NDR property can\nbe tuned with the bias voltage, which may be used in microwave device, memory\ndevices and in fast switching devices.\n", "  Superfluid helium II contains excitations known as rotons. Their properties\nhave been studied experimentally for more than 70 years but their structure is\nnot fully understood. Feynman's 1954 description, involving rotating flow\npatterns, does not fully explain later experimental data. Here we identify\nvolumetric, thermodynamic, colloidal, excitation, x-ray and neutron scattering\nevidence that rotons are composed of interstitial helium atoms. We show in\nparticular that they have the same mass, effective mass and activation energy\nwithin experimental accuracy. They readily move through the substrate, and\ncouple through lattice vibrations to produce quantized, loss-free flow which\ncorresponds to the observed superflow. Our observations revive London's 1936\nconclusion that helium II has a relatively open crystal-like lattice with\nenough free volume for atoms to move relative to one another, and reconcile it\nwith London's 1938 description of a quantum fluid.\n", "  The logic of gauge theory is considered by tracing its development from\ngeneral relativity to Yang-Mills theory, through Weyl's two gauge theories. A\nhandful of elements---which for want of better terms can be called\n\\emph{geometrical justice}, \\emph{matter wave}, \\emph{second clock effect},\n\\emph{twice too many energy levels}---are enough to produce Weyl's second\ntheory; and from there, all that's needed to reach the Yang-Mills formalism is\na \\emph{non-Abelian structure group} (say $\\mathbb{SU}\\textrm{(}N\\textrm{)}$).\n", "  The total nuclear reaction cross-section is calculated considering with and\nwithout medium effect by employing Coulomb Modified Glauber Model (CMGM) for\ninteractions of projectiles 56^Fe_26, 84^Kr_36, 132^Xe_54, 197^Au_79 and\n238^U_92 with nuclear emulsion detector (NED) nuclei at around 1 GeV per\nnucleon incident kinetic energy. These calculated reaction cross-sections are\ncorrelated with the different target groups of the NED nuclei. The average\nvalue of various parameters are also calculated and compared with the\ncorresponding experimental results. The number of shower particles emitted in\nan interaction is also calculated and showed good agreement with the\nexperimental result. We observed that the total reaction cross-section\nincreases with increasing the target mass number in case of all the considered\nprojectiles. In addition, it shows that the average value of reaction\ncross-section with nuclear medium effect is in good agreement with the\nexperimental results for projectiles 56^Fe, 84^Kr, 132^Xe, although results of\nprojectiles 197^Au and 238^U are not in agreement with the experimental\nobservations. This study sheds some light on the energy dependence of the\nnuclear reaction cross-section.\n", "  Experimentally observed networks of interacting dynamical systems are\ninferred from recorded multivariate time series by evaluating a statistical\nmeasure of dependence, usually the cross-correlation coefficient, or mutual\ninformation. These measures reflect dependence in static probability\ndistributions, generated by systems' evolution, rather than coherence of\nsystems' dynamics. Moreover, these \"static\" measures of dependence can be\nbiased due to properties of dynamics underlying the analyzed time series.\nConsequently, properties of local dynamics can be misinterpreted as properties\nof connectivity or long-range interactions. We propose the mutual information\nrate as a measure reflecting coherence or synchronization of dynamics of two\nsystems and not suffering by the bias typical for the \"static\" measures. We\ndemonstrate that a computationally accessible estimation method, derived for\nGaussian processes and adapted by using the wavelet transform, can be effective\nfor nonlinear, nonstationary and multiscale processes. The discussed problem\nand the proposed method are illustrated using numerically generated data of\ncoupled dynamical systems as well as gridded reanalysis data of surface air\ntemperature as the source for the construction of climate networks. In\nparticular, scale-specific climate networks are introduced.\n", "  The study of supramolecular interactions and aggregation behaviour of\nfunctional materials is of great importance to tune and extend their spectral\nsensitivity and, hence, improve the optoelectronic response of related devices.\nIn this study, we resolve spatially and spectrally the absorption and emission\nfeatures of a squaraine aggregate by means of confocal microscopy and\nabsorption/photoluminescence spectroscopy. We observe that the aggregate\naffords both a broad absorption spectrum (centred at 670 nm), likely originated\nby a dyes configuration with allowed J- and H- arrangements, and a strong and\nrelatively narrow emission in the near-infrared (NIR) part of the spectrum\n(centred at 780 nm), with a remarkable Stokes shift of 110 nm that is among the\nlargest exhibited by squaraine dyes. These peculiarities would be beneficial\nfor extending the spectral sensitivity of bot photovoltaic and light-emitting\ndiodes, and extremely appealing for possible applications of these aggregates\nas NIR fluorescent probes in biomedical applications.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the behavioural differences between mobile phone\ncustomers with prepaid and postpaid subscriptions. Our study reveals that (a)\npostpaid customers are more active in terms of service usage and (b) there are\nstrong structural correlations in the mobile phone call network as connections\nbetween customers of the same subscription type are much more frequent than\nthose between customers of different subscription types. Based on these\nobservations we provide methods to detect the subscription type of customers by\nusing information about their personal call statistics, and also their\negocentric networks simultaneously. The key of our first approach is to cast\nthis classification problem as a problem of graph labelling, which can be\nsolved by max-flow min-cut algorithms. Our experiments show that, by using both\nuser attributes and relationships, the proposed graph labelling approach is\nable to achieve a classification accuracy of $\\sim 87\\%$, which outperforms by\n$\\sim 7\\%$ supervised learning methods using only user attributes. In our\nsecond problem we aim to infer the subscription type of customers of external\noperators. We propose via approximate methods to solve this problem by using\nnode attributes, and a two-ways indirect inference method based on observed\nhomophilic structural correlations. Our results have straightforward\napplications in behavioural prediction and personal marketing.\n", "  Copper interconnects in modern integrated circuits require ultra-thin\nbarriers to prevent intermixing of Cu with surrounding dielectric materials.\nConventional barriers rely on metals like TaN, however their finite thickness\nreduces the cross-sectional area and significantly increases the resistivity of\nnanoscale interconnects. In this study, a new class of two-dimensional (2D) Cu\ndiffusion barriers, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2), is demonstrated for the first time. Using time-dependent dielectric\nbreakdown measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled\nwith energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss\nspectroscopy, these 2D materials are shown to be promising barrier solutions\nfor ultra-scaled interconnect technology. The predicted lifetime of devices\nwith directly deposited 2D barriers can achieve three orders of magnitude\nimprovement compared to control devices without barriers.\n", "  We present a recent calculation of Wigner distributions of quarks and gluons\nfor a quark target state dressed with a gluon, using overlaps of light-front\nwave functions.\n", "  Atomically-thin films of phosphorene (also known as black phosphorus) are a\nlow dimensional optical material with direct exciton emission, whose wavelength\nis tunable by controlling the number of layers. In addition to this excitonic\nemission, recent works revealed the existence of emissions from defect states\nand described new methods to manipulate them. Monolayer phosphorene exhibits\nemission from localized defect states at wavelengths near 920 nm. Increasing\nthe number of layers should shift the defect emission to longer wavelengths,\nenabling the material to span a broader spectral range. However, defect\nemission from few-layer phosphorene has not yet been reported. In this paper,\nwe demonstrate the existence of a new class of near-infrared emission from\ndefect states in few-layer phosphorene. Photoluminescence measurements show a\nbright emission around 1240 nm with a sublinear growth of emission intensity\nwhen the excitation intensity is linearly increased, confirming the\ndefect-based nature of this emission. From time-resolved lifetime measurements\nwe determine an emission lifetime of 1.1 ns, in contrast with the exciton\nlifetime from phosphorene, which has been previously reported to be in the\nrange of a few hundred picoseconds. This work shows that phosphorene defects\ncan act as a source of infrared light with potential applications in\noptoelectronics.\n", "  An noise-induced mechanism has been revealed by some authors recently for the\nhomochirality in a chiral system. Motivated by such stochastic process, we\nstudy the noise-induced transition in the system. The chiral transition, say\nthe transition between chiral states, is impossible in the deterministic view\nif the homochirality has been converged, but is a rare event when noise is\ninvolved. We study the rare event by using the large deviation theory (LDT) and\nfigure out the LDT rate functional for the transition probability through the\nDoi-Peliti second quantization path integral method. In order to check the\ncorrectness of our work, we have derived the Langevin equations through the\npath integral method by using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and\nrecover the equations reported by other authors through a different method.\n", "  In this paper the possibility to bring about the double- valley Dirac\nfermions in some quantum structures is predicted. These quantum structures are:\nstrained 3D Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te topological insulator (TI) with strong interface\ninversion asymmetry and the asymmetric Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te double quantum wells\n(DQW). The numerical analysis of the dispersion relation for 3D TI\nHg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te for the proper Cd ($x$)-content of in the\nHg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te-compound clearly show that the inversion symmetry breaking\ntogether with the unaxial tensile strain causes splitting each of Dirac nodes\n(two belonging to two interfaces) into two in the proximity of $\\Gamma$-point.\nThe similar effects can be obtained for asymmetric Hg$_{1-x}$Cd$_x$Te DQW with\nthe proper content of Cd and proper width of the quantum wells. The aim of this\nwork is to explore the inversion symmetry breaking in 3D TI and 2D DQWs mixed\nHgCdTe-systems. It is shown that this symmetry breaking leads to the dependence\nof carriers energy vs quasi-momentum similar to that of Weyl fermions.\n", "  We introduce the Nonlinear Cauchy-Riemann equations as B\\\"{a}cklund\ntransformations for several nonlinear and linear partial differential\nequations. From these equations we treat in details the Laplace and the\nLiouville equations by deriving general solution for the nonlinear Liouville\nequation. By M\\\"{o}bius transformation we relate solutions for the Poincare\nmodel of hyperbolic geometry, the Klein model in half-plane and the\npseudo-sphere. Conformal form of the constant curvature metrics in these\ngeometries, stereographic projections and special solutions are discussed. Then\nwe introduce the hyperbolic analog of the Riemann sphere, which we call the\nRiemann pseudosphere. We identify point at infinity on this pseudosphere and\nshow that it can be used in complex analysis as an alternative to usual Riemann\nsphere to extend the complex plane. Interpretation of symmetric and antipodal\npoints on both, the Riemann sphere and the Riemann pseudo-sphere, are given. By\nM\\\"{o}bius transformation and homogenous coordinates, the most general solution\nof Liouville equation as discussed by Crowdy is derived.\n", "  A simple route to prepare Gd$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ nanoparticles by\nultrasonication of their bulk powder materials is presented in this article.\nFor comparison, Gd$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ nanoparticles are also prepared by\nball milling. The prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction\n(XRD),field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive\nX-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), and Superconducting\nQuantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometer. XRD Rietveld analysis is\ncarried out extensively for the determination of crystallographic parameters\nand the amount of crystalline and amorphous phases. FESEM images demonstrate\nthe formation of nanoparticles with average particle size in the range of\n50-100 nm for both ultrasonication and 4 hours (h) of ball milling. The bulk\nmaterials and nanoparticles synthesized by both ultrasonication and 4 h ball\nmilling exhibit a paramagnetic to spin-glass transition. However, nanoparticles\nsynthesized by 8 h and 12 h ball milling do not reveal any phase transition,\nrather show an upturn of magnetization at low temperature. The degradation of\nthe magnetic properties in ball milled nanoparticles may be associated with\namorphization of the nanoparticles due to ball milling particularly for milling\ntime exceeding 8 h. This investigation demonstrates the potential of\nultrasonication as a simple route to prepare high crystalline rare-earth based\nmanganite nanoparticles with improved control compared to the traditional ball\nmilling technique.\n", "  The synthesis as well as structural, multiferroic and optical\ncharacterization of Dy doped BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic ceramic are presented. Bulk\npolycrystalline Bi$_{0.9}$Dy$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ sample is synthesized by solid\nstate reaction, while their nano counterparts are prepared using ultrasonic\nprobe sonication technique. Significant improvement of phase purity in the as\nsynthesized samples is observed after the doping of Dy both in bulk\nBi$_{0.9}$Dy$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ sample and corresponding nanoparticles as evidenced\nfrom Rietveld refinement. Magnetization measurements using SQUID magnetometer\nexhibit enhanced magnetic properties for Dy doped bulk\nBi$_{0.9}$Dy$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ ceramic compared to their nanostructured\ncounterparts as well as undoped BiFeO$_3$. Within the applied field range,\nsaturation polarization is observed for Bi$_{0.9}$Dy$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ bulk\nceramic only. As a result, intrinsic ferroelectric behavior is obtained just\nfor this sample. Optical bandgap measurements reveal lower bandgap for Dy doped\nbulk Bi$_{0.9}$Dy$_{0.1}$FeO$_3$ ceramic compared to that of corresponding\nnanoparticles and undoped BiFeO$_3$. The outcome of this investigation\ndemonstrates the potential of Dy as a doping element in BiFeO$_3$ that provides\na bulk ceramic material with improved multiferroic and optical properties\ncompared to those of corresponding nanoparticles which involve rigorous\nsynthesis procedure.\n", "  Using a diverse set of 100 oligothiophenes, extrapolated oligomer and polymer\nHOMO, LUMO and HOMO-LUMO gaps are shown to be accurately estimated from the\ncomputed values of the trimer HOMO, trimer LUMO and trimer HOMO-LUMO gaps.\nThese simple approximations can be improved further through easy to calculate\nproperties of monomers or small oligomers. Polymer reorganization energies,\nrelated to the hole transport, are also shown to be predicted accurately from\nsmall oligomers. Correlations between the HOMO slope with the HOMO polymer\nenergy and HOMO-LUMO gap slope with the polymer HOMO-LUMO gap energy suggest\nthat the degree of delocalization reflected in the slope is higher in monomers\nand polymers with electron-rich, less negative HOMO eigenvalues. These\nstatistical models can serve as efficient screens for the computational\nprediction of polythiophene properties.\n", "  We study anisotropies of helicity modulus, excitation spectrum, sound\nvelocity and angle-resolved luminescence spectrum in a two-dimensional system\nof interacting excitons in a periodic potential. Analytical expressions for\nanisotropic corrections to the quantities characterizing superfluidity are\nobtained. We consider particularly the case of dipolar excitons in quantum\nwells. For GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures as well as MoS$_2$/hBN/MoS$_2$ and\nMoSe$_2$/hBN/WSe$_2$ transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers estimates of the\nmagnitude of the predicted effects are given. We also present a method to\ncontrol superfluid motion and to determine the helicity modulus in generic\ndipolar systems.\n", "  This paper develops a unifying framework for signal reconstruction from\ninterferometric measurements that is broadly applicable to various applications\nof interferometry. In this framework, the problem of signal reconstruction in\ninterferometry amounts to one of basis analysis. Its applicability is shown to\nextend beyond conventional temporal interferometry, which leverages the\nrelative delay between the two arms of an interferometer, to arbitrary degrees\nof freedom of the input signal. This allows for reconstruction of signals\nsupported in other domains (e.g., spatial) with no modification to the\nunderlying structure except for replacing the standard temporal delay with a\ngeneralized delay, that is, a practically realizable unitary transformation for\nwhich the basis elements are eigenfunctions. Under the proposed model, the\ninterferometric measurements are shown to be linear in the basis coefficients,\nthereby enabling efficient and fast recovery of the desired information. While\nthe corresponding linear transformation has only a limited number of degrees of\nfreedom set by the structure of the interferometer giving rise to a highly\nconstrained sensing structure, we show that the problem of signal recovery from\nsuch measurements can still be carried out compressively. This signifies\nsignificant reduction in sample complexity without introducing any additional\nrandomization as is typically done in prior work leveraging compressive sensing\ntechniques. We provide performance guarantees under constrained sensing by\nproving that the transformation satisfies sufficient conditions for successful\nreconstruction of sparse signals using concentration arguments. We showcase the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using simulation results, as well as\nactual experimental results in the context of optical modal analysis of spatial\nbeams.\n"]}
