are key ingredients of interstellar chemistry since they are the\ninitial products of chemical networks that lead to the formation of more\ncomplex molecules. The fundamental rotational transitions of light hydrides\nfall into the submillimeter wavelength range. Using the APEX telescope, we\nobserved the long sought hydrides SH+ and OH+ in absorption against the strong\ncontinuum source Sagittarius B2(M). Both, absorption from Galactic center gas\nas well as from diffuse clouds in intervening spiral arms over a large velocity\nrange is observed. The detected absorption of a continuous velocity range on\nthe line of sight shows these hydrides to be an abundant component of diffuse\nclouds. In addition, we used the strongest submillimeter dust continuum sources\nin the inner Galaxy to serve as background candles for a systematic census of\nthese hydrides in diffuse clouds and massive star forming regions of our Galaxy\nand initial results of this survey are presented.\n", "  X-ray spectra from cores of galaxy clusters can be strongly distorted by\nresonant scattering of line photons, affecting metal abundance and gas velocity\nmeasurements. We introduce simulated spectral models that take into account the\nresonant scattering effect, radial variations of thermodynamic properties of\nthe hot gas, projection effects and small-scale isotropic gas motions. The key\nfeature of the models is that all these effects are treated self-consistently\nfor the whole spectrum, rather than for individual lines. The model spectra are\npublicly available and can be used for direct comparison with observed\nprojected spectra. Comparison with the existing XMM-Newton and Chandra data of\nthe Perseus Cluster shows that even though there is no strong evidence for the\nresonant scattering in Perseus, the low energy resolution of the X-ray CCDs is\nnot sufficient to robustly distinguish spectral distortions due to the resonant\nscattering, different metal abundance profiles and different levels of gas\nturbulence. Future Astro-H data will resolve most of the problems we are facing\nwith CCDs. With the help of our models, the resonant scattering analysis can be\ndone self-consistently using the whole spectral information, constraining the\nlevel of gas turbulence already with a 100 ks observation with Astro-H.\n", "  The spin-charge-family theory, which is a kind of the Kaluza-Klein theories\nbut with fermions carrying two kinds of spins (no charges), offers the\nexplanation for all the assumptions of the standard model, with the origin of\nfamilies, the higgs and the Yukawa couplings included. It offers the\nexplanation also for other phenomena, like the origin of the dark matter and of\nthe matter/antimatter asymmetry in the universe. It predicts the existence of\nthe fourth family to the observed three, as well as several scalar fields with\nthe weak and the hyper charge of the standard model higgs ($\\pm \\frac{1}{2},\n\\mp \\frac{1}{2}$, respectively), which determine the mass matrices of family\nmembers, offering an explanation, why the fourth family with the masses above\n$1$ TeV contributes weakly to the gluon-fusion production of the observed higgs\nand to its decay into two photons, and predicting that the two photons events,\nobserved at the LHC at $\\approx 750$ GeV, might be an indication for the\nexistence of one of several scalars predicted by this theory.\n", "  Type-Iax supernovae (SN Iax) are stellar explosions that are\nspectroscopically similar to some type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia) at maximum light,\nexcept with lower ejecta velocities. They are also distinguished by lower\nluminosities. At late times, their spectroscopic properties diverge from other\nSN, but their composition (dominated by iron-group and intermediate-mass\nelements) suggests a physical connection to normal SN Ia. These are not rare;\nSN Iax occur at a rate between 5 and 30% of the normal SN Ia rate. The leading\nmodels for SN Iax are thermonuclear explosions of accreting carbon-oxygen white\ndwarfs that do not completely unbind the star, implying they are \"less\nsuccessful\" cousins of normal SN Ia, where complete disruption is observed.\nHere we report the detection of the luminous, blue progenitor system of the\ntype-Iax SN 2012Z in deep pre-explosion imaging. Its luminosity, colors,\nenvironment, and similarity to the progenitor of the Galactic helium nova V445\nPuppis, suggest that SN 2012Z was the explosion of a white dwarf accreting from\na helium-star companion. Observations in the next few years, after SN 2012Z has\nfaded, could test this hypothesis, or alternatively show that this supernova\nwas actually the explosive death of a massive star.\n", "  More than 40 years ago the standard model made a successful new step in\nunderstanding properties of fermion and boson fields. Now the next step is\nneeded, which would explain what the standard model and the cosmological models\njust assume: a. The origin of quantum numbers of massless one family members.\nb. The origin of families. c. The origin of the vector gauge fields. d. The\norigin of the Higgses and Yukawa couplings. e. The origin of the dark matter.\nf. The origin of the matter-antimatter asymmetry. g. The origin of the dark\nenergy. h. And several other open problems. The spin-charge-family theory, a\nkind of the Kaluza-Klein theories in $(d=(2n-1) +1)$ - space-time, with\n$d=(13+1)$ and the two kinds of the spin connection fields, which are the gauge\nfields of the two kinds of the Clifford algebra objects anti-commuting with one\nanother, may provide this much needed next step. The talk presents: i. A short\npresentation of this theory. ii. The review over the achievements of this\ntheory so far, with some not published yet achievements included. iii.\nPredictions for future experiments.\n", "  Accretion disc theory is less developed than stellar evolution theory\nalthough a similarly mature phenomenological picture is ultimately desired.\nWhile the interplay of theory and numerical simulations has amplified community\nawareness of the role of magnetic fields in angular momentum transport, there\nremains a long term challenge to incorporate insight gained from simulations\nback into improving practical models for comparison with observations. Here we\nemphasize the need to incorporate the role of non-local transport more\nprecisely. To show where large scale transport would fit into the theoretical\nframework and how it is currently missing, we review why the wonderfully\npractical approach of Shakura-Sunyaev (1973,SS73) is necessarily a mean field\ntheory, and one which does not include large scale transport. Observations of\ncoronae and jets combined with the interpretation of results even from shearing\nbox simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) suggest that a\nsignificant fraction of disc transport is indeed non-local. We show that the\nMaxwell stresses in saturation are dominated by large scale contributions and\nthe physics of MRI transport is not fully captured by a viscosity. We also\nclarify the standard physical interpretation of the MRi as it applies to\nshearing boxes. Computational limitations have so far focused most attention\ntoward local simulations but the next generation of global simulations should\nhelp to inform improved mean field theories. Mean field accretion theory and\nmean field dynamo theory should in fact be unified into a single theory that\npredicts the time evolution of spectra and luminosity from separate disc,\ncorona, and outflow contributions. Finally, we note that any mean field theory\nhas a finite predictive precision that needs to be quantified when comparing\nthe predictions to observations.\n", "  The complete structure of the Casimir ${\\cal{W}\\cal{A}}_{\\it{N}}$ algebras\nare shown to exist in such a way that the Casimir ${\\cal{W}\\cal{A}}_{\\it{N}}$\nalgebra is a kind of truncated type of $\\cal{W}_{\\infty}$ algebra both in the\nprimary and in the quadratic basis, first using the associativity conditions in\nthe basis of primary fields and second using the Miura basis coming from the\nfree field realization as a different basis. Finally one can say that the\nCasimir ${\\cal{W}\\cal{A}}_{\\it{N}}$ algebra is a kind of truncated type of\n$\\cal{W}_{\\infty}$algebra,so it is clear from any construction of\n$\\cal{W}_{\\infty}$ algebra that by putting infinite number of fields $W_{s}$\nwith $s>N$ to zero we arrive at the Casimir ${\\cal{W}\\cal{A}}_{\\it{N}}$\nalgebra.\n", "  We investigate graphs that can be disconnected into small components by\nremoving a vanishingly small fraction of their vertices. We show that when a\nquantum network is described by such a graph, the network is efficiently\ncontrollable, in the sense that universal quantum computation can be performed\nusing a control sequence polynomial in the size of the network while\ncontrolling a vanishingly small fraction of subsystems. We show that networks\ncorresponding to finite-dimensional lattices are efficently controllable, and\nexplore generalizations to percolation clusters and random graphs. We show that\nthe classical computational complexity of estimating the ground state of\nHamiltonians described by controllable graphs is polynomial in the number of\nsubsystems/qubits.\n", "  Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging research field aiming to extend\nstandard thermodynamics and non-equilibrium statistical physics to ensembles of\nsizes well below the thermodynamic limit, in non-equilibrium situations, and\nwith the full inclusion of quantum effects. Fuelled by experimental advances\nand the potential of future nanoscale applications this research effort is\npursued by scientists with different backgrounds, including statistical\nphysics, many-body theory, mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory,\nwho bring various tools and methods to the field. A multitude of theoretical\nquestions are being addressed ranging from issues of thermalisation of quantum\nsystems and various definitions of \"work\", to the efficiency and power of\nquantum engines. This overview provides a perspective on a selection of these\ncurrent trends accessible to postgraduate students and researchers alike.\n", "  We calculate the free energy from the on-shell action for topologically\nmassive gravity with negative and vanishing cosmological constant, thereby\nproviding a first principles derivation of the free energy of\nBanados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black holes and flat space cosmologies. We\nsummarize related recent checks of flat space holography.\n", "  Imposing a magnetic field on a turbulent flow of electrically conducting\nfluid incurs the Joule effect. A current paradigm is that the corresponding\ndissipation increases with the intensity of the magnetic field, and as a result\nturbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong.\nWhile this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying\nturbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex\nconfigurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the\ncontroversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent\nanisotropy to profoundly reorganise the structure of turbulence, so their net\neffect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here\nwe show that when turbulence is forced in a magnetic field that acts on\nturbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field\npromotes large, nearly 2D structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the\nloss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity\nof turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries\nimportant consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets,\naccretion disks and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering\napplications.\n", "  Active error decoding and correction of topological quantum codes - in\nparticular the toric code - remains one of the most viable routes to large\nscale quantum information processing. In contrast, passive error correction\nrelies on the natural physical dynamics of a system to protect encoded quantum\ninformation. However, the search is ongoing for a completely satisfactory\npassive scheme applicable to locally-interacting two-dimensional systems. Here,\nwe investigate dynamical decoders that provide passive error correction by\nembedding the decoding process into local dynamics. We propose a specific\ndiscrete time cellular-automaton decoder in the fault tolerant setting and\nprovide numerical evidence showing that the logical qubit has a survival time\nextended by several orders of magnitude over that of a bare unencoded qubit. We\nstress that (asynchronous) dynamical decoding gives rise to a Markovian\ndissipative process. We hence equate cellular-automaton decoding to a fully\ndissipative topological quantum memory, which removes errors continuously. In\nthis sense, uncontrolled and unwanted local noise can be corrected for by a\ncontrolled local dissipative process. We analyze the required resources,\ncommenting on additional polylogarithmic factors beyond those incurred by an\nideal constant resource dynamical decoder.\n", "  Late-type main sequence stars exhibit an x-ray to bolometric flux ratio that\ndepends on ${\\tilde Ro}$, the ratio of rotation period to convective turnover\ntime, as ${\\tilde Ro}^{-\\zeta}$ with $2\\le \\zeta \\le 3$ for ${\\tilde Ro}\n>0.13$, but saturates with $|\\zeta| <0.2$ for ${\\tilde Ro} < 0.13$. Saturated\nstars are younger than unsaturated stars and show a broader spread of rotation\nrates and x-ray activity. The unsaturated stars have magnetic fields and\nrotation speeds that scale roughly with the square root of their age, though\npossibly flattening for stars older than the sun. The connection between faster\nrotators, stronger fields, and higher activity has been established\nobservationally, but a theory for the unified time-evolution of x-ray\nluminosity, rotation, magnetic field and mass loss that captures the above\ntrends has been lacking. Here we derive a minimalist holistic framework for the\ntime evolution of these quantities built from combining a Parker wind with new\ningredients: (1) explicit sourcing of both the thermal energy launching the\nwind and the x-ray luminosity via dynamo produced magnetic fields; (2) explicit\ncoupling of x-ray activity and mass loss saturation to dynamo saturation (via\nmagnetic helicity build-up and convection eddy shredding); (3) use of coronal\nequilibrium to determine how magnetic energy is divided into wind and x-ray\ncontributions. For solar-type stars younger than the sun, we infer conduction\nto be a subdominant power loss compared to x-rays and wind. For older stars,\nconduction is more important, possibly quenching the wind and reducing angular\nmomentum loss. We focus on the time evolution for stars younger than the sun,\nhighlighting what is possible for further generalizations. Overall, the\napproach shows promise toward a unified explanation of all of the\naforementioned observational trends.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes in planar super-Yang-Mills theory satisfy several basic\nphysical and mathematical constraints, including physical constraints on their\nbranch cut structure and various empirically discovered connections to the\nmathematics of cluster algebras. The power of the bootstrap program for\namplitudes is inversely proportional to the size of the intersection between\nthese physical and mathematical constraints: ideally we would like a list of\nconstraints which determine scattering amplitudes uniquely. We explore this\nintersection quantitatively for two-loop six- and seven-point amplitudes by\nproviding a complete taxonomy of the Gr(4,6) and Gr(4,7) cluster polylogarithm\nfunctions of arXiv:1401.6446 at weight 4.\n", "  We analyse ALMA observations of the 12CO(3-2) emission of the circumstellar\nenvelope (CSE) of the Mira variable binary star W Aql. These provide, for the\nfirst time, spatially resolved Doppler velocity spectra of the CSE up to\nangular distances to the central star of ~ 5\" (meaning some 2000 AU). The\nexploratory nature of the observations (only five minutes in each of two\ndifferent configurations) does not allow for a detailed modelling of the\nproperties of the CSE but provides important qualitative information on its\nmorphology and kinematics. Emission is found to be enhanced along an axis\nmoving from east/west to north-east/south-west when the angular distance from\nthe central star projected on the plane of the sky increases from zero to four\narcseconds. In parallel, the Doppler velocity distribution displays asymmetry\nalong an axis moving from east/west to north-west/south-east. The results are\ndiscussed in the context of earlier observations, in particular of the dust\nmorphology.\n", "  The aim of the present study is to provide a picture for geopolitical\nglobalization: the role of all world countries together with their contribution\ntowards globalization is highlighted. In the context of the present study,\nevery country owes its efficiency and therefore its contribution towards\nstructuring the world by the position it holds in a complex global network. The\nlocation in which a country is positioned on the network is shown to provide a\nmeasure of its \"contribution\" and \"importance\". As a matter of fact, the visa\nstatus conditions between countries reflect their contribution towards\ngeopolitical globalization. Based on the visa status of all countries,\ncommunity detection reveals the existence of 4+1 main communities. The\ncommunity constituted by the developed countries has the highest clustering\ncoefficient equal to 0.9. In contrast, the community constituted by the old\neastern European blocks, the middle eastern countries, and the old Soviet Union\nhas the lowest clustering coefficient approximately equal to 0.65. PR China is\nthe exceptional case. Thus, the picture of the globe issued in this study\ncontributes towards understanding \"how the world works\".\n", "  The gyromagnetic factor is an important physical quantity relating the\nmagnetic-dipole moment of a particle to its spin. The electron spin g-factor in\nvacuo is one of the best model-based theoretical predictions ever made, showing\nagreement with the measured value up to ten parts per trillion. However, for\nelectrons in a material the g-factor is modified with respect to its value in\nvacuo because of environment interactions. Here, we show how interaction\neffects lead to the spin g-factor correction in graphene by considering the\nfull electromagnetic interaction in the framework of pseudo-QED. We compare our\ntheoretical prediction with experiments performed on graphene deposited on SiO2\nand SiC, and we find a very good agreement between them.\n", "  It is well known that the usual formulation of Elko spinor fields leads to a\nsubtle Lorentz symmetry break encoded in the spin sums. Recently it was\nproposed a redefinition in the dual structure, along with a given mathematical\ndevice, which eliminate the Lorentz breaking term in the spin sums. In this\nwork we delve into the analysis of this mathematical device providing a solid\nframework to the used method.\n", "  A model of interdependent networks of networks (NoN) has been introduced\nrecently in the context of brain activation to identify the neural collective\ninfluencers in the brain NoN. Here we develop a new approach to derive an exact\nexpression for the random percolation transition in Erd\\\"{o}s-R\\'enyi NoN.\nAnalytical calculations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations\nand highlight the robustness of the NoN against random node failures.\nInterestingly, the phase diagram of the model unveils particular patterns of\ninterconnectivity for which the NoN is most vulnerable. Our results help to\nunderstand the emergence of robustness in such interdependent architectures.\n", "  We report the first magneto-caloric and calorimetric observations of a\nmagnetic-field-induced phase transition within a superconducting state to the\nlong-sought exotic \"FFLO\" superconducting state first predicted over 50 years\nago. Through the combination of bulk thermodynamic calorimetric and\nmagnetocaloric measurements in the organic superconductor $\\kappa$ -\n(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu(NCS)$_2$, as a function of temperature, magnetic field\nstrength, and magnetic field orientation, we establish for the first time that\nthis field-induced first-order phase transition at the paramagnetic limit $H_p$\nfor traditional superconductivity is to a higher entropy superconducting phase\nuniquely characteristic of the FFLO state. We also establish that this\nhigh-field superconducting state displays the bulk paramagnetic ordering of\nspin domains required of the FFLO state. These results rule out the alternate\npossibility of spin-density wave (SDW) ordering in the high field\nsuperconducting phase. The phase diagram determined from our measurements ---\nincluding the observation of a phase transition into the FFLO phase at $H_p$\n--- is in good agreement with recent NMR results and our own earlier\ntunnel-diode magnetic penetration depth experiments, but is in disagreement\nwith the only previous calorimetric report.\n", "  We study the equilibrium and near-equilibrium properties of a holographic\nfive-dimensional model consisting of Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field\nwith a non-trivial potential. The dual four-dimensional gauge theory is not\nconformal and, at zero temperature, exhibits a renormalisation group flow\nbetween two different fixed points. We quantify the deviations from\nconformality both in terms of thermodynamic observables and in terms of the\nbulk viscosity of the theory. The ratio of bulk over shear viscosity violates\nBuchel's bound. We study relaxation of small-amplitude, homogeneous\nperturbations by computing the quasi-normal modes of the system at zero spatial\nmomentum. In this approximation we identify two different relaxation channels.\nAt high temperatures, the different pressures first become approximately equal\nto one another, and subsequently this average pressure evolves towards the\nequilibrium value dictated by the equation of state. At low temperatures, the\naverage pressure first evolves towards the equilibrium pressure, and only later\nthe different pressures become approximately equal to one another.\n", "  The experimental observation of the renormalization of the Fermi velocity\n$v_{F}$ as a function of doping has been a landmark for confirming the\nimportance of electronic interactions in graphene. Although the experiments\nwere performed in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field $B$, the\nmeasurements are well described by a renormalization-group (RG) theory that did\nnot include it. Here we clarify this issue, for both massive and massless Dirac\nsystems, and show that for the weak magnetic fields at which the experiments\nare performed, there is no change in the renormalization-group functions. Our\ncalculations are carried out in the framework of the Pseudo-quantum\nelectrodynamics (PQED) formalism, which accounts for dynamical interactions. We\ninclude only the linear dependence in $B$, and solve the problem using two\ndifferent parametrizations, the Feynman and the Schwinger one. We confirm the\nresults obtained earlier within the RG procedure and show that, within linear\norder in the magnetic field, the only contribution to the renormalization of\nthe Fermi velocity arises due to interactions. In addition, for gapped systems,\nwe observe a running of the mass parameter.\n", "  Edge states in topological insulators (TIs) disperse symmetrically about one\nof the time-reversal invariant momenta $\\Lambda$ in the Brillouin zone (BZ)\nwith protected degeneracies at $\\Lambda$. Commonly TIs are distinguished from\ntrivial insulators by the values of one or multiple topological invariants that\nrequire an analysis of the bulk band structure across the BZ. We propose an\neffective two-band Hamiltonian for the electronic states in graphene based on a\nTaylor expansion of the tight-binding Hamiltonian about the time-reversal\ninvariant $M$ point at the edge of the BZ. This Hamiltonian provides a faithful\ndescription of the protected edge states for both zigzag and armchair ribbons\nthough the concept of a BZ is not part of such an effective model. We show that\nthe edge states are determined by a band inversion in both reciprocal and real\nspace, which allows one to select $\\Lambda$ for the edge states without\naffecting the bulk spectrum.\n", "  We derive a precise dictionary between micro-state geometries and open string\ncondensates for a large class of excitations of four dimensional BPS black\nholes realised in terms of D3-branes intersecting on a six-torus. The complete\nmultipole expansion of the supergravity solutions at weak coupling is extracted\nfrom string amplitudes involving one massless closed string and multiple open\nstrings insertions on disks with mixed boundary conditions.\n", "  Flood front is the jump interface where fluids distribute discontinuously,\nwhose interface condition is the theoretical basis of a mathematical model of\nthe multiphase flow in porous medium. The conventional interface condition at\nthe jump interface is expressed as the continuous Darcy velocity and fluid\npressure (named CVCM ). Our study has inspected this conclusions. First, it is\nrevealed that the principle of mass conservation has no direct relation to the\nvelocity conservation, and the former is not the true foundation of the later,\nbecause the former only reflects the kinetic characteristic of the fluid\nparticles at one position(the interface), but not the neighborhood of the\ninterface which required by the later. Then the reasonableness of CVCM is\nqueried from the following three aspects:(1)Using Mukat's two phase seepage\nequation and the mathematical method of apagoge, we have disproved the\ncontinuity of each fluid velocity;(2)Since the analytical solution of the\nequation of Buckley-Leveret equations is acquirable, its velocity jumps at the\nflood front presents an appropriate example to disprove the CVCM;(3) The\nnumerical simulation model gives impractical result that flood front would stop\nmoving if CVCM were used to calculate the velocities at the interface between\ntwo gridcells. Subsequently, a new one, termed as Jump Velocity Condition Model\n(JVCM), is deduced from Muskat's two phase seepage equations and Darcy's law\nwithout taking account of the capillary force and compressibility of rocks and\nfluids. Finally, several cases are presented. And the comparisons of the\nvelocity, pressure difference and the front position, which are given by JVCM,\nCVCM and SPU, have shown that the result of JVCM is the closest to the exact\nsolution.\n", "  Conventional theories of electromagnetic waves in a medium assume that the\nenergy propagating with the light pulse in the medium is entirely carried by\nthe field. Thus, the possibility that the optical force field of the light\npulse would drive forward an atomic mass density wave (MDW) and the related\nkinetic and elastic energies is neglected. In this work, we present foundations\nof a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by considering a light\nwave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic\nforces between the induced dipoles and the electromagnetic field. We prove that\nthe transfer of mass as MDW associated with the light pulse, the photon mass\ndrag effect, gives an essential contribution to the total momentum of the light\npulse, which becomes equal to the Minkowski momentum. Thus, our theory also\nresolves the centenary Abraham-Minkowski controversy of the momentum of light\nin a nondispersive medium. We derive the photon mass drag effect using two\nindependent but complementary covariant models. In the mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle approach, we consider the light pulse as a coupled state between\nthe photon and matter, isolated from the rest of the medium. The momentum and\nthe transferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and\nthe fundamental conservation laws of nature. To enable the calculation of the\nmass and momentum distribution of a light pulse, we have also generalized the\nelectrodynamics of continuous media to account for the optoelastic dynamics of\nthe medium. In this optoelastic continuum dynamics (OCD) approach, we obtain a\nnumerically accurate solution of the Newtonian continuum dynamics of the medium\nwhen the light pulse is propagating in it. We finally discuss a possibility of\nan optical waveguide setup for experimental measurement of the transferred mass\nof the light pulse.\n", "  Realizing that couplings related by supersymmetry (SUSY) can be disentangled\nwhen SUSY is broken, it is suggested that unwanted flavor and CP violating SUSY\ncouplings may be suppressed via quenched gaugino-flavor interactions, which may\nbe accomplished by power-law running of sfermion anomalous dimensions. A simple\ntheoretical framework to accomplish this is exemplified and the defeated\nconstraints are tallied. One key implication of the scenario is the expectation\nof enhanced top, bottom and tau production at the LHC, accompanied by large\nmissing energy. Also, direct detection signals of dark matter may be more\nchallenging to find than in conventional SUSY scenarios.\n", "  Recent advances in engineering and control of nanoscale quantum sensors have\nopened new paradigms in precision metrology. Unfortunately, hardware\nrestrictions often limit the sensor performance. In nanoscale magnetic\nresonance probes, for instance, finite sampling times greatly limit the\nachievable sensitivity and spectral resolution. We develop a technique for\ncoherent quantum interpolation that can overcome these problems. Using a\nquantum sensor associated with the Nitrogen Vacancy center in diamond, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that quantum interpolation can achieve spectroscopy\nof classical magnetic fields and individual quantum spins with orders of\nmagnitude finer frequency resolution than conventionally possible. Not only is\nquantum interpolation an enabling technique to extract structural and chemical\ninformation from single biomolecules, but it can be directly applied to other\nquantum systems for super-resolution quantum spectroscopy.\n", "  We develop a real space renormalisation group analysis of disordered models\nof glasses, in particular of the spin models at the origin of the Random First\nOrder Transition theory. We find three fixed points respectively associated to\nthe liquid state, to the critical behavior and to the glass state. The latter\ntwo are zero-temperature ones; this provides a natural explanation of the\ngrowth of effective activation energy scale and the concomitant huge increase\nof relaxation time approaching the glass transition. The lower critical\ndimension depends on the nature of the interacting degrees of freedom and is\nhigher than three for all models. This does not prevent three dimensional\nsystems from being glassy. Indeed, we find that their renormalisation group\nflow is affected by the fixed points existing in higher dimension and in\nconsequence is non-trivial. Within our theoretical framework the glass\ntransition results to be an avoided phase transition.\n", "  For decades, numerous attempts have been made to produce polar oxynitride\nperovskites, where some of the oxygen are replaced by nitrogen, but a polar\nordered oxynitride has never been demonstrated. Caracas and Cohen studied\npossible ordered polar oxynitrides within density functional theory (DFT) and\nfound a few candidates that were predicted to be insulating and at least\nmetastable. YSiO2N stood out with huge predicted polarization and nonlinear\noptic coefficients. In this study, we demonstrate the synthesis of\nperovskite-structured YSiO2N by using a combination of a diamond anvil cell and\nin-situ laser heating technique. Subsequent in-situ X-ray diffraction, second\nharmonic generation, and Raman scattering measurements confirm that it is polar\nand a strong nonlinear optical material, with structure and properties similar\nto those predicted by DFT.\n", "  We numerically simulate gravitational shock wave collisions in a holographic\nmodel dual to a non-conformal four-dimensional gauge theory. We find two novel\neffects associated to the non-zero bulk viscosity of the resulting plasma.\nFirst, the hydrodynamization time increases. Second, if the bulk viscosity is\nlarge enough then the plasma becomes well described by hydrodynamics before the\nenergy density and the average pressure begin to obey the equilibrium equation\nof state. We discuss implications for the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy\nion collision experiments.\n", "  In interdependent networks, it is usually assumed, based on percolation\ntheory, that nodes become nonfunctional if they lose connection to the network\ngiant component. However, in reality, some nodes, equipped with alternative\nresources, together with their connected neighbors can still be functioning\nonce disconnected from the giant component. Here we propose and study a\ngeneralized percolation model that introduces a fraction of reinforced nodes in\nthe interdependent networks that can function and support their neighborhood.\nWe analyze, both analytically and via simulations, the order parameter$-$the\nfunctioning component$-$comprising both the giant component and smaller\ncomponents that include at least one reinforced node. Remarkably, we find that\nfor interdependent networks, we need to reinforce only a small fraction of\nnodes to prevent abrupt catastrophic collapses. Moreover, we find that the\nuniversal upper bound of this fraction is 0.1756 for two interdependent\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, regular-random (RR) networks and scale-free\n(SF) networks with large average degrees. We also generalize our theory to\ninterdependent networks of networks (NON). Our findings might yield insight for\ndesigning resilient interdependent infrastructure networks.\n", "  A gluphilic scalar dark matter (GSDM) model has recently been proposed as an\ninteresting vision for WIMP dark matter communicating dominantly with the\nStandard Model via gluons. We discuss the collider signature of a hard jet\nrecoiling against missing momentum (\"mono-jet\") in such a construction, whose\nleading contribution is at one-loop. We compare the full one-loop computation\nwith an effective field theory (EFT) treatment, and find (as expected) that EFT\ndoes not accurately describe regions of parameter space where mass of the\ncolored mediator particles are comparable to the experimental cuts on the\nmissing energy. We determine bounds (for several choices of SU(3)\nrepresentation of the mediator) from the $\\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV data, and show the\nexpected reach of the $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV LHC and a future 100 TeV $pp$ collider\nto constrain or discover GSDM models.\n", "  In the context of LLM geometries, we show that superpositions of classical\ncoherent states of trivial topology can give rise to new classical limits where\nthe topology of spacetime has changed. We argue that this phenomenon implies\nthat neither the topology nor the geometry of spacetime can be the result of an\noperator measurement. We address how to reconcile these statements with the\nusual semiclassical analysis of low energy effective field theory for gravity.\n", "  In the present paper we introduce a multi-dimensional version of the R-matrix\napproach to the construction of integrable hierarchies. Applying this method to\nthe case of the Lie algebra of functions with respect to the contact bracket,\nwe construct integrable hierarchies of (3+1)-dimensional dispersionless systems\nof the type recently introduced by one of us in arXiv:1401.2122.\n", "  One of the many remarkable properties of conformal field theory in two\ndimensions is its connection to algebraic geometry. Since every compact Riemann\nsurface is a projective algebraic curve, many constructions of interest in\nphysics (which a priori depend on the analytic structure of the spacetime) can\nbe formulated in purely algebraic language. This opens the door to interesting\ngeneralizations, obtained by taking another choice of field: for instance, the\n$p$-adics. We generalize the AdS/CFT correspondence according to this\nprinciple; the result is a formulation of holography in which the bulk geometry\nis discrete---the Bruhat--Tits tree for $\\mathrm{PGL}(2,\\mathbb{Q}_p)$---but\nthe group of bulk isometries nonetheless agrees with that of boundary conformal\ntransformations and is not broken by discretization. We suggest that this forms\nthe natural geometric setting for tensor networks that have been proposed as\nmodels of bulk reconstruction via quantum error correcting codes; in certain\ncases, geodesics in the Bruhat--Tits tree reproduce those constructed using\nquantum error correction. Other aspects of holography also hold: Standard\nholographic results for massive free scalar fields in a fixed background carry\nover to the tree, whose vertical direction can be interpreted as a\nrenormalization-group scale for modes in the boundary CFT. Higher-genus bulk\ngeometries (the BTZ black hole and its generalizations) can be understood\nstraightforwardly in our setting, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the\nentanglement entropy appears naturally.\n", "  We obtain the multiple-parameter quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound for estimating\nthe transverse Cartesian components of the centroid and separation of two\nincoherent optical point sources using an imaging system with finite spatial\nbandwidth. Under quite general and realistic assumptions on the point-spread\nfunction of the imaging system, and for weak source strengths, we show that the\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds for the $x$ and $y$ components of the separation are\nindependent of the values of those components, which may be well below the\nconventional Rayleigh resolution limit. We also propose two linear optics-based\nmeasurement methods that approach the quantum bound for the estimation of the\nCartesian components of the separation once the centroid has been located. One\nof the methods is an interferometric scheme that approaches the quantum bound\nfor sub-Rayleigh separations. The other method using fiber coupling can in\nprinciple attain the bound regardless of the distance between the two sources.\n", "  We investigate equilibrium statistical properties of the quantum XY spin-1/2\nmodel in an external magnetic field when the interaction and field parts are\nsubjected to quenched or/and annealed disorder. The randomness present in the\nsystem are termed annealed or quenched depending on the relation between two\ndifferent time scales - the time scale associated with the equilibriation of\nthe randomness and the time of observation. Within a mean-field framework, we\nstudy the effects of disorders on spontaneous magnetization, both by\nperturbative and numerical techniques. Our primary interest is to understand\nthe differences between quenched and annealed cases, and also to investigate\nthe interplay when both of them are present in a system. We observe in\nparticular that when interaction and field terms are respectively quenched and\nannealed, critical temperature for the system to magnetize in the direction\nparallel to the applied field does not depend on any of the disorders. Further,\nan annealed disordered interaction neither affects the magnetizations nor the\ncritical temperatures. We carry out a comparative study of the different\ncombinations of the disorders in the interaction and field terms, and point out\ntheir generic features.\n", "  To date, the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) onboard Swift has detected ~ 1000\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs), of which ~ 360 GRBs have redshift measurements,\nranging from z = 0.03 to z = 9.38. We present the analyses of the BAT-detected\nGRBs for the past ~ 11 years up through GRB151027B. We report summaries of both\nthe temporal and spectral analyses of the GRB characteristics using event data\n(i.e., data for each photon within approximately 250 s before and 950 s after\nthe BAT trigger time), and discuss the instrumental sensitivity and selection\neffects of GRB detections. We also explore the GRB properties with redshift\nwhen possible. The result summaries and data products are available at\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/batgrbcat/index.html . In addition, we\nperform searches for GRB emissions before or after the event data using the BAT\nsurvey data. We estimate the false detection rate to be only one false\ndetection in this sample. There are 15 ultra-long GRBs (~ 2% of the BAT GRBs)\nin this search with confirmed emission beyond ~ 1000 s of event data, and only\ntwo GRBs (GRB100316D and GRB101024A) with detections in the survey data prior\nto the starting of event data.\n  (Some figures shown here are in lower resolution due to the size limit on\narXiv. The full resolution version can be found at\nhttp://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/batgrbcat/3rdBATcatalog.pdf )\n", "  We demonstrate the breakdown of molecular-frame dynamics induced by the\nuncoupling of molecular rotation from electronic motion in molecular Rydberg\nstates. We observe this non-Born-Oppenheimer regime in the time domain through\nphotoelectron imaging of a coherent molecular Rydberg wave packet in\n$\\textrm{N}_2$. The photoelectron angular distribution shows a radically\ndifferent time evolution than that of a typical molecular-frame-fixed electron\norbital, revealing the uncoupled motion of the electron as it precesses around\nthe $averaged$ anisotropic potential of the rotating ion-core.\n", "  We report the room-temperature electroluminescence (EL) with nearly pure\ncircular polarization (CP) from GaAs-based spin-polarized light-emitting diodes\n(spin-LEDs). External magnetic fields are not used during device operation.\nThere are two small schemes in the tested spin-LEDs: firstly, the\nstripe-laser-like structure that helps intensifying the EL light at the cleaved\nside walls below the spin injector Fe slab, and secondly, the crystalline AlOx\nspin tunnel barrier that ensures electrically stable device operation. The\npurity of CP is depressively low in the low current density (J) region, whereas\nit increases steeply and reaches close to the pure CP when J = 100 A/cm2.\nThere, either right- or left-handed CP component is significantly suppressed\ndepending on the direction of magnetization of the spin injector.\nSpin-dependent re-absorption, spin-induced birefringence and optical spin-axis\nconversion are suggested to account for the observed experimental results.\n", "  By defining an appropriate field line helicity, we apply the powerful concept\nof magnetic helicity to the problem of global magnetic field evolution in the\nSun's corona. As an ideal-magnetohydrodynamic invariant, the field line\nhelicity is a meaningful measure of how magnetic helicity is distributed within\nthe coronal volume. It may be interpreted, for each magnetic field line, as a\nmagnetic flux linking with that field line. Using magneto-frictional\nsimulations, we investigate how field line helicity evolves in the\nnon-potential corona as a result of shearing by large-scale motions on the\nsolar surface. On open magnetic field lines, the helicity injected by the Sun\nis largely output to the solar wind, provided that the coronal relaxation is\nsufficiently fast. But on closed magnetic field lines, helicity is able to\nbuild up. We find that the field line helicity is non-uniformly distributed,\nand is highly concentrated in twisted magnetic flux ropes. Eruption of these\nflux ropes is shown to lead to sudden bursts of helicity output, in contrast to\nthe steady flux along the open magnetic field lines.\n", "  Anomalous non-exponential relaxation in hydrated biomolecules is commonly\nattributed to the complexity of the free-energy landscapes, similarly to\npolymers and glasses. It was found recently that the hydrogen-bond breathing of\nterminal DNA base pairs exhibits a slow power-law relaxation attributable to\nweak Hamiltonian chaos, with parameters similar to experimental data. Here, the\nrelationship is studied between this motion and spectroscopic signals measured\nin DNA with a small molecular photoprobe inserted into the base-pair stack. To\nthis end, the earlier computational approach in combination with an analytical\ntheory is applied to the experimental DNA fragment. It is found that the\nintensity of breathing dynamics is strongly increased in the internal base\npairs that flank the photoprobe, with anomalous relaxation quantitatively close\nto that in terminal base pairs. A physical mechanism is proposed to explain the\ncoupling between the relaxation of base-pair breathing and the experimental\nresponse signal. It is concluded that the algebraic relaxation observed\nexperimentally is very likely a manifestation of weakly chaotic dynamics of\nhydrogen-bond breathing in the base pairs stacked to the photoprobe, and that\nthe weak nanoscale chaos can represent an ubiquitous hidden source of\nnon-exponential relaxation in ultrafast spectroscopy.\n", "  We prove the global-in-time existence of large-data finite-energy weak\nsolutions to an incompressible hybrid Vlasov-magnetohydrodynamic model in three\nspace dimensions. The model couples three essential ingredients of magnetized\nplasmas: a transport equation for the probability density function, which\nmodels energetic rarefied particles of one species; the incompressible\nNavier--Stokes system for the bulk fluid; and a parabolic evolution equation,\ninvolving magnetic diffusivity, for the magnetic field. The physical derivation\nof our model is given. It is also shown that the weak solution, whose existence\nis established, has nonincreasing total energy, and that it satisfies a number\nof physically relevant properties, including conservation of the total\nmomentum, conservation of the total mass, and nonnegativity of the probability\ndensity function for the energetic particles. The proof is based on a one-level\napproximation scheme, which is carefully devised to avoid increase of the total\nenergy for the sequence of approximating solutions, in conjunction with a weak\ncompactness argument for the sequence of approximating solutions. The key\ntechnical challenges in the analysis of the mathematical model are the\nnondissipative nature of the Vlasov-type particle equation and passage to the\nweak limits in the multilinear coupling terms.\n", "  Recently, a theoretical framework aimed at separating the roles of dynamics\nand topology in multi-dimensional systems has been developed (Gao et al,\n\\textit{Nature}, Vol 530:307 (2016)). The validity of their method is assumed\nto hold depending on two main hypothesis: $(i)$ The network determined by the\nthe interaction between pairs of nodes has negligible degree correlations;\n$(ii)$ The node activities are uniform across nodes on both the drift and\npair-wise interaction functions. Moreover, the authors consider only positive\n(mutualistic) interactions. Here we show the conditions proposed by Gao and\ncollaborators are neither sufficient nor necessary to guarantee that their\nmethod works in general, and validity of their results are not independent of\nthe model chosen within the class of dynamics they considered. Indeed we find\nthat a new condition poses effective limitations to their framework and we\nprovide quantitative predictions of the quality of the one dimensional collapse\nas a function of the properties of interaction networks and stable dynamics\nusing results from random matrix theory. We also find that multi-dimensional\nreduction may work also for interaction matrix with a mixture of positive and\nnegative signs, opening up application of the framework to food-webs, neuronal\nnetworks and social/economic interactions.\n", "  Following a program on black hole nonmodal linear stability initiated in\nPhys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 112} (2014) 191101, we study odd linear perturbations\nof the Einstein-Maxwell equations around a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (A)dS black\nhole. We show that all the gauge invariant information in the metric and\nMaxwell field perturbations is encoded in the spacetime scalars $\\mathcal{F}\n=\\delta (F^*_{\\alpha \\beta} F^{\\alpha \\beta})$ and $\\mathcal{Q} =\\delta\n(\\tfrac{1}{48} C^*_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta} C^{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma\n\\delta})$, where $C_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta}$ is the Weyl tensor,\n$F_{\\alpha \\beta}$ the Maxwell field, a star denotes Hodge dual and $\\delta$\nmeans first order variation, and that the linearized Einstein-Maxwell equations\nare equivalent to a coupled system of wave equations for $\\mathcal{F}$ and\n$\\mathcal{Q}$. For nonnegative cosmological constant we prove that\n$\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$ are pointwise bounded on the outer static\nregion. The fields are shown to diverge as the Cauchy horizon is approached\nfrom the inner dynamical region, providing evidence supporting strong cosmic\ncensorship. In the asymptotically AdS case the dynamics depends on the boundary\ncondition at the conformal timelike boundary and there are instabilities if\nRobin boundary conditions are chosen.\n", "  Controlling a complex network towards a desire state is of great importance\nin many applications. Existing works present an approximate algorithm to find\nthe driver nodes used to control partial nodes of the network. However, the\ndriver nodes obtained by this algorithm depend on the matching order of nodes\nand cannot get the optimum results. Here we present a novel algorithm to find\nthe driver nodes for target control based on preferential matching. The\nalgorithm elaborately arrange the matching order of nodes in order to minimize\nthe size of the driver nodes set. The results on both synthetic and real\nnetworks indicate that the performance of proposed algorithm are better than\nthe previous one. The algorithm may have various application in controlling\ncomplex networks.\n", "  Out of nearly 70,000 bills introduced in the U.S. Congress from 2001 to 2015,\nonly 2,513 were enacted. We developed a machine learning approach to\nforecasting the probability that any bill will become law. Starting in 2001\nwith the 107th Congress, we trained models on data from previous Congresses,\npredicted all bills in the current Congress, and repeated until the 113th\nCongress served as the test. For prediction we scored each sentence of a bill\nwith a language model that embeds legislative vocabulary into a\nhigh-dimensional, semantic-laden vector space. This language representation\nenables our investigation into which words increase the probability of\nenactment for any topic. To test the relative importance of text and context,\nwe compared the text model to a context-only model that uses variables such as\nwhether the bill's sponsor is in the majority party. To test the effect of\nchanges to bills after their introduction on our ability to predict their final\noutcome, we compared using the bill text and meta-data available at the time of\nintroduction with using the most recent data. At the time of introduction\ncontext-only predictions outperform text-only, and with the newest data\ntext-only outperforms context-only. Combining text and context always performs\nbest. We conducted a global sensitivity analysis on the combined model to\ndetermine important variables predicting enactment.\n", "  We present a novel implementation of supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nformation, dynamics, and accretion in the massively parallel tree+SPH code,\nChaNGa. This approach improves the modeling of SMBHs in fully cosmological\nsimulations, allowing for a more de- tailed analysis of SMBH-galaxy\nco-evolution throughout cosmic time. Our scheme includes novel, physically\nmotivated models for SMBH formation, dynamics and sinking timescales within\ngalaxies, and SMBH accretion of rotationally supported gas. The sub-grid\nparameters that regulate star formation (SF) and feedback from SMBHs and SNe\nare optimized against a comprehensive set of z = 0 galaxy scaling relations\nusing a novel, multi-dimensional parameter search. We have incorporated our new\nSMBH implementation and parameter optimization into a new set of high\nresolution, large-scale cosmological simulations called Romulus. We present\ninitial results from our flagship simulation, Romulus25, showing that our SMBH\nmodel results in SF efficiency, SMBH masses, and global SF and SMBH accretion\nhistories at high redshift that are consistent with observations. We discuss\nthe importance of SMBH physics in shaping the evolution of massive galaxies and\nshow how SMBH feedback is much more effective at regulating star formation\ncompared to SNe feedback in this regime. Further, we show how each aspect of\nour SMBH model impacts this evolution compared to more common approaches.\nFinally, we present a science application of this scheme studying the\nproperties and time evolution of an example dual AGN system, highlighting how\nour approach allows simulations to better study galaxy interactions and SMBH\nmergers in the context of galaxy-BH co-evolution.\n", "  Quantitative characterization of bacterial growth has gathered substantial\nattention since Monod's pioneering study. Theoretical and experimental work has\nuncovered several laws for describing the log growth phase, in which the number\nof cells grows exponentially. However, microorganism growth also exhibits lag,\nstationary, and death phases under starvation conditions, in which cell growth\nis highly suppressed, while quantitative laws or theories for such phases are\nunderdeveloped. In fact, models commonly adopted for the log phase that consist\nof autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show\nexponential growth or decay in a population, and phases that halt growth are\nnot realized. Here, we propose a simple, coarse-grained cell model that\nincludes inhibitor molecule species in addition to the autocatalytic active\nprotein. The inhibitor forms a complex with active proteins to suppress the\ncatalytic process. Depending on the nutrient condition, the model exhibits the\ntypical transition among the lag, log, stationary, and death phases.\nFurthermore, the lag time needed for growth recovery after starvation follows\nthe square root of the starvation time and is inverse to the maximal growth\nrate, in agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the distribution\nof lag time among cells shows an exponential tail, also consistent with\nexperiments. Our theory further predicts strong dependence of lag time upon the\nspeed of substrate depletion, which should be examined experimentally. The\npresent model and theoretical analysis provide universal growth laws beyond the\nlog phase, offering insight into how cells halt growth without entering the\ndeath phase.\n", "  We consider a two-orbital impurity system with intra and inter-level Coulomb\nrepulsion that is coupled to a single conduction channel. This situation can\ngenerically occur in multilevel quantum dots or in systems of coupled quantum\ndots. For finite energy-spacing between spin-degenerate orbitals, an in-plane\nmagnetic field drives the system from a local singlet ground state to a\n\"mixed-level\" Kondo regime, where the Zeeman-split levels are degenerate for\nopposite spin states. We use the numerical renormalization group approach to\nfully characterize this mixed level Kondo state and discuss its properties in\nterms of the applied Zeeman field, temperature and system parameters. Under\nsuitable conditions, the total spectral function is shown to develop a Fermi\nlevel resonance, so that the linear conductance of the system peaks at a finite\nZeeman field while it decreases as function of temperature. These features, as\nwell as the local moment and entropy contribution of the impurity system are\ncommensurate with Kondo physics, which can be studied in suitably tuned quantum\ndot systems.\n", "  In this letter we introduce a novel approach to Hamiltonian tomography of\nnon-interacting tight-binding photonic lattices. To begin with, we prove that\nthe matrix element of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian between sites $i$\nand $j$ may be obtained directly from $S_{ij}(\\omega)$, the (suitably\nnormalized) two-port measurement between sites $i$ and $j$ at frequency\n$\\omega$. This general result enables complete characterization of both on-site\nenergies and tunneling matrix elements in arbitrary lattice networks by\nspectroscopy, and suggests that coupling between lattice sites is actually a\ntopological property of the two-port spectrum. We further provide extensions of\nthis technique for measurement of band-projectors in finite, disordered systems\nwith good flatness ratios, and apply the tool to direct real-space measurement\nof the Chern number. Our approach demonstrates the extraordinary potential of\nmicrowave quantum circuits for exploration of exotic synthetic materials,\nproviding a clear path to characterization and control of single-particle\nproperties of Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard lattices. More broadly, we provide a\nrobust, unified method of spectroscopic characterization of linear networks\nfrom photonic crystals to microwave lattices and everything in-between.\n", "  We numerically simulate collisions of charged shockwaves in Einstein-Maxwell\ntheory in anti-de Sitter space as a toy model of heavy ion collisions with\nnon-zero baryon charge. The stress tensor and the baryon current become well\ndescribed by charged hydrodynamics at roughly the same time. The effect of the\ncharge density on generic observables is typically no larger than 15\\%. %The\nrapidity profile of the charge is wider than the profile of the local energy\ndensity. We find significant stopping of the baryon charge and compare our\nresults with those in heavy ion collision experiments.\n", "  Quantum lossy left-handed transmission lines (LHTLs) are central to the\nminiaturized application in microwave band. This work discusses the NRI of the\nquantized lossy LHTLs in the presence of the resistance and the conductance in\na displaced squeezed Fock state (DSFS). And the results show some novel\nspecific quantum characteristics of NRI caused by the DSFS and dissipation,\nwhich may be significant for its miniaturized application in a suit of novel\nmicrowave devices.\n", "  The quantum hydrodynamic theory is a promising method for describing\nmicroscopic details of macroscopic systems. The hydrodynamic equation can be\ndirectly obtained from a single particle Kohn-Sham equation that includes the\ncontribution of an external vector potential. This derivation allows to\nstraightforwardly incorporate in the hydrodynamic equation an\nexchange-correlation viscoelastic term, so that broadening of collective\nexcitation can be taken into account, as well as a correction to the plasmon\ndispersion. The result is an accurate self-consistent and computationally\nefficient hydrodynamic description of the free electron gas. A very accurate\nagreement with full quantum calculations is shown.\n", "  Superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW), resonators are powerful and\nversatile tools used in areas ranging from radiation detection to circuit\nquantum electrodynamics. Their potential for low intrinsic losses makes them\nattractive as sensitive probes of electronic properties of bulk materials and\nthin films. Here we use superconducting MoRe CPW resonators, to investigate the\nhigh-frequency (up to 0.3 GHz) and low temperature (down to 3.5 K) permittivity\nof SrTiO3, a non-linear dielectric on the verge of a ferroelectric transition\n(quantum paraelectricity). We perform a quantitative analysis of its dielectric\nproperties as a function of external dc bias (up to +-15V), rf power and mode\nnumber and discuss our results within the framework of the most recent\ntheoretical models. We also discuss the origin of a fatigue effect that reduces\nthe tunability of the dielectric constant of SrTiO3, which we relate to the\npresence of oxygen vacancies.\n", "  We investigate the optical and Wide-field Survey Explorer (WISE) colors of\n\"E+A\" identified post-starburst galaxies, including a deep analysis on 190\npost-starbursts detected in the 2{\\mu}m All Sky Survey Extended Source Catalog.\nThe post-starburst galaxies appear in both the optical green valley and the\nWISE Infrared Transition Zone (IRTZ). Furthermore, we find that post-starbursts\noccupy a distinct region [3.4]-[4.6] vs. [4.6]-[12] WISE colors, enabling the\nidentification of this class of transitioning galaxies through the use of\nbroad-band photometric criteria alone. We have investigated possible causes for\nthe WISE colors of post-starbursts by constructing a composite spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), finding that mid-infrared (4-12{\\mu}m) properties of\npost-starbursts are consistent with either 11.3{\\mu}m polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon emission, or Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB)\nand post-AGB stars. The composite SED of extended post- starburst galaxies with\n22{\\mu}m emission detected with signal to noise >3 requires a hot dust\ncomponent to produce their observed rising mid-infrared SED between 12 and\n22{\\mu}m. The composite SED of WISE 22{\\mu}m non-detections (S/N<3), created by\nstacking 22{\\mu}m images, is also flat, requiring a hot dust component. The\nmost likely source of this mid-infrared emission of these E+A galaxies is a\nburied active galactic nucleus. The inferred upper limit to the Eddington\nratios of post-starbursts are 1e-2 to 1e-4, with an average of 1e-3. This\nsuggests that AGNs are not radiatively dominant in these systems. This could\nmean that including selections able to identify active galactic nuclei as part\nof a search for transitioning and post-starburst galaxies would create a more\ncomplete census of the transition pathways taken as a galaxy quenches its star\nformation.\n", "  We provide the first observational constraints on the sizes of the faintest\ngalaxies lensed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. Ionizing\nradiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF\ninitiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot\nreally assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their\nsizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end\nslope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size\nconstraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the\ndetectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very\ndependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain\ndetectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low\nshear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably,\nhowever, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies\nand the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu>10 z~2-8 galaxies\nseen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint\n(~-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We\nconstrain their half-light radii to be <~30 mas (<160-240 pc). As a 2nd size\nprobe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major\nshear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic\nhalf-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely\nfaint z~2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset\n(half-light radii conservatively <30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results\nsuggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities\nfor faint z~2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived\nin many recent studies (by factors of ~2-3 and by dalpha>~0.1-0.3).\n", "  We introduce the concept of spatio-temporal steering (STS), which reduces, in\nspecial cases, to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and the recently-introduced\ntemporal steering. We describe two measures of this effect referred to as the\nSTS weight and robustness. We suggest that these STS measures enable a new way\nto assess nonclassical correlations in an open quantum network, such as quantum\ntransport through nano-structures or excitation transfer in a complex\nbiological system. As one of our examples, we apply STS to check nonclassical\ncorrelations among sites in a photosynthetic pigment-protein complex in the\nFenna-Matthews-Olson model.\n", "  Electrically-detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) provides a highly sensitive\nmethod for reading out the state of donor spins in silicon. The technique\nrelies on a spin-dependent recombination (SDR) process involving dopant spins\nthat are coupled to interfacial defect spins near the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. To\nprevent ionization of the donors, the experiments are performed at cryogenic\ntemperatures and the mobile charge carriers needed are generated via optical\nexcitation. The influence of this optical excitation on the SDR process and the\nresulting EDMR signal is still not well understood. Here, we use EDMR to\ncharacterize changes to both phosphorus and defect spin readout as a function\nof optical excitation using: a 980 nm laser with energy just above the silicon\nband edge at cryogenic temperatures; a 405 nm laser to generate hot\nsurface-carriers; and a broadband white light source. EDMR signals are observed\nfrom the phosphorus donor and two distinct defect species in all the\nexperiments. With near-infrared excitation, we find that the EDMR signal\nprimarily arises from donor-defect pairs, while at higher photon energies there\nare significant additional contributions from defect-defect pairs. The optical\npenetration depth into silicon is also known to be strongly wavelength\ndependent at cryogenic temperatures. The energy of the optical excitation is\nobserved to strongly modulate the kinetics of the SDR process. Careful tuning\nof the optical photon energy could therefore be used to control both the subset\nof spin pairs contributing to the EDMR signal as well as the dynamics of the\nSDR process.\n", "  Understanding the interplay of order and disorder in chaotic systems is a\ncentral challenge in modern quantitative science. We present a universal,\ndata-driven decomposition of chaos as an intermittently forced linear system.\nThis work combines Takens' delay embedding with modern Koopman operator theory\nand sparse regression to obtain linear representations of strongly nonlinear\ndynamics. The result is a decomposition of chaotic dynamics into a linear model\nin the leading delay coordinates with forcing by low energy delay coordinates;\nwe call this the Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) analysis. This\nanalysis is applied to the canonical Lorenz system, as well as to real-world\nexamples such as the Earth's magnetic field reversal, and data from\nelectrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and measles outbreaks. In each case,\nthe forcing statistics are non-Gaussian, with long tails corresponding to rare\nevents that trigger intermittent switching and bursting phenomena; this forcing\nis highly predictive, providing a clear signature that precedes these events.\nMoreover, the activity of the forcing signal demarcates large coherent regions\nof phase space where the dynamics are approximately linear from those that are\nstrongly nonlinear.\n", "  Next place prediction algorithms are invaluable tools, capable of increasing\nthe efficiency of a wide variety of tasks, ranging from reducing the spreading\nof diseases to better resource management in areas such as urban planning. In\nthis work we estimate upper and lower limits on the predictability of human\nmobility to help assess the performance of competing algorithms. We do this\nusing GPS traces from 604 individuals participating in a multi year long\nexperiment, The Copenhagen Networks study. Earlier works, focusing on the\nprediction of a participant's whereabouts in the next time bin, have found very\nhigh upper limits (>90%). We show that these upper limits are highly dependent\non the choice of a spatiotemporal scales and mostly reflect stationarity, i.e.\nthe fact that people tend to not move during small changes in time. This leads\nus to propose an alternative approach, which aims to predict the next location,\nrather than the location in the next bin. Our approach is independent of the\ntemporal scale and introduces a natural length scale. By removing the effects\nof stationarity we show that the predictability of the next location is\nsignificantly lower (~71%) than the predictability of the location in the next\nbin.\n", "  The massive employment of computational models in network epidemiology calls\nfor the development of improved inference methods for epidemic forecast. For\nsimple compartment models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model,\nBelief Propagation was proved to be a reliable and efficient method to identify\nthe origin of an observed epidemics. Here we show that the same method can be\napplied to predict the future evolution of an epidemic outbreak from partial\nobservations at the early stage of the dynamics. The results obtained using\nBelief Propagation are compared with Monte Carlo direct sampling in the case of\nSIR model on random (regular and power-law) graphs for different observation\nmethods and on an example of real-world contact network. Belief Propagation\ngives in general a better prediction that direct sampling, although the quality\nof the prediction depends on the quantity under study (e.g. marginals of\nindividual states, epidemic size, extinction-time distribution) and on the\nactual number of observed nodes that are infected before the observation time.\n", "  The fundamental energy gap of a periodic solid distinguishes insulators from\nmetals and characterizes low-energy single-electron excitations. But the gap in\nthe band-structure of the exact multiplicative Kohn-Sham (KS) potential\nsubstantially underestimates the fundamental gap, a major limitation of KS\ndensity functional theory. Here we give a simple proof of a new theorem: In\ngeneralized KS theory (GKS), the band gap of an extended system equals the\nfundamental gap for the approximate functional if the GKS potential operator is\ncontinuous and the density change is delocalized when an electron or hole is\nadded. Our theorem explains how GKS band gaps from meta-generalized gradient\napproximations (meta-GGAs) and hybrid functionals can be more realistic than\nthose from GGAs or even from the exact KS potential. The theorem also follows\nfrom earlier work. The band edges in the GKS one-electron spectrum are also\nrelated to measurable energies. A linear chain of hydrogen molecules, solid\naluminum arsenide, and solid argon provide numerical illustrations.\n", "  We study the structure formation by investigating the spherical collapse\nmodel in the context of new agegraphic dark energy model in flat FRW cosmology.\nWe compute the perturbational quantities $g(a)$, $\\delta_{c}(z_{c})$,\n$\\lambda(z_{c})$, $\\xi(z_{c})$, $\\Delta_{vir}(z_{c})$, $\\log[\\nu f(\\nu)]$ and\n$\\log[n(k)]$ for the new agegraphic dark energy model and compare the results\nwith those of EdS and $\\Lambda CDM$ models. We find that there is a dark energy\ndominated universe at low redshifts and a matter dominated universe at high\nredshifts in agreement with observations. Also, the size of structures, the\noverdense spherical region, and the halo size in the new agegraphic dark energy\nmodel are found smaller, denser, and larger than those of EdS and $\\Lambda CDM$\nmodels. We compare our results with the results of tachyon scalar field and\nholographic dark energy models.\n", "  Dimensionality plays an essential role in determining the anomalous non-Fermi\nliquid properties in heavy fermion systems. So far most heavy fermion compounds\nare quasi-two-dimensional or three-dimensional. Here we report the synthesis\nand systematic investigations of the single crystals of the\nquasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$. Resistivity measurements at\nambient pressure reveal the onset of coherence at $T^*\\approx 20\\,$K and\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior with linear temperature dependence over a decade in\ntemperature from 2 K to 0.1 K. The specific heat increases logarithmically with\nlowering temperature between 10 K and 2 K and reaches 800 mJ/mol K$^2$ at 1 K,\nsuggesting that CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ is a heavy fermion compound in the close\nvicinity of a quantum critical point. Resistivity measurements under pressure\nfurther confirm the non-Fermi liquid behavior in a large temperature-pressure\nrange. The magnetic susceptibility is found to follow the typical behavior for\na one-dimensional (1D) spin chain from 300 K down to $T^*$, and\nfirst-principles calculations predict flat Fermi surfaces for the itinerant\n$f$-electron bands. These suggest that CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ is a rare example of the\nquasi-1D Kondo lattice, but its non-Fermi liquid behaviors resemble those of\nthe quasi-two-dimensional YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ family. The study of the\nquasi-one-dimensional CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ family may therefore help us to understand\nthe role of dimensionality on heavy fermion physics and quantum criticality.\n", "  A theoretical justification of the empirical surface hopping method for the\nlaser-driven molecular dynamics is given utilizing the formalism of the exact\nfactorization of the molecular wavefunction [Abedi et al., PRL $\\textbf{105}$,\n123002 (2010)] in its quantum-classical limit. Employing an exactly solvable\n$\\textrm H_2^{\\;+}$-like model system, it is shown that the deterministic\nclassical nuclear motion on a single time-dependent surface in this approach\ndescribes the same physics as stochastic (hopping-induced) motion on several\nsurfaces, provided Floquet surfaces are applied. Both quantum-classical methods\ndo describe reasonably well the exact nuclear wavepacket dynamics for extremely\ndifferent dissociation scenarios. Hopping schemes using Born-Oppenheimer\nsurfaces or instantaneous Born-Oppenheimer surfaces fail completely.\n", "  Understanding the structural origins of the properties of amorphous materials\nremains one of the most important challenges in structural science. In this\nstudy we demonstrate that local 'structural simplicity', embodied by the degree\nto which atomic environments within a material are similar to each other, is\npowerful concept for rationalising the structure of canonical amorphous\nmaterial amorphous silicon (a-Si). We show, by restraining a reverse Monte\nCarlo refinement against pair distribution function (PDF) data to be simpler,\nthat the simplest model consistent with the PDF is a continuous random network\n(CRN). A further effect of producing a simple model of a-Si is the generation\nof a (pseudo)gap in the electronic density of states, suggesting that\nstructural homogeneity drives electronic homogeneity. That this method produces\nmodels of a-Si that approach the state-of-the-art without the need for\nchemically specific restraints (beyond the assumption of homogeneity) suggests\nthat simplicity-based refinement approaches may allow experiment-driven\nstructural modelling techniques to be developed for the wide variety of\namorphous semiconductors with strong local order.\n", "  Hybrid molecular-plasmonic nanostructures have demonstrated their potential\nfor surface enhanced spectroscopies, sensing or quantum control at the\nnanoscale. In this work, we investigate the strong coupling regime and\nexplicitly describe the hybridization between the localized plasmons of a metal\nnanoparticle and the excited state of a quantum emitter, offering a simple and\nprecise understanding of the energy exchange in full analogy with cavity\nquantum electrodynamics treatment and dressed atom picture. Both near field\nemission and far field radiation are discussed, revealing the richness of such\noptical nanosources.\n", "  Predictions and comparisons of hadronic flow observables for Pb+Pb collisions\nat 2.76 A TeV and 5.02 A TeV are presented using a hydrodynamics + hadronic\ncascade hybrid approach. Initial conditions are generated via a new formulation\nof the IP-Glasma model and then evolved using relativistic viscous\nhydrodynamics and finally fed into transport cascade in the hadronic phase. The\nresults of this work show excellent agreement with the recent charged hadron\nanisotropic flow measurements from the ALICE collaboration of Pb+Pb collisions\nat 5.02 A TeV. Event-by-event distributions of charged hadron v n , flow\nevent-plane correlations, and flow factorization breaking ratios are compared\nwith existing measurements at 2.76 A TeV, and are predicted at 5.02 A TeV.\nFurther predictions of identified hadron observables (for both light and\nmulti-strange hadrons), such as p T -spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients,\nare presented.\n", "  The Lam-Tung relation breaking coefficient $A_{\\mathrm{LT}} = A_0 - A_2$ in\nthe Drell-Yan dilepton angular distributions in the $Z^0$ boson mass region at\nthe LHC is analyzed in the $k_T$-factorization approach. This observable was\nrecently measured with high precision by ATLAS collaboration. Within the\n$k_T$-factorization approach we perform an approximate ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{em}}\\alpha_s^2)$ calculation of the off-shell parton hard\nmatrix elements in which we include the leading tree level contributions of\nvalence quarks and off-shell gluons: the $q_{\\mathrm{val}} g^* \\to qZ^0$\nchannel and the $g^*g^* \\to q\\bar q Z^0$ channel. The resulting\n$A_{\\mathrm{LT}}$ exhibits high sensitivity to the gluon transverse momentum\ndistribution (TMD). Several gluon TMDs are probed derived from the CCFM and\nBFKL evolution equations, and given by QCD-inspired phenomenological\nparameterizations. The ATLAS data favor a simple \"Weizs\\\"acker-Williams\" (WW)\nhard gluon TMD with the asymptotic behavior of one-gluon exchange at large\ngluon transverse momenta and moderate $x$. It is verified that the proposed\napproach with the WW gluon TMD describes well also the $A_0$ and $A_2$ angular\ncoefficients at the $Z^0$ peak, as well as the Drell-Yan dilepton mass\ndistribution at lower masses. We conclude that inclusion of gluon transverse\nmomentum effects improves description of the angular distributions of Drell-Yan\ndileptons and that the Drell-Yan scattering provides an excellent probe of the\nparton TMDs.\n", "  We propose a practical effective model by introducing temperature ($T$)\ndependence to the coupling strengths of four-quark and six-quark\nKobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft interactions in the 2+1 flavor Polyakov-loop\nextended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The $T$ dependence is determined from LQCD\ndata on the renormalized chiral condensate around the pseudocritical\ntemperature $T_c^{\\chi}$ of chiral crossover and the screening-mass difference\nbetween $\\pi$ and $a_0$ mesons in $T > 1.1T_c^\\chi$ where only the $U(1)_{\\rm\nA}$-symmetry breaking survives. The model well reproduces LQCD data on\nscreening masses $M_{\\xi}^{\\rm scr}(T)$ for both scalar and pseudoscalar\nmesons, particularly in $T \\ge T_c^{\\chi}$. Using this effective model, we\npredict meson pole masses $M_{\\xi}^{\\rm pole}(T)$ for scalar and pseudoscalar\nmesons. For $\\eta'$ meson, the prediction is consistent with the experimental\nvalue at finite $T$ measured in heavy-ion collisions. We point out that the\nrelation $M_{\\xi}^{\\rm scr}(T)-M_{\\xi}^{\\rm pole}(T) \\approx M_{\\xi'}^{\\rm\nscr}(T)-M_{\\xi'}^{\\rm pole}(T)$ is pretty good when $\\xi$ and $\\xi'$ are scalar\nmesons, and show that the relation $M_{\\xi}^{\\rm scr}(T)/M_{\\xi'}^{\\rm scr}(T)\n\\approx M_{\\xi}^{\\rm pole}(T)/M_{\\xi'}^{\\rm pole}(T)$ is well satisfied within\n20% error when $\\xi$ and $\\xi'$ are pseudoscalar mesons and also when $\\xi$ and\n$\\xi'$ are scalar mesons.\n", "  Neutrino masses and the number of light neutrino species can be tested in a\nvariety of laboratory experiments and also can be constrained by particle\nastrophysics and precision cosmology. A conflict between these various results\ncould be an indication of new physics in the neutrino sector. In this paper we\nexplore the possibility for reconciliation of otherwise discrepant results in a\nsimple model containing a light scalar field which produces Mass Varying\nNeutrinos (MaVaNs). We extend previous work on MaVaNs to consider issues of\nneutrino clumping, the effects of additional contributions to neutrino mass,\nand reconciliation of eV mass sterile neutrinos with cosmology.\n", "  Deformations of single-wall carbon nanotubes are investigated within the\ntight-binding model with deformation-dependent hopping energies. We show that\nthe nanotubes tend to twist and shrink spontaneously at zero temperature. The\nexplicit values of the deformation parameters are computed for a wide range of\nnanotubes with varying diameter and chirality. The changes of the spectral gap\nassociated with the spontaneous deformation are shown to depend on the\nchirality of the nanotubes.\n", "  We present an agent based model of the Air Traffic Management socio-technical\ncomplex system that aims at modeling the interactions between aircrafts and air\ntraffic controllers at a tactical level. The core of the model is given by the\nconflict detection and resolution module and by the directs module. Directs are\nflight shortcuts that are given by air controllers to speed up the passage of\nan aircraft within a certain airspace and therefore to facilitate airline\noperations. Conflicts resolution between flight trajectories can arise during\nthe en-route phase of each flight due to both not detailed flight trajectory\nplanning or unforeseen events that perturb the planned flight plan. Our model\nperforms a local conflict detection and resolution procedure. Once a flight\ntrajectory has been made conflict-free, the model searches for possible\nimprovements of the system efficiency by issuing directs. We give an example of\nmodel calibration based on real data. We then provide an illustration of the\ncapability of our model in generating scenario simulations able to give\ninsights about the air traffic management system. We show that the calibrated\nmodel is able to reproduce the existence of a geographical localization of air\ntraffic controllers' operations. Finally, we use the model to investigate the\nrelationship between directs and conflict resolutions (i) in the presence of\nperfect forecast ability of controllers, and (ii) in the presence of some\ndegree of uncertainty in flight trajectory forecast.\n", "  We report and provide justification for the consistently observed four\nexperimental facts of the mass spectrometric data of carbon cluster emission\nfrom the low-energy Cs irradiated single-walled carbon nanotubes . Firstly, the\ndiatomic carbon C(2) is the most abundant sputtered species for Cs+ in the\nenergy range 0.2 keV to 2.0 keV. Secondly, monatomic carbon C(1) is emitted\nwith the least sputtering yield. Thirdly, at low cesium energies i the emitted\nspecies are C(2), C(3) and C(4). Lastly, as the irradiating Cs+ energy\nincreases, the normalized yield of atomic carbon monotonically increases while\nclusters show gradual decrease and saturation. Sputtering of clusters is proved\nhere to be due to thermal spikes. Binary collision cascade theory does not\nexplain cluster sputtering. A statistical thermal model is developed to explain\nthe experimentally observed data. The probability of a cluster C(x) to be\nemitted is shown to be proportional to that for the creation of an x-member\nvacancy with formation energy E at temperature T as {exp(E/kT)+1}^(-1). The\nenergies of formation of single and double vacancies from DFT calculations and\nthe ratio of normalized experimental yields have been used to estimate spike\ntemperature. We show that by invoking thermal spikes, cluster emission from,\nand the multiple vacancy generation in, the Cs+-irradiated SWCNTs can be\nexplained. We also suggest modifications to Monte Carlo type calculations of\nsputtering.\n", "  Thanks to their immense purity and controllability, dipolar Bose-Einstein\ncondensates are an exemplar for studying fundamental non-local nonlinear\nphysics. Here we show that a family of fundamental nonlinear waves - the dark\nsolitons - are supported in trapped quasi-one-dimensional dipolar condensates\nand within reach of current experiments. Remarkably, the oscillation frequency\nof the soliton is strongly dependent on the atomic interactions, in stark\ncontrast to the non-dipolar case. The failure of a particle analogy, so\nsuccessful for dark solitons in general, to account for this behaviour implies\nthat these structures are inherently extended and non-particle-like. These\nhighly-sensitive waves may act as mesoscopic probes of the underlying quantum\nmatter field.\n", "  We analyse the star formation rates (SFRs), colours, and dust extinctions of\ngalaxies in massive (10^12.5-10^13.5 Msun) haloes at z~2 in high-resolution,\ncosmological zoom-in simulations as part of the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project. The simulations do not model feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) but reproduce well the observed relations between stellar\nand halo mass and between stellar mass and SFR. About half (a third) of the\nsimulated massive galaxies (massive central galaxies) at z~2 have broad-band\ncolours classifying them as 'quiescent', and the fraction of quiescent centrals\nis steeply decreasing towards higher redshift, in agreement with observations.\nThe progenitors of z~2 quiescent central galaxies are, on average, more\nmassive, have lower specific SFRs, and reside in more massive haloes than the\nprogenitors of similarly massive star forming centrals. The simulations further\npredict a morphological mix of galaxies that includes disk-dominated,\nirregular, and early-type galaxies. However, our simulations do not reproduce\nthe reddest of the quiescent galaxies observed at z~2. We also do not find\nevidence for a colour bimodality, but are limited by our modest sample size. In\nour simulations, the star formation activity of central galaxies of moderate\nmass (Mstar~10^10-10^11 Msun) is affected by a combination of two distinct\nphysical processes. Outflows powered by stellar feedback result in a\nshort-lived (<100 Myr), but almost complete, suppression of star formation\nactivity after which many galaxies quickly recover and continue to form stars\nat normal rates. In addition, galaxies residing in slowly growing haloes tend\nto experience a moderate reduction of their SFRs ('cosmological starvation').\nThe relative importance of these processes and AGN feedback is uncertain and\nwill be explored in future work.\n", "  Network models of healthcare systems can be used to examine how providers\ncollaborate, communicate, refer patients to each other. Most healthcare service\nnetwork models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing\nclaims to link patients with providers. The data sets can be quite large,\nmaking standard methods for network construction computationally challenging\nand thus requiring the use of alternate construction algorithms. While these\nalternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks,\nthere is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural\nproperties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the\nproperties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and\nthe 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms\nwere compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks\nlinking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were\nbuilt using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with\nsubstantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a\npower law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff.\nCensoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common\nde-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge\nnumbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the\nbetweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel\nbetween network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the\nNortheast United States and Florida. We conclude that the choice of network\nconstruction algorithm is critical for healthcare network analysis, and discuss\nthe implications for selecting the algorithm best suited to the type of\nanalysis to be performed.\n", "  The canonical models for studying the unjamming scenario in systems of soft\nrepulsive particles assume pairwise potentials with a sharp cut-off in the\ninteraction range. The sharp cut-off renders the potential non-analytic, but\nmakes it possible to describe many properties of the solid in terms of the\ncoordination number $z$, which has an unambiguous definition in these cases.\nPairwise potentials without a sharp cut-off in the interaction range have not\nbeen considered in this context, but are of interest for understanding the\nrelevance of the unjamming phenomenology to systems in which such a cut-off\ncannot be assumed. In this work we explore two systems with such interactions:\nan inverse power law and an exponentially decaying pairwise potential, with the\ncontrol parameters being the exponent (of the inverse power-law) for the former\nand the number density for the latter. Both systems are shown to exhibit the\ncharacteristic features of the unjamming transition, among which are the\nvanishing of the shear to bulk modulus ratio and the emergence of an excess of\nlow-frequency vibrational modes. We establish a relation between the\nhydrostatic pressure to bulk modulus ratio and the distance to unjamming in\neach of our model systems. This allows us to predict the dependence of other\nkey observables on the distance to unjamming. Our results provide the means for\na quantitative estimation of the proximity of generic glass forming models to\nthe unjamming transition in the absence of a clear-cut definition of the\ncoordination number, and highlight the general irrelevance of nonaffine\ncontributions to the bulk modulus.\n", "  Even if the parameters determining a system's state are varied smoothly, the\nbehavior of quantum correlations alike to quantum discord, and of its classical\ncounterparts, can be very peculiar, with the appearance of non-analyticities in\nits rate of change. Here we review this sudden change phenomenon (SCP)\ndiscussing some important points related to it: Its uncovering,\ninterpretations, and experimental verifications, its use in the context of the\nemergence of the pointer basis in a quantum measurement process, its appearance\nand universality under Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, its theoretical\nand experimental investigation in some other physical scenarios, and the\nrelated phenomenon of double sudden change of trace distance discord. Several\nopen questions are identified, and we envisage that in answering them we will\ngain significant further insight about the relation between the SCP and the\nsymmetry-geometric aspects of the quantum state space.\n", "  We discuss dyonic black hole solutions in the case of $f(R)$-gravity coupled\nwith a dilaton and two gauge bosons. The study of such a model is highly\nmotivated from string theory. Our Black Hole solutions are extensions of the\none firstly studied by Kallosh, Linde, Ort\\'in, Peet and Van Proyen (KLOPV) in\n[arXiv:hep-th/9205027]. We will show that extreme solutions are unstable. In\nparticular, these solutions have Bousso-Hawking-Nojiri-Odintsov\n(anti)evaporation instabilities.\n", "  Continuum modelling of granular flow has been plagued with the issue of\nill-posed equations for a long time. Equations for incompressible,\ntwo-dimensional flow based on the Coulomb friction law are ill-posed regardless\nof the deformation, whereas the rate-dependent $\\mu(I)$-rheology is ill-posed\nwhen the non-dimensional strain-rate $I$ is too high or too low. Here,\nincorporating ideas from Critical-State Soil Mechanics, we derive conditions\nfor well-posedness of PDEs that combine compressibility with $I$-dependent\nrheology. When the $I$-dependence comes from a specific friction coefficient\n$\\mu(I)$, our results show that, with compressibility, the equations are\nwell-posed for all deformation rates provided that $\\mu(I)$ satisfies certain\nminimal, physically natural, inequalities.\n", "  We present an overview and first results of the Stratospheric Observatory For\nInfrared Astronomy Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Survey, which is using the\nFORCAST instrument to image massive protostars from\n$\\sim10$--$40\\:\\rm{\\mu}\\rm{m}$. These wavelengths trace thermal emission from\nwarm dust, which in Core Accretion models mainly emerges from the inner regions\nof protostellar outflow cavities. Dust in dense core envelopes also imprints\ncharacteristic extinction patterns at these wavelengths, causing intensity\npeaks to shift along the outflow axis and profiles to become more symmetric at\nlonger wavelengths. We present observational results for the first eight\nprotostars in the survey, i.e., multiwavelength images, including some\nancillary ground-based MIR observations and archival {\\it{Spitzer}} and\n{\\it{Herschel}} data. These images generally show extended MIR/FIR emission\nalong directions consistent with those of known outflows and with shorter\nwavelength peak flux positions displaced from the protostar along the\nblueshifted, near-facing sides, thus confirming qualitative predictions of Core\nAccretion models. We then compile spectral energy distributions and use these\nto derive protostellar properties by fitting theoretical radiative transfer\nmodels. Zhang and Tan models, based on the Turbulent Core Model of McKee and\nTan, imply the sources have protostellar masses $m_*\\sim10$--50$\\:M_\\odot$\naccreting at $\\sim10^{-4}$--$10^{-3}\\:M_\\odot\\:{\\rm{yr}}^{-1}$ inside cores of\ninitial masses $M_c\\sim30$--500$\\:M_\\odot$ embedded in clumps with mass surface\ndensities $\\Sigma_{\\rm{cl}}\\sim0.1$--3$\\:{\\rm{g\\:cm}^{-2}}$. Fitting Robitaille\net al. models typically leads to slightly higher protostellar masses, but with\ndisk accretion rates $\\sim100\\times$ smaller. We discuss reasons for these\ndifferences and overall implications of these first survey results for massive\nstar formation theories.\n", "  Previously the DeTurck 'trick' has been used to render the stationary\nEinstein's equation a well posed elliptic system that may be solved numerically\nby geometric flow or directly. Whilst in the static case for pure gravity with\nzero or negative cosmological constant there is a simple proof that solving the\nmodified \"harmonic\" Einstein's equation leads to a solution of the original\nEinstein system - i.e. not a Ricci soliton - in the stationary case this\nargument no longer works. Here we provide a new argument that extends the\nstatic result to the case of stationary spacetimes that possess a \"$t$-$\\phi$\"\nreflection symmetry. Defining a \"soliton charge\" from the asymptotic behaviour\nof the solution, we show that this quantity is always non-positive. Provided\nasymptotic conditions are chosen such that this charge vanishes, then\nstationary solitons cannot exist.\n", "  We present a family of quantum money schemes with classical verification\nwhich display a number of benefits over previous proposals. Our schemes are\nbased on hidden matching quantum retrieval games and they tolerate noise up to\n23%, which we conjecture reaches 25% asymptotically as the dimension of the\nunderlying hidden matching states is increased. Furthermore, we prove that 25%\nis the maximum tolerable noise for a wide class of quantum money schemes with\nclassical verification, meaning our schemes are almost optimally noise\ntolerant. We use methods in semi-definite programming to prove security in a\nsubstantially different manner to previous proposals, leading to two main\nadvantages: first, coin verification involves only a constant number of states\n(with respect to coin size), thereby allowing for smaller coins; second, the\nre-usability of coins within our scheme grows linearly with the size of the\ncoin, which is known to be optimal. Lastly, we suggest methods by which the\ncoins in our protocol could be implemented using weak coherent states and\nverified using existing experimental techniques, even in the presence of\ndetector inefficiencies.\n", "  In the presence of a non-adsorbing polymer, monodisperse rod-like particles\nassemble into colloidal membranes, which are one rod-length thick liquid-like\nmonolayers of aligned rods. Unlike 3D edgeless bilayer vesicles, colloidal\nmonolayer membranes form open structures with an exposed edge, thus presenting\nan opportunity to study physics of thin elastic sheets. Membranes assembled\nfrom single-component chiral rods form flat disks with uniform edge twist. In\ncomparison, membranes comprised of mixture of rods with opposite chiralities\ncan have the edge twist of either handedness. In this limit disk-shaped\nmembranes become unstable, instead forming structures with scalloped edges,\nwhere two adjacent lobes with opposite handedness are separated by a\ncusp-shaped point defect. Such membranes adopt a 3D configuration, with cusp\ndefects alternatively located above and below the membrane plane. In the\nachiral regime the cusp defects have repulsive interactions, but away from this\nlimit we measure effective long-ranged attractive binding. A phenomenological\nmodel shows that the increase in the edge energy of scalloped membranes is\ncompensated by concomitant decrease in the deformation energy due to Gaussian\ncurvature associated with scalloped edges, demonstrating that colloidal\nmembranes have positive Gaussian modulus. A simple excluded volume argument\npredicts the sign and magnitude of the Gaussian curvature modulus that is in\nagreement with experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into how\nthe interplay between membrane elasticity, geometrical frustration and achiral\nsymmetry breaking can be used to fold colloidal membranes into 3D shapes.\n", "  Electrical charges are conserved. The same would be expected to hold for\nmagnetic charges, yet magnetic monopoles have never been observed. It is\ntherefore surprising that the laws of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, combined\nwith Maxwell's equations, suggest that colloidal particles heated or cooled in\ncertain polar or paramagnetic solvents may behave as if they carry an\nelectrical/magnetic charge [J. Phys. Chem. B $\\textbf{120}$, 5987 (2016)]. Here\nwe present numerical simulations that show that the field distribution around a\npair of such heated/cooled colloidal particles agrees quantitatively with the\ntheoretical predictions for a pair of oppositely charged electrical or magnetic\nmonopoles. However, in other respects, the non-equilibrium colloids do not\nbehave as monopoles: they cannot be moved by a homogeneous applied field. The\nnumerical evidence for the monopole-like fields around heated/cooled colloids\nis crucial because the experimental and numerical determination of forces\nbetween such colloids would be complicated by the presence of other effects,\nsuch as thermophoresis.\n", "  Neutron stars are astrophysical laboratories of many extremes of physics.\nTheir rich phenomenology provides insights into the state and composition of\nmatter at densities which cannot be reached in terrestrial experiments. Since\nthe core of a mature neutron star is expected to be dominated by superfluid and\nsuperconducting components, observations also probe the dynamics of large-scale\nquantum condensates. The testing and understanding of the relevant theory tends\nto focus on the interface between the astrophysics phenomenology and nuclear\nphysics. The connections with low-temperature experiments tend to be ignored.\nHowever, there has been dramatic progress in understanding laboratory\ncondensates (from the different phases of superfluid helium to the entire range\nof superconductors and cold atom condensates). In this review, we provide an\noverview of these developments, compare and contrast the mathematical\ndescriptions of laboratory condensates and neutron stars and summarise the\ncurrent experimental state-of-the-art. This discussion suggests novel ways that\nwe may make progress in understanding neutron star physics using\nlow-temperature laboratory experiments.\n", "  Surface plasma waves are collective oscillations of electrons that propagate\nalong a metal-dielectric interface. In the last ten years, several groups have\nreproduced fundamental quantum optics experiments with surface plasmons.\nObservation of single-plasmon states, waveparticle duality, preservation of\nentanglement of photons in plasmon-assisted transmission, and more recently,\ntwo-plasmon interference have been reported. While losses are detrimental for\nthe observation of squeezed states, they can be seen as a new degree of freedom\nin the design of plasmonic devices, thus revealing new quantum interference\nscenarios. Here we report the observation of two-plasmon quantum interference\nbetween two freely-propagating, non-guided SPPs interfering on lossy plasmonic\nbeamsplitters. As discussed in the article \"Quantum optics of lossy beam\nsplitters\" by Barnett et al. (Phys. Rev. A 57, 2134 (1998)) , the presence of\nlosses (scattering or absorption) relaxes constraints on the reflection and\ntransmission factors of the beamsplitter, allowing the control of their\nrelative phase. By using this degree of freedom, we are able to observe either\ncoalescence or anticoalescence of identical plasmons.\n", "  The electronic structure of Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$MnO$_3$ has been investigated\nusing a combination of first-principles calculations, X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron-energy loss\nspectroscopy (EELS), and optical absorption. The full range of compositions,\n$x=0,1/2,1$, and a variety of magnetic orders have been covered. Jahn-Teller as\nwell as Zener polaron orders are considered. The free parameters of the local\nhybrid density functionals used in this study has been determined by comparison\nwith measured XPS spectra. A model Hamiltonian, valid for the entire doping\nrange, has been extracted. A simple local-orbital picture of the electronic\nstructure for the interpretation of experimental spectra is provided. The\ncomparison of theoretical calculations and different experimental sprectra\nprovide a detailed and consistent picture of the electronic structure. The\nlarge variations of measured optical absorption spectra are traced back to the\ncoexistence of magnetic orders respectively to the occupation of local\norbitals. A consistent treatment of the Coulomb interaction indicate a partial\ncancellation of Coulomb parameters and support the dominance of the\nelectron-phonon coupling.\n", "  All metamaterial applications are based upon the idea that extreme material\nproperties can be achieved through appropriate dynamic homogenization of\ncomposites. This homogenization is almost always done for infinite domains and\nthe results are then applied to finite samples. This process ignores the\nevanescent waves which appear at the boundaries of such finite samples. In this\npaper we first clarify the emergence and purpose of these evanescent waves in a\nmodel problem consisting of an interface between a layered composite and a\nhomogeneous medium. We show that these evanescent waves form boundary layers on\neither side of the interface beyond which the composite can be represented by\nappropriate infinite domain homogenized relations. We show that if one ignores\nthe boundary layers then the displacement and stress fields are discontinuous\nacross the interface. Therefore, the scattering coefficients at such an\ninterface cannot be determined through the conventional continuity conditions\ninvolving only propagating modes. Here we propose an approximate variational\napproach for sidestepping these boundary layers. The aim is to determine the\nscattering coefficients without the knowledge of evanescent modes. Through\nvarious numerical examples we show that our technique gives very good estimates\nof the actual scattering coefficients beyond the long wavelength limit.\n", "  Encryption is a vital tool of information technology protecting our data in\nthe world with ubiquitous computers. While photons are regarded as ideal\ninformation carriers, it is a must to implement such data protection on\nall-optical storage. However, the intrinsic risk of data breaches in existing\nschemes of photonic memory was never addressed. We theoretically demonstrate\nthe first protocol using spatially disordered laser fields to encrypt data\nstored on an optical memory, namely, encrypted photonic memory. Compare with a\ndigital key, a continuous disorder encrypts stored light pulses with a rather\nlong key length against brute-force attacks. To address the broadband storage,\nwe also investigate a novel scheme of disordered echo memory with a high\nfidelity approaching unity. Our results pave novel ways to encrypt different\nschemes of photonic memory based on quantum optics and raise the security level\nof photonic information technology.\n", "  Understanding the motion of a tracer particle in a rarefied gas is of\nfundamental and practical importance. We report the experimental investigation\nof individual Cs atoms impinging on a dilute cloud of ultracold Rb atoms with\nvariable density. We study the nonequilibrium relaxation of the initial\nnonthermal state and detect the effect of single collisions which has eluded\nobservation so far. We show that after few collisions, the measured spatial\ndistribution of the light tracer atoms is correctly described by a generalized\nLangevin equation with a velocity-dependent friction coefficient, over a large\nrange of Knudsen numbers.\n", "  The production yields of Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S), and Upsilon(3S) quarkonium\nstates are measured through their decays into muon pairs in the CMS detector,\nin PbPb and pp collisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 2.76\nTeV. The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 166 inverse microbarns\nand 5.4 inverse picobarns for PbPb and pp collisions, respectively.\nDifferential production cross sections are reported as functions of Upsilon\nrapidity y up to 2.4, and transverse momentum pT up to 20 GeV/c. A strong\ncentrality-dependent suppression is observed in PbPb relative to pp collisions,\nby factors of up to approximately 2 and 8, for the Upsilon(1S) and Upsilon(2S)\nstates, respectively. No significant dependence of this suppression is observed\nas a function of y or pT. The Upsilon(3S) state is not observed in PbPb\ncollisions, which corresponds to a suppression for the centrality-integrated\ndata by at least a factor of approximately 7 at a 95% confidence level. The\nobserved suppression is in agreement with theoretical scenarios modeling the\nsequential melting of quarkonium states in a quark gluon plasma.\n", "  We demonstrate significant cooling of electrons in a nanostructure below 10\nmK by demagnetisation of thin-film copper on a silicon chip. Our approach\novercomes the typical bottleneck of weak electron-phonon scattering by coupling\nthe electrons directly to a bath of refrigerated nuclei, rather than cooling\nvia phonons in the host lattice. Consequently, weak electron-phonon scattering\nbecomes an advantage. It allows the electrons to be cooled for an\nexperimentally useful period of time to temperatures colder than the dilution\nrefrigerator platform, the incoming electrical connections, and the host\nlattice. There are efforts worldwide to reach sub-millikelvin electron\ntemperatures in nanostructures to study coherent electronic phenomena and\nimprove the operation of nanoelectronic devices. On-chip magnetic cooling is a\npromising approach to meet this challenge. The method can be used to reach low,\nlocal electron temperatures in other nanostructures, obviating the need to\nadapt traditional, large demagnetisation stages. We demonstrate the technique\nby applying it to a nanoelectronic primary thermometer that measures its\ninternal electron temperature. Using an optimised demagnetisation process, we\ndemonstrate cooling of the on-chip electrons from 9 mK to below 5 mK for over\n1000 seconds.\n", "  We give an explicit construction of complex maps whose nodal line have the\nform of lemniscate knots. We review the properties of lemniscate knots, defined\nas closures of braids where all strands follow the same transverse (1, $\\ell$)\nLissajous figure, and are therefore a subfamily of spiral knots generalising\nthe torus knots. We then prove that such maps exist and are in fact fibrations\nwith appropriate choices of parameters. We describe how this may be useful in\nphysics for creating knotted fields, in quantum mechanics, optics and\ngeneralising to rational maps with application to the Skyrme-Faddeev model. We\nalso prove how this construction extends to maps with weakly isolated\nsingularities.\n", "  For the first time full next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to\noff-shell vector-boson scattering are presented. The computation features the\ncomplete matrix elements, including all non-resonant and off-shell\ncontributions, to the electroweak process $\\mathrm{p} \\mathrm{p} \\to \\mu^+\n\\nu_\\mu \\mathrm{e}^+ \\nu_{\\mathrm{e}} \\mathrm{j} \\mathrm{j}$. It is fully\ndifferential, and event selections are applied to the final states such that\nthe predictions can be directly compared to experimental measurements. The\ncorrections are surprisingly large, reaching -16% for the fiducial cross\nsection and up to -40% in the tails of distributions. These large corrections\nare due to enhanced logarithms in the bosonic virtual corrections.\n", "  Binary black hole mergers are among the most violent events in the Universe,\nleading to extreme warping of spacetime and copious emission of gravitational\nradiation. Even though black holes are the most compact objects they are not\nnecessarily the most efficient emitters of gravitational radiation in binary\nsystems. The final black hole resulting from a binary black hole merger retains\na significant fraction of the pre-merger orbital energy and angular momentum. A\nnon-vacuum system can in principle shed more of this energy than a black hole\nmerger of equivalent mass. We study these super-emitters through a toy model\nthat accounts for the possibility that the merger creates a compact object that\nretains a long-lived time-varying quadrupole moment. This toy model can capture\nthe merger of neutron stars, but it can also be used to consider more exotic\ncompact binaries. We hope that this toy model can serve as a guide to more\nrigorous numerical investigations into these systems.\n", "  The mechanism of hydrodynamics-induced pairing of soft particles, namely\nclosed bilayer membranes (vesicles, a model system for red blood cells) and\ndrops, is studied numerically with a special attention paid to the role of the\nconfinement (the particles are within two rigid walls). This study unveils the\ncomplexity of the pairing mechanism due to hydrodynamic interactions. We find\nboth for vesicles and for drops that two particles attract each other and form\na stable pair at weak confinement if their initial separation is below a\ncertain value. If the initial separation is beyond that distance, the particles\nrepel each other and adopt a longer stable interdistance. This means that for\nthe same confinement we have (at least) two stable branches. To which branch a\npair of particles relaxes with time depends only on the initial configuration.\nAn unstable branch is found between these two stable branches. At a critical\nconfinement the stable branch corresponding to the shortest interdistance\nmerges with the unstable branch in the form of a saddle-node bifurcation. At\nthis critical confinement we have a finite jump from a solution corresponding\nto the continuation of the unbounded case to a solution which is induced by the\npresence of walls. The results are summarized in a phase diagram, which proves\nto be of a complex nature. The fact that both vesicles and drops have the same\nqualitative phase diagram points to the existence of a universal behavior,\nhighlighting the fact that with regard to pairing the details of mechanical\nproperties of the deformable particles are unimportant. This offers an\ninteresting perspective for simple analytical modeling.\n", "  By employing four typical equation of states (EOSs) of the inner crust\nmatters, the constraint on properties of low-mass neutron stars are\ntheoretically investigated. Based on the well known fact that there is a big\ngap between the neutron stars and white dwarfs in the mass-radius sequence of\ncompact stars, here we explicitly point out the forbidden region for the\ncentral density and stellar radius to form a compact stars, that is, there is\nno compact star in the nature having central density in the region from about\n$10^{12}~kg/m^3$ to $10^{17}~kg/m^3$, and there is also no compact star having\na radius in the region from about 400 km to 2000 km. It is found that for a\nlow-mass neutron star with central densities at subnuclear densities, the\nstellar mass is mainly determined by the softness of the EOS at the higher\ndensity region ($ > 10^{16}~\\textrm{kg.m}^{-3}$) while the stellar radius is\ndependent on the softness of the EOS at lower density region ($ <\n10^{16}~\\textrm{kg.m}^{-3}$). For a stable neutron star with stellar mass near\nthe minimum mass, the Keplerian period is several hundred millisecond, the\nmoment of inertia is in an order of $10^{37} kg\\cdot m^{2}$, and the surface\ngravitational redshift is in an order of $10^{-4}$.\n", "  Heterostructures combining topological and non-topological materials\nconstitute the next frontier in the effort to incorporate topological\ninsulators (TIs) into functional electronic devices. We show that the\nproperties of the interface states appearing at the planar boundary between a\ntopologically-trivial semiconductor (SE) and a TI are controlled by the\nsymmetry of the interface. In contrast to the well-studied helical Dirac\nsurface states, SE-TI interface states exhibit elliptical contours of constant\nenergy and complex spin textures with broken helicity. We derive a general\neffective Hamiltonian for SE-TI junctions, and propose experimental signatures\nsuch as an out of plane spin accumulation under a transport current and the\nopening of a spectral gap that depends on the direction of an applied in-plane\nmagnetic field.\n", "  In this paper we investigate ghost dark energy model in the presence of\nnon-linear interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We also extend the\nanalysis to the so called generalized ghost dark energy (GGDE) which\n$\\rho_D=\\alpha H+\\beta H^2$. The model contains three free parameters as\n$\\Omega_D, \\zeta(=\\frac{8\\pi G \\beta}{3})$ and $b^2$ (the coupling coefficient\nof interactions). We propose three kinds of non-linear interaction terms and\ndiscuss the behavior of equation of state, deceleration and dark energy density\nparameters of the model. We also find the squared sound speed and search for\nsigns of stability of the model. To compare the interacting GGDE model with\nobservational data sets, we use more recent observational outcomes, namely SNIa\nfrom JLA catalog, Hubble parameter, baryonic acoustic oscillation and the most\nrelevant CMB parameters including, the position of acoustic peaks, shift\nparameters and redshift to recombination. For GGDE with the first non-linear\ninteraction, the joint analysis indicates that $\\Omega_D=0.7192\\pm0.0062$,\n$b^2=0.146^{+0.030}_{-0.026}$ and $\\zeta=0.104\\pm0.047$ at 1 optimal variance\nerror. For the second interaction, the best fit values at $1\\sigma$ confidence\nare $\\Omega_D=0.72091\\pm0.0065$, $b^2=0.0395\\pm0.0080$ and $\\zeta\\le0.0173$.\nAccording to combination of all observational data sets considered in this\npaper the best fit values for third non-linearly interacting model are\n$\\Omega_D=0.7287\\pm0.0062$, $b^2=0.0109\\pm0.0023$ and $\\zeta\\le0.00764$ at\n$1\\sigma$ confidence interval. Finally we found that the presence of\ninteraction is compatible in mentioned models via current observational data\nsets.\n", "  The Pan-STARRS (PS1) Medium Deep Survey discovered over 5,000 likely\nsupernovae (SNe) but obtained spectral classifications for just 10% of its SN\ncandidates. We measured spectroscopic host galaxy redshifts for 3,147 of these\nlikely SNe and estimate that $\\sim$1,000 are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) with\nlight-curve quality sufficient for a cosmological analysis. We use these data\nwith simulations to determine the impact of core-collapse SN (CC SN)\ncontamination on measurements of the dark energy equation of state parameter,\n$w$. Using the method of Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species\n(BEAMS), distances to SNe Ia and the contaminating CC SN distribution are\nsimultaneously determined. We test light-curve based SN classification priors\nfor BEAMS as well as a new classification method that relies upon host galaxy\nspectra and the association of SN type with host type. By testing several SN\nclassification methods and CC SN parameterizations on large SN simulations, we\nestimate that CC SN contamination gives a systematic error on $w$\n($\\sigma_w^{CC}$) of 0.014, 29% of the statistical uncertainty. Our best method\ngives $\\sigma_w^{CC} = 0.004$, just 8% of the statistical uncertainty, but\ncould be affected by incomplete knowledge of the CC SN distribution. This\nmethod determines the SALT2 color and shape coefficients, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$,\nwith $\\sim$3% bias. However, we find that some variants require $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ to be fixed to known values for BEAMS to yield accurate measurements of\n$w$. Finally, the inferred abundance of bright CC SNe in our sample is greater\nthan expected based on measured CC SN rates and luminosity functions.\n", "  In magnetic nanowires with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) magnetic\ndomain walls (DW) are narrow and can move rapidly driven by current induced\ntorques. This enables important applications like high-density memories for\nwhich the precise detection of the position and motion of a propagating DW is\nof utmost interest. Today's DW detection tools are often limited in resolution,\nor acquisition speed, or can only be applied on specific materials. Here, we\nshow that the anomalous Nernst effect provides a simple and powerful tool to\nprecisely track the position and motion of a single DW propagating in a PMA\nnanowire. We detect field and current driven DW propagation in both metallic\nheterostructures and dilute magnetic semiconductors over a broad temperature\nrange. The demonstrated spatial resolution below 20 nm is comparable to the DW\nwidth in typical metallic PMA systems.\n", "  We investigate Euclidean wormholes in Einstein gravity with a massless scalar\nfield in de Sitter space. Euclidean wormholes are possible due to the analytic\ncontinuation of the time as well as complexification of fields, where we need\nto impose the classicality after the Wick-rotation to the Lorentzian\nsignatures. For some parameters, wormholes are preferred than Hawking-Moss\ninstantons, and hence wormholes can be more fundamental than Hawking-Moss type\ninstantons. Euclidean wormholes can be interpreted in three ways: (1) classical\nbig bounce, (2) either tunneling from a small to a large universe or a creation\nof a collapsing and an expanding universe from nothing, and (3) either a\ntransition from a contracting to a bouncing phase or a creation of two\nexpanding universes from nothing. These various interpretations shed some light\non challenges of singularities. In addition, these will help to understand\ntensions between various kinds of quantum gravity theories.\n", "  One of the key applications for quantum computers will be the simulation of\nother quantum systems that arise in chemistry, materials science, etc, in order\nto accelerate the process of discovery. It is important to ask: Can this be\nachieved using near future quantum processors, of modest size and under\nimperfect control, or must it await the more distant era of large-scale\nfault-tolerant quantum computing? Here we propose a variational method\ninvolving closely integrated classical and quantum coprocessors. We presume\nthat all operations in the quantum coprocessor are prone to error. The impact\nof such errors is minimised by boosting them artificially and then\nextrapolating to the zero-error case. In comparison to a more conventional\noptimised Trotterisation technique, we find that our protocol is efficient and\nappears to be fundamentally more robust against error accumulation.\n", "  We present the first determination of the galaxy luminosity function (LF) at\nz~4, 5, 6 and 7 in the rest-frame optical at lambda_rest~900 nm (z' band). The\nrest-frame optical light traces the content in low-mass evolved stars (~stellar\nmass - Mstar), minimizing potential measurement biases for Mstar. Moreover it\nis less affected by nebular line emission contamination and dust attenuation,\nis independent of stellar population models, and can be probed up to z~8\nthrough Spitzer/IRAC. Our analysis leverages the unique full depth Spitzer/IRAC\n3.6um-to-8.0um data over the CANDELS/GOODS-N, CANDELS/GOODS-S and\nCOSMOS/UltraVISTA fields. We find that at absolute magnitudes M_z' fainter than\n>-23 mag, M_z' linearly correlates with M_UV,1600. At brighter M_z', M_UV,1600\npresents a turnover, suggesting that the stellar mass-to-light ratio\nMstar/L_UV,1600 could be characterised by a very broad range of values at high\nstellar masses. Median-stacking analysis recovers a Mstar/L_z' roughly\nindependent on M_z' for M_z'>-23 mag, but exponentially increasing at brighter\nmagnitudes. We find that the evolution of the LF marginally prefers a pure\nevolution in luminosity over a pure evolution in density, with the\ncharacteristic luminosity decreasing by a factor ~5x between z~4 and z~7.\nDirect application of the recovered Mstar/L_z' generates stellar mass functions\nconsistent with average measurements from the literature. Measurements of the\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio at fixed cumulative number density show that it is\nroughly constant with redshift for Mh>10^12Msun. This is also supported by the\nfact that the evolution of the LF at 4<z<7 can be accounted for by a rigid\ndisplacement in luminosity corresponding to the evolution of the halo mass from\nabundance matching.\n", "  In quantum spin systems, singlet phases often develop in the vicinity of an\nantiferromagnetic order. Typical settings for such problems arise when\nitinerant fermions are also present. In this work, we develop a theoretical\nframework for addressing such competing orders in an itinerant system,\ndescribed by Dirac fermions strongly coupled to an O(3) nonlinear sigma model.\nWe focus on two spatial dimensions, where upon disordering the\nantiferromagnetic order by quantum fluctuations the singular tunneling events\nalso known as (anti)hedgehogs can nucleate competing singlet orders in the\nparamagnetic phase. In the presence of an isolated hedgehog configuration of\nthe nonlinear sigma model field, we show that the fermion determinant vanishes\nas the dynamic Euclidean Dirac operator supports fermion zero modes of definite\nchirality. This provides a topological mechanism for suppressing the tunneling\nevents. Using the methodology of quantum chromodynamics, we evaluate the\nfermion determinant in the close proximity of magnetic quantum phase\ntransition, when the antiferromagnetic order parameter field can be described\nby a dilute gas of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs. We show how the precise nature\nof emergent singlet order is determined by the overlap between dynamic fermion\nzero modes of opposite chirality, localized on the hedgehogs and antihedgehogs.\nFor a Kondo-Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate the\ncompetition between spin Peierls order and Kondo singlet formation, thereby\nelucidating its global phase diagram. We also discuss other physical problems\nthat can be addressed within this general framework.\n", "  In any bosonic lattice system, which is not dominated by local interactions\nand thus \"frozen\" in a Mott-type state, numerical methods have to cope with the\ninfinite size of the corresponding Hilbert space even for finite lattice sizes.\nWhile it is common practice to restrict the local occupation number basis to\n$N_c$ lowest occupied states, the presence of a finite condensate fraction\nrequires the complete number basis for an exact representation of the many-body\nground state. In this work we present a novel truncation scheme to account for\ncontributions from higher number states. By simply adding a single\n\\textit{coherent-tail} state to this common truncation, we demonstrate\nincreased numerical accuracy and the possible increase in numerical efficiency\nof this method for the Gutzwiller variational wave function and within\ndynamical mean-field theory.\n", "  Many realizations of solid-state qubits involve couplings to leakage states\nlying outside the computational subspace, posing a threat to high-fidelity\nquantum gate operations. Mitigating leakage errors is especially challenging\nwhen the coupling strength is unknown, e.g., when it is caused by noise. Here\nwe show that simple pulse sequences can be used to strongly suppress leakage\nerrors for a qubit embedded in a three-level system. As an example, we apply\nour scheme to the recently proposed charge quadrupole (CQ) qubit for quantum\ndots. These results provide a solution to a key challenge for fault-tolerant\nquantum computing with solid-state elements.\n", "  We present a novel propagation medium using a pair of non-identical coupled\ntransmission lines. The medium is referred to as `butterfly' structure and is\ncomposed of four coupled transmission lines. These four coupled transmission\nlines generate higher-order dispersion modes by coupling the modes supported on\neach of the transmission lines. When these transmission line pairs are placed\ninside a circular waveguide, they support a strong TM01-like Degenerate Band\nEdge mode. This property can be used to enhance coupling of the electron beams\nto RF waves for high-power Traveling Wave Tubes. In this paper, we present the\nslow wave characteristics and Degenerate Band Edge mode formation using the\ncoupled pair of transmission lines.\n", "  Low radio frequency solar observations using the Murchison Widefield Array\nhave recently revealed the presence of numerous weak, short-lived and\nnarrow-band emission features, even during moderately quiet solar conditions.\nThese non-thermal features occur at rates of many thousands per hour in the\n30.72 MHz observing bandwidth, and hence, necessarily require an automated\napproach for their detection and characterization. Here, we employ continuous\nwavelet transform using a mother Ricker wavelet for feature detection from the\ndynamic spectrum. We establish the efficacy of this approach and present the\nfirst statistically robust characterization of the properties of these\nfeatures. In particular, we examine distributions of their peak flux densities,\nspectral spans, temporal spans and peak frequencies. We can reliably detect\nfeatures weaker than 1 SFU, making them, to the best of our knowledge, the\nweakest bursts reported in literature. The distribution of their peak flux\ndensities follows a power law with an index of -2.23 in the 12-155 SFU range,\nimplying that they can provide an energetically significant contribution to\ncoronal and chromospheric heating. These features typically last for 1-2\nseconds and possess bandwidths of about 4-5 MHz. Their occurrence rate remains\nfairly flat in the 140-210 MHz frequency range. At the time resolution of the\ndata, they appear as stationary bursts, exhibiting no perceptible frequency\ndrift. These features also appear to ride on a broadband background continuum,\nhinting at the likelihood of them being weak type-I bursts.\n", "  The renormalization that relates a coupling \"a\" associated with a distinct\nrenormalization group beta function in a given theory is considered.\nDimensional regularization and mass independent renormalization schemes are\nused in this discussion. It is shown how the renormalization $a^*=a+x_2a^2$ is\nrelated to a change in the mass scale $\\mu$ that is induced by renormalization.\nIt is argued that the infrared fixed point is to be a determined in a\nrenormalization scheme in which the series expansion for a physical quantity\n$R$ terminates.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of gravitational lensing in the purely metric\n$f\\left(\\chi\\right)$ gravity, an $f(R)$ gravity where the action of the\ngravitational field depends on the source mass. We focus on the strong lensing\nregime in galaxy-galaxy lens systems and in clusters of galaxies. Using an\napproximate metric solution accurate to second order of the velocity field\n$v/c$, we show how, in the $f\\left(\\chi\\right)=\\chi^{3/2}$ gravity, the same\nlight deflection can be produced by point-like lenses with masses smaller than\nin General Relativity; this mass difference increases with increasing impact\nparameter and decreasing lens mass. However, for sufficiently massive\npoint-like lenses and small impact parameters, $f\\left(\\chi\\right)=\\chi^{3/2}$\nand GR yield indistinguishable light deflection angles: this regime occurs both\nin observed galaxy-galaxy lens systems and in the central regions of galaxy\nclusters. In the former systems, the GR and $f\\left(\\chi\\right)$ masses are\ncompatible with the mass of standard stellar populations and little or no dark\nmatter, whereas, on the scales of the core of galaxy clusters, the presence of\nsubstantial dark matter is required both in General Relativity, and in our\napproximate $f\\left(\\chi\\right)=\\chi^{3/2}$ point-like lens solution. We thus\nconclude that our approximate metric solution of\n$f\\left(\\chi\\right)=\\chi^{3/2}$ is unable to describe the observed\nphenomenology of the strong lensing regime without the aid of dark matter.\n", "  In this work we realize a narrow spectroscopic feature using a technique that\nwe refer to as magnetically-induced optical transparency. A cold ensemble of\n$^{88}$Sr atoms interacts with a single mode of a high-finesse optical cavity\nvia the 7.5kHz linewidth, spin forbidden $^1$S$_0$ to $^3$P$_1$ transition. By\napplying a magnetic field that shifts two excited state Zeeman levels, we open\na transmission window through the cavity where the collective vacuum Rabi\nsplitting due to a single level would create destructive interference for probe\ntransmission. The spectroscopic feature approaches the atomic transition\nlinewidth, which is much narrower than the cavity linewidth, and is highly\nimmune to the reference cavity length fluctuations that limit current\nstate-of-the-art laser frequency stability.\n", "  The broad-band X-ray observations of the youngest known galactic supernova\nremnant, G1.9+0.3, provide unique information about the particle acceleration\nat the early stages of evolution of supernova remnants. Based on the publicly\navailable X-ray data obtained with the Chandra and NuSTAR satellites over two\ndecades in energy, we derived the energy distribution of relativistic electrons\nunder the assumption that detected X-rays are of entirely synchrotron origin.\nThe acceleration of electrons was found to be an order of magnitude slower than\nthe maximum rate provided by the shock acceleration in the nominal Bohm\ndiffusion regime. We discuss the implications of this result in the context of\ncontribution of SNRs to the Galactic Cosmic Rays at PeV energies.\n", "  We present a general analysis of the orbital angular momentum (OAM)\ndistribution of gluons $L_g(x)$ inside the nucleon with particular emphasis on\nthe small-$x$ region. We derive a novel operator representation of $L_g(x)$ in\nterms of Wilson lines and argue that it is approximately proportional to the\ngluon helicity distribution $L_g(x) \\approx -2\\Delta G(x)$ at small-$x$. We\nalso compute longitudinal single spin asymmetry in exclusive diffractive dijet\nproduction in lepton-nucleon scattering in the next-to-eikonal approximation\nand show that the asymmetry is a direct probe of the gluon helicity/OAM\ndistribution as well as the QCD odderon exchange.\n", "  The Twin Higgs model is the preeminent example of a theory of neutral\nnaturalness, where the new particles that alleviate the little hierarchy\nproblem are Standard Model (SM) singlets. The most promising collider search\nstrategy, based on rare Higgs decays, is nevertheless not effective in\nsignificant regions of the parameter space of the low energy theory. This\nunderlines the importance of phenomenological studies on ultraviolet\ncompletions of the Twin Higgs model, which must lie at a scale lower than 5-10\nTeV. We pursue this course in the context of non-supersymmetric completions,\nfocusing on exotic fermions that carry SM electroweak and twin color charges,\nas well as on exotic vectors that transform as the bi-fundamental of the\nelectroweak or color groups. Both $Z_2$-preserving and $Z_2$-breaking mass\nspectra are considered for the exotic fermions. In the former case they must be\nheavier than $\\sim 1$ TeV, but can still be sizably produced in the decays of\nthe color bi-fundamental vector. In the $Z_2$-breaking scenario, the exotic\nfermions can have masses in the few hundred GeV range without significantly\nincreasing the fine-tuning. Once pair-produced through the electroweak\ninteractions, they naturally form bound states held together by the twin color\nforce, which subsequently annihilate back to SM particles. The associated\nresonance signals are discussed in detail. We also outline the phenomenology of\nthe electroweak bi-fundamental vectors, some of which mix with the SM $W$ and\n$Z$ and can therefore be singly produced in hadron collisions.\n", "  We study edge fluctuations of a flat colloidal membrane comprised of a\nmonolayer of aligned filamentous viruses. Experiments reveal that a peak in the\nspectrum of the in-plane edge fluctuations arises for sufficiently strong virus\nchirality. Accounting for internal liquid crystalline degrees of freedom by the\nlength, curvature, and geodesic torsion of the edge, we calculate the spectrum\nof the edge fluctuations. The theory quantitatively describes the experimental\ndata, demonstrating that chirality couples in-plane and out-of-plane edge\nfluctuations to produce the peak.\n", "  Building on developments in machine learning and prior work in the science of\njudicial prediction, we construct a model designed to predict the behavior of\nthe Supreme Court of the United States in a generalized, out-of-sample context.\nTo do so, we develop a time evolving random forest classifier which leverages\nsome unique feature engineering to predict more than 240,000 justice votes and\n28,000 cases outcomes over nearly two centuries (1816-2015). Using only data\navailable prior to decision, our model outperforms null (baseline) models at\nboth the justice and case level under both parametric and non-parametric tests.\nOver nearly two centuries, we achieve 70.2% accuracy at the case outcome level\nand 71.9% at the justice vote level. More recently, over the past century, we\noutperform an in-sample optimized null model by nearly 5%. Our performance is\nconsistent with, and improves on the general level of prediction demonstrated\nby prior work; however, our model is distinctive because it can be applied\nout-of-sample to the entire past and future of the Court, not a single term.\nOur results represent an important advance for the science of quantitative\nlegal prediction and portend a range of other potential applications.\n", "  Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we observed a transit at 3.6um of KELT-11b\n(Pepper et al. 2017). We also observed three partial transits from the ground.\nWe simultaneously fit these observations, ground-based photometry from Pepper\net al. (2017), radial velocity data from Pepper et al. (2017), and an SED model\nutilizing catalog magnitudes and the Hipparcos parallax to the system. The only\nsignificant difference between our results and Pepper et al. (2017) is that we\nfind the orbital period is shorter by 37 seconds, $4.73610\\pm0.00003$ vs.\n$4.73653\\pm0.00006$ days, and we measure a transit center time of BJD_TDB\n$2457483.4310\\pm0.0007$, which is 42 minutes earlier than predicted. Using our\nnew photometry, we measure the density of the star KELT-11 to 4%. By combining\nthe parallax and catalog magnitudes of the system, we are able to measure\nKELT-11b's radius essentially empirically. Coupled with the stellar density,\nthis gives a parallactic mass and radius of $1.8\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and $2.9\\,{\\rm\nR}_\\odot$, which are each approximately $1\\,\\sigma$ higher than the adopted\nmodel-estimated mass and radius. If we conduct the same fit using the expected\nparallax uncertainty from the final Gaia data release, this difference\nincreases to $4\\,\\sigma$. This demonstrates the role that precise Gaia\nparallaxes, coupled with simultaneous photometric, RV, and SED fitting, can\nplay in determining stellar and planetary parameters. With high precision\nphotometry of transiting planets and high precision Gaia parallaxes, the\nparallactic mass and radius uncertainties of stars become 1% and 3%,\nrespectively. TESS is expected to discover 60 to 80 systems where these\nmeasurements will be possible. These parallactic mass and radius measurements\nhave uncertainties small enough that they may provide observational input into\nthe stellar models themselves.\n", "  We prove the \"existence of a piece of Scri near $i^0$\" (with most likely poor\ndifferentiability of the conformally rescaled metric) for general\nasymptotically flat data with well-defined energy-momentum. The proof uses\nscaling and a gluing construction to reduce the problem to Bieri's stability\ntheorem.\n", "  We measure subnanometer displacements of thin samples vibrated by\npiezotransducer. Samples contain $^{57}$Fe nuclei, which are exposed to 14.4\nkeV $\\gamma$-radiation. Vibration produces sidebands from a single absorption\nline of the sample. The sideband intensities depend on the vibration amplitude\nand its distribution along the sample. We developed a model of this\ndistribution, which adequately describes the spectra of powder and stainless\nsteel (SS) absorbers. We propose to filter $\\gamma$-radiation through a small\nhole in the mask, placed before the absorber. In this case only a small spot of\nthe vibrated absorber is observed. We found for SS foil that nuclei, exposed to\n$\\gamma$-radiation in this small spot, vibrate with almost the same amplitudes\nwhose difference does not exceed a few picometers.\n", "  Canonical tensor model (CTM) is a tensor model formulated in the Hamilton\nformalism as a totally constrained system with first class constraints, the\nalgebraic structure of which is very similar to that of the ADM formalism of\ngeneral relativity. It has recently been shown that a formal continuum limit of\nthe classical equation of motion of CTM in a derivative expansion of the tensor\nup to the fourth derivatives agrees with that of a coupled system of general\nrelativity and a scalar field in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. This suggests\nthe existence of a \"mother\" tensor model which derives CTM through the\nHamilton-Jacobi procedure, and we have successfully found such a \"mother\" CTM\n(mCTM) in this paper. The quantization of mCTM is straightforward as CTM.\nHowever, we have not been able to identify all the secondary constraints, and\ntherefore the full structure of the model has been left for future study.\nNonetheless, we have found some exact physical wave functions and classical\nphase spaces which can be shown to solve the primary and all the (possibly\ninfinite) secondary constraints in the quantum and classical cases,\nrespectively, and have thereby proven the non-triviality of the model. It has\nalso been shown that mCTM has more interesting dynamics than CTM from the\nperspective of randomly connected tensor networks.\n", "  [Background] Neutrino-induced single-pion production (SPP) provides an\nimportant contribution to neutrino-nucleus interactions, ranging from\nintermediate to high energies. There exists a good number of low-energy models\nin the literature to describe the neutrinoproduction of pions in the region\naround the Delta resonance. Those models consider only lowest-order interaction\nterms and, therefore, fail in the high-energy region (pion-nucleon invariant\nmasses, $W$>2 GeV).\n  [Purpose] Our goal is to develop a model for electroweak SPP off the nucleon,\nwhich is applicable to the entire energy range of interest for present and\nfuture neutrino-oscillation experiments.\n  [Method] We start with the low-energy model of [Phys.Rev.D76,033005(2007)],\nwhich includes resonant contributions and background terms derived from the\npion-nucleon Lagrangian of chiral-perturbation theory. Then, from the\nbackground contributions, we build a high-energy model using a Regge approach.\nThe low- and high-energy models are combined, in a phenomenological way, into a\nhybrid model.\n  [Results] The Hybrid model is identical to the low-energy model in the low-W\nregion, but, for W>2 GeV, it implements the desired high-energy behavior\ndictated by Regge theory. We have tested the high-energy model by comparing\nwith one-pion production data from electron and neutrino reactions. The Hybrid\nmodel is compared with electron-proton scattering data, with neutrino SPP data\nand with the predictions of the NuWro Monte Carlo event generator.\n  [Conclusions] Our model is able to provide satisfactory predictions of the\nelectroweak one-pion production cross section from pion threshold to high $W$.\nFurther investigation and more data are needed to better understand the\nmechanisms playing a role in the electroweak SPP process in the high-W region,\nin particular, those involving the axial current contributions.\n", "  We report observation of two-photon emission from coherently excited\nvibrational state of solid parahydrogen, known as one of quantum solids. The\ncoherent state between the ground and the excited states is prepared by\nstimulated Raman scattering using two visible laser pulses. The two-photon\nemission is triggered by another mid-infrared laser pulse. The observed\ntwo-photon emission persists even when the trigger pulse is injected long after\nthe excitation. The observed phenomenon is due to a long decoherence time of\nthe vibrational states of solid parahydrogen, which is attributed to special\nnature as quantum solid. Dependence of the decoherence on target temperature\nand residual orthohydrogen concentration are studied along with its time\nevolution. It is found that the emission intensity increases even after the\nexcitation pulses pass through the target completely. The coherence development\nis highly suppressed at high target temperature and high residual orthohydrogen\nconcentration. Effects of target annealing and laser-induced damage on the\ntarget are also observed.\n", "  We report an efficient method to observe single photon emissions in monolayer\nWSe2 by applying hydrostatic pressure. The photoluminescence peaks of typical\ntwo-dimensional (2D) excitons show a nearly identical pressure-induced\nblue-shift, whereas the energy of pressure-induced discrete emission lines\n(quantum emitters) demonstrates a pressure insensitive behavior. The decay time\nof these discrete line emissions is approximately 10 ns, which is at least one\norder longer than the lifetime of the broad localized (L) excitons. These\ncharacteristics lead to a conclusion that the excitons bound to deep level\ndefects can be responsible for the observed single photon emissions.\n", "  The surface states in three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) can\nbe described by a two-dimensional (2D) continuous Dirac Hamiltonian. However,\nthere exists the Fermion doubling problem when putting the continuous 2D Dirac\nequation into a lattice model. In this letter, we introduce a Wilson term with\na zero bare mass into the 2D lattice model to overcome the difficulty. By\ncomparing with a 3D Hamiltonian, we show that the modified 2D lattice model can\nfaithfully describe the low-energy electrical and transport properties of\nsurface states of 3D TIs. So this 2D lattice model provides a simple and cheap\nway to numerically simulate the surface states of 3D TI nanostructures. Based\non the 2D lattice model, we also establish the wormhole effect in a TI nanowire\nby a magnetic field along the wire and show the surface states being robust\nagainst disorder. The proposed 2D lattice model can be extensively applied to\nstudy the various properties and effects, such as the transport properties,\nHall effect, universal conductance fluctuations, localization effect, etc.. So\nit paves a new way to study the surface states of the 3D topological\ninsulators.\n", "  We analyze the thermodynamic costs of the three main approaches to generating\nrandom numbers via the recently introduced Information Processing Second Law.\nGiven access to a specified source of randomness, a random number generator\n(RNG) produces samples from a desired target probability distribution. This\ndiffers from pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) that use wholly\ndeterministic algorithms and from true random number generators (TRNG) in which\nthe randomness source is a physical system. For each class, we analyze the\nthermodynamics of generators based on algorithms implemented as finite-state\nmachines, as these allow for direct bounds on the required physical resources.\nThis establishes bounds on heat dissipation and work consumption during the\noperation of three main classes of RNG algorithms---including those of von\nNeumann, Knuth and Yao, and Roche and Hoshi---and for PRNG methods. We\nintroduce a general TRNG and determine its thermodynamic costs exactly for\narbitrary target distributions. The results highlight the significant\ndifferences between the three main approaches to random number generation: One\nis work producing, one is work consuming, and the other is potentially\ndissipation neutral. Notably, TRNGs can both generate random numbers and\nconvert thermal energy to stored work. These thermodynamic costs on information\ncreation complement Landauer's limit on the irreducible costs of information\ndestruction.\n", "  In this paper, we extend some usual techniques of classification resulting\nfrom a large-scale data-mining and network approach. This new technology, which\nin particular is designed to be suitable to big data, is used to construct an\nopen consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken from the US\npatent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only do we\nlook at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract\nthe relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic\napproach in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists\nin taking the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes.\nMoreover, we document that both approaches have highly different topological\nmeasures and strong statistical evidence that they feature a different model.\nThis suggests that our method is a useful tool to extract endogenous\ninformation.\n", "  Obtaining the exact multi-time correlations for one-dimensional growth models\ndescribed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class is presently an\noutstanding open problem. Here, we study the joint probability distribution\nfunction (JPDF) of the height of the KPZ equation with droplet initial\nconditions, at two different times $t_1<t_2$, in the limit where both times are\nlarge and their ratio $t_2/t_1$ is fixed. This maps to the JPDF of the free\nenergies of two directed polymers with two different lengths and in the same\nrandom potential. Using the replica Bethe ansatz (RBA) method, we obtain the\nexact tail of the JPDF when one of its argument (the KPZ height at the earlier\ntime $t_1$) is large and positive. Our formula interpolates between two limits\nwhere the JPDF decouples: (i) for $t_2/t_1 \\to +\\infty$ into a product of two\nGUE Tracy-Widom (TW) distributions, and (ii) for $t_2/t_1 \\to 1^+$ into a\nproduct of a GUE-TW distribution and a Baik-Rains distribution (associated to\nstationary KPZ evolution). The lowest cumulants of the height at time $t_2$,\nconditioned on the one at time $t_1$, are expressed analytically as expansions\naround these limits, and computed numerically for arbitrary $t_2/t_1$. Moreover\nwe compute the connected two-time correlation, conditioned to a large enough\nvalue at $t_1$, providing a quantitative prediction for the so-called\npersistence of correlations (or ergodicity breaking) in the time evolution from\nthe droplet initial condition. Our RBA results are then compared with arguments\nbased on Airy processes, with satisfactory agreement. These predictions are\nuniversal for all models in the KPZ class and should be testable in experiments\nand numerical simulations.\n", "  We suggest the new feature of primordial gravitational waves sourced by the\naxion-gauge couplings, whose forms are motivated by the dimensional reduction\nof the form field in the string theory.\n  In our inflationary model, as an inflaton we adopt two types of axion, dubbed\nthe model-independent axion and the model-dependent axion, which couple with\ntwo gauge groups with different sign combination each other.\n  Due to these forms both polarization modes of gauge fields are amplified and\nenhance both helicies of tensor modes during inflation.\n  We point out the possibility that a primordial blue-tilted tensor power\nspectra with small chirality are provided by the combination of these\naxion-gauge couplings, intriguingly both amplitudes and chirality are\npotentially testable by future space-based gravitational wave interferometers\nsuch as DECIGO and BBO project.\n", "  An accurate approach to calculate the optical response of periodic structures\nis proposed. Using the genuine superlattice eigenfunctions and energy\neigenvalues, the eigenfunctions parity symmetries, the subband symmetries and\nthe detached surface energy levels, we report new optical-transition selection\nrules and explicit optical-response calculations. Observed transitions that\nwere considered forbidden, become allowed and interesting optical-spectra\neffects emerge as fingerprints of intra-subband and surface states. The\nunexplained groups and isolated narrow peaks observed in high resolution\nblue-laser spectra, by Nakamura et al., are now fully explained and faithfully\nreproduced\n", "  Aims. We report the discovery of a strong outburst of the embedded young\nstellar object (YSO), namely UKIDSS-J185318.36+012454.5, located in the\nstar-forming region associated with IRAS 18507+0121 source and GAL 034.4+00.23\nHII region. Methods. Using the archival photometric data and images we\ndetermined the amplitude and the epoch of the outburst, as well as the\nevolution stage and the basic parameters of the object. Results. According to\nthe near and mid-infrared colors and spectral energy distribution, we classify\nthe object as an intermediate-mass young stellar object (YSO) with Class 0/I\nevolution stage. The outburst occurred in the period of 2004-2006. The\namplitude of brightness is as least Ks = 5.0 mag. The summation of the\nphotometric and spectral data does not allow to classify\nUKIDSS-J185318.36+012454.5 as FUor or EXor. We can consider it as an eruptive\nvariable with mixed characteristics or MNor type object.\n", "  We present an extensive study of the BL Lac object Mrk 501 based on a data\nset collected during the multi-instrument campaign spanning from 2009 March 15\nto 2009 August 1 which includes, among other instruments, MAGIC, VERITAS,\nWhipple 10-m, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT and VLBA. We find an increase\nin the fractional variability with energy, while no significant interband\ncorrelations of flux changes are found in the acquired data set. The higher\nvariability in the very high energy (>100 GeV, VHE) gamma-ray emission and the\nlack of correlation with the X-ray emission indicate that the highest-energy\nelectrons that are responsible for the VHE gamma-rays do not make a dominant\ncontribution to the ~1 keV emission. Alternatively, there could be a very\nvariable component contributing to the VHE gamma-ray emission in addition to\nthat coming from the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. The space of SSC\nmodel parameters is probed following a dedicated grid-scan strategy, allowing\nfor a wide range of models to be tested and offering a study of the degeneracy\nof model-to-data agreement in the individual model parameters. We find that\nthere is some degeneracy in both the one-zone and the two-zone SSC scenarios\nthat were probed, with several combinations of model parameters yielding a\nsimilar model-to-data agreement, and some parameters better constrained than\nothers. The SSC model grid-scan shows that the flaring activity around 2009 May\n22 cannot be modeled adequately with a one-zone SSC scenario, while it can be\nsuitably described within a two-independent-zone SSC scenario. The observation\nof an electric vector polarization angle rotation coincident with the gamma-ray\nflare from 2009 May 1 resembles those reported previously for low frequency\npeaked blazars, hence suggesting that there are many similarities in the\nflaring mechanisms of blazars with different jet properties.\n", "  Simultaneous recordings from N electrodes generate N-dimensional time series\nthat call for efficient representations to expose relevant aspects of the\nunderlying dynamics. Binning the time series defines neural activity vectors\nthat populate the N-dimensional space as a density distribution, especially\ninformative when the neural dynamics performs a noisy path through metastable\nstates (often a case of interest in neuroscience); this makes clustering in the\nN-dimensional space a natural choice. We apply a variant of the 'mean-shift'\nalgorithm to perform such clustering, and validate it on an Hopfield network in\nthe glassy phase, in which metastable states are uncorrelated from memory\nattractors. The neural states identified as clusters' centroids are then used\nto define a parsimonious parametrization of the synaptic matrix, which allows a\nsignificant improvement in inferring the synaptic couplings from neural\nactivities. We next consider the more realistic case of a multi-modular spiking\nnetwork, with spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) inducing history-dependent\neffects; we develop a procedure, inspired by Boltzmann learning but extending\nits domain of application, to learn inter-module synaptic couplings so that the\nspiking network reproduces a prescribed pattern of spatial correlations. After\nclustering the activity generated by multi-modular spiking networks, we\nrepresent their multi-dimensional dynamics as the symbolic sequence of the\nclusters' centroids, which naturally lends itself to complexity estimates that\nprovide information on memory effects like those induced by SFA. To obtain a\nrelative complexity measure we compare the Lempel-Ziv complexity of the actual\ncentroid sequence to the one of Markov processes sharing the same transition\nprobabilities between centroids; as an illustration, we show that the\ndependence of such relative complexity on the time scale of SFA.\n", "  The recent direct observation of gravitational waves has further emphasized\nthe desire for fast, low-cost, and accurate methods to infer the parameters of\ngravitational wave sources. Due to expense in waveform generation and data\nhandling, the cost of evaluating the likelihood function limits the\ncomputational performance of these calculations. Building on recently developed\nsurrogate models and a novel parameter estimation pipeline, we show how to\nquickly generate the likelihood function as an analytic, closed-form\nexpression. Using a straightforward variant of a production-scale parameter\nestimation code, we demonstrate our method using surrogate models of\neffective-one-body and numerical relativity waveforms. Our study is the first\ntime these models have been used for parameter estimation and one of the first\never parameter estimation calculations with multi-modal numerical relativity\nwaveforms, which include all l <= 4 modes. Our grid-free method enables rapid\nparameter estimation for any waveform with a suitable reduced-order model. The\nmethods described in this paper may also find use in other data analysis\nstudies, such as vetting coincident events or the computation of the\ncoalescing-compact-binary detection statistic.\n", "  We present the first results from applying the spectral inversion technique\nin the cloudy L dwarf regime. Our new framework provides a flexible approach to\nmodelling cloud opacity which can be built incrementally as the data requires,\nand improves upon previous retrieval experiments in the brown dwarf regime by\nallowing for scattering in two stream radiative transfer. Our first application\nof the tool to two mid-L dwarfs is able to reproduce their near-infrared\nspectra far more closely than grid models. Our retrieved thermal, chemical, and\ncloud profiles allow us to estimate $T_{\\rm eff} = 1796^{+23}_{-25}$ K and\n$\\log g = 5.21^{+0.05}_{-0.08}$ for 2MASS J05002100+0330501 and for 2MASSW\nJ2224438-015852 we find $T_{\\rm eff} = 1723^{+18}_{-19}$ K and $\\log g =\n5.31^{+0.04}_{-0.08}$, in close agreement with previous empirical estimates.\nOur best model for both objects includes an optically thick cloud deck which\npasses $\\tau_{cloud} \\geq 1$ (looking down) at a pressure of around 5 bar. The\ntemperature at this pressure is too high for silicate species to condense, and\nwe argue that corundum and/or iron clouds are responsible for this cloud\nopacity. Our retrieved profiles are cooler at depth, and warmer at altitude\nthan the forward grid models that we compare, and we argue that some form of\nheating mechanism may be at work in the upper atmospheres of these L dwarfs. We\nalso identify anomalously high CO abundance in both targets, which does not\ncorrelate with the warmth of our upper atmospheres or our choice of cloud\nmodel, and find similarly anomalous alkali abundance for one of our targets.\nThese anomalies may reflect unrecognised shortcomings in our retrieval model,\nor inaccuracies in our gas phase opacities.\n", "  Excitation of a semiconductor quantum dot with a chirped laser pulse allows\nexcitons to be created by rapid adiabatic passage. In quantum dots this process\ncan be greatly hindered by the coupling to phonons. Here we add a high chirp\nrate to ultra-short laser pulses and use these pulses to excite a single\nquantum dot. We demonstrate that we enter a regime where the exciton-phonon\ncoupling is effective for small pulse areas, while for higher pulse areas a\ndecoupling of the exciton from the phonons occurs. We thus discover a\nreappearance of rapid adiabatic passage, in analogy to the predicted\nreappearance of Rabi rotations at high pulse areas. The measured results are in\ngood agreement with theoretical calculations.\n", "  The Crab Nebula is the brightest TeV gamma-ray source in the sky and has been\nused for the past 25 years as a reference source in TeV astronomy, for\ncalibration and verification of new TeV instruments. The High Altitude Water\nCherenkov Observatory (HAWC), completed in early 2015, has been used to observe\nthe Crab Nebula at high significance across nearly the full spectrum of\nenergies to which HAWC is sensitive. HAWC is unique for its wide field-of-view,\nnearly 2 sr at any instant, and its high-energy reach, up to 100 TeV. HAWC's\nsensitivity improves with the gamma-ray energy. Above $\\sim$1 TeV the\nsensitivity is driven by the best background rejection and angular resolution\never achieved for a wide-field ground array.\n  We present a time-integrated analysis of the Crab using 507 live days of HAWC\ndata from 2014 November to 2016 June. The spectrum of the Crab is fit to a\nfunction of the form $\\phi(E) = \\phi_0 (E/E_{0})^{-\\alpha\n-\\beta\\cdot{\\rm{ln}}(E/E_{0})}$. The data is well-fit with values of\n$\\alpha=2.63\\pm0.03$, $\\beta=0.15\\pm0.03$, and\nlog$_{10}(\\phi_0~{\\rm{cm}^2}~{\\rm{s}}~{\\rm{TeV}})=-12.60\\pm0.02$ when $E_{0}$\nis fixed at 7 TeV and the fit applies between 1 and 37 TeV. Study of the\nsystematic errors in this HAWC measurement is discussed and estimated to be\n$\\pm$50\\% in the photon flux between 1 and 37 TeV.\n  Confirmation of the Crab flux serves to establish the HAWC instrument's\nsensitivity for surveys of the sky. The HAWC survey will exceed sensitivity of\ncurrent-generation observatories and open a new view of 2/3 of the sky above 10\nTeV.\n", "  Extended Air Showers produced by cosmic rays impinging on the earth\natmosphere irradiate radio frequency radiation through different mechanisms.\nUpon certain conditions, the emission has a coherent nature, with the\nconsequence that the emitted power is not proportional to the energy of the\nprimary cosmic rays, but to the energy squared. The effect was predicted in\n1962 by Askaryan and it is nowadays experimentally well established and\nexploited for the detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays.\n  In this paper we discuss in details the conditions for coherence, which in\nliterature have been too often taken for granted, and calculate them\nanalytically, finding a formulation which comprehends both the coherent and the\nincoherent emissions. We apply the result to the Cherenkov effect, obtaining\nthe same conclusions derived by Askaryan, and to the geosynchrotron radiation.\n", "  The prediction of a phase of inflation whose number of e-folds is constrained\nis an important feature of loop quantum cosmology. This work aims at giving\nsome elementary clarifications on the role of the different hypotheses leading\nto this conclusion. We show that the duration of inflation does not depend\nsignificantly on the modified background dynamics in the quantum regime.\n", "  We report on the size dependence of the surface tension of a free surface of\nan isotropic fluid. The size dependence of the surface tension is evaluated\nbased on the Gibbs-Tolman-Koenig-Buff equation for positive and negative values\nof curvatures and the Tolman lengths. For all combinations of positive and\nnegative signs of curvature and the Tolman length, we succeed to have a\ncontinuous function, avoiding the existing discontinuity at zero curvature\n(flat interfaces). As an example, a water droplet in the thermodynamical\nequilibrium with the vapor is analyzed in detail. The size dependence of the\nsurface tension and the Tolman length are evaluated with the use of\nexperimental data of the International Association for the Properties of Water\nand Steam. The evaluated Tolman length of our approach is in good agreement\nwith molecular dynamics and experimental data\n", "  Defects on surfaces of semiconductors have a strong effect on their\nreactivity and catalytic properties. The concentration of different charge\nstates of defects is determined by their formation energies. First-principles\ncalculations are an important tool for computing defect formation energies and\nfor studying the microscopic environment of the defect. The main problem\nassociated with the widely used supercell method in these calculations is the\nerror in the electrostatic energy, which is especially pronounced in\ncalculations that involve surface slabs and 2D materials. We present an\ninternally consistent approach for calculating defect formation energies in\ninhomogeneous and anisotropic dielectric environments, and demonstrate its\napplicability to the cases of the positively charged Cl vacancy on the NaCl\n(100) surface and the negatively charged S vacancy in monolayer MoS2.\n", "  The cumulative number count $N$, of sources above a threshold is known to\napproximately follow a power law behaviour $N\\propto S^{-x}$. We study the\nvariation of spectral index $x$ across the sky in order to look for possible\nsignals of violation of isotropy. We develop a rigorous algorithm of likelihood\nmaximisation to accurately fit for the spectral index. We divide the sky into\nupper and lower hemispheres for a particular choice of $z$-axis and determine\nthe difference $\\Delta x$ between the best fit values of the spectral indices\nbetween the two hemispheres. The maximum value of this difference obtained by\nvarying over the $z$-axis provides us with a measure of departure from\nisotropy. We find that the data support isotropy of the spectral index. The\nmaximum difference is found to be 1.3\\% of the full sky best fit value of $x$.\nThe deviation is found to be significant only at 2$\\sigma$ level which\nindicates a weak departure from isotropy. We also perform a dipole fit to the\nspectral index as a function of the angular coordinates. The result is found to\nbe consistent with isotropy.\n", "  Raman scattering in the three-dimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 shows an\nintricate interplay of electronic and phonon degrees of freedom. We observe\nresonant phonon scattering due to interband transitions, an anomalous\nanharmonicity of phonon frequency and intensity, as well as quasielastic (E~0)\nelectronic scattering. The latter two effects are governed by a characteristic\ntemperature scale T* ~ 100 K that is related to mutual fluctuations of lattice\nand electronic degrees of freedom. A refined analysis shows that this\ncharacteristic temperature corresponds to the energy of optical phonons which\ncouple to interband transitions in the Dirac states of Cd3As2. As\nelectron-phonon coupling in a topological semimetal is primarily related to\nphonons with finite momenta, the back action on the optical phonons in only\nobserved as anharmonicities via multi-phonon processes involving a broad range\nof momenta. The resulting energy density fluctuations of the coupled system\nhave previously only been observed in low dimensional or frustrated spin\nsystems with suppressed long range ordering.\n", "  We show how analogues of a large number of well-known nonlinear-optics\nphenomena can be realized with one or more two-level atoms coupled to one or\nmore resonator modes. Through higher-order processes, where virtual photons are\ncreated and annihilated, an effective deterministic coupling between two states\nof such a system can be created. In this way, analogues of three-wave mixing,\nfour-wave mixing, higher-harmonic and -subharmonic generation (i.e., up- and\ndownconversion), multiphoton absorption, parametric amplification, Raman and\nhyper-Raman scattering, the Kerr effect, and other nonlinear processes can be\nrealized. The effective coupling becomes weaker the more intermediate\ntransition steps are needed. However, given the recent experimental progress in\nultrastrong light-matter coupling, especially in the field of circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics, we estimate that many of these nonlinear-optics analogues can\nbe realized with currently available technology.\n", "  We have used Brillouin Light Scattering spectroscopy to independently\ndetermine the in-plane Magneto-Crystalline Anisotropy and the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) in out-of-plane magnetized\nAu/Co/W(110). We found that the DMI strength is 2-3 times larger along the\nbcc$[\\bar{1}10]$ than along the bcc$[001]$ direction. We use analytical\nconsiderations to illustrate the relationship between the crystal symmetry of\nthe stack and the anisotropy of microscopic DMI. Such an anisotropic DMI is the\nfirst step to realize isolated elliptical skyrmions or anti-skyrmions in thin\nfilm systems with $C_{2v}$ symmetry.\n", "  We construct explicit examples of microstate geometries of four-dimensional\nblack holes that lift to smooth horizon-free geometries in five dimensions.\nSolutions consist of half-BPS D-brane atoms distributed in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nCharges and positions of the D-brane centers are constrained by the bubble\nequations and boundary conditions ensuring the regularity of the metric and the\nmatch with the black hole geometry. In the case of three centers, we find that\nthe moduli spaces of solutions includes disjoint one-dimensional components of\n(generically) finite volume.\n", "  Electrons in periodic potentials exhibit oscillatory motion in presence of an\nelectric field. Such oscillations are known as Bloch oscillations. In this\narticle we theoretically investigate the emergence of Bloch oscillations for\nsystems where the electric field is confined to a finite region, like in\ntypical electronic devices. We use a one-dimensional tight-binding model within\nthe single-band approximation to numerically study the dynamics of electrons\nafter a sudden switching-on of the electric field. We find a transition from a\nregime with direct current to Bloch oscillations when increasing the system\nsize or decreasing the field strength. We propose a pump-probe scheme to\nobserve the oscillations by measuring the accumulated charge as a function of\nthe pulse-length.\n", "  The Thomson optical depth from reionization is a limiting factor in measuring\nthe amplitude of primordial fluctuations, and hence in measuring physics that\naffects the low-redshift amplitude, such as the neutrino masses. Current\nconstraints on the optical depth, based on directly measuring large-scale\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, are challenging due to\nforegrounds and systematic effects. Here, we consider an indirect measurement\nof large-scale polarization, using observed maps of small-scale polarization\ntogether with maps of fields that distort the CMB, such as CMB lensing and\npatchy reionization. We find that very futuristic CMB surveys will be able to\nreconstruct large-scale polarization, and thus the mean optical depth, using\nonly measurements on small scales.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions can be considered as topologically protected localized\nvortex-like spin textures. Due to their stability, their small size, and the\npossibility to move them by low electric currents they are promising candidates\nfor spintronic devices. Without violating topological protection, it is\npossible to create skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs, as long as the total charge\nremains unchanged. We derive a skyrmion equation of motion which reveals how\nspin-polarized charge currents create skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs. It allows to\nidentify general prerequisites for the pair creation process. We corroborate\nthese general principles by numerical simulations. On a lattice, where\ntopological protection becomes imperfect, the antiskyrmion partner of the pairs\nis annihilated and only the skyrmion survives. This eventually changes the\ntotal skyrmion number and yields a new way of creating and controlling\nskyrmions.\n", "  We present an approach for computing long-range van der Waals (vdW)\ninteractions between complex molecular systems and arbitrarily shaped\nmacroscopic bodies, melding atomistic treatments of electronic fluctuations\nbased on density functional theory in the former, with continuum descriptions\nof strongly shape-dependent electromagnetic fields in the latter, thus\ncapturing many-body and multiple scattering effects to all orders. Such a\ntheory is especially important when considering vdW interactions at mesoscopic\nscales, i.e. between molecules and structured surfaces with features on the\nscale of molecular sizes, in which case the finite sizes, complex shapes, and\nresulting nonlocal electronic excitations of molecules are strongly influenced\nby electromagnetic retardation and wave effects that depend crucially on the\nshapes of surrounding macroscopic bodies. We show that these effects together\ncan modify vdW interactions by orders of magnitude compared to previous\ntreatments based on Casimir--Polder or non-retarded approximations, which are\nvalid only at macroscopically large or atomic-scale separations, respectively.\n", "  Motivated by the problem of stability of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we\ndiscuss nonlinear gravitational perturbations of maximally symmetric solutions\nof vacuum Einstein equations in general and the case of AdS in particular. We\npresent the evidence that, similarly to the self-gravitating scalar field at\nspherical symmetry, the negative cosmological constant allows for the existence\nof globally regular, asymptotically AdS, time-periodic solutions of vacuum\nEinstein equations whose frequencies bifurcate from linear eigenfrequencies of\nAdS. Interestingly, our preliminary results indicate that the number of one\nparameter families of time-periodic solutions bifurcating from a given\neigenfrequency equals the multiplicity of this eigenfrequency.\n", "  Metallic phases have been observed in several disordered two dimensional (2d)\nsystems, including thin films near superconductor-insulator transitions and\nquantum Hall systems near plateau transitions. The existence of 2d metallic\nphases at zero temperature generally requires an interplay of disorder and\ninteraction effects. Consequently, experimental observations of 2d metallic\nbehavior have largely defied explanation. We formulate a general stability\ncriterion for strongly interacting, massless Dirac fermions against disorder,\nwhich describe metallic ground states with vanishing density of states. We show\nthat (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with a large, even\nnumber of fermion flavors remains metallic in the presence of weak scalar\npotential disorder due to the dynamic screening of disorder by gauge\nfluctuations. We also show that QED$_3$ with weak mass disorder exhibits a\nstable, dirty metallic phase in which both interactions and disorder play\nimportant roles.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically study the effect of the intraspecies\nscattering length onto the heteronuclear Efimov scenario, following up on our\nearlier observation of Efimov resonances in an ultracold Cs-Li mixture for\nnegative [Pires et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 250404 (2014)] and positive Cs-Cs\nscattering length [Ulmanis et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 153201 (2016)]. Three\ntheoretical models of increasing complexity are employed to quantify its\ninfluence on the scaling factor and the three-body parameter: a simple\nBorn-Oppenheimer picture, a zero-range theory, and a spinless van der Waals\nmodel. These models are compared to Efimov resonances observed in an ultracold\nmixture of bosonic $^{133}$Cs and fermionic $^6$Li atoms close to two Cs-Li\nFeshbach resonances located at 843 G and 889 G, characterized by different sign\nand magnitude of the Cs-Cs interaction. By changing the sign and magnitude of\nthe intraspecies scattering length different scaling behaviors of the\nthree-body loss rate are identified, in qualitative agreement with theoretical\npredictions. The three-body loss rate is strongly influenced by the\nintraspecies scattering length.\n", "  Three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics exhibits a number of interesting\nproperties, such as dynamical chiral symmetry breaking, weak confinement, and\nnon-Fermi liquid behavior, and also has wide applications in condensed matter\nphysics. We study the effects of random potentials, which exist in almost all\nrealistic condensed-matter systems, on the low-energy behaviors of massless\nDirac fermions by means of renormalization group method, and show that the role\nof random mass is significantly enhanced by the gauge interaction, whereas\nrandom scalar and vector potentials are insusceptible to the gauge interaction\nat the one-loop order. The static random potential breaks the Lorentz\ninvariance, and as such induces unusual renormalization of fermion velocity. We\nthen consider the case in which three types of random potentials coexist in the\nsystem. The random scalar potential is found to play a dominant role in the\nlow-energy region, and drives the system to undergo a quantum phase transition.\n", "  After more than a century of debate, there remains continuing discomfort over\nwhat is the correct expression for the electromagnetic momentum in a dielectric\nmedium. This is the so-called the Minkowski-Abraham controversy. We show that\nthere is indeed a consistent picture for the electromagnetic momentum\nassociated with waves in a dielectric, but one must start with the fields E and\nB, not D and H as fundamental objects. The momentum flow is described by a\ntensor T^EB, where the expression is identical to that in vacuum. The Minkowski\ntensor and the Abraham force result from a fractured decomposition of the\nmaterial momentum. However, for well localized fields, the Minkowski momentum\nis conserved, consistent with its identification as the canonical momentum.\nSeveral cases are discussed to demonstrate that this perspective is consistent\nand complete. In addition, it is shown that that care must be taken to include\nmomentum transfer to bound charges at dielectric interfaces to correctly\ndescribe, for example, oblique reflections, where there is a normal component\nof the electric field.\n", "  Current measurements of the temperature and polarization anisotropy power\nspectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) seem to indicate that the\nnaive expectation for the slow-roll hierarchy within the most simple\ninflationary paradigm may not be respected in nature. We show that a primordial\npower spectra with localized features could in principle give rise to the\nobserved slow-roll anarchy when fitted to a featureless power spectrum. Future\nCMB missions have the key to disentangle among the two possible paradigms and\nfirmly establish the slow-roll mechanism as the responsible one for the\ninflationary period in the early universe. From a model comparison perspective,\nand assuming that nature has chosen a featureless primordial power spectrum, we\nfind that, while with mock Planck data there is only weak evidence against a\nmodel with localized features, upcoming CMB measurements may provide strong\nevidence against such a non-standard primordial power spectrum.\n", "  We use flux-transmission correlations in \\Lya forests to measure the imprint\nof baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). The study uses spectra of 157,783\nquasars in the redshift range $2.1\\le z \\le 3.5$ from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12). Besides the statistical improvements on\nour previous studies using SDSS DR9 and DR11, we have implemented numerous\nimprovements in the analysis procedure, allowing us to construct a physical\nmodel of the correlation function and to investigate potential systematic\nerrors in the determination of the BAO peak position. The Hubble distance,\n$\\DHub=c/H(z)$, relative to the sound horizon is $\\DHub(z=2.33)/r_d=9.07 \\pm\n0.31$. The best-determined combination of comoving angular-diameter distance,\n$\\DM$, and the Hubble distance is found to be\n$\\DHub^{0.7}\\DM^{0.3}/r_d=13.94\\pm0.35$. This value is $1.028\\pm0.026$ times\nthe prediction of the flat-\\lcdm model consistent with the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropy spectrum. The errors include marginalization over\nthe effects of unidentified high-density absorption systems and fluctuations in\nultraviolet ionizing radiation. Independently of the CMB measurements, the\ncombination of our results and other BAO observations determine the open-\\lcdm\ndensity parameters to be $\\om=0.296 \\pm 0.029$, $\\ol=0.699 \\pm 0.100$ and\n$\\Omega_k = -0.002 \\pm 0.119$.\n", "  In the present article, we discover a new well-behaved charged anisotropic\nsolution of Einstein-Maxwell's field equations. We ansatz the metric potential\n$g_{00}$ of the form given by Maurya el al. (arXiv:1607.05582v1) with $n=2$. In\ntheir article it is mentioned that for $n=2$ the solution is not well-behaved\nfor neutral configuration as the speed of sound is non-decreasing radially\noutward. However, the solution can represent a physically possible\nconfiguration with the inclusion of some net electric charged i.e. the solution\ncan become a well-behaved solution with decreasing sound speed radially outward\nfor a charged configuration. Due to the inclusion of electric charged the\nsolution leads to a very stiff equation of state (EoS) with the velocity of\nsound at the center $v_{r0}^2=0.819, ~v_{t0}^2=0.923$ and the compactness\nparameter $u=0.823$ is closed to the Buchdahl limit 0.889. This stiff EoS\nsupport a compact star configuration of mass $5.418M_\\odot$ and radius of $10.1\nkm$.\n", "  We report a Dynamical Cluster Approximation (DCA) investigation of the doped\nperiodic Anderson model (PAM) to explain the universal scaling in the Knight\nshift anomaly predicted by the phenomenological two-fluid model and confirmed\nin many heavy-fermion compounds. We calculate the quantitative evolution of the\norbital-dependent magnetic susceptibility and reproduce correctly the two-fluid\nprediction in a large range of doping and hybridization. Our results confirm\nthe presence of a temperature/energy scale $T^{\\ast}$ for the universal scaling\nand show distinctive behavors of the Knight shift anomaly in response to other\n\"orders\" at low temperatures. However, comparison with the temperature\nevolution of the calculated resistivity and quasiparticle spectral peak\nindicates a different characteristic temperature from $T^*$, in contradiction\nwith the experimental observation in CeCoIn$_5$ and other compounds. This\nreveals a missing piece in the current model calculations in explaining the\ntwo-fluid phenomenology.\n", "  We use post-Newtonian (PN) approximations to determine the initial orbital\nand spin parameters of black hole binaries that lead to low-eccentricity\ninspirals when evolved with numerical relativity techniques. In particular, we\nseek initial configurations that lead to very small eccentricities at small\nseparations, as is expected for astrophysical systems. We consider three cases:\n(i) quasicircular orbits with no radial velocity, (ii) quasicircular orbits\nwith an initial radial velocity determined by radiation reaction, and (iii)\nparameters obtained form evolution of the PN equations of motion from much\nlarger separations. We study seven cases of spinning, nonprecessing, unequal\nmass binaries. We then use several definitions of the eccentricity, based on\norbital separations and waveform phase and amplitude, and find that using the\ncomplete 3PN Hamiltonian for quasicircular orbits to obtain the tangential\norbital momentum, and using the highest-known-order radiation reaction\nexpressions to obtain the radial momentum, leads to the lowest eccentricity.\nThe accuracy of this method even exceeds that of inspiral data based on 3PN and\n4PN evolutions.\n", "  We examined the viability of new-type charged Q-ball dark matter scenario. We\nconsidered the case where the relics can be treated as ordinary ions, to which\nwe applied the observational constraint from MICA experiment, where no trail of\nheavy ion-like object is observed in $10^9$ years old ancient muscovite mica.\nWe have found that the allowed parameter region exists but is smaller than the\nneutral Q-ball dark matter case. We have also discussed whether our scenario is\nactually consistent with Affleck-Dine mechanism.\n", "  We compare electronic structures of single FeSe layer films on SrTiO$_3$\nsubstrate (FeSe/STO) and K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ superconductors obtained from\nextensive LDA and LDA+DMFT calculations with the results of ARPES experiments.\nIt is demonstrated that correlation effects on Fe-3d states are sufficient in\nprinciple to explain the formation of the shallow electron -- like bands at the\nM(X)-point. However, in FeSe/STO these effects alone are apparently\ninsufficient for the simultaneous elimination of the hole -- like Fermi surface\naround the $\\Gamma$-point which is not observed in ARPES experiments. Detailed\ncomparison of ARPES detected and calculated quasiparticle bands shows\nreasonable agreement between theory and experiment. Analysis of the bands with\nrespect to their origin and orbital composition shows, that for FeSe/STO system\nthe experimentally observed \"replica\" quasiparticle band at the M-point\n(usually attributed to forward scattering interactions with optical phonons in\nSrTiO$_3$ substrate) can be reasonably understood just as the LDA calculated\nFe-3d$_{xy}$ band, renormalized by electronic correlations. The only\nmanifestation of the substrate reduces to lifting the degeneracy between\nFe-3d$_{xz}$ and Fe-3d$_{yz}$ bands in the vicinity of M-point. For the case of\nK$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ most bands observed in ARPES can also be understood as\ncorrelation renormalized Fe-3d LDA calculated bands, with overall semi --\nquantitative agreement with LDA+DMFT calculations.\n", "  Electronic states in 2D materials can exhibit pseudospin degrees of freedom,\nwhich allow for unique carrier-field interaction scenarios. Here, we\ninvestigate ultrafast sublattice pseudospin relaxation in graphene by means of\npolarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. Comparison with\nmicroscopic Boltzmann simulations allows to determine a lifetime of the\noptically aligned pseudospin distribution of $12\\pm 2\\,\\text{fs}$. This\nexperimental approach extends the toolbox of graphene pseudospintronics,\nproviding novel means to investigate pseudospin dynamics in active devices or\nunder external fields.\n", "  We analyse the dynamics leading to radiative cooling of an atomic ensemble\nconfined inside an optical cavity when the atomic dipolar transitions are\nincoherently pumped and can synchronize. Our study is performed in the\nsemiclassical regime and assumes that cavity decay is the largest rate in the\nsystem dynamics. We identify three regimes characterising the cooling. At first\nhot atoms are individually cooled by the cavity friction forces. After this\nstage, the atoms' center-of-mass motion is further cooled by the coupling to\nthe internal degrees of freedom while the dipoles synchronize. In the latest\nstage dipole-dipole correlations are stationary and the center-of-mass motion\nis determined by the interplay between friction and dispersive forces due to\nthe coupling with the collective dipole. We analyse this asymptotic regime by\nmeans of a mean-field model and show that the width of the momentum\ndistribution can be of the order of the photon recoil. Furthermore, the\ninternal excitations oscillate spatially with the cavity standing wave forming\nan antiferromagnetic-like order.\n", "  Stimuli-responsive materials that modify their shape in response to changes\nin environmental conditions -- such as solute concentration, temperature, pH,\nand stress -- are widespread in nature and technology. Applications include\nmicro- and nanoporous materials used in filtration and flow control. The\nphysiochemical mechanisms that induce internal volume modifications have been\nwidely studies. The coupling between induced volume changes and solute\ntransport through porous materials, however, is not well understood. Here, we\nconsider advective and diffusive transport through a small channel linking two\nlarge reservoirs. A section of stimulus-responsive material regulates the\nchannel permeability, which is a function of the local solute concentration. We\nderive an exact solution to the coupled transport problem and demonstrate the\nexistence of a flow regime in which the steady state is reached via a damped\noscillation around the equilibrium concentration value. Finally, the\nfeasibility of an experimental observation of the phenomena is discussed.\nPlease note that this version of the paper has not been formally peer reviewed,\nrevised or accepted by a journal.\n", "  The rates for generating a matter-antimatter asymmetry in extensions of the\nStandard Model (SM) containing right-handed neutrinos are the most interesting\nand least trivial coefficients in the rate equations for baryogenesis through\nthermal leptogenesis. We obtain a relation of these rates to finite-temperature\nreal-time correlation functions, similar to the Kubo formulas for transport\ncoefficients. Then we consider the case of hierarchical masses for the sterile\nneutrinos. At leading order in their Yukawa couplings we find a simple master\nformula which relates the rates to a single finite temperature three-point\nspectral function. It is valid to all orders in $g$,where $g$ denotes a SM\ngauge or quark Yukawa coupling. We use it to compute the rate for generating a\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry at next-to-leading order in g in the\nnon-relativistic regime. The corrections are of order $g ^ 2$, and they amount\nto 4% or less.\n", "  We model quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene monolayer at quarter filling by a\ntheory of CP3 fields and study the energy minimizing skyrmions in presence of\nvalley pseudospin anisotropy and Zeeman coupling. We present a diagram of all\ntypes of skyrmions in a wide range of the anisotropy parameters. For each type\nof skyrmion, we visualize it on three Bloch spheres, and present the profiles\nof its texture on the graphene honeycomb lattice, thus providing references for\nthe STM/STS imaging of spin-pseudospin textures in graphene monolayer in\nquantum Hall regime. Besides the spin and pseudospin skyrmions for the\ncorresponding degrees of freedom of an electron in the N=0 Landau level, we\ndiscuss two unusual types -- the \"entanglement skyrmion\" whose texture lies in\nthe space of the entanglement of spin and pseudospin, as well as the \"deflated\npseudospin skyrmion\" with partial entanglement. For all skyrmion types, we\nstudy the dependence of the energy and the size of a skyrmion on the anisotropy\nparameters and perpendicular magnetic field. We also propose three ways to\nmodify the anisotropy energy, namely the sample tilting, the substrate\nanisotropy and the valley pseudospin analogue of Zeeman coupling.\n", "  We investigate the structure of neutron star crusts, including the crust-core\nboundary, based on new Skyrme mean field models constrained by the bulk-matter\nequation of state from chiral effective field theory and the ground-state\nenergies of doubly-magic nuclei. Nuclear pasta phases are studied using both\nthe liquid drop model as well as the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We compare the\nenergy per nucleon for each geometry (spherical nuclei, cylindrical nuclei,\nnuclear slabs, cylindrical holes, and spherical holes) to obtain the ground\nstate phase as a function of density. We find that the size of the Wigner-Seitz\ncell depends strongly on the model parameters, especially the coefficients of\nthe density gradient interaction terms. We employ also the thermodynamic\ninstability method to check the validity of the numerical solutions based on\nenergy comparisons.\n", "  We propose and analyze a variational wave function for a\npopulation-imbalanced one-dimensional Fermi gas that allows for\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type pairing correlations among the two\nfermion species, while also accounting for the harmonic confining potential. In\nthe strongly interacting regime, we find large spatial oscillations of the\norder parameter, indicative of an FFLO state. The obtained density profiles\nversus imbalance are consistent with recent experimental results as well as\nwith theoretical calculations based on combining Bethe ansatz with the local\ndensity approximation. Although we find no signature of the FFLO state in the\ndensities of the two fermion species, we show that the oscillations of the\norder parameter appear in density-density correlations, both in-situ and after\nfree expansion. Furthermore, above a critical polarization, the value of which\ndepends on the interaction, we find the unpaired Fermi-gas state to be\nenergetically more favorable.\n", "  We present the first catalog of TeV gamma-ray sources realized with the\nrecently completed High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). It is the\nmost sensitive wide field-of-view TeV telescope currently in operation, with a\n1-year survey sensitivity of ~5-10% of the flux of the Crab Nebula. With an\ninstantaneous field of view >1.5 sr and >90% duty cycle, it continuously\nsurveys and monitors the sky for gamma ray energies between hundreds GeV and\ntens of TeV.\n  HAWC is located in Mexico at a latitude of 19 degree North and was completed\nin March 2015. Here, we present the 2HWC catalog, which is the result of the\nfirst source search realized with the complete HAWC detector. Realized with 507\ndays of data and represents the most sensitive TeV survey to date for such a\nlarge fraction of the sky. A total of 39 sources were detected, with an\nexpected contamination of 0.5 due to background fluctuation. Out of these\nsources, 16 are more than one degree away from any previously reported TeV\nsource. The source list, including the position measurement, spectrum\nmeasurement, and uncertainties, is reported. Seven of the detected sources may\nbe associated with pulsar wind nebulae, two with supernova remnants, two with\nblazars, and the remaining 23 have no firm identification yet.\n", "  Alfv\\'enic fluctuations in the solar wind display many properties reflecting\nan ongoing nonlinear cascade, e.g. a well-defined spectrum in frequency,\ntogether with some characteristics more commonly associated with the linear\npropagation of waves from the Sun, such as the variation of fluctuation\namplitude with distance, dominated by solar wind expansion effects. Therefore\nboth nonlinearities and expansion must be included simultaneously in any\nsuccessful model of solar wind turbulence evolution. Because of the disparate\nspatial scales involved, direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the\nsolar wind represent an arduous task, especially if one wants to go beyond the\nincompressible approximation. Indeed, most simulations neglect solar wind\nexpansion effects entirely. Here we develop a numerical model to simulate\nturbulent fluctuations from the outer corona to 1 AU and beyond, including the\nsub-Alfv\\'enic corona. The accelerating expanding box (AEB) extends the\nvalidity of previous expanding box models by taking into account both the\nacceleration of the solar wind and the inhomogeneity of background density and\nmagnetic field. Our method incorporates a background accelerating wind within a\nmagnetic field that naturally follows the Parker spiral evolution using a\ntwo-scale analysis in which the macroscopic spatial effect coupling\nfluctuations with background gradients becomes a time-dependent coupling term\nin a homogeneous box. In this paper we describe the AEB model in detail and\ndiscuss its main properties, illustrating its validity by studying Alfv\\'en\nwave propagation across the Alfv\\'en critical point.\n", "  Gapless topological phases of matter may host emergent quasiparticle\nexcitations which have no analog in quantum field theory. This is the case of\nso called triple point fermions (TPF), quasiparticle excitations protected by\ncrystal symmetries, which show fermionic statistics but have an integer\n(pseudo)spin degree of freedom. TPFs have been predicted in certain\nthree-dimensional non-symmorphic crystals, where they are pinned to high\nsymmetry points of the Brillouin zone. In this work, we introduce a minimal,\nthree-band model which hosts TPFs protected only by the combination of a C4\nrotation and an anti-commuting mirror symmetry. Unlike current non-symmorphic\nrealizations, our model allows for TPFs which are anisotropic and can be\ncreated or annihilated pairwise. It provides a simple, numerically affordable\nplatform for their study.\n", "  We report the first theoretical calculations of excited state absorptions\n(ESAs) from the singlet and triplet excitons, as well as the key intermediate\nin the singlet fission (SF) process, the spin singlet multiexciton\ntriplet-triplet state, for solid pentacene with herringbone crystal structure.\nOur goal is to compare theoretical results against ultrafast transient\nphotoinduced absorption (PA) measurements and their interpretations, which have\nremained controversial. We show that the elusive triplet-triplet state absorbs\nboth in the visible and near infrared (NIR), at or close to the PA energies\nassigned to the free triplet exciton. In contrast, the triplet PA has nearly\nvanishing oscillator strength in the NIR within the rigid herringbone\nstructure. Observable oscillator strength for NIR triplet PA requires\nphotoinduced enhancement of coupling between a pair of neighboring pentacene\nmolecules that confers significant charge-transfer (CT) character to the\ntriplet exciton. We discuss the implication of our results for efficient SF in\npentacene and related materials.\n", "  Motivated by the unusual temperature dependence of the specific heat in MnSi,\ncomprising a combination of a sharp first-order feature accompanied by a broad\nhump, we study the extended Heisenberg model with competing exchange $J$ and\nanisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya $D$ interactions in a broad range of ratio\n$D/J$. Utilizing classical Monte Carlo simulations we find an evolution of the\ntemperature dependence of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility with\nvariation of $D/J$. Combined with an analysis of the Bragg intensity patterns,\nwe clearly demonstrate that the observed puzzling hump in the specific heat of\nMnSi originates from smearing out of the virtual ferromagnetic second order\nphase transition by helical fluctuations, which manifest themselves in the\ntransient multiple spiral state. These fluctuations finally condense into the\nhelical ordered phase via a first order phase transition as is indicated by the\nspecific heat peak. Thus the model demonstrates a crossover from a second-order\nto a first-order transition with increasing $D/J$. Upon further increasing\n$D/J$ another crossover from a first-order to a second-order transition takes\nplace in the system. Moreover, the results of the calculations clearly indicate\nthat these competing interactions are the primary factor responsible for the\nappearance of first order phase transitions in helical magnets with the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction.\n", "  We introduce an efficient algorithm for the computation of the $W_3$\ninvariant of general unitary maps, which converges rapidly even on coarse\ndiscretization grids. The algorithm does not require extensive manipulation of\nthe unitary maps, identification of the precise positions of degeneracy points,\nor fixing the gauge of eigenvectors. After construction of the general\nalgorithm, we explain its application to the $2+1$ dimensional maps that arise\nin the Floquet-Bloch theory of periodically driven two-dimensional quantum\nsystems. We demonstrate this application by computing the $W_3$ invariant for\nan irradiated graphene model with a continuously modulated Hamilton operator,\nwhere it predicts the number of anomalous edge states in each gap.\n", "  In materials that are exposed to thermodynamic potential gradients, i.e.,\ngradients of chemical potentials, electrical potential, temperature, or\npressure, transport processes of the mobile components occur. These transport\nprocesses and the coupling between different processes are not only of\nfundamental interest, but are also the origin of several degradation processes,\nsuch as kinetic unmixing and decomposition. In addition, changes in the\nmorphology of the material surfaces and interfaces may appear. In this paper, a\ncomprehensive formal treatment of the coupled morphological stability of\nmultiple phase boundaries will be given for oxides that are exposed to an\noxygen potential gradient.\n", "  We take advantage of the Gaia-ESO Survey iDR4 bulge data to search for\nabundance anomalies that could shed light on the composite nature of the Milky\nWay bulge. The alpha-elements (Mg, Si, and whenever available, Ca) abundances,\nand their trends with Fe abundances have been analysed for a total of 776 bulge\nstars. In addition, the aluminum abundances and their ratio to Fe and Mg have\nalso been examined. Our analysis reveals the existence of low-alpha element\nabundance stars with respect to the standard bulge sequence in the [alpha/Fe]\nvs. [Fe/H] plane. 18 objects present deviations in [alpha/Fe] ranging from 2.1\nto 5.3 sigma with respect to the median standard value. Those stars do not show\nMg-Al anti-correlation patterns. Incidentally, this sign of the existence of\nmultiple stellar populations is reported firmly for the first time for the\nbulge globular cluster NGC 6522. The identified low-alpha abundance stars have\nchemical patterns compatible with those of the thin disc. Their link with\nmassive dwarf galaxies accretion seems unlikely, as larger deviations in alpha\nabundance and Al would be expected. The vision of a bulge composite nature and\na complex formation process is reinforced by our results. The used approach, a\nmulti-method and model-driven analysis of high resolution data seems crucial to\nreveal this complexity.\n", "  We report on two ultrastable lasers each stabilized to independent silicon\nFabry-P\\'erot cavities operated at 124 K. The fractional frequency instability\nof each laser is completely determined by the fundamental thermal Brownian\nnoise of the mirror coatings with a flicker noise floor of $4 \\times 10^{-17}$\nfor integration times between 0.8 s and a few tens of seconds. We rigorously\ntreat the notorious divergencies encountered with the associated flicker\nfrequency noise and derive methods to relate this noise to observable and\npractically relevant linewidths and coherence times. The individual laser\nlinewidth obtained from the phase noise spectrum or the direct beat note\nbetween the two lasers can be as small as 5 mHz at 194 THz. From the measured\nphase evolution between the two laser fields we derive usable phase coherence\ntimes for different applications of 11 s and 60 s.\n", "  Quantum electrodynamics in 2+1-dimensions (QED$_3$) is a strongly coupled\nconformal field theory (CFT) of a U(1) gauge field coupled to $2N$\ntwo-component massless fermions. The $N=2$ CFT has been proposed as a ground\nstate of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We study QED$_3$ in\nthe presence of weak quenched disorder in its two spatial directions. When the\ndisorder explicitly breaks the fermion flavor symmetry from\nSU($2N$)$\\rightarrow$U(1)$\\times$SU($N$) but preserves time-reversal symmetry,\nwe find that the theory flows to a non-trivial fixed line at non-zero disorder\nwith a continuously varying dynamical critical exponent $z>1$. We determine the\nzero-temperature flavor (spin) conductivity along the critical line. Our\ncalculations are performed in the large-$N$ limit, and the disorder is handled\nusing the replica method.\n", "  Series expansions of unknown fields $\\Phi=\\sum\\varphi_n Z_n$ in elongated\nwaveguides are commonly used in acoustics, optics, geophysics, water waves and\nother applications, in the context of coupled-mode theories (CMTs). The\ntransverse functions $Z_n$ are determined by solving local Sturm-Liouville\nproblems (reference waveguides). In most cases, the boundary conditions\nassigned to $Z_n$ cannot be compatible with the physical boundary conditions of\n$\\Phi$, leading to slowly convergent series, and rendering CMTs mild-slope\napproximations. In the present paper, the heuristic approach introduced in\n(Athanassoulis & Belibassakis 1999, J. Fluid Mech. 389, 275-301) is generalized\nand justified. It is proved that an appropriately enhanced series expansion\nbecomes an exact, rapidly-convergent representation of the field $\\Phi$, valid\nfor any smooth, nonplanar boundaries and any smooth enough $\\Phi$. This series\nexpansion can be differentiated termwise everywhere in the domain, including\nthe boundaries, implementing an exact semi-separation of variables for\nnon-separable domains. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by solving a\nboundary value problem for the Laplace equation, and computing the\ncorresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, involved in Hamiltonian equations\nfor nonlinear water waves. The present method provides accurate results with\nonly a few modes for quite general domains. Extensions to general waveguides\nare also discussed.\n", "  We report a detailed study of the transport coefficients of\n$\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ quasi-one dimensional topological insulator. Electrical\nresistivity, thermoelectric power, thermal conductivity and Hall coefficient\nmeasurements are consistent with the possible appearance of a charge density\nwave order at low temperatures. Both electrons and holes contribute to the\nconduction in $\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ and the dominant type of charge carrier\nchanges with temperature as a consequence of temperature-dependent carrier\ndensities and mobilities. Measurements of resistivity and Seebeck coefficient\nunder hydrostatic pressure up to 2 GPa show a shift of the charge density wave\norder to higher temperatures suggesting a strongly one-dimensional character at\nambient pressure. Surprisingly, superconductivity is induced in\n$\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ above 10 GPa with of 4.0 K which is slightly decreasing\nupon increasing the pressure up to 20 GPa. Chemical characterisation of the\npressure-treated samples shows amorphization of $\\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ under\npressure and rules out decomposition into Bi and BiI$_3$ at room-temperature\nconditions.\n", "  We present the results of a Chandra X-ray survey of the 8 most massive galaxy\nclusters at z>1.2 in the South Pole Telescope 2500 deg^2 survey. We combine\nthis sample with previously-published Chandra observations of 49 massive\nX-ray-selected clusters at 0<z<0.1 and 90 SZ-selected clusters at 0.25<z<1.2 to\nconstrain the evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM) over the past ~10 Gyr.\nWe find that the bulk of the ICM has evolved self similarly over the full\nredshift range probed here, with the ICM density at r>0.2R500 scaling like\nE(z)^2. In the centers of clusters (r<0.1R500), we find significant deviations\nfrom self similarity (n_e ~ E(z)^{0.1+/-0.5}), consistent with no redshift\ndependence. When we isolate clusters with over-dense cores (i.e., cool cores),\nwe find that the average over-density profile has not evolved with redshift --\nthat is, cool cores have not changed in size, density, or total mass over the\npast ~9-10 Gyr. We show that the evolving \"cuspiness\" of clusters in the X-ray,\nreported by several previous studies, can be understood in the context of a\ncool core with fixed properties embedded in a self similarly-evolving cluster.\nWe find no measurable evolution in the X-ray morphology of massive clusters,\nseemingly in tension with the rapidly-rising (with redshift) rate of major\nmergers predicted by cosmological simulations. We show that these two results\ncan be brought into agreement if we assume that the relaxation time after a\nmerger is proportional to the crossing time, since the latter is proportional\nto H(z)^(-1).\n", "  We study the singly-Cabibbo-suppressed decays $\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to p\\eta$ and\n$\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\\to p\\pi^{0}$ using $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ pairs\nproduced by $e^+e^-$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 4.6\\;\nGeV$. The data sample was collected by the BESIII detector at the BEPCII\ncollider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 567 $pb^{-1}$.\n  We find the first evidence for the decay $\\Lambda_{c}^{+}\\to p \\eta$ with a\nstatistical significance of $4.2\\sigma$ and measure its branching fraction to\nbe $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+\\to p\\eta)=\n(1.24\\pm0.28({\\rm{stat.}})\\pm0.10({\\rm{syst.}}))\\times10^{-3}$.\n  No significant $\\Lambda_c^+ \\to p\\pi^0$ signal is observed. We set an upper\nlimit on its branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to p\\pi^{0}) < 2.7\n\\times 10^{-4}$ at the 90% confidence level.\n", "  Same-sign $W$ boson pairs production is a promising channel to look for\nsignatures of double parton interactions at the LHC. The corresponding cross\nsection has been calculated by using double parton distribution functions,\nencoding two parton correlations, evaluated in a Light-Front quark model. The\nobtained result is in line with previous estimates which make use of an\nexternal parameter, the so called effective cross section, not necessary in our\napproach. The possibility to observe for the first time two-parton\ncorrelations, in the next LHC runs, has been established.\n", "  We report on rubidium vapor-cell Rydberg electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) in a 0.7~T magnetic field where all involved levels are in\nthe hyperfine Paschen-Back regime, and the Rydberg state exhibits a strong\ndiamagnetic interaction with the magnetic field. Signals from both\n$^{85}\\mathrm{Rb}$ and $^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ are present in the EIT spectra. This\nfeature of isotope-mixed Rb cells allows us to measure the field strength to\nwithin a $\\pm 0.12$\\% relative uncertainty. The measured spectra are in\nexcellent agreement with the results of a Monte Carlo calculation and indicate\nunexpectedly large Rydberg-level dephasing rates. Line shifts and broadenings\ndue to small inhomogeneities of the magnetic field are included in the model.\n", "  We investigate critical $N$-component scalar field theories and the\nspontaneous breaking of scale invariance in three dimensions using functional\nrenormalisation. Global and local renormalisation group flows are solved\nanalytically in the infinite $N$ limit to establish the phase diagram including\nthe Wilson-Fisher fixed point and a line of asymptotically safe UV fixed points\ncharacterised by an exactly marginal sextic coupling. We also study the\nBardeen-Moshe-Bander phenomenon of spontaneously broken scale invariance and\nthe stability of the vacuum for general regularisation. Our findings clarify a\nlong-standing puzzle about the apparent unboundedness of the effective\npotential. Implications for other theories are indicated.\n", "  We use accurate ab initio and quantum scattering calculations to explore the\nprospects for sympathetic cooling of the heavy molecular radical\nSrOH($^2\\Sigma$) by ultracold Li atoms in a magnetic trap. A two-dimensional\npotential energy surface (PES) for the triplet electronic state of Li-SrOH is\ncalculated ab initio using the partially spin-restricted coupled cluster method\nwith single, double and perturbative triple excitations and a large\ncorrelation-consistent basis set. The highly anisotropic PES has a deep global\nminimum in the skewed Li-HOSr geometry with $D_e=4932$ cm$^{-1}$ and saddle\npoints in collinear configurations. Our quantum scattering calculations predict\nlow spin relaxation rates in fully spin-polarized Li+SrOH collisions with the\nratios of elastic to inelastic collision rates well in excess of 100 over a\nwide range of magnetic fields (1-1000 G) and collision energies\n(10$^{-5}-0.1$~K) suggesting favorable prospects for sympathetic cooling of\nSrOH molecules with spin-polarized Li atoms in a magnetic trap. We find that\nspin relaxation in Li+SrOH collisions occurs via a direct mechanism mediated by\nthe magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between the electron spins of Li and\nSrOH, and that the indirect (spin-rotation) mechanism is strongly suppressed.\nThe upper limit to the Li+SrOH reaction rate coefficient calculated for the\nsinglet PES using adiabatic capture theory is found to decrease from $4\\times\n10^{-10}$~cm$^3$/s to a limiting value of $3.5\\times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/s with\ndecreasing temperature from 0.1 K to 1 $\\mu$K.\n", "  New numerical solutions to the so-called selection problem for one and two\nsteadily translating bubbles in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell are presented. Our\napproach relies on conformal mapping which, for the two-bubble problem,\ninvolves the Schottky-Klein prime function associated with an annulus. We show\nthat a countably infinite number of solutions exist for each fixed value of\ndimensionless surface tension, with the bubble shapes becoming more exotic as\nthe solution branch number increases. Our numerical results suggest that a\nsingle solution is selected in the limit that surface tension vanishes, with\nthe scaling between the bubble velocity and surface tension being different to\nthe well-studied problems for a bubble or a finger propagating in a channel\ngeometry.\n", "  I critically examine Goodenough's explanation for the experimentally observed\nphase transition in LiVO$_2$ using microscopic calculations based on density\nfunctional and dynamical mean field theories. The high-temperature rhombohedral\nphase exhibits both magnetic and dynamical instabilities. Allowing a magnetic\nsolution for the rhombohedral structure does not open an insulating gap, and an\nexplicit treatment of the on-site Coulomb $U$ interaction is needed to\nstabilize an insulating rhombohedral phase. The non-spin-polarized phonon\ndispersions of the rhombohedral phase show two unstable phonon modes at the\nwave vector $(\\frac{1}{3},-\\frac{1}{3},0)$ that corresponds to the\nexperimentally observed trimer forming instability. A full relaxation of the\nsupercell corresponding to this instability yields a nonmagnetic state\ncontaining V$_3$ trimers. These results are consistent with Goodenough's\nsuggestion that the high-temperature phase is in the localized-electron regime\nand the transition to the low-temperature phase in the itinerant-electron\nregime is driven by V-V covalency.\n", "  This article is on collective phenomena in pedestrian dynamics during the\nassembling and dispersal phases of gatherings. To date pedestrian dynamics have\nbeen primarily studied in the natural and engineering sciences. Pedestrians are\nanalyzed and modeled as driven particles revealing self-organizing phenomena\nand complex transport characteristics. However, pedestrians in crowds also\nbehave as living beings according to stimulus-response mechanisms or act as\nhuman subjects on the basis of social norms, social identities or strategies.\nTo show where pedestrian dynamics need social psychology in addition to the\nnatural sciences we propose the application of three categories: phenomena,\nbehavior and action. They permit a clear discrimination between situations in\nwhich minimal models from the natural sciences are appropriate and those in\nwhich sociological and psychological concepts are needed.\n  To demonstrate the necessity of this framework, an experiment in which a\nlarge group of people (n=270) enters a concert hall through two different\nspatial barrier structures is analyzed. These two structures correspond to\neveryday situations such as boarding trains and access to immigration desks.\nMethods from the natural and social sciences are applied. Firstly, physical\nmeasurements show the influence of the spatial structure on the dynamics of the\nentrance procedure. Density, waiting time and speed of progress show large\nvariations. Secondly, a questionnaire study (n=60) reveals how people perceive\nand evaluate these entrance situations. Markedly different expectations, social\nnorms and strategies are associated with the two spatial structures. The\nresults from the questionnaire study do not always conform to objective\nphysical measures, indicating the limitations of models which are based on\nobjective physical measures alone and which neglect subjective perspectives.\n", "  We derive formulas for the efficiency correction of cumulants with many\nefficiency bins. The derivation of the formulas is simpler than the previously\nsuggested method, but the numerical cost is drastically reduced from the naive\nmethod. From analytical and numerical analyses in simple toy models, we show\nthat the use of the averaged efficiency in the efficiency correction can lead\nto wrong corrected values, which have larger deviation for higher order\ncumulants. These analyses show the importance of carrying out the efficiency\ncorrection without taking the average.\n", "  Among many alternative gravitational theories to General Relativity (GR),\n$f(R,T)$ gravity (where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor) has been widely studied recently. By adding a matter\ncontribution to the gravitational Lagrangian, $f(R,T)$ theories have become an\ninteresting extension to GR displaying a broad phenomenology in astrophysics\nand cosmology. In this paper, we discuss however the difficulties appearing in\nexplaining a viable and realistic cosmology within the $f(R,T)$ class of\ntheories. Our results challenge the viability of $f(R,T)$ as an alternative\nmodification of gravity.\n", "  We study analytically the one-loop contribution to the Chiral Magnetic\nEffect(CME) using lattice regularization with a Wilson fermion field. In the\ncontinuum limit, we find that the chiral magnetic current vanishes at nonzero\ntemperature but emerges at zero temperature consistent with that found by\nPauli-Villas regularization. For finite lattice size, however, the chiral\nmagnetic current is nonvanishing at nonzero temperature. But the numerical\nvaule of the coefficient of CME current is very small compared with that\nextracted from the full QCD simulation for the same lattice parameters. The\npossibility of higher order corrections from QCD dynamics is also assessed.\n", "  We studied the spectra of six $z \\sim 2.2$ quasars obtained with the\nX-shooter spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. The redshift of these\nsources and X-shooter's spectral coverage allow us to cover the rest spectral\nrange $\\sim1200 - 7000$\\AA\\ for the simultaneous detection of optical and\nultraviolet lines emitted by the Broad Line Region. Simultaneous measurements,\navoiding issues related to quasars variability, help us understanding the\nconnection between different Broad Line Region line profiles generally used as\nvirial estimators of Black Holes masses in quasars. The goal of this work is\ncomparing the emission lines from the same object to check on the reliability\nof H$\\alpha$, MgII and CIV with respect to H$\\beta$. H$\\alpha$ and MgII\nlinewidths correlate well with H$\\beta$, while CIV shows a poorer correlation,\ndue to the presence of strong blueshifts and asymmetries in the profile. We\ncompare our sample with the only other two whose spectra were taken with the\nsame instrument and for all examined lines our results are in agreement with\nthe ones obtained with X-shooter at $z \\sim 1.5 - 1.7$. We finally evaluate\nCIII] as a possible substitute of CIV in the same spectral range and find that\nits behaviour is more coherent with those of the other lines: we believe that,\nwhen a high quality spectrum such as the ones we present is available and a\nproper modelization with the FeII and FeIII emissions is performed, the use of\nthis line is more appropriate than that of CIV if not corrected for the\ncontamination by non-virialized components.\n", "  Atomic sized two-level systems (TLSs) in amorphous dielectrics are known as a\nmajor source of loss in superconducting devices. In addition, individual TLS\nare known to induce large frequency shifts due to strong coupling to the\ndevices. However, in the presence of a broad ensemble of TLSs these shifts are\nsymmetrically canceled out and not observed in a typical single-tone\nspectroscopy experiment. We introduce a two-tone spectroscopy on the normal\nmodes of a pair of coupled superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators to\nreveal this effect. Together with an appropriate saturation model this enables\nus to extract the average single-photon Rabi frequency of dominant TLSs to be\n$\\Omega_0/2\\pi \\approx 79 $ kHz. At high photon numbers we observe an enhanced\nfrequency shift due to nonlinear kinetic inductance when using the two-tone\nmethod and estimate the value of the nonlinear coefficient as $K/2\\pi \\approx\n-1\\times 10^{-4}$ Hz/photon. Furthermore, the life-time of each resonance can\nbe controlled (increased) by pumping of the other mode as demonstrated both\nexperimentally and theoretically.\n", "  We evaluate the finite temperature partition sum and correlation functions of\nthe Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Starting from a recently proposed mapping of\nthe SYK model onto Liouville quantum mechanics, we obtain our results by exact\nintegration over conformal Goldstone modes reparameterizing physical time.\nPerhaps, the least expected result of our analysis is that at time scales\nproportional to the number of particles the out of time order correlation\nfunction crosses over from a regime of exponential decay to a universal\n$t^{-6}$ power-law behavior.\n", "  Modeling and simulation is essential for predicting and verifying the\nbehavior of fabricated quantum circuits, but existing simulation methods are\neither impractically costly or require an unrealistic simplification of error\nprocesses. We present a method of simulating noisy Clifford circuits that is\nboth accurate and practical in experimentally relevant regimes. In particular,\nthe cost is weakly exponential in the size and the degree of non-Cliffordness\nof the circuit. Our approach is based on the construction of exact\nrepresentations of quantum channels as quasiprobability distributions over\nstabilizer operations, which are then sampled, simulated, and weighted to yield\nunbiased statistical estimates of circuit outputs and other observables. As a\ndemonstration of these techniques we simulate a Steane [[7,1,3]]-encoded\nlogical operation with non-Clifford errors and compute its fault tolerance\nerror threshold. We expect that the method presented here will enable studies\nof much larger and more realistic quantum circuits than was previously\npossible.\n", "  Applied pressure drives the heavy-fermion antiferromagnet CeRhIn$_{5}$\ntowards a quantum critical point that becomes hidden by a dome of\nunconventional superconductivity. Magnetic fields suppress this superconducting\ndome, unveiling the quantum phase transition of local character. Here, we show\nthat $5\\%$ magnetic substitution at the Ce site in CeRhIn$_{5}$, either by Nd\nor Gd, induces a zero-field magnetic instability inside the superconducting\nstate. This magnetic state not only should have a different ordering vector\nthan the high-field local-moment magnetic state, but it also competes with the\nlatter, suggesting that a spin-density-wave phase is stabilized in zero field\nby Nd and Gd impurities - similarly to the case of\nCe$_{0.95}$Nd$_{0.05}$CoIn$_{5}$. Supported by model calculations, we attribute\nthis spin-density wave instability to a magnetic-impurity driven condensation\nof the spin excitons that form inside the unconventional superconducting state.\n", "  The spatial distribution of elemental abundances in the disc of our Galaxy\ngives insights both on its assembly process and subsequent evolution, and on\nthe stellar nucleogenesis of the different elements. Gradients can be traced\nusing several types of objects as, for instance, (young and old) stars, open\nclusters, HII regions, planetary nebulae. We aim at tracing the radial\ndistributions of abundances of elements produced through different\nnucleosynthetic channels -the alpha-elements O, Mg, Si, Ca and Ti, and the\niron-peak elements Fe, Cr, Ni and Sc - by using the Gaia-ESO idr4 results of\nopen clusters and young field stars. From the UVES spectra of member stars, we\ndetermine the average composition of clusters with ages >0.1 Gyr. We derive\nstatistical ages and distances of field stars. We trace the abundance gradients\nusing the cluster and field populations and we compare them with a\nchemo-dynamical Galactic evolutionary model. Results. The adopted\nchemo-dynamical model, with the new generation of metallicity-dependent stellar\nyields for massive stars, is able to reproduce the observed spatial\ndistributions of abundance ratios, in particular the abundance ratios of [O/Fe]\nand [Mg/Fe] in the inner disc (5 kpc<RGC <7 kpc), with their differences, that\nwere usually poorly explained by chemical evolution models. Often, oxygen and\nmagnesium are considered as equivalent in tracing alpha-element abundances and\nin deducing, e.g., the formation time-scales of different Galactic stellar\npopulations. In addition, often [alpha/Fe] is computed combining several\nalpha-elements. Our results indicate, as expected, a complex and diverse\nnucleosynthesis of the various alpha-elements, in particular in the high\nmetallicity regimes, pointing towards a different origin of these elements and\nhighlighting the risk of considering them as a single class with common\nfeatures.\n", "  In this work it is shown that scale free tails in metabolic flux\ndistributions inferred from realistic large scale models can be simply an\nartefact due to reactions involved in thermodynamically unfeasible cycles, that\nare unbounded by physical constraints and would be able to perform work without\nexpenditure of free energy. After correcting for thermodynamics, the metabolic\nspace scales meaningfully with the physical limiting factors, acquiring in turn\na richer multimodal structure potentially leading to symmetry breaking while\noptimizing for objective functions.\n", "  A class of extensions of the Standard Model allows Lorentz and CPT\nviolations, which can be identified by the observation of sidereal modulations\nin the neutrino interaction rate. A search for such modulations was performed\nusing the T2K on-axis near detector. Two complementary methods were used in\nthis study, both of which resulted in no evidence of a signal. Limits on\nassociated Lorentz and CPT violating terms from the Standard Model Extension\nhave been derived taking into account their correlations in this model for the\nfirst time. These results imply such symmetry violations are suppressed by a\nfactor of more than $10^{20}$ at the GeV scale.\n", "  We present updated parameters for the star HD 209458 and its transiting giant\nplanet. The stellar angular diameter $\\theta$=0.2254$\\pm$0.0017 mas is obtained\nfrom the average ratio between the absolute flux observed with the Hubble Space\nTelescope and that of the best-fitting Kurucz model atmosphere. This angular\ndiameter represents an improvement in precision of more than four times\ncompared to available interferometric determinations. The stellar radius\n$R_\\star$=1.20$\\pm$0.05 R$_{\\odot}$ is ascertained by combining the angular\ndiameter with the Hipparcos trigonometric parallax, which is the main\ncontributor to its uncertainty, and therefore the radius accuracy should be\nsignificantly improved with Gaia's measurements. The radius of the exoplanet\n$R_\\text{p}$=1.41$\\pm$0.06 $R_\\text{J}$ is derived from the corresponding\ntransit depth in the light curve and our stellar radius. From the model\nfitting, we accurately determine the effective temperature,\n$T_\\text{eff}$=6071$\\pm$20 K, which is in perfect agreement with the value of\n6070$\\pm$24 K calculated from the angular diameter and the integrated spectral\nenergy distribution. We also find precise values from recent Padova Isochrones,\nsuch as $R_\\star$=1.20$\\pm$0.06 R$_{\\odot}$ and $T_\\text{eff}$=6099$\\pm$41 K.\nWe arrive at a consistent picture from these methods and compare the results\nwith those from the literature.\n", "  Future very-large-area X-ray instruments (for which the effective area is\nlarger than $>3$m$^2$) will be able to measure the frequencies of\nquasi-periodic oscillations~(QPOs) observed in the X-ray flux from accreting\ncompact objects with sub-percent precision. If correctly modeled, QPOs can\nprovide a novel way to test the strong-field regime of gravity. By using the\nrelativistic precession model and a modified version of the epicyclic resonance\nmodel, we develop a method to test general relativity against a generic class\nof theories with quadratic curvature corrections. With the instrumentation\nbeing studied for future missions such as eXTP, LOFT, or STROBE-X, a\nmeasurement of at least two QPO triplets from a stellar mass black hole can set\nstringent constraints on the coupling parameters of quadratic gravity.\n", "  In this work, we study the effect of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric complex\npotentials on the transport properties of one non-Hermitian system, which is\nformed by the coupling between a triple-quantum-dot molecule and two\nsemi-infinite leads. As a result, it is found that the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\nimaginary potentials take pronounced effects on transport properties of such a\nsystem, including changes from antiresonance to resonance, shift of\nantiresonance, and occurrence of new antiresonance, which are determined by the\ninterdot and dot-lead coupling manners. This study can be helpful in\nunderstanding the quantum transport behaviors modified by the $\\cal PT$\nsymmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems.\n", "  We present a full evaluation of the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS)\ncross section in the dipole framework in the small-x region. The result\nfeatures the $\\cos \\phi$ and $\\cos 2\\phi$ azimuthal angular correlations which\nhave been missing in previous studies based on the dipole model. In particular,\nthe $\\cos 2\\phi$ term is generated by the elliptic gluon Wigner distribution\nwhose measurement at the planned electron-ion collider (EIC) provides an\nimportant information about the gluon tomography at small-x. We also show the\nconsistency with the standard collinear factorization approach based on the\nquark and gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs).\n", "  We present a study of collective multi-photon blockade in coherently driven\natoms in a single mode cavity. Considering two atoms strongly coupled to an\noptical cavity, we show that the two-photon blockade with two-photon\nanti-bunching, and the three-photon blockade with three-photon anti-bunching\ncan be observed simultaneously. The three-photon blockade probes both dressed\nstates in the two photon and three photon spaces. The two photon and three\nphoton blockades strongly depend on the location of two atoms in the strong\ncoupling regime. The asymmetry in the atom-cavity coupling constants opens new\npathways for multiphoton blockade which is also shown to be sensitive to the\natomic decay and pumping strengths. The work presented here predicts many new\nquantum statistical features due to the collective behavior of atoms and can be\nuseful to generate non-classical photon pairs.\n", "  We consider the problem of determination of a volume of some bounded\nspace-like hypersurfaces in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes. In\nthe case when the hypersurfaces is cut or bounded by a light-like hypersurface\nthe problem may not be well defined. In order to define properly the volume we\nintroduce the volume forms related to the given foliation (observer) of the\nconsidered spacetime. In the case of the constant curvature slice the volume of\nthe hypersurface cut by the horizon (light-like surface) becomes composed of\nthe two parts, outer and inner, treated differently. We compute the\ncorresponding volumes outside and inside of the horizon of the ethernal\nSchwarzschild black hole.\n", "  We use holography to study the spinodal instability of a four-dimensional,\nstrongly-coupled gauge theory with a first-order thermal phase transition. We\nplace the theory on a cylinder in a set of homogeneous, unstable initial\nstates. The dual gravity configurations are black branes afflicted by a\nGregory-Laflamme instability. We numerically evolve Einstein's equations to\nfollow the instability until the system settles down to a stationary,\ninhomogeneous black brane. The dual gauge theory states have constant\ntemperature but non-constant energy density. We show that the time evolution of\nthe instability and the final states are accurately described by second-order\nhydrodynamics. In the static limit, the latter reduces to a single,\nsecond-order, non-linear differential equation from which the inhomogeneous\nfinal states can be derived.\n", "  We introduce a representative minimal model for phoretically interacting\nactive colloids. Combining kinetic theory, linear stability analyses, and a\ngeneral relation between self-propulsion and phoretic interactions in\nauto-diffusiophoretic and auto-thermophoretic Janus colloids collapses the\nparameter space to two dimensions: area fraction and P\\'eclet number. This\ncollapse arises when the lifetime of the self-generated phoretic fields is not\ntoo short, and leads to a universal phase diagram showing that phoretic\ninteractions {\\it generically} induce pattern formation in typical Janus\ncolloids, even at very low density. The resulting patterns include waves and\ndynamic aggregates closely resembling the living clusters found in experiments\non dilute suspension of Janus colloids.\n", "  The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of low-mass low-metallicity (dwarf)\ngalaxies are a challenging piece of the puzzle of galaxy formation in the near\nUniverse. These SEDs show some particular features in the submillimeter to\nfar-infrared wavelength range compared to normal, larger, and metal-richer\ngalaxies that cannot be explained by the current models. These can be\nsummarized as: a broadening of the IR peak, which implies a warmer dust\ncomponent; an excess of emission in the submm ($\\sim$500 $\\mu$m), that causes a\nflattening of the submm/FIR slope; and a very low intensity of PAH emission\nfeatures. With the aim of explaining these emission patterns, the SEDs of a\nsample of 27 simulated dwarf galaxies were calculated using the GRASIL-3D\nradiation transfer code. This code has the particularity that it separately\ntreats the radiative transfer through dust grains within molecular clouds and\nwithin the cirrus, the dense and diffuse components of the gas phase,\nrespectively. The simulated galaxies have stellar masses ranging from\n10$^6$-10$^9$ M$_\\odot$, and were obtained from a single simulation run within\na Local Group environment with initial conditions from the CLUES project. We\nreport a study of the IRAS, Spitzer and Herschel bands luminosities, and of the\nSFRs, dust, and gas (HI and H$_2$) mass contents. We find a satisfactory\nagreement with observational data, with GRASIL-3D naturally reproducing the\nspecific spectral features mentioned above. We conclude that the GRASIL-3D\ntwo-component dust model gives a physical interpretation of the emission of\ndwarf galaxies: molecular clouds and cirrus represent the warm and cold dust\ncomponents, respectively, needed to reproduce observational data.\n", "  A well-studied scenario in quantum parameter estimation theory arises when\nthe parameter to be estimated is imprinted on the initial state by a\nHamiltonian of the form $\\theta G$. For such \"phase shift Hamiltonians\" it has\nbeen shown that one cannot improve the channel quantum Fisher information by\nadding ancillas and letting the system interact with them. Here we investigate\nthe general case, where the Hamiltonian is not necessarily a phase shift, and\nshow that in this case in general it \\emph{is} possible to increase the quantum\nchannel information and to reach an upper bound. This can be done by adding a\nterm proportional to the derivative of the Hamiltonian, or by subtracting a\nterm to the original Hamiltonian. Both methods do not make use of any ancillas\nand show therefore that for quantum channel estimation with arbitrary\nparameter-dependent Hamiltonian, entanglement with an ancillary system is not\nnecessary to reach the best possible sensitivity. By adding an operator to the\nHamiltonian we can also modify the time scaling of the channel quantum Fisher\ninformation. We illustrate our techniques with NV-center magnetometry and the\nestimation of the direction of a magnetic field in a given plane using a single\nspin-1 as probe.\n", "  We present the development of a specialized concrete for neutron shielding at\nneutron research facilities, based on the addition of hydrogen atoms in the\nform of polyethylene and also B$_{4}$C for enhancing the neutron capture\nproperties of the concrete. We show information on the mechanical properties of\nthe concrete and the neutronics, in particular it's relevance to modern\nspallation neutron sources, such as the European Spallation Source (ESS),\ncurrently under construction in Lund, Sweden. The new concrete exhibits a 15%\nlower mass density, a compressible strength of 50% relative to a standard\nconcrete and a significant increase in performance of shielding against MeV\nneutrons and lower energies. The concrete could find application at the ESS in\nfor example common shielding components, individual beamline shielding and\ninstrument caves. Initial neutronic tests of the concrete, carried out at Lund\nUniversity, have also verified the performance in the MeV neutron energy range\nand the results are presented.\n", "  Spectral lines belonging to the short-lifetime heavy radioactive elements up\nto Es ($Z$=99) have been found in the spectra of the Przybylski's star. We\nsuggest that these unstable elements may be decay products of a \"magic\"\nmetastable nucleus belonging to the the island of stability where the nuclei\nhave a magic number of neutrons $N=184$. The laboratory-produced nuclei have a\nsignificantly smaller number of neutrons. To identify spectra of the $N=184$\nisotopes of these nuclei and their neutron-reach superheavy decay products in\nastrophysical data we calculate the isotope shift which should be added to the\nlaboratory - measured wavelenghs. The results for the isotopic shifts in the\nstrongest optical electromagnetic transitions in No, Lr, Nh, Fl,and $Z$=120\nelements are presented.\n", "  Precise measurements are the key to advances in all fields of science.\nQuantum entanglement shows higher sensitivity than achievable by classical\nmethods. Most physical quantities including position, displacement, distance,\nangle, and optical path length can be obtained by optical phase measurements.\nReducing the photon wavelength of the interferometry can further enhance the\noptical path length sensitivity and imaging resolution. By quantum frequency up\nconversion, we realized a short wavelength two photon number entangled state.\nNearly perfect Hong Ou Mandel interference is achieved after both 1547-nm\nphotons are up converted to 525 nm. Optical phase measurement of two photon\nentanglement state yields a visibility greater than the threshold to surpass\nthe standard quantum limit. These results offer new ways for high precision\nquantum metrology using short wavelength quantum entanglement number state.\n", "  The first elastic electron scattering has been successfully performed at the\nself-confining RI ion target (SCRIT) facility, the world's first electron\nscattering facility for exotic nuclei. The SCRIT technique achieved high\nluminosity (over 10$^{27}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, sufficient for determining the\nnuclear shape) with only 10$^8$ target ions. While $^{132}$Xe used in this time\nas a target is stable isotope, the charge density distribution was firstly\nextracted from the momentum transfer distributions of the scattered electrons\nby comparing the results with those calculated by a phase shift calculation.\n", "  We perform full time resolved tomographic measurements of the polarization\nstate of pairs of photons emitted during the radiative cascade of the confined\nbiexciton in a semiconductor quantum dot. The biexciton was deterministically\ninitiated using a $\\pi$-area pulse into the biexciton two-photon absorption\nresonance. Our measurements demonstrate that the polarization states of the\nemitted photon pair are maximally entangled. We show that the measured degree\nof entanglement depends solely on the temporal resolution by which the time\ndifference between the emissions of the photon pair is determined. A route for\nfabricating an on demand source of maximally polarization entangled photon\npairs is thereby provided.\n", "  Cosmic Rays escaping the Galaxy exert a force on the interstellar medium\ndirected away from the Galactic disk. If this force is larger than the\ngravitational pull due to the mass embedded in the Galaxy, then galactic winds\nmay be launched. Such outflows may have important implications for the history\nof star formation of the host galaxy, and in turn affect in a crucial way the\ntransport of cosmic rays, both due to advection with the wind and to the\nexcitation of waves by the same cosmic rays, through streaming instability. The\npossibility to launch cosmic ray induced winds and the properties of such winds\ndepend on environmental conditions, such as the density and temperature of the\nplasma at the base of the wind and the gravitational potential, especially the\none contributed by the dark matter halo. In this paper we make a critical\nassessment of the possibility to launch cosmic ray induced winds for a\nMilky-Way-like galaxy and how the properties of the wind depend upon the\nconditions at the base of the wind. Special attention is devoted to the\nimplications of different conditions for wind launching on the spectrum of\ncosmic rays observed at different locations in the disc of the galaxy. We also\ncomment on how cosmic ray induced winds compare with recent observations of\nOxygen absorption lines in quasar spectra and emission lines from blank-sky, as\nmeasured by XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS.\n", "  Apparent metastability of the electroweak vacuum poses a number of\ncosmological questions. These concern evolution of the Higgs field to the\ncurrent vacuum, and its stability during and after inflation. Higgs-inflaton\nand non-minimal Higgs-gravity interactions can make a crucial impact on these\nconsiderations potentially solving the problems. In this work, we allow for\nthese couplings to be present simultaneously and study their interplay. We find\nthat different combinations of the Higgs-inflaton and non-minimal Higgs-gravity\ncouplings induce effective Higgs mass during and after inflation. This\ncrucially affects the Higgs stability considerations during preheating. In\nparticular, a wide range of the couplings leading to stable solutions becomes\nallowed.\n", "  We consider theoretically staggered honeycomb lattices for photons which can\nbe viewed as photonic analogs of transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMD)\nmonolayers. We propose a simple realization of a photonic Quantum Valley Hall\neffect (QVHE) at the interface between two TMD analogs with opposite staggering\non each side. This results in the formation of valley-polarized propagating\nmodes whose existence relies on the difference between the valley Chern\nnumbers, which is a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. We show that the\nmagnitude of the photonic spin-orbit coupling based on the energy splitting\nbetween TE and TM photonic modes allows to control the number and propagation\ndirection of these interface modes. Finally, we consider the interface between\na staggered and a regular honeycomb lattice subject to a non-zero Zeeman field,\ntherefore showing Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE). In such a case, the\ntopologically protected one-way modes of the QAHE become valley-polarized and\nthe system behaves as a perfect valley filter.\n", "  Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate thermally induced magnetic\nswitching in synthetic ferrimagnets composed of multilayers of rare-earth and\ntransition metals. Our findings show that deterministic magnetization reversal\noccurs above a certain threshold temperature if the ratio of transition metal\natoms to rare-earth atoms is sufficiently large. Surprisingly, the total\nthickness of the multilayer system has little effect on the occurence of\nswitching. We further provide a simple argument to explain the temperature\ndependence of the reversal process.\n", "  Understanding the formation and evolution of giant planets ($\\ge$1 $M_{Jup}$)\nat wide orbital separation ($\\ge$5 AU) is one of the goals of direct imaging.\nOver the past 15 years, many surveys have placed strong constraints on the\noccurrence rate of wide-orbit giants, mostly based on non-detections, but very\nfew have tried to make a direct link with planet formation theories. In the\npresent work, we combine the results of our previously published VLT/NaCo large\nprogram with the results of 12 past imaging surveys to constitute a statistical\nsample of 199 FGK stars within 100 pc, including 3 stars with sub-stellar\ncompanions. Using Monte Carlo simulations and assuming linear flat\ndistributions for the mass and semi-major axis of planets, we estimate the\nsub-stellar companion frequency to be within 0.75-5.7% at the 68% confidence\nlevel (CL) within 20-300 AU and 0.5-75 $M_{Jup}$, which is compatible with\npreviously published results. We also compare our results with the predictions\nof state-of-the-art population synthesis models based on the gravitational\ninstability (GI) formation scenario by Forgan & Rice (2013), with and without\nscattering. We estimate that in both the scattered and non-scattered\npopulations, we would be able to detect more than 30% of companions in the 1-75\n$M_{Jup}$ range (95% CL). With the 3 sub-stellar detections in our sample, we\nestimate the fraction of stars that host a planetary system formed by GI to be\nwithin 1.0-8.6% (95% CL). We also conclude that even though GI is not common,\nit predicts a mass distribution of wide-orbit massive companions that is much\ncloser to what is observed than what the core accretion scenario predicts.\nFinally, we associate the present paper with the release of the Direct Imaging\nVirtual Archive (DIVA, http://cesam.lam.fr/diva/), a public database that aims\nat gathering the results of past, present, and future direct imaging surveys.\n", "  We define a new construct in quantum field theory - the causal density matrix\n- obtained from the singularity structure of correlators of local operators.\nThis object provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum field\ntheory state to have a holographic semiclassical dual causal geometry. By\nexploiting the causal density matrix, we find that these dual causal geometries\nquite generally (even away from AdS/CFT) exhibit features of quantum error\ncorrection. Within AdS/CFT, we argue that the \"reduced\" causal density matrix\nis the natural dual to the causal wedge. Our formalism is very well-suited to\ngeneralizations of holography beyond AdS/CFT or even gravity/QFT.\n", "  The connection between the bulge mass or bulge luminosity in disk galaxies\nand the number, spatial and phase space distribution of associated dwarf\ngalaxies is a discriminator between cosmological simulations related to galaxy\nformation in cold dark matter and generalized gravity models. Here, a nearby\nsample of isolated Milky Way class edge-on galaxies is introduced, to\nfacilitate observational campaigns to detect the associated families of dwarf\ngalaxies at low surface brightness. Three galaxy pairs with at least one of the\ntargets being edge-on are also introduced. About 60% of the catalogued isolated\ngalaxies contain bulges of different size, while the remaining objects appear\nto be bulge-less. Deep images of NGC 3669 (small bulge, with NGC 3625 at the\nedge of the image) and NGC 7814 (prominent bulge), obtained with a 0.4-m\naperture, are also presented, resulting in the discovery of two new dwarf\ngalaxy candidates, NGC3669-DGSAT-3 and NGC7814-DGSAT-7. Eleven additional low\nsurface brightness galaxies are identified, previously notified with low\nquality measurement flags in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Integrated\nmagnitudes, surface brightnesses, effective radii, Sersic indices, axis ratios,\nand projected distances to their putative major hosts are displayed. At least\none of the galaxies, NGC3625-DGSAT-4, belongs with a surface brightness of\napproximately 26 mag per arcsec^2 and effective radius >1.5 kpc to the class of\nultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). NGC3669-DGSAT-3, the galaxy with lowest surface\nbrightness in our sample, may also be an UDG.\n", "  In this paper we address the two-body problem in massless Scalar-Tensor (ST)\ntheories within an Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework. We focus on the first\nbuilding block of the EOB approach, that is, mapping the conservative part of\nthe two-body dynamics onto the geodesic motion of a test particle in an\neffective external metric. To this end, we first deduce the second\npost-Keplerian (2PK) Hamiltonian of the two-body problem from the known 2PK\nLagrangian. We then build, by means of a canonical transformation a\nST-deformation of the general relativistic EOB Hamiltonian which allows to\nincorporate the Scalar-Tensor (2PK) corrections to the currently best available\nGeneral Relativity EOB results. This EOB-ST Hamiltonian defines a resummation\nof the dynamics that may provide information on the strong-field regime, in\nparticular, the ISCO location and associated orbital frequency and can be\ncompared to other, e.g. tidal, corrections.\n", "  We consider quantum cellular automata on a body-centred cubic lattice and\nprovide a simple derivation of the only two homogenous, local, isotropic, and\nunitary two-dimensional automata [G. M. D'Ariano and P. Perinotti, Physical\nReview A 90, 062106 (2014)]. Our derivation relies on the notion of Gram matrix\nand emphasises the link between the transition matrices that characterise the\nautomata and the body-centred cubic lattice: The transition matrices\nessentially are the matrix representation of the vertices of the lattice's\nprimitive cell. As expected, the dynamics of these two automata reduce to the\nWeyl equation in the limit of small wave vectors and continuous time. We also\nbriefly examine the four-dimensional case where we find two one-parameter\nfamilies of automata that reduce to the Dirac equation in a suitable limit.\n", "  Since the celebrated discovery of graphene, the family of two-dimensional\n(2D) materials has grown to encompass a broad range of electronic properties.\nRecent additions include spin-valley coupled semiconductors, Ising\nsuperconductors that can be tuned into a quantum metal, possible Mott\ninsulators with tunable charge-density waves, and topological semi-metals with\nedge transport. Despite this progress, there is still no 2D crystal with\nintrinsic magnetism, which would be useful for many technologies such as\nsensing, information, and data storage. Theoretically, magnetic order is\nprohibited in the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model at finite temperatures by the\nMermin-Wagner theorem. However, magnetic anisotropy removes this restriction\nand enables, for instance, the occurrence of 2D Ising ferromagnetism. Here, we\nuse magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy to demonstrate that monolayer\nchromium triiodide (CrI3) is an Ising ferromagnet with out-of-plane spin\norientation. Its Curie temperature of 45 K is only slightly lower than the 61 K\nof the bulk crystal, consistent with a weak interlayer coupling. Moreover, our\nstudies suggest a layer-dependent magnetic phase transition, showcasing the\nhallmark thickness-dependent physical properties typical of van der Waals\ncrystals. Remarkably, bilayer CrI3 displays suppressed magnetization with a\nmetamagnetic effect, while in trilayer the interlayer ferromagnetism observed\nin the bulk crystal is restored. Our work creates opportunities for studying\nmagnetism by harnessing the unique features of atomically-thin materials, such\nas electrical control for realizing magnetoelectronics, and van der Waals\nengineering for novel interface phenomena.\n", "  Discordance in the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model can be seen by comparing\nparameters constrained by CMB measurements to those inferred by probes of large\nscale structure. Recent improvements in observations, including final data\nreleases from both Planck and SDSS-III BOSS, as well as improved astrophysical\nuncertainty analysis of CFHTLenS, allows for an update in the quantification of\nany tension between large and small scales. This paper is intended, primarily,\nas a discussion on the quantifications of discordance when comparing the\nparameter constraints of a model when given two different data sets. We\nconsider KL-divergence, comparison of Bayesian evidences and other statistics\nwhich are sensitive to the mean, variance and shape of the distributions.\nHowever, as a by-product, we present an update to the similar analysis in\n(Battye, Charnock and Moss; 2015) where we find that, considering new data and\ntreatment of priors, the constraints from the CMB and from a combination of LSS\nprobes are in greater agreement and any tension only persists to a minor\ndegree. In particular, we find the parameter constraints from the combination\nof LSS probes which are most discrepant with the Planck2015+Pol+BAO parameter\ndistributions can be quantified at a 2.55$\\sigma$ tension using the method\nintroduced in (Battye, Charnock and Moss; 2015). If instead we use the\ndistributions constrained by the combination of LSS probes which are in\ngreatest agreement with those from Planck2015+Pol+BAO this tension is only\n0.76$\\sigma$.\n", "  CoRoT-9b is one of the rare long-period (P=95.3 days) transiting giant\nplanets with a measured mass known to date. We present a new analysis of the\nCoRoT-9 system based on five years of radial-velocity (RV) monitoring with\nHARPS and three new space-based transits observed with CoRoT and Spitzer.\nCombining our new data with already published measurements we redetermine the\nCoRoT-9 system parameters and find good agreement with the published values. We\nuncover a higher significance for the small but non-zero eccentricity of\nCoRoT-9b ($e=0.133^{+0.042}_{-0.037}$) and find no evidence for additional\nplanets in the system. We use simulations of planet-planet scattering to show\nthat the eccentricity of CoRoT-9b may have been generated by an instability in\nwhich a $\\sim 50~M_\\oplus$ planet was ejected from the system. This scattering\nwould not have produced a spin-orbit misalignment, so we predict that CoRoT-9b\norbit should lie within a few degrees of the initial plane of the\nprotoplanetary disk. As a consequence, any significant stellar obliquity would\nindicate that the disk was primordially tilted.\n", "  Milgromian dynamics (MD or MOND) uniquely predicts motion in a galaxy from\nthe distribution of its stars and gas in a remarkable agreement with\nobservations so far. In the solar system, MD predicts the existence of some\npossibly non-negligible dynamical effects, which can be used to constrain the\nfreedom in MD theories. Known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) have\ntheir argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node, and inclination\ndistributed in highly non-uniform fashion; ETNOs are bodies with perihelion\ndistances greater than the orbit of Neptune and with semimajor axes greater\nthan 150 au and less than $\\sim1500$ au. It is as if these bodies have been\nsystematically perturbed by some external force. We investigated a hypothesis\nthat the puzzling orbital characteristics of ETNOs are a consequence of MD. We\nset up a dynamical model of the solar system incorporating the external field\neffect (EFE), which is anticipated to be the dominant effect of MD in the ETNOs\nregion. We used constraints available on the strength of EFE coming from radio\ntracking of the Cassini spacecraft. We performed several numerical experiments,\nconcentrating on the long-term orbital evolution of primordial (randomised)\nETNOs in MD. The EFE could produce distinct non-uniform distributions of the\norbital elements of ETNOs that are related to the orientation of an orbit in\nspace. If we demand that EFE is solely responsible for the detachment of Sedna\nand 2012 VP$_{113}$, then these distributions are at odds with the currently\nobserved statistics on ETNOs unless the EFE quadrupole strength parameter\n$Q_{2}$ has values that are unlikely (with probability < 1$\\%$) in light of the\nCassini data.\n", "  Semiclassical sum rules, such as the Gutzwiller trace formula, depend on the\nproperties of periodic, closed, or homoclinic (heteroclinic) orbits. The\ninterferences embedded in such orbit sums are governed by classical action\nfunctions and Maslov indices. For chaotic systems, the relative actions of such\norbits can be expressed in terms of phase space areas bounded by segments of\nstable and unstable manifolds, and Moser invariant curves. This also generates\ndirect relations between periodic orbits and homoclinic (heteroclinic) orbit\nactions. Simpler, explicit approximate expressions following from the exact\nrelations are given with error estimates. They arise from asymptotic scaling of\ncertain bounded phase space areas. The actions of infinite subsets of periodic\norbits are determined by their periods and the locations of the limiting\nhomoclinic points on which they accumulate.\n", "  We investigate the energetics of the atom exchange reaction in the\nSrF+alkali-metal atom and CaF+alkali-metal atom systems. Such reactions are\npossible only for collisions of SrF and CaF with the lithium atoms, while they\nare energetically forbidden for other alkali-metal atoms. Specifically, we\nfocus on SrF interacting with Li, Rb, and Sr atoms and use ab initio methods to\ndemonstrate that the SrF+Li and SrF+Sr reactions are barrierless. We present\npotential energy surfaces for the interaction of the SrF molecule with the Li,\nRb, and Sr atoms in their energetically lowest-lying electronic spin states.\nThe obtained potential energy surfaces are deep and exhibit profound\ninteraction anisotropies. We predict that the collisions of SrF molecules in\nthe rotational or Zeeman excited states most likely have a strong inelastic\ncharacter. We discuss the prospects for the sympathetic cooling of SrF and CaF\nmolecules using ultracold alkali-metal atoms.\n", "  Aims: We resolve the small-scale structure around the high-mass hot core\nregion G351.77-0.54 to investigate its disk and fragmentation properties.\n  Methods: Using ALMA at 690GHz with baselines exceeding 1.5km, we study the\ndense gas, dust and outflow emission at an unprecedented spatial resolution of\n0.06\" (130AU@2.2kpc).\n  Results: Within the inner few 1000AU, G351.77 fragments into at least four\ncores (brightness temperatures between 58 and 197K). The central structure\naround the main submm source #1 with a diameter of ~0.5\" does not show\nadditional fragmentation. While the CO(6-5) line wing emission shows an outflow\nlobe in the north-western direction emanating from source #1, the dense gas\ntracer CH3CN shows a velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow that is\nindicative of rotational motions. Absorption profile measurements against the\nsubmm source #2 indicate infall rates on the order of 10^{-4} to\n10^{-3}M_sun/yr which can be considered as an upper limit of the mean accretion\nrates. The position-velocity diagrams are consistent with a central rotating\ndisk-like structure embedded in an infalling envelope, but they may also be\ninfluenced by the outflow. Using the CH_3CN(37_k-36_k) k-ladder with excitation\ntemperatures up to 1300K, we derive a gas temperature map of source #1\nexhibiting temperatures often in excess of 1000K. Brightness temperatures of\nthe submm continuum never exceed 200K. This discrepancy between gas\ntemperatures and submm dust brightness temperatures (in the optically thick\nlimit) indicates that the dust may trace the disk mid-plane whereas the gas\ncould be tracing a hotter gaseous disk surface layer. In addition, we conduct a\npixel-by-pixel Toomre gravitational stability analysis of the central rotating\nstructure. The derived high Q values throughout the structure confirm that this\ncentral region appears stable against gravitational instability.\n", "  The study of topological effects in physics is a hot area, and only recently\nresearchers were able to address the important issues of topological properties\nof interacting quantum systems. But it is still a great challenge to describe\nmulti-particle and interaction effects. Here, we introduce multi-particle\nWannier states for interacting systems with co-translational symmetry. We\nreveal how the shift of multi-particle Wannier state relates to the\nmulti-particle Chern number, and study the two-boson Thouless pumping in an\ninteracting Rice-Mele model. In addition to the bound-state Thouless pumping in\nwhich two bosons move unidirectionally as a whole, we find topologically\nresonant tunneling in which two bosons move unidirectionally, one by the other,\nprovided the neighboring-well potential bias matches the interaction energy.\nOur work creates a new paradigm for multi-particle topological effects and lays\na cornerstone for detecting interacting topological states.\n", "  We study the collider phenomenology of the extended Higgs sector of the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). The region of NMSSM\nparameter space favored by a 125\\,GeV SM-like Higgs and naturalness generically\nfeatures a light Higgs and neutralino spectrum as well as a large\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ coupling between the Higgs doublets and the NMSSM singlet\nfields. In such regimes, the heavier Higgs bosons can decay dominantly into\nlighter Higgs bosons and neutralinos. We study the prospects of observing such\ndecays at the 13\\,TeV LHC, focusing on mono-Higgs signatures as probes of such\nregions of parameter space. We present results in a model-independent framework\nas well as in the NMSSM. In the NMSSM, we find that the mono-Higgs channel can\nprobe TeV scale Higgs bosons and has sensitivity even in the low tan$\\beta$,\nlarge $m_A$ regime that is difficult to probe in the MSSM. Unlike for many\nconventional Higgs searches, the reach of the mono-Higgs channel will improve\nsignificantly with the increased luminosity expected to be collected at the LHC\nin the ongoing and upcoming runs.\n", "  This paper discusses the effects of the mass and the angular momentum of\nmassive vector and scalar particles on the Hawking temperature manifested under\nthe effects of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). In particular, we\ncalculate the Hawking temperature of a black hole in a warped DGP gravity model\nin the framework of the quantum tunneling method. We use the modified Proca and\nKlein-Gordon equations previously determined from the GUP Lagrangian in the\nspacetime background of a warped Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) metric, with the\nhelp of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and semiclassical (WKB) approximation methods. We\nfind that as a special case of a warped DGP black hole solution, the Hawking\ntemperature of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole can be determined.\nFurthermore, the Hawking temperature is influenced by the mass and the angular\nmomentum of vector and scalar particles and depends on which of those types of\nparticles is being emitted by the black hole. We conclude that the nonthermal\nnature of the Hawking spectrum leads to Planck-scale nonthermal correlations,\nshedding light on the information paradox in black hole evaporation.\n", "  We consider the situation when a femtosecond laser pulse creates a hot\nelectron state in half-metallic ferromagnet (e. g. ferromagnetic semiconductor)\non a picosecond timescale but do not act directly on localized spin system. We\nshow that the energy and magnetic moment transfer from hot itinerant electrons\nto localized spins is facilitated by the so-called non-quasiparticle states,\nwhich are the scattering states of a magnon and spin-majority electron. The\nmagnon distribution is described by a quantum kinetic equation that we derive\nusing the Keldysh diagram technique. In a typical ferromagnetic semiconductor\nsuch as EuO magnons remain essentially in non-equilibrium on a scale of the\norder of microsecond after the laser pulse.\n", "  We present the discovery and follow-up observations of the second known\nvariable warm DQ white dwarf OW J175358.85-310728.9 (OW J1753-3107). OW\nJ1753-3107 is the brightest of any of the currently known warm or hot DQ and\nwas discovered in the OmegaWhite Survey as exhibiting optical variations on a\nperiod of 35.5452 (2) mins, with no evidence for other periods in its light\ncurves. This period has remained constant over the last two years and a\nsingle-period sinusoidal model provides a good fit for all follow-up light\ncurves. The spectrum consists of a very blue continuum with strong absorption\nlines of neutral and ionised carbon, a broad He I 4471 A line, and possibly\nweaker hydrogen lines. The C I lines are Zeeman split, and indicate the\npresence of a strong magnetic field. Using spectral Paschen-Back model\ndescriptions, we determine that OW J1753-3107 exhibits the following physical\nparameters: T_eff = 15430 K, log(g) = 9.0, log(N(C)/N(He)) = -1.2, and the mean\nmagnetic field strength is B_z =2.1 MG. This relatively low temperature and\ncarbon abundance (compared to the expected properties of hot DQs) is similar to\nthat seen in the other warm DQ SDSS J1036+6522. Although OW J1753-3107 appears\nto be a twin of SDSS J1036+6522, it exhibits a modulation on a period slightly\nlonger than the dominant period in SDSS J1036+6522 and has a higher carbon\nabundance. The source of variations is uncertain, but they are believed to\noriginate from the rotation of the magnetic white dwarf.\n", "  The metric outside a compact body deformed by a quadrupolar tidal field is\nuniversal up to its Love numbers, constants which encode the tidal response's\ndependence on the body's internal structure. For a non-rotating body, the\ndeformed external geometry is characterized by the familiar gravitational Love\nnumbers $K_2^{\\text{el}}$ and $K_2^{\\text{mag}}$. For a slowly rotating body,\nthese must be supplemented by rotational-tidal Love numbers, which measure the\nresponse to couplings between the body's spin and the external tidal field. By\nintegrating the interior field equations, I find that the response of a\nbarotropic perfect fluid to spin-coupled tidal perturbations is described by\ntwo rotational-tidal Love numbers, which I calculate explicitly for polytropes.\nTwo other rotational-tidal Love numbers identified in prior work are found to\nhave a fixed, universal value for all barotropes. Equipped with the complete\ninterior solution, I calculate the amplitude of the time-varying internal\ncurrents induced by the gravitomagnetic part of the tidal field. For a typical\nneutron star in an equal-mass binary system, the size of the equatorial\nvelocity perturbation is on the order of kilometers per second.\n", "  A numerical study of the dynamic of the nonselfgravitating, unmagnetized,\nnonaxisymmetric, and rotating the torus around the non-rotating black hole is\npresented. We investigate the instability of the rotating torus subject to\nperturbations presented by increasing or decreasing the angular velocity of the\nstable torus. We have done, for the first time, an extensive analysis of the\ntorus dynamic response to the perturbation of the angular velocity of the\nstable torus. We show how the high, moderate, and low values of the\nperturbations affect the torus dynamic and help us to understand the properties\nof the instability and Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO). Our numerical\nsimulations indicate the presence of Papaloizou-Pringle instability (PPI) with\nglobal m=1 mode and QPOs for the moderate and lower values of the perturbations\non the angular velocity of the stable torus. Furthermore, with the lower values\nof the perturbations, the torus can lead to a wiggling initially and then PPI\nis produced in it. Finally, the matter of the torus would be dissipated due to\nthe presence of a strong torque.\n", "  In underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$, there is evidence of a small Fermi\nsurface pocket subject to substantial mass enhancement in the doping regime $\n0.12<p<0.16$. This mass enhancement may vary substantially over the Fermi\nsurface, due to \"hot spot\" or other relevant physics. We therefore examine the\nmagnetotransport of an electron-like Fermi pocket with large effective mass\nanisotropy. Within the relaxation time approximation, we show that even for a\npocket with a fixed shape, the magnitude and sign of the Hall effect may change\nas the mass anisotropy changes (except at very large, likely inaccessible\nmagnetic fields). We discuss implications for recent Hall measurements in near\noptimally doped cuprates in high fields. In addition we identify a novel\nintermediate asymptotic regime of magnetic field, characterized by B-linear\nmagnetoresistance. Similar phenomena should occur in a variety of other\nexperimental systems with anisotropic mass enhancement\n", "  We show using molecular dynamics simulations that simple diatomic molecules\nin the glassy state exhibit only limited participation in the Johari-Goldstein\n(JG) relaxation process. That is, with sufficient cooling local reorientations\nare essentially frozen for some molecules, while others continue to change\ntheir orientation significantly. Thus, the \"islands of mobility\" concept is\nvalid for these molecular glass-formers; only near the glass transition\ntemperature does every molecule undergo the JG process. In contrast, for a\nlinear polymer this dichotomy in the distribution of JG relaxation strengths is\nabsent - if any segments are changing their local orientation, all segments\nare.\n", "  We study two identical FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators which are coupled with one\nor two different time delays. If only a single delay coupling is used, the\nlength of the delay determines whether the synchronization manifold is\ntransversally stable or unstable, exhibiting mixed mode or chaotic oscillations\nin which the small amplitude oscillations are always in-phase but the large\namplitude oscillations are in-phase or out-of-phase respectively. For two\ndelays we find an intricate dynamics which comprises an irregular alteration of\nsmall amplitude oscillations, in-phase and out-of-phase large amplitude\noscillations, also called events. This transient chaotic dynamics is sandwiched\nbetween a bubbling transition and a blowout bifurcation.\n", "  Spin drag measurements were performed in a two-dimensional electron system\nset close to the crossed spin helix regime and coupled by strong intersubband\nscattering. In a sample with uncommon combination of long spin lifetime and\nhigh charge mobility, the drift transport allows us to determine the spin-orbit\nfield and the spin mobility anisotropies. We used a random walk model to\ndescribe the system dynamics and found excellent agreement for the Rashba and\nDresselhaus couplings. The proposed two-subband system displays a large tuning\nlever arm for the Rashba constant with gate voltage, which provides a new path\ntowards a spin transistor. Furthermore, the data shows large spin mobility\ncontrolled by the spin-orbit constants setting the field along the direction\nperpendicular to the drift velocity. This work directly reveals the resistance\nexperienced in the transport of a spin-polarized packet as a function of the\nstrength of anisotropic spin-orbit fields.\n", "  We study the morphology, luminosity and mass of the superclusters from the\nBOSS Great Wall (BGW), a recently discovered very rich supercluster complex at\nthe redshift $z = 0.47$. We have employed the Minkowski functionals to quantify\nsupercluster morphology. We calculate supercluster luminosities and masses\nusing two methods. Firstly, we used data about the luminosities and stellar\nmasses of high stellar mass galaxies with $\\log(M_*/h^{-1}M_\\odot) \\geq 11.3$.\nSecondly, we applied a scaling relation that combines morphological and\nphysical parameters of superclusters to obtain supercluster luminosities, and\nobtained supercluster masses using the mass-to-light ratios found for local\nrich superclusters. We find that the BGW superclusters are very elongated\nsystems, with shape parameter values of less than $0.2$. This value is lower\nthan that found for the most elongated local superclusters. The values of the\nfourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for the richer BGW superclusters ($V_3 = 7$\nand $10$) show that they have a complicated and rich inner structure. We\nidentify two Planck SZ clusters in the BGW superclusters, one in the richest\nBGW supercluster, and another in one of the poor BGW superclusters. The\nluminosities of the BGW superclusters are in the range of $1 -\n8\\times~10^{13}h^{-2}L_\\odot$, and masses in the range of $0.4 -\n2.1\\times~10^{16}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. Supercluster luminosities and masses obtained\nwith two methods agree well. We conclude that the BGW is a complex of massive,\nluminous and large superclusters with very elongated shape. The search and\ndetailed study, including the morphology analysis of the richest superclusters\nand their complexes from observations and simulations can help us to understand\nformation and evolution of the cosmic web.\n", "  The recent measurement by ATLAS of light-by-light scattering in LHC Pb-Pb\ncollisions is the first direct evidence for this basic process. We find that it\nrequires the mass scale of a nonlinear Born-Infeld extension of QED to be\n$\\gtrsim 100$~GeV, a much stronger constraint than those derived previously. In\nthe case of a Born-Infeld extension of the Standard Model in which the\nU(1)$_{\\rm Y}$ hypercharge gauge symmetry is realized nonlinearly, the limit on\nthe corresponding mass scale is $\\gtrsim 90$~GeV, which in turn imposes a lower\nlimit of $\\gtrsim 11$~TeV on the magnetic monopole mass in such a U(1)$_{\\rm\nY}$ Born-Infeld theory.\n", "  The magnetic interaction between rare-earth and Fe ions in hexagonal\nrare-earth ferrites (h-REFeO3), may amplify the weak ferromagnetic moment on\nFe, making these materials more appealing as multiferroics. To elucidate the\ninteraction strength between the rare-earth and Fe ions as well as the magnetic\nmoment of the rare-earth ions, element specific magnetic characterization is\nneeded. Using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we have studied the\nferrimagnetism in h-YbFeO3 by measuring the magnetization of Fe and Yb\nseparately. The results directly show anti-alignment of magnetization of Yb and\nFe ions in h-YbFeO3 at low temperature, with an exchange field on Yb of about\n17 kOe. The magnetic moment of Yb is about 1.6 \\muB at low-temperature,\nsignificantly reduced compared with the 4.5 \\muB moment of a free Yb3+. In\naddition, the saturation magnetization of Fe in h-YbFeO3 has a sizable\nenhancement compared with that in h-LuFeO3. These findings directly demonstrate\nthat ferrimagnetic order exists in h-YbFeO3; they also account for the\nenhancement of magnetization and the reduction of coercivity in h-YbFeO3\ncompared with those in h-LuFeO3 at low temperature, suggesting an important\nrole for the rare-earth ions in tuning the multiferroic properties of h-REFeO3.\n", "  (Abridged) Aims: We aim to use the progressive heating of the gas caused by\nthe feedback of high-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) to prove the statistical\nvalidity of the most common schemes used to define an evolutionary sequence for\nhigh-mass clumps, and characterise the sensitivity of different tracers to this\nprocess. Methods: From the spectroscopic follow-ups of the ATLASGAL TOP100\nsample, we selected several multiplets of CH3CN, CH3CCH, and CH3OH emission\nlines to derive and compare the physical properties of the gas in the clumps\nalong the evolutionary sequence. Our findings are compared with results\nobtained from CO isotopologues, dust, and NH3 from previous studies on the same\nsample. Results: The chemical properties of each species have a major role on\nthe measured physical properties. Low temperatures are traced by NH3, CH3OH,\nand CO (in the early phases), the warm and dense envelope can be probed with\nCH3CN, CH3CCH, and, in evolved sources via CO isotopologues. CH3OH and CH3CN\nare also abundant in the hot cores, and their high-excitation transitions may\nbe good tools to study the kinematics in the hot gas surrounding the YSOs that\nthese clumps are hosting. All tracers show, to different degrees, progressive\nwarming with evolution. The relation between gas temperature and L/M is\nreproduced by a toy model of a spherical, internally heated clump. Conclusions:\nThe evolutionary sequence defined for the clumps is statistically valid and we\ncould identify the processes dominating in different intervals of L/M. For\nL/M<2Lsun/Msun a large quantity of gas is still being accumulated and\ncompressed at the bottom of the potential well. Between\n2Lsun/Msun<L/M<40Lsun/Msun the YSOs gain mass and increase in L; the first hot\ncores appear around L/M=10Lsun/Msun. Finally, for L/M>40Lsun/Msun HII regions\nbecome common, showing that dissipation of the parental clump dominates.\n", "  The self-similar energy spectrum of a particle in a periodic potential under\na magnetic field, known as the Hofstadter butterfly, is determined by the\nlattice geometry as well as the external field. Recent realizations of\nartificial gauge fields and adjustable optical lattices in cold atom\nexperiments necessitate the consideration of these self-similar spectra for the\nmost general two-dimensional lattice. In a previous work, we investigated the\nevolution of the spectrum for an experimentally realized lattice which was\ntuned by changing the unit cell structure but keeping the square Bravais\nlattice fixed. We now consider all possible Bravais lattices in two dimensions\nand investigate the structure of the Hofstadter butterfly as the lattice is\ndeformed between lattices with different point symmetry groups. We model the\noptical lattice by a sinusoidal real space potential and obtain the tight\nbinding model for any lattice geometry by calculating the Wannier functions. We\nintroduce the magnetic field via Peierls substitution and numerically calculate\nthe energy spectrum. The transition between the two most symmetric lattices,\ni.e. the triangular and the square lattice displays the importance of bipartite\nsymmetry featuring deformation as well as closing of some of the major energy\ngaps. The transition from the square to rectangular and from the triangular to\ncentered rectangular lattices are analyzed in terms of coupling of\none-dimensional chains. We calculate the Chern numbers of the major gaps and\nChern number transfer between bands during the transitions. We use gap Chern\nnumbers to identify distinct topological regions in the space of Bravais\nlattices.\n", "  We have measured a precise optical transmission spectrum for WASP-52b, a\nhighly inflated hot Jupiter with an equilibrium temperature of 1300 K. Two\ntransits of the planet were observed spectroscopically at low resolution with\nthe auxiliary-port camera (ACAM) on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT),\ncovering a wide range of 4000-8750 \\AA. We use a Gaussian process approach to\nmodel the correlated noise in the multi-wavelength light curves, resulting in a\nhigh precision relative transmission spectrum with errors on the order of a\npressure scale height. We attempted to fit a variety of different\nrepresentative model atmospheres to the transmission spectrum, but did not find\na satisfactory match to the entire spectral range. For the majority of the\ncovered wavelength range (4000-7750 \\AA) the spectrum is flat, and can be\nexplained by an optically thick and grey cloud layer at 0.1 mbar, but this is\ninconsistent with a slightly deeper transit at wavelengths $> 7750$ \\AA. We\nwere not able to find an obvious systematic source for this feature, so this\nopacity may be the result of an additional unknown absorber.\n", "  Understanding the nature of two-level tunneling defects is important for\nminimizing their disruptive effects in various nano-devices. By exploiting the\nresonant coupling of these defects to a superconducting qubit, one can probe\nand coherently manipulate them individually. In this work we utilize a phase\nqubit to induce Rabi oscillations of single tunneling defects and measure their\ndephasing rates as a function of the defect's asymmetry energy, which is tuned\nby an applied strain. The dephasing rates scale quadratically with the external\nstrain and are inversely proportional to the Rabi frequency. These results are\nanalyzed and explained within a model of interacting standard defects, in which\npure dephasing of coherent high-frequency (GHz) defects is caused by\ninteraction with incoherent low-frequency thermally excited defects.\n", "  We investigate the temperature dependent microwave absorption spectrum of an\nyttrium iron garnet sphere as a function of temperature (5 K to 300 K) and\nfrequency (3 GHz to 43.5 GHz). At temperatures above 100 K, the magnetic\nresonance linewidth increases linearly with temperature and shows a\nGilbert-like linear frequency dependence. At lower temperatures, the\ntemperature dependence of the resonance linewidth at constant external magnetic\nfields exhibits a characteristic peak which coincides with a non-Gilbert-like\nfrequency dependence. The complete temperature and frequency evolution of the\nlinewidth can be modeled by the phenomenology of slowly relaxing rare-earth\nimpurities and either the Kasuya-LeCraw mechanism or the scattering with\noptical magnons. Furthermore, we extract the temperature dependence of the\nsaturation magnetization, the magnetic anisotropy and the g-factor.\n", "  The spin noise in singly charged self-assembled quantum dots is studied\ntheoretically and experimentally under the influence of a perturbation,\nprovided by additional photoexcited charge carriers. The theoretical\ndescription takes into account generation and relaxation of charge carriers in\nthe quantum dot system. The spin noise is measured under application of above\nbarrier excitation for which the data are well reproduced by the developed\nmodel. Our analysis demonstrates a strong difference of the recharging dynamics\nfor holes and electrons in quantum dots.\n", "  An experimental study was carried out to investigate the existence of a\ncritical layer thickness in nanolayer coextrusion, under which no continuous\nlayer is observed. Polymer films containing thousands of layers of alternating\npolymers with individual layer thicknesses below 100 nm have been prepared by\ncoextrusion through a series of layer multiplying elements. Different films\ncomposed of alternating layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and\npolystyrene (PS) were fabricated with the aim to reach individual layer\nthicknesses as small as possible, varying the number of layers, the mass\ncomposition of both components and the final total thickness of the film. Films\nwere characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and a statistical analysis\nwas used to determine the distribution in layer thicknesses and the continuity\nof layers. For the PS/PMMA nanolayered systems, results point out the existence\nof a critical layer thickness around 10 nm, below which the layers break up.\nThis critical layer thickness is reached regardless of the processing route,\nsuggesting it might be dependent only on material characteristics but not on\nprocess parameters. We propose this breakup phenomenon is due to small\ninterfacial perturbations that are amplified by (van der Waals) disjoining\nforces.\n", "  In a model of the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework of\ngeneralized Proca theories, there exists a de Sitter attractor preceded by the\ndark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm DE}=-1-s$, where $s$ is a positive\nconstant. We run the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo code to confront the model with\nthe observational data of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), baryon acoustic\noscillations, supernovae type Ia, and local measurements of the Hubble\nexpansion rate for the background cosmological solutions and obtain the bound\n$s=0.254^{{}+ 0.118}_{{}-0.097}$ at 95% confidence level (CL). Existence of the\nadditional parameter $s$ to those in the $\\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter\n($\\Lambda$CDM) model allows to reduce tensions of the Hubble constant $H_0$\nbetween the CMB and the low-redshift measurements. Including the cosmic growth\ndata of redshift-space distortions in the galaxy power spectrum and taking into\naccount no-ghost and stability conditions of cosmological perturbations, we\nfind that the bound on $s$ is shifted to $s=0.16^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ (95 % CL) and\nhence the model with $s>0$ is still favored over the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Apart\nfrom the quantities $s, H_0$ and the today's matter density parameter\n$\\Omega_{m0}$, the constraints on other model parameters associated with\nperturbations are less stringent, reflecting the fact that there are different\nsets of parameters that give rise to a similar cosmic expansion and growth\nhistory.\n", "  Using high-resolution observations from the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST)\noperating at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO), we report direct evidence\nof merging/reconnection of cool H$\\alpha$ loops in the chromosphere during two\nhomologous flares (B- and C-class) caused by a shear motion at the footpoint of\ntwo loops. The reconnection between these loops caused the formation of an\nunstable flux rope which showed counterclockwise rotation. The flux rope could\nnot reach the height of torus instability and failed to form a coronal mass\nejection. The HMI magnetograms revealed rotation of the negative/positive\n(N1/P2) polarity sunspots in the opposite directions, which increased the right\nand left-handed twist in the magnetic structures rooted at N1/P2. Rapid\nphotospheric flux cancellation (duration$\\sim$20-30 min,\nrate$\\approx$3.44$\\times$10$^{20}$ Mx h$^{-1}$) was observed during and even\nafter the first B6.0 flare and continued until the end of the second C2.3\nflare. The RHESSI X-ray sources were located at the site of the loop's\ncoalescence. To the best of our knowledge, such a clear interaction of\nchromospheric loops along with rapid flux cancellation has not been reported\nbefore. These high-resolution observations suggest the formation of a small\nflux rope by a series of magnetic reconnection within chromospheric loops\nassociated with very rapid flux cancellation.\n", "  We discuss how a q-mutation relation can be deformed replacing a pair of\nconjugate operators with two other and unrelated operators, as it is done in\nthe construction of pseudo-fermions, pseudo-bosons and truncated pseudo-bosons.\nThis deformation involves interesting mathematical problems and suggests\npossible applications to pseudo-hermitian quantum mechanics. We construct\nbi-coherent states associated to $\\D$-pseudo-quons, and we show that they share\nmany of their properties with ordinary coherent states. In particular, we find\nconditions for these states to exist, to be eigenstates of suitable\nannihilation operators and to give rise to a resolution of the identity. Two\nexamples are discussed in details, one connected to an unbounded similarity\nmap, and the other to a bounded map.\n", "  We numerically show that time delayed coherent feedback controls the\nstatistical output characteristics of driven quantum emitters. Quantum feedback\nallows to enhance or suppress a wide range of classical and nonclassical\nfeatures of the emitted quantum light. As exemplary quantum system, we use a\npumped cavity containing two emitters. By applying phase-selective feedback, we\ndemonstrate that photon antibunching and bunching can be increased in orders of\nmagnitude due to intrinsically and externally controllabe quantum\ninterferences. Our modelling is based on a fully non-Markovian quantum\nsimulation of a structured photon continuum. We show that an approximative\nmethod in the Schr\\\"odinger picture allows a very good estimate for quantum\nfeedback induced features for low pump rates.\n", "  The small-scale crisis, discrepancies between observations and N-body\nsimulations, may imply suppressed matter fluctuations on subgalactic distance\nscales. Such a suppression could be caused by some early-universe mechanism\n(e.g., broken scale invariance during inflation), leading to a modification of\nthe primordial power spectrum at the onset of the radiation-domination era.\nAlternatively, it may be due to nontrivial dark-matter properties (e.g., new\ndark-matter interactions or warm dark matter) that affect the matter power\nspectrum at late times, during radiation domination, after the perturbations\nre-enter the horizon. We show that early- and late-time suppression mechanisms\ncan be distinguished by measurement of the $\\mu$ distortion to the frequency\nspectrum of the cosmic microwave background. This is because the $\\mu$\ndistortion is suppressed, if the power suppression is primordial, relative to\nthe value expected from the dissipation of standard nearly scale-invariant\nfluctuations. We emphasize that the standard prediction of the $\\mu$ distortion\nremains unchanged in late-time scenarios even if the dark-matter effects occur\nbefore or during the era (redshifts $5\\times 10^4 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 2\\times\n10^6$) at which $\\mu$ distortions are generated.\n", "  Till date, only a handful exo-atmospheres have been well characterized,\nmostly by means of the transit method. Data show exoplanet atmospheres to be\ndiverse. However, this is based on a small number of cases. Here we focus our\nstudy on the exo-atmosphere of Qatar-1b, an exoplanet that looks much like HD\n189733b regarding its host star activity level, their surface gravity, scale\nheight, equilibrium temperature and transit parameters. Thus, our motivation\nrelied on carrying out a comparative study of their atmospheres, and assess if\nthese are regulated by their environment. In this work we present one primary\ntransit of Qatar-1b obtained during September, 2014, using the 8.1 m GEMINI\nNorth telescope. The observations were performed using the GMOS-N instrument in\nmulti-object spectroscopic mode. We collected fluxes of Qatar-1 and six more\nreference stars, covering the wavelength range between 460 and 746 nm. The\nachieved photometric precision of 0.18 parts-per-thousand in the white light\ncurve, at a cadence of 165 seconds, makes this one of the most precise datasets\nobtained from the ground. We created 12 chromatic transit light curves that we\ncomputed by integrating fluxes in wavelength bins of different sizes, ranging\nbetween 3.5 and 20 nm. Although the data are of excellent quality, the\nwavelength coverage and the precision of the transmission spectrum are not\nsufficient to neither rule out or to favor classic atmospheric models.\nNonetheless, simple statistical analysis favors the clear atmosphere scenario.\nA larger wavelength coverage or space-based data is required to characterize\nthe constituents of Qatar-1b's atmosphere and to compare it to the well known\nHD 189733b. On top of the similarities of the orbital and physical parameters\nof both exoplanets, from a long Halpha photometric follow-up of Qatar-1,\npresented in this work, we find Qatar-1 to be as active as HD 189733.\n", "  Observations of diffuse starlight in the outskirts of galaxies are thought to\nbe a fundamental source of constraints on the cosmological context of galaxy\nassembly in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Such observations are not trivial because\nof the extreme faintness of such regions. In this work, we investigate the\nphotometric properties of six massive early type galaxies (ETGs) in the VEGAS\nsample (NGC 1399, NGC 3923, NGC 4365, NGC 4472, NGC 5044, and NGC 5846) out to\nextremely low surface brightness levels, with the goal of characterizing the\nglobal structure of their light profiles for comparison to state-of-the-art\ngalaxy formation models. We carry out deep and detailed photometric mapping of\nour ETG sample taking advantage of deep imaging with VST/OmegaCAM in the g and\ni bands. By fitting the light profiles, and comparing the results to\nsimulations of elliptical galaxy assembly, we identify signatures of a\ntransition between \"relaxed\" and \"unrelaxed\" accreted components and can\nconstrain the balance between in situ and accreted stars. The very good\nagreement of our results with predictions from theoretical simulations\ndemonstrates that the full VEGAS sample of $\\sim 100$ ETGs will allow us to use\nthe distribution of diffuse light as a robust statistical probe of the\nhierarchical assembly of massive galaxies.\n", "  A stochastic version of the Barkai-Leibler model of chemotaxis receptors in\n{\\it E. coli} is studied here to elucidate the effects of intrinsic network\nnoise in their conformational dynamics. It was originally proposed to explain\nthe robust and near-perfect adaptation of {\\it E. coli} observed across a wide\nrange of spatially uniform attractant/repellent (ligand) concentrations. A\nreceptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the\ntwo states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates\nactive ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of\nmethylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation\nsites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the\nclassical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and\nKoshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system\nreduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous\nfluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise\napproximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a\nweak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor\nconcentrations. Gillespie simulations for M=2 show excellent agreement with\nanalytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show\nZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The\nmagnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is\nconsistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling\npathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on\nthe motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small\ntime-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within\nlinear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form.\n", "  Targets for ground-based gravitational wave interferometers include\ncontinuous, quasiperiodic sources of gravitational radiation, such as isolated,\nspinning neutron stars. In this work we perform evolution simulations of\nuniformly rotating, triaxially deformed stars, the compressible analogues in\ngeneral relativity of incompressible, Newtonian Jacobi ellipsoids. We\ninvestigate their stability and gravitational wave emission. We employ five\nmodels, both normal and supramassive, and track their evolution with different\ngrid setups and resolutions, as well as with two different evolution codes. We\nfind that all models are dynamically stable and produce a strain that is\napproximately one-tenth the average value of a merging binary system. We track\ntheir secular evolution and find that all our stars evolve towards axisymmetry,\nmaintaining their uniform rotation, kinetic energy, and angular momentum\nprofiles while losing their triaxiality.\n", "  In this paper, we address non-radiating and cloaking problems exploiting the\nsurface equivalence principle, by imposing at any arbitrary boundary the\ncontrol of the admittance discontinuity between the overall object (with or\nwithout cloak) and the background. After a rigorous demonstration, we apply\nthis model to a non-radiating problem, appealing for anapole modes and\nmetamolecules modeling, and to a cloaking problem, appealing for non-Foster\nmetasurface design. A straightforward analytical condition is obtained for\ncontrolling the scattering of a dielectric object over a surface boundary of\ninterest. Previous quasi-static results are confirmed and a general closed-form\nsolution beyond the subwavelength regime is provided. In addition, this\nformulation can be extended to other wave phenomena once the proper admittance\nfunction is defined (thermal, acoustics, elastomechanics, etc.).\n", "  We evaluate the octupole in the large-$N_c$ limit in the McLerran-Venugopalan\nmodel, and derive a general expression of the 2n-point correlator, which can be\napplied in analytical studies of the multi-particle production in the\nscatterings between hard probes and dense targets.\n", "  We carried out a Bayesian homogeneous determination of the orbital parameters\nof 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are alone or have distant\ncompanions; we employed DE-MCMC methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data\nfrom the literature and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N\nspectrograph for 45 systems over 3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with\ncircular orbits and $\\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet\ninteractions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar\nages, we found that hot Jupiters with $a < 0.05$ au have modified tidal quality\nfactors $10^{5} < Q'_p < 10^{9}$, and that stellar $Q'_s > 10^{6}-10^{7}$ are\nrequired to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital\ndistance. As a by-product of our analysis, we detected a non-zero eccentricity\nfor HAT-P-29; we determined that five planets that were previously regarded to\nhave hints of non-zero eccentricity have circular orbits or undetermined\neccentricities; we unveiled curvatures caused by distant companions in the RV\ntime series of HAT-P-2, HAT-P-22, and HAT-P-29; and we revised the planetary\nparameters of CoRoT-1b.\n", "  As is well known, multivariate Rogers-Szeg\\\"o polynomials are closely\nconnected with the partition functions of the $A_{N-1}$ type of Polychronakos\nspin chains having long-range interactions. Applying the `freezing trick', here\nwe derive the partition functions for a class of $BC_N$ type of Polychronakos\nspin chains containing supersymmetric analogues of polarized spin reversal\noperators and subsequently use those partition functions to obtain novel\nmultivariate super Rogers-Szeg\\\"o (SRS) polynomials depending on four types of\nvariables. We construct the generating functions for such SRS polynomials and\nshow that these polynomials can be written as some bilinear combinations of the\n$A_{N-1}$ type of SRS polynomials. We also use the above mentioned generating\nfunctions to derive a set of recursion relations for the partition functions of\nthe $BC_N$ type of Polychronakos spin chains involving different numbers of\nlattice sites and internal degrees of freedom.\n", "  We study the emission of soft photons coupling to high energy fixed angle\nscattering processes at first order in the electromagnetic coupling but to all\nloop orders in a class of theories without soft divergences, including massive\nand massless Yukawa and scalar theories. We adapt a method introduced by del\nDuca for quantum electrodynamics to show that subleading corrections to the\nsoft photon theorem are sensitive to the structure of non leading external jets\nof collinear lines. Our techniques are based on a power counting analysis of\nloop integrals and an application of jet Ward identities. We also apply Grammer\nand Yennie's decomposition to isolate separately gauge invariant contributions\nto the soft photon expansion. These are interpreted as infrared sensitive\nmatrix elements coupling to a field strength tensor.\n", "  In this work, we construct a generalized Kane model with a new coupling term\nbetween itinerant electron spins and local magnetic moments of\nanti-ferromagnetic ordering in order to describe the low energy effective\nphysics in a large family of anti-ferromagnetic half-Heusler materials.\nTopological properties of this generalized Kane model is studied and a large\nvariety of topological phases, including Dirac semimetal phase, Weyl semimetal\nphase, nodal line semimetal phase, type-B triple point semimetal phase,\ntopological mirror (or glide) insulating phase and anti-ferromagnetic\ntopological insulating phase, are identified in different parameter regions of\nour effective models. In particular, we find that the system is always driven\ninto the anti-ferromagnetic topological insulator phase once a bulk band gap is\nopen, irrespective of the magnetic moment direction, thus providing a robust\nrealization of anti-ferromagentic topological insulators. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the possible realization of these topological phases in realistic\nanti-ferromagnetic half-Heusler materials. Our effective model provides a basis\nfor the future study of physical phenomena in this class of materials.\n", "  Stellar rotation affects the transport of chemical elements and angular\nmomentum and is therefore a key process during stellar evolution, which is\nstill not fully understood. This is especially true for massive stars, which\nare important for the chemical enrichment of the universe. It is therefore\nimportant to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum\ndistribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar\ninternal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally\nsplit oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars\nmore massive than the Sun. The SPB star HD201433 is known to be part of a\nsingle-lined spectroscopic triple system, with two low-mass companions orbiting\nwith periods of about 3.3 and 154 d. Our results are based on photometric\nobservations made by BRITE - Constellation and the SMEI on board the Coriolis\nsatellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 years of radial\nvelocity measurements. We identify a sequence of 9 rotationally split dipole\nmodes in the photometric time series and establish that HD201433 is in\nprinciple a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297+/-76 d.\nTidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly\naccelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one\nhundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of HD201433 is also\nreflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of\nabout 0.9 s during the last 96 years. Combining the asteroseismic inferences\nwith the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner\nbinary system, we conclude that tidal interactions between the central SPB star\nand its inner companion have almost circularised the orbit but not yet aligned\nall spins of the system and have just begun to synchronise rotation.\n", "  We present a Peccei-Quinn (PQ)-symmetric two-Higgs doublet model that\nnaturally predicts a fermionic singlet dark matter in the mass range 10 keV-1\nGeV. The origin of the smallness of the mass of this light singlet fermion\narises predominantly at the one-loop level, upon soft or spontaneous breakdown\nof the PQ symmetry via a complex scalar field in a fashion similar to the\nso-called Dine-Fischler-Sredniki-Zhitnitsky axion model. The mass generation of\nthis fermionic Radiative Light Dark Matter (RLDM) requires the existence of two\nheavy vector-like SU(2) isodoublets, which are not charged under the PQ\nsymmetry. We show how the RLDM can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism,\nthus accounting for the missing matter in the Universe. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss possible theoretical and phenomenological implications of the RLDM\nmodel for the strong CP problem and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  We study a superconductor that is coupled to a superfluid via density and\nderivative couplings. Starting from a Lagrangian for two complex scalar fields,\nwe derive a temperature-dependent Ginzburg-Landau potential, which is then used\nto compute the phase diagram at nonzero temperature and external magnetic\nfield. This includes the calculation of the critical magnetic fields for the\ntransition to an array of magnetic flux tubes, based on an approximation for\nthe interaction between the flux tubes. We find that the transition region\nbetween type-I and type-II superconductivity changes qualitatively due to the\npresence of the superfluid: the phase transitions at the upper and lower\ncritical fields in the type-II regime become first order, opening the\npossibility of clustered flux tube phases. These flux tube clusters may be\nrealized in the core of neutron stars, where superconducting protons are\nexpected to be coupled to superfluid neutrons.\n", "  The magnetic phase diagram of a plaquette dimerized antiferromagnetic system\nis studied by using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques. For\nthe strongly frustrated regime, series expansions and bond operators techniques\nare employed to analyze zero magnetization plateau, whereas low energy\neffective models are used to study the complete magnetization process. The\ninterplay between frustration and dimerization gives rise to a rich plateaus\nstructure that is captured by effective models and corroborated by numerical\ndensity matrix renormalization group simulations, in particular the emergence\nof intermediate plateaus at M = 1/4 and 3/4 of saturation in the magnetization\ncurve.\n", "  During the first observing run of LIGO, two gravitational wave events and one\nlower-significance trigger (LVT151012) were reported by the LIGO/Virgo\ncollaboration. At the time of LVT151012, the INTErnational Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) was pointing at a region of the sky\ncoincident with the high localization probability area of the event and thus\npermitted us to search for its electromagnetic counterpart (both prompt and\nafterglow emission). The imaging instruments on-board INTEGRAL (IBIS/ISGRI,\nIBIS/PICsIT, SPI, and the two JEM-X modules) have been exploited to attempt the\ndetection of any electromagnetic emission associated with LVT151012 over 3\ndecades in energy (from 3 keV to 8 MeV). The omni-directional instruments\non-board the satellite, i.e. the SPI-ACS and IBIS monitored the entire\nLVT151012 localization region at energies above 75 keV. We did not find any\nsignificant transient source that was spatially and/or temporally coincident\nwith LVT151012, obtaining tight upper limits on the associated hard X-ray and\n$\\gamma$-ray radiation. For typical spectral models, the upper limits on the\nfluence of the emission from any 1 s long-lasting counterpart of LVT151012\nranges from $F_{\\gamma}=$3.5$\\times$10$^{-8}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (20 - 200 keV) to\n$F_{\\gamma}$=7.1$\\times$10$^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (75 - 2000 keV), constraining\nthe ratio of the isotropic equivalent energy released in the electromagnetic\nemission to the total energy of the gravitational waves:\n$E_{75-2000~keV}/E_{GW}<$4.4$\\times$10$^{-5}$. Finally, we provide an\nexhaustive summary of the capabilities of all instruments on-board INTEGRAL to\nhunt for $\\gamma$-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, exploiting\nboth serendipitous and pointed follow-up observations. This will serve as a\nreference for all future searches.\n", "  We use strong sub-additivity of entanglement entropy, Lorentz invariance, and\nthe Markov property of the vacuum state of a conformal field theory to give a\nnew proof of the irreversibility of the renormalization group in d=4 space-time\ndimensions -- the a-theorem. This extends the proofs of the c and F theorems in\ndimensions d=2 and d=3 based on vacuum entanglement entropy, and gives a\nunified picture of all known irreversibility theorems in relativistic quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  A detailed first-principle study has been performed to evaluate the\nelectronic and optical properties of single-layer (SL) transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) (MX${}_2$; M= transition metal such as Mo, W and X= S,\nSe, Te), in the presence of vacancy defects (VDs). Defects usually play an\nimportant role in tailoring electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of\nsemiconductors. We consider three types of VDs in SL TMDCs i) $X$-vacancy,\n$X_{2}$-vacancy, and iii) $M$-vacancy. We show that VDs lead to localized\ndefect states (LDS) in the band structure, which in turn give rise to sharp\ntransitions in in-plane and out-of-plane optical susceptibilities,\n$\\chi_{\\parallel}$ and $\\chi_{\\perp}$. The effects of spin orbit coupling (SOC)\nare also considered. We find that SOC splitting in LDS is directly related to\nthe atomic number of the transition metal atoms. Apart from electronic and\noptical properties we also find magnetic signatures (local magnetic moment of\n$\\sim\\mu_{B}$) in MoSe$_{2}$ in the presence of Mo vacancy, which breaks the\ntime reversal symmetry and therefore lifts the Kramers degeneracy. We show that\na simple qualitative tight binding model (TBM), involving only the hopping\nbetween atoms surrounding the vacancy with an on-site SOC term, is sufficient\nto capture the essential features of LDS. In addition, the existence of the LDS\ncan be understood from the solution of the 2D Dirac Hamiltonian by employing\ninfinite mass boundary conditions. In order to provide a clear description of\nthe optical absorption spectra, we use group theory to derive the optical\nselection rules between LDS for both $\\chi_{\\parallel}$ and $\\chi_{\\perp}$.\n", "  We discuss the amplification of loop corrections in quantum many-body systems\nthrough dynamical instabilities. As an example, we investigate both\nanalytically and numerically a two-component ultracold atom system in one\nspatial dimension. The model features a tachyonic instability, which\nincorporates characteristic aspects of the mechanisms for particle production\nin early-universe inflaton models. We establish a direct correspondence between\nmeasureable macroscopic growth rates for occupation numbers of the ultracold\nBose gas and the underlying microscopic processes in terms of Feynman loop\ndiagrams. We analyze several existing ultracold atom setups featuring dynamical\ninstabilities and propose optimized protocols for their experimental\nrealization. We demonstrate that relevant dynamical processes can be enhanced\nusing a seeding procedure for unstable modes and clarify the role of initial\nquantum fluctuations and the generation of a non-linear secondary stage for the\namplification of modes.\n", "  Hadronic decay widths of the newly observed charmed strange baryons,\n$\\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$\nand $\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ have been calculated in a $^3P_0$ model. Our results\nindicate that $\\Omega_c(3066)^0$ and $\\Omega_c(3090)^0$ can be interpreted as\nthe $1P-$wave $\\Omega_{c2}(\\frac{3}{2}^-)$ or $\\Omega_{c2}(\\frac{5}{2}^-)$.\nThough the measured masses of $\\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\\Omega_c(3050)^0$ and\n$\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ are lower than existed theoretical predictions of $1D-$wave\n$\\Omega_c$, the hadronic decay features of these $\\Omega_c$ favor assignments\nof the $1D-$wave states. $\\Omega_c(3000)^0$ is possibly\n$\\Omega_{c1}(\\frac{1}{2}^+)$ or $\\Omega_{c1}(\\frac{3}{2}^+)$,\n$\\Omega_c(3050)^0$ is possibly $\\hat\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$ or\n$\\hat\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$, and $\\Omega_c(3119)^0$ is possibly\n$\\hat\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$, $\\hat\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$,\n$\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{5}{2}^+)$ or $\\Omega_{c3}(\\frac{7}{2}^+)$. The predicted\ntotal decay widths in these assignments are consistent with experiment.\n", "  In this paper, we revisit the issue of static hairs of black holes in\ngravitational theories with broken Lorentz invariance in the case that the\nspeed $c_{\\phi}$ of the khronon field becomes infinitely large, $c_{\\phi} =\n\\infty$, for which the sound horizon of the khronon field coincides with the\nuniversal horizon, and the boundary conditions at the sound horizon reduce to\nthose given normally at the universal horizons. As a result, less boundary\nconditions are present in this extreme case in comparison with the case\n$c_{\\phi} = $ finite. Then, it would be expected that static hairs might exist.\nHowever, we show analytically that even in this case static hairs still cannot\nexist, based on a decoupling limit analysis. We also consider the cases in\nwhich $c_{\\phi}$ is finite but with $c_{\\phi} \\gg 1$, and obtain the same\nconclusion.\n", "  The relation between the mass accretion rate onto the circumstellar disc and\nthe rate of mass ejection by magnetically driven winds is investigated using\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Using a spherical cloud\ncore with a varying ratio of thermal to gravitational energy, which determines\nthe mass accretion rate onto the disc, to define the initial conditions, the\noutflow propagation for approximately 10^4 yr after protostar formation is then\ncalculated for several cloud cores. The mass ejection rate and accretion rate\nare comparable only when the magnetic energy of the initial cloud core is\ncomparable to the gravitational energy. Consequently, in strongly magnetised\nclouds a higher mass accretion rate naturally produces both massive protostars\nand massive outflows. The simulated outflow mass, momentum, kinetic energy and\nmomentum flux agree well with observations, indicating that massive stars form\nthrough the same mechanism as low-mass stars but require a significantly strong\nmagnetic field to launch massive outflows.\n", "  A measurement of the production cross section for two isolated photons in\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV is\npresented. The results are based on an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$\nrecorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement\nconsiders photons with pseudorapidities satisfying $|\\eta^{\\gamma}|<1.37$ or\n${1.56<|\\eta^{\\gamma}|<2.37}$ and transverse energies of respectively\n$E_{\\mathrm{T,1}}^{\\gamma}>40$ GeV and $E_{\\mathrm{T,2}}^{\\gamma}>30$ GeV for\nthe two leading photons ordered in transverse energy produced in the\ninteraction.The background due to hadronic jets and electrons is subtracted\nusing data-driven techniques. The fiducial cross sections are corrected for\ndetector effects and measured differentially as a function of six kinematic\nobservables. The measured cross section integrated within the fiducial volume\nis $16.8 \\pm 0.8$ pb. The data are compared to fixed-order QCD calculations at\nnext-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy as well as\nnext-to-leading-order computations including resummation of initial-state gluon\nradiation at next-to-next-to-leading logarithm or matched to a parton shower,\nwith relative uncertainties varying from 5% to 20%.\n", "  The latest INTEGRAL/IBIS all-sky survey lists 219 hard X-ray sources whose\nnature is still unknown. We report on our ongoing campaign aimed at identifying\nthese high-energy emitters by exploiting the focusing capabilities of the X-ray\nTelescope (XRT, 0.2-10 keV) on board Swift, which allow an enhancement of the\nsource localisation to arcsec level, thus facilitating the identification of\nthe likely counterpart. By cross-correlating the list of the unidentified IBIS\nsources included in the latest IBIS catalogue with Swift/XRT archival data, we\nfound a set of 14 objects, not yet reported in the literature, for which XRT\ndata were available. We found no detection in only one case, a single X-ray\nassociation in 9 sources, and 2/3 associations in the remaining objects. We\nthen made use of multi-waveband archives to search for counterparts at other\nwavelengths of these XRT detections and exploited X-ray spectral information in\nan attempt to determine their nature and association with the IBIS object. As a\nresult of our analysis, we identified a single counterpart for 13 sources,\nalthough in some cases its nature/class could not be assessed on the basis of\nthe information collected. More specifically, we found that SWIFT J0924.2-3141\nand SWIFT J1839.1-5717 are absorbed AGN, while SWIFT J0800.7-4309 and 1SWXRT\nJ230642.8+550817 are Cataclysmic Variable binary systems. Finally, we found\nthat IGR J14059-6116 is likely associated with the Fermi source 3FGL\nJ1405.4-6119. In the case of XMMSL1 J030715.5-545536 no XRT counterpart was\ndetected. In all the other cases, optical/infrared spectroscopy is necessary to\nclassify properly each X-ray counterpart and confirm their association with the\nINTEGRAL/IBIS detection.\n", "  We present the first results of a radio survey of 79 narrow-line Seyfert 1\n(NLS1) carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at 5 GHz in\nA configuration aimed at studying the radio properties of these sources. We\nreport the detection of extended emission in one object: Mrk 783. This is\nintriguing, since the radio-loudness parameter R of this object is close to the\nthreshold between radio-quiet and radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). The\ngalaxy is one of the few NLS1 showing such an extended emission at z < 0.1. The\nradio emission is divided in a compact core component and an extended\ncomponent, observed on both sides of the nucleus and extending from 14 kpc\nsouth-east to 12 kpc north-west. There is no sign of a collimated jet, and the\nshape of the extended component is similar to those of some Seyfert galaxies.\nThe properties of the emission are compatible with a relic produced by the\nintermittent activity cycle of the AGN.\n", "  A combined ab initio and quantum dynamical study characterizes a family of\nbent neutral carbon dioxide molecules in terms of their vibrational levels,\nelectric dipole moment surfaces, and infrared spectra in the gas phase. The\nconsidered isomers include the dioxiranylidene (cyclic) form of CO$_2$ with the\nequilibrium valence angle of 72$^\\circ$, belonging to the ground electronic\nstate, and four open structures with the valence angles of\n118$^\\circ$/119$^\\circ$ (belonging to the singlet and triplet electronic states\n$2^1\\!A'$ and $1^3\\!A'$, respectively) and 127$^\\circ$/128$^\\circ$ (states\n$1^1\\!A\"$ and $1^3\\!A\"$, respectively). All studied bent structures possess\npermanent dipole moments. For all isomers, the antisymmetric stretch\nfundamental is the strongest infrared transition. Individual bent molecules can\nbe distinguished on the basis of strong absorption bands in the frequency\nwindow 1100\\,cm$^{-1}$ --- 1800\\,cm$^{-1}$ as well as isotopic shifts in the\nprogression of antisymmetric stretch mode. Excitation of bent neutral carbon\ndioxide near a perfect metal surface is also briefly discussed. It is argued\nthat the excitation energy from the linear ground state exhibits a red red\nshift which depends on the molecule---metal distance.\n", "  The efficiency of optical trapping is determined by the atomic dynamic dipole\npolarizability, whose real and imaginary parts are associated with the\npotential energy and photon-scattering rate respectively. In this article we\ndevelop a formalism to calculate analytically the real and imaginary parts of\nthe scalar, vector and tensor polarizabilities of lanthanide atoms. We assume\nthat the sum-over-state formula only comprises transitions involving electrons\nin the valence orbitals like $6s$, $5d$, $6p$ or $7s$, while transitions\ninvolving $4f$ core electrons are neglected. Applying this formalism to the\nground level of configuration $4f^q6s^2$, we restrict the sum to transitions\nimplying the $4f^q6s6p$ configuration, which yields polarizabilities depending\non two parameters: an effective transition energy and an effective transition\ndipole moment. Then, by introducing configuration-interaction mixing between\n$4f^q6s6p$ and other configurations, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of\nthe scalar, vector and tensor polarizabilities is very sensitive to\nconfiguration-interaction coefficients, whereas the real part is not. The\nmagnitude and anisotropy of the photon-scattering rate is thus strongly related\nto the details of the atomic electronic structure. Those analytical results\nagree with our detailed electronic-structure calculations of energy levels,\nLand\\'e $g$-factors, transition probabilities, polarizabilities and van der\nWaals $C_6$ coefficients, previously performed on erbium and dysprosium, and\npresently performed on holmium. Our results show that, although the density of\nstates decreases with increasing $q$, the configuration interaction between\n$4f^q6s6p$, $4f^{q-1}5d6s^2$ and $4f^{q-1}5d^26s$ is surprisingly stronger in\nerbium ($q=12$), than in holmium ($q=11$), itself stronger than in dysprosium\n($q=10$).\n", "  The SU(1,1) interferometer can be thought of as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer\nwith its linear beamsplitters replaced with parametric nonlinear optical\nprocesses. We consider the cases of bright and vacuum-seeded SU(1,1)\ninterferometers using intensity or homodyne detectors. A simplified, truncated\nscheme with only one nonlinear interaction is introduced, which not only beats\nconventional intensity detection with a bright seed, but can saturate the phase\nsensitivity bound set by the quantum Fisher information. We also show that the\ntruncated scheme achieves a sub-shot-noise phase sensitivity in the\nvacuum-seeded case, despite the phase-sensing optical beams having no\nwell-defined phase.\n", "  In this experiment, we couple a superconducting Transmon qubit to a\nhigh-impedance $645\\ \\Omega$ microwave resonator. Doing so leads to a large\nqubit-resonator coupling rate $g$, measured through a large vacuum Rabi\nsplitting of $2g\\simeq 910$ MHz. The coupling is a significant fraction of the\nqubit and resonator oscillation frequencies $\\omega$, placing our system close\nto the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\\bar{g}=g/\\omega=0.071$ on resonance).\nCombining this setup with a vacuum-gap Transmon architecture shows the\npotential of reaching deep into the ultra-strong coupling $\\bar{g} \\sim 0.45$\nwith Transmon qubits.\n", "  The lack of observation of supersymmetry thus far implies that the weak\nsupersymmetry scale is larger than what was thought before the LHC era. This\nobservation is strengthened by the Higgs boson mass measurement at $\\sim 125$\nGeV which within supersymmetric models implies a large loop correction and a\nweak supersymmetry scale lying in the several TeV region. In addition if\nneutralino is the dark matter, its relic density puts further constraints on\nmodels often requiring coannihilation to reduce the neutralino relic density to\nbe consistent with experimental observation. The coannihilation in turn implies\nthat the mass gap between the LSP and the NLSP will be small leading to softer\nfinal states and making the observation of supersymmetry challenging. In this\nwork we investigate stau coannihilation models within supergravity grand\nunified models and the potential of discovery of such models at the LHC in the\npost Higgs boson discovery era. We utilize a variety of signal regions to\noptimize the discovery of supersymmetry in the stau coannihilation region. In\nthe analysis presented we impose the relic density constraint as well as the\nconstraint of the Higgs boson mass. The range of sparticle masses discoverable\nup to the optimal integrated luminosity of the HL-LHC is investigated. It is\nfound that the mass difference between the stau and the neutralino does not\nexceed $\\sim 20$ GeV over the entire mass range of the models explored. Thus\nthe discovery of a supersymmetric signal arising from the stau coannihilation\nregion will also provide a measurement of the neutralino mass. The direct\ndetection of neutralino dark matter is analyzed within the class of stau\ncoannihilation models investigated. The analysis is extended to include\nmulti-particle coannihilation where stau along with chargino and the second\nneutralino enter in the stau coannihilation process.\n", "  Determination of absolute parallaxes by means of a scanning astrometric\nsatellite such as Hipparcos or Gaia relies on the short-term stability of the\nso-called basic angle between the two viewing directions. Uncalibrated\nvariations of the basic angle may produce systematic errors in the computed\nparallaxes. We examine the coupling between a global parallax shift and\nspecific variations of the basic angle, namely those related to the satellite\nattitude with respect to the Sun. The changes in observables produced by small\nperturbations of the basic angle, attitude, and parallaxes are calculated\nanalytically. We then look for a combination of perturbations that has no net\neffect on the observables. In the approximation of infinitely small fields of\nview, it is shown that certain perturbations of the basic angle are\nobservationally indistinguishable from a global shift of the parallaxes. If\nsuch perturbations exist, they cannot be calibrated from the astrometric\nobservations but will produce a global parallax bias. Numerical simulations of\nthe astrometric solution, using both direct and iterative methods, confirm this\ntheoretical result. For a given amplitude of the basic angle perturbation, the\nparallax bias is smaller for a larger basic angle and a larger solar aspect\nangle. In both these respects Gaia has a more favourable geometry than\nHipparcos. In the case of Gaia, internal metrology is used to monitor basic\nangle variations. Additionally, Gaia has the advantage of detecting numerous\nquasars, which can be used to verify the parallax zero point.\n", "  Existing theoretical and observational constraints on the abundance of\nmagnetic monopoles are limited. Here we demonstrate that an ensemble of\nmonopoles forms a plasma whose properties are well determined and whose\ncollective effects place new tight constraints on the cosmological abundance of\nmonopoles. In particular, the existence of micro-Gauss magnetic fields in\ngalaxy clusters and radio relics implies that the scales of these structures\nare below the Debye screening length, thus setting an upper limit on the\ncosmological density parameter of monopoles, $\\Omega_M\\lesssim3\\times10^{-4}$,\nwhich precludes them from being the dark matter. Future detection of Gpc-scale\ncoherent magnetic fields could improve this limit by a few orders of magnitude.\nIn addition, we predict the existence of magnetic Langmuir waves and turbulence\nwhich may appear on the sky as \"zebra patterns\" of an alternating magnetic\nfield with ${\\bf k\\cdot B}\\not=0$. We also show that magnetic monopole Langmuir\nturbulence excited near the accretion shock of galaxy clusters may be an\nefficient mechanism for generating the observed intracluster magnetic fields.\n", "  We study work extraction (defined as the difference between the initial and\nthe final energy) in noninteracting and (effectively) weakly interacting\nisolated fermionic quantum lattice systems in one dimension, which undergo a\nsequence of quenches and equilibration. The systems are divided in two parts,\nwhich we identify as the subsystem of interest and the bath. We extract work by\nquenching the on-site potentials in the subsystem, letting the entire system\nequilibrate, and returning to the initial parameters in the subsystem using a\nquasi-static process (the bath is never acted upon). We select initial states\nthat are direct products of thermal states of the subsystem and the bath, and\nconsider equilibration to the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE, noninteracting\ncase) and to the Gibbs ensemble (GE, weakly interacting case). We identify the\nclass of quenches that, in the thermodynamic limit, results in GE and GGE\nentropies after the quench that are identical to the one in the initial state\n(quenches that do not produce entropy). Those quenches guarantee maximal work\nextraction when thermalization occurs. We show that the same remains true in\nthe presence of integrable dynamics that results in equilibration to the GGE.\n", "  In the present work, the critical temperature, critical pressure and critical\ndensity, known as the critical parameters related to the liquid-gas phase\ntransition are calculated for 34 relativistic mean-field models, which were\nshown to satisfy nuclear matter constraints in a comprehensive study involving\n263 models. The compressibility factor was calculated and all 34 models present\nvalues lower than the one obtained with the van der Waals equation of state.\nThe critical temperatures were compared with experimental data and just two\nclasses of models can reach values close to them. A correlation between the\ncritical parameters and the incompressibility was obtained.\n", "  Revelation of the effects of isotope fractionation during fragmentation in\nelectron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) on compound-specific isotope\nanalysis of chlorine and bromine (CSIA-Cl/Br) may be of crucial significance,\nyet a theoretical basis for elucidating the effects is absent. This study\nprovides a solid theoretical deduction regarding the isotope fractionation\ntaking place during fragmentation in EI-MS. Both intermolecular and\nintramolecular isotope fractionations present in dehalogenation processes,\ninfluencing the isotope ratios of detected ions. In general, intermolecular\nisotope fractionation positively affects the isotope ratios of precursor ions\nbut inversely impacts those of the corresponding product ions. Molecular ions\nare normally affected by one type of intermolecular isotope fractionation only\nduring the dehalogenation from parent ions to their product ions. While product\nions can be impacted by two types of intermolecular isotope fractionations,\nnamely, the inverse intermolecular isotope fractionation from parent ions to\ntheir product ions and the normal intermolecular isotope fractionation from the\nproduct ions to their further dehalogenated product ions. For a compound having\nposition-distinct isotope ratios, if dehalogenation reacts on only one\nposition, the intermolecular isotope fractionation taking palace in this\nreaction is normal for the detected precursor ion, but ineffective to the\nproduct ion isotope ratio in comparison with that of the total precursor ions.\nOn the other hand, intramolecular isotope fractionation positively affects the\nisotope ratios of product ions only. The chlorine isotopologues of the observed\nprecursor ions are deduced to never obey binomial distribution, regardless of\nwhat modes of the initial isotopologue distributions of the total precursor\nions are.\n", "  The influence of Sb content, substrate type and cap layers on the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect observed in V-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ magnetic\ntopological insulators is investigated. Thin layers showing excellent\nquantization are reproducibly deposited by molecular beam epitaxy at growth\nconditions effecting a compromise between controlled layer properties and high\ncrystalline quality. The Sb content can be reliably determined from the\nin-plane lattice constant measured by X-ray diffraction, even in thin layers.\nThis is the main layer parameter to be optimized in order to approach charge\nneutrality. Within a narrow range at about 80% Sb content, the Hall resistivity\nshows a maximum of about 10 k$\\Omega$ at 4 K and quantizes at mK temperatures.\nUnder these conditions, thin layers grown on Si(111) or InP(111) and with or\nwithout a Te cap exhibit quantization. The quantization persists independently\nof the interfaces between cap, layer and substrate, the limited crystalline\nquality, and the degradation of the layer proving the robustness of the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect.\n", "  We present a novel analysis of the metal-poor star sample in the complete\nRadial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) Data Release 5 catalog with the goal of\nidentifying and characterizing all very metal-poor stars observed by the\nsurvey. Using a three-stage method, we first identified the candidate stars\nusing only their spectra as input information. We employed an algorithm called\nt-SNE to construct a low-dimensional projection of the spectrum space and\nisolate the region containing metal-poor stars. Following this step, we\nmeasured the equivalent widths of the near-infrared CaII triplet lines with a\nmethod based on flexible Gaussian processes to model the correlated noise\npresent in the spectra. In the last step, we constructed a calibration relation\nthat converts the measured equivalent widths and the color information coming\nfrom the 2MASS and WISE surveys into metallicity and temperature estimates. We\nidentified 877 stars with at least a 50% probability of being very metal-poor\n$(\\rm [Fe/H] < -2\\,\\rm dex)$, out of which 43 are likely extremely metal-poor\n$(\\rm [Fe/H] < -3\\,\\rm dex )$. The comparison of the derived values to a small\nsubsample of stars with literature metallicity values shows that our method\nworks reliably and correctly estimates the uncertainties, which typically have\nvalues $\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]} \\approx 0.2\\,\\mathrm{dex}$. In addition, when\ncompared to the metallicity results derived using the RAVE DR5 pipeline, it is\nevident that we achieve better accuracy than the pipeline and therefore more\nreliably evaluate the very metal-poor subsample. Based on the repeated\nobservations of the same stars, our method gives very consistent results. The\nmethod used in this work can also easily be extended to other large-scale data\nsets, including to the data from the Gaia mission and the upcoming 4MOST\nsurvey.\n", "  We derive constraints on the coupling constants of axion-like particles to\nnucleons and on the Yukawa-type corrections to Newton's gravitational law from\nthe results of recent experiment on measuring the difference of Casimir forces\nbetween a Ni-coated sphere and Au and Ni sectors of a structured disc. Over the\nwide range of axion masses from 2.61\\,meV to 0.9\\,eV the obtained constraints\non the axion-to-nucleon coupling are up to a factor of 14.6 stronger than all\npreviously known constraints following from experiments on measuring the\nCasimir interaction. The constraints on non-Newtonian gravity found here are\nalso stronger than all that following from the Casimir and Cavendish-type\nexperiments over the interaction range from 30\\,nm to $5.4\\,\\mu$m. They are up\nto a factor of 177 stronger than the constraints derived recently from\nmeasuring the difference of lateral forces. Our constraints confirm previous\nsomewhat stronger limits obtained from the isoelectronic experiment, where the\ncontribution of the Casimir force was nullified.\n", "  In the presence of massive bosonic degrees of freedom, rotational\nsuperradiance can trigger an instability that spins down black holes. This\nleads to peculiar gravitational-wave signatures and distribution in the\nspin-mass plane, which in turn can impose stringent constraints on ultralight\nfields. Here, we demonstrate that there is an analogous spindown effect for\nconducting stars. We show that rotating stars amplify low frequency\nelectromagnetic waves, and that this effect is largest when the time scale for\nconduction within the star is of the order of a light crossing time. This has\ninteresting consequences for dark photons, as massive dark photons would cause\nstars to spin down due to superradiant instabilities. The time scale of the\nspindown depends on the mass of the dark photon, and on the rotation rate,\ncompactness, and conductivity of the star. Existing measurements of the\nspindown rate of pulsars place direct constraints on models of dark sectors.\nOur analysis suggests that dark photons of mass $m_V \\sim 10^{-12}$ eV are\nexcluded by pulsar-timing observations. These constraints also exclude\nsuperradiant instabilities triggered by dark photons as an explanation for the\nspin limit of observed pulsars.\n", "  X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the valence state in\nLa$_2$Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_{1+x}$O$_6$ ($x\\approx 0.23$) thin films. We found that in\nspite of the non-stoichiometry, Co is in a divalent state while Mn ions show a\nmixed valence state. The relation of this finding with the magnetic properties\nof the films is discussed. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements prove\nthat magnetic anisotropy originates from Co spin-orbit coupling and it is\nstrain-dependent: a strong increase of the angular contribution to the magnetic\nmoment is found when in-plane (out-of-plane) and cell parameters get expanded\n(compressed). This behavior is reproduced by first order perturbation theory\ncalculations.\n", "  We calculate the gauge invariant Drell-Yan-like hadron tensors. In connection\nwith new COMPASS results, we propose the single spin asymmetry which probes\ngluon poles together with chiral-odd and time-odd functions. The relevant pion\nproduction as a particular case of Drell-Yan-like process has been discussed.\nFor the meson-induced Drell-Yan process, we model an analog of the twist three\ndistribution function, which is a collinear function in inclusive channel, by\nmeans of two non-collinear distribution amplitudes which are associated with\nexclusive channel. This modelling demonstrates the fundamental duality between\ndifferent factorization regimes.\n", "  In this work, we study the odd-even effect in binding energies and charge\nradii, and systematic behavior of differential radii, to identify the\nunderlying components of the effective nuclear interaction. We apply nuclear\ndensity functional theory using a family of Fayans and Skyrme energy density\nfunctionals fitted to similar datasets but using different optimization\nprotocols. We inspect various correlations between differential charge radii,\nodd-even staggering in energies and radii, and nuclear matter properties.\nDetailed analysis is carried out for medium-mass and heavy semi-magic nuclei\nwith a particular focus on the Ca chain. By making the surface and pairing\nterms dependent on density gradients, the Fayans functional offers the superb\nsimultaneous description of odd-even staggering effects in energies and charge\nradii. Conversely, when the data on differential radii are added to the pool of\nfit-observables, the coupling constants determining the strengths of the\ngradient terms of Fayans functional are increased by orders of magnitude. The\nSkyrme functional optimized in this work with the generalized Fayans pairing\nterm offers results of similar quality. We quantify these findings by\nperforming correlation analysis based on the statistical linear regression\ntechnique. The nuclear matter parameters characterizing Fayans and Skyrme\nfunctionals optimized to similar datasets are fairly close.\n", "  We present a new mechanism to produce the dark photon ($\\gamma'$) in the\nearly universe with a help of the axion ($a$) using a recently proposed dark\naxion portal. The dark photon, a light gauge boson in the dark sector, can be a\nrelic dark matter if its lifetime is long enough. The main process we consider\nis a variant of the Primakoff process $f a \\to f \\gamma'$ mediated by a photon,\nwhich is possible with the axion--photon--dark photon coupling. The axion is\nthermalized in the early universe because of the strong interaction and it can\ncontribute to the non-thermal dark photon production through the dark axion\nportal coupling. It provides a two-component dark matter sector, and the relic\ndensity deficit issue of the axion dark matter can be addressed by the\ncompensation with the dark photon. The dark photon dark matter can also address\nthe reported 3.5 keV $X$-ray excess via the $\\gamma' \\to \\gamma a$ decay.\n", "  We present the first self-consistent chemodynamical model fitted to reproduce\ndata for the galactic bulge, bar and inner disk. We extend the Made-to-Measure\nmethod to an augmented phase-space including the metallicity of stars, and show\nits first application to the bar region of the Milky Way. Using data from the\nARGOS and APOGEE (DR12) surveys, we adapt the recent dynamical model from\nPortail et al. to reproduce the observed spatial and kinematic variations as a\nfunction of metallicity, thus allowing the detailed study of the 3D density\ndistributions, kinematics and orbital structure of stars in different\nmetallicity bins. We find that metal-rich stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 are strongly\nbarred and have dynamical properties that are consistent with a common disk\norigin. Metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 show strong kinematic variations\nwith metallicity, indicating varying contributions from the underlying stellar\npopulations. Outside the central kpc, metal-poor stars are found to have the\ndensity and kinematics of a thick disk while in the inner kpc, evidence for an\nextra concentration of metal-poor stars is found. Finally, the combined orbit\ndistributions of all metallicities in the model naturally reproduce the\nobserved vertex deviations in the bulge. This paper demonstrates the power of\nMade-to-Measure chemodynamical models, that when extended to other chemical\ndimensions will be very powerful tools to maximize the information obtained\nfrom large spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE, GALAH and MOONS.\n", "  We study the quantum fermionic billiard defined by the dynamics of a\nquantized supersymmetric squashed three-sphere (Bianchi IX cosmological model\nwithin D=4 simple supergravity). The quantization of the homogeneous gravitino\nfield leads to a 64-dimensional fermionic Hilbert space. We focus on the 15-\nand 20-dimensional subspaces (with fermion numbers N_F=2 and N_F=3) where there\nexist propagating solutions of the supersymmetry constraints that carry (in the\nsmall-wavelength limit) a chaotic spinorial dynamics generalizing the\nBelinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz classical \"oscillatory\" dynamics. By exactly\nsolving the supersymmetry constraints near each one of the three dominant\npotential walls underlying the latter chaotic billiard dynamics, we compute the\nthree operators that describe the corresponding three potential-wall\nreflections of the spinorial state describing, in supergravity, the quantum\nevolution of the universe. It is remarkably found that the latter, purely\ndynamically-defined, reflection operators satisfy generalized Coxeter relations\nwhich define a type of spinorial extension of the Weyl group of the rank-3\nhyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra AE_3.\n", "  Be/X-ray binaries are the most populous class of High Mass X-ray Binaries.\nTheir X-ray duty cycle is tightly related to the optical companion wind\nactivity, which in turn can be studied through optical spectroscopical\ndedicated observations. We study optical spectral features of the Be\ncircumstellar disk to test their long-term variability and their relation with\nthe X-ray activity. Special attention has been given to the H$\\alpha$ emission\nline, that is one of the best tracers of the disk conditions. We obtained\noptical broadband medium resolution spectra from a dedicated campaign with the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope and the Southern African Large Telescope in\n2014-2015. Data span over one entire binary orbit, and cover both X-ray\nquiescent and moderately active periods. We used Balmer emission lines to\nfollow the evolution of the circumstellar disk. We observe prominent spectral\nfeatures, like double-peaked H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ emission lines. The\nH$\\alpha$ V/R ratio significantly changes over a time scale of about one year.\nOur observations are consistent with a system observed at a large inclination\nangle ($i\\gtrsim60^{\\circ}$). The derived circumstellar disk size shows that\nthe disk evolves from a configuration that prevents accretion onto the neutron\nstar, to one that allows only moderate accretion. This is in agreement with the\ncontemporary observed X-ray activity. Our results are interpreted within the\ncontext of inefficient tidal truncation of the circumstellar disk, as expected\nfor this source's binary configuration. We derived the H$\\beta$-emitting region\nsize, which results about half of the corresponding H$\\alpha$-emitting disk,\nand constrain the luminosity class of V850 Cen as III-V, consistent with the\npreviously proposed class.}\n", "  When is keeping a memory of observations worthwhile? We use hidden Markov\nmodels to look at phase transitions that emerge when comparing state estimates\nin systems with discrete states and noisy observations. We infer the underlying\nstate of the hidden Markov models from the observations in two ways: through\nnaive observations, which take into account only the current observation, and\nthrough Bayesian filtering, which takes the history of observations into\naccount. Defining a discord order parameter to distinguish between the\ndifferent state estimates, we explore hidden Markov models with various numbers\nof states and symbols and varying transition-matrix symmetry. All behave\nsimilarly. We calculate analytically the critical point where keeping a memory\nof observations starts to pay off. A mapping between hidden Markov models and\nIsing models gives added insight into the associated phase transitions.\n", "  We utilize a multi-step modelling process to produce synthetic\ninterferometric and spectroscopic observables, which are then compared to their\nobserved counterparts. Our extensive set of interferometric observations of the\nBe star 48 Per, totaling 291 data points, were obtained at the Navy Precision\nOptical Interferometer from 2006 Nov 07 to 2006 Nov 23. Our models were further\nconstrained by comparison with contemporaneous H$\\alpha$ line spectroscopy\nobtained at the John S. Hall Telescope at Lowell Observatory on 2006 Nov 1.\nTheoretical spectral energy distributions, SEDs, for 48~Per were confirmed by\ncomparison with observations over a wavelength regime of 0.4 to 60 microns from\nTouhami et al. (2010) and Vieira et al. (2017). Our best-fitting combined model\nfrom H$\\alpha$ spectroscopy, H$\\alpha$ interferometry and SED fitting has a\npower law density fall off, $n$, of 2.3 and an initial density at the stellar\nsurface of $\\rho_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\rm{g\\,cm}^{-3}$ with a inclination\nconstrained by H$\\alpha$ spectroscopy and interferometry of 45$^{\\circ} \\pm\n5^{\\circ}$. The position angle for the system, measured east from north, is\n121$^{\\circ}$ $\\pm$ 1$^{\\circ}$. Our best-fit model shows that the disk\nemission originates in a moderately large disk with a radius of 25 R$_{*}$\nwhich is consistent with a disk mass of approximately 5 $\\times$ 10$^{24}$ g or\n3 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ M$_{*}$. Finally, we compare our results with previous\nstudies of 48~Per by Quirrenbach et al. (1997) with agreement but find, with\nour much larger data set, that our disk size contradicts the findings of Delaa\net al. (2011).\n", "  Spectroscopic studies have demonstrated that nearly all Galactic globular\nclusters (GCs) harbour multiple stellar populations with different chemical\ncompositions. Moreover, colour-magnitude diagrams based exclusively on\nStr\\\"omgrem photometry have allowed us to identify and characterise multiple\npopulations along the RGB of a large number of clusters. In this paper we show\nfor the first time that Str\\\"omgren photometry is also very effcient at\nidentifying multiple populations along the AGB, and demonstrate that the AGB of\nM3, M92, NGC362, NGC1851, and NGC6752 are not consistent with a single stellar\npopulation. We also provide a catalogue of RGB and AGB stars photometrically\nidentified in these clusters for further spectroscopic follow-up studies.We\ncombined photometry and elemental abundances from the literature for RGB and\nAGB stars in NGC6752 where the presence of multiple populations along the AGB\nhas been widely debated. We find that, while the MS, SGB, and RGB host three\nstellar populations with different helium and light element abundances, only\ntwo populations of AGB stars are present in the cluster. These results are\nconsistent with standard evolutionary theory.\n", "  We systematically investigate the thermodynamic properties of homogeneous\nnuclear matter with light clusters at low densities and finite temperatures\nusing a generalized nonlinear relativistic mean-field (gNL-RMF) model, in which\nlight clusters up to $\\alpha $ ($1 \\le A \\le 4$) are included as explicit\ndegrees of freedom and treated as point-like particles with their interactions\ndescribed by meson exchanges and the medium effects on the cluster binding\nenergies are described by density- and temperature-dependent energy shifts with\nthe parameters obtained by fitting the experimental cluster Mott densities. We\nfind that the composition of low density nuclear matter with light clusters is\nessentially determined by the density- and temperature-dependence of the\ncluster binding energy shifts. Compared with the values of the conventional\n(second-order) symmetry energy, symmetry free energy and symmetry entropy,\ntheir fourth-order values are found to be significant at low densities ($\\rho\n\\sim 10^{-3}$ fm$^{-3}$) and low temperatures ($T \\lesssim 3$ MeV), indicating\nthe invalidity of the empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetry\ndependence of these nuclear matter properties. Our results indicate that in the\ndensity region of $\\rho \\gtrsim 0.02$ fm$^{-3}$, the clustering effects become\ninsignificant and the nuclear matter is dominated by nucleon degree of freedom.\nIn addition, we compare the gNL-RMF model predictions with the corresponding\nexperimental data on the symmetry energy and symmetry free energy at low\ndensities and finite temperatures extracted from heavy-ion collisions, and\nreasonable agreement is found.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling effects occurring in non-centrosymmetric materials are\nknown to be responsible for non-trivial spin configurations and a number of\nemergent physical phenomena. Ferroelectric materials may be especially\ninteresting in this regard due to reversible spontaneous polarization making\npossible for a non-volatile electrical control of the spin degrees of freedom.\nHere, we explore a technologically relevant oxide material, HfO2, which has\nbeen shown to exhibit robust ferroelectricity in a non-centrosymmetric\northorhombic phase. Using theoretical modelling based on density-functional\ntheory, we investigate the spin-dependent electronic structure of the\nferroelectric HfO2 and demonstrate the appearance of chiral spin textures\ndriven by spin-orbit coupling. We analyze these spin configurations in terms of\nthe Rashba and Dresselhaus effects within the k.p Hamiltonian model and find\nthat the Rashba-type spin texture dominates around the valence band maximum,\nwhile the Dresselhaus-type spin texture prevails around the conduction band\nminimum. The latter is characterized by a very large Dresselhaus constant\n{\\alpha}D = 0.578 eV {\\AA}, which allows using this material as a tunnel\nbarrier to produce tunneling anomalous and spin Hall effects that are\nreversible by ferroelectric polarization.\n", "  We use data on extreme radio scintillation to demonstrate that this\nphenomenon is associated with hot stars in the solar neighbourhood. The ionized\ngas responsible for the scattering is found at distances up to 1.75pc from the\nhost star, and on average must comprise 1.E5 distinct structures per star. We\ndetect azimuthal velocities of the plasma, relative to the host star, up to 9.7\nkm/s, consistent with warm gas expanding at the sound speed. The circumstellar\nplasma structures that we infer are similar in several respects to the cometary\nknots seen in the Helix, and in other planetary nebulae. There the ionized gas\nappears as a skin around tiny molecular clumps. Our analysis suggests that\nmolecular clumps are ubiquitous circumstellar features, unrelated to the\nevolutionary state of the star. The total mass in such clumps is comparable to\nthe stellar mass.\n", "  We present a novel platform for the bottom-up construction of itinerant\nmany-body systems: ultracold atoms transferred from a Bose-Einstein condensate\ninto freely configurable arrays of micro-lens generated focused-beam dipole\ntraps. This complements traditional optical lattices and gives a new quality to\nthe field of two-dimensional quantum simulators. The ultimate control of\ntopology, well depth, atom number, and interaction strength is matched by\nsufficient tunneling. We characterize the required light fields, derive the\nBose-Hubbard parameters for several alkali species, investigate the loading\nprocedures and heating mechanisms. To demonstrate the potential of this\napproach, we analyze coupled annular Josephson contacts exhibiting many-body\nresonances.\n", "  Parity and time-reversal violating electric dipole moment (EDM) of $^{171}$Yb\nis calculated accounting for the electron correlation effects over the\nDirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method in the relativistic Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger\nmany-body perturbation theory, with the second (MBPT(2) method) and third order\n(MBPT(3) method) approximations, and two variants of all-order relativistic\nmany-body approaches, in the random phase approximation (RPA) and\ncoupled-cluster (CC) method with singles and doubles (CCSD method) framework.\nWe consider electron-nucleus tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) and nuclear Schiff\nmoment (NSM) interactions as the predominant sources that induce EDM in a\ndiamagnetic atomic system. Our results from the CCSD method to EDM ($d_a$) of\n$^{171}$Yb due to the T-PT and NSM interactions are found to be $d_a = 4.85(6)\n\\times 10^{-20} \\langle \\sigma \\rangle C_T \\ |e| \\ cm$ and $d_a=2.89(4) \\times\n10^{-17} {S/(|e|\\ fm^3)}$, respectively, where $C_T$ is the T-PT coupling\nconstant and $S$ is the NSM. These values differ significantly from the earlier\ncalculations. The reason for the same has been attributed to large correlation\neffects arising through non-RPA type of interactions among the electrons in\nthis atom that are observed by analyzing the differences in the RPA and CCSD\nresults. This has been further scrutinized from the MBPT(2) and MBPT(3) results\nand their roles have been demonstrated explicitly.\n", "  We study the observed relation between accretion rate (in terms of L/L_Edd)\nand shape of the hard X-ray spectral energy distribution (namely the photon\nindex Gamma_X) for a large sample of 228 hard X-ray selected, low-redshift\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), drawn from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey\n(BASS). This includes 30 AGN for which black hole mass (and therefore L/L_Edd)\nis measured directly through masers, spatially resolved gas or stellar\ndynamics, or reverberation mapping. The high quality and broad energy coverage\nof the data provided through BASS allow us to examine several alternative\ndeterminations of both Gamma_X and L/L_Edd. For the BASS sample as a whole, we\nfind a statistically significant, albeit very weak correlation between Gamma_X\nand L/L_Edd. The best-fitting relations we find, Gamma_X=0.15\nlog(L/L_Edd)+const., are considerably shallower than those reported in previous\nstudies. Moreover, we find no corresponding correlations among the subsets of\nAGN with different M_BH determination methodology. In particular, we find no\nrobust evidence for a correlation when considering only those AGN with direct\nor single-epoch M_BH estimates. This latter finding is in contrast to several\nprevious studies which focused on z>0.5 broad-line AGN. We discuss this tension\nand conclude that it can be partially accounted for if one adopts a simplified,\npower-law X-ray spectral model, combined with L/L_Edd estimates that are based\non the continuum emission and on single-epoch broad line spectroscopy in the\noptical regime. We finally highlight the limitations on using Gamma_X as a\nprobe of supermassive black hole evolution in deep extragalactic X-ray surveys.\n", "  We present accurate photometric redshifts for galaxies observed by the\nCluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). CLASH observed 25\nmassive galaxy cluster cores with the Hubble Space Telescope in 16 filters\nspanning 0.2 - 1.7 $\\mu$m. Photometry in such crowded fields is challenging.\nCompared to our previously released catalogs, we make several improvements to\nthe photometry, including smaller apertures, ICL subtraction, PSF matching, and\nempirically measured uncertainties. We further improve the Bayesian Photometric\nRedshift (BPZ) estimates by adding a redder elliptical template and by\ninflating the photometric uncertainties of the brightest galaxies. The\nresulting photometric redshift accuracies are dz/(1+z) $\\sim$ 0.8\\%, 1.0\\%, and\n2.0\\% for galaxies with I-band F814W AB magnitudes $<$ 18, 20, and 23,\nrespectively. These results are consistent with our expectations. They improve\non our previously reported accuracies by a factor of 4 at the bright end and a\nfactor of 2 at the faint end. Our new catalog includes 1257 spectroscopic\nredshifts, including 382 confirmed cluster members. We also provide stellar\nmass estimates. Finally, we include lensing magnification estimates of\nbackground galaxies based on our public lens models. Our new catalog of all 25\nCLASH clusters is available via MAST. The analysis techniques developed here\nwill be useful in other surveys of crowded fields, including the Frontier\nFields and surveys carried out with J-PAS and JWST.\n", "  We present mock optical images, broad-band and H$\\alpha$ fluxes, and D4000\nspectral indices for 30,145 galaxies from the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation\nat redshift $z=0.1$, modelling dust with the SKIRT Monte Carlo radiative\ntransfer code. The modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty\nstar-forming regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and\nthe fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated against\nfar-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted optical colours as a\nfunction of stellar mass agree well with observation, with the SKIRT model\nshowing marked improvement over a simple dust screen model. The orientation\ndependence of attenuation is weaker than observed because EAGLE galaxies are\ngenerally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor imposed on the\ninterstellar medium. The mock H$\\alpha$ luminosity function agrees reasonably\nwell with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust obscuration\naffects observed H$\\alpha$ fluxes. The distribution of D4000 break values is\nbimodal, as observed. In the simulation, 20$\\%$ of galaxies deemed `passive'\nfor the SKIRT model, i.e. exhibiting D4000 $> 1.8$, are classified `active'\nwhen ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of galaxies with\nstellar mass greater than $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ that are deemed passive is\nslightly smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual star\nformation in these simulated galaxies. Colour images, fluxes and spectra of\nEAGLE galaxies are to be made available through the public EAGLE database.\n", "  The scaling relations that relate the average asteroseismic parameters\n$\\Delta \\nu$ and $\\nu_{\\max}$ to the global properties of stars are used quite\nextensively to determine stellar properties. While the $\\Delta \\nu$ scaling\nrelation has been examined carefully and the deviations from the relation have\nbeen well documented, the $\\nu_{\\max}$ scaling relation has not been examined\nas extensively. In this paper we examine the $\\nu_{\\max}$ scaling relation\nusing a set of stellar models constructed to have a wide range of mass,\nmetallicity, and age. We find that as with $\\Delta \\nu$, $\\nu_{\\max}$ does not\nfollow the simple scaling relation. The most visible deviation is because of a\nmean molecular weight term and a $\\Gamma_1$ term that are commonly ignored. The\nremaining deviation is more difficult to address. We find that the influence of\nthe scaling relation errors on asteroseismically derived values of $\\log g$ are\nwell within uncertainties. The influence of the errors on mass and radius\nestimates is small for main sequence and subgiants, but can be quite large for\nred giants.\n", "  A novel scheme is proposed for dissipative generation of maximally\nentanglement between two Rydberg atoms in the context of cavity QED. The\nspontaneous emission of atoms combined with quantum Zeno dynamics and Rydberg\nantiblockade guarantees a unique steady solution of the master equation of\nsystem, which just corresponds to the antisymmetric Bell state $|S\\rangle$. The\nconvergence rate is accelerated by the ground-state blockade mechanism of\nRydberg atoms. Meanwhile the effect of cavity decay is suppressed by the Zeno\nrequirement, leading to a steady-state fidelity about $90\\%$ as the single-atom\ncooperativity parameter $C\\equiv g^2/(\\kappa\\gamma)= 10$, and this restriction\nis further relaxed to $C= 5.2$ once the quantum-jump-based feedback control is\nexploited.\n", "  We explore the electronic ground states of Bernal-stacked multilayer\ngraphenes using the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation and the\nfull-parameter band model. We find that the electron-electron interaction tends\nto open a band gap in multilayer graphenes from bilayer to 8-layer, while the\nnature of the insulating ground state sensitively depends on the band parameter\n$\\gamma_2$, which is responsible for the semimetallic nature of graphite. In\n4-layer graphene, particularly, the ground state assumes an odd-spatial-parity\nstaggered phase at $\\gamma_2 = 0$, while an increasing, finite value of\n$\\gamma_2$ stabilizes a different state with even parity, where the electrons\nare attracted to the top layer and the bottom layer. The two phases are\ntopologically distinct insulating states with different Chern numbers, and they\ncan be distinguished by spin or valley Hall conductivity measurements.\nMultilayers with more than five layers also exhibit similar ground states with\npotential minima at the outermost layers, although the opening of a gap in the\nspectrum as a whole is generally more difficult than in 4-layer because of a\nlarger number of energy bands overlapping at the Fermi energy.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly the most luminous AGN, are\ncommonly assumed to be triggered through major mergers, however observational\nevidence for this scenario is mixed. To investigate any influence of galaxy\nmergers on AGN triggering and luminosities through cosmic time, we present a\nsample of 106 luminous X-ray selected type 1 AGN from the COSMOS survey. These\nAGN occupy a large redshift range (0.5 < z < 2.2) and two orders of magnitude\nin X-ray luminosity ($\\sim$10$^{43}$ - 10$^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). AGN hosts are\ncarefully mass and redshift matched to 486 control galaxies. A novel technique\nfor identifying and quantifying merger features in galaxies is developed,\nsubtracting GALFIT galaxy models and quantifying the residuals. Comparison to\nvisual classification confirms this measure reliably picks out disturbance\nfeatures in galaxies. No enhancement of merger features with increasing AGN\nluminosity is found with this metric, or by visual inspection. We analyse the\nredshift evolution of AGN associated with galaxy mergers and find no merger\nenhancement in lower redshift bins. Contrarily, in the highest redshift bin\n(z$\\sim$2) AGN are $\\sim$4 times more likely to be in galaxies exhibiting\nevidence of morphological disturbance compared to control galaxies, at 99%\nconfidence level ($\\sim$2.4$\\sigma$) from visual inspection. Since only\n$\\sim$15% of these AGN are found to be in morphologically disturbed galaxies,\nit is implied that major mergers at high redshift make a noticeable but\nsubdominant contribution to AGN fuelling. At low redshifts other processes\ndominate and mergers become a less significant triggering mechanism.\n", "  HESS J1534-571 is a very high energy gamma-ray source that was discovered by\nthe H.E.S.S. observatory and reported as one of several new sources with a\nshell-like morphology at TeV energies, matching in size and location with the\nsupernova remnant G323.7-1.0 discovered in radio observations by the Molonglo\nGalactic Plane Survey. Many known TeV shells also show X-ray emission, however,\nno X-ray counterpart has been seen for HESS J1534-571. The detection of a new\nGeV source using data from the \\emph{Fermi} satellite that is compatible in\nextension with the radio supernova remnant and shows a very hard power-law\nspectrum ($\\frac{dN}{dE} \\propto E^{-1.35}$) is presented here, together with\nthe first broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission from this source. It is\nshown that leptonic emission is compatible with the known multiwavelength data\nand a corresponding set of physical source parameters is given. The required\ntotal energy budget in leptons is reasonable, $\\sim 1.5\\times10^{48}$ erg for a\ndistance to the object of $5$ kpc. The new GeV observations imply that a\nhadronic scenario, on the other hand, requires a cosmic ray spectrum that\ndeviates considerably from theoretical expectations of particle acceleration.\n", "  We study the radiative heat transfer between multilayer structures made by a\nperiodic repetition of a graphene sheet and a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\nslab. Surface plasmons in a monolayer graphene can couple with a hyperbolic\nphonon polaritons in a single hBN film to form hybrid polaritons that can\nassist photon tunneling. For periodic multilayer graphene/hBN structures, the\nstacked metallic/dielectric array can give rise to a further effective\nhyperbolic behavior, in addition to the intrinsic natural hyperbolic behavior\nof hBN. The effective hyperbolicity can enable more hyperbolic polaritons that\nenhance the photon tunneling and hence the near-field heat transfer. However,\nthe hybrid polaritons on the surface, i.e. surface plasmon-phonon polaritons,\ndominate the near-field heat transfer between multilayer structures when the\ntopmost layer is graphene. The effective hyperbolic regions can be well\npredicted by the effective medium theory (EMT), thought EMT fails to capture\nthe hybrid surface polaritons and results in a heat transfer rate much lower\ncompared to the exact calculation. The chemical potential of the graphene\nsheets can be tuned through electrical gating and results in an additional\nmodulation of the heat transfer. We found that the near-field heat transfer\nbetween multilayer structure does not increase monotonously with the number of\nlayer in the stack, which provides a way to control the heat transfer rate by\nthe number of graphene layers in the multilayer structure. The results may\nbenefit the applications of near-field energy harvesting and radiative cooling\nbased on hybrid polaritons in two-dimensional materials.\n", "  We describe high spectral resolution, high dynamic range integral field\nspectroscopy of IC418 covering the spectral range 3300-8950{\\AA} and compare\nwith earlier data. We determine line fluxes, derive chemical abundances,\nprovide a spectrum of the central star, and determine the shape of the nebular\ncontinuum. Using photoionisation models, we derive the reddening function from\nthe nebular continuum and recombination lines. The nebula has a very high inner\nionisation parameter. Consequently, radiation pressure dominates the gas\npressure and dust absorbs a large fraction of ionising photons. Radiation\npressure induces increasing density with radius. From a photoionisation\nanalysis we derive central star parameters; $\\log T_{\\mathrm eff} = 4.525$K,\n$\\log L_*/L_{\\odot} = 4.029$, $\\log g = 3.5$ and using stellar evolutionary\nmodels we estimate an initial mass of $2.5 < M/M_{\\odot} < 3.0$. The inner\nfilamentary shell is shocked by the rapidly increasing stellar wind ram\npressure, and we model this as an externally photoionised shock. In addition, a\nshock is driven into the pre-existing Asymptotic Giant Branch stellar wind by\nthe strong D-Type ionisation front developed at the outer boundary of the\nnebula. From the dynamics of the inner mass-loss bubble, and from stellar\nevolutionary models we infer that the nebula became ionised in the last\n$100-200$\\,yr, but evolved structurally during the $\\sim 2000$ yr since the\ncentral star evolved off the AGB. The estimated current mass loss rate ($\\dot M\n= 3.8\\times 10^{-8} M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and terminal velocity ($v_{\\infty}\n\\sim 450$ km/s) is sufficient to excite the inner mass-loss bubble. While on\nthe AGB, the central star lost mass at $\\dot M = 2.1\\times 10^{-5}\nM_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ with outflow velocity $\\sim 14$ km/s.\n", "  Nitrogen is one of the most abundant elements in the Universe and its 14N/15N\nisotopic ratio has the potential to provide information about the initial\nenvironment in which our Sun formed. Recent findings suggest that the Solar\nSystem may have formed in a massive cluster since the presence of short-lived\nradioisotopes in meteorites can only be explained by the influence of a\nsupernova. The aim of this project is to determine the 14N/15N ratio towards a\nsample of cold, massive dense cores at the initial stages in their evolution.\nWe have observed the J=1-0 transitions of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C and H15NC\ntoward a sample of 22 cores in 4 Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs). IRDCs are\nbelieved to be the precursors of high-mass stars and star clusters. Assuming\nLTE and a temperature of 15K, the column densities of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, HN13C\nand H15NC are calculated and their 14N/15N ratio is determined for each core.\nThe 14N/15N ratio measured in our sample of IRDC cores range between ~70 and\n>763 in HCN and between ~161 and ~541 in HNC. They are consistent with the\nterrestrial atmosphere (TA) and protosolar nebula (PSN) values, and with the\nratios measured in low-mass pre-stellar cores. However, the 14N/15N ratios\nmeasured in cores C1, C3, F1, F2 and G2 do not agree with the results from\nsimilar studies toward the same massive cores using nitrogen bearing molecules\nwith nitrile functional group (-CN) and nitrogen hydrides (-NH) although the\nratio spread covers a similar range. Amongst the 4 IRDCs we measured relatively\nlow 14N/15N ratios towards IRDC G which are comparable to those measured in\nsmall cosmomaterials and protoplanetary disks. The low average gas density of\nthis cloud suggests that the gas density, rather than the gas temperature, may\nbe the dominant parameter influencing the initial nitrogen isotopic composition\nin young PSN.\n", "  Characterizing the UV spectral energy distribution (SED) of an exoplanet host\nstar is critically important for assessing its planet's potential habitability,\nparticularly for M dwarfs as they are prime targets for current and near-term\nexoplanet characterization efforts and atmospheric models predict that their UV\nradiation can produce photochemistry on habitable zone planets different than\non Earth. To derive ground-based proxies for UV emission for use when Hubble\nSpace Telescope observations are unavailable, we have assembled a sample of\nfifteen early-to-mid M dwarfs observed by Hubble, and compared their\nnon-simultaneous UV and optical spectra. We find that the equivalent width of\nthe chromospheric Ca II K line at 3933 Angstroms, when corrected for spectral\ntype, can be used to estimate the stellar surface flux in ultraviolet emission\nlines, including H I Lyman alpha. In addition, we address another potential\ndriver of habitability: energetic particle fluxes associated with flares. We\npresent a new technique for estimating soft X-ray and >10 MeV proton flux\nduring far-UV emission line flares (Si IV and He II) by assuming solar-like\nenergy partitions. We analyze several flares from the M4 dwarf GJ 876 observed\nwith Hubble and Chandra as part of the MUSCLES Treasury Survey and find that\nhabitable zone planets orbiting GJ 876 are impacted by large Carrington-like\nflares with peak soft X-ray fluxes >1e-3 W m-2 and possible proton fluxes\n~100-1000 pfu, approximately four orders of magnitude more frequently than\nmodern-day Earth.\n", "  We investigate electron-correlation effects in the $g$-factor of the ground\nstate of Li-like ions. Our calculations are performed within the\nnonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics (NRQED) expansion up to two leading\norders in the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$, $\\alpha^2$ and $\\alpha^3$. The\ndependence of the NRQED results on the nuclear charge number $Z$ is studied and\nthe individual $1/Z$-expansion contributions are identified. Combining the\nobtained data with the results of the all-order (in $Z\\alpha$) calculations\nperformed within the $1/Z$ expansion, we derive the unified theoretical\npredictions for the $g$-factor of light Li-like ions.\n", "  The exploitation of high volume of geolocalized data from social sport\ntracking applications of outdoor activities can be useful for natural resource\nplanning and to understand the human mobility patterns during leisure\nactivities. This geolocalized data represents the selection of hike activities\naccording to subjective and objective factors such as personal goals, personal\nabilities, trail conditions or weather conditions. In our approach, human\nmobility patterns are analysed from trajectories which are generated by hikers.\nWe propose the generation of the trail network identifying special points in\nthe overlap of trajectories. Trail crossings and trailheads define our network\nand shape topological features. We analyse the trail network of Balearic\nIslands, as a case of study, using complex weighted network theory. The\nanalysis is divided into the four seasons of the year to observe the impact of\nweather conditions on the network topology. The number of visited places does\nnot decrease despite the large difference in the number of samples of the two\nseasons with larger and lower activity. It is in summer season where it is\nproduced the most significant variation in the frequency and localization of\nactivities from inland regions to coastal areas. Finally, we compare our model\nwith other related studies where the network possesses a different purpose. One\nfinding of our approach is the detection of regions with relevant importance\nwhere landscape interventions can be applied in function of the communities.\n", "  We develop a coordinate version of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory,\nfor general time-ordered products of fields, by carrying out integrals over one\nlight-cone coordinate for each interaction vertex. The resulting expressions\ndepend on the lengths of paths, measured in the same light-cone coordinate.\nEach path is associated with a denominator equal to a \"light-cone deficit\",\nanalogous to the \"energy deficits\" of momentum-space time- or\nlight-cone-ordered perturbation theory. In effect, the role played by\nintermediate states in momentum space is played by paths between external\nfields in coordinate space. We derive a class of identities satisfied by\ncoordinate diagrams, from which their imaginary parts can be derived. Using\nscalar QED as an example, we show how the eikonal approximation arises\nnaturally when the external points in a Green function approach the light cone,\nand we give applications to products of Wilson lines. Although much of our\ndiscussion is directed at massless fields in four dimensions, we extend the\nformalism to massive fields and dimensional regularization.\n", "  We employ the heat perturbations correlation function to study thermal\ntransport in the one-dimensional (1D) Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$\\beta$ lattice with\nboth nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. We find that such a\nsystem bears a peculiar phonon dispersion relation, and thus there exists a\ncompetition between phonon dispersion and nonlinearity that can strongly affect\nthe heat correlation function' shape and scaling property. Specifically, for\nsmall and large anharmoncity, the scaling laws are ballistic and superdiffusive\ntypes, respectively, which are in good agreement with the recent theoretical\npredictions; whereas in the intermediate range of the nonlinearity, we observe\nan unusual multiscaling property characterized by a \\emph{nonmonotonic}\ndelocalization process of the central peak of the heat correlation function. To\nunderstand this multiscaling laws, we also examine the momentum perturbations\ncorrelation function and find a transition process with the same turning point\nof the anharmonicity as that shown in the heat correlation function. This\nsuggests coupling between the momentum transport and the heat transport, in\nagreement with the theoretical arguments of mode cascade theory.\n", "  Double coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources are believed to be critical\nobservational evidence of bi-directional energy release through magnetic\nreconnection in a large-scale current sheet in solar ares. Here we present a\nstudy on double coronal sources observed in both HXR and microwave regimes,\nrevealing new characteristics distinct from earlier reports. This event is\nassociated with a footpoint-occulted X1.3-class flare (25 April 2014, starting\nat 00:17 UT) and a coronal mass ejection that are likely triggered by the\nmagnetic breakout process, with the lower source extending upward from the top\nof the partially-occulted flare loops and the upper source co-incident with\nrapidly squeezing-in side lobes (at a speed of ~250 km/s on both sides). The\nupper source can be identified at energies as high as 70-100 keV. The X-ray\nupper source is characterized by flux curves different from the lower source, a\nweak energy dependence of projected centroid altitude above 20 keV, a shorter\nduration and a HXR photon spectrum slightly-harder than those of the lower\nsource. In addition, the microwave emission at 34 GHz also exhibits a similar\ndouble source structure and the microwave spectra at both sources are in line\nwith gyro-synchrotron emission given by non- thermal energetic electrons. These\nobservations, especially the co-incidence of the very-fast squeezing-in motion\nof side lobes and the upper source, indicate that the upper source is\nassociated with (possibly caused by) this fast motion of arcades. This sheds\nnew lights on the origin of the corona double-source structure observed in both\nHXRs and microwaves.\n", "  Analysis of the statistical properties of exoplanets, together with those of\ntheir host stars, are providing a unique view into the process of planet\nformation and evolution. In this paper we explore the properties of the mass\ndistribution of giant planet companions to solar-type stars, in a quest for\nclues about their formation process. With this goal in mind we studied, with\nthe help of standard statistical tests, the mass distribution of giant planets\nusing data from the exoplanet.eu catalog and the SWEET-Cat database of stellar\nparameters for stars with planets. We show that the mass distribution of giant\nplanet companions is likely to present more than one population with a change\nin regime around 4\\,M$_{Jup}$. Above this value host stars tend to be more\nmetal poor and more massive and have [Fe/H] distributions that are\nstatistically similar to those observed in field stars of similar mass. On the\nother hand, stars that host planets below this limit show the well-known\nmetallicity-giant planet frequency correlation. We discuss these results in\nlight of various planet formation models and explore the implications they may\nhave on our understanding of the formation of giant planets. In particular, we\ndiscuss the possibility that the existence of two separate populations of giant\nplanets indicates that two different processes of formation are at play.\n", "  Under Newtonian gravity total masses for dSph galaxies will scale as $M_{T}\n\\propto R_{e} \\sigma^{2}$, with $R_{e}$ the effective radius and $\\sigma$ their\nvelocity dispersion. When both of the above quantities are available, the\nresulting masses are compared to observed stellar luminosities to derive\nNewtonian mass to light ratios, given a physically motivated proportionality\nconstant in the above expression. For local dSphs and the growing sample of\nultrafaint such systems, the above results in the largest mass to light ratios\nof any galactic systems known, with values in the hundreds and even thousands\nbeing common. The standard interpretation is for a dominant presence of an as\nyet undetected dark matter component. If however, reality is closer to a\nMONDian theory at the extremely low accelerations relevant to such systems,\n$\\sigma$ will scale with { stellar mass} $M_{*}^{1/4}$. This yields an\nexpression for the mass to light ratio which will be obtained under Newtonian\nassumptions of $(M/L)_{N}=120 R_{e}(\\Upsilon_{*}/L)^{1/2}$. Here we compare\n$(M/L)_{N}$ values from this expression to Newtonian inferences for this ratios\nfor the actual $(R_{e}, \\sigma, L)$ observed values for a sample of recently\nobserved ultrafaint dSphs, obtaining good agreement. Then, for systems where no\n$\\sigma$ values have been reported, we give predictions for the $(M/L)_{N}$\nvalues which under a MONDian scheme are expected once kinematical observations\nbecome available. For the recently studied Dragonfly 44 { and Crater II\nsystems}, reported $(M/L)_{N}$ values are also in good agreement with MONDian\nexpectations.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries with a $\\delta$ Sct component are powerful tools to derive\nthe fundamental parameters and probe the internal structure of stars. In this\nstudy, spectral analysis of 6 primary $\\delta$ Sct components in eclipsing\nbinaries has been performed. Values of $T_{\\rm eff}$, $v \\sin i$, and\nmetallicity for the stars have been derived from medium-resolution\nspectroscopy. Additionally, a revised list of $\\delta$ Sct stars in eclipsing\nbinaries is presented. In this list, we have only given the $\\delta$ Sct stars\nin eclipsing binaries to show the effects of the secondary components and\ntidal-locking on the pulsations of primary $\\delta$ Sct components. The stellar\npulsation, atmospheric and fundamental parameters (e.g., mass, radius) of 92\n$\\delta$ Sct stars in eclipsing binaries have been gathered. Comparison of the\nproperties of single and eclipsing binary member $\\delta$ Sct stars has been\nmade. We find that single $\\delta$ Sct stars pulsate in longer periods and with\nhigher amplitudes than the primary $\\delta$ Sct components in eclipsing\nbinaries. The $v \\sin i$ of $\\delta$ Sct components is found to be\nsignificantly lower than that of single $\\delta$ Sct stars. Relationships\nbetween the pulsation periods, amplitudes, and stellar parameters in our list\nhave been examined. Significant correlations between the pulsation periods and\nthe orbital periods, $T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, radius, mass ratio, $v \\sin i$,\nand the filling factor have been found.\n", "  The ability to engineer the thermal conductivity of materials allows us to\ncontrol the flow of heat and derive novel functionalities such as thermal\nrectification, thermal switching, and thermal cloaking. While this could be\nachieved by making use of composites and metamaterials at bulk scales,\nengineering the thermal conductivity at micro- and nano-scale dimensions is\nconsiderably more challenging. In this work we show that the local thermal\nconductivity along a single Si nanowire can be tuned to a desired value\n(between crystalline and amorphous limits) with high spatial resolution through\nselective helium ion irradiation with a well-controlled dose. The underlying\nmechanism is understood through molecular dynamics simulations and quantitative\nphonon-defect scattering rate analysis, where the behavior of thermal\nconductivity with dose is attributed to the accumulation and agglomeration of\nscattering centers at lower doses. Beyond a threshold dose, a\ncrystalline-amorphous transition was observed.\n", "  We use the Gemini Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) to map the\nstellar kinematics of the inner few hundred parsecs of a sample of 16 nearby\nSeyfert galaxies, at a spatial resolution of tens of parsecs and spectral\nresolution of 40 km/s. We find that the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity fields for\nmost galaxies are well reproduced by rotating disk models. The kinematic\nposition angle (PA) derived for the LOS velocity field is consistent with the\nlarge scale photometric PA. The residual velocities are correlated with the\nhard X-ray luminosity, suggesting that more luminous AGN have a larger impact\nin the surrounding stellar dynamics. The central velocity dispersion values are\nusually higher than the rotation velocity amplitude, what we attribute to the\nstrong contribution of bulge kinematics in these inner regions. For 50% of the\ngalaxies, we find an inverse correlation between the velocities and the $h_3$\nGauss-Hermitte moment, implying red wings in the blueshifted side and blue\nwings in the redshifted side of the velocity field, attributed to the movement\nof the bulge stars lagging the rotation. Two of the 16 galaxies (NGC 5899 and\nMrk 1066) show an S-shape zero velocity line, attributed to the gravitational\npotential of a nuclear bar. Velocity dispersion maps show rings of low-$\\sigma$\nvalues (50-80 km/s) for 4 objects and \"patches\" of low-sigma for 6 galaxies at\n150-250 pc from the nucleus, attributed to young/ intermediate age stellar\npopulations.\n", "  We present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy data obtained with\nVLT/SINFONI of \"the Teacup galaxy\". The nuclear K-band (1.95-2.45 micron)\nspectrum of this radio-quiet type-2 quasar reveals a blueshifted broad\ncomponent of FWHM~1600-1800 km/s in the hydrogen recombination lines\n(Pa$\\alpha$, Br$\\delta$, and Br$\\gamma$) and also in the coronal line [Si\nVI]$\\lambda$1.963 micron. Thus the data confirm the presence of the nuclear\nionized outflow previously detected in the optical and reveal its coronal\ncounterpart. Both the ionized and coronal nuclear outflows are resolved, with\nseeing-deconvolved full widths at half maximum of 1.1$\\pm$0.1 and 0.9$\\pm$0.1\nkpc along PA$\\sim$72-74 deg. This orientation is almost coincident with the\nradio axis (PA=77 deg), suggesting that the radio jet could have triggered the\nnuclear outflow. In the case of the H$_2$ lines we do not require a broad\ncomponent to reproduce the profiles, but the narrow lines are blueshifted by\n~50 km/s on average from the galaxy systemic velocity. This could be an\nindication of the presence of a nuclear molecular outflow, although the bulk of\nthe H$_2$ emission in the inner ~2 arcsec (~3 kpc) of the galaxy follows a\nrotation pattern. We find evidence for kinematically disrupted gas (FWHM>250\nkm/s) at up to 5.6 kpc from the AGN, which can be naturally explained by the\naction of the outflow. The narrow component of [Si VI] is redshifted with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, unlike any other emission line in the K-band\nspectrum. This indicates that the region where the coronal lines are produced\nis not co-spatial with the narrow line region.\n", "  We present optical, near- and mid-infrared imaging of the host galaxy of FRB\n121102 with the Gemini North telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. The FRB 121102 host galaxy is resolved, revealing a\nbright star forming region located in the outskirts of the irregular,\nlow-metallicity dwarf galaxy. The star forming region has a half-light radius\nof 0.68 kpc (0.20 arcsec), encompassing the projected location of the compact\n(<0.7 pc), persistent radio source that is associated with FRB 121102. The\nhalf-light diameter of the dwarf galaxy is 5 to 7 kpc, and broadband spectral\nenergy distribution fitting indicates that it has a total stellar mass of\nM*~10^8 Msun. The metallicity of the host galaxy is low, 12+log10\n([O/H])=8.0+-0.1. The properties of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 are\ncomparable to those of extreme emission line galaxies, also known to host\nhydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The\nprojected location of FRB 121102 within the star forming region supports the\nproposed connection of FRBs with newly born neutron stars or magnetars.\n", "  Recent observations have revealed the eccentricity and inclination\ndistributions of close-in super-Earths. These distributions have the potential\nto constrain their formation processes. In the in-situ formation scenario, the\neccentricities and inclinations of planets are determined by gravitational\nscattering and collisions between protoplanets on the giant impact stage. We\ninvestigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of\nprotoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths. We perform $N$-body\nsimulations of protoplanets in gas-free disks, changing the initial\neccentricities and inclinations systematically. We find that while the\neccentricities of protoplanets are well relaxed through their evolution, the\ninclinations are not. When the initial inclinations are small, they are not\ngenerally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur\nimmediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the initial\ninclinations are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is\nless effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their\nnumber, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are\naffected by the initial inclinations of protoplanets.\n", "  NGC 1980 is a young cluster that is located about 0.5 degrees south of the\nOrion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Recent studies by Bouy et al. and Pillitteri et al.\nhave suggested that NGC 1980 contains an older population of stars compared to\na much younger ONC, and that it belongs to a foreground population that may be\nlocated in front of the Orion A molecular gas by as much as 40 pc. In this work\nwe present low-resolution spectra towards 148 young stars found towards the NGC\n1980 region. We determine the spectral types of these stars, examine accretion\nsignatures and measure the extinction towards them. We determine that based on\nthese observations, the age of the population of NGC 1980 is indistinguishable\nfrom L1641, estimated to be ~3 Myr, comparable with the study by Fang et al.\n", "  The abundance of metals in galaxies is a key parameter which permits to\ndistinguish between different galaxy formation and evolution models. Most of\nthe metallicity determinations are based on optical line ratios. However, the\noptical spectral range is subject to dust extinction and, for high-z objects (z\n> 3), some of the lines used in optical metallicity diagnostics are shifted to\nwavelengths not accessible to ground based observatories. For this reason, we\nexplore metallicity diagnostics using far-infrared (IR) line ratios which can\nprovide a suitable alternative in such situations. To investigate these far-IR\nline ratios, we modeled the emission of a starburst with the photoionization\ncode CLOUDY. The most sensitive far-IR ratios to measure metallicities are the\n[OIII]52$\\mu$m and 88$\\mu$m to [NIII]57$\\mu$m ratios. We show that this ratio\nproduces robust metallicities in the presence of an AGN and is insensitive to\nchanges in the age of the ionizing stellar. Another metallicity sensitive ratio\nis the [OIII]88$\\mu$m/[NII]122$\\mu$m ratio, although it depends on the\nionization parameter. We propose various mid- and far-IR line ratios to break\nthis dependency. Finally, we apply these far-IR diagnostics to a sample of 19\nlocal ultraluminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) observed with Herschel and Spitzer. We\nfind that the gas-phase metallicity in these local ULIRGs is in the range 0.7 <\nZ_gas/Z_sun < 1.5, which corresponds to 8.5 < 12 + log (O/H) < 8.9. The\ninferred metallicities agree well with previous estimates for local ULIRGs and\nthis confirms that they lie below the local mass-metallicity relation.\n", "  DH Tau is a young ($\\sim$1 Myr) classical T Tauri star. It is one of the few\nyoung PMS stars known to be associated with a planetary mass companion, DH Tau\nb, orbiting at large separation and detected by direct imaging. DH Tau b is\nthought to be accreting based on copious H${\\alpha}$ emission and exhibits\nvariable Paschen Beta emission. NOEMA observations at 230 GHz allow us to place\nconstraints on the disk dust mass for both DH Tau b and the primary in a regime\nwhere the disks will appear optically thin. We estimate a disk dust mass for\nthe primary, DH Tau A of $17.2\\pm1.7\\,M_{\\oplus}$, which gives a disk-to-star\nmass ratio of 0.014 (assuming the usual Gas-to-Dust mass ratio of 100 in the\ndisk). We find a conservative disk dust mass upper limit of 0.42$M_{\\oplus}$\nfor DH Tau b, assuming that the disk temperature is dominated by irradiation\nfrom DH Tau b itself. Given the environment of the circumplanetary disk,\nvariable illumination from the primary or the equilibrium temperature of the\nsurrounding cloud would lead to even lower disk mass estimates. A MCFOST\nradiative transfer model including heating of the circumplanetary disk by DH\nTau b and DH Tau A suggests that a mass averaged disk temperature of 22 K is\nmore realistic, resulting in a dust disk mass upper limit of 0.09$M_{\\oplus}$\nfor DH Tau b. We place DH Tau b in context with similar objects and discuss the\nconsequences for planet formation models.\n", "  The radio galaxy 0402+379 is believed to host a supermassive black hole\nbinary (SMBHB). The two compact core sources are separated by a projected\ndistance of 7.3 pc, making it the most (spatially) compact resolved SMBHB\nknown. We present new multi-frequency VLBI observations of 0402+379 at 5, 8, 15\nand 22 GHz, and combine with previous observations spanning 12 years. A strong\nfrequency dependent core shift is evident, which we use to infer magnetic\nfields near the jet base. After correcting for these shifts we detect\nsignificant relative motion of the two cores at $\\beta=v/c=0.0054 \\pm 0.0003$\nat $PA= -34.4^\\circ$. With some assumptions about the orbit, we use this\nmeasurement to constrain the orbital period $P\\approx 3 \\times 10^4$ y and\nSMBHB mass $M \\approx 15 \\times 10^9\\ M_\\odot$. While additional observations\nare needed to confirm this motion and obtain a precise orbit, this is\napparently the first black hole system resolved as a visual binary.\n", "  Previous works show that a correlation among radio luminosity, X-ray\nluminosity, and black hole (BH) mass from stellar-mass BHs in X-ray binaries to\nsupermassive BHs in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which leads to the so-called\nfundamental plane of BH activity. However, there are two competing explanations\nfor this fundamental plane, including the jet-dominated model and the disk-jet\nmodel. Thus, the physical origin of this fundamental plane remains unknown. In\nthis paper, we show that the X-ray luminosities, radio luminosities and BH\nmasses of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and M82 X-1 also show a similar distribution.\nThe universal scaling law among stellar-mass, intermediate and supermassive BH\nsystems, together with the fact that radio and X-ray emission of GRBs\noriginates from relativistic jets, reveals that the fundamental plane of BH\nactivity is controlled by a jet, i.e., the radio and X-ray emission is mainly\nfrom the jet. Our work also suggests that the jets are scale-invariant with\nrespect to the BH mass.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional imperfect attractive Fermi and repulsive Bose\ngases consisting of spinless point particles whose total interparticle\ninteraction energy is represented by $a N^2/2 V$ with $a=-a_{F}\\leq 0$ for\nfermions, and $a=a_{B}\\geq 0$ for bosons. We show that in spite of the\nattraction the thermodynamics of $d=2$ imperfect Fermi gas remains well defined\nfor $0 \\leq a_{F}\\leq a_{0}=h^2/2\\pi m$, and is exactly the same as the one of\nthe repulsive imperfect Bose gas with $a_{B}=a_{0}-a_{F}$. In particular, for\n$a_{F}=a_{0}$ one observes the thermodynamic equivalence of the attractive\nimperfect Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas.\n", "  The optical excess in the spectra of dim isolated neutron stars (XDINs) is a\nsignificant fraction of their rotational energy loss-rate. This is strikingly\ndifferent from the situation in isolated radio pulsars. We investigate this\nproblem in the framework of the fallback disc model. The optical spectra can be\npowered by magnetic stresses on the innermost disc matter, as the energy\ndissipated is emitted as blackbody radiation mainly from the inner rim of the\ndisc. In the fallback disc model, XDINs are the sources evolving in the\npropeller phase with similar torque mechanisms. In this this model, the ratio\nof the total magnetic work that heats up the inner disc matter is expected to\nbe similar for different XDINs. Optical luminosities that are calculated\nconsistently with the the optical spectra and the theoretical constraints on\nthe inner disc radii give very similar ratios of the optical luminosity to the\nrotational energy loss rate for all these sources. These ratios indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of the magnetic torque heats up the disc matter while the\nremaining fraction expels disc matter from the system. For XDINs, the\ncontribution of heating by X-ray irradiation to the optical luminosity is\nnegligible in comparison with the magnetic heating. The correlation we expect\nbetween the optical luminosities and the rotational energy loss-rates of XDINs\ncan be a property of the systems with low X-ray luminosities, in particular\nthose in the propeller phase.\n", "  We developed a new analytical experimental setup called AROMA (Astrochemistry\nResearch of Organics with Molecular Analyzer) that combines laser\ndesorption/ionization techniques with ion trap mass spectrometry. We report\nhere on the ability of the apparatus to detect aromatic species in complex\nmaterials of astrophysical interests and characterize their structures. A limit\nof detection of 100 femto-grams has been achieved using pure polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) samples, which corresponds to 2x10^8 molecules in\nthe case of coronene (C24H12). We detected the PAH distribution in the\nMurchison meteorite, which is made of a complex mixture of extraterrestrial\norganic compounds. In addition, collision induced dissociation experiments were\nperformed on selected species detected in Murchison, which led to the first\nfirm identification of pyrene and its methylated derivatives in this sample.\n", "  In addition to its relevant astrophysical and cosmological significance, the\nExtragalactic Background Light (EBL) is a fundamental source of opacity for\ncosmic high energy photons, as well as a limitation for the propagation of\nhigh-energy particles in the Universe. We review our previously published\ndeterminations of the EBL photon density in the Universe and its evolution with\ncosmic time, in the light of recent surveys of IR sources at long wavelengths.\nWe exploit deep survey observations by the Herschel Space Observatory and the\nSpitzer telescope, matched to optical and near-IR photometric and spectroscopic\ndata, to re-estimate number counts and luminosity functions longwards of a few\nmicrons, and the contribution of resolved sources to the EBL. These new data\nindicate slightly lower photon densities in the mid- and far-infrared and\nsub-millimeter compared to previous determinations. This implies slightly lower\ncosmic opacity for photon-photon interactions. The new data do not modify\npreviously published EBL modeling in the UV-optical and near-IR up to several\nmicrons, while reducing the photon density at longer wavelengths. This improved\nmodel of the EBL alleviates some tension that had emerged in the interpretation\nof the highest-energy TeV observations of local \\textit{blazar}s, reducing the\ncase for new physics beyond the standard model (like violations of the Lorenz\nInvariance, LIV, at the highest particle energies), or for exotic astrophysics,\nthat had sometimes been called for to explain it. Applications of this improved\nEBL model on current data are considered, as well as perspectives for future\ninstrumentation, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) in particular.\n", "  Rotational shear in Sun-like stars is thought to be an important ingredient\nin models of stellar dynamos. Thanks to helioseismology, rotation in the Sun is\ncharacterized well, but the interior rotation profiles of other Sun-like stars\nare not so well constrained. Until recently, measurements of rotation in\nSun-like stars have focused on the mean rotation, but little progress has been\nmade on measuring or even placing limits on differential rotation. Using\nasteroseismic measurements of rotation we aim to constrain the radial shear in\nfive Sun-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission: KIC004914923,\nKIC005184732, KIC006116048, KIC006933899, and KIC010963065. We used stellar\nstructure models for these five stars from previous works. These models provide\nthe mass density, mode eigenfunctions, and the convection zone depth, which we\nused to compute the sensitivity kernels for the rotational frequency splitting\nof the modes. We used these kernels as weights in a parametric model of the\nstellar rotation profile of each star, where we allowed different rotation\nrates for the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This parametric\nmodel was incorporated into a fit to the oscillation power spectrum of each of\nthe five Kepler stars. This fit included a prior on the rotation of the\nenvelope, estimated from the rotation of surface magnetic activity measured\nfrom the photometric variability. The asteroseismic measurements without the\napplication of priors are unable to place meaningful limits on the radial\nshear. Using a prior on the envelope rotation enables us to constrain the\ninterior rotation rate and thus the radial shear. In the five cases that we\nstudied, the interior rotation rate does not differ from the envelope by more\nthan approximately +/-30%. Uncertainties in the rotational splittings are too\nlarge to unambiguously determine the sign of the radial shear.\n", "  We model the star formation relation of molecular clumps in dependence of\ntheir dense-gas mass when their volume density profile is that of an isothermal\nsphere, i.e. $\\rho_{clump}(r) \\propto r^{-2}$. Dense gas is defined as gas\nwhose volume density is higher than a threshold\n$\\rho_{th}=700\\,M_{\\odot}.pc^{-3}$, i.e. HCN(1-0)-mapped gas. We divide the\nclump into two regions: a dense inner region (where $\\rho_{clump}(r) \\geq\n\\rho_{th}$), and low-density outskirts (where $\\rho_{clump}(r) < \\rho_{th}$).\nWe find that the total star formation rate of clumps scales linearly with the\nmass of their dense inner region, even when more than half of the clump star\nformation activity takes place in the low-density outskirts. We therefore\nemphasize that a linear star formation relation does not necessarily imply that\nstar formation takes place exclusively in the gas whose mass is given by the\nstar formation relation. The linearity of the star formation relation is\nstrengthened when we account for the mass of dense fragments (e.g. cores,\nfibers) seeding star formation in the low-density outskirts, and which our\nadopted clump density profile $\\rho_{clump}(r)$ does not resolve. We also find\nthat the star formation relation is significantly tighter when considering the\ndense gas than when considering all the clump gas, as observed for molecular\nclouds of the Galactic plane. When the clumps have no low-density outskirts\n(i.e. they consist of dense gas only), the star formation relation becomes\nsuperlinear and progressively wider.\n", "  We present a derivation of generalized Poisson-Boltzmann equations starting\n{from} classical theories of binary fluid mixtures, employing an approach based\non the Legendre transform as recently applied to the case of local descriptions\nof the fluid free energy. Under specific symmetry assumptions, and in the\nlinearized regime, the Poisson-Boltzmann equation reduces to a phenomenological\nequation introduced by (Bazant et al., 2011), whereby the structuring near the\nsurface is determined by bulk coefficients.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to try to explain the physical origin of the\nnon-thermal electron distribution that is able to form the enhanced intensities\nof satellite lines in the X-ray line spectra observed during the impulsive\nphases of some solar flares. Synthetic X-ray line spectra of the distributions\ncomposed of the distribution of shock reflected electrons and the background\nMaxwellian distribution are calculated in the approximation of non-Maxwellian\nionization, recombination, excitation and de-excitation rates. The distribution\nof shock reflected electrons is determined analytically. We found that the\ndistribution of electrons reflected at the nearly-perpendicular shock\nresembles, at its high-energy part, the so called n-distribution. Therefore it\ncould be able to explain the enhanced intensities of Si XIId satellite lines.\nHowever, in the region immediately in front of the shock its effect is small\nbecause electrons in background Maxwellian plasma are much more numerous there.\nTherefore, we propose a model in which the shock reflected electrons propagate\nto regions with smaller densities and different temperatures. Combining the\ndistribution of the shock-reflected electrons with the Maxwellian distribution\nhaving different densities and temperatures we found that spectra with enhanced\nintensities of the satellite lines are formed at low densities and temperatures\nof the background plasma when the combined distribution is very similar to the\nn-distribution also in its low-energy part. In these cases, the distribution of\nthe shock-reflected electrons controls the intensity ratio of the allowed Si\nXIII and Si XIV lines to the Si XIId satellite lines. The high electron\ndensities of the background plasma reduce the effect of shock-reflected\nelectrons on the composed electron distribution function, which leads to the\nMaxwellian spectra.\n", "  We update the leading order in $\\alpha_s$ QCD amplitude for deep exclusive\nneutrino and antineutrino production of a light meson on an unpolarized\nnucleon. The factorization theorems of the collinear QCD approach allow us to\nwrite the amplitude as the convolution of generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs) and perturbatively calculable coefficient functions. We study both the\npseudoscalar meson and longitudinally polarized vector meson cases. It turns\nout that, contrarily to the electroproduction case, the leading twist\nscattering amplitudes for $\\pi$ and $\\rho_L$ productions are proportional to\none another, which may serve as an interesting new test of the leading twist\ndominance of exclusive processes at medium scale. The dominance of the gluonic\ncontribution to most cross sections is stressed.\n", "  We present the first in a series of papers in T$h$e role of $E$nvironment in\nshaping $L$ow-mass $E$arly-type $N$earby g$a$laxies (hELENa) project. In this\npaper we combine our sample of 20 low-mass early types (dEs) with 258 massive\nearly types (ETGs) from the ATLAS$^{\\mathrm{3D}}$ survey - all observed with\nthe SAURON integral field unit (IFU) - to investigate early-type galaxies'\nstellar population scaling relations and the dependence of the population\nproperties on local environment, extended to the low-{\\sigma} regime of dEs.\nThe ages in our sample show more scatter at lower {\\sigma} values, indicative\nof less massive galaxies being affected by the environment to a higher degree.\nThe shape of the age-{\\sigma} relation for cluster vs. non-cluster galaxies\nsuggests that cluster environment speeds up the placing of galaxies on the red\nsequence. While the scaling relations are tighter for cluster than for the\nfield/group objects, we find no evidence for a difference in average population\ncharacteristics of the two samples. We investigate the properties of our sample\nin the Virgo cluster as a function of number density (rather than simple\nclustrocentric distance) and find that dE ages negatively correlate with the\nlocal density, likely because galaxies in regions of lower density are later\narrivals to the cluster or have experienced less pre-processing in groups, and\nconsequently used up their gas reservoir more recently. Overall, dE properties\ncorrelate more strongly with density than those of massive ETGs, which was\nexpected as less massive galaxies are more susceptible to external influences.\n", "  Understanding the evolution of the Milky Way calls for the precise abundance\ndetermination of many elements in many stars. A common perception is that\nderiving more than a few elemental abundances ([Fe/H], [$\\alpha$/Fe], perhaps\n[C/H], [N/H]) requires medium-to-high spectral resolution, $R \\gtrsim 10,000$,\nmostly to overcome the effects of line blending. In recent work (Rix et al.\n2016; Ting et al. 2016) we presented an efficient and practical way to model\nthe full stellar spectrum, even when fitting a large number of stellar labels\nsimultaneously. In this paper we quantify to what precision the abundances of\nmany different elements can be recovered, as a function of spectroscopic\nresolution and wavelength range. In the limit of perfect spectral models and\nspectral normalization, we show that the precision of elemental abundances is\nnearly independent of resolution, for a fixed exposure time and number of\ndetector pixels; low-resolution spectra simply afford much higher S/N per pixel\nand generally larger wavelength range in a single setting. We also show that\nestimates of most stellar labels are not strongly correlated with one another\nonce $R \\gtrsim 1,000$. Modest errors in the line spread function, as well as\nsmall radial velocity errors, do not affect these conclusions, and data driven\nmodels indicate that spectral (continuum) normalization can be achieved well\nenough in practice. These results, to be confirmed with an analysis of observed\nlow-resolution data, open up new possibilities for the design of large\nspectroscopic stellar surveys and for the re-analysis of archival\nlow-resolution datasets.\n", "  As part of the astrometric Hubble Space Telescope (HST) large program\nGO-12911, we conduct an in-depth study to characterize the point spread\nfunction (PSF) of the Uv-VISual channel (UVIS) of the Wide Field Camera 3\n(WFC3), as a necessary step to achieve the astrometric goals of the program. We\nextracted a PSF from each of the 589 deep exposures taken through the F467M\nfilter over the course of a year and find that the vast majority of the PSFs\nlie along a one-dimensional locus that stretches continuously from one side of\nfocus, through optimal focus, to the other side of focus. We constructed a\nfocus-diverse set of PSFs and find that with only five medium-bright stars in\nan exposure it is possible to pin down the focus level of that exposure. We\nshow that the focus-optimized PSF does a considerably better job fitting stars\nthan the average \"library\" PSF, especially when the PSF is out of focus. The\nfluxes and positions are significantly improved over the \"library\" PSF\ntreatment. These results are beneficial for a much broader range of scientific\napplications than simply the program at hand, but the immediate use of these\nPSFs will enable us to search for astrometric wobble in the bright stars in the\ncore of the globular cluster M4, which would indicate a dark, high-mass\ncompanion, such as a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.\n", "  In Tombesi et al. (2015), we reported the first direct evidence for a quasar\naccretion disk wind driving a massive molecular outflow. The target was\nF11119+3257, an ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) with unambiguous type-1\nquasar optical broad emission lines. The energetics of the accretion disk wind\nand molecular outflow were found to be consistent with the predictions of\nquasar feedback models where the molecular outflow is driven by a hot\nenergy-conserving bubble inflated by the inner quasar accretion disk wind.\nHowever, this conclusion was uncertain because the energetics were estimated\nfrom the optically thick OH 119 um transition profile observed with Herschel.\nHere, we independently confirm the presence of the molecular outflow in\nF11119+3257, based on the detection of broad wings in the CO(1-0) profile\nderived from ALMA observations. The broad CO(1-0) line emission appears to be\nspatially extended on a scale of at least ~7 kpc from the center. Mass outflow\nrate, momentum flux, and mechanical power of (80-200) R_7^{-1} M_sun/yr,\n(1.5-3.0) R_7^{-1} L_AGN/c, and (0.15-0.40)% R_7^{-1} L_AGN are inferred from\nthese data, assuming a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor appropriate for a ULIRG (R_7\nis the radius of the outflow normalized to 7 kpc and L_AGN is the AGN\nluminosity). These rates are time-averaged over a flow time scale of 7x10^6\nyrs. They are similar to the OH-based rates time-averaged over a flow time\nscale of 4x10^5 yrs, but about a factor 4 smaller than the local\n(\"instantaneous\"; <10^5 yrs) OH-based estimates cited in Tombesi et al. The\nimplications of these new results are discussed in the context of time-variable\nquasar-mode feedback and galaxy evolution. The need for an energy-conserving\nbubble to explain the molecular outflow is also re-examined.\n", "  Located at ~2pc, the L7.5+T0.5 dwarfs system WISE J104915.57-531906.1\n(Luhman16AB) is the third closest system known to Earth, making it a key\nbenchmark for detailed investigation of brown dwarf atmospheric properties,\nthermal evolution, multiplicity, and planet-hosting frequency. In the first\nstudy of this series -- based on a multi-cycle Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nprogram -- we provide an overview of the project and present improved estimates\nof positions, proper motions, annual parallax, mass ratio, and the current best\nassessment of the orbital parameters of the A-B pair. Our HST observations\nencompass the apparent periastron of the binary at 220.5+/-0.2 mas at epoch\n2016.402. Although our data seem to be inconsistent with recent ground-based\nastrometric measurements, we also exclude the presence of third bodies down to\nNeptune masses and periods longer than a year.\n", "  We perform a classification of the Lie and Noether point symmetries for the\nKlein-Gordon and for the wave equation in pp-wave spacetimes. To perform this\nanalysis we reduce the problem of the determination of the point symmetries to\nthe problem of existence of conformal killing vectors on the pp-wave\nspacetimes. We use the existing results of the literature for the isometry\nclasses of the pp-wave spacetimes and we determine in each class the functional\nform of the potential in which the Klein-Gordon equation admits point\nsymmetries and Noetherian conservation law. Finally we derive the point\nsymmetries of the wave equation and we find that the maximum Noether algebra\nhas dimension seven, that is the case of plane wave spacetimes.\n", "  In order to resolve and characterize anisotropy in turbulent plasma flows a\nproper estimation of the background magnetic field is crucially important.\nVarious approaches to calculate the background magnetic fields, ranging from\nlocal fields to globally averaged fields, are commonly used in the analysis of\nturbulent data. Here we investigate how the uncertainty in the orientation of a\nscale dependent background magnetic field influences the ability to resolve\nanisotropy. Therefore we introduce a quantitative measure, the angle\nuncertainty, which characterizes the uncertainty of the orientation of the\nbackground magnetic field which turbulent structures are exposed to. The angle\nuncertainty can be used as a condition to estimate the ability to resolve\nanisotropy with certain accuracy. We apply our description to resolve spectral\nanisotropy in fast solar wind data. We show that if the angle uncertainty grows\ntoo large, the power of the turbulent fluctuations is attributed to false local\nmagnetic field angles, which may lead to an incorrect estimation of spectral\nindices. In our results an apparent robustness of the spectral anisotropy to\nfalse local magnetic field angles is observed, which can be explained by a\nstronger increase of power for lower frequencies when the scale of the local\nmagnetic field is increased. The frequency dependent angle uncertainty is a\nmeasure which can be applied to any turbulent system.\n", "  High-energy neutrinos are expected to originate from different stages in a\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) event. In this work we revisit the dissipative\nphotospheric scenario, in which the GRB prompt emission is produced around the\nphotospheric radius. Meanwhile, possible dissipation mechanisms (e.g., internal\nshocks or magnetic reconnection) could accelerate cosmic-rays (CRs) to\nultra-high energies and then produce neutrinos via hadronuclear and\nphotohadronic processes, which are referred to as prompt neutrinos. In this\npaper, we obtain the prompt neutrino spectrum of a single GRB within a\nself-consistent analytical framework, in which the jet-cocoon structure and\npossible collimation effects are included. We investigate a possible neutrino\nsignal from the cocoon, which has been ignored in the previous studies. We show\nthat if a GRB event happens at a distance of the order of Mpc, there is a great\nchance to observe the neutrino emission from the cocoon by IceCube, which is\neven more promising than jet neutrinos since the opening angle of the cocoon is\nmuch larger. We also figure out the diffuse neutrino flux of GRB cocoons and\nfind that it could be comparable with that of the jets. Our results are\nconsistent with the latest result reported by the IceCube collaboration that no\nsignificant correlation between neutrino events and observed GRBs is seen in\nthe new data (Aartsen et al. 2017).\n", "  We investigate the relationship between the MgII $\\lambda2798$ emission-line\nand the 3000 {\\AA} continuum variations using a sample of 68\nintermediate-redshift ($z\\sim$ 0.65$-$1.50) broad-line quasars spanning a\nbolometric luminosity range of 44.49 erg s$^{-1} \\leq \\rm{log}$$L_{\\rm{bol}}\n\\leq 46.31$ erg s$^{-1}$ (Eddington ratio from $\\sim$ 0.026 to 0.862). This\nsample is constructed from SDSS-DR7Q and BOSS-DR12Q, each with at least 2\nspectroscopic epochs in SDSS-I/II/III surveys. Additionally, we adopt the\nfollowing signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) selection criteria: a) for MgII and the\n3000 {\\AA} continuum, S/N $\\geq$ 10; b) for narrow lines, S/N $\\geq$ 5. All our\nquasar spectra are recalibrated based on the assumption of constant narrow\nemission-line fluxes. In an analysis of spectrum-to-spectrum variations, we\nfind a fairly close correlation (Spearman $\\rho = 0.593$) between the\nvariations in broad MgII and in the continuum. This is consistent with the idea\nthat MgII is varying in response to the continuum emission variations. Adopting\nthe modified weighted least squares regression method, we statistically\nconstrain the slopes (i.e., the responsivity $\\alpha$ of the broad MgII)\nbetween the variations in both components for the sources in different\nluminosity bins after eliminating intrinsic biases introduced by the rescaling\nprocess itself. It is shown that the responsivity is quite small (average\n$\\bar{\\alpha} \\approx$ 0.464) and anti-correlates with the quasar luminosity.\nOur results indicate that high signal-to-noise flux measurements are required\nto robustly detect the intrinsic variability and the time lag of MgII line.\n", "  We intend to investigate the underlying physics for the coronal rain\nphenomenon in a representative bipolar magnetic field, including the formation\nand the dynamics of coronal rain blobs. With the MPI-AMRVAC code, we performed\nthree dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with strong\nheating localized on footpoints of magnetic loops after a relaxation to quiet\nsolar atmosphere. Progressive cooling and in-situ condensation starts at the\nloop top due to radiative thermal instability. The first large-scale\ncondensation on the loop top suffers Rayleigh-Taylor instability and becomes\nfragmented into smaller blobs. The blobs fall vertically dragging magnetic\nloops until they reach low beta regions and start to fall along the loops from\nloop top to loop footpoints. A statistic study of the coronal rain blobs finds\nthat small blobs with masses of less than 10^10 g dominate the population. When\nblobs fall to lower regions along the magnetic loops, they are stretched and\ndevelop a non-uniform velocity pattern with an anti-parallel shearing pattern\nseen to develop along the central axis of the blobs. Synthetic images of\nsimulated coronal rain with Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly well resemble real observations presenting dark falling clumps in hot\nchannels and bright rain blobs in a cool channel. We also find density\ninhomogeneities during a coronal rain \"shower\", which reflects the observed\nmulti-stranded nature of coronal rain.\n", "  We present deep 3500$-$10000 $\\AA$ spectra of H II regions and planetary\nnebulae (PNe) in the starburst irregular galaxy NGC 4449, acquired with the\nMulti Object Double Spectrograph at the Large Binocular Telescope. Using the\n\"direct\" method, we derived the abundance of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, and S in six H\nII regions and in four PNe in NGC 4449. This is the first case of PNe studied\nin a starburst irregular outside the Local Group. Our H II region and PN sample\nextends over a galacto-centric distance range of $\\approx$2 kpc and spans\n$\\approx$0.2 dex in oxygen abundance, with average values of $12+\\log(O/H)=8.37\n\\pm 0.05$ and $8.3 \\pm 0.1$ for H II regions and PNe, respectively. PNe and H\nII regions exhibit similar oxygen abundances in the galacto-centric distance\nrange of overlap, while PNe appear more than $\\sim$1 dex enhanced in nitrogen\nwith respect to H II regions. The latter result is the natural consequence of N\nbeing mostly synthesized in intermediate-mass stars and brought to the stellar\nsurface during dredge-up episodes. On the other hand, the similarity in O\nabundance between H II regions and PNe suggests that NGC 4449' s interstellar\nmedium has been poorly enriched in $\\alpha$ elements since the progenitors of\nthe PNe were formed. Finally, our data reveal the presence of a negative oxygen\ngradient for both H II regions and PNe, whilst nitrogen does not exhibit any\nsignificant radial trend. We ascribe the (unexpected) nitrogen behaviour as due\nto local N enrichment by the conspicuous Wolf-Rayet population in NGC 4449.\n", "  We use the Gaia-TGAS data to compare the transverse velocities in Galactic\nlongitude (coming from proper motions and parallaxes) in the Milky Way disk for\nnegative and positive longitudes as a function of distance. The transverse\nvelocities are strongly asymmetric and deviate significantly from the\nexpectations for an axisymmetric Galaxy. The value and sign of the asymmetry\nchanges at spatial scales of several tens of degrees in Galactic longitude and\nabout 0.5 kpc in distance. The asymmetry is statistically significant at 95%\nconfidence level for 57% of the region probed, which extends up to ~1.2 kpc. A\npercentage of 24% of the region studied shows absolute differences at this\nconfidence level larger than 5 km/s and 7% larger than 10 km/s. The asymmetry\npattern shows mild variations in the vertical direction and with stellar type.\nA first qualitative comparison with spiral arm models indicates that the arms\nare unlikely to be the main source of the asymmetry. We briefly discuss\nalternative origins. This is the first time that global all-sky asymmetries are\ndetected in the Milky Way kinematics, beyond the local neighbourhood, and with\na purely astrometric sample.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the 2M1207 system, a young binary made of a\nbrown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion at a projected separation of about\n40 au. We detect emission from dust continuum at 0.89 mm and from the $J = 3 -\n2$ rotational transition of CO from a very compact disk around the young brown\ndwarf. The small radius found for this brown dwarf disk may be due to\ntruncation from the tidal interaction with the planetary-mass companion. Under\nthe assumption of optically thin dust emission, we estimated a dust mass of 0.1\n$M_{\\oplus}$ for the 2M1207A disk, and a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of $\\sim\n1~M_{\\rm{Moon}}$ for dust surrounding 2M1207b, which is the tightest upper\nlimit obtained so far for the mass of dust particles surrounding a young\nplanetary-mass companion. We discuss the impact of this and other\nnon-detections of young planetary-mass companions for models of planet\nformation, which predict the presence of circum-planetary material surrounding\nthese objects.\n", "  Ablation of interplanetary dust supplies oxygen to the upper atmospheres of\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Using recent dynamical model predictions\nfor the dust influx rates to the giant planets (Poppe, A.R.~et al.~[2016],\nIcarus 264, 369), we calculate the ablation profiles and investigate the\nsubsequent coupled oxygen-hydrocarbon neutral photochemistry in the\nstratospheres of these planets. We find that dust grains from the\nEdgeworth-Kuiper Belt, Jupiter-family comets, and Oort-cloud comets supply an\neffective oxygen influx rate of 1.0$^{+2.2}_{-0.7} \\, \\times \\, 10^7$ O atoms\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ to Jupiter, 7.4$^{+16}_{-5.1} \\, \\times 10^4$ cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ to Saturn, 8.9$^{+19}_{-6.1} \\, \\times \\, 10^4$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ to\nUranus, and 7.5$^{+16}_{-5.1} \\, \\times \\, 10^5$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ to Neptune.\nThe fate of the ablated oxygen depends in part on the molecular/atomic form of\nthe initially delivered products, and on the altitude at which it was\ndeposited. The dominant stratospheric products are CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$,\nwhich are relatively stable photochemically. Model-data comparisons suggest\nthat interplanetary dust grains deliver an important component of the external\noxygen to Jupiter and Uranus but fall far short of the amount needed to explain\nthe CO abundance currently seen in the middle stratospheres of Saturn and\nNeptune. Our results are consistent with the theory that all of the giant\nplanets have experienced large cometary impacts within the last few hundred\nyears. Our results also suggest that the low background H$_2$O abundance in\nJupiter's stratosphere is indicative of effective conversion of meteoric oxygen\nto CO during or immediately after the ablation process -- photochemistry alone\ncannot efficiently convert the H$_2$O into CO on the giant planets.\n", "  Borophene, an atomically thin, corrugated, crystalline two-dimensional boron\nsheet, has been recently synthesized. We investigate mechanical properties and\nlattice thermal conductivity of borophene via reactive molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We performed uniaxial tensile strain simulations at room\ntemperature along in-plane directions, and found 2D elastic moduli of 188 N/m\nand 403 N/m along zigzag and armchair directions, respectively. The anisotropy\nis attributed to the buckling of the borophene structure along the zigzag\ndirection. We also performed non-equilibrium molecular dynamics to calculate\nthe lattice thermal conductivity. We predict room-temperature lattice thermal\nconductivities of $75.9 \\pm 5.0$ W/m-K and $147 \\pm 7.3$ W/m-K, respectively,\nand estimate effective phonon mean free paths of $16.7 \\pm 1.7$ nm and $21.4\n\\pm 1.0$ nm for the zigzag and armchair directions. The anisotropy is\nattributed to differences in the density of states of low-frequency phonons,\nwith lower group velocities and possibly shorten phonon lifetimes along the\nzigzag direction. We also observe that when borophene is strained along the\narmchair direction there is a significant increase in thermal conductivity\nalong that direction. Meanwhile, when the sample is strained along the zigzag\ndirection there is a much smaller increase in thermal conductivity along that\ndirection. For a strain of 8\\% along the armchair direction the thermal\nconductivity increases by a factor of 3.5 (~250\\%), whereas for the same amount\nof strain along the zigzag direction the increase is only by a factor of 1.2\n(~20\\%). Our predictions are in agreement with recent first principles results,\nat a fraction of the computational cost. The simulations shall serve as a guide\nfor experiments concerning mechanical and thermal properties of borophene and\nrelated 2D materials.\n", "  HH 212 is a nearby (400 pc) Class 0 protostellar system recently found to\nhost a \"hamburger\"-shaped dusty disk with a radius of ~ 60 AU, deeply embedded\nin an infalling-rotating flattened envelope. We have spatially resolved this\nenvelope-disk system with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array at\nup to ~ 16 AU (0.04\") resolution. The envelope is detected in HCO+ J=4-3 down\nto the dusty disk. Complex organic molecules (COMs) and doubly deuterated\nformaldehyde (D2CO) are detected above and below the dusty disk within ~ 40 AU\nof the central protostar. The COMs are methanol (CH3OH), deuterated methanol\n(CH2DOH), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), and formamide (NH2CHO, a prebiotic\nprecursor). We have modeled the gas kinematics in HCO+ and COMs, and found a\ncentrifugal barrier at a radius of ~ 44 AU, within which a Keplerian rotating\ndisk is formed. This indicates that HCO+ traces the infalling-rotating envelope\ndown to centrifugal barrier and COMs trace the atmosphere of a Keplerian\nrotating disk within the centrifugal barrier. The COMs are spatially resolved\nfor the first time, both radially and vertically, in the atmosphere of a disk\nin the earliest, Class 0 phase of star formation. Our spatially resolved\nobservations of COMs favor their formation in the disk rather than a rapidly\ninfalling (warm) inner envelope. The abundances and spatial distributions of\nthe COMs provide strong constraints on models of their formation and transport\nin low-mass star formation.\n", "  We prove that the field equations of the Starobinsky model for inflation in a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker constitute an integrable system as the\nfield equations pass the singularity test. The analytical solution in terms of\na Painlev\\'{e} Series for the Starobinsky model is presented for the case of\nzero and nonzero spatial curvature. In both cases the leading-order term\ndescribes the radiation era provided by the corresponding higher-order theory.\n", "  We investigated the evolution of a massive galactic nucleus hosting a\nsuper-massive black hole (SMBH) with mass $M_\\mathrm{SMBH}=10^8\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ surrounded by a population of 42 heavy star clusters (GCs).\nUsing direct $N$-body modelling, we show here that the assembly of an NSC\nthrough GCs orbital decay and merger is efficiently inhibited by the tidal\nforces exerted from the SMBH. The GCs mass loss induced by tidal forces causes\na significant modification of their mass function, leading to a population of\nlow-mass ($<10^4$) clusters. Nonetheless, the GCs debris accumulated around the\nSMBH give rise to well-defined kinematical and morphological properties,\nleading to the formation of a disk-like structure. Interestingly, the disk is\nsimilar to the one observed in the M31 galaxy nucleus, which has properties\nsimilar to our numerical model. The simulation produced a huge amount of data,\nwhich we used to investigate whether the GC debris deposited around the SMBH\ncan enhance the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in our galaxy inner\ndensity distribution. Our results suggest that the GCs disruption shapes the\nSMBH neighbourhoods leading to a TDE rate of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-4} $yr$^{-1}$,\na value slightly larger than what expected in previous theoretical modelling of\ngalaxies with similar density profiles and central SMBHs. The simulation\npresented here is the first of its kind, representing a massive galactic\nnucleus and its star cluster population on scales $\\sim 100$ pc.\n", "  The probability density functions of net-proton multiplicity distributions\nare constructed from the Beam Energy Scan results of the STAR experiment using\nthe Pearson curve method for two different transverse momentum windows. The\n$6^{th}$ and $8^{th}$ order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions\nare estimated from the constructed probability density functions. The beam\nenergy dependence of $C_{6}/C_{2}$ and $C_{8}/C_{2}$ are found to be sensitive\nto the acceptance window. This method provides a unique opportunity to study\nthe O(4) criticality near the chiral crossover transition and estimating the\nhigher-order cumulants. In general, it is useful to determine the probability\ndensity function uniquely of a frequency data if the first four cumulants are\nknown.\n", "  Tamura coupling model has been extended to consider the coupling of\nadditional low-lying rotational bands to the ground state band. Rotational\nbands are built on vibrational bandheads (even-even targets) or single particle\nbandheads (odd-$A$ targets) including both axial and non-axial deformations.\nThese additional excitations are introduced as a perturbation to the underlying\naxially-symmetric rigid rotor structure of the ground state rotational band.\nCoupling matrix elements of the generalized optical model are derived for\nextended multi-band transitions in even-even and odd-$A$ nuclei. Isospin\nsymmetric formulation of the optical model is employed.\n  A coupled-channels optical model potential (OMP) containing a dispersive\ncontribution is used to fit simultaneously all available optical experimental\ndatabases including neutron strength functions for nucleon scattering on\n$^{232}$Th, $^{233,235,238}$U and $^{239}$Pu nuclei and quasi-elastic ($p$,$n$)\nscattering data on $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U. Lane consistent OMP is derived for\nall actinides if corresponding multi-band coupling schemes are defined.\nCalculations using the derived OMP potential reproduce measured total\ncross-section differences between several actinide pairs within experimental\nuncertainty for incident neutron energies from 50 keV up to 150MeV. Multi-band\ncoupling is stronger in even-even targets due to the collective nature of the\ncoupling; the impact of extended coupling on predicted compound-nucleus\nformation cross section reaches 5% below 3 MeV of incident neutron energy.\nCoupling of ground-state rotational band levels in odd-$A$ nuclei is sufficient\nfor a good description of the compound-nucleus formation cross sections as long\nas the coupling is saturated (a minimum of 7 coupled levels are typically\nneeded).\n", "  Analogy to Cherenkov radiation, when a particle moves faster than the\npropagation velocity of gravitational wave in matter ($v>c_{\\rm{g}}$), we\nexpect gravitational wave-Cherenkov radiation (GWCR). In the situation that a\nphoton travels across diffuse dark matters, the GWCR condition is always\nsatisfied, photon will thence loss its energy all the path. This effect is long\nbeen ignored in the practice of astrophysics and cosmology, without\njustification with serious calculation. We study this effect for the first\ntime, and shows that this energy loss time of the photon is far longer than the\nHubble time, therefore justify the practice of ignoring this effect in\nastrophysics context.\n", "  We carefully examine the depolarization feature of blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands using the sample of Mead et al. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nturbulence could be one possible reason for the depolarization of\noptical/infrared blazars when we apply the theoretical analysis of Lazarian and\nPogosyan. We further identify in the sample that the depolarization results\nshown in most blazars roughly obey the form of the three-dimensional\nanisotropic Kolmogorov scaling. The effective Faraday rotation window length\nscale is not small enough to resolve the polarization correlation length scale\nin the blazar sample. The depolarization and the related turbulent features\nshow diversities in different blazar sources. We suggest more simultaneous\nobservations in both the optical/infrared and the high-energy bands for the\nstudy of the blazar polarization.\n", "  I explore the thermal evolution and ionization states in gas cooling from an\ninitially hot state in the presence of external photoionizing radiation. I\ncompute the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cooling efficiencies, heating rates,\nand ion fractions for low-density gas cooling while exposed to the ionizing\nmetagalactic background radiation at various redshifts (z=0 - 3), for a range\nof temperatures (1e8-1e4 K), densities (1e-7 - 1e3 cm^-3) and metallicities\n(1e-3 - 2 times solar). The results indicate the existence of a threshold\nionization parameter, above which the cooling efficiencies are very close to\nthose in photoionization equilibrium (so that departures from equilibrium may\nbe neglected), and below which the cooling efficiencies resemble those in\ncollisional time-dependent gas cooling with no external radiation (and are thus\nindependent of density)\n", "  As a tribute to Abdus Salam, I recall the initiation in 1972-73 of the idea\nof grand unification based on the view that lepton number is the fourth color.\nMotivated by aesthetic demands, these attempts led to the suggestion that the\nexisting $SU(2)\\times U(1)$ symmetry be extended minimally to the quark-lepton\nand left-right symmetric non-Abelian gauge structure $G(2,2,4) = SU(2)_L\\times\nSU(2)_R\\times SU(4)$-color. This unified members of a family within a single\nL-R self-conjugate multiplet. It also explained: the quantization of electric\ncharge, the co-existence of quarks and leptons, and that of their three forces,\nwhile providing the appealing possibility that nature is fundamentally\nleft-right symmetric. The minimal extension of $G(2,2,4)$ to a simple group is\ngiven by the symmetry $SO(10)$ that came a year later. The advantages of the\ncore symmetry $G(2,2,4)$, including those listed above (which are of course\nretained by $SO(10)$), are noted. These include the introductions of: (i){ \\it\nthe right-handed neutrino as a compelling member of each family}, (ii) (B-L) as\na local symmetry, and (iii) the relation $ m(\\nu^\\tau)_{Dirac} = m_{top}$.\nThese three features, as well as the gauge coupling unification scale, are\ncrucially needed to understand the tiny mass-scales of the neutrino\noscillations within the seesaw mechanism, and to implement successfully the\nmechanism of baryogenesis via leptogenesis. Implications of a well-motivated\nclass of models based on supersymmetric $SO(10)$ or a string-unified $G(2,2,4)$\nsymmetry in 4D for (a) gauge coupling unification, (b) fermion masses and\nmixings, (c) neutrino osillations, (d) baryogenesis via leptogenesis, and last\nbut not least (e) proton decay are presented. Recent works on the latter\nproviding upper limits on proton lifetimes suggest that the potential for\ndiscovery of proton decay in the next-generation detectors would be high.\n", "  We study the light emission from quantum emitter and double metallic\nnanoshell hybrid systems. Quantum emitters act as local sources which transmit\ntheir light efficiently due to a double nanoshell near field. The double\nnanoshell consists a dielectric core and two outer nanoshells.\n", "  Acoustic imaging typically relies on large sensor arrays that can be\nelectronically complex and often have large data storage requirements to\nprocess element level data. Recently, the concept of a single-pixel-imager has\ngarnered interest in the electromagnetics literature due to it's ability to\nform high quality images with a single receiver paired with shaped aperture\nscreens that allow for the collection of spatially orthogonal measurements.\nHere, we present a method for creating an acoustic analog to the\nsingle-pixel-imager found in electromagnetics. Additionally, diffraction is\nconsidered to account for screen openings comparable to the acoustic\nwavelength. A diffraction model is presented and incorporated into the single\npixel framework. The method is experimentally validated with laboratory\nmeasurements made in air.\n", "  Elementary Cycles Theory is a self-consistent, unified formulation of quantum\nand relativistic physics. Here we introduce its basic quantum aspects. On one\nhand, Newton's law of inertia states that every isolated particle has\npersistent motion, i.e. constant energy and momentum. On the other hand, the\nwave-particle duality associates a space-time recurrence to the elementary\nparticle energy-momentum. Paraphrasing these two fundamental principles,\nElementary Cycles Theory postulates that every isolated elementary constituent\nof nature (every elementary particle) must be characterized by persistent\nintrinsic space-time periodicity. Elementary particles are the elementary\nreference clocks of Nature. The space-time periodicity is determined by the\nkinematical state (energy and momentum), so that interactions imply\nmodulations, and every system is decomposable in terms of modulated elementary\ncycles. Undulatory mechanics is imposed as constraint \"overdetermining\"\nrelativistic mechanics, similarly to Einstein's proposal of unification.\nSurprisingly this mathematically proves that the unification of quantum and\nrelativistic physics is fully achieved by imposing an intrinsically cyclic (or\ncompact) nature for relativistic space-time coordinates. In particular the\nMinkowskian time must be cyclic. The resulting classical mechanics are in fact\nfully consistent with relativity and reproduces all the fundamental aspects of\nquantum-relativistic mechanics without explicit quantization. This\n\"overdetermination\" just enforces both the local nature of relativistic\nspace-time and the wave-particle duality. It also implies a fully\ngeometrodynamical formulation of gauge interactions which, similarly to gravity\nand general relativity, is inferred as modulations of the elementary space-time\nclocks. This brings novel elements to address most of the fundamental open\nproblems of modern physics.\n", "  We tackle the problem of accurate simulations of switching currents arising\nfrom tunnel events in the washboard potentials associated to Josephson\njunctions. The measurements of the probability distribution of the switching\ncurrents is essential to determine the quantum character of the device, and\ntherefore is at the core of technological applications, as Josephson junctions,\nthat have been proposed for quantum computers. In particular, we show how to\naccurately calibrate the parameters of the boundary conditions to avoid\nspurious reflections of the wavefunction from the finite border of numerical\nsimulations. The proposed approximate numerical scheme exploits a quantum\nversion of a prefect matched layers for the boundary problems associated with\nthis class of potentials. Thus, we employ the analogous of a well established\nelectromagnetic method to deal with radiation in mesoscopic quantum systems.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate that the known analytic results are well\nrecovered in the appropriated limits of quantum measurements. We also find that\na relaxation time shows up in the dynamics of the quantum evolution in between\ntwo consecutive measurements.\n", "  Quantum effects arising from manifestly broken time-reversal symmetry are\ninvestigated using time-dependent perturbation theory in a simple model. The\nforward time and the backward time Hamiltonians are taken to be different and\nhence the forward and backward amplitudes become unsymmetrical and are not\ncomplex conjugates of each other. The effects vanish when the symmetry breaking\nterm is absent and ordinary quantum mechanical results such as Fermi Golden\nrule are recovered.\n", "  The black hole candidate 1E 1740.7-2942 is one of the strongest hard X-ray\nsources in the Galactic Center region. No counterparts in longer wavelengths\nhave been identified for this object yet. The presence of characteristic timing\nsignatures in the flux history of X-ray sources has been shown to be an\nimportant diagnostic tool for the properties of these systems. Using\nsimultaneous data from NASA's Swift and ESA's INTEGRAL missions, we have found\ntwo periodic signatures at 12.61 $\\pm$ 0.06 days and 171.1 $\\pm$ 3.0 days in\nlong-term hard X-ray light curves of 1E 1740.7-2942. We interpret those as the\norbital and superorbital periods of the object, respectively. The reported\norbital period is in good agreement with previous studies of 1E 1740.7-2942\nusing NASA's RXTE data. We present here the first firm evidence of a\nsuperorbital period for 1E 1740.7-2942, which has important implications for\nthe nature of the binary system.\n", "  We introduce a kernel Lasso (kLasso) optimization that simultaneously\naccounts for spatial regularity and network sparsity to reconstruct spatial\ncomplex networks from data. Through a kernel function, the proposed approach\nexploits spatial embedding distances to penalize overabundance of spatially\nlong-distance connections. Examples of both synthetic and real-world spatial\nnetworks show that the proposed method improves significantly upon existing\nnetwork reconstruction techniques that mainly concerns sparsity but not spatial\nregularity. Our results highlight the promise of data fusion in the\nreconstruction of complex networks, by utilizing both microscopic node-level\ndynamics (e.g., time series data) and macroscopic network-level information\n(metadata).\n", "  On a fine grained scale the Gibbs entropy of an isolated system remains\nconstant throughout its dynamical evolution. This is a consequence of\nLiouville's theorem for Hamiltonian systems and appears to contradict the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. In reality, however, there is no problem since\nthe thermodynamic entropy should be associated with the Boltzmann entropy,\nwhich for non-equilibrium systems is different from Gibbs entropy. The\nBoltzmann entropy accounts for the microstates which are not accessible from a\ngiven initial condition, but are compatible with a given macrostate. In a sense\nthe Boltzmann entropy is a coarse grained version of the Gibbs entropy and will\nnot decrease during the dynamical evolution of a macroscopic system. In this\npaper we will explore the entropy production for systems with long range\ninteractions. Unlike for short range systems, in the thermodynamic limit, the\nprobability density function for these systems decouples into a product of one\nparticle distribution functions and the coarse grained entropy can be\ncalculated explicitly. We find that the characteristic time for the entropy\nproduction scales with the number of particles as $N^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha >\n0$, so that in the thermodynamic limit entropy production takes an infinite\namount of time.\n", "  We suggest a qualitative model of a high-$T_c$ superconductor, based on\nconsiderations of thermodynamics of phase transitions. As an example, we\nconsider the Mott transition and classify 5 solid phases around it. In our\nmodel, a combined electronic and structural instability causes segregation into\neither neutral or charged phases. A charged precipitate with a quantized\nelectric charge is a collective excitation of electrons, stabilized by a\ncollective athermal displacement of ions; this local variation of the charge\ndensity, accompanied by a local lattice deformation, can behave as a\nquasi\\-particle. A condensate of charged bosonic quasi\\-particles is\nresponsible for the superconductivity.\n", "  We use high resolution direct numerical simulations to study the anisotropic\ncontents of a turbulent, statistically homogeneous flow with random transitions\namong multiple energy containing states. We decompose the velocity correlation\nfunctions on different sectors of the three dimensional group of rotations,\nSO(3), using a high-precision quadrature. Scaling properties of anisotropic\ncomponents of longitudinal and transverse velocity fluctuations are accurately\nmeasured at changing Reynolds numbers. We show that independently of the\nanisotropic content of the energy containing eddies, small-scale turbulent\nfluctuations recover isotropy and universality faster than previously reported\nin experimental and numerical studies. The discrepancies are ascribed to the\npresence of highly anisotropic contributions that have either been neglected or\nmeasured with less accuracy in the foregoing works. Furthermore, the anomalous\nanisotropic scaling exponents are devoid of any sign of saturation with\nincreasing order. Our study paves the way to systematically assess persistence\nof anisotropy in high Reynolds number flows.\n", "  Comparison of hydrodynamic calculations with experimental data inevitably\nrequires a model for converting the fluid to particles. In this work, nonlinear\n$2\\to 2$ kinetic theory is used to assess the overall accuracy of various shear\nviscous fluid-to-particle conversion models, such as the quadratic Grad\ncorrections, the Strickland-Romatschke (SR) ansatz, self-consistent shear\ncorrections from linearized kinetic theory, and the correction from the\nrelaxation time approach. We test how well the conversion models can\nreconstruct, using solely the hydrodynamic fields computed from the transport,\nthe phase space density for a massless one-component gas undergoing a 0+1D\nlongitudinal boost-invariant expansion with approximately constant specific\nshear viscosity in the range $\\sim 0.03 \\le \\eta/s \\le \\sim 0.2$.\n  In general we find that at early times the SR form is the most accurate,\nwhereas at late times or for small $\\eta/s\\sim 0.05$ the self-consistent\ncorrections from kinetic theory perform the best. In addition, we show that the\nreconstruction accuracy of additive shear viscous $f = f_{\\rm eq} + \\delta f$\nmodels dramatically improves if one ensures, through \"exponentiation\", that $f$\nis always positive. We also illustrate how even more accurate viscous $\\delta\nf$ models can be constructed if one includes information about the past\nevolution of the system via the first time derivative of hydrodynamic fields.\nSuch time derivatives are readily available in hydrodynamic simulations, though\nusually not included in the output.\n", "  Photosynthetic organisms harvest light energy, utilizing the absorption and\nenergy transfer properties of protein-bound chromophores. Controlling the\nharvesting efficiency is critical for the optimal function of the\nphotosynthetic apparatus. Here, we show that cyanobacterial light-harvesting\nantenna may be able to regulate the flow of energy in order to switch\nreversibly from efficient energy conversion to photo-protective quenching via a\nstructural change. We isolated cyanobacterial light harvesting proteins,\nphycocyanin and allophycocyanin, and measured their optical properties in\nsolution and in an aggregated-desiccated state. The results indicate that\nenergy band structures are changed, generating a switch between two modes of\noperation: exciton transfer and quenching; achieved without dedicated\ncarotenoid quenchers. This flexibility can contribute greatly to the large\ndynamic range of cyanobacterial light harvesting systems.\n", "  Metal-halide perovskites are a class of solution processed materials with\nremarkable optoelectronic properties such as high photoluminescence quantum\nyields and long carrier lifetimes, which makes them promising for a wide range\nof efficient photonic devices. In this work, we demonstrate the first\nsuccessful integration of a perovskite laser onto a silicon nitride photonic\nchip. High throughput, low cost optical lithography is used followed by\nindirect structuring of the perovskite waveguide. We embed methylammonium lead\ntri-iodide (MAPbI3) in a pre-patterned race-track microresonator and couple the\nemitted light to an integrated photonic waveguide. We clearly observe the\nbuild-up of spectrally narrow lasing modes at room temperature upon a pump\nthreshold fluence of $19.6 \\mu Jcm^{-2}$. Our results evidence the possibility\nof on-chip lasers based on metal-halide perovskites with industry relevance on\na commercially available dielectric photonic platform, which is a step forward\ntowards low-cost integrated photonic devices.\n", "  We consider acoustic wave transmission in non axisymmetric waveguide which\nconsists of cylindrical resonator and two semi-infinite cylindrical waveguides\nwhose axes are shifted relative to the resonator axis and each other by\nazimuthal angle $\\Delta\\phi$. We show that for rotation of one of attached\nwaveguides the coupling matrix elements of the eigenmodes of resonator\nclassified by the integer $m$ and propagating mode of the waveguide acquire\nphase factor $e^{im\\Delta\\phi}$. That crucially effect Fano resonances and\ncreates an analog of faucet opening and closing wave flux under rotation of the\nwaveguide. We show that under the rotation of the waveguide and variation of\nthe length of resonator numerous bound states in the continuum occur\ncomplimenting by the Fano resonance collapse.\n", "  Through a 2-dimensionnal tight-binding crystal orbital approach and a (CuO2)2\nsquare unit cell of parameter a, we show that a Cu2+/O2- -> Cu+/O- charge\ntransfer is likely to occur at the M($\\pi/a$, $\\pi/a$) point of the Brillouin\nzone, for O4 groups with antibonding b1g symmetry. This approach emphasises the\nrole of oxygen-oxygen interactions in avoiding the nesting of the Fermi surface\nand agrees with its observed topology. At the M point of the Brillouin zone,\noxygen atoms are strongly dissymmetric (\"Janus\" atoms) and link copper atoms\nwith different environments (a1g vs. b1g symmetries). Further hole doping\ngenerates two situations: two holes (S=0) and/or a single hole (S=+/- 1/2) in\nthe O4 b1g groups ($\\sigma$ or $\\pi$), with a possible equilibrium between\nthem; the former can be considered as a \"hole lone pair\" by analogy with\nelectron lone pairs. Mulliken-Jaffe electronegativity considerations justify\nthe nearly zero U Hubbard parameter value. The mixing of the pair-occupied with\npair-iunoccupied wave functions is realised via an electronic hamiltonian in\nplace of the electron-phonon coupling of the pristine BCS theory.\n", "  This paper deals with the problem of improving the seismic strength of\nmechanical structures by using a tendon system as actuation device. It consists\nof a pair of tension cables transmitting a control torque to the structure at\nthe moment arm position. The purpose of the paper is to, establish the\nanalytical framework consisting of mathematical modelling of cantilever beam\nunder active tendon structural control, analyze the stability and, determine\nthe physical characteristics of tendon system leading to the suppression of\nhorseshoes chaos. The control efficiency is found by analyzing the behavior of\nthe controlled system through the Melnikov methods. We also provide the\ncritical control gain parameters leading to the efficiency of the control\nprocess.\n", "  The pursuit for an appropriate universal scaling factor to satisfy the\ntime-temperature superposition principle for grain and grain boundary responses\nhas been explored in the ac conductivity domain for polycrystalline double\nperovskite oxides A2HoRuO6 (AHR; A = Ba, Sr, Ca). The samples show different\nstructural phases ranging from cubic to monoclinic with decreasing ionic radii.\nThe degree of distortion in the materials is correlated to the strength of\nbonding through the bond valence sum (BVS). The conductivity spectra for all\nthe samples obey the power law behaviour. The contribution of different\nmicrostructural features to the conduction process is established. Thermal\nvariation of dc resistivity points towards a gradual crossover from nearest\nneighbour to variable range hopping. The activation energies obtained from dc\nconductivity, hopping frequency and relaxation frequency show close correlation\nbetween the conduction and relaxation mechanisms. The scaled conductivity\ncurves for AHR showed the presence of two different conduction processes with\ndissimilar activation energies in the grain boundary and grain response\nregimes. It is thus concluded that a single scaling parameter is insufficient\nto satisfy the time temperature superposition principle universally when two\ndifferent thermally activated regions are present simultaneously in the\nmaterials.\n", "  Double parton scattering (DPS) describes two colliding hadrons having\ninteractions in the form of two hard processes, each initiated by a separate\npair of partons. Just as for single parton scattering, the resummation of soft\ngluon exchange gives rise to a soft function, which is a necessary ingredient\nfor obtaining rapidity evolution equations. For various regions of phase space,\nwe derive the rapidity evolution and the scale evolution of double transverse\nmomentum dependent parton distribution functions (DTMDs) as well as of the\n$p_{T}$-resummed cross section for double Drell-Yan like processes. This\ncontributes to a framework that can be used for phenomenological DPS studies\nincluding resummation.\n", "  The classical Boltzmann equation is an integro-differential equation which\ndescribes the time evolution of rarefied gas in terms of a molecular\ndistribution function. For some kinetic problems where it is necessary to add\nin the Boltzmann equation a source term depending on the independent and\ndependent variables. This paper is devoted to applying preliminary group\nclassification to the Boltzmann equation with a source function by using the\nLie group $L_{11}$ admitted by the classical Boltzmann equation.\n  The developed strategy for deriving determining equation of an\nintegro-differential equation with a source (in general form) using a known Lie\ngroup admitted by the corresponding equation without the source is applied to\nthe Boltzmann equation with a source. Solving the determining equation for the\nsource function for each subalgebra of the optimal system of subalgebras of the\nLie algebra $L_{11}$, a preliminary group classification of the Boltzmann\nequation with respect to the source function is obtained.\n  Furthermore, representations of invariant solutions of the Boltzmann equation\nwith a source are presented. The reduced equations are also shown for some\nrepresentations of invariant solutions.\n", "  Bipartite Graph is often a realistic model of complex networks where two\ndifferent sets of entities are involved and relationship exist only two\nentities belonging to two different sets. Examples include the user-item\nrelationship of a recommender system, actor-movie relationship of an online\nmovie database systems. One way to compress a bipartite graph is to take\nunweighted or weighted one mode projection of one side vertices. Properties of\nthis projected network are extremely important in many practical situations\n(say the selection process of influencing nodes for viral marketing). In this\npaper, we have studied the topological properties for projected network and\nsome theoretical results are proved including the presence of cliques,\nconnectedness for unweighted projection and maximum edge weight for weighted\nprojected network.\n", "  Magnetometers based on ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy centres are a promising\nplatform for continuously sensing static and low-frequency magnetic fields.\nTheir combination with phase-sensitive (lock-in) detection creates a highly\nversatile sensor with a sensitivity that is proportional to the derivative of\nthe optical magnetic resonance lock-in spectrum, which is in turn dependant on\nthe lock-in modulation parameters. Here we study the dependence of the lock-in\nspectral slope on the modulation of the spin-driving microwave field. Given the\npresence of the intrinsic nitrogen hyperfine spin transitions, we\nexperimentally show that when the ratio between the hyperfine linewidth and\ntheir separation is $\\gtrsim 1/4$, square-wave based frequency modulation\ngenerates the steepest slope at modulation depths exceeding the separation of\nthe hyperfine lines, compared to sine-wave based modulation. We formulate a\nmodel for calculating lock-in spectra which shows excellent agreement with our\nexperiments, and which shows that an optimum slope is achieved when the\nlinewidth/separation ratio is $\\lesssim 1/4$ and the modulation depth is less\nthen the resonance linewidth, irrespective of the modulation function used.\n", "  We propose a geometry-specific, mode-selective quantization scheme in coupled\nfield-emitter systems which makes it easy to include material and geometrical\nproperties, intrinsic losses as well as the positions of an arbitrary number of\nquantum emitters. The method is presented through the example of a spherically\nsymmetric, non-magnetic, arbitrarily layered system. We follow it up by a\nframework to project the system on simpler, effective cavity QED models.\nMaintaining a well-defined connection to the original quantization, we derive\nthe emerging effective quantities from the full, mode-selective model in a\nmathematically consistent way. We discuss the uses and limitations of these\neffective models.\n", "  We present a method of deriving linearizing transformations for a class of\nsecond order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. We construct a general\nform of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that admits Bernoulli\nequation as its first integral. We extract conditions for this integral to\nyield three different linearizing transformations, namely point, Sundman and\ngeneralized linearizing transformations. The explicit forms of these\nlinearizing transformations are given. The exact forms and the general solution\nof the nonlinear ODE for these three linearizables cases are also enumerated.\nWe illustrate the procedure with three different examples.\n", "  The comparison study of high pressure superconducting state of recently\nsynthesized H$_3$S and PH$_3$ compounds are conducted within the framework of\nthe strong-coupling theory. By generalization of the standard Eliashberg\nequations to include the lowest-order vertex correction, we have investigated\nthe influence of the nonadiabatic effects on the Coulomb pseudopotential,\nelectron effective mass, energy gap function and on the $2\\Delta(0)/T_C$ ratio.\nWe found that, for a fixed value of critical temperature ($178$ K for H$_3$S\nand $81$ K for PH$_3$), the nonadiabatic corrections reduce the Coulomb\npseudopotential for H$_3$S from $0.204$ to $0.185$ and for PH$_3$ from $0.088$\nto $0.083$, however, the electron effective mass and ratio $2\\Delta(0)/T_C$\nremain unaffected. Independently of the assumed method of analysis, the\nthermodynamic parameters of superconducting H$_3$S and PH$_3$ strongly deviate\nfrom the prediction of BCS theory due to the strong-coupling and retardation\neffects.\n", "  We report the first experimental results of the magnetoresistance, Hall\neffect, and quantum Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations on single crystals of ZrTe,\nwhich was recently predicted to be a new type of topological semimetal hosting\nboth triply degenerate crossing points and Weyl fermion state. The analysis of\nHall effect and quantum oscillations indicate that ZrTe is a multiband system\nwith low carrier density, high carrier mobility, small cross-sectional area of\nFermi surface, and light cyclotron effective mass, as observed in many\ntopological semimetals. Meanwhile, the angular dependence of the\nmagnetoresistance and the quantum-oscillation frequencies further suggest that\nZrTe possesses a three-dimensional Fermi surface that is rather complex. Our\nresults provide a new platform to realize exotic quantum phenomena related to\nthe new three-component fermions distinct from Dirac and Weyl fermions.\n", "  The growing study of time series, especially those related to nonlinear\nsystems, has challenged the methodologies to characterize and classify\ndynamical structures of a signal. Here we conceive a new diagnostic tool for\ntime series based on the concept of information entropy, in which the\nprobabilities are associated to microstates defined from the recurrence phase\nspace. Recurrence properties can properly be studied using recurrence plots, a\nmethodology based on binary matrices where trajec- tories in phase space of\ndynamical systems are evaluated against other embedded trajectory. Our novel\nentropy methodology has several advantages compared to the traditional\nrecurrence entropy defined in the literature, namely, the correct evaluation of\nthe chaoticity level of the signal, the weak dependence on parameters, correct\nevaluation of periodic time series properties and more sensitivity to noise\nlevel of time series. Furthermore, the new entropy quantifier developed in this\nmanuscript also fixes inconsistent results of the traditional recurrence\nentropy concept, reproducing classical results with novel insights.\n", "  In 2003 Lawler and Werner introduced the Brownian loop measure and studied\nsome of its properties. Cardy and Gamsa has predicted a formula for the total\nmass of the Brownian loop measure on the set of simple loops in the upper half\nplane and disconnect two given points from the boundary. In this paper we give\na rigorous proof of the formula using a result by Beliaev and Viklund and heavy\ncomputations.\n", "  As there is no quantum error correction code with universal set of\ntransversal gates, several approaches have been proposed which, in combination\nof transversal gates, make universal fault-tolerant quantum computation\npossible. Magic state distillation, code switching, code concatenation and\npieceable fault-tolerance are well-known examples of such approaches. However,\nthe overhead of these approaches is one of the main bottlenecks for large-scale\nquantum computation. In this paper, two approaches for universal fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, mainly based on code concatenation, are proposed. The\nproposed approaches outperform code concatenation in terms of both number of\nqubits and code distance and has also significantly less resource overhead than\ncode switching, magic state distillation and pieceable fault-tolerance at the\ncost of reducing the effective distance of the concatenated code for\nimplementing non-transversal gates.\n", "  We discuss the relevance of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in\ncore-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Our recent numerical studies show that in\nCCSNe, the MRI is terminated by parasitic instabilities of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ntype. To determine whether the MRI can amplify initially weak magnetic fields\nto dynamically relevant strengths in CCSNe, we performed three-dimensional\nsimulations of a region close to the surface of a differentially rotating\nproto-neutron star in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics with two different\nnumerical codes. We find that under the conditions prevailing in proto-neutron\nstars, the MRI can amplify the magnetic field by (only) one order of magnitude.\nThis severely limits the role of MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying the\nmagnetic field in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed fields.\n", "  The hierarchical topology is a common property of many complex systems. Here\nwe introduce a simple but generic model of hierarchy growth from the bottom to\nthe top. Therein, two dynamical processes are accounted for: agent's promotions\nto next hierarchy levels when local speakers are elected and followed by other\nagents and agent's degradations to the lowest hierarchy. Following the initial\nstage when all agents are at the bottom level in the course of time the system\napproaches a stationary state where new hierarchies no longer emerge and the\ndistribution of agents at different levels is exponential. In the stationary\nstate the average hierarchy level and the fraction of agents at the lowest\nlevel are independent from the system size however the height of hierarchy,\ni.e. maximal number of observed hierarchy levels grows logarithmically along\nthe total number of agents. The average number of followers of an agent in the\nstationary state is much smaller than the number of followers he possessed at\nthe promotion moment. Results from numerical simulations are confirmed by an\nanalytical treatment based on the rate equation.\n", "  Individual and national wealth accumulation is here modelled as a recurrently\nplayed game between randomly matched pairs of individuals from a large\npopulation. The simple game here studied represents exogenously and\nspontaneously arising productive opportunities, and the drawn individuals may\nseek cooperation or conflict over each opportunity. How does national wealth\nand the evolutionarily stable cooperation rate depend on natural resources and\ninstitutions? We show that the steady-state level of national wealth is not\nmonotonically increasing with natural resources. We also study the evolution of\nthe full wealth distribution. When the population is large, the distribution of\nindividual wealth converges over time to a skewed distribution. We also analyze\nthe effect of institutions and the possibility that wealthier individuals are\nmore likely to win conflicts, including effects on national wealth and\ninequality.\n", "  Composite joints with high-performance close to the parent materials of\naluminum matrix composites were fabricated by a new joining technology assisted\nby ultrasonic vibration. We found both the microstructure and the mechanical\nperformance were systematically dependent on the volume fraction and the\ndistribution of reinforcement particles in the bond region. This study can be\ngeneralized to the bonding of other ceramic-reinforced metal matrix composites.\n", "  We report on a recent calculation of the full next-to-leading-order\nelectroweak corrections to Z-boson pair production with subsequent decays into\nfour charged leptons. Using the complete matrix elements at leading order and\nnext-to-leading order in the electroweak coupling for the processes\n$pp\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-e^+e^-$ and $pp \\to\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$, this includes all\noff-shell effects of intermediate massive vector bosons and photons. We employ\na gauge-invariant splitting for the electroweak corrections into purely weak\nand photonic corrections. The latter show the well-known radiative tails near\nkinematical thresholds or resonances. The former are generically at the level\nof $\\sim-5\\%$ for the fiducial cross section and reach several $-10\\%$ in the\nhigh-energy tails of distributions due to logarithms of electroweak origin. The\nimpact of interference effects due to equal-flavour leptons in the final state\ncan reach the order of $5\\%$ in off-shell-sensitive regions. Photon-induced\ncontributions are included in our calculation, but turn out to be\nphenomenologically unimportant.\n", "  Hydrodynamics is a universal effective theory describing relaxation of\nquantum field theories towards equilibrium. Massive QFTs in de Sitter spacetime\nare never at equilibrium. We use holographic gauge theory/gravity\ncorrespondence to describe relaxation of a QFT to its Bunch-Davies vacuum - an\nattractor of its late-time dynamics. Specifically, we compute the analogue of\nthe quasinormal modes describing the relaxation of a holographic toy model QFT\nin de Sitter.\n", "  The probabilities of transitions of the system to the different final states\nare determined by the values of the amplitudes of the corresponding individual\nstates during stimulated recombination of atoms.\n", "  A new generation of 3D silicon pixel detectors with a small pixel size of\n50$\\times$50 and 25$\\times$100 $\\mu$m$^{2}$ is being developed for the HL-LHC\ntracker upgrades. The radiation hardness of such detectors was studied in beam\ntests after irradiation to HL-LHC fluences up to $1.4\\times10^{16}$\nn$_{\\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$. At this fluence, an operation voltage of only 100 V\nis needed to achieve 97% hit efficiency, with a power dissipation of 13\nmW/cm$^2$ at -25$^{\\circ}$C, considerably lower than for previous 3D sensor\ngenerations and planar sensors.\n", "  The more we go deep into the knowledge of the dark component which embeds the\nstellar component of galaxies, the more we realize the profound interconnection\nbetween them. We show that the scaling laws among the structural properties of\nthe dark and luminous matter in galaxies are too complex to derive from two\ninert components that just share the same gravitational field. In this paper we\nreview the 30 years old paradigm of collisionless dark matter in galaxies. We\nfound that their dynamical properties show strong indications that the dark and\nluminous components have interacted in a more direct way over a Hubble Time.\nThe proofs for this are the presence of central cored regions with constant DM\ndensity in which their size is related with the disk lenghtscales. Moreover we\nfind that the quantity $\\rho_{DM}(r,L,R_D) \\rho_\\star (r,L,R_D)$ shows, in all\nobjects, peculiarities very hardly explained in a collisionless DM scenario.\n", "  We develop a multi-scale approach to simulate hydrated nanobio systems under\nrealistic condi- tions (e.g., nanoparticles and protein solutions at\nphysiological conditions over time-scales up to hours). We combine atomistic\nsimulations of water at bio-interfaces (e.g., proteins or membranes) and\nnano-interfaces (e.g., nanoparticles or graphene sheets) and coarse-grain\nmodels of hydration water for protein folding and protein design. We study\nprotein self-assembly and crystallization, in bulk or under confinement, and\nthe kinetics of protein adsorption onto nanoparticles, verify- ing our\npredictions in collaboration with several experimental groups. We try to find\nanswers for fundamental questions (Why water is so important for life? Which\nproperties make water unique for biological processes?) and applications (Can\nwe design better drugs? Can we limit protein- aggregations causing Alzheimer?\nHow to implement nanotheranostic?). Here we focus only on the two larger scales\nof our approach: (i) The coarse-grain description of hydrated proteins and\nprotein folding at sub-nanometric length-scale and milliseconds-to-seconds\ntime-scales, and (ii) the coarse-grain modeling of protein self-assembly on\nnanoparticles at 10-to-100 nm length-scale and seconds-to-hours time-scales.\n", "  An asymptotic corrected exchange hole potential analogous to Becke-Roussel\n[A. D. Becke and M. R. Roussel, Phys. Rev. A 39, 3761 (1989)] is constructed by\nmodeling the exchange hole using the generalized coordinate transformation\nbased on density matrix expansion. The model potential is Laplacian free and\nthe inhomogeneity present in the system is included in the momentum vector\nwithout affecting the uniform density limit. The parameters associated with the\nmodel exchange hole are fitted with the spherical atoms. The newly constructed\npotential along with Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TBMBJ) [F. Tran and P.\nBlaha, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 226401 (2009)] potential quite accurately produces\nthe band gap of various materials ranging from semiconductor through\ninsulators. The results for band gap are improved compared to the TBMBJ and\nother standard semilocal exchange functionals.\n", "  We present a pilot study of ~ 3\" resolution observations of low CO\ntransitions with the Submillimeter Array in three nearby Seyfert galaxies,\nwhich are part of the low-luminosity quasi-stellar object (LLQSOs) sample\nconsisting of 99 nearby (z = 0.06) type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) taken\nfrom the Hamburg/ESO quasi-stellar object (QSO) survey. Two sources were\nobserved in 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) and the third in 12CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3).\nNone of the sources is detected in continuum emission. More than 80% of the\n12CO detected molecular gas is concentrated within a diameter (FWHM) < 1.8 kpc.\n13CO is tentatively detected, while HCO+ emission could not be detected. All\nthree objects show indications of a kinematically decoupled central unresolved\nmolecular gas component. The molecular gas masses of the three galaxies are in\nthe range M_mol = (0.7 - 8.7) x 10^9 M_sun. We give lower limits for the\ndynamical masses of M_dyn > 1.5 x 10^9 M_sun and for the dust masses of M_dust\n> 1.6 x 10^6 M_sun. The R21 =12CO/13CO(2-1) line luminosity ratios show\nGalactic values of R21 ~ 5 - 7 in the outskirts and R21 > 20 in the central\nregion, similar to starbursts and (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies ((U)LIRGs;\ni.e. LIRGs and ULIRGs), implying higher temperatures and stronger turbulence.\nAll three sources show indications of 12CO(2-1)/12CO(1-0) ratios of ~ 0.5,\nsuggesting a cold or diffuse gas phase. Strikingly, the 12CO(3-2)/(1-0) ratio\nof ~ 1 also indicates a higher excited phase. Since these galaxies have high\ninfrared luminosities of L_IR > 10^11 L_sun and seem to contain a circumnuclear\nstarburst with minimum surface densities of gas and star formation rate (SFR)\naround {\\Sigma}_mol = 50 - 550 M_sun pc^-2 and {\\Sigma}_SFR = 1.1 - 3.1 M_sun\nkpc^-2 yr^-1, we conclude that the interstellar medium in the centers of these\nLIRG Seyferts is strongly affected by violent star formation and better ...\n", "  Starting from the general definition of a one-loop tensor N-point function,\nwe use its Feynman parametrization to calculate the UV-divergent part of an\narbitrary tensor coefficient in the framework of dimensional regularization. In\ncontrast to existing recursion schemes, we are able to present a general\nanalytic result in closed form that enables direct determination of the\nUV-divergent part of any one-loop tensor N-point coefficient independent from\nUV-divergent parts of other one-loop tensor N-point coefficients. Simplified\nformulas and explicit expressions are presented for A-, B-, C-, D-, E-, and\nF-functions.\n"]}
