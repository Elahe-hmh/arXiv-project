All consistent\ninteractions among the fields have been obtained using the antifield formalism\nthrough several order BRST deformations of the master equation. It is found\nthat the coupling deformations halt exclusively at the second order, whereas\nhigher order deformations are obstructed due to non-local interactions. The\nresults demonstrate the BRST cohomological derivation of the interacting\nYang-Mills theory.\n", "  The physical properties of the single-crystalline samples of Lu_{2} Ir_{3}\nSi_{5} have been investigated by magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and heat\ncapacity studies. We observed multiple charge density wave (CDW) transitions in\nall the measurements. A strong thermal hysteresis at these transitions suggests\na possible first order CDW ordering. In addition, the first order nature is\nascertained by a very narrow and a huge cusp (62 J/mol K) in the zero field\nspecific heat data which also suggests a strong interchain coupling. By\napplying a field of 9T in the specific heat measurement, one of the CDW\ntransitions is suppressed.\n", "  Dynamic model reduction in power systems is necessary for improving\ncomputational efficiency. Traditional model reduction using linearized models\nor online analysis is not adequate to capture dynamic behaviors of the power\nsystem, especially with the new mix of intermittent generation and intelligent\nconsumption making the power system more dynamic and non-linear. Real-time\ndynamic model reduction has emerged to fill this important need. This paper\nexplores using clustering techniques to analyze real-time phasor measurements\nto identify groups of generators with similar behavior, as well as a\nrepresentative generator from each group for dynamic model reduction. Two\nclustering techniques -- graph clustering and k-means -- are considered. These\ntechniques are compared with a previously developed dynamic model reduction\napproach using Singular Value Decomposition. Two sample power grid data sets\nare used to test these different model reduction techniques. Based on the\nalgorithms' relative performance, recommendations are provided for practical\nuse.\n", "  In hypercube approach to correlation functions in Chern-Simons theory (knot\npolynomials) the central role is played by the numbers of cycles, in which the\nlink diagram is decomposed under different resolutions. Certain functions of\nthese numbers are further interpreted as dimensions of graded spaces,\nassociated with hypercube vertices. Finding these functions is, however, a\nsomewhat non-trivial problem. In arXiv:1506.07516 it was suggested to solve it\nwith the help of the matrix model technique, in the spirit of AMM/EO\ntopological recursion. In this paper we further elaborate on this idea and\nprovide a vast collection of non-trivial examples, related both to ordinary and\nvirtual links and knots. Remarkably, most powerful versions of the formalism\nfreely convert ordinary knots/links to virtual and back -- moreover, go beyond\nthe knot-related set of the (2,2)-valent graphs.\n", "  We calculate the bosonic boundary state corresponding to a moving fractional\nD$p$-brane in a partially orbifoldized spacetime $\\mathbb{R}^{1, d-5}\n\\times\\mathbb{C}^{2}/\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ in the presence of the Kalb-Ramond field,\nthe $U(1)$ gauge potential and the tachyon field. Using this boundary state we\nobtain interaction amplitude of two parallel moving D$p$-branes with the above\nbackground fields. Various properties of the interaction will be investigated.\nBesides, we study effects of the tachyon condensation on a moving fractional\nD$p$-brane with the above background fields through the boundary state\nformalism.\n", "  Accuracy of the Kramers approximate formula for the thermal decay rate of the\nmetastable state is studied for the two-dimensional potential pocket. This is\ndone by the comparison with the quasistationary rate resulting from the\ndynamical modeling. It is shown that the Kramers rate is in agreement with the\nquasistationary rate within the statistical errors provided the absorptive\nborder is far enough from the potential ridge restricting the metastable state.\nAs the absorptive border (or its part) gets closer to the ridge the Kramers\nformula underestimate the quasistationary rate. The difference reaches\napproximately the factor of 2 when the absorptive border coincides with the\nridge.\n", "  In this paper we investigate measures of chaos and entanglement in rational\nconformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions. First, we derive a universal\nformula for the late time value of the out-of-time-ordered correlators for this\nclass of theories. Our universal result can be expressed as a particular\ncombination of the modular S-matrix elements known as the anyon monodromy\nscalar. Next, in the explicit setup of a $SU(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, we\ncompare the late time behavior of the out-of-time-ordered correlators and the\npurity. Interestingly, in the large-c limit, the purity grows logarithmically\nas in holographic theories; in contrast, the out-of-time-ordered correlators\nremain, in general, non-vanishing.\n", "  The hydrogen atom is a system amenable to an exact treatment within\nSchroedinger's formulation of quantum mechanics according to coordinates in\nfour systems -- spherical polar, paraboloidal, ellipsoidal and spheroconical\ncoordinates; the latter solution is reported for the first time. Applications\nof these solutions include angular momenta, a quantitative calculation of the\nabsorption spectrum and accurate plots of surfaces of amplitude functions. The\nshape of an amplitude function, and even the quantum numbers in a particular\nset to specify such an individual function, depend on the coordinates in a\nparticular chosen system, and are therefore artefacts of that particular\ncoordinate representation within wave mechanics. All discussion of atomic or\nmolecular properties based on such shapes or quantum numbers therefore lacks\ngeneral significance\n", "  Consideration is given to the effects of inhomogeneous shear flow (both\nregular and chaotic) on nematic liquid crystals in a planar geometry. The\nLandau--de Gennes equation coupled to an externally-prescribed flow field is\nthe basis for the study: this is solved numerically in a periodic spatial\ndomain. The focus is on a limiting case where the advection is passive, such\nthat variations in the liquid-crystal properties do not feed back into the\nequation for the fluid velocity. The main tool for analyzing the results (both\nwith and without flow) is the identification of the fixed points of the\ndynamical equations without flow, which are relevant (to varying degrees) when\nflow is introduced. The fixed points are classified as stable/unstable and\nfurther as either uniaxial or biaxial. Accordingly, various models of passive\nshear flow are investigated, with the main focus being on the case where\ntumbling is absent from the model. In this scenario, not only must advection of\nthe $Q$-tensor be considered, but also its co-rotation relative to the local\nvorticity field. Thus, only the biaxial fixed point survives as a solution of\nthe $Q$-tensor dynamics under the imposition of a general flow field. For\ncertain flows for which co-rotation effects can effectively be ignored along\ntrajectories, both families of fixed points survive. In this scenario, the\nsystem exhibits coarsening arrest, whereby the liquid-crystal domains are\n`frozen in' to the flow structures and the growth in their size is thus\nlimited. The outcome (biaxial final state or a mixture of both families of\nfixed points) can be understood in terms of the flow time- and length-scales\nthat manifest themselves through the co-rotational derivative. Some\nconsideration is also given to the specific case where tumbling is present;\nhere, the flow has a strong effect on the liquid-crystal morphology.\n", "  The relationship between the Yang-Mills equations and the stochastic analogue\nof Levy differential operators is studied. The value of the stochastic Levy\nLaplacian is found by means of Cesaro averaging of directional derivatives on\nthe stochastic parallel transport. It is shown that the Yang-Mills equations\nand the Levy-Laplace equation for such Laplacian are not equivalent as in the\ndeterministic case. An equation equivalent to the Yang-Mills equations is\nobtained. The equation contains the stochastic Levy divergence. It is proved\nthat the Yang-Mills action functional can be represented as an\ninfinite-dimensional analogue of the Direchlet functional of chiral field. This\nanalogue is also derived using Cesaro averaging.\n", "  In steady sediment transport, sediment deposition is balanced by entrainment\nof bed particles by fluid forces or particle-bed impacts. Here we propose a\nproxy to determine the role of impact entrainment relative to entrainment by\nthe mean turbulent flow: the \"bed velocity\" $V_b$, which is an effective\nnear-bed-surface value of the average horizontal particle velocity that\ngeneralizes the classical slip velocity, used in studies of aeolian saltation\ntransport, to sediment transport in an arbitrary Newtonian fluid. We study\n$V_b$ for a wide range of the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, Galileo number\n$\\mathrm{Ga}$, and Shields number $\\Theta$ using direct sediment transport\nsimulations. We find that transport is fully sustained through impact\nentrainment (i.e., $V_b$ is constant in natural units) when the \"impact number\"\n$\\mathrm{Im}=\\mathrm{Ga}\\sqrt{s+0.5}\\gtrsim20$ or $\\Theta\\gtrsim5/\\mathrm{Im}$.\nThese conditions are obeyed for the vast majority of transport regimes,\nincluding steady turbulent bedload, which has long been thought to be sustained\nsolely through fluid entrainment. In fact, we find that transport is fully\nsustained through fluid entrainment (i.e., $V_b$ scales with the near-bed\nhorizontal fluid velocity) only for sufficiently viscous bedload transport at\ngrain scale (i.e., for $\\mathrm{Im}\\lesssim20$ and\n$\\Theta\\lesssim1/\\mathrm{Im}$). Finally, we do not find a strong correlation\nbetween, $V_b$, or the classical slip velocity, and the\ntransport-layer-averaged horizontal particle velocity $\\overline{v_x}$, which\nchallenges the long-standing consensus that predominant impact entrainment is\nresponsible for a linear scaling of the transport rate with $\\Theta$. For\nturbulent bedload in particular, $\\overline{v_x}$ increases with $\\Theta$\ndespite $V_b$ remaining constant, which we propose is linked to the formation\nof a liquid-like bed on top of the static-bed surface.\n", "  We investigate the radial part of the charged massive Klein-Gordon equation\nin Kerr-Newman spacetime, and in several specific situations, obtain exact\nsolutions by means of essentially hypergeometric functions or their confluent\ntypes. Using these global solutions and generally obtained local solutions, we\ncalculate a sort of intensity of the collision of two field excitations, which\nis a slight generalization of the trace of the stress tensor. We find that when\nthe black hole is nonextremal, the intensity of the collision of two ingoing\nmodes is bounded. However, in the extremal limit, more precisely $\\hbar\n\\kappa_H \\rightarrow 0$, the upper bound grows so that when the frequency of\none of the two modes satisfies the critical relation, the intensity of the\ncollision at the horizon becomes unboundedly large. Furthermore, the intensity\nof the collision of ingoing and outgoing modes is always unbounded, as well as\nin the classical particle theory. Our results suggest that the BSW effect is\ninherited by the quantum theory.\n", "  Complex band structure generalizes conventional band structure by also\nconsidering wavevectors with complex components. In this way, complex band\nstructure describes both the bulk-propagating states from conventional band\nstructure and the evanescent states that grow or decay from one unit cell to\nthe next. Even though these latter states are excluded by translational\nsymmetry, they become important when translational symmetry is broken via, for\nexample, a surface or impurity.\n  Many studies over the last 80 years have directly or indirectly developed\ncomplex band structure for an impressive range of applications, but very few\ndiscuss its fundamentals or compare its various results. In this work we build\nupon these previous efforts to expose the physical foundation of complex band\nstructure, which mathematically implies the existence of complex band\nstructure. We find that a material's static and dynamic electronic structure\nare both completely described by complex band structure. Furthermore, we show\nthat complex band structure reflects the minimal, intrinsic information\ncontained in the material's Hamiltonian. These realizations then provide a\ncontext for discussing, comparing, and unifying the different formulations and\napplications of complex band structure that have been developed over the years.\nUltimately, this discussion introduces the idea of examining the amount of\ninformation contained in a material's Hamiltonian so that we can find and\nexploit the minimal information necessary for understanding a material's\nproperties.\n", "  In this work, we show a phenomenological alloy-like fit of the thermal\nconductivity of (A)d1:(B)d2 superlattices with d1 /= d2, i.e. non-symmetric\nstructure. The presented method is a generalization of the Norbury rule of the\nsummation of thermal resistivities in alloy compounds. Namely, we show that\nthis approach can be also extended to describe the thermal properties of\ncrystalline and ordered-system composed by two or more elements, and, has a\npotentially much wider application range. Using this approximation we estimate\nthat the interface thermal resistance depends on the period and the ratio of\nmaterials that form the superlattice structure\n", "  We investigate the phenomenon of optical bistability in a driven ensemble of\nRydberg atoms. By performing two experiments with thermal vapors of rubidium\nand cesium, we are able to shed light onto the underlying interaction\nmechanisms causing such a non-linear behavior. Due to the different properties\nof these two atomic species, we conclude that the large polarizability of\nRydberg states in combination with electric fields of spontaneously ionized\nRydberg atoms is the relevant interaction mechanism. In the case of rubidium,\nwe directly measure the electric field in a bistable situation via two-species\nspectroscopy. In cesium, we make use of the different sign of the\npolarizability for different l-states and the possibility of applying electric\nfields. Both these experiments allow us to rule out dipole-dipole interactions,\nand support our hypothesis of a charge-induced bistability.\n", "  We formulate an algebraic criterion for the presence of global anomalies on\nglobally hyperbolic space-times in the framework of locally covariant field\ntheory. We discuss some consequences and check that it reproduces the\nwell-known global $SU(2)$ anomaly in four space-time dimensions.\n", "  We investigate the relation between the classical ergodicity and the quantum\neigenstate thermalization in the fully connected Ising ferromagnets. In the\ncase of spin-1/2, an expectation value of an observable in a single energy\neigenstate coincides with the long-time average in the underlying classical\ndynamics, which is a consequence of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\napproximation. In the case of spin-1, the underlying classical dynamics is not\nnecessarily ergodic. In that case, it turns out that, in the thermodynamic\nlimit, the statistics of the expectation values of an observable in the energy\neigenstates coincides with the statistics of the long-time averages in the\nunderlying classical dynamics starting from random initial states sampled\nuniformly from the classical phase space. This feature seems to be a general\nproperty in semiclassical systems, and the result presented here is crucial in\ndiscussing equilibration, thermalization, and dynamical transitions of such\nsystems.\n", "  We report results of a magnetic characterization of\n[Cu$_{30}$Ni$_{70}$(6nm)]$_{20}$ (x=1-7nm) superlattices using Polarized\nNeutron Reflectometry (PNR) and SQUID magnetometry. The study has shown that\nthe magnetic moment of the structures growths almost linearly from H = 0 to\nH$_{sat}$ = 1.3kOe which is an indirect evidence of antiferromagnetic (AF)\ncoupling of the magnetic moments in neighbouring layers. PNR, however, did not\ndetect any in-plane AF coupling. Taking into account the out-of-plane easy axis\nof the Cu$_{30}$Ni$_{70}$ layers, this may mean that only the out-of-plane\ncomponent of the magnetic moments are AF coupled.\n", "  SrRuO$_3$ heterostructures grown in the (111) direction are a rare example of\nthin film ferromagnets. By means of density functional theory plus dynamical\nmean field theory we show that the half-metallic ferromagnetic state with an\nordered magnetic moment of 2$\\mu_{B}$/Ru survives the ultimate dimensional\nconfinement down to a bilayer, even at elevated temperatures of 500$\\,$K. In\nthe minority channel, the spin-orbit coupling opens a gap at the linear band\ncrossing corresponding to $\\frac34$ filling of the $t_{2g}$ shell. We\ndemonstrate that the respective state is Haldane's quantum anomalous Hall state\nwith Chern number $C$=1, without an external magnetic field or magnetic\nimpurities.\n", "  Galaxy mergers are believed to play a key role in transforming star-forming\ndisk galaxies into quenched ellipticals. Most of our theoretical knowledge\nabout such morphological transformations does, however, rely on idealised\nsimulations where processes such as cooling of hot halo gas into the disk and\ngas accretion in the post-merger phase are not treated in a self-consistent\ncosmological fashion. In this paper we study the morphological evolution of the\nstellar components of four major mergers occurring at z=0.5 in cosmological\nhydrodynamical zoom-simulations. In all simulations the merger reduces the disk\nmass-fraction, but all galaxies simulated at our highest resolution regrow a\nsignificant disk by z=0 (with a disk fraction larger than 24%). For runs with\nour default physics model, which includes galactic winds from star formation\nand black hole feedback, none of the merger remnants are quenched, but in a set\nof simulations with stronger black hole feedback we find that major mergers can\nindeed quench galaxies. We conclude that major merger remnants commonly evolve\ninto star-forming disk galaxies, unless sufficiently strong AGN feedback\nassists in the quenching of the remnant.\n", "  We present an algorithm for error correction in topological codes that\nexploits modern machine learning techniques. Our decoder is constructed from a\nstochastic neural network called a Boltzmann machine, of the type extensively\nused in deep learning. We provide a general prescription for the training of\nthe network and a decoding strategy that is applicable to a wide variety of\nstabilizer codes with very little specialization. We demonstrate the neural\ndecoder numerically on the well-known two dimensional toric code with\nphase-flip errors.\n", "  A physics-first derivation of the Schwarzschild metric is given. Gravitation\nis described in terms of the effects of tidal forces (or of spacetime\ncurvature) on the volume of a small ball of test particles (a dust ball),\nfreely falling after all particles were at rest with respect to each other\ninitially. The possibility to express Einstein's equation this way and some of\nits ramifications have been enjoyably discussed by Baez and Bunn [Am. J. Phys.\n73, 644 (2005)]. Since the formulation avoids the use of tensors, neither\nadvanced tensor calculus nor sophisticated differential geometry are needed in\nthe calculation. The derivation is not lengthy and it has visual appeal, so it\nmay be useful in teaching.\n", "  Establishing entanglement between distant parties is one of the most\nimportant problems of quantum technology, since long-distance entanglement is\nan essential part of such fundamental tasks as quantum cryptography or quantum\nteleportation. In this lecture we review basic properties of entanglement and\nquantum discord, and discuss recent results on entanglement distribution and\nthe role of quantum discord therein. We also review entanglement distribution\nwith separable states, and discuss important problems which still remain open.\nOne such open problem is a possible advantage of indirect entanglement\ndistribution, when compared to direct distribution protocols.\n", "  Starting from a successful model of the pi-meson electromagnetic form factor,\nwe calculate the similar form factor, f_K(Q^2), of the charged K meson for a\nwide range of the momentum transfer squared, Q^2. The only remaining free\nparameter is to be determined from the measurements of the K-meson charge\nradius, r_K. We fit this single parameter to the published data of the NA-7\nexperiment which measured f_K(Q^2) at Q^2->0 and determine our preferred range\nof r_K, which happens to be close to recent lattice results. Still, the\naccuracy in the determination of r_K is poor. However, future measurements of\nthe K-meson electromagnetic form factor at Q^2<~5.5 GeV^2, scheduled in\nJefferson Laboratory for 2017, will test our approach and will reduce the\nuncertainty in r_K significantly.\n", "  We initiate a holographic study of coupling-dependent heavy ion collisions by\nanalysing for the first time the effects of leading-order, inverse coupling\nconstant corrections. In the dual description, this amounts to colliding\ngravitational shock waves in a theory with curvature-squared terms. We find\nthat at intermediate coupling, nuclei experience less stopping and have more\nenergy deposited near the lightcone. When the decreased coupling results in an\n80% larger shear viscosity, the time at which hydrodynamics becomes a good\ndescription of the plasma created from high energy collisions increases by 25%.\nThe hydrodynamic phase of the evolution starts with a wider rapidity profile\nand smaller entropy.\n", "  Spectral properties of nuclei near the critical point of the quantum phase\ntransition between spherical and axially symmetric shapes are studied in a\nhybrid collective model which combines the $\\gamma$-stable and $\\gamma$-rigid\ncollective conditions through a rigidity parameter. The model in the lower and\nupper limits of the rigidity parameter recovers the X(5) and X(3) solutions\nrespectively, while in the equally mixed case it corresponds to the X(4)\ncritical point symmetry. Numerical applications of the model on nuclei from\nregions known for critical behavior reveal a sizable shape phase mixing and its\nevolution with neutron or proton numbers. The model also enables a better\ndescription of energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions for these nuclei.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a new scheme for the efficient numerical\ntreatment of the electronic Schr\\\"odinger equation for molecules. It is based\non the combination of a many-body expansion, which corresponds to the so-called\nbond order dissection Anova approach, with a hierarchy of basis sets of\nincreasing order. Here, the energy is represented as a finite sum of\ncontributions associated to subsets of nuclei and basis sets in a telescoping\nsum like fashion. Under the assumption of data locality of the electronic\ndensity (nearsightedness of electronic matter), the terms of this expansion\ndecay rapidly and higher terms may be neglected. We further extend the approach\nin a dimension-adaptive fashion to generate quasi-optimal approximations, i.e.\na specific truncation of the hierarchical series such that the total benefit is\nmaximized for a fixed amount of costs. This way, we are able to achieve\nsubstantial speed up factors compared to conventional first principles methods\ndepending on the molecular system under consideration. In particular, the\nmethod can deal efficiently with molecular systems which include only a small\nactive part that needs to be described by accurate but expensive models.\n", "  The Dirac equation on the toroidal surface is studied. The non-constant Fermi\nvelocity functions are used in the Dirac Hamiltonian to get trigonometric Scarf\nand Rosen-Morse potentials using the method given in [19], then, the exact\nsolutions are written. On the other hand, consecutive mappings are used to get\na trigonometric Scarf I-like potential model and the solutions are obtained in\nthe second part of the paper.\n", "  We present protocols for the generation of high-dimensional entangled states\nof anharmonic oscillators by means of coherent manipulation of light-matter\nsystems in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Our protocols consider a pair of\nultrastrong coupled qubit-cavity systems, each coupled to an ancilla qubit, and\ncombine classical pulses plus the selection rules imposed by the parity\nsymmetry. We study the robustness of the entangling protocols under dissipative\neffects. This proposal may have applications within state-of-art circuit\nquantum electrodynamics.\n", "  We update our recently published model for GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly\n(GAEA), to include a self-consistent treatment of the partition of cold gas in\natomic and molecular hydrogen. Our model provides significant improvements with\nrespect to previous ones used for similar studies. In particular, GAEA (i)\nincludes a sophisticated chemical enrichment scheme accounting for\nnon-instantaneous recycling of gas, metals, and energy; (ii) reproduces the\nmeasured evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function; (iii) reasonably\nreproduces the observed correlation between galaxy stellar mass and gas\nmetallicity at different redshifts. These are important prerequisites for\nmodels considering a metallicity dependent efficiency of molecular gas\nformation. We also update our model for disk sizes and show that model\npredictions are in nice agreement with observational estimates for the gas,\nstellar and star forming disks at different cosmic epochs. We analyse the\ninfluence of different star formation laws including empirical relations based\non the hydro-static pressure of the disk, analytic models, and prescriptions\nderived from detailed hydro-dynamical simulations. We find that modifying the\nstar formation law does not affect significantly the global properties of model\ngalaxies, neither their distributions. The only quantity showing significant\ndeviations in different models is the cosmic molecular-to-atomic hydrogen\nratio, particularly at high redshift. Unfortunately, however, this quantity\nalso depends strongly on the modelling adopted for additional physical\nprocesses. Useful constraints on the physical processes regulating star\nformation can be obtained focusing on low mass galaxies and/or at higher\nredshift. In this case, self-regulation has not yet washed out differences\nimprinted at early time.\n", "  A Regge approach to the reaction processes $\\gamma p\\to\\pi^-\\Delta^{++}$ and\n$\\gamma p\\to\\pi^+\\Delta^0$ is presented for the description of existing data up\nto $E_\\gamma= 16$ GeV. The model consists of the $t$-channel\n$\\pi(139)+\\rho(775)+a_2(1320)$ exchanges which are reggeized from the relevant\nBorn amplitude. Discussion is given on the minimal gauge prescription for the\n$\\pi$ exchange to render convergent the divergence of the $u$-channel\n$\\Delta$-pole in the former process. A new Lagrangian is constructed for the\n$a_2N\\Delta$ coupling in this work and applied to the process for the first\ntime with the coupling constant deduced from the duality plus vector dominance.\nIt is shown that, while the $\\pi$ exchange dominates over the process, the role\nof the $a_2$ exchange is crucial rather than the $\\rho$ in reproducing the\ncross sections for total, differential, and photon polarization asymmetry to\nagree with data at high energy.\n", "  Universality is key to the theory of phase transition stating that the\nequilibrium properties of observables near a phase transition can be classified\naccording to few critical exponents. These exponents rule an universal scaling\nbehaviour that witnesses the irrelevance of the model's microscopic details at\ncriticality. Here we discuss the persistence of such a scaling in a\none-dimensional quantum Ising model under sinusoidal modulation in time of its\ntransverse magnetic field. We show that scaling of various quantities\n(concurrence, entanglement entropy, magnetic and fidelity susceptibility)\nendures up to a stroboscopic time $\\tau_{bd}$, proportional to the size of the\nsystem. This behaviour is explained by noticing that the low-energy modes,\nresponsible for the scaling properties, are resilient to the absorption of\nenergy. Our results suggest that relevant features of the universality do hold\nalso when the system is brought out-of-equilibrium by a periodic driving.\n", "  We report synthesis of polycrystalline samples of the recently discovered\nspin liquid material Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ and present measurements of the\nambient and high pressure magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ versus temperature\n$T$, magnetization $M$ versus magnetic field $H$ at various $T$, and heat\ncapacity $C$ versus $T$ at various $H$. The ambient pressure magnetic\nmeasurements indicate the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nexchange interactions with dominant ferromagnetic interactions and with the\nlargest magnetic energy scale $\\sim 10$~K\\@. The $\\chi(T)$ measurements under\nexternally applied pressure of up to $P \\approx 1$~GPa indicate the robust\nnature of the spin-liquid state despite relative increase in the ferromagnetic\nexchanges. $C(T)$ shows a broad anomaly at $T\\approx 2.5$~K which moves to\nhigher temperatures in a magnetic field. The evolution of the low temperature\n$C(T,H)$ and the magnetic entropy is consistent with frustrated magnetism in\nCa$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$.\n", "  We prove a generalization of the quantum de Finetti theorem when the local\nspace is an infinite-dimensional Fock space. In particular, instead of\nconsidering the action of the permutation group on $n$ copies of that space, we\nconsider the action of the unitary group $U(n)$ on the creation operators of\nthe $n$ modes and define a natural generalization of the symmetric subspace as\nthe space of states invariant under unitaries in $U(n)$. Our first result is a\ncomplete characterization of this subspace, which turns out to be spanned by a\nfamily of generalized coherent states related to the special unitary group\n$SU(p,q)$ of signature $(p,q)$. More precisely, this construction yields a\nunitary representation of the noncompact simple real Lie group $SU(p,q)$. We\ntherefore find a dual unitary representation of the pair of groups $U(n)$ and\n$SU(p,q)$ on an $n(p+q)$-mode Fock space.\n  The (Gaussian) $SU(p,q)$ coherent states resolve the identity on the\nsymmetric subspace, which implies a Gaussian de Finetti theorem stating that\ntracing over a few modes of a unitary-invariant state yields a state close to a\nmixture of Gaussian states. As an application of this de Finetti theorem, we\nshow that the $n\\times n$ upper-left submatrix of an $n\\times n$ Haar-invariant\nunitary matrix is close in total variation distance to a matrix of independent\nnormal variables if $n^3 =O(m)$.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of a charged particle (e.g., an electron)\noscillating in a laser field in flat spacetime and describe it in terms of the\nvariable mass metric. By applying Einstein's equivalence principle, we show\nthat, after representing the electron motion in a time-dependent manner, the\nvariable mass metric takes the form of the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We quantize a massive complex\nscalar or pseudo-scalar field in this spacetime and derive the production rate\nof electrically neutral, spinless particle-antiparticle pairs. We show that\nthis approach can provide an alternative experimental method to axion searches.\n", "  Correlations born before the onset of hydrodynamic flow can leave observable\ntraces on the final state particles. Measurement of these correlations can\nyield important information on the isotropization and thermalization process.\nStarting from a Boltzmann-like kinetic theory in the presence of dynamic\nLangevin noise, we derive a new partial differential equation for the\ntwo-particle correlation function that respects the microscopic conservation\nlaws. We illustrate how this equation can be used to study the effect of\nthermalization on long range correlations.\n", "  Approximate bound state solutions of the spinless Salpeter equation for the\nHellmann potential are studied for heavy particles. By using functional\nanalysis method, an analytical expression for the energy levels, and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions of the system are obtained in terms of the\nhypergeometric functions. The analytical results for the Yukawa and Coulomb\npotentials are also studied as special cases.\n", "  The effect of atom losses on a homogeneous one-dimensional Bose gas lying\nwithin the quasi-condensate regime is investigated using a Monte Carlo\nwavefunction approach. The evolution of the system is calculated, conditioned\nby the loss sequence, namely the times of individual losses and the position of\nthe removed atoms. We describe the gas within the linearized Bogoliubov\napproach. For each mode, we find that, for a given quantum trajectory, the\nstate of the system converges towards a coherent state, i.e. the ground state,\ndisplaced in phase space. Provided losses are recorded with a temporal and\nspatially resolved detector, we show that quantum feedback can be implemented\nand cooling to the ground state of one or several modes can be realized.\n", "  Destructive quantum interference in electron transport through molecules\nprovides an unconventional route for suppressing electric current. In this work\nwe introduce \"interference vectors\" for each interference and use them to\ncharacterize the interference. An interference vector may be an orbital of the\nbare molecule, in which case the interference is very sensitive to\nperturbation. In contrast, an interference vector may be a combination of\nmultiple molecular orbitals, leading to more robust interference that is\nlikelier to be experimentally observable. Our characterization scheme\nquantifies these two possibilities through the degree of rotation and also\nassigns an order to each interference that describes the shape of the\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker transmission function around the interference. Several\nexamples are then presented, showcasing the generality of our theory and\ncharacterization scheme, which is not limited to specific classes of molecules\nor particular molecule-electrode coupling patterns.\n", "  Accurate prediction of the electronic and hydrogen storage properties of\nlinear carbon chains (Cn) and Li-terminated linear carbon chains (Li2Cn), with\nn carbon atoms (n = 5 - 10), has been very challenging for traditional\nelectronic structure methods, due to the presence of strong static correlation\neffects. To meet the challenge, we study these properties using our newly\ndeveloped thermally-assisted-occupation density functional theory (TAO-DFT), a\nvery efficient electronic structure method for the study of large systems with\nstrong static correlation effects. Owing to the alteration of the reactivity of\nCn and Li2Cn with n, odd-even oscillations in their electronic properties are\nfound. In contrast to Cn, the binding energies of H2 molecules on Li2Cn are in\n(or close to) the ideal binding energy range (about 20 to 40 kJ/mol per H2). In\naddition, the H2 gravimetric storage capacities of Li2Cn are in the range of\n10.7 to 17.9 wt%, satisfying the United States Department of Energy (USDOE)\nultimate target of 7.5 wt%. On the basis of our results, Li2Cn can be\nhigh-capacity hydrogen storage materials for reversible hydrogen uptake and\nrelease at near-ambient conditions.\n", "  Efficient bacterial chromosome segregation typically requires the coordinated\naction of a three-components, fueled by adenosine triphosphate machinery called\nthe partition complex. We present a phenomenological model accounting for the\ndynamic activity of this system. The model is obtained by coupling simple\nlinear reaction-diffusion equations with a proteophoresis, or \"volumetric\"\nchemophoresis, force field. This minimal description, in the sense of Occam's\nRazor principle, captures most known experimental observations: dynamic\noscillations of complex components, complex separation and subsequent\nsymmetrical positioning. The predictions of our model are in phenomenological\nagreement with and provide substantial insights into recent experiments. From a\nnon-linear physics view point, this system explores the active separation of\nmatter at micrometric scales with a dynamical instability between static\npositioning and travelling wave regimes.\n", "  Approximate but reliable solutions of a quantum system with $N$ identical\nparticles can be easily computed with the envelope theory, also known as the\nauxiliary field method. This technique has been developed for Hamiltonians with\narbitrary kinematics and one- or two-body potentials. It is adapted here for\ncyclic systems with $N$ identical particles, that is to say systems in which a\nparticle $i$ has only an interaction with particles $i-1$ and $i+1$ (with\n$N+1\\equiv 1$).\n", "  Taking all the magnon modes into account, we derive the skyrmion dynamics in\nresponse to a weak external drive. A skyrmion has rotational symmetry and the\nmagnon modes can be characterized by an angular momentum. For a weak distortion\nof a skyrmion, only the magnon modes with an angular momentum $|m|=1$ govern\nthe dynamics of skyrmion topological center. The skyrmion inertia is determined\nby the magnon modes in the continuum spectrum. For a skyrmion driven by a\nmagnetic field gradient or by a spin transfer torque generated by a current,\nthe dynamical response is practically instantaneous. This justifies the rigid\nskyrmion approximation used in Thiele's collective coordinate approach. For a\nskyrmion driven by a spin Hall torque, the torque couples to the skyrmion\nmotion through the magnons in the continuum and damping, therefore the skyrmion\ndynamics shows sizable inertia in this case. The trajectory of a skyrmion is an\nellipse for an ac drive of spin Hall torque.\n", "  Increased reflectance from the inclusion of highly scattering particles at\nlow volume fractions in an insulating dielectric offers a promising way to\nreduce radiative thermal losses at high temperatures. Here, we investigate\nplasmonic resonance driven enhanced scattering from microinclusions of\nlow-bandgap semiconductors (InP, Si, Ge, PbS, InAs and Te) in an insulating\ncomposite to tailor its infrared reflectance for minimizing thermal losses from\nradiative transfer. To this end, we compute the spectral properties of the\nmicrocomposites using Monte Carlo modeling and compare them with results from\nFresnel equations. The role of particle size-dependent Mie scattering and\nabsorption efficiencies, and, scattering anisotropy are studied to identify the\noptimal microinclusion size and material parameters for maximizing the\nreflectance of the thermal radiation. For composites with Si and Ge\nmicroinclusions we obtain reflectance efficiencies of 57 - 65% for the incident\nblackbody radiation from sources at temperatures in the range 400 - 1600\n{\\deg}C. Furthermore, we observe a broadbanding of the reflectance spectra from\nthe plasmonic resonances due to charge carriers generated from defect states\nwithin the semiconductor bandgap. Our results thus open up the possibility of\ndeveloping efficient high-temperature thermal insulators through use of the\nlow-bandgap semiconductor microinclusions in insulating dielectrics.\n", "  Both classical and quantum waves can form vortices: with helical phase fronts\nand azimuthal current densities. These features determine the intrinsic orbital\nangular momentum carried by localized vortex states. In the past 25 years,\noptical vortex beams have become an inherent part of modern optics, with many\nremarkable achievements and applications. In the past decade, it has been\nrealized and demonstrated that such vortex beams or wavepackets can also appear\nin free electron waves, in particular, in electron microscopy. Interest in\nfree-electron vortex states quickly spread over different areas of physics:\nfrom basic aspects of quantum mechanics, via applications for fine probing of\nmatter (including individual atoms), to high-energy particle collision and\nradiation processes. Here we provide a comprehensive review of theoretical and\nexperimental studies in this emerging field of research. We describe the main\nproperties of electron vortex states, experimental achievements and possible\napplications within transmission electron microscopy, as well as the possible\nrole of vortex electrons in relativistic and high-energy processes. We aim to\nprovide a balanced description including a pedagogical introduction, solid\ntheoretical basis, and a wide range of practical details. Special attention is\npaid to translate theoretical insights into suggestions for future experiments,\nin electron microscopy and beyond, in any situation where free electrons occur.\n", "  Given a partition of a large system into an active quantum mechanical (QM)\nregion and its environment, we present a simple way of embedding the QM region\ninto an effective electrostatic potential representing the environment. This\npotential is generated by partitioning the environment into well defined\nfragments, and assigning each one a set of electrostatic multipoles, which can\nthen be used to build up the electrostatic potential. We show that, providing\nthe fragments and the projection scheme for the multipoles are chosen properly,\nthis leads to an effective electrostatic embedding of the active QM region\nwhich is of equal quality as a full QM calculation. We coupled our formalism to\nthe DFT code BigDFT, which uses a minimal set of localized in-situ optimized\nbasis functions; this property eases the fragment definition while still\ndescribing the electronic structure with great precision. Thanks to the linear\nscaling capabilities of BigDFT, we can compare the modeling of the\nelectrostatic embedding with results coming from unbiased full QM calculations\nof the entire system. This enables a reliable and controllable setup of an\neffective coarse-graining approach, coupling together different levels of\ndescription, which yields a considerable reduction in the degrees of freedom\nand thus paves the way towards efficient QM/QM and QM/MM methods for the\ntreatment of very large systems.\n", "  We introduce a wavefront shaping protocol for focusing inside disordered\nmedia based on a generalization of the established Wigner-Smith time-delay\noperator. The key ingredient for our approach is the scattering (or\ntransmission) matrix of the medium and its derivative with respect to the\nposition of the target one aims to focus on. A specifc experimental realization\nin the microwave regime is presented showing that the eigenstates of a\ncorresponding operator are sorted by their focusing strength - ranging from\nstrongly focusing on the designated target to completely bypassing it. Our\nprotocol works without optimization or phase-conjugation and we expect it to be\nparticularly attractive for optical imaging in disordered media.\n", "  We propose a laser-controlled plasma shutter technique to generate sharp\nlaser pulses using a process analogous to electromagnetically-induced\ntransparency in atoms. The shutter is controlled by a laser with moderately\nstrong intensity, which induces a transparency window below the cutoff\nfrequency, and hence enables propagation of a low frequency laser pulse.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate it is possible to generate a sharp pulse\nwavefront (sub-ps) using two broad pulses in high density plasma. The technique\ncan work in a regime that is not accessible by plasma mirrors when the pulse\npedestals are stronger than the ionization intensity.\n", "  Recent years have seen significant advances in the study of symmetric\ninformationally complete (SIC) quantum measurements, also known as maximal sets\nof complex equiangular lines. Previously, the published record contained\nsolutions up to dimension 67, and was with high confidence complete up through\ndimension 50. Computer calculations have now furnished solutions in all\ndimensions up to 151, and in several cases beyond that, as large as dimension\n844. These new solutions exhibit an additional type of symmetry beyond the\nbasic definition of a SIC, and so verify a conjecture of Zauner in many new\ncases. The solutions in dimensions 68 through 121 were obtained by Andrew\nScott, and his catalogue of distinct solutions is, with high confidence,\ncomplete up to dimension 90. Additional results in dimensions 122 through 151\nwere calculated by the authors using Scott's code. We recap the history of the\nproblem, outline how the numerical searches were done, and pose some\nconjectures on how the search technique could be improved. In order to\nfacilitate communication across disciplinary boundaries, we also present a\ncomprehensive bibliography of SIC research.\n", "  In this work, we propose refinements to the difference-smoothing algorithm\nfor measurement of time delay from the light curves of the images of a\ngravitationally lensed quasar. The refinements mainly consist of a more\npragmatic approach to choose the smoothing time-scale free parameter,\ngeneration of more realistic synthetic light curves for estimation of time\ndelay uncertainty and using a plot of normalized $\\chi^2$ computed over a wide\nrange of trial time delay values to assess the reliability of a measured time\ndelay and also for identifying instances of catastrophic failure. We rigorously\ntested the difference-smoothing algorithm on a large sample of more than\nthousand pairs of simulated light curves having known true time delays between\nthem from the two most difficult `rungs' -- rung3 and rung4 -- of the first\nedition of Strong Lens Time Delay Challenge (TDC1) and found an inherent\ntendency of the algorithm to measure the magnitude of time delay to be higher\nthan the true value of time delay. However, we find that this systematic bias\nis eliminated by applying a correction to each measured time delay according to\nthe magnitude and sign of the systematic error inferred by applying the time\ndelay estimator on synthetic light curves simulating the measured time delay.\nFollowing these refinements, the TDC performance metrics for the\ndifference-smoothing algorithm are found to be competitive with those of the\nbest performing submissions of TDC1 for both the tested `rungs'. The MATLAB\ncodes used in this work and the detailed results are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/rathnakumars/difference-smoothing\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations provide one of the more powerful and\nversatile numerical approaches to condensed matter systems. However, their\napplication to frustrated quantum spin models, in all relevant temperature\nregimes, is hamstrung by the infamous \"sign problem.\" Here we exploit the fact\nthat the sign problem is basis-dependent. Recent studies have shown that\npassing to a dimer (two-site) basis eliminates the sign problem completely for\na fully frustrated spin model on the two-leg ladder. We generalize this result\nto all partially frustrated two-leg spin-1/2 ladders, meaning those where the\ndiagonal and leg couplings take any antiferromagnetic values. We find that,\nalthough the sign problem does reappear, it remains remarkably mild throughout\nthe entire phase diagram. We explain this result and apply it to perform\nefficient quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated ladders, obtaining\naccurate results for thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetic specific\nheat and susceptibility of ladders up to L=200 rungs (400 spins 1/2) and down\nto very low temperatures.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the coexistences of lamellar phases both in\nbinary and ternary surfactant solutions. The previous free energy of a lamellar\nstack is extended to take into account the translational entropy of membrane\nsegments. The obtained phase diagram for binary surfactant solutions\n(surfactant/water mixtures) shows a phase separation between two lamellar\nphases and also exhibits a critical point. For lamellar phases in ternary\nsurfactant solutions (surfactant/surfactant/water mixtures), we explore\npossible phase behaviors and show that the phase diagrams exhibit various\nthree-phase regions as well as two-phase regions in which different lamellar\nphases coexist. We also find that finite surface tension suppresses undulation\nfluctuations of membranes and leads to a wider three-phase and two-phase\ncoexistence regions.\n", "  We use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and\nelectronic structure calculations to study the electronic properties of\nrare-earth monoantimonides RSb (R = Y, Ce, Gd, Dy, Ho, Tm, Lu). The\nexperimentally measured Fermi surface (FS) of RSb consists of at least two\nconcentric hole pockets at the $\\Gamma$ point and two intersecting electron\npockets at the $X$ point. These data agree relatively well with the electronic\nstructure calculations. Detailed photon energy dependence measurements using\nboth synchrotron and laser ARPES systems indicate that there is at least one\nFermi surface sheet with strong three-dimensionality centered at the $\\Gamma$\npoint. Due to the \"lanthanide contraction\", the unit cell of different\nrare-earth monoantimonides shrinks when changing rare-earth ion from CeSb to\nLuSb. This results in the differences in the chemical potentials in these\ncompounds, which is demonstrated by both ARPES measurements and electronic\nstructure calculations. Interestingly, in CeSb, the intersecting electron\npockets at the $X$ point seem to be touching the valence bands, forming a\nfour-fold degenerate Dirac-like feature. On the other hand, the remaining\nrare-earth monoantimonides show significant gaps between the upper and lower\nbands at the $X$ point. Furthermore, similar to the previously reported results\nof LaBi, a Dirac-like structure was observed at the $\\Gamma$ point in YSb,\nCeSb, and GdSb, compounds showing relatively high magnetoresistance. This\nDirac-like structure may contribute to the unusually large magnetoresistance in\nthese compounds.\n", "  We embed a flipped ${\\rm SU}(5) \\times {\\rm U}(1)$ GUT model in a no-scale\nsupergravity framework, and discuss its predictions for cosmic microwave\nbackground observables, which are similar to those of the Starobinsky model of\ninflation. Measurements of the tilt in the spectrum of scalar perturbations in\nthe cosmic microwave background, $n_s$, constrain significantly the model\nparameters. We also discuss the model's predictions for neutrino masses, and\npay particular attention to the behaviours of scalar fields during and after\ninflation, reheating and the GUT phase transition. We argue in favor of strong\nreheating in order to avoid excessive entropy production which could dilute the\ngenerated baryon asymmetry.\n", "  The optimization of composition and processing to obtain materials that\nexhibit desirable characteristics has historically relied on a combination of\nscientist intuition, trial and error, and luck. We propose a methodology that\ncan accelerate this process by fitting data-driven models to experimental data\nas it is collected to suggest which experiment should be performed next. This\nmethodology can guide the scientist to test the most promising candidates\nearlier, and can supplement scientific intuition and knowledge with data-driven\ninsights. A key strength of the proposed framework is that it scales to\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces, as are typical in materials discovery\napplications. Importantly, the data-driven models incorporate uncertainty\nanalysis, so that new experiments are proposed based on a combination of\nexploring high-uncertainty candidates and exploiting high-performing regions of\nparameter space. Over four materials science test cases, our methodology led to\nthe optimal candidate being found with three times fewer required measurements\nthan random guessing on average.\n", "  We provide a new way to bound the security of quantum key distribution using\nonly two high-level, diagrammatic features of quantum processes: the\ncompositional behavior of complementary measurements and the essential\nuniqueness of purification. We begin by demonstrating a proof in the simplest\ncase, where the eavesdropper doesn't noticeably disturb the channel at all and\nhas no quantum memory. We then show how this approach extends straightforwardly\nto account for an eavesdropper with quantum memory and the presence of noise.\n", "  In order to generalize the integration rules to general CHY integrands which\ninclude higher order poles, algorithms are proposed in two directions. One is\nto conjecture new rules, and the other is to use the cross-ratio identity\nmethod. In this paper,we use the cross-ratio identity approach to re-derive the\nconjectured integration rules involving higher order poles for several special\ncases: the single double pole, single triple pole and duplex-double pole. The\nequivalence between the present formulas and the previously conjectured ones is\ndiscussed for the first two situations.\n", "  We present a survey of the radio sky accessible from the first station of the\nLong Wavelength Array (LWA1). Images are presented at nine frequencies between\n35 and 80 MHz with spatial resolutions ranging from $4.7^\\circ$ to $2.0^\\circ$,\nrespectively. The maps cover the sky north of a declination of $-40^\\circ$ and\nrepresent the most modern systematic survey of the diffuse Galactic emission\nwithin this frequency range. We also combine our survey with other low\nfrequency sky maps to create an updated model of the low frequency sky. Due to\nthe low frequencies probed by our survey, the updated model better accounts for\nthe effects of free-free absorption from Galactic ionized Hydrogen. A longer\nterm motivation behind this survey is to understand the foreground emission\nthat obscures the redshifted 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen from the\ncosmic dark ages ($z>10$) and, at higher frequencies, the epoch of reionization\n($z>6$).\n", "  In recent years, realistic hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies like the\nMilky Way have become available, enabling a reliable estimate of the dark\nmatter density and velocity distribution in the Solar neighborhood. We review\nhere the status of hydrodynamical simulations and their implications for the\ninterpretation of direct dark matter searches. We focus in particular on: the\ncriteria to identify Milky Way-like galaxies; the impact of baryonic physics on\nthe dark matter velocity distribution; the possible presence of substructures\nlike clumps, streams, or dark disks; and on the implications for the direct\ndetection of dark matter with standard and non-standard interactions.\n", "  The photoproduction of isolated photons has been measured in diffractive\nevents recorded by the ZEUS detector at HERA. Cross sections are evaluated in\nthe photon transverse-energy and pseudorapidity ranges $5 < E_T < 15$ GeV and\n$-0.7 < \\eta < 0.9,$ inclusively and also with a jet with transverse energy and\npseudorapidity in the ranges $4 < E_{jet} < 35$ GeV and $-1.5 < \\eta_{jet} <\n1.8,$ using a total integrated electron-proton luminosity of 456 pb$^{-1}$. A\nnumber of kinematic variables were studied and compared to predictions from the\nRapgap Monte Carlo model. An excess of data is observed above the Rapgap\npredictions for $z^{meas}_{Pomeron} > 0.9,$ where $z^{meas}_{Pomeron}$ is the\nfraction of the longitudinal momentum of the colourless \"Pomeron\" exchange that\nis transferred to the photon-jet final state, giving evidence for direct\nPomeron interactions.\n", "  In this work we consider the presence of contrarian agents in discrete\n3-state kinetic exchange opinion models. The contrarians are individuals that\nadopt the choice opposite to the prevailing choice of their contacts, whatever\nthis choice is. We consider binary as well as three-agent interactions, with\nstochastic parameters, in a fully-connected population. Our numerical results\nsuggest that the presence of contrarians destroys the absorbing state of the\noriginal model, changing the transition to the para-ferromagnetic type. In this\ncase, the consequence for the society is that the three opinions coexist in the\npopulation, in both phases (ordered and disordered). Furthermore, the\norder-disorder transition is suppressed for a sufficient large fraction of\ncontrarians. In some cases the transition is discontinuous, and it changes to\ncontinuous before it is suppressed. Some of our results are complemented by\nanalytical calculations based on the master equation.\n", "  We provide new observations of the LMC X-1 O star and its extended nebula\nstructure using spectroscopic data from VLT/UVES as well as H$\\alpha$ imaging\nfrom the Wide Field Imager on the Max Planck Gesellschaft / European Southern\nObservatory 2.2m telescope and ATCA imaging of the 2.1 GHz radio continuum.\nThis nebula is one of the few known to be energized by an X-ray binary. We use\na new spectrum extraction technique that is superior to other methods to obtain\nboth radial velocities and fluxes. This provides an updated spatial velocity of\n$\\simeq 21.0~\\pm~4.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the O star. The slit encompasses both the\nphoto-ionized and shock-ionized regions of the nebula. The imaging shows a\nclear arc-like structure reminiscent of a wind bow shock in between the\nionization cone and shock-ionized nebula. The observed structure can be fit\nwell by the parabolic shape of a wind bow shock. If an interpretation of a wind\nbow shock system is valid, we investigate the N159-O1 star cluster as a\npotential parent of the system, suggesting a progenitor mass of $\\sim 60$\nM$_{\\odot}$ for the black hole. We further note that the radio emission could\nbe non-thermal emission from the wind bow shock, or synchrotron emission\nassociated with the jet inflated nebula. For both wind and jet-powered origins,\nthis would represent one of the first radio detections of such a structure.\n", "  Direct numerical simulation of open-channel flow over a bed of spheres\narranged in a regular pattern has been carried out at bulk Reynolds number and\nroughness Reynolds number (based on sphere diameter) of approximately 6900 and\n120, respectively, for which the flow regime is fully-rough. The open-channel\nheight was approximately 5.5 times the diameter of the spheres. Extending the\nresults obtained by Chan-Braun et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 684, 2011, 441) for\nan open-channel flow in the transitionally-rough regime, the present purpose is\nto show how the flow structure changes as the fully-rough regime is attained\nand, for the first time, to enable a direct comparison with experimental\nobservations. The results indicate that, in the vicinity of the roughness\nelements, the average flow field is affected both by Reynolds number effects\nand by the geometrical features of the roughness, while at larger\nwall-distances this is not the case, and roughness concepts can be applied. The\nflow-roughness interaction occurs mostly in the region above the virtual origin\nof the velocity profile, and the effect of form-induced velocity fluctuations\nis maximum at the level of sphere crests. The spanwise length scale of\nturbulent velocity fluctuations in the vicinity of the sphere crests shows the\nsame dependence on the distance from the wall as that observed over a smooth\nwall, and both vary with Reynolds number in a similar fashion. Moreover, the\nhydrodynamic force and torque experienced by the roughness elements are\ninvestigated. Finally, the possibility either to adopt an analogy between the\nhydrodynamic forces associated with the interaction of turbulent structures\nwith a flat smooth wall or with the surface of the spheres is also discussed,\ndistinguishing the skin-friction from the form-drag contributions both in the\ntransitionally-rough and in the fully-rough regimes.\n", "  We present two-photon interference experiments with polarization-entangled\nphoton pairs in a polarization-based Franson-type interferometer. Although the\ntwo photons do not meet at a common beamsplitter, a phase-insensitive\nHong-Ou-Mandel type two-photon interference peak and dip fringes are observed,\nresulting from the two-photon interference effect between two indistinguishable\ntwo-photon probability amplitudes leading to a coincidence detection. A spatial\nquantum beating fringe is also measured for nondegenerate photon pairs in the\nsame interferometer, although the two-photon states have no frequency\nentanglement. When unentangled polarization-correlated photons are used as an\ninput state, the polarization entanglement is successfully recovered through\nthe interferometer via delayed compensation.\n", "  We continue the study of finite field dependent BRST (FFBRST) symmetry in the\nquantum theory of gauge fields. An expression for the Jacobian of path integral\nmeasure is presented, depending on a finite field-dependent parameter, and the\nFFBRST symmetry is then applied to a number of well-established quantum gauge\ntheories in a form which includes higher-derivative terms. Specifically, we\nexamine the corresponding versions of the Maxwell theory, non-Abelian vector\nfield theory, and gravitation theory. We present a systematic mapping between\ndifferent forms of gauge-fixing, including those with higher-derivative terms,\nfor which these theories have better renormalization properties. In doing so,\nwe also provide the independence of the S-matrix from a particular gauge-fixing\nwith higher derivatives. Following this method, a higher-derivative quantum\naction can be constructed for any gauge theory in the FFBRST framework.\n", "  We reveal the existence of continuous families of guided single-mode solitons\nin planar waveguides with weakly nonlinear active core and absorbing\nboundaries. Stable propagation of TE and TM-polarized solitons is accompanied\nby attenuation of all other modes, i.e. the waveguide features properties of\nconservative and dissipative systems. If the linear spectrum of the waveguide\npossesses exceptional points, which occurs in the case of TM-polarization, an\noriginally focusing (defocusing) material nonlinearity may become effectively\ndefocusing (focusing). This occurs due to the geometric phase of the carried\neigenmode when the surface impedance encircles the exceptional point. In its\nturn the change of the effective nonlinearity ensures the existence of dark\n(bright) solitons in spite of focusing (defocusing) Kerr nonlinearity of the\ncore. The existence of an exceptional point can also result in anomalous\nenhancement of the effective nonlinearity. In terms of practical applications\nthe nonlinearity of the reported waveguide can be manipulated by controlling\nthe properties of the absorbing cladding.\n", "  The GdFeO$_{3}$-type perovskite CaCoO$_{3}$ has been successfully synthesized\nby high-pressure oxygen annealing for the oxygen deficient perovskite. A\ndetailed structural analysis based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction data and a\nthermogravimetric analysis show that the valence of Co is +4 and the sample is\nfree from oxygen deficiency. This compound shows an antiferromagnetic ordering\nat 95 K, which has presumably helical spin arrangement, with keeping the\nincoherent metallic state down to the lowest temperature. This work\ndemonstrates that the Co$^{4+}$-perovskite oxides exhibit a variety of magnetic\nphases by the band-width control through the lattice distortion.\n", "  Three-dimensional discrete numerical simulation is used to investigate the\nproperties of close-packed frictionless granular assemblies as a function of\nparticle polydispersity and shape. Unlike some experimental results,\nsimulations show that disordered packings of pinacoids (eight-face convex\npolyhedron) achieve higher solid fraction values than amorphous packings of\nspherical or rounded particles, thus fulfilling the analogue of Ulam's\nconjecture stated by Jiao and co-workers for random packings [Y. Jiao and S.\nTorquato, Phys. Rev. E $\\textbf{84}$, $041309$ ($2011$)]. This seeming\ndiscrepancy between experimental and numerical results is believed to lie with\ndifficulties in overcoming interparticle friction through experimental\ndensification processes. Moreover, solid fraction is shown to increase further\nwith bidispersity and peak when the volume proportion of small particles\nreaches $30\\%$. Contrarywise, substituting up to $50\\%$ of flat pinacoids for\nisometric ones yields solid fraction decrease, especially when flat particles\nare also elongated. Nevertheless, particle shape seems to play a minor role on\npacking solid fraction compared to polydispersity. Additional investigations\nfocused on the packing microstructure confirm that pinacoid packings fulfill\nthe isostatic conjecture and that they are free of order except beyond $30$ to\n$50\\%$ of flat or flat \\& elongated polyhedra in the packing. This order\nincrease progressively takes the form of a nematic phase caused by the\nreorientation of flat or flat \\& elongated particles to minimize the packing\npotential energy. Simultaneously, this reorientation seems to increase the\nsolid fraction value slightly above the maximum achieved by monodisperse\nisometric pinacoids, as well as the coordination number. Finally, partial\nsubstitution of elongated pinacoids for isometric ones has limited effect on\npacking solid fraction or order.\n", "  A charged particle in a magnetic field possesses discrete energy levels\nassociated with particle's rotation around the field lines. The radiative\ntransitions between these levels are the well-known cyclotron transitions. We\nshow that a bound complex of particles with a non-zero net charge displays\nanalogous transitions between the states of confined motion of the entire\ncomplex in the field. The latter {\\em bound-ion cyclotron transitions} are\naffected by a coupling between the collective and internal motions of the\ncomplex and, as a result, differ from the transitions of a \"reference\" bare ion\nwith the same mass and charge. We analyze the cyclotron transitions for complex\nions by including the coupling within a rigorous quantum approach. Particular\nattention is paid to comparison of the transition energies and oscillator\nstrengths to those of the bare ion. Selection rules based on integrals of\ncollective motion are derived for the bound-ion cyclotron transitions\nanalytically, and the perturbation and coupled-channel approaches are developed\nto study the transitions quantitatively. Representative examples are considered\nand discussed for positive and negative atomic and cluster ions.\n", "  A spatially homogeneous anisotropic LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological model is\nstudied in $f(R,T)$ gravity with a special form of Hubble's parameter, which\nleads to constant deceleration parameter. The parameters involved in the\nconsidered form of Hubble parameter can be tuned to match, our models with the\n$\\Lambda $CDM model. With the present observed value of the deceleration\nparameter, we have discussed physical and kinematical properties of a specific\nmodel. Moreover, we have discussed the cosmological distances for our model.\n", "  The $f(R,T)$ gravity is an extended theory of gravity in which the\ngravitational action contains general terms of both the Ricci scalar $R$ and\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. In this way, $f(R,T)$ models are\ncapable of describing a non-minimal coupling between geometry (through terms in\n$R$) and matter (through terms in $T$). In this article we construct a\ncosmological model from the simplest non-minimal matter-geometry coupling\nwithin the $f(R,T)$ gravity formalism, by means of an effective energy-momentum\ntensor, given by the sum of the usual matter energy-momentum tensor with a dark\nenergy contribution, with the latter coming from the matter-geometry coupling\nterms. We apply the energy conditions to our solutions in order to obtain a\nrange of values for the free parameters of the model which yield a healthy and\nwell-behaved scenario. For some values of the free parameters which are\nsubmissive to the energy conditions application, it is possible to predict a\ntransition from a decelerated period of the expansion of the universe to a\nperiod of acceleration (dark energy era). We also propose further applications\nof this particular case of the $f(R,T)$ formalism in order to check its\nreliability in other fields, rather than cosmology.\n", "  A scintillating fiber array measurement system for gross beta is developed to\nachieve real-time monitoring of radioactivity in drinking water. The detector\nconsists of 1,096 scintillating fibers, both sides of the fibers connect to a\nphotomultiplier tube, and they are placed in a stainless steel tank. The\ndetector parameters of working voltage, background counting rate and stability\nof the detector were tested, and the detection efficiency was calibrated using\na standard solution of potassium chloride. Through experiment, the background\ncounting rate of the detector is 38.31 cps and the detection efficiency for\n$\\beta$ particles is 0.37 cps per Bq per liter; the detector can reach its\ndetection limit of 1.0 Bq per liter for $\\beta$ particles within 100 minutes\nwithout pre-concentration.\n", "  We compute the full asymptotic symmetry group of black holes belonging to the\nsame equivalence class of solutions within the Conformal Weyl Gravity\nformalism. We do this within an $AdS_2/CFT_1$ correspondence and by performing\na Robinson-Wilczek two dimensional reduction, thus enabling the construction of\nan effective quantum theory of the remaining field content. The resulting\nenergy momentum tensors generate asymptotic Virasoro algebras, to $s$-wave,\nwith calculable central extensions. These centers in conjunction with their\nproper regularized lowest Virasoro eigen-modes yield the Bekenstein-Hawking\nblack hole entropy via the statistical Cardy formula. We also analyze quantum\nholomorphic fluxes of the dual CFTs in the near horizon, giving rise to finite\nHawking temperatures weighted by the central charges of the respective black\nhole spacetimes. We conclude with a discussion and outlook for future work.\n", "  Advances of condensed matter physics in exploiting the spin degree of freedom\nof electrons led to the emergence of the field of spintronics, which envisions\nnew and more efficient approaches to data transfer, computing, and storage\n[1-3]. These ideas have been inspiring analogous approaches in photonics, where\nthe manipulation of an artificially engineered pseudo-spin degrees of freedom\nis enabled by synthetic gauge fields acting on light [4,5,6]. The ability to\ncontrol these additional degrees of freedom can significantly expand the\nlandscape of available optical responses, which may revolutionize optical\ncomputing and the basic means of controlling light in photonic devices across\nthe entire electromagnetic spectrum. Here we demonstrate a new class of\nphotonic systems, described by effective Hamiltonians in which competing\nsynthetic gauge fields engineered in pseudo-spin, chirality/sublattice and\nvalley subspaces result in band gap opening at one of the valleys, while the\nother valley exhibits Dirac-like conical dispersion. It is shown that such\neffective response has dramatic implications on photon transport, among which:\n(i) spin-polarized and valley-polarized one-way Klein tunneling and (ii)\ntopological edge states that coexist within the Dirac continuum for opposite\nvalley and spin polarizations. These phenomena offer new ways to control light\nin photonics, in particular for on-chip optical isolation, filtering and\nwave-division multiplexing by selective action on their pseudo-spin and valley\ndegrees of freedom.\n", "  A vortex filament immersed in a non-ideal fluid, thanks to viscous diffusion,\nexperiences a slipping motion with respect to the fluid. In recognition of\nthis, in this paper, the effect of this slipping motion on the Hasimoto soliton\npropagating on a vortex filament is investigated, and an exact solution is\ngiven to describe this process. A strong slipping motion is shown to prevent\nthe existence of the Hasimoto soliton. The critical slipping speed (above which\nthe Hasimoto soliton fails to exist) is shown to be equal to the torsion.\n", "  In this addendum we complement the remarks made in ref[1] constraining the\nvalue of the cosmological constant $\\Lambda_4$ in terms of neutrino masses.\nThose were based on a sharpened version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture as\napplied to compactifications of the SM to lower dimensions. We argue that the\nsame line of reasoning implies that for fixed values of $\\Lambda_4$ and the\nYukawa coupling of the lightest neutrino $Y_{\\nu_1}$, the EW scale is bounded\nabove. This is a trivial consequence of neutrino masses depending on the Higgs\nvev. In the case of massive Majorana neutrinos with a see-saw mechanism\nassociated to a large scale $M\\simeq 10^{10-14}$ GeV and $Y_{\\nu_1}\\simeq\n10^{-3}$, one obtains that the EW scale cannot exceed $M_{EW}\\lesssim\n10^2-10^4$ GeV. From this point of view, the delicate fine-tuning required to\nget a small EW scale would be a mirage, since parameters yielding higher EW\nscales would be in the swampland and would not count as possible consistent\ntheories. This would bring a new perspective into the issue of the EW\nhierarchy.\n", "  A systematic search for cyclical sources of gamma-ray emission on the period\nrange from days to years in the Fermi-LAT sky is performed. Looking for\ncyclical emission, the sky is binned into equal-area pixels and the generalised\nLomb-Scargle periodogram is computed for each of these pixels. The search on\nthe period range between 2.5 and 30 days in the Galactic plane confirms\nperiodicities of three binaries, LSI +61 303, LS 5039, and 1FGL J1018.6-5856.\nThe all-sky search on the period range between 30 days and 2.5 years confirms\nperiodicities of three blazars, PG 1553+113, PKS 2155-304, and BL Lacertae.\nEvidence for periodic behaviours of four blazars, 4C +01.28, S5 0716+71, PKS\n0805-07, and PKS 2052-47, are presented. Three of these blazars, 4C +01.28, PKS\n0805-07, and PKS 2052-47, are located at high redshifts. These three sources\nare potential candidates to binary systems of supermassive black holes provided\nthat major galaxy mergers are more frequent and that galaxies are more gas-rich\nat high redshifts.\n", "  Using a materials genome approach on the basis of the density functional\ntheory, we have formulated a new class of inorganic electrolytes for fast\ndiffusion of Li+ ions, through fine-tuning of lattice chemistry of\nanti-perovskite structures. Systematic modelling has been carried out to\nelaborate the structural stability and ion transportation characteristics in\nLi3AX based cubic anti-perovskite, through alloying on the chalcogen lattice\nsite (A) and alternative occupancy of the halogen site (X). In addition to\nidentifying effective ways for reduction of diffusion barriers for Li+ ions in\nanti-perovskite phases via suitable designation of lattice occupancy, the\ncurrent theoretical study leads to discovery and synthesis of a new phase with\na double-anti-perovskite structure, Li6OSI2 (or Li3O0.5S0.5I). Such a new\ncompound is of fairly low activation barrier for Li+ diffusion, together with a\nwide energy band gap to hinder conduction of electrons.\n", "  Acoustic wave attenuation due to vibrational and rotational molecular\nrelaxation, under simplifying assumptions of near-thermodynamic equilibrium and\nabsence of molecular dissociations, can be accounted for by specifying a bulk\nviscosity coefficient $\\mu_B$. In this paper, we propose a simple\nfrequency-dependent bulk viscosity model which, under such assumptions,\naccurately captures wave attenuation rates from infrasonic to ultrasonic\nfrequencies in Navier--Stokes and lattice Boltzmann simulations. The proposed\nmodel can be extended to any gas mixture for which molecular relaxation\ntimescales and attenuation measurements are available. The performance of the\nmodel is assessed for air by varying the base temperature, pressure, relative\nhumidity $h_r$, and acoustic frequency. Since the vibrational relaxation\ntimescales of oxygen and nitrogen are a function of humidity, for certain\nfrequencies an intermediate value of $h_r$ can be found which maximizes\n$\\mu_B$. The contribution to bulk viscosity due to rotational relaxation is\nverified to be a function of temperature, confirming recent findings in the\nliterature. While $\\mu_B$ decreases with higher frequencies, its effects on\nwave attenuation become more significant, as shown via a dimensionless\nanalysis. The proposed bulk viscosity model is designed for frequency-domain\nlinear acoustic formulations but is also extensible to time-domain simulations\nof narrow-band frequency content flows.\n", "  I discuss several issues related to \"classical\" spacetime structure. I review\nGalilean, Newtonian, and Leibnizian spacetimes, and briefly describe more\nrecent developments. The target audience is undergraduates and early graduate\nstudents in philosophy; the presentation avoids mathematical formalism as much\nas possible.\n", "  Localized waves in disordered one-dimensional materials have been studied for\ndecades, including white-noise and correlated disorder, as well as\nquasi-periodic disorder. How these wave phenomena relate to those in\ncrystalline (periodic ordered) materials---arguably the better understood\nsetting---has been a mystery ever since Anderson discovered disorder-induced\nlocalization. Nonetheless, together these revolutionized materials science and\ntechnology and led to new physics far beyond the solid state. We introduce a\nbroad family of structurally complex materials---chaotic crystals---that\ninterpolate between these organizational extremes---systematically spanning\nperiodic structures and random disorder. Within the family one can tune the\ndegree of disorder to sweep through an intermediate structurally disordered\nregion between two periodic lattices. This reveals new transport and\nlocalization phenomena reflected in a rich array of energy-dependent\nlocalization degree and density of states. In particular, strong localization\nis observed even with a very low degree of disorder. Moreover, markedly\nenhanced localization and delocalization coexist in a very narrow range of\nenergies. Most notably, beyond the simply smoothed bands found in previous\ndisorder studies, islands of transport emerge in band gaps and sharp band\nboundaries persist in the presence of substantial disorder. Finally, the family\nof materials comes with rather direct specifications of how to assemble the\nrequisite material organizations.\n", "  Subsequent to the recent rigorous derivation of an energetically consistent\ngyrokinetic collision operator in the so-called Landau representation, this\npaper investigates the possibility of finding a differential formulation of the\ngyrokinetic Landau collision operator. It is observed that, while a\ndifferential formulation is possible in the gyrokinetic phase space, reduction\nof the resulting system of partial differential equations to five dimensions\nvia gyroaveraging poses a challenge. Based on the present work, it is likely\nthat the gyrocentre analogues of the Rosenbluth-MacDonald-Judd potential\nfunctions must be kept gyroangle dependent.\n", "  For the first time, intermodulation distortion of micro-electromechanical\ncapacitive switches in the actuated state was analyzed both theoretically and\nexperimentally. The distortion, although higher than that of switches in the\nsuspended state, was found to decrease with increasing bias voltage but to\ndepend weakly on modulation frequencies between 55 kHz and 1.1 MHz. This\ndependence could be explained by the orders-of-magnitude increase of the spring\nconstant when the switches were actuated. Additionally, the analysis suggested\nthat increasing the spring constant and decreasing the contact roughness could\nimprove the linearity of actuated switches. These results are critical to\nmicro-electromechanical capacitive switches used in tuners, filters, phase\nshifters, etc. where the linearity of both suspended and actuated states are\ncritical.\n", "  With the investigation of the production cross section of $\\ ^{51}\\rm Mn$ off\nof $\\ ^{\\rm nat}\\rm Fe$ in mind, two stacked target experiments were conducted\nat the Berkeley Lab 88-Inch Cyclotron. Proton beams with energies of $25$ and\n$55\\,\\rm MeV$ result in a total of 14 data points for various reactions. Gamma\nspectra of the activated foils were taken and analyzed, then cross sections\ncalculated.\n", "  This paper briefly reviews past milestones in the field of medical image\nreconstruction and describes some future directions. It is part of an overview\npaper on \"open problems in signal processing\" that will appear in IEEE Signal\nProcessing Magazine, but presented here with citations and equations.\n", "  We propose a scale invariant model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking\nvia top condensation within the minimal top condensate see-saw model. The\nclassical scale invariance is realized nonlinearly by introducing conformal\ncompensator scalar field, the dilaton, which plays crucial role in successful\npredictions for the Higgs boson. The dilaton mass and its mixing with the\ncomposite Higgs boson appears only at 2-loop level, both being proportional to\nthe hierarchy between the electroweak and compositeness scales, $\\propto\nv/\\Lambda$. The mass scales in our model are generated via the mechanism of\ndimensional transmutation and the hierarchy $v/\\Lambda \\ll 1$ is radiatively\nstable, thus resolving the fine-tuning problem of the standard top condensate\nmodels.\n", "  The variation of photonic orbital angular momentum at Compton scattering is\ncharacterized. We determine scattering matrix of a twisted light based on the\nfundamental conservation of orbital angular momenta. Numerical values for two\ndifferent twisted light modes: Laguerre Gaussian and Bessel Gaussian, are\ngenerated and illustrated. Our analysis indicate that states of photonic\norbital angular momentum are highly changeable at wide angle scattering but\nmore consistent at small angle scattering.\n", "  In the recent years image processing techniques are used as a tool to improve\ndetection and diagnostic capabilities in the medical applications. Medical\napplications have been so much affected by these techniques which some of them\nare embedded in medical instruments such as MRI, CT and other medical devices.\nAmong these techniques, medical image enhancement algorithms play an essential\nrole in removal of the noise which can be produced by medical instruments and\nduring image transfer. It has been proved that impulse noise is a major type of\nnoise, which is produced during medical operations, such as MRI, CT, and\nangiography, by their image capturing devices. An embeddable hardware module\nwhich is able to denoise medical images before and during surgical operations\ncould be very helpful. In this paper an accurate algorithm is proposed for\nreal-time removal of impulse noise in medical images. All image blocks are\ndivided into three categories of edge, smooth, and disordered areas. A\ndifferent reconstruction method is applied to each category of blocks for the\npurpose of noise removal. The proposed method is tested on MR images.\nSimulation results show acceptable denoising accuracy for various levels of\nnoise. Also an FPAG implementation of our denoising algorithm shows acceptable\nhardware resource utilization. Hence, the algorithm is suitable for embedding\nin medical hardware instruments such as radiosurgery devices.\n", "  The FOREST Unbiased Galactic plane Imaging survey with the Nobeyama 45-m\ntelescope (FUGIN) project is one of the legacy projects using the new\nmulti-beam FOREST receiver installed on the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. This\nproject aims to investigate the distribution, kinematics, and physical\nproperties of both diffuse and dense molecular gas in the Galaxy at once by\nobserving 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=1-0 lines simultaneously. The mapping regions\nare a part of the 1st quadrant (10d < l < 50d, |b| < 1d) and the 3rd quadrant\n(198d < l <236d, |b| < 1d) of the Galaxy, where spiral arms, bar structure, and\nthe molecular gas ring are included. This survey achieves the highest angular\nresolution to date (~20\") for the Galactic plane survey in the CO J=1-0 lines,\nwhich makes it possible to find dense clumps located farther away than the\nprevious surveys. FUGIN will provide us with an invaluable dataset for\ninvestigating the physics of the galactic interstellar medium (ISM),\nparticularly the evolution of interstellar gas covering galactic scale\nstructures to the internal structures of giant molecular clouds, such as small\nfilament/clump/core. We present an overview of the FUGIN project, observation\nplan, and initial results, which reveal wide-field and detailed structures of\nmolecular clouds, such as entangled filaments that have not been obvious in\nprevious surveys, and large-scale kinematics of molecular gas such as spiral\narms.\n", "  The crucial aspect of this demonstration is the discovery of renewal events,\nhidden in the computed dynamics of a multifractal metronome, which enables the\nreplacement of the phenomenon of strong anticipation with a time delayed\ncross-correlation between the driven and the driving metronome. We establish\nthat the phenomenon of complexity matching, which is the theme of an increasing\nnumber of research groups, has two distinct measures. One measure is the\nsensitivity of a complex system to environmental multi-fractality; another is\nthe level of information transfer, between two complex networks at criticality.\nThe cross-correlation function is evaluated in the ergodic long-time limit, but\nits delayed maximal value is the signature of information transfer occurring in\nthe non ergodic short-time regime. It is shown that a more complex system\ntransfers its multifractality to a less complex system while the reverse case\nis not possible.\n", "  We detail and present results from a pilot study to assess the feasibility of\ndetecting molecular lines at low radio frequencies. We observed a 400 square\ndegree region centred on the Galactic Centre with the Murchison Widefield Array\n(MWA) between 103 and 133\\,MHz targeting 28 known molecular species that have\nsignificant transitions. The results of this survey yield tentative detections\nof nitric oxide (NO) and the mercapto radical (SH). Both of these molecules\nappear to be associated with evolved stars.\n", "  We propose a search of galactic axions with mass about 0.2 microeV using a\nlarge volume resonant cavity, about 50 m^3, cooled down to 4 K and immersed in\na moderate axial magnetic field of about 0.6 T generated inside the\nsuperconducting magnet of the KLOE experiment located at the National\nLaboratory of Frascati of INFN. This experiment, called KLASH (KLoe magnet for\nAxion SearcH) in the following, has a potential sensitivity on the\naxion-to-photon coupling, g_agg, of about 6x10^-17 GeV-1, reaching the region\npredicted by KSVZ and DFSZ models of QCD axions.\n", "  In this work, we have carried on dynamical system analysis of hessence field\ncoupling with dark matter in $f(T)$ gravity. We have analysed the critical\npoints due to autonomous system. The resulting autonomous system is non-linear.\nSo, we have approached via the the theory of non-linear dynamical system.We\nhave noticed very few papers are devoted to this kind of study.Maximum works in\nliterature are done treating the dynamical system as done in linear dynamical\nanalysis, which are unable to predict correct evolution.Our work is totally\ndifferent from those kind of works.We have used theory of non-linear dynamical\nsystem theory,developed till date,in our analysis.This approach gives totally\ndifferent stable solutions, in contrast what the linear analysis would have\npredicted. We have discussed the stability analysis in details due to\nexponential potential through computational method in tabular form and analyzed\nthe evolution of the universe. Some plots are drawn to investigate the\nbehaviour of the system (this plotting technique is different from usual phase\nplot, and devised by us.). Interestingly, the analysis shows the universe may\nresemble the `cosmological constant' like evolution (i.e., $\\Lambda$CDM model\nis a subset of the solution set). Also, all the fixed points of our model are\nable to avoid Big rip singularity.\n", "  We demonstrate a method to produce vacuum tight, metal free, bakeable and\nalkali compatible feedthroughs for optical fibers. The manufacturing process\nmainly relies on encasing fibers made of fused silica with glass materials with\nlower melting points by heating. We analyze the vacuum and optical performance\nof the devices by various methods including helium leak checking and several\nspectroscopic schemes, among others electromagnetically induced transparency\ninvolving Rydberg states.\n", "  We introduce a natural nondegeneracy condition for Poisson structures, called\nholonomicity, which is closely related to the notion of a log symplectic form.\nHolonomic Poisson manifolds are privileged by the fact that their deformation\nspaces are as finite-dimensional as one could ever hope: the corresponding\nderived deformation complex is a perverse sheaf. We develop some basic\nstructural features of these manifolds, highlighting the role played by the\ndivergence of Hamiltonian vector fields. As an application, we establish the\ndeformation-invariance of certain families of Poisson manifolds defined by\nFeigin and Odesskii, along with the \"elliptic algebras\" that quantize them.\n", "  Condensed-matter emitters offer enriched cavity quantum electrodynamical\neffects due to the coupling to external degrees of freedom. In the case of\ncarbon nanotubes a very peculiar coupling between localized excitons and the\none-dimensional acoustic phonon modes can be achieved, which gives rise to\npronounced phonon wings in the luminescence spectrum. By coupling an individual\nnanotube to a tunable optical micro-cavity, we show that this peculiar\nexciton-phonon coupling is a valuable resource to enlarge the tuning range of\nthe single-photon source while keeping an excellent exciton-photon coupling\nefficiency and spectral purity. Using the unique flexibility of our scanning\nfiber cavity, we are able to measure the efficiency spectrum of the very same\nnanotube in the Purcell regime for several mode volumes. Whereas this\nefficiency spectrum looks very much like the free-space luminescence spectrum\nwhen the Purcell factor is small (large mode volume), we show that the\ndeformation of this spectrum at lower mode volumes can be traced back to the\nstrength of the exciton-photon coupling. It shows an enhanced efficiency on the\nred wing that arises from the asymmetry of the incoherent energy exchange\nprocesses between the exciton and the cavity. This allows us to obtain a tuning\nrange up to several hundred times the spectral width of the source.\n", "  Strain-based theory on elastic instabilities is being widely employed for\nstudying onset of plasticity, phase transition or melting in crystals. And size\neffects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs to\naccount for contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient\nbased higher order elastic theories on the elastic instabilities are not well\nestablished to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids\ndirectly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher\norder elastic instabilities is established and justified by developing an\nequivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical\ninstability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is\ndetermined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain\ngradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the\nhigher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be\ndirectly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of\nthe stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals,\ni.e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression\ntechnique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed\nto study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted\ncritical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with the results from the\nNEMD simulations for all the metals. Since the only inputs for the established\nhigher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations, i.e., atomic\npotentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely\nequivalent to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least,\nfor crystals.\n", "  In this review article, we discuss recent studies on drops and bubbles in\nHele-Shaw cells, focusing on how scaling laws exhibit crossovers from the\nthree-dimensional counterparts and focusing on topics in which viscosity plays\nan important role. By virtue of progresses in analytical theory and high-speed\nimaging, dynamics of drops and bubbles have actively been studied with the aid\nof scaling arguments. However, compared with three dimensional problems,\nstudies on the corresponding problems in Hele-Shaw cells are still limited.\nThis review demonstrates that the effect of confinement in the Hele-Shaw cell\nintroduces new physics allowing different scaling regimes to appear. For this\npurpose, we discuss various examples that are potentially important for\nindustrial applications handling drops and bubbles in confined spaces by\nshowing agreement between experiments and scaling theories. As a result, this\nreview provides a collection of problems in hydrodynamics that may be\nanalytically solved or that may be worth studying numerically in the near\nfuture.\n", "  In Quantum Non Demolition measurements, the sequence of observations is\ndistributed as a mixture of multinomial random variables. Parameters of the\ndynamics are naturally encoded into this family of distributions. We show the\nlocal asymptotic mixed normality of the underlying statistical model and the\nconsistency of the maximum likelihood estimator. Furthermore, we prove the\nasymptotic optimality of this estimator as it saturates the usual Cram\\'er Rao\nbound.\n", "  We present an investigation on the intermetallic compound formed by HoCuBi\nwhich has a monoclinic crystalline P2 structure with lattice parameters; a =\n9:8012(26)A, b = 6:0647(6)A, c = 6:1663(13)A. In this report we performed an\nextensive analysis of the magnetic characteristics, specific heat at low\ntemperature mainly close to the region of the observed antiferromagnetic\ntransition with Neel temperature about 7 K, and to the field induced\nspin-crossover; the metamagnetic transition typically observed in\nantiferromagnetic systems by measurements of M-H, (Magnetization - Magnetic\nField) at low temperatures.\n", "  We present a systematic study of core-shell Au/Fe_3O_4 nanoparticles produced\nby thermal decomposition under mild conditions. The morphology and crystal\nstructure of the nanoparticles revealed the presence of Au core of <d> =\n(6.9\\pm 1.0) nm surrounded by Fe_3O_4 shell with a thickness of ~3.5 nm,\nepitaxially grown onto the Au core surface. The Au/Fe_3O_4 core-shell structure\nwas demonstrated by high angle annular dark field scanning transmission\nelectron microscopy analysis. The magnetite shell grown on top of the Au\nnanoparticle displayed a thermal blocking state at temperatures below T_B = 59\nK and a relaxed state well above T_B. Remarkably, an exchange bias effect was\nobserved when cooling down the samples below room temperature under an external\nmagnetic field. Moreover, the exchange bias field (H_{EX}) started to appear at\nT~40 K and its value increased by decreasing the temperature. This effect has\nbeen assigned to the interaction of spins located in the magnetically\ndisordered regions (in the inner and outer surface of the Fe_3O_4 shell) and\nspins located in the ordered region of the Fe_3O_4 shell.\n", "  The landscape of causal relations that can hold among a set of systems in\nquantum theory is richer than in classical physics. In particular, a pair of\ntime-ordered systems can be related as cause and effect or as the effects of a\ncommon cause, and each of these causal mechanisms can be coherent or not.\nFurthermore, one can combine these mechanisms in different ways: by\nprobabilistically realizing either one or the other or by having both act\nsimultaneously (termed a physical mixture). In the latter case, it is possible\nfor the two mechanisms to be combined quantum-coherently. Previous work has\nshown how to experimentally realize one example of each class of possible\ncausal relations. Here, we make a theoretical and experimental study of the\ntransitions between these classes. In particular, for each of the two distinct\ntypes of coherence that can exist in mixtures of common-cause and cause-effect\nrelations--coherence in the individual causal pathways and coherence in the way\nthe causal relations are combined--we determine how it degrades under noise and\nwe confirm these expectations in a quantum-optical experiment.\n", "  Optical response of silicon (SiV) and nitrogen (NV) vacancy diamond color\ncenters coupled to silver and gold nanorod dimers was numerically inspected.\nOptimization of the coupled emitter - nanorod dimer configurations was\nperformed to attain the highest possible fluorescence enhancement by enhancing\nthe excitation and emission of color centers simultaneously through plasmonic\nantenna resonances. To minimize losses conditional optimization was realized by\nsetting a criterion regarding the minimum quantum efficiency of the coupled\nsystem (cQE). Restricted symmetric and allowed asymmetric antenna designs were\nalso inspected to prove the potential advantages of asymmetric configurations\ntuneability. Among all inspected systems the highest 2.59*10^8 fluorescence\nenhancement with 46.08% cQE was achieved in case of NV color center coupled to\nasymmetric silver nanoantenna dimer. This is 3.17-times larger than the\nenhancement in corresponding symmetric configuration, which has larger 68.52%\ncQE. In case of SiV color center the highest 1.04*10^8 fluorescence enhancement\nwith 37.83% cQE was achieved via asymmetric silver nanoantenna dimer. This is\n1.06-times larger than the enhancement in the corresponding symmetric\nconfiguration, which has larger 57.46% cQE. The highest fluorescence\nenhancement achieved by gold nanorods is 4.75*10^4 with 21.8% cQE, which was\nshown in case of SiV color center coupled to asymmetric dimer. The attained\nenhancement is 8.48- (92.42-) times larger than the fluorescence enhancement\nachievable via symmetric (asymmetric) gold nanorod dimer coupled to SiV (NV)\ncolor center.\n", "  The exact solutions of the (2+1) dimensional Dirac equation on the torus and\nthe new extension and generalization of the trigonometric Poschl-Teller\npotential families in terms of the torus parameters are obtained.\nSupersymmetric quantum mechanical techniques are used to get the extended\npotentials when the inner and outer radii of the torus are both equal and\ninequal. In addition, using the aspects of the Lie algebraic approaches, the\niso(2; 1) algebra is also applied to the system where we have arrived at the\nspectrum solutions of the extended potentials using the Casimir operator that\nmatches with the results of the exact solutions.\n", "  We prove the global stability of the Minkowski space viewed as the trivial\nsolution of the Einstein-Vlasov system. To estimate the Vlasov field, we use\nthe vector field and modified vector field techniques developed in [FJS15;\nFJS17]. In particular, the initial support in the velocity variable does not\nneed to be compact. To control the effect of the large velocities, we identify\nand exploit several structural properties of the Vlasov equation to prove that\nthe worst non-linear terms in the Vlasov equation either enjoy a form of the\nnull condition or can be controlled using the wave coordinate gauge. The basic\npropagation estimates for the Vlasov field are then obtained using only weak\ninterior decay for the metric components. Since some of the error terms are not\ntime-integrable, several hierarchies in the commuted equations are exploited to\nclose the top order estimates. For the Einstein equations, we use wave\ncoordinates and the main new difficulty arises from the commutation of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, which needs to be rewritten using the modified vector\nfields.\n", "  Transformation optics (TO) has been used to propose various novel optical\ndevices. With the help of metamaterials, several intriguing designs, such as\ninvisibility cloaks, have been implemented. However, as the basic units should\nbe much smaller than the working wavelengths to achieve the effective material\nparameters, and the sizes of devices should be much larger than the wavelengths\nof illumination to work within the light-ray approximation, it is a big\nchallenge to implement an experimental system that works simultaneously for\nboth geometric optics and wave optics. In this letter, by using a\ngradient-index micro-structured optical waveguide, we realize a device of\nconformal transformation optics (CTO) and demonstrate its self-focusing\nproperty for geometry optics and Talbot effect for wave optics. In addition,\nthe Talbot effect in such a system has a potential application to transfer\ndigital information without diffraction. Our findings demonstrate the photon\ncontrolling ability of CTO in a feasible experiment system.\n", "  Light meson ( $\\pi,\\ \\sigma,\\ a_0$) properties in the environment with chiral\nimbalance are analyzed with the help of meson effective Lagrangian associated\nwith QCD. New spatial parity violating decays of scalar mesons arise as a\nresult of mixing of $\\pi$ and $a_0$ mesons under influence of chiral charge\ndensity. The pion electromagnetic form-factor gets an unusual parity-odd\ncontribution. Pion effective masses depend on their velocities and may vanish\nin flight. The possible determination of chiral chemical potential in heavy ion\ncollisions based on above mentioned phenomena is discussed.\n", "  We show how the presence of inversion symmetry in a one-dimensional (1D)\nlattice model is not a sufficient condition for a quantized Zak's phase. This\nis only the case when the inversion axis is at the center of the unit cell.\nWhen the inversion axis is not at the center, the modified inversion operator\nwithin the unit cell gains a k-dependence in some of its matrix elements which\nadds a correction term to the usual Zak's phase expression1, making it in\ngeneral deviate from its quantized value. A general expression that recovers a\nquantized Zak's phase in a lattice model with a unit cell of arbitrary size and\narbitrarily positioned inversion axis is provided in this paper, which relates\nthe quantized value with the eigenvalues of a modified parity operator at the\ninversion invariant momenta.\n", "  We find the exact Bloch oscillations in zigzag arrays of curved optical\nwaveguides under the influence of arbitrary long-range coupling. The curvature\ninduces a linear transverse potential gradient in the equations of the light\nevolution. In the case of arrays with second-order coupling, steady states can\nbe obtained as linear combinations of Bessel functions of integer index. The\ncorresponding eigenvalues are equally spaced and form the well-known\nWannier-Stark ladder, the spacing being independent of the second-order\ncoupling. We also solve exactly the wave packet dynamics and compare it with\nexperimental results. Accordingly we find that a broad optical pulse performs\nBloch oscillations. Frequency doubling of the fundamental Bloch frequency sets\nup at finite values of the second-order coupling. On the contrary when a single\nwaveguide is initially excited, a breathing mode is activated with no signature\nof Bloch oscillations. We present a generalization of our results to waveguide\narrays subject to long-range coupling. In the general case the centroid of the\nwave packet shows the occurrence of multiples of the Bloch frequency up to the\norder of the interaction.\n", "  Scalability and foundry compatibility (as for example in conventional silicon\nbased integrated computer processors) in developing quantum technologies are\nexceptional challenges facing current research. Here we introduce a quantum\nphotonic technology potentially enabling large scale fabrication of\nsemiconductor-based, site-controlled, scalable arrays of electrically driven\nsources of polarization-entangled photons, with the potential to encode quantum\ninformation. The design of the sources is based on quantum dots grown in\nmicron-sized pyramidal recesses along the crystallographic direction (111)B\ntheoretically ensuring high symmetry of the quantum dots - the condition for\nactual bright entangled photon emission. A selective electric injection scheme\nin these non-planar structures allows obtaining a high density of\nlight-emitting diodes, with some producing entangled photon pairs also\nviolating Bell's inequality. Compatibility with semiconductor fabrication\ntechnology, good reproducibility and control of the position make these devices\nattractive candidates for integrated photonic circuits for quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  In this paper the relations between the asymptotic velocity operators of a\nquantum system and the asymptotic velocities of the associated Bohmian\ntrajectories are studied. In particular it is proved that, under suitable\nconditions of asymptotic regularity, the probability distribution of the\nasymptotic velocities of the Bohmian trajectories is equal to the one derived\nfrom the asymptotic velocity operators of the associated quantum system. It is\nalso shown that in the relativistic case the distribution of the asymptotic\nvelocities of the Bohmian trajectories is covariant, or equivalently, it does\nnot depend on a preferred foliation (it is well known that this is not the case\nfor the structure of the Bohmian trajectories or for their spatial distribution\nat a finite time). This result allows us to develop a covariant formulation of\nrelativistic Bohmian mechanics; such a formulation is proposed here merely as a\nmathematical possibility, while its empirical adequacy will be discussed\nelsewhere.\n", "  Progress in quantum computing hardware raises questions about how these\ndevices can be controlled, programmed, and integrated with existing\ncomputational workflows. We briefly describe several prominent quantum\ncomputational models, their associated quantum processing units (QPUs), and the\nadoption of these devices as accelerators within high-performance computing\nsystems. Emphasizing the interface to the QPU, we analyze instruction set\narchitectures based on reduced and complex instruction sets, i.e., RISC and\nCISC architectures. We clarify the role of conventional constraints on memory\naddressing and instruction widths within the quantum computing context.\nFinally, we examine existing quantum computing platforms, including the D-Wave\n2000Q and IBM Quantum Experience, within the context of future ISA development\nand HPC needs.\n"]}
