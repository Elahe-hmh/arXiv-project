on solutions of the Maurer--Cartan equation\nextends to arbitrary (inhomogeneous) odd forms: any such form with values in a\nLie superalgebra satisfying $d\\o+\\o^2=0$ is gauge-equivalent to a constant,\n$$\\o=gCg^{-1}-dg\\,g^{-1}\\,.$$ This follows from a non-Abelian version of a\nchain homotopy formula making use of multiplicative integrals. An application\nto Lie algebroids and their non-linear analogs is given.\n  Constructions presented here generalize to an abstract setting of\ndifferential Lie superalgebras where we arrive at the statement that odd\nelements (not necessarily satisfying the Maurer--Cartan equation) are\nhomotopic\\,---\\,in a certain particular sense\\,---\\,if and only if they are\ngauge-equivalent.\n", "  We give a short proof of the Buchstaber-Rees theorem concerning symmetric\npowers. The proof is based on the notion of a formal characteristic function of\na linear map of algebras.\n", "  This is a survey of Berezin's work focused on three topics: representation\ntheory, general concept of quantization, and supermathematics.\n", "  We analytically compute the dominant contributions to the \\beta-functions for\nthe top-Yukawa coupling, the strong coupling and the Higgs self-coupling as\nwell as the anomalous dimensions of the scalar, gluon and quark fields in the\nunbroken phase of the Standard Model at three-loop level. These are mainly the\nQCD and top-Yukawa corrections. The contributions from the Higgs\nself-interaction which are negligible for the running of the top-Yukawa and the\nstrong coupling but important for the running of the Higgs self-coupling are\nalso evaluated.\n", "  In this article the stability of the Standard Model (SM) vacuum in the\npresence of radiative corrections and for a Higgs boson with a mass in the\nvicinity of 125 GeV is discussed. The central piece in this discussion will be\nthe Higgs self-interaction $\\lambda$ and its evolution with the energy scale of\na given physical process. This is described by the $\\beta$-function to which we\nrecently computed analytically the dominant three-loop contributions. These are\nmainly the QCD and top-Yukawa corrections as well as the contributions from the\nHiggs self-interaction itself. We will see that for a Higgs boson with a mass\nof about 125 GeV the question whether the SM vacuum is stable and therefore\nwhether the SM could be valid up to Planck scale cannot be answered with\ncertainty due to large experimental uncertainties, mainly in the top quark\nmass.\n", "  In our previous works, we introduced, for each (super)manifold, a commutative\nalgebra of densities. It is endowed with a natural invariant scalar product. In\nthis paper, we study geometry of differential operators of second order on this\nalgebra. In the more conventional language they correspond to certain operator\npencils. We consider the self-adjoint operators and analyze the operator\npencils that pass through a given operator acting on densities of a particular\nweight. There are `singular values' for pencil parameters. They are related\nwith interesting geometric picture. In particular, we obtain operators that\ndepend on certain equivalence classes of connections (instead of connections as\nsuch). We study the corresponding groupoids. From this point of view we analyze\ntwo examples: the canonical Laplacian on an odd symplectic supermanifold\nappearing in Batalin--Vilkovisky geometry and the Sturm--Liouville operator on\nthe line, related with classical constructions of projective geometry. We also\nconsider the canonical second order semi-density arising on odd symplectic\nsupermanifolds, which has some similarity with mean curvature of surfaces in\nRiemannian geometry.\n", "  We construct a twin correspondence between graphs with prescribed mean\ncurvature in three-dimensional Riemannian Killing submersions and spacelike\ngraphs with prescribed mean curvature in three-dimensional Lorentzian Killing\nsubmersions. Our duality extends the Calabi correspondence between minimal\ngraphs in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and maximal graphs in the\nLorentz-Minkowski spacetime $\\mathbb{L}^3$, by allowing arbitrary prescribed\nmean curvature and bundle curvature. For instance, we transform the prescribed\nmean curvature equation in $\\mathbb{L}^3$ into the minimal surface equation in\nthe generalized Heisenberg space with prescribed bundle curvature. We present\nseveral applications of the twin correspondence to the study of the moduli\nspace of complete spacelike surfaces in certain Lorentzian spacetimes.\n", "  In this paper analytical results are presented for higher order corrections\nto coefficient functions of the operator product expansion (OPE) for the\ncorrelator of two pseudoscalar gluonium operators \\tilde{O}_1=G^{\\mu\n\\nu}\\tilde{G}_{\\mu \\nu}. The Wilson coefficient in front of the scalar gluon\ncondensate operator O_1=-1/4 G^{\\mu \\nu}G_{\\mu \\nu} is given at three-loop\naccuracy. The leading coefficient C_0 in front of the unity operator O_0=1 has\nbeen calculated up to three-loop order some time ago but has been checked\nindependently in this work. It is interesting to see that the coefficient C_1\nin the pseudoscalar case is finite, whereas contact terms appear in C_0 in this\ncase and in both coefficients C_0 and C_1 in the cases of the scalar gluonium\ncorrelator and the energy momentum tensor correlator. For the corresponding\nRenormalization Group invariant Wilson coefficients which are also constructed\nthe results are partially extended to four-loop accuracy. All results are given\nin the MSbar-scheme at zero temperature.\n", "  The algebra of densities $\\Den(M)$ is a commutative algebra canonically\nassociated with a given manifold or supermanifold $M$. We introduced this\nalgebra earlier in connection with our studies of Batalin--Vilkovisky geometry.\nThe algebra $\\Den(M)$ is graded by real numbers and possesses a natural\ninvariant scalar product. This leads to important geometric consequences and\napplications to geometric constructions on the original manifold. In\nparticular, there is a classification theorem for derivations of the algebra\n$\\Den(M)$. It allows a natural definition of bracket operations on vector\ndensities of various weights on a (super)manifold $M$, similar to how the\nclassical Fr\\\"{o}licher--Nijenhuis theorem on derivations of the algebra of\ndifferential forms leads to the Nijenhuis bracket. It is possible to extend\nthis classification from \"vector fields\" (derivations) on $\\Den(M)$ to\n\"multivector fields\". This leads to the striking result that an arbitrary even\nPoisson structure on $M$ possesses a canonical lifting to the algebra of\ndensities. (The latter two statements were obtained by our student A.Biggs.)\nThis is in sharp contrast with the previously studied case of an odd Poisson\nstructure, where extra data are required for such a lifting.\n", "  The maximum rate at which classical information can be reliably transmitted\nper use of a quantum channel strictly increases in general with $N$, the number\nof channel outputs that are detected jointly by the quantum joint-detection\nreceiver (JDR). This phenomenon is known as superadditivity of the maximum\nachievable information rate over a quantum channel. We study this phenomenon\nfor a pure-state classical-quantum (cq) channel and provide a lower bound on\n$C_N/N$, the maximum information rate when the JDR is restricted to making\njoint measurements over no more than $N$ quantum channel outputs, while\nallowing arbitrary classical error correction. We also show the appearance of a\nsuperadditivity phenomenon---of mathematical resemblance to the aforesaid\nproblem---in the channel capacity of a classical discrete memoryless channel\n(DMC) when a concatenated coding scheme is employed, and the inner decoder is\nforced to make hard decisions on $N$-length inner codewords. Using this\ncorrespondence, we develop a unifying framework for the above two notions of\nsuperadditivity, and show that for our lower bound to $C_N/N$ to be equal to a\ngiven fraction of the asymptotic capacity $C$ of the respective channel, $N$\nmust be proportional to $V/C^2$, where $V$ is the respective channel dispersion\nquantity.\n", "  The discovery of a Higgs particle has triggered numerous theoretical and\nexperimental investigations concerning its production and decay rates and has\nled to interesting results concerning its interaction with fermions and gauge\nbosons. The self-interaction $\\lambda$ of the Standard Model Higgs boson is\nparticularly important due to its close connection with the stability of the SM\nvacuum. In this talk precision calculations for the evolution of this crucial\ncoupling are presented and their impact on the question of vacuum stability is\nanalysed. We also compare the theoretical precision resulting from the\ncalculation of three-loop $\\beta$-functions to the experimental uncertainties\nstemming from key parameters, such as the top mass, the Higgs mass and the\nstrong coupling, and to the theoretical uncertainties introduced by the\nmatching of experimental data to parameters in the theoretically favoured\n$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme.\n", "  In this paper we use Block's classification of simple modules over the first\nWeyl algebra to obtain a complete classification of simple weight modules, in\nparticular, of Harish-Chandra modules, over the 1-spatial ageing algebra\nage(1). Most of these modules have infinite dimensional weight spaces and so\nfar the algebra age(1) is the only Lie algebra having simple weight modules\nwith infinite dimensional weight spaces for which such a classification exists.\nAs an application we classify all simple weight modules over the\n(1+1)-dimensional space-time Schrodinger algebra S that have a simple\nage(1)-submodule thus constructing many new simple weight S-modules.\n", "  Understanding glasses and the glass transition requires comprehending the\nnature of the crossover from the ergodic (or equilibrium) regime, in which the\nstationary properties of the system have no history dependence, to the\nmysterious glass transition region, where the measured properties are\nnon-stationary and depend on the protocol of preparation. In this work we use\nnon-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to test the main features of the\ncrossover predicted by the \\emph{molecular} version of the recently-developed\nmulticomponent non-equilibrium self-consistent generalized Langevin equation\n(NE-SCGLE) theory. According to this theory, the glass transition involves the\nabrupt passage from the ordinary pattern of full equilibration to the aging\nscenario characteristic of glass-forming liquids. The same theory explains that\nthis abrupt transition will always be observed as a blurred crossover by the\nunavoidable finiteness of the time window of any experimental observation. We\nfind that within their finite waiting-time window, the simulations confirm the\ngeneral trends predicted by the theory.\n", "  Dopants in crystalline silicon such as phosphorus (Si:P) have electronic and\nnuclear spins with exceptionally long coherence times making them promising\nplatforms for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The demonstration of\nsingle-spin single-shot readout brings these ideas closer to implementation.\nProgress in fabricating atomic-scale Si:P structures with scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopes offers a powerful route to scale up this work, taking advantage of\ntechniques developed by the computing industry. The experimental and\ntheoretical sides of this emerging quantum technology are reviewed with a focus\non the period from 2009 to mid-2014.\n", "  The correlator of two gluonic operators plays an important role for example\nin transport properties of a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) or in sum rules for\nglueballs.\n  In [1] an operator product expansion (OPE) at zero temperature was performed\nfor the correlators of two scalar operators $O_1=-\\frac{1}{4} G^{\\mu \\nu}G_{\\mu\n\\nu}$ and two QCD energy-momentum tensors $T^{\\mu\\nu}$. There we presented\nanalytical two-loop results for the Wilson coefficient $C_1$ in front of the\ngluon condensate operator $O_1$. In this paper these results are extended to\nthree-loop order.\n  The three-loop Wilson coefficient $C_0$ in front of the unity operator\n$O_0=1$ was already presented in [1] for the $T^{\\mu\\nu}$-correlator. For the\n$O_1$-correlator the coefficient $C_0$ is known to four loop order from [2].\nFor the correlator of two pseudoscalar operators\n$\\tilde{O}_1=\\varepsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} G^{\\mu \\nu} G^{\\rho \\sigma}$ both\ncoefficients $C_0$ and $C_1$ were computed in [3] to three-loop order. At zero\ntemperature $C_0$ and $C_1$ are the leading Wilson coefficients in massless\nQCD.\n", "  We introduce mappings between spaces of functions on (super)manifolds that\ngeneralize pullbacks with respect to smooth maps but are, in general, nonlinear\n(actually, formal). The construction is based on canonical relations and\ngenerating functions. (The underlying structure is a formal category, which is\na \"thickening\" of the usual category of supermanifolds; it is close to the\ncategory of symplectic micromanifolds and their micromorphisms considered\nrecently by A. Weinstein and A. Cattaneo--B. Dherin--Weinstein.) There are two\nparallel settings, for even and odd functions. As an application, we show how\nsuch nonlinear pullbacks give $L_{\\infty}$-morphisms for algebras of functions\non homotopy Schouten or homotopy Poisson manifolds.\n", "  We provide a rigorous derivation of a quantum filter for the case of multiple\nmeasurements being made on a quantum system. We consider a class of measurement\nprocesses which are functions of bosonic field operators, including\ncombinations of diffusive and Poissonian processes. This covers the standard\ncases from quantum optics, where homodyne detection may be described as a\ndiffusive process and photon counting may be described as a Poissonian process.\nWe obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for any pair of such\nmeasurements taken at different output channels to satisfy a commutation\nrelationship. Then, we derive a general, multiple measurement quantum filter as\nan extension of a single-measurement quantum filter. As an application we\nexplicitly obtain the quantum filter corresponding to homodyne detection and\nphoton counting at the output ports of a beam splitter, correcting an earlier\nresult.\n", "  We consider the volumes of classical supermanifolds such as the supersphere,\ncomplex projective superspace, and Stiefel and Grassmann supermanifolds, with\nrespect to the natural metrics or symplectic structures. We show that the\nformulas for the volumes, upon certain universal normalization, can be obtained\nby an analytic continuation from the formulas for the volumes of the\ncorresponding ordinary manifolds.\n  Volumes of nontrivial supermanifolds may identically vanish. In 1970s,\nBerezin discovered that the total Haar measure of the unitary supergroup\n$\\un(n|m)$ vanishes unless $m=0$ or $n=0$, i.e., unless it reduces to the\nordinary unitary group $\\un(n)$ or $\\un(m)$. Witten recently suggested that the\n(Liouville) volume of a compact even symplectic supermanifold should always be\nzero if it is not an ordinary manifold. Our calculations provide\ncounterexamples to this conjecture. On the other hand, we give a simple\nexplanation of Berezin's statement and generalize it to the Stiefel\nsupermanifold $\\st_{r|s}(\\C{n|m})$. There are also possible connections with\nthe recent works by Mkrtchyan and Veselov on `universal formulas' in Lie\nalgebra theory.\n", "  The Second Law of black hole thermodynamics is shown to hold for arbitrarily\ncomplicated theories of higher curvature gravity, so long as we allow only\nlinearized perturbations to stationary black holes. Some ambiguities in Wald's\nNoether charge method are resolved. The increasing quantity turns out to be the\nsame as the holographic entanglement entropy calculated by Dong. It is\nsuggested that only the linearization of the higher-curvature Second Law is\nimportant, when consistently truncating a UV-complete quantum gravity theory.\n", "  We give a full description of Darboux transformations of any order for\narbitrary (nondegenerate) differential operators on the superline. We show that\nevery Darboux transformation of such operators factorizes into elementary\nDarboux transformations of order one. Similar statement holds for operators on\nthe ordinary line.\n", "  We show that thick morphisms (or microformal morphisms) between smooth\n(super)manifolds, introduced by us before, are classical limits of `quantum\nthick morphisms' defined here as particular oscillatory integral operators on\nfunctions.\n", "  We report the reduction in residual stress of AlN thin films and also the\ncrystal structure, surface morphology and nanomechanical properties of\nmagnetron sputtered as a function of substrate temperature (Ts, 35 - 600 ?C).\nThe residual stress of these films was calculated by sin2 technique and found\nthat they are varying from tensile to compression with temperature (Ts).\nEvolution of crystalline growth of AlN films was studied by GIXRD and\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) and a preferred a-axis orientation was\nobserved at 400 ?C. The cross-sectional TEM micrograph and selected area\nelectron difraction (SAED) of this film exhibited a high degree of orientation\nas well as a columnar structure. Hardness (H) measured by Nanoindentation\ntechnique on these films ranged between 12.8 - 19 GPa.\n", "  We present analytical results for the QCD $\\beta$-function extended to the\ngaugeless limit of the unbroken phase of the Standard Model at four-loop level.\nApart from the strong coupling itself we include the top-Yukawa contribution\nand the Higgs self-coupling. We observe a non-naive $\\gamma_5$ contribution at\norder $y_t^4 g_s^4$, a feature not encountered in lower loop orders.\n", "  In this paper we construct two families of initial data being arbitrarily\nlarge under any scaling-invariant norm for which their corresponding weak\nsolution to the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations become smooth on\neither $[0,T_1]$ or $ [T_2,\\infty)$, respectively, where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are\ntwo times prescribed previously. In particular, $T_1$ can be arbitrarily large\nand $T_2$ can be arbitrarily small. Therefore, possible formation of\nsingularities would occur after a very long or short evolution time,\nrespectively.\n  We further prove that if a large part of the kinetic energy is consumed prior\nto the first (possible) blow-up time, then the global-in-time smoothness of the\nsolutions follows for the two families of initial data.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy in theories with gravitational or mixed U(1)\ngauge-gravitational anomalies in two, four and six dimensions. In such theories\nthere is an anomaly in the entanglement entropy: it depends on the choice of\nreference frame in which the theory is regulated. We discuss subtleties\nregarding regulators and entanglement entropies in anomalous theories. We then\nstudy the entanglement entropy of free chiral fermions and self-dual bosons and\nshow that in sufficiently symmetric situations this entanglement anomaly comes\nfrom an imbalance in the flux of modes flowing through the boundary, controlled\nby familiar index theorems. In two and four dimensions we use anomalous Ward\nidentities to find general expressions for the transformation of the\nentanglement entropy under a diffeomorphism. (In the case of a mixed anomaly\nthere is an alternative presentation of the theory in which the entanglement\nentropy is not invariant under a U(1) gauge transformation. The free-field\nmanifestation of this phenomenon involves a novel kind of fermion zero mode on\na gravitational background with a twist in the normal bundle to the entangling\nsurface.) We also study d-dimensional anomalous systems as the boundaries of d\n+ 1 dimensional gapped Hall phases. Here the full system is non-anomalous, but\nthe boundary anomaly manifests itself in a change in the entanglement entropy\nwhen the boundary metric is sheared relative to the bulk.\n", "  The light-trajectory in the gravitational field of N extended bodies in\narbitrary motion is determined in the first post-Newtonian approximation.\nAccording to the theory of reference systems, the gravitational fields of these\nmassive bodies are expressed in terms of their intrinsic multipoles, allowing\nfor arbitrary shape and inner structure of these bodies. The results of this\ninvestigation aim towards a consistent general-relativistic theory of light\npropagation in the Solar system for high-precision astrometry at\nsub-micro-arcsecond level of accuracy.\n", "  We derive a family of stochastic master equations describing homodyne\nmeasurement of multi-qubit diagonal observables in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics. In the regime where qubit decay can be neglected, our approach\nreplaces the polaron-like transformation of previous work, which required a\nlengthy calculation for the physically interesting case of three qubits and two\nresonator modes. The technique introduced here makes this calculation\nstraightforward and manifestly correct. Using this technique, we are able to\nshow that registers larger than one qubit evolve under a non-Markovian master\nequation. We perform numerical simulations of the three-qubit, two-mode case\nfrom previous work, obtaining an average post-measurement state fidelity of\n$\\sim 94\\%$, limited by measurement-induced decoherence and dephasing.\n", "  A nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) center in a nanodiamond, levitated in high\nvacuum, has recently been proposed as a probe for demonstrating mesoscopic\ncenter-of-mass superpositions \\cite{Scala2013, Zhang2013} and for testing\nquantum gravity \\cite{Albrecht2014}. Here, we study the behavior of optically\nlevitated nanodiamonds containing NV$^-$ centers at sub-atmospheric pressures\nand show that while they burn in air, this can be prevented by replacing the\nair with nitrogen. However, in nitrogen the nanodiamonds graphitize below\n$\\approx 10$ mB. Exploiting the Brownian motion of a levitated nanodiamond, we\nextract its internal temperature ($T_i$) and find that it would be detrimental\nto the NV$^-$ center's spin coherence time \\cite{Toyli2012}. These values of\n$T_i$ make it clear that the diamond is not melting, contradicting a recent\nsuggestion \\cite{Neukirch2015}. Additionally, using the measured damping rate\nof a levitated nanoparticle at a given pressure, we propose a new way of\ndetermining its size.\n", "  A four-dimensional photon polarization space, such that gives a different\ninterpretation of the ladder operators for the time-like degree comparing to\nthe Gupta-Bleuler formulation is presented. This interpretation, coming from\nthe construction of a covariant Hamiltonian, gives positive defined norms for\nall the four polarization degrees of freedom. This paper is written in the\nbackground of reducible representation algebras introduced by Czachor, although\nthe interpretation of the ladder operators as presented here could be done\nindependently. States that reproduce standard electromagnetic fields (i.e.\nphotons with two transverse polarizations) from the four-dimensional covariant\nformalism (i.e. with two additional longitudinal and time-like polarizations)\nare shown explicitly. Lastly, Lorentz and gauge transformations are discussed\nin detail.\n", "  QED cascades are complex avalanche processes of hard photon emission and\nelectron-positron pair creation driven by ultra-strong electromagnetic fields.\nThey play a fundamental role in astrophysical environments such as a pulsars'\nmagnetosphere, rendering an earth-based implementation with intense lasers\nattractive. In the literature, QED cascades were also predicted to limit the\nattainable intensity in a set-up of colliding laser beams in a tenuous gas such\nas the residual gas of a vacuum chamber, therefore severely hindering\nexperiments at extreme field intensities. Here, we demonstrate that the onset\nof QED cascades may be either prevented even at intensities around\n$10^{26}\\text{ W/cm$^{2}$}$ with tightly focused laser pulses and low-$Z$\ngases, or facilitated at intensities below $10^{24}\\text{ W/cm$^{2}$}$ with\nenlarged laser focal areas or high-$Z$ gases. These findings pave the way for\nthe control of novel experiments such as the generation of pure\nelectron-positron-photon plasmas from laser energy, and for probing QED in the\nextreme-intensity regime where the quantum vacuum becomes unstable.\n", "  We investigate the minimal theory of massive gravity (MTMG) recently\nintroduced. After reviewing the original construction based on its Hamiltonian\nin the vielbein formalism, we reformulate it in terms of its Lagrangian in both\nthe vielbein and the metric formalisms. It then becomes obvious that, unlike\nprevious attempts in the literature of Lorentz-violating massive gravity, not\nonly the potential but also the kinetic structure of the action is modified\nfrom the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. We confirm\nthat the number of physical degrees of freedom in MTMG is two at fully\nnonlinear level. This proves the absence of various possible pathologies such\nas superluminality, acausality and strong coupling. Afterwards, we discuss the\nphenomenology of MTMG in the presence of a dust fluid. We find that on a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic background we have two branches. One of them\n(self-accelerating branch) naturally leads to acceleration without the genuine\ncosmological constant or dark energy. For this branch both the scalar and the\nvector modes behave exactly as in general relativity (GR). The phenomenology of\nthis branch differs from GR in the tensor modes sector, as the tensor modes\nacquire a non-zero mass. Hence, MTMG serves as a stable nonlinear completion of\nthe self-accelerating cosmological solution found originally in dRGT theory.\nThe other branch (normal branch) has a dynamics which depends on the\ntime-dependent fiducial metric. For the normal branch, the scalar mode sector,\neven though as in GR only one scalar mode is present (due to the dust fluid),\ndiffers from the one in GR, and, in general, structure formation will follow a\ndifferent phenomenology. The tensor modes will be massive, whereas the vector\nmodes, for both branches, will have the same phenomenology as in GR.\n", "  In this paper we study the renormalization of the product of two operators\n$O_1=-\\frac{1}{4} G^{\\mu \\nu}G_{\\mu \\nu}$ in QCD. An insertion of two such\noperators $O_1(x)O_1(0)$ into a Greens function produces divergent contact\nterms for $x\\rightarrow 0$.\n  In the course of the computation of the operator product expansion (OPE) of\nthe correlator of two such operators $i\\int\\!\\mathrm{d}^4x\\,e^{iqx}\nT\\{\\,O_1(x)O_1(0)\\}$ to three-loop order we discovered that divergent contact\nterms remain not only in the leading Wilson coefficient $C_0$, which is just\nthe VEV of the correlator, but also in the Wilson coefficient $C_1$ in front of\n$O_1$. As this correlator plays an important role for example in QCD sum rules\na full understanding of its renormalization is desireable.\n  This work explains how the divergences encountered in higher orders of an OPE\nof this correlator should be absorbed in counterterms and derives an additive\nrenormalization constant for $C_1$ from first principles and to all orders in\nperturnbation theory. The method to derive the renormalization of this operator\nproduct is an extension of the ideas of a paper by Spiridonov and can be\ngeneralized to other cases.\n", "  The shell-model investigation is performed to show the impact on the\nstructure of $^{14}$C contributed by the off-diagonal cross-shell interaction,\n$\\langle pp \\mid$V$\\mid sdsd\\rangle$, which represents the mixing between the\n$0$ and $2\\hbar\\omega$ configurations in the $psd$ model space. Observed levels\nof the positive states in $^{14}$C can be nicely described in $0-4\\hbar\\omega$\nor a larger model space through the well defined Hamiltonians, YSOX and WBP,\nwith a reduction on the strength of the $\\langle pp \\mid$V$\\mid sdsd\\rangle$\ninteraction in the latter. The observed B(GT) values for $^{14}$C can be\ngenerally described by YSOX, while WBP and their modifications on the $\\langle\npp \\mid$V$\\mid sdsd\\rangle$ interaction fail for some values. Further\ninvestigation shows the effect of such interaction on the configuration mixing\nand occupancy. The present work shows examples on how the off-diagonal\ncross-shell interaction strongly drives the nuclear structure.\n", "  A stochastic filter uses a series of measurements over time to produce\nestimates of unknown variables based on a dynamic model. For a quantum system,\nsuch an algorithm is provided by a quantum filter, which is also known as a\nstochastic master equation (SME). For a linear quantum system subject to linear\nmeasurements and Gaussian noise, the quantum filter reduces to a quantum Kalman\nfilter. In this article, we introduce a quantum extended Kalman filter (quantum\nEKF), which applies a commutative approximation and a time-varying\nlinearization to non-commutative quantum stochastic differential equations\n(QSDEs). We will show that there are conditions under which a filter similar to\nthe classical EKF can be implemented for quantum systems. The boundedness of\nestimation errors and the filtering problems with `state-dependent' covariances\nfor process and measurement noises are also discussed. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the quantum EKF by applying it to systems which involve\nmultiple modes, nonlinear Hamiltonians and simultaneous jump-diffusive\nmeasurements.\n", "  While various phase-field models have recently appeared for two-phase fluids\nwith different densities, only some are known to be thermodynamically\nconsistent, and practical stable schemes for their numerical simulation are\nlacking. In this paper, we derive a new form of thermodynamically-consistent\nquasi-incompressible diffuse-interface Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model for a\ntwo-phase flow of incompressible fluids with different densities. The\nderivation is based on mixture theory by invoking the second law of\nthermodynamics and Coleman-Noll procedure. We also demonstrate that our model\nand some of the existing models are equivalent and we provide a unification\nbetween them. In addition, we develop a linear and energy-stable\ntime-integration scheme for the derived model. Such a linearly-implicit scheme\nis nontrivial, because it has to suitably deal with all nonlinear terms, in\nparticular those involving the density. Our proposed scheme is the first linear\nmethod for quasi-incompressible two-phase flows with nonsolenoidal velocity\nthat satisfies discrete energy dissipation independent of the time-step size,\nprovided that the mixture density remains positive. The scheme also preserves\nmass. Numerical experiments verify the suitability of the scheme for two-phase\nflow applications with high density ratios using large time steps by\nconsidering the coalescence and break-up dynamics of droplets including\npinching due to gravity.\n", "  We present the application of the pseudo-spectrum method to galaxy-galaxy\nlensing. We derive explicit expressions for the pseudo-spectrum analysis of the\ngalaxy-shear cross spectrum, which is the Fourier space counterpart of the\nstacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profile. The pseudo-spectrum method corrects\nobservational issues such as the survey geometry, masks of bright stars and\ntheir spikes, and inhomogeneous noise, which distort the spectrum and also mix\nthe E-mode and the B-mode signals. Using ray-tracing simulations in N-body\nsimulations including realistic masks, we confirm that the pseudo-spectrum\nmethod successfully recovers the input galaxy-shear cross spectrum. We also\ninvestigate the covariance of the galaxy-shear cross spectrum using the\nray-tracing simulations to show that there is an excess covariance relative to\nthe Gaussian covariance at small scales where the shot noise is dominated in\nthe Gaussian approximation. We find that the excess of the covariance is\nconsistent with the expectation from the halo sample variance (HSV), which\noriginates from the matter fluctuations at scales larger than the survey area.\nWe apply the pseudo-spectrum method to the observational data of\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing survey (CFHTLenS) shear catalogue and\nthree different spectroscopic samples of Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red\nGalaxy (SDSS LRG), and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS and\nLOWZ galaxies. The galaxy-shear cross spectra are significantly detected at the\nlevel of 7-10$\\sigma$ using the analytic covariance with the HSV contribution\nincluded. We also confirm that the observed spectra are consistent with the\nhalo model predictions with the halo occupation distribution parameters\nestimated from previous work. This work demonstrates the viability of\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing analysis in the Fourier space.\n", "  This work presents a comprehensive and extensive study to illustrate how the\ngeometrical configurations of low angular momentum axially symmetric general\nrelativistic matter flow in Schwarzschild metric may influence the formation of\nenergy preserving shocks for adiabatic/polytropic accretion as well as of\ntemperature preserving dissipative shocks for for the isothermal accretion onto\nnon-rotating astrophysical black holes. The dynamical and thermodynamic states\nof post shock polytropic and isothermal flow have been studied extensively for\nthree possible matter geometries, and it has been thoroughly discussed about\nhow such states depend on the flow structure, even when the self gravity and\nthe back reaction on the metric are not taken into account. Main purpose of\nthis paper is thus to mathematically demonstrate that for non-self gravitating\naccretion, various matter geometry, in addition to the corresponding space-time\ngeometry, controls the shock induced phenomena as observed within the black\nhole accretion discs. This work is expected to reveal how the shock generated\nphenomena (emergence of the outflows/flare or the behaviour of QPO of the\nassociated light curves) observed at the close proximity of the horizon depends\non the physical environment of the source harbouring a supermassive black hole.\n", "  We present analytical results for the leading top-Yukawa and QCD contribution\nto the $\\beta$-function for the Higgs self-coupling $\\lambda$ of the Standard\nModel at four-loop level, namely the part $\\propto y_t^4 g_s^6$ independently\nconfirming a result given in [1]. We also give the contribution $\\propto y_t^2\ng_s^6$ of the anomalous dimension of the Higgs field as well as the terms\n$\\propto y_t g_s^8$ to the top-Yukawa $\\beta$-function which can also be\nderived from the anomalous dimension of the top quark mass. We compare the\nresults with the RG functions of the correlators of two and four scalar\ncurrents in pure QCD and find a new relation between the anomalous dimension\n$\\gamma_0$ of the QCD vacuum energy and the anomalous dimension $\\gamma_m^{SS}$\nappearing in the RG equation of the correlator of two scalar currents. Together\nwith the recently computed top-Yukawa and QCD contributions to $\\beta_{g_s}$\n[2,3] the $\\beta$-functions presented here constitute the leading four-loop\ncontributions to the evolution of the Higgs self-coupling. A numerical estimate\nof these terms at the scale of the top-quark mass is presented as well as an\nanalysis of the impact on the evolution of $\\lambda$ up to the Planck scale and\nthe vacuum stability problem.\n", "  Topological semimetals represent a new class of quantum materials hosting\nDirac/Weyl fermions. The essential properties of topological fermions can be\nrevealed by quantum oscillations. Here we present the first systematic de\nHaas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation studies on the recently discovered\ntopological Dirac nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. From the angular dependence of\ndHvA oscillations, we have revealed the anisotropic Dirac bands in ZrSiS and\nfound surprisingly strong Zeeman splitting at low magnetic fields. The Land\\'e\ng-factor estimated from the separation of Zeeman splitting peaks is as large as\n38. From the analyses of dHvA oscillations, we also revealed nearly zero\neffective mass and exceptionally high quantum mobility for Dirac fermions in\nZrSiS. These results shed light on the nature of novel Dirac fermion physics of\nZrSiS.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a 2D topological code derived by concatenating\nthe [[4, 2, 2]] code with the toric/surface code, or alternatively by removing\ncheck operators from the 2D square-octagon or 4.8.8 color code. We show that\nthe resulting code has a circuit-based noise threshold of $\\sim 0.41\\%$\n(compared to $\\sim 0.6\\%$ for the toric code in a similar scenario), which is\nhigher than any known 2D color code. We believe that the construction may be of\ninterest for hardware in which one wants to use both long-range two-qubit gates\nas well as short-range gates between small clusters of qubits.\n", "  Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as\nwell as the calculus they imply, are non-unique. The examples of\nfour-dimensional spaces, $\\mathbb{R}_+^4$ and $(-L/2,L/2)^4$, are considered\nwhere different types of arithmetic and calculus coexist simultaneously. In all\nthe examples there exists a non-Diophantine arithmetic that makes the space\nglobally Minkowskian, and thus the laws of physics are formulated in terms of\nthe corresponding calculus. However, when one switches to the `natural'\nDiophantine arithmetic and calculus, the Minkowskian character of the space is\nlost and what one effectively obtains is a Lorentzian manifold. I discuss in\nmore detail the problem of electromagnetic fields produced by a pointlike\ncharge. The solution has the standard form when expressed in terms of the\nnon-Diophantine formalism. When the `natural' formalsm is used, the same\nsolution looks as if the fields were created by a charge located in an\nexpanding universe, with nontrivially accelerating expansion. The effect is\nclearly visible also in solutions of the Friedman equation with vanishing\ncosmological constant. All of this suggests that phenomena attributed to dark\nenergy may be a manifestation of a miss-match between the arithmetic employed\nin mathematical modeling, and the one occurring at the level of natural laws.\nArithmetic is as physical as geometry.\n", "  We derive an exact quantum propagator for nonadiabatic dynamics in\nmulti-state systems using the mapping variable representation, where\nclassical-like Cartesian variables are used to represent both continuous\nnuclear degrees of freedom and discrete electronic states. The resulting\nexpression is a Moyal series that, when suitably approximated, can allow for\nthe use of classical dynamics to efficiently model large systems. We\ndemonstrate that different truncations of the exact propagator lead to existing\napproximate semiclassical and mixed quantum-classical methods and we derive an\nassociated error term for each method. Furthermore, by combining the\nimaginary-time path-integral representation of the Boltzmann operator with the\nexact propagator, we obtain an analytic expression for thermal quantum\nreal-time correlation functions. These results provide a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation for the development of accurate and efficient classical-like\ndynamics to compute observables such as electron transfer reaction rates in\ncomplex quantized systems.\n", "  Galactic systems, and the Universe at large, exhibit large dynamical\nanomalies: The observed matter in them falls very short of providing enough\ngravity to account for their dynamics. The mainstream response to this\nconundrum is to invoke large quantities of `dark matter' -- which purportedly\nsupplies the needed extra gravity -- and also of `dark energy', to account for\nfurther anomalies in cosmology, such as the observed, accelerated expansion.\nThe MOND paradigm offers a different solution: a breakdown of standard dynamics\n(gravity and/or inertia) in the limit of low accelerations -- below some\nacceleration $a_0$. In this limit, dynamics become space-time scale invariant,\nand is controlled by a gravitational constant $\\mathcal{A}_0\\equiv Ga_0$, which\nreplaces Newton's $G$. With the new dynamics, the various detailed\nmanifestations of the anomalies in galaxies are predicted with no need for dark\nmatter. The cosmological anomalies could, but need not have to do with small\naccelerations. For example, the need for dark matter in accounting for the\nexpansion history of the Universe is eliminated if the relevant gravitational\nconstant is $\\approx 2\\pi G$. Such a `renormalization' of $G$ could be a\ndimensionless parameter of a MOND theory. The constant $a_0$ turns out to carry\ncosmological connotations, in that $2\\pi a_0\\approx cH_0\\approx\nc^2(\\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$, where $H_0$ is the present expansion rate of the\nUniverse, and $\\Lambda$ the measured `cosmological constant'. There are MOND\ntheories in which this `coincidence' is natural. I draw on enlightening\nhistorical and conceptual analogies from quantum theory to limelight aspects of\nMOND. I also explain how MOND may have strong connections with effects of the\nquantum vacuum on local dynamics.\n", "  High-precision astrometry on sub-micro-arcsecond level in angular resolution\nrequires accurate determination of the trajectory of a light-signal from the\ncelestial light source through the gravitational field of the Solar system\ntoward the observer. In this investigation the light trajectory in the\ngravitational field of N moving bodies is determined in the 1.5 post-Newtonian\napproximation. In the approach presented two specific issues of particular\nimportance are accounted for:\n  (1) According to the recommendations of International Astronomical Union, the\nmetric of the Solar system is expressed in terms of intrinsic mass-multipoles\nand intrinsic spin-multipoles of the massive bodies, allowing for arbitrary\nshape, inner structure and rotational motion of the massive bodies of the Solar\nsystem.\n  (2) The Solar system bodies move along arbitrary worldlines which can later\nbe specified by Solar system ephemeris.\n  The presented analytical solution for light trajectory is a primary\nrequirement for extremely high-precision astrometry on sub-micro-arcsecond\nlevel of accuracy and associated massive computations in astrometric data\nreduction. An estimation of the numerical magnitude for time delay and light\ndeflection of the leading multipoles is given.\n", "  The far-infrared [C II] 158 micrometer fine structure transition is\nconsidered to be a dominant coolant in the interstellar medium. For this\nreason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer\nthe heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate in local, as well as in\nhigh redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the\nGalactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether C II is indeed a\ngood tracer of the star formation rate. For a sample of high Galactic latitude\nsightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C\nII in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The\ncold gas fraction (~ 10 - 50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not\nnegligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that, to correctly\nestimate the star formation rate, C II cooling in both the phases should hence\nbe considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from\neither the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts\nthe star formation rate, respectively. These results are particularly important\nin the context of the Damped Lyman-alpha systems for which a similar method is\noften used to estimate the star formation rate. The derived star formation\nrates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under\nconsideration is not constrained independently.\n", "  After the recognition of the possibility to implement Majorana fermions using\nthe building blocks of solid-state matters, the detection of this peculiar\nparticle has been an intense focus of research. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate a collection of Majorana fermions living in a one-dimensional\ntransport channel at the boundary of a superconducting quantum anomalous Hall\ninsulator thin film. A series of topological phase changes are controlled by\nthe reversal of the magnetization, where a half-integer quantized conductance\nplateau (0.5e2/h) is observed as a clear signature of the Majorana phase. This\ntransport signature can be well repeated during many magnetic reversal sweeps,\nand can be tracked at different temperatures, providing a promising evidence of\nthe chiral Majorana edge modes in the system.\n", "  The problem of bubble domain generation is revisited from a new perspective\nthat was opened by recent findings in the field of physics of magnetic\nskyrmions. The single bubble domain can be generated under the tip electrode\ntouching the surface of dielectric iron garnet film by positive step-like\nvoltage pulse and its equilibrium size can be increased with further rising of\nelectric potential. The theoretical analysis shows that the same mechanism can\nbe used to stabilize the submicron bubbles topologically equivalent to the\nskyrmion.\n", "  In this paper, we present the ability of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) equation,\nusually applied to simulate fluid flows, to simulate various shapes of\ncrystals. Crystal growth is modeled with a phase-field model for a pure\nsubstance, numerically solved with a LB method in 2D and 3D. This study focuses\non the anisotropy function that is responsible for the anisotropic surface\ntension between the solid phase and the liquid phase. The anisotropy function\ninvolves the unit normal vectors of the interface, defined by gradients of\nphase-field. Those gradients have to be consistent with the underlying lattice\nof the LB method in order to avoid unwanted effects of numerical anisotropy.\nIsotropy of the solution is obtained when the directional derivatives method,\nspecific for each lattice, is applied for computing the gradient terms. With\nthe central finite differences method, the phase-field does not match with its\nrotation and the solution is not any more isotropic. Next, the method is\napplied to simulate simultaneous growth of several crystals, each of them being\ndefined by its own anisotropy function. Finally, various shapes of 3D crystals\nare simulated with standard and non standard anisotropy functions which favor\ngrowth in <100>-, <110>- and <111>-directions.\n", "  We show the entanglement entropy in certain quantum field theories to contain\nstate-dependent divergences. Both perturbative and holographic examples are\nexhibited. However, quantities such as the relative entropy and the generalized\nentropy of black holes remain finite, due to cancellation of divergences. We\nclassify all possible state-dependent divergences that can appear in both\nperturbatively renormalizeable and holographic covariant $d\\le 6$ quantum field\ntheories.\n", "  In this work we study the spin accumulation due to an in-plane electric field\nin an asymmetric topological insulator (TI) thin film system with an out of\nplane magnetic field and an in-plane magnetization. A TI thin film differs from\nthe more typically studied thick TI system in that the former has both a top\nand a bottom surface where the states localized at both surfaces can couple to\neach other due to the finite thickness. In typical spin torque experiments on\nTI thin film systems, the top and bottom surfaces of the film are asymmetric as\nthe former is in contact with a ferromagnetic layer while the latter is\nadjacent to a non magnetic substrate. This may lead to differing (i) potentials\nand (ii) magnetization strengths experienced by the top and bottom surface\nstates. We show, via Kubo formula calculations, that each of these two effects\ncan lead to in-plane spin accumulation perpendicular to the magnetization\ndirection which are otherwise absent in a top-bottom symmetric TI thin film\nsystem. This spin accumulation results from the breaking of the antisymmetry of\nthe spin accumulation around the zero magnetic field equal energy contours.\n", "  We study a mesoscopic model of a chemically active colloidal particle which\non certain parts of its surface promotes chemical reactions in the surrounding\nsolution. For reasons of simplicity and conceptual clarity, we focus on the\ncase in which only electrically neutral species are present in the solution and\non chemical reactions which are described by first order kinetics. Within a\nself-consistent approach we explicitly determine the steady state product and\nreactant number density fields around the colloid as functionals of the\ninteraction potentials of the various molecular species in solution with the\ncolloid. By using Teubner's reciprocal theorem, this allows us to compute and\nto interpret -- in a transparent way in terms of the classical Smoluchowski\ntheory of chemical kinetics -- the external force needed to keep such a\ncatalytically active colloid at rest (\\textit{stall} force) or, equivalently,\nthe corresponding velocity of the colloid \\textit{if} it is free to move. We\nuse the particular case of triangular-well interaction potentials as a\nbenchmark example for applying the general theoretical framework developed\nhere. For this latter case, we derive explicit expressions for the dependences\nof the quantities of interest on the diffusion coefficients of the chemical\nspecies, the reaction rate constant, the coverage by catalyst, the size of the\ncolloid, as well as on the parameters of the interaction potentials. These\nexpressions provide a detailed picture of the phenomenology associated with\ncatalytically-active colloids and self-diffusiophoresis.\n", "  Blind quantum computation protocols allow a user to delegate a computation to\na remote quantum computer in such a way that the privacy of their computation\nis preserved, even from the device implementing the computation. To date, such\nprotocols are only known for settings involving at least two quantum devices:\neither a user with some quantum capabilities and a remote quantum server or two\nor more entangled but noncommunicating servers. In this work, we take the first\nstep towards the construction of a blind quantum computing protocol with a\ncompletely classical client and single quantum server. Specifically, we show\nhow a classical client can exploit the ambiguity in the flow of information in\nmeasurement-based quantum computing to construct a protocol for hiding critical\naspects of a computation delegated to a remote quantum computer. This ambiguity\narises due to the fact that, for a fixed graph, there exist multiple choices of\nthe input and output vertex sets that result in deterministic measurement\npatterns consistent with the same fixed total ordering of vertices. This allows\na classical user, computing only measurement angles, to drive a\nmeasurement-based computation performed on a remote device while hiding\ncritical aspects of the computation.\n", "  The occurrence of revivals of quantum entanglement between separated open\nquantum systems has been shown not only for dissipative non-Markovian quantum\nenvironments but also for classical environments in absence of back-action.\nWhile the phenomenon is well understood in the first case, the possibility to\nretrieve entanglement when the composite quantum system is subject to local\nclassical noise has generated a debate regarding its interpretation. This\ndynamical property of open quantum systems assumes an important role in quantum\ninformation theory from both fundamental and practical perspectives. Hybrid\nquantum-classical systems are in fact promising candidates to investigate the\ninterplay among quantum and classical features and to look for possible control\nstrategies of a quantum system by means of a classical device. Here we present\nan overview on this topic, reporting the most recent theoretical and\nexperimental results about the revivals of entanglement between two qubits\nlocally interacting with classical environments. We also review and discuss the\ninterpretations provided so far to explain this phenomenon, suggesting that\nthey can be cast under a unified viewpoint.\n", "  In conventional thermodynamics, it is widely acknowledged that the\nrealization of an isothermal process for a system requires a quasi-static\ncontrolling protocol. Here we propose and design a strategy to realize a\nfinite-rate isothermal transition from an equilibrium state to another one with\nsame temperature, which is named shortcut to isothermality~(STI). By using STI,\nwe unexpectedly derive three nonequilibrium work relations, including an\nidentity between the free energy difference and the mean work due to the\npotential of the original system, a generalized Jarzynski equality, and the\ninverse relationship between the irreversible work and the total driving time.\nWe numerically confirm these three relations by considering the motion of a\nBrownian particle trapped in a harmonic potential and dragged by a\ntime-dependent force.\n", "  Von Neumann's classic \"multiplexing\" method is unique in achieving\nhigh-threshold fault-tolerant classical computation (FTCC), but has several\nsignificant barriers to implementation: i) the extremely complex circuits\nrequired by randomized connections, ii) the difficulty of calculating its\nperformance in practical regimes of both code size and logical error rate, and\niii) the (perceived) need for large code sizes. Here we present numerical\nresults indicating that the third assertion is false, and introduce a novel\nscheme that eliminates the two remaining problems while retaining a threshold\nvery close to von Neumann's ideal of 1/6. We present a simple, highly ordered\nwiring structure that vastly reduces the circuit complexity, demonstrates that\nrandomization is unnecessary, and provides a feasible method to calculate the\nperformance. This in turn allows us to show that the scheme requires only\nmoderate code sizes, vastly outperforms concatenation schemes, and under a\nstandard error model a unitary implementation realizes universal FTCC with an\naccuracy threshold of p < 5.5%, in which p is the error probability for 3-qubit\ngates. FTCC is a key component in realizing measurement-free protocols for\nquantum information processing. In view of this we use our scheme to show that\nall-unitary quantum circuits can reproduce any measurement-based feedback\nprocess in which the asymptotic error probabilities for the measurement and\nfeedback are 0.51p and 1.51p, respectively.\n", "  We present analytical results at four-loop level for the $\\beta$-function of\nthe coupling of a generic gauge group and any number of different quark\nrepresentations. From this we can directly derive the gluino contribution to\nthe strong coupling $\\beta$-function of supersymmetric extensions of the\nStandard Model.\n", "  We introduce a new relativistic astrophysics code, SpECTRE, that combines a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method with a task-based parallelism model. SpECTRE's\ngoal is to achieve more accurate solutions for challenging relativistic\nastrophysics problems such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star\nmergers. The robustness of the discontinuous Galerkin method allows for the use\nof high-resolution shock capturing methods in regions where (relativistic)\nshocks are found, while exploiting high-order accuracy in smooth regions. A\ntask-based parallelism model allows efficient use of the largest supercomputers\nfor problems with a heterogeneous workload over disparate spatial and temporal\nscales. We argue that the locality and algorithmic structure of discontinuous\nGalerkin methods will exhibit good scalability within a task-based parallelism\nframework. We demonstrate the code on a wide variety of challenging benchmark\nproblems in (non)-relativistic (magneto)-hydrodynamics. We demonstrate the\ncode's scalability including its strong scaling on the NCSA Blue Waters\nsupercomputer up to the machine's full capacity of 22,380 nodes using 671,400\nthreads.\n", "  Clathrate hydrates hold considerable promise as safe and economical materials\nfor hydrogen storage. Here we present a quantum mechanical study of H$_2$ and\nD$_2$ diffusion through a hexagonal face shared by two large cages of clathrate\nhydrates over a wide range of temperatures. Path integral molecular dynamics\nsimulations are used to compute the free-energy profiles for the diffusion of\nH$_2$ and D$_2$ as a function of temperature. Ring polymer molecular dynamics\nrate theory, incorporating both exact quantum statistics and approximate\nquantum dynamical effects, is utilized in the calculations of the H$_2$ and\nD$_2$ diffusion rates in a broad temperature interval. We find that the shape\nof the quantum free-energy profiles and their height relative to the classical\nfree energy barriers at a given temperature, as well as the rate of diffusion,\nare profoundly affected by competing quantum effects: above 25 K, zero-point\nenergy (ZPE) perpendicular to the reaction path for diffusion between cavities\ndecreases the quantum rate compared to the classical rate, whereas at lower\ntemperatures tunneling outcompetes the ZPE and as result the quantum rate is\ngreater than the classical rate.\n", "  We present the improved visibility based Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) for\nthe power spectrum of the diffuse sky signal. The visibilities are gridded to\nreduce the computation, and tapered through a convolution to suppress the\ncontribution from the outer regions of the telescope's field of view. The TGE\nalso internally estimates the noise bias, and subtracts this out to give an\nunbiased estimate of the power spectrum. An earlier version of the 2D TGE for\nthe angular power spectrum $C_{\\ell}$ is improved and then extended to obtain\nthe 3D TGE for the power spectrum $P({\\bf k})$ of the 21-cm brightness\ntemperature fluctuations. Analytic formulas are also presented for predicting\nthe variance of the binned power spectrum. The estimator and its variance\npredictions are validated using simulations of $150 \\, {\\rm MHz}$ GMRT\nobservations. We find that the estimator accurately recovers the input model\nfor the 1D Spherical Power Spectrum $P(k)$ and the 2D Cylindrical Power\nSpectrum $P(k_\\perp,k_\\parallel)$, and the predicted variance is also in\nreasonably good agreement with the simulations.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of holographic entanglement R\\'enyi entropy in\nsome modified theories of gravity with four dimensional conformal field theory\nduals. First, we construct perturbative black hole solutions in a recently\nproposed model of Einsteinian cubic gravity in five dimensions, and compute the\nR\\'enyi entropy as well as the scaling dimension of the twist operators in the\ndual field theory. Consistency of these results are verified from the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, via a corresponding computation of the Weyl anomaly on the\ngravity side. Similar analyses are then carried out for three other examples of\nmodified gravity in five dimensions that include a chemical potential, namely\nBorn-Infeld gravity, charged quasi-topological gravity and a class of Weyl\ncorrected gravity theories with a gauge field, with the last example being\ntreated perturbatively. Some interesting bounds in the dual conformal field\ntheory parameters in quasi-topological gravity are pointed out. We also provide\narguments on the validity of our perturbative analysis, whenever applicable.\n", "  We describe explicit formulas relevant to the F-theory/heterotic string\nduality that reconstruct from a specific Jacobian elliptic fibration on the\nShioda-Inose surface covering a generic Kummer surface the corresponding\ngenus-two curve using the level-two Satake coordinate functions. We derive\nexplicitly the rational map on the moduli space of genus-two curves realizing\nthe algebraic correspondence between a sextic curve and its Satake sextic. We\nwill prove that it is not the original sextic defining the genus-two curve, but\nits corresponding Satake sextic which is manifest in the F-theory model, dual\nto the $\\mathfrak{so}(32)$ heterotic string with an unbroken\n$\\mathfrak{so}(28)\\oplus \\mathfrak{su}(2)$ gauge algebra.\n", "  We investigate a 6d Dirac fermion on a rectangle. It is found that the 4d\nspectrum is governed by $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Then we\ndemonstrate that the supersymmetry is very useful for classifying all the\nallowed boundary conditions and to expand the 6d Dirac field in Kaluza-Klein\nmodes. A striking feature of the model is that even though the 6d Dirac fermion\nhas non-vanishing bulk mass, the 4d mass spectrum can contain degenerate\nmassless chiral fermions, which may provide a hint to solve the problem of the\ngeneration of quarks and leptons. It is pointed out that zero-energy solutions\nare not affected by the presence of the boundaries, while the boundary\nconditions work well for determining the positive-energy solutions. We also\nprovide a brief discussion on possible boundary conditions in the general case,\nespecially those on polygons.\n", "  We describe a new type of gravity-matter models where gravity couples in a\nnon-conventional way to two distinct scalar fields providing a unified\nLagrangian action principle description of: (a) the evolution of both \"early\"\nand \"late\" Universe - by the \"inflaton\" scalar field; (b) dark energy and dark\nmatter as a unified manifestation of a single material entity - the \"darkon\"\nscalar field. The essential non-standard feature of our models is employing the\nformalism of non-Riemannian space-time volume forms - alternative generally\ncovariant integration measure densities (volume elements) defined in terms of\nauxiliary antisymmetric tensor gauge fields. Although being (almost) pure-gauge\ndegrees of freedom, the non-Riemannian space-time volume forms trigger a series\nof important features unavailable in ordinary gravity-matter models. When\nincluding in addition interactions with the electro-weak model bosonic sector\nwe obtain a gravity-assisted generation of electro-weak spontaneous gauge\nsymmetry breaking in the post-inflationary \"late\" Universe, while the\nHiggs-like scalar remains massless in the \"early\" Universe.\n", "  We present a coupled continuum formulation for the electrostatic, chemical,\nthermal and mechanical processes in battery materials. Our treatment applies on\nthe macroscopic scale, at which electrodes can be modelled as porous materials\nmade up of active particles held together by binders and perfused by the\nelectrolyte. Starting with the description common to the field, in terms of\nreaction-transport partial differential equations for ions, variants of the\nclassical Poisson equation for electrostatics, and the heat equation, we add\nmechanics to the problem. Our main contribution is to model the evolution of\nporosity as a consequence of strains induced by intercalation, thermal\nexpansion and mechanical stresses. Recognizing the potential for large local\ndeformations, we have settled on the finite strain framework. We present a\ndetailed computational study of the influence of the dynamically evolving\nporosity, upon ion distribution, electrostatic potential fields,\ncharge-discharge cycles and mechanical force generated in the cell.\n", "  We define Laguerre and Jacobi analogues of the Warren process. That is, we\nconstruct local dynamics on a triangular array of particles so that the\nprojections to each level recover the Laguerre and Jacobi eigenvalue processes\nof K\\\"onig-O'Connell and Doumerc and the fixed time distributions recover the\njoint distribution of eigenvalues in multilevel Laguerre and Jacobi random\nmatrix ensembles. Our techniques extend and generalize the framework of\nintertwining diffusions developed by Pal-Shkolnikov. One consequence is the\nconstruction of particle systems with local interactions whose fixed time\ndistribution recovers the hard edge of random matrix theory. An appendix by\nAndrey Sarantsev establishes strong existence and uniqueness for solutions to\nSDER's satisfied by these processes.\n", "  We forecast constraints on neutral hydrogen (HI) and cosmological parameters\nusing near-term intensity mapping surveys with instruments such as BINGO,\nMeerKAT, and the SKA, and Stage III and IV optical galaxy surveys. If\nforegrounds and systematic effects can be controlled - a problem which becomes\nmuch easier in cross-correlation - these surveys will provide exquisite\nmeasurements of the HI density and bias, as well as measurements of the growth\nof structure, the angular diameter distance, and the Hubble rate, over a wide\nrange of redshift. We also investigate the possibility of detecting the late\ntime ISW effect using the Planck satellite and forthcoming intensity mapping\nsurveys, finding that a large sky survey with Phase 1 of the SKA can achieve a\nnear optimal detection.\n", "  We show that it is possible to generate a novel single-photon fringe pattern\nby using two spatially separated identical bi-photon sources. The fringes are\nsimilar to the ones observed in a Michelson interferometer and possess certain\nremarkable properties with potential applications. A striking feature of the\nfringes is that although the pattern is obtained by detecting only one photon\nof each photon pair, the fringes shift due to a change in the optical path\ntraversed by the undetected photon. The fringe shift is characterized by a\ncombination of wavelengths of both photons, which implies that the wavelength\nof a photon can be measured without detecting it. Furthermore, the visibility\nof the fringes diminishes as the correlation between the transverse momenta of\ntwin photons decreases: visibility is unity for maximum momentum correlation\nand zero for no momentum correlation. We also show that the momentum\ncorrelation between the two photons of a pair can be determined from the\nsingle-photon interference pattern. We thus for the first time propose a method\nof measuring a two-photon correlation without coincidence or heralded\ndetection.\n", "  We study the quasinormal modes of the massless scalar field of charged black\nholes embedded in the Randal-Sundrum brane world using the third order WKB\napproximation. We consider the effects of the electromagnetic and tidal charges\non quasinormal frequencies spectrum for charged black hole black holes as well\nas the effect of the thickness of the bulk.\n", "  We delineated the role of thermally excited ripples on thermal expansion\nproperties of 2D honeycomb materials (free-standing graphene, 2D h-BN, and\nML-MoS2), by explicitly carrying out three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional\n(2D) molecular dynamics simulations. In 3D simulations, the in-plane lattice\nparameter (a-lattice) of graphene and 2D h-BN shows thermal contraction over a\nwide range of temperatures and exhibits a strong system size dependence. The 2D\nsimulations of the very same system show a reverse trend, where the a-lattice\nis expanding in the whole computed temperature range. Contrary to graphene and\n2D h-BN, the a-lattice of ML-MoS2 shows thermal expansion in both 2D and 3D\nsimulations and their system size dependence is marginal. By analyzing the\nphonon dispersion at 300 K, we found that the discrepancy between 2D and 3D\nsimulations of graphene and 2D h-BN is due to the absence of out-of-plane\nbending mode (ZA) in 2D simulations, which is responsible for thermal\ncontraction of a-lattice at low temperature. Meanwhile, all the phonon modes\nare present in 2D phonon dispersion of ML-MoS2, which indicates that the origin\nof ZA mode is not purely due to out-of-plane movement of atoms and also its\neffect on thermal expansion is not significant as found in graphene and 2D h-BN\n", "  Organic chromophores with heteroatoms possess an important excited state\nrelaxation channel from an optically allowed {\\pi}{\\pi}* to a dark\nn{\\pi}*state. We exploit the element and site specificity of soft x-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy to selectively follow the electronic change during the\n{\\pi}{\\pi}*/n{\\pi}* internal conversion. As a hole forms in the n orbital\nduring {\\pi}{\\pi}*/n{\\pi}* internal conversion, the near edge x-ray absorption\nfine structure (NEXAFS) spectrum at the heteroatom K-edge exhibits an\nadditional resonance. We demonstrate the concept with the nucleobase thymine, a\nprototypical heteroatomic chromophore. With the help of time resolved NEXAFS\nspectroscopy at the oxygen K-edge, we unambiguously show that\n{\\pi}{\\pi}*/n{\\pi}* internal conversion takes place within (60 \\pm 30) fs.\nHigh-level coupled cluster calculations on the isolated molecules used in the\nexperiment confirm the superb electronic structure sensitivity of this new\nmethod for excited state investigations.\n", "  We study in some detail the properties of the mathematically correct\nformulation of the classical Einstein-Rosen \"bridge\" as proposed in the\noriginal 1935 paper, which was shown in a series of previous papers of ours to\nrepresent the simplest example of a static spherically symmetric traversable\nlightlike thin-shell wormhole. Thus, the original Einstein-Rosen \"bridge\" is\nnot equivalent to the concept of the dynamical and non-traversable\nSchwarzschild wormhole, also called \"Einstein-Rosen bridge\" in modern textbooks\non general relativity. The original Einstein-Rosen \"bridge\" requires the\npresence of a special kind of \"exotic\" matter source located on its throat\nwhich was shown to be the simplest member of the previously introduced by us\nclass of lightlike membranes. We introduce and exploit the Kruskal-Penrose\ndescription of the original Einstein-Rosen \"bridge\". In particular, we\nexplicitly construct closed timelike geodesics on the pertinent Kruskal-Penrose\nmanifold.\n", "  The content of interstellar clouds, in particular the inventory of diffuse\nmolecular gas, remains uncertain. We identified a sample of isolated clouds,\napproximately 100 solar masses in size, and used the dust content to estimate\nthe total amount of gas. In Paper 1, the total inferred gas content was found\nsignificantly larger than that seen in 21-cm emission measurements of atomic\nhydrogen. In this paper we test the hypothesis that the apparent excess 'dark'\ngas is cold atomic hydrogen, which would be evident in absorption but not in\nemission due to line saturation. The results show there is not enough 21-cm\nabsorption toward the clouds to explain the total amount of 'dark' gas.\n", "  The dynamical evolution of entanglement between two polarizable two-level\natoms in weak interaction with electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is\ninvestigated. We find that, for initial Bell state $\\psi^{\\pm}$, the decay rate\nof entanglement between atoms is just the superradiant spontaneous emission\nrate, which depends not only on the spontaneous emission rate of atom but also\non the modulation of the spontaneous emission rate due to the presence of\nanother atom. It is shown that, with the presence of a boundary, the\nentanglement between transversely polarizable atoms can be protected for a very\nlong time. It is pointed out that when the two atoms in initial Bell state\n$\\psi^{-}$ are put close enough , the entanglement between them can also be\nprotected.\n", "  We present BPS indices of the supergroup WZW models that live on intersecting\nM2-M5 brane systems. They can encode data of the stretched M2-branes between\nM5-branes and count the BPS states. They are generally expressed in terms of\nmock theta functions via the Kac-Wakimoto character formula of the affine Lie\nsuperalgebra. We give an explicit expression of the index for the\n$PSL(2|2)_{k=1}$ WZW model in terms of the second order multi-variable\nAppell-Lerch sum. It indicates that wall-crossing occurs in the BPS state\ncounting due to the $C$-field on the M5-branes.\n", "  All-optical photonic devices are crucial for many important photonic\ntechnology and applications, ranging from optical communication to quantum\ninformation processing. Conventional design of all-optical devices is based on\nphoton propagation and interference in real space, which may reply on large\nnumbers of optical elements and are challenging for precise control. Here we\npropose a new route for engineering all-optical devices using photon internal\ndegrees of freedom, which form photonic crystals in such synthetic dimensions\nfor photon propagation and interference. We demonstrate this new design concept\nby showing how important optical devices such as quantum memory and optical\nfilter can be realized using synthetic orbital angular momentum (OAM) lattices\nin a single main degenerate cavity. The new designing route utilizing synthetic\nphotonic lattices may significantly reduce the requirement for numerous optical\nelements and their fine tuning in conventional design, paving the way for\nrealistic all-optical photonic devices with novel functionalities.\n", "  The evolution of fairness in dyadic relationships has been studied using\nultimatum games. However, human fairness is not limited to two-person\nsituations and universal egalitarianism among group members is widely observed.\nIn this study, we investigated the evolution of favoritism and group fairness\nin a three-person ultimatum game (TUG) under a co-evolutionary framework with\nboth strategy updating and partner switching dynamics. In the TUG, one proposer\nmakes an offer to two responders and the proposal is accepted at the group\nlevel if at least one individual responder accepts the offer. Investigating\nfairness beyond dyadic relationships allows the possibility of favoritism\nbecause the proposer can secure acceptance at the group level by discriminating\nin favor of one responder. Our simulation showed that the proposer favors one\nresponder with a similar type when the frequency of partner switching is low.\nIn contrast, group fairness is observed when the frequency of partner switching\nis high. The correlation between strategy and neighborhood size suggested that\npartner switching influences the strategy through the proposer's offer rather\nthan through the responder's acceptance threshold. In addition, the average\ndegree negatively impacts the emergence of fairness unless the frequency of\npartner switching is high. Furthermore, a higher frequency of partner switching\ncan support the evolution of fairness when the maximum number of games in one\ntime step is restricted to smaller values.\n", "  Motivated by the recent interests in spin$-2$ massive gravitons, we study the\nstructure of neutron star in the context of massive gravity. The modifications\nof TOV equation in the presence of massive gravity are explored in $4$ and\nhigher dimensions. Next, by considering the modern equation of state for the\nneutron star matter (which is extracted by the lowest order constrained\nvariational (LOCV) method with the AV$18$ potential), different physical\nproperties of the neutron star (such as Le Chatelier's principle, stability and\nenergy conditions) are investigated. It is shown that consideration of the\nmassive gravity has specific contributions into the structure of neutron star\nand introduces new prescriptions for the massive astrophysical objects. The\nmass-radius relation is examined and the effects of massive gravity on the\nSchwarzschild radius, average density, compactness, gravitational redshift and\ndynamical stability are studied. Finally, a relation between mass and radius of\nneutron star versus the Planck mass is extracted.\n", "  Thermal quantum time-correlation functions are of fundamental importance in\nquantum dynamics, allowing experimentally-measurable properties such as\nreaction rates, diffusion constants and vibrational spectra to be computed from\nfirst principles. Since the exact quantum solution scales exponentially with\nsystem size, there has been considerable effort in formulating reliable\nlinear-scaling methods involving exact quantum statistics and approximate\nquantum dynamics modelled with classical-like trajectories. Here we review\nrecent progress in the field with the development of methods including Centroid\nMolecular Dynamics (CMD), Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) and\nThermostatted RPMD (TRPMD). We show how these methods have recently been\nobtained from `Matsubara dynamics', a form of semiclassical dynamics which\nconserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. We also rederive t->0+ quantum\ntransition-state theory (QTST) in the Matsubara dynamics formalism showing that\nMatsubara-TST, like RPMD-TST, is equivalent to QTST. We end by surveying areas\nfor future progress.\n", "  Radio interferometric imaging aims to estimate an unknown sky intensity image\nfrom degraded observations, acquired through an antenna array. In the\ntheoretical case of a perfectly calibrated array, it has been shown that\nsolving the corresponding imaging problem by iterative algorithms based on\nconvex optimization and compressive sensing theory can be competitive with\nclassical algorithms such as CLEAN. However, in practice, antenna-based gains\nare unknown and have to be calibrated. Future radio telescopes, such as the\nSKA, aim at improving imaging resolution and sensitivity by orders of\nmagnitude. At this precision level, the direction-dependency of the gains must\nbe accounted for, and radio interferometric imaging can be understood as a\nblind deconvolution problem. In this context, the underlying minimization\nproblem is non-convex, and adapted techniques have to be designed. In this\nwork, leveraging recent developments in non-convex optimization, we propose the\nfirst joint calibration and imaging method in radio interferometry, with proven\nconvergence guarantees. Our approach, based on a block-coordinate\nforward-backward algorithm, jointly accounts for visibilities and suitable\npriors on both the image and the direction-dependent effects (DDEs). As\ndemonstrated in recent works, sparsity remains the prior of choice for the\nimage, while DDEs are modelled as smooth functions of the sky, i.e. spatially\nband-limited. Finally, we show through simulations the efficiency of our\nmethod, for the reconstruction of both images of point sources and complex\nextended sources. MATLAB code is available on GitHub.\n", "  We give an overview of some remarkable connections between symmetric\ninformationally complete measurements (SIC-POVMs, or SICs) and algebraic number\ntheory, in particular, a connection with Hilbert's 12th problem. The paper is\nmeant to be intelligible to a physicist who has no prior knowledge of either\nGalois theory or algebraic number theory.\n", "  This article reports on the detailed study of the three-gluon vertex in\nfour-dimensional $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory employing lattice simulations with\nlarge physical volumes and high statistics. A meticulous scrutiny of the\nso-called symmetric and asymmetric kinematical configurations is performed and\nit is shown that the associated form-factor changes sign at a given range of\nmomenta. The lattice results are compared to the model independent predictions\nof Schwinger-Dyson equations and a very good agreement among the two is found.\n", "  The spin-isospin response of stable and exotic nuclei is investigated in the\nframework of the proton-neutron relativistic quasiparticle time-blocking\napproximation (pn-RQTBA). Based on the Covariant Density Functional Theory,\nthis method extends the proton-neutron Relativistic Quasiparticle Random-Phase\nApproximation (pn-RQRPA) by including the coupling between single\nquasiparticles and collective nuclear vibrations. In the charge-exchange\nchannel, this coupling generates a time-dependent effective interaction between\nproton and neutron quasiparticles. The particle-hole component of this\ninteraction adds to the static pion and rho-meson exchange, while the\nparticle-particle component provides a microscopic and consistent\nproton-neutron pairing interaction. We find that such dynamical effects induce\nfragmentation and spreading of the Gamow-Teller transition strength which are\nimportant for a better agreement with the experimental measurements and for an\naccurate description of $\\beta$-decay rates. The new developments include the\ncoupling of single nucleons to isospin-flip vibrations in doubly-magic nuclei.\nWe find that these phonons can have a non-negligible effect on $\\beta$-decay\nhalf-lives and \"quenching\" of the strength.\n", "  The RNiO$_3$ perovskites are known to order antiferromagnetically below a\nmaterial-dependent N\\'eel temperature $T_\\text{N}$. We report experimental\nevidence indicating the existence of a second magnetically-ordered phase in\nTlNiO$_3$ above $T_\\text{N} = 104$ K, obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance\nand muon spin rotation spectroscopy. The new phase, which persists up to a\ntemperature $T_\\text{N}^* = 202$ K, is suppressed by the application of an\nexternal magnetic field of approximately 1 T. It is not yet known if such a\nphase also exists in other perovskite nickelates.\n", "  In AdS/CFT, the fine grained entropy of a boundary region is dual to the area\nof an extremal surface X in the bulk. It has been proposed that the area of a\ncertain 'causal surface' C - i.e. the 'causal holographic information' (CHI) -\ncorresponds to some coarse-grained entropy in the boundary theory. We construct\ntwo kinds of counterexamples that rule out various possible duals, using (1)\nvacuum rigidity and (2) thermal quenches. This includes the 'one-point entropy'\nproposed by Kelly and Wall, and a large class of related procedures. Also, any\ncoarse-graining that fixes the geometry of the bulk 'causal wedge' bounded by\nC, fails to reproduce CHI. This is in sharp contrast to the holographic\nentanglement entropy, where the area of the extremal surface X measures the\nsame information that is found in the 'entanglement wedge' bounded by X.\n", "  We find spherically symmetric and static black holes in shift-symmetric\nHorndeski and beyond Horndeski theories. They are asymptotically flat and\nsourced by a non trivial static scalar field. The first class of solutions is\nconstructed in such a way that the Noether current associated with shift\nsymmetry vanishes, while the scalar field cannot be trivial. This in certain\ncases leads to hairy black hole solutions (for the quartic Horndeski\nLagrangian), and in others to singular solutions (for a Gauss-Bonnet term).\nAdditionally, we find the general spherically symmetric and static solutions\nfor a pure quartic Lagrangian, the metric of which is Schwarzschild. We show\nthat under two requirements on the theory in question, any vacuum GR solution\nis also solution to the quartic theory. As an example, we show that a Kerr\nblack hole with a non-trivial scalar field is an exact solution to these\ntheories.\n", "  Direct measurements on the temporal envelope of quantum light are a\nchallenging task and not many examples are known since most classical pulse\ncharacterisation methods do not work on the single photon level. Knowledge of\nboth spectrum and timing can however give insights on properties that cannot be\ndetermined by the spectrum alone. While temporal measurements on single photons\non timescales of tens of picoseconds are possible with superconducting photon\ndetectors and picosecond measurements have been performed using streak cameras,\nthere are no commercial single photon sensitive devices with femtosecond\nresolution available. While time-domain sampling using sum-frequency generation\nhas been already exploited for such measurement, inefficient conversion has\nnecessitated long integration times to build the temporal profile. We\ndemonstrate a highly efficient waveguided sum-frequency generation process in\nLithium Niobate to measure the temporal envelope of single photons with\nfemtosecond resolution with short enough acquisition time to provide a\nlive-view of the measurement. We demonstrate the measurement technique and\ncombine it with spectral measurements using a dispersive fiber time-of-flight\nspectrometer to determine upper and lower bounds for the spectral purity of\nheralded single photons. The approach complements the joint spectral intensity\nmeasurements as a measure on the purity can be given without knowledge of the\nspectral phase.\n", "  We study the production and polarization of $J/\\psi$ mesons within a jet in\nproton-proton collisions at the LHC. We define the $J/\\psi$-jet fragmentation\nfunction as a ratio of differential jet cross sections with and without the\nreconstructed $J/\\psi$ in the jet. We demonstrate that this is a very useful\nobservable to help explore the $J/\\psi$ production mechanism, and to\ndifferentiate between different NRQCD global fits based on inclusive $J/\\psi$\ncross sections. Furthermore, we propose to measure the polarization of $J/\\psi$\nmesons inside the jet, which can provide even more stringent constraints for\nthe heavy quarkonium production mechanism.\n", "  We use insights from superstring field theory to prove the subleading soft\ngraviton theorem for tree amplitudes of (compactified) heterotic and type II\nstring theories for arbitrary number of finite energy NS (NSNS) sector external\nstates but only one soft graviton. We also prove the leading soft graviton\ntheorem in these theories for arbitrary number of external soft gravitons. In\nour analysis there is no restriction on the mass and spin of the finite energy\nexternal states. This method can also be used to give a proof of the subleading\nsoft graviton theorem for tree amplitudes in quantum field theories coupled to\ngravity with generic interactions. We discuss the technical issue involved in\nextending this analysis to loop amplitudes of superstring theory including\nRamond sector external states, and its possible resolution.\n", "  We derive the first law of binary point-particle mechanics for generic bound\n(i.e. eccentric) orbits at the fourth post-Newtonian (4PN) order, accounting\nfor the non-locality in time of the dynamics due to the occurence of a\ngravitational-wave tail effect at that order. Using this first law, we show how\nthe periastron advance of the binary system can be related to the averaged\nredshift of one of the two bodies for a slightly non-circular orbit, in the\nlimit where the eccentricity vanishes. Combining this expression with existing\nanalytical self-force results for the averaged redshift, we recover the known\n4PN expression for the circular-orbit periastron advance, to linear order in\nthe mass ratio.\n", "  Cooling oxygen-deficient strontium titanate to liquid-helium temperature\nleads to a decrease in its electrical resistivity by several orders of\nmagnitude. The temperature dependence of resistivity follows a rough T$^{3}$\nbehavior before becoming T$^{2}$ in the low-temperature limit, as expected in a\nFermi liquid. Here, we show that the roughly cubic resistivity above 100K\ncorresponds to a regime where the quasi-particle mean-free-path is shorter than\nthe electron wave-length and the interatomic distance. These criteria define\nthe Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit. Exceeding this limit is the hallmark of strange\nmetallicity, which occurs in strontium titanate well below room temperature, in\ncontrast to other perovskytes. We argue that the T$^{3}$-resistivity cannot be\naccounted for by electron-phonon scattering \\`{a} la Bloch-Gruneisen and\nconsider an alternative scheme based on Landauer transmission between\nindividual dopants hosting large polarons. We find a scaling relationship\nbetween the carrier mobility, the electric permittivity and the frequency of\ntransverse optical soft mode in this temperature range. Providing an account of\nthis observation emerges as a challenge to theory.\n", "  The linear stability of viscous Keplerian flow around a gravitating center is\nstudied using the rheological granular fluid model. The linear rheological\ninstability triggered by the interplay of the shear rheology and Keplerian\ndifferential rotation of incompressible dense granular fluids is found.\nInstability sets in granular fluids, where the viscosity parameter grows faster\nthan the square of the local shear rate (strain rate) at constant pressure.\nFound instability can play a crucial role in the dynamics of dense planetary\nrings and granular flows in protoplanetary disks.\n", "  We propose a general method to embed target states into the middle of the\nenergy spectrum of a many-body Hamiltonian as its energy eigenstates. Employing\nthis method, we construct a translationally-invariant local Hamiltonian with no\nlocal conserved quantities, which does not satisfy the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis. The absence of eigenstate thermalization for target\nstates is analytically proved and numerically demonstrated. In addition,\nnumerical calculations of two concrete models also show that all the energy\neigenstates except for the target states have the property of eigenstate\nthermalization, from which we argue that our models thermalize after a quench\neven though they does not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.\n", "  Discoveries of marked similarities to high-$T_{\\text{c}}$ cuprate\nsuperconductors point to the realization of superconductivity in the doped\n$J_{\\text{eff}} = 1 / 2$ Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$. Contrary to the mother\ncompound of cuprate superconductors, several stacking patterns of in-plane\ncanted antiferromagnetic moments have been reported, which are distinguished by\nthe ferromagnetic components as $-++-$, $++++$, and $-+-+$. In this paper, we\nclarify unconventional features of the superconductivity coexisting with $-++-$\nand $-+-+$ structures. Combining the group theoretical analysis and numerical\ncalculations for an effective $J_{\\text{eff}} = 1 / 2$ model, we show unusual\nsuperconducting gap structures in the $-++-$ state protected by nonsymmorphic\nmagnetic space group symmetry. Furthermore, our calculation shows that the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity is inevitably stabilized in\nthe $-+-+$ state since the odd-parity magnetic $-+-+$ order makes the band\nstructure asymmetric by cooperating with spin-orbit coupling. These unusual\nsuperconducting properties are signatures of magnetic multipole order in\nnonsymmorphic crystal.\n", "  We construct a new relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code optimized in the\nMilne coordinates. We split the conservation equations into an ideal part and a\nviscous part, using the Strang spitting method. In the code a Riemann solver\nbased on the two-shock approximation is utilized for the ideal part and the\nPiecewise Exact Solution (PES) method is applied for the viscous part. We check\nthe validity of our numerical calculations by comparing analytical solutions,\nthe viscous Bjorken's flow and the Israel-Stewart theory in Gubser flow regime.\nUsing the code, we discuss possible development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The exact and phaseless variants of Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo\n(AFQMC) have been shown to be capable of producing accurate ground-state\nenergies for a wide variety of systems including those which exhibit\nsubstantial electron correlation effects. The computational cost of performing\nthese calculations has to date been relatively high, impeding many important\napplications of these approaches. Here we present a correlated sampling\nmethodology for AFQMC which relies on error cancellation to dramatically\naccelerate the calculation of energy differences of relevance to chemical\ntransformations. In particular, we show that our correlated sampling-based\nAFQMC approach is capable of calculating redox properties, deprotonation\nfree-energies, and hydrogen abstraction energies in an efficient manner without\nsacrificing accuracy. We validate the computational protocol by calculating the\nionization potentials and electron affinities of the atoms contained in the G2\nTest Set, and then proceed to utilize a composite method, which treats\nfixed-geometry processes with correlated sampling-based AFQMC and relaxation\nenergies via MP2, to compute the ionization potential, deprotonation\nfree-energy, and the O-H bond disocciation energy of methanol, all to within\nchemical accuracy. We show that the efficiency of correlated sampling relative\nto uncorrelated calculations increases with system and basis set size, and that\ncorrelated sampling greatly reduces the required number of random walkers to\nachieve a target statistical error. This translates to CPU-time speed-up\nfactors of 55, 25, and 24 for the the ionization potential of the K atom, the\ndeprotonation of methanol, and hydrogen abstraction from the O-H bond of\nmethanol, respectively. We conclude with a discussion of further efficiency\nimprovements that may open the door to the accurate description of chemical\nprocesses in complex systems.\n", "  Tapered fibers with diameters ranging from 1-4 micron are widely used to\nexcite the whispering-gallery (WG) modes of microcavities. Typically, the\ntransmission spectrum of a WG cavity coupled to a waveguide around a resonance\nassumes a Lorentzian dip morphology due to resonant absorption of the light\nwithin the cavity. In this paper, we demonstrate that the transmission spectra\nof a WG cavity coupled with an ultrathin fiber (500-700nm) may exhibit both\nLorentzian dips and peaks, depending on the gap between the fiber and the\nmicrocavity. By considering the large scattering loss of off-resonant light\nfrom the fiber within the coupling region, this phenomenon can be attributed to\npartially resonant light bypassing the lossy scattering region via WG modes,\nallowing it to be coupled both to and from the cavity, thence manifesting as\nLorentzian peaks within the transmission spectra, which implies the system\ncould be implemented within a bandpass filter framework.\n", "  Novel topological state of matter is one of the rapidly growing fields in\ncondensed matter physics research in recent times. While these materials are\nfascinating from the aspect of fundamental physics of relativistic particles,\ntheir exotic transport properties are equally compelling due to the potential\ntechnological applications. Extreme magnetoresistance and ultrahigh carrier\nmobility are two such major hallmarks of topological materials and often used\nas primary criteria for identifying new compounds belonging to this class.\nRecently, LaBi has emerged as a new system, which exhibits the above mentioned\nproperties. However, the topological nature of its band structure remains\nunresolved. Here, using the magnetotransport and magnetization measurements, we\nhave probed the bulk and surface states of LaBi. Similar to earlier reports,\nextremely large magnetoresistance and high carrier mobility have been observed\nwith compensated electron and hole density. The Fermi surface properties have\nbeen analyzed from both Shubnikov-de Haas and de Haas-van Alphen oscillation\ntechniques. In the magnetization measurement, a prominent paramagnetic\nsingularity has been observed, which demonstrates the non-trivial nature of the\nsurface states in LaBi. Our study unambiguously confirms that LaBi is a\nthree-dimensional topological insulator with possible linear dispersion in the\ngapped bulk band structure.\n", "  The special limit of the totally asymmetric zero range process of the\nlow-dimensional non-equilibrium statistical mechanics described by the\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian is considered. The calculation of the conditional\nprobabilities of the model are based on the algebraic Bethe ansatz approach. We\ndemonstrate that the conditional probabilities may be considered as the\ngenerating functions of the random multi-dimensional lattice walks bounded by a\nhyperplane. This type of walks we call the walks over the multi-dimensional\nsimplicial lattices. The answers for the conditional probability and for the\nnumber of random walks in the multi-dimensional simplicial lattice are\nexpressed through the symmetric functions.\n", "  We study the effect of trigonal warping on the focussing of electrons by n-p\njunctions in graphene. We find that perfect focussing, which was predicted for\nmassless Dirac fermions, is only preserved for one specific sample orientation.\nIn the general case, trigonal warping leads to the formation of cusp caustics,\nwith a different position of the focus for graphene's two valleys. We develop a\nsemiclassical theory to compute these positions and find very good agreement\nwith tight-binding simulations. Considering the transmission as a function of\npotential strength, we find that trigonal warping splits the single Dirac peak\ninto two distinct peaks, leading to valley polarization. We obtain the\ntransmission curves from tight-binding simulations and find that they are in\nvery good agreement with the results of a billiard model that incorporates\ntrigonal warping. Furthermore, the positions of the transmission maxima and the\nscaling of the peak width are accurately predicted by our semiclassical theory.\nOur semiclassical analysis can easily be carried over to other Dirac materials,\nwhich generally have different Fermi surface distortions.\n", "  Today's standard fabrication processes are just capable of manufacturing slab\nof photonic and phononic crystals, so an efficient method for analysis of these\ncrystals is indispensable. Plane wave expansion (PWE) as a widely used method\nin studying photonic and phononic (phoxonic) crystals in full three dimensions\nis not suitable for slab analysis in its standard form, because of convergence\nand stability issues. Here, we propose a modification to this method which\novercomes these limitations. This improved method can be utilized for\ncalculation of both photonic and phononic modes in phoxonic slabs. While in the\nstandard three-dimensional PWE, Fourier series are used to estimate the field\ndependence across the normal component of the slab, we expand the fields across\nthe third dimension using eigenmodes of a plain unstructured slab. Despite its\napproximate nature, this approach is observed to be both much faster and more\naccurate than the conventional PWE method and can give a very accurate\nestimation of confined propagating modes. As an application example of the\nproposed method we investigate a non-reciprocal photonic device. This device is\na phoxonic slab waveguide which changes modes of optical waves by elastic waves\nand can be used as an optical insulator or mode converter.\n", "  The purely thermal nature of Hawking radiation from evaporating black holes\nleads to the information loss paradox. A possible route to its resolution could\nbe if (enough) correlations are shown to be present in the radiation emitted\nfrom evaporating black holes. A re-analysis of Hawking's derivation including\nthe effects of self-interactions in GR shows that the emitted radiation does\ndeviate from pure thermality, however, no correlations exist between\nsuccessively emitted Hawking quanta. We extend the calculations to\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and investigate if higher curvature corrections\nto the action lead to some new correlations in the Hawking spectra. The\neffective trajectory of a massless shell is determined by solving the\nconstraint equations and the semi-classical tunneling probability is\ncalculated. As in the case of general relativity, the radiation is no longer\nthermal and there is no correlation between successive emissions. The absence\nof any extra correlations in the emitted radiations even in Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity suggests that the resolution of the paradox is beyond the scope of\nsemi-classical gravity.\n", "  Using analytical arguments and computer simulations we show that the\ndependence of the hopping carrier mobility on the electric field\n$\\mu(F)/\\mu(0)$ in a system of random sites is determined by the localization\nlength $a$, and not by the concentration of sites $N$. This result is in\ndrastic contrast to what is usually assumed in the literature for a theoretical\ndescription of experimental data and for device modeling, where $N^{-1/3}$ is\nconsidered as the decisive length scale for $\\mu(F)$. We show that although the\nlimiting value $\\mu(F \\rightarrow 0)$ is determined by the ratio $N^{-1/3}/a$,\nthe dependence $\\mu(F)/\\mu(0)$ is sensitive to the magnitude of $a$, and not to\n$N^{-1/3}$. Furthermore, our numerical and analytical results prove that the\neffective temperature responsible for the combined effect of the electric field\n$F$ and the real temperature $T$ on the hopping transport via spatially random\nsites can contain the electric field only in the combination $eFa$.\n", "  The {\\pi}-{\\pi} interactions between organic molecules are among the most\nimportant parameters for optimizing the transport and optical properties of\norganic transistors, light-emitting diodes, and (bio-) molecular devices.\nDespite substantial theoretical progress, direct experimental measurement of\nthe {\\pi}-{\\pi} electronic coupling energy parameter t has remained an old\nchallenge due to molecular structural variability and the large number of\nparameters that affect the charge transport. Here, we propose a study of\n{\\pi}-{\\pi} interactions from electrochemical and current measurements on a\nlarge array of ferrocene-thiolated gold nanocrystals. We confirm the\ntheoretical prediction that t can be assessed from a statistical analysis of\ncurrent histograms. The extracted value of t ca. 35 meV is in the expected\nrange based on our density functional theory analysis. Furthermore, the t\ndistribution is not necessarily Gaussian and could be used as an ultrasensitive\ntechnique to assess intermolecular distance fluctuation at the subangstr\\\"om\nlevel. The present work establishes a direct bridge between quantum chemistry,\nelectrochemistry, organic electronics, and mesoscopic physics, all of which\nwere used to discuss results and perspectives in a quantitative manner.\n", "  We study a tachyon cosmological model based on the dynamics of a 3-brane in\nthe bulk of the second Randall-Sundrum model extended to more general warp\nfunctions. A well known prototype of such a generalization is the bulk with a\nselfinteracting scalar field. As a consequence of a generalized bulk geometry\nthe cosmology on the observer brane is modified by the scale dependent\nfour-dimensional gravitational constant. In particular we study a power law\nwarp factor which generates an inverse power-law potential $V\\propto\n\\varphi^{-n}$ of the tachyon field $\\varphi$. We find a critical power $n_{\\rm\ncr}$ that divides two subclasses with distinct asymptotic behaviors: a dust\nuniverse for $n>n_{\\rm cr}$ and a quasi de Sitter universe for $0<n<n_{\\rm\ncr}$.\n", "  The optical properties of the two-dimensional (2D) crystals are dominated by\ntightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and lattice vibration modes\n(phonons). The exciton-phonon interaction is fundamentally important to\nunderstand the optical properties of 2D materials and thus help develop\nemerging 2D crystal based optoelectronic devices. Here, we presented the\nexcitonic resonant Raman scattering (RRS) spectra of few-layer WS$_2$ excited\nby 11 lasers lines covered all of A, B and C exciton transition energies at\ndifferent sample temperatures from 4 to 300 K. As a result, we are not only\nable to probe the forbidden phonon modes unobserved in ordinary Raman\nscattering, but also can determine the bright and dark state fine structures of\n1s A exciton. In particular, we also observed the quantum interference between\nlow-energy discrete phonon and exciton continuum under resonant excitation. Our\nworks pave a way to understand the exciton-phonon coupling and many-body\neffects in 2D materials.\n", "  We study how complexity classes above BQP, such as postBQP, ${\\rm\npostBQP}_{\\rm FP}$, and SBQP, change if we \"Merlinize\" them, i.e., if we allow\nan extra input quantum state (or classical bit string) given by Merlin as\nwitness. Main results are the following three: First, the Merlinized version of\npostBQP is equal to PSPACE. Second, if the Merlinized postBQP is restricted in\nsuch a way that the postselection probability is equal to all witness states,\nthen the class is equal to PP. Finally, the Merlinization does not change the\nclass SBQP.\n", "  We present an experimental method allowing to quantify slip at the wall in\nviscous polymer fluids, based on the observation of the evolution under simple\nshear flow of a photobleached pattern within a fluorescent labeled polymer\nmelt. This straightforward method provides access to slip length at top and\nbottom interfaces in the 1 $\\mu$m to 1 mm range and to the actual shear rate\nexperienced by the fluid. Based on simple optical imaging and image analysis\ntechniques, this method affords an improvement compared to previously reported\nmethods in which the photobleached fluorescence intensity profiles before and\nafter shear were compared and measured by scanning a photomultiplier. The\npresent method relies on a direct determination of the displacement profile\ninside the polymer fluid from an analysis of the 3D evolution of the whole\nphotobleached pattern. We demonstrate the potential of this method with\nmeasurements of the slip length for an entangled PDMS melt, as a function of\nthe shear rate, in contact with several weakly surfaces i.e. end-tethered PDMS\nor polystyrene (PS) chains, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of\ntrimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (OTS), and a glassy PS thin-film.\n", "  We elaborate a theoretical description of large Josephson junctions which is\nbased on the Werthamer's microscopic tunneling theory. The model naturally\nincorporates coupling of electromagnetic radiation to the tunnel currents and,\ntherefore, is particularly suitable for description of the self-coupling effect\nin Josephson junction. In our numerical calculations we treat the arising\nintegro-differential equation, which describes temporal evolution of the\nsuperconducting phase difference coupled to the electromagnetic field, by the\nOdintsov-Semenov-Zorin algorithm. This allows us to avoid evaluation of the\ntime integrals at each time step while taking into account all the memory\neffects. To validate the obtained microscopic model of large Josephson junction\nwe focus our attention on the Josephson flux flow oscillator. The proposed\nmicroscopic model of flux flow oscillator does not involve the phenomenological\ndamping parameter, rather, the damping is taken into account naturally in the\ntunnel current amplitudes calculated at a given temperature. The theoretically\ncalculated current-voltage characteristics is compared to our experimental\nresults obtained for a set of fabricated flux flow oscillators of different\nlengths. Our theoretical calculation agrees well with the obtained experimental\nresults, and, to our knowledge, is the first where theoretical description of\nJosephson flux flow oscillator is brought beyond the perturbed sine-Gordon\nequation.\n", "  We shall obtain the interaction of the D$p_1$- and D$p_2$-branes in the\ntoroidal-orbifold spacetime $\\mathit{T}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{1, d-n-5}\n\\times\\mathbb{C}^{2}/\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. The configuration of the branes is:\nnon-intersecting, perpendicular, moving-rotating, wrapped-fractional with\nbackground fields. For this, we calculate the bosonic boundary state\ncorresponding to a dynamical fractional-wrapped D$p$-brane in presence of the\nKalb-Ramond field, a $U(1)$ gauge potential and an open string tachyon field.\nThe long-range behavior of the interaction amplitude will be extracted.\n", "  A nonrelativistic particle released from rest at the edge of a ball of\nuniform charge density or mass density oscillates with simple harmonic motion.\nWe consider the relativistic generalizations of these situations where the\nparticle can attain speeds arbitrarily close to the speed of light;\ngeneralizing the electrostatic and gravitational cases requires special and\ngeneral relativity, respectively. We find exact closed-form relations between\nthe position, proper time, and coordinate time in both cases, and find that\nthey are no longer harmonic, with oscillation periods that depend on the\namplitude. In the highly relativistic limit of both cases, the particle spends\nalmost all of its proper time near the turning points, but almost all of the\ncoordinate time moving through the bulk of the ball. Buchdahl's theorem imposes\nnontrivial constraints on the general-relativistic case, as a ball of given\ndensity can only attain a finite maximum radius before collapsing into a black\nhole. This article is intended to be pedagogical, and should be accessible to\nthose who have taken an undergraduate course in general relativity.\n", "  We present analytical results at four-loop level for the renormalization\nconstants and anomalous dimensions of an extended QCD model with one coupling\nconstant and an arbitrary number of fermion representations. One example of\nsuch a model is the QCD plus gluinos sector of a supersymmetric theory where\nthe gluinos are Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge\ngroup.\n  The renormalization constants of the gauge boson, ghost and fermion fields\nare analytically computed as well as those for the ghost-gluon vertex, the\nfermion-gluon vertex and the fermion mass. All other renormalization constants\ncan be derived from these. Some of these results were already produced in\nFeynman gauge for the computation of the beta-function of this model, which was\nrecently published. Here we present results for an arbitrary gauge parameter.\n", "  Star clusters interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) in various ways,\nmost importantly in the destruction of molecular star-forming clouds, resulting\nin inefficient star formation on galactic scales. On cloud scales, ionizing\nradiation creates \\hii regions, while stellar winds and supernovae drive the\nISM into thin shells. These shells are accelerated by the combined effect of\nwinds, radiation pressure and supernova explosions, and slowed down by gravity.\nSince radiative and mechanical feedback is highly interconnected, they must be\ntaken into account in a self-consistent and combined manner, including the\ncoupling of radiation and matter. We present a new semi-analytic\none-dimensional feedback model for isolated massive clouds ($\\geq\n10^5\\,M_{\\odot}$) to calculate shell dynamics and shell structure\nsimultaneously. It allows us to scan a large range of physical parameters (gas\ndensity, star formation efficiency, metallicity) and to estimate escape\nfractions of ionizing radiation $f_{\\rm{esc,i}}$, the minimum star formation\nefficiency $\\epsilon_{\\rm{min}}$ required to drive an outflow, and recollapse\ntime scales for clouds that are not destroyed by feedback. Our results show\nthat there is no simple answer to the question of what dominates cloud\ndynamics, and that each feedback process significantly influences the\nefficiency of the others. We find that variations in natal cloud density can\nvery easily explain differences between dense-bound and diffuse-open star\nclusters. We also predict, as a consequence of feedback, a $4-6$ Myr age\ndifference for massive clusters with multiple generations.\n", "  We compute the boundary state corresponding to a fractional D$p$-brane with\ntransverse motion and internal background fields: Kalb-Ramond and a $U(1)$\ngauge field. The spacetime has the orbifold structure $\\mathbb{R}^{1,5}\n\\times\\mathbb{C}^{2}/\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. The calculations are in the superstring\ntheory. Using this boundary state we shall obtain the interaction amplitude\nbetween two parallel moving fractional D$p$-branes. We shall extract behavior\nof the interaction amplitude for large distances of the branes.\n", "  We study the growth and saturation of the superradiant instability of a\ncomplex, massive vector (Proca) field as it extracts energy and angular\nmomentum from a spinning black hole, using numerical solutions of the full\nEinstein-Proca equations. We concentrate on a rapidly spinning black hole\n($a=0.99$) and the dominant $m=1$ azimuthal mode of the Proca field, with real\nand imaginary components of the field chosen to yield an axisymmetric\nstress-energy tensor and, hence, spacetime. We find that in excess of $9\\%$ of\nthe black hole's mass can be transferred into the field. In all cases studied,\nthe superradiant instability smoothly saturates when the black hole's horizon\nfrequency decreases to match the frequency of the Proca cloud that\nspontaneously forms around the black hole.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to develop a simplified model as the modeling of\nthe magnetized plasmas. The starting point is an assumption that the\ndistribution of the ensemble of charged particles in the same species is\nhomogeneous over gyrophase. The particles in this ensemble are located at the\nsame guiding-cneter position $(\\mathbf{X},\\mu,U)$. Then, a fundamental\nLagrangian differential 1-form is developed. It contains all particles in the\nmagnetized plasma system as well as the Coulomb pair force between particles\ninstead of field-particle interaction used in conventional gyrokinetic models.\nBy transforming the Lagrangian 1-form to the new one on guiding-center\ncoordinate with the ensemble summation over gyrophase, the new fundamental\n1-form is naturally independent of gyrophase of each particle based on the\nhomogeneous distribution over gyrophase, and it determines the dynamics of all\nparticles on the new coordinates. By using a coarse-grained scheme, this new\n1-form can be modeled by the guiding-center kinetic model.\n", "  Recently the possibility of detecting echoes of ringdown gravitational waves\nfrom binary black hole mergers was shown. The presence of echoes is expected if\nthe black hole is surrounded by a mirror that reflects gravitational waves near\nthe horizon. Here, we present slightly more sophisticated templates motivated\nby a waveform which is obtained by solving the linear perturbation equation\naround a Kerr black hole with a complete reflecting boundary condition in the\nstationary traveling wave approximation. We estimate that the proposed template\ncan bring about $10\\%$ improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio.\n", "  We observe for the first time the process $e^{+}e^{-} \\rightarrow \\eta h_c$\nwith data collected by the BESIII experiment. Significant signals are observed\nat the center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=4.226$ GeV, and the Born cross section\nis measured to be $(9.5^{+2.2}_{-2.0} \\pm 2.7)$ pb. Evidence for $\\eta h_c$ is\nobserved at $\\sqrt{s}=4.358$ GeV with a Born cross section of\n$(10.0^{+3.1}_{-2.7} \\pm 2.6)$ pb, and upper limits on the production cross\nsection at other center-of-mass energies between 4.085 and 4.600 GeV are\ndetermined.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement entropy and the information flow of\ntwo-dimensional moving mirrors. Here we point out that various mirror\ntrajectories can help to mimic different candidate resolutions to the\ninformation loss paradox following the semi-classical quantum field theory: (i)\na suddenly stopping mirror corresponds to the assertion that all information is\nattached to the last burst, (ii) a slowly stopping mirror corresponds to the\nassertion that thermal Hawking radiation carries information, and (iii) a long\npropagating mirror corresponds to the remnant scenario. Based on such analogy,\nwe find that the last burst of a black hole cannot contain enough information,\nwhile slowly emitting radiation can restore unitarity. For all cases, there is\nan apparent inconsistency between the picture based on quantum entanglements\nand that based on the semi-classical quantum field theory. Based on the quantum\nentanglement theory, a stopping mirror will generate a firewall-like violent\nemission which is in conflict with notions based on the semi-classical quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  We report on hybrid memristive devices made of a network of gold\nnanoparticles (10 nm diameter) functionalized by tailored\n3,4(ethylenedioxy)thiophene (TEDOT) molecules, deposited between two planar\nelectrodes with nanometer and micrometer gaps (100 nm to 10 um apart), and\nelectropolymerized in situ to form a monolayer film of conjugated polymer with\nembedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Electrical properties of these films\nexhibit two interesting behaviors: (i) a NDR (negative differential resistance)\nbehavior with a peak/valley ratio up to 17, and (ii) a memory behavior with an\nON/OFF current ratio of about 1E3 to 1E4. A careful study of the switching\ndynamics and programming voltage window is conducted demonstrating a\nnon-volatile memory. The data retention of the ON and OFF states is stable\n(tested up to 24h), well controlled by the voltage and preserved when repeating\nthe switching cycles (800 in this study). We demonstrate reconfigurable Boolean\nfunctions in multiterminal connected NP molecule devices.\n", "  We have developed and experimentally demonstrated an improved electrostatic\ndeflector for the spatial separation of molecules according to their\ndipole-moment-to-mass ratio. The device features a very open structure that\nallows for significantly stronger electric fields as well as for stronger\ndeflection without molecules crashing into the device itself. We have\ndemonstrated its performance using the prototypical OCS molecule and we discuss\nopportunities regarding improved quantum-state-selectivity for complex\nmolecules and the deflection of unpolar molecules.\n", "  We systematically investigate the bistable behavior and squeezing property of\nthe librational mode of a levitated nonspherical nanoparticle trapped by laser\nbeams. By expanding the librational potential to the forth order of the\nlibrational angle $\\theta$, we find that the nonlinear coefficient of this mode\nis dependent only on the size and material of nanoparticle, but independent of\ntrapping potential shape. The bistability and hysteresis are displayed when the\ndriving frequency is red-detuned to the librational mode. In the blue-detuned\nregion, we have studied squeezing of the variance of librational mode in\ndetail, which has potential application for measurement of angle and angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We study different aspects of quantum entanglement and its measures,\nincluding entanglement entropy in the vacuum state of a certain Lifshitz scalar\ntheory. We present simple intuitive arguments based on \"non-local\" effects of\nthis theory that the scaling of entanglement entropy depends on the dynamical\nexponent as a characteristic parameter of the theory. The scaling is such that\nin the massless theory for small entangling regions it leads to area law in the\nLorentzian limit and volume law in the $z\\to\\infty$ limit. We present strong\nnumerical evidences in (1+1) and (2+1)-dimensions in support of this behavior.\nIn (2+1)-dimensions we also study some shape dependent aspects of entanglement.\nWe argue that in the massless limit corner contributions are no more additive\nfor large enough dynamical exponents due to non-local effects of Lifshitz\ntheories. We also comment on possible holographic duals of such theories based\non the sign of tripartite information.\n", "  The Hirota-Miwa equation (also known as the discrete KP equation, or the\noctahedron recurrence) is a bilinear partial difference equation in three\nindependent variables. It is integrable in the sense that it arises as the\ncompatibility condition of a linear system (Lax pair). The Hirota-Miwa equation\nhas infinitely many reductions of plane wave type (including a quadratic\nexponential gauge transformation), defined by a triple of integers or\nhalf-integers, which produce bilinear ordinary difference equations of\nSomos/Gale-Robinson type. Here it is explained how to obtain Lax pairs and\npresymplectic structures for these reductions, in order to demonstrate\nLiouville integrability of some associated maps, certain of which are related\nto reductions of discrete Toda and discrete KdV equations.\n", "  We demonstrate a simple projective measurement based on the quantum eraser\nconcept that can be used to characterize the disturbances of any communication\nchannel. Quantum erasers are commonly implemented as spatially separated path\ninterferometric schemes. Here we exploit the advantages of redefining the\nwhich-path information in terms of spatial modes, replacing physical paths with\nabstract paths of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Remarkably, vector modes\n(natural modes of free-space and fiber) have a non-separable feature of\nspin-orbit coupled states, equivalent to the description of two independently\nmarked paths. We explore the effects of fiber perturbations by probing a\nstep-index optical fiber channel with a vector mode, relevant to high-order\nspatial mode encoding of information for ultra-fast fiber communications.\n", "  We associate Sr atom pairs on sites of a Mott insulator optically and\ncoherently into weakly-bound ground-state molecules, achieving an efficiency\nabove 80\\%. This efficiency is 2.5 times higher than in our previous work [S.\nStellmer, B. Pasquiou, R. Grimm, and F. Schreck, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 115302\n(2012)] and obtained through two improvements. First, the lifetime of the\nmolecules is increased beyond one minute by using an optical lattice wavelength\nthat is further detuned from molecular transitions. Second, we compensate\nundesired dynamic light shifts that occur during the stimulated Raman adiabatic\npassage (STIRAP) used for molecule association. We also characterize and model\nSTIRAP, providing insights into its limitations. Our work shows that\nsignificant molecule association efficiencies can be achieved even for atomic\nspecies or mixtures that lack Feshbach resonances suitable for\nmagnetoassociation.\n", "  We calculate the charge current generated by a temperature bias between the\ntwo ends of a tubular nanowire. We show that in the presence of a transversal\nmagnetic field the current can change sign, i.e., electrons can either flow\nfrom the hot to the cold reservoir, or in the opposite direction, when the\ntemperature bias increases. This behavior occurs when the magnetic field is\nsufficiently strong, such that Landau and snaking states are created, and the\nenergy dispersion is non-monotonic with respect to the longitudinal wave\nvector. The sign reversal can survive in the presence of impurities. We predict\nthis result for core/shell nanowires, for uniform nanowires with surface states\ndue to the Fermi level pinning, and for topological insulator nanowires.\n", "  We discuss a generalized representation of the Dirac delta function in $d$\ndimensions in terms of $q$-exponential functions. We apply this new\nrepresentation to the study of the so-called $q$-Fourier transform, proving its\ninvertibility for any value of $d$. We finally illustrate the effect of the\n$q$-deformation on the Gibbs phenomenon.\n", "  A qubit subjected to pure dephasing due to classical Gaussian noise can be\nturned into a spectrometer of this noise by utilizing its readout under\nproperly chosen dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences to reconstruct the power\nspectral density of the noise. We review the theory behind this DD-based noise\nspectroscopy technique, paying special attention to issues that arise when the\nenvironmental noise is non-Gaussian and/or it has truly quantum properties.\nWhile we focus on the theoretical basis of the method, we connect the discussed\nconcepts with specific experiments and provide an overview of environmental\nnoise models relevant for solid-state based qubits, including quantum-dot based\nspin qubits, superconducting qubits, and NV centers in diamond.\n", "  Models in which dark matter particles communicate with the visible sector\nthrough a pseudoscalar mediator are well-motivated both from a theoretical and\nfrom a phenomenological standpoint. With direct detection bounds being\ntypically subleading in such scenarios, the main constraints stem either from\ncollider searches for dark matter, or from indirect detection experiments.\nHowever, LHC searches for the mediator particles themselves can not only\ncompete with -- or even supersede -- the reach of direct collider dark matter\nprobes, but they can also test scenarios in which traditional monojet searches\nbecome irrelevant, especially when the mediator cannot decay on-shell into dark\nmatter particles or its decay is suppressed. In this work we perform a detailed\nanalysis of a pseudoscalar-mediated dark matter simplified model, taking into\naccount a large set of collider constraints and concentrating on the parameter\nspace regions favoured by cosmological and astrophysical data. We find that\nmediator masses above 100-200~GeV are essentially excluded by LHC searches in\nthe case of large couplings to the top quark, while forthcoming collider and\nastrophysical measurements will further constrain the available parameter\nspace.\n", "  We present a general purpose Monte Carlo program for the calculation of the\nradiative muon decay $\\mu\\to e\\,\\nu \\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ and the radiative decays\n$\\tau\\to e\\, \\nu \\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ and $\\tau\\to\\mu\\,\\nu \\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ at\nnext-to-leading order in the Fermi theory. The full dependence on the lepton\nmasses and polarization of the initial-sate lepton are kept. We study the\nbranching ratios for these processes and show that fully-differential\nnext-to-leading order corrections are important for addressing a tension\nbetween BaBar's recent measurement of the branching ratio $\\mathcal{B}(\\tau\\to\ne\\, \\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma)$ and the Standard Model prediction. In addition, we\nstudy various distributions of the process $\\mu\\to e\\,\\nu \\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ and\nobtain precise predictions for the irreducible background to $\\mu\\to e \\gamma$\nsearches, tailored to the geometry of the MEG detector.\n", "  We present a dispersive analysis of the decay amplitude for\n$\\eta'\\to\\eta\\pi\\pi$ that is based on the fundamental principles of analyticity\nand unitarity. In this framework, final-state interactions are fully taken into\naccount. Our dispersive representation relies only on input for the $\\pi\\pi$\nand $\\pi\\eta$ scattering phase shifts. Isospin symmetry allows us to describe\nboth the charged and neutral decay channel in terms of the same function. The\ndispersion relation contains subtraction constants that cannot be fixed by\nunitarity. We determine these parameters by a fit to Dalitz-plot data from the\nVES and BES-III experiments. We study the prediction of a low-energy theorem\nand compare the dispersive fit to variants of chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  We theoretically propose that, the single crystal formed TaS is a new type of\ntopological semimetal, hosting ring-shaped gapless nodal lines and triply\ndegenerate points (TDPs) in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In the\npresence of SOC, the each TDP splits into four TDPs along the high symmetric\nline in the momentum space, and one of the nodal ring remains closed due to the\nprotection of the mirror reflection symmetry, while another nodal ring is fully\ngapped and transforms into six pairs ofWeyl points (WPs) carrying opposite\nchirality. The electronic structures of the projected surfaces are also\ndiscussed, the unique Fermi arcs are observed and the chirality remains or\nvanishes depending on the projection directions. On the (010) projected\nsurface, one may observe a Lifshitz transition. The new type of topological\nsemimetal TaS is stable and experimentally achievable, and the coexistence of\ntopological nodal lines, WPs and TDPs states in TaS makes it a potential\ncandidate to study the interplay between different types of topological\nfermions.\n", "  We present a framework that describes the energy distribution of subjets of\nradius $r$ within a jet of radius $R$. We consider both an inclusive sample of\nsubjets as well as subjets centered around a predetermined axis, from which the\njet shape can be obtained. For $r \\ll R$ we factorize the physics at angular\nscales $r$ and $R$ to resum the logarithms of $r/R$. For central subjets, we\nconsider both the standard jet axis and the winner-take-all axis, which involve\ndouble and single logarithms of $r/R$, respectively. All relevant one-loop\nmatching coefficients are given, and an inconsistency in some previous results\nfor cone jets is resolved. Our results for the standard jet shape differ from\nprevious calculations at next-to-leading logarithmic order, because we account\nfor the recoil of the standard jet axis due to soft radiation. Numerical\nresults are presented for an inclusive subjet sample for $pp \\to {\\rm jet}+X$\nat next-to-leading order plus leading logarithmic order.\n", "  Spectroscopic properties of odd-mass nuclei are studied within the framework\nof the interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM) with parameters based on the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. The parametrization D1M of the\nGogny energy density functional (EDF) has been used at the mean-field level to\nobtain the deformation energy surfaces for the considered nuclei in terms of\nthe quadrupole deformations ($\\beta,\\gamma$). In addition to the energy\nsurfaces, both single particle energies and occupation probabilities have been\nused as a microscopic input for building the IBFM Hamiltonian. Only three\nstrength parameters for the particle-boson-core coupling are fitted to\nexperimental spectra. The IBFM Hamiltonian is then used to compute the energy\nspectra and electromagnetic transition rates for selected odd-mass Eu and Sm\nnuclei as well as for $^{195}$Pt and $^{195}$Au. A reasonable agreement with\nthe available experimental data is obtained for the considered odd-mass nuclei.\n", "  We present a publicly available, open source version of the time dependent\ngas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. UCLCHEM propagates the abundances of chemical\nspecies through a large network of chemical reactions in a variety of physical\nconditions. The model is described in detail along with its applications. As an\nexample of possible uses, UCLCHEM is used to explore the effect of protostellar\ncollapse on commonly observed molecules and to study the behaviour of molecules\nin C-type shocks. We find the collapse of a simple Bonnor-Ebert sphere\nsuccessfully reproduces most of the behaviour of CO,CS and NH$_3$ from cores\nobserved by \\citet{Tafalla2004} but cannot predict the behaviour of N$_2$H$^+$.\nIn the C-shock application, we find that molecules can be categorized so that\nthey can be useful observational tracers of shocks and their physical\nproperties. Whilst many molecules are enhanced in shocked gas, we identify two\ngroups of molecules in particular. A small number of molecules are enhanced by\nthe sputtering of the ices as the shock propagates and then remain high in\nabundance throughout the shock. A second, larger set are also enhanced by\nsputtering but then are destroyed as the gas temperature rises. Through these\napplications the general applicability of UCLCHEM is demonstrated.\n", "  Recently, a contamination-free dry transfer method for graphene grown by\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been reported that allows to directly\npick-up graphene from the copper growth substrate using a flake of hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN), resulting in ultrahigh charge carrier mobility and low\noverall doping. Here, we report that not only hBN, but also flakes of\nmolybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) can be used to dry transfer graphene. This, on\none hand, allows for the fabrication of complex van-der-Waals heterostructures\nusing CVD graphene combined with different two-dimensional materials and, on\nthe other hand, can be a route towards a scalable dry transfer of CVD graphene.\nThe resulting heterostructures are studied using low temperature transport\nmeasurements revealing a strong charge carrier density dependence of the\ncarrier mobilities (up to values of 12,000 cm$^2$/(Vs)) and the residual charge\ncarrier density fluctuations near the charge neutrality point when changing the\ncarrier density in the MoS$_2$ by applying a top gate voltage.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo (MC) grid-based model for the drying of drops of a\nnanoparticle suspension upon a heterogeneous surface. The model consists of a\ngeneralised lattice-gas in which the interaction parameters in the Hamiltonian\ncan be varied to model different properties of the materials involved. We show\nhow to choose correctly the interactions, to minimise the effects of the\nunderlying grid so that hemispherical droplets form. We also include the\neffects of surface roughness to examine the effects of contact-line pinning on\nthe dynamics. When there is a `lid' above the system, which prevents\nevaporation, equilibrium drops form on the surface, which we use to determine\nthe contact angle and how it varies as the parameters of the model are changed.\nThis enables us to relate the interaction parameters to the materials used in\napplications. The model has also been applied to drying on heterogeneous\nsurfaces, in particular to the case where the suspension is deposited on a\nsurface consisting of a pair of hydrophilic conducting metal surfaces that are\neither side of a band of hydrophobic insulating polymer. This situation occurs\nwhen using inkjet printing to manufacture electrical connections between the\nmetallic parts of the surface. The process is not always without problems,\nsince the liquid can dewet from the hydrophobic part of the surface, breaking\nthe bridge before the drying process is complete. The MC model reproduces the\nobserved dewetting, allowing the parameters to be varied so that the conditions\nfor the best connection can be established. We show that if the hydrophobic\nportion of the surface is located at a step below the height of the\nneighbouring metal, the chance of dewetting of the liquid during the drying\nprocess is significantly reduced.\n", "  The electronic and optical properties of the paradigmatic F4TCNQ-doped\npentacene in the low-doping limit are investigated by a combination of\nstate-of-the-art many-body \\emph{ab initio} methods accounting for\nenvironmental screening effects, and a carefully parametrized model\nHamiltonian. We demonstrate that while the acceptor level lies very deep in the\ngap, the inclusion of electron-hole interactions strongly stabilizes\ndopant-semiconductor charge transfer states and, together with spin statistics\nand structural relaxation effects, rationalize the possibility for\nroom-temperature dopant ionization. Our findings reconcile available\nexperimental data, shedding light on the partial vs. full charge transfer\nscenario discussed in the literature, and question the relevance of the\nstandard classification in shallow or deep impurity levels prevailing for\ninorganic semiconductors.\n", "  This article presents two measurement techniques to determine the diameter of\na single dust particle during plasma operation. Using long-distance microscopy\n(LDM), the particle is imaged from outside the plasma chamber. In combination\nwith phase-resolved resonance measurements the development of the\nvolume-averaged particle mass density is measured over several hours. The\nmeasurements show a significant decrease of mass density for polymethyl\nmethacrylate (PMMA) particles due to a plasma etching process on the surface.\nThis is explained by a core-shell model and is supported by a surface roughness\neffect seen in the LDM images, an out-of-focus imaging of the angular Mie\nscattering pattern and ex-situ laser scattering microscopy measurements.\n", "  We argue that, in the presence of anomalous $U(1)$ symmetries, the invariance\nof Lagrangian including the standard model (SM) under the axionic shift\nsymmetries requires a necessary condition $\\sum_i\\delta^{\\rm GS}_{i}\\leq2N_f$,\nwhere $N_f$ stands for the number of families in the SM and $\\delta^{\\rm GS}_i$\n(Green-Schwarz parameter) characterizes the coupling of the anomalous $U(1)$\ngauge boson to the corresponding axion. In turn, we show that in order for the\nusual $B+L$ violating sphaleron process to be valid a necessary condition\n$\\sum_i\\delta^{\\rm GS}_{i}<2N_f$ is required, where $B(L)$ stands for the\nbaryon(lepton) number.\n", "  We consider a generic scalar-tensor theory involving a shift-symmetric scalar\nfield and minimally coupled matter fields. We prove that the Noether current\nassociated with shift-symmetry vanishes in regular, spherically symmetric and\nstatic spacetimes. We use this fact to prove the absence of scalar hair for\nspherically symmetric and static stars in Horndeski and beyond theories. We\ncarefully detail the validity of this no-hair theorem.\n", "  Three dimensional electron density distributions in the solar corona are\nreconstructed for 100 Carrington Rotations (CR 2054$-$2153) during\n2007/03$-$2014/08 using the spherically symmetric method from polarized\nwhite-light observations with the STEREO/COR1. These three-dimensional electron\ndensity distributions are validated by comparison with similar density models\nderived using other methods such as tomography and a MHD model as well as using\ndata from SOHO/LASCO-C2. Uncertainties in the estimated total mass of the\nglobal corona are analyzed based on differences between the density\ndistributions for COR1-A and -B. Long-term variations of coronal activity in\nterms of the global and hemispheric average electron densities (equivalent to\nthe total coronal mass) reveal a hemispheric asymmetry during the rising phase\nof Solar Cycle 24, with the northern hemisphere leading the southern hemisphere\nby a phase shift of 7$-$9 months. Using 14-CR (~13-month) running averages, the\namplitudes of the variation in average electron density between Cycle 24\nmaximum and Cycle 23/24 minimum (called the modulation factors) are found to be\nin the range of 1.6$-$4.3. These modulation factors are latitudinally\ndependent, being largest in polar regions and smallest in the equatorial\nregion. These modulation factors also show a hemispheric asymmetry, being\nsomewhat larger in the southern hemisphere. The wavelet analysis shows that the\nshort-term quasi-periodic oscillations during the rising and maximum phases of\nCycle 24 have a dominant period of 7$-$8 months. In addition, it is found that\nthe radial distribution of mean electron density for streamers at Cycle 24\nmaximum is only slightly larger (by ~30%) than at cycle minimum.\n", "  Information from preceding trials of cognitive tasks can bias performance in\nthe current trial, a phenomenon referred to as interference. Subjects\nperforming visual working memory tasks exhibit interference in their\ntrial-to-trial response correlations: the recalled target location in the\ncurrent trial is biased in the direction of the target presented on the\nprevious trial. We present modeling work that (a) develops a probabilistic\ninference model of this history-dependent bias, and (b) links our probabilistic\nmodel to computations of a recurrent network wherein short-term facilitation\naccounts for the dynamics of the observed bias. Network connectivity is\nreshaped dynamically during each trial, providing a mechanism for generating\npredictions from prior trial observations. Applying timescale separation\nmethods, we can obtain a low-dimensional description of the trial-to-trial bias\nbased on the history of target locations. The model has response statistics\nwhose mean is centered at the true target location across many trials, typical\nof such visual working memory tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate task protocols\nfor which the plastic model performs better than a model with static\nconnectivity: repetitively presented targets are better retained in working\nmemory than targets drawn from uncorrelated sequences.\n", "  I review important aspects of the relation between center vortices and\ntopological charge, leading to chiral symmetry breaking.\n", "  We develop a theory of viscous dissipation in one-dimensional\nsingle-component quantum liquids at low temperatures. Such liquids are\ncharacterized by a single viscosity coefficient, the bulk viscosity. We show\nthat for a generic interaction between the constituent particles this viscosity\ndiverges in the zero-temperature limit. In the special case of integrable\nmodels, the viscosity is infinite at any temperature, which can be interpreted\nas a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description. Our consideration is applicable\nto all single-component Galilean-invariant one-dimensional quantum liquids,\nregardless of the statistics of the constituent particles and the interaction\nstrength.\n", "  Material mixing induced by a Rayleigh-Taylor instability occurs ubiquitously\nin either nature or engineering when a light fluid pushes against a heavy\nfluid, accompanying with the formation and evolution of chaotic bubbles. Its\ngeneral evolution involves two mechanisms: bubble-merge and bubble-competition.\nThe former obeys a universa1 evolution law and has been well-studied, while the\nlatter depends on many factors and has not been well-recognized. In this paper,\nwe establish a theory for the latter to clarify and quantify the longstanding\nopen question: the dependence of bubbles evolution on the dominant factors of\narbitrary density ratio, broadband initial perturbations and various material\nproperties (e.g., viscosity, miscibility, surface tensor). Evolution of the\nmost important characteristic quantities, i.e., the diameter of dominant bubble\n$D$ and the height of bubble zone $h$, is derived: (i) the $D$ expands\nself-similarly with steady aspect ratio $\\beta \\equiv D/h \\thickapprox (1{\\rm{\n+ }}A)/4$, depending only on dimensionless density ratio $A$, and (ii) the $h$\ngrows quadratically with constant growth coefficient $\\alpha \\equiv h/(Ag{t^2})\n\\thickapprox [2\\phi/{\\ln}(2{\\eta _{\\rm{0}}})]^2$, depending on both\ndimensionless initial perturbation amplitude ${\\eta _{\\rm{0}}}$ and\nmaterial-property-associated linear growth rate ratio\n$\\phi\\equiv\\Gamma_{actual}/\\Gamma_{ideal}\\leqslant1$. The theory successfully\nexplains the continued puzzle about the widely varying $\\alpha\\in (0.02,0.12)$\nin experiments and simulations, conducted at all value of $A \\in (0,1)$ and\nwidely varying value of ${\\eta _{\\rm{0}}} \\in [{10^{ - 7}},{10^{ - 2}}]$ with\ndifferent materials. The good agreement between theory and experiments implies\nthat majority of actual mixing depends on initial perturbations and material\nproperties, to which more attention should be paid in either natural or\nengineering problems.\n", "  Square arrays of sub-micrometer columnar defects in thin\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\\delta}$ (YBCO) films with spacings down to 300 nm have\nbeen fabricated by a He ion beam projection technique. Pronounced peaks in the\ncritical current and corresponding minima in the resistance demonstrate the\ncommensurate arrangement of flux quanta with the artificial pinning landscape,\ndespite the strong intrinsic pinning in epitaxial YBCO films. Whereas these\nvortex matching signatures are exactly at predicted values in field-cooled\nexperiments, they are displaced in zero-field cooled, magnetic-field ramped\nexperiments, conserving the equidistance of the matching peaks and minima.\nThese observations reveal an unconventional critical state in a cuprate\nsuperconductor with an artificial, periodic pinning array. The long-term\nstability of such out-of-equilibrium vortex arrangements paves the way for\nelectronic applications employing fluxons.\n", "  In classical density functional theory (DFT) the part of the Helmholtz free\nenergy functional arising from attractive inter-particle interactions is often\ntreated in a mean-field or van der Waals approximation. On the face of it, this\nis a somewhat crude treatment as the resulting functional generates the simple\nrandom phase approximation (RPA) for the bulk fluid pair direct correlation\nfunction. We explain why using standard mean-field DFT to describe\ninhomogeneous fluid structure and thermodynamics is more accurate than one\nmight expect based on this observation. By considering the pair correlation\nfunction $g(x)$ and structure factor $S(k)$ of a one-dimensional model fluid,\nfor which exact results are available, we show that the mean-field DFT,\nemployed within the test-particle procedure, yields results much superior to\nthose from the RPA closure of the bulk Ornstein-Zernike equation. We argue that\none should not judge the quality of a DFT based solely on the approximation it\ngenerates for the bulk pair direct correlation function.\n", "  Atomistic effective Hamiltonian simulations are used to investigate\nelectrocaloric (EC) effects in the lead-free Ba(Zr$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$)O$_{3}$\n(BZT) relaxor ferroelectric. We find that the EC coefficient varies\nnon-monotonically with the field at any temperature, presenting a maximum that\ncan be traced back to the behavior of BZT's polar nanoregions. We also\nintroduce a simple Landau-based model that reproduces the EC behavior of BZT as\na function of field and temperature, and which is directly applicable to other\ncompounds. Finally, we confirm that, for low temperatures (i.e., in non-ergodic\nconditions), the usual indirect approach to measure the EC response provides an\nestimate that differs quantitatively from a direct evaluation of the\nfield-induced temperature change.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a new kind of spin switch based on a joint system\nof copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and C59N. Using density functional theory, we\ninvestigate the total magnetic moment of this system when gradually changing\nthe interval distance between two molecules. The spin hopping happens during\nthe critical distance with very low energy. This phenomenon shows a possible\nreality of reversible spin switch by external control of the interval distance.\nWith orbital analysis and electron transfer consideration, the form of C59N+-\nCuPc- ion pair support this spin hopping phenomenon.\n", "  We present a stylized model of controlled equilibration of a small system in\na fluctuating environment. We derive the equations governing the optimal\ncontrol steering \\emph{in finite time} the system between two equilibrium\nstates. The corresponding thermodynamic transition is optimal in the sense that\noccurs at minimum entropy if the set of admissible controls is restricted by\ncertain bounds on the time derivatives of the protocols. We apply our equations\nto the engineered equilibration of an optical trap considered in a recent proof\nof principle experiment. We also analyze an elementary model of nucleation\npreviously considered by Landauer to discuss the thermodynamic cost of one bit\nof information erasure. We expect our model to be a useful benchmark for\nexperiment design as it exhibits the same integrability properties of well\nknown models of optimal mass transport by a compressible velocity field.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of the distribution of large scale\ntopographic features on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. We observe that the\ncumulative cliff height distribution across the surface follows a power law\nwith a slope equal to -1.69 +- 0.02. When this distribution is studied\nindependently for each region, we find a good correlation between the slope of\nthe power law and the orbital erosion rate of the surface. For instance, the\nnorthern hemisphere topography is dominated by structures on the 100~m scale\nwhile the southern hemisphere topography, illuminated at perihelion, is\ndominated by 10~m scale terrain features. Our study suggest that the current\nsize of a cliff is controlled not only by material cohesion but by the dominant\nerosional process in each region. This observation can be generalized to other\ncomets, where we argue that primitive nuclei are characterized by the presence\nof large cliffs with a cumulative height power index equal to or above -1.5,\nwhile older, eroded cometary surfaces have a power index equal to or below\n-2.3. In effect, our model shows that a measure of the topography provides a\nquantitative assessment of a comet's erosional history, i.e. its evolutionary\nage.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of transmission losses on the choice of a slack\nbus in high voltage AC transmission networks. We formulate a transmission loss\nminimization problem in terms of slack variables representing the additional\npower injection that each generator provides to compensate the transmission\nlosses. We show analytically that for transmission lines having small,\nhomogeneous resistance over reactance ratios ${r/x\\ll1}$, transmission losses\nare generically minimal in the case of a unique \\textit{slack bus} instead of a\ndistributed slack bus. For the unique slack bus scenario, to lowest order in\n${r/x}$, transmission losses depend linearly on a resistance distance based\nindicator measuring the separation of the slack bus candidate from the rest of\nthe network. We confirm these results numerically for several IEEE and Pegase\ntestcases, and show that our predictions qualitatively hold also in the case of\nlines having inhomogeneous ${r/x}$ ratios, with optimal slack bus choices\nreducing transmission losses by ${10}\\%$ typically.\n", "  Variability of the energy output throughout the day/night poses a major\nhurdle to the widespread adoption of photovoltaic systems. An integrated\nphotovoltaic (PV) and electrochemical (EC)-storage system offers a solution,\nbut the thermodynamic efficiency ({\\eta}_sys) of the integrated system and the\noptimum configuration needed to realize the limit are known only for a few\nsimple cases, derived though complex numerical simulation. In this paper, we\nshow that a simple, conceptually-transparent, analytical formula can precisely\ndescribe the {\\eta}_sys of a 'generalized' PV-EC integrated system. An M-cell\nmodule of N-junction bifacial tandem cells is illuminated under S-suns mounted\nover ground of albedo R. There are K-EC cells in series, each defined by their\nreaction potential, exchange current, and Tafel slope. We derive the optimum\nthermodynamic limit of {\\eta}_sys(N,M,K,R,S) for all possible combinations of a\nPV-EC design. For a setup with optimal-(M,K) and large N, under 1-sun\nillumination and albedo = 0, the ultimate limit for {\\eta}_sys ~ 52%. The\nanalysis will unify the configuration-specific results published by diverse\ngroups worldwide and define the opportunities for further progress towards the\ncorresponding thermodynamic limit.\n", "  Sucralose is a commonly employed artificial sweetener that appears to\ndestabilize protein native structures. This is in direct contrast to the\nbio-preservative nature of its natural counterpart, sucrose, which enhances the\nstability of biomolecules against environmental stress. We have further\nexplored the molecular interactions of sucralose as compared to sucrose to\nilluminate the origin of the differences in their bio-preservative efficacy. We\nshow that the mode of interactions of sucralose and sucrose in bulk solution\ndiffer subtly using hydration dynamics measurement and computational\nsimulation. Sucralose does not appear to disturb the native state of proteins\nfor moderate concentrations (<0.2 M) at room temperature. However, as the\nconcentration increases, or in the thermally stressed state, sucralose appears\nto differ in its interactions with protein leading to the reduction of native\nstate stability. This difference in interaction appears weak. We explored the\ndifference in the preferential exclusion model using time-resolved\nspectroscopic techniques and observed that both molecules appear to be\neffective reducers of bulk hydration dynamics. However, the chlorination of\nsucralose appears to slightly enhance the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which\nreduces the preferential exclusion of sucralose from the protein-water\ninterface. The weak interaction of sucralose with hydrophobic pockets on the\nprotein surface differs from the behavior of sucrose. We experimentally\nfollowed up upon the extent of this weak interaction using isothermal titration\ncalorimetry (ITC) measurements. We propose this as a possible origin for the\ndifference in their bio-preservative properties.\n", "  The phenomenon of drift motion of single-domain ferromagnetic particles\ninduced by the Magnus force in a viscous fluid is studied analytically. We use\na minimal set of equations to describe the translational and rotational motions\nof these particles subjected to a harmonic force and a non-uniformly rotating\nmagnetic field. Assuming that the azimuthal angle of the magnetic field is a\nperiodic triangular function, we analytically solve the rotational equation of\nmotion in the steady state and calculate the drift velocity of particles. We\nstudy in detail the dependence of this velocity on the model parameters,\ndiscuss the applicability of the drift phenomenon for separation of particles\nin suspensions, and verify numerically the analytical predictions.\n", "  We report a 21-W mid-IR OPCPA that generates 131-{\\mu}J and 97 fs\n(sub-9-cycle) pulses at 160 kHz repetition rate and at a centre wavelength of\n3.25 {\\mu}m. Pulse-to-pulse stability of the CEP-stable output is excellent\nwith 0.33% rms over 288 million pulses (30 min) and compression close to a\nsingle optical cycle was achieved through soliton self- compression inside a\ngas-filled mid-IR anti-resonant-guiding photonic crystal fibre. Without any\nadditional compression device, stable generation of 14.5 fs\n(1.35-optical-cycle) pulses was achieved at an average power of 9.6 W. The\nresulting peak power of 3.9 GW in combination with the near-single-cycle\nduration and intrinsic CEP stability, make our OPCPA a key-enabling technology\nfor the next generation of extreme photonics, strong-field attosecond research\nand coherent X-ray science.\n", "  It is highly desired to operate a joint time and frequency transfer over the\nexiting fiber-optic telecom networks with the commercial data transmission.\nPreviously, we proposed a time transfer scheme based on bidirectional time\ndivision multiplexing transmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength\n(BTDM-SFSW), and an optical amplification scheme of single-fiber\nbidirectional-transmission unidirectional optical amplifier (SFBT-UOA). The\neffects of excess noises like Rayleigh backscattering etc. on the received time\nsignals can be efficiently suppressed for an accepted timing jitter.\nSimultaneously, the bidirectional propagation delay symmetry can be guaranteed\nfor an expected uncertainty without requiring complicated and expensive link\ncalibration. In this paper, we propose a high-precision joint BTDM-SFSW based\ntime and unidirectional frequency transfer over conventional telecom networks.\nA stable frequency signal is achieved by compensating the fiber temperature\ndependent phase variation according to the time transfer. The proposed joint\ntransfer scheme is demonstrated over a 320 km fiber-optic telecom testbed with\ntwo 10 Gb/s data transmission channels. The time transfer stabilities (time\ndeviation, TDEV) of 23.2 ps/s and 5.4 ps/10^5 s, respectively, and the\nfrequency transfer stabilities (Allan deviation, ADEV) of 5.4X10^(-13)/s and\n9.5X10^(-17)/10^5 s, respectively, are reached. The measured bit error rates\n(BER) of the 10 Gb/s communication data are well below 10^(-13).\n", "  It has been shown that a hot and dense deconfined nuclear matter state\nproduced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, can be quantitatively\ndescribed by the String Percolation phenomenological model. The model address\nthe phase transition in terms of the two-dimensional continuum percolation\ntheory over strings, which are schematic representations of the fundamental\ninteractions among the partons of the colliding nuclei in the initial state. In\nthis work, we present an extension of the critical string density results\nincluding the eccentricity dependence on the initial state geometry focus on\nsmall string number with different density profile, small deviations from the\ndifferent profile densities are found. The percolation threshold shows\nconsistency with the thermodynamic limit for the uniform density profile with a\nlarge number of strings in the case of circular boundary system. A significant\ndependence on the eccentricity for a small number of strings compared to high\noccupancy systems is exhibited, the implications may become relevant in\nhadron-hadron or hadron-nucleus collision systems.\n", "  A system of Lorentz oscillators is considered to interpret of spectral lines\nof hydrogen atoms. The dielectric permittivity of this system, which takes into\naccount its electric polarization, is considered. The substance is examined in\nthe gas state or in the form of small dust of matter. It is shown that the\nconsidering of the electric polarization results in a redshift of spectral\nlines of the substance and the appearance of dip of curve of spectrum. This dip\ntakes place in the blue side with respect to the spectral position of the\nalready shifted line. The magnitude of the red shift of spectral line and the\nwidth of this dip in the spectrum depend strongly on the concentration of\nhydrogen atoms that create this spectrum and on the spectral position of line\nthat not shifted.\n", "  Penitentes are ablative features observed in snow and ice that, on Earth, are\ncharacterized by regular cm to tens of cm spaced bowl-shaped depressions whose\nedges grade into tall spires up to several meters tall (Nichols et al. 1939,\nLliboutry et al. 1954, Claudin et al. 2015). While penitentes have been\nsuggested as an explanation for anomalous radar data on Europa (Hobley et al.\n2013), hitherto no penitentes have been identified conclusively on other\nplanetary bodies. Regular ridges with spacing of 3000 m to 5000 m and a depth\nof $\\sim500$ m with morphologies that resemble penitentes (Fig. 1) have been\nobserved by the New Horizons spacecraft (Moore et al. 2016, Stern et al. 2015,\nGladstone et al. 2016, Moore et al. 2017) in the Tartarus Dorsa (TD) region of\nPluto (approximately 220-250$^\\circ$ E, 0-20$^\\circ$ N). Here we report\nsimulations, based upon a recent model (Claudinet al. 2015) adapted to\nconditions on Pluto (Gladstone et al. 2016, Toigo et al. 2015), that reproduce\nboth the tri-modal orientation and the spacing of these features by deepening\npenitentes. These penitentes deepen by of order 1 cm per orbital cycle in the\npresent era and grow only during periods of relatively high atmospheric\npressure, suggesting a formation timescale of several tens of millions of\nyears, consistent with cratering ages and the current atmospheric loss rate of\nmethane. This time scale, in turn, implies that the penitentes formed from\ninitial topographic variations of no more than a few 10s of meters, consistent\nwith Pluto's youngest terrains.\n", "  Studying particle motion in the gravitational field of a black hole from the\nperspective of different observers is important for separating the coordinate\nartifacts from the physical phenomena. In this paper, we show that a freely\nfalling test particle exhibits gravitational repulsion by a black hole as seen\nby an asymptotic observer, whereas nothing of the kind happens as recorded by a\nfreely falling observer or by an observer located at a finite distance from the\nevent horizon. This analysis is carried out for a general Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om,\nan extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om, and a Schwarzschild black hole. We are lead\nto conclude that the origin of these bizarre results lies in the fact that the\nquantities measured by the different observers are neither Lorentz scalars nor\ngauge invariant.\n", "  Ferromagnetic materials have been utilised as recording media within data\nstorage devices for many decades. Confinement of the material to a two\ndimensional plane is a significant bottleneck in achieving ultra-high recording\ndensities and this has led to the proposition of three dimensional (3D)\nracetrack memories that utilise domain wall propagation along nanowires.\nHowever, the fabrication of 3D magnetic nanostructures of complex geometry is\nhighly challenging and not easily achievable with standard lithography\ntechniques. Here, by using a combination of two-photon lithography and\nelectrochemical deposition, we show a new approach to construct 3D magnetic\nnanostructures of complex geometry. The magnetic properties are found to be\nintimately related to the 3D geometry of the structure and magnetic imaging\nexperiments provide evidence of domain wall pinning at a 3D nanostructured\njunction.\n", "  The main goal of this study is to characterise the stellar populations in\nvery low metallicity galaxies. We have obtained broad U, B, R, I, J, H, K,\nintermediate Str\\\"omgren y and narrow H{\\alpha} and [OIII] deep images of the\nWolf-Rayet, Blue Compact Dwarf, H II galaxy Tol 02. We have analysed the low\nsurface brightness component, the stellar cluster complexes and the H II\nregions. The stellar populations in the galaxy have been characterised by\ncomparing the observed broad band colours with those of single stellar\npopulation models. The main results are consistent with Tol 02 being formed by\na 1.5 Gyr old disk component at the centre of which a group of 8 massive $>10^4\n\\, M_{\\odot}$ stellar cluster clumps is located. Six of these clumps are 10 Myr\nold and their near infrared colours suggest that their light is dominated by\nRed Supergiant stars, the other two are young Wolf-Rayet cluster candidates of\nages 3 and 5 Myr respectively. 12 H II regions in the star-forming region of\nthe galaxy are also identified. These are immersed in a diffuse H{\\alpha} and\n[OIII] emission that spreads towards the North and South covering the old\nstellar disk. Our spatial-temporal analysis shows that star formation is more\nlikely stochastic and simultaneous within short time scales. The mismatch\nbetween observations and models cannot be attributed alone to a mistreat of the\nRSG phase and still needs to be further investigated.\n", "  Discoveries of extrasolar planets in the habitable zone (HZ) of their parent\nstar lead to questions about the habitability of massive moons orbiting planets\nin the HZ. Around low-mass stars, the HZ is much closer to the star than for\nSun-like stars. For a planet-moon binary in such a HZ, the proximity of the\nstar forces a close orbit for the moon to remain gravitationally bound to the\nplanet. Under these conditions the effects of tidal heating, distortion\ntorques, and stellar perturbations become important considerations for exomoon\nhabitability.\n  Utilizing a model that considers both dynamical and tidal interactions\nsimultaneously, we performed a computational investigation into exomoon\nevolution for systems in the HZ of low-mass stars ($\\lesssim 0.6\\ M_{\\odot}$).\nWe show that dwarf stars with masses $\\lesssim 0.2\\ M_{\\odot}$ cannot host\nhabitable exomoons within the stellar HZ due to extreme tidal heating in the\nmoon. Perturbations from a central star may continue to have deleterious\neffects in the HZ up to $\\approx 0.5\\ M_{\\odot}$, depending on the host\nplanet's mass and its location in the HZ, amongst others. In addition to\nheating concerns, torques due to tidal and spin distortion can lead to the\nrelatively rapid inward spiraling of a moon. Therefore, moons of giant planets\nin HZs around the most abundant type of star are unlikely to have habitable\nsurfaces. In cases with lower intensity tidal heating the stellar perturbations\nmay have a positive influence on exomoon habitability by promoting long-term\nheating and possibly extending the HZ for exomoons.\n", "  We report a new multicanonical Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to obtain the\ndensity of states (DOS) for physical systems with continuous state variables in\nstatistical mechanics. Our algorithm is able to obtain an analytical form for\nthe DOS expressed in a chosen basis set, instead of a numerical array of finite\nresolution as in previous variants of this class of MC methods such as the\nmulticanonical (MUCA) sampling and Wang-Landau (WL) sampling. This is enabled\nby storing the visited states directly in a data set and avoiding the explicit\ncollection of a histogram. This practice also has the advantage of avoiding\nundesirable artificial errors caused by the discretization and binning of\ncontinuous state variables. Our results show that this scheme is capable of\nobtaining converged results with a much reduced number of Monte Carlo steps,\nleading to a significant speedup over existing algorithms.\n", "  A model of dynamic orientation using optimized radiofrequency (RF)\nirradiation produced perpendicular to the holding field is developed for the\nspin-1 system required for tensor-polarized fixed-target experiments. The\nderivation applies to RF produced close to the Larmor frequency of the nucleus\nand requires the electron spin-resonance linewidth to be much smaller than the\nnuclear magnetic resonance frequency. The rate equations are solved numerically\nto study a semi-saturated steady-state resulting from the two sources of\nirradiation: microwave from the DNP process and the additional RF used to\nmanipulate the tensor polarization. The steady-state condition and\ncontinuous-wave NMR lineshape are found that optimize the spin-1 alignment in\nthe polycrystalline materials used as solid polarized targets in charged-beam\nnuclear and particle physics experiments.\n", "  We study UV spectra obtained with the SO82-B slit spectrograph on board\nSKYLAB to estimate the fine structure splitting of the Cl-like 3p4 3d 4D J=5/2\nand 3p4 3d 4D J=7/2 levels of Fe X. The splitting is of interest because the\nZeeman effect mixes these levels, producing a \"magnetically induced transition\"\n(MIT) from 3p4 3d 4D J=7/2 to 3p5 2Po J=3/2 for modest magnetic field strengths\ncharacteristic of the active solar corona. We estimate the splitting using the\nRitz combination formula applied to two lines in the UV region of the spectrum\nclose to 1603.2 Angstrom, which decay from the level 3p4(1D)3d 2G J=7/2 to\nthese two lower levels. The MIT and accompanying spin-forbidden transition lie\nnear 257 Angstrom. By careful inspection of a deep exposure obtained with the\nS082B instrument we derive a splitting of <~ 7 +/- 3 cm-1. The upper limit\narises because of a degeneracy between the effects of non-thermal line\nbroadening and fine-structure splitting for small values of the latter\nparameter. Although the data were recorded on photographic film, we solved for\noptimal values of line width and splitting of 8.3 +/- 0.9 and 3.6 +/- 2.7 cm-1.\n", "  Nonlinear channels play a critical role in realizing dynamical functions.\nNeural ionic channels and non-volatile memristors each derive representative\nbiological and electrical functionalities, such as repetitive firing or pinched\nhysteresis. In electromagnetics, saturable channels of amplification or\nabsorption provide a large nonlinearity for nonequilibrium wave dynamics, from\nconventional lasing to mode locking to recent achievements of the\nnon-reciprocity in complex potentials. Here, we investigate the dynamical phase\ndiagram of parity-time symmetric systems, governed by competing nonlinear\nchannels of saturable amplification and absorption. Determined by the relative\nstrength and saturation level of the channels, three distinctive phases of\nfast- and slow-response equilibriums, and an oscillating nonequilibrium are\ndemonstrated. On phase boundaries, we also reveal the chaotic existence of the\nstrong oscillation state, which allows the non-reciprocal realization of\nrepetitive resonator firing with fully tunable time delays. This work will\npromote the wave-based realization of nonlinear and chaotic temporal functions,\ntoward light-based neural systems.\n", "  Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have attracted increasing research\ninterest as a promising candidate for non-volatile memories. Recently,\nsignificant enhancements of tunneling electroresistance (TER) have been\nrealized through modifications of electrode materials. However, direct control\nof the FTJ performance through modifying the tunneling barrier has not been\nadequately explored. Here, adding a new direction to FTJ research, we\nfabricated FTJs with BaTiO3 single barriers (SB-FTJs) and BaTiO3/SrTiO3\ncomposite barriers (CB-FTJs), and reported a systematic study of FTJ\nperformances by varying the barrier thicknesses and compositions. For the\nSB-FTJs, the TER is limited by pronounced leakage current for ultrathin\nbarriers and extremely small tunneling current for thick barriers. For the\nCB-FTJs, the extra SrTiO3 barrier provides an additional degree of freedom to\nmodulate the barrier potential and tunneling behavior. The resultant high\ntunability can be utilized to overcome the barrier thickness limits and enhance\nthe overall CB-FTJ performances beyond those of SB-FTJ. Our results reveal a\nnew paradigm to manipulate the FTJs through designing multilayer tunneling\nbarriers with hybrid functionalities.\n", "  Intrapixel nonuniformity is known to exist in CCD and CMOS image sensors,\nthough the effects in backside illuminated (BSI) CCDs are too small to be a\nconcern for most astronomical observations. However, projects like the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope require precise knowledge of the detector\ncharacteristics, and intrapixel effects may need more attention. By scanning\nCCD and CMOS cameras with a small light spot (unresolved by the optics), we\nfind in the images that the spot's flux, centroid displacement, and ellipticity\nvary periodically on the pixel scale in most cases. The amplitude of variation\ndepends on not only the detector but also how well the spot is sampled by the\npixels. With a spot radius of 2 pixels (encircling 80% energy) as measured, the\nflux and the ellipticity extracted from the BSI CCD camera vary by 0.2-0.3%\n(rms) and 0.005 (rms), respectively, while the deviation of the centroid\nposition (rms ~ 0.01 pixel) is not correlated with the pixels. The effects are\nmore pronounced for the BSI CMOS camera and even worse for the frontside\nilluminated CMOS camera. The results suggest that a closer examination of the\nintrapixel effects is needed for precision astronomy.\n", "  We consider the amplification in strong electric (magnetic) fields that are\nuniform along the direction of the electron motion and are not uniform in the\ntransverse direction. It is shown that in such a system the gain is increased\ncompared with that of a magnetic undulator by a value of the order of gamma (\ngamma is the relativistic factor). Numerical estimates are presented that\ndetermine the possibility of amplification of a test wave in the optical and\nnear infrared bands.\n", "  We study the shadow cast by the H$D$ Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole,\nand analytically calculate the influence of extra dimensions on the shadow of a\nblack hole. A black hole casts a shadow as an optical appearance because of its\nstrong gravitational field which is known to be a dark zone covered by a circle\nfor a Schwarzschild black hole. We demonstrate that the null geodesic equation\ncan be integrated by Hamilton-Jacobi approach, which enables us to investigate\nthe shadow cast by the H$D$ Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes.\nInterestingly, it turns out that, for fixed values of the mass parameter, the\nshadow in H$D$ spacetimes are smaller when compared with 4$D$ Schwarzschild\nblack hole. Further, the shadows of H$D$ Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes\nare concentric circles with a radius of the circle decreases with increase in\n$D$. We visualize the photon regions and the shadows in various dimensions for\ndifferent values of the parameters, and the energy emission rates are is also\ninvestigated. Our results, in the limit $D=4$, reduced exactly to\n\\emph{vis-$\\grave{a}$-vis} Schwarzschild black hole case.\n", "  In this article, we present the Lie transformation algorithm for autonomous\nBirkhoff systems. Here, we are referring to Hamiltonian systems that obey a\nsymplectic structure of the general form. Two examples of normalization in the\nrestricted three-body problem are given to illustrate the application of the\nalgorithm in perturbation theory. The efficiency of this algorithm for problems\nof asymptotic integration in dynamics is discussed for the case where there is\na need to use non-canonical variables in the phase space.\n", "  This review is based on lectures given at the 45th Saas-Fee Advanced Course\n'From Protoplanetary Disks to Planet Formation' held in March 2015 in Les\nDiablerets, Switzerland. Starting with an overview of the main characterictics\nof the Solar System and extrasolar planets, we describe the planet formation\nprocess in terms of the sequential accretion scenario. First the growth\nprocesses of dust particles to planetesimals and subsequently to terrestrial\nplanets or planetary cores are presented. This is followed by the formation\nprocess of the giant planets either by core accretion or gravitational\ninstability. Finally, the dynamical evolution of the orbital elements as driven\nby disk-planet interaction and the overall evolution of multi-object systems is\npresented.\n", "  An analysis is performed to constrain the $W'$ boson production using the\nmeasurement of the s-channel single top quark production cross section. Both\nphenomenological and statistical approaches are examined and results are\npresented. In the best case, $W'$ bosons that interact only to the right-handed\nfermions are excluded below 1390 GeV. To our knowledge, it is the first time\nthat the measured cross section of the s-channel single top quark production\nfrom the colliders is used to rule out part of the phase space of the $W'$\nboson.\n", "  Sensitivity of entanglement Hamiltonian spectrum to boundary conditions is\nconsidered as a phase detection parameter for delocalized-localized phase\ntransition. By employing one-dimensional models that undergo\ndelocalized-localized phase transition, we study the shift in the entanglement\nenergies and the shift in the entanglement entropy when we change boundary\nconditions from periodic to anti-periodic. Specifically, we show that both\nthese quantities show a change of several orders of magnitude at the transition\npoint in the models considered. Therefore, this shift can be used to indicate\nthe phase transition points in the models. We also show that both these\nquantities can be used to determine \\emph{mobility edges} separating localized\nand delocalized states.\n", "  In a recent letter, J. Cardy, Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{112}, 220401 (2014),\nthe author made a very interesting observation that complete revivals of\nquantum states after quantum quench can happen in a period which is a fraction\nof the system size. This is possible for critical systems that can be described\nby minimal conformal field theories (CFT) with central charge $c<1$. In this\narticle, we show that these complete revivals are impossible in microscopic\nrealizations of those minimal models. We will prove the absence of the\nmentioned complete revivals for the critical transverse field Ising chain\nanalytically, and present numerical results for the critical line of the XY\nchain. In particular, for the considered initial states, we will show that\ncriticality has no significant effect in partial revivals. We also comment on\nthe applicability of quasi-particle picture to determine the period of the\npartial revivals qualitatively. In particular, we detect a regime in the phase\ndiagram of the XY chain which one can not determine the period of the partial\nrevivals using the quasi-particle picture.\n", "  In this work we used a generalized Frenkel-Kontorova model to study the\nmobility of water molecules inside carbon nanotubes with small radius at low\ntemperatures. Our simulations show that the mobility of the confined water\ndecreases monotonically increasing the amplitude of the substrate potential at\nfixed commensurations. On the other hand, the mobility of the water molecules\nshows a non-monotonic behavior when varying the commensuration. This result\nindicates that the mobility of the confined fluid presents different behavior\nregimes depending on the amplitude of the water-nanotube interaction. In order\nto understand qualitatively these results, we study analytically the driven\nFrenkel-Kontorova model at finite temperatures. This analysis allows us to\nobtain the curves of the mobility versus commensurations, at fixed substrate\npotentials. Such curves shows the existence of three regimes of mobility\nbehavior as a function of the commensuration ratio. Additionally, our study\nindicates a nontrivial and strong dependence of the mobility with a quantity\nthat can be interpreted as an effective amplitude of the substrate potential,\ndepending on the bare amplitude of the substrate potential, the commensuration\nratio and temperature.\n", "  Nanodiamonds containing nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers show promise for a\nnumber of emerging applications including targeted in vivo imaging and\ngenerating nuclear spin hyperpolarization for enhanced NMR spectroscopy and\nimaging. Here, we develop a detailed understanding of the magnetic resonance\nbehavior of NV- centers in an ensemble of nanodiamonds with random crystal\norientations. Two-dimensional optically detected magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy reveals the distribution of energy levels, spin populations, and\ntransition probabilities that give rise to a complex spectrum. We identify\novertone transitions that are inherently insensitive to crystal orientation and\ngive well-defined transition frequencies that access the entire nanodiamond\nensemble. These transitions may be harnessed for high-resolution imaging and\ngeneration of nuclear spin hyperpolarization. The data are well described by\nnumerical simulations from the zero- to high-field regimes, including the\nintermediate regime of maximum complexity. We evaluate the prospects of\nnanodiamond ensembles specifically for nuclear hyperpolarization and show that\nfrequency-swept dynamic nuclear polarization may transfer a large amount of the\nNV- center's hyperpolarization to nuclear spins by sweeping over a small region\nof its spectrum.\n", "  Nonintersecting Brownian bridges on the unit circle form a determinantal\nstochastic process exhibiting random matrix statistics for large numbers of\nwalkers. We investigate the effect of adding a drift term to walkers on the\ncircle conditioned to start and end at the same position. For each return time\n$T<\\pi^2$ we show that if the absolute value of the drift is less than a\ncritical value then the expected total winding number is asymptotically zero.\nIn addition, we compute the asymptotic distribution of total winding numbers in\nthe double-scaling regime in which the expected total winding is finite. The\nmethod of proof is Riemann--Hilbert analysis of a certain family of discrete\northogonal polynomials with varying complex exponential weights. This is the\nfirst asymptotic analysis of such a class of polynomials. We determine\nasymptotic formulas and demonstrate the emergence of a second band of zeros by\na mechanism not previously seen for discrete orthogonal polynomials with real\nweights.\n", "  In this article, common experimental techniques and preparation conditions\nadopted for the synthesis of M-type hexaferrites and their influence on the\nmagnetic properties are briefly reviewed. The effects of various strategies of\ncationic substitutions on the properties of the hexaferrites are addressed.\nFurther, our synthesis and findings on Co-Ti substituted hexaferrites are\npresented. It was found that Co-Ti substitution results in improving the\nsaturation magnetization, and reducing the coercivity down to values favorable\nfor high density magnetic recording. Also, evidence of inter-particle\ninteractions in the particulate samples was observed.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the computation of period matrices and the\nAbel-Jacobi map of complex superelliptic curves given by an equation\n$y^m=f(x)$. It relies on rigorous numerical integration of differentials\nbetween Weierstrass points, which is done using Gauss method if the curve is\nhyperelliptic ($m=2$) or the Double-Exponential method. We take linear\ncombination of these integrals to obtain the actual periods on a symplectic\nbasis of loops. The algorithm is implemented and makes it possible to reach\nthousands of digits accuracy even on large genus curves.\n", "  A bilinearisation-reduction approach is described for finding solutions for\nnonlocal integrable systems and is illustrated with nonlocal discrete nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations. In this approach we first bilinearise the coupled\nsystem before reduction and derive its double Casoratian solutions, then we\nimpose reduction on double Casoratians so that they coincide with the nonlocal\nreduction on potentials. Double Caosratian solutions of the classical and\nnonlocal (reverse space, reverse time and reverse space-time) discrete\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations are presented.\n", "  It is shown that the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer expansion does not satisfy\nthe necessary condition for the applicability of perturbation theory. A simple\nexample of an exact solution of a problem that can not be obtained from the\nBorn-Oppenheimer expansion is given. A new version of perturbation theory for\nmolecular systems is proposed.\n", "  Propelled partly by the Materials Genome Initiative, and partly by the\nalgorithmic developments and the resounding successes of data-driven efforts in\nother domains, informatics strategies are beginning to take shape within\nmaterials science. These approaches lead to surrogate machine learning models\nthat enable rapid predictions based purely on past data rather than by direct\nexperimentation or by computations/simulations in which fundamental equations\nare explicitly solved. Data-centric informatics methods are becoming useful to\ndetermine material properties that are hard to measure or compute using\ntraditional methods--due to the cost, time or effort involved--but for which\nreliable data either already exists or can be generated for at least a subset\nof the critical cases. Predictions are typically interpolative, involving\nfingerprinting a material numerically first, and then following a mapping\n(established via a learning algorithm) between the fingerprint and the property\nof interest. Fingerprints may be of many types and scales, as dictated by the\napplication domain and needs. Predictions may also be extrapolative--extending\ninto new materials spaces--provided prediction uncertainties are properly taken\ninto account. This article attempts to provide an overview of some of the\nrecent successful data-driven \"materials informatics\" strategies undertaken in\nthe last decade, and identifies some challenges the community is facing and\nthose that should be overcome in the near future.\n", "  In the random-interaction ensembles, electromagnetic moments of Cd\n$I^{\\pi}=11/2^-$ isomers predominately present linear systematics as changing\nthe neutron number, which has been reported in realistic nuclear system.\nQuadrupole-like and $\\delta$-like $pn$ interaction are responsible for such\nlinear systematics of quadrupole and magnetic moments, respectively.\n", "  Diffusion couple technique is an efficient tool for the estimating the\nchemical diffusion coefficients. Typical experimental uncertainties of the\ncomposition profile measurements complicate a correct determination of the\ninterdiffusion coefficients via the standard Boltzmann-Matano, Sauer-Freise or\nthe den Broeder methods, especially for systems with a strong compositional\ndependence of the interdiffusion coefficient. A new approach for reliable\nfitting of the experimental profiles with an improved behavior at both ends of\nthe diffusion couple is proposed and tested against the experimental data on\nchemical diffusion in the system Fe-Ga\n", "  Details of the London pilot of the `Discovery Project' are presented, where\nuniversity-based astronomers were given the chance to pass on some real and\napplied knowledge of astronomy to a group of selected secondary school pupils.\nIt was aimed at students in Key Stage 3 of their education, allowing them to be\ninvolved in real astronomical research at an early stage of their education,\nthe chance to become the official discoverer of a new variable star, and to be\nlisted in the International Variable Star Index database, all while learning\nand practising research-level skills. Future plans are discussed.\n", "  The study of time-varying (dynamic) networks (graphs) is of fundamental\nimportance for computer network analytics. Several methods have been proposed\nto detect the effect of significant structural changes in a time series of\ngraphs. The main contribution of this work is a detailed analysis of a dynamic\ncommunity graph model. This model is formed by adding new vertices, and\nrandomly attaching them to the existing nodes. It is a dynamic extension of the\nwell-known stochastic blockmodel. The goal of the work is to detect the time at\nwhich the graph dynamics switches from a normal evolution -- where balanced\ncommunities grow at the same rate -- to an abnormal behavior -- where\ncommunities start merging. In order to circumvent the problem of decomposing\neach graph into communities, we use a metric to quantify changes in the graph\ntopology as a function of time. The detection of anomalies becomes one of\ntesting the hypothesis that the graph is undergoing a significant structural\nchange. In addition the the theoretical analysis of the test statistic, we\nperform Monte Carlo simulations of our dynamic graph model to demonstrate that\nour test can detect changes in graph topology.\n", "  Hidden-variable (HV) theories allege that a quantum state describes an\nensemble of systems distinguished by the values of hidden variables. No-go\ntheorems assert that HV theories cannot match the predictions of quantum\ntheory. The present work started with repairing flaws in the literature on\nno-go theorems asserting that HV theories cannot predict the expectation values\nof measurements. That literature gives one an impression that expectation no-go\ntheorems subsume the time-honored no-go theorems asserting that HV theories\ncannot predict the possible values of measurements. But the two approaches\nspeak about different kinds of measurement. This hinders comparing them to each\nother. Only projection measurements are common to both. Here, we sharpen the\nresults of both approaches so that only projection measurements are used. This\nallows us to clarify the similarities and differences between the two\napproaches. Neither one dominates the other.\n", "  Through introducing controlled alternative quantum walks, we present\ncontrolled alternate quantum walks (CAQW) based quantum hash function. CAQW\nbased quantum hash function have excellent security, outstanding statistical\nperformance and splendid expansibility. Furthermore, due to the structure of\nalternative quantum walks, implementing CAQW based quantum hash function\nsignificantly reduces the resources necessary for its feasible experimental\nrealization than implementing other quantum hash functions. Besides, CAQW based\nquantum hash function has expansibility.\n", "  Transport critical current, Ic, is usually defined in terms of a threshold\nelectric field criterion, Ec, with the convention Ec = 1 microVolt/cm, chosen\nsomewhat arbitrarily to provide \"reasonably small\" electric power dissipation\nin practical devices. Thus Ic is not fundamentally determined. However,\nrecently it was shown, that the self-field critical current of thin-film\nsuperconductors is indeed a fundamental property governed only by the London\npenetration depth. Here we reconsider the definition of critical current and\nresolve the apparent contradiction. We measure the field distribution across\nthe width of 2G high-Tc superconducting tapes as the transport current is\nincreased to Ic. We identify a threshold current, Ic_surfB, at which two\nphysical events occur simultaneously: (i) an abrupt crossover from non-linear\nto linear dependence of the local surface magnetic flux density, Bsurf, as a\nfunction of transport current measured at any point on the superconductor\nsurface. This effect was not reported previously. (ii) the appearance of a\nnon-zero electric field, just above of the sensitivity of measuring system. In\nthe present examples Ic_surfB is 10-15% lower than Ic_E determined by the Ec\ncriterion. We propose the transition of Bsurf(I) from non-linear to linear as\nthe most reliable and more fundamental technique for measuring transport\ncritical currents.\n", "  In order to understand the exoplanet, you need to understand its parent star.\nAstrophysical parameters of extrasolar planets are directly and indirectly\ndependent on the properties of their respective host stars. These host stars\nare very frequently the only visible component in the systems. This book\ndescribes our work in the field of characterization of exoplanet host stars\nusing interferometry to determine angular diameters, trigonometric parallax to\ndetermine physical radii, and SED fitting to determine effective temperatures\nand luminosities. The interferometry data are based on our decade-long survey\nusing the CHARA Array. We describe our methods and give an update on the status\nof the field, including a table with the astrophysical properties of all stars\nwith high-precision interferometric diameters out to 150 pc (status Nov 2016).\nIn addition, we elaborate in more detail on a number of particularly\nsignificant or important exoplanet systems, particularly with respect to (1)\ninsights gained from transiting exoplanets, (2) the determination of system\nhabitable zones, and (3) the discrepancy between directly determined and\nmodel-based stellar radii. Finally, we discuss current and future work\nincluding the calibration of semi-empirical methods based on interferometric\ndata.\n", "  We have performed a systematic study of the ground state for even-even 1,002\nnuclei in which 28 octupole-deformed nuclei are found. The interplay between\nthe spatial deformation and the pairing correlation, plays important roles in\nnuclear structure. Our model is based on the Skyrme Hartree-Fock plus BCS model\nrepresented in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space which can\ndescribe any kind of nuclear shape. The quadrupole and octupole deformed nuclei\nappear in the mass region with characteristic neutron and proton numbers which\nare consistent with previous studies. In our results, there appear only pear\nshape ($\\beta_{30}$) in the octupole deformed nuclei. We investigate the\npotential energy surfaces as functions of the octupole deformations\n($\\beta_{3m}, m = 0, 1, 2, 3$), which tells us that. $^{220}$Rn has also local\nminima in the $\\beta_{31}$ and $\\beta_{32}$ potential energy surfaces.\n", "  We study in special limiting cases quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields\nin the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole backgrounds. We determine the lower\nlimit on the mass parameter of the scalar field that allows the waves with\nquasinormal frequencies to propagate to infinity, showing that it depends on\nthe spacetime parameters only. Then we discuss in the large multipole number\nlimit quasinormal modes, whose frequencies can be directly related to the\nunstable circular photon geodesics. In the large scalar mass approximation, we\ndemonstrate the new interesting phenomenon of slowly decaying resonances, that\nare strongly related to the maximum of the effective potential of the massive\nscalar field, which is located at the static radius of the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter spacetimes, where the cosmic repulsion is just balanced by the black\nhole attraction.\n", "  Magnetic properties of quasi one-dimensional vanadium-benzene nanowires\n(VBNW) are investigated theoretically with the absorption of gas molecules-NO\nand NO2. With the increase adsorption of NO on VBNW, the phase transition from\nhalf metal to ferromagnetic metal and last to paramagnetic semiconductor can be\nobserved. With the increase of NO2 on VBNW, half metallic property can be\nenhanced at first and decreased later. Thus, the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of VBNW can be sensitive and selective to NO and NO2, revealing the\npotential applications in spintronic sensors of these two kinds of molecules.\n", "  The 3$d$-electronic spin dynamics and the magnetic order in Fe$_3$PO$_4$O$_3$\nwere investigated by muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\\mu$SR) and $^{57}$Fe\nM\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Zero-field (ZF)-$\\mu$SR and $^{57}$Fe M\\\"ossbauer\nstudies confirm static long range magnetic ordering below $T_{\\mathrm{N}}$\n$\\approx$ 164\\,K. Both transverse-field (TF) and ZF-$\\mu$SR results evidence\n100\\% magnetic volume fraction in the ordered state. The ZF-$\\mu$SR time\nspectra can be best described by a Bessel function, which is consistent with\nthe helical magnetic structure proposed by neutron scattering experiments. The\nM\\\"ossbauer spectra are described in detail by considering the specific angular\ndistribution of the local hyperfine field $B_{\\mathrm{hyp}}$ with respect to\nthe local electric field gradient. The $\\mu$SR spin-lattice relaxation rate\nexhibits two peaks: One at the magnetic ordering temperature related to\ncritical magnetic fluctuations and another peak at 35\\,K signaling the presence\nof a secondary low energy scale in Fe$_3$PO$_4$O$_3$.\n", "  Stellar evolution computations provide the foundation of several methods\napplied to study the evolutionary properties of stars and stellar populations,\nboth Galactic and extragalactic. The accuracy of the results obtained with\nthese techniques is linked to the accuracy of the stellar models, and in this\ncontext the correct treatment of the transport of chemical elements is crucial.\nUnfortunately, in many respects calculations of the evolution of the chemical\nabundance profiles in stars are still affected by sometime sizable\nuncertainties. Here, we review the various mechanisms of element transport\nincluded in the current generation of stellar evolution calculations, how they\nare implemented, the free parameters and uncertainties involved, the impact on\nthe models, and the observational constraints.\n", "  Developing a bottom-up (molecular) theory for the electromechanical response\nof aperiodic materials is a prerequisite for understanding the piezoelectric\nproperties of systems such as nanoparticles, (non-crystalline) polymers, or\nbiomolecule agglomerates. The focus of this publication is to establish a new\nlanguage and formalism for describing molecular piezoelectric responses. More\nspecifically, we define the molecular piezoelectric response tensor d, which\nnecessarily differs from the known bulk definition due to the anisotropy and\ninhomogeneity at the molecular scale, and derive an analytical theory to\ncalculate this tensor. Based on this new theory, we develop a computational\nprocedure for practical calculations of piezoelectric matrices for molecular\nsystems. Our studies demonstrate that the new analytical theory yields results\nthat are consistent with fully numerical computations. This publication is the\nfirst in a series; this work establishes the theoretical molecular foundation\nand follow-up publications will show how to bridge molecular and macroscopic\npiezoelectric responses. It is expected that the present work will aid in\ndeveloping design strategies for piezoelectric materials by revealing\nconnections between molecular structure and piezoelectric response. We expect\nthat the language and formalism developed here may also be useful to describe\nmechanochemical phenomena.\n", "  We computationally study the effect of uniaxial strain in modulating the\nspontaneous emission of photons in silicon nanowires. Our main finding is that\na one to two orders of magnitude change in spontaneous emission time occurs due\nto two distinct mechanisms: (A) Change in wave function symmetry, where within\nthe direct bandgap regime, strain changes the symmetry of wave functions, which\nin turn leads to a large change of optical dipole matrix element. (B) Direct to\nindirect bandgap transition which makes the spontaneous photon emission to be\nof a slow second order process mediated by phonons. This feature uniquely\noccurs in silicon nanowires while in bulk silicon there is no change of optical\nproperties under any reasonable amount of strain. These results promise new\napplications of silicon nanowires as optoelectronic devices including a\nmechanism for lasing. Our results are verifiable using existing experimental\ntechniques of applying strain to nanowires.\n", "  The mechanical, thermal and vibrational properties of defective crystals are\nimportant in many different contexts, from metallurgy and solid-state physics\nto, more recently, soft matter and colloidal physics. Here we study two\ndifferent models of disordered fcc crystal lattices, with randomly-removed\nbonds and with vacancies, respectively, within the framework of non-affine\nlattice dynamics. We find that both systems feature the same scaling of the\nshear modulus with the newly defined inversion-symmetry breaking (ISB)\nparameter, which shows that local inversion-symmetry breaking around defects is\nthe universal root source of the non-affine softening of the shear modulus.\nThis finding allows us to derive analytical relations for the non-affine\n(zero-frequency) shear modulus as a function of vacancy concentration in\nexcellent agreement with numerical simulations. Nevertheless, due to the\ndifferent microstructural disorder, the spatial fluctuations of the local ISB\nparameter are different in the vacancy and bond-depleted case. The vacancy fcc\nexhibits comparatively a more heterogenous microstructural disorder (due to the\nbroader distribution of coordination number $Z$), which is reflected in a\ndifferent scaling relation between boson peak frequency in the DOS and the\naverage $\\bar{Z}$. These differences are less important at low vacancy\nconcentrations, where the numerical DOS of the vacancy fcc can be well\ndescribed theoretically by coherent-potential approximation, presented here for\nthe bond-depleted fcc lattice in 3d.\n", "  We follow the prevailing view that black holes do not destroy but rather\nprocess and release information in the form of Hawking radiation. By making\ncertain conservative assumptions regarding the interior dynamics of the quantum\nsystem we suggest an outside observer could, in principle, recover the initial\nquantum state $\\left|\\psi\\right\\rangle $ before the black hole has evaporated\nhalf of its entropy. In the current framework the retention time is associated\nwith the time scale for a local perturbation to become effectively undetectable\n(scrambling time). Also, we provide a scenario for storing the information\nabout an infalling matter in the near-horizon region in a layered fashion.\nLater we present a generic phenomena which provides a set of boundary\nconditions for breaking the trans-horizon vacuum entanglement between in- and\nout-modes, and thus preserve the effective field theory after Page time\n$\\mathcal{O}(R^{3})$. The scenario follows from black hole perturbation theory.\nWe further argue the proposed Planckian-amplitude horizon oscillations can\naccount for the physical membrane which an observer at future null infinity\n$\\mathcal{L}^{+}$ measures in the complementarity conjecture.\n", "  We review how Quark-Hadron Duality (QHD) for (u,d) flavors at high energies\nand in the scaling regime suggests a radial and angular behaviour of mesonic\nand baryonic resonance masses of the Regge form $M^2_{nJ} = \\mu^2 n + \\beta^2 J\n+ M_0^2 $. The radial mass dependence is asymptotically consistent with a\ncommon two-body dynamics for mesons and baryons in terms of the quark-antiquark\n($q \\bar q)$ and quark-diquark ($qD$) degrees of freedom, respectively. This\nformula is validated phenomenologically within an uncertainty determined by\nhalf the width of the resonances, $\\Delta M_{nJ}^2 \\sim \\Gamma_{nJ} M_{nJ}$.\nWith this error prescription we find from the non-strange PDG hadrons different\nradial slopes $\\mu^2_{\\bar qq}=1.34(4) {\\rm GeV}^2$ and $\\mu^2_{qD}=0.75(3)\n{\\rm GeV}^2$, but similar angular slopes $\\beta_{\\bar q q}^2 \\sim \\beta_{ q\nD}^2 \\sim 1.15 {\\rm GeV}^2$.\n", "  The electronic and structural properties of excitons and trions in monolayer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides are investigated using both a multiband and a\nsingle-band model. In the multiband model we construct the excitonic\nHamiltonian in the product base of the single-particle states at the conduction\nand valence band edges. We decouple the corresponding energy eigenvalue\nequation and solve the resulting differential equation self-consistently, using\nthe finite element method (FEM), to determine the energy eigenvalues and the\nwave functions. As a comparison, we also consider the simple single-band model\nwhich is often used in numerical studies. We solve the energy eigenvalue\nequation using the FEM as well as with the stochastic variational method (SVM)\nin which a variational wave function is expanded in a basis of a large number\nof correlated Gaussians. We find good agreement between the results of both\nmethods, as well as with other theoretical works for excitons, and we also\ncompare with available experimental data. For trions the agreement between both\nmethods is not as good due to our neglect of angular correlations when using\nthe FEM. Finally, when comparing the two models, we see that the presence of\nthe valence bands in the mutiband model leads to differences with the\nsingle-band model when (interband) interactions are strong.\n", "  The rise of atomically thin materials has the potential to enable a paradigm\nshift in modern technologies by introducing multi-functional materials in the\nsemiconductor industry. To date the growth of high quality atomically thin\nsemiconductors (e.g. WS2) is one of the most pressing challenges to unleash the\npotential of these materials and the growth of mono- or bi-layers with high\ncrystal quality is yet to see its full realization. Here, we show that the\nnovel use of molecular precursors in the controlled synthesis of mono- and\nbi-layer WS2 leads to superior material quality compared to the widely used\ntopotactic transformation of WO3-based precursors. Record high room temperature\ncharge carrier mobility up to 52 cm2/Vs and ultra-sharp photoluminescence\nlinewidth of just 36 meV over submillimeter areas demonstrate that the quality\nof this material supersedes also that of naturally occurring materials. By\nexploiting surface diffusion kinetics of W and S species adsorbed onto a\nsubstrate, a deterministic layer thickness control has also been achieved\npromoting the design of scalable synthesis routes.\n", "  A theoretical investigation has been made to study the cylindrical and\nspherical electron-acoustic shock waves (EASWs) in an unmagnetized,\ncollisionless degenerate quantum plasma system containing two distinct groups\nof electrons (one inertial non-relativistic cold electrons and other\ninertialess ultra-relativistic hot electrons) and positively charged static\nions. By employing well known reductive perturbation method the modified\nBurgers (mB) equation has been derived. It is seen that only rarefactive shock\nwaves can propagate in such a quantum plasma system. The effects of degenerate\nplasma pressure and number density of hot and cold electron fluids, nonplanar\ngeometry, and positively charged static ions are responsible to modify the\nfundamental properties of EASWs. It is also observed that the properties of\nplanar mB shocks are quite different from those of nonplanar mB shocks. The\nfindings of the present investigation should be useful in understanding the\nnonlinear phenomena associated with nonplanar EAWs in both space and laboratory\nplasmas.\n", "  Time is a parameter playing a central role in our most fundamental modelling\nof natural laws. Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured\nby different clocks depends on their relative motion and on the strength of the\ngravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the time\nparameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks (i.e., clocks at rest with\nrespect to the expanding space). This proper time is assumed to flow at a\nconstant rate throughout the whole history of the universe. We make the\nalternative hypothesis that the rate at which the cosmological time flows\ndepends on the dynamical state of the universe. In thermodynamics, the arrow of\ntime is strongly related to the second law, which states that the entropy of an\nisolated system will always increase with time or, at best, stay constant.\nHence, we assume that the time measured by fundamental clocks is proportional\nto the entropy of the region of the universe that is causally connected to\nthem. Under that simple assumption, we find it possible to build toy\ncosmological models that present an acceleration of their expansion without any\nneed for dark energy while being spatially closed and finite, avoiding the need\nto deal with infinite values.\n", "  We investigate the contact of a rigid cylindrical punch with an adhesive beam\nmounted on flexible end supports. Adhesion is modeled through an adhesive zone\nmodel. The resulting Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is solved by\na Galerkin projection method in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. Results are\nreported for several combinations of adhesive strengths, beam thickness, and\nsupport flexibilities characterized through torsional and vertical\ntranslational spring stiffnesses. Special attention is paid to the important\nextreme cases of clamped and simply supported beams. The popular\nJohnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model for adhesion is obtained as a limit of the\nadhesive zone model. Finally, we compare our predictions with preliminary\nexperiments and also demonstrate the utility of our approach in modeling\ncomplex structural adhesives.\n", "  In this paper, we endeavour to show that from the noncommutative nature of\nspacetime one can deduce the concept of relativity in the sense that the\nvelocity cannot be infinite as in the case of Galilean relativity.\n", "  Among the most interesting predictions in two-dimensional materials with a\nDirac cone is the existence of the zeroth Landau level (LL), equally filled by\nelectrons and holes with opposite chirality. The gapless edge states with\nhelical spin structure emerge from Zeeman splitting at the LL filling factor\n$\\nu=0$ gapped quantum Hall state. We present observations of a giant nonlocal\nfour-terminal transport in zero-gap HgTe quantum wells at the $\\nu=0$ quantum\nHall state. Our experiment clearly demonstrates the existence of the robust\nhelical edge state in a system with single valley Dirac cone materials.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an interpretation of the Hilbert space method used\nin quantum theory in the context of decision making under uncertainty. For a\nclear comparison we will stay as close as possible to the framework of SEU\nsuggested by Savage. We will use the Ellsberg-paradox to illustrate the\npotential of our approach to deal with well-known paradoxa of decision theory.\n", "  For most passive atomic clocks, the Dick effect is one of the main limits to\nreach its frequency stability limitation due to quantum projection noise. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate that the minimization of the Dick effect for the\nRamsey-CPT atomic clock can be accomplished by interleaving lock. By optimizing\nthe duty circle of laser pulses, averaging time during detection and optical\nintensity of laser beam, the Dick effect induced Allan deviation can be reduced\nto the level of 10^-14.\n", "  John S. Bell is well known for the result now referred to simply as \"Bell's\ntheorem,\" which removed from serious consideration by physics of local\nhidden-variable theories. Under these circumstances, if quantum theory is to\nserve as a truly {\\em fundamental} theory, conceptual precision in its\ninterpretation is not only even more desirable but paramount. John Bell was\naccordingly concerned about what he viewed as conceptual imprecision, from the\nphysical point of view, in the standard approaches to the theory. He saw this\nas most acute in the case of their treatment of {\\em measurement at the level\nof principle}. Bell pointed out that conceptual imprecision is reflected in the\nterminology of the theory, a great deal of which he deemed worthy of banishment\nfrom discussions of principle. For him, it corresponded to a set of what he saw\nas vague and, in some instances, outright destructive concepts. Here, I\nconsider this critique of standard quantum measurement theory and some\nalternative treatments wherein he saw greater conceptual precision, and make\nfurther suggestions as to how to proceed along the lines he advocated.\n", "  Consideration of the entropy production in the creation of the CMB leads to a\nsimple model of the evolution of the universe during this period which suggests\na connection between the small observed acceleration term and the early\ninflation of a closed universe. From this we find an unexpected relationship\nbetween the Omega's of cosmology and calculate the total volume of the\nuniverse.\n", "  The radio-frequency surface resistance of niobium resonators is incredibly\nreduced when nitrogen impurities are dissolved as interstitial in the material,\nconferring ultra-high Q-factors at medium values of accelerating field. This\neffect has been observed in both high and low temperature nitrogen treatments.\nAs a matter of fact, the peculiar anti Q-slope observed in nitrogen doped\ncavities, i.e. the decreasing of the Q-factor with the increasing of the\nradio-frequency field, come from the decreasing of the BCS surface resistance\ncomponent as a function of the field. Such peculiar behavior has been\nconsidered consequence of the interstitial nitrogen present in the niobium\nlattice after the doping treatment. The study here presented show the field\ndependence of the BCS surface resistance of cavities with different resonant\nfrequencies, such as: 650 MHz, 1.3 GHz, 2.6 GHz and 3.9 GHz, and processed with\ndifferent state-of-the-art surface treatments. These findings show for the\nfirst time that the anti Q-slope might be seen at high frequency even for clean\nNiobium cavities, revealing useful suggestion on the physics underneath the\nanti Q-slope effect.\n", "  The observed faint shadow arcs, shifted unidirectionally from primary Fermi\narcs, are caused by lattice distortion from edge dislocations introduced by\ncleaving the samples.\n", "  We propose to use 2D monolayers possessing optical gaps and high exciton\noscillator strength as an element of one-dimensional resonant photonic\ncrystals. We demonstrate that such systems are promising for the creation of\neffective and compact delay units. In the transition-metal-dichalcogenide-based\nstructures where the frequencies of Bragg and exciton resonances are close, a\npropagating short pulse can be slowed down by few picoseconds while the pulse\nintensity decreases only 2 - 5 times. This is realized at the frequency of the\n\"slow\" mode situated within the stopband. The pulse retardation and attenuation\ncan be controlled by detuning the Bragg frequency from the exciton resonance\nfrequency.\n", "  Plants monitor their surrounding environment and control their physiological\nfunctions by producing an electrical response. We recorded electrical signals\nfrom different plants by exposing them to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Ozone (O3)\nand Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) under laboratory conditions. After applying\npre-processing techniques such as filtering and drift removal, we extracted few\nstatistical features from the acquired plant electrical signals. Using these\nfeatures, combined with different classification algorithms, we used a decision\ntree based multi-class classification strategy to identify the three different\nexternal chemical stimuli. We here present our exploration to obtain the\noptimum set of ranked feature and classifier combination that can separate a\nparticular chemical stimulus from the incoming stream of plant electrical\nsignals. The paper also reports an exhaustive comparison of similar feature\nbased classification using the filtered and the raw plant signals, containing\nthe high frequency stochastic part and also the low frequency trends present in\nit, as two different cases for feature extraction. The work, presented in this\npaper opens up new possibilities for using plant electrical signals to monitor\nand detect other environmental stimuli apart from NaCl, O3 and H2SO4 in future.\n", "  In this work, we develop a two-component coarse-grained molecular dynamics\n(CGMD) model for simulating the erythrocyte membrane. This proposed model\npossesses the key feature of combing the lipid bilayer and the erythrocyte\ncytoskeleton, thus showing both the fluidic behavior of the lipid bilayer and\nelastic properties of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. The proposed model\nfacilitates simulations that span large length-scales (~ micrometer) and\ntime-scales (~ ms). By tuning the interaction potential parameters, diffusivity\nand bending rigidity of the membrane model can be controlled. In the study of\nthe membrane under shearing, we find that in low shear strain rate, the\ndeveloped shear stress is mainly due to the spectrin network, while the\nviscosity of the lipid bilayer contributes to the resulting shear stress at\nhigher strain rates. In addition, the effects of the reduction of the spectrin\nnetwork connectivity on the shear modulus of the membrane are investigated.\n", "  Formation of local molecular structures in liquid water is believed to have\nmarked effect on the bulk properties of water, however, resolving such\nstructural motives in an experiment is challenging. This challenge might be\nhandled if the relevant low-frequency structural motion of the liquid is\ndirectly driven with an intense electromagnetic pulse. Here, we resonantly\nexcite diffusive reorientational motions in water with intense terahertz pulses\nand measure the resulting transient optical birefringence. The observed\nresponse is shown to arise from a particular configuration, namely the\nrestricted trans-lational motion of water molecules whose motions are\npredominantly orthogonal to the dipole moment of the excited neighboring water\nmolecules. Accordingly, we estimate the strength of the anharmonic coupling\nbetween the rotational and the restricted translational degrees of freedom of\nwater.\n", "  The Paper actually concerns a toy model, not physical Casimir cavities made\nof conducting plates, but the results are taken implicitly to apply in general.\nWe question on general physical grounds one basic assumption and the results of\na renormalization procedure. Then, for physical systems, i) considering\ncondensed matter theory/experiments, we find strong evidence against the\nconclusive claims concerning a putative and dominating surface energy present\nindividually on the plates, and ii) we propose two experiments with physical\nCasimir cavities to show in detail that the results of the renormalization in\nthis case look somewhat paradoxical. In any case the proposed experiments\nappear to be feasible and thus it could be tested if the putative self-energies\nof the plates are indeed there in a physical Casimir cavity, or if the toy\nmodel of the Paper has by contrast no connection with physical reality. However\nat the moment the authors are not legitimate to issue as conclusive claims\nstatements like- refute the claim sometimes attributed to Feynman that virtual\nphotons do not gravitate -\n", "  The MICROSCOPE space mission aims to test the Equivalence Principle with an\naccuracy of $10^{-15}$. The drag-free micro-satellite will orbit around the\nEarth and embark a differential electrostatic accelerometer including two\ncylindrical test masses submitted to the same gravitational field and made of\ndifferent materials. The experience consists in testing the equality of the\nelectrostatic acceleration applied to the masses to maintain them relatively\nmotionless. The accuracy of the measurements exploited for the test of the\nEquivalence Principle is limited by our a priori knowledge of several physical\nparameters of the instrument. These parameters are partially estimated\non-ground, but with an insufficient accuracy, and an in-orbit calibration is\ntherefore required to correct the measurements. The calibration procedures have\nbeen defined and their analytical performances have been evaluated. In\naddition, a simulator software including the dynamics model of the instrument,\nthe satellite drag-free system and the perturbing environment has been\ndeveloped to numerically validate the analytical results. After an overall\npresentation of the MICROSCOPE mission, this paper will describe the\ncalibration procedures and focus on the simulator. Such an in-flight\ncalibration is mandatory for similar space missions taking advantage of a\ndrag-free system.\n", "  Gravitational microlensing is the only method capable of exploring the entire\npopulation of free-floating planets down to Mars-mass objects, because the\nmicrolensing signal does not depend on the brightness of the lensing object. A\ncharacteristic timescale of microlensing events depends on the mass of the\nlens: the less massive the lens, the shorter the microlensing event. A previous\nanalysis of 474 microlensing events found an excess of very short events (1-2\ndays) - more than known stellar populations would suggest - indicating the\nexistence of a large population of unbound or wide-orbit Jupiter-mass planets\n(reported to be almost twice as common as main-sequence stars). These results,\nhowever, do not match predictions of planet formation theories and are in\nconflict with surveys of young clusters. Here we report the analysis of a six\ntimes larger sample of microlensing events discovered during the years\n2010-2015. Although our survey has very high sensitivity (detection efficiency)\nto short-timescale (1--2 days) microlensing events, we found no excess of\nevents with timescales in this range, with a 95% upper limit on the frequency\nof Jupiter-mass free-floating or wide-orbit planets of 0.25 planet per\nmain-sequence star. We detected a few possible ultrashort-timescale events\n(with timescales of less than 0.5 day), which may indicate the existence of\nEarth- and super-Earth-mass free-floating planets, as predicted by\nplanet-formation theories. [abridged]\n", "  Is it possible to generally construct a dynamical system to simulate a black\nsystem without recovering the equations of motion of the latter? Here we show\nthat this goal can be approached by a learning machine. Trained by a set of\ninput-output responses or a segment of time series of a black system, a\nlearning machine can be served as a copy system to mimic the dynamics of\nvarious black systems. It can not only behave as the black system at the\nparameter set that the training data are made, but also recur the evolution\nhistory of the black system. As a result, the learning machine provides an\neffective way for prediction, and enables one to probe the global dynamics of a\nblack system. These findings have significance for practical systems whose\nequations of motion cannot be approached accurately. Examples of copying the\ndynamics of an artificial neural network, the Lorenz system, and a variable\nstar are given. Our idea paves a possible way towards copy a living brain.\n", "  A mathematical model of the metabolic process of atherosclerosis is\nconstructed.\n", "  We consider the 3D equation $u_{yy} = u_{tx} + u_yu_{xx} - u_xu_{xy}$ and its\n2D reductions: (1) $u_{yy} = (u_y+y)u_{xx}-u_xu_{xy}-2$ (which is equivalent to\nthe Gibbons-Tsarev equation) and (2) $u_{yy} = (u_y+2x)u_{xx} + (y-u_x)u_{xy}\n-u_x$. Using reduction of the known Lax pair for the 3D equation, we describe\nnonlocal symmetries of~(1) and~(2) and show that the Lie algebras of these\nsymmetries are isomorphic to the Witt algebra.\n", "  Carrier recombination dynamics in strip silicon nano-waveguides is analyzed\nthrough time-resolved pump-and-probe experiments, revealing a complex\nrecombination dynamics at densities ranging from ${10^{14}}$ to\n${10^{17}}\\,$cm$^{{-3}}$. Our results show that the carrier lifetime varies as\nrecombination evolves, with faster decay rates at the initial stages (with\nlifetime of ${\\sim 800}\\,$ps), and much slower lifetimes at later stages (up to\n${\\sim 300}\\,$ns). We also observe experimentally the effect of trapping,\nmanifesting as a decay curve highly dependent on the initial carrier density.\nWe further demonstrate that operating at high carrier density can lead to\nfaster recombination rates. Finally, we present a theoretical discussion based\non trap-assisted recombination statistics applied to nano-waveguides. Our\nresults can impact the dynamics of several nonlinear nanophotonic devices in\nwhich free-carriers play a critical role, and open further opportunities to\nenhance the performance of all-optical silicon-based devices based on carrier\nrecombination engineering.\n", "  Magnetic induction was first proposed as a planetary heating mechanism by\nSonett and Colburn in 1968, in recent years this theory has lost favor as a\nplausible source of heating in the early solar system. However, new models of\nproto-planetary disk evolution suggest that magnetic fields play an important\nrole in solar system formation. In particular, the magneto-hydrodynamic\nbehavior of proto-planetary disks is believed to be responsible for the net\noutward flow of angular momentum in the solar system. It is important to\nre-evaluate the plausibility of magnetic induction based on the intense\nmagnetic field environments described by the most recent models of\nproto-planetary disk evolution.\n  In order to re-evaluate electromagnetic induction theory the electrical\nconductivity of meteorites must be determined. To develop a technique capable\nof making these measurements, a time-varying magnetic field was generated to\ninductively heat metallic control samples. The thermal response of each sample,\nwhich depends on electrical conductivity, was monitored until a thermal steady\nstate was achieved. The relationship between conductivity and thermal response\ncan be exploited to estimate the electrical conductivity of unknown samples.\nAfter applying the technique to various metals it was recognized that this\nmethod is not capable of making precise electrical conductivity measurements.\nHowever, this method can constrain the product of the electrical conductivity\nand the square of the magnetic permeability, or ${\\sigma}{{\\mu}^2}$, for\nmeteoritic and metallic samples alike. The results also illustrate that along\nwith electrical conductivity {\\sigma}, the magnetic permeability {\\mu} of a\nsubstance has an important effect on induction heating phenomena for\nparamagnetic ({\\mu}/{\\mu}0 > 1) and especially ferromagnetic materials\n({\\mu}/{\\mu}0 >> 1).\n", "  In this talk, I will summarize the present state of a long-term effort to\nobtain information on the high-order asymptotic behaviour of the QED\nperturbation series through the effective action. Starting with the\nconstant-field case, I will discuss the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in various\ndimensions, and up to the three-loop level. This Lagrangian holds the\ninformation on the N-photon amplitudes in the low-energy limit, and combining\nit with spinor helicity methods explicit all-N results can be obtained at the\none-loop and, for the \"all + \" amplitudes, also at the two-loop level. For the\nimaginary part of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, an all-loop formula has been\nconjectured independently by Affleck, Alvarez and Manton for Scalar QED, and by\nLebedev and Ritus for Spinor QED. This formula can be related through a Borel\ndispersion relation to the leading large-N behaviour of the N-photon\namplitudes. It is analytic in the fine structure constant, which is puzzling\nand suggests a diagrammatic investigation of the large-N limit in perturbation\ntheory. Preliminary results of such a study for the 1+1 dimensional case throw\ndoubt on the validity of the conjecture.\n", "  A critical review on excited states of negative ions has been given recently\nby Buckman and Clark (1994), in a major update of the review by Schulz (1973).\nHowever, for completeness we include a summary of some known (mainly low lying)\nexcited states. We include a brief discussion and indicate some problematic\npoints with additional references. The observation of resonances in gas phase\natomic collisions is discussed in this context. Finally we mention some very\nnice new results concerning the observation of these resonant states in\nparticle surface interactions and briefly discuss the role that they can play.\nA table of electron affinities of atomic negative ions is provided at the end.\n"]}
