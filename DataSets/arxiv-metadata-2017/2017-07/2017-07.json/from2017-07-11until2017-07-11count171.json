In this way, light presents the\ndistinguishing features of matter in a \"supersolid\" phase. We show that this\nsupersolid phase provides the stability conditions for nonlinear Bloch waves\nand, at the same time, permits the existence of topological solitons or defects\nfor the envelope of these waves. We use a condensed matter analysis instead of\na standard nonlinear optics approach and provide numerical evidence of these\ntheoretical findings.\n", "  We derive an explicit formula for the vertex amplitude of dual SU(2)\nYang-Mills theory in four dimensions on the lattice, and provide an efficient\nalgorithm (of order j to the fourth power) for its computation. This opens the\nway for both numerical and analytic development of dual methods, previously\nlimited to the case of three dimensions.\n", "  (Original) Recent high-resolution spectra of the Type Ia SN 2006X have\nrevealed the presence of time-variable and blueshifted Na I D features,\ninterpreted by Patat et al. as originating in circumstellar material within the\nprogenitor system. The variation seen in SN 2006X induces relatively large\nchanges in the total Na I D equivalent width ($\\Delta\\rm{EW}\\approx 0.5\n\\unicode{x212B}$ in just over two weeks), that would be detectable at lower\nresolutions. We have used a large data set comprising 2400 low-resolution\nspectra of 450 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the CfA Supernova\nProgram to search for variable Na I D features. Out of the 31 SNe Ia (including\nSN 2006X) in which we could have detected similar EW variations, only one other\n(SN 1999cl) shows variable Na I D features, with an even larger change over a\nsimilar ~10-day timescale ($\\Delta\\rm{EW} = 1.66 \\pm 0.21 \\unicode{x212B}$).\nInterestingly, both SN 1999cl and SN 2006X are the two most highly-reddened\nobjects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability is\nconnected to dusty environments.\n  (Erratum) The large variation in the Na I D equivalent width observed in SN\n1999cl results in fact from a measurement error. Our new measurements show that\nthe EW variation is significantly lower, at $0.43 \\pm 0.14 \\unicode{x212B}$.\nWhile the EW variation remains statistically significant (3.1$\\sigma$ different\nfrom zero), it is now below the detection threshold of 0.5 $\\unicode{x212B}$\nderived from the Monte Carlo simulations published in the original paper. As a\nresult, SN 1999cl should no longer be considered as an object displaying\nvariable Na I D lines in our study. The fraction of SNe Ia in our sample\ndisplaying Na I D lines thus goes from $\\sim$6% (2/31) in the original study to\n$\\sim$3% (1/31) in the revised analysis, SN 2006X being the only SN Ia in our\nsample with variable Na I D lines.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitudes\n(LCDAs) of the S-wave and P-wave quarkonia (namely $^1S_0$ state $\\eta_{Q}$,\n$^3S_1$ state $J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)$, $^1P_1$ state $h_{Q}$ and $^3P_J$ states\n$\\chi_{QJ}$ with $J=0,1,2$ and $Q=c,b$) to the next-leading order of the strong\ncoupling $\\alpha_s$ and leading order of the velocity expansion $v$ in the\nnon-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). We apply these LCDAs to some single quarkonium\nexclusive productions at large center-of-mass energy, such as $\\gamma^*\\to\n\\eta_Q\\gamma, \\chi_{QJ}\\gamma~(J=0,1,2)$, $Z\\to \\eta_Q\\gamma,\n\\chi_{QJ}\\gamma~(J=0,1,2), J/\\psi (\\Upsilon)\\gamma, h_Q\\gamma$ and $h\\to J/\\psi\n\\gamma$, by adopting the collinear factorization. The asymptotic behaviors of\nthose processes obtained in NRQCD factorization are reproduced.\n", "  We define an EPR-like uncertainty by using the Duan et al.'s inequality which\ngives a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of any two-mode\nGaussian state. We show that for a given amount of entanglement, the\nuncertainty is minimized by pure two-mode squeezed states. Using this fact, we\nwrite the optimal pure-state decomposition and derive a compact form for the\nentanglement of formation of two-mode Gaussian states. For illustration\npurposes, we consider symmetric and squeezed thermal states as special cases\nand evaluate their entanglement of formation explicitly. For the symmetric\nstates, our result is in agreement with the Giedke et al.'s one. To our\nknowledge, our work is the first one which gives the exact entanglement of\nformation of two-mode squeezed thermal states explicitly.\n", "  We prove that the Nazarov-Sodin constant, which up to a natural scaling gives\nthe leading order growth for the expected number of nodal components of a\nrandom Gaussian field, genuinely depends on the field. We then infer the same\nfor \"arithmetic random waves\", i.e. random toral Laplace eigenfunctions.\n", "  The spread of tick-borne pathogens represents an important threat to human\nand animal health in many parts of Eurasia. Here, we analysed a 9-year time\nseries of Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on Apodemus flavicollis mice (main\nreservoir-competent host for tick-borne encephalitis, TBE) sampled in Trentino\n(Northern Italy). The tail of the distribution of the number of ticks per host\nwas fitted by three theoretical distributions: Negative Binomial (NB),\nPoisson-LogNormal (PoiLN), and Power-Law (PL). The fit with theoretical\ndistributions indicated that the tail of the tick infestation pattern on mice\nis better described by the PL distribution. Moreover, we found that the tail of\nthe distribution significantly changes with seasonal variations in host\nabundance. In order to investigate the effect of different tails of tick\ndistribution on the invasion of a non-systemically transmitted pathogen, we\nsimulated the transmission of a TBE-like virus between susceptible and\ninfective ticks using a stochastic model. Model simulations indicated different\noutcomes of disease spreading when considering different distribution laws of\nticks among hosts. Specifically, we found that the epidemic threshold and the\nprevalence equilibria obtained in epidemiological simulations with PL\ndistribution are a good approximation of those observed in simulations feed by\nthe empirical distribution. Moreover, we also found that the epidemic threshold\nfor disease invasion was lower when considering the seasonal variation of tick\naggregation.\n", "  The time evolution of the equation of state $w$ for quintessence models with\na scalar field as dark energy is studied up to the third derivative\n($d^3w/da^3$) with respect to the scale factor $a$, in order to predict the\nfuture observations and specify the scalar potential parameters with the\nobservables. The third derivative of $w$ for general potential $V$ is derived\nand applied to several types of potentials. They are the inverse power-law\n($V=M^{4+\\alpha}/Q^{\\alpha}$), the exponential ($V=M^4\\exp{(\\beta M/Q)}$), the\nmixed ( $V=M^{4+\\gamma}\\exp{(\\beta M/Q)}/Q^{\\gamma}$), the cosine ($V=M^4(\\cos\n(Q/f)+1)$) and the Gaussian types ($V=M^4\\exp(-Q^2/\\sigma^2)$), which are\nprototypical potentials for the freezing and thawing models.\n  If the parameter number for a potential form is $ n$, it is necessary to find\nat least for $n+2$ independent observations to identify the potential form and\nthe evolution of the scalar field ($Q$ and $ \\dot{Q} $).\n  Such observations would be the values of $ \\Omega_Q, w, dw/da. \\cdots $, and\n$ dw^n/da^n$.\n  From these specific potentials, we can predict the $ n+1 $ and higher\nderivative of $w$ ; $ dw^{n+1}/da^{n+1}, \\cdots$.\n  Since four of the above mentioned potentials have two parameters, it is\nnecessary to calculate the third derivative of $w$ for them to estimate the\npredict values.\n  If they are tested observationally, it will be understood whether the dark\nenergy could be described by the scalar field with this potential.\n  At least it will satisfy the necessary conditions.\n  Numerical analysis for $d^3w/da^3$ are made under some specified parameters\nin the investigated potentials, except the mixed one.\n  It becomes possible to distinguish the potentials by the accurate observing\n$dw/da$ and $d^2w/da^2$ in some parameters.\n", "  Consider the Dirichlet Laplacian operator $-\\Delta^D$ in a periodic waveguide\n$\\Omega$. On the condition that $\\Omega$ is sufficiently thin, we show that its\nspectrum $\\sigma(-\\Delta^D)$ is absolutely continuous (in each finite region).\nIn addition, we ensure the existence of at least one gap in $\\sigma(-\\Delta^D)$\nand locate it.\n", "  This work presents the results of a multi mode ITER study on Toroidal Alfven\nEigenmodes, using the nonlinear hybrid HAGIS-LIGKA model. It is found that main\nconclusions from earlier studies of ASDEX Upgrade discharges can be transferred\nto the ITER scenario: global, nonlinear effects are crucial for the evolution\nof the multi mode scenario. This work focuses on the ITER 15 MA baseline\nscenario with with a safety factor at the magnetic axis of $q_0 =$ 0.986. The\nleast damped eigenmodes of the system are identified with the gyrokinetic,\nnon-perturbative LIGKA solver, concerning mode structure, frequency and\ndamping. Taking into account all weakly damped modes that can be identified\nlinearly, nonlinear simulations with HAGIS reveal strong multi mode behavior:\nwhile in some parameter range, quasi-linear estimates turn out to be reasonable\napproximations for the nonlinearly relaxed energetic particle profile, under\ncertain conditions low-n TAE branches can be excited. As a consequence, not\nonly grow amplitudes of all modes to (up to orders of magnitude) higher values\ncompared to the single mode cases but also, strong redistribution is triggered\nin the outer radial area between $\\rho_\\mathrm{pol} =$ 0.6 and 0.85, far above\nquasi-linear estimates.\n", "  Prethermalization refers to the transient phenomenon where a system\nthermalizes according to a Hamiltonian that is not the generator of its\nevolution. We provide here a rigorous framework for quantum spin systems where\nprethermalization is exhibited for very long times. First, we consider quantum\nspin systems under periodic driving at high frequency $\\nu$. We prove that up\nto a quasi-exponential time $\\tau_* \\sim e^{c \\frac{\\nu}{\\log^3 \\nu}}$, the\nsystem barely absorbs energy. Instead, there is an effective local Hamiltonian\n$\\hat D$ that governs the time evolution up to $\\tau_*$, and hence this\neffective Hamiltonian is a conserved quantity up to $\\tau_*$. Next, we consider\nsystems without driving, but with a separation of energy scales in the\nHamiltonian. A prime example is the Fermi-Hubbard model where the interaction\n$U$ is much larger than the hopping $J$. Also here we prove the emergence of an\neffective conserved quantity, different from the Hamiltonian, up to a time\n$\\tau_*$ that is (almost) exponential in $U/J$.\n", "  We address the nature of spin-orbit torques at the magnetic surfaces of\ntopological insulators, using both Kubo formula and Keldysh formalism. Through\nthe analysis of the derived spin-charge equations, we find that the so-called\nDirac torques possess a different symmetry compared to their Rashba\ncounterpart, as well as a high anisotropy as a function of the magnetization\ndirection. In particular, the damping torque vanishes when the magnetization\nlies in the plane of the topological insulator surface. This peculiarity has\nimportant consequences in terms of magnetization dynamics and switching, as\ndemonstrated numerically via a macrospin model.\n", "  In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors.\n", "  General Relativity extended through a dynamical scalar quartet is proposed as\na theory of the scalar-vector-tensor gravity, generically describing the\nunified gravitational dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). The implementation\nin the weak-field limit of the Higgs mechanism for the gravity, with a\nredefinition of metric field, is exposed in a generally covariant form. Under a\nnatural restriction on parameters, the redefined theory possesses in the\nlinearized approximation by a residual transverse-diffeomorphism invariance,\nand consistently comprises the massless tensor graviton and a massive scalar\none as a DM particle. A number of the adjustable parameters in the full\nnonlinear theory and a partial decoupling of the latter from its weak-field\nlimit noticeably extend the perspectives for the unified description of the\ngravity DM and DE in the various phenomena at the different scales.\n", "  We use the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) as an efficient tool to\nfully characterize the Abelian phase of a $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$\nspin liquid emerging as the ground state of topological color code (TCC), which\nis a class of stabilizer states on the honeycomb lattice. We provide the fusion\nrules of the quasiparticle (QP) excitations of the model by introducing single-\nor two-body operators on physical spins for each fusion process which justify\nthe corresponding fusion outcome. Beside, we extract the TEE from Renyi\nentanglement entropy (EE) of the TCC, analytically and numerically by finite\nsize exact diagonalization on the disk shape regions with contractible\nboundaries. We obtain that the EE has a local contribution, which scales\nlinearly with the boundary length in addition to a topological term, i.e. the\nTEE, arising from the condensation of closed strings in the ground state. We\nfurther investigate the ground state dependence of the TEE on regions with\nnon-contractible boundaries, i.e. by cutting the torus to half cylinders, from\nwhich we further identify multiple independent minimum entropy states (MES) of\nthe TCC and then extract the U and S modular matrices of the system, which\ncontain the self and mutual statistics of the anyonic QPs and fully\ncharacterize the topological phase of the TCC. Eventually, we show that, in\nspite of the lack of a local order parameter, TEE and other physical quantities\nobtained from ground state wave function such as entanglement spectrum (ES) and\nground state fidelity are sensitive probes to study the robustness of a\ntopological phase. We find that the topological order in the presence of a\nmagnetic field persists until the vicinity of the transition point, where the\nTEE and fidelity drops to zero and the ES splits severely, signaling breakdown\nof the topological phase of the TCC.\n", "  Large dust grains can fluctuate dramatically in their local density, relative\nto gas, in neutral, turbulent disks. Small, high-redshift galaxies (before\nreionization) represent ideal environments for this process. We show via simple\narguments and simulations that order-of-magnitude fluctuations are expected in\nlocal abundances of large grains under these conditions. This can have\nimportant consequences for star formation and stellar abundances in extremely\nmetal-poor stars. Low-mass stars could form in dust-enhanced regions almost\nimmediately after some dust forms, even if the galaxy-average metallicity is\ntoo low for fragmentation to occur. The abundances of these 'promoted' stars\nmay contain interesting signatures, as the CNO abundances (concentrated in\nlarge carbonaceous grains and ices) and Mg and Si (in large silicate grains)\ncan be enhanced or fluctuate independently. Remarkably, otherwise puzzling\nabundance patterns of some metal-poor stars can be well-fit by standard\ncore-collapse SNe yields, if we allow for fluctuating dust-to-gas ratios. We\nalso show that the observed log-normal-like distribution of enhancements in\nthese species agrees with our simulations. Moreover, we confirm Mg and Si are\ncorrelated in these stars, with abundance ratios similar to those in local\nsilicate grains. Meanwhile [Mg/Ca], predicted to be nearly invariant from pure\nSNe yields, shows large enhancements as expected in the dust-promoted model,\npreferentially in the [C/Fe]-enhanced metal-poor stars. This suggests that (1)\ndust exists in second-generation star formation, (2) dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations occur and can be important for star formation, and (3) light\nelement abundances of these stars may be affected by the chemistry of dust\nwhere they formed, rather than directly tracing nucleosynthesis.\n", "  We report on a single photon source with highly tunable photon shape based on\na cold ensemble of Rubidium atoms. We follow the DLCZ scheme to implement an\nemissive quantum memory, which can be operated as a photon pair source with\ncontrollable delay. We find that the temporal wave shape of the emitted read\nphoton can be precisely controlled by changing the shape of the driving read\npulse. We generate photons with temporal durations varying over three orders of\nmagnitude up to 10 {\\mu}s without a significant change of the read-out\nefficiency. We prove the non-classicality of the emitted photons by measuring\ntheir antibunching, showing near single photon behavior at low excitation\nprobabilities. We also show that the photons are emitted in a pure state by\nmeasuring unconditional autocorrelation functions. Finally, to demonstrate the\nusability of the source for realistic applications, we create ultra-long single\nphotons with a rising exponential or doubly peaked wave shape which are\nimportant for several quantum information tasks.\n", "  We derive the universal R-matrix of the quantum-deformed enveloping algebra\nof centrally extended sl(2|2) using Drinfeld's quantum double construction. We\nare led to enlarging the algebra by additional generators corresponding to an\nsl(2) automorphism. For this maximally extended algebra we construct a\nconsistent Hopf algebra structure where the extensions exhibit several uncommon\nfeatures. We determine the corresponding universal R-matrix containing some\nnon-standard functions. Curiously, this Hopf algebra has one extra deformation\nparameter for which the R-matrix does not factorize into products of\nexponentials.\n", "  We extend recently-developed mesh-free Lagrangian methods for numerical\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) to arbitrary anisotropic diffusion equations,\nincluding: passive scalar diffusion, Spitzer-Braginskii conduction and\nviscosity, cosmic ray diffusion/streaming, anisotropic radiation transport,\nnon-ideal MHD (Ohmic resistivity, ambipolar diffusion, the Hall effect), and\nturbulent 'eddy diffusion.' We study these as implemented in the code GIZMO for\nboth new meshless finite-volume Godunov schemes (MFM/MFV). We show the MFM/MFV\nmethods are accurate and stable even with noisy fields and irregular particle\narrangements, and recover the correct behavior even in arbitrarily anisotropic\ncases. They are competitive with state-of-the-art AMR/moving-mesh methods, and\ncan correctly treat anisotropic diffusion-driven instabilities (e.g. the MTI\nand HBI, Hall MRI). We also develop a new scheme for stabilizing anisotropic\ntensor-valued fluxes with high-order gradient estimators and non-linear flux\nlimiters, which is trivially generalized to AMR/moving-mesh codes. We also\npresent applications of some of these improvements for SPH, in the form of a\nnew integral-Godunov SPH formulation that adopts a moving-least squares\ngradient estimator and introduces a flux-limited Riemann problem between\nparticles.\n", "  Due to the combination of a substantial spin-orbit coupling and correlation\neffects, iridium oxides hold a prominent place in the search for novel quantum\nstates of matter, including, e.g., Kitaev spin liquids and topological Weyl\nstates. We establish the promise of the very recently synthesized\nhyper-honeycomb iridate $\\beta$-Li2IrO3 in this regard. A detailed theoretical\nanalysis reveals the presence of large ferromagnetic first-neighbor Kitaev\ninteractions, while a second-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange\ndrives the ground state from ferro to zigzag order via a three-dimensional\nKitaev spin liquid and an incommensurate phase. Experiment puts the system in\nthe latter regime but the Kitaev spin liquid is very close and reachable by a\nslight modification of the ratio between the second- and first-neighbor\ncouplings, for instance via strain.\n", "  Based on the nonperturbative analysis, we show that the classical motion of\nharmonic oscillator derived from the deformed QM is manifestly in contradiction\nwith observations. For this reason, we take an alternate way for estimating the\neffect and discuss its possible observational manifestations in macrophysics.\n", "  After a brief review of the foundations of (pre-metric) electromagnetism, we\nexplore some physical consequences of electrodynamics in curved spacetime. In\ngeneral, new electromagnetic couplings and related phenomena are induced by the\nspacetime curvature. The applications of astrophysical interest considered here\ncorrespond essentially to the following geometries: the Schwarzschild spacetime\nand the spacetime around a rotating spherical mass in the weak field and slow\nrotation regime. In the latter, we use the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN)\nformalism. We also explore the hypothesis that the electric and magnetic\nproperties of vacuum reflect the spacetime isometries. Therefore, the\npermittivity and permeability tensors should not be considered homogeneous and\nisotropic a priori. For spherical geometries we consider the effect of relaxing\nthe homogeneity assumption in the constitutive relations between the fields and\nexcitations. This affects the generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\\`{e}re laws\nwhere the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in vacuum depend on\nthe radial coordinate in accordance with the local isometries of space. For the\naxially symmetric geometries we relax both the assumptions of homogeneity and\nisotropy. We explore simple solutions and discuss the physical implications\nrelated to different phenomena such as: the decay of electromagnetic fields in\nthe presence of gravity, magnetic terms in Gauss law due to the\ngravitomagnetism of the spacetime around rotating objects, a frame-dragging\neffect on electric fields and the possibility of a spatial (radial) variability\nof the velocity of light in vacuum around spherical astrophysical objects for\nstrong gravitational fields.\n", "  We present a novel numerical method and algorithm for the solution of the 3D\naxially symmetric time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation in cylindrical\ncoordinates, involving singular Coulomb potential terms besides a smooth\ntime-dependent potential. We use fourth order finite difference real space\ndiscretization, with special formulae for the arising Neumann and Robin\nboundary conditions along the symmetry axis. Our propagation algorithm is based\non merging the method of the split-operator approximation of the exponential\noperator with the implicit equations of second order cylindrical 2D\nCrank-Nicolson scheme. We call this method hybrid splitting scheme because it\ninherits both the speed of the split step finite difference schemes and the\nrobustness of the full Crank-Nicolson scheme. Based on a thorough error\nanalysis, we verified both the fourth order accuracy of the spatial\ndiscretization in the optimal spatial step size range, and the fourth order\nscaling with the time step in the case of proper high order expressions of the\nsplit-operator. We demonstrate the performance and high accuracy of our hybrid\nsplitting scheme by simulating optical tunneling from a hydrogen atom due to a\nfew-cycle laser pulse with linear polarization.\n", "  We argue that a Bose-Einstein condensate can be transformed into a Floquet\ncondensate, that is, into a periodically time-dependent many-particle state\npossessing the coherence properties of a mesoscopically occupied\nsingle-particle Floquet state. Our reasoning is based on the observation that\nthe denseness of the many-body system's quasienergy spectrum does not\nnecessarily obstruct effectively adiabatic transport. Employing the idealized\nmodel of a driven bosonic Josephson junction, we demonstrate that only a small\namount of Floquet entropy is generated when a driving force with judiciously\nchosen frequency and maximum amplitude is turned on smoothly.\n", "  We suggest to subject anharmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensates to\nsinusoidal forcing with a smooth, slowly changing envelope, and to measure the\ncoherence of the system after such pulses. In a series of measurements with\nsuccessively increased maximum forcing strength one then expects an adiabatic\nreturn of the condensate to its initial state as long as the pulses remain\nsufficiently weak. In contrast, once the maximum driving amplitude exceeds a\ncertain critical value there should be a drastic loss of coherence, reflecting\nsignificant heating induced by the pulse. This predicted experimental signature\nis traced to the loss of an effective adiabatic invariant, and to the ensuing\nbreakdown of adiabatic motion of the system's Floquet state when the many-body\ndynamics become chaotic. Our scenario is illustrated with the help of a\ntwo-site model of a forced bosonic Josephson junction, but should also hold for\nother, experimentally accessible configurations.\n", "  Inspired by the works of Y. Ohta and J. Yang, one constructs the lumps\nsolutions in the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-(I) equation using the Grammian\ndeterminants. It is shown that the locations of peaks will depend on the real\nroots of Wronskian of the orthogonal polynomials for the asymptotic behaviors\nin some particular cases. Also, one can prove that all the locations of peaks\nare on a vertical line when time approaches - $\\infty$, and then they will be\non a horizontal line when time approaches $\\infty$, i.e., there is a rotation\n$\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ after interaction.\n", "  We present a protocol for Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking of arbitrary\nquantum gates using Monte Carlo sampling of quantum states. It is generally\napplicable, including non-Clifford gates while preserving key advantages of\nRandomized Benchmarking such as error amplification as well as independence\nfrom state preparation and measurement errors. This property is crucial for\nimplementations in many contemporary systems. Although the protocol scales\nexponentially in the number of qubits, it is superior to direct Monte Carlo\nsampling of the average gate fidelity in both the total number of experiments\nby orders of magnitude and savings in classical preprocessing, that are\nexponential.\n", "  Motivated by the experimental findings of some new exotic states decaying\ninto channels like $J/\\psi \\phi$, we investigate the formation of\nresonances/bound states in the $D^*_s\\bar D^*_s$ system using QCD sum rules. To\ndo this we start with a current of the type vector times vector and use spin\nprojectors to separate the spin 0, 1 and 2 contributions to the correlation\nfunction. We find three states with isospin 0, nearly spin degenerate, with a\nmass around 4.1 GeV. We have also investigated the decay of these states to\n$J/\\psi \\phi$ and provide the corresponding partial widths. Such information\nshould be useful for experimental studies in future.\n", "  We propose two-dimensional materials as targets for direct detection of dark\nmatter. Using graphene as an example, we focus on the case where dark matter\nscattering deposits sufficient energy on a valence-band electron to eject it\nfrom the target. We show that the sensitivity of graphene to dark matter of MeV\nto GeV mass can be comparable, for similar exposure and background levels, to\nthat of semiconductor targets such as silicon and germanium. Moreover, a\ntwo-dimensional target is an excellent directional detector, as the ejected\nelectron retains information about the angular dependence of the incident dark\nmatter particle. This proposal can be implemented by the PTOLEMY experiment,\npresenting for the first time an opportunity for directional detection of\nsub-GeV dark matter.\n", "  Future ground-based quantum information networks will likely use single\nphotons transmitted through optical fibers to entangle individual network\nnodes. To extend communication distances and overcome limitations due to photon\nabsorption in fibers the concept of quantum repeaters has been proposed. For\nthat purpose, it is required to achieve quantum correlations between the\nmaterial nodes and photons at telecom wavelengths which can be sent over long\ndistances in optical fibers. Here we demonstrate non-classical correlation\nbetween a frequency converted telecom C-band photon and a spin-wave stored in\nan atomic ensemble quantum memory. The photons emitted from the ensemble and\nheralding the spin-waves are converted from 780 nm to 1552 nm by means of an\nall-solid-state integrated waveguide non-linear device. We show ultra-low noise\noperation of the device enabling a high signal to noise ratio of the converted\nsingle photon, leading to a high spin-wave heralding efficiency. The presented\nwork is an enabling step towards the practical entanglement of remote quantum\nmemories and the entanglement of quantum systems operating at different\nwavelengths.\n", "  A comparative study is performed on volcanic seismicities at Icelandic\nvolcano, Eyjafjallaj\\\"okull, and Mt. Etna in Sicily from the viewpoint of\ncomplex systems science, and the discovery of remarkable similarities between\nthem is reported. In these seismicities as point processes, the jump\nprobability distributions of earthquakes (i.e., distributions of the distance\nbetween the hypocenters of two successive events) are found to obey the\nexponential law, whereas the waiting-time distributions (i.e., distributions of\ninter-occurrence time of two successive events) follow the power law. A careful\nanalysis is made about the finite size effects on the waiting-time\ndistributions, and the previously reported results for Mt. Etna (Abe and Suzuki\n2015) are reinterpreted accordingly. It is shown that the growth of the seismic\nregion in time is subdiffusive at both volcanoes. The aging phenomenon is\ncommonly observed in the \"event-time-averaged\" mean-squared displacements of\nthe hypocenters. A comment is also made on (non-)Markovianity of the processes.\n", "  It was previously believed that the Bloch electronic states of non-magnetic\nmaterials with inversion symmetry cannot have finite spin polarizations.\nHowever, since the seminal work by Zhang et al. [Nat. Phys. 10, 387-393 (2014)]\non local spin polarizations of Bloch states in non-magnetic, centrosymmetric\nmaterials, the scope of spintronics has been significantly broadened. Here, we\nshow, using a framework that is universally applicable independent of whether\nhidden spin polarizations are small (e.g., diamond, Si, Ge, and GaAs) or large\n(e.g., MoS2 and WSe2), that the corresponding quantity arising from orbital -\ninstead of spin - degrees of freedom, the hidden orbital polarization, is (i)\nmuch more abundant in nature since it exists even without spin-orbit coupling\nand (ii) more fundamental since the interband matrix elements of the\nsite-dependent orbital angular momentum operator determines the hidden spin\npolarization. We predict that the hidden spin polarization of transition metal\ndichalcogenides is reduced significantly upon compression. We suggest\nexperimental signatures of hidden orbital polarization from photoemission\nspectroscopies and demonstrate that the current-induced hidden orbital\npolarization may play a far more important role than its spin counterpart in\nantiferromagnetic information technology by calculating the current-driven\nantiferromagnetism in compressed silicon.\n", "  The latest experimental advances have extended the scenario of coupling\nmechanical degrees of freedom in chiral magnets (MnSi/MnGe) to the\ntopologically nontrivial skyrmion crystal and even monopole lattices. Equipped\nwith a spin-wave theory highlighting the topological features, we devise an\ninteracting model for acoustic phonons and magnons to explain the experimental\nfindings in a monopole lattice with a topological phase transition, i.e.,\nannihilation of monopole-antimonopole pairs. We reproduce the anisotropic\nmagnetoelastic modulations of elastic moduli: drastic ultrasonic softening\naround the phase transition and a multi-peak-and-trench fine structure for\nsound waves parallel and orthogonal to the magnetic field, respectively.\nComparison with experiments indicates that the magnetoelastic coupling induced\nby Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is comparable to that induced by the\nexchange interaction. Other possibilities such as elastic hardening are also\npredicted. The study implies that the monopole defects and their motion in MnGe\nplay a crucial role.\n", "  In the context of optical interferometry, only undersampled power spectrum\nand bispectrum data are accessible. It poses an ill-posed inverse problem for\nimage recovery. Recently, a tri-linear model was proposed for monochromatic\nimaging, leading to an alternated minimization problem. In that work, only a\npositivity constraint was considered, and the problem was solved by an\napproximated Gauss-Seidel method. In this paper, we propose to improve the\napproach on three fundamental aspects. Firstly, we define the estimated image\nas a solution of a regularized minimization problem, promoting sparsity in a\nfixed dictionary using either an $\\ell_1$ or a weighted-$\\ell_1$ regularization\nterm. Secondly, we solve the resultant non-convex minimization problem using a\nblock-coordinate forward-backward algorithm. This algorithm is able to deal\nboth with smooth and non-smooth functions, and benefits from convergence\nguarantees even in a non-convex context. Finally, we generalize our model and\nalgorithm to the hyperspectral case, promoting a joint sparsity prior through\nan $\\ell_{2,1}$ regularization term. We present simulation results, both for\nmonochromatic and hyperspectral cases, to validate the proposed approach.\n", "  We construct and study perturbative unitarity (i.e., ghost and tachyon\nanalysis) of a $3+1$-dimensional noncompact Weyl-Einstein-Yang-Mills model. The\nmodel describes a local noncompact Weyl's scale plus $SU(N)$ phase invariant\nHiggs-like field, conformally coupled to a generic Weyl-invariant dynamical\nbackground. Here, the Higgs-like sector generates the Weyl's conformal\ninvariance of system. The action does not admit any dimensionful parameter and\ngenuine presence of de Sitter vacuum spontaneously breaks the noncompact gauge\nsymmetry in an analogous manner to the Standard Model Higgs mechanism. As to\nflat spacetime, the dimensionful parameter is generated within the dimensional\ntransmutation in quantum field theories, and thus the symmetry is radiatively\nbroken through the one-loop Effective Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that\nthe mere expectation of reducing to Einstein's gravity in the broken phases\nforbids anti-de Sitter space to be its stable vacua. The model is unitary in de\nSitter and flat vacua around which a massless graviton, $N^2-1$ massless scalar\nbosons, $N$ massless Dirac fermions, $N^2-1$ Proca-type massive Abelian and\nnon-Abelian vector bosons are generically propagated.\n", "  The ground-state magnetic phase diagram is calculated within the Hubbard and\n$s$-$d$ exchange (Kondo) models for square and simple cubic lattices vs. band\nfilling and interaction parameter. The difference of the results owing to the\npresence of localized moments in the latter model is discussed. We employ a\ngeneralized Hartree-Fock approximation (HFA) to treat commensurate\nferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM), and incommensurate (spiral)\nmagnetic phases. The electron correlations are taken into account within the\nHubbard model by using the Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave boson approximation (SBA).\nThe main advantage of this approach is a correct qualitative description of the\nparamagnetic phase: its energy becomes considerably lower as compared with HFA,\nand the gain in the energy of magnetic phases is substantially reduced.\n", "  We estimate chemical freeze-out parameters in HRG and EVHRG model by fitting\nthe experimental information of net-proton and net-charge fluctuations measured\nin Au + Au collisions by the STAR collaboration at RHIC. We observe that\nchemical freeze-out parameters obtained from lower and higher order\nfluctuations are though almost same for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} > 27$ GeV, tend to\ndeviate from each other at lower $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Moreover, these separations\nincrease with decrease of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ and for a fixed $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\nincrease towards central collisions. Furthermore, we observe an approximate\nscaling behaviour of $(\\mu_B/T)/(\\mu_B/T)_{central}$ with\n$(N_{part})/(N_{part})_{central}$ for the parameters estimated from lower order\nfluctuations for 11.5 GeV $\\le \\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\le$ 200 GeV. Scaling is violated\nfor the parameters estimated from higher order fluctuations for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=\n11.5$ and 19.6 GeV. It is observed that the chemical freeze-out parameter,\nwhich can describe $\\sigma^2/M$ of net-proton very well in all energies and\ncentralities, can not describe the $s\\sigma$ equally well and vice versa.\n", "  When a disordered array of coupled waveguides is illuminated with an extended\ncoherent optical field, discrete speckle develops: partially coherent light\nwith a granular intensity distribution on the lattice sites. The same paradigm\napplies to a variety of other settings in photonics, such as imperfectly\ncoupled resonators or fibers with randomly coupled cores. Through numerical\nsimulations and analytical modeling, we uncover a set of surprising features\nthat characterize discrete speckle in one- and two-dimensional lattices known\nto exhibit transverse Anderson localization. Firstly, the fingerprint of\nlocalization is embedded in the fluctuations of the discrete speckle and is\nrevealed in the narrowing of the spatial coherence function. Secondly, the\ntransverse coherence length (or speckle grain size) is frozen during\npropagation. Thirdly, the axial coherence depth is independent of the axial\nposition, thereby resulting in a coherence voxel of fixed volume independently\nof position. We take these unique features collectively to define a distinct\nregime that we call discrete Anderson speckle.\n", "  It has been reported in the literature that the survival probability $P(t)$\nnear an exceptional point where two eigenstates coalesce should generally\nexhibit an evolution $P(t) \\sim t^2 e^{-\\Gamma t}$, in which $\\Gamma$ is the\ndecay rate of the coalesced eigenstate; this has been verified in a microwave\nbilliard experiment [B. Dietz, et al, Phys. Rev. E 75, 027201 (2007)]. However,\nthe heuristic effective Hamiltonian that is usually employed to obtain this\nresult ignores the possible influence of the continuum threshold on the\ndynamics. By contrast, in this work we employ an analytical approach starting\nfrom the microscopic Hamiltonian representing two simple models in order to\nshow that the continuum threshold has a strong influence on the dynamics near\nexceptional points in a variety of circumstances. To report our results, we\ndivide the exceptional points in Hermitian open quantum systems into two cases:\nat an EP2A two virtual bound states coalesce before forming a resonance,\nanti-resonance pair with complex conjugate eigenvalues, while at an EP2B two\nresonances coalesce before forming two different resonances. For the EP2B,\nwhich is the case studied in the microwave billiard experiment, we verify the\nsurvival probability exhibits the previously reported modified exponential\ndecay on intermediate timescales, but this is replaced with an inverse power\nlaw on very long timescales. Meanwhile, for the EP2A the influence from the\ncontinuum threshold is so strong that the evolution is non-exponential on all\ntimescales and the heuristic approach fails completely. When the EP2A appears\nvery near the threshold we obtain the novel evolution $P(t) \\sim 1 - C_1\n\\sqrt{t} + D_1 t$ on intermediate timescales, while further away the parabolic\ndecay (Zeno dynamics) on short timescales is enhanced. We also discuss the\nparametric encirclement of the EP2A in an appendix.\n", "  We report on the first proper motion measurement in the supernova remnant RX\nJ1713.7-3946 using the XMM-Newton X-ray telescope on a 13 year time interval.\nThis expansion measurement is carried out in the south-east region of the\nremnant where two sharp filament structures are observed. For the outermost\nfilament, the proper motion is $0.73\\pm0.047_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.069_{\\rm syst}$\narcsec yr$^{-1}$ which is equivalent to a shock speed of 3500 km s$^{-1}$ at a\ndistance of 1 kpc. In contrast with the bright north-west region where the\nshock is interacting with the border of the cavity, the shock in the south-east\nregion is probably expanding in the original ambient medium carved by the\nprogenitor and can be used to derive the current density at the shock and the\nage of the remnant. In the case where the shock is evolving in a wind profile\n($\\rho \\propto r^{-s}$, s=2) or in a uniform medium (s=0), we estimate an age\nof 2300 yrs and 1800 yrs respectively for an ejecta power-law index n=9. The\nspecific case of n=7 and s=0, yields an age of 1550 yrs which would reconcile\nRX J1713.7-3946 with the historical records of SN 393. In all scenarios, we\nderive similar upstream densities of the order of 0.01 cm$^{-3}$, compatible\nwith the lack of thermal X-rays from the shocked ambient medium.\n", "  We study a frustrated spin-$S$ staggered-dimer Heisenberg model on square\nlattice by using the bond-operator representation for quantum spins, and\ninvestigate the emergence of classical magnetic order from the quantum\nmechanical (staggered-dimer singlet) ground state for increasing $S$. Using\ntriplon analysis, we find the critical couplings for this quantum phase\ntransition to scale as $1/S(S+1)$. We extend the triplon analysis to include\nthe effect of quintet dimer-states, which proves to be essential for\nestablishing the classical order (N\\'eel or collinear in the present study) for\nlarge $S$, both in the purely Heisenberg case and also in the model with\nsingle-ion anisotropy.\n", "  Rainbow metrics are a widely used approach to metric formalism for theories\nwith Modified Dispersion Relations. They have had a huge success in the Quantum\nGravity Phenomenology literature, since they allow to introduce\nmomentum-dependent spacetime metrics into the description of systems with\nModified Dispersion Relation. In this paper, we introduce the reader to some\nrealizations of this general idea: the original Rainbow metrics proposal, the\nmomentum-space-inspired metric, the standard Finsler geometry approach and our\nalternative definition of a four-velocity-dependent metric with a massless\nlimit. This paper aims to highlight some of their properties and how to\nproperly describe their relativistic realizations.\n", "  We provide and study complete sets of one-loop renormalization group\nequations of several Finkel'stein non-linear $\\sigma$-models, the effective\nfield theories describing the diffusive quantum fluctuations in correlated\ndisordered systems. We consider different cases according to the presence of\ncertain symmetries induced by the original random Hamiltonians, and we show\nthat, for interacting systems, the Cartan's classification of symmetry classes\nis not enough to uniquely determine their scaling behaviors.\n", "  The art of advertising one's scientific achievements, of which Galileo was an\nearly master, is a trademark of successful modern science. Dedicated believers\nand mystics of science, such as Kepler, are less popular. Yet, an alleged\nrigorous rationalist like Wolfgang Pauli found in his later troubled life a\nkinship to Kepler's \"archetypal ideas\".\n", "  The radiation arising under uniform motion of non-relativistic charged\nparticle by (or through) perfectly conducting sphere is considered. The\nrigorous results are obtained using the method of images known from\nelectrostatics.\n", "  Motivated by the recent observations of nodeless superconductivity in the\nmonolayer CuO$_{2}$ grown on the Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta }$\nsubstrates, we study the two-dimensional superconducting (SC) phases described\nby the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model in proximity to an antiferromagnetic (AF)\ninsulator. We found that (i) the nodal d-wave SC state can be driven via a\ncontinuous transition into a nodeless d-wave pairing state by the proximity\ninduced AF field. (ii) The energetically favorable pairing states in the strong\nfield regime have extended s-wave symmetry and can be nodal or nodeless. (iii)\nBetween the pure d-wave and s-wave paired phases, there emerge two\ntopologically distinct SC phases with ($s+$i$d$) symmetry, i.e., the weak and\nstrong pairing phases, and the weak pairing phase is found to be a $Z_{2}$\ntopological superconductor protected by valley symmetry, exhibiting robust\ngapless non-chiral edge modes. These findings strongly suggest that the\nhigh-$T_{c}$ superconductors in proximity to antiferromagnets can realize fully\ngapped symmetry protected topological SC.\n", "  Models of loop quantum gravity based on real connections have a deformed\nnotion of general covariance, which leads to the phenomenon of signature\nchange. This result is confirmed here in a general analysis of all\nmidisuperspace models without local degrees of freedom. As a subclass of\nmodels, 2-dimensional theories of dilaton gravity appear, but a larger set of\nexamples is possible based only on the condition of anomaly freedom. While the\nclassical dilaton gravity models are the only such systems without deformed\ncovariance, they do give rise to signature change when holonomy modifications\nare included.\n", "  This paper concerns the asymptotic behavior of zeros and critical points for\nmonochromatic random waves $\\phi_\\lambda$ of frequency $\\lambda$ on a compact,\nsmooth, Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ as $\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty$. We prove\nthat the measure of integration over the zero set of $\\phi_\\lambda$ restricted\nto balls of radius $\\approx \\lambda^{-1}$ converges in distribution to the\nmeasure of integration over the zero set of a frequency $1$ random wave on\n$\\mathbb R^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of $M$. We also prove convergence of\nfinite moments for the counting measure of the critical points of\n{\\phi}{\\lambda}, again restricted to balls of radius $\\approx \\lambda^{-1}$, to\nthe corresponding moments for frequency $1$ random waves. We then patch\ntogether these local results to obtain new global variance estimates on the\nvolume of the zero set and numbers of critical points of $\\phi_\\lambda$ on all\nof $M.$ Our local results hold under conditions about the structure of\ngeodesics on $M$ that are generic in the space of all metrics on $M$, while our\nglobal results hold whenever $(M,g)$ has no conjugate points (e.g is negatively\ncurved).\n", "  Community detection and link prediction are both of great significance in\nnetwork analysis, which provide very valuable insights into topological\nstructures of the network from different perspectives. In this paper, we\npropose a novel community detection algorithm with inclusion of link\nprediction, motivated by the question whether link prediction can be devoted to\nimproving the accuracy of community partition. For link prediction, we propose\ntwo novel indices to compute the similarity between each pair of nodes, one of\nwhich aims to add missing links, and the other tries to remove spurious edges.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets, and the results of\nour proposed algorithm are compared with two classes of baseline. In\nconclusion, our proposed algorithm is competitive, revealing that link\nprediction does improve the precision of community detection.\n", "  We discuss the properties of the dynamics of purely memristive circuits using\na recently derived consistent equation for the internal memory variables of the\ninvolved memristors. In particular, we show that the number of independent\nmemory states in a memristive circuit is constrained by the circuit\nconservation laws, and that the dynamics preserves these symmetries by means of\na projection on the physical subspace. Moreover, we discuss other symmetries of\nthe dynamics under various transformations of the internal memory, and study\nthe linearized and strongly non-linear regimes of the dynamics. In the strongly\nnon-linear regime, we derive a conservation law for the internal memory\nvariables. We also provide a condition on the reality of the eigenvalues of\nLyapunov matrices describing the linearized dynamics close to a fixed point. We\nshow that the eigenvalues ca be imaginary only for mixtures of passive and\nactive components. Our last result concerns the weak non-linear regime. We show\nthat the internal memory dynamics can be interpreted as a constrained gradient\ndescent, and provide the functional being minimized. This latter result\nprovides another direct connection between memristors and learning.\n", "  We report the exfoliation of graphite in aqueous solutions under high shear\nrate [$\\sim10^8s^{-1}$] turbulent flow conditions, with a 100\\% exfoliation\nyield. The material is stabilized without centrifugation at concentrations up\nto 100 g/L using carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt to formulate conductive\nprintable inks. The sheet resistance of blade coated films is\nbelow$\\sim2\\Omega/\\square$. This is a simple and scalable production route for\ngraphene-based conductive inks for large area printing in flexible electronics.\n", "  In his 1977 paper on vacuum decay in field theory: The Fate of the False\nVacuum, Coleman considered the problem of a single scalar field and assumed\nthat the minimum action tunnelling field configuration, the bounce, is\ninvariant under O(4) rotations in Euclidean space. A proof of the O(4)\ninvariance of the bounce was provided later by Coleman, Glaser, and Martin\n(CGM), who extended the proof to $N>2$ Euclidean dimensions but, again,\nrestricted non-trivially to a single scalar field. As far as we know a proof of\nO($N$) invariance of the bounce for the tunnelling problem with multiple scalar\nfields has not been reported, even though it was assumed in many works since,\nbeing of phenomenological interest. We make progress towards closing this gap.\nFollowing CGM we define the reduced problem of finding a field configuration\nminimizing the kinetic energy at fixed potential energy. Given a solution of\nthe reduced problem, the minimum action bounce can always be obtained from it\nby means of a scale transformation. We show that if a solution of the reduced\nproblem exists, then it and the minimum action bounce derived from it are\nindeed O($N$) symmetric.\n", "  We study two self-interacting scalar field theories in their high-temperature\nlimit using path integrals on a lattice. We first discuss the formalism and\nrecover known potentials to validate the method. We then discuss how these\ntheories can model, in the high-temperature limit, the strong interaction and\nGeneral Relativity. For the strong interaction, the model recovers the known\nphenomenology of the nearly static regime of heavy quarkonia. The model also\nexposes a possible origin for the emergence of the confinement scale from the\napproximately conformal Lagrangian. Aside from such possible insights, the main\npurpose of addressing the strong interaction here --given that more\nsophisticated approaches already exist-- is mostly to further verify the\npertinence of the model in the more complex case of General Relativity for\nwhich non-perturbative methods are not as developed. The results have important\nimplications on the nature of Dark Matter. In particular, non-perturbative\neffects naturally provide flat rotation curves for disk galaxies, without need\nfor non-baryonic matter, and explain as well other observations involving Dark\nMatter such as cluster dynamics or the dark mass of elliptical galaxies.\n", "  We analyze an extension of the Standard Model with an additional SU(2)\nhypercolor gauge group keeping the Higgs boson as a fundamental field.\nVectorlike interactions of new hyperquarks with the intermediate vector bosons\nare explicitly constructed. We also consider pseudo-Nambu--Goldstone bosons\ncaused by the symmetry breaking SU(4)-> Sp(4). A specific global symmetry of\nthe model with zero hypercharge of the hyperquark doublets ensures the\nstability of a neutral pseudoscalar field. Some possible manifestations of the\nlightest states at colliders are also examined.\n", "  In this article we extend the celebrated Berry-phase formulation of electric\npolarization in crystals to higher electric multipole moments. We determine the\nnecessary conditions under which, and minimal models in which, the quadrupole\nand octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables.\nSuch systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional\ntopological phases. Furthermore, they manifest topologically protected corner\nstates carrying fractional charge, i.e., fractionalization at the boundary of\nthe boundary. To characterize these new insulating phases of matter, we\nintroduce a new paradigm whereby `nested' Wilson loops give rise to a large\nnumber of new topological invariants that have been previously overlooked. We\npropose three realistic experimental implementations of this new topological\nbehavior that can be immediately tested.\n", "  In order to predict the potential energy surface (PES) from measured\nstructure in equilibrium state, one should typically perform trial-and-error\nstatistical thermodynamic simulation with assumed multibody interactions. Very\nrecently, we derive map from a set of equilibrium structure in crystalline\nsolids to that of corresponding PES in explicit matrix form, where the PES can\nbe inversely determined from the measured structure. The practical problem to\nconstruct the map appears when system size of measured structure is not\nsufficiently large, which results in non-trivial treatment of asymmetry problem\nin the map. The present study proposes alternative approach to avoiding\ntreatment of the asymmetry problem, demonstrating more accurate prediction of\nthe PES than the map constructed by explicitly treating the asymmetry.\n", "  The interest in the properties of edge states in Chern insulators and in\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator has increased rapidly in recent years. We\npresent calculations on how to influence the transport properties of chiral and\nhelical edge states by modifications of the edges in the Haldane and in the\nKane-Mele model. The Fermi velocity of the chiral edge states becomes\ndirection-dependent as does the spin-dependent Fermi velocity of the helical\nedge states. Moreover, it is possible to tune the Fermi velocity by orders of\nmagnitude. Additionally, we explicitly investigate the robustness of edge\nstates against local disorder. The edge states can be reconstructed in the\nBrillouin zone in presence of disorder. The influence of the width and of the\nlength of the system is studied as well as the dependence on the strength of\nthe disorder.\n", "  The Josephson supercurrent through the hybrid Majorana--quantum dot--Majorana\njunction is investigated. We particularly analyze the effect of spin-selective\ncoupling between the Majorana and quantum dot states, which emerges only in the\ntopological phase and will influence the current through bent junctions and/or\nin the presence of magnetic fields in the quantum dot. We find that the\ncharacteristic behaviors of the supercurrent through this system are quite\ncounterintuitive, remarkably differing from the resonant tunneling, e.g.,\nthrough the similar (normal phase) superconductor--quantum dot--superconductor\njunction. Our analysis is carried out under the influence of full set-up\nparameters and for both the $2\\pi$ and $4\\pi$ periodic currents. The present\nstudy is expected to be relevant to future exploration of applications of the\nMajorana-nanowire circuits.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a set of two-level systems coupled by dipolar\ninteractions under a resonant external Rabi drive. The two-level systems are\nprepared initially in a coherent product state, and we ask how the\nnon-equilibrium conditions caused by the drive affect this coherence. We study\nthe full non-linear dynamics of the coupled two-level systems within a\nclassical approximation by analysing numerically the equations of motion and\ndetermining the stability of the collective coherent state within classical\nFloquet theory. We establish the behaviour analytically in the high Rabi\ncoupling limit by employing a Magnus expansion and spin wave analysis. Our\nresults show that, typically, the dipole interactions between the two-level\nsystems lead to instabilities that cause a breakdown of the collective Rabi\noscillations. However, we identify parameter regimes for which the two-level\nsystems undergo collective coherent Rabi oscillations even in the presence of\nthe dipole interactions.\n", "  The worldline formalism has previously been used for deriving compact master\nformulas for the one-loop N-photon amplitudes in both scalar and spinor QED,\nand in the vacuum as well as in a constant external field. For scalar QED,\nthere is also an analogous master formula for the propagator dressed with N\nphotons in the vacuum. Here, we extend this master formula to include a\nconstant field. The two-photon case is worked out explicitly, yielding an\nintegral representation for the Compton scattering cross section in the field\nsuitable for numerical integration in the full range of electric and magnetic\nfield strengths.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the growth rates of action for the anti-de\nSitter black holes in massive-Einstein gravity models and obtain the universal\nbehaviors of the growth rates of action (the rates of holographic complexity)\nwithin the \"Wheeler-DeWitt\"(WDW) patch at the late limit. Furthermore, we find\nthat, for the static neutral cases, when the same mass of black holes is given,\nthe computational speed of the neutral massive black hole is the same as its\nEinstein gravity counterpart, which is independent with the effect of the\ngraviton mass terms, nevertheless, for the static charged cases, when the same\nmass and charge parameters of black holes are given, the growth rates of action\nfor the massive charged black holes are always superior to the growth rates of\naction without graviton mass terms, which directly shows that the massive\ncharged black holes as computers on the computational speeds are faster than\ntheir Einstein gravity counterparts.\n", "  We study the dynamics of large, charged dust grains in turbulent giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs). Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions.\n", "  We study supersymmetric intersections of NS5-, D6- and D8-branes in type IIA\nstring theory. We focus on the supergravity description of this system and\nidentify a \"near horizon\" limit in which we recover the recently classified\nsupersymmetric seven-dimensional AdS solutions of massive type IIA\nsupergravity. Using a consistent truncation to seven-dimensional gauged\nsupergravity we construct a universal supersymmetric deformation of these AdS\nvacua. In the holographic dual six-dimensional (1,0) superconformal field\ntheory this deformation describes a universal RG flow on the tensor branch of\nthe vacuum moduli space triggered by a vacuum expectation value for a protected\nscalar operator of dimension four.\n", "  MeV-scale magnetic fields in the interiors of magnetars suppress the pairing\nof neutrons and protons in the $S$-wave state. In the case of a neutron\ncondensate the suppression is the consequence of the Pauli-paramagnetism of the\nneutron gas, i.e., the alignment of the neutron spins along the magnetic field.\nThe proton $S$-wave pairing is suppressed because of the Landau diamagnetic\ncurrents of protons induced by the field. The Ginzburg-Landau and BCS theories\nof the critical magnetic fields for unpairing are reviewed. The macrophysical\nimplications of the suppression (unpairing) of the condensates are discussed\nfor the rotational crust-core coupling in magnetars and the neutrino-dominated\ncooling era of their thermal evolution.\n", "  It has been shown that the thin brane model in a five-dimensional Weyl\ngravity can deal with the wrong-signed Friedmann-like equation in the\nRandall--Sundrum-1 (RS1) model. In the Weyl brane model, there are also two\nbranes with opposite brane tensions, but the four-dimensional graviton (the\ngravity zero mode) is localized near the negative tension brane, while our\nfour-dimensional universe is localized on the positive tension brane. In this\npaper, we consider the mass spectra of various bulk matter fields (i.e.,\nscalar, vector, and fermion fields) on the Weyl brane. It is shown that the\nzero modes of those matter fields can be localized on the positive tension\nbrane under some conditions. The mass spectra of the bulk matter fields are\nequidistant for the higher excited states, and relatively sparse for the lower\nexcited states. The size of the extra dimension determines the gap of the mass\nspectra. We also consider the correction to the Newtonian potential in this\nmodel and it is proportional to $1/r^{3}$.\n", "  For every $\\epsilon>0$, we give an\n$\\exp(\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^2))$-time algorithm for the $1$ vs\n$1-\\epsilon$ \\emph{Best Separable State (BSS)} problem of distinguishing, given\nan $n^2\\times n^2$ matrix $\\mathcal{M}$ corresponding to a quantum measurement,\nbetween the case that there is a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state $\\rho$\nthat $\\mathcal{M}$ accepts with probability $1$, and the case that every\nseparable state is accepted with probability at most $1-\\epsilon$.\nEquivalently, our algorithm takes the description of a subspace $\\mathcal{W}\n\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^{n^2}$ (where $\\mathbb{F}$ can be either the real or\ncomplex field) and distinguishes between the case that $\\mathcal{W}$ contains a\nrank one matrix, and the case that every rank one matrix is at least $\\epsilon$\nfar (in $\\ell_2$ distance) from $\\mathcal{W}$.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first improvement over the\nbrute-force $\\exp(n)$-time algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm is based\non the \\emph{sum-of-squares} hierarchy and its analysis is inspired by Lovett's\nproof (STOC '14, JACM '16) that the communication complexity of every rank-$n$\nBoolean matrix is bounded by $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$.\n", "  We study the Nernst effect in fluctuating superconductors by calculating the\ntransport coefficient $\\alpha_{xy}$ in a phenomenological model where relative\nimportance of phase and amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter is tuned\ncontinuously to smoothly evolve from an effective XY model to more conventional\nGinzburg-Landau description. To connect with a concrete experimental\nrealization we choose the model parameters appropriate for cuprate\nsuperconductors and calculate $\\alpha_{xy}$ and the magnetization ${\\bf M}$\nover the entire range of experimentally accessible values of field, temperature\nand doping. We argue that $\\alpha_{xy}$ and ${\\bf M}$ are both determined by\nthe equilibrium properties of the superconducting fluctuations (and not their\ndynamics) despite the former being a transport quantity. Thus, the\nexperimentally observed correlation between the Nernst signal and the\nmagnetization arises primarily from the correlation between $\\alpha_{xy}$ and\n${\\bf M}$. Further, there exists a dimensionless ratio ${\\bf M}/(T\n\\alpha_{xy})$ that quantifies this correlation. We calculate, for the first\ntime, this ratio over the entire phase diagram of the cuprates and find it\nagrees with previous results obtained in specific parts of the phase diagram.\nWe conclude that that there appears to be no sharp distinction between the\nregimes dominated by phase fluctuations and Gaussian fluctuations for this\nratio in contrast to $\\alpha_{xy}$ and ${\\bf M}$ individually. The utility of\nthis ratio is that it can be used to determine the extent to which\nsuperconducting fluctuations contribute to the Nernst effect in different parts\nof the phase diagram given the measured values of magnetization.\n", "  Spin-momentum locking in a semiconductor device with strong spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) is a fundamental goal of nanoscale spintronics and an important\nprerequisite for the formation of Majorana bound states. Such a helical state\nis predicted in one-dimensional (1D) nanowires subject to strong Rashba SOC and\nspin-mixing, its hallmark being a characteristic reentrant behaviour in the\nconductance. Here, we report the first direct experimental observations of the\nreentrant conductance feature, which reveals the formation of a helical liquid,\nin the lowest 1D subband of an InAs nanowire. Surprisingly, the feature is very\nprominent also in the absence of magnetic fields. This behaviour suggests that\nexchange interaction exhibits substantial impact on transport in our device. We\nattribute the opening of the pseudogap to spin-flipping two-particle\nbackscattering. The all-electric origin of the ideal helical transport bears\nmomentous implications for topological quantum computing.\n", "  The round-robin differential phase shift (RRDPS) quantum key distribution\n(QKD) protocol is a unique quantum key distribution protocol whose security has\nnot been understood through an information-disturbance trade-off relation, and\na sufficient amount of privacy amplification was given independently of signal\ndisturbance. Here, we discuss the security of the RRDPS protocol in the\nasymptotic regime when a good estimate of the bit error rate is available as a\nmeasure of signal disturbance. The uniqueness of the RRDPS protocol shows up as\na peculiar form of information-disturbance trade-off curve. When the length of\na block of pulses used for encoding and the signal disturbance are both small,\nit provides a significantly better key rate than that from the original\nsecurity proof. On the other hand, when the block length is large, the use of\nthe signal disturbance makes little improvement in the key rate. Our analysis\nwill bridge a gap between the RRDPS protocol and the conventional QKD\nprotocols.\n", "  For the first time, a comparison to the predicted behavior for parallel\ncritical field is carried out for the model of Kogan and the model of Hara and\nNagai. In this study, thin niobium films in the moderately dirty regime were\nconsidered. Experimental values of the $-C_{2}$ term are seen to be lower than\nthose from the model of Hara and Nagai. A possible reason for this could be not\nincluding the non spherical Fermi surface of niobium into the model. There is\nclearly disagreement with the model of Kogan as the films get cleaner and\nthinner, and two films which should be below his critical thickness still show\npositive values of $-C_{2}$, in disagreement with his theory.\n", "  The essence of both classical and quantum engines is to extract useful energy\n(work) from stochastic energy sources, e.g. thermal baths. In Maxwell's demon\nengines, work extraction is assisted by a feedback control based on\nmeasurements performed by a demon, whose memory is erased at some nonzero\nenergy cost. Here we propose a new type of quantum Maxwell's demon engine where\nwork is directly extracted from the measurement channel, such that no heat bath\nis required. We show that in the Zeno regime of frequent measurements, memory\nerasure costs eventually vanish. Our findings provide a new paradigm to analyze\nquantum heat engines and work extraction in the quantum world.\n", "  The hard square lattice gas model on a square lattice is known to undergo a\ncontinuous phase transition from a low density fluid-like phase to high density\nphase with columnar or smectic order. We estimate the critical activity $z_c$\nby calculating, within an approximation scheme, the interfacial tension between\ntwo differently ordered columnar phases, and then setting it to zero. The\napproximation scheme allows for the ordered phases to have multiple defects and\nthe interface between the ordered phases to have overhangs. We estimate\n$z_c=105.35$, which is in good agreement with existing Monte Carlo simulation\nresults of $z_c \\approx 97.5$, and is an improvement over earlier best\nestimates of $z_c=54.87$ and $z_c=135.63$.\n", "  We perform linear stability analysis and nonlinear slender filament\nsimulations of extensional necking in complex fluids and soft solids, during\nthe stress relaxation process following an interrupted strain ramp. We start by\nderiving analytical criteria for necking within a highly simplified and\ngeneralised scalar constitutive model. Here, we find two different possible\nmodes of necking: one associated with an upward curvature in the stress\nrelaxation function on a log-linear plot, and another related to a carefully\ndefined `elastic' derivative of the tensile force with respect to an imagined\nsudden strain increment. We showed these two criteria to agree fully with\nsimulations of the Oldroyd B and Giesekus models of polymeric solutions, and\nwith the RoliePoly model of more concentrated polymeric solutions and melts,\nwithout polymer chain stretch. With chain stretch included, we find a slightly\nmore complicated analytical criterion for necking during the stress relaxation,\nwith key ingredients that closely mirror counterpart ingredients of the simpler\ncriteria obtained within the scalar model. We show this criterion to agree\nfully with slender filament simulations of the RoliePoly model with chain\nstretch, and with the scenario discussed by the Copenhagen group in Refs. [1,\n2]. In particular, we see delayed necking after strain ramps with an\naccumulated strain exceeding ~ 0.7, for ramp rates exceeding the inverse chain\nstretch relaxation timescale. We discuss finally an analogy between this\ndelayed necking following an interrupted extensional strain ramp and delayed\nshear banding following an interrupted shear strain ramp [3]. This work\nprovides the counterpart, for interrupted extensional strain ramps, to earlier\npapers giving criteria for necking in the protocols of constant imposed Hencky\nstrain rate [4] and of constant imposed tensile stress or constant imposed\ntensile force [5].\n", "  We investigate the Fermi polaron problem in a spin-1/2 Fermi gas in an\noptical lattice for the limit of both strong repulsive contact interactions and\none dimension. In this limit, a polaronic-like behaviour is not expected, and\nthe physics is that of a magnon or impurity. While the charge degrees of\nfreedom of the system are frozen, the resulting tight-binding Hamiltonian for\nthe impurity's spin exhibits an intriguing structure that strongly depends on\nthe filling factor of the lattice potential. This filling dependency also\ntransfers to the nature of the interactions for the case of two magnons and the\nimportant spin balanced case. At low filling, and up until near unit filling,\nthe single impurity Hamiltonian faithfully reproduces a single-band,\nquasi-homogeneous tight-binding problem. As the filling is increased and the\nsecond band of the single particle spectrum of the periodic potential is\nprogressively filled, the impurity Hamiltonian, at low energies, describes a\nsingle particle trapped in a multi-well potential. Interestingly, once the\nfirst two bands are fully filled, the impurity Hamiltonian is a near-perfect\nrealisation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Our studies, which go well\nbeyond the single-band approximation, that is, the Hubbard model, pave the way\nfor the realisation of interacting one-dimensional models of condensed matter\nphysics.\n", "  Generating water steam by solar energy is a significant process for many\nfields. In this paper, a low-cost high-efficiency wick type steam generator is\nproposed. It's based on the heat localization and thin-film evaporation. The\nmeasurements show that the energy efficiency is 84 % at 1 kw/m2. Besides, the\ndependence of efficiency on particle concentration and size are discussed. The\noptimal particle concentration is found at 60 g/m2, and a smaller particle size\ngives higher efficiency. The experimental results agree well with the\ntheoretical prediction based on thin-film evaporation theory. Our study offers\na new in-depth understanding of low-cost high-efficiency solar steam\ngeneration.\n", "  The Bose polaron is a quasi-particle of an impurity dressed by surrounding\nbosons. In few-body physics, it is known that two identical bosons and a third\ndistinguishable particle can form a sequence of Efimov bound states in the\nvicinity of inter-species scattering resonance. On the other hand, in the Bose\npolaron system with an impurity atom embedded in many bosons, no signature of\nEfimov physics has been reported in the existing spectroscopy measurements up\nto date. In this work, we propose that a large mass imbalance between a light\nimpurity and heavy bosons can help produce visible signatures of Efimov physics\nin such a spectroscopy measurement. Using the diagrammatic approach in the\nVirial expansion to include three-body effects from pair-wise interactions, we\ndetermine the impurity self-energy and its spectral function. Taking\n$^{6}$Li-$^{133}$Cs\\ system as a concrete example, we find two visible Efimov\nbranches in the polaron spectrum, as well as their hybridizations with the\nattractive polaron branch. We also discuss the general scenarios for observing\nthe signature of Efimov physics in polaron systems. This work paves the way for\nexperimentally exploring intriguing few-body correlations in a many-body system\nin the near future.\n", "  Network support is a key success factor for talented people. As an example,\nthe Hungarian Talent Support Network involves close to 1500 Talent Points and\nmore than 200,000 people. This network started the Hungarian Templeton Program\nidentifying and helping 315 exceptional cognitive talents. This network is a\npart of the European Talent Support Network initiated by the European Council\nfor High Ability involving more than 300 organizations in over 30 countries in\nEurope and extending in other continents. These networks are giving good\nexamples that talented people often occupy a central, but highly dynamic\nposition in social networks. The involvement of such 'creative nodes' in\nnetwork-related decision making processes is vital, especially in novel\nenvironmental challenges. Such adaptive/learning responses characterize a large\nvariety of complex systems from proteins, through brains to society. It is\ncrucial for talent support programs to use these networking and learning\nprocesses to increase their efficiency further.\n", "  We have analytically investigated the effects of non-linearity on the free\nenergy and thermodynamic geometry of holographic superconductors in $2+1\n-$dimensions. The non-linear effect is introduced by considering the coupling\nof the massive charged scalar field with Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We then\ncalculate the relation between critical temperature and charge density from two\ndifferent methods, namely, the matching method and the divergence of the scalar\ncurvature which is obtained by investigating the thermodynamic geometry of the\nmodel. The two results are slightly different from numerical values but the\neffects of non-linearity gets captured in our analysis.\n", "  Thermoelectrics (TE) materials manifest themselves in direct conversion of\ntemperature differences to electric power and vice versa. Despite remarkable\nadvances have been achieved in the past decades for various TE systems, the\nenergy conversion efficiencies of TE devices, which is characterized by a\ndimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT ), remain a generally poor factor that\nseverely limits their competitiveness and range of employment. The bottleneck\nfor substantially boosting ZT coefficient lies in the strong interdependence of\nthe physical parameters involved in electronic and phononic transport. Here, we\npropose a new strategy of incorporating nanotwinned structures to decouple the\nelectronic and phononic transport. Combining the new concept of nanotwin with\nthe previously widely used nanocrystalline approach, the power factor of the Si\nnanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures is enhanced by 120% compared to bulk\ncrystalline Si, while the lattice thermal conductivity is reduced to a level\nwell below the amorphous limit, yielding a theoretical limit of 0.43 for ZT\ncoefficient at room temperature. This value is almost two orders of magnitude\nlarger than that for bulk Si and twice of the polycrystalline Si. Even for the\nexperimentally existing nanotwin-nanocrystalline heterostructures (e.g. grain\nsize of 5 nm), the ZT coefficient can be as high as 0.2 at room temperature,\nwhich is the highest ZT value among all the Si based bulk nanostructures so\nfar. Such substantial improvement stems from two aspects: (1) the improvement\nof the power factor is caused by the increase of Seebeck coefficient\n(degeneracy of the band valley) and the enhancement of electrical conductivity\n(the reduction of the effective band mass); (2) the significant reduction of\nthe lattice thermal conductivity is mainly caused by the extremely strong\nphonon-grain boundary and phonon-twin boundary scattering.\n", "  In this work we present and analyze a new class of coordinate representations\nof de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spacetimes for which the metrics are diagonal\nand (typically) static and axially symmetric. Contrary to the well-known forms\nof these fundamental geometries, that usually correspond to a 1+3 foliation\nwith the 3-space of a constant spatial curvature, the new metrics are adapted\nto a 2+2 foliation, and are warped products of two 2-spaces of constant\ncurvature. This new class of (anti-)de Sitter metrics depends on the value of\ncosmological constant Lambda and two discrete parameters +1,0,-1 related to the\ncurvature of the 2-spaces. The class admits 3 distinct subcases for Lambda>0\nand 8 subcases for Lambda<0. We systematically study all these possibilities.\nIn particular, we explicitly present the corresponding parametrizations of the\n(anti-)de Sitter hyperboloid, visualize the coordinate lines and surfaces\nwithin the global conformal cylinder, investigate their mutual relations,\npresent some closely related forms of the metrics, and give transformations to\nstandard de Sitter and anti-de Sitter metrics. Using these results, we also\nprovide a physical interpretation of B-metrics as exact gravitational fields of\na tachyon.\n", "  We consider the ground-state properties of Rashba spin-orbit-coupled\npseudo-spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a rotating two-dimensional\n(2D) toroidal trap. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the increasing\nrotation frequency enhances the creation of giant vortices for the initially\nmiscible BECs, while it can lead to the formation of semiring density patterns\nwith irregular hidden vortex structures for the initially immiscible BECs.\nWithout rotation, strong 2D isotropic SOC yields a heliciform-stripe phase for\nthe initially immiscible BECs. Combined effects of rotation, SOC, and\ninteratomic interactions on the vortex structures and typical spin textures of\nthe ground state of the system are discussed systematically. In particular, for\nfixed rotation frequency above the critical value, the increasing isotropic SOC\nfavors a visible vortex ring in each component which is accompanied by a hidden\ngiant vortex plus a (several) hidden vortex ring(s) in the central region. In\nthe case of 1D anisotropic SOC, large SOC strength results in the generation of\nhidden linear vortex string and the transition from initial phase separation\n(phase mixing) to phase mixing (phase separation). Furthermore, the peculiar\nspin textures including skyrmion lattice, skyrmion pair and skyrmion string are\nrevealed in this system.\n", "  Simplest examples of AdS/CFT duality correspond to free CFTs in d dimensions\nwith fields in vector or adjoint representation of an internal symmetry group\ndual in the large N limit to a theory of massless or massless plus massive\nhigher spins in AdS_{d+1}. One may also study generalizations when conformal\nfields belong to higher dimensional representations, i.e. carry more than two\ninternal symmetry indices. Here we consider the case of the 3-fundamental\n(\"3-plet\") representation. One motivation is a conjectured connection to\nmultiple M5-brane theory: heuristic arguments suggest that it may be related to\nan (interacting) CFT of 6d (2,0) tensor multiplets in 3-plet representation of\nlarge N symmetry group that has an AdS_7 dual. We compute the singlet partition\nfunction Z on S^1 x S^{d-1} for a free field in 3-plet representation of U(N)\nand analyse its novel large N behaviour. The large N limit of the low\ntemperature expansion of Z which is convergent in the vector and adjoint cases\nhere is only asymptotic, reflecting the much faster growth of the number of\nsinglet operators with dimension, indicating a phase transition at very low\ntemperature. Indeed, while the critical temperatures in the vector (T_c ~ N^a,\na >0) and adjoint (T_c ~ 1) cases are finite, we find that in the 3-plet case\nT_c ~ 1/ log N, i.e. it approaches zero at large N. We discuss some details of\nlarge N solution for the eigenvalue distribution. Similar conclusions apply to\nhigher p-plet representations of U(N) or O(N) and also to the free p-tensor\ntheories invariant under [U(N)]^p or [O(N)]^p starting with p=3.\n", "  We present interacting massive N=1 vector multiplet (VM) in nine dimensions\n(9D). Due to the identically-vanishing mass-term m(\\Bar\\lambda \\lambda ) \\equiv\n0 for (symplectic) pseudo-Majorana gaugino in 9D, we employ unconventional\ntechnique to give masses to fermions. In 9D, we consider the gauge group G for\nthe VM (A_\\mu{}^I, \\lambda^I , \\varphi^I) (I = 1, 2, \\cdots, dim G), where G is\nthe Yang-Mills gauge group, and the gaugino \\lambda^I is a pseudo-Majorana\nspinor. We break G by shifting the scalar \\varphi^I, so that the gaugino\n\\lambda^I as well as its super-partner gauge boson A_\\mu{}^I will get the same\nmass. The scalar \\varphi^I plays the role of a Nambu-Goldstone boson absorbed\ninto the longitudinal components of A_\\mu{}^I$, making the latter massive as a\nsuper-Proca-Stueckelberg mechanism. We also show that a similar method can be\nalso applied to N=2 VMs in 5D.\n", "  A search for the rare decays $B^0_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $B^0\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is\nperformed at the LHCb experiment using data collected in $pp$ collisions\ncorresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb$^{-1}$. An excess of\n$B^0_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays is observed with a significance of 7.8 standard\ndeviations, representing the first observation of this decay in a single\nexperiment. The branching fraction is measured to be ${\\cal\nB}(B^0_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)=\\left(3.0\\pm 0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\\right)\\times 10^{-9}$,\nwhere the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The first\nmeasurement of the $B^0_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ effective lifetime,\n$\\tau(B^0_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)=2.04\\pm 0.44\\pm 0.05$ ps, is reported. No significant\nexcess of $B^0\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays is found and a 95 % confidence level upper\nlimit, ${\\cal B}(B^0\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)<3.4\\times 10^{-10}$, is determined. All\nresults are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations.\n", "  Open quantum systems evolving according to discrete-time dynamics are\ncapable, unlike continuous-time counterparts, to converge to a stable\nequilibrium in finite time with zero error. We consider dissipative quantum\ncircuits consisting of sequences of quantum channels subject to specified\nquasi-locality constraints, and determine conditions under which stabilization\nof a pure multipartite entangled state of interest may be exactly achieved in\nfinite time. Special emphasis is devoted to characterizing scenarios where\nfinite-time stabilization may be achieved robustly with respect to the order of\nthe applied quantum maps, as suitable for unsupervised control architectures.\nWe show that if a decomposition of the physical Hilbert space into virtual\nsubsystems is found, which is compatible with the locality constraint and\nrelative to which the target state factorizes, then robust stabilization may be\nachieved by independently cooling each component. We further show that if the\nsame condition holds for a scalable class of pure states, a continuous-time\nquasi-local Markov semigroup ensuring rapid mixing can be obtained. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, we find that the commutativity of the canonical parent\nHamiltonian one may associate to the target state does not directly relate to\nits finite-time stabilizability properties, although in all cases where we can\nguarantee robust stabilization, a (possibly non-canonical) commuting parent\nHamiltonian may be found. Beside graph states, quantum states amenable to\nfinite-time robust stabilization include a class of universal resource states\ndisplaying two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological order, along with\ntensor network states obtained by generalizing a construction due to Bravyi and\nVyalyi. Extensions to representative classes of mixed graph-product and thermal\nstates are also discussed.\n", "  Recent measurements of the proton-proton total cross section $\\sigma_{tot}$\nat 7 and 8 TeV by the TOTEM and ATLAS Collaborations are characterized by some\ndiscrepant values: the TOTEM data suggest a rise of the cross section with the\nenergy faster than the ATLAS data. Attempting to quantify these different\nbehaviors, we develop new analytical fits to $\\sigma_{tot}$ and $\\rho$ data\nfrom $pp$ and $\\bar{p}p$ scattering in the energy region 5 GeV - 8 TeV. The\ndataset comprises all the accelerator data below 7 TeV and we consider three\nensembles by adding: either only the TOTEM data (T), or only the ATLAS data\n(A), or both sets (T+A). For the purposes, we use our previous RRPL$\\gamma$\nparametrization for $\\sigma_{tot}(s)$, consisting of two Reggeons (RR), one\ncritical Pomeron (P) and a leading log-raised-to-gamma (L$\\gamma$) contribution\n(with $\\gamma$ as a free fit parameter), analytically connected to $\\rho(s)$\nthrough singly-subtracted derivative dispersion relations and energy scale\nfixed at the physical threshold. The data reductions with ensembles T and A\npresent good agreement with the experimental data analyzed and cannot be\ndistinguished on statistical grounds. The quality of the fit is not as good\nwith ensemble T+A. The fit results provide $\\gamma \\sim 2.3 \\pm 0.1$ (T), $2.0\n\\pm 0.2$ (A), $2.1 \\pm 0.2$ (T+A), with $\\chi^2/\\mathrm{DOF} \\sim 1.07$ (T),\n$1.09$ (A), $1.14$ (T+A), suggesting extrema bounds for $\\gamma$ given by 1.8\nand 2.4. Fits with $\\gamma = 2$ (fixed) are also developed and discussed.\n", "  We study holographic RG flow solutions within four-dimensional $N=4$ gauged\nsupergravity obtained from type IIA and IIB string theories compactified on\n$T^6/\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold with gauge, geometric and\nnon-geometric fluxes. In type IIB non-geometric compactifications, the\nresulting gauged supergravity has $ISO(3)\\times ISO(3)$ gauge group and admits\nan $N=4$ $AdS_4$ vacuum dual to an $N=4$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) in\nthree dimensions. We study various supersymmetric RG flows from this $N=4$ SCFT\nto $N=4$ and $N=1$ non-conformal field theories in the IR. The flows preserving\n$N=4$ supersymmetry are driven by relevant operators of dimensions $\\Delta\n=1,2$ or alternatively by one of these relevant operators, dual to the dilaton,\nand irrelevant operators of dimensions $\\Delta=4$ while the $N=1$ flows in\naddition involve marginal deformations. Most of the flows can be obtained\nanalytically. We also give examples of supersymmetric Janus solutions\npreserving $N=4$ and $N=1$ supersymmetries. These solutions should describe\ntwo-dimensional conformal defects within the dual $N=4$ SCFT. Geometric\ncompactifications of type IIA theory give rise to $N=4$ gauged supergravity\nwith $ISO(3)\\ltimes U(1)^6$ gauge group. In this case, the resulting gauged\nsupergravity admits an $N=1$ $AdS_4$ vacuum. We also numerically study possible\n$N=1$ RG flows to non-conformal field theories in this case.\n", "  We consider a composite open quantum system consisting of a fast subsystem\ncoupled to a slow one. Using the time-scale separation, we develop an adiabatic\nelimination technique to derive at any order the reduced model describing the\nslow subsystem. The method, based on an asymptotic expansion and geometric\nsingular perturbation theory, ensures the physical interpretation of the\nreduced second-order model by giving the reduced dynamics in a Lindblad form\nand the state reduction in Kraus map form. We give explicit second-order\nformulas for Hamiltonian or cascade coupling between the two subsystems. These\nformulas can be used to engineer, via a careful choice of the fast subsystem,\nthe Hamiltonian and Lindbald operators governing the dissipative dynamics of\nthe slow subsystem.\n", "  Cosmic rays hitting the solar atmosphere generate neutrinos that interact and\noscillate in the Sun and oscillate on the way to Earth. These neutrinos could\npotentially be detected with neutrino telescopes and will be a background for\nsearches for neutrinos from dark matter annihilation in the Sun. We calculate\nthe flux of neutrinos from these cosmic ray interactions in the Sun and also\ninvestigate the interactions near a detector on Earth that give rise to muons.\nWe compare this background with both regular Earth-atmospheric neutrinos and\nsignals from dark matter annihilation in the Sun. Our calculation is performed\nwith an event-based Monte Carlo approach that should be suitable as a\nsimulation tool for experimental collaborations. Our program package is\nreleased publicly along with this paper.\n", "  We construct an effective field theory, a two-dimensional two-component\nmetallic system described by a model with two Fermi surfaces (\"pockets\"). This\nmodel describes a translationally invariant metallic system with two types of\nfermions, each with its own Fermi surface, with forward scattering\ninteractions. This model, in addition to the $O(2)$ rotational invariance, has\na $U(1) \\times U(1)$ symmetry of separate charge conservation for each Fermi\nsurface. For sufficiently attractive interactions in the $d$-wave (quadrupolar)\nchannel this model has an interesting phase diagram that includes a\nspontaneously generated anomalous Hall metal phase. We derive the\nLandau-Ginzburg effective action of quadrupolar order parameter fields which\nenjoys an $O(2)\\times U(1)$ global symmetry associated to spatial isotropy and\nthe internal $U(1)$ relative phase symmetries respectively. We show that the\norder parameter theory is dynamically local with a dynamical scaling of $z=2$\nand perform a one-loop renormalization group analysis of the Landau-Ginzburg\ntheory. The electronic liquid crystal phases that result from spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking are studied and we show the presence of Landau damped\nNambu-Goldstone modes at low momenta that is a signature of non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior. Electromagnetic linear response is also analyzed in both the normal\nand symmetry broken phases from the point of view of the order parameter\ntheory. The nature of the coupling of electromagnetism to the order parameter\nfields in the normal phase is non-minimal and decidedly contains a precursor to\nthe anomalous Hall response in the form of a order-parameter-dependent\nChern-Simons term in the effective action.\n", "  BaBiO$_3$ is a mixed-valence perovskite which escapes the metallic state\nthrough a Bi valence (and Bi-O bond) disproportionation or CDW distortion,\nresulting in a semiconductor with a gap of 0.8 eV at zero pressure. The\nevolution of structural and electronic properties at high pressure is, however,\nlargely unknown. Pressure, one might have hoped, could reduce the\ndisproportionation, making the two Bi ions equivalent and bringing the system\ncloser to metallicity or even to superconductivity, such as is attained at\nambient pressure upon metal doping. We address the high-pressure phase diagram\nof pristine BaBiO$_3$ by ab initio DFT calculations based on GGA and hybrid\nfunctionals in combination with crystal structure prediction methods based on\nevolutionary algorithms, molecular dynamics and metadynamics. The calculated\nphase diagram from 0 to 50 GPa indicates that pristine BaBiO$_3$ resists\nmetallization under pressure, undergoing instead at room temperature structural\nphase transitions from monoclinic \\textit{I2/m} to nearly tetragonal\n\\textit{P-1} at 7 GPa, possibly to monoclinic \\textit{C2/m} at 27 GPa, and to\ntriclinic \\textit{P1} at 43 GPa. Remarkably, all these phases sustain and in\nfact increase the inequivalence of two Bi neighboring sites and of their Bi-O\nbonds and, in all cases except semimetallic \\textit{C2/m}, the associated\ninsulating character. We then present high-pressure resistivity data which\ngenerally corroborate these results, and show that the insulating character\npersists at least up to 80 GPa, suggesting that the \\textit{C2/m} phase is\nprobably an artifact of the small computational cell.\n", "  We report detailed neutron scattering studies on Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$. The\ncompound consists of two interpenetrating sublattices of Cu, labeled as\nCu$_{\\rm A}$ and Cu$_{\\rm B}$, each of which forms a square-lattice Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet. The two sublattices order at different temperatures and\neffective exchange couplings within the sublattices differ by an order of\nmagnitude. This yields an inelastic neutron spectrum of the Cu$_{\\rm A}$\nsublattice extending up to 300 meV and a much weaker dispersion of Cu$_{\\rm B}$\ngoing up to around 20 meV. Using a single-band Hubbard model we derive an\neffective spin Hamiltonian. From this, we find that linear spin-wave theory\ngives a good description to the magnetic spectrum. In addition, a magnetic\nfield of 10 T is found to produce effects on the Cu$_{\\rm B}$ dispersion that\ncannot be explained by conventional spin-wave theory.\n", "  We show that the maximal extension sl(2) times psl(2|2) times C3 of the\nsl(2|2) superalgebra can be obtained as a contraction limit of the semi-simple\nsuperalgebra d(2,1;epsilon) times sl(2). We reproduce earlier results on the\ncorresponding q-deformed Hopf algebra and its universal R-matrix by means of\ncontraction. We make the curious observation that the above algebra is related\nto kappa-Poincar\\'e symmetry. When dropping the graded part psl(2|2) we find a\nnovel one-parameter deformation of the 3D kappa-Poincar\\'e algebra. Our\nconstruction also provides a concise exact expression for its universal\nR-matrix.\n", "  We study simultaneous collisions of two, three, and four kinks and antikinks\nof the $\\phi^6$ model at the same spatial point. Unlike the $\\phi^4$ kinks, the\n$\\phi^6$ kinks are asymmetric and this enriches the variety of the collision\nscenarios. In our numerical simulations we observe both reflection and bound\nstate formation depending on the number of kinks and on their spatial ordering\nin the initial configuration. We also analyze the extreme values of the energy\ndensities and the field gradient observed during the collisions. Our results\nsuggest that very high energy densities can be produced in multi-kink\ncollisions in a controllable manner. Appearance of high energy density spots in\nmulti-kink collisions can be important in various physical applications of the\nKlein-Gordon model.\n", "  We study the superradiant instability of massive vector fields, i.e. Proca\nfields, around spinning black holes in the test field limit. This is motivated\nby the possibility that observations of astrophysical black holes can probe the\nexistence of ultralight bosons subject to this mechanism. By making use of\ntime-domain simulations, we characterize the growth rate, frequency, spatial\ndistribution, and other properties of the unstable modes, including in the\nregime where the black hole is rapidly spinning and the Compton wavelength of\nthe Proca field is comparable to the black hole radius. We find that\nrelativistic effects in this regime increase the range of Proca masses that are\nunstable, as well as the maximum instability rate. We also study the\ngravitational waves that can be sourced by such an instability, finding that\nthey can be significantly stronger than in the massive scalar field case.\n", "  Mass spectrum of localized states (elementary particles) of single quantum\nsystem is studied in the framework of Heisenberg's scheme. Localized states are\nunderstood as cyclic representations of a group of fundamental symmetry\n(Lorentz group) within a Gelfand-Neumark-Segal construction. It is shown that\nstate masses of lepton (except the neutrino) and hadron sectors of matter\nspectrum are proportional to the rest mass of electron with an accuracy of\n$0,41\\%$.\n", "  We seek to quantify the relative contributions of Lorentz forces and\naerodynamic drag on the propagation of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We\nuse Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model fits to a representative set of 38\nCMEs observed with the SOHO and STEREO spacecraft. We find that the Lorentz\nforces generally peak between 1.65 and 2.45 Rsun for all CMEs. For fast CMEs,\nLorentz forces become negligible in comparison to aerodynamic drag as early as\n3.5--4 Rsun. For slow CMEs, however, they become negligible only by 12--50\nRsun. For these slow events, our results suggest that some of the magnetic flux\nmight be expended in CME expansion or heating. In other words, not all of it\ncontributes to directed propagation. Our results are expected to be important\nin building a physical model for understanding the Sun-Earth dynamics of CMEs.\n", "  The integration of advanced optoelectronic properties in nanoscale devices of\ngroup III nitride can be realized by understanding the coupling of charge\ncarriers with optical excitations in these nanostructures. The native defect\ninduced electron-phonon coupling in GaN nanowires are reported using various\nspectroscopic studies. The GaN nanowires having different native defects are\ngrown in atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition technique. X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopic analysis revealed the variation of Ga/N ratios in\nnanowires having possible native defects, with respect to their growth\nparameters. The analysis of characteristics features of electron-phonon\ncoupling in Raman spectra show the variations in carrier density and mobility\nwith respect to the native defects in unintentionally doped GaN nanowires. The\nradiative recombination of donor acceptor pair transitions and the\ncorresponding LO phonon replicas observed in photoluminescence studies further\nemphasize the role of native defects in electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  A model of memristor-based Chuas oscillator is studied. The considered system\nhas infinitely many equilibrium points, which build a line of equilibria.\nBifurcational mechanisms of oscillation excitation are explored for different\nforms of nonlinearity. Hard and soft excitation scenarios have principally\ndifferent nature. The hard excitation is determined by the memristor\npiecewise-smooth characteristic and is a result of a border-collision\nbifurcation. The soft excitation is caused by addition of a smooth nonlinear\nfunction and has distinctive features of the supercritical Andronov-Hopf\nbifurcation. Mechanisms of instability and amplitude limitation are described\nfor both two cases. Numerical modelling and theoretical analysis are combined\nwith experiments on an electronic analog model of the system under study. The\nissues concerning physical realization of the dynamics of systems with a line\nof equilibria are considered. The question on whether oscillations in such\nsystems can be classified as the self-sustained oscillations is raised.\n", "  Around 50 years ago, Doniach [Proc. Phys. Soc. 91, 86 (1967)] predicted the\nexistence of paramagnons in nearly ferromagnetic materials, recently measured\nin bulk Pd [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 027207 (2010)]. Here we predict the analogous\neffect for single adatoms, namely paramagnetic spin-excitations (PSE). Based on\ntime-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that these overdamped\nexcitations acquire a well-defined peak structure in the meV energy region when\nthe adatom's Stoner criterion for magnetism is close to the critical point. In\naddition, our calculations reveal a subtle tunability and enhancement of PSE by\nexternal magnetic fields, exceeding by far the response of bulk paramagnons and\neven featuring the atomic version of a quantum phase transition. We further\ndemonstrate how PSE can be detected as moving steps in the $\\mathrm{d}I/dV$\nsignal of state-of-the-art inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy, opening a\npotential route for experimentally accessing fundamental electronic properties\nof non-magnetic adatoms, such as the Stoner parameter.\n", "  We present new Effelsberg-100 m, ATCA, and VLA observations of rotational SiS\ntransitions in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of IRC +10216. Thanks to the\nhigh angular resolution achieved by the ATCA observations, we unambiguously\nconfirm that the molecule's J=1-0 transition exhibits maser action in this CSE,\nas first suggested more than thirty years ago. The maser emission's radial\nvelocity peaking at a local standard of rest velocity of -39.862$\\pm$0.065 km/s\nindicates that it arises from an almost fully accelerated shell. Monitoring\nobservations show time variability of the SiS (1-0) maser. The two lowest-$J$\nSiS quasi-thermal emission lines trace a much more extended emitting region\nthan previous high-J SiS observations. Their distributions show that the SiS\nquasi-thermal emission consists of two components: one is very compact\n(radius<1.5\", corresponding to <3$\\times 10^{15}$ cm), and the other extends\nout to a radius >11\". An incomplete shell-like structure is found in the\nnorth-east, which is indicative of existing SiS shells. Clumpy structures are\nalso revealed in this CSE. The gain of the SiS (1-0) maser (optical depths of\nabout -5 at the blue-shifted side and, assuming inversion throughout the entire\nline's velocity range, about -2 at the red-shifted side) suggests that it is\nunsaturated. The SiS (1-0) maser can be explained in terms of ro-vibrational\nexcitation caused by infrared pumping, and we propose that infrared continuum\nemission is the main pumping source.\n", "  We show that the space of observables of test particles carries a natural\nJacobi structure which is manifestly invariant under the action of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group. Poisson algebras may be obtained by imposing further\nrequirements. A generalization of Peierls procedure is used to extend this\nJacobi bracket on the space of time-like geodesics on Minkowski space-time.\n", "  Nonlinear propagation of intense femtosecond laser pulses in bulk transparent\nmedia leads to a specific propagation regime, termed femtosecond filamentation,\nwhich in turn produces dramatic spectral broadening, or superbroadening, termed\nsupercontinuum generation. Femtosecond supercontinuum generation in transparent\nsolids represents a compact, efficient and alignment-insensitive technique for\ngeneration of coherent broadband radiation at various parts of the optical\nspectrum, which finds numerous applications in diverse fields of modern\nultrafast science. During recent years, this research field has reached a high\nlevel of maturity, both in understanding of the underlying physics and in\nachievement of exciting practical results. In this paper we overview the state\nof the art of femtosecond supercontinuum generation in various transparent\nsolid-state media, ranging from wide-bandgap dielectrics to semiconductor\nmaterials and in various parts of the optical spectrum, from the ultraviolet to\nthe mid-infrared. A particular emphasis is given to the most recent\nexperimental developments: multioctave supercontinuum generation with pumping\nin the mid-infrared spectral range, spectral control, power and energy scaling\nof broadband radiation and the development of simple, flexible and robust pulse\ncompression techniques, which deliver few optical cycle pulses and which could\nbe readily implemented in a variety of modern ultrafast laser systems.\n", "  A selection of astrometric catalogues are presented in three tables for\nrespectively positions, proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes. The tables\ncontain characteristics of each catalogue showing the evolution in optical\nastrometry, in fact the evolution during the past 2000 years for positions. The\nnumber of stars and the accuracy are summarized by the weight of a catalogue,\nproportional with the number of stars and the statistical weight. The present\nreport originally from 2008 was revised in 2017 with much new information about\nthe accuracy of catalogues before 1800 AD. For the ongoing Gaia mission the\nwebsite and H{\\o}g (2017) may be consulted.\n", "  The Transition Radiation Detector of the AMS-02 experiment on the\nInternational Space Station is used for the separation of cosmic-ray positrons\nand electrons from protons and anti-protons, and for the identification of\nnuclei up to carbon (Z<=6). We present the Geant4 simulation that is used to\ndescribe the ionization and transition radiation processes and compare its\nresults to flight data from AMS-02. After applying empirical corrections to the\nsimulated data, the particle energy deposition and likelihood distributions in\nthe TRD are described with high accuracy.\n", "  The Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) are key tools in Monte Carlo\nsimulations. More recently, the MIXMAX PRNG has been included in ROOT and Class\nLibrary for High Energy Physics (CLHEP) software packages and claims to be a\nstate of art generator due to its long period, high performance and good\nstatistical properties. In this paper the various statistical tests for MIXMAX\nare performed. The results compared with those obtained from other PRNGs, e.g.\nMersenne Twister, Ranlux, LCG reveal better qualities for MIXMAX in generating\nrandom numbers. The Mersenne Twister is by far the most widely used PRNG in\nmany software packages including packages in High Energy Physics (HEP), however\nthe results show that MIXMAX is not inferior to Mersenne Twister.\n", "  The study of random networks in a neuroscientific context has developed\nextensively over the last couple of decades. By contrast, techniques for the\nstatistical analysis of these networks are less developed. In this paper, we\nfocus on the statistical comparison of brain networks in a nonparametric\nframework and discuss the associated detection and identification problems. We\ntested network differences between groups with an analysis of variance (ANOVA)\ntest we developed specifically for networks. We also propose and analyse the\nbehaviour of a new statistical procedure designed to identify different\nsubnetworks. As an example, we show the application of this tool in\nresting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human Connectome Project. Finally, we\ndiscuss the potential bias in neuroimaging findings that is generated by some\nbehavioural and brain structure variables. Our method can also be applied to\nother kind of networks such as protein interaction networks, gene networks or\nsocial networks.\n", "  We use the relativistic perfect-fluid hydrodynamics to describe the\nspace-time evolution of dense baryonic matter produced in the central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at HIRFL-CSR, HIAF, FAIR-CBM, NICA-MPD, and\nRHIC-BES. The transverse flow of the fireball with cylindrical symmetry and\nboost invariant along the longitudinal direction is also analyzed. Based on the\nrelativistic kinetic theory, we also present the first preliminary calculation\non the production of low-mass dileptons and low-pT photons can be considered as\nthe signals of the dense baryonic matter produced in the central Au-Au and U-U\ncollisions. We find that the rapid cooling of the expanding dense baryonic\nmatter with transverse flow effect can lead to the suppression of the low-mass\ndileptons and low-pT photons production at HIRFL-CSR, HIAF, FAIR-CBM, NICA-MPD,\nand RHIC-BES energies.\n", "  We examine microstructural and mechanical changes which occur during\noscillatory shear flow and reformation after flow cessation of an intermediate\nvolume fraction colloidal gel using rheometry and Brownian Dynamics (BD)\nsimulations. A model depletion colloid-polymer mixture is used, comprising of a\nhard sphere colloidal suspension with the addition of non-adsorbing linear\npolymer chains. Results reveal three distinct regimes depending on the strain\namplitude of oscillatory shear. Large shear strain amplitudes fully break the\nstructure which results into a more homogenous and stronger gel after flow\ncessation. Intermediate strain amplitudes densify the clusters and lead to\nhighly heterogeneous and weak gels. Shearing the gel to even lower strain\namplitudes creates a less heterogonous stronger solid. These three regimes of\nshearing are connected to the microscopic shear-induced structural\nheterogeneity. A comparison with steady shear flow reveals that the latter does\nnot produce structural heterogeneities as large as oscillatory shear. Therefore\noscillatory shear is a much more efficient way of tuning the mechanical\nproperties of colloidal gels. Moreover, colloidal gels presheared at large\nstrain amplitudes exhibit a distinct nonlinear response characterized largely\nby a single yielding process while in those presheared at lower rates a two\nstep yield process is promoted due to the creation of highly heterogeneous\nstructures.\n", "  We identify six new CEMP stars ([C/Fe]>+0.7 and [Fe/H]< -1.8) and another\nseven likely candidates within the APOGEE database following Data Release 12.\nThese stars have chemical compositions typical of metal-poor halo stars, e.g.,\nmean [$\\alpha$/Fe] = +0.24$\\pm$0.24, based on the ASPCAP pipeline results. A\nlack of heavy element spectral lines impedes further sub-classification of\nthese CEMP stars, however, based on radial velocity scatter, we predict most\nare not CEMP-s stars which are typically found in binary systems. Only one\nobject, 2M15312547+4220551, may be in a binary since it exhibits a scatter in\nits radial velocity of 1.7 $\\pm$0.6 km s$^{-1}$ based on three visits over a\n25.98 day baseline. Optical observations are now necessary to confirm the\nstellar parameters and low metallicities of these stars, to determine the\nheavy-element abundance ratios and improve the precision in the derived\nabundances, and to examine their CEMP sub-classifications.\n", "  Integrated quantum photonic applications, providing physially guaranteed\ncommunications security, sub-shot-noise measurement, and tremendous\ncomputational power, are nearly within technological reach. Silicon as a\ntechnology platform has proven formibable in establishing the micro-electornics\nrevoltution, and it might do so again in the quantum technology revolution.\nSilicon has has taken photonics by storm, with its promise of scalable\nmanufacture, integration, and compatibility with CMOS microelectronics. These\nsame properties, and a few others, motivate its use for large-scale quantum\noptics as well. In this article we provide context to the development of\nquantum optics in silicon. We review the development of the various components\nwhich constitute integrated quantum photonic systems, and we identify the\nchallenges which must be faced and their potential solutions for silicon\nquantum photonics to make quantum technology a reality.\n", "  It is known from the wave-like motion of microtubules in motility assays that\nthe piconewton forces that motors produce can be sufficient to bend the\nfilaments. In cellular phenomena such as cytosplasmic streaming, molecular\nmotors translocate along cytoskeletal filaments, carrying cargo which entrains\nfluid. When large numbers of such forced filaments interact through the\nsurrounding fluid, as in particular stages of oocyte development in\n$Drosophila~melanogaster$, complex dynamics are observed, but the detailed\nmechanics underlying them has remained unclear. Motivated by these\nobservations, we study here perhaps the simplest model for these phenomena: an\nelastic filament, pinned at one end, acted on by a molecular motor treated as a\npoint force. Because the force acts tangential to the filament, no matter what\nits shape, this \"follower-force\" problem is intrinsically non-variational, and\nthereby differs fundamentally from Euler buckling, where the force has a fixed\ndirection, and which, in the low Reynolds number regime, ultimately leads to a\nstationary, energy-minimizing shape. Through a combination of linear stability\ntheory, analytical study of a solvable simplified \"two-link\" model, and\nnumerical studies of the full elastohydrodynamic equations of motion we\nelucidate the Hopf bifurcation that occurs with increasing forcing of a\nfilament, leading to flapping motion analogous to the high Reynolds number\noscillations of a garden hose with a free end.\n", "  The first two parts of this article surveys results related to the\nheat-kernel coherent states for a compact Lie group K. I begin by reviewing the\ndefinition of the coherent states, their resolution of the identity, and the\nassociated Segal-Bargmann transform. I then describe related results including\nconnections to geometric quantization and (1+1)-dimensional Yang--Mills theory,\nthe associated coherent states on spheres, and applications to quantum gravity.\n  The third part of this article summarizes recent work of mine with Driver and\nKemp on the large-N limit of the Segal--Bargmann transform for the unitary\ngroup U(N). A key result is the identification of the leading-order large-N\nbehavior of the Laplacian on \"trace polynomials.\"\n", "  Laser powered dielectric structures achieve high-gradient particle\nacceleration by taking advantage of modern laser technology capable of\nproducing electric fields in excess of 10GV/m. These fields can drive the bulk\ndielectric beyond its linear response, and break the phase synchronicity\nbetween the accelerating field and the electrons. We show how control of the\npulse dispersion can be used to compensate the effect of self-phase modulation\nand maximize the energy gain in the laser accelerator.In our experiment, a high\nbrightness 8MeV e-beam is used to probe accelerating fields of 1.8GV/m in a\n'grating-reset' dielectric structure illuminated by a 45fs laser pulse with a\nfluence of 0.7J/cm$^2$.\n", "  I provide an alternative characterization of a \"standard of rotation\" in the\ncontext of classical spacetime structure that does not refer to any covariant\nderivative operator.\n", "  Key aspects of the manifestly-covariant theory of quantum gravity\n(Cremaschini and Tessarotto 2015-2017) are investigated. These refer, first, to\nthe establishment of the 4-scalar, manifestly-covariant evolution quantum wave\nequation, denoted as covariant quantum gravity (CQG) wave equation, which\nadvances the quantum state $\\psi $ associated with a prescribed background\nspace-time. In this paper, the CQG-wave equation is proved to follow at once by\nmeans of a Hamilton-Jacobi quantization of the classical variational tensor\nfield $g\\equiv \\left\\{ g_{\\mu \\nu }\\right\\} $ and its conjugate momentum,\nreferred to as (canonical) $g-$quantization. The same equation is also shown to\nbe variational and to follow from a synchronous variational principle\nidentified here with the quantum Hamilton variational principle. The\ncorresponding quantum hydrodynamic equations are then obtained upon introducing\nthe Madelung representation for $\\psi $, which provide an equivalent\nstatistical interpretation of the CQG-wave equation. Finally, the quantum state\n$\\psi $ is proved to fulfill generalized Heisenberg inequalities, relating the\nstatistical measurement errors of quantum observables. These are shown to be\nrepresented in terms of the standard deviations of the matric tensor $g\\equiv\n\\left\\{ g_{\\mu \\nu }\\right\\} $ and its quantum conjugate momentum operator.\n", "  We show that the operators and the quadrupole and Zeeman Hamiltonians for a\nspin (3/2) can be represented in terms for a system of two coupling fictitious\nspins (1/2) using the Kronecker product of Pauli matrices. Particularly, the\nquadrupole Hamiltonian which describes the interaction of the nuclear\nquadrupole moment with an electric field gradient is represented as the\nHamiltonian of Ising model in a transverse selective magnetic field. The Zeeman\nHamiltonian, which describes interaction of the nuclear spin with the external\nmagnetic field, can be considered as the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg model in\na selective magnetic field. The total Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the\nHamiltonian of 3D Heisenberg model in an inhomogeneous magnetic field applied\nalong the x-axis. The representation of a single spin (3/2) as two-spin (1/2)\nsystem allows us to study entanglement in the spin system. One of the features\nof the fictitious spin system is that, in both the pure and the mixed states,\nthe concurrence tends to 0.5 with increase of applied magnetic field. The\nrepresentation of a spin (3/2) as a system of two coupling fictitious spins\n(1/2) and possibility of formation of the entangled states in this system open\na way to the application of a single spin (3/2) in quantum computation.\n", "  Bulk single crystal Molybdenum diselenide has been studied for its electronic\nand thermal transport properties. We perform resistivity measurements with\ncurrent in-plane (CIP) and current perpendicular to plane (CPP) as a function\nof temperature. The CIP measurements exhibit metal to semiconductor transition\nat $\\simeq 31$ K. In the semiconducting phase ($T > 31$ K), the transport is\nbest explained by variable range hopping (VRH) model. Large magnitude of\nresistivity in CPP mode indicates strong structural anisotropy. Seebeck\ncoefficient as a function of temperature measured in the range $90 - 300$ K,\nalso agrees well with the VRH model. The room temperature Seebeck coefficient\nis found to be $139$ $\\mu$V/K. VRH fittings of the resistivity and Seebeck\ncoefficient data indicate high degree of localization.\n", "  The classical disturbing function of the three-body problem is based on an\nexpansion of the gravitational interaction in the vicinity of nearly coplanar\norbits. Consequently, it is not suitable for the identification and study of\nresonances of the Centaurs and transneptunian objects on nearly polar orbits\nwith the solar system planets. Here, we provide a series expansion algorithm of\nthe gravitational interaction in the vicinity of polar orbits and produce\nexplicitly the disturbing function to fourth order in eccentricity and\ninclination cosine. The properties of the polar series differ significantly\nfrom those of the classical disturbing function: the polar series can model any\nresonance as the expansion order is not related to the resonance order. The\npowers of eccentricity and inclination of the force amplitude of a $p$:$q$\nresonance do not depend on the value of the resonance order $|p-q|$ but only on\nits parity. Thus all even resonance order eccentricity amplitudes are $\\propto\ne^2$ and odd ones $\\propto e$ to lowest order in eccentricity $e$. With the new\nfindings on the structure of the polar disturbing function and the possible\nresonant critical arguments, we illustrate the dynamics of the polar resonances\n1:3, 3:1, 2:9 and 7:9 where transneptunian object 471325 could currently be\nlocked.\n", "  A massive galaxy cluster can serve as a magnifying glass for distant stellar\npopulations, with strong gravitational lensing exposing details in the lensed\nbackground galaxies that would otherwise be undetectable. The MACS J0416.1-2403\ncluster (hereafter MACS0416) is one of the most efficient lenses in the sky,\nand in 2014 it was observed with high-cadence imaging from the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). Here we describe two unusual transient events that appeared\nbehind MACS0416 in a strongly lensed galaxy at redshift $z = 1.0054 \\pm\n0.0002$. These transients---designated HFF14Spo-NW and HFF14Spo-SE and\ncollectively nicknamed \"Spock\"---were faster and fainter than any supernova\n(SN), but significantly more luminous than a classical nova. They reached peak\nluminosities of $\\sim10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_{\\rm AB} < -14$ mag) in 5\nrest-frame days, then faded below detectability in roughly the same time span.\nModels of the cluster lens suggest that these events may be spatially\ncoincident at the source plane, but are most likely not temporally coincident.\nWe find that HFF14Spo can be explained as a luminous blue variable (LBV), a\nrecurrent nova (RN), or a pair of stellar microlensing events. To distinguish\nbetween these hypotheses will require a clarification of the positions of\nnearby critical curves, along with high-cadence monitoring of the field that\ncould detect new transient episodes in the host galaxy.\n", "  The existence of new electro-acoustic (EA) waves [named here `degenerate\npressure driven EA' (DPDEA) waves] propagating in a degenerate quantum plasma\n(DQP) system [containing non-inertial, cold, non-relativistically\n(NR)/ultra-relativistically (UR) degenerate electron species (DES), and\ninertial, cold, NR degenerate positive particle species (PPS)] is predicted for\nthe first time. The DPDEA waves, in which the inertia is mainly provided by the\nmass density of the inertial PPS, and the restoring force is mainly provided by\nthe non-inertial, NR/UR DES, are new since they are completely disappeared if\nthe degenerate pressure of the plasma particle species is neglected. The\ndispersion relation (derived here for the first time) is applied in a white\ndwarf DQP system to show the dispersion properties of the new DPDEA waves.\n", "  We report an ultra-bright lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at $z=2.0439$,\n{\\it WISE} J132934.18+224327.3, identified as a result of a full-sky\ncross-correlation of the {\\it AllWISE} and {\\it Planck} compact source catalogs\naimed to search for bright analogs of the submillimeter galaxy SMMJ2135, the\nCosmic Eyelash. Inspection of archival SCUBA-2 observations of the candidates\nrevealed a source with fluxes (S$_{850 \\mu m}$= 130 mJy) consistent with the\n{\\it Planck} measurements. The centroid of the SCUBA-2 source coincides within\n1 arcsec with the position of the {\\it AllWISE} mid-IR source, and, remarkably,\nwith an arc shaped lensed galaxy in {\\it HST} images at visible wavelengths.\nLow-resolution rest-frame UV-optical spectroscopy of this lensed galaxy\nobtained with 10.4 m GTC reveals the typical absorption lines of a starburst\ngalaxy. Gemini-N near-IR spectroscopy provided a clear detection of\nH$_{\\alpha}$ emission. The lensed source appears to be gravitationally\nmagnified by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens at $z = 0.44$, modeling\nwith Lenstool indicates a lensing amplification factor of $11\\pm 2$. We\ndetermine an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000-$\\mu$m luminosity, $L_{\\rm IR}$, of\n$(1.3 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{13}$ $L_\\sun$, and a likely star-formation rate (SFR)\nof $\\sim 500-2000$ $M_\\sun yr^{-1}$. The SED shows a remarkable similarity with\nthe Cosmic Eyelash from optical-mid/IR to sub-millimeter/radio, albeit at\nhigher fluxes.\n", "  We present an analysis of the apparent elongation motion of flare ribbons\nalong the polarity inversion line (PIL) as well as the shear of flare loops in\nseveral two-ribbon flares. Flare ribbons and loops spread along the PIL at a\nspeed ranging from a few to a hundred km/s. The shear measured from conjugate\nfoot-points is consistent with the measurement from flare loops, and both show\nthe decrease of shear toward a potential field as a flare evolves and ribbons\nand loops spread along the PIL. Flares exhibiting fast bi-directional\nelongation appear to have a strong shear, which may indicate a large magnetic\nguide field relative to the reconnection field in the coronal current sheet. We\ndiscuss how the analysis of ribbon motion could help infer properties in the\ncorona where reconnection takes place.\n", "  We report observations of a two-stage coronal dimming in an eruptive event of\na two-ribbon flare and a fast coronal mass ejection (CME). Weak gradual dimming\npersists for more than half an hour before the onset of the two-ribbon flare\nand the fast rise of the CME. It is followed by abrupt rapid dimming. The\ntwo-stage dimming occurs in a pair of conjugate dimming regions adjacent to the\ntwo flare ribbons, and the flare onset marks the transition between the two\nstages of dimming. At the onset of the two-ribbon flare, transient brightenings\nare also observed inside the dimming regions, before rapid dimming occurs at\nthe same places. These observations suggest that the CME structure, most\nprobably anchored at the twin dimming regions, undergoes a slow rise before the\nflare onset, and its kinematic evolution has significantly changed at the onset\nof flare reconnection. We explore diagnostics of the CME evolution in the early\nphase with analysis of the gradual dimming signatures prior to the CME\neruption.\n", "  A major feature of the energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation above\n10$^{19}$ eV is the increasing fraction of heavy nuclei with respect to light\nnuclei. This fact, along with other simple assumptions, is adopted to calculate\nthe energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation up to 2.4$\\times$10$^{21}$ eV. The\npredicted spectrum maintains the index of 2.67 observed at lower energies which\nis the basic, known, empirical well-assessed feature of the physical mechanism\naccelerating cosmic rays in the Galaxy. Indeed above 10$^{19}$ eV the injection\nof nuclei is inhibited by some filter and this inhibition causes a staircase\nprofile of the energy spectrum. It is argued that particle injection failure\nversus energy commences with protons, followed by Helium and then by other\nheavier nuclei up to Uranium. Around 7.5$\\times$10$^{20}$ the cosmic radiation\nconsists solely of nuclei heavier than Copper and the estimated intensity is\n1.8$\\times$10$^{-30}$ particles/GeV s sr m$^2$.\n", "  Density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are\napplied to investigate the migration of Mn(II) ions to above-surface sites on\nspinel Li(x)Mn(2)O(4) (001) surfaces, the subsequent Mn dissolution into the\norganic liquid electrolyte, and the detrimental effects on graphite anode solid\nelectrolyte interphase (SEI) passivating films after Mn(II) ions diffuse\nthrough the separator. The dissolution mechanism proves complex, the\nmuch-quoted Hunter disproportionation of Mn(III) to form Mn(II) is far from\nsufficient. Key steps that facilitate Mn(II) loss include concerted\nliquid/solid-state motions, proton-induced weakening of Mn-O bonds forming\nmobile OH- surface groups, and chemical reactions of adsorbed decomposed\norganic fragments. Mn(II) lodged between the inorganic Li(2)CO(3) and organic\nlithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) anode SEI components facilitates\nelectrochemical reduction and decomposition of LEDC. These findings help inform\nfuture design of protective coatings, electrolytes, additives, and interfaces.\n", "  In this paper, we discover and proved that the $0$ to $R_1$ cylinder radial\ncoordinate transformation can not be used to make cylinder layer\nelectromagnetic EM cloak. Because in the $0$ to $R_1$ cylinder radial\ncoordinate transformation, the value area of the electric wave field $E_z\n(\\rho,\\phi,z)$ and magnetic wave field $H_z (\\rho,\\phi,z)$ are invariant. After\n$0$ to $R_1$ cylinder radial transformation,$\\rho _q = R_1 + Q(\\rho)$, $E_z\n(\\rho _q,\\phi,z) = E_z (\\rho,\\phi,z)$,$H_z (\\rho _q,\\phi,z) = H_z\n(\\rho,\\phi,z)$ . in the physical inner cylinder boundary, $E_z (R_1,\\phi,z) \\ne\n0$,$H_z (R_1,\\phi,z) \\ne 0$, The cylinder EM wave field will propagation\npenetrate into the inner cylinder $\\rho < R_1,\\left| z \\right| < \\infty $\n.Therefore, the inner cylinder $\\rho < R_1,\\left| z \\right| < \\infty $ . can\nnot be cloaked. In many published papers on EM cylinder cloak, the $0$ to $R_1$\ncylinder radial transformation is wrongfully used for their EM cylinder layer\ncloak.\n", "  A foundation of the modern technology that uses single-crystal silicon has\nbeen the growth of high-quality single-crystal Si ingots with diameters up to\n12 inches or larger. For many applications of graphene, large-area high-quality\n(ideally of single-crystal) material will be enabling. Since the first growth\non copper foil a decade ago, inch-sized single-crystal graphene has been\nachieved. We present here the growth, in 20 minutes, of a graphene film of 5 x\n50 cm2 dimension with > 99% ultra-highly oriented grains. This growth was\nachieved by: (i) synthesis of sub-metre-sized single-crystal Cu(111) foil as\nsubstrate; (ii) epitaxial growth of graphene islands on the Cu(111) surface;\n(iii) seamless merging of such graphene islands into a graphene film with high\nsingle crystallinity and (iv) the ultrafast growth of graphene film. These\nachievements were realized by a temperature-driven annealing technique to\nproduce single-crystal Cu(111) from industrial polycrystalline Cu foil and the\nmarvellous effects of a continuous oxygen supply from an adjacent oxide. The\nas-synthesized graphene film, with very few misoriented grains (if any), has a\nmobility up to ~ 23,000 cm2V-1s-1 at 4 K and room temperature sheet resistance\nof ~ 230 ohm/square. It is very likely that this approach can be scaled up to\nachieve exceptionally large and high-quality graphene films with single\ncrystallinity, and thus realize various industrial-level applications at a low\ncost.\n", "  We consider optimal state discrimination in a general convex operational\nframework, so-called generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), and present a\ngeneral method of optimal discrimination by applying the complementarity\nproblem from convex optimization. The method exploits the convex geometry of\nstates but not other detailed conditions or relations of states and effects. We\nalso show that properties in optimal quantum state discrimination are shared in\nGPTs in general: i) no measurement sometimes gives optimal discrimination, and\nii) optimal measurement is not unique.\n", "  We present a set of new quantitative classification criteria for major\nsubclasses of Type I Supernovae (SNe). We analyze peak spectra of 146 SNe Ia\nfrom the Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP), 12 SNe Ib, 19 SNe Ic (including\n5 SNe Ic-BL) and 4 SNe Ib/c. All the spectra are within 5 days of maximum\nlight. We study their absorption line depths relative to the pseudo-continuum\nat around observed wavelength 6150{\\AA}, attributed to Si II 6355{\\AA} for SNe\nIa and Ic and to hydrogen for SNe Ib, and O I $\\lambda 7774$\\AA\\ observed\naround $\\lambda 7500$\\AA. We found that Type I SNe could be quantitatively\nclassified using the line depths at these two absorption regions. Type Ia SNe,\nincluding normal SNe Ia, Ia-1991bg and Ia-1999aa, show strong signatures of Si\nII near peak with relative line depth values of $a{\\rm (\\lambda6150\\AA)>0.35}$.\nOnly SNe Ia-2002cx (Iax) do not satisfy this criterion, while the $a{\\rm (O\\ I\\\n\\lambda 7774\\AA)}$ index can separate SNe Ia-1991bg and Ia-1999aa cleanly. Type\nIb SNe satisfy that $a{\\rm (\\lambda6150\\AA)<0.35}$ and $a{\\rm (\\lambda6150\\AA)}\n/ a{\\rm (O\\ I\\ \\lambda 7774\\AA)>1}$, while regular Type Ic SNe show $a{\\rm\n(\\lambda6150\\AA)<0.35}$ but $a{\\rm (\\lambda6150\\AA)} / a{\\rm (O\\ I\\ \\lambda\n7774\\AA)<1}$. These quantitive classification criteria work well for the\nmajority of normal Type I SN subclasses. Peculiar SNe Ia-2002cx and SNe Ic-BL\nare the exception. We apply these criteria to provide clear identifications to\nintermediate or unclear SNe Ib/c. The results show good consistency with\nclassification using specific spectral line features. Though there are still\nsome puzzles about the physical mechanisms driving the diverse line ratios, our\nmethod is an accurate empirical method to identify the majority of Type I SNe.\n", "  The action potential signal of nerve and muscle is produced by voltage\nsensitive channels that include a specialized device to sense voltage. Gating\ncurrents of the voltage sensor are now known to depend on the back-and-forth\nmovements of positively charged arginines through the hydrophobic plug of a\nvoltage sensor domain. Transient movements of these permanently charged\narginines, caused by the change of transmembrane potential, further drag the S4\nsegment and induce opening/closing of ion conduction pore by moving the S4-S5\nlinker. The ion conduction pore is a separate device from the voltage sensor,\nlinked (in an unknown way) by the mechanical motion and electric field changes\nof the S4-S5 linker. This moving permanent charge induces capacitive current\nflow everywhere. Everything interacts with everything else in the voltage\nsensor so everything must interact with everything else in its mathematical\nmodel, as everything does in the whole protein. A PNP-steric model of arginines\nand a mechanical model for the S4 segment are combined using energy variational\nmethods in which all movements of charge and mass satisfy conservation laws of\ncurrent and mass. The resulting 1D continuum model is used to compute gating\ncurrents under a wide range of conditions, corresponding to experimental\nsituations. Chemical-reaction-type models based on ordinary differential\nequations cannot capture such interactions with one set of parameters. Indeed,\nthey may inadvertently violate conservation of current. Conservation of current\nis particularly important since small violations (<0.01%) quickly (<< 10-6\nseconds) produce forces that destroy molecules. Our model reproduces signature\nproperties of gating current: (1) equality of on and off charge in gating\ncurrent (2) saturating voltage dependence in QV curve and (3) many (but not\nall) details of the shape of gating current as a function of voltage.\n", "  Entanglement distillation is a fundamental task in quantum information\nprocessing. It not only extracts entanglement out of corrupted systems but also\nleads to protecting systems of interest against intervention with environment.\nIn this work, we consider a realistic scenario of entanglement distillation\nwhere noisy quantum operations are applied. In particular, the two-way\ndistillation protocol that tolerates the highest error rate is considered. We\nshow that among all types of noise there are only four equivalence classes\naccording to the distillability condition. Since the four classes are connected\nby local unitary transformations, our results can be used to improve\nentanglement distillability in practice when entanglement distillation is\nperformed in a realistic setting.\n", "  We present microscopic Hamiltonians that gap the Dirac fermions on the\nsurface of topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) protected by reflection\nsymmetry and create symmetry-preserving states with Abelian topological orders.\nFor TCIs with $n = 2$ copies of surface Dirac fermions, we find a fermionic\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order with charge-spin self duality and with a novel\nsymmetry action on the anyons, whereby reflections with respect to two parallel\nplanes act differently. We also analyze TCIs with $n = 1$ and $4$ copies of\nDirac fermions, which taken together covers every nontrivial case in the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_8 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of interacting TCIs. Our work\nreveals a fundamental difference between reflection and\ncharge-conjugation-time-reversal symmetry anomalies.\n", "  We carried out magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) and magnetization\nmeasurements on a single crystal of Ni2.00Mn1.16Ga0.84 in a longitudinal\ngeometry. While there had been reports of polar geometry measurements so far,\nwe show that - against earlier predictions - surface magnetic states of the\nmartensite and the austenite can be also probed efficiently via longitudinal\nMOKE. A single variant magnetic state, which occurs at room temperature, is\ncharacterized by ferromagnetic hysteresis loops similar to standard\nferromagnets. Temperature dependencies of Kerr rotation were found to be\nlinearly proportional to magnetization for martensitic phases. After passing\nthrough an inter martensitic structural transition at around 260 K in zero\nmagnetic field, the coercive fields are more than doubled in comparison with\nthe room temperature values. On the other hand, at higher temperatures above\n338 K where an austenite structure is formed, the MOKE signals are dominated by\nquadratic contributions and the magnitude of Kerr rotation drops due to changes\nin the electronic and magnetic domains structure. After the sample is cooled\nacross the austenite-martensite transition again, we observed a multiple beam\nreflected by the sample due to different types of structural domains present on\nits surface.\n", "  We analysed the centre of NGC 1566, which hosts a well-studied active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN), known for its variability. With the aid of techniques\nsuch as Principal Component Analysis Tomography, analysis of the emission-line\nspectra, channel maps, Penalized Pixel Fitting and spectral synthesis applied\nto the optical and near-infrared data cubes, besides the analysis of Hubble\nSpace Telescope images, we found that: (1) the AGN has a Seyfert 1 emission,\nwith a very strong featureless continuum that we described as a power law with\nspectral index of 1.7. However, this emission may come not only from the AGN\n[as its point spread function (PSF) is broader than the PSF of the broad-line\nregion (BLR)], but from hot and young stars, the same ones that probably\naccount for the observed sigma-drop. (2) There is a correlation between\nredshift and the full width at half-maximum of the BLR emission lines. With a\nsimple model assuming gravitational redshift, we described it as an emitting\nring with varying emitting radii and small inclination angles. (3) There is an\nH II region close to the AGN, which is composed of many substructures forming\nan apparent spiral with a velocity gradient. (4) We also detected a probable\noutflow coming from the AGN and it seems to contaminate the H II region\nemission. (5) We identified an H2 rotating disc with orientation approximately\nperpendicular to this outflow. This suggests that the rotating disc is an\nextension of an inner torus/disc structure, which collimates the outflow\nemission, according to the Unified Model.\n", "  The CFT dual of string theory on $\\mathrm{AdS}_3 \\times \\mathrm{S}^3 \\times\n\\mathrm{S}^3 \\times \\mathrm{S}^1$ is conjectured to be the symmetric orbifold\nof the $\\mathcal{S}_\\kappa$ theory, provided that one of the two $Q_5^\\pm$\nquantum numbers is a multiple of the other. We determine the BPS spectrum of\nthe symmetric orbifold in detail, and show that it reproduces precisely the BPS\nspectrum that was recently calculated in supergravity. We also determine the\nBPS spectrum of the world-sheet theory that is formulated in terms of WZW\nmodels, and show that, apart from some gaps (which are reminiscent of those\nthat appear in the corresponding $\\mathbb{T}^4$ calculation), it also\nreproduces this BPS spectrum. In fact, the matching seems to work as well as\nfor the familiar $\\mathbb{T}^4$ case, and thus our results give strong support\nfor this proposal.\n", "  Topological defects in ultrathin layers are often formed during synthesis and\nprocessing, thereby, strongly influencing their electronic properties . In this\npaper, we investigate the role of Stone-Wales (SW) defects in modifying the\nelectronic properties of the monolayers of Sn and group-V elements. The\ncalculated results find the electronic properties of stanene (monolayer of Sn\natoms) to be strongly dependent on the concentration of SW-defects e.g.,\ndefective stanene has nearly zero band gap (~ 0.03 eV) for the defect\nconcentration of 2.2 x 10^13 cm^-2 which opens up to 0.2 eV for the defect\nconcentration of 3.7 x 10^13 cm^-2. In contrast, SW-defects appear to induce\nconduction states in the semiconducting monolayers of group-V elements. These\nconduction states act as channels for electron tunnelling, and the calculated\ntunnelling characteristics show the highest differential conductance for the\nnegative bias with the asymmetric current-voltage characteristics. On the other\nhand, the highest differential conductance was found for the positive bias in\nstanene. Simulated STM topographical images of stanene and group-V monolayers\nshow distinctly different features in terms of their cross-sectional views and\ndistance-height profiles which can serve as fingerprints to identify the\ntopological defects in the monolayers of group-IV and group-V elements in\nexperiments.\n", "  We study the absorption spectrum of a probe field by a {\\Lambda}-type\nthree-level system, which is coupled to a quantized control field through the\ntwo upper energy levels. The probe field is applied to the ground and the\nsecond excited states. When the quantized control field is in vacuum, we derive\na threshold condition to discern vacuum induced transparency (VIT) and vacuum\ninduced Autler- Townes splitting (ATS). We also find that the parameter change\nfrom VIT to vacuum induced ATS is very similar to that from broken PT symmetry\nto PT symmetry. Moreover, we find the photon number resolved spectrum in the\nparameter regime of vacuum induced ATS when the mean photon number of the\nquantized control field is changed from zero (vacuum) to a finite number.\nHowever, there is no photon number resolved spectrum in the parameter regime of\nVIT even that the quantized control field contains the finite number of\nphotons. Finally, we further discuss possible experimental realization.\n", "  We propose a method to relate the holographic minimal information density to\nthe de Broglie's wavelength at a given universe temperature $T$. To figure this\nout, we assume that the thermal length of massive and massless constituents\nrepresents the cut-off scale of the holographic principle. To perform our\nanalysis, we suppose two plausible universe volumes, i.e. the adiabatic and the\nhorizon volumes, i.e. $V \\propto a^3$ and $V \\propto H^{-3}$ respectively,\nassuming zero spatial curvature. With these choices in mind, we evaluate the\nthermal lengths for massive and massless particles and we thus find two\ncosmological models associated to late and early cosmological epochs. We\ndemonstrate that both models depend upon a free term $\\beta$ which enters the\ntemperature parametrization in terms of the redshift $z$. For the two\ntreatments, we show evolving dark energy terms which can be compared with the\n$\\omega$CDM quintessence paradigm when the barotropic factor takes the formal\nvalues: $\\omega_0=-\\frac{1}{3}(2+\\beta)$ and $\\omega_0=-\\frac{1}{3}(1+2\\beta)$\nrespectively for late and early eras. From our analyses, we candidate the two\nmodels as viable alternatives to dark energy determined from thermodynamics in\nthe field of the holographic principle.\n", "  Little publicly available data exists for polarimetric measurements. When\ndesigning task specific polarimetric systems, the statistical properties of the\ntask specific data becomes important. Until better polarimetric datasets are\navailable to deduce statistics from, the statistics must be simulated to test\ninstrument performance. Most imaged scenes have been shown to follow a power\nlaw power spectral density distribution, for both natural and city scenes.\nFurthermore, imaged data appears to follow a power law power spectral\ndistribution temporally. We are interested in generating image sets which\nchange over time, and at the same time are correlated between different\ncomponents (spectral or polarimetric). In this brief communication, we present\na framework and provide code to generate such data.\n", "  A new semiclassical \"divide-and-conquer\" method is presented with the aim of\ndemonstrating that quantum dynamics simulations of high dimensional molecular\nsystems are doable. The method is first tested by calculating the quantum\nvibrational power spectra of water, methane, and benzene - three molecules of\nincreasing dimensionality for which benchmark quantum results are available -\nand then applied to C60, a system characterized by 174 vibrational degrees of\nfreedom. Results show that the approach can accurately account for quantum\nanharmonicities, purely quantum features like overtones, and the removal of\ndegeneracy when the molecular symmetry is broken.\n", "  We have calculated the implicit shift for various modes of frequency in a\npure graphene sheet. Thermal expansion and Gr\\\"uneisen parameter which are\nrequired for implicit shift calculation have already been studied and reported.\nFor this calculation, phonon frequencies are obtained using force constants\nderived from dynamical matrix calculated using VASP code where the density\nfunctional perturbation theory (DFPT) is used in interface with phonopy\nsoftware. The implicit phonon shift shows an unusual behavior as compared to\nthe bulk materials. The frequency shift is large negative (red shift) for ZA\nand ZO modes and the value of negative shift increases with increase in\ntemperature. On the other hand, blue shift arises for all other longitudinal\nand transverse modes with a similar trend of increase with increase in\ntemperature. The q dependence of phonon shifts has also been studied. Such\nsimultaneous red and blue shifts transverse or out plane modes and surface\nmodes, respectively leads to speculation of surface softening in out of plane\ndirection in preference to surface melting.\n", "  Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ships represent a clear demonstration of the\nLorentz force in fluids, which explains the number of students practicals or\nexercises described on the web. However, the related literature is rather\nspecific and no complete comparison between theory and typical small scale\nexperiments is currently available. This work provides, in a self-consistent\nframework, a detailed presentation of the relevant theoretical equations for\nsmall MHD ships and experimental measurements for future benchmarks.\nTheoretical results of the literature are adapted to these simple\nbattery/magnets powered ships moving on salt water. Comparison between theory\nand experiments are performed to validate each theoretical step such as the\nTafel and the Kohlrausch laws, or the predicted ship speed. A successful\nagreement is obtained without any adjustable parameter. Finally, based on these\nresults, an optimal design is then deduced from the theory. Therefore this work\nprovides a solid theoretical and experimental ground for small scale MHD ships,\nby presenting in detail several approximations and how they affect the boat\nefficiency. Moreover, the theory is general enough to be adapted to other\ncontexts, such as large scale ships or industrial flow measurement techniques.\n", "  High precision spectrometry of galactic cosmic rays (CR) has revealed the\nlack of our understanding of how different CR elements are extracted from the\nsupernova environments to be further accelerated in their shocks. Comparing the\nspectra of accelerated particles with different mass to charge ratios is a\npowerful tool for studying the physics of particle injection into the diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA). Recent AMS-02 demonstration of the similarity of\nHe/$p$, C/$p$, and O/$p$ rigidity spectra has provided new evidence that\ninjection is a mass-to-charge dependent process. We performed hybrid\nsimulations of collisionless shocks and analyzed a joint injection of $p$ and\nHe$^{2+}$ in conjunction with upstream waves they generate. By implication, our\nresults equally apply to C and O fully ionized ions, since they have similar\nmass to charge ratios. By convolving the time-dependent injection rates of $p$\nand He, obtained from the simulations, with a decreasing shock strength over\nthe active life of SNRs, we generate the integrated SNR spectra for $p$ and He.\nThese spectra are consistent with the AMS-02 and Pamela data and earlier\ntheoretical predictions. Our interpretation of the elemental anomaly is\ntherefore intrinsic to collisionless shock mechanisms and does not require\nadditional assumptions, such as the contributions from several different SNRs,\ntheir inhomogeneous environments or acceleration from grains.\n", "  We detect thermally excited surfaces waves on a submicron SiO 2 layer,\nincluding Zenneck and guided modes in addition to Surface Phonon Polaritons.\nThe measurements show the existence of these hybrid thermal-electromagnetic\nwaves from near-(2.7 $\\mu$m) to far-(11.2 $\\mu$m) infrared. Their propagation\ndistances reach values on the order of the millimeter, several orders of\nmagnitude larger than on semi-infinite systems. These two features, spectral\nbroadness and long range propagation, make these waves good candidates for\nnear-field applications both in optics and thermics due to their dual nature.\n", "  The model of a spiral galaxy with radially directed flows of dark matter is\nextended by exotic matter, in a form of a perfect fluid with a linear\nanisotropic equation of state. The exotic matter is collected in the minimum of\ngravitational potential and opens a wormhole in the center of the galaxy. The\nflows of dark matter pass through the wormhole and form a mirror galaxy on the\nother side. The influence of model parameters to the shape of solution is\nstudied, a solution matching parameters of Milky Way galaxy is computed.\n", "  Quantum key distribution is a cryptographic primitive for the distribution of\nsymmetric encryption keys between two parties that possess a pre-shared secret.\nSince the pre-shared secret is a requirement, quantum key distribution may be\nviewed as a key growing protocol. We note that the use of pre-shared secrets\ncoupled with access to randomness beacons may enable key growing which, though\nnot secure from an information-theoretic standpoint, remains quantum safe.\n", "  Using combination of Density Functional Theory and Monte Carlo simulation, we\nstudy the phase stability and electronic properties of two dimensional\nhexagonal composites of boron nitride and graphene, with a goal to uncover the\nrole of the interface geometry formed between the two. Our study highlights\nthat preferential creation of extended armchair interfaces may facilitate\nformation of solid solution of boron nitride and graphene within a certain\ntemperature range. We further find that for band-gap engineering, armchair\ninterfaces or patchy interfaces with mixed geometry are most suitable.\nExtending the study to nanoribbon geometry shows that reduction of\ndimensionality makes the tendency to phase segregation of the two phases even\nstronger. Our thorough study should form an useful database in designing boron\nnitride-graphene composites with desired properties.\n", "  In this article we discuss a star generated by some matter fluid, whose\nstress-energy tensor is known. We investigate both the maximally symmetric\nframework, where all the pressures are equal, and the dark energy framework,\nwith $P = -\\rho$. We show that the first one is not able to produce a black\nhole, while second one actually is. Finally, within this second framework, we\npresent an example of regular black hole, showing it satisfies the NEC and the\nWEC.\n", "  In this paper, we have predicted the stabilities of several two-dimensional\nphases of silicon nitride, which we name as \\alpha-phase, \\beta-phase, and\n\\gamma-phase, respectively. Both \\alpha- and \\beta-phases has formula\nSi$_{2}$N$_{2}$, and are consisted of two similar layer of buckled SiN sheet.\nSimilarly, \\gamma-phase is consisted of two puckered SiN sheets. For these\nphases, the two layers are connected with Si-Si covalent bonds. Transformation\nbetween \\alpha- and \\beta-phases is difficult because of the high energy\nbarrier. Phonon spectra of both \\alpha- and \\beta-phase suggest their\nthermodynamic stabilities, because no phonon mode with imaginary frequency is\npresent. By Contrast, \\gamma-phase is unstable because phonon modes with\nimaginary frequencies are found along \\Gamma-Y path in the Brilliouin zone.\nBoth \\alpha- and \\beta-phase are semiconductor with narrow fundamental indirect\nband gap of 1.7eV and 1.9eV, respectively. As expected, only s and p orbitals\nin the outermost shells contribute the band structures. The p$_{z}$ orbitals\nhave greater contribution near the Fermi level. These materials can easily\nexfoliate to form 2D structures, and may have potential electronic\napplications.\n", "  Magnetotactic bacteria moving on circular orbits form hydrodynamically bound\nstates. When close to a surface and with the tilting of the field in a\ndirection close to the perpendicular to this surface these swarms move\nperpendicularly to the tilting angle. We describe quantitatively this motion by\na continuum model with couple stress arising from the torques produced by the\nrotary motors of the amphitrichous magnetotactic bacteria. The model not only\ncorrectly describes the change of direction of swarm motion while inverting the\ntangential field but also predicts reasonable value of the torque produced by\nthe rotary motors.\n", "  We demonstrate frequency-bin entanglement between ultra-narrowband photons\ngenerated by cavity enhanced spontaneous parametric down conversion. Our source\ngenerates photon pairs in widely non-degenerate discrete frequency modes, with\none photon resonant with a quantum memory material based on praseodymium doped\ncrystals and the other photon at telecom wavelengths. Correlations between the\nfrequency modes are analyzed using phase modulators and narrowband filters\nbefore detection. We show high-visibility two photon interference between the\nfrequency modes, allowing us to infer a coherent superposition of the modes. We\ndevelop a model describing the state that we create and use it to estimate\noptimal measurements to achieve a violation of the Clauser-Horne (CH) Bell\ninequality under realistic assumptions. With these settings we perform a Bell\ntest and show a significant violation of the CH inequality, thus proving the\nentanglement of the photons. Finally we demonstrate the compatibility with a\nquantum memory material by using a spectral hole in the praseodymium (Pr) doped\ncrystal as spectral filter for measuring high-visibility two-photon\ninterference. This demonstrates the feasibility of combining frequency-bin\nentangled photon pairs with Pr-based solid state quantum memories.\n", "  The paper is based on the Bachelor Thesis defended this year in ITEP, Moscow.\nThis is the extended version of [arXiv:1707.02242] and contains a lot more\ntechnical details of the calculations. We consider (1+1)-dimensional massless\nscalar field theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions on arbitrary time-like\ncurve. It is well known that in this situation there is a non-zero energy flux\nat the tree-level, if the latter curve corresponds to a non--stationary motion\nof the boundary. Such a problem is usually referred to as the radiation due to\nmoving mirrors. We calculate quantum loop corrections to the energy flux from\nmoving mirrors and find that they grow with time. Hence, they are not\nsuppressed in comparison with the semi--classical contributions. Thus, we\nobserve the break down of the perturbation theory, discuss its physical origin\nand ways to deal with such a situation.\n", "  Classic economic science is reaching the limits of its explanatory powers.\nComplexity science uses an increasingly larger set of different methods to\nanalyze physical, biological, cultural, social, and economic factors, providing\na broader understanding of the socio-economic dynamics involved in the\ndevelopment of nations worldwide. The use of tools developed in the natural\nsciences, such as thermodynamics, evolutionary biology, and analysis of complex\nsystems, help us to integrate aspects, formerly reserved to the social\nsciences, with the natural sciences. This integration reveals details of the\nsynergistic mechanisms that drive the evolution of societies. By doing so, we\nincrease the available alternatives for economic analysis and provide ways to\nincrease the efficiency of decision-making mechanisms in complex social\ncontexts. This interdisciplinary analysis seeks to deepen our understanding of\nwhy chronic poverty is still common, and how the emergence of prosperous\ntechnological societies can be made possible. This understanding should\nincrease the chances of achieving a sustainable, harmonious and prosperous\nfuture for humanity. The analysis evidences that complex fundamental economic\nproblems require multidisciplinary approaches and rigorous application of the\nscientific method if we want to advance significantly our understanding of\nthem. The analysis reveals viable routes for the generation of wealth and the\nreduction of poverty, but also reveals huge gaps in our knowledge about the\ndynamics of our societies and about the means to guide social development\ntowards a better future for all.\n", "  The well known and oft-quoted Feynman's expression, entered the title,\nleading at a loss and even being objectionable, has not yet a clear\nexplanation. The hidden parameters problem in quantum mechanics is considered\nhere on the base of group-theoretic approach which includes the complete set of\nobservables indispensably. The last ones are the bilinear Hermitian forms\nconstructed from the Schroedinger equation solutions and its first derivatives,\nthey satisfy the algebraic completeness condition. These Hermitian forms,\nobtained for the simplest standard problem of particle transmission above\npotential step, had been compared with the Hermitian forms which are usually\nconsidered in this problem, and an additional ones, which may be obtained\nwithin the framework of an ordinary schemes of quantum mechanics. It is shown\nthat the generally recognised schemes of the problem solution lead to violation\nof some conservation laws on the step directly. On the contrary, the\ngroup-theoretic approach leads to fulfillments of all necessary conservation\nlaws everywhere at the same time. It is also shown that the complete set of\nobservables leads a probabilistic interpretation in quantum mechanics to be\nexcessive.\n", "  We apply the viscous decretion disc (VDD) model to interpret the infrared\ndisc continuum emission of 80 Be stars observed in different epochs. In this\nway, we determined 169 specific disc structures, namely their density scale,\n$\\rho_0$, and exponent, $n$. We found that the $n$ values range mainly between\n$1.5$ and $3.5$, and $\\rho_0$ varies between $10^{-12}$ and\n$10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$, with a peak close to the lower value. Our\nlarge sample also allowed us to firmly establish that the discs around\nearly-type stars are denser than in late-type stars. Additionally, we estimated\nthe disc mass decretion rates and found that they range between $10^{-12}$ and\n$10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}}$. These values are compatible with recent\nstellar evolution models of fast-rotating stars. One of the main findings of\nthis work is a correlation between the $\\rho_0$ and $n$ values. In order to\nfind out whether these relations can be traced back to the evolution of discs\nor have some other origin, we used the VDD model to calculate temporal\nsequences under different assumptions for the time profile of the disc mass\ninjection. The results support the hypothesis that the observed distribution of\ndisc properties is due to a common evolutionary path. In particular, our\nresults suggest that the timescale for disc growth, during which the disc is\nbeing actively fed by mass injection episodes, is shorter than the timescale\nfor disc dissipation, when the disc is no longer fed by the star and dissipates\nas a result of the viscous diffusion of the disc material.\n", "  Neutrino mass sum-rule is a very important research subject from theoretical\nside because neutrino oscillation experiment only gave us two squared-mass\ndifferences and three mixing angles. We review neutrino mass sum-rule in\nliterature that have been reported by many authors and discuss its\nphenomenological implications especially on neutrino mass and neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay by plotting effective Majorana mass $\\left<m_{ee}\\right>$ as\nfunction of the lightest neutrino mass both for normal and inverted hierarchy\nby using the central values of reported mixing angles and reported squared-mass\ndifferences as input\n", "  We suggest an inverse dispersion method for calculating photonic band diagram\nfor materials with arbitrary frequency-dependent dielectric functions. The\nmethod is able to calculate the complex wave vector for a given frequency by\nsolving the eigenvalue problem with a non-Hermitian operator. The analogy with\n$\\cal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians reveals that the operator corresponds to the\nmomentum as a physical quantity and the singularities at the band edges are\nrelated to the branch points and responses for the features on the band edges.\nThe method is realized using plane wave expansion technique for two-dimensional\nperiodical structure in the case of TE- and TM-polarization. We illustrate the\napplicability of the method by calculation of the photonic band diagrams of an\ninfinite two-dimension square lattice composed of dielectric cylinders using\nthe measured frequency dependent dielectric functions of different materials\n(amorphous hydrogenated carbon, silicon, and chalcogenide glass). We show that\nthe method allows to distinguish unambiguously between Bragg and Mie gaps in\nthe spectra.\n", "  Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a popular technique for modal\ndecomposition, flow analysis, and reduced-order modeling. In situations where a\nsystem is time varying, one would like to update the system's description\nonline as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing\nDMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data\nbecomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and\ncomputes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that\nplaces less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward\nmanner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A\nvariant of the method may also be applied to online computation of \"windowed\nDMD\", in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method\nis compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the\nstate dimension is less than about~200, the proposed algorithm is the most\nefficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more\nefficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on\nseveral examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex\nexample using data from a wind tunnel experiment. In particular, we show that\nthe method is effective at capturing the dynamics of surface pressure\nmeasurements in the flow over a flat plate with an unsteady separation bubble.\n", "  We investigate analytically a microfluidic device consisting of a tube with\nnon-uniform but spatially periodic diameter, where a fluid driven back and\nforth by a pump carries colloidal particles. Although the net flow of the fluid\nis zero, the particles move preferentially in one direction due to ratchet\nmechanism, which occurs by simultaneous effect of inertial hydrodynamics and\nBrownian motion. We show that the average current is strongly sensitive to\nparticle size, thus facilitating colloidal particle sorting.\n", "  The goal of the present study is to develop polymeric matrix films loaded\nwith a combination of free diclofenac sodium (DFSfree) and DFS:Ion exchange\nresin complexes (DFS:IR) for immediate and sustained release profiles,\nrespectively. Effect of ratio of DFS and IR on the DFS:IR complexation\nefficiency was studied using batch processing. DFS:IR complex, DFSfree, or a\ncombination of DFSfree+DFS:IR loaded matrix films were prepared by melt-cast\ntechnology. DFS content was 20% w/w in these matrix films. In vitro\ntranscorneal permeability from the film formulations were compared against DFS\nsolution, using a side-by-side diffusion apparatus, over a 6 h period. Ocular\ndisposition of DFS from the solution, films and corresponding suspensions were\nevaluated in conscious New Zealand albino rabbits, 4 h and 8 h post-topical\nadministration. All in vivo studies were carried out as per the University of\nMississippi IACUC approved protocol. Complexation efficiency of DFS:IR was\nfound to be 99% with a 1:1 ratio of DFS:IR. DFS release from DFS:IR suspension\nand the film were best-fit to a Higuchi model. In vitro transcorneal flux with\nthe DFSfree+DFS:IR(1:1)(1 + 1) was twice that of only DFS:IR(1:1) film. In\nvivo, DFS solution and DFS:IR(1:1) suspension formulations were not able to\nmaintain therapeutic DFS levels in the aqueous humor (AH). Both DFSfree and\nDFSfree+DFS:IR(1:1)(3 + 1) loaded matrix films were able to achieve and\nmaintain high DFS concentrations in the AH, but elimination of DFS from the\nocular tissues was much faster with the DFSfree formulation. DFSfree+DFS:IR\ncombination loaded matrix films were able to deliver and maintain therapeutic\nDFS concentrations in the anterior ocular chamber for up to 8 h. Thus, free\ndrug/IR complex loaded matrix films could be a potential topical ocular\ndelivery platform for achieving immediate and sustained release\ncharacteristics.\n", "  This article is concerned with the large data global regularity for the\nequivariant case of the classical Skyrme model and proves that this is valid\nfor initial data in $H^s\\times H^{s-1}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ with $s>7/2$.\n", "  High energy ($> 250$ keV) emission has been detected persisting for several\ntens of seconds after the initial spike of magnetar giant flares. It has been\nconjectured that this emission might arise via inverse Compton scattering in a\nhighly extended corona generated by super-Eddington outflows high up in the\nmagnetosphere. In this paper we undertake a detailed examination of this model.\nWe investigate the properties of the required scatterers, and whether the\nmechanism is consistent with the degree of pulsed emission observed in the tail\nof the giant flare. We conclude that the mechanism is consistent with current\ndata, although the origin of the scattering population remains an open\nquestion. We propose an alternative picture in which the emission is closer to\nthat star and is dominated by synchrotron radiation. The $RHESSI$ observations\nof the December 2004 flare modestly favor this latter picture. We assess the\nprospects for the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope to detect and characterize a\nsimilar high energy component in a future giant flare. Such a detection should\nhelp to resolve some of the outstanding issues.\n", "  Quantum optics is the study of the intrinsically quantum properties of light.\nDuring the second part of the 20th century experimental and theoretical\nprogress developed together; nowadays quantum optics provides a testbed of many\nfundamental aspects of quantum mechanics such as coherence and quantum\nentanglement. Quantum optics helped trigger, both directly and indirectly, the\nbirth of quantum technologies, whose aim is to harness non-classical quantum\neffects in applications from quantum key distribution to quantum computing.\nQuantum light remains at the heart of many of the most promising and\npotentially transformative quantum technologies. In this review, we celebrate\nthe work of Sir Peter Knight and present an overview of the development of\nquantum optics and its impact on quantum technologies research. We describe the\ncore theoretical tools developed to express and study the quantum properties of\nlight, the key experimental approaches used to control, manipulate and measure\nsuch properties and their application in quantum simulation, and quantum\ncomputing.\n", "  Cell cycle is an indispensable process in the proliferation and development.\nDespite significant efforts, global quantification and physical understanding\nare still challenging. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of Xenopus\nlaevis embryonic cell cycle by quantifying the underlying landscape and flux.\nWe uncovered the irregular Mexican hat landscape of the Xenopus laevis\nembryonic cell cycle with several local basins and barriers on the oscillation\npath. The local basins characterize the different phases of Xenopus laevis\nembryonic cell cycle and the local barriers represent the checkpoints. The\ncheckpoint mechanism of cell cycle is revealed by the landscape basins and\nbarriers. While landscape shape determines the stabilities of the states on the\noscillation path, the curl flux force determines the stability of the cell\ncycle flow. Replication is fundamental for biology of living. From our\nquantitative study here, we see that replication can not proceed without energy\ninput. In fact, the curl flux originated from energy or nutrition supply\ndetermines the speed of the cell cycle and guarantees the progression. Speed of\ncell cycle is a hallmark of cancer. Through landscape and flux analysis, one\ncan identify the key elements for controlling the speed. This can help to\ndesign effective strategy for drug discovery against cancer.\n", "  There is growing evidence that cognitive processes may have fractal\nstructures as a signature of complexity. It is an an ongoing topic of research\nto study the class of complexity and how it may differ as a function of\ncognitive variables. Here, we explore the eye movement trajectories generated\nduring reading different Persian texts. Features of eye movement trajectories\nwere recorded during reading Persian texts using an eye tracker. We show that\nfixation durations, as the main components of eye movements reflecting\ncognitive processing, exhibits multifractal behavior. This indicates that\nmultiple exponents are needed to capture the neural and cognitive processes\ninvolved in decoding symbols to derive meaning. We test whether multifractal\nbehavior varies as a function of two different fonts, familiarity of the text\nfor readers, and reading silently or aloud, and goal-oriented versus\nnon-goal-oriented reading. We find that, while mean fixation duration is\naffected by some of these factors, the multifractal pattern in time series of\neye fixation durations did not change significantly. Our results suggest that\nmultifractal dynamics may be intrinsic to the reading process.\n", "  Let $S=\\mathbb{T}^d$ be a torus and $\\mu$ the probability distribution of a\nL\\'evy white noise field $x:S\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$. Using projective limit\nmeasures we address the problem of making sense of $\\mathrm{e}^{-T(x)}$, where\n$T(x) = \\int_S \\lvert\\nabla x(s)\\rvert^2 \\mathrm{d}s$ is the kinetic energy, as\na function in $L^1(\\mu)$. We start by making sense of $T(x)$ itself as a sort\nof distribution, which is achieved by a generalization of Wick ordering. Then\nwe specify to the case of a $\\Gamma$ field, finding that Wick ordering does not\neliminate all divergences. Higher order renormalization would be required, but\nthe model seems to be non-renormalizable.\n", "  Ghost fields have reemerged in a handful of phenomenologically motivated\ncosmological and particle physics scenarios, and most recently in a cyclic\nmechanism to address the fine-tuning of gauge couplings in the standard model.\nWe study the classical and quantum stability of a ghost-dilaton system coupled\nto a gauge sector and find that this system is classically stable due to the\nexistence of limit cycles in phase space. We also analyze the coupled gauge\ninvariant classical perturbations and find a range of phenomenologically viable\nparameters where the system is stable. We also discuss ways to avoid both\nquantum and vacuum instabilities by either having a ghost condensate or\nClassicon configurations.\n", "  We report serendipitous detections of line emission with ALMA in band 3, 6,\nand 7 in the central parsec of the Galactic center at an up to now highest\nresolution (<0.7''). Among the highlights are the very first and highly\nresolved images of sub-mm molecular emission of CS, H13CO+, HC3N, SiO, SO, C2H,\nand CH3OH in the immediate vicinity (~1'' in projection) of Sgr A* and in the\ncircumnuclear disk (CND). The central association (CA) of molecular clouds\nshows three times higher CS/X (X: any other observed molecule) luminosity\nratios than the CND suggesting a combination of higher excitation - by a\ntemperature gradient and/or IR-pumping - and abundance enhancement due to UV-\nand/or X-ray emission. We conclude that the CA is closer to the center than the\nCND is and could be an infalling clump consisting of denser cloud cores\nembedded in diffuse gas. Moreover, we identified further regions in and outside\nthe CND that are ideally suited for future studies in the scope of hot/cold\ncore and extreme PDR/XDR chemistry and consequent star formation in the central\nfew parsecs.\n", "  The phenomenon of polarization of nuclei in the process of stimulated\nrecombination of atoms in the field of circularly polarized laser radiation is\nconsidered. This effect is considered for the case of the proton-electron beams\nused in the method of electron cooling. An estimate is obtained for the maximum\ndegree of polarization of the protons on components of the hyperfine structure\nof the 2s state of the hydrogen atom.\n", "  We use the duality between color and kinematics to obtain scattering\namplitudes in non-minimal conformal N=0,1,2,4 (super)gravity theories. Generic\ntree amplitudes can be constructed from a double copy between\n(super-)Yang-Mills theory and a new gauge theory built entirely out of\ndimension-six operators. The latter theory is marginal in six dimensions and\ncontains modes with a wrong-sign propagator, echoing the behavior of conformal\ngravity. The dimension-six Lagrangian is uniquely determined by demanding that\nits scattering amplitudes obey the color-kinematics duality. The conformal\ngravity amplitudes obtained from the double copy are compared with the\nBerkovits-Witten twistor string and shown to agree up to at least eight points\nin the MHV sector. Our construction can be generalized in a number of ways.\nAdding scalars to the dimension-six theory gives Maxwell-Weyl gravity, and\nfurther adding phi^3 self-interactions among these scalars gives\nYang-Mills-Weyl gravity. The latter is identified with Witten's twistor string\nfor maximal N=4 supersymmetry. Deforming the dimension-six theory by adding a\nYang-Mills term, m^2 F^2, gives a gauge theory that interpolates between\nmarginal D=6 and D=4 theories. The corresponding double copy gives an\ninterpolation between conformal gravity and Einstein gravity.\n"]}
