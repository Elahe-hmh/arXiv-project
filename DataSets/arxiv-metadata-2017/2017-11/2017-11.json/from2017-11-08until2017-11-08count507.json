symmetrized (two identical bosons) and\nan antisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.\nConsidering two identical particles symmetrically impinging on a\none-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that the phase time and the dwell time\ngive connected results where, however, the exact position of the scattered\nparticles is explicitly determined by the phase time (group delay). For the\nantisymmetrized wave function configuration, an unusual effect of {\\em\naccelerated} transmission is clearly identified in a simultaneous tunneling of\ntwo identical fermions.\n", "  We study the tunneling zone solutions of a one-dimensional electrostatic\npotential for the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave equation when the\nincoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being almost totally\ntransmitted through the barrier. The transmission probabilities, the phase\ntimes and the dwell times for the proposed relativistic dynamics are obtained\nand the conditions for the occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission are\nall quantified. We show that, in some limiting cases, the analytical\ndifficulties that arise when the stationary phase method is employed for\nobtaining phase (traversal) tunneling times are all overcome. Lessons\nconcerning the phenomenology of the relativistic tunneling suggest revealing\ninsights into condensed-matter experiments using electrostatic barriers for\nwhich the accelerated tunneling effect can be observed.\n", "  The general and explicit relation between the phase time and the dwell time\nfor quantum tunneling of a relativistically propagating particle is\ninvestigated and quantified. In analogy with previously obtained\nnon-relativistic results, it is shown that the group delay can be described in\nterms of the dwell time and a self-interference delay. Lessons concerning the\nphenomenology of the relativistic tunneling are drawn.\n", "  This report deals with the basic concepts on deducing transit times for\nquantum scattering: the stationary phase method and its relation with delay\ntimes for relativistic and non-relativistic tunneling particles. We notice that\nthe applicability of this method is constrained by several subtleties in\nderiving the phase time that describes the localization of scattered wave\npackets. We investigate the general relation between phase times and dwell\ntimes for quantum tunneling/scattering. Considering a symmetrical collision of\ntwo identical wave packets with an one-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that\nthese two distinct transit time definitions are explicitly connected. The\ntraversal times are obtained for a symmetrized (two identical bosons) and an\nantisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.\nMultiple wave packet decomposition shows us that the phase time (group delay)\ndescribes the exact position of the scattered particles and, in addition to the\nexact relation with the dwell time, leads to correct conceptual understanding\nof both transit time definitions. At last, we extend the non-relativistic\nformalism to the solutions for the tunneling zone of a one-dimensional\nelectrostatic potential in the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave\nequation where the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being\nalmost totally transmitted through the potential barrier. The conditions for\nthe occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission probabilities are all\nquantified and the problematic superluminal interpretation based on the\nnon-relativistic tunneling dynamics is revisited.\n", "  In a region free of currents, magnetostatics can be described by the Laplace\nequation of a scalar magnetic potential, and one can apply the same methods\ncommonly used in electrostatics. Here we show how to calculate the general\nvector field inside a real (finite) solenoid, using only the magnitude of the\nfield along the symmetry axis. Our method does not require integration or\nknowledge of the current distribution, and is presented through practical\nexamples, including a non-uniform finite solenoid used to produce cold atomic\nbeams via laser cooling. These examples allow educators to discuss the\nnon-trivial calculation of fields off-axis using concepts familiar to most\nstudents, while offering the opportunity to introduce important advancements of\ncurrent modern research.\n", "  We present the implementation of a radiative transfer solver with coherent\nscattering in the new BIFROST code for radiative magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD)\nsimulations of stellar surface convection. The code is fully parallelized using\nMPI domain decomposition, which allows for large grid sizes and improved\nresolution of hydrodynamical structures. We apply the code to simulate the\nsurface granulation in a solar-type star, ignoring magnetic fields, and\ninvestigate the importance of coherent scattering for the atmospheric\nstructure. A scattering term is added to the radiative transfer equation,\nrequiring an iterative computation of the radiation field. We use a\nshort-characteristics-based Gauss-Seidel acceleration scheme to compute\nradiative flux divergences for the energy equation. The effects of coherent\nscattering are tested by comparing the temperature stratification of three 3D\ntime-dependent hydrodynamical atmosphere models of a solar-type star: without\nscattering, with continuum scattering only, and with both continuum and line\nscattering. We show that continuum scattering does not have a significant\nimpact on the photospheric temperature structure for a star like the Sun.\nIncluding scattering in line-blanketing, however, leads to a decrease of\ntemperatures by about 350\\,K below log tau < -4. The effect is opposite to that\nof 1D hydrostatic models in radiative equilibrium, where scattering reduces the\ncooling effect of strong LTE lines in the higher layers of the photosphere.\nCoherent line scattering also changes the temperature distribution in the high\natmosphere, where we observe stronger fluctuations compared to a treatment of\nlines as true absorbers.\n", "  We have created a long-lived (~ 40 s) persistent current in a toroidal\nBose-Einstein condensate held in an all-optical trap. A repulsive optical\nbarrier creates a tunable weak link in the condensate circuit, which can affect\nthe current around the loop. Superflow stops abruptly at a barrier strength\nsuch that the local flow velocity exceeds a critical velocity. The measured\ncritical velocity is consistent with dissipation due to the creation of\nvortex-antivortex pairs. This system is the first realization of an elementary\nclosed-loop atom circuit.\n", "  We first briefly review the role of lattice paths in the derivation of\nfermionic expressions for the M(p,p') minimal model characters of the Virasoro\nLie algebra. We then focus on the recently introduced half-lattice paths for\nthe M(p,2p+/-1) characters, reformulating them in such a way that the two cases\nmay be treated uniformly. That the generating functions of these half-lattice\npaths are indeed M(p,2p+/-1) characters is proved by describing weight\npreserving bijections between them and the corresponding RSOS lattice paths.\nHere, the M(p,2p-1) case is derived for the first time. We then apply the\nmethods of Bressoud and Warnaar to these half-lattice paths to derive fermionic\nexpressions for the Virasoro characters X^{p,2p+/-1}_{1,2} that differ from\nthose obtained from the RSOS paths.\n  This work is an extension of that presented by the third author at the \"7th\nInternational Conference on Lattice Path Combinatorics and Applications\",\nSiena, Italy, July 2010.\n", "  We present here arguments in favor of the existence of the lightest lepton\nand its neutrino. This new family with a fourth lepton flavor uncovered so far\nunobserved universal properties of matter. The unity of the laws of their\nnature admits the flavor symmetrical decays of the electron and proton.\nThereby, it predicts the new modes in the decays of the muon, tau lepton and\nneutron. At the same time, in all these transitions, no conservation laws are\nviolated, confirming the availability in nature of a place for an additivity of\nmass.\n", "  According to the no-hair theorem, the Kerr-Newman black hole solution\nrepresents the most general asymptotically flat, stationary (electro-) vacuum\nblack hole solution in general relativity. The procedure described here shows\nhow this solution can indeed be constructed as the unique solution to the\ncorresponding boundary value problem of the axially symmetric Einstein-Maxwell\nequations in a straightforward manner.\n", "  A search for resonant WZ production in the lnul'l' (l, l'= e,mu) decay\nchannel using 20.3 fb-1 of sqrt(s) = 8 TeV pp collision data collected by the\nATLAS experiment at LHC is presented. No significant deviation from the\nStandard Model prediction is observed and upper limits on the production cross\nsections of WZ resonances from an extended gauge model W' and from a simplified\nmodel of heavy vector triplets are derived. A corresponding observed (expected)\nlower mass limit of 1.52 (1.49) TeV is derived for the W' at the 95% confidence\nlevel.\n", "  We present a method for generating precise magnetic potentials that can be\ndescribed by a polynomial series along the axis of a cold atom waveguide near\nthe surface of an atom chip. With a single chip design consisting of several\nwire pairs, various axial potentials can be created by varying the ratio of the\ncurrents in the wires, including double wells, triple wells, and pure harmonic\ntraps with suppression of higher order terms. We use this method to design and\nfabricate a chip with modest experimental requirements. Finally, we use the\nchip to demonstrate a double well potential.\n", "  We analyze the effect of a gravitational field on the sound modes of\nsuperfluids. We derive an instability condition that generalizes the well known\nJeans instability of the sound mode in normal fluids. We discuss potential\nexperimental implications.\n", "  The interaction between phonons and high-energy excitations of electronic\norigin in cuprates and their role in the superconducting mechanisms is still\ncontroversial. Here we use coherent vibrational time-domain spectroscopy\ntogether with density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations\nto establish a direct link between the c-axis phonon modes and the in-plane\nelectronic charge excitations in optimally doped YBCO. The non-equilibrium\nRaman tensor is measured by means of the broadband 'coherent-phonon' response\nin pump-probe experiments and is qualitatively described by our model using DFT\nin frozen phonon approximation plus single band DMFT to account for the\nelectronic correlations. The major outcome of our experimental and theoretical\nstudy is to establish the link between out-of-plane copper ions displacements\nand the in-plane electronic correlations, and to estimate at few unit cells the\ncorrelation length of the associated phonon mode. The approach introduced here\ncould help revealing the complex interplay between fluctuations of different\nnature and spatial correlation in several strongly-correlated materials.\n", "  We explore theoretically the optical response properties in an optomechanical\nsystem under electromagneti- cally induced transparency condition but with the\nmechanical resonator being driven by an additional coherent field. In this\nconfiguration, more complex quantum coherent and interference phenomena occur.\nIn partic- ular, we find that the probe transmission spectra depend on the\ntotal phase of the applied fields. Our study also provides an efficient way to\ncontrol propagation of amplification.\n", "  In this work we review and further develop the controversial concept of\n\"classical entanglement\" in optical beams. We present a unified theory for\ndifferent kinds of light beams exhibiting classical entanglement and we\nindicate several possible extensions of the concept. Our results shed new light\nupon the physics at the debated border between the classical and the quantum\nrepresentations of the world.\n", "  We introduce quantum history states and their mathematical framework, thereby\nreinterpreting and extending the consistent histories approach to quantum\ntheory. Through thought experiments, we demonstrate that our formalism allows\nus to analyze a quantum version of history in which we reconstruct the past by\nobservations. In particular, we can pass from measurements to inferences about\n\"what happened\" in a way that is sensible and free of paradox. Our framework\nallows for a richer understanding of the temporal structure of quantum theory,\nand we construct history states that embody peculiar, non-classical\ncorrelations in time.\n", "  In this paper we consider charged and neutral blackfold and extract the\nBrown-York stress energy tensor. Also, we show that the neutral blackfold\nspacetime is Ricci- flat and the other spacetime is not. This Ricci-flat\ncondition gives us opportunity to calculate the AAdS spacetime. In order to\nhave dual theory one can consider the AAdS in Fefferman- Graham coordinates.\nThis frame gives correct form of stress tensor in the boundary. The\ncorresponding tensor with using this frame will be traceless and conserved.\nSuch stress tensor is same as perfect fluid and it proves the dual renormalized\ntheory exists for the neutral blackfold .\n", "  Due to the exponential high gravitational red shift near the event horizon of\na black hole, it might appears that the Hawking radiation would be highly\nsensitive to some unknown high energy physics. To study possible deviations\nfrom the Hawking's prediction, the dispersive field theory models have been\nproposed, following the Unruh's hydrodynamic analogue of a black hole\nradiation. In the dispersive field theory models, the dispersion relations of\nmatter fields are modified at high energies, which leads to modifications of\nequations of motion. In this paper, we use the Hamilton-Jacobi method to\ninvestigate the dispersive field theory models. The preferred frame is the\nstatic frame of the black hole. The dispersion relation adopted agrees with the\nrelativistic one at low energies but is modified near the Planck mass $m_{p}$.\nWe calculate the corrections to the Hawking temperature for massive and charged\nparticles to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m_{p}^{-2}\\right) $ and massless and neutral\nparticles to all orders. Our results suggest that the thermal spectrum of\nradiations near horizon is robust, e.g. corrections to the Hawking temperature\nare suppressed by $m_{p}$. After the spectrum of radiations near the horizon is\nobtained, we use the brick wall model to compute the thermal entropy of a\nmassless scalar field near the horizon of a 4D spherically symmetric black\nhole. We find that the leading term of the entropy depends on how the\ndispersion relations of matter fields are modified, while the subleading\nlogarithmic term does not. Finally, the luminosities of black holes are\ncomputed by using the geometric optics approximation.\n", "  Small-scale dark matter structure within the Milky Way is expected to affect\npulsar timing. The change in gravitational potential induced by a dark matter\nhalo passing near the line of sight to a pulsar would produce a varying delay\nin the light travel time of photons from the pulsar. Individual transits\nproduce an effect that would either be too rare or too weak to be detected in\n30-year pulsar observations. However, a population of dark matter subhalos\nwould be expected to produce a detectable effect on the measured properties of\npulsars if the subhalos constitute a significant fraction of the total halo\nmass. The effect is to increase the dispersion of measured period derivatives\nacross the pulsar population. By statistical analysis of the ATNF pulsar\ncatalogue, we place an upper limit on this dispersion of $\\log \\sigma_{\\dot{P}}\n\\leq -17.05$. We use this to place strong upper limits on the number density of\nultracompact minihalos within the Milky Way. These limits are completely\nindependent of the particle nature of dark matter.\n", "  Ultracompact Minihalos (UCMHs) have been proposed as a type of dark matter\nsub-structure seeded by large-amplitude primordial perturbations and\ntopological defects. UCMHs are expected to survive to the present era, allowing\nconstraints to be placed on their cosmic abundance using observations within\nour own Galaxy. Constraints on their number density can be linked to conditions\nin the early universe that impact structure formation, such as increased\nprimordial power on small scales, generic weak non-Gaussianity, and the\npresence of cosmic strings. We use new constraints on the abundance of UCMHs\nfrom pulsar timing to place generalised limits on the parameters of each of\nthese cosmological scenarios. At some scales, the limits are the strongest to\ndate, exceeding those from dark matter annihilation. Our new limits have the\nadded advantage of being independent of the particle nature of dark matter, as\nthey are based only on gravitational effects.\n", "  One unique feature of quantum mechanics is the Heisenberg uncertainty\nprinciple, which states that the outcomes of two incompatible measurements\ncannot simultaneously achieve arbitrary precision. In an information-theoretic\ncontext of quantum information, the uncertainty principle can be formulated as\nentropic uncertainty relations with two measurements for a quantum bit (qubit)\nin two-dimensional system. New entropic uncertainty relations are studied for a\nhigher-dimensional quantum state with multiple measurements, the uncertainty\nbounds can be tighter than that expected from two measurements settings and\ncannot result from qubits system with or without a quantum memory. Here we\nreport the first room-temperature experimental testing of the entropic\nuncertainty relations with three measurements in a natural three-dimensional\nsolid-state system: the nitrogen-vacancy center in pure diamond. The\nexperimental results confirm the entropic uncertainty relations for multiple\nmeasurements. Our result represents a more precise demonstrating of the\nfundamental uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.\n", "  Interactions of high momentum partons with Quark-Gluon Plasma created in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions provide an excellent tomography tool for this\nnew form of matter. Recent measurements for charged hadrons and unidentified\njets at the LHC show an unexpected flattening of the suppression curves at high\nmomentum, exhibited when either momentum or the collision centrality is\nchanged. Furthermore, a limited data available for B probes indicate a\nqualitatively different pattern, as nearly the same flattening is exhibited for\nthe curves corresponding to two opposite momentum ranges. We here show that the\nexperimentally measured suppression curves are well reproduced by our\ntheoretical predictions, and that the complex suppression patterns are due to\nan interplay of collisional, radiative energy loss and the dead-cone effect.\nFurthermore, for B mesons, we predict that the uniform flattening of the\nsuppression indicated by the limited dataset is in fact valid across the entire\nspan of the momentum ranges, which will be tested by the upcoming experiments.\nOverall, the study presented here, provides a rare opportunity for pQCD theory\nto qualitatively distinguish between the major energy loss mechanisms at the\nsame (nonintuitive) dataset.\n", "  In this paper, we determine thermodynamical quantities for one kind of higher\ndimensional black holes. We take two charged and neutral blackfold which are\nhigher dimension. We investigate the thermodynamical properties of such black\nhole at near horizon. By expanding those metrics around horizon, considering\nperiodicity condition of imaginary time and applying some thermodynamical\nconstraints, we extract stress energy tensor of blackfolds. We compare the\nthermodynamical properties of charged and neutral blackfold. We see here that\nthe stress energy tensor of charged blackfold has brane-tension component in\naddition to thermal properties. Then by knowing that the spacetime of neutral\nblackfold is Ricci-flat and there is a nice relation between Ricci-flat and AdS\nspacetimes we determine the AdS form of Ricci-flat. Also we calculate the\ncorresponding temperature which is satisfied by our previous calculation.\nFinally, we check the phase transition of blackfolds and show that there is not\nany critical point for them. So, the thermodynamical stability of both\nblackfolds will be proven, this result agree with literature.\n", "  \"Active nematics\" are orientationally ordered but apolar fluids composed of\ninteracting constituents individually powered by an internal source of energy.\nWhen activity exceeds a system-size dependent threshold, spatially uniform\nactive apolar fluids undergo a hydrodynamic instability leading to spontaneous\nmacroscopic fluid flow. Here, we show that a special class of spatially\nnon-uniform configurations of such active apolar fluids display laminar (i.e.,\ntime-independent) flow even for arbitrarily small activity. We also show that\ntwo-dimensional active nematics confined on a surface of non-vanishing Gaussian\ncurvature must necessarily experience a non-vanishing active force. This\ngeneral conclusion follows from a key result of differential geometry:\ngeodesics must converge or diverge on surfaces with non-zero Gaussian\ncurvature. We derive the conditions under which such curvature-induced active\nforces generate \"thresholdless flow\" for two-dimensional curved shells. We then\nextend our analysis to bulk systems and show how to induce thresholdless active\nflow by controlling the curvature of confining surfaces, external fields, or\nboth. The resulting laminar flow fields are determined analytically in three\nexperimentally realizable configurations that exemplify this general\nphenomenon: i) toroidal shells with planar alignment, ii) a cylinder with\nnon-planar boundary conditions, and iii) a \"Frederiks cell\" that functions like\na pump without moving parts. Our work suggests a robust design strategy for\nactive microfluidic chips and could be tested with the recently discovered\n\"living liquid crystals\".\n", "  In this paper we present a protocol for the implementation of a\npositive-operator-valued measure (POVM) on massive fermionic qubits. We present\nmethods for implementing non-dispersive qubit transport, spin rotations and\nspin polarizing beam-splitter operations. Our scheme attains linear optics-like\ncontrol of the spatial extent of the qubits by considering groundstate\nelectrons trapped in the minima of surface acoustic waves in semiconductor\nheterostructures. Furthermore, we numerically simulate a high-fidelity POVM\nthat carries out Procrustean entanglement distillation in the framework of our\nscheme, using experimentally realistic potentials. Our protocol can be applied,\nnot only to pure ensembles with particle pairs of known identical entanglement,\nbut also to realistic ensembles of particle pairs with a distribution of\nentanglement entropies. This paper provides an experimentally realisable design\nfor future quantum technologies.\n", "  It is possible to model vector-borne infection using the classical\nRoss-Macdonald model. This attempt, however fails in several respects. First,\nusing measured (or estimated) parameters, the model predicts a much greater\nnumber of cases than what is usually observed. Second, the model predicts a\nsingle huge outbreaks that is followed after decades of much smaller outbreaks.\nThis is not what is observed. Usually towns or cities report a number of cases\nthat recur for many years, even when environmental changes cannot explain the\ndisappearance of the infection in-between the peaks. In this paper we continue\nto examine the pitfalls in modeling this class of infections, and explain that,\nin fact, if properly used, the Ross-Macdonald model works, can be used to\nunderstand the patterns of epidemics and even, to some extents, to make some\npredictions. We model several outbreaks of dengue fever and show that the\nvariable pattern of year recurrence (or absence of it) can be understood and\nexplained by a simple Ross-Macdonald model modified to take into account human\nmovement across a range of neighborhoods inside a city. In addition, we analyze\nthe effect of seasonal variations in the parameters determining the number,\nlongevity and biting behavior of mosquitoes. Based on the size of the first\noutbreak, we show that it is possible to estimate the proportion of the\nremaining susceptibles and predict the likelihood and magnitude of eventual\nsubsequent outbreaks. The approach is exemplified by actual dengue outbreaks\nwith different recurrence patterns from some Brazilian regions.\n", "  Since the pioneering discovery of molecular resonances in the 12C+12C\nreaction more than half a century ago a great deal of research work has been\nundertaken in alpha clustering. Our knowledge on physics of nuclear molecules\nhas increased considerably and nuclear clustering remains one of the most\nfruitful domains of nuclear physics, facing some of the greatest challenges and\nopportunities in the years ahead. The occurrence of \"exotic\" shapes and\nBose-Einstein alpha condensates in light N=Z alpha-conjugate nuclei is\ninvestigated. Various approaches of the superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands\nassociated with quasimolecular resonant structures are presented. Evolution of\nclustering from stability to the drip-lines is examined: clustering aspects\nare, in particular, discussed for light exotic nuclei with large neutron excess\nsuch as neutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectroscopy.\n", "  Using ultra-high quality SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells at millikelvin\ntemperatures, we experimentally compare the energy-averaged effective mass,\n$m$, with that at the Fermi level, $m_F$, and verify that the behaviours of\nthese measured values are qualitatively different. With decreasing electron\ndensity (or increasing interaction strength), the mass at the Fermi level\nmonotonically increases in the entire range of electron densities, while the\nenergy-averaged mass saturates at low densities. The qualitatively different\nbehaviour reveals a precursor to the interaction-induced single-particle\nspectrum flattening at the Fermi level in this electron system.\n", "  In this study, we consider one-dimension (1D) quantum spin systems with the\ntranslation and discrete symmetries (spin reversal, space inversion and time\nreversal symmetries). By combining the continuous U(1) symmetry with the\ndiscrete symmetries and using the extended Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem\n\\cite{Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-1961}\\cite{Nomura-Morishige-Isoyama-2015}, we\ninvestigate the relation between the ground states, energy spectra and\nsymmetries. For half-integer spin cases, we generalize the dimer and N\\'eel\nconcepts using the discrete symmetries, and we can reconcile the LSM theorem\nwith the dimer or N\\'eel states, since there was a subtle dilemma. Furthermore,\na part of discrete symmetries is enough to classify possible phases. Thus we\ncan deepen our understanding of the relation between the LSM theorem and the\ndiscrete symmetries.\n", "  A class of exact infinitesimal renormalization group transformations is\nproposed and studied. These transformations are pure changes of variables\n(i.e., no integration or elimination of some degrees of freedom is required)\nsuch that a saddle point approximation is more accurate, becoming, in some\ncases asymptotically exact as the transformations are iterated. The formalism\nprovides a simplified and unified approach to several known renormalization\ngroups. It also suggests some new ways in which renormalization group methods\nmight successfully be applied. In particular, an exact gauge covariant\nrenormalization group transformation is constructed. Solutions for a scalar\nfield theory are obtained both as an expansion in {\\epsilon}=4-d and as an\nexpansion in a single coupling constant.\n", "  The present solar cycle is particular in many aspects: it had a delayed\nrising phase, it is the weakest of the last 100 years, and it presents two\npeaks separated by more than one year. To understand the impact of these\ncharacteristics on the solar chromosphere and coronal dynamics, images from a\nwide wavelength range are needed. In this work we use the 17~GHz radio\ncontinuum, formed in the upper chromosphere and the EUV lines 304 and\n171~{\\AA}, that come from the transition region (He II) and the corona (Fe IX,\nX), respectively. We analyze daily images at 304 and 171~{\\AA} obtained by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The 17~GHz maps were obtained by the\nNobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). To construct synoptic limb charts, we\ncalculated the mean emission of delimited limb areas with 100\" wide and angular\nseparation of $5^\\circ$. At the equatorial region, the results show an\nhemispheric asymmetry of the solar activity. The northern hemisphere dominance\nis coincident with the first sunspot number peak, whereas the second peak\noccurs concurrently with the increase in the activity at the south. The polar\nemission reflects the presence of coronal holes at both EUV wavelengths,\nmoreover, the 17~GHz polar brightenings can be associated with the coronal\nholes. Until 2013, both EUV coronal holes and radio polar brightenings were\nmore predominant at the south pole. Since then they have not been apparent in\nthe north, but thus appear in the beginning of 2015 in the south as observed in\nthe synoptic charts. This work strengthens the association between coronal\nholes and the 17~GHz polar brightenings as it is evident in the synoptic limb\ncharts, in agreement with previous case study papers. The enhancement of the\nradio brightness in coronal holes is explained by the presence of bright\npatches closely associated with the presence of intense unipolar magnetic\nfields.\n", "  It has long been known that environment has a large effect on star formation\nin galaxies. There are several known plausible mechanisms to remove the cool\ngas needed for star formation, such as strangulation, harassment and\nram-pressure stripping.It is unclear which process is dominant, and over what\nrange of stellar mass. In this paper, we find evidence for suppression of the\ncross-correlation function between massive galaxies and less massive\nstar-forming galaxies, giving a measure of how less likely a galaxy is to be\nstar-forming in the vicinity of a more massive galaxy. We develop a formalism\nfor modelling environmental quenching mechanisms within the Halo Occupation\nDistribution scheme. We find that at $z \\sim 2$ environment is not a\nsignificant factor in determining quenching of star-forming galaxies, and that\ngalaxies are quenched with similar probabilities when they are satellites in\nsub-group environments, as they are globally. However, by $z \\sim 0.5$ galaxies\nare much less likely to be star forming when in a high density (group or\nlow-mass cluster) environment than when not. This increased probability of\nbeing quenched does not appear to have significant radial dependence within the\nhalo at lower redshifts, supportive of the quenching being caused by the\nhalting of fresh inflows of pristine gas, as opposed to by tidal stripping.\nFurthermore, by separating the massive sample into passive and star-forming, we\nsee that this effect is further enhanced when the central galaxy is passive, a\nmanifestation of galactic conformity.\n", "  We demonstrate the irreversibility of asymptotic entanglement manipulation\nunder quantum operations that completely preserve the positivity of partial\ntranspose (PPT), resolving a major open problem in quantum information theory.\nOur key tool is a new efficiently computable additive lower bound for the\nasymptotic relative entropy of entanglement with respect to PPT states, which\ncan be used to evaluate the entanglement cost under local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC). We find that for any rank-two mixed state\nsupporting on the $3\\otimes3$ antisymmetric subspace, the amount of distillable\nentanglement by PPT operations is strictly smaller than one entanglement bit\n(ebit) while its entanglement cost under PPT operations is exactly one ebit. As\nbyproduct, we find that for this class of states, both the Rains' bound and its\nregularization, are strictly less than the asymptotic relative entropy of\nentanglement. So, in general, there is no unique entanglement measure for the\nmanipulation of entanglement by PPT operations. We further show a computable\nsufficient condition for the irreversibility of entanglement distillation by\nLOCC (or PPT) operations.\n", "  We consider a system consisting of a strongly interacting, ultracold unitary\nFermi gas under harmonic confinement. Our analysis suggests the possibility of\nexperimentally studying, in this system, an anisotropic shear viscosity tensor\ndriven by the anisotropy in the trapping potential. In particular, we suggest\nthat this experimental setup could mimic some features of anisotropic\ngeometries that have recently been studied for strongly coupled field theories\nwhich have a gravitational dual. Results using the AdS/CFT correspondence in\nthese theories show that in systems with a background linear potential, certain\nviscosity components can be made much smaller than the entropy density,\nparametrically violating the bound proposed by Kovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS).\nThis intuition, along with results from a Boltzmann analysis that we perform,\nsuggests that a violation of the KSS bound can perhaps occur in the unitary\nFermi gas system when it is subjected to a suitable anisotropic trapping\npotential which may be approximated to be linear in a suitable range of\nparameters.\n  We give a concrete proposal for an experimental setup where an anisotropic\nshear viscosity tensor may arise. In such situations, it may also be possible\nto observe a reduction in the spin one component of the shear viscosity from\nits lowest value observed so far in ultracold Fermi gases. In extreme\nanisotropic situations, the reduction may be enough to reduce the shear\nviscosity to entropy ratio below the proposed KSS bound, although this regime\nis difficult to analyze in a theoretically controlled manner.\n", "  We study a topological superconductor island with spatially separated\nMajorana modes coupled to multiple normal metal leads by single electron\ntunneling in the Coulomb blockade regime. We show that low-temperature\ntransport in such Majorana island is carried by an emergent charge-$e$ boson\ncomposed of a Majorana mode and an electron from the leads. This transmutation\nfrom Fermi to Bose statistics has remarkable consequences. For noninteracting\nleads, the system flows to a non-Fermi liquid fixed point, which is stable\nagainst tunnel couplings anisotropy or detuning away from the charge-degeneracy\npoint. As a result, the system exhibits a universal conductance at zero\ntemperature, which is a fraction of the conductance quantum, and\nlow-temperature corrections with a universal power-law exponent. In addition,\nwe consider Majorana islands connected to interacting one-dimensional leads,\nand find different stable fixed points near and far from the charge-degeneracy\npoint.\n", "  Knowledge on nuclear cluster physics has increased considerably since the\npioneering discovery of 12C+12C resonances half a century ago and nuclear\nclustering remains one of the most fruitful domains of nuclear physics, facing\nsome of the greatest challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. The\noccurrence of \"exotic\" shapes and/or Bose-Einstein alpha condensates in light\nN-Z alpha-conjugate nuclei is investigated. Evolution of clustering from\nstability to the drip-lines examined with clustering aspects persisting in\nlight neutron-rich nuclei is consistent with the extension of the\n\"Ikeda-diagram\" to non alpha-conjugate nuclei.\n", "  Gapless bilayer graphene is susceptible to a variety of spontaneously gapped\nstates. As predicted by theory and observed by experiment, the ground state is\nhowever topologically trivial, because a valley-independent gap is\nenergetically favorable. Here, we show that under the application of interlayer\nelectric field and circularly polarized light, one valley can be selected to\nexhibit the original interaction instability while the other is frozen out.\nTuning this Floquet system stabilizes multiple competing topological ordered\nstates, distinguishable by edge transport and circular dichroism. Notably,\nquantized charge, spin, and valley Hall conductivities coexist in one\nstabilized state.\n", "  We find a emergent azimuthal-angle dependency of the Nielsen-Olesen vortices\nin the general relativistic situation just after the symmetry breaking at\nGUT-scale. Using a high-frequency perturbation method, we obtain in the first\nand second order perturbation equations $\\varphi$-dependent terms left over\nafter the phase transition of the Higgs field. Vortices with high multiplicity\ndecay into a lattice with entangled Abrikosov vortices. The stability of this\nlattice of correlated flux $n=1$ vortices with preferred azimuthal-angle is\nguaranteed by the contribution from the bulk spacetime by means of the warp\nfactor: the cosmic string becomes super-massive for some time during the\nevolution and initiates the excitations of the vortices to high multiplicity.\nThe correlation will not fade away during the expansion by the warp factor. We\nused this azimuthal-angle correlation for the explanation of the recently\nobserved alignment of polarization axes of quasars in large quasar groups. The\ndetailed behavior of this alignment can be explained with our model. The two\ndifferent orientations perpendicular to each other in quasars groups of less\nrichness could be a second order effect in our model. There is a striking\nsimilarity between this phase transition of the gauged Higgs field and the\ntemporarily breaking of the axially symmetry of self-gravitating cosmic string,\nby the appearance of non-diagonal energy-momentum tensor components. The\neccentricity of the ellipsoid can be seen as order parameter. Recovery to SO(2)\nsymmetry induces emission of gravitational and electro-magnetic radiation. More\ndata of high-redshift quasars will be needed in order to test the second order\neffect predicted in our model.\n", "  In the unified scheme of active galactic nuclei, a dusty torus absorbs and\nthen reprocesses a fraction of the intrinsic luminosity which is emitted at\nlonger wavelengths. Thus, subject to radiative transfer corrections, the\nfraction of the sky covered by the torus as seen from the central source (known\nas the covering factor $f_c$) can be estimated from the ratio of the infrared\nto the bolometric luminosities of the source as $f_c=L_{\\rm torus}/L_{\\rm\nBol}$. However, the uncertainty in determining $L_{\\rm Bol}$ has made the\nestimation of covering factors by this technique difficult, especially for AGN\nin the local Universe where the peak of the observed SEDs lies in the UV\n(ultraviolet). Here, we determine the covering factors of an X-ray/optically\nselected sample of 51 type~1 AGN. The bolometric luminosities of these sources\nare derived using a self-consistent, energy-conserving model that estimates the\ncontribution in the unobservable far-UV region, using multi-frequency data\nobtained from SDSS, \\textit{XMM-Newton}, \\textit{WISE}, 2MASS and UKIDSS. We\nderive a mean value of $f_c\\sim$0.30 with a dispersion of 0.17. Sample\ncorrelations, combined with simulations, show that $f_c$ is more strongly\nanti-correlated with $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ than with $L_{\\rm Bol}$. This points\nto large-scale torus geometry changes associated with the Eddington-dependent\naccretion flow, rather than a receding torus, with its inner sublimation radius\ndetermined solely by heating from the central source. Furthermore, we do not\nsee any significant change in the distribution of $f_c$ for sub-samples of\nradio-loud sources or Narrow Line Seyfert~1 galaxies (NLS1s), though these\nsub-samples are small.\n", "  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a NASA Astrophysics\nExplorer mission. Following its scheduled launch in 2017, TESS will focus on\ndetecting exoplanets around the nearest and brightest stars in the sky, for\nwhich detailed follow-up observations are possible. TESS will, as the NASA\nKepler mission, include a asteroseismic program that will be organized within\nthe TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium (TASC), building on the success of\nthe Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). Within TASC data for\nasteroseismic analysis will be prepared by the TASC Working Group 0 (WG-0), who\nwill facilitate data to the community via the TESS Asteroseismic Science\nOperations Center (TASOC), again building on the success of the corresponding\nKASOC platform for Kepler. Here, we give an overview of the steps being taken\nwithin WG-0 to prepare for the upcoming TESS mission.\n", "  We study micromotion in two-dimensional periodically driven systems in which\nall bulk Floquet eigenstates are localized by disorder. We show that this\nmicromotion gives rise to a quantized time-averaged magnetization density when\nthe system is filled with fermions. Furthermore we find that a quantized\ncurrent flows around the boundary of any filled region of finite extent. The\nquantization has a topological origin: we relate the time-averaged\nmagnetization density to the winding number characterizing the new phase\nidentified in Phys. Rev. X 6, 021013 (2016). We thus establish that the winding\nnumber invariant can be accessed directly in bulk measurements, and propose an\nexperimental protocol to do so using interferometry in cold atom based\nrealizations.\n", "  This paper considers a model consisting of a kinetic term, Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling and short-range Coulomb interaction at zero-temperature. The Coulomb\ninteraction is decoupled by a mean-field approximation in the spin channel\nusing field theory methods. The results feature a first-order phase transition\nfor any finite value of the chemical potential and quantum criticality for\nvanishing chemical potential. The Hall conductivity is also computed using Kubo\nformula in a mean-field effective Hamiltonian. In the limit of infinite mass\nthe kinetic term vanishes and all the phase transitions are of second order, in\nthis case spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism adds a ferromagnetic metallic\nphase to the system and features a zero-temperature quantization of the Hall\nconductivity in the insulating one.\n", "  The upcoming NASA TESS mission will perform an all-sky survey for planets\ntransiting bright nearby stars. In addition, its excellent photometric\nprecision will enable asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant stars. We\napply a newly developed detection test along a sequence of stellar evolutionary\ntracks in order to predict the detectability of solar-like oscillations with\nTESS.\n", "  Stellar evolution codes play a major role in present-day astrophysics, yet\nthey share common issues. In this work we seek to remedy some of those by the\nuse of results from realistic and highly detailed 3D hydrodynamical simulations\nof stellar atmospheres. We have implemented a new temperature stratification\nextracted directly from the 3D simulations into the Garching Stellar Evolution\nCode to replace the simplified atmosphere normally used. Secondly, we have\nimplemented the use of a variable mixing-length parameter, which changes as a\nfunction of the stellar surface gravity and temperature -- also derived from\nthe 3D simulations. Furthermore, to make our models consistent, we have\ncalculated new opacity tables to match the atmospheric simulations. Here, we\npresent the modified code and initial results on stellar evolution using it.\n", "  Most of the information we have about the internal rotation of stars comes\nfrom modes that are weakly affected by rotation, for example by using\nrotational splittings. In contrast, we present here a method, based on the\nasymptotic theory of Prat et al. (2016), which allows us to analyse the\nsignature of rotation where its effect is the most important, that is in\nlow-frequency gravity modes that are strongly affected by rotation. For such\nmodes, we predict two spectral patterns that could be confronted to observed\nspectra and those computed using fully two-dimensional oscillation codes.\n", "  Understanding the internal rotation of low mass stars all along their\nevolution is of primary interest when studying their rotational dynamics,\ninternal mixing and magnetic field generation. In this context, helio- and\nasteroseismology probe angular velocity gradients deep within solar type stars\nat different evolutionary stages. Still the rotation close to the center of\nsuch stars on the main sequence is hardly detectable and the dynamical\ninteraction of the radiative core with the surface convective envelope is not\nwell understood. For instance, the influence of the differential rotation\nprofile sustained by convection and applied as a boundary condition to the\nradiation zone is very important in the formation of tachoclines. In this work,\nwe study a 2D hydrodynamical model of a radiative core when an imposed, solar\nor anti-solar, differential rotation is applied at the upper boundary. This\nmodel uses the Boussinesq approximation and we find that the shear induces a\ncylindrical differential rotation associated with a unique cell of meridional\ncirculation in each hemisphere (counterclockwise when the shear is solar-like\nand clockwise when it is anti-solar). The results are discussed in the\nframework of seismic observables (internal rotation rate, core-to-surface\nrotation ratio) while perspectives to improve our modeling by including\nmagnetic field or transport by internal gravity waves will be discussed.\n", "  A period of quenching between the formation of the thick and thin disks of\nthe Milky Way has been recently proposed to explain the observed\nage-[{\\alpha}/Fe] distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood. However,\nrobust constraints on stellar ages are currently available for only a limited\nnumber of stars. The all-sky survey TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite) will observe the brightest stars in the sky and thus can be used to\ninvestigate the age distributions of stars in these components of the Galaxy\nvia asteroseismology, where previously this has been difficult using other\ntechniques. The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether TESS\nwill be able to provide evidence for quenching periods during the star\nformation history of the Milky Way. Using a population synthesis code, we\nproduced populations based on various stellar formation history models and\nlimited the analysis to red-giant-branch stars. We investigated the\nmass-Galactic-disk-height distributions, where stellar mass was used as an age\nproxy, to test for whether periods of quenching can be observed by TESS. We\nfound that even with the addition of 15% noise to the inferred masses, it will\nbe possible for TESS to find evidence for/against quenching periods suggested\nin the literature (e.g. between 7 and 9 Gyr ago), therefore providing stringent\nconstraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.\n", "  Stellar oscillations give seismic information on the internal properties of\nstars. Red giants are targets of interest since they present mixed modes, which\nbehave as pressure modes in the convective envelope and as gravity modes in the\nradiative core. Mixed modes thus directly probe red giant cores, and allow in\nparticular the study of their mean core rotation. The high-quality data\nobtained by CoRoT and Kepler satellites represent an unprecedented perspective\nto obtain thousands of measurements of red giant core rotation, in order to\nimprove our understanding of stellar physics in deep stellar interiors. We\ndeveloped an automated method to obtain such core rotation measurements and\nvalidated it for stars on the red giant branch. In this work, we particularly\nfocus on the specific application of this method to red giants having a rapid\ncore rotation. They show complex spectra where it is tricky to disentangle\nrotational splittings from mixed-mode period spacings. We demonstrate that the\nmethod based on the identification of mode crossings is precise and efficient.\nThe determination of the mean core rotation directly derives from the precise\nmeasurement of the asymptotic period spacing {\\Delta}{\\Pi}1 and of the\nfrequency at which the crossing of the rotational components is observed.\n", "  We determined on the temperature-pressure-magnetic field ($T$-$p$-$H$) phase\ndiagram of the ferromagnet LaCrGe$_3$ from electrical resistivity measurements\non single crystals. In ferromagnetic systems, quantum criticality is avoided\neither by a change of the transition order, becoming of the first order at a\ntricritical point, or by the appearance of modulated magnetic phases. In the\nfirst case, the application of a magnetic field reveals a wing-structure phase\ndiagram as seen in itinerant ferromagnets such as ZrZn$_2$ and UGe$_2$. In the\nsecond case, no tricritical wings have been observed so far. Our investigation\nof LaCrGe$_3$ reveals a double-wing structure indicating strong similarities\nwith ZrZn$_2$ and UGe$_2$. But, unlike these, simpler systems, LaCrGe$_3$ is\nthought to exhibit a modulated magnetic phase under pressure which already\nprecludes it from a pressure-driven paramagnetic-ferromagnetic quantum phase\ntransition in zero field. As a result, the $T$-$p$-$H$ phase diagram of\nLaCrGe$_3$ shows both the wing structure as well as the appearance of new\nmagnetic phases, providing the first example of this new possibility for the\nphase diagram of metallic quantum ferromagnets.\n", "  The unparalleled photometric data obtained by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope\nhas led to an improved understanding of stellar structure and evolution - in\nparticular for solar-like oscillators in this context. Binary stars are\nfascinating objects. Because they were formed together, binary systems provide\na set of two stars with very well constrained parameters. Those can be used to\nstudy properties and physical processes, such as the stellar rotation, dynamics\nand rotational mixing of elements and allows us to learn from the differences\nwe find between the two components. In this work, we discussed a detailed study\nof the binary system KIC9163796, discovered through Kepler photometry. The\nground-based follow-up spectroscopy showed that this system is a double-lined\nspectroscopic binary, with a mass ratio close to unity. However, the\nfundamental parameters of the components of this system as well as their\nlithium abundances differ substantially. Kepler photometry of this system\nallows to perform a detailed seismic analysis as well as to derive the orbital\nperiod and the surface rotation rate of the primary component of the system.\nIndications of the seismic signature of the secondary are found. The differing\nparameters are best explained with both components located in the early and the\nlate phase of the first dredge up at the bottom of the red-giant branch.\nObserved lithium abundances in both components are in good agreement with\nprediction of stellar models including rotational mixing. By combining\nobservations and theory, a comprehensive picture of the system can be drawn.\n", "  The gamma strength function and level density of 1- states in 96Mo have been\nextracted from a high-resolution study of the (p,p') reaction at 295 MeV and\nextreme forward angles. By comparison with compound nucleus $\\gamma$ decay\nexperiments, this allows a test of the generalized Brink-Axel hypothesis in the\nenergy region of the Pygmy Dipole Resonance. The Brink-Axel hypothesis is\ncommonly assumed in astrophysical reaction network calculations and states that\nthe gamma strength function in nuclei is independent of the structure of\ninitial and final state. The present results validiate the Brink-Axel\nhypothesis for 96Mo and provide independent confirmation of the methods used to\nseparate gamma strength function and level density in $\\gamma$ decay\nexperiments.\n", "  The BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) Constellation is the first nanosatellite\nmission applied to astrophysical research. Five satellites in low-Earth orbits\nperform precise optical two-colour photometry of the brightest stars in the\nnight sky. BRITE is naturally well suited for variability studies of hot stars.\nThis contribution describes the basic outline of the mission and some initial\nproblems that needed to be overcome. Some information on BRITE data products,\nhow to access them, and how to join their scientific exploration is provided.\nFinally, a brief summary of the first scientific results obtained by BRITE is\ngiven.\n", "  Sun-as-a star observations put our star as a reference for stellar\nobservations. Here, I review the activities in which the SPACEINN global\nseismology team (Working Package WP4.1) has worked during the past 3 years. In\nparticular, we will explain the new deliverables available on the SPACEINN\nseismic+ portal. Moreover, special attention will be given to surface dynamics\n(rotation and magnetic fields). After characterizing the rotation and the\nmagnetic properties of around 300 solar-like stars and defining proper metrics\nfor that, we use their seismic properties to characterize 18 solar analogues\nfor which we study their surface magnetic and seismic properties. This allows\nus to put the Sun into context compared to its siblings.\n", "  On October 20, 2016, Daesh (Islamic State) set fire to the sulphur production\nsite Al-Mishraq as the battle of Mosul in northern Iraq became more intense. An\nextensive plume of toxic sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide caused\ncomprehensive casualties. The intensity of the SO2 release was reaching levels\nof minor volcanic eruptions and the plume was observed by several satellites.\nBy investigation of the measurement data from instruments on the MetOp-A,\nMetOp-B, Aura and Soumi satellites we have estimated the time-dependent source\nterm to 161 kilotonnes sulphur dioxide released into the atmosphere during\nseven days. A long-range dispersion model was utilized to simulate the\natmospheric transport over the Middle East. The ground level concentrations\npredicted by the simulation were compared with observation from the Turkey\nNational Air Quality Monitoring Network. Finally, the simulation data provided,\nusing a probit analysis of the simulated data, an estimate of the health risk\narea that was compared to reported urgent medical treatments.\n  This article has been published in Atmospheric Environment, see cross link\nbelow.\n", "  Nuclear fusion reactions are the most important processes in nature to power\nstars and produce new elements, and lie at the center of the understanding of\nnucleosynthesis in the universe. It is critically important to study the\nreactions in full plasma environments that are close to true astrophysical\nconditions. By using laser-driven counter-streaming collisionless plasmas, we\nstudied the fusion D$+$D$\\rightarrow n +^3$He in a Gamow-like window around 27\nkeV. The results show that astrophysical nuclear reaction yield can be\nmodulated significantly by the self-generated electromagnetic fields and the\ncollective motion of the plasma. This plasma-version mini-collider may provide\na novel tool for studies of astrophysics-interested nuclear reactions in plasma\nwith tunable energies in earth-based laboratories.\n", "  The Kepler mission has been a success in both exoplanet search and stellar\nphysics studies. Red giants have actually been quite a highlight in the Kepler\nscene. The Kepler long and almost continuous four-year observations allowed us\nto detect oscillations in more than 15,000 red giants targeted by the mission.\nHowever by looking at the power spectra of 45,000 stars classified as dwarfs\naccording to the Q1-16 Kepler star properties catalog, we detected red-giant\nlike oscillations in 850 stars. Even though this is a small addition to the\nknown red-giant sample, these misclassified stars represent a goldmine for\ngalactic archeology studies. Indeed they happen to be fainter (down to Kp~16)\nand more distant (d>10kpc) than the known red giants, opening the possibility\nto probe unknown regions of our Galaxy. The faintness of these red giants with\ndetected oscillations is very promising for detecting acoustic modes in red\ngiants observed with K2 and TESS. In this talk, I will present this new sample\nof red giants with their revised stellar parameters derived from\nasteroseismology. Then I will discuss about the distribution of their masses,\ndistances, and evolutionary states compared to the previously known sample of\nred giants.\n", "  The first asteroseismic studies of pre-main sequence (pre-MS) pulsators have\nbeen conducted based on data from the space telescopes MOST and CoRoT with\ntypical time bases of less than 40 days. With these data, a relation between\nthe pulsational properties of pre-MS delta Scuti stars and their relative\nevolutionary phase on their way from the birthline to the zero-age main\nsequence was revealed. But it is evident from comparison with the more evolved\npulsators in their main sequence or post-main sequence stages observed by the\nmain Kepler mission, that many more questions could be addressed with\nsignificantly longer time bases and ultra-high precision. Here, I will discuss\nthe observational status of pre-MS asteroseismology and the potential of future\nspace observations for this research field.\n", "  The detection and analysis of oscillations in binary star systems is critical\nin understanding stellar structure and evolution. This is partly because such\nsystems have the same initial chemical composition and age. Solar-like\noscillations have been detected by Kepler in both components of the\nasteroseismic binary HD 176465. We present an independent modelling of each\nstar in this binary system. Stellar models generated using MESA (Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics) were fitted to both the observed\nindividual frequencies and complementary spectroscopic parameters. The\nindividual theoretical oscillation frequencies for the corresponding stellar\nmodels were obtained using GYRE as the pulsation code. A Bayesian approach was\napplied to find the probability distribution functions of the stellar\nparameters using AIMS (Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale) as the\noptimisation code. The ages of HD 176465 A and HD 176465 B were found to be\n2.81 $\\pm$ 0.48 Gyr and 2.52 $\\pm$ 0.80 Gyr, respectively. These results are in\nagreement when compared to previous studies carried out using other\nasteroseismic modelling techniques and gyrochronology.\n", "  Starspots are cooler and darker than the stellar surface. Therefore, the\nemitted flux of a star changes when spots are visible on its surface. The\npresence of spots together with the stellar rotation leads to a periodic\nmodulation on the light curve. By studying that modulation one can then learn\nabout the stellar rotation and also magnetic activity. Recently, Reinhold &\nArlt (2015) proposed a method based on the analysis of the Lomb Scargle\nperiodogram of the light curve to identify the sign of the differential\nrotation, i.e. whether the equator rotates faster than the poles or the\nopposite. We have been studying in detail the spots' impact on the light curve\nand on the resulting periodogram. We find that, under some conditions, the\nperiodogram can actually provide an estimate of the true spot latitudes and/or\nthe stellar inclination angle. Moreover, we find that the impact of the spot on\nthe ratio between the heights of the second and first harmonics of the main\npeaks in the periodogram can be described by a single parameter, the visibility\ntime of the spot. Finally, we also identify possible sources of false\npositives/negatives for the sign of the differential rotation.\n", "  The activity-related variations in the solar acoustic frequencies have been\nknown for 30 years. However, the importance of the different contributions is\nstill not well established. With this in mind, we developed an empirical model\nto estimate the spot-induced frequency shifts, which takes into account the\nsunspot properties, such as area and latitude. The comparison between the model\nfrequency shifts obtained from the daily sunspot records and those observed\nsuggests that the contribution from a stochastic component to the total\nfrequency shifts is about 30%. The remaining 70% is related to a global,\nlong-term variation. We also propose a new observable to investigate the short-\nand mid-term variations of the frequency shifts, which is insensitive to the\nlong-term variations contained in the data. On the shortest time scales the\nvariations in the frequency shifts are strongly correlated with the variations\nin the total area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of\ncorrelation is still found, which cannot be fully explained by ignoring the\ninvisible side of the Sun when accounting for the total sunspot area. We also\nverify that the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot areas do not\nvary in a similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maximum amplitude\nof the quasi-biennial variations found in the seismic data.\n", "  Boson Sampling has emerged as a tool to explore the advantages of quantum\nover classical computers as it does not require a universal control over the\nquantum system, which favours current photonic experimental platforms.Here, we\nintroduce Gaussian Boson Sampling, a classically hard-to-solve problem that\nuses squeezed states as a non-classical resource. We relate the probability to\nmeasure specific photon patterns from a general Gaussian state in the Fock\nbasis to a matrix function called the hafnian, which answers the last remaining\nquestion of sampling from Gaussian states. Based on this result, we design\nGaussian Boson Sampling, a #P hard problem, using squeezed states. This\napproach leads to a more efficient photonic boson sampler with significant\nadvantages in generation probability and measurement time over currently\nexisting protocols.\n", "  Two schemes are presented that mitigate the effect of errors and decoherence\nin short depth quantum circuits. The size of the circuits for which these\ntechniques can be applied is limited by the rate at which the errors in the\ncomputation are introduced. Near-term applications of early quantum devices,\nsuch as quantum simulations, rely on accurate estimates of expectation values\nto become relevant. Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the\nexpectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two\nschemes we discuss are deliberately simple and don't require additional qubit\nresources, so to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible.\nThe first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels\npowers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred\napproach to the limit. The second method cancels errors by resampling\nrandomized circuits according to a quasi-probability distribution.\n", "  Gravitational wave templates used in current searches for binary black holes\nomit the effects of precession of the orbital plane and higher order modes.\nWhile this omission seems not to impact the detection of sources having mass\nratios and spins similar to those of GW150914, even for total masses $M >\n200M_{\\odot}$; we show that it can cause large fractional losses of sensitive\nvolume for binaries with mass ratio $q \\geq 4$ and $M>100M_{\\odot}$, measured\nthe detector frame. For the highest precessing cases, this is true even when\nthe source is face-on to the detector. Quantitatively, we show that the\naforementioned omission can lead to fractional losses of sensitive volume of\n$\\sim15\\%$, reaching $>25\\%$ for the worst cases studied. Loss estimates are\nobtained by evaluating the effectualness of the SEOBNRv2-ROM double spin model,\ncurrently used in binary black hole searches, towards gravitational wave\nsignals from precessing binaries computed by means of numerical relativity. We\nconclude that, for sources with $q \\geq 4$, a reliable search for binary black\nholes heavier than $M>100M_\\odot$ needs to consider the effects of higher order\nmodes and precession. The latter seems specially necessary when Advanced LIGO\nreaches its design sensitivity.\n", "  Asteroseismology of non-radial pulsations in Hot B Subdwarfs (sdB stars)\noffers a unique view into the interior of core-helium-burning stars.\nGround-based and space-borne high precision light curves allow for the analysis\nof pressure and gravity mode pulsations to probe the structure of sdB stars\ndeep into the convective core. As such asteroseismological analysis provides an\nexcellent opportunity to test our understanding of stellar evolution. In light\nof the newest constraints from asteroseismology of sdB and red clump stars,\nstandard approaches of convective mixing in 1D stellar evolution models are\ncalled into question. The problem lies in the current treatment of overshooting\nand the entrainment at the convective boundary. Unfortunately no consistent\nalgorithm of convective mixing exists to solve the problem, introducing\nuncertainties to the estimates of stellar ages. Three dimensional simulations\nof stellar convection show the natural development of an overshooting region\nand a boundary layer. In search for a consistent prescription of convection in\none dimensional stellar evolution models, guidance from three dimensional\nsimulations and asteroseismological results is indispensable.\n", "  In massive stars, rotation and oscillatory waves can have a tight interplay.\nIn order to assess the importance of additional angular momentum transport\nmechanisms other than rotation, we compare the asteroseismic properties of a\nuniformly rotating model and a differentially rotating one. Accordingly, we\nemploy the observed period spacing of 36 dipole g-modes in the Kepler $\\sim3.2$\nM$_\\odot$ target KIC 7760680 to discriminate between these two models. We favor\nthe uniformly rotating model, which fully satisfies all observational\nconstraints. Therefore, efficient angular momentum transport by additional\nmechanisms such as internal gravity waves, heat-driven modes and magnetic field\nis needed during early main sequence evolution of massive stars.\n", "  We employ phase-sensitive amplification to perform homodyne detection of the\nresonance fluorescence from a driven superconducting artificial atom.\nEntanglement between the emitter and its fluorescence allows us to track the\nindividual quantum state trajectories of the emitter conditioned on the\noutcomes of the field measurements. We analyze the ensemble properties of these\ntrajectories by considering trajectories that connect specific initial and\nfinal states. By applying the stochastic path integral formalism, we calculate\nequations-of-motion for the most likely path between two quantum states and\ncompare these predicted paths to experimental data. Drawing on the mathematical\nsimilarity between the action formalism of the most likely quantum paths and\nray optics we study the emergence of caustics in quantum trajectories---places\nwhere multiple extrema in the stochastic action occur. We observe such multiple\nmost likely paths in experimental data and find these paths to be in reasonable\nquantitative agreement with theoretical calculations.\n", "  We study the dynamics of interacting holographic dark energy model in\nBrans-Dicke cosmology for the future event horizon and the Hubble horizon\ncut-offs. We determine the system of first-order differential equations for the\nfuture event horizon and Hubble horizon cut-offs, and obtain the corresponding\nfixed points, attractors, repellers and saddle points. Finally, we investigate\nthe cosmic coincidence problem in this model for the future event horizon and\nHubble horizon cut-offs and find that for both cut-offs and for a variety of\nBrans-Dicke parameters the coincidence problem is almost resolved.\n", "  We propose the possibility of a new phenomenon affecting the settling of dust\ngrains at the terrestrial region in early protoplanetary disks. Sinking dust\ngrains evaporate in a hot inner region during the early stage of disk\nevolution, and the effects of condensation and evaporation on vertical dust\nsettling can be significant. A 1-D dust settling model considering both\nphysical and chemical aspects is presented in this paper. Modeling results show\nthat dust grains evaporate as they descend into the hotter interior and form a\n\"condensation front,\" above which dust-composing major elements, Mg, Si, and\nFe, accumulate, creating a large temperature gradient. Repeated evaporation at\nthe front inhibits grain growth, and small grain sizes elevate the opacity away\nfrom the mid-plane. Self-consistent calculations including radiative heat\ntransfer and condensation theory suggest that the mid-disk temperature could be\nhigh enough for silicates to remain evaporated longer than previous estimates.\nThe formation of a condensation front leads to contrasting settling behaviors\nbetween highly refractory elements, such as Al and Ca, and moderately\nrefractory elements, such as Mg, Si, and Fe, suggesting that elemental\nabundance in planetesimals may not be a simple function of volatility.\n", "  Toroidally compactified Yang-Mills theory on the lattice is studied by using\nthe Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. When the compact dimensions are small, the\ntheory naturally reduces to Yang-Mills with scalars. We confirm previous\nanalytical and numerical results for pure gauge theory with scalars in (0+1)\ndimensions and at high temperatures to Super-Yang-Mills in (1+1) dimensions. In\n(1+1) dimensions, our simulations confirm the previously conjectured phase\ndiagram. Furthermore, we find evidence for the sequential breaking of the\ncenter symmetry in (1+1) dimensions as a function of the volume. In (3+1)\ndimensions we present first simulation results for the eigenvalue distribution\nof the Polyakov and Wilson loops, finding localized, non-uniform and\ncenter-symmetric configurations as a function of the lattice coupling.\n", "  Characterization of mixed quantum states represented by density operator is\none of the most important task in quantum information processing. In this work\nwe will present a geometric approach to characterize the density operator in\nterms of fiber bundle over a quantum phase space. The geometrical structure of\nthe quantum phase space of an isospectral mixed quantum states can be realized\nas a co-adjoint orbit of a Lie group equipped with a specific K\\\"{a}hler\nstructure.\n  In particular we will briefly discuss the construction of a fiber bundle over\nthe quantum phase space based on symplectic reduction and purification method.\nWe will also show that the map is a Riemannian submersion which enable us to\nprovide some applications of the geometric framework such as geometric phase\nand quantum speed limit.\n", "  Synthesised light sources need reliable diagnostics for effective application\nto sub-femtosecond control and probing. However, commonly employed\nself-referencing techniques for pulsed-field characterisation fail in the\npresence of wide spectral gaps, while direct sampling methods are limited to\nhigh intensities. Here, we introduce a new approach labelled SPectral-gap\nImmune Characterisation of Electric Fields (SPICE), which overcomes these\nbarriers by means of multi-spectral shearing interferometry, using an unknown\nreference and a reconstruction algorithm that makes use of this redundant\ninformation to simultaneously reconstruct the reference and test pulse with\nhigh precision and accuracy. We envisage that this technique will help foster\nnew applications for broadband sources.\n", "  Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Yamada, Tsuchiya, and\nAsada, Phys. Rev. D 91, 124016 (2015)], we reexamine the linear stability of\nthe triangular solution in the relativistic three-body problem for general\nmasses by the standard linear algebraic analysis. In this paper, we start with\nthe Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman form of equations of motion for $N$-body systems in\nthe uniformly rotating frame. As an extension of the previous work, we consider\ngeneral perturbations to the equilibrium, i.e. we take account of perturbations\northogonal to the orbital plane, as well as perturbations lying on it. It is\nfound that the orthogonal perturbations depend on each other by the first\npost-Newtonian (1PN) three-body interactions, though these are independent of\nthe lying ones likewise the Newtonian case. We also show that the orthogonal\nperturbations do not affect the condition of stability. This is because these\nalways precess with two frequency modes; the same with the orbital frequency\nand the slightly different one by the 1PN effect. The same condition of\nstability with the previous one, which is valid even for the general\nperturbations, is obtained from the lying perturbations.\n", "  A previous article argued that the antagonism between sight-lines with and\nwithout a bump at 2200 \\AA\\ disappears, and that the observed properties of\ninterstellar extinction can be globally understood, if it is accepted that\nscattered starlight contaminates the observed spectrum of reddened stars. The\npresent paper develops this new paradigm by providing a better understanding of\nthe characteristics of this scattered light. It further examines the\nconsequences of this revision of interstellar extinction theory for\ninterpreting the 2200 \\AA\\ bump and the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs). Two\nimplications are worth noting: (1) the effect of interstellar extinction on\ncosmic distance estimations needs to be reconsidered; (2) it is unnecessary to\ninvoke hypothetical particles, such as Poly Aromatic Hydrogenated molecules\n(PAHs), to explain the peculiarities of interstellar extinction. Hydrogen, by\nfar the most abundant constituent of interstellar clouds, should alone account\nfor the three major features of interstellar extinction: the departure of the\ncontinuum from linearity, the bump, and the DIBs.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate Josephson scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy in an s-wave superconductor. We demonstrate that the spatial\noscillations in the superconducting order parameter induced by defects can be\nspatially imaged through local measurements of the critical Josephson current,\nproviding unprecedented insight into the nature of superconductivity. The\nspatial form of the Josephson current reflects the nature of the defects, and\ncan be used to probe defect-induced phase transitions from an $S=0$ to an\n$S=1/2$ ground state.\n", "  The long-time photometric surveys in a few young open clusters allowed to\nidentify the light variability in stars located on the HR diagram between the\nwell defined $\\delta$ Scuti variables and Slowly Pulsating B-type stars.\nSeveral objects of this type were suggested also from the analysis of the\nKepler data. Assuming the pulsational origin of this variability, we try to\nexplain the observed frequencies with pulsational models involving rotation\nand/or modification of the mean opacity profile.\n", "  We present the analysis of KIC 7760680, the rotating Slowly Pulsating B-type\nstar identified in the Kepler photometry. The oscillation spectrum of the star\nexhibits a series of 36 frequencies which are quasi-equally spaced in period.\nWe confirm that this series can be associated with prograde dipole modes of\nconsecutive radial orders. In our studies, the effects of rotation were\nincluded in the MESA equilibrium models as well as in the puslational\ncalculations in the framework of the traditional approximation. We find that\npulsational models computed with the OPLIB opacities best reproduce the\nobserved frequency range. The modified opacity data with an enhancement of the\nopacity at $\\log T=5.3$, 5.46 and 5.06 were tested as well. Increasing the\nOPLIB opacities by about 50% at $\\log T=5.3$ is sufficient to excite modes in\nthe whole range of 36 frequency peaks of KIC 7760680.\n", "  The recent observational, theoretical, and numerical progress made in\nunderstanding stellar magnetism is discussed. Particularly, this review will\ncover the physical processes thought to be at the origin of these magnetic\nfields and their variability, namely dynamo action arising from the interaction\nbetween convection, rotation, radiation and magnetic fields. Some care will be\ntaken to cover recent analytical advances regarding the dynamics and magnetism\nof radiative interiors, including some thoughts on the role of a tachocline.\nMoreover, recent and rapidly advancing numerical modeling of convective dynamos\nwill be discussed, looking at rapidly rotating convective systems, grand minima\nand scaling laws for magnetic field strength. These topics are linked to\nobservations or their observational implications.\n", "  The majority of massive stars are in binaries, which implies that many core\ncollapse supernovae (ccSNe) should be binaries at the time of the explosion.\nHere we show that the three most recent, local (visual) SNe (the Crab, CasA and\nSN1987A) were not binaries, with limits on the initial mass ratios of\nq=M2/M1<0.1. No quantitative limits have previously been set for CasA and the\nCrab, while for SN1987A we merely updated existing limits in view of new\nestimates of the dust content. The lack of stellar companions to these three\nccSNe implies a 90% confidence upper limit on the q>0.1 binary fraction at\ndeath of fb<44%. In a passively evolving binary model (meaning no binary\ninteractions), with a flat mass ratio distribution and a Salpeter IMF, the\nresulting 90% confidence upper limit on the initial binary fraction of F<63% is\nin considerable tension with observed massive binary statistics. Allowing a\nsignificant fraction fM~25% of stellar binaries to merge reduces the tension,\nwith F<63/(1-fM)~81%, but allowing for the significant fraction in higher order\nsystems (triples, etc.) reintroduces the tension. That CasA was not a stellar\nbinary at death also shows that a massive binary companion is not necessary for\nproducing a Type IIb SNe. Much larger surveys for binary companions to Galactic\nSNe will become feasible with the release of the full Gaia proper motion and\nparallax catalogs, providing a powerful probe of the statistics of such\nbinaries and their role in massive star evolution, neutron star velocity\ndistributions and runaway stars.\n", "  We analyze an ensemble of microlensing events from the 2015 Spitzer\nmicrolensing campaign, all of which were densely monitored by ground-based\nhigh-cadence survey teams. The simultaneous observations from Spitzer and the\nground yield measurements of the microlensing parallax vector $\\pi_{\\rm E}$,\nfrom which compact constraints on the microlens properties are derived,\nincluding $\\lesssim$25\\% uncertainties on the lens mass and distance. With the\ncurrent sample, we demonstrate that the majority of microlenses are indeed in\nthe mass range of M dwarfs. The planet sensitivities of all 41 events in the\nsample are calculated, from which we provide constraints on the planet\ndistribution function. In particular, assuming a planet distribution function\nthat is uniform in $\\log{q}$, where $q$ is the planet-to-star mass ratio, we\nfind a $95\\%$ upper limit on the fraction of stars that host typical\nmicrolensing planets of 49\\%, which is consistent with previous studies. Based\non this planet-free sample, we develop the methodology to statistically study\nthe Galactic distribution of planets using microlensing parallax measurements.\nUnder the assumption that the planet distributions are the same in the bulge as\nin the disk, we predict that $\\sim$1/3 of all planet detections from the\nmicrolensing campaigns with Spitzer should be in the bulge. This prediction\nwill be tested with a much larger sample, and deviations from it can be used to\nconstrain the abundance of planets in the bulge relative to the disk.\n", "  We study a recently-proposed approach to the numerical evaluation of\nmulti-loop Feynman integrals using available sector decomposition programs. As\nour main example, we consider the two-loop integrals for the $\\alpha \\alpha_s$\ncorrections to Drell-Yan lepton production with up to one massive vector boson\nin physical kinematics. As a reference, we evaluate these planar and non-planar\nintegrals by the method of differential equations through to weight five.\nChoosing a basis of finite integrals for the numerical evaluation with SecDec3\nleads to tremendous performance improvements and renders the otherwise\nproblematic seven-line topologies numerically accessible. As another example,\nbasis integrals for massless QCD three loop form factors are evaluated with\nFIESTA4. Here, employing a basis of finite integrals results in an overall\nspeedup of more than an order of magnitude.\n", "  Contact resistance is a severe performance bottleneck for electronic devices\nbased on two-dimensional layered (2D) semiconductors, whose contacts are\nSchottky rather than Ohmic. Although there is general consensus that the\ninjection mechanism changes from thermionic to tunneling with gate biasing,\nexisting models tend to oversimplify the transport problem, by neglecting the\n2D transport nature and the modulation of the Schottky barrier height, the\nlatter being of particular importance in back-gated devices. In this work, we\ndevelop a semi-analytical model based on Bardeen's transfer Hamiltonian\napproach to describe both effects. Remarkably, our model is able to reproduce\nseveral experimental observations of a metallic behavior in the contact\nresistance, i.e., a decreasing resistance with decreasing temperature,\noccurring at high gate voltage.\n", "  The study of perturbation of self-gravitating celestial cylindrical object\nhave been carried out in this paper. We have designed a framework to construct\nthe collapse equation by formulating the modified field equations with the\nbackground of $f(R,T)$ theory as well as dynamical equations from the\ncontracted form of Bianchi identities with anisotropic matter configuration. We\nhave encapsulated the radial perturbations on metric and material variables of\nthe geometry with some known static profile at Newtonian and post-Newtonian\nregimes. We examined a strong dependence of unstable regions on stiffness\nparameter which measures the rigidity of the fluid. Also, the static profile\nand matter variables with $f(R,T)$ dark source terms control the instability of\ncompact cylindrical system.\n", "  We analyze the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance\nin Galilean invariant field theories. We show that the existence of a dynamic\ngapless dilaton mode depends on whether the $U(1)$ particle number or the\nGalilean boost symmetry are spontaneously broken. When both scale and particle\nnumber symmetries are spontaneously broken there is one propagating gapless\nNambu-Goldstone mode. Its dispersion relation is linear if the chemical\npotential is nonzero and quadratic otherwise. We discuss the reversibility of\nRG flows in such theories.\n", "  GRB 160625B is an extremely bright GRB with three distinct emission episodes.\nBy analyzing its data observed with the GBM and LAT on board the {\\em Fermi}\nmission, we find that a multi-color black body (mBB) model can be used to fit\nthe spectra of initial short episode (Episode I) very well within the\nhypothesis of photosphere emission of a fireball model. The time-resolved\nspectra of its main episode (Episode II), which was detected with both GBM and\nLAT after a long quiet stage ($\\sim 180$ seconds) of the initial episode, can\nbe fitted with a model composing of an mBB component plus a cutoff power-law\n(CPL) component. This GRB was detected again in the GBM and LAT bands with a\nlong extended emission (Episode III) after a quiet period of $\\sim 300$\nseconds. The spectrum of Episode III is adequately fitted with a CPL plus a\nsingle power-law models, and no mBB component is required. These features may\nimply that the emission of three episodes are dominated by distinct physics\nprocess, i.e., Episode I is possible from cocoon emission surrounding the\nrelativistic jet, Episode II may be from photosphere emission and internal\nshock of relativistic jet, and Episode III is contributed by internal and\nexternal shocks of relativistic jet. On the other hand, both X-ray and optical\nafterglows are consistent with standard external shocks model.\n", "  In standard general relativity the universe cannot be started with arbitrary\ninitial conditions, because four of the ten components of the Einstein's field\nequations (EFE) are constraints on initial conditions. In the previous work it\nwas proposed to extend the gravity theory to allow free initial conditions,\nwith a motivation to solve the cosmological constant problem. This was done by\nsetting four constraints on metric variations in the action principle, which is\nreasonable because the gravity's physical degrees of freedom are at most six.\nHowever, there are two problems about this theory; the three constraints in\naddition to the unimodular condition were introduced without clear physical\nmeanings, and the flat Minkowski spacetime is unstable against perturbations.\nHere a new set of gravitational field equations is derived by replacing the\nthree constraints with new ones requiring that geodesic paths remain geodesic\nagainst metric variations. The instability problem is then naturally solved.\nImplications for the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ are unchanged; the theory\nconverges into EFE with nonzero $\\Lambda$ by inflation, but $\\Lambda$ varies on\nscales much larger than the present Hubble horizon. Then galaxies are formed\nonly in small $\\Lambda$ regions, and the cosmological constant problem is\nsolved by the anthropic argument. Because of the increased degrees of freedom\nin metric dynamics, the theory predicts new non-oscillatory modes of metric\nanisotropy generated by quantum fluctuation during inflation, and CMB B-mode\npolarization would be observed differently from the standard predictions by\ngeneral relativity.\n", "  Magnetic fields inside and around neutron stars are at the heart of pulsar\nmagnetospheric activity. Strong magnetic fields are responsible for quantum\neffects, an essential ingredient to produce leptonic pairs and the subsequent\nbroadband radiation. The variety of electromagnetic field topologies could lead\nto the observed diversity of neutron star classes. Thus it is important to\ninclude multipolar components to a presumably dominant dipolar magnetic field.\nExact analytical solutions for these multipoles in Newtonian gravity have been\ncomputed in recent literature. However, flat spacetime is not adequate to\ndescribe physics in the immediate surrounding of neutron stars. We generalize\nthe multipole expressions to the strong gravity regime by using a slowly\nrotating metric approximation such as the one expected around neutron stars.\nApproximate formulas for the electromagnetic field including frame dragging are\ncomputed from which we estimate the Poynting flux and the braking index.\nCorrections to leading order in compactness and spin parameter are presented.\nAs far as spindown luminosity is concerned, it is shown that frame dragging\nremains irrelevant. For high order multipoles starting from the quadrupole, the\nelectric part can radiate more efficiently than the magnetic part. Both\nanalytical and numerical tools are employed.\n", "  I compare to each other what I consider to be the two most promising\nscenarios to explode core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Both are based on the\nnegative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). In the jittering jets scenario a\ncollapsing core of a single slowly-rotating star can launch jets. The accretion\ndisk or belt (a sub-Keplerian accretion flow concentrated toward the equatorial\nplane) that launches the jets is intermittent with varying directions of the\naxis. Instabilities, such as the standing accretion shock instability (SASI),\nlead to stochastic angular momentum variations that allow the formation of the\nintermittent accretion disk/belt. According to this scenario no failed CCSNe\nexist. According to the fixed axis scenario, the core of the progenitor star\nmust be spun up during its late evolutionary phases, and hence all CCSNe are\ndescendants of strongly interacting binary systems, most likely through a\ncommon envelope evolution (whether the companion survives or not). Due to the\nstrong binary interaction, the axis of the accretion disk that is formed around\nthe newly born neutron star has a more or less fixed direction. According to\nthe fixed axis scenario, accretion disk/belt are not formed around the newly\nborn neutron star of single stars; they rather end in failed CCSNe. I also\nraise the possibility that the jittering jets scenario operates for progenitors\nwith initial mass of 8Mo<M(ZAMS)<18Mo, while the fixed axis scenario operates\nfor M(ZAMS)>18Mo. For the first time these two scenarios are compared to each\nother, as well as to some aspects of neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. These\nnew comparisons further suggest that the JFM plays a major role in exploding\nmassive stars.\n", "  Linear damping rates of radial oscillation modes in selected $Kepler$ stars\nare estimated with the help of a nonadiabatic stability analysis. The\nconvective fluxes are obtained from a nonlocal, time-dependent convection\nmodel. The mixing-length parameter is calibrated to the surface-convection-zone\ndepth of a stellar model obtained from fitting adiabatic frequencies to the\nLEGACY observations, and two of the three nonlocal convection parameters are\ncalibrated to the corresponding LEGACY linewidth measurements. The atmospheric\nstructure in the 1D stability analysis adopts a temperature-optical-depth\nrelation derived from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Results from 3D\nsimulations are also used to calibrate the turbulent pressure and to guide the\nfunctional form of the depth-dependence of the anisotropy of the turbulent\nvelocity field in the 1D stability computations.\n", "  We report evidence for an enstrophy cascade in large-scale point-vortex\nsimulations of decaying two-dimensional quantum turbulence. Devising a method\nto generate quantum vortex configurations with kinetic energy narrowly\nlocalized near a single length scale, the dynamics are found to be\nwell-characterised by a superfluid Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re_s}$, that\ndepends only on the number of vortices and the initial kinetic energy scale.\nUnder free evolution the vortices exhibit features of a classical enstrophy\ncascade, including a $k^{-3}$ power-law kinetic energy spectrum, and steady\nenstrophy flux associated with inertial transport to small scales. Clear\nsignatures of the cascade emerge for $N\\gtrsim 500$ vortices. Simulating up to\nvery large Reynolds numbers ($N = 32, 768$ vortices), additional features of\nthe classical theory are observed: the Kraichnan-Batchelor constant is found to\nconverge to $C' \\approx 1.6$, and the width of the $k^{-3}$ range scales as\n$\\mathrm{Re_s}^{1/2}$. The results support a universal phenomenology\nunderpinning classical and quantum fluid turbulence.\n", "  The existence of a spatially thin, kinematically coherent Disk of Satellites\n(DoS) around the Milky Way (MW), is a problem that often garners vivacious\ndebate in the literature or at scientific meetings. One of the most recent\nincarnations of this wrangle occurred with two papers by Maji et al, who argued\nthat these structures \"maybe a misinterpretation of the data\". These claims are\nin stark contrast to previous works. Motivated by this and other recent\npublications on this problem, we discuss necessary considerations to make,\nobservational effects to consider, and pitfalls to avoid when investigating\nsatellite galaxy planes such as the MW's DoS. In particular, we emphasize that\nconclusions need to have a statistical basis including a determination of the\nsignificance of satellite alignments, observational biases must not be ignored,\nand measurement errors (e.g. for proper motions) need to be considered. We\ndiscuss general problems faced by attempts to determine the dynamical stability\nof the DoS via orbit integrations of MW satellite galaxies, and demonstrate\nthat to interpret simulations, it is helpful to compare them with a null case\nof isotropically distributed satellite positions and velocities. Based on these\ncriteria, we find that the conclusions of Maji et al. do not hold up to\nscrutiny, and that their hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of a single host\nshows no evidence for a significant kinematic coherence among the simulated\nsatellite galaxies, in contrast to the observed MW system.\n", "  We report the temperature-pressure phase diagram of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$\nestablished using high pressure electrical resistivity, magnetization and high\nenergy x-ray diffraction measurements up to 6 GPa. With increasing pressure,\nboth resistivity and magnetization data show that the bulk superconducting\ntransition of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ is suppressed and then disappears at $p$\n$\\gtrsim$ 4 GPa. High pressure x-ray data clearly indicate a phase transition\nto a collapsed tetragonal phase in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ under pressure that\ncoincides with the abrupt loss of bulk superconductivity near 4 GPa. The x-ray\ndata, combined with resistivity data, indicate that the collapsed tetragonal\ntransition line is essentially vertical, occuring at 4.0(5) GPa for\ntemperatures below 150 K. Band structure calculations also find a sudden\ntransition to a collapsed tetragonal state near 4 GPa, as As-As bonding takes\nplace across the Ca-layer. Bonding across the K-layer only occurs for $p$\n$\\geq$ 12 GPa. These findings demonstrate a new type of collapsed tetragonal\nphase in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$: a half-collapsed-tetragonal phase.\n", "  We present an analysis of MUSE observations obtained on the massive Frontier\nFields cluster Abell 2744. This new dataset covers the entire multiply-imaged\nregion around the cluster core. We measure spectroscopic redshifts for\nHST-selected continuum sources together with line emitters blindly detected in\nthe datacube. The combined catalog consists of 514 spectroscopic redshifts\n(with 414 new identifications), including 156 cluster members and 326 magnified\nbackground sources. We use this redshift information to perform a\nstrong-lensing analysis of all multiple images previously found in the deep\nFrontier Field images, and add three new MUSE-detected multiply-imaged systems\nwith no obvious HST counterpart. The combined strong lensing constraints\ninclude a total of 60 systems producing 188 images altogether, out of which 29\nsystems and 83 images are spectroscopically confirmed, making Abell 2744 one of\nthe most well-constrained clusters to date. A parametric mass model including\ntwo cluster-scale components in the core and several group-scale substructures\nat larger radii accurately reproduces all the spectroscopic multiple systems,\nreaching an rms of 0.67\" in the image plane. Overall, the large number of\nspectroscopic redshifts gives us a robust model and we estimate the systematics\non the mass density and magnification within the cluster core to be typically\n~9%.\n", "  In the past few years, the CoRoT and Kepler missions have carried out what is\nnow called the space photometry revolution. This revolution is still ongoing\nthanks to K2 and will be continued by the Tess and Plato2.0 missions. However,\nthe photometry revolution must also be followed by progress in stellar\nmodelling, in order to lead to more precise and accurate determinations of\nfundamental stellar parameters such as masses, radii and ages. In this context,\nthe long-lasting problems related to mixing processes in stellar interior is\nthe main obstacle to further improvements of stellar modelling. In this\ncontribution, we will apply structural asteroseismic inversion techniques to\ntargets from the Kepler Legacy sample and analyse how these can help us\nconstrain the fundamental parameters and mixing processes in these stars. Our\napproach is based on previous studies using the SOLA inversion technique to\ndetermine integrated quantities such as the mean density, the acoustic radius,\nand core conditions indicators, and has already been successfully applied to\nthe 16Cyg binary system. We will show how this technique can be applied to the\nKepler Legacy sample and how new indicators can help us to further constrain\nthe chemical composition profiles of stars as well as provide stringent\nconstraints on stellar ages.\n", "  Transformations on quantum states form a basic building block of every\nquantum information system. From photonic polarization to two-level atoms,\ncomplete sets of quantum gates for a variety of qubit systems are well known.\nFor multi-level quantum systems beyond qubits, the situation is more\nchallenging. The orbital angular momentum modes of photons comprise one such\nhigh-dimensional system for which generation and measurement techniques are\nwell-studied. However, arbitrary transformations for such quantum states are\nnot known. Here we experimentally demonstrate a four-dimensional generalization\nof the Pauli X-gate and all of its integer powers on single photons carrying\norbital angular momentum. Together with the well-known Z-gate, this forms the\nfirst complete set of high-dimensional quantum gates implemented\nexperimentally. The concept of the X-gate is based on independent access to\nquantum states with different parities and can thus be easily generalized to\nother photonic degrees-of-freedom, as well as to other quantum systems such as\nions and superconducting circuits.\n", "  We revisit the Fermi two-atoms problem in the framework of disordered\nsystems. In our model we consider a two-qubits system linearly coupled with a\nquantum massless scalar field. We analyze the energy transfer between the\nqubits under different experimental perspectives. In addition, we assume that\nthe coefficients of the Klein-Gordon equation are random functions of the\nspatial coordinates. The disordered medium is modeled by a centered, stationary\nand Gaussian process. We demonstrate that the classical notion of causality\nemerges only in the wave zone in the presence of random fluctuations of the\nlight cone. Possible repercussions are discussed.\n", "  We develop new numerical schemes for Vlasov--Poisson equations with\nhigh-order accuracy. Our methods are based on a spatially\nmonotonicity-preserving (MP) scheme and are modified suitably so that\npositivity of the distribution function is also preserved. We adopt an\nefficient semi-Lagrangian time integration scheme that is more accurate and\ncomputationally less expensive than the three-stage TVD Runge-Kutta\nintegration. We apply our spatially fifth- and seventh-order schemes to a suite\nof simulations of collisionless self-gravitating systems and electrostatic\nplasma simulations, including linear and nonlinear Landau damping in one\ndimension and Vlasov--Poisson simulations in a six-dimensional phase space. The\nhigh-order schemes achieve a significantly improved accuracy in comparison with\nthe third-order positive-flux-conserved scheme adopted in our previous study.\nWith the semi-Lagrangian time integration, the computational cost of our\nhigh-order schemes does not significantly increase, but remains roughly the\nsame as that of the third-order scheme. Vlasov--Poisson simulations on $128^3\n\\times 128^3$ mesh grids have been successfully performed on a massively\nparallel computer.\n", "  We study the ground states of 2D lattice bosons in an artificial gauge field.\nUsing state of the art DMRG simulations we obtain the zero temperature phase\ndiagram for hardcore bosons at densities $n_b$ with flux $n_\\phi$ per unit\ncell, which determines a filling $\\nu=n_b/n_\\phi$. We find several robust\nquantum Hall phases, including (i) a bosonic integer quantum Hall phase (BIQH)\nat $\\nu=2$, that realizes an interacting symmetry protected topological phase\nin 2D (ii) bosonic fractional quantum Hall phases including robust states at\n$\\nu=2/3$ and a Laughlin state at $\\nu=1/2$. The observed states correspond to\nthe bosonic Jain sequence ($\\nu=p/(p+1)$) pointing towards an underlying\ncomposite fermion picture. In addition to identifying Hamiltonians whose ground\nstates realize these phases, we discuss their preparation beginning from\nindependent chains, and ramping up interchain couplings. Using time dependent\nDMRG simulations, these are shown to reliably produce states close to the\nground state for experimentally relevant system sizes. Besides the\nwave-function overlap, we utilize a simple physical signature of these phases,\nthe non-monotonic behavior of a two-point correlation, a direct consequence of\nedge states in a finite system, to numerically assess the effectiveness of the\npreparation scheme. Our proposal only utilizes existing experimental\ncapabilities.\n", "  Here we simulate the shape of a planetary transit observed at radio\nwavelengths. The simulations use a light curve of the K4 star HAT-P-11 and its\nhot Jupiter companion as proxy. From the HAT-P-11 optical light curve, a\nprominent spot was identified (1.10 Rp and 0.6 Ic). On the radio regime, the\nlimb brighting of 30% was simulated by a quadratic function, and the active\nregion was assumed to have the same size of the optical spot. Considering that\nthe planet size is 6.35% of the the stellar radius, for the quiet star regions\nthe transit depth is smaller than 0.5%, however, this value can increase to ~2%\nwhen covering an active region with 5.0 times the quiet star brightness\ntemperature.\n", "  An exoplanet transiting in front of the disk of its parent star may hide a\ndark starspot causing a detectable change in the light curve, that allows to\ninfer physical characteristics of the spot such as size and intensity. We have\nanalysed the Kepler Space Telescope observations of the star Kepler-71 in order\nto search for variabilities in 28 transit light curves. Kepler-71 is a star\nwith 0.923Ms and 0.816Rs orbited by the hot Jupiter planet Kepler-71b with\nradius of 1.0452RJ. The physical parameters of the starspots are determined by\nfitting the data with a model that simulates planetary transits and enables the\ninclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities,\nand positions. The results show that Kepler-71 is a very active star, with\nseveral spot detections, with a mean value of 6 spots per transit with size\n0.6Rp and 0.5 Ic, as a function of stellar intensity at disk center (maximum\nvalue).\n", "  In this work, we analysed the physical parameters of the spotless actives\nregions observed during solar minimum 23 - 24 (2007 - 2010). The study was\nbased on radio maps at 17~GHz obtained by the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH)\nand magnetograms provided by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The results shows that the spotless\nactive regions presents the same radio characteristics of a ordinary one, they\ncan live in the solar surface for long periods (>10 days), and also can present\nsmall flares.\n", "  We present stellar properties (mass, age, radius, distances) of 57 stars from\na seismic inference using full-length data sets from Kepler. These stars\ncomprise active stars, planet-hosts, solar-analogs, and binary systems. We\nvalidate the distances derived from the astrometric Gaia-Tycho solution.\nEnsemble analysis of the stellar properties reveals a trend of mixing-length\nparameter with the surface gravity and effective temperature. We derive a\nlinear relationship with the seismic quantity $\\langle r_{02} \\rangle$ to\nestimate the stellar age. Finally, we define the stellar regimes where the\nKjeldsen et al (2008) empirical surface correction for 1D model frequencies is\nvalid.\n", "  The growth of superconducting order after an interaction quench in a\nhexagonal lattice is studied. The cases of both time-reversal (TR) preserving\ngraphene, as well as the TR broken Haldane model are explored. Spin singlet\nsuperconducting order is studied where the $s$, $d+id$, and $d-id$ wave orders\nare the irreducible representations of the hexagonal lattice. For small\nquenches, the $d$-wave order parameter grows the fastest, a result also\nexpected when the system is in thermal equilibrium. For the TR symmetry\npreserving case, the growth rate of the two $d$-wave orders is identical, while\nthe TR-broken case prefers one of the chiral $d$-wave orders over the other,\nleading to a TR broken topological superconductor. As the interaction quench\nbecomes larger, a smooth crossover is found where eventually the growth rate of\nthe $s$-wave becomes the largest. Thus for large interaction quenches, the\n$s$-wave is preferred over the $d$-wave for both TR preserving and TR broken\nsystems. This result is explained in terms of the high energy quasi-particles\nresponsible for the dynamics as the interaction quench amplitude grows. The\nresults are relevant for time-resolved measurements that can probe the symmetry\nof the superconducting fluctuations in a transient regime.\n", "  Space-based photometric missions revealed a surprising abundance of\nmillimagnitude-level additional modes in RR Lyrae stars. The modes that appear\nin the modulated fundamental-mode (RRab) stars can be ordered into four major\ncategories. Here we present the distribution of these groups in the Petersen\ndiagram, and discuss their characteristics and connections to additional modes\nobserved in other RR Lyrae stars.\n", "  We present an empirical approach for interpreting gravitational wave signals\nof binary black hole mergers under the assumption that the underlying black\nhole population is sourced by remnants of stellar evolution. Using the observed\nrelationship between galaxy mass and stellar metallicity, we predict the black\nhole count as a function of galaxy stellar mass. We show, for example, that a\ngalaxy like the Milky Way should host millions of $\\sim 30~M_\\odot$ black holes\nand dwarf satellite galaxies like Draco should host $\\sim 100$ such remnants,\nwith weak dependence on the assumed IMF and stellar evolution model. Most\nlow-mass black holes ($\\sim10 M_\\odot$) typically reside within massive\ngalaxies ($M_\\star \\simeq 10^{11} M_\\odot$) while massive black holes ($\\sim\n50~M_\\odot$) typically reside within dwarf galaxies ($M_\\odot \\simeq 10^9\nM_\\odot$) today. If roughly $1\\%$ of black holes are involved in a binary black\nhole merger, then the reported merger rate densities from Advanced LIGO can be\naccommodated for a range of merger timescales, and the detection of mergers\nwith $> 50~M_\\odot$ black holes should be expected within the next decade.\nIdentifying the host galaxy population of the mergers provides a way to\nconstrain both the binary neutron star or black hole formation efficiencies and\nthe merger timescale distributions; these events would be primarily localized\nin dwarf galaxies if the merger timescale is short compared to the age of the\nuniverse and in massive galaxies otherwise. As more mergers are detected, the\nprospect of identifying the host galaxy population, either directly through the\ndetection of electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers or\nindirectly through the anisotropy of the events, will become a realistic\npossibility.\n", "  We describe a strategy for constructing a neural network jet substructure\ntagger which powerfully discriminates boosted decay signals while remaining\nlargely uncorrelated with the jet mass. This reduces the impact of systematic\nuncertainties in background modeling while enhancing signal purity, resulting\nin improved discovery significance relative to existing taggers. The network is\ntrained using an adversarial strategy, resulting in a tagger that learns to\nbalance classification accuracy with decorrelation. As a benchmark scenario, we\nconsider the case where large-radius jets originating from a boosted resonance\ndecay are discriminated from a background of nonresonant quark and gluon jets.\nWe show that in the presence of systematic uncertainties on the background\nrate, our adversarially-trained, decorrelated tagger considerably outperforms a\nconventionally trained neural network, despite having a slightly worse\nsignal-background separation power. We generalize the adversarial training\ntechnique to include a parametric dependence on the signal hypothesis, training\na single network that provides optimized, interpolatable decorrelated jet\ntagging across a continuous range of hypothetical resonance masses, after\ntraining on discrete choices of the signal mass.\n", "  The increased amount of high precision seismic data for solar-like stars\ncalls for the existence of tools that can extract information from such data.\nIn the case of the study of acoustic glitches there are no publicly available\ntools and most existing ones require a deep knowledge of their implementation.\nIn this work a tool is presented that aims to both simplify the interaction\nwith the user and also be capable of working automatically to determine\nproperties of acoustic glitches from seismic data of solar-like stars. This\ntool is shown to work with both the Sun and other solar analogs but also shows\nthat are still severe limitations to the methods used, when considering smaller\ndatasets.\n", "  The effect of the next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) tunneling on the hard-core\nextended Bose-Hubbard model on square lattices is investigated. By means of the\ncluster mean-field theory, the ground-state phase diagrams are determined. When\na modest nnn tunneling is introduced, depending on its sign, two distinct\nsupersolid states with checkerboard crystal structures are found away from\nhalf-filing. The characters of various phase transitions out of these two\nsupersolid states are discussed. In particular, for the case with kinetic\nfrustration, the existence of a half supersolid phase possessing both solid and\nunconventional superfluid orders is established. Our work hence sheds light on\nthe search of this interesting supersolid phase in real ultracold lattice gases\nwith frustrated tunnelings.\n", "  We study the phase transition between a trivial and a time-reversal-invariant\ntopological superconductor in a single-band system. By analyzing the interplay\nof symmetry, topology and energetics, we show that for a generic normal state\nband structure, the phase transition occurs via extended intermediate phases in\nwhich even- and odd-parity pairing components coexist. For inversion-symmetric\nsystems, the coexistence phase spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry. For\nnoncentrosymmetric superconductors, the low-temperature intermediate phase is\ntime-reversal breaking, while the high-temperature phase preserves\ntime-reversal symmetry and has topologically protected line nodes. Furthermore,\nwith approximate rotational invariance, the system has an emergent $U(1) \\times\nU(1)$ symmetry, and novel topological defects, such as half vortex lines\nbinding Majorana fermions, can exist. We analytically solve for the dispersion\nof the Majorana fermion and show that it exhibit small and large velocities at\nlow and high energies. Relevance of our theory to superconducting pyrochlore\noxide Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$ and half-Heusler materials is discussed.\n", "  While quantum anomalies are often associated with the breaking of a classical\nsymmetry in the quantum theory, their anomalous contributions to observables\nremain distinct and well-defined even when the symmetry is broken from the\noutset. This paper explores such anomalous contributions to the current,\noriginating from the axial anomaly in a Weyl semimetal, and in the presence of\na generic Weyl node-mixing term. We find that apart from the familiar anomalous\ndivergence of the axial current proportional to a product of electric and\nmagnetic fields, there is another anomalous term proportional to a product of\nthe electric field and the orientation of a spin-dependent node-mixing vector.\nWe obtain this result both by a quantum field-theoretic analysis of an\neffective Weyl action and solving an explicit lattice model. The extended\nspin-mixing mass terms, and the enriched axial anomaly they entail, could arise\nas mean-field or proximity-induced order parameters in spin-density-wave phases\nin Weyl semimetals or be generated dynamically within a Floquet theory.\n", "  We model an enclosed system of bacteria, whose motility-induced phase\nseparation is coupled to slow population dynamics. Without noise, the system\nshows both static phase separation and a limit cycle, in which a rising global\npopulation causes a dense bacterial colony to form, which then declines by\nlocal cell death, before dispersing to re-initiate the cycle. Adding\nfluctuations, we find that static colonies are now metastable, moving between\nspatial locations via rare and strongly nonequilibrium pathways, whereas the\nlimit cycle becomes almost periodic such that after each redispersion event the\nnext colony forms in a random location. These results, which hint at some\naspects of the biofilm-planktonic life cycle, can be explained by combining\ntools from large deviation theory with a bifurcation analysis in which the\nglobal population density plays the role of control parameter.\n", "  The cardiovascular system is composed of the heart, blood and blood vessels.\nRegarding the heart, cardiac conditions are determined by the\nelectrocardiogram, that is a noninvasive medical procedure. In this work, we\npropose autoregressive process in a mathematical model based on coupled\ndifferential equations in order to model electrocardiogram signals. Our results\nare compared with experimental tachogram by means of Poincar\\'e plot and\ndentrended fluctuation analysis. We verify that the results from the model with\nautoregressive process show good agreement with experimental measures from\ntachogram generated by electrical activity of the heartbeat. With the tachogram\nwe build the electrocardiogram by means of coupled differential equations.\n", "  We recently used near-infrared spectroscopy to improve the characterization\nof 76 low-mass stars around which K2 had detected 79 candidate transiting\nplanets. Thirty of these worlds were new discoveries that have not previously\nbeen published. We calculate the false positive probabilities that the\ntransit-like signals are actually caused by non-planetary astrophysical\nphenomena and reject five new transit-like events and three previously reported\nevents as false positives. We also statistically validate 18 planets (eight of\nwhich were previously unpublished), confirm the earlier validation of 21\nplanets, and announce 17 newly discovered planet candidates. Revising the\nproperties of the associated planet candidates based on the updated host star\ncharacteristics and refitting the transit photometry, we find that our sample\ncontains 20 planets or planet candidates with radii smaller than 1.25 Earth\nradii, 20 super-Earths (1.25-2 Earth radii), 20 small Neptunes (2-4 Earth\nradii), three large Neptunes (4-6 Earth radii), and eight giant planets (> 6\nEarth radii). Most of these planets are highly irradiated, but EPIC\n206209135.04 (K2-72e, Rp = 1.29 (-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii), EPIC 211988320.01\n(Rp = 2.86 (-0.15/+0.16) Earth radii), and EPIC 212690867.01 (Rp = 2.20\n(-0.18/+0.19) Earth radii) orbit within optimistic habitable zone boundaries\nset by the \"recent Venus\" inner limit and the \"early Mars\" outer limit. In\ntotal, our planet sample includes eight moderately-irradiated 1.5-3 Earth\nradius planet candidates (Fp < 20 F_Earth) orbiting brighter stars (Ks < 11)\nthat are well-suited for atmospheric investigations with Hubble, Spitzer,\nand/or the James Webb Space Telescope. Five validated planets orbit relatively\nbright stars (Kp < 12.5) and are expected to yield radial velocity\nsemi-amplitudes of at least 2 m/s.\n", "  Over the last decade, thanks to the successful space missions launched to\ndetect stellar pulsations, Asteroseismology has produced an extraordinary\nrevolution in astrophysics, unveiling a wealth of results on structural\nproperties of stars over a large part of the H-R diagram. Particularly\nimpressive has been the development of Asteroseismology for stars showing\nsolar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped in stars\nwith convective envelopes. Here I will review on the modern era of\nAsteroseismology with emphasis on results obtained for solar-like stars and\ndiscuss its potential for the advancement of stellar physics.\n", "  We analyse the control of Majorana zero-energy states by mapping the\nfermionic system onto a chain of Ising spins. Although the topological\nprotection is lost for the Ising system, the mapping provides additional\ninsight into the nature of the quantum states. By controlling the local\nmagnetic field, one can separate the Ising chain into ferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic phases, corresponding to topological and non-topological sections\nof the fermionic system. In this paper we propose (topologically non-protected)\nprotocols performing the braiding operation, and in fact also more general\nrotations. We first consider a T-junction geometry, but we also propose a\nprotocol for a purely one-dimensional system. Both setups rely on an extra\nspin-1/2 coupler. By including the extra spin in the T-junction geometry, we\novercome limitations due to the 1D character of the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation. In the 1D geometry the coupler, which controls one of the Ising\nlinks, should be manipulated once the ferromagnetic (topological) section of\nthe chain is moved far away. We also propose experimental implementations of\nour scheme. One is based on a chain of flux qubits which allows for all needed\ncontrol fields. We also describe how to translate our scheme for the 1D setup\nto a chain of superconducting wires hosting each a pair of Majorana edge\nstates.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the quantum scattering of a single-photon pulse\ninteracting with an ensemble of $\\Lambda$-type three-level atoms coupled to a\none-dimensional waveguide. With an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we\nstudy the collective interaction between the atoms mediated by the waveguide\nmode. In our scheme, the atoms are randomly placed in the lattice along the\naxis of the one-dimensional waveguide, which closely corresponds to the\npractical condition that the atomic positions can not be controlled precisely\nin experiment. Many interesting optical properties occur in our waveguide-atom\nsystem, such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and optical\ndepth. Moreover, we observe that strong photon-photon correlation with quantum\nbeats can be generated in the off-resonant case, which provides an effective\ncandidate for producing non-classical light in experiment. With remarkable\nprogress in waveguide-emitter system, our scheme may be feasible in the near\nfuture.\n", "  We propose and analyze a method to engineer effective interactions in an\nensemble of d-level systems (qudits) driven by global control fields. In\nparticular, we present (i) a necessary and sufficient condition under which a\ngiven interaction can be turned off (decoupled), (ii) the existence of a\nuniversal sequence that decouples any (cancellable) interaction, and (iii) an\nefficient algorithm to engineer a target Hamiltonian from an initial\nHamiltonian (if possible). As examples, we provide a 6-pulse sequence that\ndecouples effective spin-1 dipolar interactions and demonstrate that a spin- 1\nIsing chain can be engineered to study transitions among three distinct\nsymmetry protected topological phases.\n", "  Supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) on sub-parsec scales are prime targets\nfor gravitational wave experiments. They also provide insights on close binary\nevolution and hierarchical structure formation. Sub-parsec BBHs cannot be\nspatially resolved but indirect methods can identify candidates. In 2015 Liu et\nal. reported an optical-continuum periodicity in the quasar PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075, with the estimated mass and rest-frame period suggesting an\norbital separation of about 0.006 pc (0.7 micro-arcsec). The persistence of the\nquasar's optical periodicity has recently been disfavored over an extended\nbaseline. However, if a radio jet is launched from a sub-parsec BBH, the\nbinary's properties can influence the radio structure on larger scales. Here,\nwe use the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA) to study the parsec- and kiloparsec-scale emission energized by the\nquasar's putative BBH. We find two VLBA components separated by 3.6 mas (30\npc), tentatively identifying one as the VLBA \"core\" from which the other was\nejected. The VLBA components contribute to a point-like, time-variable VLA\nsource that is straddled by lobes spanning 8 arcsec (66 kpc). We classify PSO\nJ334.2028+01.4075 as a lobe-dominated quasar, albeit with an atypically large\ntwist of 39 deg between its elongation position angles on parsec- and\nkiloparsec-scales. By analogy with 3C 207, a well-studied lobe-dominated quasar\nwith a similarly-rare twist, we speculate that PSO J334.2028+01.4075 could be\nejecting jet components over an inner cone that traces a precessing jet in a\nBBH system.\n", "  Using observations from the first two years of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution\nField (MOSDEF) survey, we study 13 AGN-driven outflows detected from a sample\nof 67 X-ray, IR and/or optically-selected AGN at $z \\sim 2$. The AGN have\nbolometric luminosities of $\\sim10^{44}-10^{46} ~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$,\nincluding both quasars and moderate-luminosity AGN. We detect blueshifted,\nionized gas outflows in the H$\\beta$ , [OIII], H$\\alpha$ ~and/or [NII] emission\nlines of $19\\%$ of the AGN, while only 1.8\\% of the MOSDEF galaxies have\nsimilarly-detected outflows. The outflow velocities span $\\sim$300 to 1000 km\ns$^{-1}$. Eight of the 13 outflows are spatially extended on similar scales as\nthe host galaxies, with spatial extents of 2.5 to 11.0 kpc. Outflows are\ndetected uniformly across the star-forming main sequence, showing little trend\nwith the host galaxy SFR. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that the outflowing\ngas is photoionized by the AGN. We do not find evidence for positive AGN\nfeedback, in either our small MOSDEF sample or a much larger SDSS sample, using\nthe BPT diagram. Given that a galaxy with an AGN is ten times more likely to\nhave a detected outflow, the outflowing gas is photoionzed by the AGN, and\nestimates of the mass and energy outflow rates indicate that stellar feedback\nis insufficient to drive at least some of these outflows, they are very likely\nto be AGN-driven. The outflows have mass-loading factors of the order of unity,\nsuggesting that they help regulate star formation in their host galaxies,\nthough they may be insufficient to fully quench it.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are recently discovered materials supporting emergent\nrelativistic fermions in the vicinity of band-crossing points known as Weyl\nnodes. The positions of the nodes and the low-energy spectrum depend\nsensitively on the time-reversal (TR) and inversion (I) symmetry breaking in\nthe system. We introduce the concept of Weyl metamaterials where the particles\nexperience a 3d curved geometry and gauge fields emerging from smooth spatially\nvarying TR and I breaking fields. The Weyl metamaterials can be fabricated from\nsemimetal or insulator parent states where the geometry can be tuned, for\nexample, through inhomogeneous magnetization. We derive an explicit connection\nbetween the effective geometry and the local symmetry-breaking configuration.\nThis result opens the door for a systematic study of 3d designer geometries and\ngauge fields for relativistic carriers. The Weyl metamaterials provide a route\nto novel electronic devices as highlighted by a remarkable 3d electron lens\neffect.\n", "  Useful quantum metrology requires nonclassical states with a high particle\nnumber and (close to) the optimal exploitation of the state's quantum\ncorrelations. Unfortunately, the single-particle detection resolution demanded\nby conventional protocols, such as spin squeezing via one-axis twisting, places\nsevere limits on the particle number. Additionally, the challenge of finding\noptimal measurements (that saturate the quantum Cram{\\'e}r-Rao bound) for an\narbitrary nonclassical state limits most metrological protocols to only\nmoderate levels of quantum enhancement. \"Interaction-based readout\" protocols\nhave been shown to allow optimal interferometry \\emph{or} to provide robustness\nagainst detection noise at the expense of optimality. In this Letter, we prove\nthat one has great flexibility in constructing an optimal protocol, thereby\nallowing it to also be robust to detection noise. This requires the full\nprobability distribution of outcomes in an optimal measurement basis, which is\ntypically easily accessible and can be determined from specific criteria we\nprovide. Additionally, we quantify the robustness of several classes of\ninteraction-based readouts under realistic experimental constraints. We\ndetermine that optimal \\emph{and} robust quantum metrology is achievable in\ncurrent spin-squeezing experiments.\n", "  We quantify the correlations between gas-phase and stellar metallicities and\nglobal properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass, halo mass, age and gas\nfraction, in the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments\n(EAGLE) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The slope of the\ncorrelation between stellar mass and metallicity of star-forming (SF) gas\n($M_*-Z_{\\rm SF,gas}$ relation) depends somewhat on resolution, with the\nhigher-resolution run reproducing a steeper slope. This simulation predicts a\nnon-zero metallicity evolution, increasing by $\\approx 0.5$ dex at $\\sim 10^9\n{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ since $z = 3$. The simulated relation between stellar mass,\nmetallicity and star formation rate at $z \\lesssim 5$ agrees remarkably well\nwith the observed fundamental metallicity relation. At $M_* \\lesssim 10^{10.3}\n{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and fixed stellar mass, higher metallicities are associated\nwith lower specific star formation rates, lower gas fractions and older stellar\npopulations. On the other hand, at higher $M_*$, there is a hint of an\ninversion of the dependence of metallicity on these parameters. The fundamental\nparameter that best correlates with the metal content, in the simulations, is\nthe gas fraction. The simulated gas fraction-metallicity relation exhibits\nsmall scatter and does not evolve significantly since $z = 3$. In order to\nbetter understand the origin of these correlations, we analyse a set of lower\nresolution simulations in which feedback parameters are varied. We find that\nthe slope of the simulated $M_*-Z_{\\rm SF,gas}$ relation is mostly determined\nby stellar feedback at low stellar masses ($M_* \\lesssim 10^{10} {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$), and at high masses ($M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) by the\nfeedback from active galactic nuclei.\n", "  We report the analysis of the double-mode RR Lyrae star EPIC 205209951, the\nfirst modulated RRd star observed from space. The amplitude and phase\nmodulation are present in both modes.\n", "  We present the method of the Extended Aperture Photometry (EAP) that we\napplied to K2 RR Lyrae stars. Our aim is to minimize the instrumental\nvariations of attitude control maneuvers by using apertures that cover the\npositional changes in the field of view thus contain the stars during the whole\nobservation. We present example light curves that we compared to the light\ncurves from the K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC) pipeline applied to the\nautomated Single Aperture Photometry (SAP) and to the Pre-search Data\nConditioning Simple Aperture Photometry (PDCSAP) data.\n", "  It has been known since the early days of quantum mechanics that hyperbolic\nsecant pulses possess the unique property that they can perform cyclic\nevolution on two-level quantum systems independently of the pulse detuning.\nMore recently, it was realized that they induce detuning- controlled phases\nwithout changing state populations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the\nproperties of hyperbolic secant pulses on superconducting transmon qubits and\ncontrast them with the more commonly used Gaussian and square waves. We further\nshow that these properties can be exploited to implement phase gates, nominally\nwithout exiting the computational subspace. This enables us to demonstrate the\nfirst microwave-driven Z-gates with a single control parameter, the detuning.\n", "  We present the ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic evolution of a tidal disruption\nevent (TDE) for the first time. After the discovery of the nearby TDE\niPTF16fnl, we obtained a series of observations with the Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The\ndominant emission features closely resemble those seen in the UV spectra of the\nTDE ASASSN-14li and are also similar to those of N-rich quasars. However, there\nis significant evolution in the shape and central wavelength of the line\nprofiles over the course of our observations, such that at early times the\nlines are broad and redshifted, while at later times the lines are\nsignificantly narrower and peak near the wavelengths of their corresponding\natomic transitions. Like ASASSN-14li, but unlike N-rich quasars, iPTF16fnl\nshows neither MgII$\\lambda 2798$\\AA\\ nor CIII]$\\lambda 1909$\\AA\\ emission\nfeatures. We also present optical photometry and spectroscopy, which suggest\nthat the complex HeII profiles observed in the optical spectra of many TDEs are\nin part due to the presence of NIII and CIII Wolf-Rayet features, which can\npotentially serve as probes of the far-UV when space-based observations are not\npossible. Finally, we use Swift XRT and UVOT observations to place strong\nlimits on the X-ray emission and determine the characteristic temperature,\nradius, and luminosity of the emitting material. We find that iPTF16fnl is\nsubluminous and evolves more rapidly than other optically discovered TDEs.\n", "  Based on conformal symmetry we propose an exact formula for the four-point\nconnectivities of FK clusters in the critical Ising model when the four points\nare anchored to the boundary. The explicit solution we found displays\nlogarithmic singularities. We check our prediction using Monte Carlo\nsimulations on a triangular lattice, showing excellent agreement. Our findings\ncould shed further light on the formidable task of the characterization of\nLogarithmic Conformal Field Theories and on their relevance in physics.\n", "  When it comes to searches for extensions to general relativity, large efforts\nare being dedicated to accurate predictions for the power spectrum of density\nperturbations. While this observable is known to be sensitive to the\ngravitational theory, its efficiency as a diagnostic for gravity is\nsignificantly reduced when Solar System constraints are strictly adhered to. We\nshow that this problem can be overcome by studying weigthed density fields. We\npropose a transformation of the density field for which the impact of modified\ngravity on the power spectrum can be increased by more than a factor of three.\nThe signal is not only amplified, but the modified gravity features are shifted\nto larger scales which are less affected by baryonic physics. Furthermore, the\noverall signal-to-noise increases, which in principle makes identifying\nsignatures of modified gravity with future galaxy surveys more feasible. While\nour analysis is focused on modified gravity, the technique can be applied to\nother problems in cosmology, such as the detection of neutrinos, the effects of\nbaryons or baryon acoustic oscillations.\n", "  We compute scattering amplitudes of the regularized bosonic Nambu-Goto string\nin the mean-field approximation, disregarding fluctuations of the Lagrange\nmultiplier and an independent metric about their mean values. We use the\npreviously introduced Lilliputian scaling limit to recover the Regge behavior\nof the amplitudes with the usual linear Regge trajectory in space-time\ndimensions d>2. We demonstrate a stability of this minimum of the effective\naction under fluctuations for d<26.\n", "  Perovskite oxide heterostructures offer an important path forward for\nstabilizing and controlling low-dimensional magnetism. One of the guiding\ndesign principles for these materials systems is octahedral connectivity. In\nsuperlattices composed of perovskites with different crystal symmetries,\nvariation of the relative ratio of the constituent layers as well as the\nindividual layer thicknesses gives rise to non-equilibrium crystal symmetries\nthat, in turn, lead to unprecedented control of interfacial ferromagnetism. We\nhave found that in superlattices of CaMnO$_3$ (CMO) and LaNiO$_3$ (LNO),\ninterfacial ferromagnetism can be modulated by a factor of three depending on\nLNO and CMO layer thicknesses as well as their relative ratio. Such an effect\nis only possible due to the non-equilibrium crystal symmetries at the\ninterfaces and can be understood in terms of the anisotropy of the exchange\ninteractions and modifications in the interfacial Ni-O-Mn and Mn-O-Mn bond\nangles and lengths with increasing LNO layer thickness. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of engineering non-equilibrium crystal symmetries in\ndesigning ferromagnetism.\n", "  We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar\nmass ($M_*$) in sub-galactic ($\\sim 1$kpc) scale of 93 local ($0.01<z<0.02$)\nmassive ($M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$) spiral galaxies. To derive\nspatially-resolved SFR and stellar mass, we perform so-called pixel-to-pixel\nSED fitting, which fits an observed spatially-resolved multiband SED with a\nlibrary of model SEDs using Bayesian statistics approach. We use 2 bands (FUV\nand NUV) and 5 bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$) imaging data from Galaxy\nEvolution Explorer (GALEX) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), respectively.\nWe find a tight nearly linear relation between the local surface density of SFR\n($\\Sigma_{\\rm{SFR}}$) and stellar mass ($\\Sigma_{*}$) which has flattening in\nhigh $\\Sigma_{*}$. The near linear relation between $\\Sigma_{*}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ suggests constant sSFR throughout the galaxies, and the\nscatter of the relation is directly related to that of sSFR. Therefore, we\nanalyse the variation of sSFR in various scales. More massive galaxies on\naverage have lower sSFR throughout them than less massive galaxies. We also\nfind that barred galaxies have lower sSFR in a core region than non-barred\ngalaxies. However, in the outside region, sSFR of barred and non-barred\ngalaxies are similar and lead to the similar total sSFR.\n", "  Searches for double beta decay of $^{134}$Xe were performed with EXO-200, a\nsingle-phase liquid xenon detector designed to search for neutrinoless double\nbeta decay of $^{136}$Xe. Using an exposure of $29.6\\text{\nkg}\\!\\cdot\\!\\text{yr}$, the lower limits of\n$\\text{T}_{1/2}^{2\\nu\\beta\\!\\beta}>8.7\\cdot10^{20}\\text{ yr}$ and\n$\\text{T}_{1/2}^{0\\nu\\beta\\!\\beta}>1.1\\cdot10^{23}\\text{ yr}$ at 90% confidence\nlevel were derived, with corresponding half-life sensitivities of\n$1.2\\cdot10^{21}\\text{ yr}$ and $1.9\\cdot10^{23}\\text{ yr}$. These limits\nexceed those in the literature for $^{134}$Xe, improving by factors of nearly\n$10^{5}$ and 2 for the two antineutrino and neutrinoless modes, respectively.\n", "  We propose a new mathematical model for $n-k$-dimensional non-linear\ncorrelations with intrinsic scatter in $n$-dimensional data. The model is based\non Riemannian geometry, and is naturally symmetric with respect to the measured\nvariables and invariant under coordinate transformations. We combine the model\nwith a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the correlation\nrelation and the intrinsic scatter. A side benefit of the approach is that\ncensored and truncated datasets and independent, arbitrary measurement errors\ncan be incorporated. We also derive analytic likelihoods for the typical\nastrophysical use case of linear relations in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.\nWe pay particular attention to the case of linear regression in two dimensions,\nand compare our results to existing methods. Finally, we apply our methodology\nto the well-known $M_\\text{BH}$-$\\sigma$ correlation between the mass of a\nsupermassive black hole in the centre of a galactic bulge and the corresponding\nbulge velocity dispersion. The main result of our analysis is that the most\nlikely slope of this correlation is $\\sim 6$ for the datasets used, rather than\nthe values in the range $\\sim 4$-$5$ typically quoted in the literature for\nthese data.\n", "  Long after its discovery superconductivity in alkali fullerides A$_3$C$_{60}$\nstill challenges conventional wisdom. The freshest inroad in such\never-surprising physics is the behaviour under intense infrared (IR)\nexcitation. Signatures attributable to a transient superconducting state\nextending up to temperatures ten times higher than the equilibrium $T_c\\sim$ 20\nK have been discovered in K$_3$C$_{60}$ after ultra-short pulsed IR irradiation\n-- an effect which still appears as remarkable as mysterious. Motivated by the\nobservation that the phenomenon is observed in a broad pumping frequency range\nthat coincides with the mid-infrared electronic absorption peak still of\nunclear origin, rather than to TO phonons as has been proposed, we advance here\na radically new mechanism. First, we argue that this broad absorption peak\nrepresents a \"super-exciton\" involving the promotion of one electron from the\n$t_{1u}$ half-filled state to a higher-energy empty $t_{1g}$ state,\ndramatically lowered in energy by the large dipole-dipole interaction acting in\nconjunction with Jahn Teller effect within the enormously degenerate manifold\nof $\\big(t_{1u}\\big)^2\\big(t_{1g}\\big)^1$ states. Both long-lived and\nentropy-rich because they are triplets, the IR-induced excitons act as a sort\nof cooling mechanism that permits transient superconductive signals to persist\nup to much larger temperatures.\n", "  The term Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering refers to a quantum correlation\nintermediate between entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which has been\nconnected to another fundamental quantum property: measurement incompatibility.\nIn the finite-dimensional case, efficient computational methods to quantify\nsteerability have been developed. In the infinite-dimensional case, however,\nless theoretical tools are available. Here, we approach the problem of\nsteerability in the continuous variable case via a notion of state-channel\ncorrespondence, which generalizes the well-known Choi-Jamio\\l{}kowski\ncorrespondence. Via our approach we are able to generalize the connection\nbetween steering and incompatibility to the continuous variable case and to\nconnect the steerability of a state with the incompatibility breaking property\nof a quantum channel, e.g., noisy NOON states and amplitude damping channels.\nMoreover, we apply our methods to the Gaussian steering setting, proving, among\nother things, that canonical quadratures are sufficient for steering Gaussian\nstates.\n", "  R-matrices are the solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. At the origin of\nthe quantum group theory, they may be interpreted as intertwining operators.\nRecent advances have been made independently in different directions.\nMaulik-Okounkov have given a geometric approach to R-matrices with new tools in\nsymplectic geometry, the stable envelopes. Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh proved a\nconjecture on the categorification of cluster algebras by using R-matrices in a\ncrucial way. Eventually, a better understanding of the action of\ntransfer-matrices obtained from R-matrices led to the proof of several\nconjectures about the corresponding quantum integrable systems.\n", "  Superconductivity appears in the cuprates when a spin order is destroyed,\nwhile the role of charge is less known. Recently, charge density wave (CDW) was\nfound below the superconducting dome in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ when a high magnetic\nfield is applied perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ plane, which was suggested to\narise from incipient CDW in the vortex cores that becomes overlapped. Here, by\n$^{63}$Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance, we report the discovery of CDW induced by\nan in-plane field that does not create vortex cores in the plane, setting in\nabove the dome in single-layered Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_6$.The onset\ntemperature $T_{\\rm CDW}$ takes over the antiferromagnetic order temperature\n$T_{\\rm N}$ beyond a critical doping level at which superconductivity starts to\nemerge, and scales with the psudogap temperature $T^{*}$. These results provide\nimportant insights into the relationship between spin order, CDW and the\npseudogap, and their connections to high-temperature superconductivity.\n", "  The topological susceptibility, $\\chi^4$, following the work of Witten and\nVeneziano, plays a key role in identifying the relative magnitude of the\n$\\eta^{\\prime}$ mass, the so-called $U(1)_{A}$ problem. A nonzero $\\chi^4$ is\ncaused by the Veneziano ghost, the occurrence of an unphysical massless pole in\nthe correlation function of the topological current. In a recent paper\n(Phys.Rev.Lett.114 (2015) 24, 242001), an explicit relationship between this\nVeneziano ghost and color confinement was proposed, by connecting the dynamics\nof the Veneziano ghost, and thus the topological susceptibility, with Gribov\ncopies. However, the analysis is incompatible with BRST symmetry (Phys.Rev.D 93\n(2016) no.8, 085010). In this paper, we investigate the topological\nsusceptibility, $\\chi^4$, in SU(3) and SU(2) Euclidean Yang-Mills theory using\nan appropriate Pad\\'e approximation tool and a non-perturbative gluon\npropagator, within a BRST invariant framework and by taking into account Gribov\ncopies in a general linear covariant gauge.\n", "  $\\text{N}_{2}\\text{V}$ defect in diamond is characterized by means of\n\\emph{ab initio} methods relying on density functional theory calculated\nparameters of a Hubbard model Hamiltonian. It is shown that this approach\nappropriately describes the energy levels of correlated excited states induced\nby this defect. By determining its critical magneto-optical parameters, we\npropose to realize a long-living quantum memory by $\\text{N}_{2}\\text{V}$\ndefect in diamond.\n", "  Topology describes properties that remain unaffected by smooth distortions.\nIts main hallmark is the emergence of edge states localized at the boundary\nbetween regions characterized by distinct topological invariants. This feature\noffers new opportunities for robust trapping of light in nano- and micro-meter\nscale systems subject to fabrication imperfections and to environmentally\ninduced deformations. Here we show lasing in such topological edge states of a\none-dimensional lattice of polariton micropillars that implements an orbital\nversion of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that\nlasing in these states persists under local deformations of the lattice. These\nresults open the way to the implementation of chiral lasers in systems with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry and, when combined with polariton interactions,\nto the study of nonlinear topological photonics.\n", "  The decay of Taylor-Couette turbulence, i.e~the flow between two coaxial and\nindependently rotating cylinders, is numerically studied by instantaneously\nstopping the forcing from an initially statistically stationary flow field at a\nReynolds number of $Re=3.5\\times 10^4$. The effect of wall-friction is analysed\nby comparing three separate cases, in which the cylinders are either suddenly\nmade no-slip or stress-free. Different life stages are observed during the\ndecay. In the first stage, the decay is dominated by large-scale rolls.\nCounterintuitively, when these rolls fade away, if the flow inertia is small a\nredistribution of energy occurs, the energy of the azimuthal velocity behaves\nnon-monotonically: first decreasing by almost two orders of magnitude, and then\nincreasing during the redistribution. The second stage is dominated by\nnon-normal transient growth of perturbations in the axial (spanwise) direction.\nOnce this mechanism is exhausted, the flow enters the final life stage, viscous\ndecay, which is dominated by wall-friction. We show that this stage can be\nmodeled by a one-dimensional heat equation, and that self-similar velocity\nprofiles collapse onto the theoretical solution.\n", "  Laterally periodic nanostructures were investigated with grazing incidence\nsmall angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) by using the diffraction patterns to\nreconstruct the surface shape. To model visible light scattering, rigorous\ncalculations of the near and far field by numerically solving Maxwell's\nequations with a finite-element method are well established. The application of\nthis technique to X-rays is still challenging, due to the discrepancy between\nincident wavelength and finite-element size. This drawback vanishes for GISAXS\ndue to the small angles of incidence, the conical scattering geometry and the\nperiodicity of the surface structures, which allows a rigorous computation of\nthe diffraction efficiencies with sufficient numerical precision. To develop\ndimensional metrology tools based on GISAXS, lamellar gratings with line widths\ndown to 55 nm were produced by state-of-the-art e-beam lithography and then\netched into silicon. The high surface sensitivity of GISAXS in conjunction with\na Maxwell solver allows a detailed reconstruction of the grating line shape\nalso for thick, non-homogeneous substrates. The reconstructed geometrical line\nshape models are statistically validated by applying a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) sampling technique which reveals that GISAXS is able to reconstruct\ncritical parameters like the widths of the lines with sub-nm uncertainty.\n", "  Liquids relax extremely slowly upon approaching the glass state. One\nexplanation is that an entropy crisis, due to the rarefaction of available\nstates, makes it increasingly arduous to reach equilibrium in that regime.\nValidating this scenario is challenging, because experiments offer limited\nresolution, while numerical studies lag more than eight orders of magnitude\nbehind experimentally-relevant timescales. In this work we not only close the\ncolossal gap between experiments and simulations but manage to create in-silico\nconfigurations that have no experimental analog yet. Deploying a range of\ncomputational tools, we obtain four estimates of their configurational entropy.\nThese measurements consistently confirm that the steep entropy decrease\nobserved in experiments is also found in simulations, even beyond the\nexperimental glass transition. Our numerical results thus extend the new\nobservational window into the physics of glasses and reinforce the relevance of\nan entropy crisis for understanding their formation.\n", "  We consider interference between the Higgs signal and QCD background in\n$gg\\rightarrow h \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ and its effect on the on-shell Higgs\nrate. The existence of sizable strong phases leads to destructive interference\nof about 2% of the on-shell cross section in the Standard Model. This effect\ncan be enhanced by beyond the standard model physics. In particular, since it\nscales differently from the usual rates, the presence of interference allows\nindirect limits to be placed on the Higgs width in a novel way, using on-shell\nrate measurements. Our study motivates further QCD calculations to reduce\nuncertainties. We discuss potential width-sensitive observables, both using\ntotal and differential rates and find that the HL-LHC can potentially\nindirectly probe widths of order tens of MeV.\n", "  We characterize the contribution from accreted material to the galactic discs\nof the Auriga Project, a set of high resolution magnetohydrodynamic\ncosmological simulations of late-type galaxies performed with the moving-mesh\ncode AREPO. Our goal is to explore whether a significant accreted (or ex-situ)\nstellar component in the Milky Way disc could be hidden within the\nnear-circular orbit population, which is strongly dominated by stars born\nin-situ. One third of our models shows a significant ex-situ disc but this\nfraction would be larger if constraints on orbital circularity were relaxed.\nMost of the ex-situ material ($\\gtrsim 50\\%$) comes from single massive\nsatellites ($> 6 \\times 10^{10}~M_{\\odot}$). These satellites are accreted with\na wide range of infall times and inclination angles (up to $85^{\\circ}$).\nEx-situ discs are thicker, older and more metal-poor than their in-situ\ncounterparts. They show a flat median age profile, which differs from the\nnegative gradient observed in the in-situ component. As a result, the\nlikelihood of identifying an ex-situ disc in samples of old stars on\nnear-circular orbits increases towards the outskirts of the disc. We show three\nexamples that, in addition to ex-situ discs, have a strongly rotating dark\nmatter component. Interestingly, two of these ex-situ stellar discs show an\norbital circularity distribution that is consistent with that of the in-situ\ndisc. Thus, they would not be detected in typical kinematic studies.\n", "  We analyze correlations between pairs of particle detectors quadratically\ncoupled to a real scalar field. We find that, while a single quadratically\ncoupled detector presents no divergences, when one considers pairs of detectors\nthere emerge unanticipated persistent divergences (not regularizable via smooth\nswitching or smearing) in the entanglement they acquire from the field. We have\ncharacterized such divergences, discussed whether a suitable regularization can\nallow for fair comparison of the entanglement harvesting ability of the\nquadratic and the linear couplings, and finally we have found a UV-safe\nquantifier of harvested correlations. Our results are relevant to future\nstudies of the entanglement structure of the fermionic vacuum.\n", "  We report experimental results on the injection of a magnetized plasma jet\ninto a transverse background magnetic field in the HelCat linear plasma device\nat the University of New Mexico [M. Gilmore et al., J. Plasma Phys. 81,\n345810104 (2015)]. After the plasma jet leaves the plasma-gun muzzle, a tension\nforce arising from an increasing curvature of the background magnetic field\ninduces in the jet a sheared axial-flow gradient above the theoretical\nkink-stabilization threshold. We observe that this emergent sheared axial flow\nstabilizes the n=1 kink mode in the jet, whereas a kink instability is observed\nin the jet when there is no background magnetic field presented.\n", "  We show that a smooth interface between two insulators of opposite\ntopological Z2 indices possesses multiple surface states, both massless and\nmassive. While the massless surface state is non-degenerate, chiral and\ninsensitive to the interface potential, the massive surface states only appear\nfor a sufficiently smooth heterojunction. The surface states are particle-hole\nsymmetric and a voltage drop reveals their intrinsic relativistic nature,\nsimilarly to Landau bands of Dirac electrons in a magnetic field. We discuss\nthe relevance of the massive Dirac surface states in recent ARPES and transport\nexperiments.\n", "  The galaxy NGC 4418 harbours a compact ($<20$ pc) core with a very high\nbolometric luminosity ($\\sim10^{11}$L$_\\odot$). As most of the galaxy's energy\noutput comes from this small region, it is of interest to determine what fuels\nthis intense activity. An interaction with VV 655 has been proposed, where gas\naquired by NGC 4418 could trigger intense star formation and/or black hole\naccretion in the centre. We aim to constrain the interaction hypothesis by\nstudying neutral hydrogen structures around the two galaxies. We present\nobservations at 1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array of radio continuum as well as\nemission and absorption from atomic hydrogen. Gaussian distributions are fitted\nto observed HI emission and absorption spectra. An atomic HI bridge is seen in\nemission, connecting NGC 4418 to VV 655. While NGC 4418 is bright in continuum\nemission and seen in HI absorption, VV 655 is barely detected in the continuum\nbut show bright HI emission (M$_\\mathrm{HI}\\sim10^9$ M$_\\odot$). We estimate\nSFRs from 1.4 GHz of 3.2 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and 0.13 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for\nNGC 4418 and VV 655 respectively. Systemic HI velocities of 2202$\\pm$20 km\ns$^{-1}$ (emission) and 2105.4$\\pm$10 km s$^{-1}$ (absorption) are measured for\nVV 655 and NGC 4418 respectively. Redshifted HI absorption is seen towards NGC\n4418, suggesting gas infall. Blueshifted HI-emission is seen north-west of NGC\n4418, which we interpret as a continuation of the outflow previously discussed\nby Sakamoto et al. (2013). The morphology and velocity structure seen in HI is\nconsistent with an interaction scenario, where gas was transferred from VV 655\nto NGC 4418, and may fuel the activity in the centre.\n", "  We present the discovery of two planetary systems consisting of a Saturn-mass\nplanet orbiting an M-dwarf, which were detected in faint microlensing events\nOGLE-2013-BLG-0132 and OGLE-2013-BLG-1721. The planetary anomalies were covered\nwith high cadence by OGLE and MOA photometric surveys. The light curve modeling\nindicates that the planet-to-host mass ratios are $(5.15 \\pm 0.28)\\times\n10^{-4}$ and $(13.18 \\pm 0.72)\\times 10^{-4}$, respectively. Both events were\ntoo short and too faint to measure a reliable parallax signal and hence the\nlens mass. We therefore used a Bayesian analysis to estimate the masses of both\nplanets: $0.29^{+0.16}_{-0.13}\\ M_{Jup}$ (OGLE-2013-BLG-0132Lb) and\n$0.64^{+0.35}_{-0.31}\\ M_{Jup}$ (OGLE-2013-BLG-1721Lb). Thanks to a high\nrelative proper motion, OGLE-2013-BLG-0132 is a promising candidate for the\nhigh-resolution imaging follow-up. Both planets belong to an increasing sample\nof sub-Jupiter-mass planets orbiting M-dwarfs beyond the snow line.\n", "  The magnetic properties of the pyrochlore iridate material Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$\n(5$d^5$) have been studied based on the first principle calculations, where the\ncrystal field splitting $\\Delta$, spin-orbit coupling (SOC) $\\lambda$ and\nCoulomb interaction $U$ within Ir 5$d$ orbitals are all playing significant\nroles. The ground state phase diagram has been obtained with respect to the\nstrength of SOC and Coulomb interaction $U$, where a stable anti-ferromagnetic\nground state with all-in/all-out (AIAO) spin structure has been found. Besides,\nanother anti-ferromagnetic states with close energy to AIAO have also been\nfound to be stable. The calculated nonlinear magnetization of the two stable\nstates both have the d-wave pattern but with a $\\pi/4$ phase difference, which\ncan perfectly explain the experimentally observed nonlinear magnetization\npattern. Compared with the results of the non-distorted structure, it turns out\nthat the trigonal lattice distortion is crucial for stabilizing the AIAO state\nin Eu$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Furthermore, besides large dipolar moments, we also find\nconsiderable octupolar moments in the magnetic states.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity in many materials is believed to be mediated\nby magnetic fluctuations. It is an open question how magnetic order can emerge\nfrom a superconducting condensate and how it competes with the magnetic spin\nresonance in unconventional superconductors. Here we study a model d-wave\nsuperconductor that develops spin-density wave order, and find that the spin\nresonance is unaffected by the onset of static magnetic order. This result\nsuggests a scenario, in which the resonance in Nd0.05Ce0.95CoIn5 is a\nlongitudinal mode with fluctuating moments along the ordered magnetic moments.\n", "  Superconductivity occurs in the proximity of other competing orders in a wide\nvariety of materials. Such competing phases may reveal themselves when\nsuperconductivity is locally suppressed by a magnetic field in the core of a\nvortex. We explore the competition between superconductivity and charge density\nwave order in the attractive Hubbard model on a square lattice. Using\nBogoliubov-deGennes mean field theory, we study how vortex structures form and\nevolve as the magnetic flux is tuned. Each vortex seeds a CDW region whose size\nis determined by the energy cost of the competing phase. The vortices form a\nlattice whose lattice parameter shrinks with increasing flux. Eventually, their\ncharge-ordered vortex cores overlap, leading to a field-driven coexistence\nphase exhibiting both macroscopic charge order and superconductivity -- a\n`supersolid'. Ultimately, superconductivity disappears via a first-order phase\ntransition into a purely charge ordered state. We construct a phase diagram\ncontaining these multiple ordered states, using $t'$, the next-nearest\nneighbour hopping, to tune the competition between phases.\n", "  We present numerical results for the equation of state of an infinite chain\nof hydrogen atoms. A variety of modern many-body methods are employed, with\nexhaustive cross-checks and validation. Approaches for reaching the continuous\nspace limit and the thermodynamic limit are investigated, proposed, and tested.\nThe detailed comparisons provide a benchmark for assessing the current state of\nthe art in many-body computation, and for the development of new methods. The\nground-state energy per atom in the linear chain is accurately determined\nversus bondlength, with a confidence bound given on all uncertainties.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in\nthin films of tantalum nitride. At zero magnetic field, films can be\ndisorder-tuned across the SIT by adjusting thickness and film stoichiometry;\ninsulating films exhibit classical hopping transport. Superconducting films\nexhibit a magnetic field-tuned SIT, whose insulating ground state at high field\nappears to be a quantum-corrected metal. Scaling behavior at the field-tuned\nSIT shows classical percolation critical exponents $z \\nu \\approx$ 1.3, with a\ncorresponding critical field $H_c \\ll H_{c2}$. The Hall effect shows a crossing\npoint near $H_c$, but with a non-universal critical value $\\rho_{xy}^c$\ncomparable to the normal state Hall resistivity. We propose that high-carrier\ndensity metals will always exhibit this pattern of behavior at the boundary\nbetween superconducting and (trivially) insulating ground states.\n", "  We give an introduction to several regularization schemes that deal with\nultraviolet and infrared singularities appearing in higher-order computations\nin quantum field theories. Comparing the computation of simple quantities in\nthe various schemes, we point out similarities and differences between them.\n", "  The peculiar shape of the Fermi surface of topological nodal line semimetals\nat low carrier concentrations results in their unusual optical and transport\nproperties. We analytically investigate the linear optical responses of three\nand two-dimensional nodal line semimetals using the Kubo formula. The optical\nconductivity of a three-dimensional nodal line semimetal is anisotropic. Along\nthe axial direction (\\textit{i.e.}, the direction perpendicular to the\nnodal-ring plane), the Drude weight has a linear dependence on the chemical\npotential at both low and high carrier dopings. For the radial direction\n(\\textit{i.e.}, the direction parallel to the nodal-ring plane), this\ndependence changes from linear into quadratic in the transition from low into\nhigh carrier concentration. The interband contribution into optical\nconductivity is also anisotropic. In particular, at large frequencies, it\nsaturates to a constant value for the axial direction and linearly increases\nwith frequency along the radial direction. In two-dimensional nodal line\nsemimetals, no interband optical transition could be induced and the only\ncontribution to the optical conductivity arises from the intraband excitations.\nThe corresponding Drude weight is independent of the carrier density at low\ncarrier concentrations and linearly increases with chemical potential at high\ncarrier doping.\n", "  The toric code based on Majorana fermions on mesoscopic superconducting\nislands is a promising candidate for quantum information processing. In the\nlimit of vanishing Cooper-pair tunneling, it has been argued that the phase\ntransition separating the topologically ordered phase of the toric code from\nthe trivial one is in the universality class of (2+1)D-XY. On the other hand,\nin the limit of infinitely large Cooper-pair tunneling, the phase transition is\nin the universality class of (2+1)D-Ising. In this work, we treat the case of\nfinite Cooper-pair tunneling and address the question of how the continuous XY\nsymmetry breaking phase transition turns into a discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking one when the Cooper-pair tunneling rate is increased. We show\nthat this happens through a couple of tricritical points and first order phase\ntransitions. Using a Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the problem to that\nof spins coupled to quantum rotors and subsequently, propose a Landau field\ntheory for this model that matches the known results in the respective limits.\nWe calculate the effective field theories and provide the relevant critical\nexponents for the different phase transitions. Our results are relevant for\npredicting the stability of the topological phase in realistic experimental\nimplementations.\n", "  The spreading and regulation of epigenetic marks on chromosomes is crucial to\nestablish and maintain cellular identity. Nonetheless, the dynamical mechanism\nleading to the establishment and maintenance of a given, cell-line specific,\nepigenetic pattern is still poorly understood. In this work we propose, and\ninvestigate in silico, a possible experimental strategy to illuminate the\ninterplay between 3D chromatin structure and epigenetic dynamics. We consider a\nset-up where a reconstituted chromatin fibre is stretched at its two ends\n(e.g., by laser tweezers), while epigenetic enzymes (writers) and\nchromatin-binding proteins (readers) are flooded into the system. We show that,\nby tuning the stretching force and the binding affinity of the readers for\nchromatin, the fibre undergoes a sharp transition between a stretched,\nepigenetically disordered, state and a crumpled, epigenetically coherent, one.\nWe further investigate the case in which a knot is tied along the chromatin\nfibre, and find that the knotted segment enhances local epigenetic order,\ngiving rise to \"epigenetic solitons\" which travel and diffuse along chromatin.\nOur results point to an intriguing coupling between 3D chromatin topology and\nepigenetic dynamics, which may be investigated via single molecule experiments.\n", "  Inspired by the so appealing example of red giants, where going from a\nhandful of stars to thousands revealed the structure of the eigenspectrum, we\ninspected a large homogeneous set of around 1860 {\\delta} Scuti stars observed\nwith CoRoT. This unique data set reveals a common regular pattern which appears\nto be in agreement with island modes featured by theoretical non-perturbative\ntreatments of fast rotation. The comparison of these data with models and\nlinear stability calculations suggests that spectra can be fruitfully\ncharacterized to first order by a few parameters which might play the role of\nseismic indices for {\\delta} Scuti stars, as {\\Delta \\nu} and {\\nu_{max}} do\nfor red giants. The existence of this pattern offers an observational support\nfor guiding further theoretical works on fast rotation. It also provides a\nframework for further investigation of the observational material collected by\nCoRoT and Kepler. Finally, it sketches out the perspective of using {\\delta}\nScuti stars pulsations for ensemble asteroseismology.\n", "  We discuss optimal strategy for follow-up observations by 1-3 m class\noptical/infrared telescopes which target optical/infrared counterparts of\ngravitational wave events detected with two laser interferometric gravitational\nwave detectors. The probability maps of transient sources, such as coalescing\nneutron stars and/or black holes, determined by two laser interferometers\ngenerally spread widely. They include the distant region where it is difficult\nfor small aperture telescopes to observe the optical/infrared counterparts. For\nsmall telescopes, there is a possibility that it is more advantageous to search\nfor nearby region even if the probability inferred by two gravitational wave\ndetectors is low. We show that in the case of the first three events of\nadvanced LIGO, the posterior probability map, derived by using a distance prior\nrestricted to a nearby region, is different from that derived without such\nrestriction. This suggests that the optimal strategy for small telescopes to\nperform follow-up observation of LIGO-Virgo's three events are different from\nwhat has been searched so far. We also show that, when the binary is nearly\nedge-on, it is possible that the true direction is not included in the 90%\nposterior probability region. We discuss the optimal strategy to perform\noptical/infrared follow-up observation with small aperture telescopes based on\nthese facts.\n", "  The interaction of a single photon with an individual two-level system is the\ntextbook example of quantum electrodynamics. Achieving strong coupling in this\nsystem so far required confinement of the light field inside resonators or\nwaveguides. Here, we demonstrate strong coherent coupling between a single\nRydberg superatom, consisting of thousands of atoms behaving as a single\ntwo-level system due to the Rydberg blockade, and a propagating light pulse\ncontaining only a few photons. The strong light-matter coupling in combination\nwith the direct access to the outgoing field allows us to observe for the first\ntime the effect of the interactions on the driving field at the single photon\nlevel. We find that all our results are in quantitative agreement with the\npredictions of the theory of a single two-level system strongly coupled to a\nsingle quantized propagating light mode. The demonstrated coupling strength\nopens the way towards interfacing photonic and atomic qubits and preparation of\npropagating non-classical states of light, two crucial building blocks in\nfuture quantum networks.\n", "  We measured stacked weak lensing cluster masses for a sample of 1325 galaxy\nclusters detected by the RedGOLD algorithm in the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope Legacy Survey W1 and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey at\n$0.2<z<0.5$, in the optical richness range $10<\\lambda<70$. After a selection\nof our best richness subsample ($20<\\lambda<50$), this is the most\ncomprehensive lensing study of a $\\sim 100\\%$ complete and $\\sim 90\\%$ pure\noptical cluster catalogue in this redshift range, with a total of 346 clusters\nin $\\sim164~deg^2$. We test three different mass models, and our best model\nincludes a basic halo model, with a Navarro Frenk and White profile, and\ncorrection terms that take into account cluster miscentering, non-weak shear,\nthe two-halo term, the contribution of the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, and an a\nposteriori correction for the intrinsic scatter in the mass-richness relation.\nWith this model, we obtain a mass-richness relation of $\\log{M_{\\rm\n200}/M_{\\odot}}=(14.48\\pm0.04)+(1.14\\pm0.23)\\log{(\\lambda/40)}$ (statistical\nuncertainties). This result is consistent with other published lensing\nmass-richness relations. When compared to X-ray masses and mass proxies, we\nfind that on average weak lensing masses are $\\sim 10\\%$ higher than those\nderived in the X-ray in the range $2\\times10^{13}M_{\\rm \\odot}<E(z) M^{X}_{\\rm\n200}<2\\times10^{14}M_{\\rm \\odot}$, in agreement with most previous results and\nsimulations. We also give the coefficients of the scaling relations between the\nlensing mass and X-ray mass proxies, $L_X$ and $T_X$, and compare them with\nprevious results.\n", "  A search for new phenomena is performed using events with jets and\nsignificant transverse momentum imbalance, as inferred through the MT2\nvariable. The results are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions\ncollected in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector\nand corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. No\nexcess event yield is observed above the predicted standard model background,\nand the results are interpreted as exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on\nthe masses of predicted particles in a variety of simplified models of R-parity\nconserving supersymmetry. Depending on the details of the model, 95% confidence\nlevel lower limits on the gluino (light-flavor squark) masses are placed up to\n2025 (1550) GeV. Mass limits as high as 1070 (1175) GeV are set on the masses\nof top (bottom) squarks. Information is provided to enable re-interpretation of\nthese results, including model-independent limits on the number of non-standard\nmodel events for a set of simplified, inclusive search regions.\n", "  The gravitino mass is expected not to be much smaller than the Planck scale\nfor a large fraction of vacua in flux compactifications. There is no continuous\nparameter to tune even by hand, and it seems that the gravitino mass can be\nsmall only as a result of accidental cancellation among period integrals\nweighted by integer-valued flux quanta. DeWolfe et.al. (2005) proposed to pay\nclose attention to vacua where the Hodge decomposition is possible within a\nnumber field, so that the precise cancellation takes place as a result of\nalgebra. We focus on a subclass of those vacua---those with complex\nmultiplications---and explore more on the idea in this article. It turns out,\nin Type IIB compactifications, that those vacua admit non-trivial\nsupersymmetric flux configurations if and only if the reflex field of the Weil\nintermediate Jacobian is isomorphic to the quadratic imaginary field generated\nby the axidilaton vacuum expectation value. We also found that flux statistics\nis highly enriched on such vacua, as F-term conditions become linearly\ndependent.\n", "  Taxonomy of radio pulsar profiles is mostly based on a system of Ptolemaic\nartificiality, consisting of separated rings and a core, arbitrarily located at\ndisparate altitudes in the magnetosphere. Diversity of observed profile shapes\nclearly exceeds the interpretive capability of such conal model. Moreover,\nbifurcated features observed in pulsar profiles imply a system of fan beams\nradially extending away from the dipole axis. The bifurcations can be\nunderstood as the imprint of the elementary radiation pattern of the\nlong-sought radio emission mechanism, thus identifying the latter. Their size,\nhowever, is several times larger than implied by the curvature of magnetic\ndipole lines. Here I show that the illusion of disconnected rings and the size\nof bifurcated features can be explained through a natural geometry which\ncombines the properties of both the cone and the fan beam. It is a flaring\nspiral which makes several revolutions around the dipole axis on its way to\nleave the magnetosphere. Such geometry is consistent with a stream of\noutflowing and laterally drifting plasma. The bifurcated components are so\nwide, because the curvature on such a spiral is larger than that of the dipolar\nmagnetic field, hence they are consistent with the extraordinary mode curvature\nradiation.\n", "  Dynamical properties of a Vicsek-like gas of self-propelled particles are\ninvestigated by means of kinetic theory and agent based simulations. While\nmemory effects have been observed in disordered systems, we show that they also\noccur in active matter systems. In particular, we find that the system exhibits\na giant Kovacs-like memory effect that is much larger than predicted by a\ngeneric linear theory. Based on a separation of time scales we develop a\nnonlinear theory to explain this effect. We apply this theory to driven\ngranular gases and propose further applications to spin glasses.\n", "  Disk polarization at (sub)millimeter wavelengths is being revolutionized by\nALMA observationally, but its origin remains uncertain. Dust scattering was\nrecently recognized as a potential contributor to polarization, although its\nbasic properties have yet to be thoroughly explored. Here, we quantify the\neffects of optical depth on the scattering-induced polarization in inclined\ndisks through a combination of analytical illustration, approximate\nsemi-analytical modeling using formal solution to the radiative transfer\nequation, and Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the near-side of the disk\nis significantly brighter in polarized intensity than the far-side, provided\nthat the disk is optically thick and that the scattering grains have yet to\nsettle to the midplane. This asymmetry is the consequence of a simple geometric\neffect: the near-side of the disk surface is viewed more edge-on than the\nfar-side. It is a robust signature that may be used to distinguish the\nscattering-induced polarization from that by other mechanisms, such as aligned\ngrains. The asymmetry is weaker for a geometrically thinner dust disk. As such,\nit opens an exciting new window on dust settling. We find anecdotal evidence\nfrom dust continuum imaging of edge-on disks that large grains are not yet\nsettled in the youngest (Class 0) disks, but become more so in older disks.\nThis trend is corroborated by the polarization data in inclined disks showing\nthat younger disks have more pronounced near-far side asymmetry and thus less\ngrain settling. If confirmed, the trend would have far-reaching implications\nfor grain evolution and, ultimately, the formation of planetesimals and\nplanets.\n", "  It has been proposed that magnetic activity could be enhanced due to\ninteractions between close-in massive planets and their host stars. In this\narticle, I present a brief overview of the connection between stellar magnetic\nactivity and exoplanets. Stellar activity can be probed in chromospheric lines,\ncoronal emission, surface spot coverage, etc. Since these are manifestations of\nstellar magnetism, these measurements are often used as proxies for the\nmagnetic field of stars. Here, instead of focusing on the magnetic proxies, I\noverview some recent results of magnetic field measurements using\nspectropolarimetric observations. Firstly, I discuss the general trends found\nbetween large-scale magnetism, stellar rotation, and coronal emission and show\nthat magnetism seems to be correlated to the internal structure of the star.\nSecondly, I overview some works that show evidence that exoplanets could (or\nnot) act as to enhance the activity of their host stars.\n", "  In the light of latest data of neutrino oscillation experiments, we carry out\na systematic investigation on the texture structures of Majorana neutrino mass\nmatrix $M_{\\nu}$, which contain one vanishing neutrino mass and an equality\nbetween two matrix elements. Among 15 logically possible patterns, it is found\nthat for norm order ($m_{3}>m_{2}>m_{1}=0$) of neutrino masses only five of\nthem are compatible with recent experimental data at the $3\\sigma$ level, while\nfor inverted order ($m_{2}>m_{1}>m_{3}=0$) ten patterns is phenomenologically\nallowed. In the numerical analysis, we perform a scan over the parameter space\nof all viable patterns to get a large sample of scattering points. We present\nthe implications of each allowed pattern for three mixing angles\n$(\\theta_{12},\\theta_{2},\\theta_{3})$, leptonic CP violation and neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay, predicting strong correlations between oscillation\nparameters. The theoretical realization of a concrete example is discussed in\nthe framework of Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism.\n", "  From its surface properties it can be difficult to determine whether a\nred-giant star is in its helium-core-burning phase or only burning hydrogen in\na shell around an inert helium core. Stars in either of these stages can have\nsimilar effective temperatures, radii and hence luminosities, i.e. they can be\nlocated at the same position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nAsteroseismology -- the study of the internal structure of stars through their\nglobal oscillations -- can provide the necessary additional constraints to\ndetermine the evolutionary states of red-giant stars. Here, we present a method\nthat uses grid-based modelling based on global asteroseismic properties\n($\\nu_{\\rm max}$, frequency of maximum oscillation power; and $\\Delta\\nu$,\nfrequency spacing between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial\norders) as well as effective temperature and metallicity to determine the\nevolutionary phases. This method is applicable even to timeseries data of\nlimited length, although with a small fraction of miss-classifications.\n", "  We investigate the optical response to the THz pulses in the s-wave and\n($s$+$p$)-wave superconducting semiconductor quantum wells by using the\ngauge-invariant optical Bloch equations, in which the gauge structure in the\nsuperconductivity is explicitly retained. By using the gauge transformation,\nnot only can the microscopic description for the quasiparticle dynamics be\nrealized, but also the dynamics of the condensate is included, with the\nsuperfluid velocity and the effective chemical potential naturally\nincorporated. We reveal that the superfluid velocity itself can contribute to\nthe pump of quasiparticles (pump effect), with its rate of change acting as the\ndrive field to drive the quasiparticles (drive effect). Specifically, the drive\neffect can contribute to the formation of the blocking region for the\nquasiparticle, which directly suppresses the anomalous correlation of the\nCooper pairs. We find that both the pump and drive effects contribute to the\noscillations of the Higgs mode with twice the frequency of the optical field.\nHowever, it is shown that the contribution from the drive effect to the\nexcitation of Higgs mode is dominant as long as the driven superconducting\nmomentum is less than the Fermi momentum. This is in contrast to the conclusion\nfrom the Liouville or Bloch equations in the literature, in which the drive\neffect on the anomalous correlation is overlooked with only the pump effect\nconsidered.Furthermore, in the gauge-invariant optical Bloch equations, the\ncharge neutrality condition is {\\em consistently} considered based on the\ntwo-component model for the charge, in which the charge imbalance of\nquasiparticles can cause the fluctuation of the effective chemical potential.\n......\n", "  We study a large galaxy sample from the Spitzer Matching Survey of the\nUltraVISTA ultra-deep Stripes (SMUVS) to search for sources with enhanced 3.6\nmicron fluxes indicative of strong Halpha emission at z=3.9-4.9. We find that\nthe percentage of \"Halpha excess\" sources reaches 37-40% for galaxies with\nstellar masses log10(M*/Msun) ~ 9-10, and decreases to <20% at log10(M*/Msun) ~\n10.7. At higher stellar masses, however, the trend reverses, although this is\nlikely due to AGN contamination. We derive star formation rates (SFR) and\nspecific SFR (sSFR) from the inferred Halpha equivalent widths (EW) of our\n\"Halpha excess\" galaxies. We show, for the first time, that the \"Halpha excess\"\ngalaxies clearly have a bimodal distribution on the SFR-M* plane: they lie on\nthe main sequence of star formation (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1})<-8.05) or in a\nstarburst cloud (with log10(sSFR/yr^{-1}) >-7.60). The latter contains ~15% of\nall the objects in our sample and accounts for >50% of the cosmic SFR density\nat z=3.9-4.9, for which we derive a robust lower limit of 0.066 Msun yr^{-1}\nMpc^{-3}. Finally, we identify an unusual >50sigma overdensity of z=3.9-4.9\ngalaxies within a 0.20 x 0.20 sq. arcmin region. We conclude that the SMUVS\nunique combination of area and depth at mid-IR wavelengths provides an\nunprecedented level of statistics and dynamic range which are fundamental to\nreveal new aspects of galaxy evolution in the young Universe.\n", "  The Hitomi X-ray satellite has provided the first direct measurements of the\nplasma velocity dispersion in a galaxy cluster. It finds a relatively\n\"quiescent\" gas with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion ~ 160 km/s, at 30 kpc\nto 60 kpc from the cluster center. This is surprising given the presence of\njets and X-ray cavities that indicates on-going activity and feedback from the\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) at the cluster center. Using a set of mock Hitomi\nobservations generated from a suite of state-of-the-art cosmological cluster\nsimulations, and an isolated but higher resolution simulation of gas physics in\nthe cluster core, including the effects of cooling and AGN feedback, we examine\nthe likelihood of Hitomi detecting a cluster with the observed velocities. As\nlong as the Perseus has not experienced a major merger in the last few\ngigayears, and AGN feedback is operating in a \"gentle\" mode, we reproduce the\nlevel of gas motions observed by Hitomi. The frequent mechanical AGN feedback\ngenerates net line-of-sight velocity dispersions ~100-200 km/s, bracketing the\nvalues measured in the Perseus core. The large-scale velocity shear observed\nacross the core, on the other hand, is generated mainly by cosmic accretion\nsuch as mergers. We discuss the implications of these results for AGN feedback\nphysics and cluster cosmology and progress that needs to be made in both\nsimulations and observations, including a Hitomi re-flight and\ncalorimeter-based instruments with higher spatial resolution.\n", "  We report neutron scattering measurements on Er$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$, a new\naddition to the XY family of frustrated pyrochlore magnets. Symmetry analysis\nof our elastic scattering data shows that Er$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ is the first XY\npyrochlore to order into the $k=0$, $\\Gamma_7$ magnetic structure (the\nPalmer-Chalker state), at $T_N = 0.38$ K. This contrasts with its sister XY\npyrochlore antiferromagnets Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Er$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$, both of\nwhich order into $\\Gamma_5$ magnetic structures at much higher temperatures,\n$T_N=1.2$ K and $1.4$ K, respectively. In this temperature range, the magnetic\nheat capacity of Er$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ contains a broad anomaly centered at\n$T^*=1.5$ K. Our inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal that this\nbroad heat capacity anomaly sets the temperature scale for strong short-range\nspin fluctuations. Below $T_N = 0.38$ K, Er$_2$Pt$_2$O$_7$ displays a gapped\nspin wave spectrum with an intense, flat band of excitations at lower energy\nand a weak, diffusive band of excitations at higher energy. The flat band is\nwell-described by classical spin wave calculations, but these calculations also\npredict sharp dispersive branches at higher energy, a striking discrepancy with\nthe experimental data. This, in concert with the strong suppression of $T_N$,\nis attributable to enhanced quantum fluctuations due to phase competition\nbetween the $\\Gamma_7$ and $\\Gamma_5$ states that border each other within a\nclassically predicted phase diagram.\n", "  The AMD-stability criterion allows to discriminate between a-priori stable\nplanetary systems and systems for which the stability is not granted and needs\nfurther investigations. AMD-stability is based on the conservation of the\nAngular Momentum Deficit (AMD) in the averaged system at all orders of\naveraging. While the AMD criterion is rigorous, the conservation of the AMD is\nonly granted in absence of mean-motion resonances (MMR). Here we extend the\nAMD-stability criterion to take into account mean-motion resonances, and more\nspecifically the overlap of first order MMR. If the MMR islands overlap, the\nsystem will experience generalized chaos leading to instability. The\nHamiltonian of two massive planets on coplanar quasi-circular orbits can be\nreduced to an integrable one degree of freedom problem for period ratios close\nto a first order MMR. We use the reduced Hamiltonian to derive a new overlap\ncriterion for first order MMR. This stability criterion unifies the previous\ncriteria proposed in the literature and admits the criteria obtained for\ninitially circular and eccentric orbits as limit cases. We then improve the\ndefinition of AMD-stability to take into account the short term chaos generated\nby MMR overlap. We analyze the outcome of this improved definition of\nAMD-stability on selected multi-planet systems from the Extrasolar Planets\nEncyclopeadia.\n", "  With the advent of dedicated photometric space missions, the ability to\nrapidly process huge catalogues of stars has become paramount. Bellinger and\nAngelou et al. (2016) recently introduced a new method based on machine\nlearning for inferring the stellar parameters of main-sequence stars exhibiting\nsolar-like oscillations. The method makes precise predictions that are\nconsistent with other methods, but with the advantages of being able to explore\nmany more parameters while costing practically no time. Here we apply the\nmethod to 52 so-called \"LEGACY\" main-sequence stars observed by the Kepler\nspace mission. For each star, we present estimates and uncertainties of mass,\nage, radius, luminosity, core hydrogen abundance, surface helium abundance,\nsurface gravity, initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity as well as\nestimates of their evolutionary model parameters of mixing length, overshooting\ncoefficient, and diffusion multiplication factor. We obtain median\nuncertainties in stellar age, mass, and radius of 14.8%, 3.6%, and 1.7%,\nrespectively.\n  The source code for all analyses and for all figures appearing in this\nmanuscript can be found electronically at:\nhttps://github.com/earlbellinger/asteroseismology\n", "  We create isochrones of M67 using the Yale Rotating Stellar Evolution Code.\nIn addition to metallicity, parameters that are traditionally held fixed, such\nas the mixing length parameter and initial helium abundance, also vary. The\namount of convective overshoot is also changed in different sets of isochrones.\nModels are constructed both with and without diffusion. From the resulting\nisochrones that fit the cluster, the age range is between 3.6 and 4.8 Gyr and\nthe distance is between 755 and 868 pc. We also confirm Michaud et al. (2004)\nclaim that M67 can be fit without overshoot if diffusion is included.\n", "  We derive new fermionic expressions for the characters of the Virasoro\nminimal models $M(k,2k\\pm1)$ by analysing the recently introduced half-lattice\npaths. These fermionic expressions display a quasiparticle formulation\ncharacteristic of the $\\phi_{2,1}$ and $\\phi_{1,5}$ integrable perturbations.\nWe find that they arise by imposing a simple restriction on the RSOS\nquasiparticle states of the unitary models $M(p,p+1)$. In fact, four fermionic\nexpressions are obtained for each generating function of half-lattice paths of\nfinite length $L$, and these lead to four distinct expressions for most\ncharacters $\\chi^{k,2k\\pm1}_{r,s}$. These are direct analogues of Melzer's\nexpressions for $M(p,p+1)$, and their proof entails revisiting, reworking and\nrefining a proof of Melzer's identities which used combinatorial transforms on\nlattice paths.\n  We also derive a bosonic version of the generating functions of length $L$\nhalf-lattice paths, this expression being notable in that it involves\n$q$-trinomial coefficients. Taking the $L\\to\\infty$ limit shows that the\ngenerating functions for infinite length half-lattice paths are indeed the\nVirasoro characters $\\chi^{k,2k\\pm1}_{r,s}$.\n", "  Recent photoemission spectroscopy measurements [arXiv:1509.01611] on cuprate\nsuperconductors have inferred that over a wide range of doping, the imaginary\npart of the electron self-energy scales as\n$\\Sigma^{\\prime\\prime}\\sim(\\omega^2+\\pi^2T^2)^a$ with $a=1$ in the overdoped\nFermi-liquid state and $a<0.5$ in the optimal to underdoped regime. We show\nthat this non-Fermi-liquid scaling behavior can naturally be explained by the\npresence of a scale-invariant state of matter known as unparticles. We evaluate\nanalytically the electron self-energy due to interactions with fermionic\nunparticles. We find that, in agreement with experiments, the imaginary part of\nthe self-energy scales with respect to temperature and energy as\n$\\Sigma^{\\prime\\prime}\\sim T^{2+2\\alpha}$ and $\\omega^{2+2\\alpha}$, where\n$\\alpha$ is the anomalous dimension of the unparticle propagator. In addition,\nthe calculated occupancy and susceptibility of fermionic unparticles, unlike\nthose of normal fermions, have significant spectral weights even at high\nenergies. This unconventional behavior is attributed to the branch cut in the\nunparticle propagator which broadens the unparticle spectral function over a\nwide energy range and non-trivially alters the scattering phase space by\nenhancing (suppressing) the intrinsic susceptibility at low energies for\nnegative (positive) $\\alpha$. Our work presents new evidence suggesting that\nunparticles might be important low-energy degrees of freedom in strongly\ncoupled systems such as the cuprate superconductors.\n", "  We show that the essential properties of a Feshbach resonance in cold atomic\ngases can be tuned by dressing the atomic states in different scattering\nchannels through inter-channel couplings. Such a scheme can be readily\nimplemented in the orbital Feshbach resonance of alkaline-earth-like atoms by\ncoupling hyperfine states in the clock-state manifolds. Using $^{173}$Yb atoms\nas an example, we find that both the resonance position and the two-body\nbound-state energy depend sensitively on the inter-channel coupling strength,\nwhich offers control parameters in tuning the inter-atomic interactions. We\nalso demonstrate the dramatic impact of the dressed Feshbach resonance on\nmany-body processes such as the polaron to molecule transition and the BCS-BEC\ncrossover.\n", "  We test common fluence diagnostics in the regime of very low burnup natural\nuranium reactor samples. The fluence diagnostics considered are the uranium\nisotopics ratios $^{235}$U/$^{238}$U and $^{236}$U/$^{235}$U, for which we find\nsimple analytic formulas agree well with full reactor simulation predictions.\nBoth ratios agree reasonably well with one another for fluences in the mid\n$10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{n/cm^2}$ range. However, below about\n$10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{n/cm^2}$ the concentrations of $^{236}$U are found to be\nsufficiently low that the measured $^{236}$U/$^{235}$U ratios become\nunreliable. We also derive and test diagnostics for determining sample cooling\ntimes in situations where very low burnup and very long cooling times render\nmany standard diagnostics, such as the $^{241}$Am/$^{241}$Pu ratio,\nimpractical. We find that using several fragment ratios are necessary to detect\nthe presence of systematic errors, such as fractionation.\n", "  We investigate possible pathways for the formation of the low density\nNeptune-mass planet HAT-P-26b. We use two formation different models based on\npebbles and planetesimals accretion, and includes gas accretion, disk migration\nand simple photoevaporation. The models tracks the atmospheric oxygen\nabundance, in addition to the orbital period, and mass of the forming planets,\nthat we compare to HAT-P-26b. We find that pebbles accretion can explain this\nplanet more naturally than planetesimals accretion that fails completely unless\nwe artificially enhance the disk metallicity significantly. Pebble accretion\nmodels can reproduce HAT-P-26b with either a high initial core mass and low\namount of envelope enrichment through core erosion or pebbles dissolution, or\nthe opposite, with both scenarios being possible. Assuming a low envelope\nenrichment factor as expected from convection theory and comparable to the\nvalues we can infer from the D/H measurements in Uranus and Neptune, our most\nprobable formation pathway for HAT-P-26b is through pebble accretion starting\naround 10 AU early in the disk's lifetime.\n", "  Reionization, the only phase transition in the Universe since recombination,\nis a key event in the cosmic history of baryonic matter. We derive, in the\ncontext of the large-scale bias expansion, the imprints of the epoch of\nreionization in the large-scale distribution of galaxies, and identify two\ncontributions of particular importance. First, the Compton scattering of CMB\nphotons off the free electrons lead to a drag force on the baryon fluid. This\ndrag induces a relative velocity between baryons and CDM which is of the same\norder of magnitude as the primordially-induced relative velocity, and enters in\nthe evolution of the relative velocity as calculated by Boltzmann codes. This\nleads to a unique contribution to galaxy bias involving the matter velocity\nsquared. The second important effect is a modulation of the galaxy density by\nthe ionizing radiation field through radiative-transfer effects, which is\ncaptured in the bias expansion by so-called higher-derivative terms. We\nconstrain both of these imprints using the power spectrum of the BOSS DR12\ngalaxy sample. While they do not lead to a shift in the baryon acoustic\noscillation scale, including these terms is important for unbiased cosmology\nconstraints from the shape of the galaxy power spectrum.\n", "  We compute the leading Post-Newtonian (PN) contributions at linear order in\nthe spin to the radiation-reaction acceleration and spin evolution for binary\nsystems, which enter at fourth PN order. The calculation is carried out, from\nfirst principles, using the effective field theory framework for spinning\ncompact objects, in both the Newton-Wigner and covariant spin supplementary\nconditions. A non-trivial consistency check is performed on our results by\nshowing that the energy loss induced by the resulting radiation-reaction force\nis equivalent to the total emitted power in the far zone, up to so-called\n\"Schott terms.\" We also find that, at this order, the radiation reaction has no\nnet effect on the evolution of the spins. The spin-spin contributions to\nradiation reaction are reported in a companion paper.\n", "  We compute the leading Post-Newtonian (PN) contributions at quadratic order\nin the spins to the radiation-reaction acceleration and spin evolution for\nbinary systems, entering at four-and-a-half PN order. Our calculation includes\nthe back-reaction from finite-size spin effects, which is presented for the\nfirst time. The computation is carried out, from first principles, using the\neffective field theory framework for spinning extended objects. At this order,\nnonconservative effects in the spin-spin sector are independent of the spin\nsupplementary conditions. A non-trivial consistency check is performed by\nshowing that the energy loss induced by the resulting radiation-reaction force\nis equivalent to the total emitted power in the far zone. We find that, in\ncontrast to the spin-orbit contributions (reported in a companion paper), the\nradiation reaction affects the evolution of the spin vectors once spin-spin\neffects are incorporated.\n", "  We report on the first experimental observation of a current-driven\ninstability developing in a quasi-neutral matter-antimatter beam. Strong\nmagnetic fields ($\\geq$ 1 T) are measured, via means of a proton radiography\ntechnique, after the propagation of a neutral electron-positron beam through a\nbackground electron-ion plasma.The experimentally determined equipartition\nparameter of $\\epsilon_B \\approx 10^{-3}$, is typical of values inferred from\nmodels of astrophysical gamma-ray bursts, in which the relativistic flows are\nalso expected to be pair dominated. The data, supported by Particle-In-Cell\nsimulations and simple analytical estimates, indicate that these magnetic\nfields persist in the background plasma for thousands of inverse plasma\nfrequencies. The existence of such long-lived magnetic fields can be related to\nanalog astrophysical systems, such as those prevalent in lepton-dominated jets.\n", "  We show that, in optical pump-probe experiments on bulk samples, the\nstatistical distribution of the intensity of ultrashort light pulses after the\ninteraction with a nonequilibrium complex material can be used to measure the\ntime-dependent noise of the current in the system. We illustrate the general\narguments for a photo-excited Peierls material. The transient noise\nspectroscopy allows to measure to what extent electronic degrees of freedom\ndynamically obey the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and how well they\nthermalize during the coherent lattice vibrations. The proposed statistical\nmeasurement developed here provides a new general framework to retrieve\ndynamical information on the excited distributions in nonequilibrium\nexperiments which could be extended to other degrees of freedom of magnetic or\nvibrational origin.\n", "  We show that higher curvature order gravities, in particular the propagating\nquadratic curvature models, cannot be derived by self-coupling from their\nlinear, flat space, forms, except through an unphysical version of\nlinearization; only GR can. Separately, we comment on an early version of the\nself-coupling bootstrap.\n", "  We propose that the topological semimetal features can co-exist with\nferromagnetic ground state in vanadium-phosphorous-oxide $\\beta$-V$_2$OPO$_4$\ncompound from first-principles calculations. In this magnetic system with\ninversion symmetry, the direction of magnetization is able to manipulate the\nsymmetric protected band structures from a node-line type to a Weyl one in the\npresence of spin-orbital-coupling. The node-line semimetal phase is protected\nby the mirror symmetry with the reflection-invariant plane perpendicular to\nmagnetic order. Within mirror symmetry breaking due to the magnetization along\nother directions, the gapless node-line loop will degenerate to only one pair\nof Weyl points protected by the rotational symmetry along the magnetic axis,\nwhich are largely separated in momentum space. Such Weyl semimetal phase\nprovides a nice candidate with the minimum number of Weyl points in a condensed\nmatter system. The results of surface band calculations confirm the non-trivial\ntopology of this proposed compound. This findings provide a realistic candidate\nfor the investigation of topological semimetals with time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking, particularly towards the realization of quantum anomalous Hall effect\nin Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Robust quantum computation requires encoding delicate quantum information\ninto degrees of freedom that are hard for the environment to change. Quantum\nencodings have been demonstrated in many physical systems by observing and\ncorrecting storage errors, but applications require not just storing\ninformation; we must accurately compute even with faulty operations. The theory\nof fault-tolerant quantum computing illuminates a way forward by providing a\nfoundation and collection of techniques for limiting the spread of errors. Here\nwe implement one of the smallest quantum codes in a five-qubit superconducting\ntransmon device and demonstrate fault-tolerant state preparation. We\ncharacterize the resulting codewords through quantum process tomography and\nstudy the free evolution of the logical observables. Our results are consistent\nwith fault-tolerant state preparation in a protected qubit subspace.\n", "  We consider the effect of relativistic boosts on single particle Gaussian\nwave packets. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted\nobserver is studied as a function of the momentum and the boost parameter.\nUsing various formulations of coherence it is shown that in general the\ncoherence decays with the increase of the momentum of the state, as well as the\nboost applied to it. Employing a basis-independent formulation, we show\nhowever, that coherence may be preserved even for large boosts applied on\nnarrow uncertainty wave packets. Our result is exemplified quantitatively for\npractically realizable neutron wave functions.\n", "  Evidence of exoplanets with orbits that are misaligned with the spin of the\nhost star may suggest that not all bound planets were born in the\nprotoplanetary disk of their current planetary system. Observations have shown\nthat free-floating Jupiter-mass objects can exceed the number of stars in our\ngalaxy, implying that capture scenarios may not be so rare. To address this\nissue, we construct a three-dimensional simulation of a three-body scattering\nbetween a free-floating planet and a star accompanied by a Jupiter-mass bound\nplanet. We distinguish between three different possible scattering outcomes,\nwhere the free-floating planet may get captured after the interaction with the\nbinary, remain unbound, or \"kick-out\" the bound planet and replace it. The\nsimulation was performed for different masses of the free-floating planets and\nstars, as well as different impact parameters, inclination angles and approach\nvelocities. The outcome statistics are used to construct an analytical\napproximation of the cross section for capturing a free-floating planet by\nfitting their dependence on the tested variables. The analytically approximated\ncross section is used to predict the capture rate for these kinds of objects,\nand to estimate that about 1\\% of all stars are expected to experience a\ntemporary capture of a free-floating planet during their lifetime. Finally, we\npropose additional physical processes that may increase the capture statistics\nand whose contribution should be considered in future simulations.\n", "  We generalize the real and chiral $ {\\cal N} =2 $ super Schr\\\"odinger\nalgebras to ${\\mathbb Z}_2 \\times {\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie superalgebras. This\nis done by $D$-module presentation and as a consequence, the $D$-module\npresentations of ${\\mathbb Z}_2 \\times {\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded superalgebras are\nidentical to the ones of super Schr\\\"odinger algebras. We then generalize the\ncalculus over Grassmann number to ${\\mathbb Z}_2 \\times {\\mathbb Z}_2 $\nsetting. Using it and the standard technique of Lie theory, we obtain a vector\nfield realization of ${\\mathbb Z}_2 \\times {\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded superalgebras.\nA vector field realization of the ${\\mathbb Z}_2 \\times {\\mathbb Z}_2 $\ngeneralization of ${\\cal N} = 1 $ super Schr\\\"odinger algebra is also\npresented.\n", "  Using analytic methods and $1$-D two-fluid simulations, we study the effect\nof cosmic rays (CRs) on the dynamics of interstellar superbubbles (ISBs) driven\nby multiple supernovae (SNe)/stellar winds in OB associations. In addition to\nCR advection and diffusion, our models include thermal conduction and radiative\ncooling. We find that CR injection at the reverse shock or within a central\nwind-driving region can affect the thermal profiles of ISBs and hence their\nX-ray properties. Even if a small fraction ($10-20\\%$) of the total mechanical\npower is injected into CRs, a significant fraction of the ram pressure at the\nreverse shock can be transferred to CRs. The energy transfer becomes efficient\nif (1) the reverse shock gas Mach number exceeds a critical value ($M_{\\rm\nth}\\gtrsim 12$) and (2) the CR acceleration time scale $\\tau_{\\rm acc}\\sim\n\\kappa_{\\rm cr}/v^2$ is shorter than the dynamical time, where $\\kappa_{\\rm\ncr}$ is CR diffusion constant and $v$ is the upstream velocity. We show that CR\naffected bubbles can exhibit a volume averaged hot gas temperature\n$1-5\\times10^{6}$ K, lower by a factor of $2-10$ than without CRs. Thus CRs can\npotentially solve the long-standing problem of the observed low ISB\ntemperatures.\n", "  The internal deformation of the brain is far more complex than the rigid\nmotion of the skull. An ultrasound imaging technique that we have developed has\na combination of penetration, frame-rate, and motion detection accuracy\nrequired to directly observe, for the first time, the formation and evolution\nof shear shock waves in the brain. Experiments at low impacts on the traumatic\nbrain injury scale demonstrate that they are spontaneously generated and\npropagate within the porcine brain. Compared to the initially smooth impact,\nthe acceleration at the shock front is amplified up to a factor of 8.5. This\nhighly localized increase in acceleration suggests that shear shock waves are a\nfundamental mechanism for traumatic injuries in soft tissue.\n", "  The cooling flow problem is one of the central problems in galaxy clusters,\nand active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is considered to play a key role in\noffsetting cooling. However, how AGN jets heat and suppress cooling flows\nremains highly debated. Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions. Inflows and trailing\noutflows constitute meridional circulations in the cluster core. At later\ntimes, trailing outflows fall back to the cluster centre, triggering central\ncooling catastrophe and potentially a new generation of AGN feedback. We thus\nenvisage a picture of cool cluster cores going through cycles of\ncooling-induced contraction and AGN-induced expansion. This picture naturally\npredicts an anti-correlation between the gas fraction (or X-ray luminosity) of\ncool cores and the central gas entropy, which may be tested by X-ray\nobservations.\n", "  The frequencies of oscillation modes in stars contain valuable information\nabout the stellar properties. In red giants the frequency spectrum also\ncontains mixed modes, with both pressure (p) and gravity (g) as restoring\nforce, which are key to understanding the physical conditions in the stellar\ncore. We observe a high fraction of red giants in binary systems, for which\ng-dominated mixed modes are not pronounced. This trend leads us to investigate\nwhether this is specific for binary systems or a more general feature. We do so\nby comparing the fraction of stars with only p-dominated mixed modes in\nbinaries and in a larger set of stars from the APOKASC sample. We find only\np-dominated mixed modes in about 50% of red giants in detached eclipsing\nbinaries compared to about 4% in the large sample. This could indicate that\nthis phenomenon is tightly related to binarity and that the binary fraction in\nthe APOKASC sample is about 8%.\n", "  We describe a method for dark matter detection based on the evaporation of\nhelium atoms from a cold surface and their subsequent detection using field\nionization. When a dark matter particle scatters off a nucleus of the target\nmaterial, elementary excitations (phonons or rotons) are produced. Excitations\nwhich have an energy greater than the binding energy of helium to the surface\ncan result in the evaporation of helium atoms. We propose to detect these atoms\nby ionizing them in a strong electric field. Because the binding energy of\nhelium to surfaces can be below 1~meV, this detection scheme opens up new\npossibilities for the detection of dark matter particles in a mass range down\nto 1~MeV/c$^{2}$.\n", "  Optomechanical devices have been cooled to ground-state and genuine quantum\nfeatures, as well as long-predicted nonlinear phenomena, have been observed.\nWhen packing close enough more than one optomechanical unit in the same\nsubstrate the question arises as to whether collective or independent\ndissipation channels are the correct description of the system. Here we explore\nthe effects arising when introducing dissipative couplings between mechanical\ndegrees of freedom. We investigate synchronization, entanglement and cooling,\nfinding that collective dissipation can drive synchronization even in the\nabsence of mechanical direct coupling, and allow to attain larger entanglement\nand optomechanical cooling. The mechanisms responsible for these enhancements\nare explored and provide a full and consistent picture.\n", "  In this article, we study the quantum theory of gravitational boundary modes\non a null surface. These boundary modes are given by a spinor and a\nspinor-valued two-form, which enter the gravitational boundary term for\nself-dual gravity. Using a Fock representation, we quantise the boundary\nfields, and show that the area of a two-dimensional cross section turns into\nthe difference of two number operators. The spectrum is discrete, and it agrees\nwith the one known from loop quantum gravity with the correct dependence on the\nBarbero--Immirzi parameter. No discrete structures (such as spin network\nfunctions, or triangulations of space) are ever required---the entire\nderivation happens at the level of the continuum theory. In addition, the area\nspectrum is manifestly Lorentz invariant.\n", "  P-N junctions in graphene on ferroelectric have been actively studied, but\nthe impact of piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric substrate with\nferroelectric domain walls (FDWs) on graphene characteristics was not\nconsidered. Due to the piezo-effect ferroelectric domain stripes with opposite\nspontaneous polarizations elongate or contract depending on the polarity of\nvoltage applied to the substrate. We show that the alternating piezoelectric\ndisplacement of the ferroelectric domain surfaces can lead to the alternate\nstretching and separation of graphene areas at the steps between elongated and\ncontracted domains. Graphene separation at FDWs induced by piezo-effect can\ncause unusual effects. In particular, the conductance of graphene channel in a\nfield effect transistor increases essentially, because electrons in the\nstretched section scatter on acoustic phonons. At the same time the graphene\nconductance is determined by ferroelectric spontaneous polarization and varies\ngreatly in the presence of FDWs. The revealed piezo-mechanism of graphene\nconductance control is promising for next generations of graphene-based field\neffect transistors, modulators, electrical transducers and piezo-resistive\nelements. Also our results propose the method of suspended graphene fabrication\nbased on piezo-effect in a ferroelectric substrate that does not require any\nadditional technological procedures.\n", "  We analyze the statistics of the shortest and fastest paths on the road\nnetwork between randomly sampled end points. To a good approximation, these\noptimal paths are found to be directed in that their lengths (at large scales)\nare linearly proportional to the absolute distance between them. This motivates\ncomparisons to universal features of directed polymers in random media. There\nare similarities in scalings of fluctuations in length/time and transverse\nwanderings, but also important distinctions in the scaling exponents, likely\ndue to long-range correlations in geographic and man-made features. At short\nscales the optimal paths are not directed due to circuitous excursions governed\nby a fat-tailed (power-law) probability distribution.\n", "  We present preliminary results of our grid based modelling (GBM) of the\ndwarf/subgiant sample of stars observed with Kepler including global\nasteroseismic parameters. GBM analysis in this work is based on a large grid of\nstellar models that is characterized by five independent parameters: model mass\nand age, initial metallicity ($\\zini$), initial helium ($\\yini$), and mixing\nlength parameter ($\\alpha_{mlt}$). Using this grid relaxes assumptions used in\nall previous GBM work where the initial composition is determined by a single\nparameter and that $\\alpha_{mlt}$ is fixed to a solar-calibrated value. The new\ngrid allows us to study, for example, the impact of different galactic chemical\nenrichment models on the determination of stellar parameters such as mass\nradius and age. Also, it allows to include new results from stellar atmosphere\nmodels on $\\alpha_{mlt}$ in the GBM analysis in a simple manner. Alternatively,\nit can be tested if global asteroseismology is a useful tool to constraint our\nignorance on quantities such as $\\yini$ and $\\alpha_{mlt}$. Initial findings\nshow that mass determination is robust with respect to freedom in the latter\nquantities, with a 4.4\\% maximum deviation for extreme assumptions regarding\nprior information on $\\yini-\\zini$ relations and $\\alpha_{mlt}$. On the other\nhand, tests carried out so far seem to indicate that global seismology does not\nhave much power to constrain $\\yini-\\zini$ relations of $\\alpha_{mlt}$ values\nwithout resourcing to additional information.\n", "  An updated and improved version of the effective interaction based on the\nArgonne\\textendash Urbana nuclear Hamiltonian\\textemdash derived using the\nformalism of Correlated Basis Functions (CBF) and the cluster expansion\ntechnique\\textemdash is employed to obtain a number of properties of cold\nnuclear matter at arbitrary neutron excess within the formalism of many-body\nperturbation theory. The numerical results\\textemdash including the\nground-state energy per nucleon, the symmetry energy, the pressure, the\ncompressibility, and the single-particle spectrum\\textemdash are discussed in\nthe context of the available empirical information, obtained from measured\nnuclear properties and heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The possible realization of dissipationless chiral edge current in a\ntopological insulator / magnetic insulator heterostructure is based on the\ncondition that the magnetic proximity exchange coupling at the interface is\ndominated by the Dirac surface states of the topological insulator. Here we\nreport a polarized neutron reflectometry observation of Dirac electrons\nmediated magnetic proximity effect in a bulk-insulating topological insulator\n(Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{0.8}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ / magnetic insulator EuS heterostructure.\nWe are able to maximize the proximity induced magnetism by applying an\nelectrical back gate to tune the Fermi level of topological insulator to be\nclose to the charge neutral point. A phenomenological model based on\ndiamagnetic screening is developed to explain the suppressed proximity induced\nmagnetism at high carrier density. Our work paves the way to utilize the\nmagnetic proximity effect at the topological insulator/magnetic insulator\nhetero-interface for low-power spintronic applications.\n", "  The existence of several 2D materials with heavy atoms in their composition\nhas been recently demonstrated. The electronic and optical properties of these\nmaterials can be accurately computed with numerically intensive density\nfunctional theory methods. However, it is desirable to have simple effective\nmodels that can accurately describe these properties at low energies. Here we\npresent an effective model for stanene that is reliable for electronic and\noptical properties for photon energies up to 1.1 eV. For this material, we find\nthat a quadratic model with respect to the lattice momentum is the best suited\nfor calculations based on the bandstructure, even with respect to band warping.\nWe also find that splitting the two spin-z subsectors is a good approximation,\nwhich indicates that the lattice buckling can be neglected in calculations\nbased on the bandstructure. We illustrate the applicability of the model by\ncomputing the linear optical injection rates of carrier and spin densities in\nstanene. Our calculations indicate that an incident circularly polarized\noptical field only excites electrons with spin that matches its helicity.\n", "  Cold gas-phase water has recently been detected in a cold dark cloud, Barnard\n5 located in the Perseus complex, by targeting methanol peaks as signposts for\nice mantle evaporation. Observed morphology and abundances of methanol and\nwater are consistent with a transient non-thermal evaporation process only\naffecting the outermost ice mantle layers, possibly triggering a more complex\nchemistry. We present the detection of the Complex Organic Molecules (COMs)\nacetaldehyde and methyl formate as well as formic acid and ketene, and the\ntentative detection of di-methyl ether towards the methanol hotspot of Barnard\n5 located between two dense cores using the single dish OSO 20m, IRAM 30m, and\nNRO 45m telescopes. The high energy cis- conformer of formic acid is detected,\nsuggesting that formic acid is mostly formed at the surface of interstellar\ngrains and then evaporated. The detection of multiple transitions for each\nspecies allows us to constrain their abundances through LTE and non-LTE\nmethods. All the considered COMs show similar abundances between $\\sim 1$ and\n$\\sim 10$ % relative to methanol depending on the assumed excitation\ntemperature. The non-detection of glycolaldehyde, an isomer of methyl formate,\nwith a [glycolaldehyde]/[methyl formate] abundance ratio lower than 6 %,\nfavours gas phase formation pathways triggered by methanol evaporation.\nAccording to their excitation temperatures derived in massive hot cores, formic\nacid, ketene, and acetaldehyde have been designated as \"lukewarm\" COMs whereas\nmethyl formate and di-methyl ether were defined as \"warm\" species. Comparison\nwith previous observations of other types of sources confirms that \"lukewarm\"\nand \"warm\" COMs show similar abundances in low-density cold gas whereas the\n\"warm\" COMs tend to be more abundant than the \"lukewarm\" species in warm\nprotostellar cores.\n", "  We present a minimal bottom-up extension of the Chern-Simons bulk action for\nholographic translational symmetry breaking that naturally gives rise to pair\ndensity waves. We construct stationary inhomogeneous black hole solutions in\nwhich both the U(1) symmetry and spatially translational symmetry are\nspontaneously broken at finite temperature and charge density. This novel\nsolution provides a dual description of a superconducting phase intertwined\nwith charge, current and parity orders.\n", "  Higgs factories will be able to measure Higgs properties, and in particular\nHiggs couplings with high precision. In a follow-up to an earlier analysis we\nstudy the impact of the Higgs-strahlung and vector boson fusion processes on\nthe precision of the couplings determination. Provided theoretical\nuncertainties can be controlled, future Higgs factories will be able to measure\nHiggs couplings at the sub-percent level. In spite of their different\nstrengths, base-line circular and linear designs can expect a surprisingly\nsimilar performance.\n", "  The X-ray emitting corona irradiates and ionises the surface of the inner\naccretion disc in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The ionisation parameter of\nthe inner disc at a radius $r$ from the black hole, $\\xi(r)$, can be used to\ninfer information about the location of the corona. Here, a new formula is\nderived that predicts $\\xi(r,h)$ for a disc irradiated by a X-ray source at a\nheight $h$ above the black hole symmetry axis (i.e., a lamppost geometry). The\nequation is independent of the black hole mass and the X-ray spectrum, and\naccounts for the effects of gravitational light-bending on the ionisation state\nand a variable coronal dissipation factor. We predict a strong ionisation\ngradient across the surface of the inner disc that depends on the black hole\nspin and lamppost height. For a fixed $h$, the ionisation parameter is also\nexpected to increase as $\\lambda^3$, where $\\lambda$ is the observed bolometric\nEddington ratio of the AGN. Comparing this formula to the observed\n$\\xi$-$\\lambda$ relationship for Mrk 335 yields $h \\propto \\lambda^{0.5-0.6}$,\nsupporting the view of a dynamic X-ray corona in AGNs.\n", "  We study the chemical evolution of the thick and thin discs of the Galaxy by\ncomparing detailed chemical evolution models with recent data from the AMBRE\nProject. The data suggest that the stars in the thick and thin discs form two\ndistinct sequences with the thick disc stars showing higher [{\\alpha}/Fe]\nratios. We adopt two different approaches to model the evolution of thick and\nthin discs. In particular, we adopt: i) a two-infall approach where the thick\ndisc forms fast and before the thin disc and by means of a fast gas accretion\nepisode, whereas the thin disc forms by means of a second accretion episode on\na longer timescale; ii) a parallel approach, where the two discs form in\nparallel but at different rates. By comparing our model results with the\nobserved [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions in the\ntwo Galactic components, we conclude that the parallel approach can account for\na group of {\\alpha}-enhanced metal rich stars present in the data, whereas the\ntwo-infall approach cannot explain these stars unless they are the result of\nstellar migration. In both approaches, the thick disc has formed on a timescale\nof accretion of 0.1 Gyr, whereas the thin disc formed on a timescale of 7 Gyr\nin the solar region. In the two-infall approach a gap in star formation between\nthe thick and thin disc formation of several hundreds of Myr should be present,\nat variance with the parallel approach where no gap is present.\n", "  We calculate the holographic entanglement entropy for the holographic QCD\nphase diagram considered in [Knaute, Yaresko, K\\\"ampfer (2017),\narXiv:1702.06731] and explore the resulting qualitative behavior over the\ntemperature-chemical potential plane. In agreement with the thermodynamic\nresult, the phase diagram exhibits the same critical point as the onset of a\nfirst-order phase transition curve. We compare the phase diagram of the\nentanglement entropy to that of the thermodynamic entropy density and find a\nstriking agreement in the vicinity of the critical point. Thus, the holographic\nentanglement entropy qualifies to characterize different phase structures. The\nscaling behavior near the critical point is analyzed through the calculation of\ncritical exponents.\n", "  Junctions created by coupling two superconductors via a semiconductor\nnanowire in the presence of high magnetic fields are the basis for detection,\nfusion, and braiding of Majorana bound states. We study NbTiN/InSb\nnanowire/NbTiN Josephson junctions and find that their critical currents in the\nfew mode regime are strongly suppressed by magnetic field. Furthermore, the\ndependence of the critical current on magnetic field exhibits gate-tunable\nnodes. Based on a realistic numerical model we conclude that the Zeeman effect\ninduced by the magnetic field and the spin-orbit interaction in the nanowire\nare insufficient to explain the observed evolution of the Josephson effect. We\nfind the interference between the few occupied one-dimensional modes in the\nnanowire to be the dominant mechanism responsible for the critical current\nbehavior. The suppression and non-monotonic evolution of critical currents at\nfinite magnetic field should be taken into account when designing circuits\nbased on Majorana bound states.\n", "  We study numerically a two-dimensional random-bond Ising model where\nfrustration can be tuned by varying the fraction $a$ of antiferromagnetic\ncoupling constants. At low temperatures the model exhibits a phase with\nferromagnetic order for sufficiently small values of $a$, $a<a_f$. In an\nintermediate range $a_f<a<a_a$ the system is paramagnetic, with spin glass\norder expected right at zero temperature. For even larger values $a>a_a$ an\nantiferromagnetic phase exists. After a deep quench from high temperatures,\nslow evolution is observed for any value of $a$. We show that different amounts\nof frustration, tuned by $a$, affect the dynamical properties in a highly non\ntrivial way. In particular, the kinetics is logarithmically slow in phases with\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic order, whereas evolution is faster, i.e.\nalgebraic, when spin glass order is prevailing. An interpretation is given in\nterms of the different nature of phase space.\n", "  We point out that, when the Unruh-DeWitt detector couples to a scalar primary\noperator of $d$-dimensional conformal field theory, the detector's power\nspectrum generally obeys the thermal distribution for $(1+1)$-dimensional\nanyons.\n", "  We discuss information-theoretic properties of low-energy photons and\ngravitons in the S-matrix. Given an incoming n-particle momentum eigenstate, we\ndemonstrate that unobserved soft photons decohere nearly all outgoing momentum\nsuperpositions of charged particles, while the universality of gravity implies\nthat soft gravitons decohere nearly all outgoing momentum superpositions of all\nthe hard particles. Using this decoherence, we compute the entanglement entropy\nof the soft bosons and show that it is infrared-finite when the leading\ndivergences are re-summed a la Bloch and Nordsieck.\n", "  We numerically simulate gravitational collapse in asymptotically anti-de\nSitter spacetimes away from spherical symmetry. Starting from initial data\nsourced by a massless real scalar field, we solve the Einstein equations with a\nnegative cosmological constant in five spacetime dimensions and obtain a family\nof non-spherically symmetric solutions, including those that form two distinct\nblack holes on the axis. We find that these configurations collapse faster than\nspherically symmetric ones of the same mass and radial compactness. Similarly,\nthey require less mass to collapse within a fixed time.\n", "  A reinforcement algorithm solves a classical optimization problem by\nintroducing a feedback to the system which slowly changes the energy landscape\nand converges the algorithm to an optimal solution in the configuration space.\nHere, we use this strategy to concentrate (localize) preferentially the wave\nfunction of a quantum particle, which explores the configuration space of the\nproblem, on an optimal configuration. We examine the method by solving\nnumerically the equations governing the evolution of the system, which are\nsimilar to the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, for small problem sizes. In\nparticular, we observe that reinforcement increases the minimal energy gap of\nthe system in a quantum annealing algorithm. Our numerical simulations and the\nlatter observation show that such kind of quantum feedbacks might be helpful in\nsolving a computationally hard optimization problem by a quantum reinforcement\nalgorithm.\n", "  Recently, the LHCb collaboration has reported the excesses in the $b \\to s\nll$ processes. One of the promising candidates for new physics to explain the\nanomalies is the extended Standard Model (SM) with vector-like quarks and\nleptons. In that model, Yukawa couplings between the extra fermions and SM\nfermions are introduced, adding extra scalars. Then, the box diagrams involving\nthe extra fields achieve the $b \\to s ll$ anomalies. It has been known that the\nexcesses require the large Yukawa couplings of leptons, so that this kind of\nmodel can be tested by studying correlations with other observables. In this\npaper, we consider the extra scalar to be a dark matter (DM) candidate, and\ninvestigate DM physics as well as the flavor physics and the LHC physics. The\nDM relic density and the direct-detection cross section are also dominantly\ngiven by the Yukawa couplings, so that we find some explicit correlations\nbetween DM physics and the flavor physics. In particular, we find the\npredictions of the $b \\to s ll$ anomalies against the direct detection of DM.\n", "  Chirality, ubiquitous in complex biological systems, can be controlled and\nquantified in synthetic materials such as cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC)\nsystems. In this work, we study spherical shells of CLC under weak anchoring\nconditions. We induce anchoring transitions at the inner and outer boundaries\nusing two independent methods: by changing the surfactant concentration or by\nraising the temperature close to the clearing point. The shell confinement\nleads to new states and associated surface structures: a state where large\nstripes on the shell can be filled with smaller, perpendicular sub-stripes, and\na focal conic domain (FCD) state, where thin stripes wrap into at least two,\ntopologically required, double spirals. Focusing on the latter state, we use a\nLandau-de Gennes model of the CLC to simulate its detailed configurations as a\nfunction of anchoring strength. By abruptly changing the topological\nconstraints on the shell, we are able to study the interconversion between\ndirector defects and pitch defects, a phenomenon usually restricted by the\ncomplexity of the cholesteric phase. This work extends the knowledge of\ncholesteric patterns, structures that not only have potential for use as\nintricate, self-assembly blueprints but are pervasive in biological systems.\n", "  The number of measurements required to reconstruct the states of quantum\nsystems increases exponentially with the quantum system dimensions, which makes\nthe state reconstruction of high-qubit quantum systems have a great challenge\nin physical quantum computing experiments. Compressive sensing (CS) has been\nverified as a effective technique in the reconstruction of quantum state,\nhowever, it is still unknown that if CS can reconstruct quantum states given\nthe less data measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In this paper, we\npropose an effective NMR quantum state reconstruction method based on CS.\nDifferent from the conventional CS-based quantum state reconstruction, our\nmethod uses the actual observation data from NMR experiments rather than the\ndata measured by the Pauli operators. We implement measurements on quantum\nstates in practical NMR computing experiments and reconstruct states of 2,3,4\nqubits using fewer number of measurements, respectively. The proposed method is\neasy to implement and performs more efficiently with the increase of the system\ndimension size. The performance reveals both efficiency and accuracy, which\nprovides an alternative for the quantum state reconstruction in practical NMR.\n", "  Ferroelectricity has been believed unable to coexist with metallicity since\nthe free carriers can screen the internal coulomb interactions of dipoles. Very\nrecently, one kind of materials called as ferroelectric metal was reexamined.\nHere, we report the coexistence of metallicity and polar distortion in a new\ncandidate for ferroelectric metal PbTi1-xNbxO3 via doping engineering. The\nferroelectric-like polar distortion in all the doped PbTi1-xNbxO3, with x\nranging from 0.04 to 0.12, was confirmed by the piezoresponse force microscopy\nand the scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. PbTi1-xNbxO3\nfilms become more conductive with more doping density, and emerge a metallic\nbehavior when x reaches 0.12. Our first principle calculations further revealed\nthat the doped Nb ions in the films can only provide free electrons, but not be\nable to damage the dipoles in unite cells even with the heaviest doping density\nof 0.12 due to their little impact on the off-centering of the Ti ions. We\nbelieve that these results confirm a feasibility of realizing the coexistence\nof metallicity and polar distortion for other ferroelectrics in a common way,\nand motivate the synthesis of some new materials with artificially designed\nproperties even incompatible in nature.\n", "  We analytically study the spontaneous emission of a single optical dipole\nemitter in the vicinity of a plasmonic nanoshell, based on the Lorenz-Mie\ntheory. We show that the fluorescence enhancement due to the coupling between\noptical emitter and sphere can be tuned by the aspect ratio of the core-shell\nnanosphere and by the distance between the quantum emitter and its surface. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that both the enhancement and quenching of the\nfluorescence intensity are associated with plasmonic Fano resonances induced by\nnear- and far-field interactions. These Fano resonances have asymmetry\nparameters whose signs depend on the orientation of the dipole with respect to\nthe spherical nanoshell. We also show that if the atomic dipole is oriented\ntangentially to the nanoshell, the interaction exhibits saddle points in the\nnear-field energy flow. This results in a Lorentzian fluorescence enhancement\nresponse in the near field and a Fano line-shape in the far field. The\nsignatures of this interaction may have interesting applications for sensing\nthe presence and the orientation of optical emitters in close proximity to\nplasmonic nanoshells.\n", "  We report a comprehensive study of cosmogenic activation of germanium used\nfor tonne-scale rare event search experiments. The germanium exposure to cosmic\nrays on the Earth's surface are simulated with and without a shielding\ncontainer using Geant4 for a given cosmic muon, neutron, and proton energy\nspectrum. The production rates of various radioactive isotopes are obtained for\ndifferent sources separately. We find that fast neutron induced interactions\ndominate the production rate of cosmogenic activation. Geant4-based simulation\nresults are compared with the calculation of ACTIVIA and the available\nexperimental data. A reasonable agreement between Geant4 simulations and\nseveral experimental data sets is presented. We predict that cosmogenic\nactivation of germanium can set limits to the sensitivity of the next\ngeneration of tonne-scale experiments.\n", "  Symmetries are essential for a consistent formulation of many quantum\nsystems. In this paper we discuss a previously unnoticed symmetry, which is\npresent for any Lagrangian term that involves $\\dot{x}^2$. As a basic model\nthat incorporates the fundamental symmetries of quantum gravity and string\ntheory, we consider the Lagrangian action of the relativistic point particle. A\npath integral quantization for this seemingly simple system has for long\npresented notorious problems. Here we show that those problems are overcome by\ntaking into account the newly discovered additional symmetry, leading directly\nto the exact Klein-Gordon propagator.\n", "  We carry out simulated annealing and employ a generalized Kibble-Zurek\nscaling hypothesis to study the 2D Ising spin glass with normal-distributed\ncouplings. The system has an equilibrium glass transition at temperature $T=0$.\nFrom a scaling analysis when $T\\rightarrow 0$ at different annealing\nvelocities, we extract the dynamic critical exponent $z$, i.e., the exponent\nrelating the relaxation time $\\tau$ to the system length $L$; $\\tau\\sim L^z$.\nWe find $z=13.6 \\pm 0.4$ for both the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass order\nparameter and the excess energy. This is different from a previous study of the\nsystem with bimodal couplings [S. J. Rubin, N. Xu, and A. W. Sandvik, Phys.\nRev. E {\\bf 95}, 052133 (2017)] where the dynamics is faster and the above two\nquantities relax with different exponents (and that of the energy is larger).\nWe here argue that the different behaviors arise as a consequence of the\ndifferent low-energy landscapes---for normal-distributed couplings the ground\nstate is unique (up to a spin reflection) while the system with bimodal\ncouplings is massively degenerate. Our results reinforce the conclusion of\nanomalous entropy-driven relaxation behavior in the bimodal Ising glass. In the\ncase of a continuous coupling distribution, our results presented here indicate\nthat, although Kibble-Zurek scaling holds, the perturbative behavior normally\napplying in the slow limit breaks down, likely due to quasi-degenerate states,\nand the scaling function takes a different form.\n", "  Scattering is an elementary probe for matter and its interactions in all\nareas of physics. Ultracold atomic gases provide a powerful platform in which\ncontrol over pair-wise interactions empowers us to investigate scattering in\nquantum many-body systems. Past experiments on colliding Bose-Einstein\ncondensates have revealed many important features, including matter-wave\ninterference, halos of scattered atoms, four-wave mixing, and correlations\nbetween counter-propagating pairs. However, a regime with strong stimulation of\nspontaneous collisions analogous to superradiance has proven elusive. Here we\naccess that regime, finding that runaway stimulated collisions in condensates\nwith modulated interaction strength cause the emission of matter-wave jets\nwhich resemble fireworks. Jets appear only above a threshold modulation\namplitude and their correlations are invariant even as the ejected atom number\ngrows exponentially. Hence, we show that the structures and occupations of the\njets stem from the quantum fluctuations of the condensate. Our findings\ndemonstrate the conditions for runaway stimulated collisions and reveal the\nquantum nature of the matter-wave emission.\n", "  Progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts are thought to be neutron stars\ncoalescing with their companion black hole or neutron star, which are one of\nthe main gravitational wave sources. We have devised a Bayesian framework for\ncombining gamma-ray burst and gravitational wave information that allows us to\nprobe short gamma-ray burst luminosities. We show that combined short gamma-ray\nburst and gravitational wave observations not only improve progenitor distance\nand inclination angle estimates, they also allow the isotropic luminosities of\nshort gamma-ray bursts to be determined without the need for host galaxy or\nlight-curve information. We characterise our approach by simulating 1000 joint\nshort gamma-ray burst and gravitational wave detections by Advanced LIGO and\nAdvanced Virgo. We show that ${\\sim}90\\%$ of the simulations have uncertainties\non short gamma-ray burst isotropic luminosity estimates that are within a\nfactor of 2 of the ideal scenario, where the distance is known exactly.\nTherefore, isotropic luminosities can be confidently determined for short\ngamma-ray bursts observed jointly with gravitational wave detected by Advanced\nLIGO and Advanced Virgo. Planned enhancements to Advanced LIGO will extend its\nrange and likely produce several joint detections of short gamma-ray bursts and\ngravitational waves. Third-generation gravitational wave detectors will allow\nfor isotropic luminosity estimates for the majority of the short gamma-ray\nburst population within a redshift of $z{\\sim}1$.\n", "  Precision measurements of frequency are critical to accurate timekeeping, and\nare fundamentally limited by quantum measurement uncertainties. While for\ntime-independent quantum Hamiltonians, the uncertainty of any parameter scales\nat best as $1/T$, where $T$ is the duration of the experiment, recent\ntheoretical works have predicted that explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonians\ncan yield a $1/T^2$ scaling of the uncertainty for an oscillation frequency.\nThis quantum acceleration in precision requires coherent control, which is\ngenerally adaptive. We experimentally realize this quantum improvement in\nfrequency sensitivity with superconducting circuits, using a single transmon\nqubit. With optimal control pulses, the theoretically ideal frequency precision\nscaling is reached for times shorter than the decoherence time. This result\ndemonstrates a fundamental quantum advantage for frequency estimation.\n", "  Colorelectric and Colormagnetic structure of the flux tubes, connecting heavy\nquark and antiquark, is investigated in the framework of the Field Correlator\nmethod which describes all resulting fields in terms of correlators $D^E$ and\n$D^E_1$. The latter have been computed via gluelumps, which allows to predict\nthe resulting distribution of color fields $\\mathbf{E} (\\mathbf{r}),$ and\ncolormagnetic currents $\\mathbf{k} (\\mathbf{r})$ in the flux tubes. It is\nshown, that at large distances $r\\gg \\lambda \\approx 0.2$ fm the whole\nstructure of fields and relations between them is similar to that of the dual\nsuperconductor theory, but the basic dynamics, including small distances, is\ngiven by field correlators of the real stochastic vacuum. The important\ncontradiction between the strong screening of color fields in the width of flux\ntubes and almost no screening in the perturbative $Q\\bar Q$ potential is\nresolved.\n", "  We compute perturbative corrections to matching coefficients of QCD to HQET\nfor the matrix element of the $\\Delta B=2$ operator that determines the mass\ndifference in $B^0-\\bar{B}^0$ system of states. This involves the technical\npoint of choosing the operator basis in HQET, separating physical operators\nfrom evanescent ones. We obtain an analytical result for some of the two-loop\ncorrections at order $\\alpha_s^2$.\n", "  Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent the majority of the AGN\npopulation. However, due to the difficulties in measuring their black hole (BH)\nmasses, it is still unknown whether they follow the same BH mass-host galaxy\nscaling relations valid for quiescent galaxies and type 1 AGN. Here we present\nthe locus of type 2 AGN having virial BH mass estimates in the\n$M_{BH}-\\sigma_\\star$ plane. Our analysis shows that the BH masses of type 2\nAGN are $\\sim0.9$ dex smaller than type 1 AGN at $\\sigma_\\star\\sim 185$ km\ns$^{-1}$, regardless of the (early/late) AGN host galaxy morphology.\nEquivalently, type 2 AGN host galaxies have stellar velocity dispersions $\\sim\n0.2$ dex higher than type 1 AGN hosts at $M_{BH}\\sim10^7$ M$_\\odot$.\n", "  The \"faster is slower\" effect raises when crowded people push each other to\nescape through an exit during an emergency situation. As individuals push\nharder, a statistical slowing down in the evacuation time can be achieved. The\nslowing down is caused by the presence of small groups of pedestrians (say, a\nsmall human cluster) that temporary blocks the way out when trying to leave the\nroom. The pressure on the pedestrians belonging to this blocking cluster raises\nfor increasing anxiety levels and/or larger number of individuals trying to\nleave the room through the same door. Our investigation shows, however, that\nvery high pressures alters the dynamics in the blocking cluster, and thus,\nchanges the statistics of the time delays along the escaping process. It can be\nacknowledged a reduction in the long lasting delays, while the overall\nevacuation performance improves. We present results on this novel phenomenon\ntaking place beyond the \"faster is slower\" regime.\n", "  The electronic properties of the heavy metal superconductor LaIr3 are\nreported. The estimated superconducting parameters obtained from physical\nproperties measurements indicate that LaIr3 is a BCS-type superconductor.\nElectronic band structure calculations show that Ir d- states dominate the\nFermi level. A comparison of electronic band structures of LaIr3 and LaRh3\nshows that the Ir-compound has a strong spin-orbit-coupling effect, which\ncreates a complex Fermi surface.\n", "  A combination of novel technological and fundamental physics prospects has\nsparked a huge interest in pure spin transport in magnets, starting with\nferromagnets and spreading to antiferro- and ferrimagnets. We present a\ntheoretical study of spin transport across a ferrimagnet$|$non-magnetic\nconductor interface, when a magnetic eigenmode is driven into a coherent state.\nThe obtained spin current expression includes intra- as well as\ncross-sublattice terms, both of which are essential for a quantitative\nunderstanding of spin-pumping. The dc current is found to be sensitive to the\nasymmetry in interfacial coupling between the two sublattice magnetizations and\nthe mobile electrons, especially for antiferromagnets. We further find that the\nconcomitant shot noise provides a useful tool for probing the quasiparticle\nspin and interfacial coupling.\n", "  We investigate a system of two- and three-body constrained dipolar bosons in\na pair of one-dimensional optical lattices coupled to each other by the\nnon-local dipole-dipole interactions. Assuming attractive dipole-dipole\ninteractions, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the system by\nemploying the cluster mean-field theory. The competition between the repulsive\non-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions between the chains yields\nthree kinds of superfluids; namely the trimer superfluid, pair superfluid and\nthe usual single particle superfluid along with the insulating Mott phase at\nthe commensurate density. Besides, we also realize simultaneous existence of\nMott insulator and superfluid phases for the two- and three-body constrained\nbosons, respectively. We also analyze the stability of these quantum phases in\nthe presence of a harmonic trap potential.\n", "  The radial number density and flattening of the Milky Way's stellar halo is\nmeasured with $\\mathrm{5351}$ metal-poor ([Fe/H]$<-1$) K giants from LAMOST\nDR3, using a nonparametric method which is model independent and largely avoids\nthe influence of halo substucture. The number density profile is well described\nby a single power law with index $5.03^{+0.64}_{-0.64}$, and flattening that\nvaries with radius. The stellar halo traced by LAMOST K giants is more\nflattened at smaller radii, and becomes nearly spherical at larger radii. The\nflattening, $q$, is about 0.64, 0.8, 0.96 at $r=15$, 20 and 30 kpc (where\n$r=\\sqrt{R^2+\\left[Z/q\\left(r\\right)\\right]^2}$), respectively. Moreover, the\nleading arm of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream in the north, and the\ntrailing arm in the south, are significant in the residual map of density\ndistribution. In addition, an unknown overdensity is identified in the residual\nmap at (R,Z)=(30,15) kpc.\n", "  The production of ground-state and excited bottomonia in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions is investigated within a kinetic-rate equation approach\nincluding regeneration. We augment our previous calculations by an improved\ntreatment of medium effects, with temperature-dependent binding energies and\npertinent reaction rates, $B$-meson resonance states in the equilibrium limit\nnear the hadronization temperature, and a lattice-QCD based equation of state\nfor the bulk medium. In addition to the centrality dependence of the\nbottomonium yields we compute their transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra and\nelliptic flow with momentum-dependent reaction rates and a regeneration\ncomponent based on $b$-quark spectra from a nonperturbative transport model of\nheavy-quark diffusion. The latter has noticeable consequences for the shape of\nthe bottomonium $p_T$ spectra. We quantify how uncertainties in the various\nmodeling components affect the predictions for observables. Based on this we\nargue that the $\\Upsilon(1S)$ suppression is a promising observable for mapping\nout the in-medium properties of the QCD force, while $\\Upsilon(2S)$ production\ncan help to quantify the role of regeneration from partially thermalized $b$\nquarks.\n", "  The standard theory of weak gravitational lensing relies on the infinitesimal\nlight beam approximation. In this context, images are distorted by convergence\nand shear, the respective sources of which unphysically depend on the\nresolution of the distribution of matter---the so-called Ricci-Weyl problem. In\nthis letter, we propose a strong-lensing-inspired formalism to describe the\nlensing of finite beams. We address the Ricci-Weyl problem by showing\nexplicitly that convergence is caused by the matter enclosed by the beam,\nregardless of its distribution. Furthermore, shear turns out to be\nsystematically enhanced by the finiteness of the beam. This implies, in\nparticular, that the Kaiser-Squires relation between shear and convergence is\nviolated, which could have profound consequences on the interpretation of weak\nlensing surveys.\n", "  We demonstrate low-loss measurement of the hyperfine ground state of Rubidium\natoms in a dipole trap array of five sites by state dependent fluorescence\ndetection. The presence of atoms and their internal states are minimally\naltered by utilizing circularly polarized probe light and a strictly controlled\nquantization axis. We achieve mean state detection fidelity of \\(97\\%\\) without\ncorrecting for imperfect state preparation or background losses, and \\(98.7\\%\\)\nwhen corrected. After state detection and correction for background losses, the\nprobability of atom loss due to the state measurement is \\(<2\\%\\) and the\ninitial hyperfine state is preserved with \\(>98\\%\\) probability.\n", "  We analyze light vector and scalar meson mass spectra using a novel approach\nwhere a modified soft wall model with a UV-cutoff is considered. Including this\ncutoff introduces an extra energy scale. For this model, we found that the\nmasses for the scalar and vector spectra are well fitted within a very small\nRMS error for 14 of these states, with non-linear trajectories given by two\ncommon parameters, the UV locus $z_0$ and the quadratic dilaton profile slope\n$\\kappa$. We concluded that in this model the $f_{0}(500)$ scalar resonance\ncannot be fitted holographycally as a $q\\overline{q}$ state since we could not\nfind a trajectory that included this pole. This result is in agreement with the\nmost recent phenomenological and theoretical methods.\n", "  We study the interplay between dephasing, disorder, and openness on transport\nefficiency in a one-dimensional chain of finite length $N$, and in particular\nthe beneficial or detrimental effect of dephasing on transport. The excitation\nmoves along the chain by coherent nearest-neighbor hopping $\\Omega$, under the\naction of static disorder $W$ and dephasing $\\gamma$. The system is open due to\nthe coupling of the last site with an external acceptor system (sink), where\nthe excitation can be trapped with a rate $\\Gamma_{\\rm trap}$, which determines\nthe opening strength. While it is known that dephasing can help transport in\nthe localized regime, here we show that dephasing can enhance energy transfer\neven in the ballistic regime. Specifically, in the localized regime we recover\nprevious results, where the optimal dephasing is independent of the chain\nlength and proportional to $W$ or $W^2/\\Omega$. In the ballistic regime, the\noptimal dephasing decreases as $1/N$ or $1/\\sqrt{N}$ respectively for weak and\nmoderate static disorder. When focusing on the excitation starting at the\nbeginning of the chain, dephasing can help excitation transfer only above a\ncritical value of disorder $W^{\\rm cr}$, which strongly depends on the opening\nstrength $\\Gamma_{\\rm trap}$. Analytic solutions are obtained for short chains.\n", "  We study the evolution of the concentration field in a single eddy in the 2D\nCahn-Hilliard system to better understand scalar mixing processes in that\nsystem. This study extends investigations of the classic studies of flux\nexpulsion in 2D MHD and homogenization of potential vorticity in 2D fluids.\nSimulation results show that there are three stages in the evolution: (A)\nformation of a jelly roll pattern, for which the concentration field is\nconstant along spirals; (B) a change in isoconcentration contour topology; and\n(C) formation of a target pattern, for which the isoconcentration contours\nfollow concentric annuli. In the final target pattern stage, the\nisoconcentration bands align with stream lines. The results indicate that the\ntarget pattern is a metastable state. Band merger process continues on a time\nscale exponentially long relative to the eddy turnover time. The band merger\nprocess resembles step merger in drift-ZF staircases; this is characteristic of\nthe long-time evolution of phase separated patterns described by the\nCahn-Hilliard equation.\n", "  Precision measurements of free neutron $\\beta$-decay have been used to\nprecisely constrain our understanding of the weak interaction. However the\nneutron Fierz interference term $b_n$, which is particularly sensitive to\nBeyond-Standard-Model tensor currents at the TeV scale, has thus far eluded\nmeasurement. Here we report the first direct constraints on this term, finding\n$b_n = 0.067 \\pm 0.005_{\\text{stat}} {}^{+0.090}_{- 0.061}{}_{\\text{sys}}$,\nconsistent with the Standard Model. The uncertainty is dominated by absolute\nenergy reconstruction and the linearity of the beta spectrometer energy\nresponse.\n", "  The study of stellar-remnant black holes (BH) in dense stellar clusters is\nnow in the spotlight, especially due to their intrinsic ability to form binary\nblack holes (BBH) through dynamical encounters, that potentially coalesce via\ngravitational-wave (GW) radiation. In this work, which is a continuation of a\nrecent study (Paper I), additional models of compact stellar clusters with\ninitial masses $\\lesssim10^5M_\\odot$ and also those with small fractions of\nprimordial binaries ($\\lesssim10$%) are evolved for long term, applying the\ndirect N-body approach, assuming state-of-the-art stellar-wind and\nremnant-formation prescriptions. That way, a substantially broader range of\ncomputed models than that in Paper I is achieved. As in Paper I, the\ngeneral-relativistic BBH mergers continue to be mostly mediated by triples that\nare bound to the clusters rather than happen among the ejected BBHs. In fact,\nthe number of such in situ BBH mergers, per cluster, tend to increase\nsignificantly with the introduction of a small population of primordial\nbinaries. Despite the presence of massive primordial binaries, the merging\nBBHs, especially the in situ ones, are found to be exclusively dynamically\nassembled and hence would be spin-orbit misaligned. The BBHs typically traverse\nthrough both the LISA's and the LIGO's detection bands, being audible to both\ninstruments. The \"dynamical heating\" of the BHs keeps the\nElectron-Capture-Supernova (ECS) neutron stars (NS) from effectively mass\nsegregating and participating in exchange interactions; the dynamically-active\nBHs would also exchange into any NS binary within $\\lesssim1$ Gyr. Such young\nmassive and open clusters have the potential to contribute to the dynamical BBH\nmerger detection rate to a similar extent as their more massive\nglobular-cluster counterparts.\n", "  We show how the interference between superfluid spin currents can endow spin\ncircuits with coherent logic functionality. While the hydrodynamic aspects of\nthe linear-response collective spin transport obviate interference features, we\nfocus on the nonlinear regime, where the critical supercurrent is sensitive to\nthe phase accumulated by the condensate in a loop geometry. We propose to\ncontrol this phase by electrical gating, tuning the spin-condensate coherence\nlength. The nonlinear aspects of the spin superfluidity thus naturally lend\nthemselves to the construction of logic gates, uniquely exploiting the\ncoherence of collective spin currents. Vice versa, this functionality can be\nused to reveal the fundamental properties of spin superfluids.\n", "  In the first paper we presented 27 hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of\ngalaxies with total masses between $5 \\times 10^8$ and\n$10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. In this second paper we use a subset of these\ncosmological simulations as initial conditions (ICs) for more than forty\nhydrodynamical simulations of satellite and host galaxy interaction. Our\ncosmological ICs seem to suggest that galaxies on these mass scales have very\nlittle rotational support and are velocity dispersion ($\\sigma$) dominated.\nAccretion and environmental effects increase the scatter in the galaxy scaling\nrelations (e.g. size - velocity dispersion) in very good agreement with\nobservations. Star formation is substantially quenched after accretion. Mass\nremoval due to tidal forces has several effects: it creates a very flat stellar\nvelocity dispersion profiles, and it reduces the dark matter content at all\nscales (even in the centre), which in turn lowers the stellar velocity on\nscales around 0.5 kpc even when the galaxy does not lose stellar mass.\nSatellites that start with a cored dark matter profile are more prone to either\nbe destroyed or to end up in a very dark matter poor galaxy. Finally, we found\nthat tidal effects always increase the \"cuspyness\" of the dark matter profile,\neven for haloes that infall with a core.\n", "  The family of solutions to the Dirac equation for an electron moving in an\nelectromagnetic lattice with the chiral structure created by counterpropagating\ncircularly polarized plane electromagnetic waves is obtained. At any nonzero\nquasimomentum, the dispersion equation has two solutions which specify bispinor\nwave functions describing electron states with different energies and mean\nvalues of momentum and spin operators. The inversion of the quasimomentum\nresults in two other linearly independent solutions. These four basic wave\nfunctions are uniquely defined by eight complex scalar functions (structural\nfunctions), which serve as convenient building blocks of the relations\ndescribing the electron properties. These properties are illustrated in\ngraphical form over a wide range of quasimomentums. The superpositions of two\nbasic wave functions describing different spin states and corresponding to (i)\nthe same quasimomentum (unidirectional electron states with the spin\nprecession) and (ii) the two equal-in-magnitude but oppositely directed\nquasimomentums (bidirectional electron states) are also treated.\n", "  The spin transport in isotropic Heisenberg model in the sector with zero\nmagnetization is generically super-diffusive. Despite that, we here demonstrate\nthat for a specific set of domain-wall-like initial product states it can\ninstead be diffusive. We theoretically explain the time evolution of such\nstates by showing that in the limiting regime of weak spatial modulation they\nare approximately product states for very long times, and demonstrate that even\nin the case of larger spatial modulation the bipartite entanglement entropy\ngrows only logarithmically in time. In the limiting regime we derive a simple\nclosed equation governing the dynamics, which in the continuum limit and for\nthe initial step magnetization profile results in a solution expressed in terms\nof Fresnel integrals.\n", "  Higgsplosion is a dynamical mechanism that introduces an exponential\nsuppression of quantum fluctuations beyond the Higgsplosion energy scale E_*\nand further guarantees perturbative unitarity in multi-Higgs production\nprocesses. By calculating the Higgsplosion scale for spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2\nparticles at leading order, we argue that Higgsplosion regulates all n-point\nfunctions, thereby embedding the Standard Model of particle physics and its\nextensions into an asymptotically safe theory. There are no Landau poles and\nthe Higgs self-coupling stays positive. Asymptotic safety is of particular\ninterest for theories of particle physics that include quantum gravity. We\nargue that in a Hippsloding theory one cannot probe shorter and shorter length\nscales by increasing the energy of the collision beyond the Higgsplosion energy\nand there is a minimal length set by r_* ~ 1/E_* that can be probed. We further\nshow that Higgsplosion in consistent and not in conflict with models of\ninflation and the existence of axions. There is also a possibility of testing\nHiggsplosion experimentally at future high energy experiments.\n", "  The weak interaction does not conserve parity and therefore induces energy\nshifts in chiral enantiomers that should in principle be detectable in\nmolecular spectra. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the expected shifts are\nsmall and in spectra of a mixture of enantiomers, the energy shifts are not\nresolvable. We propose a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment in which\nwe titrate the chirality (enantiomeric excess) of a solvent and measure the\ndiasteriomeric splitting in the spectra of a chiral solute in order to search\nfor an anomalous offset due to parity nonconservation (PNC). We present a\nproof-of-principle experiment in which we search for PNC in the\n\\textsuperscript{13}C resonances of small molecules, and use the\n\\textsuperscript{1}H resonances, which are insensitive to PNC, as an internal\nreference. We set a new constraint on molecular PNC in \\textsuperscript{13}C\nchemical shifts at a level of $10^{-5}$\\,ppm, and provide a discussion of\nimportant considerations in the search for molecular PNC using NMR\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Gaussian states are the backbone of quantum information protocols with\ncontinuous variable systems, whose power relies fundamentally on the\nentanglement between the different modes. In the case of global pure states,\nknowledge of the reduced states in a given bipartition of a multipartite\nquantum system bears information on the entanglement in such bipartition. For\nGaussian states, the reduced states are also Gaussian, so there determination\nrequires essentially the experimental determination of their covariance matrix.\nHere, we develop strategies to determine the covariance matrix of an arbitrary\nn-mode bosonic Gaussian state through measurement of the total phase acquired\nwhen appropriate metaplectic evolutions, associated with quadratic\nHamiltonians, are applied. Simply one-mode metaplectic evolutions, such\nrotations, squeezing and shear transformations, in addition to a single\ntwo-mode rotation, allows to determine all the covariance matrix elements of a\nn-mode bosonic system. All the single-mode metaplectic evolutions are applied\nconditionally to a state in which an ancilla qubit is entangled with the n-mode\nsystem. The ancillary system provides, after measurement, the value of the\ntotal phase of each evolution. The proposed method is experimentally friendly\nto be implemented in the most currently used continuous variable systems.\n", "  We numerically explore the long-time expansion of a one-dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate in a disorder potential employing the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. The goal is to search for unique signatures of Anderson localization\nin the presence of particle-particle interactions. Using typical experimental\nparameters we show that the time scale for which the non-equilibrium dynamics\nof the interacting system begins to diverge from the non-interacting system\nexceeds the observation times up to now accessible in the experiment. We find\nevidence that the long-time evolution of the wavepacket is characterized by\n(sub)diffusive spreading and a growing effective localization length suggesting\nthat interactions destroy Anderson localization.\n", "  Temporal networks have been increasingly used to model a diversity of systems\nthat evolve in time; for example human contact structures over which dynamic\nprocesses such as epidemics take place. A fundamental aspect of real-life\nnetworks is that they are sampled within temporal and spatial frames.\nFurthermore, one might wish to subsample networks to reduce their size for\nbetter visualization or to perform computationally intensive simulations. The\nsampling method may affect the network structure and thus caution is necessary\nto generalize results based on samples. In this paper, we study four sampling\nstrategies applied to a variety of real-life temporal networks. We quantify the\nbiases generated by each sampling strategy on a number of relevant statistics\nsuch as link activity, temporal paths and epidemic spread. We find that some\nbiases are common in a variety of networks and statistics, but one strategy,\nuniform sampling of nodes, shows improved performance in most scenarios. Our\nresults help researchers to better design network data collection protocols and\nto understand the limitations of sampled temporal network data.\n", "  Non-Gaussian operations are essential to exploit the quantum advantages in\noptical continuous variable quantum information protocols. We focus on\nmode-selective photon addition and subtraction as experimentally promising\nprocesses to create multimode non-Gaussian states. Our approach is based on\ncorrelation functions, as is common in quantum statistical mechanics and\ncondensed matter physics, mixed with quantum optics tools. We formulate an\nanalytical expression of the Wigner function after subtraction or addition of a\nsingle photon, for arbitrarily many modes. It is used to demonstrate\nentanglement properties specific to non-Gaussian states, and also leads to a\npractical and elegant condition for Wigner function negativity. Finally, we\nanalyse the potential of photon addition and subtraction for an experimentally\ngenerated multimode Gaussian state.\n", "  In hierarchical searches for continuous gravitational waves, clustering of\ncandidates is an important postprocessing step because it reduces the number of\nnoise candidates that are followed-up at successive stages [1][7][12]. Previous\nclustering procedures bundled together nearby candidates ascribing them to the\nsame root cause (be it a signal or a disturbance), based on a predefined\ncluster volume. In this paper, we present a procedure that adapts the cluster\nvolume to the data itself and checks for consistency of such volume with what\nis expected from a signal. This significantly improves the noise rejection\ncapabilities at fixed detection threshold, and at fixed computing resources for\nthe follow-up stages, this results in an overall more sensitive search. This\nnew procedure was employed in the first Einstein@Home search on data from the\nfirst science run of the advanced LIGO detectors (O1) [11].\n", "  We investigate the internal structure and the mass-radius relation of neutron\nstars in a recently proposed scalar-tensor theory dubbed asymmetron in which a\nmassive scalar field undergoes spontaneous scalarization inside neutron stars.\nWe focus on the case where the Compton wavelength is shorter than 10 km, which\nhas not been investigated in the literature. By solving the modified Einstein\nequations, either purely numerically or by partially using a semianalytic\nmethod, we find that not only the weakening of gravity by spontaneous\nscalarization but also the scalar force affect the internal structure\nsignificantly in the massive case. We also find that the maximum mass of\nneutron stars is larger for certain parameter sets than that in general\nrelativity and reaches 2 solar mass even if the effect of strange hadrons is\ntaken into account. There is even a range of parameters where the maximum mass\nof neutron stars largely exceeds the threshold that violates the causality\nbound in general relativity.\n", "  We present a stochastic projection formalism for the description of quantum\ndynamics in Bosonic or spin environments. The Schr\\\"odinger equation in\ncoherent state representation with respect to the environmental degrees of\nfreedom can be reformulated by employing the Feshbach partitioning technique\nfor open quantum systems based on the introduction of suitable non-Hermitian\nprojection operators. In this picture the reduced state of the system can be\nobtained as a stochastic average over pure state trajectories. The\ncorresponding non-Markovian stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equations include a memory\nintegral over the past states. In the case of harmonic environments and linear\ncoupling the approach gives a new form of the established non-Markovian quantum\nstate diffusion (NMQSD) stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equation without functional\nderivatives. Utilizing spin coherent states, the evolution equation for spin\nenvironments resembles the Bosonic case with, however, a non-Gaussian average\nfor the reduced density operator.\n", "  We report the measurement of the beam-vector and tensor asymmetries\n$A^V_{ed}$ and $A^T_d$ in quasielastic $(\\vec{e}, e^{\\prime}p)$\nelectrodisintegration of the deuteron at the MIT-Bates Linear Accelerator\nCenter up to missing momentum of 500~MeV/c. Data were collected simultaneously\nover a momentum transfer range $0.1< Q^2<0.5$~(GeV/c)$^2$ with the Bates Large\nAcceptance Spectrometer Toroid using an internal deuterium gas target,\npolarized sequentially in both vector and tensor states. The data are compared\nwith calculations. The beam-vector asymmetry $A^V_{ed}$ is found to be directly\nsensitive to the $D$-wave component of the deuteron and have a zero-crossing at\na missing momentum of about 320~MeV/c, as predicted. The tensor asymmetry\n$A^T_d$ at large missing momentum is found to be dominated by the influence of\nthe tensor force in the neutron-proton final-state interaction. The new data\nprovide a strong constraint on theoretical models.\n", "  We investigate the critical dynamics of spin superflow in an easy-plane\nantiferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate. Spin-dipole oscillations are\ninduced in a trapped condensate by applying a linear magnetic field gradient\nand we observe that the damping rate increases rapidly as the field gradient\nincreases above a certain critical value. The onset of dissipation is found to\nbe associated with the generation of dark-bright solitons due to the modulation\ninstability of the counterflow of two spin components. Spin turbulence emerges\nas the solitons decay because of their snake instability. We identify another\ncritical point for spin superflow, in which transverse magnon excitations are\ndynamically generated via spin-exchanging collisions, which leads to the\ntransient formation of axial polar spin domains.\n", "  In this work we present a comparative investigation of the electronic\nstructures of NbO$_2$ and VO$_2$ obtained within the combination of density\nfunctional theory and cluster-dynamical mean field theory calculations. We\ninvestigate the role of dynamic electronic correlations on the electronic\nstructure of the metallic and insulating phases of NbO$_2$ and VO$_2$, with\nfocus on the mechanism responsible for the gap opening in the insulating\nphases. For the rutile metallic phases of both oxides, we obtain that\nelectronic correlations lead to strong renormalization of the $t_{2g}$\nsubbands, as well as the emergence of incoherent Hubbard subbands, signaling\nthat electronic correlations are also important in the metallic phase of\nNbO$_2$. Interestingly, we find that nonlocal dynamic correlations do play a\nrole in the gap formation of the (bct) insulating phase of NbO$_2$, by a\nsimilar physical mechanism as that recently proposed by us in the case of the\n(M$_1$) dimerized phase of VO$_2$ (\\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 056402\n(2016)}). Although the effect of nonlocal dynamic correlations in the gap\nopening of bct phase is less important than in the (M$_1$ and M$_2$) monoclinic\nphases of VO$_2$, their presence indicates that the former is not a purely\nPeierls-type insulator, as it was recently proposed.\n", "  We show that whereas spin-1/2 one-dimensional U(1) quantum-link models (QLMs)\nare topologically trivial, when implemented in ladder-like lattices these\nmodels may present an intriguing ground-state phase diagram, which includes a\nsymmetry protected topological (SPT) phase that may be readily revealed by\nanalyzing long-range string spin correlations along the ladder legs. We propose\na simple scheme for the realization of spin-1/2 U(1) QLMs based on\nsingle-component fermions loaded in an optical lattice with s- and p-bands,\nshowing that the SPT phase may be experimentally realized by adiabatic\npreparation.\n", "  The action potential in a neural membrane is generated by Na+ and K+ channel\nionic currents that may be calculated from a current equation and the rate\nequations for activation variables m and n, and the Na+ inactivation variable\nh. Assuming that a Na+ channel has three activation sensors, and activation and\ninactivation are cooperative processes, a twelve state master equation that\ndescribes channel gating may be reduced to kinetic equations for a five state\nsystem when the occupational probability of the first inactivated state is\nsmall, and the remaining inactivated states contribute to a total inactivated\nstate. In the case of independent activation sensors, the inactivation rate is,\nin general, dependent on the activation variable m(t) as well as the forward\ninactivation transition rates. However, when m(t) has a faster time constant\nthan h(t), the inactivation rate may be approximated by a voltage-dependent\nfunction, and therefore, the solution of the master equation during an action\npotential may be approximated by the solution of Hodgkin-Huxley rate equations\nfor m and h.\n", "  We advocate the idea that the surprising emission of extreme ultra violet\n(EUV) radiation and soft x-rays from the Sun are powered externally by incident\ndark matter (DM) particles. The energy and the spectral shape of this otherwise\nunexpected solar irradiation is estimated within the quark nugget dark matter\nmodel. This model was originally invented as a natural explanation of the\nobserved ratio $\\Omega_{\\rm dark} \\sim \\Omega_{\\rm visible}$ when the DM and\nvisible matter densities assume the same order of magnitude values. This\ngeneric consequence of the model is a result of the common origin of both types\nof matter which are formed during the same QCD transition and both proportional\nto the same fundamental dimensional parameter $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$. We also\npresent arguments suggesting that the transient brightening-like \"nano-flares\"\nin the Sun may be related to the annihilation events which inevitably occur in\nthe solar atmosphere within this dark matter scenario.\n", "  The origins of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain a mystery despite\nextensive searches for their sources. We present constraints from seven years\nof IceCube Neutrino Observatory muon data on the neutrino flux coming from the\nGalactic plane. This flux is expected from cosmic-ray interactions with the\ninterstellar medium or near localized sources. Two methods were developed to\ntest for a spatially-extended flux from the entire plane, both maximum\nlikelihood fits but with different signal and background modeling techniques.\nWe consider three templates for Galactic neutrino emission based primarily on\ngamma-ray observations and models that cover a wide range of possibilities.\nBased on these templates and an unbroken $E^{-2.5}$ power-law energy spectrum,\nwe set 90% confidence level upper limits constraining the possible Galactic\ncontribution to the diffuse neutrino flux to be relatively small, less than 14%\nof the flux reported in Aartsen et al. (2015a) above 1 TeV. A stacking method\nis also used to test catalogs of known high energy Galactic gamma-ray sources.\n", "  Periodic driving fields can induce topological phase transitions, resulting\nin Floquet topological phases with intriguing properties such as very large\nChern numbers and unusual edge states. Whether such Floquet topological phases\ncould generate robust edge state conductance much larger than their static\ncounterparts is an interesting question. In this paper, working under the\nKeldysh formalism, we study two-lead transport via the edge states of\nirradiated quantum Hall insulators using the method of recursive\nFloquet-Green's functions. Focusing on a harmonically-driven Hofstadter model,\nwe show that quantized Hall conductance as large as $8e^2/h$ can be realized,\nbut only after applying the so-called Floquet sum rule. To assess the\nrobustness of edge state transport, we analyze the DC conductance,\ntime-averaged current profile and local density of states. It is found that\nco-propagating chiral edge modes are more robust against disorder and defects\nas compared with the remarkable counter-propagating edge modes, as well as\ncertain symmetry-restricted Floquet edge modes. Furthermore, we go beyond the\nwide-band limit, which is often assumed for the leads, to study how the\nconductance quantization (after applying the Floquet sum rule) of Floquet edge\nstates can be affected if the leads have finite bandwidths. These results may\nbe useful for the design of transport devices based on Floquet topological\nmatter.\n", "  We study a pattern forming instability in a laser driven optically thick\ncloud of cold two-level atoms with a planar feedback mirror. A theoretical\nmodel is developed, enabling a full analysis of transverse patterns in a medium\nwith saturable nonlinearity, taking into account diffraction within the medium,\nand both the transmission and reflection gratings. Focus of the analysis is on\ncombined treatment of nonlinear propagation in a diffractively- and\noptically-thick medium and the boundary condition given by feedback. We\ndemonstrate explicitly how diffraction within the medium breaks the degeneracy\nof Talbot modes inherent in thin slice models. Existence of envelope curves\nbounding all possible pattern formation thresholds is predicted. The importance\nof envelope curves and their interaction with threshold curves is illustrated\nby experimental observation of a sudden transition between length scales as\nmirror displacement is varied.\n", "  SN 2002cx-like Type Ia supernovae (also known as SNe Iax) represent one of\nthe most numerous peculiar SN classes. They differ from normal SNe Ia by having\nfainter peak magnitudes, faster decline rates and lower photospheric\nvelocities, displaying a wide diversity in these properties. We present both\nintegral-field and long-slit visual-wavelength spectroscopy of the host\ngalaxies and explosion sites of SNe Iax to provide constraints on their\nprogenitor formation scenarios. The SN Iax explosion site metallicity\ndistribution is similar to that of core-collapse (CC) SNe and metal-poor\ncompared to normal SNe Ia. Fainter members, speculated to form distinctly from\nbrighter SN Iax, are found at a range of metallicities, extending to very\nmetal-poor environments. Although the SN Iax explosion sites' ages and\nstar-formation rates are comparatively older and less intense than the\ndistribution of star forming regions across their host galaxies, we confirm the\npresence of young stellar populations (SP) at explosion environments for most\nSNe Iax, expanded here to a larger sample. Ages of the young SP (several\n$\\times 10^{7}$ to $10^8$~yrs) are consistent with predictions for young\nthermonuclear and electron-capture SN progenitors. The lack of extremely young\nSP at the explosion sites disfavours very massive progenitors such as\nWolf-Rayet explosions with significant fall-back. We find weak ionised gas in\nthe only SN Iax host without obvious signs of star-formation. The source of the\nionisation remains ambiguous but appears unlikely to be mainly due to young,\nmassive stars.\n", "  Planar ferromagnetic channels have been shown to theoretically support a\nlong-range ordered and coherently precessing state where the balance between\nlocal spin injection at one edge and damping along the channel establishes a\ndissipative exchange flow, sometimes referred to as a spin superfluid. However,\nrealistic materials exhibit in-plane anisotropy, which breaks the axial\nsymmetry assumed in current theoretical models. Here, we study dissipative\nexchange flows in a ferromagnet with in-plane anisotropy from a dispersive\nhydrodynamic perspective. Through the analysis of a boundary value problem for\na damped sine-Gordon equation, dissipative exchange flows in a ferromagnetic\nchannel can be excited above a spin current threshold that depends on material\nparameters and the length of the channel. Symmetry-broken dissipative exchange\nflows display harmonic overtones that redshift the fundamental precessional\nfrequency and lead to a reduced spin pumping efficiency when compared to their\nsymmetric counterpart. Micromagnetic simulations are used to verify that the\nanalytical results are qualitatively accurate, even in the presence of nonlocal\ndipole fields. Simulations also confirm that dissipative exchange flows can be\ndriven by spin transfer torque in a finite-sized region. These results\ndelineate the important material parameters that must be optimized for the\nexcitation of dissipative exchange flows in realistic systems.\n", "  This paper proposes an efficient method for the simultaneous estimation of\nthe state of a quantum system and the classical parameters that govern its\nevolution. This hybrid approach benefits from efficient numerical methods for\nthe integration of stochastic master equations for the quantum system, and\nefficient parameter estimation methods from classical signal processing. The\nclassical techniques use Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, which aim to\noptimize the selection of points within the parameter space, conditioned by the\nmeasurement data obtained. We illustrate these methods using a specific\nexample, an SMC sampler applied to a nonlinear system, the Duffing oscillator,\nwhere the evolution of the quantum state of the oscillator and three\nHamiltonian parameters are estimated simultaneously.\n", "  Motivated by the black hole firewall problem, we find highly entangled pairs\nof spatially localized modes in quantum field theory. We demonstrate that\nappropriately chosen wavepackets localized outside the horizon are nearly\npurified by 'mirror' modes behind the horizon. In addition, we calculate the\nentanglement entropy of a single localized wavepacket in the Minkowski vacuum.\nIn all cases we study, the quantum state of the system becomes pure in the\nlimit that the wavepackets delocalize; we quantify the trade-off between\nlocalization and purity.\n", "  The quantum nature of light-matter interactions in a circularly polarized\nvacuum field was probed by spontaneous emission from quantum dots in\nthree-dimensional chiral photonic crystals. Due to the circularly polarized\neigenmodes along the helical axis in the GaAs-based mirror-asymmetric\nstructures we studied, we observed highly circularly polarized emission from\nthe quantum dots. Both spectroscopic and time-resolved measurements confirmed\nthat the obtained circularly polarized light was influenced by a large\ndifference in the photonic density of states between the orthogonal components\nof the circular polarization in the vacuum field.\n", "  We characterize the information dynamics of strongly disordered systems using\na combination of analytics, exact diagonalization, and matrix product operator\nsimulations. More specifically, we study the spreading of quantum information\nin three different scenarios: thermalizing, Anderson localized, and many-body\nlocalized. We qualitatively distinguish these cases by quantifying the amount\nof remnant information in a local region. The nature of the dynamics is further\nexplored by computing the propagation of mutual information with respect to\nvarying partitions. Finally, we demonstrate that classical simulability, as\ncaptured by the magnitude of MPO truncation errors, exhibits enhanced\nfluctuations near the localization transition, suggesting the possibility of\nits use as a diagnostic of the critical point.\n", "  This Letter discusses topological quantum computation with gapped boundaries\nof two-dimensional topological phases. Systematic methods are presented to\nencode quantum information topologically using gapped boundaries, and to\nperform topologically protected operations on this encoding. In particular, we\nintroduce a new and general computational primitive of topological charge\nmeasurement and present a symmetry-protected implementation of this primitive.\nThroughout the Letter, a concrete physical example, the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric\ncode ($\\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbb{Z}_3)$), is discussed. For this example, we have a\nqutrit encoding and an abstract universal gate set. Physically, gapped\nboundaries of $\\mathfrak{D}(\\mathbb{Z}_3)$ can be realized in bilayer\nfractional quantum Hall $1/3$ systems. If a practical implementation is found\nfor the required topological charge measurement, these boundaries will give\nrise to a direct physical realization of a universal quantum computer based on\na purely abelian topological phase.\n", "  The century long (1914-2007) $H_{\\alpha}$ (656.28 nm) spectroheliograms from\nKodaikanal Solar Observatory (KSO) have been recently digitised. Using these\nnewly calibrated, processed images we study the evolution of dark elongated on\ndisk structures called filaments, potential representatives of magnetic\nactivities on the Sun. To our knowledge this is the oldest uniform digitised\ndataset with daily images available today in $H_{\\alpha}$. We generate\nCarrington maps for entire time duration and try to find the correspondences\nwith maps of same rotation from Ca II K KSO data. Filaments are segmented from\nCarrington maps using a semi-automated technique and are studied individually\nto extract their centroids and tilts. We plot the time-latitude distribution of\nfilament centroids producing Butterfly diagram, which clearly shows presence of\npoleward migration. We separate polar filaments for each cycle and try to\nestimate the delay between the polar filament number cycle and sunspot number\ncycle peaks. We correlate this delay with the same between polar reversal and\nsunspot number maxima. This provides new insight on the role of polar filaments\non polar reversal.\n", "  We present new stringent limits on the mass $M_{bh}$ of the central\nsupermassive black hole for a sample of 7 nearby galaxies. Our $M_{bh}$\nestimates are based on the dynamical modeling of the central width of the\nnebular emission lines measured over subarcsecond apertures with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope. The central stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma_c$ of the\nsample galaxies is derived from new long-slit spectra from ground-based\nobservations and the bulge effective radius is obtained from a two-dimensional\nphotometric decomposition of the i-band images from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. The derived stringent $M_{bh}$ limits run parallel and above the\n$M_{bh}-\\sigma_c$ relation with no systematic trend depending on the galaxy\ndistance or morphology. This gives further support to previous findings\nsuggesting that the nuclear gravitational potential is remarkably well traced\nby the width of the nebular lines when the gas is centrally peaked. With our\ninvestigation, the number of galaxies with stringent $M_{bh}$ limits obtained\nfrom nebular-line width increases to 114 and can be used for studying the\nscaling relations between $M_{bh}$ and properties of their host galaxies.\n", "  Initial RV characterisation of the enigmatic planet Kepler-10c suggested a\nmass of $\\sim17$ M$_\\oplus$, which was remarkably high for a planet with radius\n$2.32$ R$_\\oplus$; further observations and subsequent analysis hinted at a\n(possibly much) lower mass, but masses derived using RVs from two different\nspectrographs (HARPS-N and HIRES) were incompatible at a $3\\sigma$-level. We\ndemonstrate here how such mass discrepancies may readily arise from sub-optimal\nsampling and/or neglecting to model even a single coherent signal (stellar,\nplanetary, or otherwise) that may be present in RVs. We then present a\nplausible resolution of the mass discrepancy, and ultimately characterise\nKepler-10c as having mass $7.37_{-1.19}^{+1.32}$ M$_\\oplus$, and mean density\n$3.14^{+0.63}_{-0.55}$ g cm$^{-3}$.\n", "  We propose a method for the measurement of adiabatic phases of periodically\ndriven quantum systems coupled to an open cavity that enables dispersive\nreadout. It turns out that the cavity transmission exhibits peaks at\nfrequencies determined by a resonance condition that involves the dynamical and\nthe geometric phase. Since these phases scale differently with the driving\nfrequency, one can determine them by fitting the peak positions to the\ntheoretically expected behavior. For the derivation of the resonance condition\nand for a numerical study, we develop a Floquet theory for the dispersive\nreadout of ac-driven quantum systems. The feasibility is demonstrated for two\ntest cases that generalize Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana interference to\ntwo-parameter driving.\n", "  The apparent splitting between orbitals that are spin-orbit partners can be\nsubstantially influenced by the effects of finite binding. In particular, such\neffects can account for the observed decrease in separation of the neutron\n$1p_{3/2}$ and $1p_{1/2}$ orbitals between the $^{41}$Ca and $^{35}$Si\nisotopes. This behavior has been the subject of recent experimental and\ntheoretical works and cited as evidence for a proton \"bubble\" in $^{34}$Si\ncausing an explicit weakening of the spin-orbit interaction. The results\nreported here suggest that the change in the separation between the $1p_{3/2}$\nand $1p_{1/2}$ partners occurs dominantly because of the behavior of the\nenergies of these $1p$ neutron states near zero binding.\n", "  We study two-photon contribution to the elastic lepton-proton scattering,\nassociated with sigma meson exchange, with special attention paid to the low-Q2\nregion. We show that the corresponding amplitude grows sharply but remains\nfinite at Q2->0. The analytical formula for the amplitude at Q2=0 is obtained.\nWe also estimate the shift of the muonic hydrogen energy levels, induced by\nsigma meson exchange. For the 2S level the shift is approximately 30 times\nsmaller than needed to resolve the proton radius puzzle, but still exceeds the\nprecision of the muonic hydrogen measurements.\n", "  While the dynamics of a fully flexible polymer ejecting a capsid through a\nnanopore has been extensively studied, the ejection dynamics of semiflexible\npolymers has not been properly characterized. Here we report results from\nsimulations of ejection dynamics of semiflexible polymers ejecting from\nspherical capsids. Ejections start from strongly confined polymer conformations\nof constant initial monomer density. We find that, unlike for fully flexible\npolymers, for semiflexible polymers the force measured at the pore does not\nshow a direct relation to the instantaneous ejection velocity. The cumulative\nwaiting time $t(s)$, that is, the time at which a monomer $s$ exits the capsid\nthe last time, shows a clear change when increasing the polymer rigidity\n$\\kappa$. Major part of an ejecting polymer is driven out of the capsid by\ninternal pressure. At the final stage the polymer escapes the capsid by\ndiffusion. For the driven part there is a cross-over from essentially\nexponential growth of $t$ with $s$ of the fully flexible polymers to a\nscale-invariant form. In addition, a clear dependence of $t$ on $N_0$ was\nfound. These findings combined give the dependence $t(s) \\propto N_0^{0.55}\ns^{1.33}$ for the strongly rigid polymers. This cross-over in dynamics where\n$\\kappa$ acts as a control parameter is reminiscent of a phase transition. This\nanalogy is further enhanced by our finding a perfect data collapse of $t$ for\npolymers of different $N_0$ and any constant $\\kappa$.\n", "  Multi-component electronic systems can appear in solid state systems with\nactive orbital band structures. They exhibit richer structures of topological\nsuperconductivity beyond the conventional scenarios of spin singlet and triplet\npairings in spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Examples include the half-Heusler\ncompounds RPtBi series (R for a rare earth element), whose electronic\nstructures are described by the effective Luttinger-Kohn model with\nspin-$\\frac{3}{2}$ fermions exhibiting strong spin-orbit coupling and band\nconversion. Recent experiments provide evidence to unconventional\nsuperconductivity in the YPtBi material with nodal spin-septet pairing. We\nsystematically study topological pairing structures in spin-$\\frac{3}{2}$\nsystems with cubic group symmetries and calculate surface Majorana spectra,\nwhich exhibit both the zero energy flat band and the cubic dispersion. The\nsignatures of these surface states in the quasi-particle interference patterns\nare studied, which can be tested in future tunneling experiments.\n", "  High-precision photometry from space-based missions such as K2 and TESS\nenables detailed studies of young star variability. However, because\nspace-based observing campaigns are often short (e.g., 80 days for K2),\ncomplementary long-baseline photometric surveys are critical for obtaining a\ncomplete understanding of young star variability, which can change on\ntimescales of minutes to years. We therefore present and analyze light curves\nof members of the Upper Scorpius association made over 5.5 years by the\nground-based Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), which complement the\nhigh-precision observations of this region taken by K2 during its Campaigns~2\nand 15. We show that KELT data accurately identify the periodic signals found\nwith high-precision K2 photometry, demonstrating the power of ground-based\nsurveys in deriving stellar rotation periods of young stars. We also use KELT\ndata to identify sources exhibiting variability that is likely related to\ncircumstellar material and/or stellar activity cycles; these signatures are\noften unseen in the short-term K2 data, illustrating the importance of\nlong-term monitoring surveys for studying the full range of young star\nvariability. We provide the KELT light curves as electronic tables in an\nongoing effort to establish legacy time-series datasets for young stellar\nclusters.\n", "  We use numerical N-body hydrodynamical simulations with varying PopIII\nstellar models to investigate the possibility of detecting first star\nsignatures with observations of high-redshift damped Ly$\\alpha$ absorbers\n(DLAs). The simulations include atomic and molecular cooling, star formation,\nenergy feedback and metal spreading due to the evolution of stars with a range\nof masses and metallicities. Different initial mass functions (IMFs) and\ncorresponding metal-dependent yields and lifetimes are adopted to model\nprimordial stellar populations. The DLAs in the simulations are selected\naccording to either the local gas temperature (temperature selected) or the\nhost mass (mass selected). We find that 3\\% (40\\%) of mass (temperature)\nselected high-$z$ ($z\\ge5.5$) DLAs retain signatures of pollution from PopIII\nstars, independently from the first star model. Such DLAs have low halo mass\n($<10^{9.6}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$), metallicity ($<10^{-3}\\,\\rm Z_{\\odot}$) and star\nformation rate ($<10^{-1.5}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}\\,yr^{-1}$). { Metal abundance ratios\nof DLAs imprinted in the spectra of QSO} can be useful tools to infer the\nproperties of the polluting stellar generation and to constrain the first star\nmass ranges. Comparing the abundance ratios derived from our simulations to\nthose observed in DLAs at $z\\ge5$, we find that most of these DLAs are\nconsistent within errors with PopII stars dominated enrichment and strongly\ndisfavor the pollution pattern of very massive first stars (i.e. 100~$\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$-500~$\\rm M_{\\odot}$). However, some of them could still result from\nthe pollution of first stars in the mass range [0.1, 100]~$\\rm M_{\\odot}$. In\nparticular, we find that the abundance ratios from SDSS J1202+3235 are\nconsistent with those expected from PopIII enrichment dominated by massive (but\nnot extreme) first stars.\n", "  We report new searches for the solar axions and galactic axion-like dark\nmatter particles, using the first low-background data from PandaX-II experiment\nat China Jinping Underground Laboratory, corresponding to a total exposure of\nabout $2.7\\times 10^4$ kg$\\cdot$day. No solar axion or galactic axion-like dark\nmatter particle candidate has been identified. The upper limit on the\naxion-electron coupling ($g_{Ae}$) from the solar flux is found to be about\n$4.35 \\times 10^{-12}$ in mass range from $10^{-5}$ to 1 keV/$c^2$ with 90\\%\nconfidence level, similar to the recent LUX result. We also report a new best\nlimit from the $^{57}$Fe de-excitation. On the other hand, the upper limit from\nthe galactic axions is on the order of $10^{-13}$ in the mass range from 1\nkeV/$c^2$ to 10 keV/$c^2$ with 90\\% confidence level, slightly improved\ncompared with the LUX.\n", "  We study the vertical structure of polytropic, $P\\propto \\rho^\\Gamma$,\ncentrifugally-supported gaseous discs embedded in cold dark matter (CDM) halos.\nAt fixed radius $R$, the shape of the vertical density profile depends only\nweakly on whether the disc is self-gravitating (SG) or not (NSG). The disc\nthickness, set by the midplane sound speed and circular velocity, $(c_s/V_c)R$,\nin the NSG case, and by the sound speed and surface density, $c_s^2/G\\Sigma$,\nin SG discs, is smaller than either of these scales. SG discs are typically\nToomre unstable, NSG discs are stable. Exponential discs in CDM halos with\nroughly flat circular velocity curves generally \"flare\" outwards. For the\npolytropic equation of state of the EAGLE simulations, discs whose mass and\nsize match observational constraints are stable (NSG) for $M_d< 3\\times 10^9\\,\nM_\\odot$ and unstable (SG) at higher masses, if fully gaseous. We test these\nanalytic results using a set of idealized SPH simulations and find excellent\nagreement. Our results clarify the role of the gravitational softening on the\nthickness of simulated discs, and on the onset of radial instabilities. EAGLE\nlow-mass discs are non-self-gravitating so the softening plays no role in their\nvertical structure. High-mass discs, on the other hand, are expected to be\nself-gravitating and unstable, and may be artificially thickened and stabilized\nunless gravity is well resolved. Simulations with spatial resolution high\nenough to not compromise the vertical structure of a disc also resolve the\nonset of their instabilities, but the converse is not true: resolving\ninstabilities does not guarantee that the vertical structure is resolved.\n", "  The duration-luminosity phase space of optical transients is used, mostly\nheuristically, to compare various classes of transient events, to explore the\norigin of new transients, and to influence optical survey observing strategies.\nFor example, several observational searches have been guided by intriguing\nvoids and gaps in this phase space. However we should ask: Do we expect to find\ntransients in these voids given our understanding of the various heating\nsources operating in astrophysical transients? In this work, we explore a broad\nrange of theoretical models and empirical relations to generate optical light\ncurves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS). We explore\ntransients powered by adiabatic expansion, radioactive decay, magnetar\nspin-down, and circumstellar interaction. For each heating source, we provide a\nconcise summary of the basic physical processes, a physically motivated choice\nof model parameter ranges, an overall summary of the resulting light curves and\ntheir the occupied range in the DLPS, and how the various model input\nparameters affect the light curves. We specifically explore the key voids\ndiscussed in the literature: the intermediate luminosity gap between classical\nnovae and supernovae, and short-duration transients (<10 days). We find that\nfew physical models lead to transients that occupy these voids. Moreover, we\nfind that only relativistic expansion can produce fast and luminous transients,\nwhile for all other heating sources, events with durations <10 days are dim (>\n-15 mag). Finally, we explore the detection potential of optical surveys (e.g.,\nLSST) in the DLPS and quantify the notion that short-duration and dim\ntransients are exponentially more difficult to discover in untargeted surveys.\n", "  Photon subtraction from squeezed states is a powerful scheme to create good\napproximation of so-called Schr\\\"odinger cat states. However, conventional\ncontinuous-wave-based methods actually involve some impurity in squeezing of\nlocalized wavepackets, even in the ideal case of no optical losses. Here we\ntheoretically discuss this impurity, by introducing mode-match of squeezing.\nFurthermore, here we propose a method to remove this impurity by filtering the\nphoton-subtraction field. Our method in principle enables creation of pure\nphoton-subtracted squeezed states, which was not possible with conventional\nmethods.\n", "  The first observation of the $D^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $D^0 \\to\nK^+K^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays is reported using a sample of proton-proton collisions\ncollected by LHCb at a center-of-mass energy of 8$\\,$TeV, and corresponding to\n2$\\,$fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. The corresponding branching fractions\nare measured using as normalization the decay $D^0 \\to K^-\n\\pi^+[\\mu^+\\mu^-]_{\\rho^0/\\omega}$, where the two muons are consistent with\ncoming from the decay of a $\\rho^0$ or $\\omega$ meson. The results are\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^0 \\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-\\mu^+\\mu^-)=(9.64\\pm0.48\\pm0.51\\pm0.97)\\times10^{-7}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^0 \\to K^+K^-\\mu^+\\mu^-)=(\n1.54\\pm0.27\\pm0.09\\pm0.16)\\times10^{-7}$, where the uncertainties are\nstatistical, systematic, and due to the limited knowledge of the normalization\nbranching fraction. The dependence of the branching fraction on the dimuon mass\nis also investigated.\n", "  We have newly observed the Class 0/I protostar L1527 IRS using the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during its Cycle 1 in 220 GHz dust\ncontinuum and C18O (J=2-1) line emissions with a ~2 times higher angular\nresolution (~0.5\") and ~4 times better sensitivity than our ALMA Cycle 0\nobservations. Continuum emission shows elongation perpendicular to the\nassociated outflow, with a deconvolved size of 0.53\"x0.15\". C18O emission shows\nsimilar elongation, indicating that both emissions trace the disk and the\nflattened envelope surrounding the protostar. The velocity gradient of the C18O\nemission along the elongation due to rotation of the disk/envelope system is\nre-analyzed, identifying Keplerian rotation proportional to r^-0.5 more clearly\nthan the Cycle 0 observations. The Keplerian-disk radius and the dynamical\nstellar mass are kinematically estimated to be ~74 AU and ~0.45 Mo,\nrespectively. The continuum visibility is fitted by models without any annulus\naveraging, revealing that the disk is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The best-fit\nmodel also suggests a density jump by a factor of ~5 between the disk and the\nenvelope, suggesting that disks around protostars can be geometrically\ndistinguishable from the envelope from a viewpoint of density contrast.\nImportantly, the disk radius geometrically identified with the density jump is\nconsistent with the radius kinematically estimated. Possible origin of the\ndensity jump due to the mass accretion from the envelope to the disk is\ndiscussed. C18O observations can be reproduced by the same geometrical\nstructures derived from the dust observations, with possible C18O freeze-out\nand localized C18O desorption.\n", "  We carry out a re-analysis of the photometric data in Cousin RI bands which\nwas taken under the Nainital Microlensing Survey during 1998 to 2002 with the\naim to detect gravitational microlensing events in the direction of M31. Here,\nwe do photometric analysis of a faint W UMa binary CSS_J004259.3+410629\nidentified in the target field. The orbital period of this star is found to be\n0.266402+/-0.000018 day. The photometric mass ratio, q, is found to be\n0.28+/-0.01. The photometric light curves are investigated using the\nWilson-Devinney code and absolute parameters are determined using empirical\nrelations which provide masses and radii of the binary as M1 = 1.19+/-0.09\nMsun, M2 = 0.33+/-0.02 Msun and R1 = 1.02+/-0.04 Rsun, R2 = 0.58+/-0.08 Rsun\nbased on the Rc band data. Almost similar values are found by analysing Ic band\ndata. From the photometric light curve examination, the star is understood to\nbe a low mass-ratio over-contact binary of A-subtype with a high fill-out\nfactor of about 47%. The binary system is found to be located approximately at\na distance of 2.64+/-0.03 kpc having a separation of 2.01+/-0.05 Rsun between\nthe two components.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that line profile distortions are commonly observed\nin gravitationally lensed quasar spectra. We investigate the effect of\ngravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission line profiles and their\nunderlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR\nmodels with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we\nconsidered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various\nsizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables:\n$\\mu^{BLR}$, the total magnification of the broad emission line; $\\mu^{cont}$,\nthe magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and\nwings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the line profile distortions. The\nsimulations showed that distortions of line profiles, such as those recently\nobserved in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the\ndifferential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR.\nWhile the magnification of the emission line $\\mu^{BLR}$ sets an upper limit on\nthe BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum $\\mu^{cont}$\nsets an upper limit on the size of the continuum source, the line profile\ndistortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics. We thus built\n(WCI,RBI) diagrams that can serve as diagnostic diagrams to discriminate\nbetween the various BLR models on the basis of quantitative measurements. It\nappears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the\nsize of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that\ncase, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to\nproduce distinctive line profile distortions for a limited number of caustic\nconfigurations, which facilitates their discrimination.\n", "  Large-area thin films of topological Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi are grown on\namorphous SiO$_2$:Si substrates to realise a field-effect transistor with the\ndoped Si acting as back gate. As-grown films show charge carrier mobilities\nexceeding 7,000 cm$^2$/Vs and carrier densities below 3 $\\times $10$^{18}$\ncm$^{-3}$, comparable to the best thin-film Na$_3$Bi. An ambipolar field effect\nand minimum conductivity are observed, characteristic of Dirac electronic\nsystems. The results are quantitatively understood within a model of\ndisorder-induced charge inhomogeneity in topological Dirac semimetals. Due to\nthe inverted band structure, the hole mobility is significantly larger than the\nelectron mobility in Na$_3$Bi, and when present, these holes dominate the\ntransport properties.\n", "  We find a new $CP$-violation effect in charm decays into neutral kaons, which\nresults from the interference between two tree (Cabibbo-favored and doubly\nCabibbo-suppressed) amplitudes with the mixing of final-state mesons. This\neffect, estimated to be of an order of $10^{-3}$, is much larger than the\ndirect $CP$ asymmetries in these decays, but missed in the literature. It can\nbe revealed by measuring the difference of the time-dependent $CP$ asymmetries\nin the $D^{+}\\to\\pi^{+}K_S^0$ and $D_{s}^{+}\\to K^{+} K_S^0$ modes, which are\naccessible at the LHCb and Belle II experiments. If confirmed, the new effect\nhas to be taken into account, as the above direct $CP$ asymmetries are used to\nsearch for new physics.\n", "  In this 5th paper of the series, we examine the spectroscopy and morphology\nof four southern Galactic planetary nebulae Hen 2-141, NGC5307, IC 2553, and\nPB6 using new integral field spectroscopy data. The morphologies and ionization\nstructures of the sample are given as a set of emission-line maps. In addition,\nthe physical conditions, chemical compositions, and kinematical characteristics\nof these objects are derived. The results show that PB6 and Hen 2-141 are of\nvery high excitation classes and IC 2553 and NGC5307 are mid to high excitation\nobjects. The elemental abundances reveal that PB6 is of Type I, Hen 2-141 and\nIC 2553 are of Type IIa, and NGC5307 of Type IIb/III. The observations unveil\nthe presence of well- defined low-ionization structures or \\knots\" in all\nobjects. The diagnostic diagrams reveal that the excitation mechanism of these\nknots is probably by photo-ionization of dense material by the nebular central\nstars. The physical analysis of six of these knots show no significant\ndifferences with their surrounding nebular gas, except their lower electron\ndensities. In spite of the enhancement of the low-ionization emission lines of\nthese knots, their chemical abundances are nearly comparable to their\nsurrounding nebulae, with the exception of perhaps slightly higher nitrogen\nabundances in the NGC5307 knots. The integrated spectrum of IC 2553 reveals\nthat nearly all key lines that have led researchers to characterize its central\nstar as a weak-emission line star type are in fact of nebular origin.\n", "  We investigate the correspondence between the tight-binding Floquet\nHamiltonian of a periodically modulated honeycomb lattice and the Haldane\nmodel. We show that - though the two systems share the same topological phase\ndiagram, as reported in a breakthrough experiment with ultracold atoms in a\nstretched honeycomb lattice [Jotzu et al., Nature 515, 237 (2014)] - the\ncorresponding Hamiltonians are not equivalent, the one of the shaken lattice\npresenting a much richer structure.\n", "  The process ${\\rm p}{\\rm p}\\to\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu{\\rm e}^+\\nu_{\\rm e}{\\rm j}{\\rm j}$\nreceives several contributions of different orders in the strong and\nelectroweak coupling constants. Using appropriate event selections, this\nprocess is dominated by vector-boson scattering (VBS) and has recently been\nmeasured at the LHC. It is thus of prime importance to estimate precisely each\ncontribution. In this article we compute for the first time the full NLO QCD\nand electroweak corrections to VBS and its irreducible background processes\nwith realistic experimental cuts. We do not rely on approximations but use\ncomplete amplitudes involving two different orders at tree level and three\ndifferent orders at one-loop level. Since we take into account all\ninterferences, at NLO level the corrections to the VBS process and to the\nQCD-induced irreducible background process contribute at the same orders. Hence\nthe two processes cannot be unambiguously distinguished, and all contributions\nto the $\\mu^+\\nu_\\mu{\\rm e}^+\\nu_{\\rm e}{\\rm j}{\\rm j}$ final state should be\npreferably measured together.\n", "  The growth and migration of planetesimals in a young protoplanetary disc are\nfundamental to planet formation. In all models of early growth, there are\nseveral processes that can inhibit grains from reaching larger sizes.\nNevertheless, observations suggest that growth of planetesimals must be rapid.\nIf a small number of 100 km sized planetesimals do manage to form in the disc,\nthen gas drag effects could enable them to efficiently accrete small solids\nfrom beyond their gravitationally focused cross-section. This gas drag-enhanced\naccretion can allow planetesimals to grow at rapid rates, in principle. We\npresent self-consistent hydrodynamics simulations with direct particle\nintegration and gas drag coupling to estimate the rate of planetesimal growth\ndue to pebble accretion. Wind tunnel simulations are used to explore a range of\nparticle sizes and disc conditions. We also explore analytic estimates of\nplanetesimal growth and numerically integrate planetesimal drift due to the\naccretion of small solids. Our results show that, for almost every case that we\nconsider, there is a clearly preferred particle size for accretion that depends\non the properties of the accreting planetesimal and the local disc conditions.\nFor solids much smaller than the preferred particle size, accretion rates are\nsignificantly reduced as the particles are entrained in the gas and flow around\nthe planetesimal. Solids much larger than the preferred size accrete at rates\nconsistent with gravitational focusing. Our analytic estimates for pebble\naccretion highlight the timescales that are needed for the growth of large\nobjects under different disc conditions and initial planetesimal sizes.\n", "  Many pulsating low-mass white-dwarf stars have been detected in the last\nyears in the field of our Galaxy. Given that some of them exhibit multiperiodic\nvariation of brightness, it is possible to probe their interiors through\nasteroseismology. We present a detailed asteroseismological study of all the\nknown low-mass variable white dwarf stars based on a complete set of fully\nevolutionary models representative of low-mass He-core white dwarf stars. We\nemployed adiabatic radial and nonradial pulsation periods for low-mass white\ndwarf models with stellar masses ranging from $0.1554$ to $0.4352\\ M_{\\odot}$,\nthat were derived by simulating the nonconservative evolution of a binary\nsystem consisting of an initially $1 M_{\\odot}$ ZAMS star and a $1.4 M_{\\odot}$\nneutron star companion. We estimated the mean period spacing for the stars\nunder study and then we used the comparison between the observed period spacing\nwith the average of the computed period spacings for our grid of models to\nconstrain the stellar mass. We also employed the individual observed periods of\nevery known pulsating low-mass white dwarf star, to search for a representative\nseismological model. We found that even though the stars under analysis exhibit\nfew periods and the period fits show multiplicity of solutions, it is possible\nto find seismological models whose mass and effective temperature are in\nagreement with the values given by spectroscopy, for most of the cases. In the\ntwo cases where we could extract the period spacing from the set of observed\nperiods, this method led to values of the stellar masses substantially larger\nthan expected for this type of stars. The results presented in this work show\nin the one hand, the need for further photometric searches, and on the other\nhand, some improvements of the theoretical models, in order to place the\nasteroseismological results on a firmer ground.\n", "  The distribution of FRB fluxes and fluences is characterized by a few very\nbright events and a deficiency of fainter events compared to expectations for a\nhomogeneous space-filling distribution. I define a metric to quantify this, and\napply it to the 17 presently known Parkes FRB, products of a comparatively\nhomogeneous search. With 98\\% confidence we reject the hypothesis of a\nhomogeneous distribution in Euclidean space. Possible explanations include a\nreduction of fainter events by cosmological redshifts or evolution or a\ncosmologically local concentration of events. The former is opposed by the\nsmall value of the one known FRB redshift. The latter contradicts the\nCosmological Principle, but may be explained if the brighter FRB originate in\nthe Local Supercluster.\n", "  Architectures based on waveguide quantum electrodynamics have emerged as\npromising candidates for quantum networks. In this paper, we analyze the\npropagation of single-photons in disordered many-atom waveguides. We pay\nspecial attention to the influence of chirality (directionality of photon\ntransport) on the formation of localized photonic states, considering\nseparately the cases of the disorder in the atomic positions and in the atomic\ntransition frequencies.\n", "  An analytical approximation for the eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric\nHamiltonian $\\mathsf{H} = -d^{2}/dx^{2} - (\\mathrm{i}x)^{\\epsilon+2}$,\n$\\epsilon > -1$ is developed via simple basis sets of harmonic-oscillator wave\nfunctions with variable frequencies and equilibrium positions. We demonstrate\nthat our approximation provides high accuracy for any given energy level for\nall values of $\\epsilon > -1$.\n", "  We develop a formalism to extend our previous work on the electromagnetic\n$\\delta$-function plates to a spherical surface. The electric ($\\lambda_e$) and\nmagnetic ($\\lambda_g$) couplings to the surface are through $\\delta$-function\npotentials defining the dielectric permittivity and the diamagnetic\npermeability, with two anisotropic coupling tensors. The formalism incorporates\ndispersion. The electromagnetic Green's dyadic breaks up into transverse\nelectric and transverse magnetic parts. We derive the Casimir interaction\nenergy between two concentric $\\delta$-function spheres in this formalism and\nshow that it has the correct asymptotic flat plate limit. We systematically\nderive expressions for the Casimir self-energy and the total stress on a\nspherical shell using a $\\delta$-function potential, properly regulated by\ntemporal and spatial point-splitting, which are different from the conventional\ntemporal point-splitting. In strong coupling, we recover the usual result for\nthe perfectly conducting spherical shell but in addition, there is an\nintegrated curvature-squared divergent contribution. For finite coupling, there\nare additional divergent contributions; in particular, there is a familiar\nlogarithmic divergence occurring in the third order of the uniform asymptotic\nexpansion that renders it impossible to extract a unique finite energy except\nin the case of an isorefractive sphere, which translates into\n$\\lambda_g=-\\lambda_e$.\n", "  A systematic approach for deriving tight-binding approximations in general\nlongitudinally driven lattices is presented. As prototypes, honeycomb and\nstaggered square lattices are considered. Time-reversal symmetry is broken by\nvarying/rotating the waveguides, longitudinally, along the direction of\npropagation. Different sublattice rotation and structure are allowed. Linear\nFloquet bands are constructed for intricate sublattice rotation patterns such\nas counter rotation, phase offset rotation, as well as different lattice sizes\nand frequencies. An asymptotic analysis of the edge modes, valid in a\nrapid-spiraling regime, reveals linear and nonlinear envelopes which are\ngoverned by linear and nonlinear Schrodinger equations, respectively. Nonlinear\nstates, referred to as topologically protected edge solitons are unidirectional\nedge modes. Direct numerical simulations for both the linear and nonlinear edge\nstates agree with the asymptotic theory. Topologically protected modes are\nfound; they possess unidirectionality and do not scatter at lattice defect\nboundaries.\n", "  Magnetic fields are widely observed in the Universe in virtually all\nastrophysical objects, from individual stars to entire galaxies, even in the\nintergalactic medium, but their specific generation has long been debated. Due\nto the development of more realistic models of galaxy formation, viable\nscenarios are emerging to explain cosmic magnetism, thanks to both deeper\nobservations and more efficient and accurate computer simulations. We present\nhere a new cosmological high-resolution zoom-in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation, using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) technique, of a dwarf\ngalaxy with an initially weak and uniform magnetic seed field that is amplified\nby a small-scale dynamo driven by supernova-induced turbulence. As first\nstructures form from the gravitational collapse of small density fluctuations,\nthe frozen-in magnetic field separates from the cosmic expansion and grows\nthrough compression. In a second step, star formation sets in and establishes a\nstrong galactic fountain, self-regulated by supernova explosions. Inside the\ngalaxy, the interstellar medium becomes highly turbulent, dominated by strong\nsupersonic shocks, as demonstrated by the spectral analysis of the gas kinetic\nenergy. In this turbulent environment, the magnetic field is quickly amplified\nvia a small-scale dynamo process and is finally carried out into the\ncircumgalactic medium by a galactic wind. This realistic cosmological\nsimulation explains how initially weak magnetic seed fields can be amplified\nquickly in early, feedback-dominated galaxies, and predicts, as a consequence\nof the small scale dynamo process, that high-redshift magnetic fields are\nlikely to be dominated by their small scale components.\n", "  We study the fractal structure of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (DLA)\nclusters on the square lattice by extensive numerical simulations (with\nclusters having up to $10^8$ particles). We observe that DLA clusters undergo\nstrongly anisotropic growth, with the maximal growth rate along the axes. The\nnaive scaling limit of a DLA cluster by its diameter is thus deterministic and\none-dimensional. At the same time, on all scales from the particle size to the\nsize of the entire cluster it has non-trivial box-counting fractal dimension\nwhich corresponds to the overall growth rate which, in turn, is smaller than\nthe growth rate along the axes. This suggests that the fractal nature of the\nlattice DLA should be understood in terms of fluctuations around\none-dimensional backbone of the cluster.\n", "  Retroactivity arises when the coupling of a molecular network $\\mathcal{U}$\nto a downstream network $\\mathcal{D}$ results in signal propagation back from\n$\\mathcal{D}$ to $\\mathcal{U}$. The phenomenon represents a breakdown in\nmodularity of biochemical circuits and hampers the rational design of complex\nfunctional networks. Considering simple models of signal-transduction\narchitectures, we demonstrate the strong dependence of retroactivity on the\nproperties of the upstream system, and explore the cost and efficacy of\nfuel-consuming insulating motifs that can mitigate retroactive effects. We find\nthat simple insulating motifs can suppress retroactivity at a low fuel cost by\ncoupling only weakly to the upstream system $\\mathcal{U}$. However, this design\napproach reduces the signalling network's robustness to perturbations from leak\nreactions, and potentially compromises its ability to respond to\nrapidly-varying signals.\n", "  This work considers the timescales associated with the global order parameter\nand the interlayer synchronization of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on\nmultiplexes. For the two-layer multiplexes with initially high degree of\nsynchronization in each layer, the difference between the average phases in\neach layer is analyzed from two different perspectives: the spectral analysis\nand the non-linear Kuramoto model. Both viewpoints confirm that the prior\ntimescales are inversely proportional to the interlayer coupling strength.\nThus, increasing the interlayer coupling always shortens the transient regimes\nof both the global order parameter and the interlayer synchronization.\nSurprisingly, the analytical results show that the convergence of the global\norder parameter is faster than the interlayer synchronization, and the latter\nis generally faster than the global synchronization of the multiplex. The\nformalism also outlines the effects of frequencies on the difference between\nthe average phases of each layer, and identifies the conditions for an\noscillatory behavior. Computer simulations are in fairly good agreement with\nthe analytical findings and reveal that the timescale of the global order\nparameter is at least half times smaller than timescale of the multiplex.\n", "  Deuterium fractionation, i.e. the enhancement of deuterated species with\nrespect to the non-deuterated ones, is considered to be a reliable chemical\nclock of star-forming regions. This process is strongly affected by the\northo-to-para (o-p) H$_2$ ratio. In this letter we explore the effect of the\no-p H$_2$ conversion on grains on the deuteration timescale in fully depleted\ndense cores, including the most relevant uncertainties that affect this complex\nprocess. We show that (i) the o-p H$_2$ conversion on grains is not strongly\ninfluenced by the uncertainties on the conversion time and the sticking\ncoefficient and (ii) that the process is controlled by the temperature and the\nresidence time of ortho-H$_2$ on the surface, i.e. by the binding energy. We\nfind that for binding energies in between 330-550 K, depending on the\ntemperature, the o-p H$_2$ conversion on grains can shorten the deuterium\nfractionation timescale by orders of magnitude, opening a new route to explain\nthe large observed deuteration fraction $D_\\mathrm{frac}$ in dense molecular\ncloud cores. Our results suggest that the star formation timescale, when\nestimated through the timescale to reach the observed deuteration fractions,\nmight be shorter than previously proposed. However, more accurate measurements\nof the binding energy are needed to better assess the overall role of this\nprocess.\n", "  Axisymmetric rotating radially excited boson stars are analyzed. For several\nfixed parameter sets, the full sets of solutions are obtained. In contrast to\nthe nodeless boson stars, the radially excited sets of solutions do not exhibit\na spiraling behavior. Instead they form a loop, when the boson frequency is\nvaried from its maximal value given by the boson mass to a minimal value and\nback. Thus for all allowed boundary data of the scalar field at the origin,\nthere are two distinct solutions, except for the endpoints. While one endpoint\ncorresponds to the trivial solution, the other one represents the most compact\nsolution. The energy density and the pressures of the solutions are analyzed. A\ndecomposition of the scalar field into spherical harmonics is performed, and\nstability considerations are presented.\n", "  A recent analysis by one of the authors\\cite{Perivolaropoulos:2016ucs} has\nindicated the presence of a $2\\sigma$ signal of spatially oscillating new force\nresiduals in the torsion balance data of the Washington experiment. We extend\nthat study and analyse the data of the Stanford Optically Levitated Microsphere\nExperiment (SOLME) \\cite{Rider:2016xaq} (kindly provided by the authors of\n\\cite{Rider:2016xaq}) searching for sub-mm spatially oscillating new force\nsignals. We find a statistically significant oscillating signal for a force\nresidual of the form $F(z)=\\alpha \\; cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\; z +c)$ where\n$z$ is the distance between the macroscopic interacting masses (levitated\nmicrosphere and cantilever). The best fit parameter values are $\\alpha=(1.1 \\pm\n0.4)\\times 10^{-17}N$, $\\lambda=(35.2\\pm 0.6)\\mu m$. Monte Carlo simulation of\nthe SOLME data under the assumption of zero force residuals has indicated that\nthe statistical significance of this signal is at about $2\\sigma$ level.\nPrivate communication with members of the SOLME group has indicated that this\npreviously unnoticed signal is most probably due to a systematic effect\n(diffraction of non-Gaussian tails of the laser beam). Thus it can only be\nuseful as an upper bound of the amplitude of new spatially oscillating forces\non sub-mm scales. Assuming gravitational origin emerging from a fundamental\nmodification of the Newtonian potential of the form\n$V_{eff}(r)=-G\\frac{M}{r}(1+\\alpha_O \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\;\nr+\\theta))\\equiv V_{N}(r)+V_{osc}(r)$, we evaluate the source integral and\nobtain a bound $\\alpha_O < 10^7$ for $\\lambda \\simeq 35 \\mu m$. Thus, we get no\nuseful constraints on the modified gravity parameter $\\alpha_O$. However, the\nconstraints on the general phenomenological parameter $\\alpha$ can be useful in\nconstraining other fifth force models related to dark energy (chameleon\noscillating potentials etc).\n", "  Searches for invisible Higgs decays at the Large Hadron Collider constrain\ndark matter Higgs-portal models, where dark matter interacts with the Standard\nModel fields via the Higgs boson. While these searches complement dark matter\ndirect-detection experiments, a comparison of the two limits depends on the\ncoupling of the Higgs boson to the nucleons forming the direct-detection\nnuclear target, typically parameterized in a single quantity $f_N$. We evaluate\n$f_N$ using recent phenomenological and lattice-QCD calculations, and include\nfor the first time the coupling of the Higgs boson to two nucleons via\npion-exchange currents. We observe a partial cancellation for Higgs-portal\nmodels that makes the two-nucleon contribution anomalously small. Our results,\nsummarized as $f_N=0.308(18)$, show that the uncertainty of the Higgs-nucleon\ncoupling has been vastly overestimated in the past. The improved limits\nhighlight that state-of-the-art nuclear physics input is key to fully\nexploiting experimental searches.\n", "  High precision measurements of stellar spectroscopic line profiles and their\nchanges over time contain very valuable information about the physics of the\nstellar photosphere (stellar activity) and can be used to characterize\nextrasolar planets via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect or from reflected light\nfrom the planet.\n  In this paper we present a new method for measuring small changes in the mean\nline profile of a spectrum by performing what we call differential Least\nSquares Deconvolution (dLSD). The method consists in finding the convolution\nfunction (or kernel) required to transform a high signal-to-noise ratio\ntemplate of the star into each observed spectrum. Compared to similar\ntechniques, the method presented here does not require any assumptions on the\ntemplate spectrum (eg. no line-list or cross-correlation mask required).\n  We show that our implementation of dLSD is able to perform -at least- as good\nas other techniques by applying it to star-planet obliquity measurements of\nexoplanet HD183799 during its transit. Among other things, the method should\nenable model independent detection of light reflected by an exoplanet.\n", "  Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on a large dataset\nobtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculation have been developed\nrecently. This study gives both conceptual and practical bases for the high\naccuracy of MLIPs, although MLIPs have been considered to be simply an accurate\nblack-box description of atomic energy. We also construct the most accurate\nMLIP of the elemental Ti ever reported using a linearized MLIP framework and\nmany angular-dependent descriptors, which also corresponds to a generalization\nof the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential.\n", "  We report spontaneous appearance of antiferromagnetic order in a model gapped\nquantum paramagnet Ni(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_2$$\\cdot$4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ induced by a\nchange in bromine concentration x. This transition is qualitatively similar to\na z = 1 magnetic quantum critical point. However, the observed critical scaling\nof thermodynamic and magnetic properties has rather unusual critical exponents.\n", "  Multinucleon transfer processes in low-energy heavy ion reactions have\nattracted increasing interest in recent years aiming at production of new\nneutron-rich isotopes. Clearly, it is an imperative task to further develop\nunderstanding of underlying reaction mechanisms to lead experiments to success.\nIn this paper, from systematic time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations for the\n$^{238}$U+$^{124}$Sn reaction, it is demonstrated that transfer dynamics depend\nstrongly on the orientations of $^{238}$U, quantum shells, and collision\nenergies. Two important conclusions are obtained: (i) Experimentally observed\nmany-proton transfer from $^{238}$U to $^{124}$Sn can be explained by a\nmultinucleon transfer mechanism governed by enhanced neck evolution in tip\ncollisions; (ii) Novel reaction dynamics are observed in tip collisions at\nenergies substantially above the Coulomb barrier, where a number of nucleons\nare transferred from $^{124}$Sn to $^{238}$U, producing transuranium nuclei as\nprimary reaction products, that could be a means to synthesize superheavy\nnuclei. Both results indicate the importance of the neck (shape) evolution\ndynamics, which are sensitive to the orientations, shell effects and collision\nenergies, for exploring possible pathways to produce new unstable nuclei.\n", "  We study a $T=0$ quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic\nstate and a magnetically ordered state for a spin $S=1$ XXZ Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The transition is\ninduced by an easy plane single-ion anisotropy $D$. At the mean-field level,\nthe system undergoes a direct transition at a critical $D = D_c$ between a\nparamagnetic state at $D > D_c$ and an ordered state with broken U(1) symmetry\nat $D < D_c$. We show that beyond mean field the phase diagram is very\ndifferent and includes an intermediate, partially ordered chiral liquid phase.\nSpecifically, we find that inside the paramagnetic phase the Ising ($J_z$)\ncomponent of the Heisenberg exchange binds magnons into a two-particle bound\nstate with zero total momentum and spin. This bound state condenses at $D >\nD_c$, before single-particle excitations become unstable, and gives rise to a\nchiral liquid phase, which spontaneously breaks spatial inversion symmetry, but\nleaves the spin-rotational U(1) and time-reversal symmetries intact. This\nchiral liquid phase is characterized by a finite vector chirality without long\nrange dipolar magnetic order. In our analytical treatment, the chiral phase\nappears for arbitrarily small $J_z$ because the magnon-magnon attraction\nbecomes singular near the single-magnon condensation transition. This phase\nexists in a finite range of $D$ and transforms into the magnetically ordered\nstate at some $D<D_c$. We corroborate our analytic treatment with numerical\ndensity matrix renormalization group calculations.\n", "  High resolution spectroscopy, providing constraints on plasma motions and\ntemperatures, is a powerful means to investigate the structure of accretion\nstreams in CTTS. In particular, the accretion shock region, where the accreting\nmaterial is heated to temperatures of a few MK as it continues its inward bulk\nmotion, can be probed by X-ray spectroscopy. To attempt to detect for the first\ntime the motion of this X-ray-emitting post-shock material, we searched for a\nDoppler shift in the deep Chandra/HETGS observation of the CTTS TW Hya. This\ntest should unveil the nature of this X-ray emitting plasma component in CTTS,\nand constrain the accretion stream geometry. We searched for a Doppler shift in\nthe X-ray emission from TW Hya with two different methods, by measuring the\nposition of a selected sample of emission lines, and by fitting the whole TW\nHya X-ray spectrum, allowing the line-of-sight velocity to vary. We found that\nthe plasma at T~2-4 MK has a line-of-sight velocity of 38.3+/-5.1 km/s with\nrespect to the stellar photosphere. This result definitively confirms that this\nX-ray-emitting material originates in the post-shock region, at the base of the\naccretion stream, and not in coronal structures. The comparison of the observed\nvelocity along the line of sight, 38.3+/-5.1 km/s, with the inferred intrinsic\nvelocity of the post shock of TW Hya, v_post~110-120 km/s, indicates that the\nfootpoints of the accretion streams on TW Hya are located at low latitudes on\nthe stellar surface. Our results indicate that complex magnetic field\ngeometries, such as that of TW Hya, permit low-latitude accretion spots.\nMoreover, since on TW Hya the redshift of the soft X-ray emission is very\nsimilar to that of the narrow component of the CIV resonance doublet at 1550\nAng, as found by Ardila et al. (2013), then the plasma at 2-4 MK and that at\n0.1 MK likely originate in the same post-shock regions.\n", "  We extend the confined-isospin-density-dependent mass (CIDDM) model to\ninclude temperature dependence of the equivalent mass for quarks. Within the\nCIDDM model, we study the equation of state (EOS) for $\\beta$-equilibrium quark\nmatter, quark symmetry energy, quark symmetry free energy, and the properties\nof quark stars at finite temperature. We find that including the temperature\ndependence of the equivalent mass can significantly influence the properties of\nthe strange quark matter (SQM) as well as the quark symmetry energy, the quark\nsymmetry free energy, and the maximum mass of quark stars at finite\ntemperature. The mass-radius relations for different stages of the proto-quark\nstars (PQSs) along the star evolution are analyzed. Our results indicate that\nthe heating (cooling) process for PQSs will increase (decrease) the maximum\nmass within CIDDM model by including temperature dependence of the equivalent\nmass for quarks.\n", "  Magnetic activity strongly impacts stellar RVs and the search for small\nplanets. We showed previously that in the solar case it induces RV variations\nwith an amplitude over the cycle on the order of 8 m/s, with signals on short\nand long timescales. The major component is the inhibition of the convective\nblueshift due to plages. We explore a new approach to correct for this major\ncomponent of stellar radial velocities in the case of solar-type stars. The\nconvective blueshift depends on line depths; we use this property to develop a\nmethod that will characterize the amplitude of this effect and to correct for\nthis RV component. We build realistic RV time series corresponding to RVs\ncomputed using different sets of lines, including lines in different depth\nranges. We characterize the performance of the method used to reconstruct the\nsignal without the convective component and the detection limits derived from\nthe residuals. We identified a set of lines which, combined with a global set\nof lines, allows us to reconstruct the convective component with a good\nprecision and to correct for it. For the full temporal sampling, the power in\nthe range 100-500~d significantly decreased, by a factor of 100 for a RV noise\nbelow 30 cm/s. We also studied the impact of noise contributions other than the\nphoton noise, which lead to uncertainties on the RV computation, as well as the\nimpact of the temporal sampling. We found that these other sources of noise do\nnot greatly alter the quality of the correction, although they need a better\nnoise level to reach a similar performance level. A very good correction of the\nconvective component can be achieved providing very good RV noise levels\ncombined with a very good instrumental stability and realistic granulation\nnoise. Under the conditions considered in this paper, detection limits at 480~d\nlower than 1 MEarth could be achieved for RV noise below 15 cm/s.\n", "  We numerically study the two-dimensional, area preserving, web map. When the\nmap is governed by ergodic behavior, it is, as expected, correctly described by\nBoltzmann-Gibbs statistics, based on the additive entropic functional\n$S_{BG}[p(x)] = -k\\int dx\\,p(x) \\ln p(x)$. In contrast, possible ergodicity\nbreakdown and transitory sticky dynamical behavior drag the map into the realm\nof generalized $q$-statistics, based on the nonadditive entropic functional\n$S_q[p(x)]=k\\frac{1-\\int dx\\,[p(x)]^q}{q-1}$ ($q \\in {\\cal R}; S_1=S_{BG}$). We\nstatistically describe the system (probability distribution of the sum of\nsuccessive iterates, sensitivity to the initial condition, and entropy\nproduction per unit time) for typical values of the parameter that controls the\nergodicity of the map. For small (large) values of the external parameter $K$,\nwe observe $q$-Gaussian distributions with $q=1.935\\dots$ (Gaussian\ndistributions), like for the standard map. In contrast, for intermediate values\nof $K$, we observe a different scenario, due to the fractal structure of the\ntrajectories embedded in the chaotic sea. Long-standing non-Gaussian\ndistributions are characterized in terms of the kurtosis and the box-counting\ndimension of chaotic sea.\n", "  Quantum Hall states can be characterized by their chiral edge modes. Upon\nsoftening the edge potential, the edge has long been known to undergo\nspontaneous reconstruction driven by charging effects. In this paper we\ndemonstrate a qualitatively distinct phenomenon driven by exchange effects, in\nwhich the ordering of the edge modes at $\\nu=3$ switches abruptly as the edge\npotential is made softer, while the ordering in the bulk remains intact. We\ndemonstrate that this phenomenon is robust, and has many verifiable\nexperimental signatures in transport.\n", "  We consider the dynamics in and near galaxy clusters. Gas, dark matter and\ngalaxies are presently falling into the clusters between approximately 1 and 5\nvirial radii. At very large distances, beyond 10 virial radii, all matter is\nfollowing the Hubble flow, and inside the virial radius the matter particles\nhave on average zero radial velocity. The cosmological parameters are imprinted\non the infall profile of the gas, however, no method exists, which allows a\nmeasurement of it. We consider the results of two cosmological simulations\n(using the numerical codes RAMSES and Gadget) and find that the gas and dark\nmatter radial velocities are very similar. We derive the relevant dynamical\nequations, in particular the generalized hydrostatic equilibrium equation,\nincluding both the expansion of the Universe and the cosmological background.\nThis generalized gas equation is the main new contribution of this paper. We\ncombine these generalized equations with the results of the numerical\nsimulations to estimate the contribution to the measured cluster masses from\nthe radial velocity: inside the virial radius it is negligible, and inside two\nvirial radii the effect is below 40%, in agreement the earlier analyses for DM.\nWe point out how the infall velocity in principle may be observable, by\nmeasuring the gas properties to distance of about two virial radii, however,\nthis is practically not possible today.\n", "  We present results for the ratios of mean ($M_B$), variance ($\\sigma_B^2$),\nskewness ($S_B)$ and kurtosis ($\\kappa_B$) of net baryon-number fluctuations\nobtained in lattice QCD calculations with a physical light to strange quark\nmass ratio. Using next-to-leading order Taylor expansions in baryon chemical\npotential we find that qualitative features of these ratios closely resemble\nthe corresponding experimentally measured cumulants ratios of net proton-number\nfluctuations for beam energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} \\ge 19.6$ GeV. We show\nthat the difference in cumulant ratios for the mean net baryon-number,\n$M_B/\\sigma_B^2=\\chi_1^B(T,\\mu_B)/\\chi_2^B(T,\\mu_B)$ and the normalized\nskewness, $S_B\\sigma_B=\\chi_3^B(T,\\mu_B)/\\chi_2^B(T,\\mu_B)$, naturally arises\nin QCD thermodynamics. Moreover, we establish a close relation between skewness\nand kurtosis ratios, $S_B\\sigma_B^3/M_B=\\chi_3^B(T,\\mu_B)/\\chi_1^B(T,\\mu_B)$\nand $\\kappa_B\\sigma_B^2=\\chi_4^B(T,\\mu_B)/\\chi_2^B(T,\\mu_B)$, valid at small\nvalues of the baryon chemical potential.\n", "  A hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole has been proposed as the candidate\ncentral engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The rich observations of GRBs by\n\\textit{Fermi} and \\textit{Swift} make it possible to constrain the central\nengine model by comparing the model predications against data. This paper is\ndedicated to studying the temporal evolution of central engine parameters for\nboth prompt emission and afterglow phases. We consider two jet launching\nmechanisms, i.e., $\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ annihilations and the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\nprocesse, and obtain analytical solutions to these two models. We then\ninvestigate the black hole central engine parameters, such as the jet power,\nthe dimensionless entropy $\\eta$, and the central engine parameter $\\mu_0=\\eta\n(1+\\sigma_0)$ (where $\\sigma_0$ is the initial magnetization of the engine) at\nthe base of the jet. The black hole may be spun up by accretion, or spun down\nby the BZ process, leaving imprints in GRB lightcurves. Usually, a BZ jet is\nmore powerful and is likely responsible for the late time central engine\nactivities. However, an initially non-spinning black hole central engine may\nfirst launch a thermal \"fireball\" via neutrino annihilations, and then launch a\nPoynting-flux-dominated jet via the BZ process. Multiple flares, giant bumps,\nand plateaus in GRB afterglows can be well produced as the result of late time\naccretion onto the black hole.\n", "  Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are of utmost importance in various\nscientific and industrial areas. They are the natural description of dynamical\nprocesses whose precise equations of motion are either not known or too\nexpensive to solve, e.g., when modeling Brownian motion. In some cases, the\nequations governing the dynamics of a physical system on macroscopic scales\noccur to be unknown since they typically cannot be deduced from general\nprinciples. In this work, we describe how the underlying laws of a stochastic\nprocess can be approximated by the spectral density of the corresponding\nprocess. Furthermore, we show how the density can be inferred from possibly\nvery noisy and incomplete measurements of the dynamical field. Generally,\ninverse problems like these can be tackled with the help of Information Field\nTheory (IFT). For now, we restrict to linear and autonomous processes. Though,\nthis is a non-conceptual limitation that may be omitted in future work. To\ndemonstrate its applicability we employ our reconstruction algorithm on a\ntime-series and spatio-temporal processes.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a driven-dissipative model of strongly\ninteracting photons in a nonlinear optical cavity in the presence of a\nsynthetic magnetic field. We show the possibility of using a\nfrequency-dependent incoherent pump to create a strongly-correlated $\\nu = 1/2$\nbosonic Laughlin state of light: thanks to the incompressibility of the\nLaughlin state, fluctuations in the total particle number and excitation of\nedge modes can be tamed by imposing a suitable external potential profile for\nphotons. We further propose angular momentum-selective spectroscopy of the\nemitted light as a tool to obtain unambiguous signatures of the microscopic\nphysics of the quantum Hall liquid of light.\n", "  The long-standing discrepancy between the experimental determination by the\nMuon $g-2$ Collaboration at Brookhaven and the Standard Model predictions for\nthe anomalous magnetic moment of the muon cannot be explained within simple\nunified framework like the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model,\nbut it can within its extension with vector-like fermions. In this paper we\nconsider a model with an additional vector-like $5+\\bar{5}$ pair of $SU(5)$.\nWithin this model we first identify its parameter space that is consistent with\nthe current discrepancy and show that this implies the lighter chargino mass in\nthe range of $700-1200$ GeV. We examine how it is affected by constraints from\nelectroweak sparticle search at the LHC based on 13 TeV search with 36.1\n${fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. We show that null trilepton signal searches\ncoming from chargino-neutralino pair production significantly constrains the\nallowed parameter space except when the chargino-neutralino mass difference is\nrelatively small, below about 10 GeV. Next we consider the expected impact of\nthe New Muon $g-2$ experiment at Fermilab with its projected sensitivity reach\nof $7\\,\\sigma$ and, assuming it confirms the current discrepancy, show that the\nremaining parameter space of the considered model will be in strong tension\nwith the current LHC limits.\n", "  We investigate systematically the bulk and surface electronic structure of\nthe candidate nodal-line semimetal CaAgAs by angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and density functional calculations. We observed a metallic,\nlinear, non-$k_z$-dispersive surface band that coincides with the\nhigh-binding-energy part of the theoretical topological surface state, proving\nthe topological nontriviality of the system. An overall downshift of the\nexperimental Fermi level points to a rigid-band-like $p$-doping of the samples,\ndue possibly to Ag vacancies in the as-grown crystals.\n", "  The NLO corrections to the DIS structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$ (or\nequivalently the photon-target cross sections $\\sigma^{\\gamma^*}_{T}$ and\n$\\sigma^{\\gamma^*}_{L}$) at low $x_{Bj}$ are obtained, as a generalization of\nthe dipole factorization formula. For the first time, the contributions of both\nthe $q\\bar{q}$ and the $q\\bar{q}g$ Fock states in the photon are directly\ncalculated, using earlier results for the $q\\bar{q}$ light-front wave-functions\nat one loop inside a dressed virtual photon. Both the $q\\bar{q}$ and the\n$q\\bar{q}g$ contributions have UV divergences, which are shown to cancel each\nother, using conventional dimensional regularization as UV regulator. Finally,\nthe resummation of high-energy logarithms on top of the NLO results for\n$\\sigma^{\\gamma^*}_{T}$ and $\\sigma^{\\gamma^*}_{L}$ is discussed.\n", "  The five-dimensional quadrupole collective model based on energy density\nfunctionals (EDF) has often been employed to treat long-range correlations\nassociated with shape fluctuations in nuclei. Our goal is to derive the\ncollective inertial functions in the collective Hamiltonian by the local\nquasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) that correctly takes into\naccount time-odd mean-field effects. Currently, practical framework to perform\nthe QRPA calculation with the modern EDFs on the $(\\beta,\\gamma)$ deformation\nspace is not available. Toward this goal, we develop an efficient numerical\nmethod to perform the QRPA calculation on the $(\\beta,\\gamma)$ deformation\nspace based on the Skyrme EDF. We use the finite amplitude method (FAM) for\nefficient calculation of QRPA strength functions for multipole external fields.\nWe construct a computational code of FAM-QRPA in the three-dimensional\nCartesian coordinate space to handle triaxially deformed superfluid nuclei. We\nvalidate our new code by comparing our results with former QRPA calculations\nfor axially symmetric nuclei. Isoscalar quadrupole strength functions in\ntriaxial superfluid nuclei, ${}^{110}$Ru and ${}^{190}$Pt, are obtained within\na reasonable computational cost. QRPA calculations for triaxially deformed\nsuperfluid nuclei based on the Skyrme EDF are achieved with the help of FAM.\nThis is an important step toward the microscopic calculation of collective\ninertial functions of the local QRPA.\n", "  We report a new search of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) using\nthe combined low background data sets in 2016 and 2017 from the PandaX-II\nexperiment in China. The latest data set contains a new exposure of 77.1 live\nday, with the background reduced to a level of 0.8$\\times10^{-3}$ evt/kg/day,\nimproved by a factor of 2.5 in comparison to the previous run in 2016. No\nexcess events were found above the expected background. With a total exposure\nof 5.4$\\times10^4$ kg day, the most stringent upper limit on spin-independent\nWIMP-nucleon cross section was set for a WIMP with mass larger than 100\nGeV/c$^2$, with the lowest exclusion at 8.6$\\times10^{-47}$ cm$^2$ at 40\nGeV/c$^2$.\n", "  We observed the galaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 with the Sardinia Radio\nTelescope to provide new constraints on its spectral properties at high\nfrequency. We conducted observations in three frequency bands centred at 1.4\nGHz, 6.6 GHz and 19 GHz, resulting in beam resolutions of 14$^{\\prime}$,\n2.9$^{\\prime}$ and 1$^{\\prime}$ respectively. These single-dish data were also\ncombined with archival interferometric observations at 1.4 and 1.7 GHz. From\nthe combined images, we measured a flux density of ${\\rm\nS_{1.4GHz}=(158.3\\pm9.6)\\,mJy}$ for the central radio halo and ${\\rm\nS_{1.4GHz}=(126\\pm8)\\,mJy}$ and ${\\rm S_{1.4GHz}=(11.7\\pm0.7)\\,mJy}$ for the\nnorthern and the southern relic respectively. After the spectral modelling of\nthe discrete sources, we measured at 6.6 GHz ${\\rm\nS_{6.6GHz}=(17.1\\pm1.2)\\,mJy}$ and ${\\rm S_{6.6GHz}=(0.6\\pm0.3)\\,mJy}$ for the\nnorthern and southern relic respectively. Assuming simple diffusive shock\nacceleration, we interpret measurements of the northern relic with a continuous\ninjection model represented by a broken power-law. This yields an injection\nspectral index ${\\rm \\alpha_{inj}=0.7\\pm0.1}$ and a Mach number ${\\rm\nM=3.3\\pm0.9}$, consistent with recent X-ray estimates. Unlike other studies of\nthe same object, no significant steepening of the relic radio emission is seen\nin data up to 8.35 GHz. By fitting the southern relic spectrum with a simple\npower-law (${\\rm S_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{-\\alpha}}$) we obtained a spectral index\n${\\rm \\alpha\\approx1.9}$ corresponding to a Mach number (${\\rm M\\approx1.8}$)\nin agreement with X-ray estimates. Finally, we evaluated the rotation measure\nof the northern relic at 6.6 GHz. These results provide new insights on the\nmagnetic structure of the relic, but further observations are needed to clarify\nthe nature of the observed Faraday rotation.\n", "  We study the transition between steady flows of non-cohesive granular\nmaterials in quasi-2D bounded heaps by suddenly changing the feed rate. In both\nexperiments and simulations, the primary feature of the transition is a wedge\nof flowing particles that propagates downstream over the rising free surface\nwith a wedge front velocity inversely proportional to the square root of time.\nAn additional longer duration transient process continues after the wedge front\nreaches the downstream wall. The entire transition is well modeled as a moving\nboundary problem with a diffusion-like equation derived from local mass balance\nand a local relation between the flux and the surface slope.\n", "  We derive semi-analytic solutions for optically thick, super-Eddington\nstellar winds, induced by an assumed steady energy addition $\\Delta {\\dot E}$\nconcentrated around a near-surface heating radius $R$ in a massive star of\ncentral luminosity $L_\\ast$. We show that obtaining steady wind solutions\nrequires both that the resulting total luminosity $L_o = L_\\ast + \\Delta {\\dot\nE}$ exceed the Eddington luminosity, $\\Gamma_o \\equiv L_o/L_{Edd} > 1$, and\nthat the induced mass loss rate be such that the \"photon-tiring\" parameter $m\n\\equiv {\\dot M} GM/R L_o \\le 1-1/\\Gamma_o$, ensuring the luminosity is\nsufficient to overcome the gravitational potential $GM/R$. Our analysis unifies\nprevious super-Eddington wind models that either: (1) assumed a direct\nradiative flux-driving without accounting for the advection of radiative\nenthalpy that can become important in such an optically thick flow; or (2)\nassumed that such super-Eddington outflows are adiabatic, neglecting the\neffects of the diffusive radiative flux. We show that these distinct models\nbecome applicable in the asymptotic limits of small vs. large values of $m\n\\Gamma_o $, respectively. By solving the coupled differential equations for\nradiative diffusion and wind momentum, we obtain general solutions that\neffectively bridge the behaviours of these limiting models. Two key scaling\nresults are for the terminal wind speed to escape speed, which is found to vary\nas $v_\\infty^2/v_{esc}^2 = \\Gamma_o/(1+m \\Gamma_o) -1$, and for the final\nobserved luminosity $L_{ obs}$, which for all allowed steady-solutions with $m\n< 1 - 1/\\Gamma_o$, exceeds the Eddington luminosity, $L_{obs} > L_{Edd}$. Our\nsuper-Eddington wind solutions have potential applicability for modeling phases\nof eruptive mass loss from massive stars, classical novae, and the remnants of\nstellar mergers.\n", "  We present late-time spectra of eight Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained at\n$>200$ days after peak brightness using the Gemini South and Keck telescopes.\nAll of the SNe Ia in our sample were nearby, well separated from their host\ngalaxy's light, and have early-time photometry and spectroscopy from the Las\nCumbres Observatory (LCO). Parameters are derived from the light curves and\nspectra such as peak brightness, decline rate, photospheric velocity, and the\nwidths and velocities of the forbidden nebular emission lines. We discuss the\nphysical interpretations of these parameters for the individual SNe Ia and the\nsample in general, including comparisons to well-observed SNe Ia from the\nliterature. There are possible correlations between early-time and late-time\nspectral features that may indicate an asymmetric explosion, so we discuss our\nsample of SNe within the context of models for an offset ignition and/or white\ndwarf collisions. A subset of our late-time spectra are uncontaminated by host\nemission, and we statistically evaluate our nondetections of H$\\alpha$ emission\nto limit the amount of hydrogen in these systems. Finally, we consider the\nlate-time evolution of the iron emission lines, finding that not all of our SNe\nfollow the established trend of a redward migration at $>200$ days after\nmaximum brightness.\n", "  We study the extinction properties of highly porous BCCA dust aggregates in a\nwide range of complex refractive indices ($1.4 \\le n \\le 2.0$, $0.001 \\le k \\le\n1.0$) and wavelength ($0.11\\mu m \\le \\lambda \\le 3.4\\mu m$). An attempt has\nbeen made for the first time to investigate the correlation among extinction\nefficiency ($Q_{ext}$), the composition of dust aggregates ($n, k$), the\nwavelength of radiation ($\\lambda$) and size parameter of the monomers ($x$).\nIf $k$ is fixed at any value between 0.001 and 1.0, $Q_{ext}$ increases with\nincrease of $n$ from 1.4 to 2.0. $Q_{ext}$ and $n$ are correlated via\n\\emph{linear} regression when the cluster size is small whereas the correlation\nis \\emph{quadratic} at moderate and higher sizes of the cluster. This feature\nis observed at all wavelengths (UV to optical to infrared). We also find that\nthe variation of $Q_{ext}$ with $n$ is very small when $\\lambda$ is high. When\n$n$ is fixed at any value between 1.4 and 2.0, it is observed that $Q_{ext}$\nand $k$ are correlated via polynomial regression equation (of degree 1, 2, 3 or\n4), where the degree of the equation depends on the cluster size, $n$ and\n$\\lambda$. The correlation is linear for small size and quadratic/cubic/quartic\nfor moderate and higher sizes. We have also found that $Q_{ext}$ and $x$ are\ncorrelated via a polynomial regression (of degree 3,4 or 5) for all values of\n$n$. The degree of regression is found to be $n$ and $k$-dependent. The set of\nrelations obtained from our work can be used to model interstellar extinction\nfor dust aggregates in a wide range of wavelengths and complex refractive\nindices.\n", "  We study the topological pump for a lattice fermion model mainly in three\nspatial dimensions. We first calculate the U(1) current density for the Dirac\nmodel defined in continuous space-time to review the known results as well as\nto introduce some technical details convenient for the calculations of the\nlattice model. We next investigate the U(1) current density for a lattice\nfermion model, a variant of the Wilson-Dirac model. The model we introduce is\ndefined on a lattice in space but in continuous time, which is suited for the\nstudy of the topological pump. For such a model, we derive the conserved U(1)\ncurrent density and calculate it directly for the $1+1$ dimensional system as\nwell as $3+1$ dimensional system in the limit of the small lattice constant. We\nfind that the current includes a nontrivial lattice effect characterized by the\nChern number, and therefore, the pumped particle number is quantized by the\ntopological reason. Finally we study the topological temporal pump in $3+1$\ndimensions by numerical calculations. We discuss the relationship between the\nsecond Chern number and the first Chern number, the bulk-edge correspondence,\nand the generalized Streda formula which enables us to compute the second Chern\nnumber using the spectral asymmetry.\n", "  The detection of exoplanets in coronographic images is severely limited by\nresidual starlight speckles. Dedicated post-processing can drastically reduce\nthis \"stellar leakage\" and thereby increase the faintness of detectable\nexoplanets. Based on a multi-spectral series expansion of the diffraction\npattern, we derive a multi-mode model of the residuals which can be exploited\nto estimate and thus remove the residual speckles in multi-spectral\ncoronographic images. Compared to other multi-spectral processing methods, our\nmodel is physically grounded and is suitable for use in an (optimal) inverse\napproach. We demonstrate the ability of our model to correctly estimate the\nspeckles in simulated data and demonstrate that very high contrasts can be\nachieved. We further apply our method to removing speckles from a real data\ncube obtained with the SPHERE IFS instrument.\n", "  Shift current transient are obtained for near band gap excitation of bulk\nGaAs by numerical solutions of the semiconductor Bloch equations in a basis\nobtained from a 14 band k.p model of the band structure. This approach provides\na transparent description of the optically induced excitations in terms of\ninterband, intersubband, and intraband excitations which enables a clear\ndistinction between different contributions to the shift current transients and\nfully includes resonant as well as off-resonant processes. Using a geodesic\ngrid in reciprocal space in our numerical solutions, we are able to include the\nelectron-hole Coulomb attraction in combination with our anisotropic\nthree-dimensional band structure. We obtain an excitonic absorption peak and an\nenhancement of the continuum absorption and demonstrate that the excitonic wave\nfunction contains a significant amount of anisotropy. Optical excitation at the\nexcitonic resonance generates shift current transients of significant strength,\nhowever, due to the electron-hole attraction the shift distance is smaller than\nfor above band gap excitation. We thus demonstrate that our approach is able to\nprovide important information on the ultrafast electron dynamics on the atomic\nscale.\n", "  We achieve an explicit construction of the lowest Landau level (LLL)\nprojected wave functions for composite fermions in the periodic (torus)\ngeometry. To this end, we first demonstrate how the vortex attachment of the\ncomposite fermion (CF) theory can be accomplished in the torus geometry to\nproduce the \"unprojected\" wave functions satisfying the correct\n(quasi-)periodic boundary conditions. We then consider two methods for\nprojecting these wave functions into the LLL. The direct projection produces\nvalid wave functions but can be implemented only for very small systems. The\nmore powerful and more useful projection method of Jain and Kamilla fails in\nthe torus geometry because it does not preserve the periodic boundary\nconditions and thus takes us out of the original Hilbert space. We have\nsucceeded in constructing a modified projection method that is consistent with\nboth the periodic boundary conditions and the general structure of the CF\ntheory. This method is valid for a large class of states of composite fermions,\ncalled \"proper states,\" which includes the incompressible ground states at\nelectron filling factors $\\nu=\\frac{n}{2pn+ 1}$, their charged and neutral\nexcitations, and also the quasidegenerate ground states at arbitrary filling\nfactors of the form $\\nu=\\frac{\\nu^*}{2p\\nu^*+ 1}$, where $n$ and $p$ are\nintegers and $\\nu^*$ is the CF filling factor. Comparison with exact results\nknown for small systems for the ground and excited states at filling factors\n$\\nu=1/3$, 2/5 and 3/7 demonstrates our LLL-projected wave functions to be\nextremely accurate representations of the actual Coulomb eigenstates. Our\nconstruction enables the study of large systems of composite fermions on the\ntorus, thereby opening the possibility of investigating numerous interesting\nquestions and phenomena.\n", "  Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) exceed the Eddington luminosity for a\n$\\approx 10M_\\odot$ black hole. The recent detection of black hole mergers by\nthe gravitational wave detector ALIGO indicates that black holes with masses $>\n10 M_\\odot$ do indeed exist. Motivated by this, we explore a scenario where\nULXs consist of black holes formed by the collapse of high-mass,\nlow-metallicity stars, and that these ULXs become binary black holes (BBHs)\nthat eventually merge. We use empirical relations between the number of ULXs\nand the star formation rate and host galaxy metallicity to estimate the ULX\nformation rate and the BBH merger rate at all redshifts. This assumes the ULX\nrate is directly proportional to the star formation rate for a given\nmetallicity, and that the black hole accretion rate is distributed as a\nlog-normal distribution. We include an enhancement in the ULX formation rate at\nearlier epochs due to lower mean metallicities. With simplified assumptions,\nour model is able to reproduce both the rate and mass distribution of BBH\nmergers in the nearby universe inferred from the detection of GW 150914, LVT\n151012, GW 151226, and GW 170104 by ALIGO if the peak accretion rate of ULXs is\na factor $\\approx$1 --- 300 greater than the Eddington rate. Our predictions of\nthe BBH merger rate, mass distribution, and redshift evolution can be tested by\nALIGO in the near future, which in turn can be used to explore connections\nbetween the ULX formation and BBH merger rates over cosmic time.\n", "  With few systems of technological interest having been studied as extensively\nas elemental silicon, there currently exists a wide disparity between the\nnumber of predicted low-energy silicon polymorphs and those, which have been\nexperimentally realized as metastable at ambient conditions. We put forward an\nexplanation for this disparity wherein the likelihood of formation of a given\npolymorph under near-equilibrium conditions can be estimated on the basis of\nmean field isothermal-isobaric (N, p, T) ensemble statistics. The probability\nthat a polymorph will be experimentally realized is shown to depend upon both\nthe hypervolume of that structure's potential energy basin of attraction and a\nBoltzmann factor weight containing the polymorph's potential enthalpy per\nparticle. Both attributes are calculated using density functional theory\nrelaxations of randomly generated initial structures. We find that the\nmetastable polymorphism displayed by silicon can be accounted for using this\nframework to the exclusion of a very large number of other low-energy\nstructures.\n", "  We present a comprehensive timing and spectral studies of Be/X-ray binary\npulsar EXO 2030+375 using extensive Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations\nfrom 1995 till 2011, covering numerous Type I and 2006 Type II outbursts. Pulse\nprofiles of the pulsar were found to be strongly luminosity dependent. At low\nluminosity, the pulse profile consisted of a main peak and a minor peak that\nevolved into a broad structure at high luminosity with a significant phase\nshift. A narrow and sharp absorption dip, also dependent on energy and\nluminosity, was detected in the pulse profile. Comparison of pulse profiles\nshowed that the features at a particular luminosity are independent of type of\nX-ray outbursts. This indicates that the emission geometry is solely a function\nof mass accretion rate. The broadband energy spectrum was described with a\npartial covering high energy cutoff model as well as a physical model based on\nthermal and bulk Comptonization in accretion column. We did not find any\nsignature of cyclotron resonance scattering feature in the spectra obtained\nfrom all the observations. A detailed analysis of spectral parameters showed\nthat, depending on source luminosity, the power-law photon index was\ndistributed in three distinct regions. It suggests the phases of spectral\ntransition from sub-critical to super-critical regimes in the pulsar as\nproposed theoretically. A region with constant photon index was also observed\nin ~(2-4) x 10^37 erg/s range, indicating critical luminosity regime in EXO\n2030+375.\n", "  We present high sensitivity HI observations of NGC 6822, obtained with the\nKaroo Array Telescope (KAT-7). We study the kinematics, the mass distribution,\nand the star formation thresholds. The KAT-7 short baselines and low system\ntemperature make it sensitive to large-scale, low surface brightness emission.\nThe observations detected $\\sim$ 23$\\%$ more flux than previous ATCA\nobservations. We fit a tilted ring model to the HI velocity field to derive the\nrotation curve (RC). The KAT-7 observations allow the measurement of the\nrotation curve of NGC 6822 out to 5.8 kpc, $\\sim$ 1 kpc further than existing\nmeasurements.\n  NGC 6822 is seen to be dark matter dominated at all radii. The\nobservationally motivated pseudo-isothermal dark matter (DM) halo model\nreproduces well the observed RC while the Navarro Frank-White DM model gives a\npoor fit to the data. We find the best fit mass to light ratio (M/L) of 0.12\n$\\pm$ 0.01 which is consistent with the literature. The Modified Newtonian\nDynamics (MOND) gives a poor fit to our data.\n  We derive the star formation threshold in NGC 6822 using the HI and H$\\alpha$\ndata. The critical gas densities were calculated for gravitational\ninstabilities using the Toomre-Q criterion and the cloud-growth criterion. We\nfound that in regions of star formation, the cloud-growth criterion explains\nstar formation better than the Toomre-Q criterion. This shows that the local\nshear rate could be a key player in cloud formation for irregular galaxies such\nas NGC 6822.\n", "  The young, fast-spinning, X-ray pulsar J0537-6910 displays an extreme glitch\nactivity, with large spin-ups interrupting its decelerating rotation every ~100\ndays. We present nearly 13 years of timing data from this pulsar, obtained with\nthe {\\it Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}. We discovered 22 new glitches and\nperformed a consistent analysis of all 45 glitches detected in the complete\ndata span. Our results corroborate the previously reported strong correlation\nbetween glitch spin-up size and the time to the next glitch, a relation that\nhas not been observed so far in any other pulsar. The spin evolution is\ndominated by the glitches, which occur at a rate ~3.5 per year, and the\npost-glitch recoveries, which prevail the entire inter-glitch intervals. This\ndistinctive behaviour provides invaluable insights into the physics of\nglitches. The observations can be explained with a multi-component model which\naccounts for the dynamics of the neutron superfluid present in the crust and\ncore of neutron stars. We place limits on the moment of inertia of the\ncomponent responsible for the spin-up and, ignoring differential rotation, the\nvelocity difference it can sustain with the crust. Contrary to its rapid\ndecrease between glitches, the spin-down rate increased over the 13 years, and\nwe find the long-term braking index $n_{\\rm l}=-1.22(4)$, the only negative\nbraking index seen in a young pulsar. We briefly discuss the plausible\ninterpretations of this result, which is in stark contrast to the predictions\nof standard models of pulsar spin-down.\n", "  The confining quark matter (CQM) model, in which the confinement and\nasymptotic freedom are modeled via the Richardson potential for quark-quark\nvector interaction and the chiral symmetry restoration at high density is\ndescribed by the density dependent quark mass, is extended to include isospin\ndependence of the quark mass. Within this extended isospin-dependent confining\nquark matter (ICQM) model, we study the properties of strange quark matter and\nquark stars. We find that including isospin dependence of the quark mass can\nsignificantly influence the quark matter symmetry energy, the stability of\nstrange quark matter and the mass-radius relation of quark stars. In\nparticular, we demonstrate although the recently discovered large mass pulsars\nPSR J1614.2230 and PSR J0348+0432 with masses around two times solar mass\n($2M_{\\odot}$) cannot be quark stars within the original CQM model, they can be\nwell described by quark stars in the ICQM model if the isospin dependence of\nquark mass is strong enough so that the quark matter symmetry energy is about\nfour times that of a free quark gas. We also discuss the effects of the density\ndependence of quark mass on the properties of quark stars. Our results indicate\nthat the heavy quark stars with mass around $2M_{\\odot}$ (if exist) can put\nstrong constraints on isospin and density dependence of the quark mass as well\nas the quark matter symmetry energy.\n", "  The Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST) is an 18,000 square meter\nradio telescope situated some 40 km from the city of Canberra, Australia. Its\noperating band (820-850 MHz) is now partly allocated to mobile phone\ncommunications, making radio astronomy challenging. We describe how the\ndeployment of new digital receivers (RX boxes), Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA) based filterbanks and server-class computers equipped with 43 GPUs\n(Graphics Processing Units) has transformed MOST into a versatile new\ninstrument (the UTMOST) for studying the dynamic radio sky on millisecond\ntimescales, ideal for work on pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The\nfilterbanks, servers and their high-speed, low-latency network form part of a\nhybrid solution to the observatory's signal processing requirements. The\nemphasis on software and commodity off-the-shelf hardware has enabled rapid\ndeployment through the re-use of proven 'software backends' for its signal\nprocessing. The new receivers have ten times the bandwidth of the original MOST\nand double the sampling of the line feed, which doubles the field of view. The\nUTMOST can simultaneously excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse\npulsars, and perform real-time searches of coherent fan beams for dispersed\nsingle pulses. Although system performance is still sub-optimal, a pulsar\ntiming and FRB search programme has commenced and the first UTMOST maps have\nbeen made. The telescope operates as a robotic facility, deciding how to\nefficiently target pulsars and how long to stay on source, via feedback from\nreal-time pulsar folding. The regular timing of over 300 pulsars has resulted\nin the discovery of 7 pulsar glitches and 3 FRBs. The UTMOST demonstrates that\nif sufficient signal processing can be applied to the voltage streams it is\npossible to perform innovative radio science in hostile radio frequency\nenvironments.\n", "  We examine systematically the (in)consistency between cosmological\nconstraints as obtained from various current data sets of the expansion\nhistory, Large Scale Structure (LSS), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nfrom Planck. We run (dis)concordance tests within each set and across the sets\nusing a recently introduced index of inconsistency (IOI) capable of dissecting\ninconsistencies between two or more data sets. First, we compare the\nconstraints on $H_0$ from five different methods and find that the IOI drops\nfrom 2.85 to 0.88 (on Jeffreys' scales) when the local $H_0$ measurements is\nremoved. This seems to indicate that the local measurement is an outlier, thus\nfavoring a systematics-based explanation. We find a moderate inconsistency\n(IOI=2.61) between Planck temperature and polarization. We find that current\nLSS data sets including WiggleZ, SDSS RSD, CFHTLenS, CMB lensing and SZ cluster\ncount, are consistent one with another and when all combined. However, we find\na persistent moderate inconsistency between Planck and individual or combined\nLSS probes. For Planck TT+lowTEB versus individual LSS probes, the IOI spans\nthe range 2.92--3.72 and increases to 3.44--4.20 when the polarization data is\nadded in. The joint LSS versus the combined Planck temperature and polarization\nhas an IOI of 2.83 in the most conservative case. But if Planck lowTEB is added\nto the joint LSS to constrain $\\tau$ and break degeneracies, the inconsistency\nbetween Planck and joint LSS data increases to the high-end of the moderate\nrange with IOI=4.81. Whether due to systematic effects in the data or to the\nunderlying model, these inconsistencies need to be resolved. Finally, we\nperform forecast calculations using LSST and find that the discordance between\nPlanck and future LSS data, if it persists as present, can rise up to a high\nIOI of 17, thus falling in the strong range of inconsistency. (Abridged).\n", "  We present results from an emission code that assumes millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs) to be sources of relativistic particles in globular clusters (GCs) and\nmodels the resulting spectral energy distribution (SED) of Galactic GCs due to\nthese particle's interaction with the cluster magnetic and soft-photon fields.\nWe solve a transport equation for leptons and calculate inverse Compton (IC)\nand synchrotron radiation (SR) to make predictions for the flux expected from\nGalactic GCs. We perform a parameter study and also constrain model parameters\nfor three GCs using gamma-ray and X-ray data. We next study the detectability\nof 16 Galactic GCs for the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), ranking them according to their predicted TeV\nflux. The spectrum of each cluster and therefore the detectability ranking is\nvery sensitive to the choice of parameters. We expect H.E.S.S. to detect two\nmore GCs (in addition to Terzan 5), i.e., 47 Tucanae and NGC 6388, if these\nclusters are observed for 100 hours. The five most promising GCs for CTA are\nNGC 6388, 47 Tucanae, Terzan 5, Djorg 2, and Terzan 10. We lastly expect CTA to\ndetect more than half of the known Galactic GCs population, depending on\nobservation time and model parameters.\n", "  We investigate the impact of local environment on the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction (SMF) spanning a wide range of galaxy densities from the field up to\ndense cores of massive galaxy clusters. Data are drawn from a sample of eight\nfields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments\n(ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of\ngalaxies down to 10^9 Msol. Taking advantage of >4000 secure spectroscopic\nredshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct\n3-dimensional density maps between 0.55<z<1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation\napproach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local\nenvironment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers\nof high- to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward\nimplication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency\nof (a) destroying lower-mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher-mass\ngalaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs\nof star-forming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the\nquiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMF of field\ngalaxies and that of denser environments we devise a simple semi-empirical\nmodel. The model begins with a sample of ~10^6 galaxies at z_start=5 with\nstellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then\nevolve down to z_final=0.8 following empirical prescriptions for\nstar-formation, quenching, and galaxy-galaxy merging. We run the simulation\nmultiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts\nof merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to\nreproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of\nthese mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e.g.\ngalaxy groups).\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments [Science 355, 6330 (2017); Nat. Nanotechnol.\n12, 430 (2017)], we present here an extensive theoretical analysis of the\nthermal conductance of atomic-size contacts made of three different metals,\nnamely gold (Au), platinum (Pt) and aluminum (Al).\n", "  Recent three-dimensional simulations have suggested that convective seed\nperturbations from shell burning can play an important role in triggering\nneutrino-driven supernova explosions. Since isolated simulations cannot\ndetermine whether this perturbation-aided mechanism is of general relevance\nacross the progenitor mass range, we here investigate the pertinent properties\nof convective oxygen and silicon burning shells in a broad range of\npresupernova stellar evolution models. We find that conditions for\nperturbation-aided explosions are most favourable in the extended oxygen shells\nof progenitors between about 16 and 26 solar masses, which exhibit large-scale\nconvective overturn with high convective Mach numbers. Although the highest\nconvective Mach numbers of up to 0.3 are reached in the oxygen shells of\nlow-mass progenitors, convection is typically dominated by small-scale modes in\nthese shells, which implies a more modest role of initial perturbations in the\nexplosion mechanism. Convective silicon burning rarely provides the high Mach\nnumbers and large-scale perturbations required for perturbation-aided\nexplosions. We also find that about $40\\%$ of progenitors between 16 and 26\nsolar masses exhibit simultaneous oxygen and neon burning in the same\nconvection zone as a result of a shell merger shortly before collapse.\n", "  Modelling the base of the solar convective envelope is a tedious problem.\nSince the first rotation inversions, solar modellers are confronted with the\nfact that a region of very limited extent has an enormous physical impact on\nthe Sun. Indeed, it is the transition region from differential to solid body\nrotation, the tachocline, which furthermore is influenced by turbulence and is\nalso supposed to be the seat of the solar magnetic dynamo. Moreover, solar\nmodels show significant disagreement with the sound speed profile in this\nregion. In this paper, we show how helioseismology can provide further\nconstraints on this region by carrying out an inversion of the Ledoux\ndiscriminant. We compare these inversions for Standard Solar Models built using\nvarious opacity tables and chemical abundances and discuss the origins of the\ndiscrepancies between Solar Models and the Sun.\n", "  Abridged: ATLASGAL is an unbiased 870 micron submillimetre survey of the\ninner Galactic plane. It provides a large and systematic inventory of all\nmassive, dense clumps in the Galaxy (>1000 Msun) and includes representative\nsamples of all embedded stages of high-mass star formation. Here we present the\nfirst detailed census of the properties (velocities, distances, luminosities\nand masses) and spatial distribution of a complete sample of ~8000 dense clumps\nlocated in the Galactic disk. We derive highly reliable velocities and\ndistances to ~97% of the sample and use mid- and far-infrared survey data to\ndevelop an evolutionary classification scheme that we apply to the whole\nsample. Comparing the evolutionary subsamples reveals trends for increasing\ndust temperatures, luminosities and line-widths as a function of evolution\nindicating that the feedback from the embedded proto-clusters is having a\nsignificant impact on the structure and dynamics of their natal clumps. We find\n88\\,per\\,cent are already associated with star formation at some level. We also\nfind the clump mass to be independent of evolution suggesting that the clumps\nform with the majority of their mass in-situ. We estimate the statistical\nlifetime of the quiescent stage to be ~5 x 10^4 yr for clump masses ~1000 Msun\ndecreasing to ~1 x 10^4 yr for clump masses >10000 Msun. We find a strong\ncorrelation between the fraction of clumps associated with massive stars and\npeak column density. The fraction is initially small at low column densities\nbut reaching 100\\,per\\,cent for column densities above 10^{23} cm^{-2}; there\nare no clumps with column density clumps above this value that are not already\nassociated with massive star formation. All of the evidence is consistent with\na dynamic view of star formation wherein the clumps form rapidly and are\ninitially very unstable so that star formation quickly ensues.\n", "  We present an analysis of 39 nuclei and their early-type hosts in the Virgo\nCluster using ten broadband filters: F300W, F475W, F850LP, F160W, $u^*griz$,\nand $K_s$. We describe the Virgo Redux program, which provides high-resolution\nUV and NIR imaging. Combining this data with optical and NIR imaging from the\nACS Virgo Cluster Survey and the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey, we\nestimate masses, metallicities and ages using simple stellar population (SSP)\nmodels. For 19 nuclei, we compare to SSP parameters derived from Keck and\nGemini spectra and find reasonable agreement between the photometric and\nspectroscopic metallicity: the RMS scatter is 0.3 dex. We reproduce the\nnucleus-galaxy mass fraction of $0.33^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ percent for galaxy\nstellar masses $10^{8.4}-10^{10.3} M_\\odot$ with a typical precision of\n$\\sim$35% for the nuclei masses. Based on available model predictions, there is\nno single preferred formation scenario for nuclei, suggesting that nuclei are\nformed stochastically through a mix of processes. Nuclei metallicities are\nstatistically identical to those of their hosts, appearing $0.07 \\pm 0.3$ dex\nmore metal-rich on average -- although, omitting galaxies with unusual origins,\nnuclei are $0.20\\pm0.28$ dex more metal-rich. Nuclei appear to be $0.56 \\pm\n0.12$ dex more metal rich than ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) at fixed\nmass. We find no clear age difference between nuclei and their galaxies, with\nnuclei displaying a broad range of ages. Interestingly, we find that the most\nmassive nuclei may be flatter and more closely aligned with the semi-major axes\nof their hosts, suggesting that they formed through predominantly dissipative\nprocesses.\n", "  The presence of an unseen `Planet 9' on the outskirts of the Solar system has\nbeen invoked to explain the unexpected clustering of the orbits of several\nEdgeworth--Kuiper Belt Objects. We use $N$-body simulations to investigate the\nprobability that Planet 9 was a free-floating planet (FFLOP) that was captured\nby the Sun in its birth star-formation environment. We find that only 1 - 6 per\ncent of FFLOPs are ensnared by stars, even with the most optimal initial\nconditions for capture in star-forming regions (one FFLOP per star, and highly\ncorrelated stellar velocities to facilitate capture). Depending on the initial\nconditions of the star-forming regions, only 5 - 10 of 10000 planets are\ncaptured onto orbits that lie within the constraints for Planet 9. When we\napply an additional environmental constraint for Solar system formation -\nnamely the injection of short-lived radioisotopes into the Sun's protoplanetary\ndisc from supernovae - we find that the probability for the capture of Planet 9\nto be almost zero.\n", "  We constrain the spatial gradient of star formation history within galaxies\nusing the colour gradients in NUV-u and u-i for a local spatially-resolved\ngalaxy sample. By splitting each galaxy into an inner and an outer part, we\nfind that most galaxies show negative gradients in these two colours. We first\nrule out dust extinction gradient and metallicity gradient as the dominant\nsource for the colour gradient. Then using stellar population models, we\nexplore variations in star formation history to explain the colour gradients.\nAs shown by our earlier work, a two-phase SFH consisting of an early secular\nevolution (growth) phase and a subsequent rapid evolution (quenching) phase is\nnecessary to explain the observed colour distributions among galaxies. We\nexplore two different inside-out growth models and two different inside-out\nquenching models by varying parameters of the SFH between inner and outer\nregions of galaxies. Two of the models can explain the observed range of colour\ngradients in NUV-u and u-i colours. We further distinguish them using an\nadditional constraint provided by the u-i colour gradient distribution, under\nthe assumption of constant galaxy formation rate and a common SFH followed by\nmost galaxies. We find the best model is an inside-out growth model in which\nthe inner region has a shorter e-folding time scale in the growth phase than\nthe outer region. More spatially resolved ultraviolet (UV) observations are\nneeded to improve the significance of the result.\n", "  Interacting many-body systems that are driven far away from equilibrium can\nexhibit phase transitions between dynamically emerging quantum phases, which\nmanifest as singularities in the Loschmidt echo. Whether and under which\nconditions such dynamical transitions occur in higher-dimensional systems with\nspontaneously broken continuous symmetries is largely elusive thus far. Here,\nwe study the dynamics of the Loschmidt echo in the three dimensional O(N) model\nfollowing a quantum quench from a symmetry breaking initial state. The O(N)\nmodel exhibits a dynamical transition in the asymptotic steady state,\nseparating two phases with a finite and vanishing order parameter, that is\nassociated with the broken symmetry. We analytically calculate the rate\nfunction of the Loschmidt echo and find that it exhibits periodic kink\nsingularities when this dynamical steady-state transition is crossed. The\nsingularities arise exactly at the zero-crossings of the oscillating order\nparameter. As a consequence, the appearance of the kink singularities in the\ntransient dynamics is directly linked to a dynamical transition in the order\nparameter. Furthermore, we argue, that our results for dynamical quantum phase\ntransitions in the O(N) model are general and apply to generic systems with\ncontinuous symmetry breaking.\n", "  We present low-temperature magnetotransport measurements on graphene rings\nencapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We investigate phase-coherent\ntransport and show Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in quasi-ballistic graphene\nrings with hard confinement. In particular, we report on the observation of\n$h/e$, $h/2e$ and $h/3e$ conductance oscillations. Moreover we show signatures\nof magnetic focusing effects at small magnetic fields confirming ballistic\ntransport. We perform tight binding calculations which allow to reproduce all\nsignificant features of our experimental findings and enable a deeper\nunderstanding of the underlying physics. Finally, we report on the observation\nof the AB conductance oscillations in the quantum Hall regime at reasonable\nhigh magnetic fields, where we find regions with enhanced AB oscillation\nvisibility with values up to $0.7$%. These oscillations are well explained by\ntaking disorder into account allowing for a coexistence of hard and soft-wall\nconfinement.\n", "  The decline of Mars' global magnetic field some 3.8-4.1 billion years ago is\nthought to reflect the demise of the dynamo that operated in its liquid core.\nThe dynamo was probably powered by planetary cooling and so its termination is\nintimately tied to the thermochemical evolution and present-day physical state\nof the Martian core. Bottom-up growth of a solid inner core, the\ncrystallization regime for Earth's core, has been found to produce a long-lived\ndynamo leading to the suggestion that the Martian core remains entirely liquid\nto this day. Motivated by the experimentally-determined increase in the Fe-S\nliquidus temperature with decreasing pressure at Martian core conditions, we\ninvestigate whether Mars' core could crystallize from the top down. We focus on\nthe \"iron snow\" regime, where newly-formed solid consists of pure Fe and is\ntherefore heavier than the liquid. We derive global energy and entropy\nequations that describe the long-timescale thermal and magnetic history of the\ncore from a general theory for two-phase, two-component liquid mixtures,\nassuming that the snow zone is in phase equilibrium and that all solid falls\nout of the layer and remelts at each timestep. Formation of snow zones occurs\nfor a wide range of interior and thermal properties and depends critically on\nthe initial sulfur concentration, x0. Release of gravitational energy and\nlatent heat during growth of the snow zone do not generate sufficient entropy\nto restart the dynamo unless the snow zone occupies at least 400 km of the\ncore. Snow zones can be 1.5-2 Gyrs old, though thermal stratification of the\nuppermost core, not included in our model, likely delays onset. Models that\nmatch the available magnetic and geodetic constraints have x0~10% and snow\nzones that occupy approximately the top 100 km of the present-day Martian core.\n", "  We present evidence for bimodal stellar age distribution of pseudobulges of\nS0 galaxies as probed by the $D_n(4000)$ index. We do not observe any\nbimodality in age distribution for pseudobulges in spiral galaxies. Our sample\nis flux limited and contains 2067 S0 and 2630 spiral galaxies drawn from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. We identify pseudobulges in S0 and spiral galaxies,\nbased on the position of the bulge on the Kormendy diagram and their central\nvelocity dispersion. Dividing the pseudobulges of S0 galaxies into those\ncontaining old and young stellar populations, we study the connection between\nglobal star formation and pseudobulge age on the $u-r$ color-mass diagram. We\nfind that most old pseudobulges are hosted by passive galaxies while majority\nof young bulges are hosted by galaxies which are star forming. Dividing our\nsample of S0 galaxies into early-type S0s and S0/a galaxies, we find that old\npseudobulges are mainly hosted by early-type S0 galaxies while most of the\npseudobulges in S0/a galaxies are young. We speculate that morphology plays a\nstrong role in quenching of star formation in the disc of these S0 galaxies,\nwhich stops the growth of pseudobulges, giving rise to old pseudobulges and the\nobserved age bimodality.\n", "  In regions where stars form, variations in density and temperature can cause\ngas to freeze-out onto dust grains forming ice mantles, which influences the\nchemical composition of a cloud. The aim of this paper is to understand in\ndetail the depletion (and desorption) of CO on (from) interstellar dust grains.\nExperimental simulations were performed under two different (astrophysically\nrelevant) conditions. In parallel, Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations were used to\nmimic the experimental conditions. In our experiments, CO molecules accrete\nonto water ice at temperatures below 27 K, with a deposition rate that does not\ndepend on the substrate temperature. During the warm-up phase, the desorption\nprocesses do exhibit subtle differences indicating the presence of weakly bound\nCO molecules, therefore highlighting a low diffusion efficiency. IR\nmeasurements following the ice thickness during the TPD confirm that diffusion\noccurs at temperatures close to the desorption. Applied to astrophysical\nconditions, in a pre-stellar core, the binding energies of CO molecules,\nranging between 300 K and 850 K, depend on the conditions at which CO has been\ndeposited. Because of this wide range of binding energies, the depletion of CO\nas a function of AV is much less important than initially thought. The weakly\nbound molecules, easily released into the gas phase through evaporation, change\nthe balance between accretion and desorption, which result in a larger\nabundance of CO at high extinctions. In addition, weakly bound CO molecules are\nalso be more mobile, and this could increase the reactivity within interstellar\nices.\n", "  We obtained Calar Alto identification spectra for six cataclysmic variable\ncandidates, and studied archival observations at a range of wavelengths. Two\nsources were too faint to allow for easy identification by their spectra, and\nthe other four are likely to be dwarf novae. No periodicity was detected for\nany of the sources on the basis of CRTS data.\n", "  We introduce gbpTrees: an algorithm for constructing merger trees from\ncosmological simulations, designed to identify and correct for pathological\ncases introduced by errors or ambiguities in the halo finding process. gbpTrees\nis built upon a halo matching method utilising pseudo-radial moments\nconstructed from radially-sorted particle ID lists (no other information is\nrequired) and a scheme for classifying merger tree pathologies from networks of\nmatches made to-and-from haloes across snapshots ranging forward-and-backward\nin time. Focusing on Subfind catalogs for this work, a sweep of parameters\ninfluencing our merger tree construction yields the optimal snapshot cadence\nand scanning range required for converged results. Pathologies proliferate when\nsnapshots are spaced by $\\lesssim{0.128}$ dynamical times; conveniently similar\nto that needed for convergence of semi-analytical modelling, as established by\nBenson etal Total merger counts are converged at the level of $\\sim{5}$% for\nfriends-of-friends (FoF) haloes of size $n_{\\rm p}\\gtrsim{75}$ across a factor\nof 512 in mass resolution, but substructure rates converge more slowly with\nmass resolution, reaching convergence of $\\sim{10}$% for $n_{\\rm\np}\\gtrsim{100}$ and particle mass $m_{\\rm p}{\\lesssim}10^{9}M_\\odot$. We\npresent analytic fits to FoF and substructure merger rates across nearly all\nobserved galactic history ($z{\\le}8.5$). While we find good agreement with the\nresults presented by Fakhouri etal for FoF haloes, a slightly flatter\ndependance on merger ratio and increased major merger rates are found, reducing\npreviously reported discrepancies with extended Press-Schechter estimates. When\nappropriately defined, substructure merger rates show a similar mass ratio\ndependance as FoF rates, but with stronger mass and redshift dependencies for\ntheir normalisation.\n", "  In the framework of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we study the formation and\nstability of effectively two-dimensional solitons in dipolar Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs), with dipole moments polarized at an arbitrary angle\n$\\theta$ relative to the direction normal to the system's plane. Using\nnumerical methods and the variational approximation, we demonstrate that\nunstable Townes solitons, created by the contact attractive interaction, may be\ncompletely stabilized (with an anisotropic shape) by the dipole-dipole\ninteraction (DDI), in interval $\\theta ^{\\text{cr}}<\\theta \\leq \\pi /2$. The\nstability boundary, $\\theta ^{\\text{cr}}$, weakly depends on the relative\nstrength of DDI, remaining close to the \"magic angle\", $\\theta_{m}=\\arccos\n\\left( 1/\\sqrt{3}\\right) $. The results suggest that DDIs provide a generic\nmechanism for the creation of stable BEC\\ solitons in higher dimensions.\n", "  Most protostars have luminosities that are fainter than expected from steady\naccretion over the protostellar lifetime. The solution to this problem may lie\nin episodic mass accretion -- prolonged periods of very low accretion\npunctuated by short bursts of rapid accretion. However, the timescale and\namplitude for variability at the protostellar phase is almost entirely\nunconstrained. In \"A JCMT/SCUBA-2 Transient Survey of Protostars in Nearby Star\nForming Regions\", we are monitoring monthly with SCUBA-2 the sub-mm emission in\neight fields within nearby (<500 pc) star forming regions to measure the\naccretion variability of protostars. The total survey area of ~1.6 sq.deg.\nincludes ~105 peaks with peaks brighter than 0.5 Jy/beam (43 associated with\nembedded protostars or disks) and 237 peaks of 0.125-0.5 Jy/beam (50 with\nembedded protostars or disks). Each field has enough bright peaks for flux\ncalibration relative to other peaks in the same field, which improves upon the\nnominal flux calibration uncertainties of sub-mm observations to reach a\nprecision of ~2-3% rms, and also provides quantified confidence in any measured\nvariability. The timescales and amplitudes of any sub-mm variation will then be\nconverted into variations in accretion rate and subsequently used to infer the\nphysical causes of the variability. This survey is the first dedicated survey\nfor sub-mm variability and complements other transient surveys at optical and\nnear-IR wavelengths, which are not sensitive to accretion variability of deeply\nembedded protostars.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of multiple wavelength observational data\nof the first GeV-selected narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy PMN J0948+0022. We\nderive its lightcurves in the \\gamma-ray and X-ray bands from the data observed\nwith Fermi/LAT and Swift/XRT, and make the optical and radio lightcurves by\ncollecting the data from the literature. These lightcurves show significant\nflux variations. With the LAT data we show that this source is analogue to\ntypical flat spectrum radio quasars in the $L_\\gamma-\\Gamma_\\gamma$ plane,\nwhere $L_\\gamma$ and $\\Gamma_\\gamma$ are the luminosity and spectral index in\nthe LAT energy band. The gamma-ray flux is correlated with the V-band flux with\na lag of ~44 days, and a moderate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a\nperiodicity of ~490 days observed in the LAT lightcurve. A similar QPO\nsignature is also found in the V-band lightcurve. The gamma-ray flux is not\ncorrelated with the radio flux in 15 GHz, and no similar QPO signature is found\nin a confidence level of 95%. Possible mechanisms of the QPO are discussed. We\npropose that gravitational wave observations in the future may clarify the\ncurrent plausible models for the QPO.\n", "  Although diamond photonics has driven considerable interest and useful\napplications, as shown in frequency generation devices and single photon\nemitters, fundamental studies on the third-order optical nonlinearities of\ndiamond are still scarce, stalling the development of an integrated platform\nfor nonlinear and quantum optics. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to\nthose studies by measuring the spectra of two-photon absorption coefficient\n($\\beta$) and the nonlinear index of refraction (n$_2$) of diamond using\nfemtosecond laser pulses, in a wide spectral range. These measurements show the\nmagnitude of $\\beta$ increasing from 0.07 to 0.23 cm/GW, as it approaches the\nbandgap energy, in the region from 3.18 to 4.77 eV (390 - 260 nm), whereas the\nn$_2$ varies from zero to 1.7E-19 m$^2$/W in the full measured range, from 0.83\n- 4.77 eV (1500 - 260 nm). The experimental results are compared with\ntheoretical models for nonlinear absorption and refraction in indirect gap\nsemiconductors, indicating the two-photon absorption as the dominant effect in\nthe dispersion of the third-order nonlinear susceptibility. These data,\ntogether with optical Kerr gate measurements, also provided here, are of\nforemost relevance to the understanding of ultrafast optical processes in\ndiamond and its nonlinear properties.\n", "  When coupling fermions to gravity, torsion is naturally induced. We consider\nthe possibility that fermion bilinears can act as a source for torsion,\naltering the dynamics of the early universe such that the big bang gets\nreplaced with a classical non-singular bounce. We extend previous studies in\nseveral ways: we allow more general fermion couplings, consider both commuting\nand anti-commuting spinors, and demonstrate that with an appropriate choice of\npotential one can easily obtain essentially arbitrary equations of state,\nincluding violations of the null energy condition, as required for a bounce. As\nan example, we construct a model of ekpyrotic contraction followed by a\nnon-singular bounce into an expanding phase. We analyze cosmological\nfluctuations in these models, and show that the perturbations can be rewritten\nin real fluid form. We find indications that spinor bounces are stable, and\nexhibit several solutions for the perturbations. Interestingly, spinor models\ndo not admit a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition, and consequently some types\nof scalar fluctuations can act as a source for gravitational waves already at\nlinear order. We also find that the first order dynamics are directionally\ndependent, an effect which might lead to distinguished observational\nsignatures.\n", "  Infrared, optical and ultraviolet spectropolarimetric observations have\nproven to be ideal tools for the study of the hidden nuclei of type-2 active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and for constraining the composition and morphology of\nthe sub-parsec scale emission components. In this paper, we extend the analysis\nto the polarization of the X-rays from type-2 AGN. Combining two radiative\ntransfer codes, we performed the first simulations of photons originating in\nthe gravity dominated vicinity of the black hole and scattering in structures\nall the way out to the parsec-scale torus and polar winds. We demonstrate that,\nwhen strong gravity effects are accounted for, the X-ray polarimetric signal of\nSeyfert-2s carries as much information about the central AGN components as\nspectropolarimetric observations of Seyfert-1s. The spectropolarimetric\nmeasurements can constrain the spin of the central supermassive black hole even\nin edge-on AGN, the hydrogen column density along the observer's line-of-sight,\nand the composition of the polar outflows. However, the polarization state of\nthe continuum source is washed out by multiple scattering, and should not be\nmeasurable unless the initial polarization is exceptionally strong. Finally, we\nestimate that modern X-ray polarimeters, either based on the photo-electric\neffect or on Compton scattering, will require long observational times on the\norder of a couple of mega-seconds to be able to properly measure the\npolarization of type-2 AGN.\n", "  We study galaxy shapes in the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamic simulation.\nWe find that massive galaxies have a higher probability of being prolate. For\ngalaxies with stellar mass larger than $10^{11}\\rm M_{\\odot}$, 35 out of total\n839 galaxies are prolate. For 21 galaxies with stellar mass larger than\n$10^{12}\\rm M_{\\odot}$, 9 are prolate, 4 are triaxial while the others are\nclose to being oblate. There are almost no prolate galaxies with stellar mass\nsmaller than $3\\times10^{11}\\rm M_{\\odot}$. We check the merger history of the\nprolate galaxies, and find that they are formed by major dry mergers. All the\nprolate galaxies have at least one such merger, with most having mass ratios\nbetween $1:1$ and $1:3$. The gas fraction (gas mass to total baryon mass) of\nthe progenitors is 0-3 percent for nearly all these mergers, except for one\nwhose second progenitor contains $\\sim 15\\%$ gas mass, while its main\nprogenitor still contains less than $5\\%$. For the 35 massive prolate galaxies\nthat we find, 18 of them have minor axis rotation, and their angular momenta\nmostly come from the spin angular momenta of the progenitors (usually that of\nthe main progenitor). We analyse the merger orbits of these prolate galaxies\nand find that most of them experienced a nearly radial merger orbit. Oblate\ngalaxies with major dry mergers can have either radial or circular merger\norbits. We further discuss various properties of these prolate galaxies, such\nas spin parameter $\\lambda_{\\rm R}$, spherical anisotropy parameter $\\beta$,\ndark matter fraction, as well as inner density slopes for the stellar, dark\nmatter and total mass distributions.\n", "  High-resolution observations from the sub-mm to the optical wavelength regime\nresolve the central few 100pc region of nearby galaxies in great detail. They\nreveal a large diversity of features: thick gas and stellar discs, nuclear\nstarbursts, in- and outflows, central activity, jet interaction, etc.\nConcentrating on the role circumnuclear discs play in the life cycles of\ngalactic nuclei, we employ 3D adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical\nsimulations with the RAMSES code to self-consistently trace the evolution from\na quasi-stable gas disc, undergoing gravitational (Toomre) instability, the\nformation of clumps and stars and the disc's subsequent, partial dispersal via\nstellar feedback. Our approach builds upon the observational finding that many\nnearby Seyfert galaxies have undergone intense nuclear starbursts in their\nrecent past and in many nearby sources star formation is concentrated in a\nhandful of clumps on a few 100pc distant from the galactic centre. We show that\nsuch observations can be understood as the result of gravitational\ninstabilities in dense circumnuclear discs. By comparing these simulations to\navailable integral field unit observations of a sample of nearby galactic\nnuclei, we find consistent gas and stellar masses, kinematics, star formation\nand outflow properties. Important ingredients in the simulations are the\nself-consistent treatment of star formation and the dynamical evolution of the\nstellar distribution as well as the modelling of a delay time distribution for\nthe supernova feedback. The knowledge of the resulting simulated density\nstructure and kinematics on pc scale is vital for understanding inflow and\nfeedback processes towards galactic scales.\n", "  We study effects of pinning on the dynamics of a vortex lattice in a type II\nsuperconductor in the strong-pinning situation and determine the\nforce--velocity (or current--voltage) characteristic combining analytical and\nnumerical methods. Our analysis deals with a small density $n_p$ of defects\nthat act with a large force $f_p$ on the vortices, thereby inducing bistable\nconfigurations that are a characteristic feature of strong pinning theory. We\ndetermine the velocity-dependent average pinning-force density $\\langle\nF_p(v)\\rangle$ and find that it changes on the velocity scale $v_p \\sim\nf_p/\\eta a_0^3$, where $\\eta$ is the viscosity of vortex motion and $a_0$ the\ndistance between vortices. In the small pin-density limit, this velocity is\nmuch larger than the typical flow velocity $v_c \\sim F_c/\\eta$ of the free\nvortex system at drives near the critical force-density $F_c = \\langle\nF_p(v=0)\\rangle \\propto n_p f_p$. As a result, we find a generic excess-force\ncharacteristic, a nearly linear force--velocity characteristic shifted by the\ncritical force-density $F_c$; the linear flux-flow regime is approached only at\nlarge drives. Our analysis provides a derivation of Coulomb's law of dry\nfriction for the case of strong vortex pinning.\n", "  We study the dark matter (DM) assembly in the central regions of massive\nearly-type galaxies up to $z\\sim 0.65$. We use a sample of $\\sim 3800$ massive\n($\\log M_{\\rm \\star}/M_{\\rm \\odot} > 11.2$) galaxies with photometry and\nstructural parameters from 156 sq. deg. of the Kilo Degree Survey, and\nspectroscopic redshifts and velocity dispersions from SDSS. We obtain central\ntotal-to-stellar mass ratios, $M_{\\rm dyn}/M_{\\rm \\star}$, and DM fractions, by\ndetermining dynamical masses, $M_{\\rm dyn}$, from Jeans modelling of SDSS\naperture velocity dispersions and stellar masses, $M_{\\rm \\star}$, from KiDS\ngalaxy colours. We first show how the central DM fraction correlates with\nstructural parameters, mass and density proxies, and demonstrate that most of\nthe local correlations are still observed up to $z \\sim 0.65$; at fixed $M_{\\rm\n\\star}$, local galaxies have larger DM fraction, on average, than their\ncounterparts at larger redshift. We also interpret these trends with a non\nuniversal Initial Mass Function (IMF), finding a strong evolution with\nredshift, which contrast independent observations and is at odds with the\neffect of galaxy mergers. For a fixed IMF, the galaxy assembly can be\nexplained, realistically, by mass and size accretion, which can be physically\nachieved by a series of minor mergers. We reproduce both the $R_{\\rm e}-M_{\\rm\n\\star}$ and $M_{\\rm dyn}/M_{\\rm \\star}-M_{\\rm \\star}$ evolution with stellar\nand dark mass changing at a different rate. This result suggests that the main\nprogenitor galaxy is merging with less massive systems, characterized by a\nsmaller $M_{\\rm dyn}/M_{\\rm \\star}$, consistently with results from halo\nabundance matching.\n", "  During the protostellar phase of stellar evolution, accretion onto the star\nis expected to be variable, but this suspected variability has been difficult\nto detect because protostars are deeply embedded. In this paper, we describe a\nsub-mm luminosity burst of the Class I protostar EC 53 in Serpens Main, the\nfirst variable found during our dedicated JCMT/SCUBA-2 monitoring program of\neight nearby star-forming regions. EC 53 remained quiescent for the first 6\nmonths of our survey, from February to August 2016. The sub-mm emission began\nto brighten in September 2016, reached a peak brightness of $1.5$ times the\nfaint state, and has been decaying slowly since February 2017. The change in\nsub-mm brightness is interpreted as dust heating in the envelope, generated by\na luminosity increase of the protostar of a factor of $\\ge 4$. The 850~$\\mu$m\nlightcurve resembles the historical $K$-band lightcurve, which varies by a\nfactor of $\\sim 6$ with a 543 period and is interpreted as accretion\nvariability excited by interactions between the accretion disk and a close\nbinary system. The predictable detections of accretion variability observed at\nboth near-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths make the system a unique test-bed,\nenabling us to capture the moment of the accretion burst and to study the\nconsequences of the outburst on the protostellar disk and envelope.\n", "  This work presents exact expressions for size distributions of\nweak/multilayer connected components in two generalisations of the\nconfiguration model: networks with directed edges and multiplex networks with\narbitrary number of layers. The expressions are computable in a polynomial\ntime, and, under some restrictions, are tractable from the asymptotic theory\npoint of view. If first partial moments of the degree distribution are finite,\nthe size distribution for two-layer connected components in multiplex networks\nexhibits exponent $-\\frac{3}{2}$ in the critical regime, whereas the size\ndistribution of weakly connected components in directed networks exhibits two\ncritical exponents, $-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{3}{2}$.\n", "  We present observed mid-infrared and optical colors and composite spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of type 1 (broad-line) and 2 (narrow-line) quasars\nselected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy. A significant\nfraction of powerful quasars are obscured by dust, and are difficult to detect\nin optical photometric or spectroscopic surveys. However these may be more\neasily identified on the basis of mid-infrared (MIR) colors and SEDs. Using\nsamples of SDSS type 1 type 2 matched in redshift and [OIII] luminosity, we\nproduce composite rest-frame 0.2-15 micron SEDs based on SDSS, UKIDSS, and\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) photometry and perform model fits\nusing simple galaxy and quasar SED templates. The SEDs of type 1 and 2 quasars\nare remarkably similar, with the differences explained primarily by the\nextinction of the quasar component in the type 2 systems. For both types of\nquasar, the flux of the AGN relative to the host galaxy increases with AGN\nluminosity (L_[OIII]) and redder observed MIR color, but we find only weak\ndependencies of the composite SEDs on mechanical jet power as determined\nthrough radio luminosity. We conclude that luminous quasars can be effectively\nselected using simple MIR color criteria similar to those identified previously\n(W1-W2 > 0.7 [Vega]), although these criteria miss many heavily obscured\nobjects. Obscured quasars can be further identified based on optical-IR colors\n(for example, (u-W3 [AB]) > 1.4(W1-W2 [Vega])+3.2). These results illustrate\nthe power of large statistical studies of obscured quasars selected on the\nbasis of mid-IR and optical photometry.\n", "  GANDALF is a new hydrodynamics and N-body dynamics code designed for\ninvestigating planet formation, star formation and star cluster problems.\nGANDALF is written in C++, parallelised with both OpenMP and MPI and contains a\npython library for analysis and visualisation. The code has been written with a\nfully object-oriented approach to easily allow user-defined implementations of\nphysics modules or other algorithms. The code currently contains\nimplementations of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, Meshless Finite-Volume and\ncollisional N-body schemes, but can easily be adapted to include additional\nparticle schemes. We present in this paper the details of its implementation,\nresults from the test suite, serial and parallel performance results and\ndiscuss the planned future development. The code is freely available as an open\nsource project on the code-hosting website github at\nhttps://github.com/gandalfcode/gandalf and is available under the GPLv2\nlicense.\n", "  Sunquakes are created by the hydrodynamic response of the lower atmosphere to\na sudden deposition of energy and momentum. In this study we investigate a\nsunquake that occurred in NOAA active region 11675 on 17 February 2013.\nObservations of the corona, chromosphere and photosphere are brought together\nfor the first time with a non-linear force-free model of the active region's\nmagnetic field in order to probe the magnetic environment in which the sunquake\nwas initiated. We find that the sunquake was associated with the\ndestabilization of a flux rope and an associated M-class GOES flare. Active\nregion 11675 was in its emergence phase at the time of the sunquake and\nphotospheric motions caused by the emergence heavily modified the flux rope and\nits associated quasi-separatrix layers, eventually triggering the flux rope's\ninstability. The flux rope was surrounded by an extended envelope of field\nlines rooted in a small area at the approximate position of the sunquake. We\nargue that the configuration of the envelope, by interacting with the expanding\nflux rope, created a \"magnetic lens\" that may have focussed energy in one\nparticular location the photosphere, creating the necessary conditions for the\ninitiation of the sunquake.\n", "  Observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) together with weak\nlensing measurements of the clustering of large scale cosmological structures\nand local measurements of the Hubble constant pose a challenge to the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. On one side CMB observations imply a Hubble\nconstant that is lower than local measurements and an amplitude of the lensing\nsignal that is higher than direct measurements from weak lensing surveys. We\ninvestigate a way of relieving these tensions by adding dark radiation tightly\ncoupled to an acoustic part of the dark matter sector and compare it to massive\nneutrino solutions. While these models offer a way of separately relieving the\nHubble and weak lensing tensions they are prevented from fully accommodating\nboth at the same time since the CMB requires additional cold dark matter when\nadding acoustic dark matter or massive neutrinos to preserve the same sharpness\nof the acoustic peaks which counteracts the desired growth suppression.\n", "  The Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI) carried out a blind survey for galaxy\nclusters via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect decrements between 2008 and 2011.\nThe first detection, known as AMI-CL J0300+2613, has been reobserved with AMI\nequipped with a new digital correlator with high dynamic range. The combination\nof the new AMI data and more recent high-resolution sub-mm and infra-red maps\nnow shows the feature in fact to be a ring of positive dust-correlated Galactic\nemission, which is likely to be anomalous microwave emission (AME). If so, this\nis the first completely blind detection of AME at arcminute scales.\n", "  The Minkowski vacuum state is expressed as an entangled state between the\nleft and right Rindler wedges when it is constructed on the Rindler vacuum. In\nthis paper, we further examine the entanglement structure and extend the\nexpression to the future (expanding) and past (shrinking) Kasner spacetimes.\nThis clarifies the origin of the quantum radiation produced by an Unruh--DeWitt\ndetector in uniformly accelerated motion in the four-dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime. We also investigate the two-dimensional massless case where the\nquantum radiation vanishes but the same entanglement structure exists.\n", "  We present an unsupervised machine learning technique that automatically\nsegments and labels galaxies in astronomical imaging surveys using only pixel\ndata. Distinct from previous unsupervised machine learning approaches used in\nastronomy we use no pre-selection or pre-filtering of target galaxy type to\nidentify galaxies that are similar. We demonstrate the technique on the HST\nFrontier Fields. By training the algorithm using galaxies from one field (Abell\n2744) and applying the result to another (MACS0416.1-2403), we show how the\nalgorithm can cleanly separate early and late type galaxies without any form of\npre-directed training for what an 'early' or 'late' type galaxy is. We then\napply the technique to the HST CANDELS fields, creating a catalogue of\napproximately 60,000 classifications. We show how the automatic classification\ngroups galaxies of similar morphological (and photometric) type, and make the\nclassifications public via a catalogue, a visual catalogue and galaxy\nsimilarity search. We compare the CANDELS machine-based classifications to\nhuman-based classifications from the Galaxy Zoo: CANDELS project. Although\nthere is not a direct mapping between Galaxy Zoo and our hierarchical\nlabelling, we demonstrate a good level of concordance between human and machine\nclassifications. Finally, we show how the technique can be used to identify\nrarer objects and present new lensed galaxy candidates from the CANDELS\nimaging.\n", "  We investigated the physical properties of the comet-like objects 107P/(4015)\nWilson--Harrington (4015WH) and P/2006 HR30 (Siding Spring; HR30) by applying a\nsimple thermophysical model (TPM) to the near-infrared spectroscopy and\nbroadband observation data obtained by AKARI satellite of JAXA when they showed\nno detectable comet-like activity. We selected these two targets since the\ntendency of thermal inertia to decrease with the size of an asteroid, which has\nbeen demonstrated in recent studies, has not been confirmed for comet-like\nobjects. It was found that 4015WH, which was originally discovered as a comet\nbut has not shown comet-like activity since its discovery, has effective size $\nD= $ 3.74--4.39 km and geometric albedo $ p_V \\approx $ 0.040--0.055 with\nthermal inertia $ \\Gamma = $ 100--250 J m$ ^{-2} $ K$ ^{-1} $ s$ ^{-1/2}$. The\ncorresponding grain size is estimated to 1--3 mm. We also found that HR30,\nwhich was observed as a bare cometary nucleus at the time of our observation,\nhave $ D= $ 23.9--27.1 km and $ p_V= $0.035--0.045 with $ \\Gamma= $ 250--1,000\nJ m$ ^{-2} $ K$ ^{-1} $ s$ ^{-1/2}$. We conjecture the pole latitude $ -\n20^{\\circ} \\lesssim \\beta_s \\lesssim +60^{\\circ}$. The results for both targets\nare consistent with previous studies. Based on the results, we propose that\ncomet-like objects are not clearly distinguishable from asteroidal counterpart\non the $ D $--$ \\Gamma $ plane.\n", "  The Gaia Data Release 1 (GDR1) is a first, important step on the path of\nevolution of astrometric accuracy towards a much improved situation. Although\nasteroids are not present in GDR1, this intermediate release already impacts\nasteroid astrometry. Our goal is to investigate how the GDR1 can change the\napproach to a few typical problems, including the determination of orbits from\nshort-arc astrometry, the exploitation of stellar occultations, and the impact\nrisk assessment. We employ optimised asteroid orbit determination tools, and\nstudy the resulting orbit accuracy and post-fit residuals. For this goal, we\nuse selected ground-based asteroid astrometry, and occultation events observed\nin the past. All measurements are calibrated by using GDR1 stars. We show that,\nby adopting GDR1, very short measurement arcs can already provide interesting\norbital solutions, capable of correctly identifying Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs)\nand providing a much more accurate risk rating. We also demonstrate that\noccultations, previously used to derive asteroid size and shapes, now reach a\nnew level of accuracy at which they can be fruitfully used to obtain astrometry\nat the level of accuracy of Gaia star positions.\n", "  We study the properties of the central spheroids located within 10 kpc of the\ncentre of mass of Milky Way mass-sized galaxies simulated in a cosmological\ncontext. The simulated central regions are dominated by stars older than 10\nGyr, mostly formed in situ, with a contribution of ~30 per cent from accreted\nstars. These stars formed in well-defined starbursts, although accreted stars\nexhibit sharper and earlier ones. The fraction of accreted stars increases with\ngalactocentric distance, so that at a radius of ~8-10 kpc a fraction of ~40 per\ncent, on average, are detected. Accreted stars are slightly younger, lower\nmetallicity, and more $\\alpha$-enhanced than in situ stars. A significant\nfraction of old stars in the central regions come from a few ($2-3$) massive\nsatellites ($\\sim 10^{10}{\\rm M}_\\odot$). The bulge components receive larger\ncontributions of accreted stars formed in dwarfs smaller than $\\sim\n10^{9.5}{\\rm M}_\\odot$. The difference between the distributions of ages and\nmetallicities of old stars is thus linked to the accretion histories -- those\ncentral regions with a larger fraction of accreted stars are those with\ncontributions from more massive satellites. The kinematical properties of in\nsitu and accreted stars are consistent with the latter being supported by their\nvelocity dispersions, while the former exhibit clear signatures of rotational\nsupport. Our simulations demonstrate a range of characteristics, with some\nsystems exhibiting a co-existing bar and spheroid in their central regions,\nresembling in some respect the central region of the Milky Way.\n", "  We present Very Long Baseline Array polarimetric observations of the\ninnermost jet of 3C$\\sim$84 (NGC$\\sim$1275) at 43$\\sim$GHz. A significant\npolarized emission is detected at the hotspot of the innermost re-started jet,\nwhich is located $\\sim$1 pc south from the radio core. While the previous\nreport presented a hotspot at the southern end of the western limb, the hotspot\nlocation has been moved to the southern end of the eastern limb. Faraday\nrotation is detected within an entire bandwidth of the 43-GHz band. The\nmeasured rotation measure (RM) is at most\n(6.3$\\pm$1.9)$\\times10^{5}$$\\sim$rad$\\sim$m$^{-2}$ and might be slightly time\nvariable on the timescale of a month by a factor of a few. Our measured RM and\nthe RM previously reported by the CARMA and SMA observations cannot be\nconsistently explained by the spherical accretion flow with a power-law\nprofile. We propose that a clumpy/inhomogeneous ambient medium is responsible\nfor the observed rotation measure. Using equipartition magnetic field, we\nderive the electron density of $2\\times10^{4}$$\\sim$cm$^{-3}$. Such an electron\ndensity is consistent with the cloud of narrow line emission region around the\ncentral engine. We also discuss the magnetic field configuration from black\nhole scale to pc scale and the origin of low polarization.\n", "  We present new results from near-infrared spectroscopy with Keck/MOSFIRE of\n[OIII]-selected galaxies at $z\\sim3.2$. With our $H$ and $K$-band spectra, we\ninvestigate the interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, such as ionization states\nand gas metallicities. [OIII] emitters at $z\\sim3.2$ show a typical gas\nmetallicity of $\\mathrm{12+log(O/H) = 8.07\\pm0.07}$ at\n$\\mathrm{log(M_*/M_\\odot) \\sim 9.0-9.2}$ and $\\mathrm{12+log(O/H) =\n8.31\\pm0.04}$ at $\\mathrm{log(M_*/M_\\odot) \\sim 9.7-10.2}$ when using the\nempirical calibration method. We compare the [OIII] emitters at $z\\sim3.2$ with\nUV-selected galaxies and Ly$\\alpha$ emitters at the same epoch and find that\nthe [OIII]-based selection does not appear to show any systematic bias in the\nselection of star-forming galaxies. Moreover, comparing with star-forming\ngalaxies at $z\\sim2$ from literature, our samples show similar ionization\nparameters and gas metallicities as those obtained by the previous studies\nusing the same calibration method. We find no strong redshift evolution in the\nISM conditions between $z\\sim3.2$ and $z\\sim2$. Considering that the star\nformation rates at a fixed stellar mass also do not significantly change\nbetween the two epochs, our results support the idea that the stellar mass is\nthe primary quantity to describe the evolutionary stages of individual galaxies\nat $z>2$.\n", "  We investigate the pulsation properties of stellar models representative of\n$\\delta$ Scuti and $\\gamma$ Doradus variables. We have calculated a grid of\nstellar models from 1.2 to 2.2 M$_{\\odot}$, including the effects of both\nrotation and convective overshoot using MESA, and we investigate the pulsation\nproperties of these models using GYRE. We discuss observable patterns in the\nfrequency spacing for $p$ modes and the period spacings for g modes. Using the\nobservable patterns in g mode period spacings, it may be possible to\nobservationally constrain the convective overshoot and rotation of a model. We\nalso calculate the pulsation constant (Q) for all models in our grid, and\ninvestigate the variation with convective overshoot and rotation. The variation\nin Q values of radial modes can be used to place constraints on the convective\novershoot and rotation of stars in this region. As a test case, we apply this\nmethod to a sample of 22 high amplitude $\\delta$ Scuti stars (HADS), and\nprovide estimates for the convective overshoot of the sample.\n", "  Distance measurements beyond geometrical and semi-geometrical methods, rely\nmainly on standard candles. As the name suggests, these objects have known\nluminosities by virtue of their intrinsic proprieties and play a major role in\nour understanding of modern cosmology. The main caveats associated with\nstandard candles are their absolute calibration, contamination of the sample\nfrom other sources and systematic uncertainties. The absolute calibration\nmainly depends on their chemical composition and age. To understand the impact\nof these effects on the distance scale, it is essential to develop methods\nbased on different sample of standard candles. Here we review the fundamental\nproperties of young and intermediate-age distance indicators such as Cepheids,\nMira variables and Red Clump stars and the recent developments in their\napplication as distance indicators.\n", "  Context. The Evershed effect, a nearly horizontal outflow of material seen in\nthe penumbrae of sunspots in the photospheric layers, is a common\ncharacteristic of well-developed penumbrae, but is still not well understood.\nEven less is known about photospheric horizontal inflows in the penumbra, also\nknown as counter Evershed flows. Aims. Here we present a rare feature observed\nin the penumbra of the main sunspot of AR NOAA 10930. This spot displays the\nnormal Evershed outflow in most of the penumbra, but harbors a fast\nphotospheric inflow of material over a large sector of the disk-center\npenumbra. We investigate the driving forces of both, the normal and the counter\nEvershed flows. Methods. We invert the spectropolarimetric data from Hinode\nSOT/SP using the spatially coupled version of the SPINOR inversion code, which\nallows us to derive height-dependent maps of the relevant physical parameters\nin the sunspot. These maps show considerable fine structure. Similarities and\ndifferences between the normal Evershed outflow and the counter Evershed flow\nare investigated. Results. In both the normal and the counter Evershed flows,\nthe material flows from regions with field strengths of the order of 1.5-2 kG\nto regions with stronger fields. The sources and sinks of both penumbral flows\ndisplay opposite field polarities, with the sinks (tails of filaments)\nharboring local enhancements in temperature, which are nonetheless colder than\ntheir sources (heads of filaments). Conclusions. The anti-correlation of the\ngradients in the temperature and magnetic pressure between the endpoints of the\nfilaments from the two distinct penumbral regions is compatible with both the\nconvective driver and the siphon flow scenarios. A geometrical scale of the\nparameters is necessary to determine which is the dominant force driving the\nflows.\n", "  FU Orionis-type objects are young, low-mass stars with large outbursts in\nvisible light that last for several years or decades. They are thought to\nrepresent an evolutionary phase during the life of every young star when\naccretion from the circumstellar disk is enhanced during recurring time\nperiods. These outbursts are able to rapidly build up the star while affecting\nthe circumstellar disk and thus the ongoing or future planet formation. In many\nmodels infall from a circumstellar envelope seems to be necessary to trigger\nthe outbursts. We observed the J=1$-$0 rotational transition of $^{13}$CO and\nC$^{18}$O towards eight northern FU Orionis-type stars (V1057 Cyg, V1515 Cyg,\nV2492 Cyg, V2493 Cyg, V1735 Cyg, V733 Cep, RNO 1B and RNO 1C) and derive\ntemperatures and envelope masses and discuss the morphology and kinematics of\nthe circumstellar material. We detected extended CO emission associated with\nall our targets. Smaller scale CO clumps were found to be associated with five\nobjects with radii of 2000$-$5000 AU and masses of 0.02$-$0.5 $M_{\\odot}$;\nthese are clearly heated by the central stars. Three of these envelopes are\nalso strongly detected in the 2.7 mm continuum. No central CO clumps were\ndetected around V733 Cep and V710 Cas but there are many other clumps in their\nenvironments. Traces of outflow activity were observed towards V1735 Cyg, V733\nCep and V710 Cas. The diversity of the observed envelopes enables us to set up\nan evolutionary sequence between the objects. We find their evolutionary state\nto range from early, embedded Class I stage to late, Class II-type objects with\nvery low-mass circumstellar material. The results reinforce the idea of FU\nOrionis-type stars as representatives of a transitory stage between embedded\nClass I young stellar objects and classical T-Tauri stars.\n", "  Drastic changes in the early universe such as first-order phase transition\ncan produce a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. We investigate the\ntestability of a scale invariant extension of the standard model (SM) using the\nGW background produced by the chiral phase transition in a strongly interacting\nQCD-like hidden sector, which, via a SM singlet real scalar mediator, triggers\nthe electroweak phase transition. Using the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio method in a\nmean field approximation we estimate the GW signal and find that it can be\ntested by future space based detectors.\n", "  Both simulations and observations have confirmed that the spin of\nhaloes/galaxies is correlated with the large scale structure (LSS) with a mass\ndependence such that the spin of low-mass haloes/galaxies tend to be parallel\nwith the LSS, while that of massive haloes/galaxies tend to be perpendicular\nwith the LSS. It is still unclear how this mass dependence is built up over\ntime. We use N-body simulations to trace the evolution of the halo spin-LSS\ncorrelation and find that at early times the spin of all halo progenitors is\nparallel with the LSS. As time goes on, mass collapsing around massive halo is\nmore isotropic, especially the recent mass accretion along the slowest\ncollapsing direction is significant and it brings the halo spin to be\nperpendicular with the LSS. Adopting the $fractional$ $anisotropy$ (FA)\nparameter to describe the degree of anisotropy of the large-scale environment,\nwe find that the spin-LSS correlation is a strong function of the environment\nsuch that a higher FA (more anisotropic environment) leads to an aligned\nsignal, and a lower anisotropy leads to a misaligned signal. In general, our\nresults show that the spin-LSS correlation is a combined consequence of mass\nflow and halo growth within the cosmic web. Our predicted environmental\ndependence between spin and large-scale structure can be further tested using\ngalaxy surveys.\n", "  The dispersion measure (DM) of high-redshift $(z \\gtrsim 6)$ transient\nobjects such as Fast Radio Bursts can be a powerful tool to probe the\nintergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization. In this paper, we study\nthe variance of the DMs of objects with the same redshift as a potential probe\nof the size distribution of ionized bubbles. We calculate the DM variance with\na simple model with randomly-distributed spherical bubbles. It is found that\nthe DM variance reflects the characteristics of the probability distribution of\nthe bubble size. We find the variance can be measured precisely enough to\nobtain the information on the typical size with a few hundred sources at a\nsingle redshift.\n", "  We consider a large scale environment of turbulent reconnection that is\nfragmented into a number of randomly distributed Unstable Current Sheets (UCS),\nand we statistically analyze the acceleration of particles within this\nenvironment. We address two important cases of acceleration mechanisms when the\nparticles interact with the UCS: (a) electric field acceleration, and (b)\nacceleration through reflection at contracting islands. Electrons and ions are\naccelerated very efficiently, attaining an energy distribution of power-law\nshape with an index $1-2$, depending on the acceleration mechanism. The\ntransport coefficients in energy space are estimated from the test-particle\nsimulation data, and we show that the classical Fokker-Planck (FP) equation\nfails to reproduce the simulation results when the transport coefficients are\ninserted into it and it is solved numerically. The cause for this failure is\nthat the particles perform Levy flights in energy space, the distributions of\nenergy increments exhibit power-law tails. We then use the fractional transport\nequation (FTE) derived by Isliker et al., 2017, whose parameters and the order\nof the fractional derivatives are inferred from the simulation data, and,\nsolving the FTE numerically, we show that the FTE successfully reproduces the\nkinetic energy distribution of the test-particles. We discuss in detail the\nanalysis of the simulation data and the criteria that allow judging the\nappropriateness of either an FTE or a classical FP equation as a transport\nmodel.\n", "  We introduce a $\\textit{frequency-dependent}$ Doppler and aberration\ntransformation kernel for the harmonic multipoles of a general cosmological\nobservable with spin weight $s$, Doppler weight $d$ and arbitrary frequency\nspectrum. In the context of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies, the\nfrequency-dependent formalism allows to correct for the motion-induced\naberration and Doppler effects on individual frequency maps with different\nmasks. It also permits to deboost background radiations with non-blackbody\nfrequency spectra, like extragalactic foregrounds and CMB spectra with\nprimordial spectral distortions. The formalism can also be used to correct\nindividual E and B polarization modes and account for motion-induced E/B mixing\nof polarized observables with $d\\neq1$ at different frequencies.\n  We apply the generalized aberration kernel on polarized and unpolarized CMB\nspecific intensity at 100 and 217 GHz and show that the motion-induced effects\ntypically increase with the frequency of observation. In all-sky CMB\nexperiments, the frequency-dependence of the motion-induced effects for a\nblackbody spectrum are overall negligible. However in a cut-sky analysis,\nignoring the frequency dependence can lead to percent level error in the\npolarized and unpolarized power spectra over all angular scales. In the\nspecific cut-sky used in our analysis ($b > 45^\\circ, f_\\text{sky}\\simeq14\\%$),\nand for the dipole-inferred velocity $\\beta=0.00123$ typically attributed to\nour peculiar motion, the Doppler and aberration effects can change polarized\nand unpolarized power spectra of specific intensity in the CMB rest frame by\n$1-2\\%$, but we find the polarization cross-leakage between E and B modes to be\nnegligible.\n", "  We present near-infrared AMBER (R = 12, 000) and CRIRES (R = 100, 000)\nobservations of the Herbig B[e] star MWC297 in the hydrogen Br-gamma-line.\nUsing the VLTI unit telescopes, we obtained a uv-coverage suitable for aperture\nsynthesis imaging. We interpret our velocity-resolved images as well as the\nderived two-dimensional photocenter displacement vectors, and fit kinematic\nmodels to our visibility and phase data in order to constrain the gas velocity\nfield on sub-AU scales. The measured continuum visibilities constrain the\norientation of the near-infrared-emitting dust disk, where we determine that\nthe disk major axis is oriented along a position angle of 99.6 +/- 4.8 degrees.\nThe near-infrared continuum emission is 3.6 times more compact than the\nexpected dust-sublimation radius, possibly indicating the presence of highly\nrefractory dust grains or optically thick gas emission in the inner disk. Our\nvelocity-resolved channel maps and moment maps reveal the motion of the\nBr-gamma-emitting gas in six velocity channels, marking the first time that\nkinematic effects in the sub-AU inner regions of a protoplanetary disk could be\ndirectly imaged. We find a rotation-dominated velocity field, where the blue-\nand red-shifted emissions are displaced along a position angle of 24 +/- 3\ndegrees and the approaching part of the disk is offset west of the star. The\nvisibility drop in the line as well as the strong non-zero phase signals can be\nmodeled reasonably well assuming a Keplerian velocity field, although this\nmodel is not able to explain the 3 sigma difference that we measure between the\nposition angle of the line photocenters and the position angle of the dust\ndisk. We find that the fit can be improved by adding an outflowing component to\nthe velocity field, as inspired by a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind scenario.\n", "  Using a thin shell, the first law of thermodynamics, and a unified approach,\nwe study the thermodymanics and find the entropy of a (2+1)-dimensional\nextremal rotating Ba\\~{n}ados-Teitelbom-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The shell in\n(2+1) dimensions, i.e., a ring, is taken to be circularly symmetric and\nrotating, with the inner region being a ground state of the anti-de Sitter\n(AdS) spacetime and the outer region being the rotating BTZ spacetime. The\nextremal BTZ rotating black hole can be obtained in three different ways\ndepending on the way the shell approaches its own gravitational or horizon\nradius. These ways are explicitly worked out. The resulting three cases give\nthat the BTZ black hole entropy is either the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,\n$S=\\frac{A_+}{4G}$, or it is an arbitrary function of $A_+$, $S=S(A_+)$, where\n$A_+=2\\pi r_+$ is the area, i.e., the perimeter, of the event horizon in (2+1)\ndimensions. We speculate that the entropy of an extremal black hole should obey\n$0\\leq S(A_+)\\leq\\frac{A_+}{4G}$. We also show that the contributions from the\nvarious thermodynamic quantities, namely, the mass, the circular velocity, and\nthe temperature, for the entropy in all three cases are distinct. This study\ncomplements the previous studies in thin shell thermodynamics and entropy for\nBTZ black holes. It also corroborates the results found for a (3+1)-dimensional\nextremal electrically charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole.\n", "  We present results from a two-night R~4000 0.9-2.5 micron spectroscopic\nmonitoring campaign of Luhman 16AB (L7.5 + T0.5). We assess the variability\namplitude as a function of pressure level in the atmosphere of Luhman 16B: the\nmore variable of the two components. The amplitude decreases monotonically with\ndecreasing pressure, indicating that the source of variability - most likely\npatchy clouds - lies in the lower atmosphere. An unexpected result is that the\nstrength of the K I absorption is higher in the faint state of Luhman 16B and\nlower in the bright state. We conclude that either the abundance of K I\nincreases when the clouds roll in, potentially because of additional K I in the\ncloud itself, or that the temperature-pressure profile changes. We reproduce\nthe change in K I absorption strengths with combinations of spectral templates\nto represent the bright and the faint variability states. These are dominated\nby a warmer L8 or L9 component, with a smaller contribution from a cooler T1 or\nT2 component. The success of this approach argues that the mechanism\nresponsible for brown dwarf variability is also behind the diverse spectral\nmorphology across the L-to-T transition. We further suggest that the L9-T1 part\nof the sequence represents a narrow but random ordering of effective\ntemperatures and cloud fractions, obscured by the monotonic progression in\nmethane absorption strength.\n", "  The processes taking place in the outermost reaches of spiral disks (the\n'proto-disk') are intimately connected to the build-up of mass and angular\nmomentum in galaxies. The thinness of spiral disks suggests that the activity\nis mostly quiescent and presumably this region is fed by cool flows coming into\nthe halo from the intergalactic medium. While there is abundant evidence for\nthe presence of a circumgalactic medium (CGM) around disk galaxies as traced by\nquasar absorption lines, it has been very difficult to connect this material to\nthe outer gas disk. This has been a very difficult transition region to explore\nbecause baryon tracers are hard to observe. In particular, HI disks have been\nargued to truncate at a critical column density N(H) $\\approx 3\\times 10^{19}$\ncm$^{-2}$ at 30 kpc for an L* galaxy where the gas is vulnerable to the\nexternal ionizing background. But new deep observations of nearby L* spirals\n(e.g. Milky Way, NGC 2997) suggest that HI disks may extend much further than\nrecognised to date, up to 60 kpc at N(H) $\\approx 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$. Motivated\nby these observations, here we show that a clumpy outer disk of dense clouds or\ncloudlets is potentially detectable to much larger radii and lower HI column\ndensities than previously discussed. This extended proto-disk component is\nlikely to explain some of the MgII forest seen in quasar spectra as judged from\nabsorption-line column densities and kinematics. We fully anticipate that the\narmada of new radio facilities and planned HI surveys coming online will detect\nthis extreme outer disk (scree) material. We also propose a variant on the\nsuccessful 'Dragonfly' technique to go after the very weak H$\\alpha$ signals\nexpected in the proto-disk region.\n", "  Exoplanet discoveries over recent years have shown that terrestrial planets\nare exceptionally common. Many of these planets are in compact systems that\nresult in complex orbital dynamics. A key step toward determining the surface\nconditions of these planets is understanding the latitudinally dependent flux\nincident at the top of the atmosphere as a function of orbital phase. The two\nmain properties of a planet that influence the time-dependent nature of the\nflux are the obliquity and orbital eccentricity of the planet. We derive the\ncriterion for which the flux variation due to obliquity is equivalent to the\nflux variation due to orbital eccentricity. This equivalence is computed for\nboth the maximum and average flux scenarios, the latter of which includes the\neffects of the diurnal cycle. We apply these calculations to four known\nmulti-planet systems (GJ 163, K2-3, Kepler-186, and Proxima Centauri), where we\nconstrain the eccentricity of terrestrial planets using orbital dynamics\nconsiderations and model the effect of obliquity on incident flux. We discuss\nthe implications of these simulations on climate models for terrestrial planets\nand outline detectable signatures of planetary obliquity.\n", "  Superconducting quantum systems (artificial atoms) have been recently\nsuccessfully used to demonstrate on-chip effects of quantum optics with single\natoms in the microwave range. In particular, a well-known effect of four-wave\nmixing could reveal a series of features beyond classical physics, when a\nnon-linear medium is scaled down to a single quantum scatterer. Here we\ndemonstrate a phenomenon of the quantum wave mixing (QWM) on a single\nsuperconducting artificial atom. In the QWM, the spectrum of elastically\nscattered radiation is a direct map of the interacting superposed and coherent\nphotonic states. Moreover, the artificial atom visualises photon-state\nstatistics, distinguishing coherent, one- and two-photon superposed states with\nthe finite (quantized) number of peaks in the quantum regime. Our results may\ngive a new insight into nonlinear quantum effects in microwave optics with\nartificial atoms.\n", "  We investigate the nature of magnetic turbulent fluctuations, around ion\ncharacteristic scales, in a fast solar wind stream, by using {\\it Cluster}\ndata. Contrarily to slow solar wind, where both Alfv\\'enic ($\\delta b_{\\perp}\n\\gg \\delta b_{\\parallel}$) and compressive ($\\delta b_{\\parallel} \\gg \\delta\nb_{\\perp}$) coherent structures are observed \\cite[]{per16}, the turbulent\ncascade of fast solar wind is dominated by Alfv\\'enic structures, namely\nAlfv\\'en vortices, with small and/or finite compressive part, with the presence\nalso of several current sheets aligned with the local magnetic field. Several\nexamples of vortex chains are also recognized. Although an increase of magnetic\ncompressibility around ion scales is observed also for fast solar wind, no\nstrongly compressive structures are found, meaning that the nature of the slow\nand fast winds is intrinsically different. Multi-spacecraft analysis applied to\nthis interval of fast wind indicate that the coherent structures are almost\nconvected by the flow and aligned with the local magnetic field, i.e. their\nnormal is perpendicular to {\\bf B}, that is consistent with a two dimensional\nturbulence picture. Understanding intermittency and the related generation of\ncoherent structures could provide a key insight into the nonlinear energy\ntransfer and dissipation processes in magnetized and collisionless plasmas.\n", "  We present a simple method for identifying candidate white dwarf systems with\ndusty exoplanetary debris based on a single temperature blackbody model fit to\nthe infrared excess. We apply this technique to a sample of Southern Hemisphere\nwhite dwarfs from the recently completed Edinburgh-Cape Blue Object Survey and\nidentify four new promising dusty debris disk candidates. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our selection method by recovering three of the four\n$\\textit{Spitzer}$ confirmed dusty debris disk systems in our sample. Further\ninvestigation using archival high resolution imaging shows $\\textit{Spitzer}$\ndata of the un-recovered fourth object is likely contaminated by a\nline-of-sight object that either led to a mis-classification as a dusty disk in\nthe literature or is confounding our method. Finally, in our diagnostic plot we\nshow that dusty white dwarfs which also host gaseous debris lie along a\nboundary of our dusty debris disk region, providing clues to the origin and\nevolution of these especially interesting systems.\n", "  The heavy mass loss observed in evolved asymptotic giant branch stars is\nusually attributed to a two-step process: atmospheric levitation by\npulsation-induced shock waves, followed by radiative acceleration of newly\nformed dust grains. Detailed wind models suggest that the outflows of M-type\nAGB stars may be triggered by photon scattering on Fe-free silicates with grain\nsizes of about 0.1 - 1 $\\mu$m. Due to the low grain temperature, these Fe-free\nsilicates can condense close to the star, but they do not produce the\ncharacteristic mid-IR features that are often observed in M-type AGB stars.\nHowever, it is probable that the silicate grains are gradually enriched with Fe\nas they move away from the star, to a degree where the grain temperature stays\nbelow the sublimation temperature, but is high enough to produce emission\nfeatures. We investigate whether differences in grain temperature in the inner\nwind region, which are related to changes in the grain composition, can be\ndetected with current interferometric techniques, in order to put constraints\non the wind mechanism. To investigate this we use radial structures of the\natmosphere and wind of an M-type AGB star, produced with the 1D\nradiation-hydrodynamical code DARWIN. The spectral energy distribution is found\nto be a poor indicator of different temperature profiles and therefore is not a\ngood tool for distinguishing different scenarios of changing grain composition.\nHowever, spatially resolved interferometric observations have promising\npotential. They show signatures even for Fe-free silicates (found at 2-3\nstellar radii), in contrast to the spectral energy distribution. Observations\nwith baselines that probe spatial scales of about 4 stellar radii and beyond\nare suitable for tracing changes in grain composition, since this is where\neffects of Fe enrichment should be found.\n", "  We demonstrate ultra-sensitive measurement of fluctuations in a\nsurface-acoustic-wave~(SAW) resonator using a hybrid quantum system consisting\nof the SAW resonator, a microwave (MW) resonator and a superconducting qubit.\nThe nonlinearity of the driven qubit induces parametric coupling, which\nup-converts the excitation in the SAW resonator to that in the MW resonator.\nThermal fluctuations of the SAW resonator near the quantum limit are observed\nin the noise spectroscopy in the MW domain.\n", "  The method of discrete ordinates ($S_N$) is a popular choice for the solution\nof the neutron transport equation. It is however well known that it suffers\nfrom slow convergence of the scattering source in optically thick and diffusive\nmedia, such as pressurized water nuclear reactors (PWR). In reactor physics\napplications, the $S_N$ method is thus often accompanied by an acceleration\nalgorithm, such as the Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA). With the recent\nincrease in computational power, whole core transport calculations have become\na reasonable objective. It however requires using large computers and\nparallelizing the transport solver. Due to the elliptic nature of the DSA\noperator, its parallelization is not straightforward. In this paper, we present\nan acceleration operator derived from the DSA, but defined in a piecewise way\nsuch that its parallel implementation is straightforward. We show that, for\noptically thick enough media, this Piecewise Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration\n(PDSA) preserves the good properties of the DSA. This conclusion is supported\nby numerical experiments.\n", "  Near-infrared (IR) diffuse Galactic light (DGL) consists of scattered light\nand thermal emission from interstellar dust grains illuminated by interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF). At 1.25 and 2.2um, recent observational study shows\nthat intensity ratios of the DGL to interstellar 100um dust emission steeply\ndecrease toward high Galactic latitudes (b). In this paper, we investigate\norigin(s) of the b-dependence on the basis of models of thermal emission and\nscattered light. Combining a thermal emission model with regional variation of\nthe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon abundance observed with Planck, we show\nthat contribution of the near-IR thermal emission component to the observed DGL\nis less than ~20%. We also examine the b-dependence of the scattered light,\nassuming a plane-parallel Galaxy with smooth distributions of the ISRF and dust\ndensity along vertical direction, and assuming a scattering phase function\naccording to a recently developed model of interstellar dust. We normalize the\nscattered light intensity to the 100um intensity corrected for deviation from\nthe cosecant-b law according to the Planck observation. As the result, the\npresent model taking all the b-dependence of dust and ISRF properties can\naccount for the observed b-dependence of the near-IR DGL. However, uncertainty\nof the correction for the 100um emission is large and other normalizing\nquantities may be appropriate for more robust analysis of the DGL.\n", "  Opacities of molecules in exoplanet atmospheres rely on increasingly detailed\nline-lists for these molecules. The line lists available today contain for many\nspecies up to several billions of lines. Computation of the spectral line\nprofile created by pressure and temperature broadening, the Voigt profile, of\nall of these lines is becoming a computational challenge. We aim to create a\nmethod to compute the Voigt profile in a way that automatically focusses the\ncomputation time into the strongest lines, while still maintaining the\ncontinuum contribution of the high number of weaker lines. Here, we outline a\nstatistical line sampling technique that samples the Voigt profile quickly and\nwith high accuracy. The number of samples is adjusted to the strength of the\nline and the local spectral line density. This automatically provides high\naccuracy line shapes for strong lines or lines that are spectrally isolated.\nThe line sampling technique automatically preserves the integrated line opacity\nfor all lines, thereby also providing the continuum opacity created by the\nlarge number of weak lines at very low computational cost. The line sampling\ntechnique is tested for accuracy when computing line spectra and correlated-k\ntables. Extremely fast computations (~3.5e5 lines per second per core on a\nstandard current day desktop computer) with high accuracy (< 1 % almost\neverywhere) are obtained. A detailed recipe on how to perform the computations\nis given.\n", "  Membrane protein transporters alternate their substrate-binding sites between\nthe extracellular and cytosolic side of the membrane according to the\nalternating access mechanism. Inspired by this intriguing mechanism devised by\nnature, we study particle transport through a channel coupled with an energy\nwell that oscillates its position between the two entrances of the channel. We\noptimize particle transport across the channel by adjusting the oscillation\nfrequency. At the optimal oscillation frequency, the translocation rate through\nthe channel is a hundred times higher with respect to free diffusion across the\nchannel. Our findings reveal the effect of time dependent potentials on\nparticle transport across a channel and will be relevant for membrane transport\nand microfluidics application.\n", "  We report on the existence of stable, completely delocalized response regimes\nin a nonlinear defective periodic structure. In this state of complete\ndelocalization, despite the presence of the defect, the system exhibits\nin-phase oscillation of all units with the same amplitude. This elimination of\ndefect-borne localization may occur in both the free and forced responses of\nthe system. In the absence of external driving, the localized defect mode\nbecomes completely delocalized at a certain energy level. In the case of a\ndamped-driven system, complete delocalization may be realized if the driving\namplitude is beyond a certain threshold. We demonstrate this phenomenon\nnumerically in a linear periodic structure with one and two defective units\npossessing a nonlinear restoring force. We derive closed-form analytical\nexpressions for the onset of complete delocalization and discuss the necessary\nconditions for its occurrence.\n", "  In the core accretion model, gas-giant planets first form a solid core, which\nthen accretes gas from a protoplanetary disk when the core exceeds a critical\nmass. Here, we model the atmosphere of a core that grows by accreting ice-rich\npebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the\natmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower\naltitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective,\nfollowing a moist adiabat in saturated regions due to water condensation and\nprecipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core\nmass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock)\nbetween 0.08 and 0.16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and\n647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a\nsuper-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk. Typically, the\ncore mass reaches a maximum (the critical mass) as a function of the total mass\nwhen the core is 2-5 Earth masses. The critical mass depends in a complicated\nway on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional\nappearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50\npercent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas\naccretion. This mass is typically 1-3 Earth masses for pebbles that are 50\npercent ice by mass, increasing with opacity and pebble flux, and decreasing\nwith pebble ice/rock ratio.\n", "  Rotation-powered pulsars and magnetars are two different observational\nmanifestations of neutron stars: rotation powered pulsars are rapidly spinning\nobjects that are mostly observed as pulsating radio sources, while magnetars,\nneutron stars with the highest known magnetic fields, often emit short-duration\nX-ray bursts. Here we report simultaneous observations of the\nhigh-magnetic-field radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127 at X-ray, with XMM-Newton &\nNuSTAR, and at radio energies with Parkes radio telescope, during a period of\nmagnetar-like bursts. The rotationally powered radio emission shuts off\ncoincident with the occurrence of multiple X-ray bursts, and recovers on a time\nscale of ~70 seconds. These observations of related radio and X-ray phenomena\nfurther solidify the connection between radio pulsars and magnetars, and\nsuggest that the pair plasma produced in bursts can disrupt the acceleration\nmechanism of radio emitting particles.\n", "  We have studied the effect of cobalt substitution in\n$L1_{0}$-Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Pt films by means of x-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) and first-principles calculations. The magnetic moments of Fe\n($\\sim$2.5 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$) and Co ($\\sim$1.5 $\\mu_{\\rm B}$) deduced using XMCD\nwere almost unchanged upon Co doping, and the net magnetization decreases with\nincreasing Co content. Calculation also showed that the 3$d$ electrons that\nhave been added by Co substitution occupy only spin-down bands.\n", "  The X-ray line diagnostic method is a powerful tool for an investigation of\nplasma around accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. We point out an apparent\nintensity modulation of emission lines with their rotation period of neutron\nstars, due to the finite speed of light (we call this effect \"finite light\nspeed effect\"), if the line emission mechanism is a kind of reprocessing, such\nas fluorescence or recombination after ionization by X-ray irradiation from\npulsars. The modulation amplitude is determined by the size of the emission\nregion, in competition with the smearing effect by the light crossing time in\nthe emission region. This is efficient if the size of the emission region is\nroughly comparable to that of the rotation period multiplied by the speed of\nlight. We apply this effect to a symbiotic X-ray pulsar, GX 1+4, a spin\nmodulation of the intense iron line of which has been reported. The finite\nlight speed effect can explain the observed intensity modulation, if its\nfluorescent region has a size of $\\sim 10^{12}$ cm.\n", "  We present an Environmental Control System (ECS) designed to achieve\nmilliKelvin (mK) level temperature stability for small-scale astronomical\ninstruments. This ECS is inexpensive and is primarily built from commercially\navailable components. The primary application for our ECS is the high-precision\nDoppler spectrometer MINERVA-Red, where the thermal variations of the optical\ncomponents within the instrument represent a major source of systematic error.\nWe demonstrate $\\pm 2$ mK temperature stability within a 0.5 m$^{3}$ Thermal\nEnclosure using resistive heaters in conjunction with a commercially available\nPID controller and off-the-shelf thermal sensors. The enclosure is maintained\nabove ambient temperature, enabling rapid cooling through heat dissipation into\nthe surrounding environment. We demonstrate peak-to-valley (PV) temperature\nstability of better than 5 mK within the MINERVA-Red vacuum chamber, which is\nlocated inside the Thermal Enclosure, despite large temperature swings in the\nambient laboratory environment. During periods of stable laboratory conditions,\nthe PV variations within the vacuum chamber are less than 3 mK. This\ntemperature stability is comparable to the best stability demonstrated for\nDoppler spectrometers currently achieving 1 m s$^{-1}$ radial velocity\nprecision. We discuss the challenges of using commercially available\nthermoelectrically cooled CCD cameras in a temperature-stabilized environment,\nand demonstrate that the effects of variable heat output from the CCD camera\nbody can be mitigated using PID-controlled chilled water systems. The ECS\npresented here could potentially provide the stable operating environment\nrequired for future compact, \"astro-photonic\" precise radial velocity (PRV)\nspectrometers to achieve high Doppler measurement precision with a modest\nbudget.\n", "  In this paper we further develop a model for the heating of coronal loops by\nAlfven wave turbulence (AWT). The Alfven waves are assumed to be launched from\na collection of kilogauss flux tubes in the photosphere at the two ends of the\nloop. Using a three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model for an\nactive-region loop, we investigate how the waves from neighboring flux tubes\ninteract in the chromosphere and corona. For a particular combination of model\nparameters we find that AWT can produce enough heat to maintain a peak\ntemperature of about 2.5 MK, somewhat lower than the temperatures of 3-4 MK\nobserved in the cores of active regions. The heating rates vary strongly in\nspace and time, but the simulated heating events have durations less than 1\nminute and are unlikely to reproduce the observed broad Differential Emission\nMeasure distributions of active regions. The simulated spectral line\nnon-thermal widths are predicted to be about 27 km/s, which is high compared to\nthe observed values. Therefore, the present AWT model does not satisfy the\nobservational constraints. An alternative \"magnetic braiding\" model is\nconsidered in which the coronal field lines are subject to slow random\nfootpoint motions, but we find that such long period motions produce much less\nheating than the shorter period waves launched within the flux tubes. We\ndiscuss several possibilities for resolving the problem of producing\nsufficiently hot loops in active regions.\n", "  Recent observations of Her X-1 with NuSTAR and INTEGRAL in 2016 have provided\nevidence that the 20-year decay of the cyclotron line energy found between 1996\nand 2015 has ended and that an inversion with a new increase, possibly similar\nto the one observed around 1990-1993, has started. We consider this a strong\nmotivation for further observations and for enhanced efforts to significantly\nimprove our theoretical understanding of the accretion process in binary X-ray\npulsars. We speculate about the physics behind the long-term decay and its\ninversion, a possible cyclic behavior, and correlations with other variable\nobservables.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of an online algorithm for independent component\nanalysis in the high-dimensional scaling limit. As the ambient dimension tends\nto infinity, and with proper time scaling, we show that the time-varying joint\nempirical measure of the target feature vector and the estimates provided by\nthe algorithm will converge weakly to a deterministic measured-valued process\nthat can be characterized as the unique solution of a nonlinear PDE. Numerical\nsolutions of this PDE, which involves two spatial variables and one time\nvariable, can be efficiently obtained. These solutions provide detailed\ninformation about the performance of the ICA algorithm, as many practical\nperformance metrics are functionals of the joint empirical measures. Numerical\nsimulations show that our asymptotic analysis is accurate even for moderate\ndimensions. In addition to providing a tool for understanding the performance\nof the algorithm, our PDE analysis also provides useful insight. In particular,\nin the high-dimensional limit, the original coupled dynamics associated with\nthe algorithm will be asymptotically \"decoupled\", with each coordinate\nindependently solving a 1-D effective minimization problem via stochastic\ngradient descent. Exploiting this insight to design new algorithms for\nachieving optimal trade-offs between computational and statistical efficiency\nmay prove an interesting line of future research.\n", "  One-dimensional spin-1/2 systems are well-known candidates to study the\nquantum correlations between particles. In the condensed matter physics,\nstudies often are restricted to the 1st neighbor particles. In this work, we\nconsider the 1D XXZ model in a transverse magnetic field (TF) which is not\nintegrable except at specific points. Analytical expressions for quantum\ncorrelations (entanglement and quantum discord) between spin pairs at any\ndistance are obtained for both zero and finite temperature, using an analytical\napproach proposed by Caux et al. [PRB 68, 134431 (2003)]. We compare the\nefficiency of the QD with respect to the entanglement in the detection of\ncritical points (CPs) as the neighboring spin pairs go farther than the next\nnearest neighbors. In the absence of the TF and at zero temperature, we show\nthat the QD for spin pairs farther than the 2nd neighbors is able to capture\nthe critical points while the pairwise entanglement is absent. In contrast to\nthe pairwise entanglement, two-site quantum discord is effectively long-range\nin the critical regimes where it decays algebraically with the distance between\npairs. We also show that the thermal quantum discord between neighbor spins\npossesses strong distinctive behavior at the critical point that can be seen at\nfinite temperature and, therefore, spotlights the critical point while the\nentanglement fails in this task.\n", "  CEMP-s stars are long-lived low-mass stars with a very low iron content as\nwell as overabundances of carbon and s-elements. Their peculiar chemical\npattern is often explained by pollution from a AGB star companion. Recent\nobservations have shown that most of the CEMP-s stars are in a binary system,\nproviding support to the AGB companion scenario. A few CEMP-s stars, however,\nappear to be single. We inspect four apparently single CEMP-s stars and discuss\nthe possibility that they formed from the ejecta of a previous-generation\nmassive star, referred to as the \"source\" star. In order to investigate this\nscenario, we computed low-metallicity massive star models with and without\nrotation and including complete s-process nucleosynthesis. We find that\nnon-rotating source stars cannot explain the observed abundance of any of the\nfour CEMP-s stars. Three out of the four CEMP-s stars can be explained by a\n$25$ $M_{\\odot}$ source star with $v_{\\rm ini} \\sim 500$ km s$^{-1}$\n(spinstar). The fourth CEMP-s star has a high Pb abundance that cannot be\nexplained by any of the models we computed. Since spinstars and AGB predict\ndifferent ranges of [O/Fe] and [ls/hs], these ratios could be an interesting\nway to further test these two scenarios.\n", "  This paper aims to explore some realistic configurations of anisotropic\nspherical structures in the background of metric $f(R)$ gravity, where $R$ is\nthe Ricci scalar. The solutions obtained by Krori and Barua are used to examine\nthe nature of particular compact stars with three different modified gravity\nmodels. The behavior of material variables is analyzed through plots and the\nphysical viability of compact stars is investigated through energy conditions.\nWe also discuss the behavior of different forces, equation of state parameter,\nmeasure of anisotropy and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in the modeling\nof stellar structures. The comparison from our graphical representations may\nprovide evidences for the realistic and viable $f(R)$ gravity models at both\ntheoretical and astrophysical scale.\n", "  The unprecedented optical and near-infrared lightcurves of the first\nelectromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source, GW170817, a binary\nneutron star merger, exhibited a strong evolution from blue to near-infrared (a\nso-called 'kilonova' or 'macronova'). The emerging near-infrared component is\nwidely attributed to the formation of r-process elements which provide the\nopacity to shift the blue light into the near infrared. An alternative scenario\nis that the light from the blue component gets extinguished by dust formed by\nthe kilonova and subsequently is re-emitted at near-infrared wavelengths. We\nhere test this hypothesis using the lightcurves of AT2017gfo, the kilonova\naccompanying GW170817. We find that of order 10$^{-5}$ $M_\\odot$ of carbon is\nrequired to reproduce the optical/near-infrared lightcurves as the kilonova\nfades. This putative dust cools from $\\sim$ 2000 K at $\\sim$ 4 d after the\nevent to $\\sim$ 1500 K over the course of the following week, thus requiring\ndust with a high condensation temperature, such as carbon. We contrast this\nwith the nucleosynthetic yields predicted by a range of kilonova wind models.\nThese suggest that at most 10$^{-9}$ $M_\\odot$ of carbon is formed. Moreover,\nthe decay in the inferred dust temperature is slower than that expected in\nkilonova models. We therefore conclude that in current models of the blue\ncomponent of the kilonova, the near-infrared component in the kilonova\naccompanying GW170817 is unlikely to be due to dust.\n", "  The Georgi-Machacek model is one of many beyond Standard Model scenarios with\nan extended scalar sector which can group under the custodial $\\rm SU(2)_C$\nsymmetry. There are 5-plet, 3-plet and singlet Higgs bosons under the\nclassification of such symmetry in addition to the Standard Model Higgs boson.\nIn this paper, we study the prospects for detecting the doubly-charged Higgs\nboson ($\\rm H_5^{\\pm\\pm}$) through the vector boson fusion production at the\nelectron-proton (ep) colliders. We concentrate on our analysis through\n$\\mu$-lepton pair production via pair of same-sign W bosons decay. The $\\rm\nH_5^{\\pm\\pm}$ discovery potentials at the ep colliders are presented.\n", "  Vinyl cyanide (C$_2$H$_3$CN) is theorized to form in Titan's atmosphere via\nhigh-altitude photochemistry and is of interest regarding the astrobiology of\ncold planetary surfaces due to its predicted ability to form cell membrane-like\nstructures (azotosomes) in liquid methane. In this work, we follow up on the\ninitial spectroscopic detection of C$_2$H$_3$CN on Titan by Palmer et al.\n(2017) with the detection of three new C$_2$H$_3$CN rotational emission lines\nat submillimeter frequencies. These new, high-resolution detections have\nallowed for the first spatial distribution mapping of C$_2$H$_3$CN on Titan. We\npresent simultaneous observations of C$_2$H$_5$CN, HC$_3$N, and CH$_3$CN\nemission, and obtain the first (tentative) detection of C$_3$H$_8$ (propane) at\nradio wavelengths. We present disk-averaged vertical abundance profiles,\ntwo-dimensional spatial maps, and latitudinal flux profiles for the observed\nnitriles. Similarly to HC$_3$N and C$_2$H$_5$CN, which are theorized to be\nshort-lived in Titan's atmosphere, C$_2$H$_3$CN is most abundant over the\nsouthern (winter) pole, whereas the longer-lived CH$_3$CN is more concentrated\nin the north. This abundance pattern is consistent with the combined effects of\nhigh-altitude photochemical production, poleward advection, and the subsequent\nreversal of Titan's atmospheric circulation system following the recent\ntransition from northern to southern winter. We confirm that C$_2$H$_3$CN and\nC$_2$H$_5$CN are most abundant at altitudes above 200 km. Using a 300 km step\nmodel, the average abundance of C$_2$H$_3$CN is found to be $3.03\\pm0.29$ ppb,\nwith a C$_2$H$_5$CN/C$_2$H$_3$CN abundance ratio of $2.43\\pm0.26$. Our HC$_3$N\nand CH$_3$CN spectra can be accurately modeled using abundance gradients above\nthe tropopause, with fractional scale-heights of $2.05\\pm0.16$ and\n$1.63\\pm0.02$, respectively.\n", "  Aims. We report the small temporal variation of the axial dipole moment near\nthe solar minimum and its application to the solar cycle prediction by the\nsurface flux transport (SFT) model. Methods. We measure the axial dipole moment\nusing the photospheric synoptic magnetogram observed by the Wilcox Solar\nObservatory (WSO), the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory Michelson\nDoppler Imager (MDI), and the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI). We also use the surface flux transport model for the\ninterpretation and prediction of the observed axial dipole moment. Results. We\nfind that the observed axial dipole moment becomes approximately constant\nduring the period of several years before each cycle minimum, which we call the\naxial dipole moment plateau. The cross-equatorial magnetic flux transport is\nfound to be small during the period, although the significant number of\nsunspots are still emerging. The results indicates that the newly emerged\nmagnetic flux does not contributes to the build up of the axial dipole moment\nnear the end of each cycle. This is confirmed by showing that the time\nvariation of the observed axial dipole moment agrees well with that predicted\nby the SFT model without introducing new emergence of magnetic flux. These\nresults allows us to predict the axial dipole moment in Cycle 24/25 minimum\nusing the SFT model without introducing new flux emergence. The predicted axial\ndipole moment of Cycle 24/25 minimum is 60--80 percent of Cycle 23/24 minimum,\nwhich suggests the amplitude of Cycle 25 even weaker than the current Cycle 24.\nConclusions. The plateau of the solar axial dipole moment is an important\nfeature for the longer prediction of the solar cycle based on the SFT model.\n", "  Solar active region (AR) 12673 produced 4 X-class, 27 M-class, and numerous\nlower class flares during its passage across the visible solar disk in\nSeptember 2017. Our study is to answer the questions why this AR was so\nflare-productive and how the X9.3 flare, the largest one of the last decade,\ntook place. We find that there was a sunspot in the initial several days, and\nthen two bipolar regions emerged nearby it successively. Due to the standing of\nthe pre-existing sunspot, the movement of the bipoles was blocked, while the\npre-existing sunspot maintained its quasi-circular shaped umbra only with the\ndisappearance of a part of penumbra. Thus, the bipolar patches were\nsignificantly distorted, and the opposite polarities formed two semi-circular\nshaped structures. After that, two sequences of new bipolar regions emerged\nwithin the narrow semi-circular zone, and the bipolar patches separated along\nthe curved channel. The new bipoles sheared and interacted with the previous\nones, forming a complex topological system, during which numerous flares\noccurred. At the highly sheared region, a great deal of free energy was\naccumulated. On September 6, one negative patch near the polarity inversion\nline began to rapidly rotate and shear with the surrounding positive fields,\nand consequently the X9.3 flare erupted. Our results reveal that the\nblock-induced complex structures built the flare-productive AR and the X9.3\nflare was triggered by an erupting filament due to the kink instability. To\nbetter illustrate this process, a block-induced eruption model is proposed for\nthe first time.\n", "  The double-tetrahedral chain in a longitudinal magnetic field, whose nodal\nlattice sites occupied by the localized Ising spins regularly alternate with\ntriangular plaquettes with the dynamics described by the Hubbard model, is\nrigorously investigated. It is demonstrated that the uniform change of electron\nconcentration controlled by the chemical potential in a combination with the\ncompetition between model parameters and the external magnetic field leads to\nthe formation of one chiral and seven non-chiral phases at the absolute zero\ntemperature. Rational plateaux at one-third and one-half of the saturation\nmagnetization can also be identified in the low-temperature magnetization\ncurves. On the other hand, the gradual electron doping results in eleven\ndifferent ground-state regions which distinguish from each other by the\nevolution of the electron distribution during this process. Several\ndoping-dependent magnetization plateaux are observed in the magnetization\nprocess as a result of the continuous change of electron content in the model.\n", "  One of the greatest challenges in interpreting the pulsations of rapidly\nrotating stars is mode identification, i.e. correctly matching theoretical\nmodes to observed pulsation frequencies. Indeed, the latest observations as\nwell as current theoretical results show the complexity of pulsation spectra in\nsuch stars, and the lack of easily recognisable patterns. In the present\ncontribution, the latest results on non-adiabatic effects in such pulsations\nare described, and we show how these come into play when identifying modes.\nThese calculations fully take into account the effects of rapid rotation,\nincluding centrifugal distortion, and are based on models from the ESTER\nproject, currently the only rapidly rotating models in which the energy\nconservation equation is satisfied, a prerequisite for calculating\nnon-adiabatic effects. Non-adiabatic effects determine which modes are excited\nand play a key role in the near-surface pulsation-induced temperature\nvariations which intervene in multi-colour amplitude ratios and phase\ndifferences, as well as line profile variations.\n", "  Arcuate infrared nebulae are ubiquitous throughout the Galactic Plane and are\ncandidates for partial shells, bubbles, or bowshocks produced by massive\nrunaway stars. We tabulate infrared photometry for 709 such objects using\nimages from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), Wide-Field Infrared Explorer\n(WISE), and Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). Of the 709 objects identified at\n24 or 22 microns, 422 are detected at the HSO 70 micron bandpass. Of these,\nonly 39 are detected at HSO 160 microns. The 70 micron peak surface\nbrightnesses are 0.5 to 2.5 Jy/square arcminute. Color temperatures calculated\nfrom the 24 micron to 70 micron ratios range from 80 K to 400 K. Color\ntemperatures from 70 micron to 160 micron ratios are systematically lower, 40 K\nto 200 K. Both of these temperature are, on average, 75% higher than the\nnominal temperatures derived by assuming that dust is in steady-state radiative\nequilibrium. This may be evidence of stellar wind bowshocks sweeping up and\nheating --- possibly fragmenting but not destroying --- interstellar dust.\nInfrared luminosity correlates with standoff distance, R_0, as predicted by\npublished hydrodynamical models. Infrared spectral energy distributions are\nconsistent with interstellar dust exposed to a either single radiant energy\ndensity, U=10^3 to 10^5 (in more than half of the objects) or a range of\nradiant energy densities U_min=25 to U_max=10^3 to 10^5 times the mean\ninterstellar value for the remainder. Hence, the central OB stars dominate the\nenergetics, making these enticing laboratories for testing dust models in\nconstrained radiation environments. SEDs are consistent with PAH fractions\nq_PAH <1% in most objects.\n", "  Using observed stellar mass functions out to $z=5$, we measure the main\nprogenitor stellar mass growth of descendant galaxies with masses of\n$\\log{M_{*}/M_{\\odot}}=11.5,11.0,10.5,10.0$ at $z\\sim0.1$ using an evolving\ncumulative number density selection. From these mass growth histories, we are\nable to measure the time at which half the total stellar mass of the descendant\ngalaxy was assembled, $t_{a}$, which, in order of decreasing mass corresponds\nto redshifts of $z_{a}=1.28, 0.92, 0.60$ and $0.51$. We compare this to the\nmedian light-weighted stellar age $t_{*}$ ($z_{*} = 2.08, 1.49, 0.82$ and\n$0.37$) of a sample of low redshift SDSS galaxies (from the literature) and\nfind the timescales are consistent with more massive galaxies forming a higher\nfraction of their stars ex-situ compared to lower mass descendants. We find\nthat both $t_{*}$ and $t_{a}$ strongly correlate with mass which is in contrast\nto what is found in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation which shows a flat\nrelationship between $t_{a}$ and $M_{*}$. However, the semi-analytic model of\n\\citet{henriques2015} is consistent with the observations in both $t_{a}$ and\n$t_{*}$ with $M_{*}$, showing the most recent semi-analytic models are better\nable to decouple the evolution of the baryons from the dark matter in\nlower-mass galaxies.\n", "  The young and magnetically active K dwarf Epsilon Eridani exhibits a\nchromospheric activity cycle of about 3 years. Previous reconstructions of its\nlarge-scale magnetic field show strong variations at yearly epochs. To\nunderstand how Epsilon Eridani's large-scale magnetic field geometry evolves\nover its activity cycle we focus on high cadence observations spanning 5 months\nat its activity minimum. Over this timespan we reconstruct 3 maps of Epsilon\nEridani's large-scale magnetic field using the tomographic technique of Zeeman\nDoppler Imaging. The results show that at the minimum of its cycle, Epsilon\nEridani's large-scale field is more complex than the simple dipolar structure\nof the Sun and 61 Cyg A at minimum. Additionally we observe a surprisingly\nrapid regeneration of a strong axisymmetric toroidal field as Epsilon Eridani\nemerges from its S-index activity minimum. Our results show that all stars do\nnot exhibit the same field geometry as the Sun and this will be an important\nconstraint for the dynamo models of active solar-type stars.\n", "  We present new HI observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array and\ndeep optical imaging from OmegaCam on the VLT Survey Telescope of NGC 1427A, an\narrow-shaped dwarf irregular galaxy located in the Fornax cluster. The data\nreveal a star-less HI tail that contains ~10% of the atomic gas of NGC 1427A as\nwell as extended stellar emission that shed new light on the recent history of\nthis galaxy. Rather than being the result of ram pressure induced\nstar-formation, as previously suggested in the literature, the disturbed\noptical appearance of NGC 1427A has tidal origins. The galaxy itself likely\nconsists of two individual objects in an advanced stage of merging. The HI tail\nmay be made of gas expelled to large radii during the same tidal interaction.\nIt is possible that some of this gas is subject to ram pressure, which would be\nconsidered a secondary effect and imply a northwest trajectory of NGC 1427A\nwithin the Fornax cluster.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the relation between thermodynamical\nirreversibility and dissipation on a superconducting Xmon qubit. This relation\nalso implies the second law and the Landauer principle on dissipation in the\nirreversible computations. In our experiment, the qubit is initialized to\nstates according to Gibbs distribution. Work injection and extraction processes\nare conducted through two kinds of unitary driving protocols, for both a\nforward process and its corresponding mirror reverses. Relative entropy and\nrelative Re'nyi entropy are employed to measure the asymmetry between paired\nforward and backward work injection or extraction processes. We show\nexperimentally that relative entropy and relative Re'nyi entropy measured\nirreversibility are related to the average of work dissipation and average of\nexponentiated work dissipation respectively. Our work provides solid\nexperimental support for the theory of quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the location of brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs) on the fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion, which is an\nempirical correlation between a BH X-ray and radio luminosity and mass\nsupported by theoretical models of accretion. The sample comprises 72 BCGs out\nto $z\\sim0.3$ and with reliable nuclear X-ray and radio luminosities. These are\nfound to correlate as $L_\\mathrm{X} \\propto L_\\mathrm{R}^{0.75 \\pm 0.08}$,\nfavoring an advection-dominated accretion flow as the origin of the X-ray\nemission. BCGs are found to be on average offset from the fundamental plane\nsuch that their BH masses seem to be underestimated by the\n$M_\\mathrm{BH}-M_\\mathrm{K}$ relation a factor $\\sim$10. The offset is not\nexplained by jet synchrotron cooling and is independent of emission process or\namount of cluster gas cooling. Those core-dominated BCGs are found to be more\nsignificantly offset than those with weak core radio emission. For BCGs to on\naverage follow the fundamental plane, a large fraction ($\\sim40\\%$) should have\nBH masses $> 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and thus host ultramassive BHs. The local\nBH-galaxy scaling relations would not hold for these extreme objects. The\npossible explanations for their formation, either via a two-phase process (the\nBH formed first, the galaxy grows later) or as descendants of high-z seed BHs,\nchallenge the current paradigm of a synchronized galaxy-BH growth.\n", "  Randomly rotating particles that have been isotropically labeled with rigidly\nlinked fluorophores will undergo non-isotropic (patchy) photobleaching under\nillumination due to the dipole coupling of fluorophores with light. For a\nrotational diffusion rate $D$ of the particle and a photobleaching timescale\n$\\tau$ of the fluorophores, the dynamics of this process are characterized by\nthe dimensionless combination $D \\tau$. We find significant interparticle\nfluctuations at intermediate $D \\tau$. These fluctuations vanish at both large\nand small $D \\tau$, or at small or large elapsed times $t$. Associated with\nthese fluctuations between particles, we also observe transient\nnon-monotonicities of the brightness of individual particles. These\nnon-monotonicities can be as much 20\\% of the original brightness. We show that\nthese novel photobleach-fluctuations dominate over variability of\nsingle-fluorophore orientation when there are at least $10^3$ fluorophores on\nindividual particles.\n", "  Lam suggested that the PMNS matrix (or at least some of its elements) can be\npredicted by embedding the residual symmetry of the leptonic mass terms into a\nbigger symmetry. We analyze the possibility that the residual symmetries\nconsist of involution generators only and explore how Lam's idea can be\nimplemented.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the enhancement of surface enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy (SERS) using hyperbolic stratified nanostructures and compare to\nmetal nanoresonators. The photon Green function of each nanostructure within\nits environment is first obtained from a semi-analytical modal theory, which is\nused in a quantum optics formalism of the molecule-nanostructure interaction to\nmodel the SERS spectrum. An intuitive methodology is presented for calculating\nthe single molecule enhancement factor (SMEF), which is also able to predict\nknown experimental SERS enhancement factors of an example gold nano-dimer. We\nelucidate the important figures-of-merit of the enhancement and explore these\nfor different designs. We find that the use of hyperbolic stratified materials\ncan enhance the photonic local density of states (LDOS) by close to 2 times in\ncomparison to pure metal nanostructures, when both designed to work at the same\noperating wavelengths. However, the increased LDOS is accompanied by higher\nelectric field concentration within the lossy hyperbolic material, which leads\nto increased quenching that serves to reduce the overall detected SERS\nenhancement in the far field. For nanoresonators with resonant localized\nsurface plasmon wavelengths in the near-infrared, the SMEF for the hyperbolic\nstratified nanostructure is approximately an order of magnitude lower than the\npure metal counterpart. Conversely, we show that by detecting the Raman signal\nusing a near-field probe, hyperbolic materials can provide an improvement in\nSERS enhancement compared to using pure metal nanostructures when the probe is\nsufficiently close (<50 nm) to the Raman active molecule at the plasmonic\nhotspot.\n", "  The K3 quantity, introduced in a context of the Leggett--Garg inequality\nviolation, is studied for the neutrino oscillations in matter with\nphenomenologically modelled dissipative environment. It is shown that the K3\nfunction acquires different values depending on whether neutrino is Dirac or\nMajorana particle, provided that there is a dissipative interaction between\nmatter and neutrinos. The difference occurs for various matter densities and\ncan serve as a potential quantifier verifying the neutrino nature. Moreover,\nworking within phenomenological model one can suggest the values of the matter\ndensity and dissipation for which the difference is the most visible. There\nexist also special conditions in which the violation of the Leggett--Garg\ninequality, to a different extent for both kinds of neutrino, is observed.\n", "  We study large time behavior of quantum walks (QW) with self-dependent coin.\nIn particular, we show scattering and derive the reproducing formula for\ninverse scattering in the weak nonlinear regime. The proof is based on\nspace-time estimate of (linear) QW such as Strichartz estimate. Such argument\nis standard in the study of nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations but it seems to\nbe the first time to be applied to QW. We also numerically study the dynamics\nof QW and observe soliton like solutions.\n", "  We present a new spectral fitting code, Firefly, for deriving the stellar\npopulation properties of stellar systems. Firefly is a chi-squared minimisation\nfitting code that fits combinations of single-burst stellar population models\nto spectroscopic data, following an iterative best-fitting process controlled\nby the Bayesian Information Criterion. No priors are applied, rather all\nsolutions within a statistical cut are retained with their weight. Moreover, no\nadditive or multiplicative polynomia are employed to adjust the spectral shape.\nThis fitting freedom is envisaged in order to map out the effect of intrinsic\nspectral energy distribution (SED) degeneracies, such as age, metallicity, dust\nreddening on galaxy properties, and to quantify the effect of varying input\nmodel components on such properties. Dust attenuation is included using a new\nprocedure, which was tested on Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) data in a\nprevious paper. The fitting method is extensively tested with a comprehensive\nsuite of mock galaxies, real galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and\nMilky Way globular clusters. We also assess the robustness of the derived\nproperties as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and adopted wavelength range.\nWe show that \\FF\\ is able to recover age, metallicity, stellar mass and even\nthe star formation history remarkably well down to a $S/N\\sim5$, for moderately\ndusty systems. Code and results are publicly available at\nwww.icg.port.ac.uk/firefly.\n", "  We report the results of optical spectroscopy of the blue supergiant Sk-69\n279 and its circular shell in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with the\nSouthern African Large Telescope (SALT). We classify Sk-69 279 as an O9.2 Iaf\nstar and analyse its spectrum by using the stellar atmosphere code CMFGEN,\nobtaining a stellar temperature of \\approx 30 kK, a luminosity of\nlog(L_*/Lsun)=5.54, a mass-loss rate of log(\\dot{M}/(Msun/yr))=-5.26, and a\nwind velocity of 800 km/s. We found also that Sk-69 279 possesses an extended\natmosphere with an effective temperature of \\approx 24 kK and that its surface\nhelium and nitrogen abundances are enhanced, respectively, by factors of\n\\approx 2 and 20--30. This suggests that either Sk-69 279 was initially a\n(single) fast-rotating (\\ga 400 km/s) star, which only recently evolved off the\nmain sequence, or that it is a product of close binary evolution. The long-slit\nspectroscopy of the shell around Sk-69 279 revealed that its nitrogen abundance\nis enhanced by the same factor as the stellar atmosphere, which implies that\nthe shell is composed mostly of the CNO processed material lost by the star.\nOur findings support previous propositions that some massive stars can produce\ncompact circumstellar shells and, presumably, appear as luminous blue variables\nwhile they are still on the main sequence or have only recently left it.\n", "  A method of synoptic map assimilation has been developed to study global\nrearrangements of open magnetic flux and formation of polar coronal holes\n(PCHs) in the current cycle. The analysis reveals ensembles of coronal holes\n(ECHs) which appear within unipolar magnetic regions associated with decaying\nactivity complexes (ACs). The cause-effect relations between them explain\nasynchronous PCH formation observed at the northern and southern hemispheres of\nthe Sun. Thus, the decay of large ACs, that were observed in 2014, led to\nformation of an extensive ECH, which then became the south PCH in mid-2015.\nIntricate structure of magnetic fields in the northern polar zone has impeded\nthe north PCH formation, despite the fact that the dominant polarity at the\nNorth Pole reversed two years earlier than at the South Pole. The north PCH\nformed only by mid-2016 as the result of gradual merger of high-latitudinal\nECHs associated with several decaying ACs.\n", "  In many cases, the stability of complex structures in colloidal systems is\nenhanced by a competition between different length scales. Inspired by recent\nexperiments on nanoparticles coated with polymers, we use Monte Carlo\nsimulations to explore the types of crystal structures that can form in a\nsimple hard-core square shoulder model which explicitly incorporates two\nfavored distances between the particles. To this end, we combine Monte\nCarlo-based crystal structure finding algorithms with free energies obtained\nusing a mean-field cell theory approach, and draw phase diagrams for two\ndifferent values of the square shoulder width as a function of the density and\ntemperature. Moreover, we map out the zero-temperature phase diagram for a\nbroad range of shoulder widths. Our results show the stability of a rich\nvariety of crystal phases, such as body-centered orthogonal (BCO) lattices, not\npreviously considered for the square shoulder model.\n", "  We present the first preliminary results for the semileptonic form factor\n$h_{A_1}(w=1)/\\rho_{A_j}$ at zero recoil for the $\\bar B \\rightarrow D^\\ast\n\\ell \\bar \\nu$ decay using lattice QCD with four flavors of sea quarks. We use\nthe HISQ staggered action for the light valence and sea quarks (the MILC HISQ\nconfigurations), and the Oktay-Kronfeld (OK) action for the heavy valence\nquarks.\n", "  We study the single-spin asymmetry, $A_N(t)$, arising from Coulomb-nuclear\ninterference (CNI) at small 4-momentum transfer squared, $-t=q^2$, aiming at\nexplanation of the recent data from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC on polarized\nproton-nucleus scattering, exposing a nontrivial $t$-dependence of $A_N$. We\nfound that the failure of previous theoretical attempts to explain these data,\nwas due to lack of absorptive corrections in the Coulomb amplitude of $pA$\nelastic scattering. Our prominent observation is that the main contribution to\n$A_N(t)$ comes from interference of the amplitudes of ultra-peripheral and\ncentral collisions.\n", "  The MiniCLEAN dark matter experiment will exploit a single-phase liquid-argon\ndetector instrumented with 92 photomultiplier tubes placed in the cryogen\ntemperature with 4-$\\pi$ coverage of a 500 kg (150 kg) target (fiducial) mass.\nThe detector design strategy emphasizes scalability to target masses of order\n10 tons or more. The detector is designed also for a liquid neon target that\nallows for an independent verification of signal and background and a test of\nthe expected dependence of the WIMP-nucleus interaction rate. For MiniCLEAN,\nPMT stability and calibration are essential. The \\textit{In-situ} optical\ncalibration will be able monitor the PMT stability and maintain the\ncalibration. In MiniCLEAN, we use a Light-Emitting Diode(LED)- based light\ninjection system to provide single photons for calibration, the calibration can\nbe performed in near real-time, providing a continuous monitor at the condition\nof the detector. The intrinsic $^{39}$Ar beta emitter provides another way to\ncalibrate the detector thanks to well defined properties and uniformly\ndistributed inside the detector volume. The energy scale can be determined by\nfitting the energy spectrum of experimental $^{39}$Ar data. Moreover, the\npreliminary results from cold gas run shows the best measurement on triplet\nlifetime ($\\sim$ 3.5 $\\mu$ s). The results confirms the high purity of argon is\nattained by MiniCLEAN's purification system. The long triplet lifetime in\ngaseous argon can be exploit to obtain better performance of pulse shape\ndiscrimination (PSD) for future dark matter detector, also the low density of\ngaseous argon reduced the multi-scattering neutron backgrounds. On the other\nhand, by injecting $^{39}$Ar spike, the electronic recoil events due to\n$^{39}$Ar beta decay can be used to test the limit of PSD in liquid argon. The\nresults will be informative for future multi-tonne LAr detector.\n", "  Precision studies of top quark properties provide a unique playground to test\nthe predictions of the standard model and to search for new physics. Reviewed\nresults from the CMS experiment done with the data collected at 8 TeV include\nstudies of top quark Wtb anomalous and FCNC couplings, polarization,\nCP-violation, and spin correlation effects. No significant deviations from the\nSM predictions are observed.\n", "  The real part of the refractive index (RI) of aqueous solutions of human\nhemoglobin is computed from their absorption spectra in the wavelength range\n$250\\,{\\rm nm} - 1100\\,{\\rm nm}$ using the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations and\nthe corresponding uncertainty analysis is provided. The strong ultraviolet (UV)\nand infrared absorbance of the water outside this spectral range were taken\ninto account in a previous study employing KK relations. We improve these\nresults by including the concentration dependence of the water absorbance as\nwell as by modeling the deep UV absorbance of hemoglobin's peptide backbone.\nThe two free parameters of the model for the deep UV absorbance are fixed by a\nglobal fit.\n", "  Radial magnetic fields are observed in all known young, shell-type supernova\nremnants (SNRs) in our Galaxy, including Cas A, Tycho, Kepler, and SN1006 and\nyet the nature of these radial fields has not been thoroughly explored. Using a\n3D model, we consider the existence and observational implications of an\nintrinsically radial field. We also present a new explanation of the origin of\nthe radial pattern observed from polarization data as resulting from a\nselection effect due to the distribution of cosmic-ray electrons (CREs). We\nshow that quasi-parallel acceleration can concentrate CREs at regions where the\nmagnetic field is radial, making a completely turbulent field appear ordered,\nwhen it is in fact disordered. We discuss observational properties that may\nhelp distinguish between an intrinsically radial magnetic field and the case\nwhere it only appears radial due to the CRE distribution. We also show that the\ncase of an intrinsically radial field with a quasi-perpendicular CRE\nacceleration mechanism has intriguing similarities to the observed polarization\nproperties of SN1006.\n", "  The dynamics of the modulation instability induced by cross phase modulation\nis studied by considering the influence of the walk-off and noninstantaneous\nresponse effects for two copropagating optical fields travelling in the\nanomalous regime of dispersion. To do so, we make use of extensions of the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation jointly with the Debye model for polarization,\nwhich is shown to be effective and simplified when compared to the\nimplementation of other methods for the noninstantaneous nonlinear response. In\nanalyzing the sideband formation, two bands are observed with different\nbehaviors with respect to the way the maximum gain and the respective frequency\nvary with increasing phase mismatch. Further, we also show that the manner in\nwhich the maximum gain as well as its corresponding frequency scale with the\ndelay parameter $\\tau$ is substantially different from the cases of both fields\nexperiencing the normal group-velocity dispersion regime and the case of mixed\nregimes. These facts may give rise to many new possibilities for the evolution\nof the modulated wave when compared to the nonanomalous cases studied in the\nliterature.\n", "  We explain the concept of Krein signature in Hamiltonian and\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems on the case study of the one-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with a real harmonic potential and an imaginary\nlinear potential. These potentials correspond to the magnetic trap, and a\nlinear gain/loss in the mean-field model of cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. For the linearized Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we introduce the\nreal-valued Krein quantity, which is nonzero if the eigenvalue is neutrally\nstable and simple and zero if the eigenvalue is unstable. If the neutrally\nstable eigenvalue is simple, it persists with respect to perturbations.\nHowever, if it is multiple, it may split into unstable eigenvalues under\nperturbations. A necessary condition for the onset of instability past the\nbifurcation point requires existence of two simple neutrally stable eigenvalues\nof opposite Krein signatures before the bifurcation point. This property is\nuseful in the parameter continuations of neutrally stable eigenvalues of the\nlinearized Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n", "  Ionic layer epitaxy (ILE) has recently been developed as an effective\nstrategy to synthesize nanometer-thick 2D materials with a non-layered crystal\nstructure, such as ZnO. The packing density of the amphiphilic monolayer is\nbelieved to be a key parameter that controls the nanosheet nucleation and\ngrowth. In this work, we systematically investigated the growth behavior of\nsingle-crystalline ZnO nanosheets templated at the water-air interface by an\nanionic oleylsulfate monolayer with different packing densities. The\nthicknesses of ZnO nanosheets were tuned from one unit cell to four unit cells,\nand exhibited good correlation with the width of Zn2+ ion concentration zone\n(the Stern layer) underneath the ionized surfactant monolayer. Further analysis\nof the nanosheet sizes and density revealed that the nanosheet growth was\ndominated by the steric hindrance from the surfactant monolayer at lower\nsurface pressure; while the nucleation density became the dominating factor at\nhigher surface pressure. The ZnO nanosheets exhibited a decreasing work\nfunction as the thickness reduced to a few unit cells. This research validated\na critical hypothesis that the nanosheet growth is self-limited by the\nformation of a double layer of ionic precursors. This work will open up a new\nway towards controlled synthesis of novel 2D nanosheets from non-layered\nmaterials with a thickness down to one unit cell.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the development of a new L-band (1.4 GHz)\nCryogenic Phased Array Feed (PAF) system, referred to as the GBT2 array.\nResults from initial measurements made with the GBT2 array are also presented.\nThe PAF was developed for the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) as part of the Focal\nL-band Array for the GBT (FLAG) project. During the first stage of the\ndevelopment work (Phase I), a prototype cryogenic 19 element dual-polarized\narray with \"Kite\" dipole elements was developed and tested on the GBT. The\nmeasured system temperature over efficiency ($T_{sys}/\\eta$) ratio for the bore\nsight beam of the Kite array was 45.5 K at 1.55 GHz. The off-boresight\n$T_{sys}/\\eta$ shows an increase by 13 K at an offset equal to the half power\nbeam width (7$^{'}$.2 at 1.7 GHz). Our measurements indicate that the\noff-boresight degradation and field-of-view (FoV) limitation of the Kite array\nis simply due to the fixed array size. To increase the FoV, a new 19-element\nGBT2 array with larger array spacing was developed during FLAG Phase II. The\nfrequency response of the array was optimized from 1.2 to 1.6 GHz. A system\nwith larger cryostat, new low noise amplifiers (LNAs), down-conversion and\ndigitization close to the front end, unformatted digital transmission over\nfiber, ROACH II based polyphase filter banks (PFBs) with bandwidth 150 MHz and\na data acquisition system that records voltage samples from one of the PFB\nchannels were all developed. The data presented here is processed off-line. The\nreceiver temperature measured with the new system is 17 K at 1.4 GHz, an\nimprovement $>$ 8 K over the previous Kite array. Measurements with the GBT2\narray on the telescope are in progress. A real time 150 MHz beamformer is also\nbeing developed as part of an NSF-funded collaboration between NRAO/GBO/BYU \\&\nWest Virginia University (Beamformer Project) to support science observations.\n", "  Galaxy clusters contain large magnetic fields that make them excellent\ntargets to search for ultralight Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). ALP-photon\ninterconversion imprints quasi-sinusoidal oscillations on the X-ray spectra of\npoint sources in or behind the cluster. The absence of substantial oscillations\nallows us to place bounds on $g_{a \\gamma \\gamma}$. Here the bounds from the\n{\\it Chandra} X-ray observations of NGC1275 are presented, as well as those\npredicted for the {\\it Athena} X-ray observatory, due to launch in 2028.\n", "  We present a comprehensive investigation into the complexity of a new private\nkey storage apparatus: a novel silicon photonic physical unclonable function\n(PUF) based on ultrafast nonlinear optical interactions in a chaotic silicon\nmicrocavity that is both unclonable and impossible to emulate. This device\nprovides remarkable improvements to total information content (raw\ncryptographic material), information density, and key generation rates over\nexisting optical scattering PUFs and is also more easily integrated with both\nCMOS electronics and telecommunications hardware. Our device exploits the\nnatural nonlinear optical behavior of silicon to neutralize commonly used\nattacks against PUFs and vastly enhance device complexity. We confirm this\nphenomenon with thorough experimental results on prototype devices and present\na detailed estimate of their total information content. Our compact,\nmicron-scale approach represents an entirely new generation of ultrafast and\nhigh information density photonic PUF devices that can be directly incorporated\ninto integrated circuits to ensure authenticity and provide secure physical\nstorage of private key material.\n", "  We assess the science reach and technical feasibility of a satellite mission\nbased on precision atomic sensors configured to detect gravitational radiation.\nConceptual advances in the past three years indicate that a two-satellite\nconstellation with science payloads consisting of atomic sensors based on laser\ncooled atomic Sr can achieve scientifically interesting gravitational wave\nstrain sensitivities in a frequency band between the LISA and LIGO detectors,\nroughly 30 mHz to 10 Hz. The discovery potential of the proposed instrument\nranges from from observation of new astrophysical sources (e.g. black hole and\nneutron star binaries) to searches for cosmological sources of stochastic\ngravitational radiation and searches for dark matter.\n", "  We report the development of XASdb, a large database of computed reference\nX-ray absorption spectra (XAS), and a novel Ensemble-Learned Spectra\nIdEntification (ELSIE) algorithm for the matching of spectra. XASdb currently\nhosts more than 300,000 K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge spectra (XANES) for\nover 30,000 materials from the open-science Materials Project database. We\ndiscuss a high-throughput automation framework for FEFF calculations, built on\nrobust, rigorously benchmarked parameters. We will demonstrate that the ELSIE\nalgorithm, which combines 33 weak \"learners\" comprising a set of preprocessing\nsteps and a similarity metric, can achieve up to 84.2% accuracy in identifying\nthe correct oxidation state and coordination environment of a test set of 19\nK-edge XANES spectra encompassing a diverse range of chemistries and crystal\nstructures. The XASdb with the ELSIE algorithm has been integrated into a web\napplication in the Materials Project, providing an important new public\nresource for the analysis of XAS to all materials researchers. Finally, the\nELSIE algorithm itself has been made available as part of Veidt, an open source\nmachine learning library for materials science.\n", "  By assuming the existing of memory effects and long-range interactions in the\nhot and dense matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions, the\nnonextensive statistics together with the relativistic hydrodynamics including\nphase transition is used to discuss the transverse momentum distributions of\ncharged particles produced in heavy ion collisions. It is shown that the\ncombined contributions from nonextensive statistics and hydrodynamics can give\na good description to the experimental data in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN )=\n200 GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) )= 2.76 TeV for pi^(+ -) , K^(+\n-) in the whole measured transverse momentum region, and for p(p-bar) in the\nregion of p_T<= 2.0 GeV/c. This is different from our previous work, where, by\nusing the conventional statistics plus hydrodynamics, the describable region is\nonly limited in p_T<= 1.1 GeV/c.\n", "  Current approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation will not enable\nuseful quantum computation on near-term devices of 50 to 100 qubits. Leading\nproposals, such as the color code and surface code schemes, must devote a large\nfraction of their physical quantum bits to quantum error correction. Building\nfrom recent quantum machine learning techniques, we propose an alternative\napproach to quantum error correction aimed at reducing this overhead, which can\nbe implemented in existing quantum hardware and on a myriad of quantum\ncomputing architectures. This method aims to optimize the average fidelity of\nencoding and recovery circuits with respect to the actual noise in the device,\nas opposed to that of an artificial or approximate noise model. The quantum\nvariational error corrector (QVECTOR) algorithm employs a quantum circuit with\nparameters that are variationally-optimized according to processed data\noriginating from quantum sampling of the device, so as to learn encoding and\nerror-recovery gate sequences. We develop this approach for the task of\npreserving quantum memory and analyze its performance with simulations. We find\nthat, subject to phase damping noise, the simulated QVECTOR algorithm learns a\nthree-qubit encoding and recovery which extend the effective T2 of a quantum\nmemory six-fold. Subject to a continuous-time amplitude- plus phase-damping\nnoise model on five qubits, the simulated QVECTOR algorithm learns encoding and\ndecoding circuits which exploit the coherence among Pauli errors in the noise\nmodel to outperform the five-qubit stabilizer code and any other scheme that\ndoes not leverage such coherence. Both of these schemes can be implemented with\nexisting hardware.\n", "  We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ particles on $R^d$ interacting through a\nsingular repulsive potential, e.g.~the well-known Lennard-Jones type, and show\nthat the system converges to the unique invariant Gibbs measure exponentially\nfast in a weighted total variation distance. The proof of the main result\nrelies on an explicit construction of a Lyapunov function. In contrast to\nprevious results for such systems, our result implies geometric convergence to\nequilibrium starting from an essentially optimal family of initial\ndistributions.\n", "  We present an analytical formalism to study the secular dynamics of a system\nconsisting of N-2 planets orbiting a binary star in outer orbits. We introduce\na canonical coordinate system and expand the disturbing function in terms of\ncanonical elliptic elements, combining both Legendre polynomials and Laplace\ncoefficients, to obtain a general formalism for the secular description of this\ntype of configuration. With a quadractic approximation of the development, we\npresent a simplified analytical solution for the planetary orbits for both the\nsingle planet and the two-planet cases. From the two-planet model, we show that\nthe inner planet accelerates the precession rate of the binary pericenter,\nwhich, in turn, may enter in resonance with the secular frequency of the outer\nplanet, characterizing a secular resonance. We calculate an analytical\nexpression for the approximate location of this resonance and apply it to known\ncircumbinary systems, where we show that it can occur at relatively close\norbits, for example at 2.4 au for the Kepler-38 system. With a more refined\nmodel, we analyse the dynamics of this secular resonance and we show that a\nbifurcation of the corresponding fixed points can affect the long term\nevolution and stability of planetary systems. By comparing our results with\ncomplete integrations of the exact equations of motion, we verified the\naccuracy of our analytical model.\n", "  The arrival of the robustly hyperbolic asteroid A/2017 U1 has potentially\ninteresting ramifications for the planet-formation process. Although\nextrapolations from a sample size of one are necessarily uncertain,\norder-of-magnitude estimates suggest that the Galaxy contains a substantial\nmass in similar bodies. We argue that despite its lack of Coma, A/2017 U1\nlikely contained a significant mass fraction of volatile components, and we\nargue that its presence can be used to infer a potentially large population of\nas-yet undetected Neptune-like extrasolar planets.\n", "  The angular response of thin diffractive optical elements is highly\ncorrelated. For example, the angles of incidence and diffraction of a grating\nare locked through the grating momentum determined by the grating period. Other\ndiffractive devices, including conventional metasurfaces, have a similar\nangular behavior due to the fixed locations of the Fresnel zone boundaries and\nthe weak angular sensitivity of the meta-atoms. To alter this fundamental\nproperty, we introduce angle-multiplexed metasurfaces, composed of reflective\nhigh-contrast dielectric U-shaped meta-atoms, whose response under illumination\nfrom different angles can be controlled independently. This enables flat\noptical devices that impose different and independent optical transformations\nwhen illuminated from different directions, a capability not previously\navailable in diffractive optics.\n", "  We present the design, fabrication and measured performance of a hierarchical\nsinuous-antenna phased array coupled to transition-edge-sensor (TES) bolometers\nfor measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). To efficiently cover\na broader range of frequencies, many CMB experiments have begun to deploy\nmultichroic pixels. For a given cryogenic and optical design, the pixel size\nthat optimizes the mapping speed is frequency-dependent and increases with\nwavelength. If a multichroic pixel is the same size at all frequencies, then\nthe mapping speed will be optimal in at most one frequency band. To achieve\noptimal mapping speed at all frequencies, a pixel size that varies with\nfrequency is needed. This can be accomplished by creating phased arrays from\nneighboring pixels, where the size of each phased array is chosen independently\nfor each frequency band. As the array unit, we choose a lenslet-coupled sinuous\nantenna on account of its wide bandwidth, dual polarization and constant beam\nwaist. We find that the array factor tends to compensate for beam\nnon-idealities, so that the sinuous antenna can be substantially undersized\nrelative to the single-element case; this frees up valuable focal-plane area\nfor bolometers, bandpass filters, summing networks, readout circuitry, etc. An\nadditional benefit of a hierarchical phased array is the reduced readout\nrequirement: since the low frequencies are arrayed to increase their mapping\nspeeds, the detector count scales approximately logarithmically with the number\nof frequency bands. Here we present measurements from a prototype device, in\nwhich hierarchical triangular arrays are used at 90, 150 and 220 GHz to keep\nthe effective pixel size and, therefore, the beam width roughly constant across\nthe entire frequency range.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate photonic tensor network states by sequential\nscattering of photons in waveguide QED systems. We show that sequential\nscatterings can convert a series of unentangled photons into any type of matrix\nproduct states. We also demonstrate the possibility of generating projected\nentangled pair states with arbitrary network representation by photon\nre-scattering.\n", "  In this report, we identify the origin of the temperature dependence of the\nsurface energy gap in impurity-doped topological insulators. The gap at the\nDirac point and its variation with temperature were studied by using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in Cr-doped Bi2Se3. Our valence band\nphotoemission results revealed that the gap varies with temperature due to\nresidual gas condensation on the sample surface with cooling. Adsorbate on the\nsurface of the sample creates an electron doping effect that modifies the\nchemical potential of the system resulting in the change of the gap with\nvariable temperature. Such electron doping can weaken the ferromagnetism and\nlead to a bulk band contribution in the transport measurements. Also, a larger\nenergy gap is required to suppress the thermal excitations for the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect. Therefore, such effects can hinder the quantum anomalous\nHall state at higher temperatures. Resolving this issue can pave the way for\nenhancing the observation temperature of the quantum anomalous Hall effect.\nTherefore, our findings can play a significant role in the discovery of the\nhigh-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect in impurity-doped topological\ninsulators.\n", "  We estimated the coronal magnetic field strength ($B$) during the 23 July\n2016 coronal mass ejection (CME) event using i) the flux rope structure of the\nCME in the whitelight coronagraph images and ii) the band splitting in the\nassociated type {\\sc II} burst. No models were assumed for the coronal electron\ndensity ($N(r)$) used in the estimation.The results obtained using the above\ntwo independent methods correspond to different heliocentric distances ($r$) in\nthe range $\\approx$\\,2.5\\,--\\,4.5$\\rm R_{\\odot}$, but they show excellent\nconsistency and could be fitted with a single power-law distribution of the\ntype $B(r)=5.7r^{-2.6}$ \\textrm{G}, which is applicable in the aforementioned\ndistance range. The power law index i.e. $-2.6$) is in good agreement with the\nresults obtained in previous studies by different methods.\n", "  We show that the canonical random-cluster measure associated to isoradial\ngraphs is critical for all $q \\geq 1$. Additionally, we prove that the phase\ntransition of the model is of the same type on all isoradial graphs: continuous\nfor $1 \\leq q \\leq 4$ and discontinuous for $q > 4$. For $1 \\leq q \\leq 4$, the\narm exponents (assuming their existence) are shown to be the same for all\nisoradial graphs. In particular, these properties also hold on the triangular\nand hexagonal lattices. Our results also include the limiting case of quantum\nrandom-cluster models in $1+1$ dimensions.\n", "  We show how the inclusive $t\\bar t$ production in $e^+e^-$, gluon~gluon and\nphoton~photon collisions could reveal the presence of new (visible or\ninvisible) particles connected to the Higgs sector and/or to the top quark.\n", "  The effect of dark energy on the low and high temperature of strip region of\nthe boundary field theory dual to AdS black holes was studied. In this\nframework, we investigate this behavior for different types of equation state\nand different regimes of normalization factor (a). We will see that the change\nof entanglement entropy is growing up with increasing a and |\\omega|.\n", "  Transient interaction of counter-streaming super-sonic plasma flows in dipole\nmagnetic dipole is studied in laboratory experiment. First quasi-stationary\nflow is produced by teta-pinch and forms a magnetosphere around the magnetic\ndipole while laser beams focused at the surface of the dipole cover launch\nsecond explosive plasma expanding from inner dipole region outward. Laser\nplasma is energetic enough to disrupt magnetic field and to sweep through the\nbackground plasma for large distances. Probe measurements showed that far from\nthe initially formed magnetosphere laser plasma carries within itself a\nmagnetic field of the same direction but order of magnitude larger in value\nthan the vacuum dipole field at considered distances. Because no compression of\nmagnetic field at the front of laser plasma was observed, the realized\ninteraction is different from previous experiments and theoretical models of\nlaser plasma expansion into uniform magnetized background. It was deduced based\non the obtained data that laser plasma while expanding through inner\nmagnetosphere picks up a magnetized shell formed by background plasma and\ncarries it for large distances beyond previously existing magnetosphere.\n", "  We discuss a class of mechanical models of thermometers and their minimal\nrequirements to determine the temperature for systems out of the common scope\nof thermometry. In particular we consider: 1) anharmonic chains with long time\nof thermalization, such as the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) model; 2) systems with\nlong-range interactions where the equivalence of ensembles does not always\nhold; 3) systems featuring absolute negative temperatures. We show that for all\nthe three classes of systems a mechanical thermometer model can be designed: a\ntemporal average of a suitable mechanical observable of the thermometer is\nsufficient to get an estimate of the system's temperature. Several interesting\nlessons are learnt from our numerical study: 1) the long thermalization times\nin FPU-like systems do not affect the thermometer, which is not coupled to\nnormal modes but to a group of microscopic degrees of freedom; 2) a thermometer\ncoupled to a long-range system measures its microcanonical temperature, even at\nvalues of the total energy where its canonical temperature would be very\ndifferent; 3) a thermometer to read absolute negative temperatures must have a\nbounded total energy (as the system), otherwise it heavily perturbs the system\nchanging the sign of its temperature. Our study shows that in order to work in\na correct way also in \"non standard\" cases, the proper model of thermometer\nmust have a special functional form, e.g. the kinetic part cannot be quadratic.\n", "  Stepped well-ordered semiconductor surfaces are important as nanotemplates\nfor the fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructures which are candidates of\nintriguing electronic properties. Therefore a detailed understanding of the\nunderlying stepped substrates is crucial for advances in this field. Although\nmeasurements of step edges are challenging for scanning force microscopy (SFM),\nhere we present for the first time simultaneous atomically resolved SFM and\nKelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images of a silicon vicinal surface. We\nfind that the local contact potential difference is not homogeneous over all\nsilicon atoms, contrary to the common understanding of the work function. For\nthe interpretation of the data we performed density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations. We explain the atomic-scale electronic features by differences in\nthe surface dipole distribution caused by a Smoluchowski-type effect. E.g., at\nstep edges the partial negative charge is larger at the lower-lying atoms\ncloser to the bulk than at the atoms more protruding towards the vacuum. This\nis the first manifestation of such type of effect on a semiconductor surface.\nThe DFT images accurately reproduce the experiments even without including the\ntip in the calculations. This underlines that the high-resolution KPFM images\nindeed show the intrinsic properties of the surface and not only tip-surface\ninteractions.\n", "  We consider the compressive wave for the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation\nwith background constants $c>0$ for $x\\to-\\infty$ and $0$ for $x\\to+\\infty.$ We\nstudy the asymptotics of solutions in the transition zone $4c^2t-\\varepsilon\nt<x<4c^2t-\\beta t^{\\sigma}\\ln t$ for $\\varepsilon>0,$ $\\sigma\\in(0,1),$\n$\\beta>0.$ In this region we have a bulk of nonvanishing oscillations, the\nnumber of which grows as $\\frac{\\varepsilon t}{\\ln t}.$ Also we show how to\nobtain Khruslov--Kotlyarov's asymptotics in the domain $4c^2t-\\rho\\ln\nt<x<4c^2t$ with the help of parametrices constructed out of Laguerre\npolynomials in the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem.\n", "  More and more works deal with statistical systems far from equilibrium,\ndominated by unidirectional stochastic processes augmented by rare resets. We\nanalyze the construction of the entropic distance measure appropriate for such\ndynamics. We demonstrate that a power-like nonlinearity in the state\nprobability in the master equation naturally leads to the Tsallis\n(Havrda-Charv\\'at, Acz\\'el-Dar\\'oczy) q-entropy formula in the context of\nseeking for the maximal entropy state at stationarity. A few possible\napplications of a certain simple and linear master equation to phenomena\nstudied in statistical physics are listed at the end.\n", "  The Mini-EUSO telescope is designed by the JEM-EUSO Collaboration to observe\nthe UV emission of the Earth from the vantage point of the International Space\nStation (ISS) in low Earth orbit. The main goal of the mission is to map the\nEarth in the UV, thus increasing the technological readiness level of future\nEUSO experiments and to lay the groundwork for the detection of Extreme Energy\nCosmic Rays (EECRs) from space. Due to its high time resolution of 2.5 us,\nMini-EUSO is capable of detecting a wide range of UV phenomena in the Earth's\natmosphere. In order to maximise the scientific return of the mission, it is\nnecessary to implement a multi-level trigger logic for data selection over\ndifferent timescales. This logic is key to the success of the mission and thus\nmust be thoroughly tested and carefully integrated into the data processing\nsystem prior to the launch. This article introduces the motivation behind the\ntrigger design and details the integration and testing of the logic.\n", "  Dubnicka-Dubnickova-Kuraev (DDK) sum rules are considered. It is shown that\nintegrals over differences of the total photoproduction cross-sections on octet\nbaryons could be understood in terms of unitary symmetry approach. All the DDK\nsum rules for these quantities are expressed in terms of only three parameters.\n", "  We examine the velocity profile of coherent vortices appearing as a\nconsequence of the inverse cascade of two-dimensional turbulence in a finite\nbox in the case of static pumping. We demonstrate that in the passive regime\nthe flat velocity profile is realized, as in the case of pumping short\ncorrelated in time. However, in the static case the energy flux to large scales\nis dependent on the system parameters. We demonstrate that it is proportional\nto $f^{4/3}$ where $f$ is the characteristic force exciting turbulence.\n", "  In this work a novel methodology for fracture toughness characterization by\nmeans of the small punch test (SPT) is presented. Notched specimens are\nemployed and fracture resistance is assessed through a critical value of the\nnotch mouth displacement {\\delta^SPT}. Finite element simulations and\ninterrupted experiments are used to track the evolution of {\\delta^SPT} as a\nfunction of the punch displacement. The onset of crack propagation is\nidentified by means of a ductile damage model and the outcome is compared to\nthe crack tip opening displacement estimated from conventional tests at crack\ninitiation. The proposed numerical-experimental scheme is examined with two\ndifferent grades of CrMoV steel and the differences in material toughness\ncaptured. Limitations and uncertainties arising from the different damage\nphenomena observed in the lowest toughness material examined are thoroughly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Suspensions of actively driven anisotropic objects exhibit distinctively\nnonequilibrium behaviors, and current theories predict that they are incapable\nof sustaining orientational order at high activity. By contrast, here we show\nthat nematic suspensions on a substrate can display order at arbitrarily high\nactivity due to a previously unreported, potentially stabilizing active force.\nThe resulting nonequilibrium ordered phase displays robust giant number\nfluctuations that cannot be suppressed even by an incompressible solvent. Our\nresults apply to virtually all experimental assays used to investigate the\nactive nematic ordering of self-propelled colloids, bacterial suspensions and\nthe cytoskeleton, and have testable implications in interpreting their\nnonequilibrium behaviors\n", "  The New Horizons spacecraft's nominal trajectory crosses the planet's\nsatellite plane at $\\sim 10,000\\ \\rm{km}$ from the barycenter, between the\norbits of Pluto and Charon. I have investigated the risk to the spacecraft\nbased on observational limits of rings and dust within this region, assuming\nvarious particle size distributions. The best limits are placed by 2011 and\n2012 HST observations, which significantly improve on the limits from stellar\noccultations, although they do not go as close to the planet. From the HST data\nand assuming a `reasonable worst case' for the size distribution, we place a\nlimit of $N < 20$ damaging impacts by grains of radius $> 0.2\\ \\textrm{mm}$\nonto the spacecraft during the encounter. The number of hits is $\\approx$\n200$\\times$ above the NH mission requirement, and $\\approx$ $2000\\times$ above\nthe mission's desired level. Stellar occultations remain valuable because they\nare able to measure $N$ closer to the Pluto surface than direct imaging,\nalthough with a sensitivity limit several orders of magnitude higher than that\nfrom HST imaging. Neither HST nor occultations are sensitive enough to place\nlimits on $N$ at or below the mission requirements.\n", "  Physical studies of asteroids depend on an availability of lightcurve data.\nTargets that are easy to observe and analyse naturally have more data\navailable, so their synodic periods are confirmed from multiple sources. Also,\nthanks to availability of data from a number of apparitions, their spin and\nshape models can often be obtained.\n  Almost half of bright (H<=11 mag) main-belt asteroid population with known\nlightcurve parameters have rotation periods considered long (P>12 hours) and\nare rarely chosen for photometric observations. There is a similar selection\neffect against asteroids with low lightcurve amplitudes (a_max<=0.25 mag). As a\nresult such targets, though numerous in this brightness range, are\nunderrepresented in the sample of spin and shape modelled asteroids. In the\nrange of fainter targets such effects are stronger. These selection effects can\ninfluence what is now known about asteroid spin vs. size distribution, on\nasteroid internal structure and densities and on spatial orientation of\nasteroid spin axes.\n  To reduce both biases at the same time, we started a photometric survey of a\nsubstantial sample of those bright main-belt asteroids that displayed both\nfeatures: periods longer than 12 hours, and amplitudes that did not exceed 0.25\nmagnitude. First we aim at finding synodic periods of rotation, and after a few\nobserved apparitions, obtaining spin and shape models.\n  As an initial result of our survey we found that a quarter of the studied\nsample (8 out of 34 targets) have rotation periods different from those widely\naccepted. We publish here these newly found period values with the lightcurves.\n  The size/frequency plot might in reality look different in the long-period\nrange. Further studies of asteroid spins, shapes, and structure should take\ninto account serious biases that are present in the parameters available today.\n", "  We present a study of an impacting descent probe that increases the science\nreturn of spacecraft orbiting or passing an atmosphere-less planetary body of\nthe solar system, such as the Galilean moons of Jupiter. The descent probe is a\ncarry-on small spacecraft (< 100 kg), to be deployed by the mother spacecraft,\nthat brings itself onto a collisional trajectory with the targeted planetary\nbody in a simple manner. A possible science payload includes instruments for\nsurface imaging, characterisation of the neutral exosphere, and magnetic field\nand plasma measurement near the target body down to very low-altitudes (~1 km),\nduring the probe's fast (~km/s) descent to the surface until impact. The\nscience goals and the concept of operation are discussed with particular\nreference to Europa, including options for flying through water plumes and\nafter-impact retrieval of very-low altitude science data. All in all, it is\ndemonstrated how the descent probe has the potential to provide a high science\nreturn to a mission at a low extra level of complexity, engineering effort, and\nrisk. This study builds upon earlier studies for a Callisto Descent Probe (CDP)\nfor the former Europa-Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) of ESA and NASA, and\nextends them with a detailed assessment of a descent probe designed to be an\nadditional science payload for the NASA Europa Mission.\n", "  The complementarity of direct, indirect and collider searches for dark matter\nhas improved our understanding concerning the properties of the dark matter\nparticle. In this short review, we present a step toward the fundamental nature\nof dark matter with direct detection experiments only, go through some of the\npotential dark matter signals in gamma-rays, x-rays, and anti-matter, and\nlastly discuss the prospects of WIMPs in the next decade.\n", "  The fast Fourier transform, FFT, is a useful and prevalent algorithm in\nsignal processing. It characterizes the spectral components of a signal, or is\nused in combination with other operations to perform more complex computations\nsuch as filtering, convolution, and correlation. Digital FFTs are limited in\nspeed by the necessity of moving charge within logic gates. An analog temporal\nFFT in fiber optics has been demonstrated with highest data bandwidth. However,\nthe implementation with discrete fiber optic FFT components is bulky. Here, we\npresent and analyze a design of an optical FFT in Silicon photonics and\nevaluate its performance with respect to variations in phase and amplitude. We\ndiscuss the impact of the deployed devices on the FFTs transfer function\nquality as defined by the transmission output power as a function of frequency,\ndetuning phase, optical delay, and loss.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics procedures as well as spectral-correlation analysis are\nused for the acoustical response of consecutive physical-chemical stages of the\norganic self-propagating high-temperature synthesis. The transient nature of\nprocesses in the system studied is revealed. The study of changes in temporal\nand spatial dynamics of such systems allows driving the wave of the chemical\nreaction to make the solid phase \"combustion\" more efficient and produce\ncondensed products with desired properties.\n", "  We study nonlinear dynamics of the Earth's tropical climate system. For that,\nwe apply a recently developed technique for feature extraction and mode\ndecomposition of spatiotemporal data generated by ergodic dynamical systems.\nThe method relies on constructing low-dimensional representations (temporal\npatterns) of signals using eigenfunctions of Koopman operators governing the\nevolution of observables in ergodic dynamical systems. We apply this technique\nto a variety of tropical climate datasets and extract a multiscale hierarchy of\nspatiotemporal patterns on diurnal to interannual timescales. In particular, we\ndetect without prefiltering the input data modes operating on intraseasonal and\nshorter timescales that correspond to propagation of organized convection. We\ndiscuss the salient properties of these propagating features and in particular\nwe focus on how the activity of certain types of these traveling patterns is\nrelated to lower-frequency dynamics. As an extension of this work, we discuss\ntheir potential predictability based on a range of nonparametric techniques and\npotential advances related to understanding the deterministic and stochastic\naspects of the variability of these modes.\n", "  In this paper, we used the 8-band k$\\cdot$p model with valence force field\nconsiderations to investigate the effect of size and shape on electronic and\noptical properties of cadmium selenide quantum dots. Major factors related to\ntheir properties including band mixing probabilities, spatial charge\ndistributions, transition matrix elements and Fermi factors were studied.\nVolumetrically larger CdSe dots were found to have smaller band-gaps but higher\ntransition matrix elements and Fermi factors. The maximum optical gain for dots\nwas observed to have an initially positive and then negative correlation with\ntheir real-space size as a result of combined effects of various factors. For\nthe shape effects, cubic dots were found to have smaller band-gaps, Fermi\nfactors and transition matrix elements than spherical dots due to higher level\nof asymmetry and different surface effects. Consequently, cubic dots have lower\nemission energy, smaller amplification. The occurrence of near E1-H1 transition\nbroadens the gain spectrum of cubic dots. Cubic and spherical dots are both\nproven to be promising candidates for optical devices under visible range. We\nhave demonstrated that size and shape change could both effectively alter the\nproperties of quantum dots and therefore recommend consideration of both when\noptimizing the performance for any desired application.\n", "  Strong gravitational lensing is an important tool to probe the universe. In\nthe theoretical analysis of gravitational lensing, it is assumed that\ncontinuous density profile can correctly describe the lens galaxy. But in fact\nthis assumption has never been rigorously tested. In this paper, we discuss\nthis issue, and point out that if we use discrete density profile to model the\nlens galaxy, then the position of the images does not change, but the\nmagnification will be increased. Strongly lensed gravitational waves could test\nthis conclusion in the future.\n", "  We present strong evidence for a rotation period of 2.0406 d of the O giant\n$\\xi$ Persei, derived from the NIV $\\lambda$1718 wind line in 12 yr of IUE\ndata. We predict that $\\xi$ Per has a magnetic dipole field, with superposed\nvariable magnetic prominences. Favorable dates for future magnetic measurements\ncan be predicted. We also analysed time-resolved He II 4686 spectra from a\ncampaign in 1989 by using the same simplified model as before for $\\lambda$\nCephei, in terms of multiple spherical blobs attached to the surface, called\nstellar prominences (Sudnik & Henrichs 2016). These represent transient\nmultiple magnetic loops on the surface, for which we find lifetimes of mostly\nless than 5 h.\n", "  Bulk single crystals of manganese arsenide (MnAs) were grown from melt at 1\nGPa and 1100 {\\deg}C by using a cubic-anvil, high-pressure, and\nhigh-temperature technique. The as-grown black colored crystals extracted from\nsolidified lump exhibit a plate-like morphology, with flat surfaces and maximum\ndimensions up to ~ 3 x 2 x 0.5 mm3. The hexagonal crystal structure at room\ntemperature was confirmed by X-ray diffraction [B81, space group P63/mmc, No\n194, Z = 2, a = 3.7173(4) {\\AA}, b = 3.7173(4) {\\AA}, c = 5.7054(8) {\\AA}, and\nV = 68.277(16) {\\AA}3]. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements reveal\nthe occurrence of a first-order ferro- to paramagnetic transition at Tc = 318.5\nK accompanied by a hysteresis of ~ 9 K. The successful growth of relatively\nlarge crystals reported here might be extended to various substituted analogues\nof MnAs, thus opening new possibilities for further exploration of this\ninteresting system.\n", "  In this talk we review the recent progress on the numerical determination of\nthe Hadronic Light-by-Light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe muon and we discuss the role of experimental data on the accuracy of its\ndetermination. Special emphasis on the main contribution, the pseudoscalar\npiece, is made. Gathering recent progress in the light-by-light scattering\ncontribution we consider $a_{\\mu}^{{\\mathrm{HLBL}}} =\n(12.1\\pm3.0)\\times10^{-10}$ as a good summary of the state-of-the-art\ncalculations which still claims for a $4\\sigma$ deviation between theory and\nexperiment for the $(g-2)_{\\mu}$.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{t}$ be a commutative Lie subalgebra of ${\\rm\nsl}_{n}(\\mathbb{C})$ of maximal dimension. We consider in this paper three\nspaces of $\\mathfrak{t}$-loops that each get deformed in a different way. We\nrequire that the deformed generators of each of them evolve w.r.t. the\ncommuting flows they generate according to a certain, different set of Lax\nequations. This leads to three integrable hierarchies: the $({\\rm\nsl}_{n}(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathfrak{t})$-hierarchy, its strict version and the\ncombined $({\\rm sl}_{n}(\\mathbb{C}), \\mathfrak{t})$-hierarchy. For $n=2$ and\n$\\mathfrak{t}$ the diagonal matrices, the $({\\rm sl}_{2}(\\mathbb{C}),\n\\mathfrak{t})$-hierarchy is the AKNS-hierarchy. We treat their interrelations\nand show that all three have a zero curvature form. Furthermore, we discuss\ntheir linearization and we conclude by giving the construction of a large class\nof solutions.\n", "  We explore the sparticle spectroscopy of the supersymmetric SU(5) model with\nnon-universal gaugino masses in light of latest experimental searches. We\nassume that the gaugino mass parameters are independent at the GUT scale. We\nfind that the observed deviation in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon\ncan be explained in this model. The parameter space that explains this\ndeviation predicts a heavy colored sparticle spectrum whereas the sleptons can\nbe light. We also find a notable region of the parameter space that yields the\ndesired relic abundance for dark matter. In addition, we analyze the model in\nlight of latest limits from direct detection experiments and find that the\nparameter space corresponding to the observed deviation in the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment can be probed at some of the future direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  To characterise the long-term stability and true photometric sensitivity of a\nspace-based instrument is a difficult task and can be done best with\nindependent measurements of a relatively quiet star. A rare occasion for such a\ntest are the complementary observations of some bright Plejades stars with the\nKepler/K2 telescope and the BRITE-Austria (BAb) and UniBRITE (UBr) satellites.\nWhile most of them show a complex oscillatory behaviour, the frequency spectrum\nof the bright B-type star Atlas is relatively simple. From the 71 days-long K2\nobservations we extract the three dominant frequencies and show that the\nresiduals have a noise level of less than 10ppm. While the BAb observations are\nnot sensitive enough, we find the same periodicities in the 167 days-long UBr\ndata set, which shows no additional significant signal down to a noise level of\nabout 100ppm. This impressively demonstrates the stability of the BRITE\ninstruments in the low-frequency regime and their capability to detect sub-mmag\nvariability, even for stars close to the faint end of the nominal dynamic\nrange.\n", "  We presented a general multi-physics model for shale gas flow in fractured\nsystems, first the first time, with fully coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical\n(THM) properties. The impact of gas adsorption, real gas properties, gas flow\nin nano-scale pore space and geomechanics effects on total gas flow capacity\nare investigated. We also showed that by elevating shale rock temperature, the\ncharacteristic of gas adsorption behavior can be substantially altered.\n", "  We aim to perform a statistical study of stellar flares observed by Kepler.\nWe want to study the flare amplitude, duration, energy and occurrence rates,\nand how they are related to the spectral type and rotation period. To that end,\nwe have developed an automated flare detection and characterisation algorithm.\nWe have harvested the stellar parameters from the Kepler input catalogue and\nthe rotation periods from McQuillan et al. (2014). We find several new\ncandidate A stars showing flaring activity. Moreover, we find 653 giants with\nflares. From the statistical distribution of flare properties, we find that the\nflare amplitude distribution has a similar behaviour between F+G-types and\nK+M-types. The flare duration and flare energy seem to be grouped between\nG+K+M-types vs. F-types and giants. We also detect a tail of stars with high\nflare occurrence rates across all spectral types (but most prominent in the\nlate spectral types), and this is compatible with the existence of \"flare\nstars\". Finally, we have found a strong correlation of the flare occurrence\nrate and the flare amplitude with the stellar rotation period: a quickly\nrotating star is more likely to flare often, and has a higher chance to\ngenerate large flares.\n", "  A systematic experimental and numerical investigation of the conditions for\nthe spontaneous formation of laser cavity solitons in broad-area\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers with frequency-selective feedback by a\nvolume Bragg grating is reported. It is shown that the switching thresholds are\ncontrolled by a combination of frequency shifts induced by ambient temperature\nand Joule heating. The gain level has only a minor influence on the threshold\nbut controls mainly the power of the solitons. At large initial detuning and\nhigh threshold gain, the first observed structure can be a high order soliton.\nIn real devices spatial disorder in the cavity length causes a pinning of\nsolitons and a dispersion of thresholds. The experimental observations are in\ngood agreement with numerical simulations taking into account disorder and the\ncoupling of gain and cavity resonance due to Joule heating. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that the existence of the traps explain the spontaneous switch on\nof the solitons,but do not modify the soliton shape significantly, i.e. the\nobserved solitons are a good approximation of the ones expected in a homogenous\nsystem.\n", "  We discuss the process of colour-singlet parton-parton scattering, which in\nhadron-hadron collision can lead to production of jet events, where a rapidity\ngap between the jets is present. The dynamics of the process is calculated\nwithin LL BFKL approximation. Using Pythia MC generator, hadronic shapes of\njet-gap-jet events are studied, in particular the distributions of the rapidity\ngap size resulting from the jet formation processes. Using Pythia's modelling\nof multiple parton interactions, the rescattering effects are simulated. It is\nshown how these effects influence the gap size distributions. The kinematic\ndependence of the gap survival probability is discussed.\n", "  To support scientific visualization of multiple-mission data from Mars, the\nVirtual Astronaut (VA) creates an interactive virtual 3D environment built on\nthe Unity3D Game Engine. A prototype study was conducted based on orbital and\nOpportunity Rover data covering Santa Maria Crater in Meridiani Planum on Mars.\nThe VA at Santa Maria provides dynamic visual representations of the imaging,\ncompositional, and mineralogical information. The VA lets one navigate through\nthe scene and provides geomorphic and geologic contexts for the rover\noperations. User interactions include in-situ observations visualization,\nfeature measurement, and an animation control of rover drives. This paper\ncovers our approach and implementation of the VA system. A brief summary of the\nprototype system functions and user feedback is also covered. Based on external\nreview and comments by the science community, the prototype at Santa Maria has\nproven the VA to be an effective tool for virtual geovisual analysis.\n", "  We use duality to relate resonances in missing mass $M$ to the large-mass\ndiffraction dissociation of protons. In deep inelastic lepton-hadron scattering\n(DIS), hadronic resonances are related by duality in $Q^2$ to the low-$x$,\nsmooth behaviour of the DIS structure functions.\n", "  We have realized a conical matter wave lens. The repulsive potential of a\nfocused laser beam was used to launch a Bose-Einstein condensate into a\nradially expanding wavepacket whose perfect ring shape was ensured by energy\nconservation. In spite of significant interactions between atoms, the spatial\nand velocity widths of the ring along its radial dimension remained extremely\nnarrow, as also confirmed by numerical simulations. Our results open the\npossibility for cylindrical atom optics without the perturbing effect of\nmean-field interactions.\n", "  We present a set of notes, meant for quick reference, on radiative spin\npolarization, computer algorithms and spin matching in electron storage rings.\n"]}
