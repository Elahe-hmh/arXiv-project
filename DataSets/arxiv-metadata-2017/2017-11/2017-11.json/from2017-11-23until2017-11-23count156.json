This limit,\nunattainable by the particles, represents a preferred inertial reference frame\nassociated with a universal background field that breaks Lorentz symmetry.\nThere emerges a new relativistic dynamics where a minimum speed forms an\ninferior energy barrier. One of the interesting consequences of the existence\nof such a minimum speed is that it prevents the absolute zero temperature for\nan ultracold gas according to the third law of thermodynamics. So we will be\nable to provide a fundamental dynamical explanation for the third law through a\nconnection between such a phenomenological law and the new relativistic\ndynamics with a minimum speed.\n", "  An thorough introduction is given at an introductory level to the field of\nquantitative complex system science, with special emphasis on emergence in\ndynamical systems based on network topologies. Subjects treated include graph\ntheory and small-world networks, a generic introduction to the concepts of\ndynamical system theory, random Boolean networks, cellular automata and\nself-organized criticality, the statistical modeling of Darwinian evolution,\nsynchronization phenomena and an introduction to the theory of cognitive\nsystems.\n  It inludes chapter on Graph Theory and Small-World Networks, Chaos,\nBifurcations and Diffusion, Complexity and Information Theory, Random Boolean\nNetworks, Cellular Automata and Self-Organized Criticality, Darwinian\nevolution, Hypercycles and Game Theory, Synchronization Phenomena and Elements\nof Cognitive System Theory.\n", "  A precise measurement of the cross section of the process\n$e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-(\\gamma)$ from threshold to an energy of 3GeV is obtained\nwith the initial-state radiation (ISR) method using 232fb$^{-1}$ of data\ncollected with the BaBar detector at $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energies near\n10.6GeV. The ISR luminosity is determined from a study of the leptonic process\n$e^+e^-\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-(\\gamma)\\gamma_{\\rm ISR}$, which is found to agree with the\nnext-to-leading-order QED prediction to within 1.1%. The cross section for the\nprocess $e^+e^-\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-(\\gamma)$ is obtained with a systematic uncertainty\nof 0.5% in the dominant $\\rho$ resonance region. The leading-order hadronic\ncontribution to the muon magnetic anomaly calculated using the measured\n$\\pi\\pi$ cross section from threshold to 1.8GeV is $(514.1 \\pm 2.2({\\rm stat})\n\\pm 3.1({\\rm syst}))\\times 10^{-10}$.\n", "  The Magellanic Cloud System (MCS) interacts via tidal and drag forces with\nthe Milky Way galaxy. Using the Parkes Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) of atomic\nhydrogen we explore the role of drag on the evolution of the so-called Leading\nArm (LA). We present a new image recognition algorithm that allows us to\ndifferentiate features within a 3-D data cube (longitude, latitude, radial\nvelocity) and to parameterize individual coherent structures. We compiled an HI\nobject catalog of LA objects within an area of 70 degr x 85 degr (1.6 sr) of\nthe LA region. This catalog comprises information of location, column density,\nline width, shape and asymmetries of the individual LA objects above the\n4-sigma threshold of Delta T_b simeq 200 mK. We present evidence of a fourth\narm segment (LA4). For all LA objects we find an inverse correlation of\nvelocities v_GSR in Galactic Standard of Rest frame with Magellanic longitude.\nHigh-mass objects tend to have higher radial velocities than low-mass ones.\nAbout 1/4 of all LA objects can be characterized as head-tail (HT) structures.\nUsing image recognition with objective criteria, it is feasible to isolate most\nof LA emission from the diffuse Milky Way HI gas. Some blended gas components\n(we estimate 5%) escape detection, but we find a total gas content of the LA\nthat is about 50% higher than previously assumed. These methods allow the\ndeceleration of the LA clouds to be traced towards the Milky Way disk by drag\nforces. The derived velocity gradient strongly supports the assumption that the\nwhole LA originates entirely in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). LA4 is\nobserved opposite to LA1, and we propose that both arms are related, spanning\nabout 52kpc in space. HT structures trace drag forces even at tens of kpc\naltitudes above the Milky Way disk.\n", "  Our goal is to interpret the energy equation from Doubly Special Relativity\n(DSR) of Magueijo-Smolin with an invariant Planck energy scale in order to\nobtain the speed of light with an explicit dependence on the background\ntemperature of the expanding universe. We also investigate how other universal\nconstants, including the fine structure constant, have varied since the early\nuniverse and, thus, how they have evoluted over the cosmological time related\nto the temperature of the expanding universe. For instance, we show that both\nthe Planck constant and the electron charge were also too large in the early\nuniverse. However, we finally conclude that the fine structure constant has\nremained invariant with the age and temperature of the universe, which is in\nagreement with laboratory tests and some observational data.\n", "  We use density functional theory to describe the phase behaviors of rigid\nmolecules. The construction of kernel function G(x, P, x, P) is discussed.\nExcluded-volume potential is calculated for two types of molecules with C_{2v}\nsymmetry. Molecular symmetries lead to the symmetries of G and density function\nf(P), enabling a reduction of configuration space. By approximating G with a\npolynomial, the system can be fully characterized by some moments corresponding\nto the form of G. The symmetries of G determine the form of the polynomial,\nwhile the coefficients are determined by temperature and molecular parameters.\nThe analysis of the impact of coefficients helps us to choose independent\nvariables in the moments as order parameters. Order parameters for bent-core\nmolecules are predicted.\n", "  An update of the ALEPH non-strange spectral functions from hadronic $\\tau$\ndecays is presented. Compared to the 2005 ALEPH publication, the main\nimprovement is related to the use of a new method to unfold the measured mass\nspectra from detector effects. This procedure also corrects a previous problem\nin the correlations between the unfolded mass bins. Results from QCD studies\nand for the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the\nanomalous muon magnetic moment are derived using the new spectral functions.\nThey are found in agreement with published results based on the previous set of\nspectral functions.\n", "  The asymptotic behavior of the first eigenvalues of magnetic Laplacian\noperators with large magnetic fields and Neumann realization in smooth\nthree-dimensional domains is characterized by model problems inside the domain\nor on its boundary. In two-dimensional polygonal domains, a new set of model\nproblems on sectors has to be taken into account. In this paper, we consider\nthe class of general corner domains. In dimension 3, they include as particular\ncases polyhedra and axisymmetric cones. We attach model problems not only to\neach point of the closure of the domain, but also to a hierarchy of \"tangent\nsubstructures\" associated with singular chains. We investigate properties of\nthese model problems, namely continuity, semi-continuity, existence of\ngeneralized eigenfunctions satisfying exponential decay. We prove estimates for\nthe remainders of our asymptotic formula. Lower bounds are obtained with the\nhelp of an IMS partition based on adequate two-scale coverings of the corner\ndomain, whereas upper bounds are established by a novel construction of\nquasimodes, qualified as sitting or sliding according to spectral properties of\nlocal model problems. A part of our analysis extends to any dimension.\n", "  We have fabricated 2024 pixel microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID)\narrays in the ultraviolet/optical/near-IR (UVOIR) regime that are currently in\nuse in astronomical instruments. In order to make MKIDs desirable for novel\ninstruments, larger arrays with nearly perfect yield need to be fabricated. As\narray size increases, however, the percent yield often decreases due to\nfrequency collisions in the readout. The per-pixel performance must also be\nimproved, namely the energy resolution. We are investigating ways to reduce\nfrequency collisions and to improve the per pixel performance of our devices\nthrough new superconducting material systems and fabrication techniques. There\nare two main routes that we are currently exploring. First, we are attempting\nto create more uniform titanium nitride films through the use of atomic layer\ndeposition rather than the more traditional sputtering method. In addition, we\nare experimenting with completely new material systems for MKIDs, such as\nplatinum silicide.\n", "  Degradable quantum channels are an important class of completely positive\ntrace-preserving maps. Among other properties, they offer a single-letter\nformula for the quantum and the private classical capacity and are\ncharacterized by the fact that a complementary channel can be obtained from the\nchannel by applying a degrading channel. In this work we introduce the concept\nof approximate degradable channels, which satisfy this condition up to some\nfinite $\\varepsilon\\geq0$. That is, there exists a degrading channel which upon\ncomposition with the channel is $\\varepsilon$-close in the diamond norm to the\ncomplementary channel. We show that for any fixed channel the smallest such\n$\\varepsilon$ can be efficiently determined via a semidefinite program.\nMoreover, these approximate degradable channels also approximately inherit all\nother properties of degradable channels. As an application, we derive improved\nupper bounds to the quantum and private classical capacity for certain channels\nof interest in quantum communication.\n", "  In this paper, we identify a many-particle phonon expectation value $\\zeta$\nwith the ability to induce collective dynamics in a non-interacting atomic gas\ninside an optical cavity. We then propose to utilise this expectation value to\nenhance the laser cooling of many atoms through a cyclic two-stage process\nwhich consists of cooling and displacement stages. During cooling stages, short\nlaser pulses are applied. These use $\\zeta$ as a resource and decrease the\nvibrational energy of the atomic gas by a fixed amount. Subsequent displacement\nstages use the asymmetry of the trapping potential to replenish the\nmany-particle phonon expectation value $\\zeta$. Alternating both stages of the\ncooling process is shown to transfer the atomic gas to a final temperature\nwhich vanishes in the infinitely-many particle limit.\n", "  This work analyses the temporal coherence and correlation of\ncounterpropagating twin photons generated in a quasi-phase matched nonlinear\ncristal by spontaneous parametric-down conversion. We find out different\npictures depending on the pump pulse duration relative to two characteristic\ntemporal scales, determined respectively by the temporal separation between the\ncounter-propagating and the co-propagating wavepackets. When the pump duration\nis intermediate between the two scales, we show a transition from a highly\nentangled state to an almost separable state, with strongly asymmetric spectral\nproperties of the photons.\n", "  The existing experiments and simulations suggest that the molecular symmetry\nis always transmitted to homogeneous phases in liquid crystals. It has been\nproved for rod-like molecules. We conjecture that it holds for three other\nsymmetries, and prove it for some molecules of these symmetries.\n", "  A time evolution model was developed to study fuel burnup for the TRIGA Mark\nII reactor at the University of Pavia. The results were used to predict the\neffects of a complete core reconfiguration and the accuracy of this prediction\nwas tested experimentally. We used the Monte Carlo code MCNP5 to reproduce\nsystem neutronics in different operating conditions and to analyse neutron\nfluxes in the reactor core. The software that took care of time evolution,\ncompletely designed in-house, used the neutron fluxes obtained by MCNP5 to\nevaluate fuel consumption. This software was developed specifically to keep\ninto account some features that differentiate experimental reactors from power\nones, such as the daily ON/OFF cycle and the long fuel lifetime. These effects\ncan not be neglected to properly account for neutron poison accumulation. We\nevaluated the effect of 48 years of reactor operation and predicted a possible\nnew configuration for the reactor core: the objective was to remove some of the\nfuel elements from the core and to obtain a substantial increase in the Core\nExcess reactivity value. The evaluation of fuel burnup and the reconfiguration\nresults are presented in this paper.\n", "  We classify all possible fractional charge vortices of charge less than unity\nin spin-1 and spin-2 polar and cyclic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with\nzero magnetization. Statics and dynamics of these vortices in\nquasi-two-dimensional spinor BECs are studied employing accurate numerical\nsolution and a Lagrange variational approximation. The results for density and\ncollective-mode oscillation are illustrated using fractional-charge BEC vortex\nof $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb atoms with realistic interaction and trapping\npotential parameters.\n", "  Matter-wave interferometry is a direct test of the quantum superposition\nprinciple for massive systems, and of collapse models. Here we show that the\nbounds placed by matter-wave interferometry depend weakly on the details of the\ncollapse mechanism. Specifically, we compute the bounds on the CSL model and\nits variants, provided by the the KDTL interferometry experiment of Arndt's\ngroup [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2013, 15, 14696-14700], which currently holds\nthe record of largest mass in interferometry.\n  We also show that the CSL family of models emerges naturally by considering a\nminimal set of assumptions. In particular, we construct the dynamical map for\nthe colored and dissipative Continuous Spontaneous Localization (cdCSL) model,\nwhich reduces to the CSL model and variants in the appropriate limits. In\naddition, we discuss the measure of macroscopicity based on the cdCSL model.\n", "  We propose a general framework of computing interfacial structures between\ntwo modulated phases. Specifically we propose to use a computational box\nconsisting of two half spaces, each occupied by a modulated phase with given\nposition and orientation. The boundary conditions and basis functions are\nchosen to be commensurate with the bulk structures. It is observed that the\nordered nature of modulated structures stabilizes the interface, which enables\nus to obtain optimal interfacial structures by searching local minima of the\nfree energy landscape. The framework is applied to the Landau-Brazovskii model\nto investigate interfaces between modulated phases with different relative\npositions and orientations. Several types of novel complex interfacial\nstructures are obtained from the calculations.\n", "  Approximate eigenpairs (quasimodes) of axisymmetric thin elastic domains with\nlaterally clamped boundary conditions (Lam{\\'e} system) are determined by an\nasymptotic analysis as the thickness ($2\\varepsilon$) tends to zero. The\ndeparting point is the Koiter shell model that we reduce by asymptotic analysis\nto a scalar modelthat depends on two parameters: the angular frequency $k$ and\nthe half-thickness $\\varepsilon$. Optimizing $k$ for each chosen $\\varepsilon$,\nwe find power laws for $k$ in function of $\\varepsilon$ that provide the\nsmallest eigenvalues of the scalar reductions.Corresponding eigenpairs generate\nquasimodes for the 3D Lam{\\'e} system by means of several reconstruction\noperators, including boundary layer terms. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat in many cases the constructed eigenpair corresponds to the first eigenpair\nof the Lam{\\'e} system.Geometrical conditions are necessary to this approach:\nThe Gaussian curvature has to be nonnegative and the azimuthal curvature has to\ndominate the meridian curvature in any point of the midsurface. In this case,\nthe first eigenvector admits progressively larger oscillation in the angular\nvariable as $\\varepsilon$ tends to $0$. Its angular frequency exhibits a power\nlaw relationof the form $k=\\gamma \\varepsilon^{-\\beta}$ with $\\beta=\\frac14$ in\nthe parabolic case (cylinders and trimmed cones), and the various $\\beta$s\n$\\frac25$, $\\frac37$, and $\\frac13$ in the elliptic case.For these cases where\nthe mathematical analysis is applicable, numerical examples that illustrate the\ntheoretical results are presented.\n", "  In 1932, Dirac proposed a formulation in terms of multi-time wave functions\nas candidate for relativistic many-particle quantum mechanics. A well-known\nconsistency condition that is necessary for existence of solutions strongly\nrestricts the possible interaction types between the particles. It was\nconjectured by Petrat and Tumulka that interactions described by multiplication\noperators are generally excluded by this condition, and they gave a proof of\nthis claim for potentials without spin-coupling. Under smoothness assumptions\nof possible solutions we show that there are potentials which are admissible,\ngive an explicit example, however, show that none of them fulfills the\nphysically desirable Poincar\\'e invariance. We conclude that in this sense\nDirac's multi-time formalism does not allow to model interaction by\nmultiplication operators, and briefly point out several promising approaches to\ninteracting models one can instead pursue.\n", "  We study Bethe vectors of integrable models based on the super-Yangian\n$Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$. Starting from the super-trace formula, we exhibit\nrecursion relations for these vectors in the case of $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1))$\nand $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(1|2))$. These recursion relations allow to get explicit\nexpressions for the Bethe vectors. Using an antimorphism of the super-Yangian\n$Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$, we also construct a super-trace formula for dual Bethe\nvectors, and, for $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1))$ and $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(1|2))$\nsuper-Yangians, show recursion relations for them. Again, the latter allow us\nto get explicit expressions for dual Bethe vectors.\n", "  Yang-Baxter type models are integrable deformations of integrable field\ntheories, such as the principal chiral model on a Lie group $G$ or\n$\\sigma$-models on (semi-)symmetric spaces $G/F$. The deformation has the\neffect of breaking the global $G$-symmetry of the original model, replacing the\nassociated set of conserved charges by ones whose Poisson brackets are those of\nthe $q$-deformed Poisson-Hopf algebra $\\mathscr U_q(\\mathfrak g)$. Working at\nthe Hamiltonian level, we show how this $q$-deformed Poisson algebra originates\nfrom a Poisson-Lie $G$-symmetry. The theory of Poisson-Lie groups and their\nactions on Poisson manifolds, in particular the formalism of the non-abelian\nmoment map, is reviewed. For a coboundary Poisson-Lie group $G$, this\nnon-abelian moment map must obey the Semenov-Tian-Shansky bracket on the dual\ngroup $G^*$, up to terms involving central quantities. When the latter vanish,\nwe develop a general procedure linking this Poisson bracket to the defining\nrelations of the Poisson-Hopf algebra $\\mathscr U_q(\\mathfrak g)$, including\nthe $q$-Poisson-Serre relations. We consider reality conditions leading to $q$\nbeing either real or a phase. We determine the non-abelian moment map for\nYang-Baxter type models. This enables to compute the corresponding action of\n$G$ on the fields parametrising the phase space of these models.\n", "  We present a new nanoscale superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) whose interference pattern can be shifted electrically in-situ. The\ndevice consists of a nanoscale four-terminal/four-junction SQUID fabricated at\nthe apex of a sharp pipette using a self-aligned three-step deposition of Pb.\nIn contrast to conventional two-terminal/two-junction SQUIDs that display\noptimal sensitivity when flux biased to about a quarter of the flux quantum,\nthe additional terminals and junctions allow optimal sensitivity at arbitrary\napplied flux, thus eliminating the magnetic field \"blind spots\". We demonstrate\nspin sensitivity of 5 to 8 $\\mu_B/\\text{Hz}^{1/2}$ over a continuous field\nrange of 0 to 0.5 T, with promising applications for nanoscale scanning\nmagnetic imaging.\n", "  We revisit the construction of deformed Virasoro algebras from elliptic\nquantum algebras of vertex type, generalizing the bilinear trace procedure\nproposed in the 90's. It allows us to make contact with the vertex operator\ntechniques that were introduced separately at the same period. As a by-product,\nthe method pinpoints two critical values of the central charge for which the\ncenter of the algebra is extended, as well as (in the $gl(2)$ case) a Liouville\nformula.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a semisimple Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$. Let $\\nu\n\\in \\text{Aut}\\, \\mathfrak{g}$ be a diagram automorphism whose order divides $T\n\\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 1}$. We define cyclotomic $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers over the\nRiemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$ as gauge equivalence classes of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$-valued connections of a certain form, equivariant under actions\nof the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}/ T\\mathbb{Z}$ on $\\mathfrak{g}$ and\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$. It reduces to the usual notion of $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers when $T\n= 1$.\n  We also extend the notion of Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers to the cyclotomic\nsetting. To any cyclotomic Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-oper $\\nabla$ we associate a\ncorresponding cyclotomic $\\mathfrak{g}$-oper. Let $\\nabla$ have residue at the\norigin given by a $\\nu$-invariant rational dominant coweight\n$\\check{\\lambda}_0$ and be monodromy-free on a cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$. We\nprove that the subset of all cyclotomic Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers associated\nwith the same cyclotomic $\\mathfrak{g}$-oper as $\\nabla$ is isomorphic to the\n$\\vartheta$-invariant subset of the full flag variety of the adjoint group $G$\nof $\\mathfrak{g}$, where the automorphism $\\vartheta$ depends on $\\nu$, $T$ and\n$\\check{\\lambda}_0$. The big cell of the latter is isomorphic to $N^\\vartheta$,\nthe $\\vartheta$-invariant subgroup of the unipotent subgroup $N \\subset G$,\nwhich we identify with those cyclotomic Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers whose\nresidue at the origin is the same as that of $\\nabla$. In particular, the\ncyclotomic generation procedure recently introduced in [arXiv:1505.07582] is\ninterpreted as taking $\\nabla$ to other cyclotomic Miura $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers\ncorresponding to elements of $N^\\vartheta$ associated with simple root\ngenerators.\n  We motivate the introduction of cyclotomic $\\mathfrak{g}$-opers by\nformulating two conjectures which relate them to the cyclotomic Gaudin model of\n[arXiv:1409.6937].\n", "  We study the correlation between the distributions of the net-charge,\nnet-kaon, net-baryon and net-proton number at hadronization and after the final\nhadronic decoupling by simulating ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions with\nthe hybrid version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel. We find that due to the hadronic rescattering these distributions are\nnot strongly correlated. The calculated change of the correlation, during the\nhadronic expansion stage, does not support the recent paradigm, namely that the\nmeasured final moments of the experimentally observed distributions do give\ndirectly the values of those distributions at earlier times, when the system\nhad been closer to the QCD crossover.\n", "  It is often presumed, that life evolves relatively fast on planets with\nclement conditions, at least in its basic forms, and that extended periods of\nhabitability are subsequently needed for the evolution of higher life forms.\nMany planets are however expected to be only transiently habitable. On a large\nset of otherwise suitable planets life will therefore just not have the time to\ndevelop on its own to a complexity level as it did arise on earth with the\ncambrian explosion. The equivalent of a cambrian explosion may however have the\nchance to unfold on transiently habitable planets if it would be possible to\nfast forward evolution by 3-4 billion years (with respect to terrestrial\ntimescales). We argue here, that this is indeed possible when seeding the\ncandidate planet with the microbial lifeforms, bacteria and unicellular\neukaryotes alike, characterizing earth before the cambrian explosion. An\ninterstellar mission of this kind, denoted the `Genesis project', could be\ncarried out by a relatively low-cost robotic microcraft equipped with a\non-board gene laboratory for the in situ synthesis of the microbes.\n  We review here our current understanding of the processes determining the\ntimescales shaping the geo-evolution of an earth-like planet, the prospect of\nfinding Genesis candidate planets and selected issues regarding the mission\nlayout. Discussing the ethical aspects connected with a Genesis mission, which\nwould be expressively not for human benefit, we will also touch the risk that a\nbiosphere incompatibility may arise in the wake of an eventual manned\nexploration of a second earth.\n", "  Could tidal dissipation within Enceladus' subsurface ocean account for the\nobserved heat flow? Earthlike models of dynamical tides give no definitive\nanswer because they neglect the influence of the crust. I propose here the\nfirst model of dissipative tides in a subsurface ocean, by combining the\nLaplace Tidal Equations with the membrane approach. For the first time, it is\npossible to compute tidal dissipation rates within the crust, ocean, and mantle\nin one go. I show that oceanic dissipation is strongly reduced by the crustal\nconstraint, and thus contributes little to Enceladus' present heat budget.\nTidal resonances could have played a role in a forming or freezing ocean less\nthan 100 m deep. The model is general: it applies to all icy satellites with a\nthin crust and a shallow ocean. Scaling rules relate the resonances and\ndissipation rate of a subsurface ocean to the ones of a surface ocean. If the\nocean has low viscosity, the westward obliquity tide does not move the crust.\nTherefore, crustal dissipation due to dynamical obliquity tides can differ from\nthe static prediction by up to a factor of two.\n", "  Quasiclassical dynamics of trapped ions is characterized by applying the time\ndependent variational principle (TDVP) on coherent state orbits, in case of\nquadrupole and octupole combined (Paul and Penning) and radiofrequency (RF)\ntraps. A dequantization algorithm is proposed, by which the classical Hamilton\n(energy) function associated to the system results as the expectation value of\nthe quantum Hamiltonian on squeezed coherent states. We develop such method and\nparticularize the quantum Hamiltonian for a combined and for a RF trap, with\naxial symmetry and a RF anharmonic electric potential. We also build the\nclassical Hamiltonian functions for the particular traps we considered, and\nfind the classical equations of motion.\n", "  Quantum dots in GaAs/InGaAs structures have been proposed as a candidate\nsystem for realizing quantum computing. The short coherence time of the\nelectronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the\nsubstrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic\nfield and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking:\nOscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced,\nwhile off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant\nfrequencies are determined by the pulsing frequency only, the system becomes\nimmune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight\nvariations between individual quantum dots. The effects remain even after the\noptical pulsing is terminated. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of mode\nlocking from a quantum mechanical perspective. We treat the dynamics using the\ncentral spin model, which includes coupling to 10-20 nuclei and incoherent\ndecay of the excited electronic state, in a perturbative framework. Using\nscaling arguments, we extrapolate our results to realistic system parameters.\nWe find that the synchronization to the pulsing frequency needs time scales in\nthe order of 1 s.\n", "  Here, we present an overview of recent developments in the characterization\nof electromagnetic and quantum metamaterials using effective medium methods. It\nis highlighted that both electromagnetic and electronic systems can be\nhomogenized in a unified manner based on the introduction of an effective\nHamiltonian operator that describes the time evolution of the macroscopic\ninitial states as well as the stationary states of the relevant system.\nFurthermore, it is shown that in some circumstances quadratic forms of the\nfields, such as the energy, can be exactly determined using the effective\nmedium theory.\n", "  We prove that a system of $N$ fermions interacting with an additional\nparticle via point interactions is stable if the ratio of the mass of the\nadditional particle to the one of the fermions is larger than some critical\n$m^*$. The value of $m^*$ is independent of $N$ and turns out to be less than\n$1$. This fact has important implications for the stability of the unitary\nFermi gas. We also characterize the domain of the Hamiltonian of this model,\nand establish the validity of the Tan relations for all wave functions in the\ndomain.\n", "  Artificial neural networks and machine learning have now reached a new era\nafter several decades of improvement where applications are to explode in many\nfields of science, industry, and technology. Here, we use artificial neural\nnetworks to study an intriguing phenomenon in quantum physics--- the\ntopological phases of matter. We find that certain topological states, either\nsymmetry-protected or with intrinsic topological order, can be represented with\nclassical artificial neural networks. This is demonstrated by using three\nconcrete spin systems, the one-dimensional (1D) symmetry-protected topological\ncluster state and the 2D and 3D toric code states with intrinsic topological\norders. For all three cases we show rigorously that the topological ground\nstates can be represented by short-range neural networks in an \\textit{exact}\nand \\textit{efficient} fashion---the required number of hidden neurons is as\nsmall as the number of physical spins and the number of parameters scales only\n\\textit{linearly} with the system size. For the 2D toric-code model, we find\nthat the proposed short-range neural networks can describe the excited states\nwith abelain anyons and their nontrivial mutual statistics as well. In\naddition, by using reinforcement learning we show that neural networks are\ncapable of finding the topological ground states of non-integrable Hamiltonians\nwith strong interactions and studying their topological phase transitions. Our\nresults demonstrate explicitly the exceptional power of neural networks in\ndescribing topological quantum states, and at the same time provide valuable\nguidance to machine learning of topological phases in generic lattice models.\n", "  In this paper we use the language of real meromorphic differentials from the\ntheory of Klein surfaces to describe the metastable states of multiply\nconnected planar ferromagnetic nanoelements which minimize the exchange energy\nand have no side magnetic charges. Those solutions still have enough internal\ndegrees of freedom which may serve as the Ritz parameters for minimization of\nfurther relevant energy terms or as the dynamical variables for the adiabatic\napproach. The nontrivial topology of the magnet itself brings us to several\neffects first described for the annulus and observed in the experiment. We\nexplain the topological constraints on the numbers of vortexes and antivortexes\nin the magnet, as well as the algebraic constraints on their positions which\nstem from the Abel's theorem. The use of multivalued Prym differentials bring\nus to new meron configurations which were not considered in the seminal work of\nD.J.Gross.\n", "  A Fe89.15Cr10.75 alloy in a heavily strained (by cold rolling) and\nstrain-relaxed states was studied by means of the conversion electrons\nM\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy (CEMS). Analysis of the spectra in terms of a\ntwo-shell model revealed significant differences between the studied samples,\nin particular, in values of the hyperfine field, a distribution of Cr atoms\nwithin the first two neighbor-shells, the latter was expressed in terms of the\nshort-range order parameters, and in the magnetic texture.\n", "  KaTie is a parton-level event generator for hadron scattering processes that\ncan deal with partonic initial-state momenta with an explicit transverse\nmomentum dependence causing them to be space-like. Provided with the necessary\ntransverse momentum dependent parton density functions, it calculates the\noff-shell matrix elements and performs the phase space importance sampling to\nproduce weighted events, for example in the Les Houches Event File format. It\ncan deal with arbitrary processes within the Standard Model, for up to four\nfinal-state particles and beyond. Furthermore, it can produce events for\nsingle-parton scattering as well as for multi-parton scattering.\n", "  We find Bethe vectors for quantum integrable models associated with the\nsupersymmetric Yangians $Y(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ in terms of the current\ngenerators of the Yangian double $DY(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$. More specifically,\nwe use the method of projections onto intersections of different type Borel\nsubalgebras in this infinite dimensional algebra to construct the Bethe\nvectors. Calculating these projection the supersymmetric Bethe vectors can be\nexpressed through matrix elements of the universal monodromy matrix elements.\nUsing two different but isomorphic current realizations of the Yangian double\n$DY(\\mathfrak{gl}(m|n))$ we obtain two different presentations for the Bethe\nvectors. These Bethe vectors are also shown to obey some recursion relations\nwhich prove their equivalence.\n", "  We discuss stability of Q-balls interacting with fermions in theory with\nsmall coupling constant g. We argue that for configurations with large global\nU(1)-charge Q the problem of classical stability becomes more subtle. For\nexample, in model with flat direction there is maximal value of charge for\nstable solutions with Q~1/g^4. We study origin of additional instability and\ndiscuss possible ways to avoid it.\n", "  We study ${\\Lambda}K^+$ pair production in the interaction of protons of 2.83\nGeV kinetic energy with C, Cu, Ag, and Au target nuclei in the framework of the\nnuclear spectral function approach for incoherent primary proton--nucleon and\nsecondary pion--nucleon production processes, and processes associated with the\ncreation of intermediate ${\\Sigma^0}K^+$ pairs. The approach accounts for the\ninitial proton and final $\\Lambda$ hyperon absorption, final $K^+$ meson\ndistortion in nuclei, target nucleon binding, and Fermi motion, as well as\nnuclear mean-field potential effects on these processes. We calculate the\n$\\Lambda$ momentum dependence of the absolute ${\\Lambda}K^+$ yield from the\ntarget nuclei considered, in the kinematical conditions of the ANKE experiment,\nperformed at COSY, within the different scenarios for the $\\Lambda$-nucleus\neffective scalar potential. We show that the above observable is appreciably\nsensitive to this potential in the low-momentum region. Therefore, direct\ncomparison of the results of our calculations with the data from the\nANKE-at-COSY experiment can help to determine the above potential at finite\nmomenta. We also demonstrate that the two-step pion--nucleon production\nchannels dominate in the low-momentum ${\\Lambda}K^+$ production in the chosen\nkinematics and, therefore, they have to be taken into account in the analysis\nof these data.\n", "  In the light of the latest data by LHCf collaboration of the LHC on leading\nneutrons spectra it is possible to obtain total pion-proton cross-sections in\nthe TeV energy region. In this work the exact extraction procedure is shown.\nFinal numbers for the pion-proton cross-section are collected at several\ndifferent values of the colliding energy and compared with some popular\ntheoretical predictions. Errors of results are estimated.\n", "  The understanding of the macroscopic phenomenological models of the\npopulation growth at a microscopic level is important to predict the population\nbehaviors emerged from the interactions between the individuals. In this work\nwe consider the influence of the cell-cell interaction on the population growth\nrate $R$ in a tumor system, and show that, in most cases especially small\nproliferative probabilities, the regulative role of the interaction will be\nstrengthened with the decline of the intrinsic proliferative probabilities. For\nthe high replication rates of an individual and the cooperative interactions,\nthe proliferative probability almost has no effect. We compute the dependences\nof $R$ on the interactions between the cells under the approximation of the\nnearest neighbor in the rim of an avascular tumor. Our results are helpful to\nqualitatively understand the influence of the interactions between the\nindividuals on the growth rate in population systems.\n", "  The defining characteristic of the cold dark matter (CDM) hypothesis is the\npresence of a very large number of low-mass haloes, too small to have made a\nvisible galaxy. Other hypotheses for the nature of the dark matter, such as\nwarm dark matter (WDM), predict a much smaller number of such low-mass haloes.\nStrong lensing systems offer the possibility of detecting small-mass haloes\nthrough the distortions they induce in the lensed image. Here we show that the\nmain contribution to the image distortions comes from haloes along the line of\nsight rather than subhaloes in the lens as has normally been assumed so far.\nThese interlopers enhance the differences between the predictions of CDM and\nWDM models. We derive the total perturber mass function, including both\nsubhaloes and interlopers, and show that measurements of approximately 20\nstrong lens systems with a detection limit of $M_{\\rm low}=10^7 h^{-1}\nM_{\\odot}$ would distinguish (at 3 sigma) between CDM and a WDM model\nconsisting of 7 keV sterile neutrinos such as those required to explain the\nrecently detected 3.5 keV X-ray emission line from the centres of galaxies and\nclusters.\n", "  Although all superconducting cuprates display charge-ordering tendencies,\ntheir low-temperature properties are distinct, impeding efforts to understand\nthe phenomena within a single conceptual framework. While some systems exhibit\nstripes of charge and spin, with a locked periodicity, others host charge\ndensity waves (CDWs) without any obviously related spin order. Here we use\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to follow the evolution of charge\ncorrelations in the canonical stripe ordered cuprate\nLa$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$ (LBCO~$1/8$) across its ordering transition.\nWe find that high-temperature charge correlations are unlocked from the\nwavevector of the spin correlations, signaling analogies to CDW phases in\nvarious other cuprates. This indicates that stripe order at low temperatures is\nstabilized by the coupling of otherwise independent charge and spin density\nwaves, with important implications for the relation between charge and spin\ncorrelations in the cuprates.\n", "  Boltzmann provided a scenario to explain why individual macroscopic systems\ncomposed of a large number $N$ of microscopic constituents are inevitably\n(i.e., with overwhelming probability) observed to approach a unique macroscopic\nstate of thermodynamic equilibrium, and why after having done so, they are then\nobserved to remain in that state, apparently forever. We provide here rigourous\nnew results that mathematically prove the basic features of Boltzmann's\nscenario for two classical models: a simple boundary-free model for the spatial\nhomogenization of a non-interacting gas of point particles, and the well-known\nKac ring model. Our results, based on concentration inequalities that go back\nto Hoeffding, and which focus on the typical behavior of individual macroscopic\nsystems, improve upon previous results by providing estimates, exponential in\n$N$, of probabilities and time scales involved.\n", "  We constrain cold dark energy of negligible sound speed using galaxy cluster\nabundance observations. In contrast to standard quasi-homogeneous dark energy,\nnegligible sound speed implies clustering of the dark energy fluid at all\nscales, allowing us to measure the effects of dark energy perturbations at\ncluster scales. We compare those models and set the stage for using non-linear\ninformation from semi-analytical modelling in cluster growth data analyses. For\nthis, we recalibrate the halo mass function with non-linear characteristic\nquantities, the spherical collapse threshold and virial overdensity, that\naccount for model and redshift dependent behaviours, as well as an additional\nmass contribution for cold dark energy. We present the first constraints from\nthis cold dark matter plus cold dark energy mass function using our cluster\nabundance likelihood, which self-consistently accounts for selection effects,\ncovariances and systematic uncertainties. We combine cluster growth data with\nCMB, SNe Ia and BAO data, and find a shift between cold versus\nquasi-homogeneous dark energy of up to $1\\sigma$. We make a Fisher matrix\nforecast of constraints attainable with cluster growth data from the on-going\nDark Energy Survey (DES). For DES, we predict $\\sim$50$\\%$ tighter constraints\non $\\left(\\Omega_\\mathrm{m},w \\right)$ for cold dark energy versus $w$CDM\nmodels, with the same free parameters. Overall, we show that cluster abundance\nanalyses are sensitive to cold dark energy, an alternative, viable model that\nshould be routinely investigated alongside the standard dark energy scenario.\n", "  Electrical generation and detection of pure spin currents without the need of\nmagnetic materials are key elements for the realization of full electrically\ncontrolled spintronic devices. In this framework, achieving a large\nspin-to-charge conversion signal is crucial, since considerable outputs are\nneeded for plausible applications. Unfortunately, the values obtained so far\nhave been rather low. Here we exploit the spin Hall effect by using Pt, a\nnon-magnetic metal with strong spin-orbit coupling, to generate and detect pure\nspin currents in a few-layer graphene channel. Furthermore, the outstanding\nproperties of graphene, with long distance spin transport and higher electrical\nresistivity than metals, allows us to achieve in our graphene/Pt lateral\nheterostructures the largest spin-to-charge voltage signal at room temperature\nreported so far in the literature. Our approach opens up exciting opportunities\ntowards the implementation of spin-orbit-based logic circuits and all\nelectrical control of spin information without magnetic field.\n", "  With a core-periphery structure of networks, core nodes are densely\ninterconnected, peripheral nodes are connected to core nodes to different\nextents, and peripheral nodes are sparsely interconnected. Core-periphery\nstructure composed of a single core and periphery has been identified for\nvarious networks. However, analogous to the observation that many empirical\nnetworks are composed of densely interconnected groups of nodes, i.e.,\ncommunities, a network may be better regarded as a collection of multiple cores\nand peripheries. We propose a scalable algorithm to detect multiple\nnon-overlapping groups of core-periphery structure in a network. We illustrate\nour algorithm using synthesised and empirical networks. For example, we find\ndistinct core-periphery pairs with different political leanings in a network of\npolitical blogs and separation between international and domestic subnetworks\nof airports in some single countries in a world-wide airport network.\n", "  In the present paper, we consider in detail the aspects of the Heisenberg's\nequations of motion, related to their transformation to the representation\ndependent of external sources. We provide with a closed solution as to the\nvariation-derivative motion equations in the general case of a normal form\n(symbol) chosen. We show that the action in the path integral does depend\nactually on a particular choice of a normal symbol. We have determined both the\naspects of the latter dependence: the specific boundary conditions for virtual\ntrajectories, and the specific boundary terms in the action.\n", "  While indirect & direct CP violations (CPV) had been established in the\ndecays of strange & beauty mesons, none have been done for baryons. There are\ndifferent \"roads\" for finding CP asymmetries in the decays of strange baryons;\nthey are highly non-trivial ones. The HyperCP Collaboration had probed CPV in\nthe decays of single $\\Xi$ & $\\Lambda$ [Phys.Rev.Lett 93 (2004) 262001]. We\ntalk about future lessons from $e^+e^-$ collisions at BESIII/BEPCII: probing\ndecays of pairs of strange baryons, namely $\\Lambda$, $\\Sigma$ & $\\Xi$.\nRealistic goals are to learn about non-perturbative QCD. One can hope to find\nCPV in the decays of strange baryons; one can also dream to find impact of New\nDynamics (ND). We point out that a new important era starts with the\nBESIII/BEPCII data accumulated by the end of 2018.\n", "  We investigate the partition function zeros of the two-dimensional $p$-state\nclock model in the complex temperature plane by using the Wang-Landau method.\nFor $p=5$, $6$, $8$, and $10$, we propose a modified energy representation to\nenumerate exact irregular energy levels for the density of states without any\nbinning artifacts. Comparing the leading zeros between different $p$'s, we\nprovide strong evidence that the upper transition at $p=6$ is indeed of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type in contrast to the claim of the\nprevious Fisher zero study [Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{80}, 042103 (2009)]. We find\nthat the leading zeros of $p=6$ at the upper transition collapse onto the zero\ntrajectories of the larger $p$'s including the $XY$ limit while the finite-size\nbehavior of $p=5$ differs from the converged behavior of $p \\ge 6$ within the\nsystem sizes examined. In addition, we argue that the nondivergent specific\nheat in the BKT transition is responsible for the small partition function\nmagnitude that decreases exponentially with increasing system size near the\nleading zero, fundamentally limiting access to large systems in search for\nzeros with an estimator under finite statistical fluctuations.\n", "  Due to their atomic-scale thickness, the resonances of 2D material membranes\nshow signatures of nonlinearities at amplitudes of only a few nanometers. While\nthe linear dynamics of membranes is well understood, the exact relation between\nthe nonlinear response and the resonator's material properties has remained\nelusive. In this work, we propose a method to determine the Young's modulus of\nsuspended 2D material membranes from their nonlinear dynamic response. The\nmethod is demonstrated by interferometric measurements on graphene and MoS2\nresonators, which are electrostatically driven into the nonlinear regime at\nmultiple driving forces. It is shown that a set of response curves can be\nfitted by the solutions of the Duffing equation using only one fit parameter,\nfrom which the Young's modulus is extracted using membrane theory. Our method\nis fast, contactless, and provides a platform for high-frequency\ncharacterization of the mechanical properties of 2D materials.\n", "  The Durham High Energy Physics Database (HEPData) has been built up over the\npast four decades as a unique open-access repository for scattering data from\nexperimental particle physics papers. It comprises data points underlying\nseveral thousand publications. Over the last two years, the HEPData software\nhas been completely rewritten using modern computing technologies as an overlay\non the Invenio v3 digital library framework. The software is open source with\nthe new site available at https://hepdata.net now replacing the previous site\nat http://hepdata.cedar.ac.uk. In this write-up, we describe the development of\nthe new site and explain some of the advantages it offers over the previous\nplatform.\n", "  Room-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor is vital in nonvolatile digital\ncircuits and it can provide an idea system where we can make use of both charge\nand spin of electrons. However, seeking room-temperature ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors is still just an appealing idea that has never been realized in\npractice up to now. Here we demonstrate that graphene monolayer, hybridized\nwith underlying Ni(111) substrate, is the room-temperature ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor that has been continuously searched for decades. Our\nspin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) experiments, complemented\nby first-principles calculations, demonstrate explicitly that the interaction\nbetween graphene and the Ni substrate generates a large gap in graphene and\nsimultaneously leads to a relatively shift between majority- and minority-spin\nbands. Consequently, the graphene sheet on the Ni substrate exhibits a\nspin-polarized gap with energy of several tens meV even at room-temperature.\nThis result makes the science and applications of room-temperature\nferromagnetic semiconductors achievable and raises hopes of graphene-based\nnovel information technologies.\n", "  Interfaces between complex oxides constitute a unique playground for 2D\nelectron systems (2DES), where superconductivity and magnetism can arise from\ncombinations of bulk insulators. The 2DES at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is one\nof the most studied in this regard, and its origin is determined by both the\npresence of a polar field in LaAlO3 and the insurgence of point defects, such\nas oxygen vacancies and intermixed cations. These defects usually reside in the\nconduction channel and are responsible for a decreased electronic mobility. In\nthis work we use an amorphous WO3 overlayer to control the defect formation and\nobtain an increased electron mobility and effective mass in WO3/LaAlO3/SrTiO3\nheterostructures. The studied system shows a sharp insulator-to-metal\ntransition as a function of both LaAlO3 and WO3 layer thickness.\nLow-temperature magnetotransport reveals a strong magnetoresistance reaching\n900% at 10 T and 1.5 K, the presence of multiple conduction channels with\ncarrier mobility up to 80 000 cm2/Vs and an unusually high effective mass of\n5.6 me. The amorphous character of the WO3 overlayer makes this a versatile\napproach for defect control at oxide interfaces, which could be applied to\nother heterestrostures disregarding the constraints imposed by crystal\nsymmetry.\n", "  Here, we study the electromagnetic response of asymmetric mushroom-type\nmetamaterials loaded with nonlinear elements. It is shown that near a Fano\nresonance these structures may have a strong tunable, bi-stable, and switchable\nresponse and enable giant nonlinear effects. Using an effective medium theory\nand full wave simulations, it is proven that the nonlinear elements may allow\nthe reflection and transmission coefficients to follow hysteresis loops, and to\nswitch the metamaterial between \"go\" and \"no-go\" states similar to an ideal\nelectromagnetic switch.\n", "  In this critical compilation, all known to us experimental data on the\nspectrum of neutral carbon were methodically evaluated and supplemented by\nparametric calculations with Cowan's code. The sources of experimental data\nvary from laboratory to astrophysical objects and employ different\ninstrumentation from classical grating and Fourier transform spectrometers to\nprecise laser spectroscopy setups and various other modern techniques. This\ncomprehensive evaluation provides accurate atomic data on energy levels and\nwavelengths (observed and Ritz) with their estimated uncertainties, as well as\na uniform description of observed line intensities. In total, 412 energy levels\nwere optimized with the help of selected 1221 best observed lines participating\nin 1365 transitions in the wavelength region 750 {\\AA} to 609.14 {\\mu}m. In\naddition, 737 possibly observable transitions are predicted. Critically\nevaluated transition probabilities for 1616 lines are provided, of which 241\nare new. With the accurate energy levels obtained, combined with additional\nobserved data on high Rydberg states, the ionization limit was determined to be\n90 820.348(9) cm^(-1) or 11.2602880(11) eV in fair agreement with the\npreviously recommended value, but more accurate.\n", "  An exact reduced dynamical map along with its operator sum representation is\nderived for a central spin interacting with a thermal spin environment. The\ndynamics of the central spin shows high sustainability of quantum traits such\nas coherence and entanglement in the low-temperature regime. However, for\nsufficiently high temperature and when the number of bath particles approaches\nthe thermodynamic limit, this feature vanishes and the dynamics closely mimics\nMarkovian evolution. The properties of the long-time-averaged state and the\ntrapped information of the initial state for the central qubit are also\ninvestigated in detail, confirming that the nonergodicity of the dynamics can\nbe attributed to the finite temperature and finite size of the bath. It is\nshown that if a certain stringent resonance condition is satisfied, the\nlong-time-averaged state retains quantum coherence, which can have far reaching\ntechnological implications in engineering quantum devices. An exact time-local\nmaster equation of the canonical form is derived. With the help of this master\nequation, the nonequilibrium properties of the central spin system are studied\nby investigating the detailed balance condition and irreversible entropy\nproduction rate. The result reveals that the central qubit thermalizes only in\nthe limit of very high temperature and large number of bath spins.\n", "  The two-dimensional extension of the one-dimensional PDM-Lagrangians and\ntheir nonlocal point transformation mappings into constant unit-mass exactly\nsolvable Lagrangians is introduced. The conditions on the related\ntwo-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations' invariance are reported. The mappings\nfrom superintegrable linear oscillators into sub-superintegrable nonlinear\nPDM-oscillators are exemplified by, (i) a sub-superintegrable\nMathews-Lakshmanan type-I PDM-oscillator, for a PDM-particle moving in a\nharmonic oscillator potential, (ii) a sub-superintegrable Mathews-Lakshmanan\ntype-II PDM-oscillator, for a PDM-particle moving in a constant potential, and\n(iii) a sub-superintegrable shifted Mathews-Lakshmanan type-III PDM-oscillator,\nfor a PDM-particle moving in a shifted harmonic oscillator potential. Moreover,\nthe superintegrable shifted linear oscillators and the isotonic oscillators are\nmapped into a sub-superintegrable PDM-nonlinear and a sub-superintegrable\nPDM-isotonic oscillators, respectively.\n", "  We characterize the neutron output of a deuterium-deuterium plasma fusion\nneutron generator, model 35-DD-W-S, manufactured by NSD/Gradel-Fusion. The\nmeasured energy spectrum is found to be dominated by neutron peaks at 2.2 MeV\nand 2.7 MeV. A detailed GEANT4 simulation accurately reproduces the measured\nenergy spectrum and confirms our understanding of the fusion process in this\ngenerator. Additionally, a contribution of 14.1 MeV neutrons from\ndeuterium-tritium fusion is found at a level of~$3.5\\%$, from tritium produced\nin previous deuterium-deuterium reactions. We have measured both the absolute\nneutron flux as well as its relative variation on the operational parameters of\nthe generator. We find the flux to be proportional to voltage $V^{3.32 \\pm\n0.14}$ and current $I^{0.97 \\pm 0.01}$. Further, we have measured the angular\ndependence of the neutron emission with respect to the polar angle. We conclude\nthat it is well described by isotropic production of neutrons within the\ncathode field cage.\n", "  While the accumulation of long wavelength modes during inflation wreaks havoc\non the large scale structure of spacetime, the question of even observability\nof their presence by any local observer has lead to considerable confusion.\nThough it is commonly agreed that infrared effects are not visible to a single\nsub-horizon observer at late times, we argue that the question is less trivial\nfor a \\emph{patient observer} who has lived long enough to have a record of the\nstate before the soft mode was created. Though classically there is no\nobstruction to measuring this effect locally, we give several indications that\nquantum mechanical uncertainties censor the effect, rendering the observation\nof long modes ultimately forbidden.\n", "  Efficient communication between qubits relies on robust networks which allow\nfor fast and coherent transfer of quantum information. It seems natural to\nharvest the remarkable properties of systems characterized by topological\ninvariants to perform this task. Here we show that a linear network of coupled\nbosonic degrees of freedom, characterized by topological bands, can be employed\nfor the efficient exchange of quantum information over large distances.\nImportant features of our setup are that it is robust against quenched\ndisorder, all relevant operations can be performed by global variations of\nparameters, and the time required for communication between distant qubits\napproaches linear scaling with their distance. We demonstrate that our concept\ncan be extended to an ensemble of qubits embedded in a two-dimensional network\nto allow for communication between all of them.\n", "  In the canonical approach to quantization of gravity, one often uses\nrelational clock variables and an interpretation in terms of conditional\nprobabilities to overcome the problem of time. In this essay we show that these\nsuffer from serious conceptual issues.\n", "  We introduce and physically motivate the following problem in geometric\ncombinatorics, originally inspired by analysing Bell inequalities. A\ngrasshopper lands at a random point on a planar lawn of area one. It then jumps\nonce, a fixed distance $d$, in a random direction. What shape should the lawn\nbe to maximise the chance that the grasshopper remains on the lawn after\njumping? We show that, perhaps surprisingly, a disc shaped lawn is not optimal\nfor any $d>0$. We investigate further by introducing a spin model whose ground\nstate corresponds to the solution of a discrete version of the grasshopper\nproblem. Simulated annealing and parallel tempering searches are consistent\nwith the hypothesis that for $ d < \\pi^{-1/2}$ the optimal lawn resembles a\ncogwheel with $n$ cogs, where the integer $n$ is close to $ \\pi ( \\arcsin (\n\\sqrt{\\pi} d /2 ) )^{-1}$. We find transitions to other shapes for $d \\gtrsim\n\\pi^{-1/2}$.\n", "  Optical quantum protocols are reliant on the production of highly pure single\nphotons. However, most parametric heralded single photon sources possess\nspectral correlations, limiting the purity of the produced photon. The most\ncommon method for restoring the purity is with narrowband spectral filtering,\nwhich comes at the cost of reducing the rate of heralding detection. Here, we\ncharacterize this trade-off analytically for a large class of parametric\nsources. It is possible to achieve up to 20% heralding success probabilities\nwith 90% heralded photon purities.\n", "  For explicitly time depending mass density, which satisfies a continuity\nequation, it is shown that Maxwell-like equations for gravitational field\nfollow naturally without any need of General Relativity Theory approximation or\nrelated assumptions. As a consequences, it is shown that several features\nalready known in Electrodynamics (Poynting vector, density of energy, tensor\nstress, radiation) are totally reproduced for gravitational field.\n", "  The relevance of two-dimensional three-components (2D3C) flows goes well\nbeyond their occurrence in nature, and a deeper understanding of their dynamics\nmight be also helpful in order to shed further light on the dynamics of pure\ntwo-dimenional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) flows and vice versa. The purpose\nof the present paper is to make a step in this direction through a combination\nof numerical and analytical work. The analytical part is mainly concerned with\nthe behavior of 2D3C flows in isolation and the connection between the geometry\nof the nonlinear interactions and the resulting energy transfer directions.\nSpecial emphasis is given to the role of helicity. We show that a generic 2D3C\nflow can be described by two stream functions corresponding to the two helical\nsectors of the velocity field. The projection onto one helical sector\n(homochiral flow) leads to a full 3D constraint and to the inviscid\nconservation of the total (three dimensional) enstrophy and hence to an inverse\ncascade of the kinetic energy of the third component also. The coupling between\nseveral 2D3C flows is studied through a set of suitably designed direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS), where we also explore the transition between 2D\nand fully 3D turbulence. In particular, we find that the coupling of three 2D3C\nflows on mutually orthogonal planes subject to small-scale forcing leads to\nstationary 3D out-of-equilibrium dynamics at the energy containing scales. The\ntransition between 2D and 3D turbulence is then explored through adding a\npercentage of fully 3D Fourier modes in the volume.\n", "  A set of Hamiltonians that are not self-adjoint but have the spectrum of the\nharmonic oscillator is studied. The eigenvectors of these operators and those\nof their Hermitian conjugates form a bi-orthogonal system that provides a\nmathematical procedure to satisfy the superposition principle. In this form the\nnon-Hermitian oscillators can be studied in much the same way as in the\nHermitian approaches. Two different nonlinear algebras generated by properly\nconstructed ladder operators are found and the corresponding generalized\ncoherent states are obtained. The non-Hermitian oscillators can be steered to\nthe conventional one by the appropriate selection of parameters. In such limit,\nthe generators of the nonlinear algebras converge to generalized ladder\noperators that would represent either intensity-dependent interactions or\nmulti-photon processes if the oscillator is associated with single mode photon\nfields in nonlinear media.\n", "  In this paper, we take the slowly rotating black three-brane background and\nperturb it by introducing a vector gauge field. We find the components of the\ngauge field through Maxwell equations and Bianchi identities. Using currents\nand some ansatz we find Fick's first law at long wavelength regime. An\ninteresting result for this non-trivial supergravity background is that the\ndiffusion constant on the stretched horizon which emerges from Fick's first law\nis a complex constant. The pure imaginary part of the diffusion constant\nappears because the black three-brane has angular momentum. By taking the\nstatic limit of the corresponding black brane the well known diffusion constant\nwill be recovered. On the other hand, from the point of view of the Fick's\nsecond law, we have the dispersion relation $\\omega=-iDq^{2}$ and we found a\ndamping of hydrodynamical flow in the holographically dual theory. Existence of\nimaginary term in the diffusion constant introduces an oscillating propagation\nof the gauge field in the dual field theory.\n", "  We present all real quantum mechanical potentials in a two-dimensional\nEuclidean space that have the following properties: 1. They allow separation of\nvariables of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in polar coordinates, 2. They allow an\nindependent fourth order integral of motion, 3. It turns out that their angular\ndependent part $S(\\theta)$ does not satisfy any linear differential equation.\nIn this case it satisfies a nonlinear ODE that has the Painlev\\'e property and\nits solutions can be expressed in terms of the Painlev\\'e transcendent $P_6$.\nWe also study the corresponding classical analogs of these potentials. The\npolynomial algebra of the integrals of motion is constructed in the classical\ncase.\n", "  We present an optical method to measure radio-frequency electro-optic phase\nmodulation profiles by employing spectrum-to-time mapping realized by highly\nchirped optical pulses. We directly characterize temporal phase modulation\nprofiles of up to 12.5 GHz bandwidth, with temporal resolution comparable to\nhigh-end electronic oscilloscopes. The presented optical setup is a valuable\ntool for direct characterization of complex temporal electro-optic phase\nmodulation profiles, which is indispensable for practical realization of\ndeterministic spectral-temporal reshaping of quantum light pulses.\n", "  The T2K experiment reports an updated analysis of neutrino and antineutrino\noscillations in appearance and disappearance channels. A sample of electron\nneutrino candidates at Super-Kamiokande in which a pion decay has been tagged\nis added to the four single-ring samples used in previous T2K oscillation\nanalyses. Through combined analyses of these five samples, simultaneous\nmeasurements of four oscillation parameters, $|\\Delta m^2_{32}|$,\n$\\sin^2(\\theta_{23})$, $\\sin^2(\\theta_{13})$, and $\\delta_{CP}$ and of the mass\nordering are made. A set of studies of simulated data indicates that the\nsensitivity to the oscillation parameters is not limited by neutrino\ninteraction model uncertainty. Multiple oscillation analyses are performed, and\nfrequentist and Bayesian intervals are presented for combinations of the\noscillation parameters with and without the inclusion of reactor constraints on\n$\\sin^2(\\theta_{13})$. When combined with reactor measurements, the hypothesis\nof CP conservation ($\\delta_{CP}$$=0$ or $\\pi$) is excluded at 90% confidence\nlevel. The 90% confidence region for $\\delta_{CP}$ is [-2.95,-0.44] ([-1.47,\n-1.27]) for normal (inverted) ordering. The central values and 68\\% confidence\nintervals for the other oscillation parameters for normal (inverted) ordering\nare $\\Delta m^{2}_{32}=2.54\\pm0.08$ ($2.51\\pm0.08$) $\\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2 /\nc^4$ and $\\sin^2(\\theta_{23}) = 0.55^{+0.05}_{-0.09}$ ($0.55^{+0.05}_{-0.08}$),\ncompatible with maximal mixing. In the Bayesian analysis, the data weakly\nprefer normal ordering (Bayes factor 3.7) and the upper octant for\n$\\sin^2(\\theta_{23})$ (Bayes factor 2.4).\n", "  Quasi-parton distribution functions have received a lot of attentions in both\nperturbative QCD and lattice QCD communities in recent years because they not\nonly carry good information on the parton distribution functions, but also\ncould be evaluated by lattice QCD simulations. However, unlike the parton\ndistribution functions, the quasi-parton distribution functions have\nperturbative ultraviolet power divergences because they are not defined by\ntwist-2 operators. In this paper, we identify all sources of ultraviolet\ndivergences for the quasi-parton distribution functions in coordinate-space,\nand demonstrate that power divergences, as well as all logarithmic divergences\ncan be renormalized multiplicatively to all orders in QCD perturbation theory.\n", "  Observables sensitive to the anomalous production of events containing\nhadronic jets and missing momentum in the plane transverse to the proton beams\nat the Large Hadron Collider are presented. The observables are defined as a\nratio of cross sections, for events containing jets and large missing\ntransverse momentum to events containing jets and a pair of charged leptons\nfrom the decay of a $Z/\\gamma^\\ast$ boson. This definition minimises\nexperimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties in the measurements. This\nratio is measured differentially with respect to a number of kinematic\nproperties of the hadronic system in two phase-space regions; one inclusive\nsingle-jet region and one region sensitive to vector-boson-fusion topologies.\nThe data are found to be in agreement with the Standard Model predictions and\nused to constrain a variety of theoretical models for dark-matter production,\nincluding simplified models, effective field theory models, and invisible\ndecays of the Higgs boson. The measurements use 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton\ncollision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of\n13 TeV and are fully corrected for detector effects, meaning that the data can\nbe used to constrain new-physics models beyond those shown in this paper.\n", "  A computational tool for coarse-graining nonlinear systems of ordinary\ndifferential equations in time is discussed. Three illustrative model examples\nare worked out that demonstrate the range of capability of the method. This\nincludes the averaging of Hamiltonian as well as dissipative microscopic\ndynamics whose `slow' variables, defined in a precise sense, can often display\nmixed slow-fast response as in relaxation oscillations, and dependence on\ninitial conditions of the fast variables. Also covered is the case where the\nquasi-static assumption in solid mechanics is violated. The computational tool\nis demonstrated to capture all of these behaviors in an accurate and robust\nmanner, with significant savings in time. A practically useful strategy for\ninitializing short bursts of microscopic runs for the accurate computation of\nthe evolution of slow variables is also developed.\n", "  We report on high-resolution optical spectroscopy of interacting bosonic\n$^{174}$Yb atoms in deep optical lattices with negligible tunneling. We prepare\nMott insulator phases with singly- and doubly-occupied isolated sites and probe\nthe atoms using an ultra-narrow \"clock\" transition. Atoms in singly-occupied\nsites undergo long-lived Rabi oscillations. Atoms in doubly-occupied sites are\nstrongly affected by interatomic interactions, and we measure their inelastic\ndecay rates and energy shifts. We deduce from these measurements all relevant\ncollisional parameters involving both clock states, in particular the intra-\nand inter-state scattering lengths.\n", "  A semiconducting nanowire with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling and coupled\nto a superconductor can be tuned by an external Zeeman field into a topological\nphase with Majorana zero modes. Here we theoretically investigate how this\nexotic topological superconductor phase manifests in Josephson junctions based\non such proximitized nanowires. In particular, we focus on critical currents in\nthe short junction limit ($L_{\\rm N}\\ll \\xi$, where $L_{\\rm N}$ is the junction\nlength and $\\xi$ is the superconducting coherence length) and show that they\ncontain important information about nontrivial topology and Majoranas. This\nincludes signatures of the gap inversion at the topological transition and a\nunique oscillatory pattern that originates from Majorana interference.\nInterestingly, this pattern can be modified by tuning the transmission across\nthe junction, thus providing complementary evidence of Majoranas and their\nenergy splittings beyond standard tunnel spectroscopy experiments, while\noffering further tunability by virtue of the Josephson effect.\n", "  We present a new model, developed with the Serpent Monte Carlo code, for\nneutronics simulation of the TRIGA Mark II reactor of Pavia (Italy). The\ncomplete 3D geometry of the reactor core is implemented with high accuracy and\ndetail, exploiting all the available information about geometry and materials.\nThe Serpent model of the reactor is validated in the fresh fuel configuration,\nthrough a benchmark analysis of the first criticality experiments and control\nrods calibrations. The accuracy of simulations in reproducing the reactivity\ndifference between the low power (10 W) and full power (250 kW) reactor\ncondition is also tested. Finally, a direct comparison between Serpent and MCNP\nsimulations of the same reactor configurations is presented.\n", "  In this paper, we perform a forecast analysis to test the capacity of future\nbaryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nexperiments to constrain phenomenological interacting dark energy models using\nthe Fisher matrix formalism. We consider a Euclid-like experiment, in which BAO\nmeasurements is one of the main goals, to constrain the cosmological parameters\nof alternative cosmological models. Moreover, additional experimental probes\ncan more efficiently provide information on the parameters forecast, justifying\nalso the inclusion in the analysis of a future ground-based CMB experiment\nmainly designed to measure the polarization signal with high precision. In the\ninteracting dark energy scenario, a coupling between dark matter and dark\nenergy modifies the conservation equations such that the fluid equations for\nboth constituents are conserved as the total energy density of the dark sector.\nIn this context, we consider three phenomenological models which have been\ndeeply investigated in literature over the past years. We find that the\ncombination of both CMB and BAO information can break degeneracies among the\ndark sector parameters for all three models, although to different extents. We\nfound powerful constraints on, for example, the coupling constant when\ncomparing it with present limits for two of the models, and their future\nstatistical 3-$\\sigma$ bounds could potentially exclude the null interaction\nfor the combination of probes that is considered. However, for one of the\nmodels, the constraint on the coupling parameter does not improve the present\nresult (achieved using a large combination of surveys), and a larger\ncombination of probes appears to be necessary to eventually claim whether or\nnot interaction is favored in that context.\n", "  We demonstrate the reconstruction of the Wigner function from marginal\ndistributions of the motion of a single trapped particle using homodyne\ndetection. We show that it is possible to generate quantum states of levitated\noptomechanical systems even under the effect of continuous measurement by the\ntrapping laser light. We describe the opto-mechanical coupling for the case of\nthe particle trapped by a free-space focused laser beam, explicitly for the\ncase without an optical cavity. We use the scheme to reconstruct the Wigner\nfunction of experimental data in perfect agreement with the expected Gaussian\ndistribution of a thermal state of motion. This opens a route for quantum state\npreparation in levitated optomechanics.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the phonon antibunching effect in a coupled\nnonlinear micro/nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS/NEMS) resonator at a finite\ntemperature. In the weak driving limit, the optimal condition for phonon\nantibunching is given by solving the stationary Liouville-von Neumann master\nequation. We show that at low temperature, the phonon antibunching effect\noccurs in the regime of weak nonlinearity and mechanical coupling, which is\nconfirmed by analytical and numerical solutions. We also find that thermal\nnoise can degrade or even destroy the antibunching effect for different\nmechanical coupling strengths. Furthermore, a transition from strong\nantibunching to bunching for phonon correlation has been observed in the\ntemperature domain. Finally, we find that a suitably strong driving in the\nfinite-temperature case would help to preserve an optimal phonon correlation\nagainst thermal noise.\n", "  For any quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, there exists the universal R-matrix,\nwhich satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation. It is known that the adjoint action\nof the universal R-matrix on the elements of the tensor square of the algebra\nconstitutes a quantum Yang-Baxter map, which satisfies the set-theoretic\nYang-Baxter equation. The map has a zero curvature representation among\nL-operators defined as images of the universal R-matrix. We find that the zero\ncurvature representation can be solved by the Gauss decomposition of a product\nof L-operators. Thereby obtained a quasi-determinant expression of the quantum\nYang-Baxter map associated with the quantum algebra $U_{q}(gl(n))$. Moreover,\nthe map is identified with products of quasi-Pl\\\"{u}cker coordinates over a\nmatrix composed of the L-operators. We also consider the quasi-classical limit,\nwhere the underlying quantum algebra reduces to a Poisson algebra. The\nquasi-determinant expression of the quantum Yang-Baxter map reduces to ratios\nof determinants, which give a new expression of a classical Yang-Baxter map.\n", "  Recent transport experiments have revealed the activation of longitudinal\nmagnetoresistance of Weyl semimetals in the quantum limit, suggesting the\nbreakdown of chiral anomaly in a strong magnetic field. Here we provide a\ngeneral mechanism for gapping the zeroth chiral Landau levels applicable for\nboth Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Our result shows that the zeroth Landau levels\nanticross when the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the Dirac/Weyl node\nseparation and when the inverse magnetic length $l_B^{-1}$ is comparable to the\nnode separation scale $\\Delta k$. The induced bulk gap increases rapidly beyond\na threshold field in Weyl semimetals, but has no threshold and is non-monotonic\nin Dirac systems due to the crossover between $l_B^{-1}>\\Delta k$ and\n$l_B^{-1}<\\Delta k$ regions. We also find that the Dirac and possibly Weyl\nsystems host counterpropagating edge states between the zeroth Landau levels,\nleading to a state with metallic side walls and zero Hall conductance.\n", "  A one-dimensional semiconductor nanowire proximitized by a nearby\nsuperconductor may become a topological superconductor hosting localized\nMajorana zero modes at the two wire ends in the presence of spin-orbit coupling\nand Zeeman spin splitting (arising from an external magnetic field). The\nhallmark of the presence of such Majorana zero modes is the appearance of a\nzero-temperature quantized zero-bias conductance peak in the tunneling\nspectroscopy of the Majorana nanowire. We theoretically study the temperature\nand the tunnel coupling dependence of the tunneling conductance in such\nnanowires to understand possible intrinsic deviations from the predicted\nconductance quantization. We find that the full temperature and the tunneling\ntransmission dependence of the tunnel conductance does not obey any simple\nscaling relation, and estimating the zero-temperature conductance from\nfinite-temperature and finite-tunnel-broadening tunneling data is difficult in\ngeneral. A scaling relation, however, does hold at the extreme weak-tunneling\nlow-temperature limit where the conductance depends only on the dimensionless\nratio of the temperature and tunnel broadening. We also consider the tunneling\ncontributions from nontopological Andreev bound states which may produce\nalmost-zero-bias conductance peaks, which are not easy to distinguish from the\nMajorana-induced zero-bias peaks, finding that the nontopological\nalmost-zero-modes associated with Andreev bound states manifest similar\ntemperature and transmission dependence as the topological Majorana modes. We\ncomment on the Zeeman splitting dependence of the zero-bias conductance peak\nfor finite temperature and tunnel coupling.\n", "  The Hammersley-Welsh bound (1962) states that the number $c_n$ of length $n$\nself-avoiding walks on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ satisfies \\[ c_n \\leq \\exp \\left[\nO(n^{1/2}) \\right] \\mu_c^n, \\] where $\\mu_c=\\mu_c(d)$ is the connective\nconstant of $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. While stronger estimates have subsequently been\nproven for $d\\geq 3$, for $d=2$ this has remained the best rigorous,\nunconditional bound available. In this note, we give a new, simplified proof of\nthis bound, which does not rely on the combinatorial analysis of unfolding. We\nalso prove a small, non-quantitative improvement to the bound, namely \\[ c_n\n\\leq \\exp\\left[ o(n^{1/2})\\right] \\mu_c^n. \\] The improved bound is obtained as\na corollary to the sub-ballisticity theorem of Duminil-Copin and Hammond\n(2013). We also show that any quantitative form of that theorem would yield a\ncorresponding quantitative improvement to the Hammersley-Welsh bound.\n", "  We present determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the hole-doped\nsingle-band Hubbard-Holstein model on a square lattice, to investigate how\nquasiparticles emerge when doping a Mott insulator (MI) or a Peierls insulator\n(PI). The MI regime at large Hubbard interaction $U$ and small relative\nelectron-phonon coupling strength $\\lambda$ is quickly suppressed upon doping,\nby drawing spectral weight from the upper Hubbard band and shifting the lower\nHubbard band towards the Fermi level, leading to a metallic state with emergent\nquasiparticles at the Fermi level. On the other hand, the PI regime at large\n$\\lambda$ and small $U$ persists out to relatively high doping levels. We study\nthe evolution of the $d$-wave superconducting susceptibility with doping, and\nfind that it increases with lowering temperature in a regime of intermediate\nvalues of $U$ and $\\lambda$.\n", "  We theoretically investigate pump-probe optical responses in the\ntwo-dimensional extended Hubbard model describing cuprates by using a\ntime-dependent Lanczos method. At half filling, pumping generates photoinduced\nabsorptions inside the Mott gap. A part of low-energy absorptions is attributed\nto the independent propagation of photoinduced holons and doublons. The\nspectral weight just below the Mott gap increases with decreasing the on-site\nCoulomb interaction $U$. We find that the next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb\ninteraction $V_1$ enhances this $U$ dependence, indicating the presence of\nbiexcitonic contributions formed by two holon-doublon pairs. Photo-pumping in\nhole-doped systems also induces spectral weights below remnant Mott-gap\nexcitations, being consistent with recent experiments. The induced weights are\nless sensitive to $V_1$ and may be related to the formation of a biexcitonic\nstate in the presence of hole carriers.\n", "  We demonstrate intracavity plasmonic laser spectroscopy using a plasmonic\nlaser created from a periodically-perforated silver film with a liquid gain\nmedium. An active zone of the laser is formed by a highly elongated spot of\npumping. This results in an 80x decrease in the threshold pumping level; in a\nsignificantly more efficient diffusive mixing of dye molecules, which\nsubstantially suppresses the effect of their bleaching; and in the ability to\nreduce the volume of the gain medium to as little as 400 nL. We use this design\nfor a stable plasmonic laser in multiple measurements and demonstrate that it\nis highly effective as a spaser spectroscopy sensor for intracavity detection\nof an absorptive dye at 70 ppb. This work provides an opportunity to develop\napplications of intracavity plasmonic laser spectroscopy in biological label\ndetection and other fields.\n", "  This study concerns with the dynamics of a quantum neural network unit in\norder to examine the suitability of simple neural computing tasks. More\nspecifically, we examine the dynamics of an interacting spin model chosen as a\ncandidate of a quantum perceptron for closed and open quantum systems. We adopt\na collisional model enables examining both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics\nof the proposed quantum system. We show that our quantum neural network (QNN)\nunit has a stable output quantum state in contact with an environment carrying\ninformation content. By the performed numerical simulations one can compare the\ndynamics in the presence and absence of quantum memory effects. We find that\nour QNN unit is suitable for implementing general neural computing tasks in\ncontact with a Markovian information environment and quantum memory effects\ncause complications on the stability of the output state.\n", "  Local realism is in conflict with special quantum Bell-type models. Recently,\nseveral experiments have demonstrated violation of local realism if we trust\ntheir setup assuming special relativity valid. In this paper we question the\nassumption of relativity, point out not commented anomalies and show that the\nexperiments have not closed objectivity loophole because clonability of the\nresult has not been demonstrated. We propose several improvements in further\nexperimental tests of local realism make the violation more convincing.\n", "  We study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), Josephson oscillation, and\nself-trapping in a stable, mobile, three-dimensional matter-wave spherical\nquantum ball self-bound by attractive two-body and repulsive three-body\ninteractions. The SSB is realized by a parity-symmetric (a) one-dimensional\n(1D) double-well potential and (b) a 1D Gaussian potential, both along the $z$\naxis and no potential along the $x$ and $y$ axes. In the presence of each of\nthese potentials, the symmetric ground state dynamically evolves into a\ndoubly-degenerate SSB ground state. If the SSB ground state in the double well,\npredominantly located in the first well ($z>0$), is given a small displacement,\nthe quantum ball oscillates with a self-trapping in the first well. For a\nmedium displacement one encounters an asymmetric Josephson oscillation. The\nasymmetric oscillation is a consequence of SSB. The study is performed by a\nvariational and numerical solution of a non-linear mean-field model with 1D\nparity-symmetric perturbations.\n", "  The $\\sim 3\\sigma$ discrepancy between the predicted and observed reactor\nanti-neutrino flux, known as the reactor anti-neutrino anomaly, continues to\nintrigue. The recent discovery of an unexpected bump in the reactor\nanti-neutrino spectrum, as well as indications that the flux deficit is\ndifferent for different fission isotopes seems to disfavour the explanation of\nthe anomaly in terms of sterile neutrino oscillations. We critically review\nthis conclusion in view of all available data on electron (anti)neutrino\ndisappearance. We find that the sterile neutrino hypothesis cannot be rejected\nbased on global data and is only mildly disfavored compared to an individual\nrescaling of neutrino fluxes from different fission isotopes. The main reason\nfor this is the presence of spectral features in recent data from the NEOS and\nDANSS experiments. If state-of-the-art predictions for reactor fluxes are taken\nat face value, sterile neutrino oscillations allow a consistent description of\nglobal data with a significance close to $3\\sigma$ relative to the\nno-oscillation case. Even if reactor fluxes and spectra are left free in the\nfit, a $2\\sigma$ hint in favour of sterile neutrinos remains, with allowed\nparameter regions consistent with an explanation of the anomaly in terms of\noscillations.\n", "  Modern societies face the challenge that the time scale of opinion formation\nis continuously accelerating in contrast to the time scale of political\ndecision making. With the latter remaining of the order of the election cycle\nwe examine here the case that the political state of a society is determined by\nthe continuously evolving values of the electorate. Given this assumption we\nshow that the time lags inherent in the election cycle will inevitable lead to\npolitical instabilities for advanced democracies characterized both by an\naccelerating pace of opinion dynamics and by high sensibilities (political\ncorrectness) to deviations from mainstream values. Our result is based on the\nobservation that dynamical systems become generically unstable whenever time\ndelays become comparable to the time it takes to adapt to the steady state. The\ntime needed to recover from external shocks grows in addition dramatically\nclose to the transition. Our estimates for the order of magnitude of the\ninvolved time scales indicate that socio-political instabilities may develop\nonce the aggregate time scale for the evolution of the political values of the\nelectorate falls below 7-15 months.\n", "  The electron wave function experiences a phase modification at coherent\ntransmission through a quantum dot. This transmission phase undergoes a\ncharacteristic shift of $\\pi$ when scanning through a Coulomb-blockade\nresonance. Between successive resonances either a transmission phase lapse of\n$\\pi$ or a phase plateau is theoretically expected to occur depending on the\nparity of the corresponding quantum dot states. Despite considerable\nexperimental effort, this transmission phase behaviour has remained elusive for\na large quantum dot. Here we report on transmission phase measurements across\nsuch a large quantum dot hosting hundreds of electrons. Using an original\nelectron two-path interferometer to scan the transmission phase along fourteen\nsuccessive resonances, we observe both phase lapses and plateaus. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate that quantum dot deformation alters the sequence of transmission\nphase lapses and plateaus via parity modifications of the involved quantum dot\nstates. Our findings set a milestone towards a comprehensive understanding of\nthe transmission phase of quantum dots.\n", "  Theta identities on genus g Riemann surfaces which decompose simple products\nof fermion correlation functions with a constraint on their variables are\nconsidered. This type of theta identities is, in a sense, dual to Fay s\nformula, by which it is possible to sum over spin structures of certain part of\nsuperstring amplitudes in NSR formalism without using Fay s formula nor Riemann\ns theta formula in much simpler, more transparent way. Also, such identities\nwill help to cast correlation functions among arbitrary numbers of Kac-Moody\ncurrents in a closed form. As for genus 1, the identities are reported before\nin ref[1] [2]. Based on some notes on genus 1 case which were not reported in\nref[1] [2] and relating those to the results of the Dolan Goddard method ref[3]\non describing Kac-Moody currents in a closed form, we propose an idea of\ngeneralizing genus 1 identities to the case of genus g surfaces. This is not a\ncomplete derivation of the higher genus formula due to difficulties of\ninvestigating singular part of derivatives of genus g Weierstrass Pe functions.\nMathematical issues remained unsolved for genus g >1 are described in the text.\n", "  The flat plane condition is the union of two exact constraints in electronic\nstructure theory: i) energetic piecewise linearity with fractional electron\nremoval or addition and ii) invariant energetics with change in electron spin\nin a half filled orbital. Semi-local density functional theory (DFT) fails to\nrecover the flat plane, exhibiting convex fractional charge errors (FCE) and\nconcave fractional spin errors (FSE) that are related to delocalization and\nstatic correlation errors. We previously showed that DFT+U eliminates FCE but\nnow demonstrate that, like other widely employed corrections (i.e., Hartree\nFock exchange), it worsens FSE. To find an alternative strategy, we examine the\nshape of semi-local DFT deviations from the exact flat plane, and we find this\nshape to be remarkably consistent across ions and molecules. We introduce the\njmDFT approach, wherein corrections are constructed from few-parameter, low-\norder, functional forms that fit the shape of semi-local DFT errors. We select\none such physically intuitive form and incorporate it self-consistently to\ncorrect semi-local DFT. We demonstrate on model systems that this jmDFT\napproach represents the first easy-to-implement, no-overhead approach to\nrecovering the flat plane from semi-local DFT.\n", "  We study the effect of a finite sample size, beam divergence and detector\nthickness on the resolution function of a MIEZE spectrometer. We provide a\ntransparent analytical framework which can be used to determine the optimal\ntrade-off between incoming flux and time resolution for a given experimental\nconfiguration. The key result of our approach is that the usual limiting factor\nof MIEZE spectroscopy, namely neutron path length differences throughout the\ninstrument, can be suppressed up to relatively large momentum transfers by\nusing a proper small-angle (SANS) geometry. Under such configuration, the\nhitherto accepted limits of MIEZE spectroscopy in terms of time-resolution are\npushed upwards by typically an order of magnitude, giving access to most of the\ntopical fields in soft- and hard-condensed matter physics.\n", "  We report on the observation of a possible topological Hall effect in thin\nfilms of the itinerant ferromagnet Eu1-xSmxTiO3. EuTiO3 and Eu0.955Sm0.045TiO3\nfilms were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The EuTiO3 film is insulating. The\nHall resistivity of the Eu0.955Sm0.045TiO3 films exhibits the anomalous Hall\neffect below the Curie temperature of ~ 5 K as well as additional features that\nappear at 2 K. It is shown that these features are magnetic in origin and\nconsistent with the topological Hall effect seen in materials systems with\ntopologically nontrivial spin textures, such as skyrmions. The results open up\ninteresting possibilities for epitaxial hybrid heterostructures that combine\ntopological magnetic states, tunable carrier densities, and other phenomena.\n", "  We review old and recent experimental and theoretical results on bright\nsolitons in Bose-Einstein condensates made of alkali-metal atoms and under\nexternal optical confinement. First we deduce the three-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii equation (3D GPE) from the Dirac-Frenkel action of interacting\nidentical bosons within a time-dependent Hartree approximation. Then we discuss\nthe dimensional reduction of the GPE from 3D to 1D, deriving the 1D GPE and\nalso the 1D nonpolynomial Schr\\\"odinger equation (1D NPSE). Finally, we analyze\nthe bright solition solutions of both 1D GPE and 1D NPSE and compare these\ntheoretical predictions with the available experimental data.\n", "  After a highly successful first data taking period at the LHC, the LHCb\nexperiment developed a new trigger strategy with a real-time reconstruction,\nalignment and calibration for Run II. This strategy relies on offline-like\ntrack reconstruction in the high level trigger, making a separate offline event\nreconstruction unnecessary. To enable such reconstruction, and additionally\nkeeping up with a higher event rate due to the accelerator upgrade, the time\nused by the track reconstruction had to be decreased. Timing improvements have\nin parts been achieved by utilizing parallel computing techniques that will be\ndescribed in this document by considering two example applications. Despite\ndecreasing computing time, the reconstruction quality in terms of\nreconstruction efficiency and fake rate could be improved at several places.\nTwo applications of fast machine learning techniques are highlighted, refining\ntrack candidate selection at the early stages of the reconstruction.\n", "  We present a novel application of rotors in geometric algebra to represent\nthe change of curvature tensor, that is used in shell theory as part of the\nconstitutive law. We introduce a new decomposition of the change of curvature\ntensor, which has explicit terms for changes of curvature due to initial\ncurvature combined with strain, and changes in rotation over the surface. We\nuse this decomposition to perform a scaling analysis of the relative importance\nof bending and stretching in flexible tubes undergoing self excited\noscillations. These oscillations have relevance to the lung, in which it is\nbelieved that they are responsible for wheezing. The new analysis is\nnecessitated by the fact that the working fluid is air, compared to water in\nmost previous work. We use stereographic imaging to empirically measure the\nrelative importance of bending and stretching energy in observed self excited\noscillations. This enables us to validate our scaling analysis. We show that\nbending energy is dominated by stretching energy, and the scaling analysis\nmakes clear that this will remain true for tubes in the airways of the lung.\n", "  Starting from an analytical expression for the Helmholtz free energy we\ncalculate the thermal corrections to the Casimir energy-density and entropy\nwithin nearby ideal parallel plates in the vacuum of a massless scalar field.\nOur framework is the Kerr spacetime in the presence of quintessence and massive\ngravitons. The high and low temperature regimes are especially analysed in\norder to distinguish the main contributions. For instance, in the high\ntemperature regime, we show that the force between the plates is repulsive and\ngrows with both the quintessence and the massive gravitons. Regarding the\nCasimir entropy, our results are in agreement with the Nernst heat theorem and\ntherefore confirm the third law of thermodynamics in the present scenario.\n", "  We developed a multi-mode ground state cooling technique based on\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). By involving an additional\nground and excited state, two individually adjustable bright states together\nwith a dark state are created. While the dark state suppresses carrier\nscattering, the two bright states are brought into resonance with spectrally\nseparated motional red sidebands. With this double-bright EIT (D-EIT) cooling\nscheme, we experimentally demonstrate ground state cooling of all three\nmotional modes of a trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ with a single cooling pulse. The\napproach is scalable to more than two bright states by introducing laser\ncouplings to additional states.\n", "  Using a non-perturbative quantization method originally due to Heisenberg we\nobtain {\\it quantum} monopole solutions and {\\it quantum} flux tube solutions\nfor the SU(3) strong interaction gauge theory. For the quantum monopole\nsolution we find that the radial chromomagnetic field decreases exponentially\nwith a scale set by the effective gluon mass. The quantum flux tube solution\nstretches between a monopole and anti-monopole and has a longitudinal\nchromomagnetic field. Both solutions exhibit characteristics of the Meissner\neffect and are conjectured to have a connection to the confinement phenomenon.\n", "  The performance of GaN-on-Silicon electronic devices is severely degraded by\nthe presence of a parasitic conduction pathway at the nitride-substrate\ninterface which contributes to switching losses and lower breakdown voltages.\nThe physical nature of such a parasitic channel and its properties are however,\nnot well understood. We report on a pronounced thickness dependence of the\nparasitic channel formation at AlN/Si interfaces due to increased surface\nacceptor densities at the interface in silicon. The origin of these surface\nacceptors is analyzed using secondary ion mass spectroscopy measurements and\ntraced to thermal acceptor formation due to Si-O-N complexes. Low-temperature\n(5K) magneto-resistance (MR) data reveals a transition from positive to\nnegative MR with increasing AlN film thickness indicating the presence of an\ninversion layer of electrons which also contributes to parasitic channel\nformation but whose contribution is secondary at room temperatures.\n", "  A theoretical analysis of possible influence of neutrino magnetic moments on\nthe propagation of ultrahigh-energy cosmic neutrinos in the interstellar space\nis carried out under the assumption of two-neutrino mixing. The exact solution\nof the effective equation for neutrino evolution in the presence of a magnetic\nfield and matter is obtained, which accounts for four neutrino species\ncorresponding to two different flavor states with positive and negative\nhelicities. Using most stringent astrophysical bounds on the putative neutrino\nmagnetic moment, probabilities of neutrino flavor and spin oscillations are\ncalculated on the basis of the obtained exact solution. Specific patterns of\nspin-flavor oscillations are determined for neutrino-energy values\ncharacteristic of, respectively, the cosmogenic neutrinos, the\nGreisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) cutoff, and well above the cutoff.\n", "  We present new Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations of\nthe core of IC 2497, the galaxy associated with Hanny's Voorwerp. The combined\nfits of the Chandra (0.5-8 keV) and NuSTAR (3-24 keV) X-ray spectra, together\nwith WISE mid-IR photometry, optical longslit spectroscopy and optical\nnarrow-band imaging, suggest that the galaxy hosts a Compton-thick AGN ($N_{\\rm\nH} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, current intrinsic luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}\n\\sim 2-5 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) whose luminosity dropped by a factor of\n$\\sim$50 within the last $\\sim 100$ kyr. This corresponds to a change in\nEddington ratio from $\\rm \\lambda_{Edd} \\sim$ 0.35 to $\\rm \\lambda_{Edd} \\sim$\n0.007. We argue that the AGN in IC 2497 should not be classified as a\nchanging-look AGN, but rather we favour the interpretation where the AGN is\nundergoing a change in accretion state (from radiatively efficient to\nradiatively inefficient). In this scenario the observed drop in luminosity and\nEddington ratio corresponds to the final stage of an AGN accretion phase. Our\nresults are consistent with previous studies in the optical, X-ray and radio\nalthough the magnitude of the drop is lower than previously suggested. In\naddition, we discuss a possible analogy between X-ray binaries and an AGN.\n", "  In this work, sidebands suppression brought by buffer gas argon (Ar) in\ncesium Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF) at 852 nm is\ninvestigated. FADOF performances at different Ar pressures (0 torr, 1 torr, 5\ntorr and 10 torr) are compared, and a single-peak transmittance spectrum with\npeak transmittance up to 80% is achieved at the high Ar pressure. A detailed\nanalysis shows that, this sidebands suppression comes from the depopulation\nenhancement by the buffer gas. This result can be generalized to other FADOFs\nwith similar level structures such as the D2 lines of other alkali metal atoms.\n", "  We review a simple mechanism for the formation of plateaux in the fractional\nquantum Hall effect. It arises from a map of the microscopic Hamiltonian in the\nthin torus limit to a lattice gas model, solved by Hubbard. The map suggests a\nDevil's staircase pattern, and explains the observed asymmetries in the widths.\nEach plateau is a new ground state of the system: a periodic Slater state in\nthe thin torus limit. We provide the unitary operator that maps such limit\nstates to the full, effective ground states with same filling fraction. These\nJack polynomials generalise Laughlin's ansatz, and are exact eigenstates of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. Why are Jacks sitting on the Devil's staircase? This\nis yet an intriguing problem.\n", "  In this work an update of the cosmological role and place of the chiral\ntensor particles in the Universe history is provided. We discuss an extended\nmodel with chiral tensor particles. The influence of these particles on the\nearly Universe evolution is studied. Namely, the increase of the Universe\nexpansion rate caused by the additional particles in this extended model is\ncalculated, their characteristic interactions with the particles of the hot\nUniverse plasma are studied and the corresponding times of their creation,\nscattering, annihilation and decay are estimated for accepted values of their\nmasses and couplings, based on the recent experimental constraints. The period\nof abundant presence of these particles in the Universe evolution is\ndetermined.\n", "  The Weinberg operator allows for the construction of radiative Majorana\nneutrino masses. In this letter, it will be shown that it is possible to\nconstruct a one-loop diagram that will be the principal component of the\nneutrino mass matrix and that will have an exact mixing matrix with\n$\\theta_{13} =0$. The addition of a two-loop diagram, which is naturally\nsuppressed, allows the creation of the correct perturbations that will give a\nneutrino mixing matrix with entries inside experimental constrains, including\nthe possibility of large CP Dirac phases.\n", "  We have used new measurements of the B/C ratio in galactic cosmic rays at\nboth low and high energies by the Voyager and AMS-2 spacecraft, respectively,\nalong with propagation calculations using a truncated LBM to examine the\nimplications of these new measurements over an extended energy range from a few\nMeV/nuc to 1 TeV/nuc. We find that the predictions from both the truncated LBM\nand the Diffusive Reacceleration model for GALPROP both agree with the Voyager\nand AMS-2 measurements of the B/C ratio to within +/- 10 percent throughout the\nentire energy range from 50 MeV/nuc to 1 TeV/nuc. The two propagation\napproaches also agree with each other to within +/-10 percent or less\nthroughout this energy range. In effect a diffusion model, without significant\nadditional acceleration, provides a match within +/-10 percent to the combined\ndata from Voyager 1 and AMS-2 on the B/C ratio from 50 MeV/nuc to 1 TeV/nuc.\nThe B/C ratio below 50 MeV/nuc measured at V1 exceeds the predictions of both\npropagation models by as much as 3 sigma in the data measurement errors.\n", "  This work describes the continuous-variable entanglement of the\ncounter-propagating twin beams generated in a Mirrorless Optical Parametric\nOscillator below threshold, encompassing both their quadrature and\nphoton-number correlation. In the first case, a comparison with the single-pass\nco-propagating geometry outlines the huge difference of the bandwidth involved\nand a completely different stability of the two sources with respect to the\nphase-angle. In the second case, stimulated by the critical divergence of the\ncorrelation time evidenced by Corti et al., we address the issue of the\ntemporal bandwidth of the intensity squeezing.\n", "  Precise theoretical predictions are vital for the interpretation of Standard\nModel measurements and facilitate conclusive searches for New Physics phenomena\nat the LHC. In this contribution I highlight some of the ongoing efforts in the\nframework of the Sherpa event generator to provide accurate and realistic\nsimulations of Standard Model production processes. This includes the automated\nevaluation of NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections and their consistent consideration\nin the parton-shower evolution of scattering events. Particular emphasis is\ngiven to examples and applications involving the production of top quarks.\n", "  We show that quantum curves arise in infinite families and have the structure\nof singular vectors of a relevant symmetry algebra. We analyze in detail the\ncase of the hermitian one-matrix model with the underlying Virasoro algebra,\nand the super-eigenvalue model with the underlying super-Virasoro algebra. In\nthe Virasoro case we relate singular vector structure of quantum curves to the\ntopological recursion, and in the super-Virasoro case we introduce the notion\nof super-quantum curves. We also discuss the double quantum structure of the\nquantum curves and analyze specific examples of Gaussian and multi-Penner\nmodels.\n", "  Lightning and thundercloud are the most dramatic natural particle\naccelerators on the Earth. Relativistic electrons accelerated by electric\nfields therein emit bremsstrahlung gamma rays, which have been detected at\nground observations, by airborne detectors, and as terrestrial gamma-ray\nflashes (TGFs) from space. The energy of the gamma rays is sufficiently high to\npotentially invoke atmospheric photonuclear reactions 14N(gamma, n)13N, which\nwould produce neutrons and eventually positrons via beta-plus decay of\ngenerated unstable radioactive isotopes, especially 13N. However, no clear\nobservational evidence for the reaction has been reported to date. Here we\nreport the first detection of neutron and positron signals from lightning with\na ground observation. During a thunderstorm on 6 February 2017 in Japan, a\nTGF-like intense flash (within 1 ms) was detected at our monitoring sites\n0.5-1.7 km away from the lightning. The subsequent initial burst quickly\nsubsided with an exponential decay constant of 40-60 ms, followed by a\nprolonged line emission at about 0.511 megaelectronvolt (MeV), lasting for a\nminute. The observed decay timescale and spectral cutoff at about 10 MeV of the\ninitial emission are well explained with de-excitation gamma rays from the\nnuclei excited by neutron capture. The centre energy of the prolonged line\nemission corresponds to the electron-positron annihilation, and hence is the\nconclusive indication of positrons produced after the lightning. Our detection\nof neutrons and positrons is unequivocal evidence that natural lightning\ntriggers photonuclear reactions. No other natural event on the Earth is known\nto trigger photonuclear reactions. This discovery places lightning as only the\nsecond known natural channel on the Earth after the atmospheric cosmic-ray\ninteraction, in which isotopes, such as 13C, 14C, and 15N, are produced.\n", "  Identification and quantification of trace gas sources is a major challenge\nfor understanding and regulating air quality and greenhouse gas emissions.\nCurrent approaches either provide continuous but localized monitoring, or\nquasi-instantaneous 'snapshot-in-time' regional monitoring. There is a need for\nemissions detection that provides both continuous and regional coverage,\nbecause sources and sinks can be episodic and spatially variable. We field\ndeploy a dual frequency comb laser spectrometer for the first time, enabling an\nobserving system that provides continuous detection of trace gas sources over\nmultiple-square-kilometer regions. Field tests simulating methane emissions\nfrom oil and gas production demonstrate detection and quantification of a 1.6 g\nmin^-1 source (approximate emissions from a small pneumatic valve) from a\ndistance of 1 km, and the ability to discern two leaks among a field of many\npotential sources. The technology achieves the goal of detecting, quantifying,\nand attributing emissions sources continuously through time, over large areas,\nand at emissions rates ~1000x lower than current regional approaches. It\ntherefore provides a useful tool for monitoring and mitigating undesirable\nsources and closes a major information gap in the atmospheric sciences.\n", "  Using first-principles calculation methods, we reveal a series of phase\ntransitions as a function of electron doping in single-layer 1T$'$-MoTe$_2$ and\n1T$'$-WTe$_2$ exhibiting quantum spin Hall (QSH) edge states without doping. As\nincreasing doping, we show that a phonon mediated superconducting phase first\nrealizes and is followed by a charge density wave (CDW) phase with a\nnonsymmorphic lattice symmetry. The newly found CDW phase exhibits Dirac or\nWeyl energy bands with a spin-orbit coupling in case of a fractional band\nfilling and re-enters into topological insulating phase with fully filled\nbands. The robust resurgence of QSH state coexisting with the CDW phase is\nshown to originate from band inversions induced by the nonsymmorphic lattice\ndistortion through the strong electron-phonon interaction, thus suggesting a\nrealization of various interfacial states between superconducting, density wave\nand topological states on a two-dimensional crystal only by doping.\n", "  A significant number of oil paintings produced by Georgia O'Keeffe\n(1887-1986) show surface protrusions of varying width, up to several hundreds\nof microns. These protrusions are similar to those described in the art\nconservation literature as metallic soaps. Since the presence of these\nprotrusions raises questions about the state of conservation and long-term\nprospects for deterioration of these artworks, a 3D-imaging technique,\nphotometric stereo using ultraviolet illumination, was developed for the\nlong-term monitoring of the surface-shape of the protrusions and the\nsurrounding paint. Because the UV fluorescence response of painting materials\nis isotropic, errors typically caused by non-Lambertian (anisotropic)\nspecularities when using visible reflected light can be avoided providing a\nmore accurate estimation of shape. As an added benefit, fluorescence provides\nadditional contrast information contributing to materials characterization. The\ndeveloped methodology aims to detect, characterize, and quantify the\ndistribution of micro-protrusions and their development over the surface of\nentire artworks. Combined with a set of analytical in-situ techniques, and\ncomputational tools, this approach constitutes a novel methodology to\ninvestigate the selective distribution of protrusions in correlation with the\ncomposition of painting materials at the macro-scale. While focused on\nO'Keeffe's paintings as a case study, we expect the proposed approach to have\nbroader significance by providing a non-invasive protocol to the conservation\ncommunity to probe topological changes for any relatively flat painted surface\nof an artwork, and more specifically to monitor the dynamic formation of\nprotrusions, in relation to paint composition and modifications of\nenvironmental conditions, loans, exhibitions and storage over the long-term.\n", "  The analysis was carried out of the scattered signal in the cases of ground\nbackscatter and ionospheric scatter. The analysis is based on the data of the\ndecameter coherent EKB ISTP SB RAS radar. In the paper the signals scattered in\neach sounding run were analysed before their statistical averaging. Based on\nthe analysis and on previously studied mechanisms, a model is constructed for\nionospheric scatter and ground backscatter signals. Within the framework of the\nBayesian approach and based on a large amount of the data the technique and\nalgorithm for separating these two types of signals are constructed. The\nstatistical analysis of the results was carried out based on the EKB ISTP SB\nRAS data.\n", "  In an experiment on a magnetic dipole interacting with a laser-produced\nplasma the generation of an intense field aligned current (FAC) system was\nobserved for the first time in a laboratory. The detailed measurements of the\ntotal value and local current density, of the magnetic field at the poles and\nin the equatorial magnetopause, and particular features of electron motion in\nthe current channels revealed its similarity to the Region-1 current system in\nthe Earth magnetosphere. Such currents were found to exist only if they can\nclose via conductive cover of the dipole. Comparison of conductive and\ndielectric cases revealed specific magnetic features produced by FACand their\nconnection with electric potential generated in the equatorial part of the\nmagnetopause. To interpret the data we consider a model of electric potential\ngeneration in the boundary layer which agrees with experiment and with\nmeasurements of the Earth transpolar potential in the absence of an\ninterplanetary magnetic field as well. The results could be of importance for\nthe investigation of Mercury as a magnetic disturbance due to FAC could be\nespecially large because of the small size of the Hermean magnetosphere.\n", "  In this paper, we came to conclusion that there is a significant systematic\nerror in the SDO/HMI vector magnetic data, which reveals itself in a\nsignificant deviation of the lines of the knot magnetic fields from the radial\ndirection. The value of this deviation demonstrates a clear dependence on the\ndistance to the disk center. This paper suggests a method for correction of the\nvector magnetograms that eliminates the detected systematic error.\n", "  In previous experiments by the authors on a magnetic dipole interacting with\na laser-produced plasma the generation of an intense field-aligned current\n(FAC) system on terrella poles was observed. In this paper the question of the\norigin of these currents in a low-latitude boundary layer of magnetosphere is\ninvestigated. Experimental evidence of such a link was obtained by measurements\nof the magnetic field generated by tangential drag and sheared stress. This\nspecific azimuthal field was found to have quadruple symmetry and local maxima\ninside the magnetosphere adjacent to the boundary layer. Cases of metallic and\ndielectric dipole covers modeling good conductive and non-conductive ionosphere\nrevealed that the presence or absence of FACs results in different amplitudes\nand spatial structures of the sheared field. The current associated with the\nazimuthal field flows upward at the dawnside, and toward the equator plane at\nthe duskside. It was found to coincide by direction and to correspond by\namplitude to a total cross-polar current measured independently. The results\nsuggest that compressional and Alfven waves are responsible for FAC generation.\nThe study is most relevant to FACgeneration in the magnetospheres of Earth and\nMercury following pressure jumps in solar wind.\n", "  A specially designed and produced edge filter with pronounced nonlinear\neffects is carefully characterized. The nonlinear effects are estimated at the\nintensities close to the laser-induced damage.\n", "  The measurement of the Yukawa coupling of the top quark is one important goal\nof particle physics after the discovery of the Higgs boson. There are two\nprocesses that offer the possibility to directly measure the Yukawa coupling of\nthe top quark at the LHC. These are the production of a top-antitop-quark pair\nin association with a Higgs boson via the strong interaction ($t\\bar{t}H$) and\nthe electroweak production of a single top quark and a Higgs boson ($tH$). In\nthe Standard Model, the cross section for $tH$ production is much smaller than\nthe cross section for $t\\bar{t}H$ production as there is a destructive\ninterference between diagrams where the Higgs boson is radiated off a top quark\nand diagrams where it is radiated off a $W$ boson. Despite the reduced cross\nsection, this interference provides additional sensitivity to the sign of the\nYukawa coupling.\n  The considered Higgs boson decay into photons is promising due to the good\nenergy resolution of the photons and the relatively small backgrounds. But it\nis also challenging due to the small branching ratio.\n  The analysis strategy and the latest results on the search for $t\\bar{t}H/tH$\nproduction in the diphoton channel at the ATLAS experiment are presented.\n", "  We investigate the influence of ultrashort laser filaments on high-voltage\ndischarges and spark-free unloading at various repetition rates and wind\nconditions. For electric fields well below, close to and above the threshold\nfor discharges, we respectively observe remote spark-free unloading, discharge\nsuppression, and discharge guiding. These effects rely on an indirect\nconsequence of the thermal deposition, namely the fast dilution of the ions by\nthe shockwave triggered by the filament at each laser shot. This dilution\ndrastically limits recombination and increases the plasma channel conductivity\nthat can still be non-negligible after tens or hundreds of milliseconds. As a\nresult, the charge flow per pulse is higher at low repetition rates.\n", "  The geologic activity at Enceladus's south pole remains unexplained, though\ntidal deformations are probably the ultimate cause. Recent gravity and\nlibration data indicate that Enceladus's icy crust floats on a global ocean, is\nrather thin, and has a strongly non-uniform thickness. Tidal effects are\nenhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of\ntidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations\nof shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic\nthin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations\nof shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial\ndifferential equations of the 4th order on the sphere which take into account\nself-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity.\nIf the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas\nfor tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5%\nand 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the\nshell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of\ncoupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis. Compared to finite\nelement models, thin shell predictions are similar for the deformations due to\nEnceladus's pressurized ocean, but differ for the tides of Ganymede. If\nEnceladus's shell is conductive with isostatic thickness variations, surface\nstresses are approximately inversely proportional to the local shell thickness.\nThe radial tide is only moderately enhanced at the south pole. The combination\nof crustal thinning and convection below the poles can amplify south polar\nstresses by a factor of 10, but it cannot explain the apparent time lag between\nthe maximum plume brightness and the opening of tiger stripes. In a second\npaper, I will study tidal dissipation in a non-uniform crust.\n", "  Nitrogen-bearing molecules in cold molecular clouds exhibit a range of\nisotopic fractionation ratios and these molecules may be the precursors of\n$^{15}$N enrichments found in comets and meteorites. Chemical model\ncalculations indicate that atom-molecular ion and ion-molecule reactions could\naccount for most of the fractionation patterns observed. However, recent\nquantum-chemical computations demonstrate that several of the key processes are\nunlikely to occur in dense clouds. Related model calculations of dense cloud\nchemistry show that the revised $^{15}$N enrichments fail to match observed\nvalues. We have investigated the effects of these reaction rate modifications\non the chemical model of Wirstr\\\"{o}m et al. (2012) for which there are\nsignificant physical and chemical differences with respect to other models. We\nhave included $^{15}$N fractionation of CN in neutral-neutral reactions and\nalso updated rate coefficients for key reactions in the nitrogen chemistry. We\nfind that the revised fractionation rates have the effect of suppressing\n$^{15}$N enrichment in ammonia at all times, while the depletion is even more\npronounced, reaching $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios of >2000. Taking the updated\nnitrogen chemistry into account, no significant enrichment occurs in HCN or\nHNC, contrary to observational evidence in dark clouds and comets, although the\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio can still be below 100 in CN itself. However, such low\nCN abundances are predicted that the updated model falls short of explaining\nthe bulk $^{15}$N enhancements observed in primitive materials. It is clear\nthat alternative fractionating reactions are necessary to reproduce\nobservations, so further laboratory and theoretical studies are urgently\nneeded.\n", "  Side channel effects such as temporal disparity and intensity fluctuation of\nphoton pulses caused by random bit generation with multiple laser diodes in\nhigh-speed polarization-based BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) systems can\nbe eliminated by increasing DC bias current condition. However, background\nphotons caused by the spontaneous emission process under high DC bias current\ndegrade the performance of the QKD systems. In this study, we investigated, for\nthe first time, the effects of spontaneously emitted photons on the system\nperformance in a high-speed QKD system at a clock rate of 400 MHz. Also, we\nfurther show improvements of system performance without side channel effects by\nutilizing temporal filtering technique with real-time FPGA signal processing.\n", "  The electromagnetic response of an interacting system of pions has been\nstudied at finite temperature. The corresponding transport parameter i.e.\nelectrical conductivity has been estimated by solving the relativistic\ntransport equation in presence of a finite electric field employing the\nChapman-Enskog technique where the collision term has been treated in the\nrelaxation time approximation. The scattering amplitudes of charged pions\nmodeled by $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ meson exchange using an effective Lagrangian\nhave been obtained at finite temperature by introducing self-energy corrections\nin the thermal propagators in the real time formalism. The temperature behavior\nof electrical conductivity for a hot pion gas shows significant quantitative\nenhancement due to the inclusion of medium effects in scattering.\n", "  In this letter, we have considered an electron in a coupled quantum dot\nsystem interacting with a detector represented by a point contact. We present a\ndynamical model for wave function collapse in the strong coupling to the\ndetector limit. In our model, the electron in the double quantum dot makes a\nfast transition minimizing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. In this\nway, a principle of leats emitted radiation can provide a possible description\nof wave function collapse.\n", "  We study the equilibrium problem of a system consisting by several Kirchhoff\nrods linked in an arbitrary way and tied by a soap film, using techniques of\nthe Calculus of Variations. We prove the existence of a solution with minimum\nenergy, which may be quite irregular, and perform experiments confirming the\nkind of surface predicted by the model.\n", "  We introduce in an arbitrary supersymmetric version of the standard model\nwithout elementary scalars a logarithmic operator which is irrelevant in the\nlimit in which all symmetries are respected. However through a dynamical\nmechanism of the Nambu Jona Lasinio type this operator may produce two fermion\nvacuum condensates that may account for electroweak and contribute to\nsupersymmetry breaking. Some of the phenomenological consequences of this\nset-up are discussed.\n", "  We propose a novel scenario of inflation, in which the inflaton is identified\nas the lightest mode of an angular field in a compactified fifth dimension. The\nperiodic effective potential exhibits exponentially flat plateaus, so that a\nsub-Planckian field excursion without hilltop initial conditions is naturally\nrealized. We can obtain consistent predictions with observations on the\nspectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  We explore the phenomenological consequences of a model with axion-like\nparticles and hidden photons mixing with photons. In this model, the hidden\nphoton is directly coupled to the photon, while the axion coupling is induced\nby an external electromagnetic field. We consider vacuum effects on a polarised\nphoton beam, like changes in the ellipticity and rotation angles.\n", "  Quantum Key Distribution is a practically implementable information-theoretic\nsecure method for transmitting keys to remote partners performing quantum\ncommunication. After examining various protocols from the simplest such as QC\nand BB84 we move on to describe BBM92, DPSK, SARG04 and finally MDI from the\nlargest possible communication distance and highest secret key bitrate. We\ndiscuss how any protocol can be optimized by reviewing the various steps and\nunderlying assumptions proper to every protocol with the corresponding\nconsequence in each case.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride\n(h-BN) on the Raman spectrum of few layer black phosphorus. The encapsulation\nresults in a significant reduction of the line width of the Raman modes of\nblack phosphorus, due to a reduced phonon scattering rate. We observe a so far\nelusive peak in the Raman spectra $\\sim$4cm$^{-1}$ above the A$_{\\text{g}}^1$\nmode in trilayer and thicker flakes, which had not been observed\nexperimentally. The newly observed mode originates from the strong black\nphosphorus inter-layer interaction, which induces a hardening of the surface\natoms vibration with respect to the corresponding modes of the inner layers.\nThe observation of this mode suggests a significant impact of h-BN\nencapsulation on the properties of black phosphorus and can serve as an\nindicator of the quality of its surface.\n", "  A novel experiment has been commissioned at the Weizmann Institute of Science\nfor the study of weak interactions via a high-precision measurement of the\nbeta-neutrino angular correlation in the radioactive decay of short-lived\n$^{6}$He. The facility consists of a 14 MeV $d+t$ neutron generator to produce\natomic $^{6}$He, followed by ionization and bunching in an electron beam ion\nsource, and injection into an electrostatic ion beam trap. This ion trap has\nbeen designed for efficient detection of the decay products from trapped light\nions. The storage time in the trap for different stable ions was found to be in\nthe range of 0.6 to 1.2 s at the chamber pressure of $\\sim$7$\\times$10$^{-10}$\nmbar. We present the initial test results of the facility, and also demonstrate\nan important upgrade of an existing method \\cite{stora} for production of light\nradioactive atoms, viz. $^{6}$He, for the precision measurement. The production\nrate of $^{6}$He atoms in the present setup has been estimated to be $\\sim\n1.45\\times10^{-4}$ atoms per neutron, and the system efficiency was found to be\n4.0$\\pm$0.6\\%. An improvement to this setup is also presented for the enhanced\nproduction and diffusion of radioactive atoms for future use.\n", "  As shown in former papers, the nonadiabatic Heisenberg model presents a novel\nmechanism of Cooper pair formation generated by the strongly correlated\natomic-like motion of the electrons in narrow, roughly half-filled\n\"superconducting bands\". These are energy bands represented by optimally\nlocalized spin-dependent Wannier functions adapted to the symmetry of the\nmaterial under consideration. The formation of Cooper pairs is not the result\nof an attractive electron-electron interaction but can be described in terms of\nquantum mechanical constraining forces constraining the electrons to form\nCooper pairs. There is theoretical and experimental evidence that only this\nnonadiabatic mechanism operating in superconducting bands may produce\neigenstates in which the electrons form Cooper pairs. These constraining forces\nstabilize the Cooper pairs in any superconductor, whether conventional or\nunconventional. Here we report evidence that also the experimentally found\nsuperconducting state in bismuth at ambient as well as at high pressure is\nconnected with a narrow, roughly half-filled superconducting band in the\nrespective band structure. This observation corroborates once more the\nsignificance of constraining forces in the theory of superconductivity.\n", "  We describe the set of all Dirichlet forms associated to a given infinite\ngraph in terms of Dirichlet forms on its Royden boundary. Our approach is\npurely analytical and uses form methods.\n", "  In order to explain weak gravitation in our 4-dimensional universe, a\n6-dimensional model with a small extra 2D sphere is proposed. The traceless\nenergy-momentum tensor is quite naturally appeared in our 6-dimensional model.\nThe warp factor is given by $\\phi (\\theta ) = \\epsilon + \\sin{\\theta }$, where\n$\\epsilon $ plays a role of killing the singular point $\\phi (\\theta )=0$, and\nis assumed $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$. Any massive particle is rolling down into\npoints along this geodesic line. The light ray can be shown to stay in our\n4-dimensional universe. This suggest us that our 4-dimensional world can be\nlocated at $\\theta =0 $ and/or $\\theta = \\pi $, its background metric being\n$\\epsilon ^2 \\eta _{\\mu \\nu }$. As a result, we have the 4-dimensional Newton\nconstant, which is given by $G_N \\simeq G_6 \\epsilon ^{10}$ and the fifth force\ncoefficients appeared here are $\\alpha _i\\simeq \\epsilon ^{2(i-4)}$, $i=1, 2,\n3$. Here $G_6$ is the gravitational constant in 6-dimensional spacetime. If we\ntake $\\epsilon = 10^{-3.8}$ against $G_6\\sim 1($GeV$)^{-2}$, we get $G_N\\sim\n10^{-38}($Gev$)^{-2}$, the present time gravitational constant.\n", "  In the framework of the Gibbs statistical theory, the question of the size of\nthe particles forming the statistical system is investigated. This task is\nrelevant for a wide variety of applications. The distribution for particle\nsizes and the moments of this quantity are determined from probabilistic\nconsiderations. The results are compared with different models and\napproximations. The particle size depends on the interactions in the system, on\nthe compressibility factor, on the number of interacting particles. The cases\nof the absence and presence of a rigid incompressible particle core are\nconsidered.\n", "  In this paper, the spacetime geometry of Finch and Skea [Class. Quantum\nGrav., 6 (1989) 467] has been utilized to obtain closed-form solutions for a\nspherically symmetric anisotropic matter distribution. By examining its\nphysical admissibility, it has been shown that the class of solutions can be\nused as viable models for observed pulsars. In particular, a specific class of\nsolutions can be used as an `anisotropic switch' to examine the impact of\nanisotropy on the gross physical properties of a stellar configuration.\nAccordingly, the mass-radius relationship has been analyzed.\n", "  According to our microscopic cosmological model, masses of charged leptons\nare induced by curvatures of hyper-spherical surfaces embedded in a 3D\ntime-like subspace, leading to a solution of the lepton mass hierarchy problem\nand to a prediction of tauon mass for the first approximation. In the present\nstudy, for finest-tuning higher order approximations, there are some\ncorrections added to higher curvatures by contributions from lower ones. In the\nresult, the calculation in the third approximation $m_{\\tau}(theor)=1776.40$\nMeV fits the experimental tauon mass $m_{\\tau}(exp)=1776.82(\\pm.16)$ MeV within\n$0.024\\%$ of precision, reaching a fairly passable consistency better than\n$3\\sigma$. On one side, it implies that for a firm consistency, a hyper-fine\nadjustment of calculation by some additional mechanism is needed. On the other\nside, our theoretical quantity demonstrates an explicit physical\ninterpretation, which is in opposite to another theoretical calculation with a\nwonderful predictability by the empirical Koide formula $m_\\tau(Koide)=1776.97$\nMeV, i.e. within a deviation less than $1\\sigma$, unfortunately, being\nphysically unexplained. In the circumstances, a new attempt for upgrading\nexperimental accuracy of tauon mass is desirable.\n", "  This chapter describes briefly the key aspects behind the derivation of\nprecise radial velocities. I start by defining radial velocity precision in the\ncontext of astrophysics in general and exoplanet searches in particular. Next I\ndiscuss the different basic elements that constitute a spectrograph, and how\nthese elements and overall technical choices impact on the derived radial\nvelocity precision. Then I go on to discuss the different wavelength\ncalibration and radial velocity calculation techniques, and how these are\nintimately related to the spectrograph's properties. I conclude by presenting\nsome interesting examples of planets detected through radial velocity, and some\nof the new-generation instruments that will push the precision limit further.\n", "  Single top quark production through weak interactions is one of the important\nsource of charged Higgs in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In\nthe s-channel single top production having largest cross-section, a charged\nHiggs may appear in the intermediate phase as a heavy resonance state decaying\nto a top and b quark. The channel under consideration in this paper is $pp\n\\rightarrow H^{\\pm}\\rightarrow tb \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}W^{\\pm} \\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b}\\tau^{\\pm} \\nu_{\\tau}$, where top quark exclusively decay into b quark\nand W boson and W boson subsequently decays to $\\tau$ jet and neutrino. So the\nfinal state is charactersied by the presence of two b jets, hadronic $\\tau$\ndecay and missing transverse energy Due to the presence of large QCD multijet\nand electroweak background events at LHC, it has been demonstrated that the\ncharged Higgs singal can be observed within the available MSSM paramter space\n$(tan\\beta,m_{H^{\\pm}})$ respecting all experimental and theoretical\nconstraints. In order to show the observability potential of charged Higgs, the\nexclusion curves at 95$\\%$ confidence level and 5$\\sigma$ conoturs are plotted\nat different integrated luminosities with $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV.\n", "  Similarly to the previously studied case of inclusive $t\\bar t$ production we\nconsider the inclusive $t\\bar b$ production in $e^+e^-$, gluon~gluon and\nphoton~photon collisions. We show how it is sensitive to new physics, connected\nto the charged Goldstone sector and possibly generated by Higgs and/or top\nquark compositeness.\n", "  The flux emergence rate of AR 12673 is greater than any values reported in\nthe literature of which we are aware.\n", "  The general framework of envelope modulations for plasma turbulence in the\npresence of strong magnetic fields is discussed. It is shown that the problem\ncan be formulated using a functional which is equivalent to the plasma\ndielectric function for monochromatic waves. Therefore expanding around its\nlinear wave solutions, one can describe the weakly nonlinear evolution of\nwaves. The resulting \"quasi-linear\" dielectric tensor, can describe the\nevolution of small scale fluctuations advected and modulated by background\nflows and corrugations, as well as the evolution of the large scale flows\ndriven by small scales. As a concrete example of the framework, gyrokinetic\nevolution of zonal flows and drift waves is considered and the resulting\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation is derived.\n", "  We study the effect of image potential on spin polarized transport through\nFe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions in the presence of symmetry filtering. The\nimage potential is included within the Simmon's model coupled with the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism to calculate the quantum transport.\nThe increase in the current densities for the $\\Delta_1$ symmetry and the\n$\\Delta_5$ symmetry bands due to the image potential is more pronounced at\nhigher bias, whereas, the increase in the magnitude of the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance ratio is more prominent at lower bias for various barrier\nthicknesses.\n", "  In this contribution, we present BRITE observations of the early-B\nsupergiants $\\epsilon$ Ori and $\\kappa$ Ori. We perform a preliminary analysis\nof the data acquired over the first two Orion observing runs. We evaluate\nwhether they are compatible with co-rotating bright spots and discuss the\nchallenges of such an approach.\n", "  We consider the heat equations satisfied by the sigma function associated\nwith a planar curve, extending and developing earlier pioneering work of\nBuchstaber and Leykin. These heat equations lead to useful {\\em linear}\nrecursive relations for the coefficients of power series expansion of the sigma\nfunction. In particular we exhibit explicit results for curves of genus 3, and\ngive a new constructive proof of an explicit expression for the main matrix in\nthe theory for {\\em any} hyperelliptic curve. We also state and prove a new\nexplicit formula for the eigenvalues of the linear operators associated with\nthis matrix, as well as other practical formulae.\n", "  Here we investigate single crystals of CaCo$_{5}$As$_{3}$ by means of single\ncrystal X-ray diffraction, microprobe, magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity,\nand pressure-dependent transport measurements. CaCo$_{5}$As$_{3}$ shares the\nsame structure of CaFe$_{4}$As$_{3}$ with an additional Co atom filling a\nlattice vacancy and undergoes a magnetic transition at $T_{M} = 16$ K\nassociated with a frustrated magnetic order. CaCo$_{5}$As$_{3}$ displays\nmetallic behavior and its Sommerfeld coefficient ($\\gamma = 70$ mJ/mol.K$^{2}$)\nindicates a moderate enhancement of electron-electron correlations. Transport\ndata under pressures to $2.5$ GPa reveal a suppression of $T_{M}$ at a rate of\n$-0.008$ K/GPa. First-principle electronic structure calculations show a\ncomplex 3D band structure and magnetic moments that depend on the local\nenvironment at each Co site. Our results are compared with previous data on\nCaFe$_{4}$As$_{3}$ and provide a scenario for a magnetically frustrated ground\nstate in this family of compounds.\n", "  In my master thesis, I investigated the chiral-magnetic effect in the context\nof holography; I focused in especially on the impact of the chiral anomaly at\ntransport properties and non-equilbrium behaviour in response to an holographic\nquench. Concretely, I considered an $U(1)_\\text{A}\\times\nU(1)_\\text{V}$-Einstein-Maxwell bottom-up model consisting of two massless\ngauge fields, coupled by a Chern-Simons term in the fivedimensional AdS\nspacetime. The two gauge fields provide a time dependent electric field and a\nstatic magnetic field, parallel to it. As response of the system to quench, I\ninvestigated the electromagnetic current in direction of the magnetic field\nwhich is generated due to the CME. In the first part of the thesis, I\ncharacterised the initial response of the system, in a fixed Schwarzschild AdS\nbackground, subjected to a 'fast' quench. The corresponding hyperbolic PDE is\nsolved by means of a fully spectral code in spaces as well as in time\ndirection. Note that this was the first application of a fully spectral code\nwithin holography. In the case of 'fast' quenches, the system exhibits an\nuniversal scaling behaviour, independent of the external parameters as the\nstrength of the anomaly and the magnetic field, respectively. The late time\nbehaviour of the system shows, depending on the quench and external parameters,\nin some cases long lived oscillations in the current. Furthermore, I computed\nthe quasi-normal modes of the systems, including the backreaction of the matter\nfields on the background metric. It turns out that the long lived oscillations\nappear only in presence of the anomaly and can be traced back to the presence\nof Landau levels in the system. The results of my master thesis were partly\npublished in arXiv:1607.06817; however, the thesis contains a lot of\ninteresting, and so far unpublished, results and can be viewed as extended\nversion of the paper.\n", "  We develop a Mellin transform framework which allows us to simultaneously\nanalyze the four known exactly solvable 1+1 dimensional lattice polymer models:\nthe log-gamma, strict-weak, beta, and inverse-beta models. Using this framework\nwe prove the conjectured fluctuation exponents of the free energy and the\npolymer path for the stationary point-to-point versions of these four models.\nThe fluctuation exponent for the polymer path was previously unproved for the\nstrict-weak, beta, and inverse-beta models.\n", "  We numerically performed wave dynamical simulations based on the\nMaxwell-Bloch (MB) model for a quadrupole-deformed microcavity laser with\nspatially selective pumping. We demonstrate the appearance of an asymmetric\nlasing mode whose spatial pattern violates both the x- and y-axes mirror\nsymmetries of the cavity. Dynamical simulations revealed that a lasing mode\nconsisting of a clockwise or counterclockwise rotating-wave component is a\nstable stationary solution of the MB model. From the results of a\npassive-cavity mode analysis, we interpret these asymmetric rotating-wave\nlasing modes by the locking of four nearly degenerate passive-cavity modes. For\ncomparison, we carried out simulations for a uniform pumping case and found a\ndifferent locking rule for the nearly degenerate modes. Our results demonstrate\na nonlinear dynamical mechanism for the formation of a lasing mode that adjusts\nits pattern to a pumped area.\n", "  The speed of writing of state-of-the-art ferromagnetic memories is physically\nlimited by an intrinsic GHz threshold. Recently, an alternative research\ndirection has been initiated by realizing memory devices based on\nantiferromagnets in which spin directions periodically alternate from one\natomic lattice site to the next. In our work we experimentally demonstrate at\nroom temperature that the speed of reversible electrical writing in a memory\ndevice can be scaled up to THz using an antiferromagnet. Efficient\ncurrent-induced spin-torque mechanism is responsible for the switching in our\nmemory devices throughout the twelve orders of magnitude range of writing\nspeeds from Hz to THz. Our work opens the path towards the development of\nmemory-logic technology reaching the elusive THz band.\n", "  Eigenvector-based centrality measures are among the most popular centrality\nmeasures in network science. The underlying idea is intuitive and the\nmathematical description is extremely simple in the framework of standard,\nmono-layer networks. Moreover, several efficient computational tools are\navailable for their computation. Moving up in dimensionality, several efforts\nhave been made in the past to describe an eigenvector-based centrality measure\nthat generalizes Bonacich index to the case of multiplex networks. In this\nwork, we propose a new definition of eigenvector centrality that relies on the\nPerron eigenvector of a multi-homogeneous map defined in terms of the tensor\ndescribing the network. We prove that existence and uniqueness of such\ncentrality are guaranteed under very mild assumptions on the multiplex network.\nExtensive numerical studies are proposed to test the newly introduced\ncentrality measure and to compare it to other existing eigenvector-based\ncentralities.\n"]}
