Classical\npolynomials, such as the Hermite polynomials, have roots that describe the\nequilibria of identical vortices on the line. Stationary and uniformly\ntranslating vortex configurations with vortices of the same strength but\npositive or negative orientation are given by the zeros of the Adler-Moser\npolynomials, which arise in the description of rational solutions of the\nKorteweg-de Vries equation. For quadupole background flow, vortex\nconfigurations are given by the zeros of polynomials expressed as wronskians of\nHermite polynomials. Further new solutions are found in this case using the\nspecial polynomials arising the in the description of rational solutions of the\nfourth Painleve equation.\n", "  In this work are computed analytical solutions for orbital motion on a\nbackground described by an Expanding Locally Anisotropic (ELA) metric ansatz.\nThis metric interpolates between the Schwarzschild metric near the central mass\nand the Robertson-Walker metric describing the expanding cosmological\nbackground far from the central mass allowing for a fine-tuneable covariant\nparameterization of gravitational interactions corrections in between these two\nasymptotic limits. In particular it is shown that the decrease of the Sun's\nmass by radiation emission plus the General Relativity corrections due to the\nELA metric background with respect to Schwarzschild backgrounds can be mapped\nto the reported yearly variation of the gravitational constant $\\dot{G}$\nthrough Kepler's third law. Based on the value of the heuristic fit\ncorresponding to the more recent heliocentric ephemerides of the Solar System\nare derived bounds for the value of a constant parameter $\\alpha_0$ for the ELA\nmetric as well as the maximal corrections to perihelion advance and orbital\nradii variation within this framework. Hence it is shown that employing the ELA\nmetric as a functional covariant parameterization to model gravitational\ninteractions corrections within the Solar System allows to maintain the\nmeasurement projection standards constant over time, specifically both the\nAstronomical Unit ($AU$) and the Gravitational constant ($G$). Also it is noted\nthat the effect obtained is not homogeneous for all planetary orbits\nconsistently with the diversity of estimates in the literature obtained\nassuming Schwarzschild backgrounds.\n", "  AlfaMC is a Monte Carlo simulation code for the transport of alpha particles.\nThe code is based on the Continuous Slowing Down Approximation and uses the\nNIST/ASTAR stopping-power database. The code uses a powerful geometrical\npackage allowing the coding of complex geometries. A flexible histogramming\npackage is used which greatly easies the scoring of results. The code is\ntailored for microdosimetric applications where speed is a key factor.\nComparison with the SRIM code is made for transmitted energy in thin layers and\nrange for air, mylar, aluminum and gold. The general agreement between the two\ncodes is good for beam energies between 1 and 12 MeV. The code is open-source\nand released under the General Public Licence.\n", "  We discuss the relationship between the recurrence coefficients of orthogonal\npolynomials with respect to a semi-classical Laguerre weight and classical\nsolutions of the fourth Painlev\\'e equation. We show that the coefficients in\nthese recurrence relations can be expressed in terms of Wronskians of parabolic\ncylinder functions which arise in the description of special function solutions\nof the fourth Painlev\\'e equation.\n", "  The mass-radius relations for white dwarf stars are investigated by solving\nthe Newtonian as well as Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for\nhydrostatic equilibrium assuming the electron gas to be non-interacting. We\nfind that the Newtonian limiting mass of $1.4562M_\\odot$ is modified to\n$1.4166M_\\odot$ in the general relativistic case for $^4_2$He (and $^{12}_{\\\n6}$C) white dwarf stars. Using the same general relativistic treatment, the\ncritical mass for $^{56}_{26}$Fe white dwarf is obtained as $1.2230M_\\odot$. In\naddition, departure from the ideal degenerate equation of state (EoS) is\naccounted for by considering Salpeter's EoS along with the TOV equations\nyielding slightly lower values for the critical masses, namely\n$1.4081M_{\\odot}$ for $^4_2$He, $1.3916M_{\\odot}$ for $^{12}_{\\ 6}$C and\n$1.1565M_{\\odot}$ for $^{56}_{26}$Fe white dwarfs. We also compare the critical\ndensities for gravitational instability with the neutronization threshold\ndensities to find that $^4_2$He and $^{12}_{\\ 6}$C white dwarf stars are stable\nagainst neutronization with the critical values of $1.4081M_\\odot$ and\n$1.3916M_{\\odot}$, respectively. However the critical masses for $^{16}_{\\\n8}$O, $^{20}_{10}$Ne, $^{24}_{12}$Mg, $^{28}_{14}$Si, $^{32}_{16}$S and\n$^{56}_{26}$Fe white dwarf stars are lower due to neutronization. Corresponding\nto their central densities for neutronization thresholds, we obtain their\nmaximum stable masses due to neutronization by solving the TOV equation coupled\nwith the Salpeter EoS.\n", "  We present a fast and accurate algorithm to solve Poisson problems in complex\ngeometries, using regular Cartesian grids. We consider a variety of\nconfigurations, including Poisson problems with interfaces across which the\nsolution is discontinuous (of the type arising in multi-fluid flows). The\nalgorithm is based on a combination of the Correction Function Method (CFM) and\nBoundary Integral Methods (BIM). Interface and boundary conditions can be\ntreated in a fast and accurate manner using boundary integral equations, and\nthe associated BIM. Unfortunately, BIM can be costly when the solution is\nneeded everywhere in a grid, e.g. fluid flow problems. We use the CFM to\ncircumvent this issue. The solution from the BIM is used to rewrite the problem\nas a series of Poisson problems in rectangular domains - which requires the BIM\nsolution at interfaces/boundaries only. These Poisson problems involve\ndiscontinuities at interfaces, of the type that the CFM can handle. Hence we\nuse the CFM to solve them (to high order of accuracy) with finite differences\nand a Fast Fourier Transform based fast Poisson solver. We present 2-D examples\nof the algorithm applied to Poisson problems involving complex geometries,\nincluding cases in which the solution is discontinuous. We show that the\nalgorithm produces solutions that converge with either 3rd or 4th order of\naccuracy, depending on the type of boundary condition and solution\ndiscontinuity.\n", "  We address the use of entangled qubits as quantum probes to characterize the\nnoise induced by complex environments. In particular, we show that a joint\nmeasurement on entangled probes can improve estimation of the correlation time\nfor a broad class of environmental noises compared to any sequential strategy\ninvolving single qubit preparation. The enhancement appears when the noise is\nfaster than a threshold value, a regime which may always be achieved by tuning\nthe coupling between the quantum probe and the environment inducing the noise.\nOur scheme exploits time-dependent sensitivity of quantum systems to\ndecoherence and does not require dynamical control on the probes. We derive the\noptimal interaction time and the optimal probe preparation, showing that it\ncorresponds to multiqubit GHZ states when entanglement is useful. We also show\nrobustness of the scheme against depolarization or dephasing of the probe, and\ndiscuss simple measurements approaching optimal precision.\n", "  We prove that approximating the ground energy of the antiferromagnetic XY\nmodel on a simple graph at fixed magnetization (given as part of the instance\nspecification) is QMA-complete. To show this, we strengthen a previous result\nby establishing QMA-completeness for approximating the ground energy of the\nBose-Hubbard model on simple graphs. Using a connection between the XY and\nBose-Hubbard models that we exploited in previous work, this establishes\nQMA-completeness of the XY model.\n", "  We consider certain self-adjoint observables for the KMS state associated to\nthe Hamiltonian $H= \\sigma^x \\otimes \\sigma^x$ over the quantum spin lattice\n$\\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^2 \\otimes ...$. For a\nfixed observable of the form $L \\otimes L \\otimes L \\otimes ...$, where\n$L:\\mathbb{C}^2 \\to \\mathbb{C}^2 $, and for the zero temperature limit one can\nget a naturally defined stationary probability $\\mu$ on the Bernoulli space\n$\\{1,2\\}^\\mathbb{N}$. This probability is ergodic but it is not mixing for the\nshift map. It is not a Gibbs state for a continuous normalized potential but\nits Jacobian assume only two values almost everywhere. Anyway, for such\nprobability $\\mu$ we can show that a Large Deviation Principle is true for a\ncertain class of functions. The result is derived by showing the explicit form\nof the free energy which is differentiable.\n", "  We describe the implementation of the two-loop Higgs-mass corrections of\n$\\mathcal{O}{\\left(\\alpha_t^2\\right)}$ in the complex MSSM in $\\tt{FeynHiggs}$.\nThe program for the calculation is included in $\\tt{FeynHiggs}$ and documented\nhere in some detail such that it can be re-used as a template for similar\ncalculations.\n", "  We show that the alternative discrete Painlev\\'e I equation (alt-dP$_{\\rm\nI}$) has a unique solution which remains positive for all $n \\geq 0$.\nFurthermore, we identify this positive solution in terms of a special solution\nof the second Painlev\\'e equation (P$_{\\rm II}$) involving the Airy function\n$\\mathop{\\rm Ai}(t)$. The special-function solutions of P$_{\\rm II}$ involving\nonly the Airy function $\\mathop{\\rm Ai}(t)$ therefore have the property that\nthey remain positive for all $n\\geq 0$ and all $t \\geq 0$, which is a new\ncharacterization of these special solutions of P$_{\\rm II}$ and alt-dP$_{\\rm\nI}$.\n", "  In this paper we discuss Airy solutions of the second Painlev\\'e equation\n(\\mbox{\\rm P$_{\\rm II}$}) and two related equations, the Painlev\\'e XXXIV\nequation ($\\mbox{\\rm P}_{34}$) and the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\\sigma$ form of\n\\mbox{\\rm P$_{\\rm II}$}\\ (\\mbox{\\rm S$_{\\rm II}$}), are discussed. It is shown\nthat solutions which depend only on the Airy function $\\mathop{\\rm\nAi}\\nolimits(z)$ have a completely difference structure to those which involve\na linear combination of the Airy functions $\\mathop{\\rm Ai}\\nolimits(z)$ and\n$\\mathop{\\rm Bi}\\nolimits(z)$. For all three equations, the special solutions\nwhich depend only on $\\mathop{\\rm Ai}\\nolimits(t)$ are \\textit{tronqu\\'ee}\nsolutions, i.e.\\ they have no poles in a sector of the complex plane. Further\nfor both $\\mbox{\\rm P}_{34}$\\ and \\mbox{\\rm S$_{\\rm II}$}, it is shown that\namongst these \\textit{tronqu\\'ee} solutions there is a family of solutions\nwhich have no poles on the real axis.\n", "  The present study is based on a generalized form of Brans-Dicke (BD) theory\nwhere, the dimensionless BD parameter is regarded as a function of the scalar\nfield, which is reciprocal of the gravitational constant. The field equations\nhave been solved by incorporating an empirical function f(t) in the expression\nrepresenting the conservation of matter. This function f(t) has been chosen to\naccount for a conversion of matter (both dark and baryonic) into some other\nform, possibly dark energy, which is known to be responsible for the\naccelerated expansion of universe. The requirement of a signature flip of the\ndeceleration parameter (q), which is evident from other studies, sets the\nboundary conditions to be satisfied by the function f(t), leading to the\nformulation of its time dependence. A simple empirical relation was initially\nassumed to represent the time dependence of f(t), and the constants in this\nexpression have been determined from these boundary conditions. The BD\nparameter has been found to have a negative value throughout the range of\nstudy. The dependence of BD parameter upon the scalar field has been depicted\ngraphically. A smooth transition of the universe, from a decelerated to an\naccelerated phase of expansion, is found to occur due to a conversion of matter\ninto dark energy. The gravitational constant is found to be increasing with\ntime.\n", "  In this paper we try to work out in detail the implications of a microscopic\ntheory for capillary waves under the assumption that the density is given along\nlines normal to the interface. Our study provides interface Hamiltonians for\nadsorbed films in a variety of systems, and shows that the corrections to the\nclassical capillary wave spectrum are of the same order as the surface tension.\nThis implies that it is possible, at least in principle, to measure them in\nx-ray surface scattering experiments. Interestingly, our study also sheds some\nlight on the nature of the liquid-vapor interface in the absence of external\nfields and allows us to reconcile the Fisk-Widom scaling hypothesis with\ncapillary wave theory.\n", "  We use ultrafast x-ray and electron diffraction to disentangle spin-lattice\ncoupling of granular FePt in the time domain. The reduced dimensionality of\nsingle-crystalline FePt nanoparticles leads to strong coupling of magnetic\norder and a highly anisotropic three-dimensional lattice motion characterized\nby a- and b-axis expansion and c-axis contraction. The resulting increase of\nthe FePt lattice tetragonality, the key quantity determining the energy barrier\nbetween opposite FePt magnetization orientations, persists for tens of\npicoseconds. These results suggest a novel approach to laser-assisted magnetic\nswitching in future data storage applications.\n", "  We review some recent results on eigenvalues of fractional Laplacians and\nfractional Schr\\\"odinger operators. We discuss, in particular, Lieb-Thirring\ninequalities and their generalizations, as well as semi-classical asymptotics.\n", "  The present study, on the expansion of universe, is based on an assumption\nregarding the possibility of inter-conversion between matter and dark energy,\nthrough some interaction of matter with the scalar field in the framework of\nBrans-Dicke theory. The field equations for a spatially flat space-time have\nbeen solved using an empirical dependence of scalar field parameter upon the\nscale factor. To represent the behaviour regarding the non-conservation of\nmatter, a function, expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter, has been\nempirically incorporated into the field equations. Their solution shows that,\nthis function, whose value is proportional to the matter content of the\nuniverse, decreases monotonically with time. This matter-field interaction\ngenerates late time acceleration, causing the deceleration parameter to change\nits sign from positive to negative. Time dependence of the proportion of dark\nenergy component of the universe has been determined and shown graphically.\nTime variation of gravitational constant and the Brans-Dicke dimensionless\nparameter has been analyzed in the present study. The rate of generation of\ndark energy from matter has been found to affect the time variations of\ndeceleration parameter and gravitational constant.\n", "  We introduce multiscale invariant dictionaries to estimate quantum chemical\nenergies of organic molecules, from training databases. Molecular energies are\ninvariant to isometric atomic displacements, and are Lipschitz continuous to\nmolecular deformations. Similarly to density functional theory (DFT), the\nmolecule is represented by an electronic density function. A multiscale\ninvariant dictionary is calculated with wavelet scattering invariants. It\ncascades a first wavelet transform which separates scales, with a second\nwavelet transform which computes interactions across scales. Sparse scattering\nregressions give state of the art results over two databases of organic planar\nmolecules. On these databases, the regression error is of the order of the\nerror produced by DFT codes, but at a fraction of the computational cost.\n", "  A theoretical model of cosmic expansion has been formulated on an assumption\nof inter-conversion of matter and dark energy, in the framework of Brans-Dicke\ntheory. An empirical scale factor has been used, which generates a signature\nflip of the deceleration parameter with time. To account for the\nnon-conservation of matter, a function of time f(t) is incorporated into the\nequation representing the density of matter. Its value at any instant of time\nis proportional to the matter content of the universe. The functional form of\nf(t) has been determined from the field equations by using an empirical scalar\nfield parameter expressed in terms of the scale factor. It is found to decrease\nwith time almost monotonically, implying a conversion of matter into dark\nenergy. Using this function f(t), the time variation of the density of matter\nhas been determined and also the expressions regarding the proportions of\nmatter and dark energy of the universe have been formulated. Time variation of\ngravitational constant, its fractional rate of change and the Brans-Dicke\ndimensionless parameter has been analyzed. The dependence of Brans-Dicke\nparameter upon the scalar field has been determined. The present study enables\nus to correlate the change of matter content with the change of deceleration\nparameter and gravitational constant without using any specific mechanism of\ninteraction between matter and scalar field.\n", "  We consider the semi-classical generalized Freud weight function\n\\[w_{\\lambda}(x;t) = |x|^{2\\lambda+1}\\exp(-x^4 +tx^2),\\qquad x\\in\\mathbb{R},\\]\nwith $ \\lambda>-1$ and $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$ parameters. We analyze the asymptotic\nbehavior of the sequences of monic polynomials that are orthogonal with respect\nto $w_{\\lambda}(x;t)$, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the recurrence\ncoefficient, when the degree, or alternatively, the parameter $t$, tend to\ninfinity. We also investigate existence and uniqueness of positive solutions of\nthe nonlinear difference equation satisfied by the recurrence coefficients and\nprove properties of the zeros of the generalized Freud polynomials.\n", "  Domino tilings of the two-periodic Aztec diamond feature all of the three\npossible types of phases of random tiling models. These phases are determined\nby the decay of correlations between dominoes and are generally known as solid,\nliquid and gas. The liquid-solid boundary is easy to define microscopically and\nis known in many models to be described by the Airy process in the limit of a\nlarge random tiling. The liquid-gas boundary has no obvious microscopic\ndescription. Using the height function we define a random measure in the\ntwo-periodic Aztec diamond designed to detect the long range correlations\nvisible at the liquid-gas boundary. We prove that this random measure converges\nto the extended Airy point process. This indicates that, in a sense, the\nliquid-gas boundary should also be described by the Airy process.\n", "  It is shown that Einstein's field equations for \\emph{all} perfect-fluid\n$k=0$ FLRW cosmologies have the same form as the topological normal form of a\nfold bifurcation. In particular, we assume that the cosmological constant is a\nbifurcation parameter, and as such, fold bifurcation behaviour is shown to\noccur in a neighbourhood of Minkowski spacetime in the phase space. We show\nthat as this cosmological constant parameter is varied, an expanding and\ncontracting de Sitter universe \\emph{emerge} via this bifurcation.\n", "  We investigate $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric quantum systems\nultra-weakly coupled to an environment. We find that such open systems evolve\nunder $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric, purely dephasing and unital dynamics.\nThe dynamical map describing the evolution is then determined explicitly using\na quantum canonical transformation. Furthermore, we provide an explanation of\nwhy $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric dephasing type interactions lead to\n\\emph{critical slowing down of decoherence}. This effect is further exemplified\nwith an experimentally relevant system -- a $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric\nqubit easily realizable, \\emph{e.g.}, in optical or microcavity experiments.\n", "  The spin Hall effect allows generation of spin current when charge current is\npassed along materials with large spin orbit coupling. It has been recently\npredicted that heat current in a non-magnetic metal can be converted into spin\ncurrent via a process referred to as the spin Nernst effect. Here we report the\nobservation of the spin Nernst effect in W. In W/CoFeB/MgO heterostructures, we\nfind changes in the longitudinal and transverse voltages with magnetic field\nwhen temperature gradient is applied across the film. The field-dependence of\nthe voltage resembles that of the spin Hall magnetoresistance. A comparison of\nthe temperature gradient induced voltage and the spin Hall magnetoresistance\nallows direct estimation of the spin Nernst angle. We find the spin Nernst\nangle of W to be similar in magnitude but opposite in sign with its spin Hall\nangle. Interestingly, under an open circuit condition, such sign difference\nresults in spin current generation larger than otherwise. These results\nhighlight the distinct characteristics of the spin Nernst and spin Hall\neffects, providing pathways to explore materials with unique band structures\nthat may generate large spin current with high efficiency.\n", "  Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and key agent for many industrial\nchemical processes1. One method for generating hydrogen sustainably is via the\nhydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which electrochemical reduction of\nprotons is mediated by an appropriate catalyst-traditionally, an expensive\nplatinum-group metal. Scalable production requires catalyst alternatives that\ncan lower materials or processing costs while retaining the highest possible\nactivity. Strategies have included dilute alloying of Pt2 or employing less\nexpensive transition metal alloys, compounds or heterostructures (e.g., NiMo,\nmetal phosphides, pyrite sulfides, encapsulated metal nanoparticles)3-5.\nRecently, low-cost, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (MX2)6 based on\nmolybdenum and tungsten have attracted substantial interest as alternative HER\ncatalysts7-11. These materials have high intrinsic per-site HER activity;\nhowever, a significant challenge is the limited density of active sites, which\nare concentrated at the layer edges.8,10,11. Here we use theory to unravel\nelectronic factors underlying catalytic activity on MX2 surfaces, and leverage\nthe understanding to report group-5 MX2 (H-TaS2 and H-NbS2) electrocatalysts\nwhose performance instead derives from highly active basal-plane sites. Beyond\nexcellent catalytic activity, they are found to exhibit an unusual ability to\noptimize their morphology for enhanced charge transfer and accessibility of\nactive sites as the HER proceeds. This leads to long cycle life and practical\nadvantages for scalable processing. The resulting performance is comparable to\nPt and exceeds all reported MX2 candidates.\n", "  One-dimensional photonic crystals with slowly varying, i.e. \"chirped\",\nlattice period are responsible for broadband light reflectance in many diverse\nbiological contexts, ranging from the shiny coatings of various beetles to the\neyes of certain butterflies. We present a quantum scattering analogy for light\nreflection from these adiabatically chirped photonic crystals (ACPCs) and apply\na WKB-type approximation to obtain a closed-form expression for the\nreflectance. From this expression we infer several design principles, including\na differential equation for the chirp pattern required to elicit a given\nreflectance spectrum and the minimal number of bilayers required to exceed a\ndesired reflectance threshold. Comparison of the number of bilayers found in\nACPCs throughout nature and our predicted minimal required number also gives a\nquantitative measure of the optimality of chirped biological reflectors.\nTogether these results elucidate the design principles of chirped reflectors in\nnature and their possible application to future optical technologies.\n", "  We study rational solutions of the Boussinesq equation, which is a soliton\nequation solvable by the inverse scattering method. These rational solutions,\nwhich are algebraically decaying and depend on two arbitrary parameters, are\nexpressed in terms of special polynomials that are derived through a bilinear\nequation, have a similar appearance to rogue-wave solutions of the focusing\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation and have an interesting structure.\nFurther rational solutions of the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili I (KPI) equation are\nderived in two ways, from rational solutions of the NLS equation and from\nrational solutions of the Boussinesq equation. It is shown that the two\nfamilies of rational solutions of the KPI equation are fundamentally different.\n", "  We investigate $L^1\\to L^\\infty$ dispersive estimates for the three\ndimensional Dirac equation with a potential. We also classify the structure of\nobstructions at the thresholds of the essential spectrum as being composed of a\ntwo dimensional space of resonances and finitely many eigenfunctions. We show\nthat, as in the case of the Schr\\\"odinger evolution, the presence of a\nthreshold obstruction generically leads to a loss of the natural $t^{-\\frac32}$\ndecay rate. In this case we show that the solution operator is composed of a\nfinite rank operator that decays at the rate $t^{-\\frac12}$ plus a term that\ndecays at the rate $t^{-\\frac32}$.\n", "  We consider the problem of deciding if a set of quantum one-qudit gates\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{g_1,\\ldots,g_n\\}\\subset G$ is universal, i.e if the closure\n$\\overline{<\\mathcal{S}>}$ is equal to $G$, where $G$ is either the special\nunitary or the special orthogonal group. To every gate $g$ in $\\mathcal{S}$ we\nasign its image under the adjoint representation $\\mathrm{Ad}_g$, where\n$\\mathrm{Ad}:G\\rightarrow SO(\\mathfrak{g})$ and $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie\nalgebra of $G$. The necessary condition for the universality of $\\mathcal{S}$\nis that the only matrices that commute with all $\\mathrm{Ad}_{g_i}$'s are\nproportional to the identity. If in addition there is an element in\n$<\\mathcal{S}>$ whose Hilbert-Schmidt distance from the centre of $G$ belongs\nto $]0,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}]$, then $\\mathcal{S}$ is universal. Using these we\nprovide a simple algorithm that allows deciding the universality of any set of\n$d$-dimensional gates in a finite number of steps and formulate the general\nclassification theorem.\n", "  The field of spintronics involves the study of both spin and charge transport\nin solid state devices with a view toward increasing their functionality and\nefficiency. Alternatively, the field of ultrafast magnetism focuses on the use\nof femtosecond laser pulses to excite electrons in magnetic materials, which\nallows the magnetic order to be dramatically changed on unprecedented\nsub-picosecond time-scales. Here, we unite these two distinct research\nactivities by using picosecond electrical pulses to rapidly excite electrons in\na magnetic metal. We are able to deterministically and repetitively reverse the\nmagnetization of a GdFeCo film with sub-10 picosecond electrical pulses. The\nmagnetization reverses in ~10ps, which is more than an order of magnitude\nfaster than any other electrically controlled magnetic switching. We attribute\nthe deterministic switching of the magnetization to ultrafast excitation of the\nelectrons, a fundamentally different mechanism from other current driven\nswitching mechanisms such as spin-transfer-torque (STT) or spin-orbit-torque\n(SOT). The energy density required for switching is measured and the process is\nfound to be efficient, projecting to only 4 fJ needed to switch a (20 nm)^3\ncell, which is comparable to other state-of-the-art STT-MRAM memory devices.\nThis discovery will launch a new field of research into picosecond spintronic\nphenomena and devices.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is among the most fundamental, yet from classical\nintuition also most surprising properties of the fully quantum nature of\nphysical reality. We report several experiments performed on IBM's Quantum\nExperience demonstrating envariance -- entanglement assisted invariance.\nEnvariance is a recently discovered symmetry of composite quantum systems,\nwhich is at the foundational origin of physics and a quantum phenomenon of pure\nstates. These very easily reproducible and freely accessible experiments on\nQuantum Experience provide simple tools to study the properties of envariance,\nand we illustrate this for several cases with \"quantum universes\" consisting of\nup to five qubits.\n", "  Topological error correction codes are promising candidates to protect\nquantum computations from the deteriorating effects of noise. While some codes\nprovide high noise thresholds suitable for robust quantum memories, others\nallow straightforward gate implementation needed for data processing. To\nexploit the particular advantages of different topological codes for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation, it is necessary to be able to switch\nbetween them. Here we propose a practical solution, subsystem lattice surgery,\nwhich requires only two-body nearest neighbor interactions in a fixed layout in\naddition to the indispensable error correction. This method can be used for the\nfault-tolerant transfer of quantum information between arbitrary topological\nsubsystem codes in two dimensions and beyond. In particular, it can be employed\nto create a simple interface, a quantum bus, between noise resilient surface\ncode memories and flexible color code processors.\n", "  Cavity optomechanics is a tool to study the interaction between light and\nmicromechanical motion. Here we observe near-quantum limited optomechanical\nphysics in a truly macroscopic oscillator. As the mechanical system, we use a\nmm-sized piezoelectric quartz disk oscillator. Its motion is coupled to a\ncharge qubit which translates the piezo-induced charge into an effective\nradiation-pressure interaction between the disk and a microwave cavity. We\nmeasure the thermal motion of the lowest mechanical shear mode at 7MHz down to\n35 mK, corresponding to roughly 100 quanta in a 20mg oscillator. The work opens\nup opportunities for macroscopic quantum experiments.\n", "  These notes are based on some lectures that the author gave at the University\nof Campinas - UNICAMP. The notes are in Portuguese, and deal with some methods\nof mathematics applied to Fluid Mechanics.\n", "  Pure reconstruction phases, geometric and dynamic, are computed in the\n$N$-point-vortex model in the plane, for the cases $N=3$ and $N=4$. The phases\nare computed relative to a metric-orthogonal connection on appropriately\ndefined principal fiber bundles. The metric is similar to the kinetic energy\nmetric for point masses but with the masses replaced by vortex strengths. The\ngeometric phases are shown to be proportional to areas enclosed by the closed\norbit on the symmetry reduced spaces. More interestingly, simple formulae are\nobtained for the dynamic phases, analogous to Montgomery's result for the free\nrigid body, which show them to be proportional to the time period of the\nsymmetry reduced closed orbits. For the case $ N = 3 $ a non-zero total vortex\nstrength is assumed. For the case $ N = 4 $ the vortex strengths are assumed\nequal.\n", "  We show that if a set of four mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) in\n$\\mathbb{C}^6$ exists and contains the identity, then any other basis in the\nset contains at most two product states and at the same time has Schmidt rank\nat least three. Here both the product states and the Schmidt rank are defined\nover the bipartite space $\\mathbb{C}^2\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^3$. We also investigate\nthe connection of the Sinkhorn normal form of unitary matrices to the fact that\nthere is at least one vector unbiased to any two orthonormal bases in any\ndimension.\n", "  We study the details of the distribution of the entanglement spectrum\n(eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix) of a disordered spin chain\nexhibiting a many-body localization (MBL) transition. In the thermalizing\nregion we identify the evolution under increasing system size of the\neigenvalues distribution function, whose thermodynamic limit is close (but\npossibly different from) the Marchenko-Pastur distribution. From the analysis\nwe extract a correlation length $L_s(h)$ determining the minimum system size to\nenter the asymptotic region. We find that $L_s(h)$ diverges at the MBL\ntransition. We discuss the nature of the subleading corrections to the\nentanglement spectrum distribution and to the entanglement entropy.\n", "  Quantum algorithms for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics have been extensively\ndeveloped, but there has been much less work on quantum algorithms for\nsimulating the dynamics of open quantum systems. We give the first efficient\nquantum algorithms for simulating Markovian quantum dynamics generated by\nLindbladians that are not necessarily local. We introduce two approaches to\nsimulating sparse Lindbladians. First, we show how to simulate Lindbladians\nthat act within small invariant subspaces using a quantum algorithm to\nimplement sparse Stinespring isometries. Second, we develop a method for\nsimulating sparse Lindblad operators by concatenating a sequence of short-time\nevolutions. We also show limitations on Lindbladian simulation by proving a\nno-fast-forwarding theorem for simulating sparse Lindbladians in black-box\nmodels.\n", "  Frequently in Physics, insights and conclusions can be drawn from simple,\nidealized models. The discovery of critical behavior in the gravitational\ncollapse of a massless scalar field leads to the simulation of binary black\nholes, from its coalescence to merging and ringdown. We refined a toy model to\nexplore black hole formation as these events unfold to revisit the instability\nof a gravitational kink. We confirmed a conjecture related to a mass gap, for\ncritical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation. We find a critical\nexponent twice the standard value. Surprisingly, this larger critical exponent\nis also present in the multiple critical behavior for the black hole formation\nfrom a massless scalar field in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. What\nis the meaning of this mass gap? Does it have physical relevance?\n", "  A computation of inclusive cross sections for neutral Higgs boson production\nthrough gluon fusion and bottom-quark annihilation is presented in the MSSM\nwith complex parameters. The predictions for the gluon-fusion process are based\non an explicit calculation of the leading-order cross section for arbitrary\ncomplex parameters which is supplemented by higher-order corrections: massive\ntop- and bottom-quark contributions at NLO QCD, in the heavy top-quark\neffective theory the top-quark contribution up to N$^3$LO QCD including a soft\nexpansion for the $\\mathcal{CP}$-even component of the light Higgs boson. For\nits $\\mathcal{CP}$-odd component and the heavy Higgs bosons the contributions\nare incorporated up to NNLO QCD. Two-loop electroweak effects are also\nincorporated, and SUSY QCD corrections at NLO are interpolated from the MSSM\nwith real parameters. Finite wave function normalisation factors ensuring\ncorrect on-shell properties of the external Higgs bosons are incorporated from\nthe code $\\texttt{FeynHiggs}$. For the typical case of a strong admixture of\nthe two heavy Higgs bosons it is demonstrated that squark effects are strongly\ndependent on the phases of the complex parameters. The remaining theoretical\nuncertainties for cross sections are discussed. The results have been\nimplemented into an extension of the numerical code $\\texttt{SusHi}$ called\n$\\texttt{SusHiMi}$.\n", "  We are concerned with conservation laws and integral relations associated\nwith rational solutions of the Boussinesq equation, a soliton equation solvable\nby inverse scattering which was first introduced by Boussinesq in 1871. The\nrational solutions are logarithmic derivatives of a polynomial, are\nalgebraically decaying and have a similar appearance to rogue-wave solutions of\nthe focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. For these rational solutions\nthe constants of motion associated with the conserved quantities are zero and\nthey have some interesting integral relations which depend on the total degree\nof the associated polynomial.\n", "  Conformal blocks for correlation functions of tensor operators play an\nincreasingly important role for the conformal bootstrap programme. We develop a\nuniversal approach to such spinning blocks through the harmonic analysis of\ncertain bundles over a coset of the conformal group. The resulting Casimir\nequations are given by a matrix version of the Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian\nthat describes the scattering of interacting spinning particles in a\n1-dimensional external potential. The approach is illustrated in several\nexamples including fermionic seed blocks in 3D CFT where they take a very\nsimple form.\n", "  The hydrogen transfer reaction catalysed by soybean lipoxygenase (SLO) has\nbeen the focus of intense study following observations of a high kinetic\nisotope effect (KIE). Today high KIEs are generally thought to indicate\ndeparture from classical rate theory and are seen as a strong signature of\ntunnelling of the transferring particle, hydrogen or one of its isotopes,\nthrough the reaction energy barrier. In this paper we build a qualitative\nquantum rate model with few free parameters that describes the dynamics of the\ntransferring particle when it is exposed to energetic potentials exerted by the\ndonor and the acceptor. The enzyme's impact on the dynamics is modelled by an\nadditional energetic term, an oscillatory contribution known as \"gating\". By\nvarying two key parameters, the gating frequency and the mean donor-acceptor\nseparation, the model is able to reproduce well the KIE data for SLO wild-type\nand a variety of SLO mutants over the experimentally accessible temperature\nrange. While SLO-specific constants have been considered here, it is possible\nto adapt these for other enzymes.\n", "  The masses of the charged fermion and the mixing angles among quarks are\nobserved to be strongly hierarchical, while analogous parameters in the\nneutrino sector appear to be structure-less or anarchical. We develop a class\nof unified models based on SU(5) symmetry that explains these differing\nfeatures probabilistically. With the aid of three input parameters that are\nhierarchical, and with the assumption that all the Yukawa couplings are\nuncorrelated random variables described by Gaussian distributions, we show by\nMonte Carlo simulations that the observed features of the entire fermion\nspectrum can be nicely reproduced. We extend our analysis to an SU(5)-based\nflavor U(1) model making use of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism where the order\none Yukawa couplings are modeled as random variables, which also shows good\nagreement with observations.\n", "  The conditional Lyapunov exponent is defined for investigating chaotic\nsynchronization, in particular complete synchronization and generalized\nsynchronization. We find that the conditional Lyapunov exponent is expressed as\na formula in terms of ergodic theory. Dealing with this formula, we find what\nfactors characterize the conditional Lyapunov exponent in chaotic systems.\n", "  A class of nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations involving a triad of power law\nterms together with a de Broglie-Bohm potential is shown to admit symmetry\nreduction to a hybrid Ermakov-Painlev\\'e II equation which is linked, in turn,\nto the integrable Painlev\\'e XXXIV equation. A nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nencapsulation of a Korteweg-type capillary system is thereby used in the\nisolation of such a Ermakov-Painlev\\'e II reduction valid for a multi-parameter\nclass of free energy functions. Iterated application of a B\\\"acklund\ntransformation then allows the construction of novel classes of exact solutions\nof the nonlinear capillarity system in terms of Yablonskii-Vorob'ev polynomials\nor classical Airy functions. A Painlev\\'e XXXIV equation is derived for the\ndensity in the capillarity system and seen to correspond to the symmetry\nreduction of its Bernoulli integral of motion.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for systems of (possibly inhomogeneous) linear\nordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The algorithm\nproduces a quantum state that is proportional to the solution at a desired\nfinal time. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the logarithm of\nthe inverse error, an exponential improvement over previous quantum algorithms\nfor this problem. Our result builds upon recent advances in quantum linear\nsystems algorithms by encoding the simulation into a sparse, well-conditioned\nlinear system that approximates evolution according to the propagator using a\nTaylor series. Unlike with finite difference methods, our approach does not\nrequire additional hypotheses to ensure numerical stability.\n", "  We present a demonstration of delensing the observed cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) B-mode polarization anisotropy. This process of reducing the\ngravitational-lensing generated B-mode component will become increasingly\nimportant for improving searches for the B modes produced by primordial\ngravitational waves. In this work, we delens B-mode maps constructed from\nmulti-frequency SPTpol observations of a 90 deg$^2$ patch of sky by subtracting\na B-mode template constructed from two inputs: SPTpol E-mode maps and a lensing\npotential map estimated from the $\\textit{Herschel}$ $500\\,\\mu m$ map of the\nCIB. We find that our delensing procedure reduces the measured B-mode power\nspectrum by 28% in the multipole range $300 < \\ell < 2300$; this is shown to be\nconsistent with expectations from theory and simulations and to be robust\nagainst systematics. The null hypothesis of no delensing is rejected at $6.9\n\\sigma$. Furthermore, we build and use a suite of realistic simulations to\nstudy the general properties of the delensing process and find that the\ndelensing efficiency achieved in this work is limited primarily by the noise in\nthe lensing potential map. We demonstrate the importance of including realistic\nexperimental non-idealities in the delensing forecasts used to inform\ninstrument and survey-strategy planning of upcoming lower-noise experiments,\nsuch as CMB-S4.\n", "  We provide a bridge between generative modeling in the Machine Learning\ncommunity and simulated physical processes in High Energy Particle Physics by\napplying a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture to the\nproduction of jet images -- 2D representations of energy depositions from\nparticles interacting with a calorimeter. We propose a simple architecture, the\nLocation-Aware Generative Adversarial Network, that learns to produce realistic\nradiation patterns from simulated high energy particle collisions. The pixel\nintensities of GAN-generated images faithfully span over many orders of\nmagnitude and exhibit the desired low-dimensional physical properties (i.e.,\njet mass, n-subjettiness, etc.). We shed light on limitations, and provide a\nnovel empirical validation of image quality and validity of GAN-produced\nsimulations of the natural world. This work provides a base for further\nexplorations of GANs for use in faster simulation in High Energy Particle\nPhysics.\n", "  The aim of Galactic Archaeology is to recover the evolutionary history of the\nMilky Way from its present day kinematical and chemical state. Because stars\nmove away from their birth sites, the current dynamical information alone is\nnot sufficient for this task. The chemical composition of stellar atmospheres,\non the other hand, is largely preserved over the stellar lifetime and, together\nwith accurate ages, can be used to recover the birthplaces of stars currently\nfound at the same Galactic radius. In addition to the availability of large\nstellar samples with accurate 6D kinematics and chemical abundance\nmeasurements, this requires detailed modeling with both dynamical and chemical\nevolution taken into account. An important first step is to understand the\nvariety of dynamical processes that can take place in the Milky Way, including\nthe perturbative effects of both internal (bar and spiral structure) and\nexternal (infalling satellites) agents. We discuss here (1) how to constrain\nthe Galactic bar, spiral structure, and merging satellites by their effect on\nthe local and global disc phase-space, (2) the effect of multiple patterns on\nthe disc dynamics, and (3) the importance of radial migration and merger\nperturbations for the formation of the Galactic thick disc. Finally, we discuss\nthe construction of Milky Way chemo-dynamical models and relate to\nobservations.\n", "  This is the second in a series of papers where we construct an invariant of a\nfour-dimensional piecewise linear manifold $M$ with a given middle cohomology\nclass $h\\in H^2(M,\\mathbb C)$. This invariant is the square root of the torsion\nof unusual chain complex introduced in Part I (arXiv:1605.06498) of our work,\nmultiplied by a correcting factor. Here we find this factor by studying the\nbehavior of our construction under all four-dimensional Pachner moves, and show\nthat it can be represented in a multiplicative form: a product of same-type\nmultipliers over all 2-faces, multiplied by a product of same-type multipliers\nover all pentachora.\n", "  We present a new procedure to determine Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs),\nbased on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The aim of this paper is to\nshow that we can replace the standard $\\chi^2$ minimization by procedures\ngrounded on Statistical Methods, and on Bayesian inference in particular, thus\noffering additional insight into the rich field of PDFs determination. After a\nbasic introduction to these technics, we introduce the algorithm we have chosen\nto implement -- namely Hybrid (or Hamiltonian) Monte Carlo. This algorithm,\ninitially developed for Lattice QCD, turns out to be very interesting when\napplied to PDFs determination by global analyses; we show that it allows to\ncircumvent the difficulties due to the high dimensionality of the problem, in\nparticular concerning the acceptance. A first feasibility study is performed\nand presented, which indicates that Markov Chain Monte Carlo can successfully\nbe applied to the extraction of PDFs and of their uncertainties.\n", "  The observed massive end of the galaxy stellar mass function is steeper than\nits predicted dark matter halo counterpart in the standard $\\Lambda $CDM\nparadigm. In this paper, we investigate the impact of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) feedback on star formation in massive galaxies. We isolate the impact of\nAGNs by comparing two simulations from the HORIZON suite, which are identical\nexcept that one also includes super massive black holes (SMBH), and related\nfeedback models. This allows us to cross-identify individual galaxies between\nsimulations and quantify the effect of AGN feedback on their properties,\nincluding stellar mass and gas outflows. We find that massive galaxies ($ \\rm\nM_{*} \\geq 10^{11} M_\\odot $) are quenched by AGN feedback to the extent that\ntheir stellar masses decrease by up to 80% at $z=0$. SMBHs affect their host\nhalo through a combination of outflows that reduce their baryonic mass,\nparticularly for galaxies in the mass range $ \\rm 10^9 M_\\odot \\leq M_{*} \\leq\n10^{11} M_\\odot $, and a disruption of central gas inflows, which limits\nin-situ star formation. As a result, net gas inflows onto massive galaxies, $\n\\rm M_{*} \\geq 10^{11} M_\\odot $, drop by up to 70%. We measure a redshift\nevolution in the stellar mass ratio of twin galaxies with and without AGN\nfeedback, with galaxies of a given stellar mass showing stronger signs of\nquenching earlier on. This evolution is driven by a progressive flattening of\nthe $\\rm M_{\\rm SMBH}-M_* $ relation with redshift, particularly for galaxies\nwith $\\rm M_{*} \\leq 10^{10} M_\\odot $. $\\rm M_{\\rm SMBH}/M_*$ ratios decrease\nover time, as falling average gas densities in galaxies curb SMBH growth.\n", "  Intrinsic defects in optomechanical devices are generally viewed to be\ndetrimental for achieving coherent amplification of phonons, and great care has\nthus been exercised in fabricating devices and materials with no (or a minimal\nnumber of) defects. Contrary to this view, here we show that, by surpassing an\nexceptional point (EP), both the mechanical gain and the phonon number can be\nenhanced despite increasing defect losses. This counterintuitive effect, well\ndescribed by an effective non-Hermitian phonon-defect model, provides a\nmechanical analog of the loss-induced purely optical lasing. This opens the way\nto operating random-defect phonon devices at EPs.\n", "  By means of the present geometrical and dynamical observational data, it is\nvery hard to establish, from a statistical perspective, a clear preference\namong the vast majority of the proposed models for the dynamical dark energy\nand/or modified gravity theories alternative with respect to the $\\Lambda$CDM\nscenario. On the other hand, on scales much smaller than present Hubble scale,\nthere are possibly detectable differences in the growth of the matter\nperturbations for different modes of the perturbations, even in the context of\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model. Here, we analyze the evolution of the dark matter\nperturbations in the context of $\\Lambda$CDM and some dynamical dark energy\nmodels involving future cosmological singularities, such as the sudden future\nsingularity and the finite scale factor singularity. We employ the Newtonian\ngauge formulation for the derivation of the perturbation equations for the\ngrowth function, and we abandon both the sub-Hubble approximation and the\nslowly varying potential assumption. We apply the Fisher Matrix approach to\nthree future planned galaxy surveys e.g., DESI, Euclid, and WFirst-2.4. With\nthe mentioned surveys on hand, only with the dynamical probes, we will achieve\nmultiple goals: $1.$ the improvement in the accuracy of the determination of\nthe $f\\sigma_{8}$ will give the possibility to discriminate between the\n$\\Lambda$CDM and the alternative dark energy models even in the\nscale-independent approach; $2.$ it will be possible to test the goodness of\nthe scale-independence finally, and also to quantify the necessity of a scale\ndependent approach to the growth of the perturbations, in particular using\nsurveys which encompass redshift bins with scales $k<0.005\\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$; $3.$\nthe scale-dependence itself might add much more discriminating power in\ngeneral, but further advanced surveys will be needed.\n", "  Inverse problems in statistical physics are motivated by the challenges of\n`big data' in different fields, in particular high-throughput experiments in\nbiology. In inverse problems, the usual procedure of statistical physics needs\nto be reversed: Instead of calculating observables on the basis of model\nparameters, we seek to infer parameters of a model based on observations. In\nthis review, we focus on the inverse Ising problem and closely related\nproblems, namely how to infer the coupling strengths between spins given\nobserved spin correlations, magnetisations, or other data. We review\napplications of the inverse Ising problem, including the reconstruction of\nneural connections, protein structure determination, and the inference of gene\nregulatory networks. For the inverse Ising problem in equilibrium, a number of\ncontrolled and uncontrolled approximate solutions have been developed in the\nstatistical mechanics community. A particularly strong method,\npseudolikelihood, stems from statistics. We also review the inverse Ising\nproblem in the non-equilibrium case, where the model parameters must be\nreconstructed based on non-equilibrium statistics.\n", "  Hyperuniform disordered photonic materials (HDPM) are spatially correlated\ndielectric structures with unconventional optical properties. They can be\ntransparent to long-wavelength radiation while at the same time have isotropic\nband gaps in another frequency range. This phenomenon raises fundamental\nquestions concerning photon transport through disordered media. While optical\ntransparency is robust against recurrent multiple scattering, little is known\nabout other transport regimes like diffusive multiple scattering or Anderson\nlocalization. Here we investigate band gaps, and we report Anderson\nlocalization in two-dimensional stealthy HDPM using numerical simulations of\nthe density of states and optical transport statistics. To establish a unified\nview, we propose a transport phase diagram. Our results show that, depending\nonly on the degree of correlation, a dielectric material can transition from\nlocalization behavior to a bandgap crossing an intermediate regime dominated by\ntunneling between weakly coupled states.\n", "  We analyze the common four types of the finite-time singularities using a\ngeneric framework of the phase portrait geometric approach. This technique\nrequires that the Friedmann system to be written as a one dimensional\nautonomous system. We employ a scale factor that has been used widely in\nliterature to realize the four finite-time singularity types, then we show a\ndetailed discussion for each case showing possible novel models. Moreover, we\nshow how different singularity types can play essential roles in different\ncosmological scenarios. Among several modified gravity theories, we show that\nthe f (T) cosmology is in comfort with the phase portrait analysis, since the\nfield equations include Hubble derivatives only up to first order. Therefore,\nwe reconstruct the f (T) theory which generates these phase portraits. We also\nperform a complementary analysis using the effective equation of state.\nFurthermore, we investigate the role of the torsion fluid in realizing the\ncosmic singularities.\n", "  We generalize the conditions for stable electrodeposition at isotropic\nsolid-solid interfaces using a kinetic model which incorporates the effects of\nstresses and surface tension at the interface. We develop a stability diagram\nthat shows two regimes of stability: previously known pressure-driven mechanism\nand a new density-driven stability mechanism that is governed by the relative\ndensity of metal in the two phases. We show that inorganic solids and solid\npolymers generally do not lead to stable electrodeposition, and provide design\nguidelines for achieving stable electrodeposition.\n", "  We find the Casimir energy, at finite temperature, for acoustic phonons in a\nGraphene sheet suspended over a rectangular trench, and the corresponding\nCasimir forces are interpreted as correction terms to the built-in tensions of\nthe Graphene. We show that these corrections generally break the tensional\nisotropy of the membrane, and can increase or decrease the membrane tension. We\ndemonstrate that for a narrow rectangular trench with side-lengths in the order\nof few nanometers and few micrometers, these temperature corrections are\nexpected to be noticeable ($\\sim 10^{-4} N/m$) at the room temperature. These\ncorrections would be even more considerable by increasing the temperature, and\ncan be applied for adjusting the built-in tension of the Graphene. Consequently\nwe introduce a corrected version for the fundamental resonance frequency of the\nGraphene resonator.\n", "  Nuclear halos emerge as new degrees of freedom near the neutron and proton\ndriplines. They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of\ntheir time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the\ninteraction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the\nhalo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range\nforces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in\nclusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some\nexotic hadrons. In these weakly-bound quantum systems universal scaling laws\nfor s-wave binding emerge that are independent of the details of the\ninteraction. Effective field theory (EFT) exposes these correlations and\npermits the calculation of non-universal corrections to them due to\nshort-distance effects, as well as the extension of these ideas to systems\ninvolving the Coulomb interaction and/or binding in higher angular-momentum\nchannels. Halo nuclei exhibit all these features. Halo EFT, the EFT for halo\nnuclei, has been used to compute the properties of single-neutron, two-neutron,\nand single-proton halos of s-wave and p-wave type. This review summarizes these\nresults for halo binding energies, radii, Coulomb dissociation, and radiative\ncapture, as well as the connection of these properties to scattering\nparameters, thereby elucidating the universal correlations between all these\nobservables. We also discuss how Halo EFT's encoding of the long-distance\nphysics of halo nuclei can be used to check and extend ab initio calculations\nthat include detailed modeling of their short-distance dynamics.\n", "  The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is a key element to describe flavour\ndynamics in the Standard Model. With only four parameters, this matrix is able\nto describe a large range of phenomena in the quark sector, such as CP\nviolation and rare decays. It can thus be constrained by many different\nprocesses, which have to be measured experimentally with a high accuracy and\ncomputed with a good theoretical control. With the advent of the B factories\nand the LHCb experiment taking data, the precision has significantly improved\nrecently. The most relevant experimental constraints and theoretical inputs are\nreviewed and fits to the CKM matrix are presented for the Standard Model and\nfor some topical model-independent studies of New Physics.\n", "  We study a layered three-dimensional heterostructure in which two types of\nKondo insulators are stacked alternatingly. One of them is the topological\nKondo insulator SmB 6 , the other one an isostructural Kondo insulator AB 6 ,\nwhere A is a rare-earth element, e.g., Eu, Yb, or Ce. We find that if the\nlatter orders ferromagnetically, the heterostructure generically becomes a\nmagnetic Weyl Kondo semimetal, while antiferromagnetic order can yield a\nmagnetic Dirac Kondo semimetal. We detail both scenarios with general symmetry\nconsiderations as well as concrete tight-binding calcu-lations and show that\ntype-I as well as type-II magnetic Weyl/Dirac Kondo semimetal phases are\npossible in these heterostructures. Our results demonstrate that Kondo\ninsulator heterostructures are a versatile platform for design of strongly\ncorrelated topological semimetals.\n", "  Free classical particles have well-defined momentum and position, while free\nquantum particles have well-defined momentum but a position fully delocalized\nover the sample volume. We develop a many-body formalism based on wave-packet\noperators that connects these two limits, the thermal energy being distributed\nbetween the state spatial extension and its thermal excitation. The\ncorresponding `mixed quantum-classical' states, which render the Boltzmann\noperator diagonal, are the physically relevant states when the temperature is\nfinite. The formulation of many-body Hamiltonians in terms of these thermally\nexcited wave-packets and the resulting effective scatterings is provided.\n", "  Energetic ions lose their energy in tissue mainly by ionising its molecules.\nThis produces secondary electrons which transport this energy radially away\nfrom the ion path. The ranges of most of these electrons do not exceed a few\nnanometres, therefore large energy densities (radial doses) are produced within\na narrow region around the ion trajectory. Large energy density gradients\ncorrespond to large pressure gradients and this brings about shock waves\npropagating away from the ion path. Previous works have studied these waves by\nmolecular dynamics simulations investigating their damaging effects on DNA\nmolecules. However, these simulations where performed assuming that all energy\nlost by ions is deposited uniformly in thin cylinders around their path. In the\npresent work the radial dose distributions, calculated by solving the diffusion\nequation for the low energy electrons and complemented with a semi-empirical\ninclusion of more energetic $\\delta$-electrons, are used to set up initial\nconditions for the shock wave simulation. The effect of these energy\ndistributions vs. stepwise energy distributions in tracks on the strength of\nshock waves induced by carbon ions both in the Bragg peak region and out of it\nis studied by molecular dynamics simulations.\n", "  We investigate thermoelectric transport through a SU(N) quantum impurity in\nthe Kondo regime. The strong coupling fixed point theory is described by the\nlocal Fermi-liquid paradigm. Using Keldysh technique we analyse the electric\ncurrent through the quantum impurity at both finite bias voltage and finite\ntemperature drop across it. The theory of a steady state at zero-current\nprovides a complete description of the Seebeck effect. We find pronounced\nnon-linear effects in temperature drop at low temperatures. We illustrate the\nsignificance of the non-linearities for enhancement of thermopower by two\nexamples of SU(4) symmetric regimes characterized by a filling factor m: i)\nparticle-hole symmetric at m=2 and ii) particle-hole non-symmetric at m=1. We\nanalyse the effects of potential scattering and coupling asymmetry on the\ntransport coefficients. We discuss connections between the theory and transport\nexperiments with coupled quantum dots and carbon nanotubes.\n", "  Chiral domain walls of Neel type emerge in heterostructures that include\nheavy metal (HM) and ferromagnetic metal (FM) layers owing to the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction at the HM/FM interface. In developing\nstorage class memories based on the current induced motion of chiral domain\nwalls, it remains to be seen how dense such domain walls can be packed\ntogether. Here we show that a universal short range repulsion that scales with\nthe strength of the DM interaction exists among chiral domain walls. The\ndistance between the two walls can be reduced with application of out of plane\nfield, allowing formation of coupled domain walls. Surprisingly, the current\ndriven velocity of such coupled walls is independent of the out of plane field,\nenabling manipulation of significantly compressed coupled domain walls using\ncurrent pulses. Moreover, we find that a single current pulse with optimum\namplitude can create a large number of closely spaced domain walls. These\nfeatures allow current induced generation and synchronous motion of highly\npacked chiral domain walls, a key feature essential for developing domain wall\nbased storage devices.\n", "  In order to induce a family of mixing patterns of leptons which accommodate\nthe experimental data with a simple mathematical construct, we construct a\nnovel object from the hybrid of two elements of a finite group with a parameter\n$\\theta$. This construct is an element of a mathematical structure called\ngroup-algebra. It could reduce to a generator of a cyclic group if\n$\\theta/2\\pi$ is a rational number. We discuss a specific example on the base\nof the group $S_{4}$. This example shows that infinite cyclic groups could give\nthe viable mixing patterns for Dirac neutrinos.\n", "  Here we report on the production and tomography of genuinely entangled\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with up to 10 qubits connecting to a bus\nresonator in a superconducting circuit, where the resonator-mediated\nqubit-qubit interactions are used to controllably entangle multiple qubits and\nto operate on different pairs of qubits in parallel. The resulting 10-qubit\ndensity matrix is unambiguously probed, with a fidelity of $0.668 \\pm 0.025$.\nOur results demonstrate the largest entanglement created so far in solid-state\narchitectures, and pave the way to large-scale quantum computation.\n", "  Linear arrays of trapped and laser cooled atomic ions are a versatile\nplatform for studying emergent phenomena in strongly-interacting many-body\nsystems. Effective spins are encoded in long-lived electronic levels of each\nion and made to interact through laser mediated optical dipole forces. The\nadvantages of experiments with cold trapped ions, including high spatiotemporal\nresolution, decoupling from the external environment, and control over the\nsystem Hamiltonian, are used to measure quantum effects not always accessible\nin natural condensed matter samples. In this review we highlight recent work\nusing trapped ions to explore a variety of non-ergodic phenomena in long-range\ninteracting spin-models which are heralded by memory of out-of-equilibrium\ninitial conditions. We observe long-lived memory in static magnetizations for\nquenched many-body localization and prethermalization, while memory is\npreserved in the periodic oscillations of a driven discrete time crystal state.\n", "  We introduce two generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model for two\nmodes of oscillation. The first model is formed by two Jaynes-Cummings\ninteractions, while the second model is written as a simultaneous\nJaynes-Cummings and Anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) interactions. We study some of\nits properties and obtain the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of these\nmodels by using the tilting transformation and the Perelomov number coherent\nstates of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Moreover, as physical\napplications, we connect these new models with two important and novelty\nproblems: The relativistic non-degenerate parametric amplifier and the\nrelativistic problem of two coupled oscillators.\n", "  Current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) represent one of the most effective\nways to manipulate the magnetization in spintronic devices. The orthogonal\ntorque-magnetization geometry, the strong damping, and the large domain wall\nvelocities inherent to materials with strong spin-orbit coupling make SOTs\nespecially appealing for fast switching applications in nonvolatile memory and\nlogic units. So far, however, the timescale and evolution of the magnetization\nduring the switching process have remained undetected. Here, we report the\ndirect observation of SOT-driven magnetization dynamics in Pt/Co/AlO$_x$ dots\nduring current pulse injection. Time-resolved x-ray images with 25 nm spatial\nand 100 ps temporal resolution reveal that switching is achieved within the\nduration of a sub-ns current pulse by the fast nucleation of an inverted domain\nat the edge of the dot and propagation of a tilted domain wall across the dot.\nThe nucleation point is deterministic and alternates between the four dot\nquadrants depending on the sign of the magnetization, current, and external\nfield. Our measurements reveal how the magnetic symmetry is broken by the\nconcerted action of both damping-like and field-like SOT and show that\nreproducible switching events can be obtained for over $10^{12}$ reversal\ncycles.\n", "  We perform a full three-dimensional study on miscible-immiscible conditions\nfor coupled dipolar and non-dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), confined\nwithin anisotropic traps. Without loosing general miscibility aspects that can\noccur for two-component mixtures, our main focus was on the atomic\nerbium-dysprosium ($^{168}$Er-$^{164}$Dy) and dysprosium-dysprosium\n($^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy) mixtures. Our analysis for pure-dipolar BEC was limited\nto coupled systems confined in pancake-type traps, after considering a study on\nthe stability regime of such systems. In case of non-dipolar systems with\nrepulsive contact intneeractions we are able to extend the miscibility analysis\nto coupled systems with cigar-type symmetries. For a coupled condensate with\nrepulsive inter- and intra-species two-body interactions, confined by an\nexternal harmonic trap, the transition from a miscible to an immiscible phase\nis verified to be much softer than in the case the system is confined by a\nsymmetric hard-wall potential. Our results, presented by density plots, are\npointing out the main role of the trap symmetry and inter-species interaction\nfor the miscibility. A relevant parameter to measure the overlap between the\ntwo densities was defined and found appropriate to quantify the miscibility of\na coupled system.\n", "  The covariant Hamiltonian formulation for general relativity is studied in\nterms of self-dual variables on a manifold with an internal and lightlike\nboundary. At this inner boundary, new canonical variables appear: a spinor and\na spinor-valued two-form that encode the entire intrinsic geometry of the null\nsurface. At a two-dimensional cross-section of the boundary, quasi-local\nexpressions for the generators of two-dimensional diffeomorphisms, time\ntranslations, and dilatations of the null normal are introduced and written in\nterms of the new boundary variables. In addition, a generalisation of the\nfirst-law of black-hole thermodynamics for arbitrary null surfaces is found,\nand the relevance of the framework for non-perturbative quantum gravity is\nstressed and explained.\n", "  A possible hint of dark matter annihilation has been found in Cuoco,\nKorsmeier and Kr\\\"amer (2017) from an analysis of recent cosmic-ray antiproton\ndata from AMS-02 and taking into account cosmic-ray propagation uncertainties\nby fitting at the same time dark matter and propagation parameters. Here, we\nextend this analysis to a wider class of annihilation channels. We find\nconsistent hints of a dark matter signal with an annihilation cross-section\nclose to the thermal value and with masses in range between 40 and 130 GeV\ndepending on the annihilation channel. Furthermore, we investigate in how far\nthe possible signal is compatible with the Galactic center gamma-ray excess and\nrecent observation of dwarf satellite galaxies by performing a joint global fit\nincluding uncertainties in the dark matter density profile. As an example, we\ninterpret our results in the framework of the Higgs portal model.\n", "  A one-dimensional fermionic system, such as a superconducting wire, may host\nMajorana zero-energy edge modes (MZMs) at its edges when it is in the\ntopological phase. MZMs provide a path to realising fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation, and so are the focus of intense experimental and theoretical\nstudies. However, given a Hamiltonian, determining whether MZMs exist is a\ndaunting task as it relies on knowing the spectral properties of the\nHamiltonian in the thermodynamic limit. The Kitaev chain is a paradigmatic\nnon-interacting model that supports MZMs and the Hamiltonian can be fully\ndiagonalised. However, for interacting models, the situation is far more\ncomplex. Here we consider a different classification of models, namely, ones\nwith frustration-free Hamiltonians. Within this class of models, interacting\nand non-interacting systems are treated on an equal footing, and we identify\nexactly which Hamiltonians can realise MZMs.\n", "  Beyond perturbation theory the number of gauge copies drastically increases\ndue to the Gribov-Singer ambiguity. Any way of treating them defines, in\nprinciple, a new, non-perturbative gauge, and the gauge-dependent correlation\nfunctions can vary between them. Herein various such gauges will be constructed\nas completions of the Landau gauge inside the first Gribov region. The\ndependence of the propagators and the running coupling on these gauges will be\nstudied for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in two, three, and four dimensions using\nlattice gauge theory, and for a wide range of lattice parameters. While the\ngluon propagator is rather insensitive to the choice, the ghost propagator and\nthe running coupling show a stronger dependence. It is also found that the\ninfluence of lattice artifacts is larger than in minimal Landau gauge.\n", "  We present a method for accelerating adiabatic protocols for systems\ninvolving a coupling to a continuum, one that cancels both non-adiabatic errors\nas well as errors due to dissipation. We focus on applications to a generic\nquantum state transfer problem, where the goal is to transfer a state between a\nsingle level or mode, and a propagating temporal mode in a waveguide or\ntransmission line. Our approach enables perfect adiabatic transfer protocols in\nthis setup, despite a finite protocol speed and a finite waveguide coupling.\nOur approach even works in highly constrained settings, where there is only a\nsingle time-dependent control field available.\n", "  By investigating information flow between a general parity-time (PT)\n-symmetric non-Hermitian system and an environment, we find that the complete\ninformation retrieval from the environment can be achieved in the PT-unbroken\nphase, whereas no information can be retrieved in the PT-broken phase. The\nPT-transition point thus marks the reversible-irreversible criticality of\ninformation flow, around which many physical quantities such as the recurrence\ntime and the distinguishability between quantum states exhibit power-law\nbehavior. Moreover, by embedding a PT-symmetric system into a larger Hilbert\nspace so that the entire system obeys unitary dynamics, we reveal that behind\nthe information retrieval lies a hidden entangled partner protected by PT\nsymmetry. Possible experimental situations are also discussed.\n", "  The spin momentum non-orthogonality in 3D topological insulators leads to\nmodification of the spin texture and brings in an out-of-plane spin\npolarization component. Apart from spin texture, the anomalous thermoelectric\nproperties of these materials are worth studying. In this paper, we have\npointed out that the off resonant light used to irradiate the surface states,\ninduces a gap, which becomes momentum dependent due to the presence of\nnon-orthogonal terms in the Hamiltonian. Importantly, to maintain the off\nresonant condition of light, the momentum value should satisfy a bound.\nFurthermore, the momentum dependent gap causes a topological transition at\nhigher value of momentum, which is important to analyse the unusual double peak\nstructure of the Nernst and electrical conductivities.\n", "  This work generalizes the treatment of flat spin connections in the\nteleparallel equivalent of general relativity. It is shown that a general flat\nspin connection form a subspace in the affine space of spin connections which\nis dynamically decoupled from the tetrad and the matter fields. A translation\nin the affine subspace introduces a torsion term without changing the tetrad.\nInstead, the change in the torsion is related to the introduction of a global\nacceleration field term that introduces Lorentz inertial effects in the\nreference frame. The dynamics of the gravitationally coupled matter fields\nremains however equivalent regardless of the flat spin connection chosen. The\nimplications of the break of this invariance by a general $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Frequency combs have applications that extend from the ultra-violet into the\nmid-infrared bands. Microcombs, a miniature and often semiconductor-chip-based\ndevice, can potentially access most of these applications, but are currently\nmore limited in spectral reach. Here, we demonstrate mode-locked silica\nmicrocombs with emission near the edge of the visible spectrum. By using both\ngeometrical and mode-hybridization dispersion control, devices are engineered\nfor soliton generation while also maintaining optical $Q$ factors as high as 80\nmillion. Electronics-bandwidth-compatible (20 GHz) soliton mode locking is\nachieved with low pumping powers (parametric oscillation threshold powers as\nlow as 5.4 mW). These are the shortest wavelength soliton microcombs\ndemonstrated to date and could be used in miniature optical clocks. The results\nshould also extend to visible and potentially ultra-violet bands.\n", "  We present a generalization of the maximum entropy method to the analytic\ncontinuation of matrix-valued Green's functions. To treat off-diagonal elements\ncorrectly based on Bayesian probability theory, the entropy term has to be\nextended for spectral functions that are possibly negative in some frequency\nranges. In that way, all matrix elements of the Green's function matrix can be\nanalytically continued; we introduce a computationally cheap element-wise\nmethod for this purpose. However, this method cannot ensure important\nconstraints on the mathematical properties of the resulting spectral functions,\nnamely positive semidefiniteness and Hermiticity. To improve on this, we\npresent a full matrix formalism, where all matrix elements are treated\nsimultaneously. We show the capabilities of these methods using insulating and\nmetallic dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) Green's functions as test cases.\nFinally, we apply the methods to realistic material calculations for LaTiO$_3$,\nwhere off-diagonal matrix elements in the Green's function appear due to the\ndistorted crystal structure.\n", "  Diamond-based magnetic field sensors have attracted great interest in recent\nyears. In particular, wide-field magnetic imaging using nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamond has been previously demonstrated in condensed matter,\nbiological, and paleomagnetic applications. Vector magnetic imaging with NV\nensembles typically requires an applied field (>10 G) to separate the\ncontributions from four crystallographic orientations, hindering studies of\nmagnetic samples that require measurement in low or independently specified\nbias fields. Here we decompose the NV ensemble magnetic resonance spectrum\nwithout such a bias field by modulating the collected light at the microscope's\nFourier plane. In addition to enabling vector magnetic imaging at arbitrarily\nlow fields, our method can be used to extend the dynamic range at a given bias\nfield. As demonstrated here, optically-detected diamond magnetometry stands to\nbenefit from Fourier optical approaches, which have already found widespread\nutility in other branches of photonics.\n", "  We introduce a method for breaking Lorentz reciprocity based upon the\nnon-commutation of frequency conversion and delay. The method requires no\nmagnetic materials or resonant physics, allowing for the design of scalable and\nbroadband non-reciprocal circuits. With this approach, two types of gyrators\n--- universal building blocks for linear, non-reciprocal circuits --- are\nconstructed. Using one of these gyrators, we create a circulator with > 15 dB\nof isolation across the 5 -- 9 GHz band. Our designs may be readily extended to\nany platform with suitable frequency conversion elements, including\nsemiconducting devices for telecommunication or an on-chip superconducting\nimplementation for quantum information processing.\n", "  We report Magnetospheric Multiscale observations of electron pressure\ngradient electric fields near a magnetic reconnection diffusion region using a\nnew technique for extracting 7.5 ms electron moments from the Fast Plasma\nInvestigation. We find that the deviation of the perpendicular electron bulk\nvelocity from $E \\times B$ drift in the interval where the out-of-plane current\ndensity is increasing can be explained by the diamagnetic drift. In the\ninterval where the out-of-plane current is transitioning to in-plane current,\nthe electron momentum equation is not satisfied at 7.5 ms resolution.\n", "  We report magnetotransport and de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect studies on\nMoP$_2$ single crystals, predicted to be type-2 Weyl semimetal with four pairs\nof robust Weyl points located below the Fermi level and long Fermi arcs. The\ntemperature dependence of resistivity shows a peak before saturation, which\ndoes not move with magnetic field. Large nonsaturating magnetoresistance (MR)\nwas observed, and the field dependence of MR exhibits a crossover from\nsemicalssical weak-field $B^2$ dependence to the high-field linear-field\ndependence, indicating the presence of Dirac linear energy dispersion. In\naddition, systematic violation of Kohler's rule was observed, consistent with\nmultiband electronic transport. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) splitting has\nan effect on dHvA measurements whereas the angular-dependent dHvA orbit\nfrequencies agree well with the calculated Fermi surface. The cyclotron\neffective mass $\\sim$ 1.6$m_e$ indicates the bands might be trivial, possibly\nsince the Weyl points are located below the Fermi level. Interestingly,\nquasi-two dimensional(2D) band structure is observed even though the crystal\nstructure of MoP$_2$ is not layered.\n", "  In dense and cold molecular clouds dust grains are surrounded by thick icy\nmantles. It is however not clear if dust growth and coagulation take place\nbefore the switch-on of a protostar. This is an important issue, as the\npresence of large grains may affect the chemical structure of dense cloud\ncores, including the dynamically important ionization fraction, and the future\nevolution of solids in protoplanetary disks. To study this further, we focus on\nL1544, one of the most centrally concentrated pre-stellar cores on the verge of\nstar formation, and with a well-known physical structure. We observed L1544 at\n1.2 and 2 mm using NIKA, a new receiver at the IRAM 30 m telescope, and we used\ndata from the Herschel Space Observatory archive. We find no evidence of grain\ngrowth towards the center of L1544 at the available angular resolution.\nTherefore, we conclude that single dish observations do not allow us to\ninvestigate grain growth toward the pre-stellar core L1544 and high sensitivity\ninterferometer observations are needed. We predict that dust grains can grow to\n200 $\\mu$m in size toward the central ~300 au of L1544. This will imply a dust\nopacity change by a factor of ~2.5 at 1.2 mm, which can be detected using the\nAtacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA) at different\nwavelengths and with an angular resolution of 2\".\n", "  We investigate the stability of electrodeposition at solid-solid interfaces\nfor materials exhibiting an anisotropic mechanical response. The stability of\nelectrodeposition or resistance to the formation of dendrites is studied within\na linear stability analysis. The deformation and stress equations are solved\nusing the Stroh formalism and faithfully recover the boundary conditions at the\ninterface. The stability parameter is used to quantify the stability of\ndifferent solid-solid interfaces incorporating the full anisotropy of the\nelastic tensor of the two materials. Results show a high degree of variability\nin the stability parameter depending on the crystallographic orientation of the\nsolids in contact, and point to opportunities for exploiting this effect in\ndeveloping Li metal anodes.\n", "  There are many functional contexts where it is desirable to maintain a\nmesoscopic system in a nonequilibrium state. However, such control requires an\ninherent energy dissipation. In this article, we unify and extend a number of\nworks on the minimum energetic cost to maintain a mesoscopic system in a\nprescribed nonequilibrium distribution using ancillary control. For a variety\nof control mechanisms, we find that the minimum amount of energy dissipation\nnecessary can be cast as an information-theoretic measure of distinguishability\nbetween the target nonequilibrium state and the underlying equilibrium\ndistribution. This work offers quantitative insight into the intuitive idea\nthat more energy is needed to maintain a system farther from equilibrium.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied homogeneous and anisotropic, locally\nrotationally symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I universe model with magnetized\nstrange quark matter (MSQM) distribution and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in\n$f(R,T)$ gravity. The exact solutions of the field equations are obtained under\nbilinear and special form of time varying deceleration parameter (DP). Firstly\nwe have considered two specific form of bilinear DP with a single parameter of\nthe form: $q=\\frac{\\alpha(1-t)}{1+t}$ and $q=-\\frac{\\alpha t}{1+t}$, which\nleads to a function with constant or linear nature with respect to the choice\nof constant $\\alpha$. Second one is the special form of the DP as\n$q=-1+\\frac{\\beta}{1+a^{\\beta}}$. From obtained results, we could say that in\nthe early universe the magnetic flux has more effects and it gradually reducing\nits effects in later. For $t\\rightarrow \\infty$, we get $p\\rightarrow -B_c$ and\n$\\rho\\rightarrow B_c$. So the strange quark matter along with magnetic epoch\ngives an idea of accelerated expansion of the universe as per the observations\nof the type Ia Supernovae.\n", "  We present new proper motion (PM) measurements of the dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSphs) Draco and Sculptor using multi-epoch images obtained with the\nHubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC. Our PM results have uncertainties far lower\nthan previous measurements, even made with the same instrument. The PM results\nfor Draco and Sculptor are (mu_W,mu_N)_Dra =\n(-0.0562+/-0.0099,-0.1765+/-0.0100) mas/yr and (mu_W,mu_N)_Scl =\n(-0.0296+/-0.0209,-0.1358 +/-0.0214) mas/yr. The implied Galactocentric\nvelocity vectors for Draco and Sculptor have radial and tangential components:\n(V_rad,V_tan)_Dra = (-88.6,161.4) +/- (4.4,5.6) km/s; and (V_rad,V_tan)_Scl =\n(72.6,200.2) +/- (1.3,10.8) km/s. We study the detailed orbital history of both\nDraco and Sculptor via numerical orbit integrations. Orbital periods of Draco\nand Sculptor are found to be 1-2 and 2-5 Gyrs, respectively, accounting for\nuncertainties in the MW mass. We also study the influence of the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco and Sculptor. Overall, the\ninclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based on our\ncalculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending\non the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very\nwell constrained with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being\n0.3-0.4 Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco\nand Sculptor are confined within the Disk of Satellites (DoS), better so than\nimplied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule out the possibility that\nthese two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.\n", "  We study the impact of the finite-size effect on the continuous-variable\nmeasurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) protocol,\nmainly considering the finite-size effect on the parameter estimation\nprocedure. The central-limit theorem and maximum likelihood estimation theorem\nare used to estimate the parameters. We also analyze the relationship between\nthe number of exchanged signals and the optimal modulation variance in the\nprotocol. It is proved that when Charlie's position is close to Bob, the CV-MDI\nQKD protocol has the farthest transmission distance in the finite-size\nscenario. Finally, we discuss the impact of finite-size effects related to the\npractical detection in the CV-MDI QKD protocol. The overall results indicate\nthat the finite-size effect has a great influence on the secret key rate of the\nCV-MDI QKD protocol and should not be ignored.\n", "  Minkowski space is shown to be globally stable as a solution to the massive\nEinstein--Vlasov system. The proof is based on a harmonic gauge in which the\nequations reduce to a system of quasilinear wave equations for the metric,\nsatisfying the weak null condition, coupled to a transport equation for the\nVlasov particle distribution function. Central to the proof is a collection of\nvector fields used to control the particle distribution function, a function of\nboth spacetime and momentum variables. The vector fields are derived using a\ngeneral procedure, are adapted to the geometry of the solution and reduce to\nthe generators of the symmetries of Minkowski space when restricted to acting\non spacetime functions. Moreover, when specialising to the case of vacuum, the\nproof provides a simplification of previous stability works.\n", "  A microstructure-based model is presented to predict the fatigue life of\npolycrystalline metallic alloys which present a bilinear Coffin-Manson\nrelationship. The model is based in the determination of the maximum value of a\nfatigue indicator parameter obtained from the plastic energy dissipated by\ncycle in the microstructure. The fatigue indicator parameter was obtained by\nmeans of the computational homogenization of a representative volume element of\nthe microstructure using a crystal-plasticity finite element model. The\nmicrostructure-based model was applied to predict the low cyclic fatigue\nbehavior of IN718 at 400$^\\circ$C which exhibits a bilinear Coffin-Manson\nrelationship under the assumption that this behavior is triggered by a\ntransition from highly localized plasticity at low cyclic strain amplitudes to\nmore homogeneous deformation at high cyclic strain amplitudes. The model\npredictions were in very good agreement with the experimental results for a\nwide range of cyclic strain amplitudes and two strain ratios ($R_\\epsilon$ = 0\nand -1) and corroborated the initial hypothesis. Moreover, they provided a\nmicromechanical explanation for the influence of the strain ratio on the\nfatigue life at low cyclic strain amplitudes.\n", "  For over a decade, cold atoms in lattice potentials have been an attractive\nplatform to simulate phenomena known from solid state theory, as the\nMott-insulator transition. In contrast, the field of photonics usually deals\nwith non-equilibrium physics. Recent advances towards photonic simulators of\nsolid state equilibrium effects include polariton double-site and lattice\nexperiments, as well as the demonstration of a photon condensate in a\ndye-filled microcavity. Here we demonstrate a technique to create variable\nmicropotentials for light using thermo-optic imprinting within an\nultrahigh-reflectivity mirror microcavity filled with a dye-polymer solution\nthat is compatible with photon gas thermalization. By repeated\nabsorption-emission cycles photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye\nsolution, and in a single microsite we observe a photon Bose-Einstein\nmicrocondensate. Effective interactions between the otherwise nearly\nnon-interacting photons are observed due to thermo-optic effects, and in a\ndouble-well system tunnel coupling between sites is demonstrated, as well as\nthe hybridization of eigenstates. Prospects of the new experimental platform\ninclude photonic structures in which photons thermalize into entangled manybody\nstates.\n", "  In this paper, compressive loading effects on the plasticity of Al-Cu alloy\nvarying the crystal orientation of Al and alloying element (Cu) percentage are\ninvestigated using molecular dynamics approach. The alloying percentage of Cu\nare varied up to 10% in <001>, <110> and <111> crystal loading direction of Al.\nOur results indicate that the alloy nanopillar has highest first yielding\nstrength and strain along <110> and <001> direction, respectively. Further, the\ndislocation density and dislocation interaction are studied to explain the\ncompressive stress strain behavior of the alloy nanopillar.\n", "  We present a theoretical description of resonant radiofrequency (RF)\ndeflecting cavities in TM$_{110}$ mode as dynamic optical elements for\nultrafast electron microscopy. We first derive the optical transfer matrix of\nan ideal pillbox cavity and use a Courant-Snyder formalism to calculate the 6D\nphase space propagation of a Gaussian electron distribution through the cavity.\nWe derive closed, analytic expressions for the increase in transverse emittance\nand energy spread of the electron distribution. We demonstrate that for the\nspecial case of a beam focused in the center of the cavity, the low emittance\nand low energy spread of a high quality beam can be maintained, which allows\nhigh-repetition rate, ultrafast electron microscopy with 100 fs temporal\nresolution combined with the atomic resolution of a high-end TEM. This is\nconfirmed by charged particle tracking simulations using a realistic cavity\ngeometry, including fringe fields at the cavity entrance and exit apertures.\n", "  Many simple RNA viruses enclose their genetic material by a protein shell\ncalled the capsid. While the capsid structures are well characterized for most\nviruses, the structure of RNA inside the shells and the factors contributing to\nit remain poorly understood. We study the impact of base pairing on the\nconformations of RNA and find that it undergoes a swollen coil to globule\ncontinuous transition as a function of the strength of the pairing interaction.\nWe also observe a first order transition and kink profile as a function of RNA\nlength. All these transitions could explain the different RNA profiles observed\ninside viral shells.\n", "  The best known manifestation of the Fermi-Dirac statistics is the Pauli\nexclusion principle: no two identical fermions can occupy the same one-particle\nstate. This principle enforces high order correlations in systems of many\nidentical fermions and is responsible for a particular geometric arrangement of\ntrapped particles even when all mutual interactions are absent [1]. These\ngeometric structures, called Pauli crystals, are predicted for a system of $N$\nidentical atoms trapped in a harmonic potential. They emerge as the most\nfrequent configurations in a collection of single-shot pictures of the system.\nHere we study how fragile Pauli crystals are when realistic experimental\nlimitations are taken into account. The influence of the number of single-shots\npictures available to analysis, thermal fluctuations and finite efficiency of\ndetection are considered. The role of these sources of noise on the possibility\nof experimental observation of Pauli crystals is shown and conditions necessary\nfor the detection of the geometrical arrangements of particles are identified.\n", "  Citizen science refers to scientific research conducted or participated by\nnon-professional scientists (such as hobbyists or members from the general\npublic). Citizen astronomy is a classic example of citizen science. Citizen\nastronomers has benefited from technological advancements in the recent decades\nas they fill the scientific gaps left by professional astronomers, in the areas\nsuch as time domain observations, visual classification and data mining.\nChinese citizen astronomers have made a visible contribution in the discoveries\nof new objects; however, comparing to their counterparts in the western world,\nthey appear to be less interested in researches that do not involve making new\ndiscovery, such as visual classification, long-term monitoring of objects, and\ndata mining. From a questionnaire survey that aimed to investigate the\nmotivation of Chinese citizen astronomers, we find that this population is\npredominantly male ($92\\%$) who mostly reside in economically developed\nprovinces. A large fraction ($69\\%$) of the respondents are students and young\nprofessionals younger than the age of 25, which differs significantly from the\noccupation and age distribution of typical Chinese Internet users as well as\nthe user distribution of large international citizen science projects such as\nthe Galaxy Zoo. This suggests that youth generation in China is more willing to\nparticipate citizen astronomy research than average generation. Additionally,\nwe find that interests in astronomy, desire to learn new knowledges, have a fun\nexperience and meet new friends in the community are all important driving\nfactors for Chinese citizen astronomers to participate research. This also\ndiffers from their counterparts in western countries.

Our formalism bridges between a single two-level emitter,\nrepresented by spin components that relax at different rates, depending on the\ndegree of squeezing, to an ensemble of emitters represented by a large\ncollective spin, whose components relax independently of the squeezing. For a\nsingle spin, the steady state fluctuations in the transverse components are\nindependent of the squeezing, while the steady state of a large spin ensemble\nreflects the statistics of the squeezed reservoir. This follows from an\nanalysis of the Langevin noise contributions to the equations of motion and\ntheir consequences for the first and second moments of the spin operators. We\nargue that the difference between a single and many spins is related to whether\nvacuum fluctuations or radiation reaction dominate the coupling of the spin\nsystem to the radiation environment.\n", "  We present the Complete Local-Volume Groups Sample (CLoGS), a statistically\ncomplete optically-selected sample of 53 groups within 80 Mpc. Our goal is to\ncombine X-ray, radio and optical data to investigate the relationship between\nmember galaxies, their active nuclei, and the hot intra-group medium (IGM). We\ndescribe sample selection, define a 26-group high-richness subsample of groups\ncontaining at least 4 optically bright (log L_B>=10.2 LBsol) galaxies, and\nreport the results of XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of these systems. We\nfind that 14 of the 26 groups are X-ray bright, possessing a group-scale IGM\nextending at least 65kpc and with luminosity >10^41 erg/s, while a further 3\ngroups host smaller galaxy-scale gas halos. The X-ray bright groups have masses\nin the range M_500=0.5-5x10^13 Msol, based on system temperatures of 0.4-1.4\nkeV, and X-ray luminosities in the range 2-200x10^41 erg/s. We find that\n~53-65% of the X-ray bright groups have cool cores, a somewhat lower fraction\nthan found by previous archival surveys. Approximately 30% of the X-ray bright\ngroups show evidence of recent dynamical interactions (mergers or sloshing),\nand ~35% of their dominant early-type galaxies host AGN with radio jets. We\nfind no groups with unusually high central entropies, as predicted by some\nsimulations, and confirm that CLoGS is in principle capable of detecting such\nsystems. We identify three previously unrecognized groups, and find that they\nare either faint (L_X,R500<10^42 erg/s) with no concentrated cool core, or\nhighly disturbed. This leads us to suggest that ~20% of X-ray bright groups in\nthe local universe may still be unidentified.\n", "  There are various formulations of energy--momentum tensors for an\nelectromagnetic field in a linear dielectric. The total energy--momentum\ntensor, comprised of electromagnetic and material components, must be unique.\nWe discuss the construction of the total energy--momentum tensor and the\nassociated conservation laws.\n", "  We consider the XXZ spin chain with a magnetic field gradient and study the\nprofiles of the magnetization as well as the entanglement entropy. For a slowly\nvarying field it is shown that, by means of a local density approximation, the\nground-state magnetization profile can be obtained with standard Bethe ansatz\ntechniques. Furthermore, it is argued that the low-energy description of the\ntheory is given by a Luttinger liquid with slowly varying parameters. This\nallows us to obtain a very good approximation of the entanglement profile using\na recently introduced technique of conformal field theory in curved spacetime.\nFinally, the front dynamics is also studied after the gradient field has been\nswitched off, following arguments of generalized hydrodynamics for integrable\nsystems. While for the XX chain the hydrodynamic solution can be found\nanalytically, the XXZ case appears to be more complicated and the magnetization\nprofiles are recovered only around the edge of the front via an approximate\nnumerical solution.\n", "  A search for baryon-number-violating $\\Xi_b^0$ oscillations is performed with\na sample of $pp$ collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The baryon number at the moment of\nproduction is identified by requiring that the $\\Xi_b^0$ come from the decay of\na resonance $\\Xi_b^{*-} \\to \\Xi_b^0 \\pi^-$ or $\\Xi_b^{\\prime-} \\to \\Xi_b^0\n\\pi^-$, and the baryon number at the moment of decay is identified from the\nfinal state using the decays $\\Xi_b^0 \\to \\Xi_c^+ \\pi^-, ~ \\Xi_c^+ \\to p K^-\n\\pi^+$. No evidence of baryon number violation is found, and an upper limit at\nthe 95% confidence level is set on the oscillation rate of $\\omega < 0.08$\nps$^{-1}$, where $\\omega$ is the associated angular frequency.\n", "  We consider the problem of quantum state certification, where one is given\n$n$ copies of an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum mixed state $\\rho$, and one\nwants to test whether $\\rho$ is equal to some known mixed state $\\sigma$ or\nelse is $\\epsilon$-far from $\\sigma$. The goal is to use notably fewer copies\nthan the $\\Omega(d^2)$ needed for full tomography on $\\rho$ (i.e., density\nestimation). We give two robust state certification algorithms: one with\nrespect to fidelity using $n = O(d/\\epsilon)$ copies, and one with respect to\ntrace distance using $n = O(d/\\epsilon^2)$ copies. The latter algorithm also\napplies when $\\sigma$ is unknown as well. These copy complexities are optimal\nup to constant factors.\n", "  Machine learning (ML) of quantum mechanical properties shows promise for\naccelerating chemical discovery. For transition metal chemistry where accurate\ncalculations are computationally costly and available training data sets are\nsmall, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient in ML model\npredictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions\n(RACs) that encode relationships between the heuristic atomic properties (e.g.,\nsize, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the\nstarting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs\nto make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set,\nwe first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other\npresently-available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean\nunsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as\nlow as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs\non set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15-20x\nhigher errors from feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural\ninformation. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate\nfiltering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random\nforest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4-5x\nsmaller than RAC-155 produce sub- to 1-kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good\ntransferability to metal-ligand bond length prediction (0.004-5 {\\AA} MUE) and\nredox potential on a smaller data set (0.2-0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature\nselection results across property sets reveals the relative importance of\nlocal, electronic descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, atomic number) in\nspin-splitting and distal, steric effects in redox potential and bond lengths.\n", "  Recent research has suggested that the overall dependence of convection near\ncoasts on large-scale atmospheric conditions is weaker than over the open ocean\nor inland areas. This is due to the fact that in coastal regions convection is\noften supported by meso-scale land-sea interactions and the topography of\ncoastal areas. As these effects are not resolved and not included in standard\ncumulus parametrization schemes, coastal convection is among the most poorly\nsimulated phenomena in global models. To outline a possible parametrization\nframework for coastal convection we develop an idealized modeling approach and\ntest its ability to capture the main characteristics of coastal convection. The\nnew approach first develops a decision algorithm, or trigger function, for the\nexistence of coastal convection. The function is then applied in a stochastic\ncloud model to increase the occurrence probability of deep convection when\nland-sea interactions are diagnosed to be important. The results suggest that\nthe combination of the trigger function with a stochastic model is able to\ncapture the occurrence of deep convection in atmospheric conditions often found\nfor coastal convection. When coastal effects are deemed to be present the\nspatial and temporal organization of clouds that has been documented form\nobservations is well captured by the model. The presented modeling approach has\ntherefore potential to improve the representation of clouds and convection in\nglobal numerical weather forecasting and climate models.\n", "  We demonstrate cryogenic, electrically-injected, waveguide-coupled Si\nlight-emitting diodes (LEDs) operating at 1.22 $\\mu$m. The active region of the\nLED consists of W centers implanted in the intrinsic region of a $p$-$i$-$n$\ndiode. The LEDs are integrated on waveguides with superconducting nanowire\nsingle-photon detectors (SNSPDs). We demonstrate the scalability of this\nplatform with an LED coupled to eleven SNSPDs in a single integrated photonic\ndevice. Such on-chip optical links may be useful for quantum information or\nneuromorphic computing applications.\n", "  Lattice gauge theories are a powerful language to theoretically describe a\nvariety of strongly correlated systems, including frustrated magnets,\nhigh-$T_c$ superconductors, and topological phases. However, in many cases\ngauge fields couple to gapless matter degrees of freedom and such theories\nbecome notoriously difficult to analyze quantitatively. In this paper we study\nseveral examples of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories with gapless fermions\nat finite density, in one and two spatial dimensions, that are either exactly\nsoluble or whose solution reduces to that of a known problem. We consider\ncomplex fermions (spinless and spinful) as well as Majorana fermions, and study\nboth theories where Gauss' law is strictly imposed and those where all\nbackground charge sectors are kept in the physical Hilbert space. We use a\ncombination of duality mappings and the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ slave-spin\nrepresentation to map our gauge theories to models of gauge-invariant fermions\nthat are either free, or with on-site interactions of the Hubbard or\nFalicov-Kimball type that are amenable to further analysis. In 1D, the phase\ndiagrams of these theories include free-fermion metals, insulators, and\nsuperconductors; Luttinger liquids; and correlated insulators. In 2D, we find a\nvariety of gapped and gapless phases, the latter including uniform and\nspatially modulated flux phases featuring emergent Dirac fermions, some\nviolating Luttinger's theorem.\n", "  In this paper I shall construct, in a four-dimensional space, all\nvector-tensor field theories that are conformally invariant, consistent with\nconservation of charge, and flat space compatible. By the last assumption I\nmean that the Lagrangian of the theory in question, is well defined and\ndifferentiable, when evaluated for either a flat metric tensor (and) or\nvanishing vector field. Under these assumptions there exists only two classes\nof Lagrangians. One is represented by the Lagrangian which yields the Bach\ntensor density multiplied by a constant, while the other is represented by a\nconstant multiple of the usual Lagrangian that yields Maxwell's equations. Thus\nunder the aforementioned assumptions, the field equation obtained by varying\nthe vector field, must be Maxwell's.\n", "  We present observations of the Herbig Ae star HD169142 with VLT/SPHERE\ninstruments InfraRed Dual-band Imager and Spectrograph (IRDIS) ($K1K2$ and\n$H2H3$ bands) and the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) ($Y$, $J$ and $H$\nbands). We detect several bright blobs at $\\sim$180 mas separation from the\nstar, and a faint arc-like structure in the IFS data. Our reference\ndifferential imaging (RDI) data analysis also finds a bright ring at the same\nseparation. We show, using a simulation based on polarized light data, that\nthese blobs are actually part of the ring at 180 mas. These results demonstrate\nthat the earlier detections of blobs in the $H$ and $K_S$ bands at these\nseparations in Biller et al. as potential planet/substellar companions are\nactually tracing a bright ring with a Keplerian motion. Moreover, we detect in\nthe images an additional bright structure at $\\sim$93 mas separation and\nposition angle of 355$^{\\circ}$, at a location very close to previous\ndetections. It appears point-like in the $YJ$ and $K$ bands but is more\nextended in the $H$ band. We also marginally detect an inner ring in the RDI\ndata at $\\sim$100 mas. Follow-up observations are necessary to confirm the\ndetection and the nature of this source and structure.\n", "  The topology of isofrequency surfaces of a magnetic-semiconductor\nsuperlattice influenced by an external static magnetic field is studied. In\nparticular, in the given structure, topology transitions from standard closed\nforms of spheres and ellipsoids to open ones of Type I and Type II hyperboloids\nas well as bi-hyperboloids were revealed and analyzed. In the latter case, it\nis found out that a complex of an ellipsoid and bi-hyperboloid in isofrequency\nsurfaces appears as a simultaneous effect of both the ratio between magnetic\nand semiconductor filling factors and magnetic field influence. It is proposed\nto consider the obtained bi-hyperbolic isofrequency surface as a new topology\nclass of the wave dispersion.\n", "  We know that in empty space there is no preferred state of rest. This is true\nboth in special relativity but also in Newtonian mechanics with its associated\nGalilean relativity. It comes as something of a surprise, therefore, to\ndiscover the existence a friction force associated with spontaneous emission.\nhe resolution of this paradox relies on a central idea from special relativity\neven though our derivation of it is non-relativistic. We examine the\npossibility that the physics underlying this effect might be explored in an ion\ntrap, via the observation of a superposition of different mass states.\n", "  Microorganisms are able to overcome the thermal randomness of their\nsurroundings by harvesting energy to navigate in viscous fluid environments. In\na similar manner, synthetic colloidal microswimmers are capable of mimicking\ncomplex biolocomotion by means of simple self-propulsion mechanisms. Although\nexperimentally the speed of active particles can be controlled by e.g.\nself-generated chemical and thermal gradients, an in-situ change of swimming\ndirection remains a challenge. In this work, we study self-propulsion of\nhalf-coated spherical colloids in critical binary mixtures and show that the\ncoupling of local body forces, induced by laser illumination, and the wetting\nproperties of the colloid, can be used to finely tune both the colloid's\nswimming speed and its directionality. We experimentally and numerically\ndemonstrate that the direction of motion can be reversibly switched by means of\nthe size and shape of the droplet(s) nucleated around the colloid, depending on\nthe particle radius and the fluid's ambient temperature. Moreover, the\naforementioned features enable the possibility to realize both negative and\npositive phototaxis in light intensity gradients. Our results can be extended\nto other types of half-coated microswimmers, provided that both of their\nhemispheres are selectively made active but with distinct physical properties.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) are an intriguing subclass of active\ngalactic nuclei. Their observed properties indicate low central black hole mass\nand high accretion rate. The extremely radio-loud NLS1 sources often show\nrelativistic beaming and are usually regarded as younger counterparts of\nblazars. Recently, the object SDSS J110006.07+442144.3 was reported as a\ncandidate NLS1 source. The characteristics of its dramatic optical flare\nindicated its jet-related origin. The spectral energy distribution of the\nobject was similar to that of the gamma-ray detected radio-loud NLS1, PMN\nJ0948+0022. Our high-resolution European Very Long Baseline Interferometry\nNetwork observations at 1.7 and 5 GHz revealed a compact core feature with a\nbrightness temperature of >~ 10^(10) K. Using the lowest brightness temperature\nvalue and assuming a moderate Lorentz factor of ~9 the jet viewing angle is <~\n26 deg. Archival Very Large Array data show a large-scale radio structure with\na projected linear size of ~150 kpc reminiscent of double-sided morphology.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs together with the excellent performance of the LHC\nallow to make precision tests of Brout-Englert-Higgs Physics, and especially\nits underlying field-theory. In this field theory strict gauge-invariance\nrequires observable states to have a more involved structure than assumed in\nstandard perturbation theory. This can lead to, likely rather very small,\ndeviations in precision tests of the standard model. Here, the mechanism behind\nthese deviations will be elucidated, and, as an example, its possible\nimplications for the R ratio at future linear colliders will be estimated.\n", "  The NGC 5903 galaxy group is a nearby (~30 Mpc) system of ~30 members,\ndominated by the giant ellipticals NGC 5903 and NGC 5898. The group contains\ntwo unusual structures, a ~110 kpc long HI filament crossing NGC 5903, and a\n~75 kpc wide diffuse, steep-spectrum radio source of unknown origin which\noverlaps NGC 5903 and appears to be partly enclosed by the HI filament. Using a\ncombination of Chandra, XMM-Newton, GMRT and VLA observations, we detect a\npreviously unknown ~0.65 keV intra-group medium filling the volume within 145\nkpc of NGC 5903, and find a loop of enhanced X-ray emission extending ~35 kpc\nsouthwest from the galaxy, enclosing the brightest part of the radio source.\nThe northern and eastern parts of this X-ray structure are also strongly\ncorrelated with the southern parts of the HI filament. We determine the\nspectral index of the bright radio emission to be\n$\\alpha_{150}^{612}$=1.03$\\pm$0.08, indicating a radiative age >360 Myr. We\ndiscuss the origin of the correlated radio, X-ray and HI structures, either\nthrough an interaction-triggered AGN outburst with enthalpy 1.8x10$^{57}$ erg,\nor via a high-velocity collision between a galaxy and the HI filament. While\nneither scenario provides a complete explanation, we find that an AGN outburst\nis the most likely source of the principal X-ray and radio structures. However,\nit is clear that galaxy interactions continue to play an important role in the\ndevelopment of this relatively highly evolved galaxy group. We also resolve the\nquestion of whether the group member galaxy ESO 514-3 hosts a double-lobed\nradio source, confirming that the source is a superposed background AGN.\n", "  A reliable and consistently reproducible technique to fabricate\n$^{222}$Rn-loaded radioactive sources ($\\sim$0.5-1 kBq just after fabrication)\nbased on liquid scintillator (LS), with negligible amounts of LS quencher\ncontaminants, was implemented. This work demonstrates the process that will be\nused during the Borexino detector's upcoming calibration campaign, with one or\nseveral $\\sim$100 Bq such sources will be deployed at different positions in\nits fiducial volume, currently showing unprecedented levels of radiopurity.\nThese sources need to fulfill stringent requirements of $^{222}$Rn activity,\ntransparency to the radiations of interest and complete removability from the\ndetector to ensure their impact on Borexino's radiopurity is negligible.\nMoreover, the need for a clean, undistorted spectral signal for the\ncalibrations imposes a tight requirement to minimize quenching agents\n(\"quenchers\") to null or extremely low levels.\n", "  We establish a 3-parameter family of integral identities to be used on a\nclass of theories possessing solitons with spherical symmetry in $d$ spatial\ndimensions. The construction provides five boundary charges that are related to\ncertain integrals of the profile functions of the solitons in question. The\nframework is quite generic and we give examples of both topological defects\n(like vortices and monopoles) and topological textures (like Skyrmions) in 2\nand 3 dimensions. The class of theories considered here is based on a kinetic\nterm and three functionals often encountered in reduced Lagrangians for\nsolitons. One particularly interesting case provides a generalization of the\nwell-known Pohozaev identity. Our construction, however, is fundamentally\ndifferent from scaling arguments behind Derrick's theorem and virial relations.\nFor BPS vortices, we find interestingly an infinity of integrals simply related\nto the topological winding number.\n", "  Proper design and manufacturing thermal bridges based on molecular junctions\nat the contact between graphene platelets or other thermally conductive\nnanoparticles would provide a fascinating way to produce efficient heat\ntransport networks for the exploitation in heat management applications. In\nthis work, using Non Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics, we calculated thermal\nconductance of alkyl chains used as molecular junctions between two graphene\nnanoribbons, both as covalently bound and Van der Waals interdigitated chains.\nEffect of chain length, grafting density, temperature and chain interdigitation\nwere systematically studied. A clear reduction of conductivity was found with\nincreasing chain length and decreasing grafting density, while lower\nconductivity was observed for Van der Waals interdigitated chains compared to\ncovalently bound ones. The importance of molecular junctions in enhancing\nthermal conductance at graphene nanoribbons contacts was further evidenced by\ncalculating the conductance equivalence between a single chain and an\noverlapping of un-functionalized graphene sheets. As an example, one single\npentyl covalently bound chain was found to have a conductance equivalent to the\noverlapping of an area corresponding to about 152 carbon atoms. These results\ncontribute to the understanding of thermal phenomena occurring within networks\nof thermally conductive nanoparticles, including graphene nanopapers and\ngraphene-based polymer nanocomposites, which are or high interest for the heat\nmanagement application in electronics and generally in low-temperature heat\nexchange and recovery.\n", "  M87 hosts a 3-6 billion solar mass black hole with a remarkable relativistic\njet that has been regularly monitored in radio to TeV bands. However, hard\nX-ray emission \\gtrsim 10keV, which would be expected to primarily come from\nthe jet or the accretion flow, had never been detected from its unresolved\nX-ray core. We report NuSTAR detection up to 40 keV from the the central\nregions of M87. Together with simultaneous Chandra observations, we have\nconstrained the dominant hard X-ray emission to be from its unresolved X-ray\ncore, presumably in its quiescent state. The core spectrum is well fitted by a\npower law with photon index Gamma=2.11 (+0.15 -0.11). The measured flux density\nat 40 keV is consistent with a jet origin, although emission from the\nadvection-dominated accretion flow cannot be completely ruled out. The detected\nhard X-ray emission is significantly lower than that predicted by synchrotron\nself-Compton models introduced to explain emission above a GeV.\n", "  We reconstruct the chain of events, intuitions and ideas that led to the\nformulation of the Gorini, Kossakowski, Lindblad and Sudarshan equation.\n", "  One dimensional Cherenkov processes in ferromagnetic isolators are studied\nwith perturbation theory under the constraint condition of conservation of\nenergy and momentum. It is shown that the magnon-phonon interaction channels\nare limited and wave number dependent, which result in respectively $1/k^{2}$\nand $1/k^{4}$ dependence of the lifetime and the relaxation time of long\nwavelength magnons. The reciprocal of relaxation time between magnons and\nphonons, $1/\\tau_{mp}$, is found to be a linearly increasing function of the\ntemperature as $T>$ 70 K. Based on the Sanders-Walton model, we further show\nthat when a thermal (phonon) gradient is applied along the system, the\ntemperature difference between the phonon bath and the magnons with wave-vector\n$k$ becomes more pronounced as $k$ decreasing.\n", "  In this paper we study the Liouville type properties for solutions to the\nsteady incompressible Navier-Stoks equations in $\\mathbf{R}^{3}$. It is shown\nthat any solution to the steady Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbf{R}^{3}$\nwith finite Dirichlet integral and vanishing velocity field at far fields must\nbe trivial. This solves an open problem. The key ingredients of the proof\ninclude a Hodge decomposition of the energy-flux and the observation that the\nsquare of the deformation matrix lies in the local Hardy space. As a\nby-product, we also obtain a Liouville type theorem for the steady\ndensity-dependent Navier-Stokes equations.\n", "  The carbon vacancy in $4H$-SiC is a powerful minority carrier recombination\ncenter and a major cause of degradation of SiC-based devices. Despite the\nextensiveness of the literature regarding the characterization and modeling of\nthe defect, many fundamental questions persist. Among them we have the shaky\nconnection of the EPR data to the electrical measurements, the physical origin\nof the pseudo-Jahn-Teller (pJT) effect, the reasoning for the observed\nsub-lattice dependence of the paramagnetic states, and the severe\ntemperature-dependence of some hyperfine signals which cannot be accounted for\nby a thermally-activated dynamic averaging between equivalent JT-distorted\nstructures. In this work we address these problems by means of semi-local and\nhybrid density functional calculations. We start by inventorying a total of\nfour vacancy structures. Diamagnetic states have well defined low-energy\nstructures, whereas paramagnetic states display metastability. This rich\nstructural variety is traced back to the filling of electronic states which are\nshaped by a crystal-field-dependent pJT effect. From calculated minimum energy\npaths for defect rotation and transformation mechanisms, combined with the\ncalculated formation energies and electrical levels, we arrived at a\nconfiguration-coordinate diagram of the defect. The diagram provides us with a\ndetailed first-principles picture of the defect when subject to optical and\nthermal excitations. The calculated acceptor and donor transitions agree well\nwith Z$_{1/2}$ and EH$_{6/7}$ trap energies, respectively. From comparison of\ncalculated and measured $U$-values, and correlating the site-dependent\nformation energies with the relative intensity of the DLTS peaks in as-grown\nmaterial, we assign Z$_{1}$ (EH$_{6}$) and Z$_{2}$ (EH$_{7}$) signals to\nacceptor (donor) transitions of carbon vacancies located on the $h$ and $k$\nsub-lattice sites, respectively.\n", "  Bubble formation and detachment at a submerged orifice exists widely in both\ndaily life and academic research, and the influence of solid surface on bubble\nformation and detachment has also been extensively investigated. For example,\nit has been observed that the bubble on a hydrophobic surface is larger than\nthe one on a hydrophilic surface. However, this phenomenon is not sufficiently\nexplained in existing literature. To explain it, we redefine the capillary\nforce at the orifice edge and the adhesive force between bubble and solid.\nSubsequently, we are able to establish an approach that quantitatively explains\nthe relation between bubble volume and surface wettability. In addition, we\nalso suggest an alternative mechanism of bubble pinch-off. In our opinion, the\nformation of bubble neck during pinch-off may be due to three-phase equilibrium\nat the orifice edge, and the breakup of bubble neck may result from the\nstretching action of the upward buoyancy force and the downward capillary\nforce.\n", "  Direct experimental investigations of the low-energy electronic structure of\nthe Na$_2$IrO$_3$ iridate insulator are sparse and draw two conflicting\npictures. One relies on flat bands and a clear gap, the other involves\ndispersive states approaching the Fermi level, pointing to surface metallicity.\nHere, by a combination of angle-resolved photoemission, photoemission electron\nmicroscopy, and x-ray absorption, we show that the correct picture is more\ncomplex and involves an anomalous band, arising from charge transfer from Na\natoms to Ir-derived states. Bulk quasiparticles do exist, but in one of the two\npossible surface terminations the charge transfer is smaller and they remain\nelusive.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to cover an extremely broad range of\nradio luminosities and the spread of their radio-loudness is very large at any\nvalue of the Eddington ratio. This implies very diverse jet production\nefficiencies which can result from the spread of the black hole spins and\nmagnetic fluxes. Magnetic fluxes can be developed stochastically in the\ninnermost zones of accretion discs, or can be advected to the central regions\nprior to the AGN phase. In the latter case there could be systematic\ndifferences between the properties of galaxies hosting radio-loud (RL) and\nradio-quiet (RQ) AGNs. In the former case the differences should be negligible\nfor objects having the same Eddington ratio. To study the problem we decided to\nconduct a comparison study of host galaxy properties of RL and RQ AGNs. In this\nstudy we selected type II AGNs from SDSS spectroscopic catalogues. Our RL AGN\nsample consists of the AGNs appearing in the Best & Heckman (2012) catalogue of\nradio galaxies. To compare RL and RQ galaxies that have the same AGN parameters\nwe matched the galaxies in black hole mass, Eddington ratio and redshift. We\ncompared several properties of the host galaxies in these two groups of objects\nlike galaxy mass, colour, concentration index, line widths, morphological type\nand interaction signatures. We found that in the studied group RL AGNs are\npreferentially hosted by elliptical galaxies while RQ ones are hosted by\ngalaxies of later type. We also found that the fraction of interacting galaxies\nis the same in both groups of AGNs. These results suggest that the magnetic\nflux in RL AGNs is advected to the nucleus prior to the AGN phase.\n", "  The ongoing progress in quantum theory emphasizes the crucial role of the\nvery basic principles of quantum theory. However, this is not properly followed\nin teaching quantum mechanics on the graduate and undergraduate levels of\nphysics studies. The existing textbooks typically avoid the axiomatic\npresentation of the theory. We emphasize usefulness of the systematic,\naxiomatic approach to the basics of quantum theory as well as its importance in\nthe light of the modern scientific-research context.\n", "  Vibration reduction is of great importance in various engineering\napplications, and a material that exhibits good vibration damping along with\nhigh strength and modulus has become more and more vital. Owing to the superior\nmechanical property of carbon nanotube (CNT), new types of vibration damping\nmaterial can be developed. This paper presents recent advancements, including\nour progresses, in the development of high-damping macroscopic CNT assembly\nmaterials, such as forests, gels, films, and fibers. In these assemblies,\nstructural deformation of CNTs, zipping and unzipping at CNT connection nodes,\nstrengthening and welding of the nodes, and sliding between CNTs or CNT bundles\nare playing important roles in determining the viscoelasticity, and elasticity\nas well. Towards the damping enhancement, strategies for micro-structure and\ninterface design are also discussed.\n", "  The entropy of a quantum system is a measure of its randomness, and has\napplications in measuring quantum entanglement. We study the problem of\nmeasuring the von Neumann entropy, $S(\\rho)$, and R\\'enyi entropy,\n$S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ of an unknown mixed quantum state $\\rho$ in $d$ dimensions,\ngiven access to independent copies of $\\rho$.\n  We provide an algorithm with copy complexity $O(d^{2/\\alpha})$ for estimating\n$S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ for $\\alpha<1$, and copy complexity $O(d^{2})$ for estimating\n$S(\\rho)$, and $S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ for non-integral $\\alpha>1$. These bounds are\nat least quadratic in $d$, which is the order dependence on the number of\ncopies required for learning the entire state $\\rho$. For integral $\\alpha>1$,\non the other hand, we provide an algorithm for estimating $S_\\alpha(\\rho)$ with\na sub-quadratic copy complexity of $O(d^{2-2/\\alpha})$. We characterize the\ncopy complexity for integral $\\alpha>1$ up to constant factors by providing\nmatching lower bounds. For other values of $\\alpha$, and the von Neumann\nentropy, we show lower bounds on the algorithm that achieves the upper bound.\nThis shows that we either need new algorithms for better upper bounds, or\nbetter lower bounds to tighten the results.\n  For non-integral $\\alpha$, and the von Neumann entropy, we consider the well\nknown Empirical Young Diagram (EYD) algorithm, which is the analogue of\nempirical plug-in estimator in classical distribution estimation. As a\ncorollary, we strengthen a lower bound on the copy complexity of the EYD\nalgorithm for learning the maximally mixed state by showing that the lower\nbound holds with exponential probability (which was previously known to hold\nwith a constant probability). For integral $\\alpha>1$, we provide new\nconcentration results of certain polynomials that arise in Kerov algebra of\nYoung diagrams.\n", "  Inaccurate modelling of the near-surface layers of solar models causes a\nsystematic difference between modelled and observed solar mode frequencies.\nThis difference---known as the \"surface effect\" or \"surface term\"---presumably\nalso exists in other solar-like oscillators and must somehow be corrected to\naccurately relate mode frequencies to stellar model parameters. After briefly\ndescribing the various potential causes of surface effects, I will review\nrecent progress along two different lines. First, various methods have been\nproposed for removing the surface effect from the mode frequencies and thereby\nfitting stellar models without the disproportionate influence of the inaccurate\nnear-surface layers. Second, three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics\nsimulations are now being used to replace the near-surface layers of stellar\nmodels across a range of spectral types, leading to predictions of how some\ncomponents of the surface effect vary between stars. Finally, I shall briefly\ndiscuss the future of the problem in terms of both modelling and observation.\n", "  We show for the first time that different types of suprathermal ion\ndistributions may exist upstream of a single interplanetary shock. ACE and the\ntwo ARTEMIS satellites observed a shock on 8 October 2013. The ARTEMIS P1 and\nP2 spacecraft first observed field-aligned ions (P1) and gyrating ions (P2)\narriving from the shock. These were followed by intermediate ions and later by\na diffuse population. At the location of the P2 the shock exhibited an\nAlfv\\'enic Mach number of M$_A$=5.7 and was marginally quasi-perpendicular,\n($\\theta_{Bn}$=47$^\\circ$). At P1 spacecraft the shock was weaker (M$_A$=4.9)\nand more perpendicular ($\\theta_{Bn}$=61$^\\circ$). Consequently the observed\nsuprathermal ion and ultra low frequency wave properties were somewhat\ndifferent. At P2 the ULF waves are more intense and extend farther upstream\nfrom the shock. The energies of field aligned and gyrating ions in the shock\nrest frame were $\\sim$20~keV, which is much more than in the case of the\nstronger (M$_A$=6-7) Earth's bow-shock, where they are less than 10~keV\n", "  CRESST is a multi-stage experiment directly searching for dark matter (DM)\nusing cryogenic $\\mathrm{CaWO_4}$ crystals. Previous stages established leading\nlimits for the spin-independent DM-nucleon cross section down to DM-particle\nmasses $m_\\mathrm{DM}$ below $1\\,\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$. Furthermore, CRESST\nperformed a dedicated search for dark photons (DP) which excludes new parameter\nspace between DP masses $m_\\mathrm{DP}$ of $300\\,\\mathrm{eV/c^2}$ to\n$700\\,\\mathrm{eV/c^2}$.\n  In this contribution we will discuss the latest results based on the previous\nCRESST-II phase 2 and we will report on the status of the current CRESST-III\nphase 1: in this stage we have been operating 10 upgraded detectors with\n$24,\\mathrm{g}$ target mass each and enhanced detector performance since summer\n2016. The improved detector design in terms of background suppression and\nreduction of the detection threshold will be discussed with respect to the\nprevious stage. We will conclude with an outlook on the potential of the next\nstage, CRESST-III phase 2.\n", "  It is shown that investigation of ionization zones left after supernova\nexplosions can yield information on the mechanism active in those explosions.\n", "  We suggest that the kinematics and properties of interstellar object A/2017\nU1 point towards its formation in a protoplanetary disk in the ~45 Myr-old\nCarina or Columba young stellar associations, and subsequent ejection with a\nlow peculiar velocity (1-2 km/sec) during or soon after planet formation inside\nthe ice line. This scenario predicts that the Solar System will encounter more\nsuch objects with radiants similar to that of A/2017 U1.\n", "  In the VIP2 (VIolation of the Pauli Exlusion Principle) experiment at the\nGran Sasso underground laboratory (LNGS) we are searching for possible\nviolations of standard quantum mechanics predictions. With high precision we\ninvestigate the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the collapse of the wave function\n(collapse models). We will present our experimental method of searching for\npossible small violations of the Pauli Exclusion Principle for electrons, via\nthe search for \"anomalous\" X-ray transitions in copper atoms, produced by \"new\"\nelectrons (brought inside a copper bar by circulating current) which could have\nthe probability to undergo Pauli-forbidden transition to the ground state (1 s\nlevel) already occupied by two electrons. We will describe the concept of the\nVIP2 experiment taking data at LNGS presently. The goal of VIP2 is to test the\nPEP for electrons with unprecedented accuracy, down to a limit in the\nprobability that PEP is violated at the level of 10$^{-31}$. We will show\npreliminary experimental results obtained at LNGS and discuss implications of a\npossible violation.\n", "  We use the multi-spacecraft capabilities of the Cluster and THEMIS missions\nto show that two types of foreshock may be detected in spacecraft data. One is\nthe global foreshock that appears upstream of the Earth's quasi-parallel\nbow-shock under steady or variable interplanetary magnetic field. Another type\nis a traveling foreshock that is bounded by two rotational discontinuities in\nthe interplanetary magnetic field and propagates along the bow-shock. Foreshock\ncompressional boundaries are found at the edges of both types of foreshock. We\nshow that isolated foreshock cavities are a subset of the traveling foreshock\nthat form when two bounding rotational discontinuities are so close that the\nultra-low frequency waves do not develop in the region between them. We also\nreport observations of a spontaneous hot flow anomaly inside a traveling\nforeshock. This means that other phenomena, such as foreshock cavitons, may\nalso exist inside this type of foreshock. In the second part of this work we\npresent statistical properties of phenomena related to the foreshock, namely\nforeshock cavities, cavitons, spontaneous hot flow anomalies and foreshock\ncompressional boundaries. We show that spontaneous hot flow anomalies are the\nmost depleted transient structures in terms of the B-field and plasma density\ninside them and that the foreshock compressional boundaries and foreshock\ncavities are closely related structures.\n", "  It is natural to expect and simple to prove that every conformally flat space\npossess the maximal number of conformal Killing vector fields (CKVs). On the\nother hand, it is interesting to ask whether the converse is true. Is conformal\nflatness a necessary condition for the existence of the maximal number of CKVs?\nIn this review article it is proven that the answer is yes, a space admits the\nmaximal number of CKVs if, and only if, it is conformally flat.\n", "  Multi-band photometric and multi-object spectroscopic surveys of merging\ngalaxy clusters allow for the characterization of the distributions of\nconstituent dark matter and galaxy populations, constraints on the dynamics of\nthe merging subclusters, and an understanding of galaxy evolution of member\ngalaxies. We present deep photometric observations from Subaru/SuprimeCam and a\ncatalog of $\\sim$5400 spectroscopic cluster members from Keck/DEIMOS across 29\nmerging galaxy clusters ranging in redshift from $z=0.07$ to $0.55$. The\nensemble is compiled based on the presence of radio relics, which highlight\ncluster scale collisionless shocks in the intra-cluster medium. Together with\nthe spectroscopic and photometric information, the velocities, timescales, and\ngeometries of the respective merging events may be tightly constrained. In this\npreliminary analysis, the velocity distributions of 28 of the 29 clusters are\nshown to be well fit by single Gaussians. This indicates that radio relic\nmergers largely occur transverse to the line of sight and/or near apocenter. In\nthis paper, we present our optical and spectroscopic surveys, preliminary\nresults, and a discussion of the value of radio relic mergers for developing\naccurate dynamical models of each system.\n", "  Planets form in discs of gas and dust around stars, and keep growing by\naccretion of disc material while available. Massive planets clear a gap in that\nprotoplanetary disc, but still accrete through spiral wakes. On its way to the\nplanet, the gas will settle on a \\emph{circumplanetary} disc around the planet\nand slowly accrete on to it. The energy of the accreted gas will be released,\nheating the planet surroundings in a feedback process. For high enough\naccretion rates the planet should be detectable at infrared wavelengths. We aim\nto find whether detectable planet luminosities, $\\gtrsim 10^{-3} \\,\n\\textrm{L}_\\odot$, can occur when considering that the planet luminosity is\ncoupled to the accretion, and also to study which other effects has the\nfeedback on the dynamics of the circumplanetary and the gap regions. We model a\nplanet with mass ratio $q=10^{-3}$, orbiting at 10 AU from a solar mass star,\nusing a modified version of the 2D code FARGO-AD, which includes a prescription\nfor the accretion and feedback luminosity of the planet. We find that the\nplanetary feedback is able to partially deplete the circumplanetary disc, and\nto reduce the accretion rate onto the planet. However, detectable luminosities\nof $L_\\textrm{p}\\gtrsim 10^{-3}\\, \\textrm{L}_\\odot$ are still produced. The\nfeedback also contributes to partially refilling the gap, to heat up the\ncoorbital region, and to perturb the orbital velocity of the gas.\n", "  Quantitative description of reaction mechanisms in aqueous phase\nelectrochemistry requires experimental characterization of local water\nstructure at the electrode/aqueous interface and its evolution with changing\npotential. Gaining such insight experimentally under electrochemical conditions\nis a formidable task. Here we characterize the potential dependent structure of\na sub-population of interfacial water that have one OH group pointing towards a\ngold working electrode using interface specific vibrational spectroscopy in a\nthin film electrochemical cell. Such 'free-OH' groups are the molecular level\nobservable of an extended hydrophobic interface. This 'free-OH' interacts only\nweakly with the Au surface at all potentials, has an orientational distribution\nthat narrows as one approaches the potential of zero charge and disappears on\nthe oxidation of the gold electrode.\n", "  As a very fundamental principle in quantum physics, uncertainty principle has\nbeen studied intensively via various uncertainty inequalities. Based on the\ninformation measure introduced by Brukner and Zeilinger in [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n83, 3354 (1999)], we derive an uncertainty conservation relation in the\npresence of quantum memory. We show that the sum of measurement uncertainties\nover a complete set of mutually unbiased bases on a subsystem is equal to a\ntotal uncertainty determined by the initial bipartite state. Hence for a given\nbipartite system the uncertainty is conserved and the uncertainty relation is\ngiven by an equality. When the total uncertainty vanishes, all the\nuncertainties related to every mutually unbiased base measurement are zero,\nwhich is substantially different from the uncertainty relation given by Berta\net. al. [Nat. Phys. 6, 659 (2010)] where an uncertainty inequality is\npresented. By directly measuring the corresponding quantum mechanical\nobservables on a 5-qubit spin system, we experimentally verify the uncertainty\nconservation relation in the presence of quantum memory without quantum state\ntomography.\n", "  It is challenging to transform an arbitrary quantum circuit into a form\nprotected by surface code quantum error correcting codes (a variant of\ntopological quantum error correction), especially if the goal is to minimise\noverhead. One of the issues is the efficient placement of magic state\ndistillation sub circuits, so-called distillation boxes, in the space-time\nvolume that abstracts the computation's required resources. This work presents\na general, systematic, online method for the synthesis of such circuits.\nDistillation box placement is controlled by so-called schedulers. The work\nintroduces a greedy scheduler generating compact box placements. The\nimplemented software, whose source code is available online, is used to\nillustrate and discuss synthesis examples. Synthesis and optimisation\nimprovements are proposed.\n", "  We study the synchronized interval in undirected and unweighted random\nnetworks of coupled oscillators as a function of the number of edges. In many\ncoupled oscillator systems, synchronization is stable in a finite interval of\ncoupling parameter, which we define as the synchronized interval. We find in\nrandom networks, the width of the synchronized interval is maximum for an\noptimal number of edges. We derive analytically an estimation for this optimal\nvalue of the number of edges. In small networks, the analytical estimation\ndeviates from the numerical results. However, in large networks the analytical\nand numerical results are in excellent agreement.\n", "  We propose a statistical model for natural language that begins by\nconsidering language as a monoid, then representing it in complex matrices with\na compatible translation invariant probability measure. We interpret the\nprobability measure as arising via the Born rule from a translation invariant\nmatrix product state.\n", "  Using the tri-hamiltonian splitting method, the authors of [Anco and\nMobasheramini, Physica D, 355:1--23, 2017] derived two $U(1)$-invariant\nnonlinear PDEs that arise from the hierarchy of the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation and admit peakons ($non-smooth\\ solitons$). In the present paper,\nthese two peakon PDEs are generalized to a family of $U(1)$-invariant peakon\nPDEs parametrized by the real projective line $ \\mathbf{RP} ^1$. All equations\nin this family are shown to posses $conservative\\ peakon \\ solutions$ (whose\nSobolev $H^1(\\mathbf{R})$ norm is time invariant). The Hamiltonian structure\nfor the sector of conservative peakons is identified and the peakon ODEs are\nshown to be Hamiltonian with respect to several Poisson structures. It is shown\nthat the resulting Hamilonian peakon flows in the case of the two peakon\nequations derived in [Anco and Mobasheramini, Physica D, 355:1--23, 2017] form\northogonal families, while in general the Hamiltonian peakon flows for two\ndifferent equations in the general family intersect at a fixed angle equal to\nthe angle between two lines in $ \\mathbf{RP} ^1$ parametrizing those two\nequations. Moreover, it is shown that inverse spectral methods allow one to\nsolve explicitly the dynamics of conservative peakons using explicit solutions\nto a certain interpolation problem. The graphs of multipeakon solutions confirm\nthe existence of multipeakon breathers as well as asymptotic formation of pairs\nof two peakon bound states in the non-periodic time domain.\n", "  Recent advances in holography, wireless sensing and light fidelity\ntechnologies have resulted in the need for antennas that can support highly\nefficient beam directivity for a broad angular range. Transmitarrays have been\nshown to be promising candidates for the determination of such structures.\nHere, we present a comprehensive methodology for the design of subwavelength\nall-dielectric flat metasurfaces with high transmission and deflection range.\nThe metasurfaces are CMOS compatible and can be fabricated using conventional\nprocessing of silicon-on-insulator technology. The optimized structures exhibit\nup to 95% efficiency for a wide-angle deflection range from 20{\\deg} to\n60{\\deg} in air, at operating wavelengths near 1550 nm. Furthermore, we propose\nthe potential multi-wavelength and muti-mode excitation capabilities of the\ndesigned supercell. This is achieved by shifting the resonance of each post of\nthe metasurface to the wavelength of interest opening up opportunities for\nwavelength multiplexing with a single structure. Our results facilitate the\nrealization of broad angle flat deflectors and holographic devices but also\nindicate that today's bulky and expensive light fidelity optical routers could\nbe substituted by ultra-small chips that are inexpensive to fabricate and can\nbe commercially implemented.\n", "  Accurately predicting the future power demand of electric vehicles is\nimportant for developing policy and industrial strategy. Here we propose a\nmethod to create a representative set of electricity demand profiles using\nsurvey data from conventional vehicles. This is achieved by developing a model\nwhich maps journey and vehicle parameters to an energy consumption, and\napplying it individually to the entire data set. As a case study the National\nTravel Survey was used to create a set of profiles representing an entirely\nelectric UK fleet of vehicles. This allowed prediction of the required\nelectricity demand and sizing of the necessary vehicle batteries. Also, by\ninferring location information from the data, the effectiveness of various\ncharging strategies was assessed. These results will be useful in both National\nplanning, and as the inputs to further research on the impact of electric\nvehicles.\n", "  The International Cosmic Day (ICD) is an astroparticle physics outreach event\nfor high-school students and brings together students and different physics\noutreach projects from all over the world. Groups of scientists, teachers, and\nstudents meet for one day to learn about cosmic rays and perform an experiment\nwith atmospheric muons. All participating groups investigate an identical\nquestion. The students are enabled to work together like in an international\ncollaboration, discussing their results in joint video conferences. Analyzing\ndata, comparing and discussing with other \"young scientists\" gives the students\na glimpse of how professional scientific research works. Scientists join the\nvideo conferences and give lectures to provide an insight in current\nastroparticle physics research. Several participating research experiments\nanalyze big science data tailored to the questions addressed by the students\nand present their results on equal terms with the students. To create a lasting\nevent, proceedings with measurement results of all participating groups are\npublished. Every participant receives a personal e-mail with his certificate\nand the proceedings booklet. Organized by DESY in cooperation with Netzwerk\nTeilchenwelt, IPPOG, QuarkNet, Fermilab, and national partners like INFN, the\nICD is a growing event with more and more popularity. We present the\norganization of the event and the experience from five years of ICD.\n", "  In addition to enabling movement towards environments with favourable living\nconditions, swimming by microorganisms has also been linked to enhanced mixing\nand improved nutrient uptake by their populations. Experimental studies have\nshown that Brownian tracer particles exhibit enhanced diffusion due to the\nswimmers, while theoretical models have linked this increase in diffusion to\nthe flows generated by the swimming microorganisms, as well as collisions with\nthe swimmers. In this study, we perform detailed simulations based on the\nforce-coupling method and its recent extensions to the swimming and Brownian\nparticles to examine tracer displacements and effective tracer diffusivity in\nsquirmer suspensions. By isolating effects such as hydrodynamic or steric\ninteractions, we provide physical insight into experimental measurements of the\ntracer displacement distribution. In addition, we extend results to the\nsemi-dilute regime where the swimmer-swimmer interactions affect tracer\ntransport and the effective tracer diffusivity no longer scales linearly with\nthe swimmer volume fraction.\n", "  Quantitative methods are more familiar to most geophysicists with direct\ninversion or indirect inversion. We will discuss seismic inversion in a high\nlevel sense without getting into the actual algorithms. We will stay with\nmeta-equations and argue pros and cons based on certain mathematical theorems.\n", "  Problems related to the application of hidden color components in multi-quark\nsystems are discussed in this report.\n", "  Numerical simulations play a key important role in modern cosmology. Examples\nare plenty including the cosmic web - large scale structure of the distribution\nof galaxies in space - which was first observed in N-body simulations and later\ndiscovered in observations. The cuspy dark matter halo profiles, the\noverabundance of satellites, the Too-Big-Too-Fail problem are other examples of\ntheoretical predictions that have a dramatic impact on recent developments in\ncosmology and galaxy formation. Large observational surveys such as e.g. SDSS,\nEuclid, and LSST are intimately connected with extensive cosmological\nsimulations that provide statistical errors and tests for systematics. Accurate\npredictions for baryonic acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions\nfrom high-resolution and large-volume cosmological simulations are required for\ninterpretation of these large-scale galaxy/qso surveys. However, most of the\nresults from extensive computer simulations, that would be greatly beneficial\nif publicly available, are still in hands of few research groups. Even when the\nsimulation data is available, sharing vast amounts of data can be overwhelming.\nWe argue that there is an effective and simple path to expand the data access\nand dissemination of numerous results from different cosmological models. Here\nwe demonstrate that public access can be effectively provided with relatively\nmodest resources. Among different results, we release for the astronomical\ncommunity terabytes of raw data of th popular Bolshoi and MultiDark\nsimulations. We also provide numerous results that are focused on mimicking\nobservational data and galaxy surveys for major projects. Skies and Universes\nis a community effort: data are produced and shared by many research groups. We\noffer to other cosmologists and astronomers to host their data products in the\nskiesanduniverses.org space.\n", "  High power orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) beam has dominant advantages in\ncapacity increasing and data receiving for free-space optical communication\nsystems at long distance. Utilizing coherent combination of beam array\ntechnique and helical phase approximation by piston-phase-array, we have\nproposed a generation system of high power novel beam carrying OAM, which could\novercome power limitation of common vortex phase modulator and single beam. We\nhave experimentally implemented a high power OAM beam by coherent beam\ncombination (CBC) of a six-element hexagonal fiber amplifier array. We show\nthat the CBC technique utilized to control the piston phase differences among\nthe array beams has a high accuracy with residual phase errors superior to\n{\\lambda}/30. On the premise of CBC, we have obtained novel vortex beams\ncarrying OAM of +/- 1 by applying an additional piston-phase-array modulation\non the corresponding beam array. The experimental results approximately\ncoincide with the theoretical analysis. This work could be beneficial to the\nareas that need high power OAM beams, like ultra-distance free-space optical\ncommunications, biomedical treatments, powerful trapping and manipulation under\ndeep potential well.\n", "  We consider certain Lagrangian states associated to unstable horocycles on\nthe modular surface $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, and show that for\nsufficiently large logarithmic times, expectation values for the wave\npropagated states diverge from the classical transport along geodesics. This is\ndue to the fact that these states \"escape to the cusp\" very quickly, at\nlogarithmic times, while the geodesic flow continues to equidistribute on the\nsurface. The proof relies crucially on the analysis of expectation values for\nEisenstein series initiated by Luo-Sarnak and Jakobson, based on subconvexity\nestimates for relevant $L$-functions--- in other words, this is a very special\ncase in which we can analyze long time propagation explicitly with tools from\narithmetic.\n", "  Over almost three decades the TAUP conference has seen a remarkable momentum\ngain in direct dark matter search. An important accelerator were first\nindications for a modulating signal rate in the DAMA/NaI experiment reported in\n1997. Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics. No other direct dark matter search\ncould confirm the DAMA claim up to now; moreover, numerous null-results are in\nclear contradiction under so-called standard assumptions for the dark matter\nhalo and the interaction mechanism of dark with ordinary matter. As both bear a\ndependence on the target material, resolving this controversial situation will\nconvincingly only be possible with an experiment using sodium iodide (NaI) as\ntarget. COSINUS aims to even go a step further by combining NaI with a novel\ndetection approach. COSINUS aims to operate NaI as a cryogenic calorimeter\nreading scintillation light and phonon/heat signal. Two distinct advantages\narise from this approach, a substantially lower energy threshold for nuclear\nrecoils and particle identification on an event-by-event basis. These key\nbenefits will allow COSINUS to clarify a possible nuclear recoil origin of the\nDAMA signal with comparatively little exposure of O(100kg days) and, thereby,\nanswer a long-standing question of particle physics. Today COSINUS is in R&D\nphase; in this contribution we show results from the 2nd prototype, albeit the\nfirst one of the final foreseen detector design. The key finding of this\nmeasurement is that pure, undoped NaI is a truly excellent scintillator at low\ntemperatures: We measure 13.1% of the total deposited energy in the NaI crystal\nin the form of scintillation light (in the light detector).\n", "  Papers on the ANTARES multi-messenger program, prepared for the 35th\nInternational Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea) by the\nANTARES Collaboration\n", "  Papers on the searches for dark matter and exotics, neutrino oscillations and\ndetector calibration, prepared for the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference\n(ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea) by the ANTARES Collaboration\n", "  The sedimentation process of granular materials exists ubiquitously in nature\nand many fields which involve the solid-liquid separation. This paper employs\nthe coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM)\nto investigate the sedimentation process of non-cohesive particles, including\nthe hindered settling stage and the deposition stage. Firstly, the coupled\nCFD-DEM model for sedimentation is validated by the hindered settling velocity\nat different solid volume concentrations of suspension (0.05~0.6). Two typical\nmodes of sedimentation are also presented by the concentration profiles and the\nequal-concentration lines. Then, the comparisons between mono- and\npoly-dispersed particle system are detailed. In the sedimentation of the\npoly-dispersed particle system, the segregation phenomenon is simulated.\nFurthermore, this segregation effect reduces with the increase of the initial\nsolid concentration of suspension. From the simulations, the contact force\nbetween every pair of particles can be obtained, hence we demonstrate the\n\"effective stress principle\" from the view of the particle contact force by\ngiving the correspondence between the particle contact force and the \"effective\nstress\", which is a critical concept of soil mechanics. We also demonstrate the\neffective stress principle from the view of the contact force acting on\nparticles. Moreover, the deposition stage can be simulated by CFD-DEM method,\ntherefore the solid concentrations of sediment bed on different conditions are\nstudied. Based on the simulation results of maximum solid concentration and the\ntheory of sedimentation, this paper also discusses a method to calculate the\ncritical time when sedimentation ends of two typical modes of sedimentation.\n", "  The recently developed interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF)\ndecomposition is a powerful way for compressing the redundant information in\nthe set of orbital pairs, and has been used to accelerate quantum chemistry\ncalculations in a number of contexts. The key ingredient of the ISDF\ndecomposition is to select a set of non-uniform grid points, so that the values\nof the orbital pairs evaluated at such grid points can be used to accurately\ninterpolate those evaluated at all grid points. The set of non-uniform grid\npoints, called the interpolation points, can be automatically selected by a QR\nfactorization with column pivoting (QRCP) procedure. This is the\ncomputationally most expensive step in the construction of the ISDF\ndecomposition. In this work, we propose a new approach to find the\ninterpolation points based on the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) method,\nwhich offers a much less expensive alternative to the QRCP procedure when ISDF\nis used in the context of hybrid functional electronic structure calculations.\nThe CVT method only uses information from the electron density, and can be\nefficiently implemented using a K-Means algorithm. We find that this new method\nachieves comparable accuracy to the ISDF-QRCP method, at a cost that is\nnegligible in the overall hybrid functional calculations. For instance, for a\nsystem containing $1000$ silicon atoms simulated using the HSE06 hybrid\nfunctional on $2000$ computational cores, the cost of QRCP-based method for\nfinding the interpolation points costs $434.2$ seconds, while the CVT procedure\nonly takes $3.2$ seconds. We also find that the ISDF-CVT method also enhances\nthe smoothness of the potential energy surface in the context of \\emph{ab\ninitio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations with hybrid functionals.\n", "  Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)/Proportional Counter Array (PCA)\nobservations of IGR J19294+1816 covering two outburst episodes are reported.\nThe first outburst happened during MJD 54921-54925 (2009 C.E.) and the second\none happened during MJD 55499-55507 (2010 C.E.). In both the cases the PCA\nobservations were made during the decay phase of the outburst, with the source\nexhibiting temporal and spectral evolution with the change in flux. At the\nbright flux level an absorption feature at 35.5 keV is detected in the spectra\nwhich may be attributed to Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature corresponding\nto a magnetic field of B = 4.13*10^12 Gauss. This is also detected at a lower\nsignificance in two other observations. In addition an Fe line emission at 6.4\nkeV is prominently detected during the highest flux. X-ray pulsations are\ndetected in 9 out of 10 observations; no pulsations were found in the\nobservation with the lowest flux level. During this observation with the lowest\nflux the pulsation phenomenon becomes detectable only at the soft X-ray bands.\n", "  We present Bernstein-Sato identities for scalar-, spinor- and differential\nform-valued distribution kernels on Euclidean space associated to conformal\nsymmetry breaking operators. The associated Bernstein-Sato operators lead to\npartially new formulae for conformal symmetry breaking differential operators\non functions, spinors and differential forms.\n", "  Where does quantum mechanics part ways with classical mechanics? How does\nquantum randomness differ fundamentally from classical randomness? We cannot\nfully explain how the theories differ until we can derive them within a single\naxiomatic framework, allowing an unambiguous account of how one theory is the\nlimit of the other. Here we derive nonrelativistic quantum mechanics and\nclassical statistical mechanics within a common framework. The common axioms\ninclude conservation of average energy and conservation of probability current.\nBut two axioms distinguish quantum mechanics from classical statistical\nmechanics: an \"ontic extension\" defines a nonseparable (global) random variable\nthat generates physical correlations, and an \"epistemic restriction\" constrains\nallowed phase space distributions. The ontic extension and epistemic\nrestriction, with strength on the order of Planck's constant, imply quantum\nentanglement and uncertainty relations. This framework suggests that the wave\nfunction is epistemic, yet it does not provide an ontic dynamics for individual\nsystems.\n", "  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can be used to successfully determine\nthe structures of proteins. However, such studies are typically done ex situ\nafter extraction of the protein from the cellular environment. Here we describe\nan application for nanodiamonds as targeted intensity contrast labels in\nbiological TEM, using the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as a model macroassembly.\nWe demonstrate that delivery of antibody-conjugated nanodiamonds to live\nmammalian cells using maltotriose-conjugated polypropylenimine dendrimers\nresults in efficient localization of nanodiamonds to the intended cellular\ntarget. We further identify signatures of nanodiamonds under TEM that allow for\nunambiguous identification of individual nanodiamonds from a resin-embedded,\nOsO4-stained environment. This is the first demonstration of nanodiamonds as\nlabels for nanoscale TEM-based identification of subcellular protein\nassemblies. These results, combined with the unique fluorescence properties and\nbiocompatibility of nanodiamonds, represent an important step toward the use of\nnanodiamonds as markers for correlated optical/electron bioimaging.\n", "  We report on the successful synthesis and hyperpolarization of N unprotected\n{\\alpha} amino acid ethyl acrylate esters and extensively, on an alanine\nderivative hyperpolarized by PHIP (4.4$\\pm$1% $^{13}$C-polarization), meeting\nrequired levels for in vivo detection. Using water as solvent increases\nbiocompatibility and the absence of N-protection is expected to maintain\nbiological activity.\n", "  The present research is the first attempt to systematically quantify the\ndislocation-precipitate interaction in terms of applied shear stress,\nprecipitate resistance, and the required time to reach the critical state of\ndislocation-precipitate interaction when a dislocation line is about to pass\nthrough precipitates. To model the dislocation-precipitate interaction, we\nadopt a modified three-dimensional dislocation dynamics. Using the present\nmodeling approach, which employs three-dimensional dislocation dynamics\nsimulations, we obtain thousands of data points, accounting for various\nprecipitate resistances, applied shear stresses, and precipitate spacing. The\nmaterial of reference is Copper (Cu). From the simulations, which quantify the\ndislocation-precipitate interaction in terms of the applied shear stress,\nprecipitate resistance scale, and dislocation-precipitate interaction time, we\nfound a universal equation. The dislocation-precipitate interaction time versus\nprecipitate resistance and stress, referred to as the \"dislocation-precipitate\ninteraction map,\" determines the \"pass\" or \"no-pass\" state of the interaction.\nUsing this map, we incorporate the dislocation-precipitate interaction time in\na two-dimensional multiscale framework which adopts the dislocation dynamics\napproach at the micro-scale and the finite element method at the macro-scale.\nWe use this framework to model the mechanical behavior of free-standing copper\nthin films. The results show a dual effect of the dislocation-precipitate\ninteraction time on the hardening level.\n", "  Properties of two ThCr2Si2-type materials are discussed within the context of\ntheir established structural and magnetic symmetries. Both materials develop\ncollinear, G-type antiferromagnetic order above room temperature, and magnetic\nions occupy acentric sites in centrosymmetric structures. We refute a previous\nconjecture that BaMn2As2 is an example of a magnetoelectric material with\nhexadecapole order by exposing flaws in supporting arguments, principally, an\nomission of discrete symmetries enforced by the symmetry of sites used by Mn\nions and, also, improper classifications of the primary and secondary\norder-parameters. Implications for future experiments designed to improve our\nunderstanding of BaMn2P2 and BaMn2As2 magnetoelectric properties, using neutron\nand x-ray diffraction, are examined. Patterns of Bragg spots caused by\nconventional magnetic dipoles and magnetoelectric (Dirac) multipoles are\npredicted to be distinct, which raises the intriguing possibility of a unique\nand comprehensive examination of the magnetoelectric state by diffraction. A\nroto-inversion operation in Mn site symmetry is ultimately responsible for the\ndistinguishing features.\n", "  The electronic structure and chemical bonding in reactively magnetron\nsputtered ZrHx (x=0.15, 0.30, 1.16) thin films with oxygen content as low as\n0.2 at% are investigated by 4d valence band, shallow 4p core-level and 3d\ncore-level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. With increasing hydrogen content,\nwe observe significant reduction of the 4d valence states close to the Fermi\nlevel as a result of redistribution of intensity towards the H 1s - Zr 4d\nhybridization region at about 6 eV below the Fermi level. For low hydrogen\ncontent (x=0.15, 0.30), the films consist of a superposition of hexagonal\nclosest packed metal (alpha-phase)and understoichiometric delta-ZrHx (CaF2-type\nstructure) phases, while for x=1.16, the film form single phase ZrHx that\nlargely resembles that of stoichiometric delta-ZrH2 phase. We show that the\ncubic delta-ZrHx phase is metastable as thin film up to x=1.16 while for higher\nH-contents, the structure is predicted to be tetragonally distorted. For the\ninvestigated ZrH1.16 film, we find chemical shifts of 0.68 and 0.51 eV towards\nhigher binding energies for the Zr 4p3/2 and 3d5/2 peak positions,\nrespectively. Compared to the Zr metal binding energies of 27.26 and 178.87 eV,\nthis signifies a charge-transfer from Zr to H atoms. The change in the\nelectronic structure, spectral line shapes, and chemical shifts as function of\nhydrogen content is discussed in relation to the charge-transfer from Zr to H\nthat affects the conductivity by charge redistribution in the valence band.\n", "  The Neptunian satellite system is unusual. The major satellites of Jupiter,\nSaturn, and Uranus are all in prograde, low-inclination orbits. Neptune on the\nother hand, has the fewest satellites, and most of the system's mass is within\none irregular satellite, Triton. Triton was most likely captured by Neptune and\ndestroyed the primordial regular satellite system. We investigate the\ninteractions between a newly captured Triton and a prior Neptunian satellite\nsystem. We find that a prior satellite system with a mass ratio similar to the\nUranian system or smaller has a substantial likelihood of reproducing the\ncurrent Neptunian system, while a more massive system has a low probability of\nleading to the current configuration. Moreover, Triton's interaction with a\nprior satellite system may offer a mechanism to decrease its high initial\nsemimajor axis fast enough to preserve small irregular satellites (Nereid-like)\nthat might otherwise be lost during a prolonged Triton circularization via\ntides alone.\n", "  After a discussion of the Frauchiger-Renner argument that no 'single- world'\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics can be self-consistent, I propose a\n'Bohrian' alternative to many-worlds or QBism as the rational option.\n", "  Simulations of ionization induced injection in a laser driven plasma\nwakefield show that high-quality electron injectors in the 50-200 MeV range can\nbe achieved in a gas cell with a tailored density profile. Using the PIC code\nWarp with parameters close to existing experimental conditions, we show that\nthe concentration of $\\mathrm{N_2}$ in a hydrogen plasma with a tailored\ndensity profile is an efficient parameter to tune electron beam properties\nthrough the control of the interplay between beam loading effects and varying\naccelerating field in the density profile. For a given laser plasma\nconfiguration, with moderate normalized laser amplitude, $a_0=1.6$ and maximum\nelectron plasma density, $n_{e0}=4\\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, the\noptimum concentration results in a robust configuration to generate electrons\nat 150~MeV with a rms energy spread of 4\\% and a spectral charge density of\n1.8~pC/MeV.\n", "  The concept of a nano-actuator that uses ferroelectric switching to generate\nenhanced displacements is explored using a phase-field model. The actuator has\na ground state in the absence of applied electric field that consists of\npolarized domains oriented to form a flux closure. When electric field is\napplied, the polarization reorients through ferroelectric switching and\nproduces strain. The device is mechanically biased by a substrate and returns\nto the ground state when electric field is removed, giving a repeatable\nactuation cycle. The mechanical strains which accompany ferroelectric switching\nare several times greater than the strains attained due to the piezoelectric\neffect alone. We also demonstrate a second design of actuator in which the\ndisplacements are further increased by the bending of a ferroelectric beam.\nPhase-field modelling is used to track the evolution of domain patterns in the\ndevices during the actuation cycle, and to study the design parameters so as to\nenhance the achievable actuation strains.\n", "  In [1,2] we have developed a method (we call it the S-function method) that\nis successful in treating certain classes of rational second order ordinary\ndifferential equations (rational 2ODEs) that are particularly `resistant' to\ncanonical Lie methods and to Darbouxian approaches. In this present paper, we\ngeneralize the S-function method making it capable of dealing with a class of\nelementary 2ODEs presenting elementary functions. Then, we apply this method to\na Duffing-Van der Pol forced oscillator, obtaining an entire class of first\nintegrals.\n", "  We first show that hypergeometric functions appear naturally as spectral\nfunctions when applying pseudo-differential calculus to decipher heat kernel\nasymptotic in the situation where the symbol algebra is noncommutative. Such\nobservation leads to a unified (works for arbitrary dimension) method of\ncomputing the modular curvature on toric noncommutative manifolds. We show that\nthe spectral functions that define the quantum part of the curvature have\nclosed forms in terms of hypergeometric functions. As a consequence, we are\nable to obtained explicit expressions (as functions in the dimension parameter)\nfor those spectral functions without using symbolic integration. A surprising\ngeometric consequence is that the functional relations coming from the\nvariation of the associated Einstein-Hilbert action still hold when the\ndimension parameter takes real values.\n", "  Bent band structures have been empirically described in ferroelectric\nmaterials to explain the functioning of recently developed ferroelectric\ntunneling junction and photovoltaic devices. This report presents experimental\nevidence for ferroelectric band bending, which was observed in the depth\nprofiles of atomic orbitals of angle-resolved hard x-ray photoemission spectra\nof ferroelectric BaTiO3 thin films. The ferroelectric bent band structure is\nseparated into three depth regions; the shallowest and deepest regions are\nslightly modulated by the screening effect at surface and interface,\nrespectively, and the intermediate region exhibits the pure ferroelectric\neffect. In the pure ferroelectric bent band structure, we found that the\nbinding energy of outer shell electrons shows a larger shift than that of inner\nshell electrons, and that the difference in energy shift is correlated with the\natomic configuration of the soft phonon mode. These findings could lead to a\nsimple understanding of the origin of electric polarization.\n", "  We describe new measurements of the remarkable H$\\alpha$/UV/X-ray bowshock\nand pulsar wind nebula of the isolated millisecond pulsar PSR J2124$-$3358.\n{\\it CXO} imaging shows a one-sided jet structure with a softer equatorial\noutflow. KOALA IFU spectroscopy shows that non-radiative emission dominates the\nbow shock and that the H$\\alpha$ nebula is asymmetric about the pulsar velocity\nwith an elongation into the plane of the sky. We extend analytic models of the\ncontact discontinuity to accommodate such shapes and compare these to the data.\nUsing {\\it HST} UV detections of the pulsar and bow shock, radio timing\ndistance and proper motion measurements and the {\\it CXO}-detected projected\nspin axis we model the 3-D PWN momentum flux distribution. The integrated\nmomentum flux depends on the ionization of the ambient ISM, but for an expected\nambient WNM we infer $I = 2.4 \\times 10^{45} {\\rm g\\,cm^2}$. This implies\n$M_{NS} = 1.6-2.1 M_\\odot$, depending on the equation of state, which in turn\nsuggests that the MSP gained significant mass during recycling and then lost\nits companion. However, this conclusion is at present tentative, since lower\nionization allows $\\sim 30\\%$ lower masses and uncertainty in the parallax\nallows up to 50% error.\n", "  Quantum electrodynamics predicts that heavy atoms ($Z > Z_c \\approx 170$)\nwill undergo the process of atomic collapse where electrons sink into the\npositron continuum and a new family of so-called collapsing states emerges. The\nrelativistic electrons in graphene exhibit the same physics but at a much lower\ncritical charge ($Z_c \\approx 1$) which has made it possible to confirm this\nphenomenon experimentally. However, there exist conflicting predictions on the\neffect of a magnetic field on atomic collapse. These theoretical predictions\nare based on the continuum Dirac-Weyl equation, which does not have an exact\nanalytical solution for the interplay of a supercritical Coulomb potential and\nthe magnetic field. Approximative solutions have been proposed, but because the\ntwo effects compete on similar energy scales, the theoretical treatment varies\ndepending on the regime which is being considered. These limitations are\novercome here by starting from a tight-binding approach and computing exact\nnumerical results. By avoiding special limit cases, we found a smooth evolution\nbetween the different regimes. We predict that the atomic collapse effect\npersists even after the magnetic field is activated and that the critical\ncharge remains unchanged. We show that the atomic collapse regime is\ncharacterized: 1) by a series of Landau level anticrossings and 2) by the\nabsence of $\\sqrt{B}$ scaling of the Landau levels with regard to magnetic\nfield strength.\n", "  English and Spanish translations are provided for Fritz Zwicky's seminal\narticle on \"The Redshift of Extragalactic Nebulae\", published in German in\nHelvetica Physica Acta in 1933\n<https://www.e-periodica.ch/digbib/view?pid=hpa-001:1933:6#112>. This paper is\nusually cited as the first evidence for dark matter (\"dunkle Materie\", not\n\"missing matter\"). Zwicky's conclusion is based on the velocity dispersion of\nonly seven galaxies in the Coma cluster of galaxies. Now, 84 years later, with\n1000+ radial velocities measured for Coma cluster members, Coma's velocity\ndispersion is very close to that found by Zwicky.

The recent experimentally measured activation enthalpy and\nentropy, for chorismate rearrangement reaction in PchB brings up a hotly\ndebated issue whether the chorismate mutase catalyzed reaction is\nentropy-driven reaction. Extensive configurational sampling combined with\nquantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics (QM/MM MD) provides an\napproach to calculate entropic contribution in condensed phase reactions.\nComplete reaction pathway is exploited by QM/MM MD simulations at DFT and\nSCC-DFTB levels. The overall entropy change calculated at SCC-DFTB level QM/MM\nMD simulations, is close agreement with the experimental value. Conformation\nanalysis indicates that the self-ordering of chorismate in the active site of\nPchB also contributes to total entropy change. This entropy penalty including\nconformational transformation entropy and activation entropy cannot be\nintuitively speculated from the crystal structure that only acts as a\nstationary state along the reaction pathway of PchB catalyzed reaction. This is\nthe first time to use QM/MM MD simulations to calculate the activation entropy\nfrom the temperature dependence of reliable free energy profiles with extensive\nsimulation time. The reasonable insight in enthalpy/entropy scheme clarifies\nthe detailed entropy change and provides a quantitative tool to the\ncontradicted experimental results.\n", "  Fireball observations from camera networks provide position and time\ninformation along the trajectory of a meteoroid that is transiting our\natmosphere. The complete dynamical state of the meteoroid at each measured time\ncan be estimated using Bayesian filtering techniques. A particle filter is a\nnovel approach to modelling the uncertainty in meteoroid trajectories and\nincorporates errors in initial parameters, the dynamical model used and\nobserved position measurements. Unlike other stochastic approaches, a particle\nfilter does not require predefined values for initial conditions or\nunobservable trajectory parameters. The Bunburra Rockhole fireball (Spurn\\'y et\nal. 2012), observed by the Australian Desert Fireball Network (DFN) in 2007, is\nused to determine the effectiveness of a particle filter for use in fireball\ntrajectory modelling. The final mass is determined to be $2.16\\pm1.33\\, kg$\nwith a final velocity of $6030\\pm216\\, m\\,s^{-1}$, similar to previously\ncalculated values. The full automatability of this approach will allow an\nunbiased evaluation of all events observed by the DFN and lead to a better\nunderstanding of the dynamical state and size frequency distribution of\nasteroid and cometary debris in the inner solar system.\n", "  This paper reviews a phenomenological approach to the gravitational lensing\nby exotic objects such as the Ellis wormhole lens, where exotic lens objects\nmay follow a non-standard form of the equation of state or may obey a modified\ngravity theory. A gravitational lens model is proposed in the inverse powers of\nthe distance, such that the Schwarzschild lens and exotic lenses can be\ndescribed in a unified manner as a one parameter family. As observational\nimplications, the magnification, shear, photo-centroid motion and time delay in\nthis lens model are discussed.\n", "  We propose an on-chip source of entangled photon pairs that uses an\narrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) with multiple nonlinear input waveguides as\ncorrelated photon pair sources. The AWG wavelength-demultiplexes photon pairs\ncreated in input waveguides and simultaneously produces a high-dimensional\nentangled state encoded in the optical path. We implemented the device with a\nmonolithic silicon-silica waveguide integration platform and demonstrated the\nentanglement of two dimensions in a proof-of-principle experiment.\n", "  Here we present quasi-simultaneous observations of the flickering of the\nsymbiotic binary star CH Cyg in U, B and V bands. We calculate the flickering\nsource parameters and discuss the possible reason for the flickering cessation\nin the period 2010-2013.\n", "  The energetic pulsar, PSR J2032+4127, has been recently discovered in the\ndirection of the unidentified HEGRA TeV gamma-ray source (TeV J2032+4130). It\nis proposed that this pulsar forms a binary system with the Be type star, MT91\n213, expected to reach the periastron late in 2017. We performed detailed\ncalculations of the gamma-ray emission produced close to the binary system's\nperiastron passage by applying a simple geometrical model. Electrons\naccelerated at the collision region of pulsar and stellar winds initiate\nanisotropic Inverse Compton electron-positron pair cascades by scattering soft\nradiation from the massive companion. The gamma-ray spectra, from such a\ncomptonization process, are confronted with the measurements of the extended\nTeV gamma-ray emission from the HEGRA TeV gamma-ray source. We discuss\nconditions within the binary system, at the periastron passage of the pulsar,\nfor which the gamma-ray emission from the binary can overcome the extended,\nsteady TeV gamma-ray emission from the HEGRA TeV gamma-ray source.\n", "  We study a universe filled with cold dark matter in the form of discrete\ninhomogeneities (e.g., galaxies) and dark energy in the form of a continuous\nperfect fluid. We develop a first-order scalar perturbation theory in the weak\ngravity limit around a spatially flat Friedmann universe. Our approach works at\nall cosmic scales and incorporates linear and nonlinear effects with respect to\nenergy density fluctuations. The gravitational potential can be split into\nindividual contributions from each matter source. Each potential is\ncharacterized by a Yukawa interaction with the same range, which is of the\norder of 3700 Mpc at the present time. The derived equations can form the\ntheoretical basis for numerical simulations for a wide class of modern\ncosmological models.\n", "  We map an interacting helical liquid system, coupled to an external magnetic\nfield and s-wave superconductor, to an XYZ spin system, and it undergoes\nMajorana-Ising transition by tuning of parameters. In the Majorana state,\nlowest excitation gap decays exponentially with system size, and the system has\ndegenerate ground state in the thermodynamic limit. On the contrary, the gap\nopens in the Ising phase even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study other\ncriteria to characterize the transition, such as edge spin correlation with its\nneighbor $C(r=1)$, local susceptibility $\\chi_i$, superconducting order\nparameter of edge spin $P(r=1)$, and longitudinal structure factor $S(k)$. The\nground state degeneracy and three other criteria lead to the same critical\nvalue of parameters for Majorana-Ising phase transition in the thermodynamic\nlimit. We study, for the first time, the entanglement spectrum of the reduced\ndensity matrix of the helical liquid system. The system shows finite Schmidt\ngap and non-degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum in the Ising limit. The\nSchmidt gap closes in the Majorana state, and all the eigenvalues are either\ndoubly or multiply degenerate.\n", "  Single top quarks in the $t$ channel are produced though the electroweak\nforce and are therefore an excellent way to probe the electroweak sector of the\nstandard model with top quark physics. The recent cross section measurement of\nsingle top $t$-channel production from the CMS collaboration is presented in\nthis poster. The analyzed data was taken during the LHC Run II in 2015 at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $13\\,\\textrm{TeV}$. A multivariate classifier is used\nto distinguish signal and background processes and the cross section is then\nextracted using a binned maximum-likelihood fit.\n", "  The process of the triplet production on a free electron, $\\gamma e^-\\to\ne^+e^-e^-$, has been investigated as a reaction where a dark photon, $A'$, is\nproduced as a virtual state with subsequent decay into a $e^+e^-$-pair. This\neffect arises due to the so-called kinetic mixing and is characterized by the\nsmall parameter $\\epsilon$ describing the coupling strength relative to the\nelectric charge e.\n  The search of $A'$ in this process has advantage because the background to\nthe $A'$ signal is pure QED. This QED background is described by eight Feynman\ndiagrams taking into account the identity of final electrons. As concern $A'$,\nwe leave its contribution in Compton-like diagrams only since, in this case,\nthe virtual dark photon is time-like and its propagator has the Breit-Wigner\nform. So, near the resonance $A'$ can manifest itself. The contribution of $A'$\nin Borsellino diagrams is negligible since, in this case, the virtual dark\nphoton is space-like, the $A'$ propagator does not peak and effect is\nproportional at least to $\\epsilon^2$. We calculate the distributions over the\ninvariant masses of the both produced $e^+e^-$ pairs and search for the\nkinematical region where the Compton-like diagrams contribution is not\nsuppressed as compared with the Borsellino one. We estimate what value of the\nparameter $\\epsilon$, as a function of the dark photon mass, can be obtained at\ngiven number of the measured events.\n", "  The starting point of the present review is to acknowledge that there are\ninnumerable reports of non-seismic types of earthquake precursory phenomena\nthat are intermittent and seem not to occur systematically, while associated\nreports are not widely accepted by the geoscience community at large because no\none could explain their origins. We review a unifying theory for a solid-state\nmechanism, based on decades of research bridging semi-conductor physics,\nchemistry and rock physics. A synthesis has emerged that all pre-earthquake\nphenomena could trace back to one fundamental physical process: the activation\nof electronic charges (electrons and positive holes) in rocks subjected to\never-increasing tectonic stresses prior to any major seismic activity, via the\nrupture of peroxy bonds. In the second part of the review, we critically\nexamine satellite and ground station data, recorded before past large\nearthquakes, as they have been claimed to provide evidence that precursory\nsignals tend to become measurable days, sometimes weeks before the disasters.\nWe review some of the various phenomena that can be directly predicted by the\nperoxy defect theory , namely, radon gas emanations, corona discharges, thermal\ninfrared emissions, air ionization, ion and electron content in the ionosphere,\nand electro-magnetic anomalies. Our analysis demonstrates the need for further\nsystematic investigations, in particular with strong continuous statistical\ntesting of the relevance and confidence of the precursors. Only then, the\nscientific community will be able to assess and improve the performance of\nearthquake forecasts.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic states and spin polarization of\nhalf-metallic ferromagnet CrO$_2$ (100) epitaxial films by bulk-sensitive\nspin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a focus on non-quasiparticle\n(NQP) states derived from electron-magnon interactions. We found that the\naveraged values of the spin polarization are approximately 100% and 40% at 40 K\nand 300 K, respectively. This is consistent with the previously reported result\n[H. Fujiwara et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 106, 202404 (2015).]. At 100 K, peculiar\nspin depolarization was observed at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$), which is\nsupported by theoretical calculations predicting NQP states. This suggests the\npossible appearance of NQP states in CrO$_2$. We also compare the temperature\ndependence of our spin polarizations with that of the magnetization.\n", "  In this report, we demonstrate that the energy gap in Cr-doped Bi2Se3 closes\nand reopens in oscillatory fashion with increasing sample thickness indicating\nthe topological quantum phase transition driven by the quantum finite size\neffect. The pattern of the oscillation provides an evidence that Cr-doped\nBi2Se3 can have a Dirac semimetal state depending on the sample thickness and\nCr-content. This resolves the puzzle of non-magnetic gap opening at the Dirac\npoint of topological insulators. An energy gap can be opened due to the quantum\nfinite size confinement of the bands in Dirac semimetal state. In addition, our\nroom temperature ARPES measurements revealed a topological quantum phase\ntransition between x = 0.06 and x = 0.08 in 7 quintuple layers Bi2-xCrxSe3\nwithout ferromagnetism.\n", "  In the design of electromagnetic devices the accurate representation of the\ngeometry plays a crucial role in determining the device performance. For\naccelerator cavities, in particular, controlling the frequencies of the\neigenmodes is important in order to guarantee the synchronization between the\nelectromagnetic field and the accelerated particles. The main interest of this\nwork is in the evaluation of eigenmode sensitivities with respect to\ngeometrical changes using Monte Carlo simulations and stochastic collocation.\nThe choice of an IGA approach for the spatial discretization allows for an\nexact handling of the domains and their deformations, guaranteeing, at the same\ntime, accurate and highly regular solutions.\n", "  In preparation for the upcoming all-sky data releases of the Gaia mission, we\ncompiled a catalog of known hot subdwarf stars and candidates drawn from the\nliterature and yet unpublished databases. The catalog contains 5613 unique\nsources and provides multi-band photometry from the ultraviolet to the far\ninfrared, ground based proper motions, classifications based on spectroscopy\nand colors, published atmospheric parameters, radial velocities and light curve\nvariability information. Using several different techniques, we removed\noutliers and misclassified objects. By matching this catalog with astrometric\nand photometric data from the Gaia mission, we will develop selection criteria\nto construct a homogeneous, magnitude-limited all-sky catalog of hot subdwarf\nstars based on Gaia data. As first application of the catalog data, we present\nthe quantitative spectral analysis of 280 sdB and sdOB stars from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Combining our derived parameters with\nstate-of-the-art proper motions, we performed a full kinematic analysis of our\nsample. This allowed us to separate the first significantly large sample of 78\nsdBs and sdOBs belonging to the Galactic halo. Comparing the properties of hot\nsubdwarfs from the disk and the halo with hot subdwarf samples from the\nglobular clusters $\\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808, we found the fraction of\nintermediate He-sdOBs in the field halo population to be significantly smaller\nthan in the globular clusters.\n", "  For a system of Brownian particles interacting via a soft exponential\npotential we investigate the interaction between equilibrium crystallization\nand spatially varying shear flow. For thermodynamic state points within the\nliquid part of the phase diagram, but close to the crystallization phase\nboundary, we observe that imposing a Poiseuille flow can induce nonequilibrium\ncrystalline ordering in regions of low shear gradient. The physical mechanism\nresponsible for this phenomenon is shear induced particle migration, which\ncauses particles to drift preferentially towards the center of the flow\nchannel, thus increasing the local density in the channel center. The method\nemployed is classical dynamical density functional theory.\n", "  TOPCAT is a desktop application for interactive analysis of tabular data,\nespecially source catalogues. Along with its command-line counterpart STILTS,\nit has been under more or less continuous development for the past 15 years and\nis now widely used by astronomers from project students to research scientists.\nThis paper reviews its capabilities as a tool for working with large and small\ndatasets, and considers some of the issues in design, implementation and user\ninteraction that have to be tackled when developing software of this kind.\n", "  Methods for efficiently controlling dynamics propagated on networks are\nusually based on identifying the most influential nodes. Knowledge of these\nnodes can be used for the targeted control of dynamics such as epidemics, or\nfor modifying biochemical pathways relating to diseases. Similarly they are\nvaluable for identifying points of failure to increase network resilience in,\nfor example, social support networks and logistics networks. Many measures,\noften termed `centrality', have been constructed to achieve these aims. Here we\nconsider Katz centrality and provide a new interpretation as a steady-state\nsolution to continuous-time dynamics. This enables us to implement a\nsensitivity analysis which is similar to metabolic control analysis used in the\nanalysis of biochemical pathways. The results yield a centrality which\nquantifies, for each node, the net impact of its absence from the network. It\nalso has the desirable property of requiring a node with a high centrality to\nplay a central role in propagating the dynamics of the system by having the\ncapacity to both receive flux from others and then to pass it on. This new\nperspective on Katz centrality is important for a more comprehensive analysis\nof directed networks.\n", "  The available set of spin and shape modelled asteroids is strongly biased\nagainst slowly rotating targets and those with low lightcurve amplitudes. As a\nconsequence of these selection effects, the current picture of asteroid spin\naxis distribution, rotation rates, or radiometric properties, might be affected\ntoo.\n  To counteract these selection effects, we are running a photometric campaign\nof a large sample of main belt asteroids omitted in most previous studies. We\ndetermined synodic rotation periods and verified previous determinations. When\na dataset for a given target was sufficiently large and varied, we performed\nspin and shape modelling with two different methods.\n  We used the convex inversion method and the non-convex SAGE algorithm,\napplied on the same datasets of dense lightcurves. Unlike convex inversion, the\nSAGE method allows for the existence of valleys and indentations on the shapes\nbased only on lightcurves.\n  We obtained detailed spin and shape models for the first five targets of our\nsample: (159) Aemilia, (227) Philosophia, (329) Svea, (478) Tergeste, and (487)\nVenetia. When compared to stellar occultation chords, our models obtained an\nabsolute size scale and major topographic features of the shape models were\nalso confirmed. When applied to thermophysical modelling, they provided a very\ngood fit to the infrared data and allowed their size, albedo, and thermal\ninertia to be determined.\n  Convex and non-convex shape models provide comparable fits to lightcurves.\nHowever, some non-convex models fit notably better to stellar occultation\nchords and to infrared data in sophisticated thermophysical modelling (TPM). In\nsome cases TPM showed strong preference for one of the spin and shape\nsolutions. Also, we confirmed that slowly rotating asteroids tend to have\nhigher-than-average values of thermal inertia.\n", "  Two problems of the Standard Model, associated with the introduction of\nnon-gauge interactions and with the introduction of an electromagnetic field as\na linear combination of fields on which various gauge groups are implemented,\nare analyzed. It is noticed that the existing model contains $U\\left( 1\n\\right)-$ phase uncertainty of the matrix elements of the raising and lowering\ngenerators of the $SU\\left( 2 \\right)$ group. This uncertainty creates the\ncondition for the additional local $U\\left( 1 \\right)-$ symmetry of the\nStandard Model Lagrangian with respect to the choice of various equivalent\ngenerator representations of the $SU\\left( 2 \\right)$ group, which is provided\nby the electromagnetic field. In this case, due to the different action of the\nraising and lowering generators on the fields of each generation of leptons and\nquarks, these fields interact with the electromagnetic field in different ways.\nIt is also shown that considering the multi-particle gauge field a description\nof the Higgs mechanism can be obtained, free from the shortcomings of the\nwell-known single-particle description, the main of which is the introduction\nof the non-gauge \"phi-four\" interaction, that is not reduced to the fundamental\none. In the proposed model, the spontaneous symmetry breaking is achieved due\nto the same fundamental interaction, the mediating particle mass of which it\nprovides.\n", "  The recent starting of the gravitational wave (GW) astronomy with the events\nGW150914, GW151226, GW170104, and the very recent GW170814 and GW170817 seems\nto be fundamental not only in order to obtain new intriguing astrophysical\ninformation from our surrounding Universe, but also in order to discriminate\namong Einstein's general theory of relativity (GTR) and alternative\ngravitational theories. At the present time, despite the cited events, and in\nparticular the last ones, which are the events GW170814 and GW170817, have put\nvery strong constraint on the GTR, extended theories of gravity have not been\ncompletely ruled out. Here we discuss, in our knowledge for the first time in\nthe literature, GWs in the Rastall theory of gravity. In fact, the Rastall\ntheory recently obtained a renovated interest in the literature. We show that\nthere is a profound analogy between GWs in f(R) theories of gravity and GWs in\nthe Rastall theory. This will permit us to linearize the Rastall field\nequations and to find the corresponding GWs. We will also study the motion of\nthe test masses due to GWs in this theory which could help, in principle, to\ndiscriminate between the GTR, f(R) theories and the Rastall theory of gravity.\n", "  The present paper stress on the distinction between the two idealizations~--\neternal (primordial) black hole and a black hole formed in a process of\ngravitation collapse. Such a distinction is an essential condition for a better\nunderstanding of the relation between Unruh effect and Hawking effect. The\nfundamental character of the discussions inside requires a preferred\norientation to results of the local QFT in curved space-time.\n", "  The present work deals with holographic dark energy in the context of\nunimodular $f(T)$ gravity, which is a modification of teleparallel gravity. We\ndevelop the general reconstruction procedure of the $f(T)$ form that can yield\nthe holographic feature of the dark energy. We fit the reconstructed model with\nthe $H(z)$ data and our results show a perfect agreement with the WMAP9\ncosmological observational data, at least for the range $-1.10\\leq \\omega_V\n\\leq -1.05$. We investigate the consistency of the reconstructed model by\nstudying its stability against linear gravitational and matter perturbations,\nfixing $\\omega_V$ to $-1.05$. The model presents stability for both de Sitter\nand power-law solutions and we conclude that it is a good candidate as\nalternative viable model for characterizing holographic dark energy.\n", "  Purely organic materials with negative and near-zero dielectric permittivity\ncan be easily fabricated, and propagation of surface polaritons at the\nmaterial/air interface was demonstrated. Here we develop a mean-field theory of\nlight-induced optical properties of photonic organic materials taking the\ncollective effects into account. The theory describes both a red shift of the\nresonance frequency of isolated molecules, according to the Clausius-Mossotti\nLorentz-Lorentz mechanism, and the wide variations of their spectra related to\nthe aggregation of molecules into J- or H-aggregates. We show that the\nexperimental absorption spectra of H-aggregates may be correctly described only\nif one takes both mechanisms into account. The bistable response of organic\nmaterials in the condensed phase has been demonstrated using the\nelectron-vibrational model. We show that using molecules with long-living\ntriplet state T1 near excited singlet state S1, and fast intersystem crossing\nS1->T1 enables us to diminish CW light intensity needed for observing\nbistability below the damage threshold of thin organic films.\n", "  We numerically study quantum chaos properties of long-range XXZ dipolar\nHamiltonian spin systems. Two geometries are considered: (i) an open chain with\n19 spins, (ii) a face-centered cubic lattice with 14 spins. Energy\nlevel-spacing distribution indicates that the three-dimensional geometry is\nhighly chaotic, while the one-dimensional system is mildly chaotic for small\nchains, but has increasing chaoticity for larger chains. We also look at\nstatistical properties of energy eigenvectors, and of one- and two-body local\nobservables. Finally, we present some preliminary results on time-evolution,\nlocal spin dynamics and thermalization. Quantum chaos may have important\nimplications for \"scrambling\" of quantum information, in both condensed matter\nsystems and in astrophysical applications such as black holes.\n", "  We investigate the host galaxy and environment properties of a sample of 400\nlow z (<0.5) quasars that were imaged in the SDSS Stripe82. We can detect and\nstudy the properties of the host galaxy for more than 75% of the data sample.\nWe discover that quasar are mainly hosted in luminous galaxies of absolute\nmagnitude M* -3 < M(R) < M* and that in the quasar environments the galaxy\nnumber density is comparable to that of inactive galaxies of similar\nluminosities. For these quasars we undertake also a study in u,g,r,i and z SDSS\nbands and again we discover that the mean colours of the quasar host galaxy it\nis not very different with respect to the values of the sample of inactive\ngalaxies. For a subsample of low z sources the imaging study is complemented by\nspectroscopy of quasar hosts and of close companion galaxies. This study\nsuggests that the supply and cause of the nuclear activity depends only weakly\non the local environment of quasars. Contrary to past suggestions, for low\nredshift quasar there is a very modest connection between recent star formation\nand the nuclear activity.\n", "  By stacking PbTe layers there is a non-monotonic topological phase transition\nas a function of the number of monolayers. Based on first principles\ncalculations we find that the proper stacked crystal symmetry determines the\ntopological nature of the slab. While a single PbTe monolayer has a nontrivial\nphase, pressure can induce topological phase transition in bulk PbTe. Between\nthese two limits, where finite size effects are inherent, we verified that, by\napplying an external pressure, odd stacking layers can be tuned easily to a\ntopological phase, while even stacking keeps a larger band gap, avoiding band\ninversion. The quite distinct behavior for odd/even layer is due to the\nsymmetry of the finite stacking. Odd layers preserve the bulk symmorphic\nsymmetry with strong surface hybridization, while even layers belong to a\nnonsymmorphic group symmetry. Nonsymmorphism induces extra degeneracy reducing\nthe hybridization, thus protecting band inversion, postponing topological phase\ntransitions.\n", "  I give a brief review of some of the implications of Fermi data for theories\nof the identity of dark matter, and their combination with data from other\ncomplementary probes. I also preview some of the prospects for probing such\nmodels with future data.\n", "  In this contribution we briefly give an overview of the theoretical models\nused to describe experimental data from heavy-ion collisions from\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx $ 4 GeV to ultra-relativistic energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\n\\approx $ 5 TeV. We highlight the successes and problems of statistical or\nhadron-resonance gas models, address the results of macroscopic approaches like\nhydrodynamics (in different hybrid combinations) as well as the results from\nmicroscopic transport approaches in comparison to experimental data. Finally,\nthe transport coefficients like shear $\\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ -\nentering the macroscopic models - are confronted with results from lattice QCD\nin thermal equilibrium for vanishing chemical potential.\n", "  Radio astronomy observational facilities are under constant upgradation and\ndevelopment to achieve better capabilities including increasing the time and\nfrequency resolutions of the recorded data, and increasing the receiving and\nrecording bandwidth. As only a limited spectrum resource has been allocated to\nradio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in\nthe radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable\nradio frequency interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from\nterrestrial human activity and are becoming stronger with time. RFIs degrade\nthe quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The impact of RFIs\non scientific outcome is becoming progressively difficult to manage. In this\narticle, we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI\ncharacteristics, mitigation techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies\nadopted at some representative observatories, telescopes and arrays are also\nintroduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings of the four\nclasses of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal\nstages: preventive, pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The\nproper identification and flagging of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss\nand improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate goal of developing\nRFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving a\ncombination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high\nspeed digital signal processing and high performance computing allow for\nperforming RFI excision of large data volumes generated from large telescopes\nor arrays in both real time and offline modes, aiding the proposed strategy.\n", "  Using an information theoretic point of view, we investigate how a dynamics\nacting on a network can be coarse grained through the use of graph partitions.\nSpecifically, we are interested in how aggregating the state space of a Markov\nprocess according to a partition impacts on the thus obtained lower-dimensional\ndynamics. We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be\nmultiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable\nfeatures of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by\none partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics,\nwhile another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional\ndynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking\ninspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a\nconvenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a\ncoarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers\ncertain information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows\nacross time steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy\nrate, as well as a measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how\nwell the dynamics can be approximated by a first order Markov process. We use\nthe entrogram to investigate how specific macro-scale connection patterns in\nthe state-space transition graph of the original dynamics result in desirable\nproperties of coarse grained descriptions. We thereby provide a fresh\nperspective on the interplay between structure and dynamics in networks, and\nthe process of partitioning from an information theoretic perspective. We focus\non networks that may be approximated by both a core-periphery or a clustered\norganization, and highlight that each of these coarse grained descriptions can\ncapture different aspects of a Markov process acting on the network.\n", "  We present a regularized version of the color gradient lattice Boltzmann (LB)\nscheme for the simulation of droplet formation in microfluidic devices of\nexperimental relevance. The regularized version is shown to provide\ncomputationally efficient access to Capillary number regimes relevant to\ndroplet generation via microfluidic devices, such as flow-focusers and the more\nrecent microfluidic step emulsifier devices.\n", "  A grand challenge of the 21st century cosmology is to accurately estimate the\ncosmological parameters of our Universe. A major approach to estimating the\ncosmological parameters is to use the large-scale matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Galaxy surveys provide the means to map out cosmic large-scale\nstructure in three dimensions. Information about galaxy locations is typically\nsummarized in a \"single\" function of scale, such as the galaxy correlation\nfunction or power-spectrum. We show that it is possible to estimate these\ncosmological parameters directly from the distribution of matter. This paper\npresents the application of deep 3D convolutional networks to volumetric\nrepresentation of dark-matter simulations as well as the results obtained using\na recently proposed distribution regression framework, showing that machine\nlearning techniques are comparable to, and can sometimes outperform,\nmaximum-likelihood point estimates using \"cosmological models\". This opens the\nway to estimating the parameters of our Universe with higher accuracy.\n", "  A central task in the field of quantum computing is to find applications\nwhere quantum computer could provide exponential speedup over any classical\ncomputer. Machine learning represents an important field with broad\napplications where quantum computer may offer significant speedup. Several\nquantum algorithms for discriminative machine learning have been found based on\nefficient solving of linear algebraic problems, with potential exponential\nspeedup in runtime under the assumption of effective input from a quantum\nrandom access memory. In machine learning, generative models represent another\nlarge class which is widely used for both supervised and unsupervised learning.\nHere, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm for machine learning based on a\nquantum generative model. We prove that our proposed model is exponentially\nmore powerful to represent probability distributions compared with classical\ngenerative models and has exponential speedup in training and inference at\nleast for some instances under a reasonable assumption in computational\ncomplexity theory. Our result opens a new direction for quantum machine\nlearning and offers a remarkable example in which a quantum algorithm shows\nexponential improvement over any classical algorithm in an important\napplication field.\n", "  This is the reply to [arXiv:1711.00764], in which the authors claim that\nthere is crucial normalization error in PRL 116, 040502 (2016) and that some\nquantities appearing in the method of PRL 116, 040502 (2016) are not\nexperimentally measurable. We show that the claim of [arXiv:1711.00764] is not\ncorrect and that the quantities appearing in PRL 116, 040502 (2016) can be\nmeasured.\n", "  Recent observations of the magnetic field in pre-main sequence stars suggest\nthat the magnetic field topology changes as a function of age. The presence of\na tachocline could be an important factor in the development of magnetic field\nwith higher multipolar modes. In this work we performed MHD simulations using\nthe EULAG-MHD code to study the magnetic field generation and evolution in\nmodels that mimic stars at two evolutionary stages. The stratification for both\nstellar phases was computed by fitting stellar structure profiles obtained with\nthe ATON stellar evolution code. The first stage is at $1.1 \\mathrm{Myr}$, when\nthe star is completely convective. The second stage is at $14 \\mathrm{Myrs}$,\nwhen the star is partly convective, with a radiative core developed up to\n$30\\%$ of the stellar radius. In this proceedings we present a preliminary\nanalysis of the resulting mean-flows and magnetic field. The mean-flow analysis\nshown that the star rotate almost rigidly on the fully convective phase,\nwhereas at the partially convective phase there is differential rotation with\nconical contours of iso-rotation. As for the mean magnetic field both\nsimulations show similarities with respect to the field evolution. However, the\ntopology of the magnetic field is different.\n", "  We characterize the response of a parametric nonlinear optical circulator to\nrealistic signals that have finite bandwidths. Our results show that\nintermodulation distortion (IMD), rather than pump depletion or compression,\nlimits the maximal operating signal power and the dynamic range of nonlinear\nparametric circulators. This limitation holds even in the undepleted pump\nregime where nonlinear circulators are not constrained by dynamic reciprocity.\nWith a realistic pump power, noise floor, and nonlinear waveguide, our\nnumerical modeling demonstrates a maximally achievable spur-free dynamic range\n(SFDR) of 81 dB.\n", "  We investigate the linear statistics of random matrices with purely imaginary\nBernoulli entries of the form $H_{pq} = \\overline{H}_{qp} = \\pm i$, that are\neither independently distributed or exhibit global correlations imposed by the\ncondition $\\sum_{q} H_{pq} = 0$. These are related to ensembles of so-called\nrandom tournaments and random regular tournaments respectively. Specifically,\nwe construct a random walk within the space of matrices and show that the\ninduced motion of the first $k$ traces in a Chebyshev basis converges to a\nsuitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Coupling this with Stein's method allows\nus to compute the rate of convergence to a Gaussian distribution in the limit\nof large matrix dimension.\n", "  In this paper, we study the effect of both an external and crystal magnetic\nfields for a superlattice with mixed spins (1/2, 1), using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The ground state phase diagrams, in the external magnetic field,\ncoupling constant and the crystal magnetic field planes, were established. The\neffect of increasing temperatures has also been established showing the\nbehavior of the magnetizations and susceptibilities, for fixed crystal field\nvalues. In particular, the obtained results as well as in the ground state\nphase diagrams, as for non null temperature are obtained for fixed external\nmagnetic and crystal field values. On the other hand, the effect of the\ntemperature on the hysteresis loops is presented showing that the decreasing\ntemperature effect is to increase the absolute values of the corresponding\ncoercitif magnetic field.\n", "  We talk about the right way to order amplitudes in a wavefunction, and the\nright way to interpret operator matrices in quantum computation.\n"]}
