We focus on the two experimentally observed\nphases, blue phase I and blue phase II. The disinclination network of blue\nphase II continuously breaks and reforms under shear, leading to an oscillatory\nstress response in time. The oscillations are only regular for very thin\nsamples. For thicker samples, the shear leads to a \"stick-slip\" motion of part\nof the network along the vorticity direction. Blue phase I responds very\ndifferently: its defect network undergoes seemingly chaotic rearrangements\nunder shear, irrespective of system size.\n", "  The present work aims to search for an implementation of a new symmetry in\nthe space-time by introducing the idea of an invariant minimum speed scale\n($V$). Such a lowest limit $V$, being unattainable by the particles, represents\na fundamental and preferred reference frame connected to a universal background\nfield (a vacuum energy) that breaks Lorentz symmetry. So there emerges a new\nprinciple of symmetry in the space-time at the subatomic level for very low\nenergies close to the background frame ($v\\approx V$), providing a fundamental\nunderstanding for the uncertainty principle, i.e., the uncertainty relations\nshould emerge from the space-time with an invariant minimum speed.\n", "  We report on the formation of lobe-lobe (bi-lobed) Au-Ge nanostructures under\nultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions (\\approx 3\\times 10^{-10} mbar) on clean\nSi(100) surfaces. For this study, \\approx 2.0 nm thick Au samples were grown on\nthe substrate surface by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Thermal annealing was\ncarried out inside the UHV chamber at temperature \\apprx 500{\\deg}C and\nfollowing this, nearly square shaped Au_{x}Si_{1-x} nano structures of average\nlength \\approx 48 nm were formed. A \\approx 2 nm Ge film was further deposited\non the above surface while the substrate was kept at a temperature of \\approx\n500{\\deg}C. Well ordered Au-Ge nanostructures where Au and Ge residing side by\nside (lobe-lobe structures) were formed. In our systematic studies, we show\nthat, gold-silicide nanoalloy formation at the substrate (Si) surface is\nnecessary for forming phase separated Au-Ge bilobed nanostructures. Electron\nmicroscopy (TEM, STEM-EDS, SEM) studies were carried out to determine the\nstructure of Au - Ge nano systems. Rutherford backscattering Spectrometry\nmeasurements show gold inter-diffusion into substrate while it is absent for\nGe.\n", "  Real time electron microscopy observation on morphological changes in gold\nnano structures deposited on Si (100) surfaces as a function of annealing\ntemperatures has been reported. Two types of interfaces with the substrate\nsilicon were used prior to gold thin film deposition: (i) without native oxide\nand on ultra-clean reconstructed Si surfaces and (ii) with native oxide covered\nSi surfaces. For a \\approx 2.0 nm thick Au films deposited on reconstructed\nSi(100) surfaces using molecular beam epitaxy method under ultra high vacuum\nconditions, aligned four-fold symmetric nanogold silicide structures formed at\nrelatively lower temperatures (compared with the one with native oxide at the\ninterface). For this system, 82% of the nanostructures were found to be nano\nrectangles like structures with an average length \\approx 27 nm and aspect\nratio of 1.13 at \\approx 700{\\deg}C. For \\approx 5.0 nm thick Au films\ndeposited on Si (100) surface with native oxide at the interface, formation of\nrectangular structures were observed at higher temperatures (\\approx 850{\\deg}\nC). At these high temperatures, desorption of the gold silicide followed the\nsymmetry of the substrate. Native oxide at the interface was found to act like\na barrier for the inter-diffusion phenomena. Structural characterization was\ncarried out using advanced electron microscopy methods.\n", "  We report on the formation of oriented gold nano structures on Si(100)\nsubstrate by annealing procedures in low vacuum (\\approx10-2 mbar) and at high\ntemperature (\\approx 975^{\\circ} C). Various thicknesses of gold films have\nbeen deposited with SiOx (using high vacuum thermal evaporation) and without\nSiOx (using molecular beam epitaxy) at the interface on Si(100). Electron\nmicroscopy measurements were performed to determine the morphology, orientation\nof the structures and the nature of oxide layer. Interfacial oxide layer, low\nvacuum and high temperature annealing conditions are found to be necessary to\ngrow oriented gold structures. These gold structures can be transferred by\nsimple scratching method.\n", "  Using a recent parametrization of the fully antisymmetric three-nucleon wave\nfunction, based on the Paris and CD-Bonn potentials, we analyze the momentum\ndistributions of constituents in 3He, as well as the spin-dependent observables\nfor (3He,d) and (3He,p) breakup reactions. Special attention is paid to the\nregion of small relative momenta of the 3He constituents, where the single\nparameter, D_2, has determining role for the spin-dependent observables in the\nd+p channel. This fact results in some useful relations between experimental\nobservables.\n", "  From an extended relativistic dynamics for a particle moving in a cosmic\nbackground field with temperature T, we aim to obtain the speed of light with\nan explicit dependence on the background temperature of the universe. Although\nfinding the speed of light in the early universe much larger than its current\nvalue, our approach does not violate the postulate of special relativity.\nMoreover, it is shown that the high value of the speed of light in the early\nuniverse was drastically decreased before the beginning of the inflationary\nperiod. So we are led to conclude that the theory of varying speed of light\nshould be questioned as a possible solution of the horizon problem.\n", "  We report on the gold assisted epitaxial growth of Ge nanostructures under\nultra high vacuum (UHV) conditions (\\approx3\\times 10-10 mbar) on clean Ge\n(100) surfaces. For this study, \\approx2.0 nm thick Au samples were grown on\nthe substrate surface by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Thermal annealing was\ncarried out inside the UHV chamber at temperature \\approx500{\\deg}C and\nfollowing this, well ordered gold nanostructures placed on pedestal Ge were\nformed. A \\approx 2 nm Ge film was further deposited on the above surface while\nthe substrate was kept at a temperature of \\approx 500{\\deg}C. The height of\nthe Ge (pedestal) underneath gold increased along with the formation of small\nGe islands. The effect of substrate temperature and role of gold on the\nformation of above structures has been discussed in detail. Electron microscopy\n(TEM, SEM) studies were carried out to determine the structure of Au - Ge nano\nsystems.\n", "  Identifying the loss mechanisms of niobium cavities enables an accurate\ndetermination of applications for future accelerator projects and points to\nresearch topics required to mitigate current limitations. For several cavities\nan increasing surface resistance above a threshold field, saturating at higher\nfield has been observed. Measurements on samples give evidence that this effect\nis caused by the surface electric field. The measured temperature and frequency\ndependence is consistent with a model that accounts for these losses by\ninterface tunnel exchange between localized states in oxides formed along grain\nboundaries and the adjacent superconductor.\n", "  Motivated by successful classical models for noise reduction, we suggest a\nquantum technique for filtering noise out of quantum states. The purpose of\nthis paper is twofold: presenting a simple construction of quantum\ncross-correlations between two wave-functions, and presenting a scheme for a\nquantum noise filtering. We follow a well-known scheme in classical\ncommunication theory that attenuates random noise, and show that one can build\na quantum analog by using non-trace-preserving operators. By this we introduce\na classically motivated signal processing scheme to quantum information theory,\nwhich can help reducing quantum noise, and particularly, phase flip noise.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the phenomena of number squeezing and\nfragmentation for a repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a three\ndimensional double well potential over a range of interaction strengths and\nbarrier heights, including geometries that exhibit appreciable overlap in the\none-body wavefunctions localized in the left and right wells. We compute the\nproperties of the condensate with numerically exact, full dimensional path\nintegral ground state (PIGS) Quantum Monte Carlo simulations and compare with\nresults obtained from using two- and eight-mode truncated basis models. The\ntruncated basis models are found to agree with the numerically exact PIGS\nsimulations for weak interactions, but fail to correctly predict the amount of\nnumber squeezing and fragmentation exhibited by the PIGS simulations for strong\ninteractions. We find that both number squeezing and fragmentation of the BEC\nshow non-monotonic behavior at large values of interaction strength a. The\nnumber squeezing shows a universal scaling with the product of number of\nparticles and interaction strength (Na) but no such universal behavior is found\nfor fragmentation. Detailed analysis shows that the introduction of repulsive\ninteractions not only suppresses number fluctuations to enhance number\nsqueezing, but can also enhance delocalization across wells and tunneling\nbetween wells, each of which may suppress number squeezing. This results in a\ndynamical competition whose resolution shows a complex dependence on all three\nphysical parameters defining the system: interaction strength, number of\nparticles, and barrier height.\n", "  We present path integral ground state (PIGS) quantum Monte Carlo calculations\nfor the ground state ($T = 0$) properties of repulsively interacting bosons in\na three-dimensional external double well potential over a range of interaction\nstrengths and potential parameters. We focus our calculations on ground state\nnumber statistics and the one-body density matrix in order to understand the\nlevel of squeezing and fragmentation that the system exhibits as a function of\ninteraction strength. We compare our PIGS results to both a two-mode model and\na recently-proposed eight-mode model. For weak interactions, the various models\nagree with the numerically exact PIGS simulations. However, the models fail to\ncorrectly predict the amount of squeezing and fragmentation exhibited by the\nPIGS simulations for strong interactions. One novel and somewhat surprising\nresult from our simulations involves the relationship between squeezing and\ninteraction strength: rather than a monotonic relationship between these\nquantities, we find that for certain barrier heights the squeezing increases as\na function of interaction strength until it reaches a maximum, after which it\ndecreases again. We also see a similar relationship between fragmentation and\ninteraction strength. We discuss the physical mechanisms that account for this\nbehavior and the implications for the design of atom interferometers, which can\nuse squeezed states to reduce measurement uncertainty.\n", "  The cosmological consequences of an interacting model in which vacuum decay\nlaw is deducted from the effect that vacuum decay has on the dark matter\nevolution are investigated. Here, the baryonic matter is also considered as a\nfluid gravitationally coupled with dark matter. It is made a careful analysis\nto constrain this model with the observational data of growth rate of cosmic\nstructures. The theoretical growth rate is followed since the primordial\nrecombination and the main physical processes on the baryonic component are\nconsidered. As a complementary constraint, this model is compared with the\nobserved CMB-BAO ratio as well with the gas mass fraction of cluster of\ngalaxies. We found the best fit values for dark matter $\\Omega_{d0} = 0.269\n^{+0.023}_{-0.023}$ and for the decay parameter $\\epsilon = 0.02\n^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$.\n", "  Generating functionals may guide the evolution of a dynamical system and\nconstitute a possible route for handling the complexity of neural networks as\nrelevant for computational intelligence. We propose and explore a new objective\nfunction, which allows to obtain plasticity rules for the afferent synaptic\nweights. The adaption rules are Hebbian, self-limiting, and result from the\nminimization of the Fisher information with respect to the synaptic flux. We\nperform a series of simulations examining the behavior of the new learning\nrules in various circumstances. The vector of synaptic weights aligns with the\nprincipal direction of input activities, whenever one is present. A linear\ndiscrimination is performed when there are two or more principal directions;\ndirections having bimodal firing-rate distributions, being characterized by a\nnegative excess kurtosis, are preferred. We find robust performance and full\nhomeostatic adaption of the synaptic weights results as a by-product of the\nsynaptic flux minimization. This self-limiting behavior allows for stable\nonline learning for arbitrary durations. The neuron acquires new information\nwhen the statistics of input activities is changed at a certain point of the\nsimulation, showing however, a distinct resilience to unlearn previously\nacquired knowledge. Learning is fast when starting with randomly drawn synaptic\nweights and substantially slower when the synaptic weights are already fully\nadapted.\n", "  The phase shift analysis for determination of the 2S1/2 resonance at 1.5 MeV\nwas carried out on the basis of the known experimental measurements of the\nexcitation functions of the p14C elastic scattering at four angles from 90 to\n165 grad. and more than 100 energy values in the range from 600-800 to\n2200-2400 keV. The obtained shape of the resonance 2S1/2 phase shift coincides\nwith the characteristics of the corresponding level of 15N in whole, and the\nsuggested potential acceptably describe this scattering phase shift.\n", "  The novel concept of quantum logical entropy is presented and analyzed. We\nprove several basic properties of this entropy with regard to density matrices.\nWe hereby motivate a different approach for the assignment of quantum entropy\nto density matrices.\n", "  We prove a new version of the Holevo bound employing the Hilbert-Schmidt norm\ninstead of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Suppose Alice is sending classical\ninformation to Bob using a quantum channel, while Bob is performing some\nprojective measurement. We bound the classical mutual information in terms of\nthe Hilbert-Schmidt norm by its quantum Hilbert-Schmidt counterpart. This\nconstitutes a Holevo-type upper bound on the classical information transmission\nrate via a quantum channel. The resulting inequality is rather natural and\nintuitive relating classical and quantum expressions using the same measure.\n", "  We study the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model on the $n$-vertex complete\ngraph known as the mean-field (Curie-Weiss) model. We analyze the Swendsen-Wang\nalgorithm which is a Markov chain that utilizes the random cluster\nrepresentation for the ferromagnetic Potts model to recolor large sets of\nvertices in one step and potentially overcomes obstacles that inhibit\nsingle-site Glauber dynamics. Long et al. studied the case $q=2$, the\nSwendsen-Wang algorithm for the mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model, and\nshowed that the mixing time satisfies: (i) $\\Theta(1)$ for $\\beta<\\beta_c$,\n(ii) $\\Theta(n^{1/4})$ for $\\beta=\\beta_c$, (iii) $\\Theta(\\log n)$ for\n$\\beta>\\beta_c$, where $\\beta_c$ is the critical temperature for the\nordered/disordered phase transition. In contrast, for $q\\geq 3$ there are two\ncritical temperatures $0<\\beta_u<\\beta_{rc}$ that are relevant. We prove that\nthe mixing time of the Swendsen-Wang algorithm for the ferromagnetic Potts\nmodel on the $n$-vertex complete graph satisfies: (i) $\\Theta(1)$ for\n$\\beta<\\beta_u$, (ii) $\\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\\beta=\\beta_u$, (iii)\n$\\exp(n^{\\Omega(1)})$ for $\\beta_u<\\beta<\\beta_{rc}$, and (iv)\n$\\Theta(\\log{n})$ for $\\beta\\geq\\beta_{rc}$. These results complement refined\nresults of Cuff et al. on the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics for the\nferromagnetic Potts model.\n", "  We propose a heuristic unification of dark matter and dark energy in terms of\na single dark fluid with a logotropic equation of state $P=A\\ln(\\rho/\\rho_P)$,\nwhere $\\rho$ is the rest-mass density, $\\rho_P$ is the Planck density, and $A$\nis the logotropic temperature. The energy density $\\epsilon$ is the sum of a\nrest-mass energy term $\\rho c^2$ mimicking dark matter and an internal energy\nterm $u(\\rho)=-P(\\rho)-A$ mimicking dark energy. The logotropic temperature is\napproximately given by $A \\simeq\n\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2/\\ln(\\rho_P/\\rho_{\\Lambda})\\simeq\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2/[123\n\\ln(10)]$, where $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the cosmological density. More precisely,\nwe obtain $A=2.13\\times 10^{-9} \\, {\\rm g}\\, {\\rm m}^{-1}\\, {\\rm s}^{-2}$ that\nwe interpret as a fundamental constant. At the cosmological scale, this model\nfullfills the same observational constraints as the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nHowever, it has a nonzero velocity of sound and a nonzero Jeans length which,\nat the beginning of the matter era, is about $\\lambda_J=40.4\\, {\\rm pc}$, in\nagreement with the minimum size of the dark matter halos observed in the\nuniverse. At the galactic scale, the logotropic pressure balances gravitational\nattraction and solves the cusp problem and the missing satellite problem. The\nlogotropic equation of state generates a universal rotation curve that agrees\nwith the empirical Burkert profile of dark matter halos up to the halo radius.\nIn addition, it implies that all the dark matter halos have the same surface\ndensity $\\Sigma_0=\\rho_0 r_h=141\\, M_{\\odot}/{\\rm pc}^2$ and that the mass of\ndwarf galaxies enclosed within a sphere of fixed radius $r_{u}=300\\, {\\rm pc}$\nhas the same value $M_{300}=1.93\\times 10^{7}\\, M_{\\odot}$, in remarkable\nagreement with the observations.\n", "  In this paper we perform a novel analysis of quantum Gaussian channels in the\ncontext of weak measurements. Suppose Alice sends classical information to Bob\nusing a quantum channel. Suppose Bob is allowed to use only weak measurements,\nwhat would be the channel capacity? We formulate weak measurement theory in\nthese terms and discuss the above question.\n", "  Within the framework of the modified potential cluster model with the\nforbidden states and the classification of states according to Young tableaux\nthe possibility of describing the available experimental data for the total\nreaction cross sections of the neutron radiative capture on 10Be at thermal and\nastrophysical energies was shown.\n", "  The kinetic origin of resonance phenomena in capacitively coupled radio\nfrequency plasmas is discovered based on particle-based numerical simulations.\nThe analysis of the spatio-temporal distributions of plasma parameters such as\nthe densities of hot and cold electrons, as well as the conduction and\ndisplacement currents reveals the mechanism of the formation of multiple\nelectron beams during sheath expansion. The interplay between highly energetic\nbeam electrons and low energetic bulk electrons is identified as the physical\norigin of the excitation of harmonics in the current.\n", "  In this work we report on kinetic Monte-Carlo calculations of resistive\nswitching and the underlying growth dynamics of filaments in an electrochemical\nmetallization device consisting of an Ag/TiO2/Pt sandwich-like thin film\nsystem. The developed model is not limited to i) fast time scale dynamics and\nii) only one growth and dissolution cycle of metallic filaments. In particular,\nwe present results from the simulation of consecutive cycles. We find that the\nnumerical results are in excellent agreement with experimentally obtained data.\nAdditionally, we observe an unexpected filament growth mode which is in\ncontradiction to the widely acknowledged picture of filament growth, but\nconsistent with recent experimental findings.\n", "  We prove the limiting absorption principle and discuss the continuity\nproperties of the boundary values of the resolvent for a class of form bounded\nperturbations of the Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta$ that covers both short and\nlong range potentials with an essentially optimal behaviour at infinity.\n", "  We discuss in this chapter the basics of adiabatic computation, as well as\nsome physical implementations. After a short introduction of the quantum\ncircuit model, we describe quantum adiabatic computation, quantum annealing,\nand the strong relations between the three. We conclude with a brief\npresentation of the D-Wave computer and some future challenges.\n", "  In this work we show the application of Sailfish to the study of fluid\ndynamics in porous media. Sailfish is an open-source software based on the\nlattice-Boltzmann method. This application of computational fluid dynamics is\nof particular interest to the oil and gas industry and the subject could be a\nstarting point for an undergraduate or graduate student in physics or\nengineering. We built artificial samples of porous media with different\nporosities and used Sailfish to simulate the fluid flow through in order to\ncalculate permeability and tortuosity. We also present a simple way to obtain\nthe specific superficial area of porous media using Python libraries. To\ncontextualize these concepts, we test the Kozeny--Carman equation, discuss its\nvalidity and calculate the Kozeny's constant for our artificial samples.\n", "  Non-stationary null dust in a spherically symmetric spacetime is studied in\nthe context of a general-covariant Horava-Lifshitz theory. The non-minimal\ncoupling to matter is considered in the infrared limit. The aim of this paper\nis to study whether the collapse of a null dust-like fluid can be a solution of\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in the infrared limit. We have shown that the unique\npossible solution is static. This solution represents a Minkowski spacetime\nsince the energy density is null.\n", "  We discuss possibilities of measuring CP violation in the Two-Higgs-Doublet\nModel by studying effects of one-loop generated $ZZZ$ and $ZWW$ vertices. We\ndiscuss a set of CP-sensitive asymmetries for $ZZ$ and $W^+W^-$ production at\nlinear $e^+e^-$-colliders, that directly depends on the weak-basis invariant Im\n$J_2$ that parametrises the strength of CP violation. Given the restrictions on\nthis model that follow from the LHC measurements, the predicted effects are\nsmall. Pursuing such measurements is however very important, as an observed\nsignal might point to a richer scalar sector.\n", "  Recent research has community have shown that tropical convection and\nrainfall is sensitive to mid-tropospheric humidity. Therefore it has been\nsuggested to improve the representation of moist convection by making cumulus\nparameterizations more sensitive to mid-tropospheric moisture. Climate models\nshow considerable rainfall biases in coastal tropical areas, where approx. 33 %\nof the overall rainfall received is associated with coastal land-sea\ninteraction. Building on an algorithm to objectively identify rainfall that is\nassociated with land-sea interaction we investigate whether the relationship\nbetween rainfall in coastal regions and atmospheric humidity differs from that\nover the open ocean or over inland areas. We combine 3-hourly satellite\nestimates of rainfall with humidity estimates from reanalyses and investigate\nif coastal rainfall reveals the well known relationship between area-averaged\nprecipitation and column integrated moisture. We find that rainfall that is\nassociated with coastal land-sea effects occurs under much drier\nmid-tropospheric conditions than that over the ocean and doesn't exhibit a\npronounced critical value of humidity. In addition, the dependence of the\namount of rainfall on mid-tropospheric moisture is significantly weaker when\nthe rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings indicate that the\nrepresentation of convection in weather and climate models must cater for the\nspecial character near coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across\nthe globe.\n", "  We show that effective field theory techniques can be efficiently used to\ncompute power corrections to the hard thermal loops (HTL) in a high temperature\nT expansion. To this aim, we use the recently proposed on-shell effective field\ntheory (OSEFT), which describes the quantum fluctuations around on-shell\ndegrees of freedom. We provide the OSEFT Lagrangian up to third order in the\nenergy expansion for QED, and use it for the computation of power corrections\nto the retarded photon polarization tensor for soft external momenta. Here soft\ndenotes a scale of order $eT$, where $e$ is the gauge coupling constant. We\ndevelop the necessary techniques to perform these computations, and study the\ncontributions to the polarization tensor proportional to $e^2 T^2$, $e^2 T$ and\n$e^2 T^0$. The first one describes the HTL contribution, the second one\nvanishes, while the third one provides corrections of order $e^2$ to the soft\nphoton propagation. We check that the results agree with the direct calculation\nfrom QED, up to local pieces, as expected in an effective field theory.\n", "  We study the collapse of a self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate with\nattractive self-interaction. Equilibrium states in which the gravitational\nattraction and the attraction due to the self-interaction are counterbalanced\nby the quantum pressure exist only below a maximum mass $M_{\\rm\nmax}=1.012\\hbar/\\sqrt{Gm|a_s|}$ where $a_s<0$ is the scattering length of the\nbosons and $m$ is their mass. For $M>M_{\\rm max}$ the system is expected to\ncollapse and form a black hole. We study the collapse dynamics by making a\nGaussian ansatz for the wave function. We find that the collapse time scales as\n$(M/M_{\\rm max}-1)^{-1/4}$ for $M\\rightarrow M_{\\rm max}^+$ and as $M^{-1/2}$\nfor $M\\gg M_{\\rm max}$. We apply our results to standard axions with mass\n$m=10^{-4}\\, {\\rm eV}/c^2$ and scattering length $a_s=-5.8\\times 10^{-53}\\,\n{\\rm m}$ for which $M_{\\rm max}=6.5\\times 10^{-14}M_{\\odot}$ and $R=3.3\\times\n10^{-4}\\, R_{\\odot}$. We confirm our previous claim that bosons with attractive\nself-interaction, such as standard axions, may form low mass stars but cannot\nform dark matter halos of relevant mass and size. These mini axions stars could\nbe the constituents of dark matter. They can collapse into mini black holes of\nmass $\\sim 10^{-14}\\, M_{\\odot}$ in a few hours. In that case, dark matter\nhalos would be made of mini black holes. We also apply our results to\nultralight axions with mass $m=1.93\\times 10^{-20}\\, {\\rm eV}/c^2$ and\nscattering length $a_s=-8.29\\times 10^{-60}\\, {\\rm fm}$ for which $M_{\\rm\nmax}=0.39\\times 10^6\\, M_{\\odot}$ and $R=33\\, {\\rm pc}$. These ultralight\naxions could cluster into dark matter halos. Axionic dark matter halos with\nattractive self-interaction can collapse into supermassive black holes of mass\n$\\sim 10^{6}\\, M_{\\odot}$ in about one million years.\n", "  The x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), developed in these last 40\nyears using synchrotron radiation, is a unique tool probing electronic\ncorrelations in complex systems via quantum many body final state effects.\nMulti electron excitations have been observed first in the sixties in x-ray\nabsorption spectra of atoms and later in molecules and solids. The applications\nof XANES many body final states to probe unique features of electronic\ncorrelation in heavy fermions, mixed valence systems, mixed valence oxides and\nhigh temperature superconductors are discussed.\n", "  We develop a hydrodynamic representation of the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Einstein\nequations. These equations combine quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and\ngeneral relativity. We consider the case of an arbitrary curved spacetime, the\ncase of weak gravitational fields in a static or expanding background, and the\nnonrelativistic (Newtonian) limit. The Klein-Gordon-Maxwell-Einstein equations\ngovern the evolution of a complex scalar field, possibly describing\nself-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates, coupled to an electromagnetic\nfield. They may find applications in the context of dark matter, boson stars,\nand neutron stars with a superfluid core.\n", "  The level of solar modulation at different times (related to the solar\nactivity) is a central question of solar and galactic cosmic-ray physics. In\nthe first paper of this series, we have established a correspondence between\nthe uncertainties on ground-based detectors count rates and the parameter\n$\\phi$ (modulation level in the force-field approximation) reconstructed from\nthese count rates. In this second paper, we detail a procedure to obtain a\nreference $\\phi$ time series from neutron monitor data. We show that we can\nhave an unbiased and accurate $\\phi$ reconstruction ($\\Delta\\phi/\\phi\\simeq\n10\\%$). We also discuss the potential of Bonner spheres spectrometers and muon\ndetectors to provide $\\phi$ time series. Two by-products of this calculation\nare updated $\\phi$ values for the cosmic-ray database and a web interface to\nretrieve and plot $\\phi$ from the 50's to today\n(\\url{http://lpsc.in2p3.fr/crdb}).\n", "  Analysis of nanoscale liquids, including wetting and flow phenomena, is a\nscientific challenge with far reaching implications for industrial\ntechnologies. We report the conception, development, and application of an\nintegrated platform for the experimental characterization of liquids at the\nnanometer scale. The platform combines the sensing functionalities of an\nintegrated, two-dimensional electronic device array with in situ application of\nhighly sensitive optical micro-spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We\ndemonstrate the performance capabilities of the platform with an embodiment\nbased on an array of integrated, optically transparent graphene sensors. The\napplication of electronic and optical sensing in the platform allows for\ndifferentiating between liquids electronically, for determining a liquid's\nmolecular fingerprint, and for monitoring surface wetting dynamics in real\ntime. In order to explore the platform's sensitivity limits, we record\ntopographies and optical spectra of individual, spatially isolated sessile oil\nemulsion droplets having volumes of less than ten attoliters. The results\ndemonstrate that integrated measurement functionalities based on\ntwo-dimensional materials have the potential to push lab-on-chip based analysis\nfrom the microscale to the nanoscale.\n", "  The paper provides a tutorial to the conceptual layout of a self-consistently\ncoupled Particle-In-Cell/Test-Particle model for the kinetic simulation of\nsputtering transport in capacitively coupled plasmas at low gas pressures. It\nexplains when a kinetic approach is actually needed and which numerical\nconcepts allow for the inherent nonequilibrium behavior of the charged and\nneutral particles. At the example of a generic sputtering discharge both the\nfundamentals of the applied Monte Carlo methods as well as the conceptual\ndetails in the context of the sputtering scenario are elaborated on. Finally,\ntwo in the context of sputtering transport simulations often exploited\nassumptions, namely on the energy distribution of impinging ions as well as on\nthe test particle approach, are validated for the proposed example discharge.\n", "  We develop a quasilinear theory of the Vlasov equation in order to describe\nthe approach of systems with long-range interactions to quasi-stationary\nstates. We derive a diffusion equation governing the evolution of the velocity\ndistribution of the system towards a steady state. This steady state is\nexpected to correspond to the angle-averaged quasi-stationary distribution\nfunction reached by the Vlasov equation as a result of a violent relaxation. We\ncompare the prediction of the quasilinear theory to direct numerical\nsimulations of the Hamiltonian Mean Field model, starting from an unstable\nspatially homogeneous distribution, either Gaussian or semi-elliptical. We find\nthat the quasilinear theory works reasonably well for weakly unstable initial\nconditions and that it is able to predict the energy marking the\nout-of-equilibrium phase transition between unmagnetized and magnetized\nquasi-stationary states. At energies lower than the out-of-equilibrium\ntransition the quasilinear theory works less well, the disagreement with the\nnumerical simulations increasing by decreasing the energy. In that case, we\nobserve, in agreement with our previous numerical study [A. Campa and P.-H.\nChavanis, Eur. Phys. J. B 86, 170 (2013)], that the quasi-stationary states are\nremarkably well fitted by polytropic distributions (Tsallis distributions) with\nindex $n=2$ (Gaussian case) or $n=1$ (semi-elliptical case). In particular,\nthese polytropic distributions are able to account for the region of negative\nspecific heats in the out-of-equilibrium caloric curve, unlike the Boltzmann\nand Lynden-Bell distributions.\n", "  Wettability is the affinity of a liquid for a solid surface. For energetic\nreasons, macroscopic drops of liquid are nearly spherical away from interfaces\nwith solids, and any local deformations due to molecular-scale surface\ninteractions are negligible. Studies of wetting phenomena, therefore, typically\nassume that a liquid on a surface adopts the shape of a spherical cap. The\ndegree of wettability is then captured by the contact angle where the\nliquid-vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. As droplet volumes\nshrink to the scale of attoliters, however, surface interactions become\nsignificant, and droplets gradually assume distorted shapes that no longer\ncomply with our conventional, macroscopic conception of a drop. In this regime,\nthe contact angle becomes ambiguous, and it is unclear how to parametrize a\nliquid's affinity for a surface. A scalable metric for quantifying wettability\nis needed, especially given the emergence of technologies exploiting\nliquid-solid interactions at the nanoscale. Here we combine nanoscale\nexperiments with molecular-level simulation to study the breakdown of spherical\ndroplet shapes at small length scales. We demonstrate how measured droplet\ntopographies increasingly reveal non-spherical features as volumes shrink, in\nagreement with theoretical predictions. Ultimately, the nanoscale liquid\nflattens out to form layer-like molecular assemblies, instead of droplets, at\nthe solid surface. For the lack of a consistent contact angle at small scales,\nwe introduce a droplet's adsorption energy density as a new metric for a\nliquid's affinity for a surface. We discover that extrapolating the macroscopic\nidealization of a drop to the nanoscale, though it does not geometrically\nresemble a realistic droplet, can nonetheless recover its adsorption energy if\nline tension is properly included.\n", "  The breakdown of Ehrenfest's theorem imposes serious limitations on\nquaternionic quantum mechanics (QQM). In order to determine the conditions in\nwhich the theorem is valid, we examined the conservation of the probability\ndensity, the expectation value and the classical limit for a non-anti-hermitian\nformulation of QQM. The results also indicated that the non-anti-hermitian\nquaternionic theory is related to non-hermitian quantum mechanics, and thus the\nphysical problems described with both of the theories should be related.\n", "  At any quantum critical point (QCP) with a critical magnetic field $H_c$, the\nmagnetic Gr\\\"uneisen parameter $\\Gamma_{\\rm H}$, which equals the adiabatic\nmagnetocaloric effect, is predicted to show characteristic signatures such as a\ndivergence, sign change and $T/(H-H_c)^\\epsilon$ scaling. We categorize\nthirteen materials, ranging from heavy fermion metals to frustrated magnets,\nwhere such experimental signatures have been found. Remarkably, seven\nstoichiometric materials at ambient pressure show $H_c=0$. However, additional\nthermodynamic and magnetic experiments suggest that most of them do not show a\nzero-field QCP. While the existence of a pressure insensitive \"strange metal\"\nstate is one possibility, for some of the materials $\\Gamma_{\\rm H}$ seems\ninfluenced by impurities or a fraction of moments which are not participating\nin a frozen state. To unambiguously prove zero-field and pressure sensitive\nquantum criticality, a $\\Gamma_{\\rm H}$ divergence is insufficient and also the\nGr\\\"uneisen ratio of thermal expansion to specific heat must diverge.\n", "  An increasing number of human activities are studied using data produced by\nindividuals' ICT devices. In particular, when ICT data contain spatial\ninformation, they represent an invaluable source for analyzing urban dynamics.\nHowever, there have been relatively few contributions investigating the\nrobustness of this type of results against fluctuations of data\ncharacteristics. Here, we present a stability analysis of higher-level\ninformation extracted from mobile phone data passively produced during an\nentire year by 9 million individuals in Senegal. We focus on two\ninformation-retrieval tasks: (a) the identification of land use in the region\nof Dakar from the temporal rhythms of the communication activity; (b) the\nidentification of home and work locations of anonymized individuals, which\nenable to construct Origin-Destination (OD) matrices of commuting flows. Our\nanalysis reveal that the uncertainty of results highly depends on the sample\nsize, the scale and the period of the year at which the data were gathered.\nNevertheless, the spatial distributions of land use computed for different\nsamples are remarkably robust: on average, we observe more than 75% of shared\nsurface area between the different spatial partitions when considering activity\nof at least 100,000 users whatever the scale. The OD matrix is less stable and\ndepends on the scale with a share of at least 75% of commuters in common when\nconsidering all types of flows constructed from the home-work locations of\n100,000 users. For both tasks, better results can be obtained at larger levels\nof aggregation or by considering more users. These results confirm that ICT\ndata are very useful sources for the spatial analysis of urban systems, but\nthat their reliability should in general be tested more thoroughly.\n", "  The production of D mesons in proton-proton collisions at the LHCb detector\nis studied. We consider the single production of D^0, D^+, D^star, and D_s^+\nmesons and correlation spectra in the production of DbarD and DD pairs at the\nsqrt{S}=7 TeV and sqrt{S}=13 TeV. In case of the single D-meson production we\ncalculate differential cross sections over transverse momentum p_T while in the\npair DbarD,DD-meson production the cross sections are calculated over the\nazimuthal angle difference, rapidity difference, invariant mass of the pair M\nand over the p_T of the one meson from a pair. The cross sections are obtained\nat the leading order of the parton Reggeization approach using\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin unintegrated parton distribution functions in a proton. To\ndescribe the D-meson production we use universal scale-dependent c-quark and\ngluon fragmentation functions fitted to e^+e^- annihilation data from CERN\nLEP1. Our predictions find a good agreement with the LHCb Collaboration data\nwithin uncertainties and without free parameters.\n", "  We find a general expression for the one-loop self-energy function of neutral\n$\\rho$-meson due to $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ intermediate state in a background magnetic\nfield, valid for arbitrary magnitudes of the field. The pion propagator used in\nthis expression is given by Schwinger, which depends on a proper-time\nparameter. Restricting to weak fields, we calculate the decay rate\n$\\Gamma(\\rho^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^+ +\\pi^-)$, which changes negligibly from the\nvacuum value.\n", "  The blackbody theory of Planck played a seminal role in the development of\nquantum theory at the turn of the past century. A blackbody cavity is generally\nthought to be a collection of photons in thermal equilibrium; the radiation\nemitted is at all wavelengths, and the intensity follows a scaling law, which\nis Planck's characteristic distribution law. These photons arise from\nnon-interacting normal modes. Here we suggest that certain quantum critical\nstates when heated emit \"radiation\" at all wavelengths and satisfy all the\ncriteria of a blackbody. An important difference is that the \"radiation\" does\nnot necessarily consist of non-interacting photons, but also emergent\nrelativistic bosons or fermions. The examples we provide include emergent\nrelativistic fermions at a topological quantum critical point. This perspective\non a quantum critical state may be illuminating in many unforeseen ways.\n", "  We consider a free $p$-form gauge theory on a $d$-dimensional sphere of\nradius $R$ and calculate its free energy. We perform the calculation for\ngeneric values of $p$ and obtain the free energy as a function of $d, p$ and\n$R$. The result contains a $\\log R$ term with coefficient proportional to\n$\\left(2p+2-d \\right)$, which is consistent with lack of conformal invariance\nfor $p$ form theories in dimensions other than $2p+2$. We also compare the\nresult for $p$-form and $(d-p-2)$-form theory which are classically Hodge dual\nto each other in $d$ dimensions and find that they agree for odd values of $d$.\nInstead, for even $d$, we find that the results disagree by an amount that is\nconsistent with the reported values in the literature.\n", "  In dealing with high-dimensional data sets, factor models are often useful\nfor dimension reduction. The estimation of factor models has been actively\nstudied in various fields. In the first part of this paper, we present a new\napproach to estimate high-dimensional factor models, using the empirical\nspectral density of residuals. The spectrum of covariance matrices from\nfinancial data typically exhibits two characteristic aspects: a few spikes and\nbulk. The former represent factors that mainly drive the features and the\nlatter arises from idiosyncratic noise. Motivated by these two aspects, we\nconsider a minimum distance between two spectrums; one from a covariance\nstructure model and the other from real residuals of financial data that are\nobtained by subtracting principal components. Our method simultaneously\nprovides estimators of the number of factors and information about correlation\nstructures in residuals. Using free random variable techniques, the proposed\nalgorithm can be implemented and controlled effectively. Monte Carlo\nsimulations confirm that our method is robust to noise or the presence of weak\nfactors. Furthermore, the application to financial time-series shows that our\nestimators capture essential aspects of market dynamics.\n", "  We develop a general formalism applying to Newtonian self-gravitating\nBose-Einstein condensates. This formalism may find application in the context\nof dark matter halos. We introduce a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nincluding a source of dissipation (damping) and an arbitrary nonlinearity.\nUsing the Madelung transformation, we derive the hydrodynamic representation of\nthis generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation and obtain a damped quantum Euler\nequation involving a friction force proportional and opposite to the velocity\nand a pressure force associated with an equation of state determined by the\nnonlinearity present in the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In the\nstrong friction limit, we obtain a quantum Smoluchowski equation. These\nequations satisfy an $H$-theorem for a free energy functional constructed with\na generalized entropy. We specifically consider the Boltzmann and Tsallis\nentropies associated with isothermal and polytropic equations of state. We also\nconsider the entropy associated with the logotropic equation of state. We\nderive the virial theorem corresponding to the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, damped quantum Euler equation, and quantum Smoluchowski equation.\nUsing a Gaussian ansatz, we obtain a simple equation governing the dynamical\nevolution of the size of the condensate. We highlight a specific model of dark\nmatter halos corresponding to a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a\nlogarithmic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. It leads to dark matter\nhalos with an equation of state $P=\\rho k_B T_{\\rm eff}/m+2\\pi\na_s\\hbar^2\\rho^{2}/m^3$ presenting a condensed core (BEC/soliton) and an\nisothermal halo with an effective temperature $T_{\\rm eff}$. We propose that\nthis model provides an effective coarse-grained parametrization of dark matter\nhalos experiencing gravitational cooling.\n", "  Understanding dissipation in 2D quantum many-body systems is a remarkably\ndifficult open challenge. Here we show how numerical simulations for this\nproblem are possible by means of a tensor network algorithm that approximates\nsteady-states of 2D quantum lattice dissipative systems in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Our method is based on the intuition that strong dissipation kills\nquantum entanglement before it gets too large to handle. We test its validity\nby simulating a dissipative quantum Ising model, relevant for dissipative\nsystems of interacting Rydberg atoms, and benchmark our simulations with a\nvariational algorithm based on product and correlated states. Our results\nsupport the existence of a first order transition in this model, with no\nbistable region. We also simulate a dissipative spin-1/2 XYZ model, showing\nthat there is no re-entrance of the ferromagnetic phase. Our method enables the\ncomputation of steady states in 2D quantum lattice systems.\n", "  In this paper we consider discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the framework of projection methods.\nIn particular we employ symmetric interior penalty DG methods within the\nsecond-order rotational incremental pressure correction scheme. The major focus\nof the paper is threefold: i) We propose a modified upwind scheme based on the\nVijayasundaram numerical flux that has favourable properties in the context of\nDG. ii) We present a novel postprocessing technique in the Helmholtz projection\nstep based on $H(\\text{div})$ reconstruction of the pressure correction that is\ncomputed locally, is a projection in the discrete setting and ensures that the\nprojected velocity satisfies the discrete continuity equation exactly. As a\nconsequence it also provides local mass conservation of the projected velocity.\niii) Numerical results demonstrate the properties of the scheme for different\npolynomial degrees applied to two-dimensional problems with known solution as\nwell as large-scale three-dimensional problems. In particular we address\nsecond-order convergence in time of the splitting scheme as well as its\nlong-time stability.\n", "  The results are presented on the total cross sections, astrophysical\nS-factor, reaction rate of the deuteron radiative capture on 3He at the\ntemperatures from 0.03 up to 3 T9 calculated in the framework of the potential\ncluster model with the forbidden states coming from the classification of the\norbital states by the Young diagrams. Within the used model and exploited Young\ndiagram classification made it possible to reproduce the general features of\nthe available experimental data on the cross section and reconstructed\nastrophysical S-factor in the energy range from 200 keV up to 1.4 MeV. The\nparametrization of the obtained reaction rate has been found and been compared\nwith some other actual reactions with light clusters.\n", "  Using Nottale's theory of scale relativity relying on a fractal space-time,\nwe derive a generalized Schr\\\"odinger equation taking into account the\ninteraction of the system with the external environment. This equation\ndescribes the irreversible evolution of the system towards a static quantum\nstate. We first interpret the scale-covariant equation of dynamics stemming\nfrom Nottale's theory as a hydrodynamic viscous Burgers equation for a\npotential flow involving a complex velocity field and an imaginary viscosity.\nWe show that the Schr\\\"odinger equation can be directly obtained from this\nequation by performing a Cole-Hopf transformation equivalent to the WKB\ntransformation. We then introduce a friction force proportional and opposite to\nthe complex velocity in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics in a way that\npreserves the local conservation of the normalization condition. We find that\nthe resulting generalized Schr\\\"odinger equation, or the corresponding fluid\nequations obtained from the Madelung transformation, involve not only a damping\nterm but also an effective thermal term. The friction coefficient and the\ntemperature are related to the real and imaginary parts of the complex friction\ncoefficient in the scale-covariant equation of dynamics. This may be viewed as\na form of fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our generalized\nSchr\\\"odinger equation satisfies an $H$-theorem for the quantum Boltzmann free\nenergy. As a result, the probability distribution relaxes towards an\nequilibrium state which can be viewed as a Boltzmann distribution including a\nquantum potential. We propose to apply this generalized Schr\\\"odinger equation\nto dark matter halos in the Universe, possibly made of self-gravitating\nBose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  Across a far-reaching diversity of scientific and industrial applications, a\ngeneral key problem involves relating the structure of time-series data to a\nmeaningful outcome, such as detecting anomalous events from sensor recordings,\nor diagnosing patients from physiological time-series measurements like heart\nrate or brain activity. Currently, researchers must devote considerable effort\nmanually devising, or searching for, properties of their time series that are\nsuitable for the particular analysis problem at hand. Addressing this\nnon-systematic and time-consuming procedure, here we introduce a new tool,\nhctsa, that selects interpretable and useful properties of time series\nautomatically, by comparing implementations over 7700 time-series features\ndrawn from diverse scientific literatures. Using two exemplar biological\napplications, we show how hctsa allows researchers to leverage decades of\ntime-series research to quantify and understand informative structure in their\ntime-series data.\n", "  We study 2d chiral theories arising from 4d N=4 Super-Yang Mills (SYM) with\nvarying coupling tau. The 2d theory is obtained by dimensional reduction of N=4\nSYM on a complex curve with a partial topological twist that accounts for the\nnon-constant tau. The resulting 2d theories can preserve (0,n) with n = 2, 4,\n6, 8 chiral supersymmetry, and have a natural realization in terms of strings\nfrom wrapped D3-branes in F-theory. We determine the twisted dimensional\nreduction, as well as the spectrum and anomaly polynomials of the resulting\nstrings in various dimensions. We complement this by considering the dual\nM-theory configurations, which can either be realized in terms of M5-branes\nwrapped on complex surfaces, or M2-branes on curves that result in 1d\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics.\n", "  Yangian-like algebras, associated with current R-matrices, different from the\nYang ones, are introduced. These algebras are of two types. The so-called\nbraided Yangians are close to the Reflection Equation algebras, arising from\ninvolutive or Hecke symmetries. The Yangians of RTT type are close to the\ncorresponding RTT algebras. Some properties of these two classes of the\nYangians are studied. Thus, evaluation morphisms for them are constructed,\ntheir bi-algebra structures are described, and quantum analogs of certain\nsymmetric polynomials, in particular, quantum determinants, are introduced. It\nis shown that in any braided Yangian this determinant is always central,\nwhereas in the Yangians of RTT type it is not in general so. Analogs of the\nCayley-Hamilton-Newton identity in the braided Yangians are exhibited. A\nbozonization of the braided Yangians is performed.\n", "  The worldvolume theory of M5-branes on an ADE singularity\n$\\mathbb{R}^5/\\Gamma_G$ can be Higgsed in various ways, corresponding to the\npossible nilpotent orbits of $G$. In the F-theory dual picture, this\ncorresponds to activating T-brane data along two stacks of 7-branes and yields\na tensor branch realization for a large class of 6D SCFTs. In this paper, we\nshow that the moduli spaces and anomalies of these T-brane theories are related\nin a simple, universal way to data of the nilpotent orbits. This often works in\nsurprising ways and gives a nontrivial confirmation of the conjectured\nproperties of T-branes in F-theory. We use this result to formally engineer a\nclass of theories where the IIA picture na\\\"ively breaks down. We also give a\nproof of the $a$-theorem for all RG flows within this class of T-brane\ntheories.\n", "  We study the spin-orbit interaction effects in a one-dimensional electron\nsystem that result from the image charges in a nearby metallic gate. The\nnontrivial property of the image-potential-induced spin-orbit interaction\n(iSOI) is that it directly depends on the electron density because of which a\npositive feedback arises between the electron density and the iSOI magnitude.\nAs a result, the system becomes unstable against the density fluctuations under\ncertain conditions. In addition, the iSOI contributes to the electron-electron\ninteraction giving rise to strong changes in electron correlations and\ncollective excitation spectra. We trace the evolution of the spectrum of the\ncollective excitations and their spin-charge structures with the change in the\niSOI parameter. One out of two collective modes softens as the iSOI amplitude\ngrows to become unstable at its critical value. Interestingly, this mode\nevolves from a pure spin excitation to a pure charge one. At the critical point\nits velocity turns to zero together with the charge stiffness.\n", "  AXEL is a high pressure xenon gas TPC detector being developed for\nneutrinoless double-beta decay search. We use the proportional scintillation\nmode with a new electroluminescence light detection system to achieve high\nenergy resolution in a large detector. The detector also has tracking\ncapabilities, which enable significant background rejection. To demonstrate our\ndetection technique, we constructed a 10L prototype detector filled with up to\n10bar xenon gas. The FWHM energy resolution obtained by the prototype detector\nis 4.0 $\\pm$ 0.30 $\\%$ at 122 keV, which corresponds to 0.9 ~ 2.0 % when\nextrapolated to the Q value of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe.\n", "  The Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment (CASPEr) seeks to measure\noscillating torques on nuclear spins caused by axion or axion-like-particle\n(ALP) dark matter via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. A sample\nspin-polarized along a leading magnetic field experiences a resonance when the\nLarmor frequency matches the axion/ALP Compton frequency, generating precessing\ntransverse nuclear magnetization. Here we demonstrate a Spin-Exchange\nRelaxation-Free (SERF) magnetometer with sensitivity $\\approx 1~{\\rm\nfT/\\sqrt{Hz}}$ and an effective sensing volume of 0.1 $\\rm{cm^3}$ that may be\nuseful for NMR detection in CASPEr. A potential drawback of\nSERF-magnetometer-based NMR detection is the SERF's limited dynamic range. Use\nof a magnetic flux transformer to suppress the leading magnetic field is\nconsidered as a potential method to expand the SERF's dynamic range in order to\nprobe higher axion/ALP Compton frequencies.\n", "  We theoretically propose a graphene-based adiabatic quantum pump with\nintrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) subject to strain where two time-dependent\nextrinsic spin-orbit coupled barriers drive spin and charge currents. We study\nthree differing operation modes where i) location, ii) chemical potential, and\niii) SOC of the two barriers oscillate periodically and out of phase around\ntheir equilibrium states. Our results demonstrate that the amplitude of\nadiabatically pumped currents highly depends on the considered operation mode.\nWe find that such a device operates with highest efficiency and in a broader\nrange of parameters where the barriers chemical potential drives the quantum\npump. Our results also reveal that by introducing strain to the system, one can\nsuppress or enhance the charge and spin currents separately, depending on\nstrain direction.\n", "  We theoretically study the width of the s-wave confinement-induced resonance\n(CIR) in quasi-one-dimensional atomic gases under tunable transversely\nanisotropic confinement. We find that the width of the CIR can be tuned by\nvarying the transverse anisotropy. The change in the width of the CIR can\nmanifest itself in the position of the discontinuity in the interaction energy\ndensity, which can be probed experimentally.\n", "  A powerful method to interface quantum light with matter is to propagate the\nlight through an ensemble of atoms. Recently, a number of such interfaces have\nemerged, most prominently Rydberg ensembles, that enable strong nonlinear\ninteractions between propagating photons. A largely open problem is whether\nthese systems produce exotic many-body states of light and developing new tools\nto study propagation in the large photon number limit is highly desirable.\nHere, we provide a method based on a \"spin model\" that maps quasi\none-dimensional (1D) light propagation to the dynamics of an open 1D\ninteracting spin system, where all photon correlations are obtained from those\nof the spins. The spin dynamics in turn are numerically solved using the\ntoolbox of matrix product states. We apply this formalism to investigate vacuum\ninduced transparency, wherein the different photon number components of a pulse\npropagate with number-dependent group velocity and separate at output.\n", "  We report on the dynamics of the spin-1/2 quasi-one-dimensional frustrated\nmagnet LiCuVO$\\mathrm{_4}$ measured by nuclear spin relaxation in high magnetic\nfields 10--34 T, in which the ground state has spin-density-wave order. The\nspin fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase exhibit striking anisotropy with\nrespect to the magnetic field. The transverse excitation spectrum probed by\n$^{51}$V nuclei has an excitation gap, which increases with field. On the other\nhand, the gapless longitudinal fluctuations sensed by $^7$Li nuclei grow with\nlowering temperature, but tend to be suppressed with increasing field. Such\nanisotropic spin dynamics and its field dependence agree with the theoretical\npredictions and are ascribed to the formation of bound magnon pairs, a\nremarkable consequence of the frustration between ferromagnetic nearest\nneighbor and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions.\n", "  In this paper, we consider spin systems in three spatial dimensions, and\nprove that the local Hamiltonian problem for 3D lattices with face-centered\ncubic unit cells, 4-local translationally-invariant interactions between\nspin-3/2 particles and open boundary conditions is QMAEXP-complete. We go\nbeyond a mere embedding of past hard 1D history state constructions, and\nutilize a classical Wang tiling problem as binary counter in order to translate\none cube side length into a binary description for the verifier input. We\nfurther make use of a recently-developed computational model especially\nwell-suited for history state constructions, and combine it with a specific\ncircuit encoding shown to be universal for quantum computation. These novel\ntechniques allow us to significantly lower the local spin dimension, surpassing\nthe best translationally-invariant result to date by two orders of magnitude\n(in the number of degrees of freedom per coupling). This brings our models en\npar with the best non-translationally-invariant construction.\n", "  We analyze how maximal entanglement is generated at the fundamental level in\nQED by studying correlations between helicity states in tree-level scattering\nprocesses at high energy. We demonstrate that two mechanisms for the generation\nof maximal entanglement are at work: i) $s$-channel processes where the virtual\nphoton carries equal overlaps of the helicities of the final state particles,\nand ii) the indistinguishable superposition between $t$- and $u$-channels. We\nthen study whether requiring maximal entanglement constrains the coupling\nstructure of QED and the weak interactions. In the case of photon-electron\ninteractions unconstrained by gauge symmetry, we show how this requirement\nallows reproducing QED. For $Z$-mediated weak scattering, the maximal\nentanglement principle leads to non-trivial predictions for the value of the\nweak mixing angle $\\theta_W$. Our results are a first step towards\nunderstanding the connections between maximal entanglement and the fundamental\nsymmetries of high-energy physics.\n", "  By comparing femtosecond laser pulse induced ferro- and antiferromagnetic\ndynamics in one and the same material - metallic dysprosium - we show both to\nbehave fundamentally different. Antiferromagnetic order is considerably faster\nand much more efficiently manipulated by optical excitation than its\nferromagnetic counterpart. We assign the fast and extremely efficient process\nin the antiferromagnet to an interatomic transfer of angular momentum within\nthe spin system. Our findings do not only reveal this angular momentum transfer\nchannel effective in antiferromagnets and other magnetic structures with\nnon-parallel spin alignment, they also point out a possible route towards\nenergy-efficient spin manipulation for magnetic devices.\n", "  The peculiar band structure of semimetals exhibiting Dirac and Weyl crossings\ncan lead to spectacular electronic properties such as large mobilities\naccompanied by extremely high magnetoresistance. In particular, two closely\nneighbouring Weyl points of the same chirality are protected from annihilation\nby structural distortions or defects, thereby significantly reducing the\nscattering probability between them. Here we present the electronic properties\nof the transition metal diphosphides, WP2 and MoP2, that are type-II Weyl\nsemimetals with robust Weyl points. We present transport and angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements, and first principles calculations. Our\nsingle crystals of WP2 display an extremely low residual low-temperature\nresistivity of 3 nohm-cm accompanied by an enormous and highly anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance above 200 million % at 63 T and 2.5 K. These properties are\nlikely a consequence of the novel Weyl fermions expressed in this compound. We\nobserve a large suppression of charge carrier backscattering in WP2 from\ntransport measurements.\n", "  A preconcentrating surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor for the\nanalysis of liquid-soaked tissue, tiny liquid droplets and thin liquid films\nwithout the necessity to collect the analyte is reported. The SERS sensor is\nbased on a blockcopolymer membrane containing a spongy-continuous pore system.\nThe sensor's upper side is an array of porous nanorods having tips\nfunctionalized with Au nanoparticles. Capillarity in combination with\ndirectional evaporation drives the analyte solution in contact with the flat\nyet nanoporous underside of the SERS sensor through the continuous nanopore\nsystem toward the nanorod tips where non-volatile components of the analyte\nsolution precipitate at the Au nanoparticles. The nanorod architecture\nincreases the sensor surface in the detection volume and facilitates analyte\npreconcentration driven by directional solvent evaporation. The model analyte\n5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) can be detected in a 1 x 10-3 m solution\nabout 300 ms after the sensor is brought into contact with the solution.\nMoreover, a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm for the detection of the dissolved model\nanalyte is achieved.\n", "  The helicity-orbital coupling is an intriguing feature of magnetic skyrmions\nin frustrated magnets. Here, we explore the skyrmion dynamics in a frustrated\nmagnet based on the $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$J_{3}$ classical Heisenberg model\nexplicitly by including the dipole-dipole interaction. The skyrmion energy\nacquires a helicity dependence due to the dipole-dipole interaction, resulting\nin the current-induced translational motion with a fixed helicity. The lowest\nenergy states are the degenerate Bloch-type states, which can be used for\nbuilding the binary memory. By increasing the driving current, the helicity\nlocking-unlocking transition occurs, where the translational motion changes to\nthe rotational motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that two skyrmions can\nspontaneously form a bound state. The separation of the bound state forced by a\ndriving current is also studied. In addition, we show the annihilation of a\npair of skyrmion and antiskyrmion. Our results reveal the distinctive\nfrustrated skyrmions may enable viable applications in topological magnetism.\n", "  Point contact tunneling (PCT) and low energy muon spin rotation (LE-muSR) are\nused to probe, on the same samples, the surface superconducting properties of\nmicrometer thick niobium films deposited onto copper substrates using different\nsputtereing techniques: diode, dc magnetron (dcMS) and HIPIMS. The combined\nresults are compared to radio-frequency tests performances of RF cavities made\nwith the same processes. Degraded surface superconducting properties are found\nto yield lower quality factors and stronger Q slope. In addition, both\ntechniques find evidence for surface paramagnetism on all samples and\nparticularly on Nb films prepared by HIPIMS.\n", "  Within the recent reformulation of quantum mechanics where a potential\nfunction is not required, we show how to reconstruct the potential so that a\ncorrespondence with the standard formulation could be established. However,\nsevere restriction is placed by the correspondence on the kinematics of such\nproblems.\n", "  The Dirac equation for relativistic electron waves is the parent model for\nWeyl and Majorana fermions as well as topological insulators. Simulation of\nDirac physics in three-dimensional photonic crystals, though fundamentally\nimportant for topological phenomena at optical frequencies, encounters the\nchallenge of synthesis of both Kramers double degeneracy and parity inversion.\nHere we show how type-II Dirac points---exotic Dirac relativistic waves yet to\nbe discovered---are robustly realized through the nonsymmorphic screw symmetry.\nThe emergent type-II Dirac points carry nontrivial topology and are the mother\nstates of type-II Weyl points. The proposed all-dielectric architecture enables\nrobust cavity states at photonic-crystal---air interfaces and anomalous\nrefraction, with very low energy dissipation.\n", "  Paradoxes in the impact dynamics of rigid bodies are known to arise in the\npresence of friction. We show here that, on specificc occasions, in the absence\nof friction, the conservation laws of classical mechanics are also incompatible\nwith the collisions of smooth, strictly convex rigid bodies. Under the\nassumption that the impact impulse is along the normal direction to the surface\nat the contact point, two convex rigid bodies which are well separated can come\ninto contact, and then interpenetrate each other. This paradox can be\nconstructed in both 2D and 3D when the collisions are tangential, in which case\nno momentum or energy transfer between the two bodies is possible. The\npostcollisional interpenetration can be realized through the contact points or\nthrough neighboring points only. The penetration distance is shown to be\nO(t^3). The conclusion is that rigid body dynamics is not compatible with the\nconservation laws of classical mechanics.\n", "  Periodically driven systems play a prominent role in optical lattices. In\nthese ultracold atomic systems, driving is used to create a variety of\ninteresting behaviours, of which an important example is provided by\ntopological states of matter. Such Floquet topological phases have a richer\nclassification that their equilibrium counterparts. Although analogues of the\nequilibrium topological phases exist, which are characterised by a Chern\nnumber, the corresponding Hall conductivity, and protected edge states, there\nis an additional possibility. This is a phase that has vanishing Chern number\nand no Hall conductivity, but nevertheless hosts anomalous topological edge\nstates. Due to experimental difficulties associated with the observation of\nsuch a phase, it has not been experimentally realised so far. In this paper, we\nshow that optical lattices prove to be a good candidate for both its\nrealisation and subsequent observation, because they can be driven in a\ncontrolled manner. Specifically, we present a simple shaking protocol that\nserves to realise this special Floquet phase, discuss the specific properties\nthat it has, and propose a method to experimentally detect this fascinating\ntopological phase that has no counterpart in equilibrium systems.\n", "  Superconductivity is a fascinating quantum phenomenon characterized by zero\nelectrical resistance and the Meissner effect. To date, several distinct\nfamilies of superconductors (SCs) have been discovered. These include\nthree-dimensional (3D) bulk SCs in both inorganic and organic materials as well\nas two-dimensional (2D) thin film SCs but only in $inorganic$ materials. Here\nwe predict superconductivity in 2D and 3D $organic$ metal-organic frameworks by\nusing first-principles calculations. We show that the highly conductive and\nrecently synthesized Cu-benzenehexathial (BHT) is a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\nSC. Remarkably, the monolayer Cu-BHT has a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of\n4.43 K while $T_{c}$ of bulk Cu-BHT is 1.58 K. Different from the enhanced\n$T_{c}$ in 2D inorganic SCs which is induced by interfacial effects, the\n$T_{c}$ enhancement in this 2D organic SC is revealed to be the out-of-plane\nsoft-mode vibrations, analogous to surface mode enhancement originally proposed\nby $Ginzburg$. Our findings not only shed new light on better understanding 2D\nsuperconductivity, but also open a new direction to search for SCs by interface\nengineering with organic materials.\n", "  We consider the contribution to the density of vibrational states and the\ndistribution of energy barrier heights of incipient instabilities in a glass\nmodeled by a jammed packing of spheres. On approaching an instability, the\nfrequency of a normal mode and the height of the energy barrier to cross into a\nnew ground state both vanish. These instabilities produce a contribution to the\ndensity of vibrational states that scales as $\\omega^3$ at low frequencies\n$\\omega$, but which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. In addition, they\naffect an anharmonic property, the distribution of energy barriers $\\Delta H$,\ngiving a contribution that scales as $\\Delta H^{-1/3}$ at low barrier heights,\nwhich should be universal for jammed and glassy systems.\n", "  There exists considerable confusion in estimating the spin diffusion length\nof materials with high spin-orbit coupling from spin pumping experiments. For\ndesigning functional devices, it is important to determine the spin diffusion\nlength with sufficient accuracy from experimental results. An inaccurate\nestimation of spin diffusion length also affects the estimation of other\nparameters (e.g., spin mixing conductance, spin Hall angle) concomitantly. The\nspin diffusion length for platinum (Pt) has been reported in literature in a\nwide range of 0.5 - 14 nm, and particularly it is a constant value independent\nof Pt's thickness. Here, the key reasonings behind such wide range of reported\nvalues of spin diffusion length have been identified comprehensively.\nParticularly, it is shown here that a thickness-dependent conductivity and spin\ndiffusion length is necessary to simultaneously match the experimental results\nof effective spin mixing conductance and inverse spin Hall voltage due to spin\npumping. Such thickness-dependent spin diffusion length is tantamount to\nElliott-Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, which bodes well for transitional\nmetals. This conclusion is not altered even when there is significant\ninterfacial spin memory loss. Furthermore, the variations in the estimated\nparameters are also studied, which is important for technological applications.\n", "  The electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of Ni1.5Fe1.5O4 ferrite\nhas been controlled by varying the annealing temperature of the chemical routed\nsamples. The frequency activated conductivity obeyed Jonschers power law and\nuniversal scaling suggested semiconductor nature. An unusual metal like state\nhas been revealed in the measurement temperature scale in between two\nsemiconductor states with different activation energy. The metal like state has\nbeen affected by thermal annealing of the material. The analysis of electrical\nimpedance and modulus spectra has confirmed non-Debye dielectric relaxation\nwith contributions from grains and grain boundaries. The dielectric relaxation\nprocess is thermally activated in terms of measurement temperature and\nannealing temperature of the samples. The hole hopping process, due to presence\nof Ni3+ ions in the present Ni rich ferrite, played a significant role in\ndetermining the thermal activated conduction mechanism. This work has\nsuccessfully applied the technique of a combined variation of annealing\ntemperature and pH value during chemical reaction for tuning electrical\nparameters in a wide range; for example dc limit of conductivity 10power(-4)\n-10power(-12) S/cm, and unusually high activation energy 0.17-1.36 eV.\n", "  We present a systematic calculation of the corrections of the stress-energy\ntensor and currents of the free boson and Dirac fields up to second order in\nthermal vorticity, which is relevant for relativistic hydrodynamics. These\ncorrections are non-dissipative because they survive at general thermodynamic\nequilibrium with non vanishing mean values of the conserved generators of the\nLorentz group, i.e. angular momenta and boosts. Their equilibrium nature makes\nit possible to express the relevant coefficients by means of correlators of the\nangular-momentum and boost operators with stress-energy tensor and current,\nthus making simpler to determine their so-called \"Kubo formulae\". We show that,\nat least for free fields, the corrections are of quantum origin and we study\nseveral limiting cases and compare our results with previous calculations. We\nfind that the axial current of the free Dirac field receives corrections\nproportional to the vorticity independently of the anomalous term.\n", "  One proposed method for spacecraft to reach nearby stars is by accelerating\nsails using either solar radiation pressure or directed energy. This idea\nconstitutes the thesis behind the Breakthrough Starshot project, which aims to\naccelerate a gram-mass spacecraft up to one-fifth the speed of light towards\nProxima Centauri. For such a case, the combination of the sail's low mass and\nrelativistic velocity render previous treatments formally incorrect, including\nthat of Einstein himself in his seminal 1905 paper introducing special\nrelativity. To address this, we present formulae for a sail's acceleration,\nfirst in response to a single photon and then extended to an ensemble. We show\nhow the sail's motion in response to an ensemble of incident photons is\nequivalent to that of a single photon of energy equal to that of the ensemble.\nWe use this 'principle of ensemble equivalence' for both perfect and imperfect\nmirrors, enabling a simple analytic prediction of the sail's velocity curve.\nUsing our results and adopting putative parameters for Starshot, we estimate\nthat previous relativistic treatments underestimate the spacecraft's terminal\nvelocity by ~50m/s for the same incident energy, sufficient to miss a target by\nseveral Earth radii. Additionally, we use a simple model to predict the sail's\ntemperature and diffraction beam losses during the laser firing period,\nallowing us to estimate that for firing times of a few minutes and operating\ntemperatures below 300C (573K), Starshot will require a sail of which absorbs\nless than 1 in 260,000 photons.\n", "  Density dependences of the mass and self-energies of $\\Lambda_c$ in nulear\nmatter are studied in the parity projected QCD sum rule. Effects of nuclear\nmatter are taken into account through the quark and gluon condensates. It is\nfound that the four-quark condensates give dominant contributions. As the\ndensity dependences of the four-quark condensates are not known well, we\nexamine two hypotheses. One is based on the factorization hypothesis (F-type)\nand the other is derived from the perturbative chiral quark model (QM-type).\nThe F-type strongly depends on density, while the QM-type gives a weaker\ndependence. It is found that, for the F-type dependence, the energy of\n$\\Lambda_c$ increases as the density of nuclear matter grows, that is,\n$\\Lambda_c$ feels repulsion. On the other hand, the QM-type predicts a weak\nattraction ($\\sim 20$ MeV at the normal nuclear density) for $\\Lambda_c$ in\nnuclear matter. We carry out a similar analysis of the $\\Lambda$ hyperon and\nfind that the F-type density dependence is too strong to explain the observed\nbinding energy of $\\Lambda$ in nuclei. Thus we conclude that the weak density\ndependence of the four-quark condensate is more realistic. The scalar and\nvector self-energies of $\\Lambda_c$ for the QM-type dependence are found to be\nmuch smaller than those of the light baryons.\n", "  We present results from large-scale numerical simulations of a first order\nthermal phase transition in the early universe, in order to explore the shape\nof the acoustic gravitational wave and the velocity power spectra. We compare\nthe results with the predictions of the recently proposed sound shell model.\nFor the gravitational wave power spectrum, we find that the predicted $k^{-3}$\nbehaviour, where $k$ is the wavenumber, emerges clearly for detonations. The\npower spectra from deflagrations show similar features, but exhibit a steeper\nhigh-$k$ decay and an extra feature not accounted for in the model. There are\ntwo independent length scales: the mean bubble separation and the thickness of\nthe sound shell around the expanding bubble of the low temperature phase. It is\nthe sound shell thickness which sets the position of the peak of the power\nspectrum. The low wavenumber behaviour of the velocity power spectrum is\nconsistent with a causal $k^{3}$, except for the thinnest sound shell, where it\nis steeper. We present parameters for a simple broken power law fit to the\ngravitational wave power spectrum for wall speeds well away from the speed of\nsound where this form can be usefully applied. We examine the prospects for the\ndetection, showing that a LISA-like mission has the sensitivity to detect a\ngravitational wave signal from sound waves with an RMS fluid velocity of about\n$0.05c$, produced from bubbles with a mean separation of about $10^{-2}$ of the\nHubble radius. The shape of the gravitational wave power spectrum depends on\nthe bubble wall speed, and it may be possible to estimate the wall speed, and\nconstrain other phase transition parameters, with an accurate measurement of a\nstochastic gravitational wave background.\n", "  We consider a three-component Fermi gas that has SU(3) symmetry and is\nconfined to two dimensions (2D). For realistic cold atomic gas experiments, we\nshow that the phase diagram of the quasi-2D system can be characterized using\ntwo 2D scattering parameters: the scattering length and the effective range.\nUnlike the case in 3D, we argue that three-body bound states (trimers) in the\nquasi-2D system can be stable against three-body losses. Using a low-density\nexpansion coupled with a variational approach, we investigate the fate of such\ntrimers in the many-body system as the attractive interactions are decreased\n(or, conversely, as the density of particles is increased). We find that\nremnants of trimers can persist in the form of strong three-body correlations\nin the weak-coupling (high-density) limit.\n", "  We study a binary spin-mixture of a zero-temperature repulsively interacting\n$^6$Li atoms using both the atomic-orbital and the density functional\napproaches. The gas is initially prepared in a configuration of two magnetic\ndomains and we determine the frequency of the spin-dipole oscillations which\nare emerging after the repulsive barrier, initially separating the domains, is\nremoved. We find, in agreement with recent experiment (G. Valtolina et al.,\narXiv:1605.07850 (2016)), the occurrence of a ferromagnetic instability in an\natomic gas while the interaction strength between different spin states is\nincreased, after which the system becomes ferromagnetic. The ferromagnetic\ninstability is preceded by the softening of the spin-dipole mode.\n", "  Structure formation at small cosmological scales provides an important\nfrontier for dark matter (DM) research. Scenarios with small DM particle\nmasses, large momenta or hidden interactions tend to suppress the gravitational\nclustering at small scales. The details of this suppression depend on the DM\nparticle nature, allowing for a direct link between DM models and astrophysical\nobservations. However, most of the astrophysical constraints obtained so far\nrefer to a very specific shape of the power suppression, corresponding to\nthermal warm dark matter (WDM), i.e., candidates with a Fermi-Dirac or\nBose-Einstein momentum distribution. In this work we introduce a new analytical\nfitting formula for the power spectrum, which is simple yet flexible enough to\nreproduce the clustering signal of large classes of non-thermal DM models,\nwhich are not at all adequately described by the oversimplified notion of WDM.\nWe show that the formula is able to fully cover the parameter space of sterile\nneutrinos (whether resonantly produced or from particle decay), mixed cold and\nwarm models, fuzzy dark matter, as well as other models suggested by effective\ntheory of structure formation (ETHOS). Based on this fitting formula, we\nperform a large suite of N-body simulations and we extract important nonlinear\nstatistics, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function.\nFinally, we present first preliminary astrophysical constraints, based on\nlinear theory, from both the number of Milky Way satellites and the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest. This paper is a first step towards a general and\ncomprehensive modeling of small-scale departures from the standard cold DM\nmodel.\n", "  The growing experimental indication of Lepton Flavour Universality Violation\n(LFUV) both in charged- and neutral-current semileptonic B-decays, has\ntriggered many theoretical interpretations of such non-standard phenomena.\nFocusing on popular scenarios where the explanation of these anomalies requires\nNew Physics at the TeV scale, we emphasise the importance of including\nelectroweak corrections to obtain trustable predictions for the models in\nquestion. We find that the most important quantum effects are the modifications\nof the leptonic couplings of the W and Z vector bosons and the generation of a\npurely leptonic effective Lagrangian. As a result, the tight experimental\nbounds on Z-pole observables and tau decays challenge an explanation of the\ncurrent non-standard data. We illustrate how these effects arise, by providing\na detailed discussion of the running and matching procedure which is necessary\nto derive the low-energy effective Lagrangian.\n", "  In a recent paper it is claimed that vacuum birefringence has been\nexperimentally observed for the first time by measuring the degree of\npolarization of visible light from a Magnetar candidate, a neutron star with a\nmagnetic field presumably as large as $B\\sim 10^{13}$~G. The role of such a\nstrong magnetic field is twofold. First, the surface of the star emits, at each\npoint, polarized light with linear polarization correlated with the orientation\nof the magnetic field. Depending on the relative orientation of the magnetic\naxis of the star with the direction to the distant observer, a certain degree\nof polarization should be visible. Second, the strong magnetic field in the\nvacuum surrounding the star could enhance the effective degree of polarization\nobserved: vacuum birefringence. We compare experimental data and theoretical\nexpectations concluding that the conditions to support a claim of strong\nevidence of vacuum birefringence effects are not met.\n", "  We estimate the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) using the\nsimulation results for neutron star-forming and black hole-forming stellar\ncollapses from the Garching group. Scenarios with different distributions of\nblack-hole forming collapses with the progenitor mass are discussed, and the\nuncertainty on the cosmological rate of collapses is included. The electron\nantineutrino component of the DSNB above 11 MeV of energy is found to be ~(1.4\n- 3.7) cm^-2 s^-1; the contribution of black hole-forming collapses could\ndominate the flux above ~25 MeV. We calculate the potential of detecting the\nDSNB at SuperK-Gd and JUNO, in about a decade-long period of operation. We find\nthat, in our model, it is likely that a significant excess above the background\nwill be obtained at JUNO, while detection will be more difficult at SuperK-Gd.\nThe potential when the two experimental results are examined jointly is\ndiscussed as well. We also consider an example of a future O(10) kt slow liquid\nscintillator detector, and show that there the odds of detection are very good.\nOur results motivate experimental efforts in reducing the backgrounds due to\nneutral current scattering of atmospheric neutrinos in SuperK-Gd.\n", "  The ordered L1$_0$ FeNi phase (tetrataenite) is recently considered as a\npromising candidate for the rare-earth free permanent magnets applications. In\nthis work we calculate several characteristics of the L1$_0$ FeNi, where most\nof the results come form the fully relativistic full potential FPLO method with\nthe generalized gradient approximation (GGA). A special attention deserves the\nsummary of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE's), the full\npotential calculations of the anisotropy constant $K_3$, and the combined\nanalysis of the Fermi surface and three-dimensional $\\mathbf{k}$-resolved MAE.\nOther calculated parameters presented in this article are the magnetic moments\n$m_{s}$ and $m_{l}$, magnetostrictive coefficient $\\lambda_{001}$, bulk modulus\nB$_0$, and lattice parameters. The MAE's summary shows rather big discrepancies\nbetween the experimental MAE's from literature and also between the calculated\nMAE's.\n", "  A measurement of $b$-hadron pair production is presented, based on a data set\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 11.4 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton\ncollisions recorded at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.\nEvents are selected in which a $b$-hadron is reconstructed in a decay channel\ncontaining $J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\mu\\mu$, and a second $b$-hadron is\nreconstructed in a decay channel containing a muon. Results are presented in a\nfiducial volume defined by kinematic requirements on three muons based on those\nused in the analysis. The fiducial cross section is measured to be $17.7 \\pm\n0.1 ($stat.$) \\pm 2.0 ($syst.$)$ nb. A number of normalised differential cross\nsections are also measured, and compared to predictions from the Pythia8,\nHerwig++, MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and Sherpa event generators, providing new\nconstraints on heavy flavour production.\n", "  We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium 87 atoms to quantum\ndegeneracy. The method does not involve evaporative cooling, is fast, and\ninduces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical\nlattice that enables cycles of cloud compression to increase the density,\nfollowed by degenerate Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature.\nLight-induced loss at high atomic density is substantially reduced by using far\nred detuned optical pumping light. Starting with 2000 atoms, we prepare 1400\natoms in 300 ms at quantum degeneracy, as confirmed by the appearance of a\nbimodal velocity distribution as the system crosses over from a classical gas\nto a Bose-condensed, interacting one-dimensional gas with a macroscopic\npopulation of the quantum ground state. The method should be broadly applicable\nto many bosonic and fermionic species, and to systems where evaporative cooling\nis not possible.\n", "  The reduction by restricting the spectral parameters $k$ and $k'$ on a\ngeneric algebraic curve of degree $\\mathcal{N}$ is performed for the discrete\nAKP, BKP and CKP equations, respectively. A variety of two-dimensional discrete\nintegrable systems possessing a more general solution structure arise from the\nreduction, and in each case a unified formula for generic positive integer\n$\\mathcal{N}\\geq 2$ is given to express the corresponding reduced integrable\nlattice equations. The obtained extended two-dimensional lattice models give\nrise to many important integrable partial difference equations as special\ndegenerations. Some new integrable lattice models such as the discrete\nSawada--Kotera, Kaup--Kupershmidt and Hirota--Satsuma equations in extended\nform are given as examples within the framework.\n", "  Using muon spin rotation it is shown that the field of first flux penetration\nH_entry in Nb is enhanced by about 30% if coated with an overlayer of Nb_3Sn or\nMgB_2. This is consistent with an increase from the lower critical magnetic\nfield H_c1 up to the superheating field H_sh of the Nb substrate. In the\nexperiments presented here coatings of Nb_3Sn and MgB_2 with a thickness\nbetween 50 and 2000nm have been tested. H_entry does not depend on material or\nthickness. This suggests that the energy barrier at the boundary between the\ntwo materials prevents flux entry up to H_sh of the substrate. A mechanism\nconsistent with these findings is that the proximity effect recovers the\nstability of the energy barrier for flux penetration, which is suppressed by\ndefects for uncoated samples. Additionally, a low temperature baked Nb sample\nhas been tested. Here a 6% increase of H_entry was found, also pushing H_entry\nbeyond H_c1.\n", "  We report the first dark matter search results from XENON1T, a\n$\\sim$2000-kg-target-mass dual-phase (liquid-gas) xenon time projection chamber\nin operation at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy and the first\nton-scale detector of this kind. The blinded search used 34.2 live days of data\nacquired between November 2016 and January 2017. Inside the (1042$\\pm$12) kg\nfiducial mass and in the [5, 40] $\\mathrm{keV}_{\\mathrm{nr}}$ energy range of\ninterest for WIMP dark matter searches, the electronic recoil background was\n$(1.93 \\pm 0.25) \\times 10^{-4}$ events/(kg $\\times$ day $\\times\n\\mathrm{keV}_{\\mathrm{ee}}$), the lowest ever achieved in a dark matter\ndetector. A profile likelihood analysis shows that the data is consistent with\nthe background-only hypothesis. We derive the most stringent exclusion limits\non the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section for WIMP masses\nabove 10 GeV/c${}^2$, with a minimum of 7.7 $\\times 10^{-47}$ cm${}^2$ for\n35-GeV/c${}^2$ WIMPs at 90% confidence level.\n", "  We consider fundamental limits on the detectable size of macroscopic quantum\nsuperpositions. We argue that a full quantum mechanical treatment of system\nplus measurement device is required, and that a (classical) reference frame for\nphase or direction needs to be established to certify the quantum state. When\ntaking the size of such a classical reference frame into account, we show that\nto reliably distinguish a quantum superposition state from an incoherent\nmixture requires a measurement device that is quadratically bigger than the\nsuperposition state. Whereas for moderate system sizes such as generated in\nprevious experiments this is not a stringent restriction, for macroscopic\nsuperpositions of the size of a cat the required effort quickly becomes\nintractable, requiring measurement devices of the size of the Earth. We\nillustrate our results using macroscopic superposition states of photons,\nspins, and position. Finally, we also show how this limitation can be\ncircumvented by dealing with superpositions in relative degrees of freedom.\n", "  The dynamics of fermionic many-body systems is investigated in the framework\nof Boltzmann-Langevin (BL) stochastic one-body approaches. Within the recently\nintroduced BLOB model, we examine the interplay between mean-field effects and\ntwo-body correlations, of stochastic nature, for nuclear matter at moderate\ntemperature and in several density conditions, corresponding to stable or\nmechanically unstable situations. Numerical results are compared to analytic\nexpectations for the fluctuation amplitude of isoscalar and isovector\ndensities, probing the link to the properties of the employed effective\ninteraction, namely symmetry energy (for isovector modes) and incompressibility\n(for isoscalar modes). For unstable systems, clusterization is observed. The\nassociated features are compared to analytical results for the typical length\nand time scales characterizing the growth of unstable modes in nuclear matter\nand for the isotopic variance of the emerging fragments. We show that the BLOB\nmodel is generally better suited than simplified approaches previously\nintroduced to solve the BL equation, and it is therefore more advantageous in\napplications to open systems, like heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Unprecedented human mobility has driven the rapid urbanization around the\nworld. In China, the fraction of population dwelling in cities increased from\n17.9% to 52.6% between 1978 and 2012. Such large-scale migration poses\nchallenges for policymakers and important questions for researchers. To\ninvestigate the process of migrant integration, we employ a one-month complete\ndataset of telecommunication metadata in Shanghai with 54 million users and 698\nmillion call logs. We find systematic differences between locals and migrants\nin their mobile communication networks and geographical locations. For\ninstance, migrants have more diverse contacts and move around the city with a\nlarger radius than locals after they settle down. By distinguishing new\nmigrants (who recently moved to Shanghai) from settled migrants (who have been\nin Shanghai for a while), we demonstrate the integration process of new\nmigrants in their first three weeks. Moreover, we formulate classification\nproblems to predict whether a person is a migrant. Our classifier is able to\nachieve an F1-score of 0.82 when distinguishing settled migrants from locals,\nbut it remains challenging to identify new migrants because of class imbalance.\nThis classification setup holds promise for identifying new migrants who will\nsuccessfully integrate into locals (new migrants that misclassified as locals).\n", "  Synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons passing through an undulator\nplaced in a storage ring is decomposed in coherent modes. The case of ultimate\nstorage rings where the electron emittance is comparable to the emittance of\nthe photon fan is analyzed by means of the cross spectral density and the\ncoherent mode spectrum. The proposed method permits naturally the statistical\nanalysis and propagation of the cross spectral density along the beamline\noptics. The coherence properties of the X-ray beam at any point of the beamline\nare completely given in terms of the eigenvalues and coherent modes of the\ncross spectral density.\n", "  We characterize photonic transport in a boundary driven array of nonlinear\noptical cavities. We find that the output field suddenly drops when the chain\nlength is increased beyond a threshold. After this threshold a highly chaotic\nand unstable regime emerges, which marks the onset of a super-diffusive\nphotonic transport. We show the scaling of the threshold with pump intensity\nand nonlinearity. Finally, we address the competition of disorder and\nnonlinearity presenting a diffusive-insulator phase transition.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in\nproton-proton collision events with a charged lepton (electron or muon), two\njets identified as originating from a bottom quark decay, and significant\nimbalance in the transverse momentum. The search was performed using a data\nsample corresponding to 35.9 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS\nexperiment in 2016 at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV. Events with this signature can arise,\nfor example, from the electroweak production of gauginos, which are predicted\nin models based on supersymmetry. The event yields observed in data are\nconsistent with the estimated standard model backgrounds. Limits are obtained\non the cross sections for chargino-neutralino production in a simplified model\nof supersymmetry with the decays chargino to W+/- lsp and neutralino to H lsp.\nValues of m[chargino] between 220 and 490 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence\nlevel by this search when the lsp is massless, and values of m[lsp] are\nexcluded up to 110 GeV for m[chargino] about 450 GeV.\n", "  Spin-charge separation is known to be broken in many physically interesting\none-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D systems with spin-orbit interaction because\nof which spin and charge degrees of freedom are mixed in collective\nexcitations. Mixed spin-charge modes carry an electric charge and therefore can\nbe investigated by electrical means. We explore this possibility by studying\nthe dynamic conductance of a 1D electron system with image-potential-induced\nspin-orbit interaction. The real part of the admittance reveals an oscillatory\nbehavior versus frequency that reflects the collective excitation resonances\nfor both modes at their respective transit frequencies. By analyzing the\nfrequency dependence of the conductance the mode velocities can be found and\ntheir spin-charge structure can be determined quantitatively.\n", "  We present universal features of the topological invariant of p-wave\nsuperconducting wires after the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneities. Three\nclasses of distributed potentials are studied, a single- impurity, a\ncommensurate and an incommensurate model using periodic site modulations. An\nanalytical polynomial description is achieved by splitting the topological\ninvariant into two parts, one dependent on the chemical potential and the other\nnot. For the homogeneous case, an elliptical region is found where the\ntopological invariant oscillates. The zeros of these oscillations occur at\npoints where the fermion parity switches for finite wires. The increase of\nthese oscillations with the inhomogeneity strength leads to new non-topological\nphases. We characterize these new phases according to each class of spatial\ndistributions. Such phases could also be observed in the XY model.\n", "  In a recent publication we showed that permutation symmetry reduces the\nnumerical complexity of Lindblad quantum master equations for identical\nmulti-level systems from exponential to polynomial scaling. This is important\nfor open system dynamics including realistic system bath interactions and\ndephasing in, for instance, the Dicke model, multi-$\\Lambda$ system setups etc.\nHere we present an object-oriented C++ library that allows to setup and solve\narbitrary quantum optical Lindblad master equations, especially those that are\npermutationally symmetric in the multi-level systems. PsiQuaSP (Permutation\nsymmetry for identical Quantum Systems Package) uses the PETSc package for\nsparse linear algebra methods and differential equations as basis. The aim of\nPsiQuaSP is to provide flexible, storage efficient and scalable code while\nbeing as user friendly as possible. It is easily applied to many quantum\noptical or quantum information systems with more than one multi-level system.\nWe first review the basics of the permutation symmetry for multi-level systems\nin quantum master equations. The application of PsiQuaSP to quantum dynamical\nproblems is illustrated with several typical, simple examples of open quantum\noptical systems.\n", "  We present an explicit expression for the grand potential of the U(N)^3\nsuperconformal Chern-Simons theory with the Chern-Simons levels being (k,0,-k).\nFrom the viewpoint of the Newton polygon, it is expected that the grand\npotential is given by the free energy of the topological string theory on the\nlocal D_5 del Pezzo geometry, though the explicit identification was a puzzle\nfor years. We show how the expectation is realized explicitly. As a bonus, we\ncan also study the Z_2 orbifold of this theory and find the grand potential is\nnow given in terms of the local E_7 del Pezzo geometry.\n", "  In this work, we propose new field-free estimators for static field-gradient\npolarizabilities in finite temperature PIMC simulation. Namely,\ndipole--quadrupole polarizability $A$, dipole--dipole--quadrupole\npolarizability $B$ and quadrupole--quadrupole polarizability $C$ are computed\nfor several up to two-electron systems: H, H$^-$, He, Li$^+$, Be$^{2+}$,\nPs$_2$, PsH, H$_2^+$, H$_2$, H$_3^+$ and HeH$^+$. We provide complementary data\nfor ground state electronic properties within the adiabatic approximation, and\ndemonstrate good agreement with available values in the literature. More\nimportantly, we present fully non-adiabatic results from 50 K to 1600 K, which\nallow us to analyze and discuss strong thermal coupling and rovibrational\neffects in total field-gradient polarizabilities. These phenomena are most\nrelevant but clearly overlooked, e.g., in the construction of modern\npolarizable force field models. However, our main purpose is demonstrating the\naccuracy and simplicity of our approach in a problem that is generally\nchallenging.\n", "  Very recently, the LHCb collaboration has observed in the final state\n$\\Lambda_c^+ K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ a resonant structure that is identified as the\ndoubly-charmed baryon $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$. Inspired by this observation, we\ninvestigate the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$,\n$\\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\\Omega_{cc}^{+}$, $\\Xi_{bc}^{(\\prime)+}$,\n$\\Xi_{bc}^{(\\prime)0}$, $\\Omega_{bc}^{(\\prime)0}$, $\\Xi_{bb}^{0}$,\n$\\Xi_{bb}^{-}$ and $\\Omega_{bb}^{-}$ and focus on the decays into spin $1/2$\nbaryons in this paper. At the quark level these decay processes are induced by\nthe $c\\to d/s$ or $b\\to u/c$ transitions, and the two spectator quarks can be\nviewed as a scalar or axial vector diquark. We first derive the hadronic form\nfactors for these transitions in the light-front approach and then apply them\nto predict the partial widths for the semi-leptonic and non-leptonic decays of\ndoubly heavy baryons. We find that a number of decay channels are sizable and\ncan be examined in future measurements at experimental facilities like LHC,\nBelle II and CEPC.\n", "  In this article we study gravitational lensing by non-rotating and\nasymptotically flat black holes in Horndeski theory. By adopting the strong\ndeflection limit, we calculate the deflection angle, from which we obtain the\npositions and the magnifications of the relativistic images. We compare our\nresults with those corresponding to black holes in General Relativity. We\nanalyze the astrophysical consequences in the case of the nearest supermassive\nblack holes.\n", "  We present a specific constant-amplitude periodic level-crossing model of the\nsemi-classical quantum time-dependent two-state problem that belongs to a\ngeneral Heun class of field configurations. The exact analytic solution for the\nprobability amplitude, generally written for this class in terms of the general\nHeun functions, in this specific case admits series expansion in terms of the\nincomplete Beta functions. Terminating this series results in an infinite\nhierarchy of finite-sum closed-form solutions each standing for a particular\ntwo-state model, which generally is only conditionally integrable in the sense\nthat for these field configurations the amplitude and phase modulation\nfunctions are not varied independently. However, there exists at least one\nexception when the model is unconditionally integrable, that is the Rabi\nfrequency and the detuning of the driving optical field are controlled\nindependently. This is a constant-amplitude periodic level-crossing model, for\nwhich the detuning in a limit becomes a Dirac delta-comb configuration with\nvariable frequency of the level-crossings. We derive the exact solution for\nthis model, determine the Floquet exponents and study the population dynamics\nin the system for various regions of the input parameters.\n", "  The Two-Higgs-Doublet model (2HDM) is a simple and viable extension of the\nStandard Model (SM) with a scalar potential complex enough that two minima may\ncoexist. In this work we investigate if the procedure to identify our vacuum as\nthe global minimum by tree-level formulas carries over to the one-loop\ncorrected potential. In the CP conserving case, we identify two distinct types\nof coexisting minima --- the regular ones (moderate $\\tan\\beta$) and the\nnon-regular ones (small or large $\\tan\\beta$) --- and conclude that the tree\nlevel expectation fails only for the non-regular type of coexisting minima. For\nthe regular type, the sign of $m^2_{12}$ already precisely indicates which\nminima is the global one, even at one-loop.\n", "  M5-branes on an ADE singularity are described by certain six-dimensional\n\"conformal matter\" superconformal field theories. Their Higgs moduli spaces\ncontain information about various dynamical processes for the M5s; however,\nthey are not directly accessible due to the lack of a Lagrangian formulation.\nUsing anomaly matching, we compute their dimensions. The result implies that M5\nfractions can recombine in several different ways, where the M5s are leaving\nbehind frozen versions of the singularity. The anomaly polynomial gives hints\nabout the nature of the freezing. We also check the Higgs dimension formula by\ncomparing it with various existing conjectures for the CFTs one obtains by\ntorus compactifications down to four and three dimensions. Aided by our\nresults, we also extend those conjectures to compactifications of theories not\npreviously considered. These involve class S theories with twisted punctures in\nfour dimensions, and affine-Dynkin-shaped quivers in three dimensions.\n", "  It is shown that the non-relativistic ground state energy of helium-like and\nlithium-like ions with static nuclei can be interpolated in full physics range\nof nuclear charges $Z$ with accuracy of not less than 6 decimal digits (d.d.)\nor 7-8 significant digits (s.d.) using a meromorphic function in appropriate\nvariable with a few free parameters. It is demonstrated that finite nuclear\nmass effects do not change 4-5 s.d. for $Z \\in [1,50]$ for 2-,3-electron\nsystems and the leading relativistic and QED corrections leave unchanged 3-4\ns.d. for $Z \\in [1,12]$ in the ground state energy for 2-electron system, thus,\nthe interpolation reproduces definitely those figures. A meaning of proposed\ninterpolation is in a construction of unified, {\\it two-point} Pade approximant\n(for both small and large $Z$ expansions) with fitting some parameters at\nintermediate $Z$.\n", "  Water keeps puzzling scientists because of its numerous properties which\nbehave oppositely to usual liquids: for instance, water expands upon cooling,\nand liquid water is denser than ice. To explain this anomalous behaviour,\nseveral theories have been proposed, with different predictions for the\nproperties of supercooled water (liquid at conditions where ice is more\nstable). However, discriminating between those theories with experiments has\nremained elusive because of spontaneous ice nucleation. Here we measure the\nsound velocity in liquid water stretched to negative pressure, and derive an\nexperimental equation of state, which reveals compressibility anomalies. We\nshow by rigorous thermodynamic relations how these anomalies are intricately\nlinked with the density anomaly. Some features we observe are necessary\nconditions for the validity of two theories of water.\n", "  We propose a novel class of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories as\nan extension of mimetic gravity. By performing a noninvertible conformal\ntransformation on \"seed\" scalar-tensor theories which may be nondegenerate, we\ncan generate a large class of theories with at most three physical degrees of\nfreedom. We identify a general seed theory for which this is possible.\nCosmological perturbations in these extended mimetic theories are also studied.\nIt is shown that either of tensor or scalar perturbations is plagued with\ngradient instabilities, except for a special case where the scalar\nperturbations are presumably strongly coupled, or otherwise there appear ghost\ninstabilities.\n", "  An axiomatization of the so-called Teleparallel Equivalent to General\nRelativity is presented. A set of formal and semantic postulates are elaborated\nfrom where the physical meaning of various key concepts of the theory are\nclarified. These concepts include those of inertia, Lorentz and diffeomorphism\ninvariance, and reference frame. It is shown that Teleparallel Gravity admits a\nwider representation of space-time than General Relativity, allowing to define\nproperties of the gravitational field such as energy and momentum that are\nusually considered problematic. In this sense, although the dynamical equations\nof both theories are equivalent, their inequivalence from a physical point of\nview is demonstrated. Finally, the axiomatic formulation is used to compare\nTeleparallel Gravity with other theories of gravity based on absolute\nparallelism such as non-local and f(T) gravity.\n", "  While the Higgs characterisation programme is well underway, direct signs for\nnew physics beyond the Standard Model remain elusive. Performing a fit of fully\ndifferential Higgs production cross sections at the LHC to a subset of\nHiggs-relevant effective operators, we discuss the extent to which theoretical\nuncertainties can limit the sensitivity in such a new physics search programme.\nExtending the dimension-6 Higgs Effective Field Theory framework by introducing\nnew light degrees of freedom that can contribute to an invisible (or\nundetectable) Higgs decay width $h \\to \\phi\\phi$, we show how differential\ncoupling fits can disentangle effects from non-Standard Model couplings and an\ninvisible decay width, as present in many new physics scenarios, such as\nHiggs-portal dark matter. Including the so-called off-shell measurement that\nhas been advocated as a sensitive determination of the Higgs width in the\n$\\kappa$ framework, we show explicitly that this method does not provide\ncomplementary sensitivity for scale-separated new physics $\\Lambda\\gg m_h \\gg\nm_\\phi$, which is favoured in beyond the Standard Model scenarios that relate\nastrophysics and collider phenomenology in light of non-observation of new\nphysics during run 1 of the LHC.\n", "  Recent developments in bigravity allow one to construct consistent theories\nof interacting spin-2 particles that are free of ghosts. In this framework, we\npropose an elementary spin-2 dark matter candidate with a mass well below the\nTeV scale. We show that, in a certain regime where the interactions induced by\nthe spin-2 fields do not lead to large departures from the predictions of\ngeneral relativity, such a light dark matter particle typically self-interacts\nand undergoes self-annihilations via 3-to-2 processes. We discuss its\nproduction mechanisms and also identify the regions of the parameter space\nwhere self-interactions can alleviate the discrepancies at small scales between\nthe predictions of the collisionless dark matter paradigm and cosmological\nN-body simulations.\n", "  We apply the method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to nonequilibrium systems.\nFor unitary dynamics, the system Hamiltonian is separated into two parts. One\nof them defines the adiabatic states for the state to follow and the\nnonadiabatic transitions are prevented by the other part. This property is\nimplemented to the nonequilibrium entropy production and we find that the\nentropy is separated into two parts. The separation represents the Pythagorean\ntheorem for the Kullback-Leibler divergence and an information-geometric\ninterpretation is obtained. We also study a lower bound of the entropy, which\nis applied to derive a trade-off relation between time, entropy and state\ndistance.\n", "  The Kerr black hole is stationary and axisymmetric, which leads to\nconservation of energy and azimuthal angular momentum along the orbits of free\ntest particles in its vicinity, but also to conservation laws for the evolution\nof continuum matter fields. However, the Kerr space-time possesses an\nadditional \"hidden symmetry\" which exhibits itself in an unexpected conserved\nquantity along geodesics known as the Carter constant. We investigate the\npossibility of using this hidden symmetry to obtain conservation laws and other\nidentities which could be used to test astrophysical simulations of the\nevolution of matter fields near spinning black holes. After deriving such\nidentities, we set up a simple numerical toy model on which we demonstrate how\nthey can detect the violations of evolution equations in a numerical\nsimulation. Even though one of the expressions we derive is in the form of a\nconservation law, we end up recommending an equivalent but simpler expression\nthat is not in the form of a conservation law for practical implementation.\n", "  We investigated magnetic and thermodynamic properties of $S$ = 1/2\nquasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet KCuMoO$_4$(OH) through single crystalline\nmagnetization and heat capacity measurements. At zero field, it behaves as a\nuniform $S$ = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet with $J$ = 238 K, and exhibits a\ncanted antiferromagnetism below $T_\\mathrm{N}$ = 1.52 K. In addition, a\nmagnetic field $H$ induces the anisotropy in magnetization and opens a gap in\nthe spin excitation spectrum. These properties are understood in terms of an\neffective staggered field induced by staggered g-tensors and\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions. Temperature-dependencies of the heat\ncapacity and their field variations are consistent with those expected for\nquantum sine-Gordon model, indicating that spin excitations consist of soliton,\nanti-soliton and breather modes. From field-dependencies of the soliton mass,\nthe staggered field normalized by the uniform field $c_\\mathrm{s}$ is estimated\nas 0.041, 0.174, and 0.030, for $H \\parallel a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively.\nSuch a large variation of $c_\\mathrm{s}$ is understood as the combination of\nstaggered g-tensors and DM interactions which induce the staggered field in the\nopposite direction for $H \\parallel a$ and $c$ but almost the same direction\nfor $H \\parallel b$ at each Cu site.\n", "  We study the exclusive production of scalar $S = 0^{++}$ and tensor $T =\n2^{++}$ mesons through single-photon annihilation $e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma^* \\to\n\\gamma S(T)$. Using QCD compositeness of the involved hadrons considered as\nquark-antiquark systems, the prediction for the scaling of the differential\ncross sections of these processes is $d\\sigma/dt \\sim 1/s^3$ at large $s$. We\nfurther derive the scaling of the $\\gamma^\\ast \\to \\gamma S$ and $\\gamma^\\ast\n\\to \\gamma T$ transition form factors: $F_{\\gamma^\\ast\\gamma S}(s) \\sim 1/s$\nand $F_{\\gamma^\\ast\\gamma T}(s) \\sim 1/s^2$. Results for the respective cross\nsections of the scalar and tensor meson production are presented. Note, when\nscalar and tensor mesons are considered as tetraquark systems of two tightly\nbound color diquarks, corresponding to them transition form factors and\ndifferential cross sections have the same falloffs as in case of\nquark-antiquark picture. For other tetraquark or two-hadron molecules\nconfigurations the transition form factors $F_{\\gamma^\\ast\\gamma S(T)}(s)$ and\nthe differential cross section $d\\sigma/dt$ have additional $1/s$ and $1/s^2$\nfalloffs, respectively.\n", "  Of all $B \\to D \\overline{D}$ decays, the $B^0 \\to D^0 \\overline{D^0}$ decay\nhas the smallest observed branching ratio as it takes place primarily via the\nsuppressed $W$-exchange diagram. The $CP$ asymmetry for this mode is yet to be\nmeasured experimentally. By exploiting the relationship among the decay\namplitudes of $B \\to D\\overline{D}$ decays (using isospin and topological\namplitudes) we are able to relate the $CP$ asymmetries and branching ratios by\na simple expression. This enables us to predict the $CP$ asymmetry $C_{00}$ in\n$B^0 \\to D^0 \\overline{D^0}$. While the predicted central values of $C_{00}$\nare outside the physically allowed region, they are currently associated with\nlarge uncertainties owing to the large errors in the measurements of the $B^0\n\\to D^0 \\overline{D^0}$ branching ratio ($B_{00}$), the other $CP$ asymmetries\n$C_{+-}$ (of $B^0 \\to D^+ D^-$) and $A_{\\text{CP}}$ (of $B^+ \\to D^+\n\\overline{D^0}$). With a precise determination of $B_{00}$, $C_{+-}$ and\n$A_{\\text{CP}}$, one can use our analytical result to predict $C_{00}$ with a\nreduced error and compare it with the experimental measurement when it becomes\navailable. The correlation between $B_{00}$ and $C_{00}$ is an interesting\naspect that can be probed in ongoing and future particle physics experiments\nsuch as LHCb and Belle II.\n", "  We study the $\\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal Chern-Simons matter field theory\n(the ABJM theory) conformally coupled to a Lorentzian, curved background\nspacetime. To support rigid supersymmetry, such backgrounds have to admit\ntwistor spinors. At the classical level, the symmetry of the theory can be\ndescribed by a conformal symmetry superalgebra. We show that the full\n$\\mathcal{N}=6$ superconformal algebra persists at the quantum level using the\nBV-BRST method.\n", "  We investigate the variation of the charged anti-de Sitter black hole under\ncharged particle absorption by considering thermodynamic volume. The variation\nexactly corresponds to that expected as the first law of thermodynamics.\nNevertheless, we find the decrease of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for\nextremal and near-extremal black holes under the absorption to be an\nirreversible process. This violation of the second law of thermodynamics is\nonly found in the case considering thermodynamic volume. We test the weak\ncosmic censorship conjecture affected by the violation. Fortunately, the\nconjecture is still valid. However, extremal and near-extremal black holes do\nnot change their configurations under the absorption. This is quite different\nfrom the case without thermodynamic volume.\n", "  We consider a gated one-dimensional (1D) quantum wire disturbed in a\ncontactless manner by an alternating electric field produced by a tip of a\nscanning probe microscope. In this schematic 1D electrons are driven not by a\npulling electric field but rather by a non-stationary spin-orbit interaction\n(SOI) created by the tip. We show that a charge current appears in the wire in\nthe presence of the Rashba SOI produced by the gate net charge and image\ncharges of 1D electrons induced on the gate (iSOI). The iSOI contributes to the\ncharge susceptibility by breaking the spin-charge separation between the\ncharge- and spin collective excitations, generated by the probe. The velocity\nof the excitations is strongly renormalized by SOI, which opens a way to\nfine-tune the charge and spin response of 1D electrons by changing the gate\npotential. One of the modes softens upon increasing the gate potential to\nenhance the current response as well as the power dissipated in the system.\n", "  Oscillation of particles in a dust crystal formed in a low-pressure\nradio-frequency gas discharge under microgravity conditions is studied.\nAnalysis of experimental data obtained in our previous study shows that the\noscillations are highly isotropic and nearly homogeneous in the bulk of a dust\ncrystal; oscillations of the neighboring particles are significantly\ncorrelated. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of the particle\nradius-vector along with the local particle number density fully define the\ncoupling parameter of the particle subsystem. The latter proves to be of the\norder of 100, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the coupling\nparameter estimated for the Brownian diffusion of particles with the gas\ntemperature. This means significant kinetic overheating of particles under\nstationary conditions. A theoretical interpretation of the large amplitude of\noscillation implies the increase of particle charge fluctuations in the dust\ncrystal. The theoretical estimates are based on the ionization equation of\nstate for the complex plasma and the equation for the plasma perturbation\nevolution. They are shown to match the results of experimental data processing.\nEstimated order of magnitude of the coupling parameter accounts for the\nexistence of the solid-liquid phase transition observed for similar systems in\nexperiments.\n", "  Local Group (LG) galaxies have relatively accurate SFHs and metallicity\nevolution derived from resolved CMD modeling, and thus offer a unique\nopportunity to explore the efficacy of estimating stellar mass M$_{\\star}$ of\nreal galaxies based on integrated stellar luminosities. Building on the SFHs\nand metallicity evolution of 40 LG dwarf galaxies, we carried out a\ncomprehensive study of the influence of SFHs, metallicity evolution, and dust\nextinction on the UV-to-NIR color-$M/L$\n(color-log$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$)) relations and M$_{\\star}$ estimation\nof local universe galaxies. We find that: The LG galaxies follow\ncolor-log$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$) relations that fall in between the ones\ncalibrated by previous studies; Optical color-log$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$)\nrelations at higher metallicities ([M/H]) are generally broader and steeper;\nThe SFH \"concentration\" does not significantly affect the\ncolor-log$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$) relations; Light-weighted ages and [M/H]\ntogether constrain log$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$) with uncertainties ranging\nfrom $\\lesssim$ 0.1 dex for the NIR up to 0.2 dex for the optical passbands;\nMetallicity evolution induces significant uncertainties to the optical but not\nNIR $\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$) at given light-weighted ages and [M/H]; The\n$V$ band is the ideal luminance passband for estimating\n$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($\\lambda$) from single colors, because the combinations of\n$\\Upsilon_{\\star}$($V$) and optical colors such as $B-V$ and $g-r$ exhibit the\nweakest systematic dependence on SFHs, [M/H] and dust extinction; Without any\nprior assumption on SFHs, M$_{\\star}$ is constrained with biases $\\lesssim$ 0.3\ndex by the optical-to-NIR SED fitting. Optical passbands alone constrain\nM$_{\\star}$ with biases $\\lesssim$ 0.4 dex (or $\\lesssim$ 0.6 dex) when dust\nextinction is fixed (or variable) in SED fitting. [abridged]\n", "  The spinel/perovskite heterointerface $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ hosts a\ntwo-dimensional electron system (2DES) with electron mobilities exceeding those\nin its all-perovskite counterpart LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ by more than an order of\nmagnitude despite the abundance of oxygen vacancies which act as electron\ndonors as well as scattering sites. By means of resonant soft x-ray\nphotoemission spectroscopy and \\textit{ab initio} calculations we reveal the\npresence of a sharply localized type of oxygen vacancies at the very interface\ndue to the local breaking of the perovskite symmetry. We explain the\nextraordinarily high mobilities by reduced scattering resulting from the\npreferential formation of interfacial oxygen vacancies and spatial separation\nof the resulting 2DES in deeper SrTiO$_3$ layers. Our findings comply with\ntransport studies and pave the way towards defect engineering at interfaces of\noxides with different crystal structures.\n", "  Bottomonium and charmonium, representing quarkonia states, are scrutinized\nunder the point of view of the information theory, in the AdS/QCD holographic\nsetup. A logarithmic measure of information, comprised by the configurational\nentropy, is here employed to quantitatively study quarkonia radially excited\nS-wave states. The configurational entropy provides data regarding the relative\ndominance and the abundance of the bottomonium and charmonium states, whose\nunderlying information is more compressed, in the Shannon's theory meaning. The\nderived configurational entropy, therefore, identifies the lower\nphenomenological prevalence of higher S-wave resonances and higher masses\nquarkonia in Nature.\n", "  We derive water vapor column abundances and aerosol properties from Mars\nScience Laboratory (MSL) ChemCam passive mode observations of scattered sky\nlight.\n  Each ChemCam passive sky observation acquires spectra at two different\nelevation angles. We fit these spectra with a discrete-ordinates multiple\nscattering radiative transfer model, using the correlated-k approximation for\ngas absorption bands. The retrieval proceeds by first fitting the continuum of\nthe ratio of the two elevation angles to solve for aerosol properties, and then\nfitting the continuum-removed ratio to solve for gas abundances. The final step\nof the retrieval makes use of the observed CO2 absorptions and the known CO2\nabundance to correct the retrieved water vapor abundance for the effects of the\nvertical distribution of scattering aerosols and to derive an aerosol scale\nheight parameter.\n  The ChemCam-retrieved water abundances show, with only a few exceptions, the\nsame seasonal behavior and the same timing of seasonal minima and maxima as the\nTES, CRISM, and REMS-H data sets that we compare them to. However\nChemCam-retrieved water abundances are generally lower than zonal and regional\nscale from-orbit water vapor data, while at the same time being significantly\nlarger than pre-dawn REMS-H abundances. Pending further analysis of REMS-H\nvolume mixing ratio uncertainties, the differences between ChemCam and REMS-H\npre-dawn mixing ratios appear to be much too large to be explained by large\nscale circulations and thus they tend to support the hypothesis of substantial\ndiurnal interactions of water vapor with the surface. Our preliminary aerosol\nresults, meanwhile, show the expected seasonal pattern in dust particle size\nbut also indicate a surprising inter-annual increase in water-ice cloud\nopacities.\n", "  We investigate the correlation between the frequencies of the twin kilohertz\nquasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) and the neutron star (NS) spins in low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), based on the data sets of 12 sources with\nsimultaneously detected twin kHz QPOs and NS spins, and find that the histogram\nof the ratio between the frequency difference of twin kHz QPOs ({\\Delta}{\\nu} =\n{\\nu}2 - {\\nu}1) and NS spin {\\nu}s shows a non-uniform distribution with a gap\nat {\\Delta}{\\nu}/{\\nu}s ~ 0.65. We try to classify the 12 sources into two\ncategories according to this gap: (I) The slow rotators with <{\\nu}s> ~ 311 Hz,\nXTE J1807.4-294, 4U 1915-05, IGR J17191-2821, 4U 1702-43, 4U 1728-34 and 4U\n0614+09 follow a relation {\\Delta}{\\nu}/{\\nu}s > 0.65; (II) The fast rotators\nwith <{\\nu}s> ~ 546 Hz, SAX J1808.4-3658, KS 1731-260, Aql X-1, 4U 1636-53, SAX\nJ1750.8-2900 and 4U 1608-52 satisfy the relation {\\Delta}{\\nu}/{\\nu}s < 0.65.\nHowever, the linear fittings of {\\Delta}{\\nu} versus {\\nu}s relations of group\n(I) and (II) are unsatisfactory to ensure any certain correlations. We suggest\nthat this phenomenon may arise from the fact that most measured kHz QPOs and\nspins satisfy the conditions of 1.1 {\\nu}s < {\\nu}2 < 1300Hz and {\\Delta}{\\nu}\ndecreasing with {\\nu}2. Apparently, the diversified distribution of\n{\\Delta}{\\nu}/{\\nu}s refutes the simple beat-frequency model, and the\nstatistical correlations between the twin kHz QPOs and NS spins may arise from\nthe magnetosphere-disk boundary environments, e.g., co-rotation radius and NS\nradius, that modulate the occurrences of X-ray signals. Furthermore, we also\nfind that the distribution of the ratio of {\\nu}2 to {\\nu}1 clusters around the\nvalue of <{\\nu}2/{\\nu}1> ~ 3 : 2, which shows no obvious correlation with NS\nspins.\n", "  The relative importance of micelle solubilization and Krafft temperature on\nthe appraisal of the flocculation rate is studied using a dodecane-in-water\nnanoemulsion as a model system. In 0.5 mM solutions of sodium dodecylsulfate\n(SDS), neither the critical micelle concentration (CMC) nor the Krafft point of\nthe surfactant are attained between 300 and 700 mM NaCl and 20 < T < 25\n{\\deg}C. Hence, the addition of salt to a SDS-stabilized nanoemulsion only\ninduces aggregation. Conversely, a surfactant concentration of 7.5 mM SDS\npromotes micelle solubilization or crystal precipitation depending on the\nphysicochemical conditions. Solubilization decreases the absorbance of the\nsystem while flocculation and Krafft precipitation increase it. In this paper,\nthe actual variation of the absorbance above the CMC was followed during five\nminutes for 300, 500 and 700 mM NaCl. The initial 60-second changes were used\nto determine apparent aggregation rates. The solubilization capacity of the\nsystems was appraised using plots of absorbance vs. volume fraction of oil for\ndifferent salt concentrations and observation times. The variation of the\nKrafft point as a function of the salt concentration was also studied using\nsurfactant solutions and emulsions. Finally, small-scale simulations accounting\nfor micelle solubilization were implemented in order to advance in the\ncomprehension of the problem.\n", "  Periodically driven systems are a common topic in modern physics. In optical\nlattices specifically, driving is at the origin of many interesting phenomena.\nHowever, energy is not conserved in driven systems, and under periodic driving,\nheating of a system is a real concern. In an effort to better understand this\nphenomenon, the heating of single-band systems has been studied, with a focus\non disorder- and interaction-induced effects, such as many-body localisation.\nNevertheless, driven systems occur in a much wider context than this, leaving\nroom for further research. Here, we fill this gap by studying a non-interacting\nmodel, characterised by discrete, periodically spaced energy levels that are\nunbounded from above. We couple these energy levels resonantly through a\nperiodic drive, and discuss the heating dynamics of this system as a function\nof the driving protocol. In this way, we show that a combination of stimulated\nemission and absorption causes the presence of resonant stable states. This\nwill serve to elucidate the conditions under which resonant driving causes\nheating in quantum systems.\n", "  We investigate the observational constraints on the cosmic neutrino\nbackground (CNB) given by the extended $\\Lambda$CDM scenario ($\\Lambda$CDM $+\nN_{\\rm eff} + \\sum m_{\\nu} + c^2_{\\rm eff} + c^2_{\\rm vis} + \\xi_{\\nu}$) using\nthe latest observational data from \\textit{Planck} CMB (temperature power\nspectrum, low-polarisation and lensing reconstruction), baryon acoustic\noscillations (BAOs) , the new recent local value of the Hubble constant\nfrom\\textit{ Hubble Space Telescope} (\\textit{HST}) and information of the\nabundance of galaxy clusters (GCs). We study the constraints on the CNB\nbackground using CMB + BAO + \\textit{HST} data with and without the GC data. We\nfind $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} = 0.614 \\pm 0.26$ at 68 per cent confidence level when\nthe GC data are added in the analysis. We do not find significant deviation for\nsound speed in the CNB rest frame. We also analyze the particular case\n$\\Lambda$CDM $+ N_{\\rm eff} + \\sum m_{\\nu} + \\xi_{\\nu}$ with the observational\ndata. Within this scenario, we find $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff} = 0.60 \\pm 0.28$ at 68\nper cent confidence level. In both the scenarios, no mean deviations are found\nfor the degeneracy parameter.\n", "  The effective masses of the neutral mesons in a hadronic medium and under an\nexternal magnetic field are evaluated as functions of the baryonic density and\nthe field intensity. For this purpose the meson polarization is evaluated in\nthe one loop approximation using a Quantum Hadrodynamics model which includes\npions, sigma, omega, and rho mesons. The propagators of the baryons include the\nfull effect of the coupling to the magnetic field through their charges and\ntheir anomalous magnetic moments. Within the range of magnetic intensities\nconsidered here $10^{17}$ G $< B < 10^{19}$ G, the dependence on B is moderate\nfor the pion and the longitudinal component of the omega meson, and negligible\nfor the remaining mesons.\n", "  We consider the Cavalcanti-Foster-Fuwa-Wiseman inequality~\\cite{achsh} which\nis a necessary and sufficient steerability condition for two-qubit states with\ntwo measurement settings on each side. We derive the criterion which an\narbitrary two-qubit state must satisfy in order to violate this inequality, and\nobtain its maximum attainable violation in quantum mechanics. The derived\ncondition on the state parameters enables us to establish a tight monogamy\nrelation for two-qubit steering.\n", "  We provide a covariant framework to study classically the stability of small\nperturbations on the so-called gonihedric string model by making precise use of\nvariational techniques. The local action depends of the square root of the\nquadratic mean extrinsic curvature of the worldsheet swept out by the string,\nand is reparametrization invariant. A general expression for the worldsheet\nperturbations, guided by Jacobi equations without any early gauge fixing, is\nobtained. This is manifested through a set of highly coupled nonlinear\ndifferential partial equations where the perturbations are described by scalar\nfields, $\\Phi^i$, living in the worldsheet. This model contains, as a special\nlimit, to the linear model in the mean extrinsic curvature. In such a case the\nJacobi equations specialize to a single wave-like equation for $\\Phi$.\n", "  The interplay between gravity, turbulence and the magnetic field determines\nthe evolution of the molecular ISM and the formation of the stars. In spite of\ngrowing interests, there remains a lack of understanding of the importance of\nmagnetic field over multiple scales. We derive the magnetic energy spectrum --\na measure that constraints the multi-scale distribution of the magnetic energy,\nand compare it with the gravitational energy spectrum derived in Li \\& Burkert\n(2016). In our formalism, the gravitational energy spectrum is purely\ndetermined by the surface density PDF, and the magnetic energy spectrum is\ndetermined by both the surface density PDF and the magnetic-field-density\nrelation. If regions have density PDFs close to $P(\\Sigma)\\sim \\Sigma^{-2}$ and\na universal magnetic field-density relation $B\\sim \\rho^{1/2}$, we expect a\nmulti-scale near equipartition between gravity and the magnetic fields. This\nequipartition is found to be true in NGC6334 where estimates of magnetic fields\nover multiple scales (from 0.1 pc to a few parsec) are available. However, the\ncurrent observations are still limited in sample size. In the future, it is\nnecessary to obtain multi-scale measurements of magnetic fields from different\nclouds with different surface density PDFs and apply our formalism to further\nstudy the gravity-magnetic field interplay.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem of the\nKundu-Eckhaus equation on the half-line by using of the Fokas unified transform\nmethod. Assuming that the solution $u(x,t)$ exists, we show that it can be\nexpressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem\nformulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $\\lambda$. Moreover,\nwe also get there exist spectral functions are not independent and they are\nsatisfying the so-called global relation.\n", "  The phase diagram of the quasi-one-dimensional magnet NaCuMoO$_4$(OH) is\nestablished through single-crystal NMR and heat-capacity measurements. The\n$^{23}$Na and $^1$H NMR experiments indicate a spiral and a collinear\nspin-density-wave (SDW) order below and above $B_c$ = 1.5-1.8 T, respectively.\nMoreover, in the paramagnetic state above the SDW transition temperature, the\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ indicates anisotropic spin\nfluctuations that have gapped excitations in the transverse spectrum but\ngapless ones in the longitudinal spectrum. These static and dynamic properties\nare well described by a theoretical model assuming quasi-one-dimensional chains\nwith competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions $J_1$ and\nantiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions $J_2$ ($J_1$-$J_2$\nchains). Because of the excellent crystal quality and good one dimensionality,\nNaCuMoO$_4$(OH) is a promising compound to elucidate the unique physics of the\nfrustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ chain.\n", "  We review some applications of the method of electronic searching for\nhistorical observations of sunspots and aurorae in the Chinese text corpus by\nHayakawa et al. etc. However, we show strong shortcomings in the digital search\ntechnique as applied by them: almost all likely true sunspot and aurora records\nwere presented before (e.g. Xu et al. 2000), which is not mentioned in those\npapers; the remaining records are dubious and often refer to other phenomena,\nneither spots nor aurorae (this also applies to Hayakawa et al. 2017c). Most of\nthe above publications include very few Chinese texts and translations, and\ntheir tables with abbreviated keywords do not allow the reader to consider\nalternative interpretations (the tables also do not specify which records\nmention night-time). We have compared some of their event tables with\npreviously published catalogs and found various discrepancies. There are also\nintrinsic inconsistencies, misleading information (lunar phase for day-time\nevents), and dating errors. We present Chinese texts and translations for some\nof their presumable new aurorae: only one can be considered a likely true\naurora (AD 604 Jan); some others were selected on the sole basis of the use of\nthe word \"light\" or \"rainbow\". Several alleged new aurorae present observations\nbeside the Sun during day-time. There are well-known comets among their\npresumable aurorae. We also discuss, (i) whether \"heiqi ri pang\" can stand for\nblack spot(s) \"on one side of\" or \"beside\" the sun, (ii) aurora color confusion\nin Hayakawa et al. (2015, 2016), and (iii) whether \"white\" and \"unusual\nrainbows\" can be aurorae.\n", "  Investigating the gravitational field in the early-type galaxies (ETGs, i.e.\nellipticals and lenticulars) up to large radii is observationally difficult. It\nis questionable how the radial acceleration (RAR) in the ETGs looks like, i.e.\nthe relation between the dynamically inferred gravitational acceleration and\nthe acceleration expected from the distribution of the visible matter. This\nrelation is nearly universal for the spiral galaxies, in agreement with the\nMOND modified dynamics paradigm. In this contribution, we investigate a sample\nof 15 ETGs. We extract their full kinematic profiles out to several effective\nradii from their globular cluster systems and estimate their gravitational\nfield using the Jeans equation. We parametrize the gravitational field by that\nproduced by the stars and a Navarro-Frenk-White DM halo. We find that only 4-5\nof our ETGs follow the RAR for the spiral galaxies. All these galaxies are fast\nrotators, have disky isophotes, appear mostly very elongated and the have\nbluest colors in our sample. This suggests that they might be spiral galaxies\nwhich lost their gas. Our galaxies deviating from the RAR for the spirals\neither disprove MOND, contain unobserved matter, or indicate a flaw in the\nmethod.\n", "  We study a system of branching Brownian motions on $\\mathbb R$ with\nannihilation: at each branching time a new particle is created and the leftmost\none is deleted. In [7] it has been studied the case of strictly local creations\n(the new particle is put exactly at the same position of the branching\nparticle), in [10] instead the position $y$ of the new particle has a\ndistribution $p(x,y)dy$, $x$ the position of the branching particle, however\nparticles in between branching times do not move. In this paper we consider\nBrownian motions as in [7] and non local branching as in [10] and prove\nconvergence in the continuum limit (when the number $N$ of particles diverges)\nto a limit density which satisfies a free boundary problem when this has\nclassical solutions, local in time existence of classical solution has been\nproved recently in [13]. We use in the convergence a stronger topology than in\n[7] and [10] and have explicit bounds on the rate of convergence.\n", "  We prove that ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians on an infinite spin\nchain can be efficiently approximated by matrix product states with a bond\ndimension which scales as D~(L-1)/epsilon, where any local quantity on L\nconsecutive spins is approximated to accuracy epsilon.\n", "  We generalize the theory of nuclear decay and capture of Gamow that is based\non tunneling through the barrier and internal oscillations inside the nucleus.\nIn our formalism an additional factor is obtained, which describes distribution\nof the wave function of the $\\alpha$ particle inside the nuclear region. We\ndiscover new most stable states (called quasibound states) of the compound\nnucleus (CN) formed during the capture of $\\alpha$ particle by the nucleus.\nWith a simple example, we explain why these states cannot appear in traditional\ncalculations of the $\\alpha$ capture cross sections based on monotonic\npenetrabilities of a barrier, but they appear in a complete description of the\nevolution of the CN. Our result is obtained by a complete description of the CN\nevolution, which has the advantages of (1) a clear picture of the formation of\nthe CN and its disintegration, (2) a detailed quantum description of the CN,\n(3) tests of the calculated amplitudes based on quantum mechanics (not realized\nin other approaches), and (4) high accuracy of calculations (not achieved in\nother approaches). These peculiarities are shown with the capture reaction of\n$\\alpha + ^{44}{\\rm Ca}$. We predict quasibound energy levels and determine\nfusion probabilities for this reaction. The difference between our approach and\ntheory of quasistationary states with complex energies applied for the $\\alpha$\ncapture is also discussed. We show (1) that theory does not provide\ncalculations for the cross section of $\\alpha$ capture (according to modern\nmodels of the $\\alpha$ capture), in contrast with our formalism, and (2) these\ntwo approaches describe different states of the $\\alpha$ capture (for the same\n$\\alpha$-nucleus potential).\n", "  Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a powerful tool that allows calculating\nderivatives of implemented algorithms with respect to all of their parameters\nup to machine precision, without the need to explicitly add any additional\nfunctions. Thus, AD has great potential in quantum chemistry, where gradients\nare omnipresent but also difficult to obtain, and researchers typically spend a\nconsiderable amount of time finding suitable analytical forms when implementing\nderivatives. Here, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation can be used to\ncompute gradients with respect to any parameter throughout a complete quantum\nchemistry method. We implement DiffiQult, a fully autodifferentiable\nHartree-Fock (HF) algorithm, which serves as a proof-of-concept that\nillustrates the capabilities of AD for quantum chemistry. We leverage the\nobtained gradients to optimize the parameters of one-particle basis sets in the\ncontext of the floating Gaussian framework.\n", "  We consider the possibility of a gravitational wave signal in an asymmetric\ndark matter model. In this model a generative sector produces both the baryon\nasymmetry and a dark matter asymmetry in a strong first-order phase transtion.\nBubble collisions during the phase transition lead to sound waves in the plasma\nwhich are a source of a stochastic gravitational wave background. We consider\nthe prospects of future graviational wave observatories such as LISA and BBO\ndetecting such a signal. Constraints on the model from Halo ellipticity,\n$\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ and direct detection experiments are also discussed.\n", "  We consider spacelike warped AdS$_{3}$ black hole metric in Boyer-Lindquist\ncoordinate system. We present a coordinates transformation so that it maps\nmetric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates to the one in Gaussian null coordinates.\nThen we introduce new fall-off conditions near the horizon of non-extremal\nwarped black holes. We study the near horizon symmetry algebra of such\nsolutions in the context of Generalized minimal massive gravity. Similar to the\nblack flower solutions, also we obtain the Heisenberg algebra as the near\nhorizon symmetry algebra of the warped black flower solutions. We show that the\nvacuum state and all descendants of the vacuum have the same energy. Thus these\nzero energy excitations on the horizon appear as soft hairs on the warped black\nhole.\n", "  We present a tensor constitutive model for predicting stress and flow-induced\nstructure formation in dilute wormlike micellar solutions. The micellar\nsolution is treated as a dilute suspension of rigid Brownian rods whose length\nvaries dynamically. Consistent with the mechanism presented by Turner and Cates\n[J. Phys.:~Condens. Matter 4, 3719 (1992)], flow-induced alignment of the rods\nis assumed to promote increase of rod length that corresponds to the formation\nof flow-induced structures observed in experiments. At very high deformation\nrate, hydrodynamic stresses causes the rod length to decrease. These mechanisms\nare implemented in a phenomenological equation governing the evolution of rod\nlength, with the number density of rods appropriately modified to ensure\nconservation of surfactant mass. The model leads first to an increase in both\nshear and extensional viscosity as deformation rate increases and then to a\ndecrease at higher rates. If the rate constant for flow-induced rod growth is\nsufficiently large, the model predicts a multivalued relation between stress\nand deformation rate in both shear and uniaxial extension. Predictions for\nshear and extensional flow at steady state are in reasonable agreement with\nexperimental results. By design, the model is simple enough to serve as a\ntractable constitutive relation for computational fluid dynamics studies.\n", "  The Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA) plays an exceptional role in the modern\nnuclear engineering, especially in detection of hazardous substances. However,\nin the aquatic environment, there are still many problems to be solved for\neffective usage of this technique. We present status of SABAT (Stoichiometry\nAnalysis By Activation Techniques), one of the projects aiming at construction\nof an underwater device for non-invasive threat detection based on the NAA.\n", "  We present total and linearly polarized 3 mm Global mm-VLBI Array images of a\nsample of blazars and radio galaxies from the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR 7 mm monitoring\nprogram designed to probe the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\njets and locate the sites of gamma-ray emission observed by the Fermi-LAT. The\nlower opacity at 3 mm and improved angular resolution, on the order of 50\nmicroarcseconds, allow us to distinguish features in the jet not visible in the\n7 mm VLBA data. We also compare two different methods used for the calibration\nof instrumental polarisation and we analyze the resulting images for some of\nthe sources in the sample.\n", "  We investigate the effect of dimensional crossover in the ground state of the\nantiferromagnetic spin-$1$ Heisenberg model on the anisotropic triangular\nlattice that interpolates between the regime of weakly coupled Haldane chains\n($J^{\\prime}\\! \\!\\ll\\!\\! J$) and the isotropic triangular lattice\n($J^{\\prime}\\!\\!=\\!\\!J$). We use the density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) and Schwinger boson theory performed at the Gaussian correction level\nabove the saddle-point solution. Our DMRG results show an abrupt transition\nbetween decoupled spin chains and the spirally ordered regime at\n$(J^{\\prime}/J)_c\\sim 0.42$, signaled by the sudden closing of the spin gap.\nComing from the magnetically ordered side, the computation of the spin\nstiffness within Schwinger boson theory predicts the instability of the spiral\nmagnetic order toward a magnetically disordered phase with one-dimensional\nfeatures at $(J^{\\prime}/J)_c \\sim 0.43$. The agreement of these complementary\nmethods, along with the strong difference found between the intra- and the\ninterchain DMRG short spin-spin correlations; for sufficiently large values of\nthe interchain coupling, suggests that the interplay between the quantum\nfluctuations and the dimensional crossover effects gives rise to the\none-dimensionalization phenomenon in this frustrated spin-$1$ Hamiltonian.\n", "  V-telluride superlattice thin films have shown promising performance for\non-chip cooling devices. Recent experimental studies have indicated that device\nperformance is limited by the metal/semiconductor electrical contacts. One\nchallenge in realizing a low resistivity contacts is the absence of fundamental\nknowledge of the physical and chemical properties of interfaces between metal\nand V-telluride materials. Here we present a combination of experimental and\ntheoretical efforts to understand, design and harness low resistivity contacts\nto V-tellurides. Ab initio calculations are used to explore the effects of\ninterfacial structure and chemical compositions on the electrical contacts, and\nan ab initio based macroscopic model is employed to predict the fundamental\nlimit of contact resistivity as a function of both carrier concentration and\ntemperature. Under the guidance of theoretical studies, we develop an\nexperimental approach to fabricate low resistivity metal contacts to\nV-telluride thin film superlattices, achieving a 100-fold reduction compared to\nprevious work. Interfacial characterization and analysis using both scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy show\nthe unusual interfacial morphology and the potential for further improvement in\ncontact resistivity. Finally, we harness the improved contacts to realize an\nimproved high-performance thermoelectric cooling module.\n", "  The optical and Boltzmann conductivities have been calculated for doped\nbuckled honeycomb lattice structures such as silicene and germanene, as\nfunctions of temperature. By making use of previous results for the\ntemperature-dependent chemical potential for gapped Dirac systems, we have\ncalculated the dynamical polarization function and investigated the way in\nwhich initial doping affects its behavior at arbitrary temperature, frequency\nand wave number. We have calculated the optical and Boltzmann conductivities in\nthe relaxation time approximation. Both these quantities are directly related\nto the polarizability, with the former being proportional to its\nlong-wavelength limit, whereas the latter depends on static screening and the\ncorresponding dielectric function. We demonstrated that initial doping\nsubstantially increases each type of conductivity at intermediate temperatures\nand we have introduced a formalism for calculating the inverse relaxation time\nand transition rates for the two inequivalent subbands in silicene.\n", "  Secondary {\\gamma}-rays from intergalactic cascades may contribute to\nobservable spectra of blazars, also modifying observable angular and temporal\ndistributions. In this paper we briefly review basic features of intergalactic\nelectromagnetic cascade physics, suggest a new approximation for {\\gamma}-ray\nmean free path, consider angular patterns of magnetically broadened cascade\nemission, and present an example of a fit to the observable blazar spectrum.\n", "  The Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology (SEXTANT) is\na technology demonstration enhancement to the Neutron Star Interior Composition\nExplorer (NICER) mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2017 and will be\nhosted as an externally attached payload on the International Space Station\n(ISS). During NICER's 18-month baseline science mission to understand\nultra-dense matter through observations of neutron stars in the soft X-ray\nband, SEXTANT will, for the first-time, demonstrate real-time, on-board X-ray\npulsar navigation. Using NICER/SEXTANT as an example, we describe the factors\nthat determine the measurement errors on pulse times of arrival, including\nsource and background count rates, and pulse profile shapes. We then describe\nproperties of the SEXTANT navigation pulsar catalog and prospects for growing\nit once NICER launches. Finally, we describe the factors affecting the\nprediction of pulse arrival times in advance, including variable interstellar\npropagation effect and red timing noise. Together, all of these factors\ndetermine how well a particular realization of an X-ray pulsar-based navigation\nsystem will perform.\n", "  Using atomistic Monte Carlo simulations, we investigated the impact of the\ninterface on the structural properties of iron and copper (Fe/Cu) magnetic\nmultilayers grown by Vorono\\\"i diagram. Interest in magnetic multilayers has\nrecently emerged as they are shown to be promising candidates for magnetic\nstorage media, magneto-resistive sensors, and personalized medical treatment.\nAs these artificial materials show large differences in properties compared to\nconventional ones, many experimental and theoretical works have been dedicated\non shedding light on these differences and tremendous results have emerged.\nHowever, little is known how the interfaces influence the structure of the\nlayers around them. By a numerical approach, we show that the structure of each\nlayer depends on its thickness and the interface morphology. The Fe and Cu\nlayers can adopt either the body-centered-cubic (bcc) or face-centered-cubic\n(fcc) structure, while the interface can assume amorphous, bcc, fcc, or a\nmixture of bcc and fcc structures depending on the layer thicknesses. These\nresults are in good agreement with the experiments. They could be helpful in\nunderstanding effects such as giant magneto-resistance from the structural\nviewpoint.\n", "  The Galilean covariance, formulated in 5-dimensions space, describes the\nnon-relativistic physics in a way similar to quantum field theory. Using a\nnon-relativistic approach the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the Casimir effect at\nfinite temperature for a particle with spin zero and $1/2$ are calculated. The\nThermo Field Dynamics is used to calculate the temperature effect.\n", "  A kinetic Monte Carlo approach is applied to studying shape instability of\nnanowires that results in their breaking up into chains of nanoparticles. Our\napproach can be used to explore dynamical features of the process that\ncorrespond to experimental findings, but that cannot be interpreted by\ncontinuum mechanisms reminiscent of the description of the Plateau-Rayleigh\ninstability in liquid jets. For example, we observe long-lived dumbbell-type\nfragments and other typical non-liquid-jet characteristics of the process, as\nwell as confirm the observed lattice-orientation dependence of the breakup\nprocess of single-crystal nanowires. We provide snapshots of the process\ndynamics, and elaborate on the nanowire-end effects, as well as on the\nmorphology of the resulting nanoparticles.\n", "  We study approach to the large-time jammed state of the deposited particles\nin the model of random sequential adsorption. The convergence laws are usually\nderived from the argument of Pomeau which includes the assumption of the\ndominance, at large enough times, of small landing regions into each of which\nonly a single particle can be deposited without overlapping earlier deposited\nparticles and which, after a certain time are no longer created by depositions\nin larger gaps. The second assumption has been that the size distribution of\ngaps open for particle-center landing in this large-time small-gaps regime is\nfinite in the limit of zero gap size. We report numerical Monte Carlo studies\nof a recently introduced model of random sequential adsorption on patterned\none-dimensional substrates that suggest that the second assumption must be\ngeneralized. We argue that a region exists in the parameter space of the\nstudied model in which the gap-size distribution in the Pomeau large-time\nregime actually linearly vanishes at zero gap sizes. In another region, the\ndistribution develops a threshold property, i.e., there are no small gaps below\na certain gap size. We discuss the implications of these findings for new\nasymptotic power-law and exponential-modified-by-a-power-law convergences to\njamming in irreversible one-dimensional deposition.\n", "  The advent of space-based photometry provides the opportunity for the first\nprecise characterizations of variability in Mercury-Manganese (HgMn/CP3) stars,\nwhich might advance our understanding of their internal structure. We have\ncarried out a spectroscopic and photometric investigation of the candidate CP3\nstar KIC 6128830. A detailed abundance analysis based on newly-acquired\nhigh-resolution spectra was performed, which confirms that the star's abundance\npattern is fully consistent with its proposed classification. Photometric\nvariability was investigated using four years of archival Kepler data. In\nagreement with results from the literature, we have identified a single\nsignificant and independent frequency $f_1$=0.2065424 d$^{-1}$ with a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of $\\sim$3.4 mmag and harmonic frequencies up to $5f_1$.\nDrawing on the predictions of state-of-the-art pulsation models and information\non evolutionary status, we discuss the origin of the observed light changes.\nOur calculations predict the occurrence of g-mode pulsations at the observed\nvariability frequency. On the other hand, the strictly mono-periodic nature of\nthe variability strongly suggests a rotational origin. While we prefer the\nrotational explanation, the present data leave some uncertainty.\n", "  A quick look at research and development in astronomy shows that we live in\nexciting times. Exoplanetary systems, supernovae, and merging binary black\nholes were far out of reach for observers two decades ago and now such\nphenomena are recorded routinely. This quick development would not have been\npossible without the ability for researchers to be connected, to think globally\nand to be mobile. Classical short-term positions are not always suitable to\nsupport these conditions and freelancing may be a viable alternative. We\nintroduce the Astroserver framework, which is a new freelancing platform for\nscientists, and demonstrate through examples how it contributed to some recent\nprojects related to hot subdwarf stars and binaries. These contributions, which\nincluded spectroscopic data mining, computing services and observing services,\nas well as artwork, allowed a deeper look into the investigated systems. The\nwork on composite spectra binaries provided new details for the hypervelocity\nwide subdwarf binary PB 3877 and found diverse and rare systems with sub-giant\ncompanions in high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. The models for the\npeculiar abundance pattern of the evolved compact star LP 40-365 showed it to\nbe a bound hypervelocity remnant of a supernova Iax event. Some of these works\nalso included data visualizations to help presenting the new results. Such\nservices may be of interest for many researchers.\n", "  The Particle Flow Algorithms adopted for future $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders\ndetectors and phase-II CMS upgrade require very high granularity calorimeters\nto deconvolve the individual contributions of particles in jets. This is\nespecially true for electromagnetic calorimeters (ECAL). For a realistic large\ndetector many technological requirements have to be fulfilled: modularity for\nindustrialization; compact integration of an embedded very front-end\nelectronics featuring large dynamics, low-power and self-triggering; mechanical\nstructure and cooling systems with minimal dead zones. The technological\nprototype of the silicon-tungsten (SiW) ECAL presented here should achieve all\nthis. 10 layers are produced and tested in beam, while design and optimization\nstudies are ongoing on a variety of simulated key processes to test the\nperformance of the hardware and the algorithms.\n", "  The $\\mathcal{KS}$ map is revisited in terms of an $S^1$-action in\n$T^*\\mathbb{H}_0$ with the bilinear function as the associated momentum map.\nIndeed, the $\\mathcal{KS}$ transformation maps the $S^1$-fibers related to the\nmentioned action to single points. By means of this perspective a second\ntwin-bilinear function is obtained with an analogous $S^1$-action. We also show\nthat the connection between the 4-D isotropic harmonic oscillator and the\nspatial Kepler systems can be done in a straightforward way after\nregularization and through the extension to 4 degrees of freedom of the Euler\nangles, when the bilinear relation is imposed. This connection incorporates\nboth bilinear functions among the variables. We will show that an alternative\nregularization separates the oscillator expressed in Projective Euler\nvariables. This setting takes advantage of the two bilinear functions and\nanother integral of the system including them among a new set of variables that\nallows to connect the 4-D isotropic harmonic oscillator and the planar Kepler\nsystem. In addition, our approach makes transparent that only when we refer to\nrectilinear solutions, both bilinear relations defining the $\\mathcal{KS}$\ntransformations are needed.\n", "  The Sun is expected to increase its radiant output by about 10% per billion\nyears. The rate at which the radius of the Earth's orbit would need to increase\nin order to keep the present value of the Sun's radiant flux at the Earth\nconstant is calculated. The mechanical power required to achieve this is also\ncalculated. Remarkably, this is a small fraction (2.3%) of the total solar flux\ncurrently intercepted by the Earth. Treating the Earth itself as a rocket, the\nthrust required to increase the orbit is found, as well as the rate of mass\nejection. The Earth has sufficient mass to maintain this rate for several\nbillion years, allowing for the possibility that the Earth could remain\nhabitable to biological life for billions of years into the future.\n", "  To enable the enhancement of few-cycle pulses in high-finesse passive optical\nresonators, a novel complementary-phase approach is considered for the\nresonator mirrors. The design challenges and first experimental results are\npresented.\n", "  We provide a unified presentation of extensions of the Minimal Dark Matter\nframework in which new fermionic electroweak multiplets are coupled to each\nother via the Standard Model Higgs doublet. We study systematically the generic\nfeatures of all the possibilities, starting with a singlet and two doublets\n(akin to Bino-Higgsino dark matter) up to a Majorana quintuplet coupled to two\nWeyl quadruplets. We pay special attention to this last case, since it has not\nyet been discussed in the literature. We estimate the parameter space for\nviable dark matter candidates. This includes an estimate for the mass of a\nquasi-pure quadruplet dark matter candidate taking into account the Sommerfeld\neffect. We also argue how the coupling to the Higgs can bring the Minimal Dark\nMatter scenario within the reach of present and future direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  In the present paper, we study a new type of large-scale instability, which\narises in obliquely rotating electroconductive fluids with a small-scale\nexternal force of zero helicity. This force excites small-scale velocity\noscillations with a small Reynolds number. We used the method of multiscale\nasymptotic expansions. The nonlinear equations for vortex and magnetic\nperturbations motions are obtained up to third order in Reynolds number. The\nlinear stage of the magneto-vortex dynamo, arising as a result of instabilities\nof the type of hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic $\\alpha $ - effects, is\ninvestigated. Stationary solutions of nonlinear equations of magneto-vortex\ndynamo in the form of localized chaotic structures are found numerically.\n", "  To investigate the possible origin and mechanism of ferroelectricity in\npolycrystalline spin ices Ho2Ti2O7 and Dy2Ti2O7 a detailed dielectric study has\nbeen performed. Experimental finding suggests that both materials have two\nprominent diffuse ferroelectric phase transitions around 90K and 36K. These\ntransitions are distinctly generated by the lattice distortions at the oxygen\nsites as confirmed by triggered distortions and order of activation energy. Due\nto the incompatibility of the gyrotropic order with any phonon mode at the\nBrillouin zone center, observed diffuse ferroelectric phase transitions can\nhave only an electronic origin. Through magnetic susceptibility and previously\nreported spin relaxation behavior it has been concluded that single ion\nanisotropy has thermal variation, due to which orientation of rare earth\nmagnetic moment from isotropic non-Ising to Ising spin along local <111>axis\ntakes place. This spin orientation distinctly distorting the both oxygen sites\nof the structure reflects in the form of diffuse ferroelectric phase\ntransitions.\n", "  We propose a geometric setting of the axiomatic mathematical formalism of\nquantum theory. Guided by the idea that understanding the mathematical\nstructures of these axioms is of similar importance as was historically the\nprocess of understanding the axioms of geometry, we complete the spaces of\nobservables and of states in a similar way as in classical geometry linear or\naffine spaces are completed by projective spaces. In this sense, our theory can\nbe considered as a \"completion of usual linear quantum theory\" , such that the\nusual theory appears as the special case where a reference frame is fixed once\nand for all. In the present first part, this general setting is explained.\nDynamics (time evolution) will be discussed in subsequent work.\n", "  We develop a \"minimal\" microscopic model to describe a\ntwo-pulse-Ramsay-interferometer-based scheme of measurement of the photon\nrecoil momentum in a Bose-Einstein condensate of a dilute gas [Campbell et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 94, 170403 (2005)]. We exploit the truncated coupled\nMaxwell-Schroedinger equations to elaborate the problem. Our approach provides\na theoretical tool to reproduce essential features of the experimental results.\nAdditionally, we enable to calculate the quantum-mechanical mean value of the\nrecoil momentum and its statistical distribution that provides a detailed\ninformation about the recoil event.\n", "  Applying the approximate DFT-1/2 quasiparticle scheme, band structure\nunfolding, and generalized quasichemical approximation to describe chemical and\nstructural disorder, we investigate the electronic structure of\nBi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ alloys from first principles. We calculate the important\nenergy levels near the Fermi energy versus the Sb concentration $x$ where the\ntrivial-topological (TT) and semimetal-semiconductor (SMSC) transitions occur.\nWe demonstrate that the energy variation of the relevant states deviates\nsignificantly from linear behavior and that the bowings are important to\ncorrectly describe the critical compositions. The influence of strain on the\nenergy levels is briefly discussed. It is concluded that the type or sign of\nstrain applied on antimony atoms during the growth of the alloy should be\nheavily dependent on its composition.\n", "  Suspensions of unicellular microswimmers such as flagellated bacteria or\nmotile algae exhibit spontaneous density heterogeneities at large enough\nconcentrations. Based on the relative location of the biological actuation\nappendages i.e. flagella or cilia) microswimmers' propulsion mechanism can be\nclassified into two categories: (i) pushers, like \\textit{E. coli} bacteria or\nspermatozoa, that generate thrust in their rear, push fluid away from them and\npropel themselves forward; (ii) pullers, like the microalgae\n\\textit{Chlamydomonas reinhardtii}, that have two flagella attached to their\nfront, pull the fluid in and thereby generate thrust in their front. We\nintroduce a novel model for biological microswimmers that creates the flow\nfield of the corresponding microswimmers, and takes into account the shape\nanisotropy of the swimmer's body and stroke-averaged flagella. By employing\nmultiparticle collision dynamics, we directly couple the swimmer's dynamics to\nthe fluid's. We characterize the nonequilibrium phase diagram, as the filling\nfraction and P\\'eclet number are varied, and find density heterogeneities in\nthe distribution of both pullers and pushers, due to hydrodynamic\ninstabilities. We find a maximum degree of clustering at intermediate filling\nfractions and at large P\\'eclet numbers resulting from a competition of\nhydrodynamic and steric interactions between the swimmers. We develop an\nanalytical theory that supports these results. This maximum might represent an\noptimum for the microorganisms' colonization of their environment.\n", "  Excitons dominate the optical properties of monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs). Besides optically accessible bright exciton states,\nTMDs exhibit also a multitude of optically forbidden dark excitons. Here, we\nshow that efficient exciton-phonon scattering couples bright and dark states\nand gives rise to an asymmetric excitonic line shape. The observed asymmetry\ncan be traced back to phonon-induced sidebands that are accompanied by a\npolaron redshift. We present a joint theory-experiment study investigating the\nmicroscopic origin of these sidebands in different TMD materials taking into\naccount intra- and intervalley scattering channels opened by optical and\nacoustic phonons. The gained insights contribute to a better understanding of\nthe optical fingerprint of these technologically promising nanomaterials.\n", "  We investigate the diffusive magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas residing in a wrinkled nanostructure. The curved geometry of the\nnanostructure renders an effective inhomogeneous magnetic field which, in\nturns, yields Weiss oscillations. Since the relative strength of the effective\ninhomogeneous magnetic field can be tailored by changing the direction of the\nexternally applied magnetic field, these Weiss oscillations exhibit a strong\ndirectional dependence. For large external magnetic fields we also find an\nanisotropic positive magnetoresistance.\n", "  In this work, we present the results of our multi-band microvariability study\nof the famous blazar BL Lac. We performed microvariablity observations of the\nsource in the optical VRI bands for 4 nights in the year 2016. We studied the\nintranight flux and spectral variability of the source in detail with an\nobjective to characterize microvariability in the blazars, a frequently\nobserved phenomenon in blazars. The results show that the source often displays\na fast flux variability with an amplitude as large as ~ 0.2 magnitude within a\nfew hours, and that the color variability in the similar time scales can be\ncharacterized as \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend. We also observed markedly curved\noptical spectrum during one of the nights. Furthermore, the correlation between\nmulti-band emission shows that in general the emission in all the bands are\nhighly correlated; and in one of the nights V band emission was found to lead\nthe I band emission by ~ 20 minutes. The search for characteristic timescale\nusing auto-correlation function and the structure function analyses reveals\ncharacteristic timescale of ~ 48 minutes in one of the R band observations. We\ntry to explain the observed results in the context of the passage of shock\nwaves through the relativistic outflows in blazars.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection (MR) in collisionless plasma is often attributed to the\noff-diagonal electron Reynolds stress, which can give rise to a large induction\nelectric field in the reconnection region. However, in magneto-hydro-dynamics\n(MHD) simulations of MR, it is difficult to implement the full Reynolds stress,\nwhich is kinetic in nature. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model of\neffective resistivity from the first principle of particle dynamics. The\nderived theoretical formulation of the effective resistivity is verified by\nfull particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and the corresponding physics is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present a two-dimensional (2D) lattice model that exhibits a nontrivial\ntopological phase in the absence of the Berry curvature. Instead, the Berry\nconnection provides the topological nontrivial phase in the model, whose\nintegration over the momentum space, the so-called 2D Zak phase, yields a\nfractional wave polarization in each direction. These fractional wave\npolarizations manifest themselves as degenerated edge states with opposite\nparities in the model.\n", "  In many approaches to describe physics beyond the standard model, light\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (named axion-like particles or ALPS for their similarity\nwith the axion) are predicted to exist. For ALPs with a mass of neV,\nphoton-ALPs oscillation takes place in extra-galactic magnetic fields during\nthe propagation of very high energy gamma-ray photons leading to excess\nradiation observed for optically thick sources. In order to verify this effect,\ngamma-ray spectra from strong Galactic plane or non-galactic plane sources can\nbe used and the photon-ALPs mixing would lead to an energy dependent\nsuppression of the observed gamma-ray spectra. Here, we have used Fermi-LAT\nobservations of a sample of non Galactic plane gamma-ray pulsars located at\ndifferent line-of-sights to search for spectral signatures and compare the\nresult with the predictions using particular models for the Galactic magnetic\nfield.We find consistent evidence with our prevoius analysis of objects located\nin the Galactic plane for a modulation of the spectra investigated at the level\nof 3.66 standard deviations . In the framework of ALPS-photon oscillation, the\nresulting parameters strongly depend upon the chosen magnetic field model, but\nseem to be within reach of new experiments(e.g. IAXO).\n", "  Existing security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) suffer from two\nfundamental weaknesses. First, memory attacks have emerged as an important\nthreat to the security of even device-independent quantum key distribution\n(DI-QKD), whenever QKD devices are re-used. This type of attacks constitutes an\nexample of covert channels, which have attracted a lot of attention in security\nresearch in conventional cryptographic and communication systems. Second, it is\noften implicitly assumed that the classical post-processing units of a QKD\nsystem are trusted. This is a rather strong assumption and is very hard to\njustify in practice. Here, we propose a simple solution to these two\nfundamental problems. Specifically, we show that by using verifiable secret\nsharing and multiple optical devices and classical post-processing units, one\ncould re-establish the security of QKD. Our techniques are rather general and\nthey apply to both DI-QKD and non-DI-QKD.\n", "  A key goal in quantum chemistry methods, whether ab initio or otherwise, is\nto achieve size consistency. In this manuscript we formulate the related idea\nof \"Casimir-Polder size consistency\" that manifests in long-range dispersion\nenergetics. We show that local approximations in time-dependent density\nfunctional theory dispersion energy calculations violate the consistency\ncondition because of incorrect treatment of highly non-local \"xc kernel\"\nphysics, by up to 10% in our tests on closed-shell atoms.\n", "  When a fast moving star or a protostellar jet hits an interstellar cloud, the\nsurrounding gas gets heated and illuminated: a bow shock is born which\ndelineates the wake of the impact. In such a process, the new molecules that\nare formed and excited in the gas phase become accessible to observations. In\nthis article, we revisit models of H2 emission in these bow shocks. We\napproximate the bow shock by a statistical distribution of planar shocks\ncomputed with a magnetized shock model. We improve on previous works by\nconsidering arbitrary bow shapes, a finite irradiation field, and by including\nthe age effect of non-stationary C-type shocks on the excitation diagram and\nline profiles of H2. We also examine the dependence of the line profiles on the\nshock velocity and on the viewing angle: we suggest that spectrally resolved\nobservations may greatly help to probe the dynamics inside the bow shock. For\nreasonable bow shapes, our analysis shows that low velocity shocks largely\ncontribute to H2 excitation diagram. This can result in an observational bias\ntowards low velocities when planar shocks are used to interpret H2 emission\nfrom an unresolved bow. We also report a large magnetization bias when the\nvelocity of the planar model is set independently. Our 3D models reproduce\nexcitation diagrams in BHR71 and Orion bow shocks better than previous 1D\nmodels. Our 3D model is also able to reproduce the shape and width of the broad\nH2 1-0S(1) line profile in an Orion bow shock.\n", "  The Quantum Loschmidt Echo is a measurement of the sensitivity of a quantum\nsystem to perturbations of the Hamiltonian. In the case of the standard\n2-torus, we derive some explicit formulae for this quantity in the transition\nregime where it is expected to decay in the semiclassical limit. The expression\ninvolves both a two-microlocal defect measure of the initial data and the form\nof the perturbation. As an application, we exhibit a non-concentration\ncriterium on the sequence of initial data under which one does not observe a\nmacroscopic decay of the Quantum Loschmidt Echo. We also apply our results to\nseveral examples of physically relevant initial data such as coherent states\nand plane waves.\n", "  The present study theoretically predicts the effect of interfacial viscosity\non the deformation of a compound drop as well as on the bulk rheology. The\nsystem at hand comprises of a dilute emulsion of concentric compound drops,\nladen with surfactants and suspended in a linear flow. Two types of linear\nflows are considered in this study, namely, a uniaxial extensional flow and a\nsimple shear flow. Presence of surfactants along the drop surface leads to the\ngeneration of an interfacial viscosity, which is different from the bulk. This\ninterfacial viscosity generates a viscous drag that along with bulk\nflow-induced nonuniform surfactant distribution on the drop surface\nsignificantly alters drop dynamics. For the present study an asymptotic\napproach is used to solve the flow field under the limiting case of\ndiffusion-dominated-surfactant transport. Assuming the surfactants to be\nbulk-insoluble and negligible inertia to be present in fluid flow, it is shown\nthat presence of interfacial viscosity reduces the deformation of a compound\ndrop and enhances the stability of a dilute double emulsion. At the same time\nthe effective viscosity of the emulsion also increases with rise in interfacial\nviscosity. For large values of interfacial dilatational viscosity the drop\ndeformation is seen to increase and hence the stability of the double emulsion\nis questionable.\n", "  We implement an efficient numerical method to calculate response functions of\ncomplex impurities based on the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and\nuse it as the impurity-solver of the Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). This\nmethod uses the correction vector to obtain precise Green's functions on the\nreal frequency axis at zero temperature. By using a self-consistent bath\nconfiguration with very low entanglement, we take full advantage of the DMRG to\ncalculate dynamical response functions paving the way to treat large effective\nimpurities such as those corresponding to multi-orbital interacting models and\nmulti-site or multi-momenta clusters. This method leads to reliable\ncalculations of non-local self energies at arbitrary dopings and interactions\nand at any energy scale.\n", "  Proton-proton collisions at the LHC provide the ground for tests of the\nstrong interactions through the study of the production mechanisms for\nquarkonia and hadrons containing charm or beauty flavours. This review\naddresses recent results and includes studies of kinematical correlations,\npolarisation and associated production. QCD-based models are briefly discussed\nand compared to measurements.\n", "  Recent measurements of top quark properties with ${\\rm t{\\bar t}}$ events\ncollected by the ATLAS experiment in proton-proton collisions at the center of\nmass energy $\\sqrt{s}=8$ and $13$ TeV, are presented. The measurements of the\ntop quark width, spin and spin correlations, polarisation, the $W$ boson\nhelicity fractions, charge and CP asymmetries are discussed. Finally, recent\nresults obtained on colour flow effects in ${\\rm t{\\bar t}}$ events are\npresented. All the measurements are consistent with the Standard Model\nexpectations.\n", "  We present the direct observation of magnetic domain motion in permalloy\nnanowires with notches using a wide-field Kerr microscopy technique. The domain\nwall motion can be modulated by the size and shape of the notch structure in\nthe nanowires. It is demonstrated that the coercive fields can be tuned by\nmodulating the notches. The experimental results are consistent with the\nmicro-magnetic simulation results. The relationship between the notch angle and\nthe domain nuclease are also studied. This work is useful for the design and\ndevelopment of the notch-based spintronic devices.\n", "  Recasting the $N$-point one loop scalar integral from Feynman to Schwinger\nparameters gives an integrand with a Gaussian form. By application of a Fourier\ntransform, it is easy to derive explicit expressions for the two, three and\nfour-point functions. The Fourier transformation disentangles singularities in\nthe complex plane and extract their contribution as two-point functions in two\ndimensions. We explicitly derive a one dimensional expression for the (4D)\nfour-point function whose integrand involves only square root and arcsine\nfunctions. This report is a condensed version of the approach developed in\n\\cite{Benhaddou2016} which does not make use of probabilistic jargon.\n", "  The separation of $b$-quark initiated jets from those coming from lighter\nquark flavors ($b$-tagging) is a fundamental tool for the ATLAS physics program\nat the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The most powerful $b$-tagging algorithms\ncombine information from low-level taggers, exploiting reconstructed track and\nvertex information, into machine learning classifiers. The potential of modern\ndeep learning techniques is explored using simulated events, and compared to\nthat achievable from more traditional classifiers such as boosted decision\ntrees.\n", "  Infinitely rising one-dimensional potentials constitute impenetrable barriers\nwhich reflect totally any incident wave. However, the scattering by such kind\nof potentials is not structureless: resonances may occur for certain values of\nthe energy. Here we consider the problem of scattering by the members of a\nfamily of potentials $V_a(x)=-{\\rm sgn}(x)\\,|x|^a$, where sgn represents the\nsign function and $a$ is a positive rational number. The scattering function\nand the phase shifts are obtained from global solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. For the determination of the Gamow states, associated to resonances,\nwe exploit their close relation with the eigenvalues of the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians with potentials\n$V_a^{\\mathcal{PT}}(x)=-{\\rm i}\\,{\\rm sgn}(x)\\,|x|^a$. Calculation of the time\ndelay in the scattering at real energies is used to characterize the\nresonances. As an additional result, the breakdown of the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry of the family of potentials $V_a^{\\mathcal{PT}}$ for\n$a<3$ may be conjectured.\n", "  Shaking optical lattices in a resonant manner offers an efficient and\nversatile method to devise artificial gauge fields and topological band\nstructures for ultracold atomic gases. This was recently demonstrated through\nthe experimental realization of the Harper-Hofstadter model, which combined\noptical superlattices and resonant time-modulations. Adding inter-particle\ninteractions to these engineered band systems is expected to lead to\nstrongly-correlated states with topological features, such as fractional Chern\ninsulators. However, the interplay between interactions and external\ntime-periodic drives typically triggers violent instabilities and\nuncontrollable heating, hence potentially ruling out the possibility of\naccessing such intriguing states of matter in experiments. In this work, we\nstudy the early-stage parametric instabilities that occur in systems of\nresonantly-driven Bose-Einstein condensates in optical lattices. We apply and\nextend an approach based on Bogoliubov theory [PRX 7, 021015 (2017)] to a\nvariety of resonantly-driven band models, from a simple shaken Wannier-Stark\nladder to the more intriguing driven-induced Harper-Hofstadter model. In\nparticular, we provide ab initio numerical and analytical predictions for the\nstability properties of these topical models. This work sheds light on general\nfeatures that could guide current experiments to stable regimes of operation.\n", "  Starting with the idea to describe phenomenologically the particle creation\nin the strong gravitational fields, we introduced explicitly the particle\nnumber nonconservation (= creation law) into the action integral with the\ncorresponding Lagrange multiplier. Following the fundamental result by Ya. B.\nZel'dovich and A. A. Starobinsky (1977) we then postulated that the rate of\nparticle creation is proportional to the square of Weyl tensor. Concerning the\nconformal invariance, yet another question arises: how the scalar field could\nknow about the surgery made on the metric tensor (if such an invariance is the\nfundamental law of Nature and not just the mathematical exercise)? The only way\nis that the scalar field is itself the part of metric, namely, the conformal\nfactor. We showed, that such an identification results in the natural\nappearance of the quartic self-interaction term in the scalar field Lagrangian,\nwhich is needed to make particle massive. And it is just quartic, because our\nspace-time is four-dimensional.\n", "  A key issue in complex systems regards the relationship between topology and\ndynamics. In this work, we use a recently introduced network property known as\nsteering coefficient as a means to approach this issue with respect to\ndifferent directed complex network systems under varying dynamics. Theoretical\nand real-world networks are considered, and the influences of reciprocity and\naverage degree on the steering coefficient are quantified. A number of\ninteresting results are reported that can assist the design of complex systems\nexhibiting larger or smaller relationships between topology and dynamics.\n", "  The aim of this study is to investigate the magnetospheric disturbances\neffects on complicated nonlinear system of atmospheric processes. During\nsubstorms and storms, the ionosphere was subjected to rather a significant\nJoule heating, and the power of precipitating energetic particles was also\ngreat. Nevertheless, there were no abnormal variations of meteoparameters in\nthe lower atmosphere. If there is a mechanism for the powerful magnetospheric\ndisturbance effect on meteorological processes in the atmosphere, it supposes a\nmore complicated series of many intermediates, and is not associated directly\nwith the energy that arrives into the ionosphere during storms. I discuss the\nproblem of the effect of the solar wind electric field sharp increase via the\nglobal electric circuit during magnetospheric disturbances on the cloud layer\nformation.\n", "  Controlled movement of nano-scale stable magnetic objects has been proposed\nas the foundation for a new generation of magnetic storage devices. Magnetic\nskyrmions, vortex-like spin textures stabilized by their topology are\nparticularly promising candidates for this technology. Their nanometric size\nand ability to be displaced in response to an electrical current density\nseveral orders of magnitude lower than required to induce motion of magnetic\ndomain walls suggest their potential for high-density memory devices that can\nbe operated at low power. However, to achieve this, skyrmion movement needs to\nbe controlled, where a key question concerns the coupling of skyrmions with the\nunderlying atomic lattice and disorder (pinning). Here, we use Resonant\nUltrasound Spectroscopy (RUS), a probe highly sensitive to changes in the\nelastic properties, to shed new light on skyrmion elasticity and depinning in\nthe archetypal skyrmion material MnSi. In MnSi, skyrmions form a lattice that\nleads to pronounced changes in the elastic properties of the atomic lattice as\na result of magneto-crystalline coupling. Without an applied current, the shear\nand compressional moduli of the underlying crystal lattice exhibit an abrupt\nchange in the field-temperature range where skyrmions form. For current\ndensities exceeding $j_c^*$ the changes of elastic properties vanish, signaling\nthe decoupling of skyrmion and atomic lattices. Interestingly, $j_c^*$, which\nwe identify as the onset of skyrmion depinning, is about 20 times smaller than\n$j_c$ previously measured via non-linear Hall effect. Our results suggest the\npresence of a previously-undetected intermediate dynamic regime possibly\ndominated by skyrmion-creep motion with important consequences for potential\napplications.\n", "  In this study, we investigate magnetic properties of umbra of\nmagneto-conjugate leading and following sunspots, i.e. connected through\nmagnetic field lines. We established dependences between individual sunspot\numbra field characteristics, and between these characteristics on the umbra\narea ($S$) separately for sunspot pairs, for which the minimal angle between\nthe umbra magnetic field line of the leading ($L$) sunspot and the positive\nnormal line to the Sun surface is smaller, than that in the following ($F$)\nsunspot ($\\alpha_{min-L}<\\alpha_{min-F}$; such sunspot pairs are the bulk) and,\non the contrary, when $\\alpha_{min-L}>\\alpha_{min-F}$. The\n$\\alpha_{min-L}(S_L)$, $\\alpha_{min-F}(S_F)$, $B_{max-L}(S_L)$ and\n$B_{max-F}(S_F)$ dependences are shown to have similar behavior features, and\nare quantitatively close for two sunspot groups with a different asymmetry of\nthe sunspot magnetic field connecting them (here, $B_{max-L,F}(S_L)$ is the\nmagnetic induction maximum induction in umbrae of the leading and the following\nsunspots). The dependence of mean values of angles within umbra\n$<\\alpha_{L,F}>$ on the sunspot umbra area $S_{L,F}$ and on the mean value of\nmagnetic induction in umbra $<B_{L,F}>$ appeared different for two cases. Also,\nin the bulk of the investigated sunspot pairs, the leading sunspot was shown to\nappear closer to the polarity inversion line between the sunspots, than the\nfollowing one. This result and the conclusion that, in the bulk of the\ninvestigated pairs of the magnetically conjugate sunspots,\n$\\alpha_{min-L}<\\alpha_{min-F}$ are closely coupled.\n", "  Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) can successfully recover quantitative\nmulti-parametric maps of human tissue in a very short acquisition time. Due to\ntheir pseudo-random nature, the large spatial undersampling artifacts can be\nfiltered out by an exhaustive search over a pre-computed dictionary of signal\nfingerprints. This reconstruction approach is robust to large data-model\ndiscrepancies and is easy to implement. The curse of dimensionality and the\nintrinsic rigidity of such a precomputed dictionary approach can however limit\nits practical applicability. In this work, a method is presented to reconstruct\nbalanced gradient-echo (GRE) acquisitions with established iterative algorithms\nfor nonlinear least-squares, thus bypassing the dictionary computation and the\nexhaustive search. The global convergence of the iterative approach is\ninvestigated by studying the transient dynamic response of balanced GRE\nsequences and its effect on the minimization landscape. Experimental design\ncriteria are derived which enforce sensitivity to the parameters of interest\nand successful convergence. The method is validated on simulated and\nexperimentally acquired MRI data. Keywords: MR Fingerprinting, quantitative\nMRI, Bloch equation, nonlinear least squares, sequence design.\n", "  We review recent results on next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD and electroweak\n(EW) corrections for processes involving off-shell top quarks. For the\noff-shell production of two top quarks that decay leptonically, the full NLO EW\ncorrections have been computed. For the very same process in association with a\nHiggs boson, EW corrections have been calculated and combined with existing NLO\nQCD corrections. In both cases, selected differential distributions are shown.\nIn these proceedings, particular emphasis is put on the effect of the EW\ncorrections as well as the off-shell contributions.\n", "  Materials such as W, TiN, and SrRuO3 (SRO) have been suggested as promising\nalternatives to Au and Ag in plasmonic applications owing to their refractory\nproperties. However, investigation of the reproducibility of the optical\nproperties after thermal cycling at high operational temperatures is so far\nlacking. Here, thin films of W, Mo, Ti, TiN, TiON, Ag, Au, and SrRuO3 are\ninvestigated to assess their viability for robust refractory plasmonic\napplications. Films ranging in thickness from 50 - 180 nm are deposited on MgO\nand Si substrates by RF magnetron sputtering and, in the case of SrRuO3, pulsed\nlaser deposition, prior to characterisation by means of AFM, XRD, spectroscopic\nellipsometry, and DC resistivity. Measurements are conducted before and after\nannealing in air at temperatures ranging from 300 - 1000{\\deg} C for one hour,\nto establish the maximum cycling temperature and potential longevity at\ntemperature for each material. It is found that SrRuO3 retains metallic\nbehaviour after annealing at 800{\\deg} C, however, importantly, the optical\nproperties of TiN and TiON are degraded as a result of oxidation. Nevertheless,\nboth TiN and TiON may be better suited than Au or SRO for high temperature\napplications operating under vacuum conditions.\n", "  Several observed spectral properties of quasars are believed to be influenced\nby quasar orientation. In this investigation we examine the effect of\norientation on the Mg II line located at 2798 {\\AA} in a sample of 36\nradio-loud quasars, with orientation angles having been obtained in a previous\nstudy using radio observations. We find no significant relationship between\norientation angle and either Mg II line full-width at half-maximum or\nequivalent width. The lack of correlation with inclination angle contradicts\nprevious studies which also use radio data as a proxy for inclination angle and\nsuggests the Mg II emission region does not occupy a disk-like geometry. The\nlack of correlation with Mg II equivalent width, however, is reported in at\nleast one previous study. Although the significance is not very strong (86\npercent), there is a possible negative relationship between inclination angle\nand Fe II strength which, if true, could explain the Fe II anti-correlation\nwith [O III ] strength associated with Eigenvector 1. Interestingly, there are\nobjects having almost edge-on inclinations while still exhibiting broad lines.\nThis could be explained by a torus which is either clumpy (allowing sight lines\nto the central engine) or mis-aligned with the accretion disk.\n", "  The near and mid-infrared characteristics of large amplitude, Mira, variables\nin Local Group dwarf irregular galaxies (LMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, Sgr dIG) are\ndescribed. Two aspects of these variables are discussed. First, the short\nperiod (P < 420 days) Miras are potentially powerful distance indicators,\nprovided that they have low circumstellar extinction, or can be corrected for\nextinction. These are the descendants of relatively low mass stars. Secondly,\nthe longer period stars, many of which undergo hot bottom burning, are poorly\nunderstood. These provide new insight into the evolution of intermediate mass\nstars during the high mass-loss phases, but their use as distance indicators\ndepends on a much firmer understanding of their evolution.\n  The change in slope of the K period luminosity relation for O-rich stars that\nis seen around 400 to 420 days in the LMC is due to the onset of hot bottom\nburning. It will be sensitive to metallicity and should therefore be expected\nat different periods in populations with significant differences from the LMC.\n  The [4.5] period-luminosity relation splits into two approximately parallel\nsequences. The fainter one fits stars where the mid-infrared flux originates\nfrom the stellar photosphere, while the brighter one fits observations\ndominated by the circumstellar shell.\n", "  We consider the finite size effect on thermo-magnetic properties of charged\nBose gases confined in a quasi two-dimentsional potential. A modified\nsemiclassical approach is used, taking into account the finite size correction\nto guarantee an accurate density of states. The charged spinless Bose gas shows\ndiamagnetic behavior. Temperature dependent magnetization is indicated for the\ninvestigated system that condense at a resistive critical temperature in\naccordance with the applied magnetic field.\n", "  The 3D motions of stars in small galaxies beyond our own are minute and yet\nthey are crucial for our understanding of the nature of gravity and dark\nmatter. Even for the dwarf galaxy Sculptor which is one of the best studied\nsystems and inferred to be strongly dark matter dominated, there are\nconflicting reports on its mean motion around the Milky Way and the 3D internal\nmotions of its stars have never been measured. Here we report, based on data\nfrom the Gaia space mission and the Hubble Space Telescope, a new precise\nmeasurement of Sculptor's mean proper motion. From this we deduce that Sculptor\nis currently at its closest approach to the Milky Way and moving on an\nelongated high-inclination orbit that takes it much farther away than\npreviously thought. For the first time we are also able to measure the internal\nmotions of stars in Sculptor. We find $\\sigma_{R}=11.5 \\pm 4.3$ km/s and\n$\\sigma_{T}=8.5\\pm3.2$ km/s along the projected radial and tangential\ndirections, implying that the stars in our sample move preferentially on radial\norbits as quantified by the anisotropy parameter, which we find to be\n$\\beta\\sim 0.86^{+0.12}_{-0.83}$ at a location beyond the core radius. Taken at\nface value such a high radial anisotropy requires abandoning conventional\nmodels for the mass distribution in Sculptor. Our sample is dominated by\nmetal-rich stars and for these we find $\\beta^{MR} \\sim 0.95^{+0.04}_{-0.27}$,\na value consistent with multi-component models where Sculptor is embedded in a\ncuspy dark halo as expected for cold dark matter.\n", "  The NA62 experiment at CERN is designed to measure precisely the rare decay\n$K^{+} \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$. The intensity and energy of the SPS\nproton beam used to produce the $K^+$, as well as the hermetic detector\ncoverage and overall geometry, give in addition the opportunity to search for\nhypothesized weakly-coupled particles at the MeV-GeV mass scale. In these\nproceedings the focus lies on reviewing these opportunities and sketching the\ncurrent status of some pertinent searches.\n", "  We present some experimental and simulation results that reproduces the\nOstwald ripening (gas diffusion among bubbles) for air bubbles in a liquid\nfluid. Concerning the experiment, there it is measured the time evolution of\nbubbles mean radius, number of bubbles and radius size distribution. One of the\nmain results shows that, while the number of bubbles decreases in time the\nbubbles mean radius increases, hence, it follows that the smaller bubbles\ndisappear whereas the -- potentially dangerous for the diver -- larger bubbles\ngrow up. Consequently, this effect suggests a possible contribution of the\nOstwald ripening to the decompression sickness, and if so, it should be pursued\nits implementation to the Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM) so as to build\nup dive tables and computer programs for further diving tests.\n", "  We performed numerical simulations of impact crater formation on Europa to\ninfer the thickness and structure of its ice shell. The simulations were\nperformed using iSALE to test both the conductive ice shell over ocean and the\nconductive lid over warm convective ice scenarios for a variety of conditions.\nThe modeled crater depth-diameter is strongly dependent on thermal gradient and\ntemperature of the warm convective ice. Our results indicate that both a fully\nconductive (thin) shell and a conductive-convective (thick) shell can reproduce\nthe observed crater depth-diameter and morphologies. For the conductive ice\nshell over ocean, the best fit is an approximately 8 km thick conductive ice\nshell. Depending on the temperature (255 - 265 K) and therefore strength of\nwarm convective ice, the thickness of the conductive ice lid is estimated at 5\n- 7 km. If central features within the crater, such as pits and domes, form\nduring crater collapse, our simulations are in better agreement with the fully\nconductive shell (thin shell). If central features form well after the impact,\nhowever, our simulations suggest a conductive-convective shell (thick shell) is\nmore likely. Although our study does not provide firm conclusion regarding the\nthickness of Europa's ice shell, our work indicates that Valhalla-class\nmultiring basins on Europa may provide robust constraints on the thickness of\nEuropa's ice shell.\n", "  In this work we investigate a one-dimensional parity-time (PT)-symmetric\nmagnetic metamaterial consisting of split-ring dimers having gain or loss.\nEmploying a Melnikov analysis we study the existence of localized travelling\nwaves, i.e. homoclinic or heteroclinic solutions. We find conditions under\nwhich the homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits persist. Our analytical results are\nfound to be in good agreement with direct numerical computations. For the\nparticular nonlinearity admitting travelling kinks, numerically we observe\nhomoclinic snaking in the bifurcation diagram. The Melnikov analysis yields a\ngood approximation to one of the boundaries of the snaking profile.\n", "  We consider the process of reaching the final state in the coevolving voter\nmodel. There is a coevolution of state dynamics, where a node can copy a state\nfrom a random neighbor with probabilty $1-p$ and link dynamics, where a node\ncan re-wire its link to another node of the same state with probability $p$.\nThat exhibits an absorbing transition to a frozen phase above a critical value\nof rewiring probability. Our analytical and numerical studies show that in the\nactive phase mean values of magnetization of nodes $n$ and links $m$ tend to\nthe same value that depends on initial conditions. In a similar way mean\ndegrees of spins up and spins down become equal. The system obeys a special\nstatistical conservation law since a linear combination of both types\nmagnetizations averaged over many realizations starting from the same initial\nconditions is a constant of motion: $\\Lambda\\equiv (1-p)\\mu m(t)+pn(t) =\nconst$, where $\\mu$ is the mean node degree. The final mean magnetization of\nnodes and links in the active phase is proportional to $\\Lambda$ while the\nfinal density of active links is a square function of $\\Lambda$. If the\nrewiring probability is above a critical value and the system separates into\ndisconnected domains, then the values of nodes and links magnetizations are not\nthe same and final mean degrees of spins up and spins down can be different.\n", "  The noise signal of the voltage fluctuations of cathode arcs recorded at\ndifferent sampling frequencies was analyzed. To explain obtained Fourier\nspectra for each measurement, a model was developed. The characteristics of the\nmodel were obtained by comparing Fourier spectra of the developed model and\nexperimental signals. The model shows good quality agreement with the\nexperiment. The voltage signal consists of two parts: a sum of very short\n(several ns) fluctuations, related a microexplosion or ecton and a low\nfrequency part related to a random cathode spot walk.\n", "  The role of quantum groups and braid groups in the description of Standard\nModel particles is discussed. Some recent results on the use of the quantum\ngroup $SU_q(3)$ as a flavour symmetry are reviewed and a connection between two\ndescriptions of Standard Model symmetries, one based on the normed division\nalgebras and the other describing elementary matter as braided objects, is\npresented.\n", "  Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has shown its promising application in cancer\ntreatment both in vitro and in vivo. However, the anti-cancer mechanism is\nstill largely unknown. CAP may kill cancer cells via triggering the rise of\nintracellular ROS, DNA damage, mitochondrial damage, or cellular membrane\ndamage. While, the specific vulnerability of cancer cells to CAP has been\nobserved, the underlying mechanism of such cell-based specific vulnerability to\nCAP is completely unknown. Here, through the comparison of CAP treatment and\nH2O2 treatment on 10 different cancer cell lines in vitro, we observed that the\nH2O2 consumption speed by cancer cells was strongly correlated to the\ncytotoxicity of CAP treatment on cancer cells. Cancer cells that clear\nextracellular H2O2 more quickly are more resistant to the cytotoxicity of CAP\ntreatment. This finding strongly indicates that the anti-oxidant system in\ncancer cells play a key role in the specific vulnerability of cancer cells to\nCAP treatment in vitro.\n", "  Free electrons travelling in vacuum carry evanescent electric field, which\ncan only be coupled to free space light via interaction with a surrounding or\nnearby medium: as Cherenkov radiation when travelling faster than the local\nvelocity of light or as \"Smith-Purcell\" (SP) radiation when passing over the\nsurface of a grating. The SP emission characteristics of simple gratings such\nas a regular array of wires or slits are a well-understood phenomenon. Here we\nshow that for a compound grating made up of several closely-spaced slits\nrepeated for each period, the characteristic angular dispersion of\nSmith-Purcell radiation can be selectively attenuated or enhanced. We analyze,\nin particular, the change in intensity as slit elements are added to the\nstructure for two slit sizes and how this affects emission enhancement.\n", "  In General Relativity a space-time $M$ is regarded singular if there is an\nobstacle that prevents an incomplete curve in $M$ to be continued. Usually,\nsuch a space-time is completed to form $\\bar{M} = M \\cup \\partial M$ where\n$\\partial M$ is a singular boundary of $M$. The standard geometric tools on $M$\ndo not allow \"to cross the boundary\". However, the so-called Synthetic\nDifferential Geometry (SDG), a categorical version of standard differential\ngeometry based on intuitionistic logic, has at its disposal tools permitting\ndoing so. Owing to the existence of infinitesimals one is able to penetrate\n\"germs of manifolds\" that are not visible from the standard perspective. We\npresent a simple model showing what happens \"beyond the boundary\" and when the\nsingularity is finally attained. The model is purely mathematical and is\nmathematically rigorous but it does not pretend to refer to the physical\nuniverse.\n", "  For a group of the Mira-type stars, semi-regular variables and some RV Tau -\ntype stars the limit cycles were computed and plotted using the phase plane\ndiagrams. As generalized coordinates x and $\\dot{x},$ we have used $\\phi$ - the\nbrightness of the star and its phase derivative. We have used mean phase light\ncurves using observations of various authors from the databases of AAVSO,\nAFOEV, VSOLJ, ASAS and approximated using a trigonometric polynomial of\nstatistically optimal degree. As generalized coordinates x and $\\dot{x}$, we\nhave used m - the brightness of the star and its phase derivative. For a simple\nsine-like light curve, the limit cycle is a simple ellipse. In a case of more\ncomplicated light curve, in which harmonics are statistically significant, the\nlimit cycle has deviations from the ellipse. In an addition to a classical\nanalysis, we use the error estimates of the smoothing function and its\nderivative to constrain an \"error corridor\" in the phase plane.\n", "  The early universe is dominated by phenomena at high temperatures. The\nthermal effects decrease during evolution of the universe. However there are\nsome phenomena, such as processes inside stars and black holes, where the role\nof the temperature is important. Study of processes involving gravitons at\nfinite temperature is a viable means to understand gravitational processes in\nthe universe. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics formalism transition amplitudes\ninvolving gravitons and fermions at finite temperature are calculated. In this\napproach our results consist of two parts: one corresponding to the zero\ntemperature part and the other corresponding to a temperature dependent part.\n", "  The CFETR baseline scenario is based on a H-mode equilibrium with high\npedestal and highly peaked edge bootstrap current, along with strong reverse\nshear in safety factor profile. The stability of ideal MHD modes for the CFETR\nbaseline scenario has been evaluated using NIMROD and AEGIS codes. The toroidal\nmode numbers (n=1-10) are considered in this analysis for different positions\nof perfectly conducting wall in order to estimate the ideal wall effect on the\nstability of ideal MHD modes for physics and engineering designs of CFETR.\nAlthough, the modes (n=1-10) are found to be unstable in ideal MHD, the\nstructure of all modes is edge localized. Growth rates of all modes are found\nto be increasing initially with wall position before they reach ideal wall\nsaturation limit (no wall limit). No global core modes are found to be\ndominantly unstable in our analysis. The design of $q_{min}>2$ and strong\nreverse shear in $q$ profile is expected to prevent the excitation of global\nmodes. Therefore, this baseline scenario is considered to be suitable for\nsupporting long time steady state discharge in context of ideal MHD physics, if\nELMs could be controlled.\n", "  Ideal MHD stability of China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) upgrade\nphase-I baseline scenario has been evaluated using the initial value code\nNIMROD. The toroidal mode numbers for n=1-30 have been considered for stability\nanalysis both in single-fluid and two-fluid MHD models. Our calculation rusults\nshow that all modes are found to be unstable with characteristics of\nedge-localized modes. For n $\\leq$ 13 modes, two-fluid MHD model gives a\nslightly higher growth rates than single-fluid MHD model, while for n $>$ 13\nmodes, this trend becomes opposite, which means two-fluid MHD model is needed\nfor high-n mode analysis. In addition, $n=1-10$ modes are found to be more\nunstable with increasing wall position and eventually their growth rates\napproach values in the no-wall limit.\n", "  We discover that some of the broad absorption lines (BALs) are actually a\ncomplex of narrow absorption lines (NALs). As a pilot study of this type of\nBAL, we show this discovery through a typical example in this paper. Utilizing\nthe two-epoch observations of J002710.06-094435.3 (hereafter J0027-0944) from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find that each of the C IV and Si IV\nBAL troughs contains at least four NAL doublets. By resolving the Si IV BAL\ninto multiple NALs, we present the following main results and conclusions.\nFirst, all these NALs show coordinated variations between the two-epoch SDSS\nobservations, suggesting that they all originate in the quasar outflow, and\nthat their variations are due to global changes in the ionization condition of\nthe absorbing gas. Secondly, a BAL consisting of a number of NAL components\nindicates that this type of BAL is basically the same as the intrinsic NAL,\nwhich tends to support the inclination model rather than the evolution model.\nThirdly, although both the C IV and Si IV BALs originate from the same clumpy\nsubstructures of the outflow, they show different profile shapes: multiple\nabsorption troughs for the Si IV BAL in a wider velocity range, while P-Cygni\nfor the C IV BAL in a narrower velocity range. This can be interpreted by the\nsubstantial differences in fine structure and oscillator strength between the\nSi IV {\\lambda}{\\lambda}1393, 1402 and C IV {\\lambda}{\\lambda}1548, 1551\ndoublets. Based on the above conclusions, we consider that the decomposition of\na BAL into NALs can serve as a way to resolve the clumpy structure for\noutflows, and it can be used to learn more about characteristics of the clumpy\nstructure and to test the outflow model, when utilizing high-resolution spectra\nand photoionization model.\n", "  After the recent historical discovery of gravitational wave, it is curious to\nspeculate upon the detection prospect of the quantum graviton in the\nterrestrial accelerator-based experiment. We carefully investigate the \"golden\"\nchannels, $J/\\psi(\\Upsilon)\\to\\gamma+\\text{graviton}$, which can be pursued at\n\\textsf{BESIII} and \\textsf{Belle 2} experiments, by searching for\nsingle-photon plus missing energy events. Within the effective field theory\n(EFT) framework of General Relativity (GR) together with Nonrelativistic QCD\n(NRQCD), we are capable of making solid predictions for the corresponding decay\nrates. It is found that these extremely suppressed decays are completely\nswamped by the Standard Model background events $J/\\psi (\\Upsilon)\\to\n\\gamma+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$. Meanwhile, we also study these rare decay processes in\nthe context of massive gravity, and find the respective decay rates in the\nlimit of vanishing graviton mass drastically differ from their counterparts in\nGR. Counterintuitive as the failure of smoothly recovering GR results may look,\nour finding is reminiscent of the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov (vDVZ) discontinuity\nwidely known in classical gravity, which can be traced to the finite\ncontribution of the helicity-zero graviton in the massless limit. Nevertheless,\nat this stage we are not certain about the fate of the discontinuity\nencountered in this work, whether it is merely a pathology or not. If it could\nbe endowed with some physical significance, the future observation of these\nrare decay channels, would, in principle, shed important light on the nature of\ngravitation, whether the graviton is strictly massless, or bears a very small\nbut nonzero mass.\n", "  Multivariate techniques based on engineered features have found wide adoption\nin the identification of jets resulting from hadronic top decays at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). Recent Deep Learning developments in this area include\nthe treatment of the calorimeter activation as an image or supplying a list of\njet constituent momenta to a fully connected network. This latter approach\nlends itself well to the use of Recurrent Neural Networks. In this work the\napplicability of architectures incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks is explored. Several network architectures, methods of ordering of jet\nconstituents, and input pre-processing are studied. The best performing LSTM\nnetwork achieves a background rejection of 100 for 50% signal efficiency. This\nrepresents more than a factor of two improvement over a fully connected Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) trained on similar types of inputs.\n", "  Biological materials achieve directional reinforcement with oriented\nassemblies of anisotropic building blocks. One such example is the\nnanocomposite structure of keratinized epithelium on the toe pad of tree frogs,\nin which hexagonal arrays of (soft) epithelial cells are crossed by densely\npacked and oriented (hard) keratin nanofibrils. Here, a method is established\nto fabricate arrays of tree-frog-inspired composite micropatterns composed of\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars embedded with polystyrene (PS)\nnanopillars. Adhesive and frictional studies of these synthetic materials\nreveal a benefit of the hierarchical and anisotropic design for both adhesion\nand friction, in particular, at high matrix-fiber interfacial strengths. The\npresence of PS nanopillars alters the stress distribution at the contact\ninterface of micropillars and therefore enhances the adhesion and friction of\nthe composite micropattern. The results suggest a design principle for\nbioinspired structural adhesives, especially for wet environments.\n", "  Over the last few decades, the nature of scientific research has changed in\nresponse to external influences. Firstly, powerful networked computers have\nbecome a standard tool. Secondly, society presses ever harder for research to\ndeliver something \"useful\" back to society, both through the kinds of funding\nopportunities that are made available, and through a critical public eye. Many\nfunding agencies now demand \"deliverables\" that seem to select research of a\nparticular kind. Lastly, teamwork, often within very large projects, has become\ncommonplace.\n  Here, we step back and ask how prospective research scientists might select\nproductive research projects in this evolving environment. We hope that our\nsuggestions might also help to improve public understanding and thereby restore\nflagging faith in science.\n", "  If the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the only new physics\naround the TeV-scale, it has to account for the entire dark matter relic\ndensity, or else it will cease to be `minimal'. We use this expectation to\nobtain the best quantitative explanation of the galactic centre $\\gamma$-ray\nexcess. The $\\gamma$-ray data/flux limits from other astrophysical sources are\nalso taken into account, together with all laboratory constraints. The lower\nlimit on the relic density, together with the latest direct dark matter search\nconstraints and the shape of the galactic centre $\\gamma$-ray spectrum, makes\nthe MSSM fits appear rather poor. A comparison with similar fits of the Higgs\nboson mass from indirect and direct search results makes one suspicious that\nthe MSSM is not a good explanation of data related to dark matter.\n", "  We implement a mechanism - originally proposed as a model for the large\nmemory storage capacity of black holes - in quantum neural networks and show\nthat an exponentially increased capacity of pattern storage and recognition is\nachieved in certain critically excited states, without involvement of synaptic\nplasticity. We consider a simple network of N interconnected quantum neurons\nwith weak excitatory synaptic connections. We show that for frozen synaptic\nweights there exist the critical states of enhanced memory storage capacity.\nThese states are achieved thanks to the high excitation levels of some of the\nneurons, which - despite of feeble synaptic connections - dramatically lower\nthe response threshold of the remaining weaker-excited neurons. As a results,\nthe latter neurons acquire a capacity to store an exponentially large number of\npatterns within a narrow energy gap. The stored patterns can be recognized and\nretrieved with perfect response under the influence of arbitrarily soft input\nstimuli. In sharp contrast, under the same stimuli the recall is absent in the\nground-state of the system. The lesson is that the state with the highest\nmicro-state entropy and memory storage capacity is not necessarily a local\nminimum of energy, but rather an excited critical state. The considered\nphenomenon has a smooth classical limit and can serve for achieving an enhanced\nmemory storage capacity in classical brain networks.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration intense radio flares\noccurring at cosmological distances. Many models have been proposed to explain\nthese topical astronomical events, but none has so far been confirmed. Here we\nshow that a novel way involving enhanced giant radio pulses from a rapidly\nspun-up neutron star near a spinning black hole can explain the main properties\nof non-repeating FRBs. Independent observations of such pulses, which are not\nenhanced, from some Galactic pulsars make our model reliable. If correct, our\nmodel would imply the existence of event horizons, the Lense-Thirring effect,\nand a significant spin energy extraction from a black hole. Moreover, an FRB\nwould then probe the pulsar magnetosphere and its emission, and map the strong\ngravity region near a black hole. Besides, our model predicts simultaneous\ndetections of FRBs and gravitational waves from black hole -- neutron star\nmergers for fortuitously nearby FRB events.\n"]}
