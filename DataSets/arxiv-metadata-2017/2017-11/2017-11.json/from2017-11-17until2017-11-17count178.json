Within the framework of classical error models, the\ndependent variable relates to the independent variable according to the usual\nadditive model. The classes of linear models considered are regression lines in\nthe limit of uncorrelated errors in X and in Y. For homoscedastic data, the\nresults are taken from earlier attempts and rewritten using a more compact\nnotation. For heteroscedastic data, the results are inferred from a procedure\nrelated to functional models. An example of astronomical application is\nconsidered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H] empirical relations deduced from five\nsamples related to different stars and/or different methods of oxygen abundance\ndetermination. For low-dispersion samples and assigned methods, different\nregression models yield results which are in agreement within the errors for\nboth heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data, while the contrary holds for\nlarge-dispersion samples. In any case, samples related to different methods\nproduce discrepant results, due to the presence of (still undetected)\nsystematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can be made at\npresent. Asymptotic expressions approximate regression line slope and intercept\nvariance estimators, for normal residuals, to a better extent with respect to\nearlier attempts. Related fractional discrepancies are not exceeding a few\npercent for low-dispersion data, which grows up to about 10% for\nlarge-dispersion data. An extension of the formalism to generic structural\nmodels is left to a forthcoming paper.\n", "  The energy loss of $\\beta^-$ emission emitting from a 63-Ni source in a\nphosphorus 15-P scintillation medium is theoretically studied. It has shown the\n$\\beta$ energy spectrum absorption in ${15}P$ had nearly 100% efficiency for\n$\\leq$ 28 keV in 800 {\\mu}m scintillator thickness. This can eventually lead to\nthe production of light sources using these beta-emitting radiation sources as\na low energy source in the near future.\n", "  We determine the invariant expression of the force density that the\nelectromagnetic field exerts on dipolar matter and construct the non-symmetric\nenergy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field in matter which is\nconsistent with that force and with Maxwell equations. We recover Minkowski's\nexpression for the momentum density. We use our results to discuss momentum\nexchange of an electromagnetic wave-packet which falls into a dielectric block.\nIn particular we show that the wave-packet pulls the block when it enters and\ndrags it when it leaves. The usual form of the center of mass motion theorem\ndoes not hold for this system but a modified version of the theorem which\nincludes a spin contribution is shown to be satisfied.\n", "  It is shown that the tree-level S-matrix for quantum gravity in\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space has a Virasoro symmetry which acts on the\nconformal sphere at null infinity.\n", "  Equilibrium states of a closed semiflexible polymer binding to a cylinder are\ndescribed. This may be either by confinement or by constriction. Closed\ncompletely bound states are labeled by two integers: the number of\noscillations, $n$, and the number of times it winds the cylinder, $p$, the\nlatter a topological invariant. We examine the behavior of these states as the\nlength of the loop is increased by evaluating the energy, the conserved axial\ntorque and the contact force. The ground state for a given $p$ is the state\nwith $n=1$; a short loop with $p=1$ is an elliptic deformation of a parallel;\nas its length increases it elongates along the cylinder axis, with two hairpin\nends. Excited states with $n\\geq2$ and $p=1$ possess $n$-fold axial symmetry.\nShort (long) loops possess energies $\\approx p E_0$ ($nE_0$), with $E_0$ the\nenergy of a circular loop with same radius as the cylinder; in long loops the\naxial torque vanishes. Confined bound excited states are initially unstable;\nhowever, above a critical length each $n$-fold state becomes stable: the folded\nhairpin cannot be unfolded. The ground state for each $p$ is also initially\nunstable with respect to deformations rotating the loop off the surface into\nthe interior. A closed planar elastic curve aligned along the cylinder axis\nmaking contact with the cylinder on its two sides is identified as the ground\nstate of a confined loop. Exterior bound states behave very differently, if\nfree to unbind, as signaled by the reversal in the sign of the contact force.\nIf $p=1$, all such states are unstable. If $p \\geq 2$, however, a topological\nobstruction to complete unbinding exists. If the loop is short, the bound state\nwith $p=2$ and $n=1$ provides a stable constriction of the cylinder, partially\nunbinding as the length is increased. This motif could be relevant to an\nunderstanding of the process of membrane fission mediated by dynamin rings.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating a spatially varying density function,\nmotivated by problems that arise in large-scale radiological survey and anomaly\ndetection. In this context, the density functions to be estimated are the\nbackground gamma-ray energy spectra at sites spread across a large geographical\narea, such as nuclear production and waste-storage sites, military bases,\nmedical facilities, university campuses, or the downtown of a city. Several\nchallenges combine to make this a difficult problem. First, the spectral\ndensity at any given spatial location may have both smooth and non-smooth\nfeatures. Second, the spatial correlation in these density functions is neither\nstationary nor locally isotropic. Finally, at some spatial locations, there is\nvery little data. We present a method called multiscale spatial density\nsmoothing that successfully addresses these challenges. The method is based on\nrecursive dyadic partition of the sample space, and therefore shares much in\ncommon with other multiscale methods, such as wavelets and P\\'olya-tree priors.\nWe describe an efficient algorithm for finding a maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimate that leverages recent advances in convex optimization for non-smooth\nfunctions.\n  We apply multiscale spatial density smoothing to real data collected on the\nbackground gamma-ray spectra at locations across a large university campus. The\nmethod exhibits state-of-the-art performance for spatial smoothing in density\nestimation, and it leads to substantial improvements in power when used in\nconjunction with existing methods for detecting the kinds of radiological\nanomalies that may have important consequences for public health and safety.\n", "  This paper concerns the viscous and non-resistive MHD systems which govern\nthe motion of electrically conducting fluids interacting with magnetic fields.\nWe consider an initial-boundary value problem for both compressible and\n(nonhomogeneous and homogeneous) incompressible fluids in an infinite flat\nlayer. We prove the global well-posedness of the systems around a uniform\nmagnetic field which is vertical to the layer. Moreover, the solution converges\nto the steady state at an almost exponential rate as time goes to infinity. Our\nproof relies on a two-tier energy method for the reformulated systems in\nLagrangian coordinates.\n", "  The operating principle of squeeze-film pressure sensors is based on the\npressure dependence of a membrane's resonance frequency, caused by the\ncompression of the surrounding gas which changes the resonator stiffness. To\nrealize such sensors, not only strong and flexible membranes are required, but\nalso minimization of the membrane's mass is essential to maximize responsivity.\nHere, we demonstrate the use of a few-layer graphene membrane as a squeeze-film\npressure sensor. A clear pressure dependence of the membrane's resonant\nfrequency is observed, with a frequency shift of 4 MHz between 8 and 1000 mbar.\nThe sensor shows a reproducible response and no hysteresis. The measured\nresponsivity of the device is 9000 Hz/mbar, which is a factor 45 higher than\nstate-of-the-art MEMS-based squeeze-film pressure sensors while using a 25\ntimes smaller membrane area.\n", "  We examine the notion of anticonfinement and the role it has to play in the\nsingularity analysis of discrete systems. A singularity is said to be\nanticonfined if singular values continue to arise indefinitely for the forward\nand backward iterations of a mapping, with only a finite number of iterates\ntaking regular values in between. We show through several concrete examples\nthat the behaviour of some anticonfined singularities is strongly related to\nthe integrability properties of the discrete mappings in which they arise, and\nwe explain how to use this information to decide on the integrability or\nnon-integrability of the mapping.\n", "  We propose a methodology to measure the mechanical properties of membranes\nfrom their fluctuations and apply this to optical microscopy measurements of\ngiant unilamellar vesicles of lipids. We analyze the effect of the projection\nof thermal shape undulations across the focal depth of the microscope. We\nderive an analytical expression for the mode spectrum that varies with the\nfocal depth and accounts for the projection of fluctuations onto the equatorial\nplane. A comparison of our model with existing approaches, that use only the\napparent equatorial fluctuations without averaging out of this plane, reveals a\nsignificant and systematic reduction in the inferred value of the bending\nrigidity. Our results are in full agreement with the values measured through\nX-ray scattering and other micromechanical manipulation techniques, resolving a\nlong standing discrepancy with these other experimental methods.\n", "  The summation of logarithmic contributions to perturbative radiative\ncorrections in physical processes through use of the renormalization group\nequation has proved to be a useful way of enhancing the information one can\nobtain from explicit calculation. However, it has proved difficult to perform\nthis summation when massive fields are present. In this note we point out that\nif the masses involved are quite large, the decoupling theorem of Symanzik and\nof Appelquist and Carazzone can be used to make the summation of logarithms\npossible.\n", "  The use of superposition of states in quantum computation, known as quantum\nparallelism, has significant advantage in terms of speed over the classical\ncomputation. It can be understood from the early invented quantum algorithms\nsuch as Deutsch's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and its variation as\nBernstein-Vazirani algorithm, Simon algorithm, Shor's algorithms etc. Quantum\nparallelism also significantly speeds up the database search algorithm, which\nis important in computer science because it comes as a subroutine in many\nimportant algorithms. Quantum database search of Grover achieves the task of\nfinding the target element in an unsorted database in a time quadratically\nfaster than the classical computer. We review the Grover quantum search\nalgorithms for a singe and multiple target elements in a database. The partial\nsearch algorithm of Grover and Radhakrishnan and its optimization by Korepin,\ncalled GRK algorithm are also discussed.\n", "  Strongly interacting topological states in multi-particle quantum systems\npose great challenges to both theory and experiment. Recently, bound states of\nelementary spin waves (magnons) in quantum magnets have been experimentally\nobserved in quantum Heisenberg chains comprising ultracold Bose atoms in\noptical lattices. Here, we explore a strongly interacting topological state\ncalled topological magnon bound-state in the quantum Heisenberg chain under\ncotranslational symmetry. We find that the cotranslational symmetry is the key\nto the definition of a topological invariant for multi-particle quantum states,\nwhich enables us to characterize the topological features of multi-magnon\nexcitations. We calculate energy spectra, density distributions, correlations\nand Chern numbers of the two-magnon bound-states and show the existence of\ntopological protected edge bound-states. Our study not only opens a new\nprospect to pursue topological magnon bound-states, but also gives insights\ninto the characterization and understanding of strongly interacting topological\nstates.\n", "  The area of a cross-sectional cut $\\Sigma$ of future null infinity\n($\\mathcal{I}^+$) is infinite. We define a finite, renormalized area by\nsubtracting the area of the same cut in any one of the infinite number of\nBMS-degenerate classical vacua. The renormalized area acquires an anomalous\ndependence on the choice of vacuum. We relate it to the modular energy,\nincluding a soft graviton contribution, of the region of $\\mathcal{I}^+$ to the\nfuture of $\\Sigma$. Under supertranslations, the renormalized area shifts by\nthe supertranslation charge of $\\Sigma$. In quantum gravity, we conjecture a\nbound relating the renormalized area to the entanglement entropy across\n$\\Sigma$ of the outgoing quantum state on $\\mathcal{I}^+$.\n", "  Tokamak plasmas are confined by a magnetic field that limits the particle and\nheat transport perpendicular to the field. Parallel to the field the ionised\nparticles can move freely, so to obtain confinement the field lines are\n\"closed\" (ie. form closed surfaces of constant poloidal flux) in the core of a\ntokamak. Towards, the edge, however, the field lines begin to intersect\nphysical surfaces, leading to interaction between neutral and ionised\nparticles, and the potential melting of the material surface. Simulation of\nthis interaction is important for predicting the performance and lifetime of\nfuture tokamak devices such as ITER. Field-aligned coordinates are commonly\nused in the simulation of tokamak plasmas due to the geometry and magnetic\ntopology of the system. However, these coordinates are limited in the geometry\nthey allow in the poloidal plane due to orthogonality requirements. A novel 3D\ncoordinate system is proposed herein that relaxes this constraint so that any\narbitrary, smoothly varying geometry can be matched in the poloidal plane while\nmaintaining a field-aligned coordinate. This system is implemented in BOUT++\nand tested for accuracy using the method of manufactured solutions. A MAST edge\ncross-section is simulated using a fluid plasma model and the results show\nexpected behaviour for density, temperature, and velocity. Finally, simulations\nof an isolated divertor leg are conducted with and without neutrals to\ndemonstrate the ion-neutral interaction near the divertor plate and the\ncorresponding beneficial decrease in plasma temperature.\n", "  We propose a computational scheme to evaluate Hamaker constants, $A$, of\nmolecules with practical sizes and anisotropies. Upon the increasing\nfeasibility of diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to evaluate binding curves\nfor such molecules to extract the constants, we discussed how to treat the\naveraging over anisotropy and how to correct the bias due to the\nnon-additivity. We have developed a computational procedure for dealing with\nthe anisotropy and reducing statistical errors and biases in DMC valuations,\nbased on possible validations on predicted $A$. We applied the scheme to\ncyclohexasilane molecule, Si$_6$H$_{12}$, used in 'printed electronics'\nfabrications, getting $A \\sim 105 \\pm 2$ [zJ], being in plausible range\nsupported even by other possible extrapolations. The scheme provided here would\nopen a way to use handy {\\it ab initio} evaluations to predict wettabilities as\nin the form of materials informatics over broader molecules.\n", "  Both the original Temperley-Lieb algebras $\\mathsf{TL}_{n}$ and their dilute\ncounterparts $\\mathsf{dTL}_{n}$ form families of filtered algebras:\n$\\mathsf{TL}_{n}\\subset \\mathsf{TL}_{n+1}$ and\n$\\mathsf{dTL}_{n}\\subset\\mathsf{dTL}_{n+1}$, for all $n\\geq 0$. For each such\ninclusion, the restriction and induction of every finite-dimensional\nindecomposable module over $\\mathsf{TL}_{n}$ (or $\\mathsf{dTL}_{n}$) is\ncomputed. To accomplish this, a thorough description of each indecomposable is\ngiven, including its projective cover and injective hull, some short exact\nsequences in which it appears, its socle and head, and its extension groups\nwith irreducible modules. These data are also used to prove the completeness of\nthe list of indecomposable modules, up to isomorphism. In fact, two\ncompleteness proofs are given, the first is based on elementary homological\nmethods and the second uses Auslander-Reiten theory. The latter proof offers a\ndetailed example of this algebraic tool that may be of independent interest.\n", "  We provide new query complexity separations against sensitivity for total\nBoolean functions: a power $3$ separation between deterministic (and even\nrandomized or quantum) query complexity and sensitivity, and a power $2.22$\nseparation between certificate complexity and sensitivity. We get these\nseparations by using a new connection between sensitivity and a seemingly\nunrelated measure called one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity\n($UC_{min}$). We also show that $UC_{min}$ is lower-bounded by fractional block\nsensitivity, which means we cannot use these techniques to get a\nsuper-quadratic separation between $bs(f)$ and $s(f)$. We also provide a\nquadratic separation between the tree-sensitivity and decision tree complexity\nof Boolean functions, disproving a conjecture of Gopalan, Servedio, Tal, and\nWigderson (CCC 2016).\n  Along the way, we give a power $1.22$ separation between certificate\ncomplexity and one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity, improving the\npower $1.128$ separation due to G\\\"o\\\"os (FOCS 2015). As a consequence, we\nobtain an improved $\\Omega(\\log^{1.22} n)$ lower-bound on the\nco-nondeterministic communication complexity of the Clique vs. Independent Set\nproblem.\n", "  The perturbations in the early universe are generated as a result of the\ninterplay between quantum field theory and gravitation. Since these primordial\nperturbations lead to the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and\neventually to the inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), they\nprovide a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our\nunderstanding of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue\nthat remains to be satisfactorily addressed is the transition of the primordial\nperturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS which can be characterized\ncompletely in terms of classical quantities. Bouncing universes provide an\nalternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they can help\novercome the horizon problem in a fashion very similar to inflation. While the\nproblem of the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations\nhas been investigated extensively in the context of inflation, we find that\nthere has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in bouncing\nuniverses. In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this problem with the\nexample of tensor perturbations produced in bouncing universes. We investigate\nthe issue mainly from two perspectives. Firstly, we approach the problem by\nexamining the extent of squeezing of a quantum state associated with the tensor\nperturbations with the help of the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze this\nissue from the perspective of the quantum measurement problem. In particular,\nwe study the effects of wave function collapse, using a phenomenological model\nknown as continuous spontaneous localization, on the tensor power spectra. We\nconclude with a discussion of results.\n", "  Global network of advanced Interferometric gravitational wave (GW) detectors\nare expected to be on-line soon. Coherent observation of GW from a distant\ncompact binary coalescence (CBC) with a network of interferometers located in\ndifferent continents give crucial information about the source such as source\nlocation and polarization information. In this paper we compare different\nmulti-detector network detection statistics for CBC search. In maximum\nlikelihood ratio (MLR) based detection approaches, the likelihood ratio is\noptimized to obtain the best model parameters and the best likelihood ratio\nvalue is used as statistic to make decision on the presence of signal. However,\nan alternative Bayesian approach involves marginalization of the likelihood\nratio over the parameters to obtain the average likelihood ratio. We obtain an\nanalytical expression for the Bayesian statistic using the two effective\nsynthetic data streams for targeted search of non-spinning compact binary\nsystems with an uninformative prior on the parameters. Simulations are carried\nout for testing the validity of the approximation and comparing the detection\nperformance with the maximum likelihood ratio based statistics. We observe that\nthe MLR {\\it hybrid} statistic gives comparable or better performance with\nrespect to the Bayesian statistic.\n", "  Here it is shown that graphene membranes that separate 2 gases at identical\npressure are deflected by osmotic pressure. The osmotic pressure is a\nconsequence of differences in gas permeation rates into a graphene enclosed\ncavity. The deflection of the few layer graphene membranes is detected by an\ninterferometric technique for measuring their tension-induced resonance\nfrequency. Using a calibration measurement of the relation between resonance\nfrequency and pressure, the time dependent osmotic pressure on the graphene is\nextracted. The osmotic pressure for different combinations of gases shows large\ndifferences that can be accounted for by a model based on the different gas\npermeation rates. Thus a graphene membrane based gas osmometer with a\nresponsitivity of ~60 kHz/mbar and nanoscale dimensions is demonstrated.\n", "  We investigate how the presence of quantum correlations can influence work\nextraction in closed quantum systems, establishing a new link between the field\nof quantum non-equilibrium thermodynamics and the one of quantum information\ntheory. We consider a bipartite quantum system and we show that it is possible\nto optimise the process of work extraction, thanks to the correlations between\nthe two parts of the system, by using an appropriate feedback protocol based on\nthe concept of ergotropy. We prove that the maximum gain in the extracted work\nis related to the existence of quantum correlations between the two parts,\nquantified by either quantum discord or, for pure states, entanglement. We then\nillustrate our general findings on a simple physical situation consisting of a\nqubit system.\n", "  We study time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity in topological\ninsulator (TI) thin films including both intra- and inter-surface pairing. We\nfind a nontrivial topology for multiple different configurations. For\nintra-surface pairing a $\\pi$-phase difference between the intra-surface\npairing states is required. We show that in this case the resulting topological\nphase is highly tunable by both an applied electric field and varied chemical\npotential. For spin-singlet inter-surface pairing, a sign-changing tunnel\ncoupling present in many TI thin films is needed, and again, the topology can\nbe tuned by electric field or doping. Notably, we find that the required\ninter-surface pairing strength for achieving nontrivial topology can still be\nsubdominant compared to the intra-surface pairing. Finally, for spin-triplet\ninter-surface pairing we prove that the superconducting state is always\ntopological nontrivial. We show that thin films of Cu-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ will\nlikely host such spin-triplet inter-surface pairing. Taken together, these\nresults show that time-reversal-invariant topological superconductivity is\ncommon in superconducting TI thin films and that the topological phase and its\nKramers pair of Majorana edge modes is highly tunable with an applied electric\nfield and varied chemical potential.\n", "  The couplings of the isosinglet axial-vector currents to the Eta and Eta'\nmesons are evaluated in a stable, model independent way by use of polynomial\nkernels in dispersion integrals. The corrections to the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner\nrelation in the isoscalar channel are deduced. The derivative of the\ntopological susceptibility at the origin is calculated taking into account\ninstantons and instanton screening.\n", "  We extend Van't Hoff's law for the osmotic pressure to a suspension of active\nBrownian particles. The propelled particles exert a net reaction force on the\nsolvent, and thereby either drive a measurable solvent flow from the connecting\nsolvent reservoir through the semipermeable membrane, or increase the osmotic\npressure and cause the suspension to rise to heights as large as micrometers\nfor experimentally realized microswimmers described in the literature. The\nincrease in osmotic pressure is caused by the background solvent being, in\ncontrast to passive suspensions, no longer at the chemical potential of the\nsolvent reservoir. The difference in solvent chemical potentials depends on the\ncolloid-membrane interaction potential, which implies that the osmotic pressure\nis a state function of a state that itself is influenced by the membrane\npotential.\n", "  In this paper, we consider deformed STU model in four dimensions including\nboth electric and magnetic charges. Using AdS/CFT correspondence, we study\nholographic superconductor and obtain transport properties like electrical and\nthermal conductivities. We obtain transport properties in terms of the black\nhole magnetic charge and interpret it as magnetic monopole of dual field\ntheory. We find that presence of magnetic charge is necessary to have maximum\nconductivities, and existence of magnetic monopole with a critical charge (137\ne) to reach the maximum superconductivity is important. Also, we show that\nthermal conductivity increases with increasing of magnetic charge. It may be\nconcluded that the origin of superconductivity is magnetic monopole.\n", "  $W$ boson pair production processes at $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ colliders have been\nconventionally interpreted as measurements of $WWZ$ and $WW\\gamma$ triple gauge\ncouplings (TGCs). Such interpretation is based on the assumption that new\nphysics effects other than anomalous TGCs are negligible. While this \"TGC\ndominance assumption\" was well-motivated and useful at LEP2 thanks to precision\nelectroweak constraints, it is already challenged by recent LHC data. In fact,\ncontributions from anomalous $Z$ boson couplings that are allowed by\nelectroweak precision data but neglected in LHC analyses, being enhanced at\nhigh energy, can even dominate over those from the anomalous TGCs considered.\nThis limits the generality of the anomalous TGC constraints derived in current\nanalyses, and necessitates extension of the analysis framework and change of\nphysics interpretation. The issue will persist as we continue to explore the\nhigh energy frontier. We clarify and analyze the situation in the effective\nfield theory framework, which provides a useful organizing principle for\nunderstanding Standard Model deviations in the high energy regime.\n", "  Entropy stable schemes can be constructed with a specific choice of the\nnumerical flux function. First, an entropy conserving flux is constructed.\nSecondly, an entropy stable dissipation term is added to this flux to guarantee\ndissipation of the discrete entropy. Present works in the field of entropy\nstable numerical schemes are concerned with thorough derivations of entropy\nconservative fluxes for ideal MHD. However, as we show in this work, if the\ndissipation operator is not constructed in a very specific way, it cannot lead\nto a generally stable numerical scheme.\n  The two main findings presented in this paper are that the entropy conserving\nflux of Ismail & Roe can easily break down for certain initial conditions\ncommonly found in astrophysical simulations, and that special care must be\ntaken in the derivation of a discrete dissipation matrix for an entropy stable\nnumerical scheme to be robust.\n  We present a convenient novel averaging procedure to evaluate the entropy\nJacobians of the ideal MHD and the compressible Euler equations that yields a\ndiscretization with favorable robustness properties.\n", "  Disorder in a 1D quantum lattice induces Anderson localization of the\neigenstates and drastically alters transport properties of the lattice. In the\noriginal Anderson model, the addition of a periodic driving increases, in a\ncertain range of the driving's frequency and amplitude, localization length of\nthe appearing Floquet eigenstates. We go beyond the uncorrelated disorder case\nand address the experimentally relevant situation when spatial correlations are\npresent in the lattice potential. Their presence induces the creation of an\neffective mobility edge in the energy spectrum of the system. We find that a\nslow driving leads to resonant hybridization of the Floquet states, by\nincreasing both the participation numbers and effective widths of the states in\nthe strongly localized band and decreasing values of these characteristics for\nthe states in the quasi-extended band. Strong driving homogenizes the bands, so\nthat the Floquet states loose compactness and tend to be spatially smeared. In\nthe basis of the stationary Hamiltonian, these states retain localization in\nterms of participation number but become de-localized and spectrum-wide in term\nof their effective widths. Signatures of thermalization are also observed.\n", "  It is still an outstanding challenge to characterize and understand the\ntopological features of strongly interacting states such as bound-states in\ninteracting quantum systems. Here, by introducing a cotranslational symmetry in\nan interacting multi-particle quantum system, we systematically develop a\nmethod to define a Chern invariant, which is a generalization of the well-known\nThouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs invariant, for identifying strongly\ninteracting topological states. As an example, we study the topological\nmulti-magnon states in a generalized Heisenberg XXZ model, which can be\nrealized by the currently available experiment techniques of cold atoms [Phys.\nRev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 185301 (2013); Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 185302\n(2013)]. Through calculating the two-magnon excitation spectrum and the defined\nChern number, we explore the emergence of topological edge bound-states and\ngive their topological phase diagram. We also analytically derive an effective\nsingle-particle Hofstadter superlattice model for a better understanding of the\ntopological bound-states. Our results not only provide a new approach to\ndefining a topological invariant for interacting multi-particle systems, but\nalso give insights into the characterization and understanding of strongly\ninteracting topological states.\n", "  Photonic systems for high-performance information processing have attracted\nrenewed interest. Neuromorphic silicon photonics has the potential to integrate\nprocessing functions that vastly exceed the capabilities of electronics. We\nreport first observations of a recurrent silicon photonic neural network, in\nwhich connections are configured by microring weight banks. A mathematical\nisomorphism between the silicon photonic circuit and a continuous neural\nnetwork model is demonstrated through dynamical bifurcation analysis.\nExploiting this isomorphism, a simulated 24-node silicon photonic neural\nnetwork is programmed using \"neural compiler\" to solve a differential system\nemulation task. A 294-fold acceleration against a conventional benchmark is\npredicted. We also propose and derive power consumption analysis for\nmodulator-class neurons that, as opposed to laser-class neurons, are compatible\nwith silicon photonic platforms. At increased scale, Neuromorphic silicon\nphotonics could access new regimes of ultrafast information processing for\nradio, control, and scientific computing.\n", "  We consider the non-minimal model of gravity in $Y(R) F^2$-form. We\ninvestigate a particular case of the model, for which the higher order\nderivatives are eliminated but the scalar curvature $R$ is kept to be dynamical\nvia the constraint $Y_RF_{mn}F^{mn} =-\\frac{2}{\\kappa^2}$. The effective fluid\nobtained can be represented by interacting electromagnetic field and vacuum\ndepending on $Y(R)$, namely, the energy density of the vacuum tracks $R$ while\nenergy density of the conventional electromagnetic field is dynamically scaled\nwith the factor $\\frac{Y(R)}{2}$. We give exact solutions for anisotropic\ninflation by assuming the volume scale factor of the Universe exhibits a\npower-law expansion. The directional scale factors do not necessarily exhibit\npower-law expansion, which would give rise to a constant expansion anisotropy,\nbut expand non-trivially and give rise to a non-monotonically evolving\nexpansion anisotropy that eventually converges to a non-zero constant. Relying\non this fact, we discuss the anisotropic e-fold during the inflation by\nconsidering observed scale invariance in CMB and demanding the Universe to\nundergo the same amount of e-folds in all directions. We calculate the residual\nexpansion anisotropy at the end of inflation, though as a result of\nnon-monotonic behaviour of expansion anisotropy all the axes of the Universe\nundergo the same of amount of e-folds by the end of inflation. We also discuss\nthe generation of the modified electromagnetic field during the first few\ne-folds of the inflation and its persistence against to the vacuum till end of\ninflation.\n", "  We present concrete embeddings of fibre inflation models in globally\nconsistent type IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds with closed string moduli\nstabilisation. After performing a systematic search through the existing list\nof toric Calabi-Yau manifolds, we find several examples that reproduce the\nminimal setup to embed fibre inflation models. This involves Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds with $h^{1,1}= 3$ which are K3 fibrations over a $\\mathbb{P}^1$ base\nwith an additional shrinkable rigid divisor. We then provide different\nconsistent choices of the underlying brane set-up which generate a\nnon-perturbative superpotential suitable for moduli stabilisation and string\nloop corrections with the correct form to drive inflation. For each Calabi-Yau\norientifold setting, we also compute the effect of higher derivative\ncontributions and study their influence on the inflationary dynamics.\n", "  Asymptotic state of an open quantum system can undergo qualitative changes\nupon small variation of system parameters. We demonstrate it that such 'quantum\nbifurcations' can be appropriately defined and made visible as changes in the\nstructure of the asymptotic density matrix. By using an $N$-boson open quantum\ndimer, we present quantum diagrams for the pitchfork and saddle-node\nbifurcations in the stationary case and visualize a period-doubling transition\nto chaos for the periodically modulated dimer. In the latter case, we also\nidentify a specific bifurcation of purely quantum nature.\n", "  Nine years ago, superconductors based on the magnetic element iron were\ndiscovered. A flurry of research activity has revealed an unprecedented\ndiversity of chemical structures and physical properties. Similarly to other\nunconventional superconductors, stripe-type antiferromagnetism seems to play an\nimportant role. Particularly interesting is its strong coupling to the crystal\nlattice. The systematic comparison of different compounds may allow to identify\nkey elements in the mechanism of superconductivity and provide guidelines for\nthe search for new and better superconductors.\n", "  Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are a good alternative to photomultiplier\ntubes (PMTs) because their gain and quantum efficiency are comparable to PMTs.\nHowever, the largest single-chip SiPM is still less than 1~cm$^2$. In order to\nuse SiPMs with scintillators that have reasonable sensitivity, it is necessary\nto use multiple SiPMs. In this work, scintillation detectors are constructed\nand tested with a custom 2x2 SiPM array. The layout of the SiPMs and the\ngeometry of the scintillator were determined by performing Geant4 simulations.\nCubic NaI, CsI, and CLYC with 18~mm sides have been tested. The output of the\nscintillation detectors are stabilized over the temperature range between --20\nand 50~$^{\\circ}$C by matching the gain of the SiPMs in the array. The energy\nresolution for these detectors has been measured as a function of temperature.\nFurthermore, neutron detection for the CLYC detector was studied in the same\ntemperature range. Using pulse-shape discrimination, neutrons can be cleanly\nidentified without contribution from $\\gamma$-photons. As a result, these\ndetectors are suitable for deploying in spectroscopic personal radiation\ndetectors (SPRD).\n", "  Recently a boundary energy-momentum tensor $T_{zz}$ has been constructed from\nthe soft graviton operator for any 4D quantum theory of gravity in\nasymptotically flat space. Up to an \"anomaly\" which is one-loop exact, $T_{zz}$\ngenerates a Virasoro action on the 2D celestial sphere at null infinity. Here\nwe show by explicit construction that the effects of the IR divergent part of\nthe anomaly can be eliminated by a one-loop renormalization that shifts\n$T_{zz}$.\n", "  In this paper we compare the performance of two likelihood ratio based\ndetection statistics namely maximum likelihood ratio statistic and {\\it hybrid}\nstatistic designed for the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary\ncoalescence using multiple interferometric detector networks. We perform\nsimulations with non-spinning double neutron star binary system and neutron\nstar-black hole binary systems with spinning as well as non-spinning black hole\ncomponent masses. The binary injections are distributed uniformly in volume up\nto 1 Gpc. We observe that, on average, the maximum likelihood ratio statistic\nrecovers $\\sim 34.45\\%$, $\\sim 49.69\\%$, $\\sim 61.25\\%$ and $\\sim 69.67\\%$ of\ninjections in 2, 3, 4 and 5 detector networks respectively in the case of\nneutron star-black hole injections for a fixed false alarm probability of\n$10^{-7}$ in Gaussian noise. Further, we note that, compared to the maximum\nlikelihood ratio statistic, the {\\it hybrid} statistic recovers $\\sim 7.45\\%$,\n$\\sim 4.57\\%$, $\\sim 2.56\\%$ and $\\sim 1.22\\%$ more injections in 2, 3, 4 and 5\ndetector networks respectively for the same false alarm probability in Gaussian\nnoise. On the other hand, among binary neutron star injections, the maximum\nlikelihood ratio statistic recovers $\\sim 5.587\\%$, $\\sim 9.917\\%$, $\\sim\n14.73\\%$ and $\\sim 19.86\\%$ of injections in 2, 3, 4 and 5 detector networks\nrespectively and the {\\it hybrid} statistic recovers $\\sim 14.63\\%$, $\\sim\n12.91\\%$, $\\sim 11.49\\%$ and $\\sim 10.29\\%$ more injections compared to maximum\nlikelihood ratio statistic in 2, 3, 4 and 5 detector networks respectively.\n", "  The flow of superfluid $^4$He around a translationally oscillating sphere,\nlevitating without mechanical support, can either be laminar or turbulent,\ndepending on the velocity amplitude. Below a critical velocity $v_c$ that\nscales as $\\omega ^{1/2}$, and is temperature independent below 1 K, the flow\nis laminar (potential flow). Below 0.5 K the linear drag force is caused by\nballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T$^4$ until background damping,\nmeasured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T $<$ 0.1 K. Increasing the\nvelocity amplitude above $v_c$ leads to a transition from potential flow to\nturbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as $(v^2 - v_c^2)$. In\na small velocity interval $\\Delta v / v_c \\le 3 \\%$ above $v_c$, the flow is\nunstable below 0.5 K, switching intermittently between both patterns. From time\nseries recorded at constant temperature and driving force, the lifetimes of\nboth phases are analyzed statistically. We observe metastable states of\npotential flow which, after a mean lifetime of 25 minutes, ultimately break\ndown due to vorticity created by natural background radioactivity. The\nlifetimes of the turbulent phases have an exponential distribution, and the\nmean increases exponentially with $\\Delta v^2$. We investigate the frequency at\nwhich the vortex rings are shed from the sphere. Our results are compared with\nrecent data of other authors on vortex shedding by moving a laser beam through\na Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we show that our observed transition to\nturbulence belongs to the class of \"supertransient chaos\" where lifetimes of\nthe turbulent states increase faster than exponentially. Peculiar results\nobtained in dilute $^3$He - $^4$He mixtures are presented in the Appendix.\n", "  We outline here how strong light-matter interaction can be used to induce\nquantum phase transition between normal and topological phases in\ntwo-dimensional topological insulators. We consider the case of a HgTe quantum\nwell, in which band inversion occurs above a critical value of the well\nthickness, and demonstrate that coupling between electron states and the $E$\nfield from an off-resonant linearly polarized laser provides a powerful tool to\ncontrol topological transitions, even for a thickness of the quantum well that\nis below the critical value. We also show that topological phase properties of\nthe edge states, including their group velocity, can be tuned in a controllable\nway by changing the intensity of the laser field. These findings open up the\npossibility for new experimental means with which to investigate topological\ninsulators and shed new light on topological-insulator-based technologies that\nare under active discussion.\n", "  We develop a non-Markovian full counting statistics formalism taking into\naccount both the sequential tunneling and cotunneling based on the exact\nparticle number resolved time-convolutionless master equation and the\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. Then, we study the influences of\nthe quantum coherence and the cotunneling assisted sequential tunneling\nprocesses on the non-Markovian full counting statistics of electron tunneling\nthrough an open quantum system, which consists of a side-coupled\ndouble-quantum-dot molecule weakly coupled to two electron reservoirs. We\ndemonstrate that in the sequential tunneling regime the competition or\ninterplay between the quantum coherence and the cotunneling processes\ndetermines whether the super-Poissonian of the shot noise, the skewness and the\nkurtosis take place and whether the sign transitions of the values of the\nskewness and the kurtosis occur in the strong quantum-coherent side-coupled\ndouble-quantum-dot molecule. These results suggest that it is necessary to\nconsider the effects of the quantum coherence and the cotunneling processes on\nthe full counting statistics of electron tunneling through open strong\nquantum-coherent quantum systems in the sequential tunneling regime, which\nprovide a deeper insight into understanding of electron tunneling through open\nquantum systems.\n", "  We present new 1D (spherical) and 2D (axisymmetric) simulations of\nelectron-capture (EC) and low-mass iron-core-collapse supernovae (SN). We\nconsider six progenitor models: the ECSN progenitor from Nomoto (1984, 1987);\ntwo ECSN-like low-mass low-metallicity iron core progenitors from Heger\n(private communication); and the 9-, 10-, and 11-$M_\\odot$ (zero-age main\nsequence) progenitors from Sukhbold et al. (2016). We confirm that the ECSN and\nESCN-like progenitors explode easily even in 1D with explosion energies of up\nto a 0.15 Bethes ($1 {\\rm B} \\equiv 10^{51}\\ {\\rm erg}$), and are a viable\nmechanism for the production of very low-mass neutron stars. However, the 9-,\n10-, and 11-$M_\\odot$ progenitors do not explode in 1D and are not even\nnecessarily easier to explode than higher-mass progenitor stars in 2D. We study\nthe effect of perturbations and of changes to the microphysics and we find that\nrelatively small changes can result in qualitatively different outcomes, even\nin 1D, for models sufficiently close to the explosion threshold. Finally, we\nrevisit the impact of convection below the protoneutron star (PNS) surface. We\nanalyze, 1D and 2D evolutions of PNSs subject to the same boundary conditions.\nWe find that the impact of PNS convection has been underestimated in previous\nstudies and could result in an increase of the neutrino luminosity by up to\nfactors of two.\n", "  Thermal properties of suspended single-layer graphene membranes are\ninvestigated by characterization of their mechanical motion in response to a\nhigh-frequency modulated laser. A characteristic delay time $\\tau$ between the\noptical intensity and mechanical motion is observed, which is attributed to the\ntime required to raise the temperature of the membrane. We find, however, that\nthe measured time constants are significantly larger than the predicted ones\nbased on values of the specific heat and thermal conductivity. In order to\nexplain the discrepancy between measured and modeled tau, a model is proposed\nthat takes a thermal boundary resistance at the edge of the graphene drum into\naccount. The measurements provide a noninvasive way to characterize thermal\nproperties of suspended atomically thin membranes, providing information that\ncan be hard to obtain by other means.\n", "  We consider a class of either fermionic or bosonic noninteracting open\nquantum chains driven by dissipative interactions at the boundaries and study\nthe interplay of coherent transport and dissipative processes, such as bulk\ndephasing and diffusion. Starting from the microscopic formulation, we show\nthat the dynamics on large scales can be described in terms of fluctuating\nhydrodynamics. This is an important simplification as it allows us to apply the\nmethods of macroscopic fluctuation theory to compute the large deviation (LD)\nstatistics of time-integrated currents. In particular, this permits us to show\nthat fermionic open chains display a third-order dynamical phase transition in\nLD functions. We show that this transition is manifested in a singular change\nin the structure of trajectories: while typical trajectories are diffusive,\nrare trajectories associated with atypical currents are ballistic and\nhyperuniform in their spatial structure. We confirm these results by\nnumerically simulating ensembles of rare trajectories via the cloning method,\nand by exact numerical diagonalization of the microscopic quantum generator.\n", "  Many aspects of many-body localization (MBL) transitions remain elusive so\nfar. Here, we propose a higher-dimensional generalization of the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that it exhibits a MBL transition. The\nmodel on a bipartite lattice has $N$ Majorana fermions with SYK interactions on\neach site of the $A$ sublattice and $M$ free Majorana fermions on each site the\nof $B$ sublattice, where $N$ and $M$ are large and finite. For\n$r$$\\equiv$$M/N\\!<\\!r_c$=1, it describes a diffusive metal exhibiting maximal\nchaos. Remarkably, its diffusive constant $D$ vanishes [$D$$\\propto$$\n(r_c-r)^{1/2}$] as $r$$\\rightarrow$$r_c$, implying a dynamical transition to a\nMBL phase. It is further supported by numerical calculations of level\nstatistics which changes from Wigner-Dyson ($r$$<$$r_c$) to Poisson\n($r$$>$$r_c$) distributions. Note that no subdiffusive phase intervenes between\ndiffusive and MBL phases. Moreover, the critical exponent $\\nu$=0, violating\nthe Harris criterion. Our higher-dimensional SYK model may provide a promising\narena to explore exotic MBL transitions.\n", "  The problem of accounting for the quantum degrees of freedom in passing from\nmassive higher-spin potentials to massless ones and its inverse, the\n\"fattening\" of massless tensor potentials of helicity $\\pm h$ to their massive\n$s = |h|$ counterparts, are solved - in a perfectly ghost-free approach - using\n\"string-localized fields\". This approach allows to overcome the Weinberg-Witten\nimpediment against the existence of massless $|h| \\geq 2$ energy-momentum\ntensors, and to qualitatively and quantitatively resolve the van\nDam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity concerning, e.g., very light gravitons, in\nthe limit $m \\to 0$.\n", "  We study the free evolution of frictional granular gases using large scale\nmolecular dynamics simulation in three dimensions. The system cools due to\nsolid friction among the interacting particles. At early stages of evolution,\nthe density field remains homogeneous and the velocity field follows the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann (MB) distribution. However, at later times, the density field\nshows clustering and the velocity field shows local ordering. The ordering in\nthe velocity field is studied by invoking analogy from phase ordering systems.\nThe equal-time correlation function of velocity field follows dynamical\nscaling. The correlation length of velocity field, $L_v(t)$, exhibits power law\ngrowth: $L_v(t)\\sim t^{1/3}$.\n", "  We show that neutrino spin and spin-flavor transitions involve nonvanishing\ngeometric phases. The geometric character of neutrino spin rotation is explored\nby studying the neutrino spin trajectory in the projective Hilbert space\nrepresentation and its relation to the geometric phase. Analytical expressions\nare derived for noncyclic geometric phases. Several calculations are performed\nfor different cases of rotating and nonrotating magnetic fields in the context\nof solar neutrinos and neutrinos produced inside neutron stars. Also the\neffects of adiabaticity, critical magnetic fields and cross boundary effects in\nthe case of neutrinos emanating out of neutron stars are examined.\n", "  Monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit\nintriguing fundamental physics of strongly coupled spin and valley degrees of\nfreedom for charge carriers. While the possibility of exploiting these\nproperties for information processing stimulated concerted research activities\ntowards the concept of valleytronics , maintaining control over spin-valley\npolarization proved challenging in individual monolayers. A promising\nalternative route explores type II band alignment in artificial van der Waals\nheterostructures. The resulting formation of interlayer excitons combines the\nadvantages of long carrier lifetimes and spin-valley locking . Here, we\ndemonstrate direct magnetic manipulation of valley polarization in a WSe2/MoSe2\nheterostructure through giant valley Zeeman splitting of interlayer\ntransitions. Remarkably, even after non-selective injection, the observed $g$\nfactor as large as $-15$ induces near-unity polarization of long-lived excitons\nwith 100 ns lifetimes under magnetic fields. The demonstrated control of the\nspin-valley physics highlights the exceptional aspects of novel, artificially\ndesigned material systems and their promise for atomically-thin valleytronic\ndevices.\n", "  We introduce and discuss two inter-related mechanisms operative in the\nelectroweak sector of the Standard Model at high energies. Higgsplosion, the\nfirst mechanism, occurs at some critical energy in the 25 to 10^3 TeV range,\nand leads to an exponentially growing decay rate of highly energetic particles\ninto multiple Higgs bosons. We argue that this a well-controlled\nnon-perturbative phenomenon in the Higgs-sector which involves the final state\nHiggs multiplicities n in the regime n \\lambda >> 1 where \\lambda is the Higgs\nself-coupling. If this mechanism is realised in nature, the cross-sections for\nproducing ultra-high multiplicities of Higgs bosons are likely to become\nobservable and even dominant in this energy range. At the same time, however,\nthe apparent exponential growth of these cross-sections at even higher energies\nwill be tamed and automatically cut-off by a related Higgspersion mechanism. As\na result, and in contrast to previous studies, multi-Higgs production does not\nviolate perturbative unitarity. Building on this approach, we then argue that\nthe effects of Higgsplosion alter quantum corrections from very heavy states to\nthe Higgs boson mass. Above a certain energy, which is much smaller than their\nmasses, these states would rapidly decay into multiple Higgs bosons. The heavy\nstates become unrealised as they decay much faster than they are formed. The\nloop integrals contributing to the Higgs mass will be cut off not by the masses\nof the heavy states, but by the characteristic loop momenta where their decay\nwidths become comparable to their masses. Hence, the cut-off scale would be\nmany orders of magnitude lower than the heavy mass scales themselves, thus\nsuppressing their quantum corrections to the Higgs boson mass.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the rate function and of local observables\nafter a quench in models which exhibit phase transitions between a superfluid\nand an insulator in their ground states. Zeros of the return probability,\ncorresponding to singularities of the rate functions, have been suggested to\nindicate the emergence of dynamical criticality and we address the question of\nwhether such zeros can be tied to the dynamics of physically relevant\nobservables and hence order parameters in the systems. For this we first\nnumerically analyze the dynamics of a hard-core boson gas in a one-dimensional\nwaveguide when a quenched lattice potential is commensurate with the particle\ndensity. Such a system can undergo a pinning transition to an insulating state\nand we find non-analytic behavior in the evolution of the rate function which\nis indicative of dynamical phase transitions. In addition, we perform\nsimulations of the time dependence of the momentum distribution and compare the\nperiodicity of this collapse and revival cycle to that of the non-analyticities\nin the rate function: the two are found to be closely related only for deep\nquenches. We then confirm this observation by analytic calculations on a\nclosely related discrete model of hard-core bosons in the presence of a\nstaggered potential and find expressions for the rate function for the\nquenches. By extraction of the zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude we uncover a\nnon-equilibrium timescale for the emergence of non-analyticities and discuss\nits relationship with the dynamics of the experimentally relevant parity\noperator.\n", "  Low-dimensional wide bandgap semiconductors open a new playing field in\nquantum optics using sub-bandgap excitation. In this field, hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) has been reported to host single quantum emitters (QEs), linking\nQE density to perimeters. Furthermore, curvature/perimeters in transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) have demonstrated a key role in QE formation. We\ninvestigate a curvature-abundant BN system - quasi one-dimensional BN nanotubes\n(BNNTs) fabricated via a catalyst-free method. We find that non-treated BNNT is\nan abundant source of stable QEs and analyze their emission features down to\nsingle nanotubes, comparing dispersed/suspended material. Combining high\nspatial resolution of a scanning electron microscope, we categorize and\npin-point emission origin to a scale of less than 20 nm, giving us a one-to-one\nvalidation of emission source with dimensions smaller than the laser excitation\nwavelength, elucidating nano-antenna effects. Two emission origins emerge:\nhybrid/entwined BNNT. By artificially curving h-BN flakes, similar QE spectral\nfeatures are observed. The impact on emission of solvents used in commercial\nproducts and curved regions is also demonstrated. The 'out of the box'\navailability of QEs in BNNT, lacking processing contamination, is a milestone\nfor unraveling their atomic features. These findings open possibilities for\nprecision engineering of QEs, puts h-BN under a similar 'umbrella' of TMDC's\nQEs and provides a model explaining QEs spatial localization/formation using\nelectron/ion irradiation and chemical etching.\n", "  Recursion relations for the sphere $4$-point and torus $1$-point ${\\cal W}_3$\nconformal blocks, generalizing Alexei Zamolodchikov's famous relation for the\nVirasoro conformal blocks are proposed. One of these relations is valid for any\n4-point conformal block with two arbitrary and two special primaries with\ncharge parameters proportional to the highest weight of the fundamental irrep\nof $SU(3)$. The other relation is designed for the torus conformal block with a\nspecial (in above mentioned sense) primary field insertion. AGT relation maps\nthe sphere conformal block and the torus block to the instanton partition\nfunctions of the ${\\cal N}=2$ $SU(3)$ SYM theory with 6 fundamental or an\nadjoint hypermultiplets respectively. AGT duality played a central role in\nestablishing these recurrence relations, whose gauge theory counterparts are\nnovel relations for the $SU(3)$ partition functions with $N_f=6$ fundamental or\nan adjoint hypermultiplets. By decoupling some (or all) hypermultiplets,\nrecurrence relations for the asymptotically free theories with $0\\le N_f<6$ are\nfound.\n", "  We numerically explore the many body localization (MBL) transition through\nthe lens of the {\\it entanglement spectrum}. While a direct transition from\nlocalization to thermalization is believed to obtain in the thermodynamic limit\n(the exact details of which remain an open problem), in finite system sizes\nthere exists an intermediate `quantum critical' regime. Previous numerical\ninvestigations have explored the crossover from thermalization to criticality,\nand have used this to place a numerical {\\it lower} bound on the critical\ndisorder strength for MBL. A careful analysis of the {\\it high energy} part of\nthe entanglement spectrum (which contains universal information about the\ncritical point) allows us to make the first ever observation in exact numerics\nof the crossover from criticality to MBL and hence to place a numerical {\\it\nupper bound} on the critical disorder strength for MBL.\n", "  A two body rational Calogero model with balanced loss and gain is\ninvestigated. The system yields a Hamiltonian which is symmetric under the\ncombined operation of parity (P) and time reversal (T ) symmetry. It is shown\nthat the system is integrable and exact, stable classical solutions are\nobtained for particular ranges of the parameters. The corresponding quantum\nsystem admits bound state solutions for exactly the same ranges of the\nparameters for which the classical solutions are stable. The eigen spectra of\nthe system is presented with a discussion on the normalization of the wave\nfunctions in proper Stokes wedges. Finally, the Calogero model with balanced\nloss and gain is studied classically, when the pair-wise harmonic interaction\nterm is replaced by a common confining harmonic potential. The system admits\nstable solutions for particular ranges of the parameters. However, the\nintegrability and/or exact solvability of the system is obscure due to the\npresence of the loss and gain terms. The perturbative solutions are obtained\nand are compared with the numerical results.\n", "  We estimate the initial weight and phase parameters ($\\theta, \\phi)$ of a\nsingle qubit system initially prepared in the coherent state\n$\\ket{\\theta,\\phi}$ and interacts with three different shape of pulses;\nrectangular, exponential, and $sin^2$-pulses. In general, we show that the\nestimation degree of the weight parameter depends on the pulse shape and the\ninitial phase angle, $(\\phi)$. For the rectangular pulse case, increasing the\nestimating rate of the weight parameter via the Fisher information function\n$(\\mathcal{F}_\\theta)$ is possible with small values of the atomic detuning\nparameter and larger values of the pulse strength.\n  Fisher information $(\\mathcal{F}_\\phi)$ increases suddenly at resonant case\nto reach its maximum value if the initial phase $\\phi=\\pi/2$ and consequently\none may estimate the phase parameter with high degree of precision. If the\ninitial system is coded with classical information, the upper bounds of Fisher\ninformation for resonant and non-resonant cases are much larger and\nconsequently one may estimate the pahse parameter with high degree of\nestimation. Similarly as the detuning increases the Fisher information\ndecreases and therefore the possibility of estimating the phase parameter\ndecreases. For exponential, and $sin^2$-pulses the Fisher information is\nmaximum ($\\mathcal{F}_{\\theta,\\phi}=1$) and consequently one can always\nestimate the weight and the phase parameters $(\\theta,\\phi)$ with high degree\nof precision.\n", "  Quantum entanglement has been recently demonstrated as a useful resource in\nconflicting interest games of incomplete information between two players, Alice\nand Bob [Pappa et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 020401 (2015)]. General setting\nfor such games is that of correlated strategies where the correlation between\ncompeting players is established through a trusted common adviser; however,\nplayers need not reveal their input to the adviser. So far, quantum advantage\nin such games has been revealed in a restricted sense. Given a quantum\ncorrelated equilibrium strategy, one of the players can still receive a higher\nthan quantum average payoff with some classically-correlated equilibrium\nstrategy. In this work, by considering a class of asymmetric Bayesian games, we\nshow the existence of games with quantum correlated equilibrium where average\npayoff of both the players exceed respective individual maximum for each player\nover all classically-correlated equilibriums.\n", "  The authors argue that the calculated $^6$He binding energies by the solution\nof the coupled Faddeev-Yakubovsky integral equation in a Three-dimensional\nscheme reported by E. Ahmadi Pouya and A. A. Rajabi [Int. J. Mod. Phys. E 25, 9\n(2016) 1650072] are incorrect. The formalism of the paper has serious mistakes\nand the numerical results are quite misleading because such a calculation even\nwith small grids for Jacobi momenta and the angle variables leads to a huge\nmemory of 37.8 PB (petabyte) which cannot even be achieved on present\nsupercomputers.\n", "  The domain wall depinning field represents the minimum magnetic field needed\nto move a domain wall, typically pinned by samples' disorder or patterned\nconstrictions. Conventionally, such field is considered independent on the\nGilbert damping since it is assumed to be the field at which the Zeeman energy\nequals the pinning energy barrier (both damping independent). Here, we analyse\nnumerically the domain wall depinning field as function of the Gilbert damping\nin a system with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction. Contrary to expectations, we find that the depinning field depends\non the Gilbert damping and that it strongly decreases for small damping\nparameters. We explain this dependence with a simple one-dimensional model and\nwe show that the reduction of the depinning field is related to the internal\ndomain wall dynamics, proportional to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,\nand the finite size of the pinning barriers.\n", "  We study a quantum Szilard engine that is not powered by heat drawn from a\nthermal reservoir, but rather by projective measurements. The engine is\nconstituted of a system $\\mathcal{S}$, a weight $\\mathcal{W}$, and a Maxwell\ndemon $\\mathcal{D}$, and extracts work via measurement-assisted feedback\ncontrol. By imposing natural constraints on the measurement and feedback\nprocesses, such as energy conservation and leaving the memory of the demon\nintact, we show that while the engine can function without heat from a thermal\nreservoir, it must give up at least one of the following features that are\nsatisfied by a standard Szilard engine: (i) repeatability of measurements; (ii)\ninvariant weight entropy; or (iii) positive work extraction for all measurement\noutcomes. This result is shown to be a consequence of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase\n(WAY) theorem, which imposes restrictions on the observables that can be\nmeasured under additive conservation laws. This observation is a first-step\ntowards developing \"second-law-like\" relations for measurement-assisted\nfeedback control beyond thermality.\n", "  We use Chandra X-ray data to measure the metallicity of the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) in 245 massive galaxy clusters selected from X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys, spanning redshifts $0<z<1.2$.\nMetallicities were measured in three different radial ranges, spanning cluster\ncores through their outskirts. We explore trends in these measurements as a\nfunction of cluster redshift, temperature, and surface brightness \"peakiness\"\n(a proxy for gas cooling efficiency in cluster centers). The data at large\nradii (0.5--1 $r_{500}$) are consistent with a constant metallicity, while at\nintermediate radii (0.1-0.5 $r_{500}$) we see a late-time increase in\nenrichment, consistent with the expected production and mixing of metals in\ncluster cores. In cluster centers, there are strong trends of metallicity with\ntemperature and peakiness, reflecting enhanced metal production in the\nlowest-entropy gas. Within the cool-core/sharply peaked cluster population,\nthere is a large intrinsic scatter in central metallicity and no overall\nevolution, indicating significant astrophysical variations in the efficiency of\nenrichment. The central metallicity in clusters with flat surface brightness\nprofiles is lower, with a smaller intrinsic scatter, but increases towards\nlower redshifts. Our results are consistent with other recent measurements of\nICM metallicity as a function of redshift. They reinforce the picture implied\nby observations of uniform metal distributions in the outskirts of nearby\nclusters, in which most of the enrichment of the ICM takes place before cluster\nformation, with significant later enrichment taking place only in cluster\ncenters, as the stellar populations of the central galaxies evolve.\n", "  We investigate exact non-stationary quantum states of vacuum toroidal black\nholes with a negative cosmological constant in arbitrary dimensions using the\nframework of throat quantization pioneered by Louko and M\\\"akel\\\"a for\nSchwarzschild black holes. The system is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator on\nthe half line, in which the central singularity is resolved quantum\nmechanically by imposing suitable boundary conditions that preserve unitarity.\nWe identify two suitable families of exact time-dependent wave functions with\nDirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions at the location of the classical\nsingularity. We find that for highly non-stationary states of large-mass black\nholes, quantum fluctuations are not negligible in one family, while they are\ngreatly suppressed in the other. The latter, therefore, may provide candidates\nfor describing the dynamics of semi-classical black holes.\n", "  We report temperature-dependent pair distribution function measurements of\nSr$_{1-x}$Na$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$, an iron-based superconductor system that\ncontains a magnetic phase with reentrant tetragonal symmetry, known as the\nmagnetic $C_4$ phase. Quantitative refinements indicate that the instantaneous\nlocal structure in the $C_4$ phase is comprised of fluctuating orthorhombic\nregions with a length scale of $\\sim$2 nm, despite the tetragonal symmetry of\nthe average static structure. Additionally, local orthorhombic fluctuations\nexist on a similar length scale at temperatures well into the paramagnetic\ntetragonal phase. These results highlight the exceptionally large nematic\nsusceptibility of iron-based superconductors and have significant implications\nfor the magnetic $C_4$ phase and the neighboring $C_2$ and superconducting\nphases.\n", "  Quantum entanglement and nonlocality are inequivalent notions: There exist\nentangled states that nevertheless admit local-realistic interpretations. This\npaper studies a special class of local-hidden-variable theories, in which the\nlinear structure of quantum measurement operators is preserved. It has been\nproven that a quantum state has such linear hidden-variable representations if,\nand only if, it is not entangled. Separable states are known to admit\nnonclassical correlations as well, which are captured by quantum discord and\nrelated measures. In the unified framework presented in this paper,\nzero-discordant states are characterized as the only states that admit fully\nconsistent classical probability representations. Possible generalization of\nthis framework to the quasiprobability representation of multipartite quantum\nstates is also discussed.\n", "  Three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetic devices such as the vertical racetrack\nmemory have attracted a huge interest due to their potential for memory and\nlogic applications. However, their implementation has not been realised due to\ngreat challenges regarding fabrication and characterisation of 3D\nnanostructures. Here, we show a 3D nanomagnetic system created by 3D\nnano-printing and physical vapour deposition, which acts a conduit for domain\nwalls. Domains formed at the substrate level are injected into a 3D nanowire,\nwhere they are controllably trapped using vectorial magnetic fields. A\ndark-field magneto-optical method for parallel, independent measurement of\ndifferent regions in individual 3D nanostructures is also demonstrated. This\nwork opens a new route for the advanced study and exploitation of 3D\nnanomagnetic systems.\n", "  Recent technological advances could make interstellar travel possible, using\nultra-lightweight sails pushed by lasers or solar photon pressure, at speeds of\na few percent the speed of light. Obtaining remote observational data from such\nprobes is not trivial because of their minimal instrumentation (gram scale) and\nlarge distances (pc). We derive the optimal communication scheme to maximize\nthe data rate between a remote probe and home-base. he framework requires\ncoronagraphic suppression of the stellar background at the level of $10^{-9}$\nwithin a few tenths of an arcsecond of the bright star. Our work includes\nmodels for the loss of photons from diffraction, technological limitations,\ninterstellar extinction, and atmospheric transmission. Major noise sources are\natmospheric, zodiacal, stellar and instrumental. We examine the maximum\ncapacity using the \"Holevo bound\" which gives an upper limit to the amount of\ninformation (bits) that can be encoded through a quantum state (photons), which\nis a few bits per photon for optimistic signal and noise levels. This allows\nfor data rates of order bits per second per Watt from a transmitter of size 1 m\nat a distance of $\\alpha\\,$Centauri (1.3 pc) to an earth-based large receiving\ntelescope (E-ELT, 39 m). The optimal wavelength for this distance is 300 nm\n(space-based receiver) to 400 nm (earth-based) and increases with distance, due\nto extinction, to a maximum of $\\approx3\\,\\mu$m to the center of the galaxy at\n8 kpc.\n", "  Plasma turbulence is the dominant transport mechanism for heat and particles\nin magnetized plasmas in linear devices and tokamaks, so the study of\nturbulence is important in limiting and controlling this transport. Linear\ndevices provide an axial magnetic field that serves to confine a plasma in\ncylindrical geometry as it travels along the magnetic field from the source to\nthe strike point. Due to perpendicular transport, the plasma density and\ntemperature have a roughly Gaussian radial profile with gradients that drive\ninstabilities, such as resistive drift-waves and Kelvin-Helmholtz. If unstable,\nthese instabilities cause perturbations to grow resulting in saturated\nturbulence, increasing the cross-field transport of heat and particles. When\nthe plasma emerges from the source, there is a time, $\\tau_{\\parallel}$, that\ndescribes the lifetime of the plasma based on parallel velocity and length of\nthe device. As the plasma moves down the device, it also moves azimuthally\naccording to $E\\times B$ and diamagnetic velocities. There is a balance point\nin these parallel and perpendicular times that sets the stabilisation\nthreshold. We simulate plasmas with a variety of parallel lengths and magnetic\nfields to vary the parallel and perpendicular lifetimes, respectively, and find\nthat there is a clear correlation between the saturated RMS density\nperturbation level and the balance between these lifetimes. The threshold of\nmarginal stability is seen to exist where\n$\\tau_{\\parallel}\\approx11\\tau_{\\perp}$. This is also associated with the\nproduct $\\tau_{\\parallel}\\gamma_*$, where $\\gamma_*$ is the drift-wave linear\ngrowth rate, indicating that the instability must exist for roughly 100 times\nthe growth time for the instability to enter the non-linear growth phase. We\nexplore the root of this correlation and the implications for linear device\ndesign.\n", "  We first examine the scaling argument for a renormalization-group (RG)\nanalysis applied to a system subject to the dimensional reduction in strong\nmagnetic fields, and discuss the fact that a four-Fermi operator of the\nlow-energy excitations is marginal irrespective of the strength of the coupling\nconstant in underlying theories. We then construct a scale-dependent effective\nfour-Fermi interaction as a result of screened photon exchanges at weak\ncoupling, and establish the RG method appropriately including the screening\neffect, in which the RG evolution from ultraviolet to infrared scales is\nseparated into two stages by the screening-mass scale. Based on a precise\nagreement between the dynamical mass gaps obtained from the solutions of the RG\nand Schwinger-Dyson equations, we discuss an equivalence between these two\napproaches. Focusing on QED and Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, we clarify how the\nproperties of the interactions manifest themselves in the mass gap, and point\nout an importance of respecting the intrinsic energy-scale dependences in\nunderlying theories for the determination of the mass gap. These studies are\nexpected to be useful for a diagnosis of the magnetic catalysis in QCD.\n", "  In this paper we use conformal field theory techniques to constrain the form\nof the correlations functions of an inflationary scalar-vector model described\nby the interaction term $f_1(\\phi)F_{\\mu \\nu}F^{\\mu \\nu} +\nf_2(\\phi)\\tilde{F}_{\\mu \\nu}F^{\\mu \\nu}$. We use the fact that the conformal\ngroup is the relevant symmetry group acting on super horizon scales in an\ninflationary de Sitter background. As a result, we find that super horizon\nconformal symmetry, constraints the form of the coupling functions $f_1, f_2$\nto be homogeneous functions of the same degree. We derive the general form of\nthe correlators involving scalar and vector perturbations in this model and\ndetermine its squeezed limit scaling behaviour for super horizon scales. The\napproach followed here is useful to constraint the shape of scalar-vector\ncorrelators, and our results agree with recent literature on the subject, but\ndon't allow us to determine amplitude factors of the correlators.\n", "  The $0$ to $R_1$ radial spherical coordinate transformation method can be\nmaking electromagnetic (EM) invisible cloak. However the cloak by\ntransformation optic has infinite speed and exceeding light speed etc\nfundamental difficulties. In this paper, we discover problem on acoustic cloak\nby transformation and prove that in the $0$ to $R_1$ radial spherical\ncoordinate transformation, the pressure wave field $P(r_p)=P(r)$ is invariant,\nin the physical inner spherical surface boundary $r=R_1$, $P(R_1)$ is not zero.\nthe acoustic field propagation penetrate into the inner sphere $r <\nR_1$.Therefore, the inner sphere $r < R_1$ can not be cloaked. The GL\nsimulation figures of the pressure acoustic wave propagation penetrate into the\ninner sphere $r \\le R_1$ are presented in figure 1 to figure 12.The pressure\nwave is setting to zero that cause the scattering wave to disturb incident\npressure acoustic wave outside of the outer sphere $r \\ge R_2$ that make the\nwhole sphere $r \\ge R_2$ will be deltected. GL method simulation is presented\nin figure 13. we discovered and proved that $0$ to $R_1$ sphere radial\ntransformation can not be used to induce acoustic no scattering cloak.\n", "  Efficient magnetic braking is a formidable obstacle to the formation of\nrotationally supported disks (RSDs) around protostars in magnetized dense\ncores. We have previously shown, through 2D (axisymmetric) non-ideal MHD\nsimulations, that removing very small grains (VSGs: ~10 \\AA$~$to few 100 \\AA)\ncan greatly enhance ambipolar diffusion and enable the formation of RSDs. Here\nwe extend the simulations of disk formation enabled by VSG removal to 3D. We\nfind that the key to this scenario of disk formation is that the drift velocity\nof the magnetic field almost cancels out the infall velocity of the neutrals in\nthe $10^2$-$10^3$ AU-scale \"pseudo-disk\" where the field lines are most\nseverely pinched and most of protostellar envelope mass infall occurs. As a\nresult, the bulk neutral envelope matter can collapse without dragging much\nmagnetic flux into the disk-forming region, which lowers the magnetic braking\nefficiency. We find that the initial disks enabled by VSG removal tend to be\nToomre-unstable, which leads to the formation of prominent spiral structures\nthat function as centrifugal barriers. The piling-up of infall material near\nthe centrifugal barrier often produces dense fragments of tens of Jupiter\nmasses, especially in cores that are not too strongly magnetized. Some\nfragments accrete onto the central stellar object, producing bursts in mass\naccretion rate. Others are longer lived, although whether they can survive\nlong-term to produce multiple systems remains to be ascertained. Our results\nhighlight the importance of dust grain evolution in determining the formation\nand properties of protostellar disks and potentially multiple systems.\n", "  Extreme mass ratio in-spirals (EMRIs) are candidate events for gravitational\nwave detection in the millihertz range (by detectors like LISA and eLISA).\nThese events involve a stellar-mass black hole, or a similar compact object,\ndescending in the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole, eventually\nmerging with it. Properties of the in-spiralling trajectory away from resonance\nare well known and have been studied extensively, however little is known about\nthe behaviour of these binary systems at resonance, when the radial and lateral\nfrequencies of the orbit become commensurate. We describe the two existing\nmodels, the instantaneous frequency approach used by Gair, Bender, and Yunes,\nand the standard two timescales approach implemented by Flanagan and Hinderer.\nIn both cases, the exact treatment depends on the modelling of the\ngravitational self-force, which is currently not available. We extend the\nresults in Gair, Bender and Yunes to higher order in the on-resonance flux\nmodification, and argue that the instantaneous frequency approach is also a\nvalid treatment of the resonance problem. The non-linear differential equations\nwhich arise in treating resonances are interesting from a mathematical view\npoint. We present our algorithm for perturbative solutions and the results to\nthird order in the infinitesimal parameter, and discuss the scope of this\napproach.\n", "  Most leading proposals for linear-optical quantum computing (LOQC) use\ncluster states, which act as a universal resource for measurement-based\n(one-way) quantum computation (MBQC). In ballistic approaches to LOQC, cluster\nstates are generated passively from small entangled resource states using\nso-called fusion operations. Results from percolation theory have previously\nbeen used to argue that universal cluster states can be generated in the\nballistic approach using schemes which exceed the critical threshold for\npercolation, but these results consider cluster states with unbounded size.\nHere we consider how successful percolation can be maintained using a physical\narchitecture with fixed physical depth, assuming that the cluster state is\ncontinuously generated and measured, and therefore that only a finite portion\nof it is visible at any one point in time. We show that universal LOQC can be\nimplemented using a constant-size device with modest physical depth, and that\npercolation can be exploited using simple pathfinding strategies without the\nneed for high-complexity algorithms.\n", "  We investigate the impact of thermal velocities in N-body simulations of\nstructure formation in warm dark matter models. Adopting the commonly used\napproach of adding thermal velocities, randomly selected from a Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution, to the gravitationally-induced velocities of the simulation\nparticles, we compare the matter and velocity power spectra measured from CDM\nand WDM simulations, in the latter case with and without thermal velocities.\nThis prescription for adding thermal velocities introduces numerical noise into\nthe initial conditions, which influences structure formation. At early times,\nthe noise affects dramatically the power spectra measured from simulations with\nthermal velocities, with deviations of the order of $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10)$ (in\nthe matter power spectra) and of the order of $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ (in the\nvelocity power spectra) compared to those extracted from simulations without\nthermal velocities. At late times, these effects are less pronounced with\ndeviations of less than a few percent. Increasing the resolution of the N-body\nsimulation shifts these discrepancies to higher wavenumbers. We also find that\nspurious haloes start to appear in simulations which include thermal velocities\nat a mass that is $\\sim$3 times larger than in simulations without thermal\nvelocities.\n", "  We study the screening of a bounded body $\\Gamma$ against the effect of a\nwind of charged particles, by means of a shield produced by a magnetic field\nwhich becomes infinite on the border of $\\Gamma$. The charged wind is modeled\nby a Vlasov-Poisson plasma, the bounded body by a torus, and the external\nmagnetic field is taken close to the border of $\\Gamma$. We study two models: a\nplasma composed by different species with positive or negative charges, and\nfinite total mass of each species, and another made of many species of the same\nsign, each having infinite mass. We investigate the time evolution of both\nsystems, showing in particular that the plasma particles cannot reach the body.\nFinally we discuss possible extensions to more general initial data. We show\nalso that when the magnetic lines are straight lines, (that imposes an\nunbounded body), the previous results can be improved.\n", "  We show evidence of the backscattering of quantum Hall edge channels in a\nnarrow graphene Hall bar, induced by the gating effect of the conducting tip of\na Scanning Gate Microscope, which we can position with nanometer precision. We\nshow full control over the edge channels and are able, due to the spatial\nvariation of the tip potential, to separate co-propagating edge channels in the\nHall bar, creating junctions between regions of different charge carrier\ndensity, that have not been observed in devices based on top- or split-gates.\nThe solution of the corresponding quantum scattering problem is presented to\nsubstantiate these results, and possible follow-up experiments are discussed.\n", "  In the first part of this paper, the many-particle quantum hydrodynamics\n(MPQHD) equations for a system containing many particles of different sorts are\nderived exactly from the many-particle Schr\\\"odinger equation. It includes the\nderivation of the many-particle continuity equations (MPCE), many-particle\nEhrenfest equations of motion (MPEEM), and many-particle quantum Cauchy\nequations (MPQCE) for any of the different particle sorts and for the total\nparticle ensemble. The new point in our analysis is that we consider a set of\narbitrary particles of different sorts in the system. In MPQCEs, there appears\na quantity called pressure tensor. In the second part of this paper, we analyze\ntwo versions of this tensor in depth -- the Wyatt pressure tensor and the\nKuzmenkov pressure tensor. There are different versions because there is a\ngauge freedom for the pressure tensor similar to that for potentials. We find\nthat the interpretation of all quantities contributing to the Wyatt pressure\ntensor is understandable but for the Kuzmenkov tensor, it is difficult.\nFurthermore, the transformation from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical\ncoordinates for the Wyatt tensor can be done in a clear way, but for the\nKuzmenkov tensor, it is rather cumbersome.\n", "  Parametric resonance is among the most efficient phenomena generating\ngravitational waves (GWs) in the early Universe. The dynamics of parametric\nresonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter\n$q$. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial\namplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to\nother species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed\nvalue(s) of $q$. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude\ndependence on $q$, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical\nresults. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a\nwide range of $q$ values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating\nscenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final\namplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our\nparametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW\nbackground today, for an arbitrary $q$. The GW signal can be rather large, as\n$h^2\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(f_p) \\lesssim 10^{-11}$, but it is always peaked at high\nfrequencies $f_p \\gtrsim 10^{7}$ Hz. We also discuss the case of\nspectator-field scenarios, where the oscillatory field can be e.g.~a curvaton,\nor the Standard Model Higgs.\n", "  We further elaborate on the proposal that the Higgs boson should be a broad\nheavy resonance, referred to as true Higgs $H_T$, with mass around $750 \\,\nGeV$.\n  We stress once again that within the Standard Model the true Higgs is the\nunique possibility to implement the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the local\ngauge symmetry by elementary, relativistic and strictly local scalar fields. We\ndiscuss the most relevant decay modes of the $H_T$ boson and estimate they\npartial decay widths and branching ratios. We discuss briefly the experimental\nsignatures of the $H_T$ Higgs boson and compare with the recent available LHC\ndata at $\\sqrt{s} =13 \\,TeV$. We find that the coupling of the $H_T$ Higgs\nboson to fermions is strongly suppressed.\n  We also compare our theoretical expectations in the so-called golden channel\nto the data collected by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at $\\sqrt{s} =13\n\\,TeV$ with an integrated luminosity of $36.1 \\, fb^{-1}$ and $35.9 \\, fb^{-1}$\nrespectively. We find that our theoretical expectations are in fair good\nagreement with the experimental observations. Combining the data from both the\nLHC Collaborations we obtain an evidence of the heavy Higgs boson in this\nchannel with an estimated statistical significance of more than three standard\ndeviations. Finally, we argue that, if the signal is real, by the end of the\nRun 2 both the LHC experiments will reach in the golden channel a statistical\nsignificance of about five standard deviations.\n", "  We consider a composite model where both the Higgs and a complex scalar\n$\\chi$, which is the dark matter (DM) candidate, arise as light pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) from a strongly coupled sector with TeV scale\nconfinement. The global symmetry structure is $SO(7)/SO(6)$, and the DM is\ncharged under an exact $U(1)_{\\rm DM} \\subset SO(6)$ that ensures its\nstability. Depending on whether the $\\chi$ shift symmetry is respected or\nbroken by the coupling of the top quark to the strong sector, the DM can be\nmuch lighter than the Higgs or have a weak-scale mass. Here we focus primarily\non the latter possibility. We introduce the lowest-lying composite resonances\nand impose calculability of the scalar potential via generalized Weinberg sum\nrules. Compared to previous analyses of pNGB DM, the computation of the relic\ndensity is improved by fully accounting for the effects of the fermionic top\npartners. This plays a crucial role in relaxing the tension with the current DM\ndirect detection constraints. The spectrum of resonances contains exotic top\npartners charged under the $U(1)_{\\rm DM}$, whose LHC phenomenology is\nanalyzed. We identify a region of parameters with $f = 1.4\\; \\mathrm{TeV}$ and\n$200\\;\\mathrm{GeV} \\lesssim m_\\chi \\lesssim 400\\;\\mathrm{GeV}$ that satisfies\nall existing bounds. This DM candidate will be tested by XENON1T in the near\nfuture.\n", "  In theories with the large extra dimensions beyond the standard 4-dimensional\nspacetime, axions could propagate in such extra dimensions, and acquire\nKaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. These KK axions are produced in the Sun and\ncould solve unexplained heating of the solar corona. While most of the solar KK\naxions escape from the solar system, a small fraction is gravitationally\ntrapped in orbits around the Sun. They would decay into two photons inside a\nterrestrial detector. The event rate is expected to modulate annually depending\non the distance from the Sun. We have searched for the annual modulation\nsignature using $832\\times 359$ kg$\\cdot$days of XMASS-I data. No significant\nevent rate modulation is found, and hence we set the first experimental\nconstraint on the KK axion-photon coupling of $4.8 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\n\\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 90% confidence level for a KK axion number density of\n$\\bar{n}_\\mathrm{a} = 4.07 \\times 10^{13}\\, \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, the total number\nof extra dimensions $n = 2$, and the number of extra dimensions $\\delta = 2$\nthat axions can propagate in.\n", "  The loop $O(n)$ model is a model for a random collection of non-intersecting\nloops on the hexagonal lattice, which is believed to be in the same\nuniversality class as the spin $O(n)$ model. It has been predicted by Nienhuis\nthat for $0\\le n\\le 2$ the loop $O(n)$ model exhibits a phase transition at a\ncritical parameter $x_c(n)=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2-n}}}$. For $0<n\\le 2$, the\ntransition line has been further conjectured to separate a regime with short\nloops when $x<x_c(n)$ from a regime with macroscopic loops when $x\\ge x_c(n)$.\n  In this paper, we prove that for $n\\in [1,2]$ and $x=x_c(n)$ the loop $O(n)$\nmodel exhibits macroscopic loops. This is the first instance in which a loop\n$O(n)$ model with $n\\neq 1$ is shown to exhibit such behaviour. A main tool in\nthe proof is a new positive association (FKG) property shown to hold when $n\n\\ge 1$ and $0<x\\le\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$. This property implies, using techniques\nrecently developed for the random-cluster model, the following dichotomy:\neither long loops are exponentially unlikely or the origin is surrounded by\nloops at any scale (box-crossing property). We develop a 'domain gluing'\ntechnique which allows us to employ Smirnov's parafermionic observable to rule\nout the first alternative when $x=x_c(n)$ and $n\\in[1,2]$.\n", "  In this paper, we utilize coupled mode theory (CMT) to model the coupling\nbetween surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) between multiple graphene sheets. By\nusing the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) Quantum Control\nTechnique, we propose a novel directional coupler based on SPPs evolution in\nthree layers of graphene sheets in some curved configuration. Our calculated\nresults show that the SPP can be transferred efficiently from the input\ngraphene sheet to the output graphene sheet, and the coupling is also robust\nthat it is not sensitive to the length of the device.\n", "  We investigate the viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma in strong magnetic\nfields within the leading-log and lowest Landau level (LLL) approximations. We\nfirst show that the bulk viscosity in the direction parallel to the magnetic\nfield is the only component that has a contribution from the quarks occupying\nthe LLL. We then compute the bulk viscosity from the Kubo formula and find an\nintriguing quark-mass dependence as a consequence of a competition between the\nsuppression of the bulk viscosity by conformal symmetry and an enhancement of\nthe mean-free path by chirality conservation, which governs the behavior in the\nmassless limit. The quark contribution to the viscosity along the magnetic\nfield becomes larger than the one in the absence of a magnetic field. We also\nbriefly estimate the other transport coefficients by considering the\ncontribution of gluons. We show that the shear viscosities are suppressed\ncompared to their values in the absence of a magnetic field.\n", "  We present the emergence of chimeras, a state referring to coexistence of\npartly coherent, partly incoherent dynamics in networks of identical\noscillators, in a multiplex network consisting of two non-identical layers\nwhich are interconnected. We demonstrate that the parameter range displaying\nthe chimera state in the homogeneous first layer of the multiplex networks can\nbe tuned by changing the link density or connection architecture of the same\nnodes in the second layer. We focus on the impact of the interconnected second\nlayer on the enlargement or shrinking of the coupling regime for which chimeras\nare displayed in the homogeneous first layer. We find that a denser homogeneous\nsecond layer promotes chimera in a sparse first layer, where chimeras do not\noccur in isolation. Furthermore, while a dense connection density is required\nfor the second layer if it is homogeneous, this is not true if the second layer\nis inhomogeneous. We demonstrate that a sparse inhomogeneous second layer which\nis common in real-world complex systems can promote chimera states in a sparse\nhomogeneous first layer.\n", "  We evolve stellar models to study the rotational profiles of the\npre-explosion cores of single massive stars that are progenitors of core\ncollapse supernovae (CCSNe), and find large rotational shear above the iron\ncore that might play an important role in the jet feedback explosion mechanism\nby amplifying magnetic fields before and after collapse. Initial masses of 15\nMo and 30 Mo and various values of the initial rotation velocity are\nconsidered, as well as a reduced mass-loss rate along the evolution and the\neffect of core-envelope coupling through magnetic fields. We find that the\nrotation profiles just before core collapse differ between models, but share\nthe following properties. (1) There are narrow zones of very large rotational\nshear adjacent to convective zones. (2) The rotation rate of the inner core is\nslower than required to form a Keplerian accretion disk. (3) The outer part of\nthe core and the envelope have non-negligible specific angular momentum\ncompared to the last stable orbit around a black hole (BH). Our results suggest\nthe feasibility of magnetic field amplification which might aid a jet-driven\nexplosion leaving behind a neutron star. Alternatively, if the inner core fails\nin exploding the star, an accretion disk from the outer parts of the core might\nform and lead to a jet-driven CCSN which leaves behind a BH.\n", "  The gravitational-wave (GW) asteroseismology is a powerful technique for\nextracting interior information of compact objects. In this work, we focus on\nspacetime modes, the so-called $w$-modes, of GWs emitted from a proto-neutron\nstar (PNS) in the postbounce phase of core-collapse supernovae. Using results\nfrom recent three-dimensional supernova models, we study how to infer the\nproperties of the PNS based on a quasi-normal mode analysis in the context of\nthe GW asteroseismology. We find that the $w_1$-mode frequency multiplied by\nthe PNS radius is expressed as a linear function with respect to the ratio of\nthe PNS mass to the PNS radius. This relation is insensitive to the nuclear\nequation of state (EOS) employed in this work. Combining with another universal\nrelation of the $f$-mode oscillations, we point out that the time dependent\nmass-radius relation of the PNS can be obtained by observing both the $f$- and\n$w_1$-mode GWs simultaneously. Our results suggest that the simultaneous\ndetection of the two modes could provide a new probe into finite-temperature\nnuclear EOS that predominantly determines the PNS evolution.\n", "  We show that time-resolved x-ray scattering from molecules prepared in a\nsuperposition of electronic states moving through an avoided crossing has new\nfeatures not found in diffraction from the corresponding classical mixed state.\nPhotoabsorption in molecular iodine at 520 nm produces a superposition of two\ndipole-allowed nearly degenerate electronic states, which interact due to\nnon-adiabatic coupling. We show experimental evidence that the mixing of the\nnuclear wavepackets from the two electronic states at the avoided crossing\nleads to ultrafast changes in the angular composition of the scattering\npattern. This provides a novel means to study transitions in excited molecular\nsystems. We reconstruct a movie of the nuclear probability density arising from\nthis interference.\n", "  Given a large population, it is an intensive task to gather individual\npreferences over a set of alternatives and arrive at an aggregate or collective\npreference of the population. We show that social network underlying the\npopulation can be harnessed to accomplish this task effectively, by sampling\npreferences of a small subset of representative nodes. We first develop a\nFacebook app to create a dataset consisting of preferences of nodes and the\nunderlying social network, using which, we develop models that capture how\npreferences are distributed among nodes in a typical social network. We hence\npropose an appropriate objective function for the problem of selecting best\nrepresentative nodes. We devise two algorithms, namely, Greedy-min which\nprovides a performance guarantee for a wide class of popular voting rules, and\nGreedy-sum which exhibits excellent performance in practice. We compare the\nperformance of these proposed algorithms against random-polling and popular\ncentrality measures, and provide a detailed analysis of the obtained results.\nOur analysis suggests that selecting representatives using social network\ninformation is advantageous for aggregating preferences related to personal\ntopics (e.g., lifestyle), while random polling with a reasonable sample size is\ngood enough for aggregating preferences related to social topics (e.g.,\ngovernment policies).\n", "  The ubiquity of high-energy tails in the charged particle velocity\ndistribution functions observed in space plasmas suggests the existence of an\nunderlying process responsible for taking a fraction of the charged particle\npopulation out of thermal equilibrium and redistributing it to suprathermal\nvelocity and energy ranges. The present Letter focuses on a new and fundamental\nphysical explanation for the origin of suprathermal electron distribution\nfunction in a highly collisional plasma. This process involves a newly\ndiscovered electrostatic bremsstrahlung emission that is effective in a plasma\nin which binary collisions are present. The steady-state electron velocity\ndistribution function dictated by such a process corresponds to a Maxwellian\ncore plus a quasi-inverse power-law tail, which is a feature commonly observed\nin many space plasma environment. In order to demonstrate this, the system of\nself-consistent particle- and wave- kinetic equations are numerically solved\nwith an initially Maxwellian electron velocity distribution and Langmuir wave\nspectral intensity, which is a state that does not reflect the presence of\nelectrostatic bremsstrahlung process, and hence not in force balance. The\nelectrostatic bremsstrahlung term subsequently drives the system to a new\nforce-balanced steady state. After a long integration period it is demonstrated\nthe initial Langmuir fluctuation spectrum is modified, which in turn distorts\nthe initial Maxwellian electron distribution into a velocity distribution that\nresembles the said core-suprathermal velocity distribution. Such a mechanism\nmay thus be operative at the coronal source region, which is characterized by\nhigh collisionality.\n", "  We present a symmetry-based approach for shape coexistence in nuclei, founded\non the concept of partial dynamical symmetry (PDS). The latter corresponds to a\nsituation when only selected states (or bands of states) of the coexisting\nconfigurations preserve the symmetry while other states are mixed. We construct\nexplicitly critical-point Hamiltonians with two or three PDSs of the type U(5),\nSU(3), ${\\overline{\\rm SU(3)}}$ and SO(6), appropriate to double or triple\ncoexistence of spherical, prolate, oblate and $\\gamma$-soft deformed shapes,\nrespectively. In each case, we analyze the topology of the energy surface with\nmultiple minima and corresponding normal modes. Characteristic features and\nsymmetry attributes of the quantum spectra and wave functions are discussed.\nAnalytic expressions for quadrupole moments and $E2$ rates involving the\nremaining solvable states are derived and isomeric states are identified by\nmeans of selection rules.\n", "  English translation of a Russian article from 1928. Translator's abstract:\nThe article presents general considerations on the validity of the\nsuperposition principle for light in vacuo from out a quantum theoretic point\nof view. It contains a report on an optical experiment designed to detect the\nphenomenon of photon-photon scattering. To understand the negative result of\nthe performed experiment, a consideration of the solar corona is undertaken in\norder to derive an empirical upper limit on the photon-photon scattering rate.\nSource details: S.

In particular, models with anisotropic\ncurvature and isotropic expansion leads both to a $\\Lambda$CDM-like\nphenomenology and to an isotropic and homogeneous CMB at the background level.\nThus, they offer an interesting and viable example where the cosmological\nprinciple does not follow from the isotropy of observational data. In this\npaper we extract the linear dynamics of tensor perturbations in two classes of\ncosmologies with anisotropic spatial curvature. Two difficulties arise in\ncomparison to the same computation in isotropic cosmologies. First, the two\ntensor polarizations do not behave as a spin-2 field, but rather as the spin-0\nand spin-1 irreducible components of a symmetric, traceless and transverse\ntensor field, each with its own dynamics. Second, because metric perturbations\nare algebraically coupled, one cannot ignore scalar and vector modes and focus\njust on tensors --- even if one is only interested in the latter --- under the\npenalty of obtaining the wrong equations of motion. We illustrate our results\nby finding analytical solutions and evaluating the power-spectra of tensor\npolarizations in a radiation dominated universe. We conclude with some comments\non how these models could be constrained with future experiments on CMB\npolarization.\n", "  Improved understanding of the dynamics of runaway electrons can be obtained\nby measurement and interpretation of their synchrotron radiation emission.\nModels for synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons are well\nestablished, but the question of how various geometric effects -- such as\nmagnetic field inhomogeneity and camera placement -- influence the synchrotron\nmeasurements and their interpretation remains open. In this paper we address\nthis issue by simulating synchrotron images and spectra using the new synthetic\nsynchrotron diagnostic tool SOFT (Synchrotron-detecting Orbit Following\nToolkit). We identify the key parameters influencing the synchrotron radiation\nspot and present scans in those parameters. Using a runaway electron\ndistribution function obtained by Fokker-Planck simulations for parameters from\nan Alcator C-Mod discharge, we demonstrate that the corresponding synchrotron\nimage is well-reproduced by SOFT simulations, and we explain how it can be\nunderstood in terms of the parameter scans. Geometric effects are shown to\nsignificantly influence the synchrotron spectrum, and we show that inherent\ninconsistencies in a simple emission model (i.e. not modeling detection) can\nlead to incorrect interpretation of the images.\n", "  We present a general class of operators resembling compact tetraquarks which\nhave a range of colour-flavour-spin structures, transform irreducibly under the\nsymmetries of the lattice and respect other relevant symmetries. These\nconstructions are demonstrated in lattice QCD calculations with light quarks\ncorresponding to $m_\\pi =$ 391 MeV. Using the distillation framework,\ncorrelation functions involving large bases of meson-meson and tetraquark\noperators are computed in the isospin-1 hidden-charm and doubly-charmed\nsectors, and finite-volume spectra are extracted with the variational method.\nWe find the spectra are insensitive to the addition of tetraquark operators to\nthe bases of meson-meson operators. For the first time, through using diverse\nbases of meson-meson operators, the multiple energy levels associated with\nmeson-meson levels which would be degenerate in the non-interacting limit are\nextracted reliably. The number of energy levels in each spectrum is found to be\nequal to the number of expected non-interacting meson-meson levels in the\nenergy region considered and the majority of energies lie close to the\nnon-interacting levels. Therefore, there is no strong indication for any bound\nstate or narrow resonance in the channels we study.\n", "  We study the quasi-normal modes of asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes\nin a class of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories where a gravitational scalar\nis derivatively coupled to the Einstein tensor. The space-time differs from\nexact Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter, resulting in a different effective\npotential for the quasi-normal modes and a different spectrum. We numerically\ncompute this spectrum for a massless test scalar coupled both minimally to the\nmetric, and non-minimally to the gravitational scalar. We find interesting\ndifferences from the Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole found in general\nrelativity.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the generation of far-field propagating optical\nbeams with a desired orbital angular momentum by using an archetypical\nmagnetoplasmonic tip surrounded by a gold spiral slit. The use of a magnetic\nmaterial can lead to important implications once magneto-optical activity is\nactivated through the application of an external magnetic field. The physical\nmodel and the numerical study presented here introduce the concept of\nmagnetically tunable plasmonic vortex lens, namely a magnetoplasmonic vortex\nlens, which ensures a tunable selectivity in the polarization state of the\ngenerated nanostructured beam. The presented system provides a promising\nplatform for a localized excitation of plasmonic vortices followed by their\nbeaming in the far-field with an active modulation of both light's\ntransmittance and helicity.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to control localization properties of the\nasymptotic state of an open quantum system with a tunable synthetic\ndissipation. The control mechanism relies on the matching between properties of\ndissipative operators, acting on neighboring sites and specified by a single\ncontrol parameter, and the spatial phase structure of eigenstates of the system\nHamiltonian. As a result, the latter coincide (or near coincide) with the dark\nstates of the operators. In a disorder-free Hamiltonian with a flat band, one\ncan either obtain a localized asymptotic state or populate whole flat and/or\ndispersive bands, depending on the value of the control parameter. In a\ndisordered Anderson system, the asymptotic state can be localized anywhere in\nthe spectrum of the Hamiltonian. The dissipative control is robust with respect\nto an additional local dephasing.\n", "  If super-Yang-Mills theory possesses the exact conformal invariance, there is\nan additional modular invariance under the change of the complex bare charge\n$\\tau = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}+ \\frac{4\\pi\\imath}{g^2}\\longrightarrow\n-\\frac{1}{\\tau}$. The low-energy Seiberg-Witten prepotential ${\\cal F}(a)$,\nhowever, is not explicitly invariant, because the flat moduli also change $a\n\\longrightarrow a_D = \\partial{\\cal F}/\\partial a$. In result, the prepotential\nis not a modular form and depends also on the anomalous Eisenstein series\n$E_2$. This dependence is usually described by the universal MNW modular\nanomaly equation. We demonstrate that, in the $6d$ $SU(N)$ theory with {\\it\ntwo} independent modular parameters $\\tau$ and $\\hat \\tau$, the modular anomaly\nequation changes, because the modular transform of $\\tau$ is accompanied by an\n($N$-dependent!) shift of $\\hat\\tau$ and vice versa. This is a new peculiarity\nof double-elliptic systems, which deserves further investigation.\n", "  Representing large-scale motions and topological changes in the finite volume\n(FV) framework, while at the same time preserving the accuracy of the numerical\nsolution, is difficult. In this paper, we present a robust, highly efficient\nmethod designed to achieve this capability. The proposed approach conceptually\nshares many of the characteristics of the cut-cell interface tracking method,\nbut without the need for complex cell splitting/merging operations. The heart\nof the new technique is to align existing mesh facets with the geometry to be\nrepresented. We then modify the matrix contributions from these facets such\nthat they are represented in an identical fashion to traditional boundary\nconditions. The collection of such faces is named a Generalised Internal\nBoundary (GIB). In order to introduce motion into the system, we rely on the\nclassical ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) approach, but with the caveat\nthat the non-time-dependent motion of elements instantaneously crossing the\ninterface is handled separately from the time dependent component. The new\nmethodology is validated through comparison with: a) a body-fitted grid\nsimulation of an oscillating two dimensional cylinder and b) experimental\nresults of a butterfly valve.\n", "  We consider a buckled quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), such as silicene,\nproximity-coupled to a conventional spin-singlet, s-wave superconductor. Even\nlimiting the discussion to the disorder-robust s-wave pairing symmetry, we find\nboth odd-frequency ($\\omega$), spin-singlet and spin-triplet pair amplitudes\nand where both preserve time-reversal symmetry. Our results show that there are\ntwo unrelated mechanisms generating these different odd-$\\omega$ pair\namplitudes. The spin-singlet state is due to the strong inter-orbital processes\npresent in the QSHI. It is exists generically at the edges of the QSHI, but\nalso in the bulk in heavily doped regime if an electric field is applied. The\nspin-triplet state requires a finite gradient in the proximity-induced\nsuperconducting order along the edge, which we find is automatically generated\nat the atomic scale for armchair edges but not at zigzag edges. In combination\nthese results make superconducting QSHIs a very exciting venue for\ninvestigating not only the existence of odd-$\\omega$ superconductivity, but\nalso the interplay between different odd-$\\omega$ states.\n", "  The implications of two different time constraints on the\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations are discussed under three spin\nsupplementary conditions (SSC). For this reason the MPD equations are revisited\nwithout specifying the affine parameter and several relations are reintroduced\nin their general form. The latter allows to investigate the consequences of\ncombining the Mathisson-Pirani (MP) SSC, the Tulczyjew-Dixon (TD) SSC and the\nOhashi-Kyrian-Semer\\'{a}k (OKS) SSC with two affine parameter types: the proper\ntime on one hand and the parameterizations introduced in [Gen. Rel. Grav. 8,\n197 (1977)] on the other. For the MP SSC and the TD SSC it is shown that\nquantities that are constant of motion for the one affine parameter are not for\nthe other, while for the OKS SSC it is shown that the two affine parameters are\nthe same. To clarify the relation between the two affine parameters in the case\nof the TD SSC the MPD equations are evolved and discussed.\n", "  The increasing complexity of the aperture geometry of the future space- and\nground based-telescopes will limit the performance of the next generation of\ncoronagraphic instruments for high contrast imaging of exoplanets. We propose\nhere a new closed-loop optimization technique using two deformable mirrors to\ncorrect for the effects of complex apertures on coronagraph performance,\nalternative to the ACAD technique previously developed by our group. This\ntechnique, ACAD-OSM, allows the use of any coronagraphs designed for continuous\napertures, with complex, segmented, apertures, maintaining high performance in\ncontrast and throughput. We show the capabilities of this technique on several\npupil geometries (segmented LUVOIR type aperture, WFIRST, ELTs) for which we\nobtained high contrast levels with several deformable mirror setups (size,\nnumber of actuators, separation between them), coronagraphs (apodized pupil\nLyot and vortex coronagraphs) and spectral bandwidths, which will help us\npresent recommendations for future coronagraphic instruments. We show that this\nactive technique handles, without any revision to the algorithm, changing or\nunknown optical aberrations or discontinuities in the pupil, including optical\ndesign misalignments, missing segments and phase errors.\n", "  In order to examine the pulse profile from a pulsar, we derive the formula\nfor describing the flux from antipodal hot spots with any static, spherically\nsymmetric spacetime. We find that the pulse profiles are almost independent of\nthe gravitational geometry outside the star when the compactness of neutron\nstars is low enough, e.g., the stellar mass and radius are $1.4M_\\odot$ and 14\nkm, respectively. On the other hand, the pulse profiles depend strongly on the\ngravitational geometry when the compactness of neutron stars is so high, e.g.,\nthe stellar mass and radius are $1.8M_\\odot$ and 10 km, respectively. Thus, one\nmay probe the spacetime geometry outside the star and even distinguish\ngravitational theories via the observation of pulse profile with the help of\nanother observations for the stellar compactness, if the compactness of central\nobject is high enough. We also derive the 1st and 2nd order approximation of\nthe flux with respect to a parameter defined by the radio of the gravitational\nradius of considered spacetime to the stellar radius. Then, we find that the\nrelative error from full order numerical results in the bending angle becomes\n$\\sim 20-30\\%$ with the 1st order and $\\sim 5-10\\%$ with the 2nd order\napproximations for a typical neutron star, whose mass and radius are\n$1.4M_\\odot$ and 12 km, respectively. Our results with the 1st order\napproximation for the Schwarzschild spacetime are different from those obtained\nin the literature, which suggests that the 1st order approximation has been\nmisunderstood to yield highly accurate prediction.\n", "  We discuss some interesting aspects of the well known quantum equivalence\nbetween the $O(3)-\\sigma$ and $CP_1$ models in $3D$, working in the canonical\nand in the path integral formulations. We show first that the canonical\nquantization in the hamiltonian formulation is free of ordering ambiguities for\nboth models. We use the canonical map between the fields and momenta of the two\nmodels and compute the relevant functional determinant to verify the\nequivalence between the phase-space partition functions and the quantum\nequivalence in all the topological sectors. We also use the explicit form of\nthe map to construct the soliton operator of the $O(3)-\\sigma$ model starting\nfrom the representation of the operator in the $CP_1$ model, and discuss their\nproperties\n", "  Precise detection of spin resonance is of paramount importance to achieve\ncoherent spin control in quantum computing. We present a novel setup for spin\nresonance measurements, which uses a dc-SQUID flux detector coupled to an\nantenna from a coplanar waveguide. The SQUID and the waveguide are fabricated\nfrom 20~nm Nb thin film, allowing high magnetic field operation with the field\napplied parallel to the chip. We observe a resonance signal between the first\nand third excited states of Gd spins $S=7/2$ in a CaWO$_4$ crystal, relevant\nfor state control in multi-level systems.\n", "  The pulse profile from a neutron star in scalar-tensor theory of gravity is\nexamined for several stellar models, where we assume the existence of the\nantipodal hot spots on the neutron star based on the polar cap model. Then, we\nfind that the pulse profile from the scalarized neutron star in scalar-tensor\ngravity is almost the same as that in general relativity, i.e., without a\nscalar field, if the stellar compactness of the both stars is very similar.\nThat is, the existence of the scalar field does not directly change the pulse\nprofile from the neutron star, while the stellar compactness is crucial for\ndetermining the pulse shape even in the scalar-tensor gravity. Additionally, we\nfind that the pulse shape from the scalarized neutron star is more or less\nsimilar to that from the neutron star with the same mass in general relativity,\nwhile the ratio of the minimum amplitude to the maximum amplitude in the pulse\nprofile depend strongly on the coupling constant in scalar-tensor gravity,\ndepending on the angle between the rotational and magnetic axes and the angle\nbetween the rotational axis and the direction to the observer. So, the direct\nobservation of the pulse profile together with the additional observation of\nthe stellar mass, one may extract the imprint of the gravitational theory in\nstrong field regime.\n", "  The nested sampling algorithm has been shown to be a general method for\ncalculating the pressure-temperature-composition phase diagrams of materials.\nWhile the previous implementation used single-particle Monte Carlo moves, these\nare inefficient for condensed systems with general interactions where\nsingle-particle moves cannot be evaluated faster than the energy of the whole\nsystem. Here we enhance the method by using all-particle moves: either Galilean\nMonte Carlo or a total enthalpy Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm, introduced\nin this paper. We show that these algorithms enable the determination of phase\ntransition temperatures with equivalent accuracy to the previous method at\n$1/N$ of the cost for an $N$-particle system with general interactions, or at\nequal cost when single particle moves can be done in $1/N$ of the cost of a\nfull $N$-particle energy evaluation.\n", "  This century the situation has changed: neutrino oscillations have shown that\nthe SM is incomplete. On the other hand, we have not found signs of SUSY, which\nis seen as the best candidate for New Dynamics (ND). We should search for ND\nindirectly with accuracy in regions that are above what LHC can find it\ndirectly. General comments: (a) QCD is the only local quantum field theory to\ndescribe strong forces. We have to apply non-perturbative QCD on different\nlevels to flavor dynamics in strange, charm \\& beauty hadrons and even for top\nquarks. We need consistent parameterization of the CKM matrix and apply to weak\ndecays of beauty hadrons with many-body final states. (b) It is crucial to use\nthe Wilsonian OPE as much as possible and discuss \"duality\" in the worlds of\nquarks and hadrons. The pole mass of heavy quarks is {\\em not} well-defined on\nthe non-perturbative level -- i.e., it is {\\em not} Borel summable in total\nQCD. (c) We need a novel team to combine the strengths of our tools from MEP\nand HEP.\n", "  This work presents a depleted monolithic active pixel sensor (DMAPS)\nprototype manufactured in the LFoundry 150 nm CMOS process. The described\ndevice, named LF-Monopix, was designed as a proof of concept of a fully\nmonolithic sensor capable of operating in the environment of outer layers of\nthe ATLAS Inner Tracker upgrade for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\n(HL-LHC). Implementing such a device in the detector module will result in a\nlower production cost and lower material budget compared to the presently used\nhybrid designs. In this paper the chip architecture will be described followed\nby the simulation and measurement results.\n", "  We present results of the eigenvalue spectrum for the staggered Dir\\\"ac\noperator obtained using a modified Lanczos algorithm. We identify zero modes\nand non-zero modes. We derive the chiral Ward identity derived from the\nconserved $U(1)_A$ symmetry, and check it numerically. This is the first step\ntoward construction of an improved method to identify zero modes reliably with\nstaggered fermions.\n", "  The phonon dispersion, density of states, Gr\\\"{u}neisen parameters, and the\nlattice thermal conductivity of single- and multi-layered boron nitride were\ncalculated using first-principles methods. For the bulk {\\it h}-BN we also\nreport the two-phonon density of states. We also present simple analytical\nsolutions to the acoustic vibrational mode-dependent lattice thermal\nconductivity. Moreover, computations based on the elaborate Callaway-Klemens\nand the real space super cell methods are presented to calculate the sample\nlength and temperature dependent lattice thermal conductivity of single- and\nmulti-layered hexagonal boron nitride which shows good agreement with\nexperimental data.\n", "  It is not known how single white dwarfs with masses less than 0.5Msolar --\nlow-mass white dwarfs -- are formed. One way in which such a white dwarf might\nbe formed is after the merger of a helium-core white dwarf with a main-sequence\nstar that produces a red giant branch star and fails to ignite helium. We use a\nstellar-evolution code to compute models of the remnants of these mergers and\nfind a relation between the pre-merger masses and the final white dwarf mass.\nCombining our results with a model population, we predict that the mass\ndistribution of single low-mass white dwarfs formed through this channel spans\nthe range 0.37 to 0.5Msolar and peaks between 0.45 and 0.46Msolar. Helium white\ndwarf--main-sequence star mergers can also lead to the formation of single\nhelium white dwarfs with masses up to 0.51Msolar. In our model the Galactic\nformation rate of single low-mass white dwarfs through this channel is about\n8.7X10^-3yr^-1. Comparing our models with observations, we find that the\nmajority of single low-mass white dwarfs (<0.5Msolar) are formed from helium\nwhite dwarf--main-sequence star mergers, at a rate which is about $2$ per cent\nof the total white dwarf formation rate.\n", "  In this review we give an overview of recent work on quantum kinetic theories\nof plasmas. We focus, in particular, on the case where the electrons are fully\ndegenerate. For such systems, perturbation methods using the distribution\nfunction can be problematic. Instead we present a model that considers the\ndynamics of the Fermi surface. The advantage of this model is that, even though\nthe value of the distribution function can be greatly perturbed outside the\nequilibrium Fermi surface, deformation of Fermi surface is small up very large\namplitudes. Next, we investigate the short-scale dynamics for which the\nWigner-Moyal equation replaces the Vlasov equation. In particular, we study\nwave-particle interaction, and deduce that new types of wave damping can occur\ndue to the simultaneous absorption (or emission) of multiple wave quanta.\nFinally, we consider exchange effects within a quantum kinetic formalism to\nfind a model more accurate than ones using exchange potentials from density\nfunctional theory. We deduce the exchange corrections to the dispersion\nrelations for Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves. Comparing with results based on\nexchange potentials deduced from density functional theory we find that the\nlatter models are reasonably accurate for Langmuir waves, but rather inaccurate\nfor ion acoustic waves.\n", "  Anapole states associated with the resonant suppression of electric-dipole\nscattering exhibit minimized extinction and maximized storage of\nelectromagnetic energy inside a particle. Using numerical simulations, optical\nextinction spectroscopy and amplitude-phase near-field mapping of silicon\ndielectric disks, we demonstrate high-order anapole states in the near-infrared\nwavelength range (900-1700 nm). We develop the procedure for unambiguously\nidentifying anapole states by monitoring the normal component of the electric\nnear-field and experimentally detect the first two anapole states as verified\nby far-field extinction spectroscopy and confirmed with the numerical\nsimulations. We demonstrate that higher order anapole states possess stronger\nenergy concentration and narrower resonances, a remarkable feature that is\nadvantageous for their applications in metasurfaces and nanophotonics\ncomponents, such as non-linear higher-harmonic generators and nanoscale lasers.\n", "  Hydra is a header-only, templated and C++11-compliant framework designed to\nperform the typical bottleneck calculations found in common HEP data analyses\non massively parallel platforms. The framework is implemented on top of the\nC++11 Standard Library and a variadic version of the Thrust library and is\ndesigned to run on Linux systems, using OpenMP, CUDA and TBB enabled devices.\nThis contribution summarizes the main features of Hydra. A basic description of\nthe overall design, functionality and user interface is provided, along with\nsome code examples and measurements of performance.\n", "  Here we investigate the possibility that the asteroid 1I/2017 U1 actually is\na Solar System object, currently expelled from the Solar System by the recent\nencouter with a Solar System planet. We show that this possibility is extremely\nunlikeley and that 1I/2017 U1 really is an interstellar object.\n", "  In ordinary situations involving a small part of the universe, Born's rule\nseems to work well for calculating probabilities of observations in quantum\ntheory. However, there are a number of reasons for believing that it is not\nadequate for many cosmological purposes. Here a number of possible\ngeneralizations of Born's rule are discussed, explaining why they are\nconsistent with the present statistical support for Born's rule in ordinary\nsituations but can help solve various cosmological problems.\n", "  We present a new experimental approach to investigate the magnetic properties\nof the anisotropic heavy-fermion system YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ as a function of\ncrystallographic orientation. Angle-dependent electron spin resonance (ESR)\nmeasurements are performed at a low temperature of 1.6 K and at an ESR\nfrequency of 4.4 GHz utilizing a superconducting planar microwave resonator in\na $^4$He-cryostat in combination with in-situ sample rotation. The obtained ESR\ng-factor of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ as a function of the crystallographic angle is\nconsistent with results of previous measurements using conventional ESR\nspectrometers at higher frequencies and fields. Perspectives to implement this\nexperimental approach into a dilution refrigerator and to reach the\nmagnetically ordered phase of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ are discussed.\n", "  The optimal frequency for interstellar communication, using \"Earth 2017\"\ntechnology, was derived in papers I and II of this series (arXiv:1706.03795,\narXiv:1706.05570). The framework included models for the loss of photons from\ndiffraction (free space), interstellar extinction, and atmospheric\ntransmission. A major limit of current technology is the focusing of\nwavelengths $\\lambda<300\\,$nm (UV). When this technological constraint is\ndropped, a physical bound is found at $\\lambda\\approx1\\,$nm ($E\\approx\\,$keV)\nfor distances out to kpc. While shorter wavelengths may produce tighter beams\nand thus higher data rates, the physical limit comes from surface roughness of\nfocusing devices at the atomic level. This limit can be surpassed by\nbeam-forming with electromagnetic fields, e.g. using a free electron laser, but\nsuch methods are not energetically competitive. Current lasers are not yet cost\nefficient at nm wavelengths, with a gap of two orders of magnitude, but future\ntechnological progress may converge on the physical optimum. We recommend\nexpanding SETI efforts towards targeted (at us) monochromatic (or narrow band)\nX-ray emission at 0.5-2 keV energies.\n", "  The University of Michigan 26-m paraboloid was dedicated to obtaining linear\npolarization and total flux density observations of blazars from the mid-1960s\nuntil June 2012 providing an unprecedented record tracking centimeter-band\nvariability over decades at 14.5, 8.0, and 4.8 GHz for both targeted objects\nand members of flux-limited samples. In the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s,\nand during the last decade of the program, observations were additionally\nobtained of circular polarization for a small sample of radio-bright (S>5Jy),\nactive sources. Key program results include evidence supporting class-dependent\ndifferences in the magnetic field geometry of BL Lac and QSO jets,\nidentification of linear polarization changes temporally associated with flux\noutbursts supporting a shock-in-jet scenario, and determination of the spectral\nevolution of the Stokes V amplitude and polarity for testing proposed models.\nRecent radiative transfer modeling during large flares supports a jet scenario\nwith a kinetically-dominated, relativistic flow at parsec scales with embedded\nturbulent magnetic fields and dynamically-weak ordered components which may be\nhelical; the circular polarization observations are consistent with\nlinear-to-circular mode conversion within this turbulent jet environment.\n", "  Modern electronics rely on devices whose functionality can be adjusted by the\nend-user with an external 'knob'. A new tuning knob to modify the band gap of\nblack phosphorus has been experimentally demonstrated.\n", "  Bottom-up graphene nanoribbon (GNR) heterojunctions are nanoscale strips of\ngraphene whose electronic structure abruptly changes across a covalently bonded\ninterface. Their rational design offers opportunities for profound\ntechnological advancements enabled by their extraordinary structural and\nelectronic properties. Thus far the most critical aspect of their synthesis,\nthe control over sequence and position of heterojunctions along the length of a\nribbon, has been plagued by randomness in monomer sequences emerging from\nstep-growth copolymerization of distinct monomers. All bottom-up GNR\nheterojunction structures created so far have exhibited random sequences of\nheterojunctions and, while useful for fundamental scientific studies, are\ndifficult to incorporate into functional nanodevices as a result. Here we\ndescribe a new hierarchical fabrication strategy that allows deterministic\ngrowth of bottom-up GNRs that preferentially exhibit a single heterojunction\ninterface rather than a random statistical sequence of junctions along the\nribbon. Such heterojunctions provide a viable new platform that could be\ndirectly used in functional GNR-based device applications at the molecular\nscale. Our hierarchical GNR fabrication strategy is based on differences in the\ndissociation energies of C-Br and C-I bonds that allow control over the growth\nsequence of the block-copolymers from which GNRs are formed, and consequently\nyields a significantly higher proportion of single-junction GNR\nheterostructures. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and density functional\ntheory calculations confirm that hierarchically-grown heterojunctions between\nchevron GNR (cGNR) and binaphthyl-cGNR segments exhibit straddling Type I band\nalignment in structures that are only one atomic layer thick and 3 nm in width.\n", "  In this paper, we solve the D-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation with\nhyperbolic Poschl-Teller potential plus a generalized ring-shaped potential.\nAfter the separation of variable in the hyperspherical coordinate. We used\nNikiforov-Uvarov (NU) method to solve the resulting radial equation and obtain\nexplicitly the energy level and the corresponding wave function in closed form.\nThe solutions to the angular part are solved using the NU approach as well.\n", "  We study the fracture of reversible double transient networks, constituted of\nwater suspensions of entangled surfactant wormlike micelles reversibly linked\nby various amounts of telechelic polymers. We provide a state diagram that\ndelineates the regime of fracture without necking of the filament from the\nregime where no fracture or break-up has been observed. We show that filaments\nfracture when stretched at a rate larger than the inverse of the slowest\nrelaxation time of the networks. We quantitatively demonstrate that dissipation\nprocesses are not relevant in our experimental conditions and that, depending\non the density of nodes in the networks, fracture occurs in the linear\nviscoelastic regime or in a non-linear regime. In addition, analysis of the\ncrack opening profiles indicates deviations from a parabolic shape close to the\ncrack tip for weakly connected networks. We demonstrate a direct correlation\nbetween the amplitude of the deviation from the parabolic shape and the amount\nof non linear viscoelasticity.\n", "  Many earth science applications require data at both high spatial and\ntemporal resolution for effective monitoring of various ecosystem resources.\nDue to practical limitations in sensor design, there is often a trade-off in\ndifferent resolutions of spatio-temporal datasets and hence a single sensor\nalone cannot provide the required information. Various data fusion methods have\nbeen proposed in the literature that mainly rely on individual timesteps when\nboth datasets are available to learn a mapping between features values at\ndifferent resolutions using local relationships between pixels. Earth\nobservation data is often plagued with spatially and temporally correlated\nnoise, outliers and missing data due to atmospheric disturbances which pose a\nchallenge in learning the mapping from a local neighborhood at individual\ntimesteps. In this paper, we aim to exploit time-independent global\nrelationships between pixels for robust transfer of information across\ndifferent scales. Specifically, we propose a new framework, ORBIT (Ordering\nBased Information Transfer) that uses relative ordering constraint among pixels\nto transfer information across both time and scales. The effectiveness of the\nframework is demonstrated for global surface water monitoring using both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets.\n", "  Photometric observations of the low-mass X-ray binary system A0620-00=V616\nMon are performed in the optical (unfiltered light, lambda_eff~6400A) and the\nnear-infrared J and K-bands. The mean system flux, the orbital light curve\nshape and the flickering amplitude dependences on wavelength are examined for\ntwo activity stages of the system remaining in quiescence.\n  In 2015-16 A0620-00 was in passive stage (as by Cantrell et al., 2008)\nexhibiting the regular orbital light curves and low flickering. In less than\n230 days in 2016-17 the system switched into active stage: the brightness\nincreased by ~0.2-0.3 mag, the orbital light curve changed while the flickering\namplitude increased more than twice.\n  The object regular orbital light curves were fitted by models with \"cold\"\nspots on the optical star surface and without those. These models reproduce the\nobserved orbital light curves both in passive and in active stages.\n  The dependence of the mean square flickering amplitude (in fluxes, extinction\ncorrected) on wavelength is computed in the lambda 6400-22000AA range. In\nactive stage, the observed flickering amplitude decreases over the whole\nstudied range and may be represented as Delta F_fl~lambda^{-2} which\ncorresponds to the free-free emission of optically thin high-temperature\nplasma.\n  In passive stage, flickering obeys Delta F_fl~lambda^{-4} law in the range\n6400-12500AA that corresponds to the thermal radiation of optically thick\nhigh-temperature plasma. At longer wavelengths the flickering amplitude\ndependence is flat which may imply existence of a synchrotron component of the\nrelativistic jets emission.\n  These flickering features let us propose that the flickering mechanism\nincludes at least two components: thermal and, apparently, synchrotron, that\nagrees with the recent discovery of the variable linear polarization of the IR\nsystem emission (Russell et al., 2016).\n", "  We consider an energy-based boundary condition to impose an equilibrium\nwetting angle for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes phase-field model on\nvoxel-set-type computational domains. These domains typically stem from the\nmicro-CT imaging of porous rock and approximate a (on {\\mu}m scale) smooth\ndomain with a certain resolution. Planar surfaces that are perpendicular to the\nmain axes are naturally approximated by a layer of voxels. However, planar\nsurfaces in any other directions and curved surfaces yield a jagged/rough\nsurface approximation by voxels. For the standard Cahn-Hilliard formulation,\nwhere the contact angle between the diffuse interface and the domain boundary\n(fluid-solid interface/wall) is 90 degrees, jagged surfaces have no impact on\nthe contact angle. However, a prescribed contact angle smaller or larger than\n90 degrees on jagged voxel surfaces is amplified in either direction. As a\nremedy, we propose the introduction of surface energy correction factors for\neach fluid-solid voxel face that counterbalance the difference of the voxel-set\nsurface area with the underlying smooth one. The discretization of the model\nequations is performed with the discontinuous Galerkin method, however, the\npresented semi-analytical approach of correcting the surface energy is equally\napplicable to other direct numerical methods such as finite elements, finite\nvolumes, or finite differences, since the correction factors appear in the\nstrong formulation of the model.\n", "  Electron transport through nanodevices of atoms in a single-layer rectangular\narrangement with free (open) boundary conditions parallel to the direction of\nthe current flow is studied within the single-band tight binding model. The\nLandauer formula gives the electrical conductance to be a function of the\nelectron transmission probability, ${\\cal T}(E)$, as a function of the energy\n$E$ of the incoming electron. A quantum dragon nanodevice is one which has a\nperfectly conducting channel, namely ${\\cal T}(E)=1$ for all energies which are\ntransmitted by the external leads even though there may be arbitrarily strong\nelectron scattering. The rectangular single-layer systems are shown to be able\nto be quantum dragon devices, both for uniform leads and for dimerized leads.\nThe quantum dragon condition requires appropriate lead-device connections and\ncorrelated randomness in the device.\n", "  We discuss the first three well known moment charge-charge sum-rules for a\ngeneral ionic liquid. For the special symmetric case of the Restricted\nPrimitive Model, Das et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 215701 (2011)] has recently\ndiscovered, through Monte Carlo simulations, that the Stillinger-Lovett or\nsecond-moment sum-rule fails at criticality. We critically discuss a possible\nexplanation for this unexpected behavior. On the other hand the fourth-moment\nsum-rule turns out to be able to account for the results of the simulations at\ncriticality.\n", "  A central goal of the Learning Assistant (LA) model is to improve students'\nlearning of science through the transformation of instructor practices. There\nis minimal existing research on the impact of college physics instructor\nexperiences on their effectiveness. To investigate the association between\ncollege introductory physics instructors' experiences with and without LAs and\nstudent learning, we drew on data from the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes\n(LASSO) database. The LASSO database provided us with student-level data\n(concept inventory scores and demographic data) for 4,365 students and\ncourse-level data (instructor experience and course features) for the students'\n93 mechanics courses. We performed Hierarchical Multiple Imputation to impute\nmissing data and Hierarchical Linear Modeling to nest students within courses\nwhen modeling the associations between instructor experience and student\nlearning. Our models predict that instructors' effectiveness decreases as they\ngain experience teaching without LAs. However, LA supported environments appear\nto remediate this decline in effectiveness as instructor effectiveness is\nmaintained while they gain experience teaching with LAs.\n", "  We show that the stacks of two-dimensional semiconductor crystals with the\nchiral packing exhibit optical activity and circular dichroism. We develop a\nmicroscopic theory of these phenomena in the spectral range of exciton\ntransitions which takes into account the spin-dependent hopping of excitons\nbetween the layers in the stack and the interlayer coupling of excitons via\nelectromagnetic field. For the stacks of realistic two-dimensional\nsemiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides, we calculate the\nrotation and ellipticity angles of radiation transmitted through such\nstructures. The angles are resonantly enhanced at the frequencies of both\nbright and dark exciton modes in the stack. We also study the photoluminescence\nof chiral stacks and show that it is circularly polarized.\n", "  This study investigates differences in student participation rates between\nin-class and online administrations of research-based assessments. A sample of\n1,310 students from 25 sections of 3 different introductory physics courses\nover two semesters were instructed to complete the CLASS attitudinal survey and\nthe concept inventory relevant to their course, either the FCI or the CSEM.\nEach student was randomly assigned to take one of the surveys in class and the\nother survey online at home using the Learning About STEM Student Outcomes\n(LASSO) platform. Results indicate large variations in participation rates\nacross both test conditions (online and in class). A hierarchical generalized\nlinear model (HGLM) of the student data utilizing logistic regression indicates\nthat student grades in the course and faculty assessment administration\npractices were both significant predictors of student participation. When the\nrecommended online assessments administration practices were implemented,\nparticipation rates were similar across test conditions. Implications for\nstudent and course assessment methodologies will be discussed.\n", "  Evidence for quantized magnetic vortex entry at a defect into a Type-II\nsuperconductor operating in the metastable state above Bc1 while under the\ninfluence of RF electromagnetic fields has been observed in a polycrystalline\ncoating of Nb3Sn. The measurement was made using a 1.3 GHz microwave cavity for\nuse in particle accelerator R&D and equipped with a temperature mapping system\nfor precision measurements of local heating. At peak RF fields near the quench\nfield of the cavity, discrete jumps in local heating at the quench origin were\nobserved. A number of these jumps were found to be identical in height within\nmeasurement error. This suggests entry of a limited number of vortices at a\ndefect. The behavior observed appears to be consistent with recent theoretical\npredictions regarding vortex entry at grain boundaries in the material.\n", "  It is necessary and important to operate buses and trams on time. The bus\nschedule is closely related to the dynamic motion of buses. In this part, we\nintroduce the nonlinear maps for describing the dynamics of shuttle buses in\nthe transportation system. The complex motion of the buses is explained by the\nnonlinear-map models. The transportation system of shuttle buses without\npassing is similar to that of the trams. The transport of elevators is also\nsimilar to that of shuttle buses with freely passing. The complex dynamics of a\nsingle bus is described in terms of the piecewise map, the delayed map, the\nextended circle map and the combined map. The dynamics of a few buses is\ndescribed by the model of freely passing buses, the model of no passing buses,\nand the model of increase or decrease of buses. The nonlinear-map models are\nuseful to make an accurate estimate of the arrival time in the bus\ntransportation.\n", "  The Limb-imaging Ionospheric and Thermospheric Extreme-ultraviolet\nSpectrograph (LITES) experiment is one of thirteen instruments aboard the Space\nTest Program Houston 5 (STP-H5) payload on the International Space Station.\nAlong with the complementary GPS Radio Occultation and Ultraviolet Photometry\n-- Colocated (GROUP-C) experiment, LITES will investigate ionospheric\nstructures and variability relevant to the global ionosphere. The ISS has an\norbital inclination of 51.6{\\deg} which combined with its altitude of about 410\nkm enables middle- and low-latitude measurements from slightly above the peak\nregion of the ionosphere. The LITES instrument features a 10{\\deg} by 10{\\deg}\nfield of view which is collapsed horizontally, combining all information from a\ngiven altitude. The instrument is installed such it looks in the wake of the\nISS and about 14.5{\\deg} downwards in order to image altitudes ranging from\nabout 350 km to 150 km. The actual viewing altitude and geometry is directly\ndependent on the pitch of the ISS, affecting the geophysical information\ncaptured by the instrument.\n", "  Current theoretical description of field-induced electron emission remains\nmostly bounded by the classic Fowler-Nordheim (FN) framework developed nearly\none century ago. For the emerging class of two-dimensional (2D) materials, many\nbasic assumptions of FN model become invalid due to their reduced\ndimensionality and exotic electronic properties. In this work, we develop\nanalytical and semi-analytical models of field-induced vertical electron\nemission from the surface of 2D materials by explicitly taking into account the\nreduced dimensionality, non-parabolic energy spectrum, non-conserving in-plane\nelectron momentum, finite-temperature and space-charge-limited effects. We show\nthat the traditional FN law is no longer valid for 2D materials. The modified\nvertical field emission model developed here provides better agreement with\nexperimental results. Intriguingly, a new high-field regime of \\emph{saturated\nsurface field emission} emerges due to the reduced dimensionality of 2D\nmaterials. A remarkable consequence of this saturated field emission effect is\nthe absence of space-charge-limited current normally expected at high field in\nthree-dimensional bulk material.\n", "  We theoretically investigate coupling interaction between molecule excitons\nand whispering gallery modes (WGMs) that approaches the limit of single exciton\nstrong coupling in hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) cavity, composed of a\ndielectric core wrapped by several stacks of alternative layers of metal and\ndielectric. We demonstrate that associated with the excitation of the\nwhispering gallery mode, the electric fields with resonance wavelengths that\nare much larger than the cavity size can be highly localized within a\ndielectric layer, leading to extremely small mode volumes. By using temporal\ncoupled mode theory to model the interaction in the proposed WGMs-exciton\nsystem, we are able to demonstrate that the coupling between molecular excitons\nand hyperbolic cavity WGMs can reach the strong coupling regime. Furthermore,\nwe also prove that changing both the thickness of inner core and outermost\nlayer can lead to invariant resonance frequency while the threshold number of\ncoupled excitons to fulfill the criteria for strong coupling remains ~ 4 in\nvarious sets of tunable HMM cavities.\n", "  We study the electron transport through the graphene PNP junction under a\nmagnetic field and show that modes mixing plays an essential role. By using the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method, the space distribution of the\nscattering state for a specific incident modes as well the elements of the\ntransmission and reflection coefficient matrixes are investigated. All elements\nof the transmission (reflection) coefficient matrixes are very different for a\nperfect PNP junction, but they are same at a disordered junction due to the\nmode mixing. The space distribution of the scattering state for the different\nincident modes also exhibit the similar behaviors, that they distinctly differ\nfrom each other in the perfect junction but are almost same in the disordered\njunction. For a unipolar junction, when the mode number in the center region is\nless than that in the left and right regions, the fluctuations of the total\ntransmission and reflection coefficients are zero, although each element has a\nlarge fluctuation. These results clearly indicate the occurrence of perfect\nmode mixing and it plays an essential role in a graphene PNP junction\ntransport.\n", "  Boron carbide: A traditional ceramic material shows unique properties when\nexplored in nano-range. Specially designed boron based nanocomposite has been\nsynthesized by reflux method. The addition of SnO2 in base matrix increase the\ndefect states in boron carbide and shows unique catalytic properties. The\ncalculated texture coefficient and Nelson Riley factor shows that the\nsynthesized nanocomposite have very high defect states. Also this composite is\nexplored for the first time for catalysis degradation of industrial used dyes.\nThe industrial pollutants such as Novacron red and methylene blue dye\ndegradation analysis reveal that the composite is an efficient catalyst.\nDegradation study shows that 1 g/L catalyst concentration of B4C/SnO2 degrade\nNovacron red Huntsman dye upto 97.38% approximately in 20 minutes under\nsunlight irradiation time. This water insoluble catalyst can be recovered and\nreused.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a set of definitions upon which one can prove in a\nrigorous way most of the main results achieved in the pattern of zeros\nclassification of fractional quantum Hall states.\n", "  CdTe is a well known and widely used binary compound for optoelectronic\napplications. In this study, we propose the thinnest, free standing monolayer\nof CdTe which holds the tetragonal-PbO (alpha-PbO) symmetry. The structural,\nelectronic, vibrational and strain dependent properties are investigated by\nmeans of first principles calculations based on density functional theory. Our\nresults demonstrate that the monolayer alpha-CdTe is a dynamically stable and\nmechanically flexible material. It is found that the thinnest monolayer crystal\nof CdTe is a semiconductor with a direct band gap of 1.95 eV, which corresponds\nto red light in the visible spectrum. Moreover, it is found that the band gap\ncan be tunable under biaxial strain. With its strain-controllable direct band\ngap within the visible spectrum, stable alpha-phase of monolayer CdTe is a\nsuitable candidate for optoelectronic device applications.\n", "  A CdTe double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD) is an ideal device for imaging\nand spectroscopic measure- ments in the hard X-ray range above 10 keV. Recent\ndevelopment enables us to realize an imager with a detection area of ~10\ncm${^2}$. An energy resolution of 1-2 keV (FWHM) and a position resolution of a\nfew hundred {\\mu}m are available from the detector. This type of imager has\nbeen long awaited for non-destructive elemental analysis, especially by using\nnegative muons, because energies of characteristic X-rays from muonic atoms are\nabout 200 time higher than those from normal atoms. With the method that uses\nnegative muons, hard X-ray information gives the spatial distribution of\nelements in samples at a certain depth defined by the initial momentum of the\nmuon beam. In order to study three-dimensional imaging capability of the\nmethod, we have developed a compact imaging system based on CdTe-DSD and a\n{\\phi}3 mm pinhole collimator as the first prototype. We conducted experiments\nwith samples which consist of layers of Al, BN and LiF irradiated by negative\nmuon beams in MUSE/J-PARC and successfully reconstruct hard X-ray images of\nmuonic X-rays from B, N and F at various depths.\n", "  Magnetosphere at ion kinetic scales, or mini-magnetosphere, possesses unusual\nfeatures as predicted by numerical simulations. However, there are practically\nno data on the subject from space observations and the data which are available\nare far too incomplete. In the present work we describe results of laboratory\nexperiment on interaction of plasma flow with magnetic dipole with parameters\nsuch that ion inertia length is smaller than a size of observed magnetosphere.\nA detailed structure of non-coplanar or out-of-plane component of magnetic\nfield has been obtained in meridian plane. Independence of this component on\ndipole moment reversal, as was reported in previous work, has been verified. In\nthe tail distinct lobes and central current sheet have been observed. It was\nfound that lobe regions adjacent to boundary layer are dominated by\nnon-coplanar component of magnetic field. Tail-ward oriented electric current\nin plasma associated with that component appears to be equal to ion current in\nthe frontal part of magnetosphere and in the tail current sheet implying that\nelectrons are stationary in those regions while ions flow by. Obtained data\nstrongly support the proposed model of mini-magnetosphere based on two-fluid\neffects as described by the Hall term.\n", "  The exclusive $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral proton-nucleus\nand nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energies is being investigated using pQCD\nframework which constrain the gluon distribution in the proton and nuclei at\nlow $x$. Rapidity distributions of $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction with different\ngluon distribution parameterization and gluon shadowing for nuclear PDFs\nincluding photon flux suppression for strong interaction, are being presented\nat LHC energies. Predictions done for ultraperipheral collisions at $\\sqrt\ns$=$8.16$ TeV in pPb, and at $\\sqrt s$=$5.02$ TeV in PbPb collisions which are\nLHC Run 2 Heavy Ion collision scenario and measurements of cross-section will\nbe available soon.\n", "  We study the validity of Hund's first rule for the spin multiplicity in\ncircular molecules - made of real or artificial atoms such as quantum dots - by\nconsidering a perturbative approach in the Coulomb interaction in the extended\nHubbard model with both on-site and long-range interactions. In this\napproximation, we show that an anti-Hund rule {\\it always} defines the ground\nstate in a molecule with $4N$ atoms at half-filling. In all other cases (i.e.\nnumber of atoms {\\it not} multiple of four, or a $4N$ molecule away from\nhalf-filling) both the singlet and the triplet outcomes are possible, as\ndetermined {primarily} by the total number of electrons in the system. In some\ninstances, the Hund rule is always obeyed and the triplet ground state is\nrealized {\\it mathematically} for any values of the on-site and long range\ninteractions, while for other filling situations the singlet is also possible\nbut only if the long-range interactions exceed a certain threshold, relatively\nto the on-site interaction.\n", "  The asymptotic behavior of the solution of an infinite set of Smoluchowski's\ndiscrete coagulation-fragmentation-diffusion equations with non-homogeneous\nNeumann boundary conditions, defined in a periodically perforated domain, is\nanalyzed. Our homogenization result, based on Nguetseng-Allaire two-scale\nconvergence, is meant to pass from a microscopic model (where the physical\nprocesses are properly described) to a macroscopic one (which takes into\naccount only the effective or averaged properties of the system). When the\ncharacteristic size of the perforations vanishes, the information given on the\nmicroscale by the non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is transferred\ninto a global source term appearing in the limiting (homogenized) equations.\nFurthermore, on the macroscale, the geometric structure of the perforated\ndomain induces a correction in the diffusion coefficients.\n", "  We discuss the physical nature of quasi-PDFs, especially the reasons for the\nstrong nonperturbative evolution pattern which they reveal in actual lattice\ngauge calculations. We argue that quasi-PDFs may be treated as hybrids of PDFs\nand the rest-frame momentum distributions of partons. The latter is also\nresponsible for the transverse momentum dependence of TMDs. The resulting\nconvolution structure of quasi-PDFs necessitates using large probing momenta\n$p_3 \\gtrsim 3$ GeV to get reasonably close to the PDF limit. To deconvolute\nthe rest-frame distribution effects, we propose to use a method based directly\non the coordinate representation. We treat matrix elements $M(z_3,p_3)$ as\ndistributions ${\\cal M} (\\nu, z_3^2)$ depending on the Ioffe-time $\\nu = p_3\nz_3$ and the distance parameter $z_3^2$. The rest-frame spatial distribution is\ngiven by ${\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$. Using the reduced Ioffe function ${\\mathfrak M}\n(\\nu, z_3^2) \\equiv {\\cal M} (\\nu, z_3^2)/ {\\cal M} (0, z_3^2)$ we divide out\nthe rest frame effects,including the notorious link renormalization factors.\nThe $\\nu$-dependence remains intact and determines the shape of PDFs in the\nsmall $z_3$ region. The residual $z_3^2$ dependence of the ${\\mathfrak M} (\\nu,\nz_3^2)$ is governed by perturbative evolution. The Fourier transform of ${\\cal\nM} (\\nu, z_3^2)$ produces pseudo-PDFs ${\\cal P}(x, z_3^2)$ that generalize the\nlight-front PDFs onto spacelike intervals. On the basis of these findings we\npropose a new method for extraction of PDFs from lattice calculations.\n", "  A novel chipless RFID humidity sensor based on a finite Artificial Impedance\nSurface (AIS) is presented. The unit cell of the AIS is composed of three\nconcentric loops thus obtaining three deep and high Q nulls in the\nelectromagnetic response of the tag. The wireless sensor is fabricated using\nlow-cost inkjet printing technology on a thin sheet of commercial coated paper.\nThe patterned surface is placed on a metal backed cardboard layer. The relative\nhumidity information is encoded in the frequency shift of the resonance peaks.\nVarying the relative humidity level from 50% to 90%, the frequency shift has\nproven to be up to 270MHz. The position of the resonance peaks has been\ncorrelated to the relative humidity level of the environment on the basis of a\nhigh number of measurements performed in a climatic chamber, specifically\ndesigned for RF measurements of the sensor. A very low error probability of the\nproposed sensor is demonstrated when the device is used with a 10% RH humidity\nlevel discrimination.\n", "  Early-type stars generally tend to be fast rotators. In these stars, mode\nidentification is very challenging as the effects of rotation are not well\nknown. We consider here the example of $\\alpha$ Ophiuchi, for which dozens of\noscillation frequencies have been measured. We model the star using the\ntwo-dimensional structure code ESTER, and we compute both adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic oscillations using the TOP code. Both calculations yield very\ncomplex spectra, and we used various diagnostic tools to try and identify the\nobserved pulsations. While we have not reached a satisfactory mode-to-mode\nidentification, this paper presents promising early results.\n", "  By including elements of the density matrix formalism, the semiclassical\nensemble Monte Carlo method for carrier transport is extended to incorporate\nincoherent tunneling, known to play an important role in quantum cascade lasers\n(QCLs). In particular, this effect dominates electron transport across thick\ninjection barriers, which are frequently used in terahertz QCL designs. A\nself-consistent model for quantum mechanical dephasing is implemented,\neliminating the need for empirical simulation parameters. Our modeling approach\nis validated against available experimental data for different types of\nterahertz QCL designs.\n", "  Inspired by the works of Ablowitz, Mussliman and Fokas, a partial reverse\nspace-time nonlocal Mel'nikov equation is introduced. This equation provides\ntwo dimensional analogues of the nonlocal Schrodinger-Boussinesq equation. By\nemploying the Hirota's bilinear method, soliton, breathers and mixed solutions\nconsisting of breathers and periodic line waves are obtained. Further, taking a\nlong wave limit of these obtained soliton solutions, rational and semi-rational\nsolutions of the nonlocal Mel'nikov equation are derived. The rational\nsolutions are lumps. The semi-rational solutions are mixed solutions consisting\nof lumps, breathers and periodic line waves. Under proper parameter\nconstraints, fundamental rogue waves and a semi-rational solutions of the\nnonlocal Schrodinger-Boussinesq equation are generated from solutions of the\nnonlocal Mel'nikov equation.\n", "  The ribosome is a macromolecular complex which is responsible for protein\nsynthesis in all living cells according to their transcribed genetic\ninformation. Using X-ray crystallography and, more recently, cryo-electron\nmicroscopy (cryo-EM), the structure of the ribosome was resolved at atomic\nresolution in many functional and conformational states. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations have added information on dynamics and energetics to the available\nstructural information, thereby have bridged the gap to the kinetics obtained\nfrom single-molecule and bulk experiments. Here, we review recent computational\nstudies that brought notable insights into ribosomal structure and function.\n", "  We study the Mourre theory for the Floquet Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = -i\n\\partial_t + H(t)$ generated by the time-periodic Hamiltonian $H(t)$ with\n$H(t+T) =H(t)$, which describes the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations with general\ntime-periodic magnetic fields.\n", "  We report on time-resolved photometry of the 2015 February-March\nsuperoutburst of QZ Virginis. The superoutburst consisted of a separated\nprecursor, main superoutburst, and rebrightening. We detected superhumps with a\nperiod of 0.061181(42) d between the precursor and main superoutburst. Based on\nanalyses of period changes and amplitudes of superhumps, the observed\nsuperhumps were identified as growing superhumps (stage A superhumps). The\nduration of stage A superhumps was about 5 d, unusually long for SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae. Using the obtained stage A superhump period, we estimated the mass\nratio of QZ Vir to be 0.108(3). This value suggests that QZ Vir is an SU\nUMa-type dwarf nova evolving toward the period minimum. Based on the present\nand the previous observations regarding long-lasting stage A superhumps, a time\nscale of stage A superhumps is likely to be determined by the mass ratio of the\nsystem and the temperature of the accretion disk.\n", "  Defects such as dislocations impact materials properties and their response\nduring external stimuli. Defect engineering has emerged as a possible route to\nimproving the performance of materials over a wide range of applications,\nincluding batteries, solar cells, and semiconductors. Imaging these defects in\ntheir native operating conditions to establish the structure-function\nrelationship and, ultimately, to improve performance has remained a\nconsiderable challenge for both electron-based and x-ray-based imaging\ntechniques. However, the advent of Bragg coherent x-ray diffractive imaging\n(BCDI) has made possible the 3D imaging of multiple dislocations in\nnanoparticles ranging in size from 100 nm to1000 nm. While the imaging process\nsucceeds in many cases, nuances in identifying the dislocations has left manual\nidentification as the preferred method. Derivative-based methods are also used,\nbut they can be inaccurate and are computationally inefficient. Here we\ndemonstrate a derivative-free method that is both more accurate and more\ncomputationally efficient than either derivative- or human-based methods for\nidentifying 3D dislocation lines in nanocrystal images produced by BCDI. We\nformulate the problem as a min-max optimization problem and show exceptional\naccuracy for experimental images. We demonstrate a 260x speedup for a typical\nexperimental dataset with higher accuracy over current methods. We discuss the\npossibility of using this algorithm as part of a sparsity-based phase retrieval\nprocess. We also provide the MATLAB code for use by other researchers.\n", "  An effect of a magnetic field of an arbitrary strength on the beta-decay and\nreactions related with it by the crossing symmetry (the beta-processes) in\nsupernovae and accretion disks around black holes is analyzed. Rates of the\nbeta-processes and the energy and momentum transfered through them to an\noptically transparent matter are calculated. It is shown that the macroscopic\nmomentum transferred to the medium increases linearly with the magnetic field\nstrength and can substantially affect the dynamics of supernovae and accretion\ndisks especially when a matter inside is degenerate. It is also demonstrated\nthat the rates of the beta-processes and the energy deposition in these\nreactions for the magnetic field strength $B \\lesssim 10^{15}$ G, which is\nassumed to be typical in supernovae and accretion disks, are lower than in the\nabsence of the field. This suppression is more pronounced for reactions with\nneutrinos.\n", "  I provide updates for the theoretical predictions of the muon and electron\nanomalous magnetic moments, for the shift in the fine structure constant\n$\\alpha(M_Z)$ and for the weak mixing parameter $\\sin^2 \\Theta_W(M_Z)$.\nPhenomenological results for Euclidean time correlators, the key objects in the\nlattice QCD approach to hadronic vacuum polarization, are briefly considered.\nFurthermore, I present a list of isospin breaking and electromagnetic\ncorrections for the lepton moments, which may be used to supplement lattice QCD\nresults obtained in the isospin limit and without the e.m. corrections.\n", "  Making use of the emergence of an entangling gate from the Mayer Vietoris\nmaps generating a torus and employing the correspondence between quantum error\ncorrection codes and gauge symmetries I show that non-abelian gauge theories\nare related to the existence of entanglement. This observation is based on the\nfact that string compactification on a torus provide non-trivial fluxes\n(gaugings) when the twists are chosen such that the obtained torus matches the\nmaps arising in the Mayer-Vietoris theorem which result in entangling gates.\nThis observation adds new indications towards the fact that low energy\nnon-abelian gauge theories emerge from entanglement related phenomena.\n", "  We analyze properties of unstable systems at rest and in motion.\n", "  Fractures are ubiquitous in the subsurface. The flow and mechanical\nproperties of these fractures are controlled by its compliance or stiffness.\nCharacterizing fracture compliance is crucial in applications such as fault\nzone studies, underground CO2 sequestration, nuclear waste repositories and\ngeothermal energy exploitation. In this study, we present a method to determine\nfracture compliance by modeling fracture closure on asperities using integral\ntransform.\n", "  A theory of nonlinear signal propagation in multi-span wavelength division\nmultiplexed coherent transmission systems that employ the semiconductor optical\namplifier as in-line amplifiers is presented for the first time. The rigorous\nderivation, based on time-domain first-order perturbation theory, is developed\nin detail. The end result is the expressions for the signal-to-noise ratio of\nthe received sampled photocurrent, including contributions from noise,\nfiber-induced nonlinear distortions, and amplified-induced nonlinear\ndistortions.\n", "  We present a technique to automatically minimise the re-computation when a\ndata processing program is iteratively changed, or added to, as is often the\ncase in exploratory data analysis in radio astronomy. A typical example is\nflagging and calibration of demanding or unusual observations where visual\ninspection suggests improvement to the processing strategy. The technique is\nbased on memoization and referentially transparent tasks. We describe a\nprototype implementation for the CASA data reduction package. This technique\nimproves the efficiency of data analysis while reducing the possibility for\nuser error and improving the reproducibility of the final result.\n", "  Vibrations are among main causes of fatigue and damages leading to\ndestruction of rotating blades. Consequently, motions of blades have to be\ncarefully studied, and in particular, periodic components. Blade Tip-Timing\n(BTT) methods achieve non-intrusive measurements which is a great advantage\nwith respect to classical methods. They can be modelled by a Periodic\nNonuniform Sampling of order L equal to the number of probes (PNSL). In this\npaper, we develop the case L=2, and we prove that this model is sufficient for\nfinding the places of asynchronous frequency lines, with their amplitudes and\ntheir phases. To increase L will increase the redundance and then the accuracy\nof the method.\n", "  Sampling uniform simple graphs with power-law degree distributions with\ndegree exponent $\\tau\\in(2,3)$ is a non-trivial problem. We propose a method to\nsample uniform simple graphs that uses a constrained version of the\nconfiguration model together with a Markov Chain switching method. We test the\nconvergence of this algorithm numerically in the context of the presence of\nsmall subgraphs. We then compare the number of triangles in uniform random\ngraphs with the number of triangles in the erased configuration model. Using\nsimulations and heuristic arguments, we conjecture that the number of triangles\nin the erased configuration model is larger than the number of triangles in the\nuniform random graph, provided that the graph is sufficiently large.\n", "  Plasma turbulence simulations are often computationally expensive with\ndelicate numerical stability. Yet, long simulations are needed to generate\nuncorrelated turbulence data for studies such as microwave scattering through\ndensity perturbations. For this reason, alternative methods of producing\naccurate synthetic turbulence profiles via statistical methods is of interest.\nSuch a method is proposed where the two-point covariance function of the\ndesired turbulence is used to construct a multi-variate normal distribution.\nSampling from this distribution produces random fields which are both\nqualitatively and quantitatively similar to the input turbulence data set. The\nresulting `synthetic' turbulent profiles are uncorrelated in `time' so it is\nuseful only for scenarios that do not require such physical evolution.\n", "  For spherically symmetric repulsive Hamiltonians we prove the Besov bound,\nthe radiation condition bounds and the limiting absorption principle. The\nSommerfeld uniqueness result also follows as a corollary of these. In\nparticular, the Hamiltonians considered in this paper cover the case of\ninverted harmonic oscillator. In the proofs of our theorems, we mainly use a\ncommutator argument invented recently by Ito and Skibsted. This argument is\nsimple and elementary, and dose not employ energy cut-offs or the microlocal\nanalysis.\n", "  We consider three `four-parameters' dark energy equations of state allowing\nfast transition from the matter dominated decelerating phase to the current\naccelerating phase. The fast-varying nature of the dark energy models is\nquantified by the transition width $\\tau > 0$, a free parameter associated with\nthe models where lower values of $\\tau$ imply faster transition. We impose the\nlatest observational constraints on these fast-varying dark energy equations of\nstate, using the latest released cosmic chronometers data along with a series\nof standard dark energy probes, namely, the local Hubble constant value at 2.4%\nprecision measured by the Hubble Space Telescope, the Joint Light Curve\nAnalysis from Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon acoustic oscillations distance\nmeasurements and finally the cosmic microwave background radiation distance\npriors. Our analyses show that the precise measurements of the free parameters,\nwhen a large number of parameters are allowed in a cosmological model become\nvery hard. Moreover, the analyses do not enable us to make any decisive comment\non the fast-varying nature of the models, at least from the astronomical data\navailable at current moment. Finally, we close the work with a discussion based\non the information criteria, which do not return favorable results to the\nfast-varying models, at least according to the data employed.\n", "  A dynamic agent model is introduced with an annual random wealth\nmultiplicative process followed by taxes paid according to a linear\nwealth-dependent tax rate. If poor agents pay higher tax rates than rich\nagents, eventually all wealth becomes concentrated in the hands of a single\nagent. By contrast, if poor agents are subject to lower tax rates, the economic\ncollective process continues forever.\n", "  The microhexcavity plasma panel detector is a type of gaseous particle\ndetector consisting of a close-packed array of millimeter-size hexagonal cells.\nThe cells are biased to operate in Geiger mode where each cell functions as an\nindependent detection unit. The response of the detector to ionizing radiation\nwas investigated using low-energy radioactive $ \\beta $ sources and cosmic ray\nmuons. Efficiency measurements were conducted with cosmic ray muons in\nconjunction with a scintillator hodoscope. The rate response and signals\nobtained from the microhexcavity detector filled with Penning gas mixture at\natmospheric pressure are herein described. The relative pixel efficiency, after\nallowing for ion-pair formation in the gas volume, is 96.8 $ \\pm $ 4.4$ \\% $\nfor operation of the detector above an applied high voltage of 1000 V.\n", "  The combination of high-contrast imaging and high-dispersion spectroscopy,\nwhich has successfully been used to detect the atmosphere of a giant planet, is\none of the most promising potential probes of the atmosphere of Earth-size\nworlds. The forthcoming generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs) may\nobtain sufficient contrast with this technique to detect O$_2$ in the\natmosphere of those worlds that orbit low-mass M dwarfs. This is strong\nmotivation to carry out a census of planets around cool stars for which\nhabitable zones can be resolved by ELTs, i.e. for M dwarfs within $\\sim$5\nparsecs. Our HARPS survey has been a major contributor to that sample of nearby\nplanets. Here we report on our radial velocity observations of Ross 128\n(Proxima Virginis, GJ447, HIP 57548), an M4 dwarf just 3.4 parsec away from our\nSun. This source hosts an exo-Earth with a projected mass $m \\sin i = 1.35\nM_\\oplus$ and an orbital period of 9.9 days. Ross 128 b receives $\\sim$1.38\ntimes as much flux as Earth from the Sun and its equilibrium ranges in\ntemperature between 269 K for an Earth-like albedo and 213 K for a Venus-like\nalbedo. Recent studies place it close to the inner edge of the conventional\nhabitable zone. An 80-day long light curve from K2 campaign C01 demonstrates\nthat Ross~128~b does not transit. Together with the All Sky Automated Survey\n(ASAS) photometry and spectroscopic activity indices, the K2 photometry shows\nthat Ross 128 rotates slowly and has weak magnetic activity. In a habitability\ncontext, this makes survival of its atmosphere against erosion more likely.\nRoss 128 b is the second closest known exo-Earth, after Proxima Centauri b (1.3\nparsec), and the closest temperate planet known around a quiet star. The 15 mas\nplanet-star angular separation at maximum elongation will be resolved by ELTs\n($>$ 3$\\lambda/D$) in the optical bands of O$_2$.\n", "  Finite element analysis of stress about a blunt crack tip, emphasizing finite\nstrain and phenomenological and mechanism-based strain gradient plasticity\n(SGP) formulations, is integrated with electrochemical assessment of\noccluded-crack tip hydrogen (H) solubility and two H-decohesion models to\npredict hydrogen environment assisted crack growth properties. SGP elevates\ncrack tip geometrically necessary dislocation density and flow stress, with\nenhancement declining with increasing alloy strength. Elevated hydrostatic\nstress promotes high-trapped H concentration for crack tip damage; it is\nimperative to account for SGP in H cracking models. Predictions of the\nthreshold stress intensity factor and H-diffusion limited Stage II crack growth\nrate agree with experimental data for a high strength austenitic Ni-Cu\nsuperalloy (Monel K-500) and two modern ultra-high strength martensitic steels\n(AerMet 100 and Ferrium M54) stressed in 0.6 M NaCl solution over a range of\napplied potential. For Monel K-500, KTH is accurately predicted versus cathodic\npotential using either classical or gradient-modified formulations; however,\nStage II growth rate is best predicted by a SGP description of crack tip stress\nthat justifies a critical distance of 1 {\\mu}m. For steel, threshold and growth\nrate are best predicted using high-hydrostatic stress that exceeds 6 to 8 times\nalloy yield strength and extends 1 {\\mu}m ahead of the crack tip. This stress\nis nearly achieved with a three-length phenomenological SGP formulation, but\nadditional stress enhancement is needed, perhaps due to tip geometry or\nslip-microstructure.\n", "  Within the framework of the Einstein's standard equations of the general\ntheory of relativity, flat galactic rotational curves of galaxies cannot be\nexplained without hypothesis attracting the dark matter, the particles of which\nhad not yet been identified. The vacuum central-symmetric solution of the\nequations of conformal gravitation is well known as metrics of\nMannheim-Kazanas, on the basis of which these curves receive purely geometrical\nexplanation. We show in our work that the metrics of Mannheim-Kazanas is the\nsolution of not only Bach equations received from conformal-invariant Weyl\nLagrangian, but also the solution of equations of the conformal\ngeometrodynamics at a nonzero vector of Weyl. In this connection the hypothesis\nis formulated that the space on galactic scales can be described not only by\nRiemannian geometry, but with geometry of Weyl.\n", "  Scale-free networks are frequently described as the zenith of inequality and\nsometimes even pin-pointed as a natural cause of concentrations, including\naccumulation of resources in human society. Although coherent with theory and\nempirical data, there are at least three aspects of scale-free networks that\nare egalitarian. Using the social network metaphor (which is easier to grasp):\n1) the presence of each agent (vertex or component) in diverse networks, while\neach agent has the same amount of resources (e.g. time) for engaging\n(establishing links or edges) with other individual agents, ideas or objects;\n2) the constant change in the concentration of resources (in this case, links)\nof each agent; 3) the uniform distribution of resources with respect to the\namount of resources per agent (the more resources per agent, the fewer the\nagents). We also consider the importance of vertices that are not hubs and\noverstatements on the importance of the hubs. The conclusions suggest the urge\nof research to better examine and model the relevance of the vertices that are\nnot hubs (i.e. peripheral and intermediary) and verify the need to better\nweight the emphasis current literature places in the association of inequality\nto the scale-free networks (and other phenomena in which power laws are found).\n", "  The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic ray positrons detected at Earth may\noriginate from nearby astrophysical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes\nof cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the\nHighAltitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera-electron volt\ngamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged\npulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that\nthese pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured\ntera-electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away\nfrom these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate\nthat the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the\norigin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.\n", "  We address the question of deviations from $3\\times 3$ unitarity of the\nleptonic mixing matrix showing that, contrary to conventional wisdom, one may\nhave significant deviations from unitarity in the framework of type I seesaw\nmechanism. In order for this scenario to be feasible, at least one of the heavy\nneutrinos must have a mass at the TeV scale, while the other two may have much\nlarger masses. We present specific examples where deviations from $3\\times 3$\nunitarity are sufficiently small to conform to all the present stringent\nexperimental bounds but are sufficiently large to have the potential for being\ndetectable at the next round of experiments.\n", "  Flexible superparamagnetic filaments are studied under the influence of fast\nprecessing magnetic fields using simulations and a continuum approximation\nanalysis. We find that individual filaments can be made to exert controllable\ntensile forces along the precession axis. These forces are exploited for\nmicroscopic actuation. In bulk, the filaments can be rapidly assembled into\ndifferent configurations whose material properties depend on the field\nparameters. The precession frequency affects filament aggregation and\nconformation by changing the net torques on the filament ends. Using a\ntime-dependent precession angle allows considerable freedom in choosing\nproperties for filament aggregates. As an example, we design a field that\ntwists chains together to dynamically assemble a self-healing gel.\n", "  We examine analytically equilibrium conformations of elastic chains of\nparamagnetic beads in the presence of a precessing magnetic field.\nConformations of these filaments are determined by minimizing their total\nenergy, given in the harmonic approximation by the sum of the bending energy,\nquadratic in its curvature, and the magnetic dipolar interaction energy,\nquadratic in the projection of the vector tangent to the filament onto the\nprecession axis. In particular, we analyze two families of open filaments with\ntheir ends aligned along the precession axis and described by segments of\nplanar curves and helices. These configurations are characterized in terms of\ntwo parameters encoding their features such as their length, separation between\ntheir ends, as well as their bending and magnetic moduli, the latter being\nproportional to the magnitude and precession angle of the magnetic field. Based\non energetic arguments, we present the set of parameter values for which each\nof these families of curves is probable to occur.\n"]}
