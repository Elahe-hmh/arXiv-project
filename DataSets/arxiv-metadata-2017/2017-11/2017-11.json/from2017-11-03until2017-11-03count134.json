Through thermodynamic\nequilibrium calculations and by high-temperature mass spectrometry suitable\ngrowth conditions can be determined. The atmosphere plays an important role\nduring crystallization. It affects the composition shift, on the one hand, and\nthe valence state of cerium, on the other hand. These properties can be\nexplained by combining X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, and optical\nspectroscopy. Crystallization in slightly reducing nitrogen atmosphere proves\nto be a reasonable choice, because evaporation is suppressed and trivalent\ncerium is stabilized. Strong green emission that depends on the oxygen fugacity\nduring crystallization can be excited using UV light. Optical transmission of\nSrY2O4:Ce3+ is measured for the first time.\n", "  The recent analysis on noncommutative geometry, showing quantization of the\nvolume for the Riemannian manifold entering the geometry, can support a view of\nquantum mechanics as arising by a stochastic process on it. A class of\nstochastic processes can be devised, arising as fractional powers of an\nordinary Wiener process, that reproduce in a proper way a stochastic process on\na noncommutative geometry. These processes are characterized by producing\ncomplex values and so, the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation resembles the\nSchroedinger equation. Indeed, by a direct numerical check, one can recover the\nkernel of the Schroedinger equation starting by an ordinary Brownian motion.\nThis class of stochastic processes needs a Clifford algebra to exist. In four\ndimensions, the full set of Dirac matrices is needed and the corresponding\nstochastic process in a noncommutative geometry is easily recovered as is the\nDirac equation in the Klein-Gordon form being it the Fokker--Planck equation of\nthe process.\n", "  We revisit our recent study [Predicting results of the Research Excellence\nFramework using departmental h-index, Scientometrics, 2014, 1-16;\narXiv:1411.1996] in which we attempted to predict outcomes of the UK's Research\nExcellence Framework (REF~2014) using the so-called departmental $h$-index.\nHere we report that our predictions failed to anticipate with any accuracy\neither overall REF outcomes or movements of individual institutions in the\nrankings relative to their positions in the previous Research Assessment\nExercise (RAE~2008).\n", "  Quantum mechanics is among the most important and successful mathematical\nmodel for describing our physical reality. The traditional formulation of\nquantum mechanics is linear and algebraic. In contrast classical mechanics is a\ngeometrical and non-linear theory that is defined on a symplectic manifold.\nHowever, after invention of general relativity, we are convinced that geometry\nis physical and effect us in all scale. Hence the geometric formulation of\nquantum mechanics sought to give a unified picture of physical systems based on\nits underling geometrical structures, e.g., now, the states are represented by\npoints of a symplectic manifold with a compatible Riemannian metric, the\nobservables are real-valued functions on the manifold, and the quantum\nevolution is governed by a symplectic flow that is generated by a Hamiltonian\nfunction. In this work we will give a compact introduction to main ideas of\ngeometric formulation of quantum mechanics. We will provide the reader with the\ndetails of geometrical structures of both pure and mixed quantum states. We\nwill also discuss and review some important applications of geometric quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  We determine the concentration-mass relation of 19 X-ray selected galaxy\nclusters from the CLASH survey in theories of gravity that directly modify the\nlensing potential. We model the clusters as NFW haloes and fit their lensing\nsignal, in the Cubic Galileon and Nonlocal gravity models, to the lensing\nconvergence profiles of the clusters. We discuss a number of important issues\nthat need to be taken into account, associated with the use of nonparametric\nand parametric lensing methods, as well as assumptions about the background\ncosmology. Our results show that the concentration and mass estimates in the\nmodified gravity models are, within the errorbars, the same as in $\\Lambda$CDM.\nThis result demonstrates that, for the Nonlocal model, the modifications to\ngravity are too weak at the cluster redshifts, and for the Galileon model, the\nscreening mechanism is very efficient inside the cluster radius. However, at\ndistances $\\sim \\left[2-20\\right] {\\rm Mpc}/h$ from the cluster center, we find\nthat the surrounding force profiles are enhanced by $\\sim20-40\\%$ in the Cubic\nGalileon model. This has an impact on dynamical mass estimates, which means\nthat tests of gravity based on comparisons between lensing and dynamical masses\ncan also be applied to the Cubic Galileon model.\n", "  We propose a novel way to image dynamical properties of nonstationary\nelectron systems using ultrafast resonant x-ray scattering. Employing a\nrigorous theoretical analysis within the framework of quantum electrodynamics,\nwe demonstrate that a single scattering pattern from a nonstationary electron\nsystem encodes the instantaneous interatomic electron current in addition to\nthe structural information usually obtained by resonant x-ray scattering from\nstationary systems. Thus, inelastic contributions that are indistinguishable\nfrom elastic processes induced by a broadband probe pulse, instead of being a\nconcern, serve as an advantage for time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering.\nThereby, we propose an approach combining elastic and inelastic resonant x-ray\nscattering for imaging dynamics of nonstationary electron systems in both real\nspace and real time. In order to illustrate its power, we show how it can be\napplied to image the electron hole current in an ionized diatomic molecule.\n", "  We run hydrodynamical simulations of a 2D isothermal non self-gravitating\ninviscid gas flowing in a rigidly rotating externally imposed potential formed\nby only two components: a monopole and a quadrupole. We explore systematically\nthe effects of varying the quadrupole while keeping fixed the monopole and\ndiscuss the consequences for the interpretation of longitude-velocity diagrams\nin the Milky Way. We find that the gas flow can constrain the quadrupole of the\npotential and the characteristics of the bar that generates it. The exponential\nscale length of the bar must be at least $1.5\\rm\\, kpc$. The strength of the\nbar is also constrained. Our global interpretation favours a pattern speed of\n$\\Omega=40\\,\\rm km s^{-1} {kpc}^{-1}$. We find that for most observational\nfeatures, there exist a value of the parameters that matches each individual\nfeature well, but is difficult to reproduce all the important features at once.\nDue to the intractably high number of parameters involved in the general\nproblem, quantitative fitting methods that can run automatic searches in\nparameter space are necessary.\n", "  We present analytical expressions for the eigenstates and eigenvalues of\nelectrons confined in a graphene monolayer in the presence of a disclination.\nThe calculations are performed in the continuum limit approximation in the\nvicinity of the Dirac points, solving Dirac equation by freezing out the\ncarrier radial motion. We include the effect of an external magnetic field and\nshow the appearence of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation and find out the conditions of\ngapped and gapless states in the spectrum. We show that the gauge field due to\na disclination lifts the orbital degeneracy originating from the existence of\ntwo valleys. The broken valley degeneracy has a clear signature on quantum\noscillations and wave packet dynamics.\n", "  We examine the properties of a new family of defects called hyperbolic\ndisclinations, and discuss their possible use for the design of perfect optical\nabsorbers. In hyperbolic metamaterials, the ratio of ordinary and extraordinary\npermittivities is negative, which leads to an effective metric of Kleinian\nsignature (two timelike coordinates). Considering a disclination in the\nhyperbolic nematic host matrix, we show that the timelike geodesics are Poinsot\nspirals, i.e. whatever the impact parameter of an incident light beam, it is\nconfined and whirls about the defect core. The trapping effect does not require\nlight to be coherent. This property also remains in the wave formalism, which\nmay be the sign for many potential applications.\n", "  We analyze the reaction of academic communities to a particular urgent topic\nwhich abruptly arises as a scientific problem. To this end, we have chosen the\ndisaster that occurred in 1986 in Chornobyl (Chernobyl), Ukraine, considered as\none of the most devastating nuclear power plant accidents in history. The\nacademic response is evaluated using scientific-publication data concerning the\ndisaster using the Scopus database to present the picture on an international\nscale and the bibliographic database \"Ukrainika naukova\" to consider it on a\nnational level. We measured distributions of papers in different scientific\nfields, their growth rates and properties of co-authorship networks. {The\nelements of descriptive statistics and the tools of the complex network theory\nare used to highlight the interdisciplinary as well as international effects.}\nOur analysis allows to compare contributions of the international community to\nChornobyl-related research as well as integration of Ukraine in the\ninternational research on this subject. Furthermore, the content analysis of\ntitles and abstracts of the publications allowed to detect the most important\nterms used for description of Chornobyl-related problems.\n", "  In recent years, evaluation of the quality of academic research has become an\nincreasingly important and influential business. It determines, often to a\nlarge extent, the amount of research funding flowing into universities and\nsimilar institutes from governmental agencies and it impacts upon academic\ncareers. Policy makers are becoming increasingly reliant upon, and influenced\nby, the outcomes of such evaluations. In response, university managers are\nincreasingly attracted to simple indicators as guides to the dynamics of the\npositions of their various institutions in league tables. However, these league\ntables are frequently drawn up by inexpert bodies such as newspapers and\nmagazines, using rather arbitrary measures and criteria. Terms such as\n\"critical mass' and \"metrics\" are often bandied about without proper\nunderstanding of what they actually mean. Rather than accepting the rise and\nfall of universities, departments and individuals on a turbulent sea of\narbitrary measures, we suggest it is incumbent upon the scientific community\nitself to clarify their nature. Here we report on recent attempts to do that by\nproperly defining critical mass and showing how group size influences research\nquality. We also examine currently predominant metrics and show that these fail\nas reliable indicators of group research quality.\n", "  This is the second in a series of three papers on systematic analysis of rank\n1 Coulomb branch geometries of four dimensional $\\mathcal{N}$=2 SCFTs. In the\nfirst paper we developed a strategy for classifying physical rank-1 CB\ngeometries of $\\mathcal{N}$=2 SCFTs. Here we show how to carry out this\nstrategy computationally to construct the Seiberg-Witten curves and one-forms\nfor all the rank-1 SCFTs. Explicit expressions are given for all cases, with\nthe exception of the $N_f$=4 SU(2) gauge theory and the En SCFTs which were\npreviously constructed. Our classification includes all known rank-1 theories\nplus a new one with an abelian flavor group, plus nine additional theories\nwhose existence is more speculative. Four of those, reported in our first\npaper, depend on the assumption of new frozen rank-1 SCFTs. Here we also also\nshow that the assumption of the existence of certain rank-0 $\\mathcal{N}$=2\nSCFTs leads to five additional consistent rank-1 CB geometries.\n", "  Quasi-two-dimensional systems may exibit curvature, which adds\nthree-dimensional influence to their internal properties. As shown by da Costa\n\\cite{dacosta}, charged particles moving on a curved surface experience a\ncurvature-dependent potential which greatly influence their dynamics. In this\npaper, we study the electronic ballistic transport in deformed nanotubes. The\none-electron Schr\\\"odinger equation with open boundary conditions is solved\nnumerically with a flexible MAPLE code made available as Supplementary Data. We\nfind that the curvature of the deformations have indeed strong effects on the\nelectron dynamics suggesting its use in the design of nanotube-based electronic\ndevices.\n", "  We show that a simple model of 1D array of topological defects in a\ncrystalline environment is able to guide acoustic waves, depending on the angle\nof the incident wave. We comment on a recently proposed geophysical mechanism\nexplaining the mantle dynamics by the presence, in some crystalline materials\nthere, of wedge disclinations.\n", "  Yrast states are the lowest energy states at given non-zero momentum and\nprovide a natural extension of the concept of dark solitons to\nstrongly-interacting one-dimensional quantum gases. Here we study the yrast\nstates of the balanced spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Fermi gas with attractive\ndelta-function interactions in one dimension with the exactly solvable\nYang-Gaudin model. The corresponding Bethe-ansatz equations are solved for\nfinite particle number and in the thermodynamic limit. Properties corresponding\nto the soliton-like nature of the yrast excitations are calculated including\nthe missing particle number, phase step, and inertial and physical masses. The\ninertial to physical mass ratio, which is related to the frequency of\noscillations in a trapped gas, is found to be unity in the limits of strong and\nweak attraction and falls to $\\approx 0.78$ in the crossover regime. This\nresult is contrasted by one-dimensional mean field theory, which predicts a\ndivergent mass ratio in the weakly attractive limit. By means of an exact\nmapping our results also predict the existence and properties of\ndark-soliton-like excitations in the super Tonks-Girardeau gas. The prospects\nfor experimental observations are briefly discussed.\n", "  We quantify the magnitude of the parton energy loss in jets in lead-lead\ncollisions at the LHC. We extract the effective color factor characterizing the\ndifference between the in-medium radiation of quark-initiated jets and\ngluon-initiated jets from the data. Then, we examine the energy loss of prompt\ncharmonia and we point to a remarkable similarity between the quenching of\nlight-quark-initiated jets and the prompt charmonia suppression. Finally, we\ndiscuss possible sources of this similarity.\n", "  We are taught that gauge transformations in classical and quantum mechanics\ndo not change the physics of the problem. Nevertheless here we discuss three\nbroad scenarios where under gauge transformations: (i) conservation laws are\nnot preserved in the usual manner; (ii) non-gauge-invariant quantities can be\nassociated with physical observables; and (iii) there are changes in the\nphysical boundary conditions of the wave function that render it\nnon-single-valued. We give worked examples that illustrate these points, in\ncontrast to general opinions from classic texts. We also give a historical\nperspective on the development of Abelian gauge theory in relation to our\nparticular points. Our aim is to provide a discussion of these issues at the\ngraduate level.\n", "  We introduce real-time density matrix embedding theory (DMET), a dynamical\nquantum embedding theory for computing non-equilibrium electron dynamics in\nstrongly correlated systems. As in the previously developed static DMET,\nreal-time DMET partitions the system into an impurity corresponding to the\nregion of interest coupled to the surrounding environment, which is efficiently\nrepresented by a quantum bath of the same size as the impurity. In this work,\nwe focus on a single-impurity time-dependent theory as a first step towards a\nfull multi-impurity theory. The equations of motion of the coupled impurity and\nbath embedding problem in real-time DMET are then derived using the\ntime-dependent variational principle. The accuracy of real-time DMET is\ncompared to that of time-dependent complete active space self-consistent field\n(TD-CASSCF) theory and time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory for a variety\nof quantum quenches in the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM), in which the\nHamiltonian is suddenly changed (quenched) to induce a non-equilibrium state.\nReal-time DMET shows a marked improvement over the meanfield TDHF, converging\nto the exact answer even in the non-trivial Kondo regime of the SIAM. However,\nas in static DMET, the increased dynamic flexibility of TD-CASSCF in comparison\nto real-time DMET using a single impurity leads to faster convergence with\nrespect to active space size. Our results demonstrate that real-time DMET is an\nefficient method well suited for the simulation of non-equilibrium electron\ndynamics in which strong electron correlation plays an important role.\n", "  We consider a quantum system strongly coupled to multiple heat baths at\ndifferent temperatures. Quantum heat transport phenomena in this system are\ninvestigated using two definitions of the heat current, one in terms of the\nsystem energy, and the other in terms of the bath energy. When we consider\ncorrelations among system-bath interactions (CASBI) -- which have a purely\nquantum mechanical origin -- the definition in terms of the bath energy becomes\ndifferent. We found that CASBI are necessary to maintain the consistency of the\nheat current with thermodynamic laws in the case of strong system-bath\ncoupling. However, within the context of the quantum master equation approach,\nboth of these definitions are identical. Through a numerical investigation, we\ndemonstrate this point for a non-equilibrium spin-boson model and a three-level\nheat engine model using the reduced hierarchal equations of motion approach\nunder strongly coupled and non-Markovian conditions. We observe cyclic behavior\nof the heat currents and the work performed by the heat engine,and we find that\ntheir phases depend on the system-bath coupling strength. Through consideration\nof the bath heat current, we show that the efficiency of the heat engine\ndecreases as the strength of the system-bath coupling increases, due to the\nCASBI contribution. In the case of a large system-bath coupling, the efficiency\nincreases further if the bath temperature is decreased, with fixed the ratio of\nthe bath temperatures, due to the discretized nature of energy eigenstates.\nThis is also considered to be a unique feature of quantum heat engines.\n", "  We directly measure the thermal energy of the gas surrounding galaxies\nthrough the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We perform a stacking\nanalysis of microwave background images from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope,\naround 1179 massive quiescent elliptical galaxies at 0.5 <= z <= 1.0 ('low-z')\nand 3274 galaxies at 1.0 <= z <= 1.5 ('high-z'), selected using data from the\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer All-Sky Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) within the SDSS Stripe-82 field. The gas surrounding these\ngalaxies is expected to contain energy from past episodes of active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) feedback, and after using modeling to subtract undetected\ncontaminants, we detect a tSZ signal at a significance of 0.9-sigma for our\nlow-z galaxies and 1.8-sigma for our high-z galaxies. We then include data from\nthe high-frequency Planck bands for a subset of 227 low-z galaxies and 529\nhigh-z galaxies and find low-z and high-z tSZ detections of 1.0-sigma and\n1.5-sigma, respectively. These results indicate an average thermal heating\naround these galaxies of 5.6(+5.9/-5.6) x 10^60 erg for our low-z galaxies and\n7.0(+4.7/-4.4) x 10^60 erg for our high-z galaxies. Based on simple heating\nmodels, these results are consistent with gravitational heating without\nadditional heating due to AGN feedback.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of synchronization dynamics in incoherently\npumped exciton-polariton condensates in coupled polariton traps. Our analysis\nis based on a coupled-mode theory for the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, which employs an expansion in non-Hermitian, pump-dependent modes\nappropriate for the pumped geometry. We find that polariton-polariton and\nreservoir-polariton interactions play competing roles and lead to qualitatively\ndifferent synchronized phases of the coupled polariton modes as pumping power\nis increased. Crucially, these interactions can also act against each other to\nhinder synchronization. We map out a phase diagram and discuss the general\ncharacteristics of these phases using a generalized Adler equation.\n", "  We build a tight-binding Hamiltonian describing Co/Ni over graphene,\ncontemplating ATOP (a Co/Ni atom on top of each Carbon atom of one graphene\nsublattice) and HCP (one Co/Ni atom per Graphene plaquette) configurations. For\nthe ATOP configuration the orbitals involved, for the Co/Ni, are the\n$d_{z^2-r^2}$ which most strongly couple to one graphene sublattice and the\n$d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$ orbitals that couple directly to the second sublattice site.\nSuch configuration is diagonal in pseudo-spin and spin space, yielding electron\ndoping of the graphene and antiferro-magnetic ordering in the primitive cell in\nagreement with DFT calculations. The second, HCP configuration is symmetric in\nthe graphene sublattices and only involves coupling to the $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$\norbitals. The register of the lattices in this case allows for a new coupling\nbetween nearest neighbour sites, generating non-diagonal terms in the\npseudo-spin space and novel spin-kinetic couplings mimicking a spin-orbit\ncoupling generated by a magnetic coupling. The resulting proximity effect in\nthis case yields ferromagnetic order in the graphene substrate. We derive the\nband structure in the vicinity of the K points for both configurations, the\nBloch wavefunctions and their spin polarization.\n", "  Recent data on the differential angular distribution for the transfer\nreaction $^{11}$Li(p,d)$^{10}$Li at $E/A=5.7$ MeV in inverse kinematics are\nanalysed within the DWBA reaction framework, using the overlap functions\ncalculated within a three-body model of $^{11}$Li. The weight of the different\n$^{10}$Li configurations in the system's ground state is obtained from the\nstructure calculations unambiguously. The effect of the $^{9}$Li spin in the\ncalculated observables is also investigated. We find that, although all the\nconsidered models succeed in reproducing the shape of the data, the magnitude\nis very sensitive to the content of $p_{1/2}$ wave in the $^{11}$Li\nground-state wave function. Among the considered models, the best agreement\nwith the data is obtained when the $^{11}$Li ground state contains a $\\sim$31\\%\nof $p_{1/2}$ wave in the $n$-$^9$Li subsystem. Although this model takes into\naccount explicitly the splitting of the $1^+$ and $2^+$ resonances due to the\ncoupling of the $p_{1/2}$ wave to the $3/2^-$ spin of the core, a similar\ndegree of agreement can be achieved with a model in which the $^{9}$Li spin is\nignored, provided that it contains a similar p-wave content.\n", "  Considerable attention has been devoted to the wormhole physics in the past\n30 years by exploring the possibilities of finding traversable wormholes\nwithout the need of exotic matter. In particular the thin-shell wormhole\nformalism has been widely investigated by exploiting the cut-and-paste\ntechnique to merge two space-time regions and, to research the stability of\nthese wormholes developed by Visser. This method helps us to minimize the\namount of the exotic matter. In this paper we construct a four dimensional,\nspherically symmetric, dyonic thin-shell wormhole with electric charge $Q$,\nmagnetic charge $P$, and dilaton charge $\\Sigma$, in the context of\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. We have applied Darmois-Israel formalism and\nthe cut-and-paste method by joining together two identical spacetime solutions.\nWe carry out the dyonic thin-shell wormhole stability analyses by using a\nlinear barotropic gas, Chaplygin gas, and logarithmic gas for the exotic\nmatter. It is shown that by choosing suitable parameter values as well as\nequation of state parameter, under specific conditions we obtain a stable\ndyonic thin-shell wormhole solution. Finally we argue that, the stability\ndomain of the dyonic thin-shell wormhole can be increased in terms of electric\ncharge, magnetic charge, and dilaton charge.\n", "  We study the dynamics caused by transport of transverse magnetization in one\ndimensional transverse Ising chain at zero temperature. We observe that a class\nof initial states having product structure in fermionic momentum-space and\nsatisfying certain criteria, produce spatial variation in transverse\nmagnetization. Starting from such a state, we obtain the transverse\nmagnetization analytically and then observe its dynamics in presence of a\nhomogeneous constant field $\\Gamma$. In contradiction with general expectation,\nwhatever be the strength of the field, the magnetization of the system does not\nbecome homogeneous even after infinite time. At each site, the dynamics is\nassociated with oscillations having two different timescales. The envelope of\nthe larger timescale oscillation decays algebraically with an exponent which is\ninvariant for all such special initial states. The frequency of this\noscillation varies differently with external field in ordered and disordered\nphases. The local magnetization after infinite time also characterizes the\nquantum phase transition.\n", "  We formalize the appearance of new types of insulators in long-range (LR)\nfermionic systems. These phases are not included in the \"ten-fold way\nclassification\" (TWC) for the short-range (SR) topological insulators. This\nconclusion is obtained studying at first specific one-dimensional LR examples,\nin particular their phase diagrams and contents in symmetries and entanglement.\nThe purely long-range phases (LRP) are signaled by the violation of the\narea-law for the Von Neumann entropy and by corresponding peculiar\ndistributions for the entanglement spectrum (ES). The origin of the deviations\nfrom the TWC is analyzed from a more general point of view and in any\ndimension. In particular, it is found related with a particular type of\ndivergences occurring in the spectrum, due to the LR couplings. A satisfying\ncharacterization for the LRP can be achieved at least for one-dimensional\nsystems, as well as the connected definition of a nontrivial topology, provided\na careful evaluation of the LR contributions. Our results lead to reconsider\nthe definition of correlation length in LR systems. The same analysis also\nallows to infer, at least for one-dimensional models, the weakening of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence, due to the important correlations between bulk\nand edges, and consequently to clarify the nature of the massive edge states\nappearing in the topological LR. The emergence of this peculiar edge structure\nis signaled by the bulk ES. The stability of the LRP against finite-size\neffects, relevant in current experiments, and against local disorder is\ndiscussed, showing that the latter ingredient can even strengthen the effect of\nthe LR couplings. Finally, we analyze the entanglement content of the\nparadigmatic LR Ising spin chain, inferring again important deviations from the\nSR regime, and the limitations of bulk-boundary (tensor-network based)\napproaches to classify LR spin models.\n", "  This paper mathematically studies membranes and filaments adhering to\nperiodic patterned substrates in a one-dimensional model. The problem is\nformulated by the minimizing problem of an elastic energy with a contact\npotential on graph substrates. Global minimizers (ground states) are mainly\nconsidered in view of their graph representations. Our main results exhibit\nsufficient conditions for the graph representation and examples of situations\nwhere any global minimizer must overhang.\n", "  A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes\nrepresent the units of the network and edges represent connections between\nthose units. For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons\nbetween neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a\ndisproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges\nbetween each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different\nnetworks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network\nintegration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity\nstructure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a\nmyriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse\nclub--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network.\nThe diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties\nconsistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly\ninterconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global\nintegration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that\nproduces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating\nthat these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.\nGiven the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the\nmacaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air\ntraffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These\nresults warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in\nall complex systems.\n", "  Thermal expansion in materials can be accurately modeled with careful\nanharmonic phonon calculations within density functional theory. However,\nbecause of interest in controlling thermal expansion and the time consumed\nevaluating thermal expansion properties of candidate materials, either\ntheoretically or experimentally, an approach to rapidly identifying materials\nwith desirable thermal expansion properties would be of great utility. When the\nionic bonding is important in a material, we show that the fraction of crystal\nvolume occupied by ions, (based upon ionic radii), the mean bond coordination,\nand the deviation of bond coordination are descriptors that correlate with the\nroom-temperature coefficient of thermal expansion for these materials found in\nwidely accessible databases. Correlation is greatly improved by combining these\ndescriptors in a multi-dimensional fit. This fit reinforces the physical\ninterpretation that open space combined with low mean coordination and a\nvariety of local bond coordinations leads to materials with lower coefficients\nof thermal expansion, materials with single-valued local coordination and less\nopen space have the highest coefficients of thermal expansion.\n", "  A long-time quantum memory capable of storing and measuring quantum\ninformation at the single-qubit level is an essential ingredient for practical\nquantum computation and com-munication. Recently, there have been remarkable\nprogresses of increasing coherence time for ensemble-based quantum memories of\ntrapped ions, nuclear spins of ionized donors or nuclear spins in a solid.\nUntil now, however, the record of coherence time of a single qubit is on the\norder of a few tens of seconds demonstrated in trapped ion systems. The qubit\ncoherence time in a trapped ion is mainly limited by the increasing magnetic\nfield fluctuation and the decreasing state-detection efficiency associated with\nthe motional heating of the ion without laser cooling. Here we report the\ncoherence time of a single qubit over $10$ minutes in the hyperfine states of a\n\\Yb ion sympathetically cooled by a \\Ba ion in the same Paul trap, which\neliminates the heating of the qubit ion even at room temperature. To reach such\ncoherence time, we apply a few thousands of dynamical decoupling pulses to\nsuppress the field fluctuation noise. A long-time quantum memory demonstrated\nin this experiment makes an important step for construction of the memory zone\nin scalable quantum computer architectures or for ion-trap-based quantum\nnetworks. With further improvement of the coherence time by techniques such as\nmagnetic field shielding and increase of the number of qubits in the quantum\nmemory, our demonstration also makes a basis for other applications including\nquantum money.\n", "  We study anisotropic inflation in the Brans-Dicke gravity in the presence of\nan abelian gauge field where the gauge field is non-minimally coupled to the\ninflaton. We show that the degree of anisotropy, under slow-roll\napproximations, is proportional to slow roll parameter of the theory. As\ndemonstration, we consider the displaced quadratic potential for the inflation.\nWe do the numerical calculation of the model to investigate the behavior of\nanisotropy by changing the parameter in the Brans-Dicke model. We find out\nthat, the solution is an attractor in the phase space, and anisotropy grows\nwith number of e-folds. Anisotropy depends on Brans-Dicke parameter, $ \\omega\n$, initial values of the scalar field and constant parameter of the coupling\nfunction of the scalar field and the abelian gauge field, $ c $. If we consider\nupper bound on the number of e-folds from CMB i.e. $ 60 $ e-folds, by\nincreasing $ \\omega $ and $ c $, anisotropy do not have time to exit the\nhorizon and suppressed.\n", "  The system of Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations is one of the most celebrated\nsystems of equations in modern science. It describes dynamics of fluids in the\nlimit when gradients of density, velocity and temperature are sufficiently\nsmall, and loses its applicability when the flux becomes so non-equilibrium\nthat the changes of velocity, density or temperature on the length compatible\nwith the mean free path are non-negligible. The question is: how to model such\nfluxes? This problem is still open. (Despite the fact that the first `final\nequations of motion' modified for analysis of thermal creep in rarefied gas\nwere proposed by Maxwell in 1879.) There are, at least, three possible answers:\n(i) use molecular dynamics with individual particles, (ii) use kinetic\nequations, like Boltzmann's equation, or (iii) find a new system of equations\nfor description of fluid dynamics with better accounting of non-equilibrium\neffects. These three approaches work at different scales. We explore the third\npossibility using the recent findings of capillarity of internal layers in\nideal gases and of saturation effect in dissipation (there is a limiting\nattenuation rate for very short waves in ideal gas and it cannot increase\ninfinitely). One candidate equation is discussed in more detail, the Korteweg\nsystem proposed in 1901. The main ideas and approaches are illustrated by a\nkinetic system for which the problem of reduction of kinetics to fluid dynamics\nis analytically solvable.\n", "  We have experimentally realized novel space-time inversion (P-T) invariant\nZ2-type topological semimetal-bands, via an analogy between the momentum space\nand a controllable parameter space in superconducting quantum circuits. By\nmeasuring the whole energy spectrum of system, we imaged clearly an exotic\ntunable gapless band structure of topological semimetals. Two topological\nquantum phase transitions from a topological semimetal to two kinds of\ninsulators can be manipulated by continuously tuning the different parameters\nin the experimental setup, one of which captures the Z2 topology of the PT\nsemimetal via merging a pair of nontrivial Z2 Dirac points. Remarkably, the\ntopological robustness was demonstrated unambiguously, by adding a perturbation\nthat breaks only the individual T and P symmetries but keeps the joint PT\nsymmetry. In contrast, when another kind of PT -violated perturbation is\nintroduced, a topologically trivial insulator gap is fully opened.\n", "  We present the results of three-dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) simulations on the dynamics of a perpendicularly inhomogeneous plasma\ndisturbed by propagating Alfv\\'enic waves. Simpler versions of this scenario\nhave been extensively studied as the phenomenon of phase mixing. We show that,\nby generalizing the textbook version of phase mixing, interesting phenomena are\nobtained, such as turbulence-like behavior and complex current-sheet structure,\na novelty in longitudinally homogeneous plasma excited by unidirectionally\npropagating waves. This constitutes an important finding for turbulence-related\nphenomena in astrophysics in general, relaxing the conditions that have to be\nfulfilled in order to generate turbulent behavior.\n", "  The Nernst thermopower usually is considered far too weak in most metals for\nwaste heat recovery. However, its transverse orientation gives it an advantage\nover the Seebeck effect on non-flat surfaces. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate the scalable generation of a Nernst voltage in an air-cooled metal\nwire coiled around a hot cylinder. In this geometry, a radial temperature\ngradient generates an azimuthal electric field in the coil. A Galfenol\n(Fe$_{0.85}$Ga$_{0.15}$) wire is wrapped around a cartridge heater, and the\nvoltage drop across the wire is measured as a function of axial magnetic field.\nAs expected, the Nernst voltage scales linearly with the length of the wire.\nBased on heat conduction and fluid dynamic equations, finite-element method is\nused to calculate the temperature gradient across the Galfenol wire and\ndetermine the Nernst coefficient. A giant Nernst coefficient of -2.6\n${\\mu}$V/KT at room temperature is estimated, in agreement with measurements on\nbulk Galfenol. We expect that the giant Nernst effect in Galfenol arises from\nits magnetostriction, presumably through enhanced magnon-phonon coupling. Our\nresults demonstrate the feasibility of a transverse thermoelectric generator\ncapable of scalable output power from non-flat heat sources.\n", "  We propose a new family of coherence monotones, named the \\emph{generalized\ncoherence concurrence} (or coherence $k$-concurrence), which is an analogous\nconcept to the generalized entanglement concurrence. The coherence\n$k$-concurrence of a state is nonzero if and only if the coherence number (a\nrecently introduced discrete coherence monotone) of the state is not smaller\nthan $k$, and a state can be converted to a state with nonzero entanglement\n$k$-concurrence via incoherent operations if and only if the state has nonzero\ncoherence $k$-concurrence. We apply the coherence concurrence family to the\nproblem of wave-particle duality in multi-path interference phenomena. We\nobtain a sharper equation for path distinguishability (which witness the\nduality) than the known value and show that the amount of each concurrence for\nthe quanton state determines the number of slits which are identified\nunambiguously.\n", "  The symmetry breakdown pattern is studied in models containing one fermion\nflavor multiplet and a multicomponent scalar field, supplemented with a chiral\nYukawa-interaction, and in presence of an explicit symmetry breaking source\nquadratic in the scalar field. In a detailed investigation of the model with\n$U_L(1) \\times U_R(1)$ chiral symmetry it is shown that by diminishing the\nstrength of quadratic explicit symmetry breaking one can still keep stable the\nmass ratio of the fermionic and the pseudo-Goldstone excitation. At the same\ntime the mass ratio of the two bosonic excitations appears to approach a\nlimiting value depending only on the infrared value of the first ratio, but not\non the microscopic (ultraviolet) coupling values. The observations receive a\ngeneral interpretation by the existence of an ultraviolet fixed point located\nin the symmetric phase. Understanding the general conditions for its existence\nallows the construction of a similar theory with $U_L(2) \\times U_R(2)$ chiral\nsymmetry. All results of the present investigation were obtained with\nnonperturbative functional renormalisation group technique making use of the\nfirst two approximations to the gradient expansion of the effective action.\n", "  Electric and thermal transport properties of a $\\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum\nHall junction are analyzed. We investigate the evolution of the electric and\nthermal two-terminal conductances, $G$ and $G^Q$, with system size $L$ and\ntemperature $T$. This is done both for the case of strong interaction between\nthe 1 and 1/ 3 modes (when the low-temperature physics of the interacting\nsegment of the device is controlled by the vicinity of the strong-disorder\nKane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point) and for relatively weak interaction, for\nwhich the disorder is irrelevant at $T=0$ in the renormalization-group sense.\nThe transport properties in both cases are similar in several respects. In\nparticular, $G(L)$ is close to 4/3 (in units of $e^2/h$) and $G^Q$ to 2 (in\nunits of $\\pi T / 6 \\hbar$) for small $L$, independently of the interaction\nstrength. For large $L$ the system is in an incoherent regime, with $G$ given\nby 2/3 and $G^Q$ showing the Ohmic scaling, $G^Q\\propto 1/L$, again for any\ninteraction strength. The hallmark of the strong-disorder fixed point is the\nemergence of an intermediate range of $L$, in which the electric conductance\nshows strong mesoscopic fluctuations and the thermal conductance is $G^Q=1$.\nThe analysis is extended also to a device with floating 1/3 mode, as studied in\na recent experiment [A. Grivnin et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 266803 (2014)].\n", "  Residual accelerations due to thermal effects are estimated through a model\nof the New Horizons spacecraft and a Monte Carlo simulation. We also discuss\nand estimate the thermal effects on the attitude of the spacecraft. The work is\nbased on a method previously used for the Pioneer and Cassini probes, which\nsolve the Pioneer anomaly problem. The results indicate that after the\nencounter with Pluto there is a residual acceleration of the order of\n$10^{-9}~\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, and that rotational effects should be difficult,\nalthough not impossible, to detect.\n", "  By analyzing the interface defect loop nucleation and the interface\ndisconnection expansion in dynamic simulations, the elementary migration\nprocess of coherent twin boundary of magnesium is identified to be independent\nunit cell reconstruction. The atomistic pathways of the unit cell\nreconstruction prove their collective behavior as a stochastic response to\nthermal fluctuation at a stressed state, and also the onset mechanism of\ninterface disconnection gliding: predominant pure-shuffle basal-prismatic\ntransformation along with atomistic shear movements. The athermal shear\nstrength, the migration barrier, the critical length of disconnection dipole\nand other parameters characterizing the thermal activation process are\nreported.\n", "  In this paper we show the validity, under certain geometric conditions, of\nWheeler's thin sandwich conjecture for higher dimensional theories of gravity.\nWe extend the results shown by R. Bartnik and G. Fodor for the 3-dimensional\ncase in two ways. On the one hand, we show that the results obtained by the\nmentioned authors are valid in arbitrary dimensions, and on the other hand we\nshow that the geometric hypotheses needed for the proofs can always be\nsatisfied, which constitutes in itself a new result for the 3-dimensional case.\nIn this way, we show that on any compact n-dimensional manifold, n greater or\nequal to 3, there is an open set in the space of all possible initial data\nwhere the thin sandwich problem is well-posed.\n", "  We introduce a rigorous definition of general power-spectrum responses as\nresummed vertices with two hard and $n$ soft momenta in cosmological\nperturbation theory. These responses measure the impact of long-wavelength\nperturbations on the local small-scale power spectrum. The kinematic structure\nof the responses (i.e., their angular dependence) can be decomposed\nunambiguously through a \"bias\" expansion of the local power spectrum, with a\nfixed number of physical response coefficients, which are only a function of\nthe hard wavenumber $k$. Further, the responses up to $n$-th order completely\ndescribe the $(n+2)$-point function in the squeezed limit, i.e. with two hard\nand $n$ soft modes, which one can use to derive the response coefficients. This\ngeneralizes previous results, which relate the angle-averaged squeezed limit to\nisotropic response coefficients. We derive the complete expression of first-\nand second-order responses at leading order in perturbation theory, and present\nextrapolations to nonlinear scales based on simulation measurements of the\nisotropic response coefficients. As an application, we use these results to\npredict the non-Gaussian part of the angle-averaged matter power spectrum\ncovariance ${\\rm Cov}^{\\rm NG}_{\\ell = 0}(k_1,k_2)$, in the limit where one of\nthe modes, say $k_2$, is much smaller than the other. Without any free\nparameters, our model results are in very good agreement with simulations for\n$k_2 \\lesssim 0.06\\ h/{\\rm Mpc}$, and for any $k_1 \\gtrsim 2 k_2$. The\nwell-defined kinematic structure of the power spectrum response also permits a\nquick evaluation of the angular dependence of the covariance matrix. While we\nfocus on the matter density field, the formalism presented here can be\ngeneralized to generic tracers such as galaxies.\n", "  Intensity interferometry is a technique that has been used to measure the\nsize of sources ranging from the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion\ncollisions to the radii of stars. We investigate using the same technique to\nmeasure proto-neutron star (PNS) radii with the neutrino signal received from a\ncore-collapse supernovae. Using a full wave-packet analysis, including the\nneutrino mass for the first time, we derive criteria where the effect can be\nexpected to provide the desired signal, and find that neutrinos from the next\nGalactic supernova should contain extractable PNS radius information.\n", "  We address the problem of quantum particles moving on a manifold\ncharacterised by the presence of torsion along a preferential axis. In fact,\nsuch a torsion may be taylored by the presence of a single screw dislocation,\nwhose Burgers vector measures the torsion amplitude. The problem, first treated\nin the relativistic limit describing fermions that couple minimally to torsion,\nis then analysed in the Pauli limit We show that torsion induces a geometric\npotential and also that it couples generically to the phase of the wave\nfunction, giving rise to the possibility of using torsion to manipulate spin\ncurrents in the case of spinor wave functions. These results emerge as an\nalternative strategy for using screw dislocations in the design of\nspintronic-based devices.\n", "  For centuries, cutting and folding the papers with special patterns have been\nused to build beautiful, flexible and complex three-dimensional structures.\nInspired by the old idea of kirigami (paper cutting), and the outstanding\nproperties of graphene, recently graphene kirigami structures were fabricated\nto enhance the stretchability of graphene. However, the possibility of further\ntuning the electronic and thermal transport along the 2D kirigami structures\nhave remained original to investigate. We therefore performed extensive\natomistic simulations to explore the electronic, heat and load transfer along\nvarious graphene kirigami structures. The mechanical response and thermal\ntransport were explored using classical molecular dynamics simulations. We then\nused a real-space Kubo-Greenwood formalism to investigate the charge transport\ncharacteristics in graphene kirigami. Our results reveal that graphene kirigami\nstructures present highly anisotropic thermal and electrical transport.\nInterestingly, we show the possibility of tuning the thermal conductivity of\ngraphene by four orders of magnitude. Moreover, we discuss the engineering of\nkirigami patterns to further enhance their stretchability by more than 10 times\nas compared with pristine graphene. Our study not only provides a general\nunderstanding concerning the engineering of electronic, thermal and mechanical\nresponse of graphene but more importantly can be useful to guide future studies\nwith respect to the synthesis of other 2D material kirigami structures, to\nreach highly flexible and stretchable nanostructures with finely tunable\nelectronic and thermal properties.\n", "  Pulsar timing and gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are superb laboratories\nto study gravity theories in the strong-field regime. Here we combine those\ntools to test the mono-scalar-tensor theory of Damour and Esposito-Far{\\`e}se\n(DEF), which predicts nonperturbative scalarization phenomena for neutron stars\n(NSs). First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory. Since the binary-pulsar bounds depend on the NS mass\nand the EOS, we find that current pulsar-timing observations leave\nscalarization windows, i.e., regions of parameter space where scalarization can\nstill be prominent. Then, we investigate if these scalarization windows could\nbe closed and if pulsar-timing constraints could be improved by\nlaser-interferometer GW detectors, when spontaneous (or dynamical)\nscalarization sets in during the early (or late) stages of a binary NS (BNS)\nevolution. For the early inspiral of a BNS carrying constant scalar charge, we\nemploy a Fisher matrix analysis to show that Advanced LIGO can improve\npulsar-timing constraints for some EOSs, and next-generation detectors, such as\nthe Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to improve those\nbounds for all eleven EOSs. Using the late inspiral of a BNS, we estimate that\nfor some of the EOSs under consideration the onset of dynamical scalarization\ncan happen early enough to improve the constraints on the DEF parameters\nobtained by combining the five binary pulsars. Thus, in the near future the\ncomplementarity of pulsar timing and direct observations of GWs on the ground\nwill be extremely valuable in probing gravity theories in the strong-field\nregime.\n", "  We propose a natural $ S_4 \\times SO(10) $ supersymmetric grand unified\ntheory of flavour with an auxiliary $\\mathbb{Z}_4^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4^R$\nsymmetry, based on small Higgs representations (nothing larger than an adjoint)\nand hence a type-I seesaw mechanism. The Yukawa structure of all fermions is\ndetermined by the hierarchical vacuum expectation values of three $ S_4 $\ntriplet flavons, with CSD3 vacuum alignments, where up-type quarks and\nneutrinos couple to one Higgs $\\mathbf{10}$, and the down-type quarks and\ncharged leptons couple to a second Higgs $\\mathbf{10}$. The Yukawa matrices are\nobtained from sums of low-rank matrices, where each matrix in the sum naturally\naccounts for the mass of a particular family, as in sequential dominance in the\nneutrino sector, which predicts a normal neutrino mass hierarchy. The model\naccurately fits all available quark and lepton data, with predictions for the\nleptonic $CP$ phase in 95$\\%$ credible intervals given by $ 281^\\circ <\n\\delta^\\ell < 308^\\circ $ and $ 225^\\circ < \\delta^\\ell < 253^\\circ $. The\nmodel reduces to the MSSM, with the two Higgs doublets emerging from the two\nHiggs $\\mathbf{10}$s without mixing, and we demonstrate how a $\\mu$ term of\n$\\mathcal{O}$(TeV) can be realised, as well as doublet-triplet splitting, with\nPlanck scale operators controlled by symmetry, leading to acceptable proton\ndecay.\n", "  Experimentally the spin dependence of inelastic collisions between ytterbium\n(Yb) in the metastable 3P0 state and lithium (Li) in the Li ground state\nmanifold is investigated at low magnetic fields. Using selective excitation all\nmagnetic sublevels mJ of 174Yb(3P0) are accessed and four of the six lowest\nlying magnetic sublevels of 6Li are prepared by optical pumping. On the one\nhand, mJ-independence of collisions involving Li(F=1/2) atoms is found. A\nsystematic mJ-dependence in collisions with Li(F=3/2) atoms, in particular\nsuppressed losses for stretched collisional states, is observed on the other\nhand. Further, mJ-changing processes are found to be of minor relevance. The\nspan of observed inelastic collision rates is between 1*10^{-11} cm^3/s and\n40*10^{-11} cm^3/s, and a possible origin of the observed behavior is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Lorentz gauge theory (LGT) is a feasible candidate for theory of quantum\ngravity in which routine field theory calculations can be carried out\nperturbatively without encountering too many divergences. In LGT spin of matter\nalso gravitates. The spin-generated gravity is expected to be extremely\nstronger than that generated by mass and could be explored in current\ncolliders. In this article the observable signals of the theory in an\nelectron-positron collider is investigated. We specifically study pair\nannihilation into two gravitons, and LGT corrections to processes like\n$e^-+e^+\\rightarrow \\mu^-+\\mu^+$ and $e^-+e^+\\rightarrow e^-+e^+$.\n", "  Boundaries strongly affect the behavior of quantized vortices in\nBose-Einstein condensates, a phenomenon particularly evident in elongated\ncigar-shaped traps where vortices tend to orient along a short direction to\nminimize energy. Remarkably, contributions to the angular momentum of these\nvortices are tightly confined to the region surrounding the core, in stark\ncontrast to untrapped condensates where all atoms contribute $\\hbar$. We\ndevelop a theoretical model and use this, in combination with numerical\nsimulations, to show that such localized vortices precess in an analogous\nmanner to that of a classical spinning top. We experimentally verify this\nspinning-top behavior with our real-time imaging technique that allows for the\ntracking of position and orientation of vortices as they dynamically evolve.\nFinally, we perform an in-depth numerical investigation of our real-time\nexpansion and imaging method, with the aim of guiding future experimental\nimplementation, as well as outlining directions for its improvement.\n", "  In a multidimensional Kaluza-Klein model with Ricci-flat internal space, we\nstudy the gravitational field in the weak-field limit. This field is created by\ntwo coupled sources. First, this is a point-like massive body which has a\ndust-like equation of state in the external space and an arbitrary parameter\n$\\Omega$ of equation of state in the internal space. The second source is a\nstatic spherically symmetric massive scalar field centered at the origin where\nthe point-like massive body is. The found perturbed metric coefficients are\nused to calculate the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter $\\gamma$. We\ndefine under which conditions $\\gamma$ can be very close to unity in accordance\nwith the relativistic gravitational tests in the Solar system. This can take\nplace for both massive or massless scalar fields. For example, to have $\\gamma\n\\approx 1$ in the Solar system, the mass of scalar field should be $\\mu \\gtrsim\n5.05\\times 10^{-49}$g $\\sim 2.83\\times 10^{-16}$eV. In all cases, we arrive at\nthe same conclusion that to be in agreement with the relativistic gravitational\ntests, the gravitating mass should have tension: $\\Omega=-1/2$.\n", "  On the basis of quasipotential method in quantum electrodynamics we calculate\nnuclear finite size radiative corrections of order $\\alpha(Z \\alpha)^5$ to the\nLamb shift in muonic hydrogen and helium. To construct the interaction\npotential of particles, which gives the necessary contributions to the energy\nspectrum, we use the method of projection operators to states with a definite\nspin. Separate analytic expressions for the contributions of the muon\nself-energy, the muon vertex operator and the amplitude with spanning photon\nare obtained. We present also numerical results for these contributions using\nmodern experimental data on the electromagnetic form factors of light nuclei.\n", "  We propose that Gravitational Wave (GW) bursts with millisecond durations can\nbe explained by the GW emission from the hyperbolic encounters of Primordial\nBlack Holes in dense clusters. These bursts are single events, with the bulk of\nthe released energy happening during the closest approach, and emitted in\nfrequencies within the AdvLIGO sensitivity range. We provide expressions for\nthe shape of the GW emission in terms of the peak frequency and amplitude, and\nestimate the rates of these events for a variety of mass and velocity\nconfigurations. We study the regions of parameter space that will allow\ndetection by both AdvLIGO and, in the future, LISA. We find for realistic\nconfigurations, with total mass $M\\sim60\\,M_\\odot$, relative velocities $v\\sim\n0.01\\,c$, and impact parameters $b\\sim10^{-3}$ AU, for AdvLIGO an expected\nevent rate is ${\\cal O}(10)$ events/yr/Gpc$^3$ with millisecond durations. For\nLISA, the typical duration is in the range of minutes to hours and the\nevent-rate is ${\\cal O}(10^3)$ events/yr/Gpc$^3$ for both $10^3\\,M_\\odot$ IMBH\nand $10^6\\,M_\\odot$ SMBH encounters. We also study the distribution functions\nof eccentricities, peak frequencies and characteristic timescales that can be\nexpected for a population of scattering PBH with a log-normal distribution in\nmasses, different relative velocities and a flat prior on the impact parameter.\n", "  Glass films created by vapor-depositing molecules onto a substrate can\nexhibit properties similar to those of ordinary glasses aged for thousands of\nyears. It is believed that enhanced surface mobility is the mechanism that\nallows vapor deposition to create such exceptional glasses, but it is unclear\nhow this effect is related to the final state of the film. Here we use\nmolecular dynamics simulations to model vapor deposition and an efficient Monte\nCarlo algorithm to determine the deposition rate needed to create ultra-stable\nglassy films. We obtain a scaling relation that quantitatively captures the\nefficiency gain of vapor deposition over bulk annealing, and demonstrates that\nsurface relaxation plays the same role in the formation of vapor-deposited\nglasses as bulk relaxation does in ordinary glass formation.\n", "  A universal amplification scheme of ultra-small phase based on weak\nmeasurements is given and a weak measurements amplification based laser\ninterferometer gravitational-wave observatory (WMA-LIGO) is suggested. The\nWMA-LIGO has potential to amplify the ultra-small phase signal to at least\n$10^{3}$ order of magnitude such that the sensitivity and bandwidth of\ngravitational-wave detector can be further improved. Our results not only shed\na new light on the quantum measurement but also open a new way to the\ngravitational-wave detection.\n", "  We use the Quench Action approach to study the non-equilibrium dynamics after\na quantum quench in the Hubbard model in the limit of infinite interaction. We\nidentify a variety of low-entangled initial states for which we can directly\ncompute the overlaps with the Hamiltonian's eigenstates. For these initial\nstates, we analytically find the rapidity distributions of the stationary state\ncharacterising the expectation values of all local observables. Some of the\ninitial states considered are not reflection symmetric and lead to\nnon-symmetric rapidity distributions. To study such cases, we have to introduce\na generalised form for the reduced entropy which measures the entropy\nrestricted to states with non-zero overlap. The initial states considered are\nof direct experimental realisability and also represent ideal candidates for\nstudying non-equilibrium dynamics in the Hubbard model for finite interactions.\n", "  The next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT), with diameters up to\n39 meters, is planned to begin operation in the next decade and promises new\nchallenges in the development of instruments since the instrument size\nincreases in proportion to the telescope diameter D, and the cost as D2 or\nfaster. The growing field of astrophotonics (the use of photonic technologies\nin astronomy) could solve this problem by allowing mass production of fully\nintegrated and robust instruments combining various optical functions, with the\npotential to reduce the size, complexity and cost of instruments.\nAstrophotonics allows for a broad range of new optical functions, with\napplications ranging from sky background filtering, high spatial and spectral\nresolution imaging and spectroscopy. In this paper, we want to provide\nastronomers with valuable keys to understand how photonics solutions can be\nimplemented (or not) according to the foreseen applications. The paper\nintroduces first key concepts linked to the characteristics of photonics\ntechnologies, placed in the framework of astronomy and spectroscopy. We then\ndescribe a series of merit criteria that help us determine the potential of a\ngiven micro-spectrograph technology for astronomy applications, and then take\nan inventory of the recent developments in integrated micro-spectrographs with\npotential for astronomy. We finally compare their performance, to finally draw\na map of typical science requirements and pin the identified integrated\ntechnologies on it. We finally emphasize the necessary developments that must\nsupport micro-spectrograph in the coming years.\n", "  We study the influence of kinetic-scale Alfv\\'enic turbulence on the\ngeneration of plasma radio emission in the solar coronal regions where the\nplasma/magnetic pressure ratio $\\beta $ is smaller than the electron/ion mass\nratio $m_{e}/m_{i}$. The present study is motivated by the phenomenon of solar\ntype I radio storms associated with the strong magnetic field of active\nregions. The measured brightness temperature of the type I storms can be up to\n$10^{10}$ K for continuum emission, and can exceed $10^{11}$ K for type I\nbursts. At present, there is no generally accepted theory explaining such high\nbrightness temperatures and some other properties of the type I storms. We\npropose the model with the imbalanced turbulence of kinetic-scale Alfv\\'en\nwaves producing an asymmetric quasilinear plateau on the upward half of the\nelectron velocity distribution. The Landau damping of resonant Langmuir waves\nis suppressed and their amplitudes grow spontaneously above the thermal level.\nThe estimated saturation level of Langmuir waves is high enough to generate\nobserved type I radio emission at the fundamental plasma frequency. Harmonic\nemission does not appear in our model because the backward-propagating Langmuir\nwaves undergo a strong Landau damping. Our model predicts $100\\%$ polarization\nin the sense of the ordinary (o-) mode of type I emission.\n", "  We study interfacial magnetocrystalline anisotropies in various\nFe/semiconductor heterostructures by means of first-principles calculations. We\nfind that many of those systems show perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA)\nwith a positive value of the interfacial anisotropy constant $K_{\\rm i}$. In\nparticular, the Fe/CuInSe$_2$ interface has a large $K_{\\rm i}$ of $\\sim\n2.3\\,{\\rm mJ/m^2}$, which is about 1.6 times larger than that of Fe/MgO known\nas a typical system with relatively large PMA. We also find that the values of\n$K_{\\rm i}$ in almost all the systems studied in this work follow the\nwell-known Bruno's relation, which indicates that minority-spin states around\nthe Fermi level provide dominant contributions to the interfacial\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropies. Detailed analyses of the local density of\nstates and wave-vector-resolved anisotropy energy clarify that the large\n$K_{\\rm i}$ in Fe/CuInSe$_2$ is attributed to the preferable $3d$-orbital\nconfigurations around the Fermi level in the minority-spin states of the\ninterfacial Fe atoms. Moreover, we have shown that the locations of interfacial\nSe atoms are the key for such orbital configurations of the interfacial Fe\natoms.\n", "  A number of reconstruction methods have been proposed recently for\naccelerated functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data collection.\nHowever, existing methods suffer with the challenge of greater artifacts at\nhigh acceleration factors. This paper addresses the issue of accelerating fMRI\ncollection via undersampled k-space measurements combined with the proposed\nDouble Temporal Sparsity based Reconstruction (DTSR) method with the l1 -l1\nnorm constraint. The robustness of the proposed DTSR method has been thoroughly\nevaluated both at the subject level and at the group level on real fMRI data.\nResults are presented at various acceleration factors. Quantitative analysis in\nterms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other metrics, and qualitative\nanalysis in terms of reproducibility of brain Resting State Networks (RSNs)\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is accurate and robust. In addition, the\nproposed DTSR method preserves brain networks that are important for studying\nfMRI data. Compared to the existing accelerated fMRI reconstruction methods,\nthe DTSR method shows promising potential with an improvement of 10-12dB in\nPSNR with acceleration factors upto 3.5. Simulation results on real data\ndemonstrate that DTSR method can be used to acquire accelerated fMRI with\naccurate detection of RSNs.\n", "  Using a dimensional reduction scheme based on scattering theory, we show that\nthe classification tables for topological insulators and superconductors with\nreflection symmetry can be organized in two period-two and four period-eight\ncycles, similar to the Bott periodicity found for topological insulators and\nsuperconductors without spatial symmetries. With the help of the dimensional\nreduction scheme the classification in arbitrary dimensions $d \\ge 1$ can be\nobtained from the classification in one dimension, for which we present a\nderivation based on relative homotopy groups and exact sequences to classify\none-dimensional insulators and superconductors with reflection symmetry. The\nresulting classification is fully consistent with a comprehensive\nclassification obtained recently by Shiozaki and Sato [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ B {\\bf 90},\n165114 (2014)]. The use of a scattering-matrix inspired method allows us to\naddress the second descendant $\\bZ_2$ phase, for which the topological\nnontrivial phase was previously reported to be vulnerable to perturbations that\nbreak translation symmetry.\n", "  We analyze a multiqubit circuit QED system in the regime where the\nqubit-photon coupling dominates over the system's bare energy scales. Under\nsuch conditions a manifold of low-energy states with a high degree of\nentanglement emerges. Here we describe a time-dependent protocol for extracting\nthese quantum correlations and converting them into well-defined multipartite\nentangled states of noninteracting qubits. Based on a combination of various\nultrastrong-coupling effects, the protocol can be operated in a fast and robust\nmanner, while still being consistent with experimental constraints on switching\ntimes and typical energy scales encountered in superconducting circuits.\nTherefore, our scheme can serve as a probe for otherwise inaccessible\ncorrelations in strongly coupled circuit QED systems. It also shows how such\ncorrelations can potentially be exploited as a resource for entanglement-based\napplications.\n", "  ZrSiS exhibits a frequency-independent interband conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)\n= \\rm{const}(\\omega) \\equiv \\sigma_{\\rm{flat}}$ in a broad range from 250 to\n2500 cm$^{-1}$ (30 - 300 meV). This makes ZrSiS similar to\n(quasi)two-dimensional Dirac electron systems, such as graphite and graphene.\nWe assign the flat optical conductivity to the transitions between\nquasi-two-dimensional Dirac bands near the Fermi level. In contrast to\ngraphene, $\\sigma_{\\rm{flat}}$ is not supposed to be universal but related to\nthe length of the nodal line in the reciprocal space, $k_{0}$. When\n$\\sigma_{\\rm{flat}}$ and $k_{0}$ are connected by a simple model, we find good\nagreement between experiment and theory. Due to the spin-orbit coupling, the\ndiscussed Dirac bands in ZrSiS possess a small gap $\\Delta$, for which we\ndetermine an upper bound max($\\Delta$) = 30 meV from our optical measurements.\nAt low temperatures the momentum-relaxation rate collapses, and the\ncharacteristic length scale of momentum relaxation is of the order of microns\nbelow 50 K.\n", "  There are circular planar null geodesics at $r=3M$ around a Schwarzschild\nblack hole of mass $M$. These geodesics form a photon sphere. Null geodesics of\nthe Schwarzschild space-time which do not form the photon sphere are either\nescape to null infinity or get captured by the black hole. Thus, from the\ndynamical point of view, the photon sphere represents a smooth basin boundary\nthat separates the basins of escape and capture of the dynamical system\ngoverning the null geodesics. Here we consider a Schwarzschild black hole\ndistorted by an external, static, and axisymmetric quadrupolar gravitational\nfield. We study null geodesics around such a black hole and show that the\nphoton sphere transforms into a fractal basin boundary that indicates chaotic\nbehavior of the null geodesics. We calculate the box-counting fractal dimension\nof the basin boundary and the related uncertainty exponent, which depend on the\nvalue of the quadrupole moment.\n", "  We study the isospin breaking in the reactions $\\chi_{c1} \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^+\n\\pi^-$ and $\\chi_{c1} \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0 \\eta$ and its relation to the $a_0(980) -\nf_0(980)$ mixing, which was measured by the BESIII Collaboration. We show that\nthe same theoretical model previously developed to study the $\\chi_{c1} \\to\n\\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ reaction (also measured by BESIII), and further explored in\nthe predictions to the $\\eta_{c} \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, can be successfully\nemployed in the present study. We assume that the $\\chi_{c1}$ behaves as an\n$SU(3)$ singlet to find the weight in which trios of pseudoscalars are created,\nfollowed by the final state interaction of pairs of mesons to describe how the\n$a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ are dynamically generated, using the chiral unitary\napproach in coupled channels. The isospin violation is introduced through the\nuse of different masses for the charged and neutral kaons, either in the\npropagators of the pairs of mesons created in the $\\chi_{c1}$ decay, or in the\npropagators inside the $T$ matrix, constructed through the unitarization of the\nscattering and transition amplitudes of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons. We find\nthat violating isospin inside the $T$ matrix makes the $\\pi^0\\eta \\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ amplitude nonzero, which gives an important contribution and also\nenhances the effect of the $K\\bar{K}$ term. Also, we find that in the total\namplitude the most important effect is the isospin breaking inside the $T$\nmatrix, due to the constructive sum of $\\pi^0\\eta \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $K\\bar{K}\n\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, which is essential to get a good agreement with the\nexperimental measurement of the mixing.\n", "  We have performed resonant X-ray diffraction experiments on the\nantiferromagnet GdRu$_{2}$Al$_{10}$ and have clarified that the magnetic\nstructure in the ordered state is cycloidal with the moments lying in the $bc$\nplane and propagating along the $b$ axis. The propagation vector shows a\nsimilar temperature dependence to the magnetic order parameter, which can be\ninterpreted as being associated with the gap opening in the conduction band and\nthe resultant change in the magnetic exchange interaction. Although the $S=7/2$\nstate of Gd is almost isotropic, the moments show slight preferential ordering\nalong the $b$ axis. The $c$ axis component in the cycloid develops with\ndecreasing temperature through a tiny transition in the ordered phase. We also\nshow that the scattering involves the $\\sigma$-$\\sigma'$ process, which is\nforbidden in normal $E1$-$E1$ resonance of magnetic dipole origin. We discuss\nthe possibility of the $E1$-$E2$ resonance originating from a toroidal moment\ndue to the lack of inversion symmetry at the Gd site. The spin-flop transition\nin a magnetic field is also described in detail.\n", "  Inspiraling and merging binary neutron stars are not only important source of\ngravitational waves, but also promising candidates for coincident\nelectromagnetic counterparts. These systems are thought to be progenitors of\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). We have shown previously that binary neutron\nstar mergers that undergo {\\it delayed} collapse to a black hole surrounded by\na {\\it weighty} magnetized accretion disk can drive magnetically-powered jets.\nWe now perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity of\nbinary neutron stars mergers that undergo {\\it prompt} collapse to explore the\npossibility of jet formation from black hole-{\\it light} accretion disk\nremnants. We find that after $t-t_{\\rm BH}\\sim 26(M_{\\rm NS}/1.8M_\\odot)$ms\n[$M_{\\rm NS}$ is the ADM mass] following prompt black hole formation, there is\nno evidence of mass outflow or magnetic field collimation. The rapid formation\nof the black hole following merger prevents magnetic energy from approaching\nforce-free values above the magnetic poles, which is required for the launching\nof a jet by the usual Blandford--Znajek mechanism. Detection of gravitational\nwaves in coincidence with sGRBs may provide constraints on the nuclear equation\nof state (EOS): the fate of an NSNS merger--delayed or prompt collapse, and\nhence the appearance or nonappearance of an sGRB--depends on a critical value\nof the total mass of the binary, and this value is sensitive to the EOS.\n", "  We derive the Hawking radiation power equations for black holes in\nasymptotically flat, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and asymptotically de\nSitter (dS) black holes, This is done by using the greybody factor for these\nblack holes. We observe that the radiation power equation for asymptotically\nflat black holes, corresponding to greybody factor at low frequency, depends on\nboth the Hawking temperature and the horizon radius. However, for the greybody\nfactors at asymptotic frequency, it only depends on the Hawking temperature. We\nalso obtain the power equation for asymptotically AdS black holes both below\nand above the critical frequency. The radiation power equation for at\nasymptotic frequency is same for both Schwarzschild AdS and\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om AdS solutions and only depends on the Hawking temperature.\nWe also discuss the power equation for asymptotically dS black holes at low\nfrequency, for both even or odd dimensions.\n", "  We present a new method for photometering objects in galaxy clusters. We\nintroduce a mode-filtering technique for removing spatially variable\nbackgrounds, improving both detection and photometric accuracy (roughly halving\nthe scatter in the red sequence compared to previous catalogs of the same\nclusters). This method is based on robustly determining the distribution of\nbackground pixel values and should provide comparable improvement in\nphotometric analysis of any crowded fields. We produce new multiwavelength\ncatalogs for the 25 CLASH cluster fields in all 16 bandpasses from the UV\nthrough the near IR, as well as rest-frame magnitudes. A comparison with\nspectroscopic values from the literature finds a ~30% decrease in the redshift\ndeviation from previously-released CLASH photometry. This improvement in\nredshift precision, in combination with a detection scheme designed to maximize\npurity, yields a substantial upgrade in cluster member identification over the\nprevious CLASH galaxy catalog. We construct luminosity functions for each\ncluster, reliably reaching depths of at least 4.5 mag below M* in every case,\nand deeper still in several clusters. We measure M* , $\\alpha$, and their\nredshift evolution, assuming the cluster populations are coeval, and find\nlittle to no evolution of $\\alpha$, $-0.9\\lesssim\\langle\\alpha\\rangle\\lesssim\n-0.8$, and M* values consistent with passive evolution. We present a catalog of\ngalaxy photometry, photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, and rest-frame\nphotometry for the full fields of view of all 25 CLASH clusters. Not only will\nour new photometric catalogs enable new studies of the properties of CLASH\nclusters, but mode-filtering techniques, such as those presented here, should\ngreatly enhance the data quality of future photometric surveys of crowded\nfields.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength spectral and temporal analysis of the blazar OJ\n287 during its recent activity between December 2015 -- May 2016, showing\nstrong variability in the near-infrared (NIR) to X-ray energies with detection\nat $\\gamma$-ray energies as well. Most of the optical flux variations exhibit\nstrong changes in polarization angle and degree. All the inter-band time lags\nare consistent with simultaneous emissions. Interestingly, on days with\nexcellent data coverage in the NIR--UV bands, the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) show signatures of bumps in the visible--UV bands, never seen before in\nthis source. The optical bump can be explained as accretion-disk emission\nassociated with the primary black hole of mass $\\sim \\rm 1.8 \\times10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$ while the little bump feature in the optical-UV appears consistent\nwith line emission. Further, the broadband SEDs extracted during the first\nflare and during a quiescent period during this span show very different\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra compared to previously observed flare or quiescent\nspectra. The probable thermal bump in the visible seems to have been clearly\npresent since May 2013, as found by examining all available NIR-optical\nobservations, and favors the binary super-massive black hole model. The\nsimultaneous multi-wavelength variability and relatively weak $\\gamma$-ray\nemission that shows a shift in the SED peak is consistent with $\\gamma$-ray\nemission originating from inverse Compton scattering of photons from the line\nemission that apparently contributes to the little blue bump.\n", "  Basic properties of relativistic magnetic reconnection in electron-positron\npair plasmas are investigated by using a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. We\nfirst revisit a problem by Hesse & Zenitani (2007), who examined the kinetic\nOhm's law across the X line. We formulate a relativistic Ohm's law by\ndecomposing the stress-energy tensor. Then, the role of the new term, called\nthe heat-flow inertial term, is examined in the PIC simulation data. We further\nevaluate the energy balance in the reconnection system. These analyses\ndemonstrate physically transparent ways to diagnose relativistic kinetic data.\n", "  We study the relation between quark confinement and chiral symmetry breaking\nin QCD. Using lattice QCD formalism, we analytically express the various\n\"confinement indicators\", such as the Polyakov loop, its fluctuations, the\nWilson loop, the inter-quark potential and the string tension, in terms of the\nDirac eigenmodes. In the Dirac spectral representation, there appears a power\nof the Dirac eigenvalue $\\lambda_n$ such as $\\lambda_n^{N_t-1}$, which behaves\nas a reduction factor for small $\\lambda_n$. Consequently, since this reduction\nfactor cannot be cancelled, the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes give negligibly\nsmall contribution to the confinement quantities,while they are essential for\nchiral symmetry breaking. These relations indicate no direct, one-to-one\ncorrespondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. In\nother words, there is some independence of quark confinement from chiral\nsymmetry breaking, which can generally lead to different transition\ntemperatures/densities for deconfinement and chiral restoration. We also\ninvestigate the Polyakov loop in terms of the eigenmodes of the Wilson, the\nclover and the domain-wall fermion kernels, respectively, and find the similar\nresults. The independence of quark confinement from chiral symmetry breaking\nseems to be natural, because confinement is realized independently of quark\nmasses and heavy quarks are also confined even without the chiral symmetry.\n", "  Helical magnetic structures and its responses to external magnetic fields in\nYb(Ni$_x$Cu$_{1-x}$)$_3$Al$_9$, with a chiral crystal structure of the space\ngroup $R32$, have been investigated by resonant X-ray diffraction. It is shown\nthat the crystal chirality is reflected to the helicity of the magnetic\nstructure by a one to one relationship, indicating that there exists an\nantisymmetric exchange interaction mediated via the conduction electrons. When\na magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the helical axis ($c$ axis), the\nsecond harmonic peak of $(0, 0, 2q)$ develops with increasing the field. The\nthird harmonic peak of $(0, 0, 3q)$ has also been observed for the $x$=0.06\nsample. This result provides a strong evidence for the formation of a chiral\nmagnetic soliton lattice state, a periodic array of the chiral twist of spins,\nwhich has been suggested by the characteristic magnetization curve. The helical\nordering of magnetic octupole moments, accompanying with the magnetic dipole\norder, has also been detected.\n", "  Superconductivity with exotic properties has often been discovered in\nmaterials with a layered (two-dimensional) crystal structure. The low\ndimensionality affects the electronic structure of materials, which could\nrealize a high transition temperature (Tc) and/or unconventional pairing\nmechanisms. Here, we report the superconductivity in a layered tin arsenide\nNaSn2As2. The crystal structure consists of (Sn2As2)2- bilayers, which is bound\nby van-der-Waals forces, separated by Na+ ions. Measurements of electrical\nresistivity and specific heat confirm the bulk nature of superconductivity of\nNaSn2As2 with Tc of 1.3 K. Our results propose that the SnAs layers will be a\nbasic structure providing another universality class of a layered\nsuperconducting family, and it provides a new platform for the physics and\nchemistry of low-dimensional superconductors with lone pair electrons.\n", "  The fundamental 28SiH+ ion has been characterized in a collaborative work,\nutilizing a hollow-cathode-discharge laser-spectrometer and a cryogenic ion\ntrap spectrometer. Twenty-three vibration-rotation transitions around 4.75 um\nhave been detected with high accuracy. This has facilitated the first direct\nmeasurement of the pure rotational transition J=1<-0 at 453056.3632(4) MHz in\nthe trap spectrometer. The measured and accurately predicted transitions enable\nthe search for this ion in space with IR and sub-mm telescopes.\n", "  On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the\nAdvanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A\nwas observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the\nAnticoincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and\nspatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is\n$5.0\\times 10^{-8}$. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a\nprogenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides\nnew insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short gamma-ray bursts.\nWe use the observed time delay of $(+1.74 \\pm 0.05)\\,$s between GRB 170817A and\nGW170817 to: (i) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the\nspeed of light to be between $-3\\times 10^{-15}$ and $+7\\times 10^{-16}$ times\nthe speed of light, (ii) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz\ninvariance, (iii) present a new test of the equivalence principle by\nconstraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic\nradiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz\nfactor of the region emitting the gamma rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short\nGRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less\nenergetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of\ngamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be\nessential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we\npredict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the\nAdvanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1--1.4 per year during the 2018-2019\nobserving run and 0.3--1.7 per year at design sensitivity.\n", "  We theoretically investigate an exciton-coupled electron transfer (XCET)\nprocess that is conversion of an exciton into a charge transfer state. This\nconversion happens in an exciton transfer (XT) process, and the electron moves\naway in an electron transfer(ET) process in multiple environments (baths). This\nXCET process plays an essential role in the harvesting of solar energy in\nbiological and photovoltaic materials. We develop a practical theoretical model\nto study the efficiency of XCET process that occurs either in consecutive or\nconcerted processes under the influence of non-Markovian baths. The role of\nquantum coherence in the XT-ET system and the baths is investigated using\nreduced hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM). This model includes independent\nbaths for each XT and ET state, in addition to a XCET bath for the conversion\nprocess. We found that, while quantum system-bath coherence is important in the\nXT and ET processes, coherence between the XT and ET processes must be\nsuppressed in order to realize efficient irreversible XCET process through the\nweak off-diagonal interaction between the XT and ET bridge sites arises from a\nXCET bath.\n", "  Voronoi grids have been successfully used to represent density structures of\ngas in astronomical hydrodynamics simulations. While some codes are explicitly\nbuilt around using a Voronoi grid, others, such as Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH), use particle-based representations and can benefit from\nconstructing a Voronoi grid for post-processing their output. So far,\ncalculating the density of each Voronoi cell from SPH data has been done\nnumerically, which is both slow and potentially inaccurate. This paper proposes\nan alternative analytic method, which is fast and accurate. We derive an\nexpression for the integral of a cubic spline kernel over the volume of a\nVoronoi cell and link it to the density of the cell. Mass conservation is\nensured rigorously by the procedure. The method can be applied more broadly to\nintegrate a spherically symmetric polynomial function over the volume of a\nrandom polyhedron.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger's wave function can naturally be realized as an\n'instantaneous resonant spatial mode' in which quantum particle moves and hence\nthe Born's rule is derived after identifying its origin. This realization\nfacilitates the visualization of `what's really going on?' in the Young's\ndouble-slit experiment which is known to be the central mystery of quantum\nmechanics. Also, an actual mechanism underlying the\n`spooky-action-at-a-distance', another mystery regarding the entangled quantum\nparticles, is revealed. Wheeler's delayed choice experiments, delayed choice\nquantum eraser experiment and delayed choice entanglement swapping experiments\nare unambiguously and naturally explained at a single quantum level. The\nreality of Nature represented by the quantum mechanical formalism is\nconceptually intuitive and is independent of the measurement problem.\n", "  We present optical spectroscopy of the recently discovered hyperbolic\nnear-Earth object A/2017 U1, taken on 25 Oct 2017 at Palomar Observatory.\nAlthough our data are at a very low signal-to-noise, they indicate a very red\nsurface at optical wavelengths without significant absorption features.\n", "  We show that Hurwitz numbers may be generated by certain correlation\nfunctions which appear in quantum chaos.\n", "  Natural systems are typically nonlinear and complex, and it is of great\ninterest to be able to reconstruct a system in order to understand its\nmechanism, which can not only recover nonlinear behaviors but also predict\nfuture dynamics. Due to the advances of modern technology, big data becomes\nincreasingly accessible and consequently the problem of reconstructing systems\nfrom measured data or time series plays a central role in many scientific\ndisciplines. In recent decades, nonlinear methods rooted in state space\nreconstruction have been developed, and they do not assume any model equations\nbut can recover the dynamics purely from the measured time series data. In this\nreview, the development of state space reconstruction techniques will be\nintroduced and the recent advances in systems prediction and causality\ninference using state space reconstruction will be presented. Particularly, the\ncutting-edge method to deal with short-term time series data will be focused.\nFinally, the advantages as well as the remaining problems in this field are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) provide a natural source of particles\naccelerated to energies beyond those that can be attained in the laboratory.\nUHECRs have been observed with energies exceeding $10^{20}$ eV, which is\nequivalent to 433 TeV in the center-of-momentum frame. Using this natural\nsource of particles physicists can extend the measurement of the $pp$ cross\nsection an order of magnitude above what is achievable in the lab, possibly\nidentifying hints of new physics. The proton-air cross section and other\nproperties of UHECR QCD physics are also important in their own right to the\nstudy of the sources and composition of UHECRs, but hadronic modelling at these\nenergies is still reliant upon phenomenological and the theoretical\nextrapolations based upon terrestrial accelerator data. UHECR data can be used\nto improve these extrapolations of the proton-air cross section, but large\nuncertainties remain for other hadronic model parameters. We present the most\nrecent measurement of the inelastic proton-air cross section at $\\sqrt{s} = 95$\nTeV measured by Telescope Array using high quality $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ data\ncollected in hybrid observing mode. This measurement is also used to infer the\ntotal proton-proton cross section.\n", "  Venus has no known satellites, but has four known co-orbitals: (322756) 2001\nCK32, 2002 VE68, 2012 XE133, and 2013 ND15. Here, we present numerical evidence\nsuggesting that 2015 WZ12 is a possible Venus co-orbital; it might have been\nuntil recently a transient Trojan. Follow-up observations of this target in the\nnear future will be difficult, though.\n", "  Epitaxial La doped BaSnO3 films were grown in an adsorption controlled regime\nby molecular beam epitaxy, where the excess volatile SnOx desorbs from the film\nsurface. A film grown on a (001) DyScO3 substrate exhibited a mobility of 183\ncm^2 V^-1 s^-1 at room temperature and 400 cm^2 V^-1 s^-1 at 10 K, despite the\nhigh concentration (1.2x10^11 cm^-2) of threading dislocations present. In\ncomparison to other reports, we observe a much lower concentration of (BaO)2\nRuddlesden Popper crystallographic shear faults. This suggests that in addition\nto threading dislocations that other defects possibly (BaO)2 crystallographic\nshear defects or point defects significantly reduce the electron mobility.\n", "  We present some new discoveries on the mathematical foundation of linear\nhydrodynamic stability theory. The new discoveries are: 1. Linearized Euler\nequations fail to provide a linear approximation on inviscid hydrodynamic\nstability. 2. Eigenvalue instability predicted by high Reynolds number\nlinearized Navier-Stokes equations cannot capture the dominant instability of\nsuper fast growth. 3. As equations for directional differentials, Rayleigh\nequation and Orr-Sommerfeld equation cannot capture the nature of the full\ndifferentials.\n", "  The simulation of Cherenkov light lateral distribution function (CLLDF) in\nExtensive Air Showers (EAS) was performed by using the Monte Carlo CORSIKA code\nfor configurations of Tunka-133 EAS Cherenkov array. This simulation was\ncarried out for different primary particles (e+, e-, p, O, Ar and Fe) around\nthe knee region with the energy 3.10^15 eV at different zenith angles. By\ndepending on the Breit-Wigner function a parameterization of CLLDF was\nreconstructed on the basis of this simulation as a function of the zenith\nangle. The parameterized CLLDF was verified for four fixed zenith angles in\ncomparison with the simulation that performed using CORSIKA code for each\nprimary particle.\n", "  Electron energy and angular distributions in the process of low-energy\nelastic neutrino-electron scattering are treated in the free-electron\napproximation. The effects of the millicharges, magnetic, electric, and anapole\nmoments of massive neutrinos along with the flavor change of neutrinos\ntraveling from the source to the detector are taken into account under the\nassumption of three-neutrino mixing. The footprints of neutrino electromagnetic\ninteractions in the electron energy and angle distributions are discussed.\n", "  After a brief review of the idea and main results of the original p-adic\nstring work, I describe the recent interest in p-adic strings in the context of\nAdS/CFT duality\n", "  We review the work of Tosio Kato on the mathematics of non--relativistic\nquantum mechanics and some of the research that was motivated by this.

These aspects are rarely explored jointly and at scale. By looking\nat how users generate and access pictures of varying beauty on Flickr, we\ninvestigate how the production of quality impacts the dynamics of online social\nsystems. We develop a deep learning computer vision model to score images\naccording to their aesthetic value and we validate its output through\ncrowdsourcing. By applying it to over 15B Flickr photos, we study for the first\ntime how image beauty is distributed over a large-scale social system.\nBeautiful images are evenly distributed in the network, although only a small\ncore of people get social recognition for them. To study the impact of exposure\nto quality on user engagement, we set up matching experiments aimed at\ndetecting causality from observational data. Exposure to beauty is\ndouble-edged: following people who produce high-quality content increases one's\nprobability of uploading better photos; however, an excessive imbalance between\nthe quality generated by a user and the user's neighbors leads to a decline in\nengagement. Our analysis has practical implications for improving link\nrecommender systems.\n", "  The Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment-II (NDCX-II) is an induction\nlinac that generates intense pulses of 1.2 MeV helium ions for heating matter\nto extreme conditions. Here, we present recent results on optimizing beam\ntransport. The NDCX-II beamline includes a 1-meter-long drift section\ndownstream of the last transport solenoid, which is filled with\ncharge-neutralizing plasma that enables rapid longitudinal compression of an\nintense ion beam against space-charge forces. The transport section on NDCX-II\nconsists of 28 solenoids. Finding optimal field settings for a group of\nsolenoids requires knowledge of the envelope parameters of the beam. Imaging\nthe beam on scintillator gives the radius of the beam, but the envelope angle\ndr/dz is not measured directly. We demonstrate how the parameters of the beam\nenvelope (r, dr/dz, and emittance) can be reconstructed from a series of images\ntaken at varying B-field strengths of a solenoid upstream of the scintillator.\nWe use this technique to evaluate emittance at several points in the NDCX-II\nbeamline and for optimizing the trajectory of the beam at the entry of the\nplasma-filled drift section.\n", "  The CERN IT provides a set of Hadoop clusters featuring more than 5 PBytes of\nraw storage with different open-source, user-level tools available for\nanalytical purposes. The CMS experiment started collecting a large set of\ncomputing meta-data, e.g. dataset, file access logs, since 2015. These records\nrepresent a valuable, yet scarcely investigated, set of information that needs\nto be cleaned, categorized and analyzed. CMS can use this information to\ndiscover useful patterns and enhance the overall efficiency of the distributed\ndata, improve CPU and site utilization as well as tasks completion time. Here\nwe present evaluation of Apache Spark platform for CMS needs. We discuss two\nmain use-cases CMS analytics and ML studies where efficient process billions of\nrecords stored on HDFS plays an important role. We demonstrate that both Scala\nand Python (PySpark) APIs can be successfully used to execute extremely I/O\nintensive queries and provide valuable data insight from collected meta-data.\n", "  We report on tuning the carrier capture events at a single dangling bond (DB)\nmidgap state by varying the substrate temperature, doping type, and doping\nconcentration. All-electronic time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy\n(TR-STM) is employed to directly measure the carrier capture rates on the\nnanosecond time scale. A characteristic negative differential resistance (NDR)\nfeature is evident in the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of DBs on both n and p-type doped\nsamples. It is found that a common model accounts for both observations.\nAtom-specific Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements confirm the\nenergetic position of the DB's charge transition levels, corroborating STS\nstudies. It is shown that under different tip-induced fields the DB can be\nsupplied from two distinct reservoirs: the bulk conduction band and/or the\nvalence band. We measure the filling and emptying rates of the DBs in the\nenergy regime where electrons are supplied by the bulk valence band. By adding\npoint charges in the vicinity of a DB, Coulombic interactions are shown to\nshift observed STS and NDR features.\n", "  A simple protocol based on low-weight Pauli Hamiltonians is introduced for\nperforming quantum gates that are robust to control noise. Gates are\nimplemented by an adiabatic sequence of single-qubit fields and two-qubit\ninteractions with a single ancillary qubit, whereas related techniques require\nthree-qubit interactions, perturbation gadgets, higher dimensional subsystems,\nand/or more ancilla qubits. Low-weight interactions and low qubit overhead open\na viable path to experimental investigation, while operation in a degenerate\nground space allows for physical qubit designs that are immune to energy\nrelaxation. Simulations indicate that two-qubit gate error due to control noise\ncan be as low as $10^{-5}$, for realizable coupling strengths and time-scales,\nwith low-frequency noise that is as high as 15% of the control pulse amplitude.\n", "  Bessel beams (BBs) appear immune to diffraction over finite propagation\ndistances due to the conical nature of light propagation along the optical\naxis. This offers promising advantages in laser fabrication. However, BBs\nexhibit a significant intensity variation along the direction of propagation.\nWe present a simple technique to engineer the axial intensity of the BB over\ncentimeters-long propagation distances without expansion of the incoming laser\nbeam. This method uses two diffractive optical elements (DOEs), one converts\nthe input Gaussian intensity profile to an intermediate intensity distribution,\nwhich illuminates the second DOE, a binary axicon. BBs of desired axial\nintensity distribution over few centimeters length can be fabricated.\n", "  Excitons are electron-hole (e-h) pair quasiparticles, which may form a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and collapse into the phase coherent state at\nlow temperature. However, because of ephemeral strength of pairing, a clear\nevidence for BEC in electron-hole system has not yet been observed. Here, we\nreport electron-hole pair condensation in graphene (Gr)/MoS2 heterointerface at\n10K without magnetic field. As a direct indication of e-h pair condensation, we\ndemonstrate a vanished Hall drag voltage and the resultant divergence of drag\nresistance. While strong excitons are formed at Gr/MoS2 heterointerface without\ninsulating layer, carrier recombination via interlayer tunneling of carriers is\nsuppressed by the vertical p-Gr/n-MoS2 junction barrier, consequently yielding\nhigh BEC temperature of 10K, ~1000 times higher than that of two-dimensional\nelectron gas in III-V quantum wells. The observed excitonic transport is mainly\ngoverned by the interfacial properties of the Gr/MoS2 heterostructure, rather\nthan the intrinsic properties of each layer. Our approach with available\nlarge-area monolayer graphene and MoS2 provides a high feasibility for quantum\ndissipationless electronics towards integration.\n", "  Encouraged by recent studies on the performance of tidal turbine arrays, we\nextend the classical momentum actuator disc theory to include the free surface\neffects and allow the vertical arrangement of turbines. Most existing\nliteratures concern one dimensional arrays with single turbine in the vertical\ndirection, while the arrays in this work are two dimensional (with turbines in\nboth the vertical and lateral directions) and also partially block the channel\nwhich width is far larger than height. The vertical mixing of array scale flow\nis assumed to take place much faster than lateral one. This assumption has been\nverified by numerical simulations. Fixing the total turbine area and utilized\nwidth, the comparison between two-dimensional and traditional one-dimensional\narrays is investigated. The results suggest that the two dimensional\narrangements of smaller turbines are preferred to one dimensional arrays from\nboth the power coefficient and efficiency perspectives. When channel dynamics\nare considered, the power increase would be partly offset according to the\nparameters of the channel but the optimal arrangement is unchangeable.\nFurthermore, we consider how to arrange finite number of turbines in a channel.\nIt is shown that an optimal distribution of turbines in two directions is\nfound. Finally, the scenario of arranging turbines in infinite flow, which is\nthe limiting condition of small blockages, is analysed. A new maximum power\ncoefficient 0.869 occurs when $Fr=0.2$, greatly increasing the peak power\ncompared with existing results.\n", "  The present paper is provided in response to the comment of M. R. Hadizadeh\net.al on our original paper Six-body bound system calculations in the case of\neffective Alpha-core structure [Eur. Phys. J. Plus (2016) 131: 240].In this\npaper we have presented our clarifications on their arguments about of the\naccuracy of the procedure of the calculations. In this paper our arguments turn\nout to be very efficient mainly discussed from the authors misunderstanding of\nthe issues discussed in the original paper. In fact, their comment aims to\nexaggeratedly show that our paper is poor,but our following statements\ndemonstrate that their comment is misleading and consequently unacceptable.\n", "  We calculate the shift in masses and decay constants of $D_s(1968)$ and\n$B_s(5370)$ mesons in hot and dense asymmetric strange hadronic matter using\nQCD sum rules and chiral SU(3) model. In-medium strange quark condensates\n$\\left\\langle \\bar{s}s\\right\\rangle_{\\rho_B}$, and gluon condensates\n$\\left\\langle \\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\pi} {G^a}_{\\mu\\nu} {G^a}^{\\mu\\nu}\n\\right\\rangle_{\\rho_B}$ to be used in the QCD sum rules for pseudoscalar $D_s$\nand $B_s$ mesons are calculated using chiral SU(3) model. As an application of\nour present work, we calculate the in-medium decay widths of the excited\n(c$\\bar{s}$) states $D_s^*(2715)$ and $D_s^*(2860)$ decaying to\n($D_s(1968)$,$\\eta$) mesons. The medium effects in their decay widths are\nincorporated through the mass modification of the $D_s(1968)$ and $\\eta$\nmesons. Results of the present investigation may be helpful to understand the\npossible outcomes of the future experiments like CBM and PANDA under the FAIR\nfacility.\n", "  We study the phase diagram of an elastic interaction model for spin crossover\n(SC) materials with antiferromagnetic-like short-range interactions. In this\nmodel, the interplay between the short-range interaction and the long-range\ninteraction of elastic origin causes complex phase transitions. For relatively\nweak elastic interactions, the phase diagram is characterized by tricritical\npoints, at which antiferromagnetic (AF) -like and ferromagnetic (F) -like\nspinodal lines and a critical line merge. On the other hand, for relatively\nstrong elastic interactions, unusual \"horn structures,\" which are surrounded by\nthe F-like spinodal lines, disorder (D) spinodal lines, and the critical line,\nare realized at higher temperatures. These structures are similar to those\nobtained in our previous study [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 93}, 064109 (2016)] of an\nIsing antiferromagnet with infinite-range ferromagnetic interactions, and we\nfind universal features caused by the interplay between the competing\nshort-range and long-range interactions. The long-range interaction of elastic\norigin is irrelevant (inessential) for the critical line. In contrast, the\nAF-like, F-like, and D spinodal lines result from the long-range interaction of\nelastic origin. This difference causes qualitatively different features of\ndomain formation or nucleation of the new phase: clustering occurs in the\nformer case, while clustering is absent in the latter. Based on the phase\ndiagrams, we discuss the patterns and clustering features of two-step SC\ntransitions, in which the AF-like phase is realized in the intermediate\ntemperature region.\n", "  We present measurements of the inclusive jet production at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 8 and 13 TeV, and of multijets at 8 TeV. These measurements allow\nto constrain PDFs and the strong coupling constant. Two measurements of the\nazimuthal correlations at 8 and 13 TeV are also presented, testing higher order\nQCD calculations.\n", "  By employing QCD inequalities, we discuss appearance of the pion condensate\nfor both real and imaginary isospin chemical potentials, taking also into\naccount imaginary quark chemical potential. We show that the charged pion can\ncondense for real isospin chemical potential, but not for imaginary one.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the expectation value of the neutral-pion field for\nimaginary isospin chemical potential by using framework of the twisted mass. As\na result, it is found that the expectation value becomes zero for the finite\ncurrent-quark mass, whereas the Banks-Casher relation is obtained in the\nmassless limit.\n", "  The Darboux transformation of the three-component coupled derivative\nnonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equations is constructed, based on the special vector\nsolution elaborately generated from the corresponding Lax pair, various\ninteractions of localized waves are derived. Here, we focus on the higher-order\ninteractional solutions among higher-order rogue waves (RWs), multi-soliton and\nmulti-breather. Instead of considering various arrangements among the three\ncomponents $q_1$, $q_2$ and $q_3$, we define the same combination as the same\ntype solution. Based on our method, these interactional solutions are\ncompletely classified into six types among these three components $q_1$, $q_2$\nand $q_3$. In these six types interactional solutions, there are four mixed\ninteractions of localized waves in three different components. In particular,\nthe free parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ paly an important role in dynamics\nstructures of the interactional solutions, for example, different nonlinear\nlocalized waves merge with each other by increasing the absolute values of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n", "  The top-quark mass can be determined with very high precision from a scan of\nthe total $e^+e^-\\to b\\bar{b}W^+W^-X$ cross section near the top-pair\nproduction threshold.

We discuss the size of the\nnew contributions and estimate the theory uncertainty on the top-quark mass in\nthe PS mass scheme.\n", "  The end (for human scientists) is nigh? The posit of this discourse is that\nthe majority, if not all, scientific research will eventually be undertaken by\none, or a number of, weak artificial intelligences.\n", "  There is a natural relationship between Jones polynomials and quantum\ncomputation. We use this relationship to show that the complexity of evaluating\nrelative-error approximations of Jones polynomials can be used to bound the\nclassical complexity of approximately simulating random quantum computations.\nWe prove that random quantum computations cannot be classically simulated up to\na constant total variation distance, under the assumption that (1) the\nPolynomial Hierarchy does not collapse and (2) the average-case complexity of\nrelative-error approximations of the Jones polynomial matches the worst-case\ncomplexity over a constant fraction of random links. Our results provide a\nstraightforward relationship between the approximation of Jones polynomials and\nthe complexity of random quantum computations.\n", "  We study the problem of approximating a quantum channel by one with as few\nKraus operators as possible (in the sense that, for any input state, the output\nstates of the two channels should be close to one another). Our main result is\nthat any quantum channel mapping states on some input Hilbert space\n$\\mathrm{A}$ to states on some output Hilbert space $\\mathrm{B}$ can be\ncompressed into one with order $d\\log d$ Kraus operators, where\n$d=\\max(|\\mathrm{A}|,|\\mathrm{B}|)$, hence much less than\n$|\\mathrm{A}||\\mathrm{B}|$. In the case where the channel's outputs are all\nvery mixed, this can be improved to order $d$. We discuss the optimality of\nthis result as well as some consequences.\n", "  We consider the linearized Korteweg-de-Vries equa- tions, sometimes called\nAiry equation, on general metric graphs with edge lengths bounded away from\nzero. We show that pro- perties of the induced dynamics can be obtained by\nstudying boundary operators in the corresponding boundary space indu- ced by\nthe vertices of the graph. In particular, we characterize unitary dynamics and\ncontractive dynamics. We demonstrate our results on various special graphs,\nincluding those recently treated in the literature.\n", "  In \"Shive wave machines - Wave propagation, dispersion, reflection,\nsimulation\" (arXiv:1503.02088) technical details of Shive wave machines are\ndiscussed.

We have\nanalysed the vector and axial-vector nucleon form factors ($G^{p,n}_{E,M}(Q^2)$\nand $G^{p,n}_{A}(Q^2)$) using the spin observables in the chiral constituent\nquark model ($\\chi$CQM) which has made a significant contribution to the\nunraveling of the internal structure of the nucleon in the nonperturbative\nregime. We have also presented a comprehensive analysis of the flavor\ndecomposition of the form factors ($G^{q}_{E}(Q^2)$, $G^{q}_{M}(Q^2)$ and\n$G^{q}_{A}(Q^2)$for $q=u,d,s$) within the framework of $\\chi$CQM with emphasis\non the extraction of the strangeness form factors which are fundamental to\ndetermine the spin structure and test the chiral symmetry breaking effects in\nthe nucleon. The $Q^2$ dependence of the vector and axial-vector form factors\nof the nucleon has been studied using the conventional dipole form of\nparametrization. The results are in agreement with the available experimental\ndata.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulation of a standard coarse-grained polymer\nglass model we investigate by means of the stress-fluctuation formalism the\nshear modulus $\\mu$ as a function of temperature $T$ and sampling time $\\Delta\nt$. While the ensemble-averaged modulus $\\mu(T)$ is found to decrease\ncontinuously for all $\\Delta t$ sampled, its standard deviation $\\delta \\mu(T)$\nis non-monotonous with a striking peak at the glass transition. Confirming the\neffective time-translational invariance of our systems, $\\mu(\\Delta t)$ can be\nunderstood using a weighted integral over the shear-stress relaxation modulus\n$G(t)$. While the crossover of $\\mu(T)$ gets sharper with increasing $\\Delta\nt$, the peak of $\\delta \\mu(T)$ becomes more singular. % It is thus elusive to\npredict the modulus of a single configuration at the glass transition.\n", "  Statistical distances quantifies the difference between two statistical\nconstructs. In this article, we describe reference values for a distance\nbetween samples derived from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic $D_{F,F'}$. Each\nmeasure of the $D_{F,F'}$ is a measure of difference between two samples. This\ndistance is normalized by the number of observations in each sample to yield\nthe $c'=D_{F,F'}\\sqrt{\\frac{n n'}{n+n'}}$ statistic, for which high levels\nfavor the rejection of the null hypothesis (that the samples are drawn from the\nsame distribution). One great feature of $c'$ is that it inherits the\nrobustness of $D_{F,F'}$ and is thus suitable for use in settings where the\nunderlying distributions are not known. Benchmarks are obtained by comparing\nsamples derived from standard distributions. The supplied example applications\nof the $c'$ statistic for the distinction of samples in real data enables\nfurther insights about the robustness and power of such statistical distance.\n", "  This is a comment on \"Strong Measurements Give a Better Direct Measurement of\nthe Quantum Wave Function\" which was published as PRL 116, 040502 (2016).

Subthreshold slope less than 60\nmV/dec at room temperature is obtained for both forward and reverse gate\nvoltage sweeps with a minimum value of 34.3 mV/dec at reverse gate voltage\nsweep and 53.1 mV/dec at forward gate voltage sweep at $V_{DS}$=0.5 V.\nEnhancement-mode operation with threshold voltage ~0.4 V is achieved by tuning\nthe thickness of $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ membrane.

While using an AO system in such instrument is generally\nconsidered to feed a single-mode fiber, NIRPS is following a different path by\nusing a small multi-mode fiber (more specifically called \"few-mode fiber\").\nThis choice offers an excellent trade-off by allowing to design a compact\ncryogenic spectrograph, while maintaining a high coupling efficiency under bad\nseeing conditions and for faint stars. The main drawback resides in a much more\nimportant modal-noise, a problem that has to be tackled for allowing 1m/s\nprecision radial velocity measurements. We study the impact of using an AO\nsystem to couple light into few-mode fibers. We focus on two aspects: the\ncoupling efficiency into few-mode fibers and the question of modal noise and\nscrambling. We show first that NIRPS can reach coupling >= 50% up to magnitude\nI=12, and offer a gain of 1-2 magnitudes over a single-mode solution. We\nfinally show that the best strategy to mitigate modal noise with the AO system\nis among the simplest: a continuous tip-tilt scanning of the fiber core.\n", "  The only experimental information on the parton distribution of kaons was\nobtained from the scarce kaon-induced Drell-Yan cross section data. From these\ndata, evidence for a valence $u$ quark distribution of kaon softer than that of\npion was found. We study the feasibility to extract kaon's valence quark\ndistribution via the existing kaon-induced J/psi production data. We compare\nthe NA3 data on the K- / pi- and K+ / pi+ ratios for J/psi production on a\nplatinum target with theoretical calculations based on the color-evaporation\nmodel. We show that the NA3 data on J/psi production provide an independent\nevidence for a valence $u$ quark distribution softer in kaon than in pion. The\ndata also suggest different gluon distributions for kaon and pion.\n", "  Low-lying states in nuclei are investigated using an ensemble of random\ninteractions. Both in the nuclear shell model and in the interacting boson\nmodel we find a dominance of $J^P=0^+$ ground states. It is shown that this\nfeature is not due to time reversal symmetry. In the shell model, evidence is\nfound for the occurrence of pairing properties, and in the interacting boson\nmodel for both vibrational and rotational band structures. Our results suggest\nthat these features represent general and robust properties of the model space,\nand do not depend on details of the interactions.\n", "  The anharmonic vibrator and rotor regions in nuclei are investigated in the\nframework of the interacting boson model using an ensemble of random one- and\ntwo-body interactions.

These reactions provide a direct test of the\n`fermionic' sector, i.e. of the operators that change a boson into a fermion or\nvice versa. We present some theoretical predictions for the supersymmetric\nquartet of nuclei: 194Pt, 195Pt, 195Au and 196Au.\n", "  We consider an algebraic treatment of a three-body system. In particular, we\ndevelop the formalism for a system of three identical objects and discuss an\napplication to nonstrange baryon resonances which are interpreted as\nvibrational and rotational excitations of an oblate symmetric top. We derive\nclosed expressions for a set of elementary form factors that appear in the\ncalculation of both electromagnetic, strong and weak couplings of baryons.\n", "  We discuss recent calculations of electromagnetic form factors and strong\ndecay widths of nucleon and delta resonances. The calculations are done in a\ncollective constituent model of the nucleon, in which the baryons are\ninterpreted as rotations and vibrations of an oblate top.\n", "  We reanalyze the world data on the electromagnetic form factors of the\nnucleon. The calculations are performed in the framework of an algebraic model\nof the nucleon combined with vector meson dominance.\n", "  Nucleon elastic and transition form factors are analyzed in the framework of\na collective model of baryons. Effects of meson cloud couplings and\nrelativistic corrections are considered.\n", "  We discuss recent calculations of the mass spectrum, electromagnetic and\nstrong couplings of baryon resonances. The calculations are done in a\ncollective constituent model for the nucleon, in which the resonances are\ninterpreted as rotations and vibrations of a symmetric top with a prescribed\ndistribution of the charge and magnetization. We analyze recent data on\neta-photo- and eta-electroproduction, and the tensor analyzing power in\ndeuteron scattering.\n", "  The stretching and bending vibrations of methane are studied in the framework\nof a symmetry-adapted algebraic model. The model is based on the realization of\nthe one-dimensional Morse potential in terms of a $U(2)$ algebra. For the 44\nobserved energies we obtain a fit with a r.m.s. deviation of 1.16 cm$^{-1}$\nwhich is an order of magnitude more accurate than previous algebraic\ncalculations.\n"]}
