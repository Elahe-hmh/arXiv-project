We\nobserve that the irreducible spinor representation of the Lorentz group Spin(6)\nrequires us to consider the vector spaces of two-forms and four-forms on an\nequal footing. The doubling of the two-form vector space due to the Hodge\nduality doubles the variety of six-dimensional spin manifolds. We explore how\nthe doubling is related to the mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Via the\ngauge theory formulation of six-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, we show that\nthe curvature tensor of a Calabi-Yau manifold satisfies the Hermitian\nYang-Mills equations on the Calabi-Yau manifold. Therefore the mirror symmetry\nof Calabi-Yau manifolds can be recast as the mirror pair of Hermitian\nYang-Mills instantons. We discuss the mirror symmetry from the gauge theory\nperspective.\n", "  ``The Strength of Weak Ties\" argument (Granovetter 1973) says that the most\nvaluable information is best collected through bridging ties with other social\ncircles than one's own, and that those ties tend to be weak. Aral and Van\nAlstyne (2011) added that to access complex information, actors need strong\nties (``high bandwidth\") instead. These insights I integrate and generalize by\npointing at actors' benefits and costs. Weak ties are well-suited for\nrelatively simple information at low costs, whereas for complex information,\nthe best outcomes are expected for those actors who vary their bandwidths along\nwith the value of information accessed. To support my claim I use all patents\nin the USA (two million) over the period 1975---1999.\n", "  In this paper the effect of a small dissipation on waves is included to find\nexact solutions to the modified BBM equation. Using Lyapunov functions and\ndynamical systems theory, we prove that when viscosity is added to the BBM\nequation, in certain regions there still exist bounded traveling wave solutions\nin the form of solitary waves, periodic, and elliptic functions. By using the\ncanonical form of Abel equation, the polynomial Appell invariant make the\nequation integrable in terms of Weierstrass $\\wp$ functions. We will use a\ngeneral formalism based on Ince's transformation to write the general solution\nof dissipative BBM in terms of $\\wp$ functions, from which all the other known\nsolutions can be obtained via simplifying assumptions. Using ODE analysis we\nshow that the traveling wave speed is a bifurcation parameter that makes\ntransition between different classes of waves.\n", "  Modeling the immune system so that its essential functionalities stand out\nwithout the need for every molecular or cellular interaction to be taken into\naccount has been challenging for many decades. Two competing approaches have\nbeen the clonal selection theory and the idiotypic-network theory, each\nstemming from a relatively separate set of principles. One recent perspective\nholding the promise of unification is that of immunity as computation, that is,\nof immunity as the process of computing the state of the body so that\nprotection can be effected, as well as boosted through learning. Here we\ninvestigate the use of cellular automata (CA) as the core abstraction\nsupporting this new perspective. Our choice of CA for this role is based on the\npotential variety of basins in a CA attractor field. Associating each basin\nwith a consistent set of body states, and moreover providing for the noisy\nevolution of the CA in time so that jumping between basins is possible, have\nprovided the necessary backdrop. Given a CA rule to be followed by all cells\nsynchronously, our model is based on a probability with which each cell, at\neach time step, independently updates its own state differently than the rule\nmandates. Setting up and solving the corresponding Markov chain for its\nstationary probabilities have revealed that already in the context of\nelementary CA there exist rules that, while allowing transitions between\nbasins, display remarkable resiliency in terms of basin occupation. For these\nrules, the long-run probability that the CA is found in a given basin is\npractically the same as in the deterministic case when the initial CA state is\nchosen uniformly at random. We argue that, consequently, our single-parameter\nCA model may be a suitable abstraction of immunity as computation.\n", "  In this paper piezoconductivity phenomenon in MOSFET channel is discussed and\nextension of drain current model with possibility of stress consideration is\nproposed. Analysis of obtained model combined with examination of stress\ncomponents inherent in the MOSFET channel as well as distributions of specific\npiezoconductance coefficients on a plane of channel can show which directions\nof transistor channel are desirable for improvement of MOSFET performances.\nThis model gives possibility to predict optimal transistor channel orientation,\nfor the given stress state in MOSFET channel. Possible simplification of this\nmodel is considered. In particular, stress state and significant\npiezoconductance coefficient distributions on planes {100}, {110} as well as\n{111} are analyzed. For assumed particular cases of stress state in the\nchannel, final models of MOSFT for considered specific planes are given.\n", "  Social life clusters into groups held together by ties that also transmit\ninformation. When collective problems occur, group members use their ties to\ndiscuss what to do and to establish an agreement, to be reached quick enough to\nprevent discounting the value of the group decision. The speed at which a group\nreaches consensus can be predicted by the algebraic connectivity of the\nnetwork, which also imposes a lower bound on the group's cohesion. This\nspecific measure of connectivity is put to the test by re-using experimental\ndata, which confirm the prediction.\n", "  We demonstrate the excitation of ions to the Rydberg state $22F$ by vacuum\nultraviolet radiation at a wavelength of $123\\,\\text{nm}$ combined with the\ncoherent manipulation of the optical qubit transition in $^{40}\\text{Ca}^+$.\nWith a tightly focused beam at $729\\,\\text{nm}$ wavelength we coherently excite\na single ion from a linear string into the metastable $3D_{5/2}$ state before a\nVUV pulse excites it to the Rydberg state. In combination with ion shuttling in\nthe trap, we extend this approach to the addressed excitation of multiple ions.\nThe coherent initialization as well as the addressed Rydberg excitation are key\nprerequisites for more complex applications of Rydberg ions in quantum\nsimulation or quantum information processing.\n", "  In order to account for the observed cosmic acceleration, a modification of\nthe ansatz for the variation of density in Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\nmodels given by Islam is proposed. The modified ansatz leads to an equation of\nstate which corresponds to that of a variable Chaplygin gas, which in the\ncourse of evolution reduces to that of a modified generalized Chaplygin gas\n(MGCG) and a Chaplygin gas (CG), exhibiting late-time acceleration.\n", "  Metasurfaces, with intrinsically planar nature and subwavelength thickness,\nprovide us unconventional methodologies to not only mold the flow of\npropagating waves but also manipulate near-field waves. Plasmonic metasurfaces\nwith topological transition for controlling surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)\nrecently have been experimentally demonstrated, which, however, are limited to\noptical frequencies. In this work, we proposed and experimentally characterized\nan ultrathin metasurface with the topological transition for manipulating spoof\nSPPs at low frequency. We demonstrated rich interesting phenomena based on this\nmetasurface, including frequency-dependent spatial localization,\nnon-diffraction propagation, negative refraction, and dispersion-dependent\nspin-momentum locking of spoof SPPs. Comparing with traditional\nthree-dimensional metamaterials, our metasurface exhibits low propagation loss\nand compatibility with the photonic integrated circuit, which may find plenty\nof applications in spatial multiplexers, focusing and imaging devices, planar\nhyperlens, and dispersion-dependent directional couplers, in microwave and\nterahertz frequencies.\n", "  We study the problem of site recurrence of discrete time nearest neighbor\nopen quantum random walks (OQWs) on the integer line, proving basic properties\nand some of its relations with the corresponding problem for unitary (coined)\nquantum walks (UQWs). For both kinds of walks our discussion concerns two\nnotions of recurrence, one given by a monitoring procedure, another in terms of\nP\\'olya numbers, and we study their similarities and differences. In\nparticular, by considering UQWs and OQWs induced by the same pair of matrices,\nwe discuss the fact that recurrence of these walks are related by an additive\ninterference term in a simple way. Based on a previous result of positive\nrecurrence we describe an open quantum version of Kac's lemma for the expected\nreturn time to a site.\n", "  We present a hydrodynamic model for a thin spherical shell of active nematic\nliquid crystal with an arbitrary configuration of defects. The active flows\ngenerated by defects in the director lead to the formation of stable vortices,\nanalogous to those seen in confined systems in flat geometries, which generate\nan effective dynamics for four +1/2 defects that reproduces the tetrahedral to\nplanar oscillations observed in experiments. As the activity is increased and\nthe vortices become stronger, the defects are drawn more tightly into pairs,\nrotating about antipodal points. We extend this situation to also describe the\ndynamics of other configurations of defects. For example, two +1 defects are\nfound to attract or repel according to the local geometric character of the\ndirector field around them, while additional pairs of opposite charge defects\ncan give rise to flow states containing more than two vortices. Finally, we\ndescribe the generic relationship between defects in the orientation and\nsingular points of the flow, and suggest implications for the three-dimensional\nnature of the flow and deformation in the shape of the shell.\n", "  An optical translational projector (OTP) designed by transformation optics is\napplied to improve the energy transfer efficiency in a wireless energy transfer\n(WET) system. Numerical simulation results show our OTP can greatly enhance the\nenergy transfer efficiency (e.g. nearly 2 orders, compared to the case without\nour OTP) in WET systems, which is much larger than previous methods (e.g.\nmagnetic super-lens). A 3D reduced OTP composed by layered isotropic magnetic\nmaterials is designed, whose performance has been verified by 3D numerical\nsimulations in 10MHz. We also study the influence of loss of metamaterials on\nthe performance of proposed OTP.\n", "  Jizba-Arimitsu entropy (also called hybrid entropy) combines axiomatics of\nR\\'enyi and Tsallis entropy. It has many common properties with them, on the\nother hand, some aspects as e.g., MaxEnt distributions, are completely\ndifferent from the former two entropies. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nstatistical properties of hybrid entropy, including the definition of hybrid\nentropy for continuous distributions, its relation to discrete entropy and\ncalculation of hybrid entropy for some well-known distributions. Additionally,\ndefinition of hybrid divergence and its connection to Fisher metric is also\ndiscussed. Interestingly, the main properties of continuous hybrid entropy and\nhybrid divergence are completely different from measures based on R\\'enyi and\nTsallis entropy. This motivates us to introduce average hybrid entropy, which\ncan be understood as an average between Tsallis and R\\'enyi entropy.\n", "  We propose a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics with three parameters.\nBorn-Infeld electrodynamics and exponential electrodynamics are particular\ncases of this model. The phenomenon of vacuum birefringence is studied. We show\nthat there is not singularity of the electric field at the origin of point-like\ncharged particles. The corrections to Coulomb's law at $r\\rightarrow\\infty$ are\nobtained. We calculate the total electrostatic energy of charges for different\nparameters of the model which is finite.\n", "  The laws of quantum mechanics allow for the distribution of a secret random\nkey between two parties. Here we analyse the security of a protocol for\nestablishing a common secret key between N parties (i.e. a conference key),\nusing resource states with genuine N-partite entanglement. We compare this\nprotocol to conference key distribution via bipartite entanglement, regarding\nthe required resources, achievable secret key rates and threshold qubit error\nrates. Furthermore we discuss quantum networks with bottlenecks for which our\nmultipartite entanglement-based protocol can benefit from network coding, while\nthe bipartite protocol cannot. It is shown how this advantage leads to a higher\nsecret key rate.\n", "  The use of a Kerr nonlinearity to generate squeezed light is a well-known way\nto surpass the quantum noise limit along a given field quadrature.\nNevertheless, in the most common regime of weak nonlinearity, a single Kerr\nresonator is unable to provide the proper interrelation between the field\namplitude and squeezing required to induce a sizable deviation from Poissonian\nstatistics. We demonstrate experimentally that weakly coupled bosonic modes\nallow exploration of the interplay between squeezing and displacement, which\ncan give rise to strong deviations from the Poissonian statistics. In\nparticular, we report on the periodic bunching in a Josephson junction formed\nby two coupled exciton-polariton modes. Quantum modeling traces the bunching\nback to the presence of quadrature squeezing. Our results, linking the light\nstatistics to squeezing, are a precursor to the study of nonclassical features\nin semiconductor microcavities and other weakly nonlinear bosonic systems.\n", "  We investigate the time evolution of the Kondo resonance in response to a\nquench by applying the time-dependent numerical renormalization group (TDNRG)\napproach to the Anderson impurity model in the strong correlation limit. For\nthis purpose, we derive within TDNRG a numerically tractable expression for the\nretarded two-time nonequilibrium Green function $G(t+t',t)$, and its associated\ntime-dependent spectral function, $A(\\omega,t)$, for times $t$ both before and\nafter the quench. Quenches from both mixed valence and Kondo correlated initial\nstates to Kondo correlated final states are considered. For both cases, we find\nthat the Kondo resonance in the zero temperature spectral function, a preformed\nversion of which is evident at very short times $t\\to 0^{+}$, only fully\ndevelops at very long times $t\\gtrsim 1/T_{\\rm K}$, where $T_{\\rm K}$ is the\nKondo temperature of the final state. In contrast, the final state satellite\npeaks develop on a fast time scale $1/\\Gamma$ during the time interval\n$-1/\\Gamma \\lesssim t \\lesssim +1/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the hybridization\nstrength. Initial and final state spectral functions are recovered in the\nlimits $t\\rightarrow -\\infty$ and $t\\rightarrow +\\infty$, respectively. Our\nformulation of two-time nonequilibrium Green functions within TDNRG provides a\nfirst step towards using this method as an impurity solver within\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory.\n", "  In this work we consider open quantum random walks on the non-negative\nintegers. By considering orthogonal matrix polynomials we are able to describe\ntransition probability expressions for classes of walks via a matrix version of\nthe Karlin-McGregor formula. We focus on absorbing boundary conditions and, for\nsimpler classes of examples, we consider path counting and the corresponding\ncombinatorial tools. A non-commutative version of the gambler's ruin is studied\nby obtaining the probability of reaching a certain fortune and the mean time to\nreach a fortune or ruin in terms of generating functions. In the case of the\nHadamard coin, a counting technique for boundary restricted paths in a lattice\nis also presented. We discuss an open quantum version of Foster's Theorem for\nthe expected return time together with applications.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the construction of numerical schemes for nonlinear\nFokker-Planck equations that preserve the structural properties, like non\nnegativity of the solution, entropy dissipation and large time behavior. The\nmethods here developed are second order accurate, they do not require any\nrestriction on the mesh size and are capable to capture the asymptotic steady\nstates with arbitrary accuracy. These properties are essential for a correct\ndescription of the underlying physical problem. Applications of the schemes to\nseveral nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with nonlocal terms describing\nemerging collective behavior in socio-economic and life sciences are presented.\n", "  We have demonstrated that depletion/enhancement-mode b-Ga2O3 on insulator\nfield-effect transistors can achieve a record high drain current density of\n1.5/1.0 A/mm by utilizing a highly doped b-Ga2O3 nano-membrane as the channel.\nb-Ga2O3 on insulator field-effect transistor (GOOI FET) shows a high on/off\nratio of 1010 and low subthreshold slope of 150 mV/dec even with 300 nm thick\nSiO2. The enhancement-mode GOOI FET is achieved through surface depletion. An\nultra-fast, high resolution thermo-reflectance imaging technique is applied to\nstudy the self-heating effect by directly measuring the local surface\ntemperature. High drain current, low Rc, and wide bandgap make the b-Ga2O3 on\ninsulator field-effect transistor a promising candidate for future power\nelectronics applications.\n", "  Our everyday experience teaches us that the structure of a medium strongly\ninfluences how light propagates through it. A disordered medium, e.g., appears\ntransparent or opaque, depending on whether its structure features a mean free\npath that is larger or smaller than the medium thickness. While the\nmicrostructure of the medium uniquely determines the shape of all penetrating\nlight paths, recent theoretical insights indicate that the mean length of these\npaths is entirely independent of any structural medium property and thus also\ninvariant with respect to a change in the mean free path. Here, we report an\nexperiment that demonstrates this surprising property explicitly. Using\ncolloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, we establish\nan invariance of the mean path length spanning nearly two orders of magnitude\nin scattering strength, from almost transparent to very opaque media. This very\ngeneral, fundamental and counterintuitive result can be extended to a wide\nrange of systems, however ordered, correlated or disordered, and has important\nconsequences for many fields, including light trapping and harvesting for solar\ncells and more generally in photonic structure design.\n", "  We clarify that a result recently stated by Kaiser is contained in a theorem\nof Buchert and Ehlers that is widely known for its main result: that there is\nno global kinematical backreaction in Newtonian cosmology. Kaiser cites this\npaper, re-derives parts of the theorem, but incompletely restates its content.\nHe makes further claims, which cannot be proven beyond the limited context of\nNewtonian cosmology. We also discuss recent papers of R\\'acz et al. and Roukema\nwho claim the existence of global backreaction within the Newtonian framework.\n", "  We introduce Jack (unitary) characters and prove two kinds of formulas that\nare suitable for their asymptotics, as the lengths of the signatures that\nparametrize them go to infinity. The first kind includes several integral\nrepresentations for Jack characters of one variable. The second identity we\nprove is the Pieri integral formula for Jack characters which, in a sense, is\ndual to the well known Pieri rule for Jack polynomials. The Pieri integral\nformula can also be seen as a functional equation for irreducible spherical\nfunctions of virtual Gelfand pairs.\n  As an application of our formulas, we study the asymptotics of Jack\ncharacters as the corresponding signatures grow to infinity in the sense of\nVershik-Kerov. We prove the existence of a small $\\delta > 0$ such that the\nJack characters of $m$ variables have a uniform limit on the\n$\\delta$-neighborhood of the $m$-dimensional torus. Our result specializes to a\ntheorem of Okounkov and Olshanski.\n", "  Determining how scientific achievements influence the subsequent process of\nknowledge creation is a fundamental step in order to build a unified ecosystem\nfor studying the dynamics of innovation and competitiveness. Relying separately\non data about scientific production on one side, through bibliometric\nindicators, and about technological advancements on the other side, through\npatents statistics, gives only a limited insight on the key interplay between\nscience and technology which, as a matter of fact, move forward together within\nthe innovation space. In this paper, using citation data of both research\npapers and patents, we quantify the direct influence of the scientific outputs\nof nations on further advancements in science and on the introduction of new\ntechnologies. Our analysis highlights the presence of geo-cultural clusters of\nnations with similar innovation system features, and unveils the heterogeneous\ncoupled dynamics of scientific and technological advancements. This study\nrepresents a step forward in the buildup of an inclusive framework for\nknowledge creation and innovation.\n", "  The paper introduces nonadditivity parameter transformation group induced by\nTsallis entropy. We discuss simple physical applications of a system in the\ncontact with finite heat bath or with temperature fluctuations. With help of\nthe transformation, it is possible to introduce generalized distributive rule\nin q-deformed algebra. We focus on MaxEnt distributions of Tsallis entropy with\nrescaled nonadditivity parameter under escort energy constraints. We show that\neach group element corresponds to one class of q-deformed distributions.\nFinally, we briefly discuss the application of the transformation to\nJizba-Arimitsu Hybrid entropy and its connection to Average Hybrid entropy.\n", "  A measurement is presented of the triple-differential dijet cross section at\na centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV using 19.7 inverse femtobarns of data\ncollected with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The\ncross section is measured as a function of the average transverse momentum,\nhalf the rapidity separation, and the boost of the two leading jets in the\nevent. The cross section is corrected for detector effects and compared to\ncalculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order\naccuracy, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections. New\nconstraints on parton distribution functions are obtained and the inferred\nvalue of the strong coupling constant is alpha[S](M[Z]) = 0.1199 +/- 0.0015\n(exp) -0.0020 +0.0031 (theo), where M[Z] is the mass of the Z boson.\n", "  We implement the coupled cluster method to very high orders of approximation\nto study the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$ Heisenberg model on a\ncross-striped square lattice. Every nearest-neighbour pair of sites on the\nsquare lattice has an isotropic antiferromagnetic exchange bond of strength\n$J_{1}>0$, while the basic square plaquettes in alternate columns have either\nboth or neither next-nearest-neighbour (diagonal) pairs of sites connected by\nan equivalent frustrating bond of strength $J_{2} \\equiv \\alpha J_{1} > 0$. By\nstudying the magnetic order parameter (i.e., the average local on-site\nmagnetization) in the range $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$ of the frustration parameter\nwe find that the quasiclassical antiferromagnetic N\\'{e}el and (so-called)\ndouble N\\'{e}el states form the stable ground-state phases in the respective\nregions $\\alpha < \\alpha_{1a}^{c} = 0.46(1)$ and $\\alpha > \\alpha_{1b}^{c} =\n0.615(5)$. The double N\\'{e}el state has N\\'{e}el\n($\\cdots\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\cdots$) ordering along the\n(column) direction parallel to the stripes of squares with both or no $J_{2}$\nbonds, and spins alternating in a pairwise\n($\\cdots\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\cdots$)\nfashion along the perpendicular (row) direction, so that the parallel pairs\noccur on squares with both $J_{2}$ bonds present. Further explicit calculations\nof both the triplet spin gap and the zero-field uniform transverse magnetic\nsusceptibility provide compelling evidence that the ground-state phase over all\nor most of the intermediate regime $\\alpha_{1a}^{c} < \\alpha < \\alpha_{1b}^{c}$\nis a gapped state with no discernible long-range magnetic order.\n", "  Wavelength determines the length scale of the cross section when\nelectromagnetic waves are scattered by an electrically small object. The cross\nsection diverges for resonant scattering, and diminishes for non-resonant\nscattering, when wavelength approaches infinity. This scattering law explains\nthe color of the sky as well as the strength of a mobile phone signal. We show\nthat such wavelength scaling comes from free space's conical dispersion at zero\nfrequency. Emerging Weyl systems, offering similar dispersion at non-zero\nfrequencies, lead to new laws of electromagnetic scattering that allow cross\nsections to be decoupled from the wavelength limit. Diverging and diminishing\ncross sections can be realized at any target wavelength in a Weyl system,\nproviding unprecedented ability to tailor the strength of wave-matter\ninteractions for radio-frequency and optical applications.\n", "  It is shown how exactly solved edge interaction models on the square lattice,\nmay be extended onto more general planar graphs, with edges connecting a subset\nof next nearest neighbour vertices of $\\mathbb{Z}^3$. This is done by using\nlocal deformations of the square lattice, that arise through the use of the\nstar-triangle relation. Similar to Baxter's Z-invariance property, these local\ndeformations leave the partition function invariant up to some simple factors\ncoming from the star-triangle relation. The deformations used here extend the\nusual formulation of Z-invariance, by requiring the introduction of oriented\nrapidity lines which form directed closed paths in the rapidity graph of the\nmodel. The quasi-classical limit is also considered, in which case the\ndeformations imply a classical Z-invariance property, as well as a related\nlocal closure relation, for the action functional of a system of classical\ndiscrete Laplace equations.\n", "  At first, considering the Einstein framework, we introduce some new static\ntraversable wormholes, and study the effects of a dark energy-like source on\nthem. Thereinafter, a brief review on Einstein field equations in Lyra manifold\nis presented, and we address some static traversable wormholes in the Lyra\nmanifold which satisfy the energy-conditions. It is also shown that solutions\nintroduced in the Einstein framework may also meet the energy conditions in the\nLyra manifold. Finally, we focus on vacuum Lyra manifold and find some\ntraversable asymptotically flat wormholes. In summary, our study shows that it\nis theoretically possible to find a Lyra displacement vector field in a manner\nin which traversable wormholes satisfy the energy conditions in a Lyra\nmanifold.\n", "  Undesired wave reflections, which occur at domain boundaries in flow\nsimulations with free-surface waves, can be minimized by applying source terms\nin the vicinity of the boundary to damp the waves. Examples of such approaches\nare absorbing layers, damping zones, forcing zones, relaxation zones and sponge\nlayers. A problem with these approaches is that the effectivity of the wave\ndamping depends on the parameters in the source term functions, which are\ncase-dependent and must be adjusted to the wave. The present paper presents a\ntheory which analytically predicts the reflection coefficients and which can be\nused to optimally select the source term parameters before running the\nsimulation. The theory is given in a general form so that it is applicable to\nmany existing implementations. It is validated against results from\nfinite-volume-based flow simulations of regular free-surface waves and found to\nbe of satisfactory accuracy for practical purposes.\n", "  We propose a new fractional derivative, the Hilfer-Katugampola fractional\nderivative. Motivated by the Hilfer derivative this formulation interpolates\nthe well-known fractional derivatives of Hilfer, Hilfer-Hadamard,\nRiemann-Liouville, Hadamard, Caputo, Caputo-Hadamard, Liouville, Weyl,\ngeneralized and Caputo-type. As an application, we consider a nonlinear\nfractional differential equation with an initial condition using this new\nformulation. We show that this equation is equivalent to a Volterra integral\nequation and demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of solution to the\nnonlinear initial value problem.\n", "  The effect of massive neutrinos on the growth of cold dark matter\nperturbations acts as a scale-dependent Newton's constant and leads to\nscale-dependent growth factors just as we often find in models of gravity\nbeyond General Relativity. We show how to compute growth factors for\n$\\Lambda$CDM and general modified gravity cosmologies combined with massive\nneutrinos in Lagrangian perturbation theory for use in COLA and extensions\nthereof. We implement this together with the grid-based massive neutrino method\nof Brandbyge and Hannestad in $\\texttt{MG-PICOLA}$ and compare COLA simulations\nto full $\\it N$-body simulations of $\\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity with\nmassive neutrinos. Our implementation is computationally cheap if the\nunderlying cosmology already has scale-dependent growth factors and it is shown\nto be able to produce results that match $\\it N$-body to percent level accuracy\nfor both the total and CDM matter power-spectra up to $k\\lesssim 1 h/$Mpc.\n", "  We describe a new analytical model for the accretion of particles from a\nrotating and charged spherical shell of dilute collisionless plasma onto a\nrotating and charged black hole. By assuming a continuous injection of\nparticles at the spherical shell and by treating the black hole and a\nfeatureless accretion disc located in the equatorial plane as passive sinks of\nparticles we build a stationary accretion model. This may then serve as a toy\nmodel for plasma feeding an accretion disc around a charged and rotating black\nhole. Therefore, our new model is a direct generalization of the analytical\naccretion model introduced by E. Tejeda, P. A. Taylor, and J. C. Miller (2013).\nWe use our generalized model to analyze the influence of a net charge of the\nblack hole, which will in general be very small, on the accretion of plasma.\nWithin the assumptions of our model we demonstrate that already a vanishingly\nsmall charge of the black hole may in general still have a non-negligible\neffect on the motion of the plasma, as long as the electromagnetic field of the\nplasma is still negligible. Furthermore, we argue that the inner and outer\nedges of the forming accretion disc strongly depend on the charge of the\naccreted plasma. The resulting possible configurations of accretion discs are\nanalyzed in detail.\n", "  We demonstrate that the tentative detection of a few antihelium events with\nthe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on board the International Space Station\ncan, in principle, be ascribed to the annihilation or decay of Galactic dark\nmatter, when accounting for uncertainties in the coalescence process leading to\nthe formation of antinuclei. We show that the predicted antiproton rate,\nassuming the antihelium events came from dark matter, is marginally consistent\nwith AMS data, as is the antideuteron rate with current available constraints.\nWe argue that a dark matter origin can be tested with better constraints on the\ncoalescence process, better control of misidentified events, and with future\nantideuteron data.\n", "  For the last few decades, researchers have been intrigued by multipolar\nordering phenomena while looking for the related quantum criticality in the\nheavy-fermion Kondo system Ce$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$B$_6$. However, critical phenomena\ninduced by substitution level ($x$), temperature ($T$), and magnetic field\n($B$) are poorly understood despite a large collection of experimental results\nis available. In this work, we present $T$-$B$, $x$-$T$, and $x$-$B$ phase\ndiagrams of Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$ ($\\mathbf{B}\\parallel[110]$). These are\ncompleted by analyzing heat capacity, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), and elastic\nneutron scattering. A drastic increase of the Sommerfeld coefficient\n$\\gamma_0$, which is estimated from the heat capacity down to 0.05 K, is\nobserved with increasing $x$. The precise $T$-$B$ phase diagram which includes\nan unforeseen high-entropy region is drawn by analyzing the MCE for the first\ntime in Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$. The $x$-$B$ phase diagram, which supports the\nexistence of a QCP at $x>0.75$, is obtained by the same analysis. A detailed\ninterpretation of phase diagrams strongly indicates positive correlation\nbetween the fluctuating multipoles and the effective electron mass.\n", "  We implement and benchmark parallel I/O methods for the fully-manycore driven\nparticle-in-cell code PIConGPU. Identifying throughput and overall I/O size as\na major challenge for applications on today's and future HPC systems, we\npresent a scaling law characterizing performance bottlenecks in\nstate-of-the-art approaches for data reduction. Consequently, we propose,\nimplement and verify multi-threaded data-transformations for the I/O library\nADIOS as a feasible way to trade underutilized host-side compute potential on\nheterogeneous systems for reduced I/O latency.\n", "  Asteroseismological determinations of stellar ages have shown that old\nmain-sequence dwarfs do not obey gyrochronology. Their rotation is slow\ncompared to young stars but faster than gyrochronology predicts. This can be\nexplained by the presence of a maximum rotation period beyond which the\nlarge-scale dynamo switches off and stops providing global magnetic fields\nnecessary for stellar spindown. Assuming this explanation, the excess of\nstellar dynamo parameters over their marginal values can be estimated for given\nspectral type and rotation rate. The estimation gives the dynamo number for the\nSun about 10% above its critical value. The corresponding dynamo model provides\n- though with some further tuning - reasonable results for the Sun. Following\nthe same approach, the differential rotation and marginal dynamo modes are\ncomputed for stars between 0.7 and 1.2 solar masses. With increasing stellar\nmass, the differential rotation and the ratio of toroidal-to-poloidal field are\npredicted to increase while the field topology changes from dipolar to mixed\nquadrupolar-dipolar parity.\n", "  To implement fault-tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables,\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits have been recognized as an important\ntechnological element. However, the analog outcome of GKP qubits, which\nincludes beneficial information to improve the error tolerance, has been\nwasted, because the GKP qubits have been treated as only discrete variables. In\nthis paper, we propose a hybrid quantum error correction approach that combines\ndigital information with the analog information of the GKP qubits using the\nmaximum-likelihood method. As an example, we demonstrate that the three-qubit\nbit-flip code can correct double errors, whereas the conventional method based\non majority voting on the binary measurement outcome can correct only a single\nerror. As another example, a concatenated code known as Knill's C4/C6 code can\nachieve the hashing bound for the quantum capacity of the Gaussian quantum\nchannel. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first attempt to\ndraw both digital and analog information from a single quantum state to improve\nquantum error correction performance.\n", "  We consider a hydrodynamic description of transport for generic two\ndimensional electron systems that lack Galilean invariance and do not fall into\nthe category of Fermi liquids. We study magnetoresistance and show that it is\ngoverned only by the electronic viscosity provided that the wavelength of the\nunderlying disorder potential is large compared to the microscopic\nequilibration length. We also derive the Coulomb drag transresistance for\ndouble-layer non-Fermi liquid systems in the hydrodynamic regime. As an\nexample, we consider frictional drag between two quantum Hall states with\nhalf-filled lowest Landau levels, each described by a Fermi surface of\ncomposite fermions coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. We contrast our results to\nprior calculations of drag of Chern-Simons composite particles and place our\nfindings in the context of available experimental data.\n", "  The structural properties of LaRu$_2$P$_2$ under external pressure have been\nstudied up to 14 GPa, employing high-energy x-ray diffraction in a\ndiamond-anvil pressure cell. At ambient conditions, LaRu$_2$P$_2$ (I4/mmm) has\na tetragonal structure with a bulk modulus of $B=105(2)$ GPa and exhibits\nsuperconductivity at $T_c= 4.1$ K. With the application of pressure,\nLaRu$_2$P$_2$ undergoes a phase transition to a collapsed tetragonal (cT) state\nwith a bulk modulus of $B=175(5)$ GPa. At the transition, the c-lattice\nparameter exhibits a sharp decrease with a concurrent increase of the a-lattice\nparameter. The cT phase transition in LaRu$_2$P$_2$ is consistent with a second\norder transition, and was found to be temperature dependent, increasing from\n$P=3.9(3)$ GPa at 160 K to $P=4.6(3)$ GPa at 300 K. In total, our data are\nconsistent with the cT transition being near, but slightly above 2 GPa at 5 K.\nFinally, we compare the effect of physical and chemical pressure in the\nRRu$_2$P$_2$ (R = Y, La-Er, Yb) isostructural series of compounds and find them\nto be analogous.\n", "  In the paper we present results for final state emissions of lepton pairs in\ndecays of heavy intermediate states such as Z boson. Short presentations of\nPHOTOS and SANC algorithms and physics assumptions are given. Numerical\ndistributions of relevance for LHC observables are shown. They are used in\ndiscussions of systematic errors in the predictions of pair emissions as\nimplemented in the two programs. Suggestions for the future works are given.\nPresent results confirm, that for the precision of 0.3% level, in simulation of\nfinal state the pair emissions can be avoided. For the precision of 0.1-0.2%,\nthe results obtained with the presented programs should be enough. To cross\nprecision tag of 0.1%, the further work is however required.\n", "  The question of what gravitational theory could supersede General Relativity\nhas been central in theoretical physics for decades. Many disparate\nalternatives have been proposed motivated by cosmology, quantum gravity and\nphenomenological angles, and have been subjected to tests derived from\ncosmological, solar system and pulsar observations typically restricted to\nlinearized regimes. Gravitational waves from compact binaries provide new\nopportunities to probe these theories in the strongly gravitating/highly\ndynamical regimes. To this end however, a reliable understanding of the\ndynamics in such a regime is required. Unfortunately, most of these theories\nfail to define well posed initial value problems, which prevents at face value\nfrom meeting such challenge. In this work, we introduce a consistent program\nable to remedy this situation. This program is inspired in the approach to\n\"fixing\" viscous relativistic hydrodynamics introduced by Israel and Stewart in\nthe late 70's. We illustrate how to implement this approach to control\nundesirable effects of higher order derivatives in gravity theories and argue\nhow the modified system still captures the true dynamics of the putative\nunderlying theories in 3+1 dimensions. We sketch the implementation of this\nidea in a couple of effective theories of gravity, one in the context of\nNon-commutative geometry, and one in the context of Chern-Simons modified\nGeneral Relativity.\n", "  We present and compare several many-body methods as applied to\ntwo-dimensional quantum dots with circular symmetry. We calculate the\napproximate ground state energy using a harmonic oscillator basis optimized by\nHartree-Fock (HF) theory and further improve the ground state energy using two\npost-HF methods: in-medium similarity renormalization group (IM-SRG) and\ncoupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD). With the application of\nquasidegenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) or the equations-of-motion (EOM)\nmethod to the results of the previous two methods, we obtain addition and\nremoval energies as well. Our results are benchmarked against full\nconfiguration interaction (FCI) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) where\navailable. We examine the rate of convergence and perform extrapolations to the\ninfinite basis limit using a power-law model.\n", "  A possible practical definition for a Hund's metal is given, as a metallic\nphase - arising consistently in realistic simulations and experiments in\nFe-based superconductors and other materials - with three features: large\nelectron masses, high-spin local configurations dominating the paramagnetic\nfluctuations and orbital-selective correlations. These features are triggered\nby, and increase with the proximity to, a Hund's coupling-favored Mott\ninsulator that is realized for half-filled conduction bands. A clear crossover\nline is found where these three features get enhanced, departing from the Mott\ntransition at half filling and extending in the interaction/doping plane,\nbetween a normal (at weak interaction and large doping) and a Hund's metal (at\nstrong interaction and small doping). This phenomenology is found identically\nin models with featureless bands, highlighting the generality of this physics\nand its robustness by respect to the details of the material band structures.\nSome analytical arguments are also given to gain insight into these defining\nfeatures. Finally the attention is brought on the recent theoretical finding of\nenhanced/diverging electronic compressibility near the Hund's metal crossover,\npointing to enhanced quasiparticle interactions that can cause or boost\nsuperconductivity or other instabilities.\n", "  Recently, it has been proposed that space-based atomic sensors may be used to\ndetect gravitational waves. These proposals describe the sensors either as\nclocks or as atom interferometers. Here, we seek to explore the fundamental\nsimilarities and differences between the two types of proposals. We present a\nframework in which the fundamental mechanism for sensitivity is identical for\nclock and atom interferometer proposals, with the key difference being whether\nor not the atoms are tightly confined by an external potential. With this\ninterpretation in mind, we propose two major enhancements to detectors using\nconfined atoms, which allow for an enhanced sensitivity analogous to\nlarge-momentum-transfer (LMT) used in atom interferometry (though with no\ntransfer of momentum to the atoms), and a way to extend the useful coherence\ntime of the sensor beyond the atom's excited state lifetime.\n", "  A power-law corrected entropy based on a quantum entanglement is considered\nto be a viable black-hole entropy. In this study, as an alternative to\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy, a power-law corrected entropy is applied to\nPadmanabhan's holographic equipartition law to thermodynamically examine an\nextra driving term in the cosmological equations for a flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universe at late times. Deviations from the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy generate an extra driving term (proportional to the\n$\\alpha$-th power of the Hubble parameter, where $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless\nconstant for the power-law correction) in the acceleration equation, which can\nbe derived from the holographic equipartition law. Interestingly, the value of\nthe extra driving term in the present model is constrained by the second law of\nthermodynamics. From the thermodynamic constraint, the order of the driving\nterm is found to be consistent with the order of the cosmological constant\nmeasured by observations. In addition, the driving term tends to be\nconstant-like when $\\alpha$ is small, i.e., when the deviation from the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy is small.\n", "  The resource theoretic measure of quantum coherence is basis dependent, and\nthe amount of coherence contained in a state is different in different bases.\nWe obtained analytical solutions for the maximum coherence by optimizing the\nreference basis and highlighted the essential role of the mutually unbiased\nbases (MUBs) on attaining the maximum coherence. Apart from the relative\nentropy of coherence, we showed that the MUBs are optimal for the robustness of\ncoherence, the coherence weight, and the modified skew information measure of\ncoherence for any state. Moreover, the MUBs are optimal for all the faithful\ncoherence measures if the state is pure or is of the single qubit. We also\nhighlighted an upper bound for the $l_1$ norm of coherence and compared it with\nthe other bounds as well as the maximum one attainable by optimizing the\nreference basis.\n", "  Self-sputtering of copper under high electric fields is considered to\ncontribute to plasma buildup during a vacuum breakdown event frequently\nobserved near metal surfaces, even in ultra high vacuum condition in different\nelectric devices. In this study, by means of molecular dynamics simulations, we\nanalyze the effect of surface temperature and morphology on the yield of\nself-sputtering of copper with ion energies of 0.1-5 keV. We analyze all three\nlow-index surfaces of Cu, {100}, {110} and {111}, held at different\ntemperatures, 300 K, 500 K and 1200 K. The surface roughness relief is studied\nby either varying the angle of incidence on flat surfaces, or by using\narbitrary roughened surfaces, which result in a more natural distribution of\nsurface relief variations. Our simulations provide detailed characterization of\ncopper self-sputtering with respect to different material temperatures,\ncrystallographic orientations, surface roughness, energies, and angles of ion\nincidence.\n", "  We develop a method to characterize topological phase transitions for\nstrongly correlated Hamiltonians defined on two-dimensional lattices based on\nthe many-body Berry curvature. Our goal is to identify a class of quantum\ncritical points between topologically nontrivial phases with fractionally\nquantized Hall (FQH) conductivity and topologically trivial gapped phases\nthrough the discontinuities of the many-body Berry curvature in the so-called\nflux Brillouin zone (fBZ), the latter being defined by imposing all possible\ntwisted boundary conditions. For this purpose, we study the finite-size\nsignatures of several quantum phase transitions between fractional Chern\ninsulators and charge-ordered phases for two-dimensional lattices by evaluating\nthe many-body Berry curvature numerically using exact diagonalization. We\nobserve degeneracy points (nodes) of many-body energy levels at high-symmetry\npoints in the fBZ, accompanied by diverging Berry curvature. We find a\ncorrespondence between the number and order of these nodal points, and the\nchange of the topological invariants of the many-body ground states across the\ntransition, in close analogy with Weyl nodes in non-interacting band\nstructures. This motivates us to apply a scaling procedure, originally\ndeveloped for non-interacting systems, for the Berry curvature at the nodal\npoints. This procedure offers a useful tool for the classification of\ntopological phase transitions in interacting systems harboring FQH-like\ntopological order.\n", "  As a binary pulsar moves through a wind of dark matter particles, the\nresulting dynamical friction modifies the binary's orbit. We study this effect\nfor the double disk dark matter (DDDM) scenario, where a fraction of the dark\nmatter is dissipative and settles into a thin disk. For binaries within the\ndark disk, this effect is enhanced due to the higher dark matter density and\nlower velocity dispersion of the dark disk, and due to its co-rotation with the\nbaryonic disk.We estimate the effect and compare it with observations for two\ndifferent limits in the Knudsen number ($Kn$). First, in the case where DDDM is\neffectively collisionless within the characteristic scale of the binary\n($Kn\\gg1$) and ignoring the possible interaction between the pair of dark\nmatter wakes. Second, in the fully collisional case ($Kn\\ll1$), where a fluid\ndescription can be adopted and the interaction of the pair of wakes is taken\ninto account. We find that the change in the orbital period is of the same\norder of magnitude in both limits. A comparison with observations reveals good\nprospects to probe currently allowed DDDM models with timing data from binary\npulsars in the near future. We finally comment on the possibility of extending\nthe analysis to the intermediate (rarefied gas) case with $Kn\\sim1$.\n", "  We consider the general ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory with matter,\nregularized by higher covariant derivatives without breaking the BRST\ninvariance, in the massless limit. In the $\\xi$-gauge we obtain the\n(unrenormalized) expression for the two-point Green function of the quantum\ngauge superfield in the one-loop approximation as a sum of integrals over the\nloop momentum. The result is presented as a sum of three parts: the first one\ncorresponds to the pure supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory in the Feynman gauge,\nthe second one contains all gauge dependent terms, and the third one is the\ncontribution of diagrams with a matter loop. For the Feynman gauge and a\nspecial choice of the higher derivative regulator in the gauge fixing term we\nanalytically calculate these integrals in the limit $k\\to 0$. In particular, in\naddition to the leading logarithmically divergent terms, which are determined\nby integrals of double total derivatives, we also find the finite constants.\n", "  We examine the properties of strongly magnetized accretion discs in a global\nframework, with particular focus on the evolution of magnetohydrodynamic\ninstabilities such as the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Work by Pessah\nand Psaltis showed that MRI is stabilized beyond a critical toroidal field in\ncompressible, differentially rotating flows and, also, reported the appearance\nof two new instabilities beyond this field. Their results stemmed from\nconsidering geometric curvature effects due to the suprathermal background\ntoroidal field, which had been previously ignored in weak-field studies.\nHowever, their calculations were performed under the local approximation, which\nposes the danger of introducing spurious behavior due to the introduction of\nglobal geometric terms in an otherwise local framework. In order to avoid this,\nwe perform a global eigenvalue analysis of the linearized MHD equations in\ncylindrical geometry. We confirm that MRI indeed tends to be highly suppressed\nwhen the background toroidal field attains the Pessah-Psaltis limit. We also\nobserve the appearance of two new instabilities that emerge in the presence of\nhighly suprathermal toroidal fields. These results were additionally verified\nusing numerical simulations in PLUTO. There are, however, certain differences\nbetween the the local and global results, especially in the vertical wavenumber\noccupancies of the various instabilities, which we discuss in detail. We also\nstudy the global eigenfunctions of the most unstable modes in the suprathermal\nregime, which are inaccessible in the local analysis. Overall, our findings\nemphasize the necessity of a global treatment for accurately modeling strongly\nmagnetized accretion discs.\n", "  The issue intensively claimed in the literature on the generation of a\nCPT-odd and Lorentz violating Chern-Simons-like term by radiative corrections\nowing to a CPT violating interaction -- the axial coupling of fermions with a\nconstant vector field $b_\\m$ -- is mistaken. The presence of massless gauge\nfield triggers IR divergences that might show up from the UV subtractions,\ntherefore, so as to deal with the (actual physical) IR divergences, the\nLowenstein-Zimmermann subtraction scheme, in the framework of BPHZL\nrenormalization method, has to be adopted. The proof on the non generation of\nsuch a Chern-Simons-like term is done, independent of any kind of\nregularization scheme, at all orders in perturbation theory.\n", "  The wave-particle duality has been said to contain the entire mystery of\nquantum mechanics. Many delayed-choice experiments have been performed to\nfurther understand the wave-particle duality. Here, we reveal some flaws in the\nknown interference theories by comparing the theoretical predictions with the\nexperimental facts and show that the presence of media is a necessary condition\nfor interference of single photons, a photon interferes with other photon via\nmicroscopic particles in the interface of media, and the wave-like property of\na photon originates from interaction between the photon and media; the particle\nproperty is the inherent characteristic of a photon, and the wave-like behavior\nof a photon always accompanies the particle behavior; the coherent time of\nsingle photons cannot be longer than the lifetime of the polarized states of\nthe microscopic particles. Interference of single photons is interpreted\nproperly, and the conundrum of the wave-particle duality is well solved.\n", "  Non-linear sigma models defined on symmetric target spaces have a wide set of\napplications in modern physics, including the description of string propagation\nin symmetric spaces, such as AdS or dS, or minimal surfaces in hyperbolic\nspaces. Although it is difficult to acquire solutions of these models, due to\ntheir non-linear nature, it is well known that they are reducible to integrable\nsystems of the family of the sine- or sinh-Gordon equation. In this study, we\ndevelop a method to invert Pohlmeyer reduction for elliptic solutions of the\nreduced system, implementing a relation between NLSM solutions and the\neigenstates of the n = 1 Lame problem. This method is applied to produce a\nfamily of classical string solutions in AdS(3), which includes the spiky\nstrings, as well as hoop string solutions with singular evolution of their\nangular velocity and radius, which are interesting in the framework of\nholographic dualities. Furthermore, application of this method produces a wide\nfamily of static minimal surfaces in AdS(4), which includes helicoids and\ncatenoids, and which are interesting in the framework of the Ryu-Takayanagi\nconjecture and the understanding of the emergence of gravity as an entropic\nforce related to quantum entanglement statistics. The developed formalism\nallows the study of the area of the minimal surfaces and geometric phase\ntransitions between them, which are relevant to confinement-deconfinement phase\ntransitions.\n", "  We simulate the evolution of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C. The simulation\nshows the existence of a new northeast edge. We present magnetic field\nstructure of the W51 complex (SNR W51C and two HII regions W51A/B) by employing\nthe 11 cm survey data of Effelsberg. This new edge is identified and overlaps\nwith W51A along the line of sight, which gives a new angular diameter of about\n37' for the quasi-circular remnant. In addition, we assemble the OH spectral\nlines (1612/1665/1720 MHz) towards the complex by employing the newly released\nTHOR (The HI OH Recombination line survey of Milky Way) data. We find that the\nknown 1720 MHz OH maser in the W51B/C overlap area is located away from the\ndetected 1612/1665MHz absorption region. The latter is sitting at the peak of\nthe HII region G49.2-0.35 within W51B.\n", "  We briefly report on some particular aspects of new physics searches\nconcerning, on the one side, the CKM paradigm and, on the other, the global fit\nto rare $b\\to s \\ell\\ell$ observables including lepton flavour universality\nones. We put special emphasis on the state-of-the-art of hadronic uncertainties\nof $b\\to s\\mu\\mu$ observables and LFUV in SM and in presence of New Physics.\nFinally, we discuss the latest experimental and theoretical developments\nconcerning long-distance charm contributions.\n", "  Why does controlling quantum phenomena appear easy to achieve? Why do\neffective quantum controls appear easy to find? Why is chemical synthesis and\nproperty optimization easier than expected? How to explain the commonalities\nacross the optimal control applications in quantum mechanics, chemistry,\nmaterial science, biological evolution and engineering? The theory of quantum\ncontrol landscapes (QCL) is developed by Prof. Rabitz and his colleagues to\naddress these puzzling questions. Unfortunately, the obtained conclusions are\nsubject of gross misinterpretations which are spread in hundreds of published\npapers. We investigate, summarize and report several previously unknown\nsubtleties of the QCL theory which have far-reaching implications for nearly\nall practical applications.\n", "  We propose the use of pure spin-3/2 propagator in the $(3/2,0) \\oplus\n(0,3/2)$ representation in particle and nuclear physics. To formulate the\npropagator in a covariant form we use the antisymmetric tensor spinor\nrepresentation and we consider the $\\Delta$ resonance contribution to the\nelastic $\\pi N$ scattering as an example. We find that the use of conventional\ngauge invariant interaction Lagrangian leads to a problem; the obtained\nscattering amplitude does not exhibit the resonance behavior. To overcome this\nproblem we modify the interaction by adding a momentum dependence. As in the\ncase of Rarita-Schwinger we find that a perfect resonance description could be\nobtained in the pure spin-3/2 formulation only if hadronic form factors were\nconsidered in the interactions.\n", "  In this work we study the main properties and the one-loop renormalization of\na Yang-Mills theory in which the kinetic term contains also a fourth-order\ndifferential operator; in particular, we add to the Yang-Mills Lagrangian the\nmost general contribution of mass dimension six, weighted with a dimensionful\nparameter. This model is renormalizable; in the literature two values for the\nbeta function for the gauge coupling have been reported, one obtained using the\nheat kernel approach and one with Feynman diagrams. In this work we repeat the\ncomputation using heat kernel techniques confirming the latter result. We also\nconsidered coupling with matter.\n  We then study the supersymmetric extension of the model; this is a nontrivial\ntask because of the complicate structure of the higher-derivative term. Some\npartial results were known, but a computation of the beta functions for the\nfull supersymmetric non-Abelian higher-derivative gauge theory was missing. We\nmake use of the (unextended) supersymmetric higher-derivative Lagrangian\ndensity for the Yang-Mills field in six spacetime dimensions derived in\narXiv:hep-th/0505082; by dimensional reduction we obtain the N=1 and N=2\nsupersymmetric higher-derivative super-Yang-Mills Lagrangian in four spacetime\ndimensions, whose beta function we evaluate using heat kernels. We also deduce\nthe beta function for N=4 supersymmetry.\n", "  We study metastable motions in weakly damped Hamiltonian systems. These are\nbelieved to inhibit the transport of energy through Hamiltonian, or nearly\nHamiltonian, systems with many degrees of freedom. We investigate this question\nin a very simple model in which the breather solutions that are thought to be\nresponsible for the metastable states can be computed perturbatively to an\narbitrary order. Then, using a modulation hypothesis, we derive estimates for\nthe rate at which the system drifts along this manifold of periodic orbits and\nverify the optimality of our estimates numerically.\n", "  Recently determined atomistic scale structures of near-two dimensional\nbilayers of vitreous silica (using scanning probe and electron microscopy)\nallow us to refine the experimentally determined coordinates to incorporate the\nknown local chemistry more precisely. Further refinement is achieved by using\nclassical potentials of varying complexity; one using harmonic potentials and\nthe second employing an electrostatic description incorporating polarization\neffects. These are benchmarked against density functional calculations. Our\nmain findings are that (a) there is a symmetry plane between the two disordered\nlayers; a nice example of an emergent phenomenon, (b) the layers are slightly\ntilted so that the Si-O-Si angle between the two layers is not $180^{\\circ}$ as\noriginally thought but rather $175 \\pm 2 ^{\\circ}$ and (c) while interior areas\nthat are not completely imagined can be reliably reconstructed, surface areas\nare more problematical. It is shown that small crystallites that appear are\njust as expected statistically in a continuous random network. This provides a\ngood example of the value that can be added to disordered structures imaged at\nthe atomic level by implementing computer refinement.\n", "  In this article we have investigated the possibility of Bose-Einstein\nCondensation (BEC) in a frame undergoing uniform acceleration or in other\nwards, in Rindler space associated with the uniformly accelerated frame. We\nhave followed a very simple conventional technique generally used in text book\nlevel studies. It has been observed that the critical temperature for BEC\nincreases with the increase in magnitude of acceleration of the frame.\nTypically the critical temperature in an accelerated frame is of the order of\nthe Unruh temperature. Hence we have concluded that the increase in the\nmagnitude of acceleration of the frame facilitates the formation of condensed\nphase.\n", "  Heterogeneity has been studied as one of the most common explanations of the\npuzzle of cooperation in social dilemmas. A large number of papers have been\npublished discussing the effects of increasing heterogeneity in structured\npopulations of agents, where it has been established that heterogeneity may\nfavour cooperative behaviour if it supports agents to locally coordinate their\nstrategies. In this paper, assuming an existing model of a heterogeneous\nweighted network, we aim to further this analysis by exploring the relationship\n(if any) between heterogeneity and cooperation. We adopt a weighted network\nwhich is fully populated by agents playing both the Prisoner's Dilemma or the\nOptional Prisoner's Dilemma games with coevolutionary rules, i.e., not only the\nstrategies but also the link weights evolve over time. Surprisingly, results\nshow that the heterogeneity of link weights (states) on their own does not\nalways promote cooperation; rather cooperation is actually favoured by the\nincrease in the number of overlapping states and not by the heterogeneity\nitself. We believe that these results can guide further research towards a more\naccurate analysis of the role of heterogeneity in social dilemmas.\n", "  In this work, we improve the accuracy and stability of the lattice Boltzmann\nmodel for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation proposed in \\cite{2017_Otomo}. This\nimprovement is achieved by controlling the relaxation time, modifying the\nequilibrium state, and employing more and higher lattice speeds, in a manner\nsuggested by our analysis of the Taylor-series expansion method. The model's\nenhanced stability enables us to use larger time increments, thereby more than\ncompensating for the extra computation required by the high lattice speeds.\nFurthermore, even though the time increments are larger than those of the\nprevious scheme, the same level of accuracy is maintained because of the\nsmaller truncation error of the new scheme. As a result, total performance with\nthe new scheme on the D1Q7 lattice is improved by 92 $\\%$ compared to the\noriginal scheme on the D1Q5 lattice.\n", "  The relativistic semiclassical evolution of the position of an electron in\nthe presence of an external electromagnetic field is studied in terms of a\nNewton equation that incorporates spin effects directly. This equation emerges\nfrom the Dirac equation and allows the identification of scenarios where spin\neffects are necessary to understand the main characteristics of the electron\ntrajectories. It involves the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian operator\n$\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$ with $\\Sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ as the spin\nand electromagnetic tensors. The formalism allows a deeper understanding on the\nphysics behind known analytical solutions of the Dirac equation when\ntranslational dynamics decouples from spin evolution. As an illustrative\nexample, it is applied to an electron immersed in an electromagnetic field\nwhich exhibits chiral symmetry and optical vortices. It is shown that the\npolarization of intense structured light beams can be used to suppress or\nenhance spin effects on the electron semiclassical trajectory; the latter case\nyields a realization of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus for an electron\n", "  We demonstrate that the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) provides a\nnon-destructive, highly-efficient characterization method for large-area\nepitaxial graphene and graphene nanostructures on SiC substrates, which can be\napplied in ambient air without sample preparation and is insusceptible to\nsurface charging or surface contamination. Based on the variation of reflected\nintensity from regions covered by interfacial layer, single layer, bilayer, or\nfew layer graphene, and through the correlation to the results from Raman\nspectroscopy and SPM, CLSM images with a high resolution (around 150 nm) reveal\nthat the intensity contrast has distinct feature for undergrown graphene\n(mixing of dense, parallel graphene nanoribbons and interfacial layer),\ncontinuous graphene, and overgrown graphene. Moreover, CLSM has a real\nacquisition time hundreds of times faster per unit area than the supplementary\ncharacterization methods. We believe that the confocal laser scanning\nmicroscope will be an indispensable tool for mass-produced epitaxial graphene\nor applicable 2D materials.\n", "  In this paper, we first discuss the main types of noise in a typical\npump-probe system, and then focus specifically on terahertz time domain\nspectroscopy (THz-TDS) setups. We then introduce four statistical models for\nthe noisy pulses obtained in such systems, and detail rigorous mathematical\nalgorithms to de-noise such traces, find the proper averages and characterise\nvarious types of experimental noise. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis\nof the performance, advantages and limitations of the algorithms by testing\nthem on the experimental data collected using a particular THz-TDS system\navailable in our laboratories. We conclude that using advanced statistical\nmodels for trace averaging results in the fitting errors that are significantly\nsmaller than those obtained when only a simple statistical average is used.\n", "  The analysis of the secondary Bjerknes force between two bubbles suggests\nthat this force is analogous to the electrostatic forces. The same analogy is\nsuggested by the existence of a scattering cross section of an acoustic wave on\na bubble. Our paper brings new arguments in support of this analogy. The study\nwhich we perform is dedicated to the acoustic force and to the scattering cross\nsection at resonance in order to highlight their angular frequency independence\nof the inductor wave. Also, our study reveals that the angular frequency and\nthe amplitude of the induction pressure wave are not related. Highlighting this\nanalogy will allow us a better understanding of the electrostatic interaction\nif the electron is modeled as an oscillating bubble in the vacuum.\n", "  We extend the previous work of Olivier Costa de Beauregard regarding the\nisomorphism between the equation describing the motion of relativistic point\nparticles and the equation describing the static equilibrium of classical\nelastic strings, by comparing the Lagrangians of these two systems.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) is an emerging two-dimensional semiconducting material\nwith great potential for nanoelectronic and nanophotonic applications,\nespecially owing to its unique anisotropic electrical and optical properties.\nMany theoretical studies have predicted the anisotropic optical properties of\nBP, but the direct experimental quantification remains challenging. The\ndifficulties stem from the ease of BP's degradation when exposed to air in\nambient conditions, and from the indirect nature of conventional approaches\nthat are subject to large measurement uncertainties. This work reports a direct\ninvestigation of the birefringent optical constants of micrometer-thick BP\nsamples with picosecond (ps) interferometry, over the wavelength range from 780\nto 890 nm. In this ps-interferometry approach, an ultrathin (5 nm) platinum\nlayer for launching acoustic waves naturally protects the BP flake from\ndegradation. The birefringent optical constants of BP for light polarization\nalong the two primary crystalline orientations, zigzag and armchair, are\ndirectly obtained via fitting the attenuated Brillouin scattering signals. A\nbi-exponential model is further proposed to analyze the BS signals for a random\nincident light polarization. The BP experimental results and the associated\nmeasurement sensitivity analysis demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of\nthe ps-interferometry approach for capturing the polarization-dependent optical\nproperties of birefringent materials.\n", "  In the present study, MHD boundary layer flow with heat and mass transfer of\na nanofluid with viscous dissipation over a non-linear stretching sheet\nembedded in a porous medium is studied. The governing non-linear partial\ndifferential equations are converted into coupled non-linear ordinary\ndifferential equations which are solved by hybrid technique consisting of\nfinite element method with symbolic computation. The effect of Viscous\ndissipation, magnetic influence parameter, permeability parameter, Brownian\nmotion, Eckert number, Thermophoresis parameter, Prandtl number parameter,\nDufour Lewis number and nanofluid Lewis number are studied for velocity\n$(f'(\\eta))$, temperature $(\\theta(\\eta))$, concentration of salt ($S(\\eta)$)\nand concentration of nanoparticles $(\\gamma(\\eta))$ and results are shown\ngraphically. Applications of such type of problems are found in the\nelectromagnetic control of complex magnetic nanofluid materials relevant to\nenergy and biomedical systems.\n", "  We looked for a biological analogy to developed an improved surface coil to\nacquire magnetic resonance images. Nature offers engineering solutions that can\nbe exploited to improve the performance of devices, such as MRI RF coils. In\nthis paper, we proposed a coil layout based on flower petal patterns for UHF\nMRI at 15.2 T. This particular configuration offers the possibility to use a\ndifferent number of petals and shapes. The petal resonator coil and the\nmagnetron coil have similar layouts, which have proved to outperform the\npopular circular coil. Phantom images were acquired with our coil prototype to\ndemonstrate it feasibility. These phantom images show no image degradation\ncaused by the mutual inductance of the adjacent petals in both orientations.\nThe SNR was also calculated using the image data and giving 31.16. Phantom\nimages showed the coil viability and compatibility with conventional pulse\nsequences at 15.2 T. It still remains to investigate whether this bio-inspired\nsurface coil is able to outperformed the popular circular coil.\n", "  A two-layer shallow water type model is proposed to describe bedload sediment\ntransport. The upper layer is filled by water and the lower one by sediment.\nThe key point falls on the definition of the friction laws between the two\nlayers, which are a generalization of those introduced in Fern\\'andez-Nieto et\nal. (ESAIM: M2AN, 51:115-145, 2017). This definition allows to apply properly\nthe two-layer shallow water model for the case of intense and slow bedload\nsediment transport. Moreover, we prove that the two-layer model converges to a\nSaint-Venant-Exner system (SVE) including gravitational effects when the ratio\nbetween the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic time scales is small. The SVE with\ngravitational effects is a degenerated nonlinear parabolic system. This means\nthat its numerical approximation is very expensive from a computational point\nof view, see for example T. Morales de Luna et al. (J. Sci. Comp., 48(1):\n258-273, 2011). In this work, gravitational effects are introduced into the\ntwo-layer system without such extra computational cost. Finally, we also\nconsider a generalization of the model that includes a non-hydrostatic pressure\ncorrection for the fluid layer and the boundary condition at the sediment\nsurface. Numerical tests show that the model provides promising results and\nbehave well in low transport rate regimes as well as in many other situations.\n", "  We present the Exoplanet Simple Orbit Fitting Toolbox (ExoSOFT), a new,\nopen-source suite to fit the orbital elements of planetary or stellar mass\ncompanions to any combination of radial velocity and astrometric data. To\nexplore the parameter space of Keplerian models, ExoSOFT may be operated with\nits own multi-stage sampling approach, or interfaced with third-party tools\nsuch as emcee. In addition, ExoSOFT is packaged with a collection of\npost-processing tools to analyze and summarize the results. Although only a few\nsystems have been observed with both the radial velocity and direct imaging\ntechniques, this number will increase thanks to upcoming spacecraft and ground\nbased surveys. Providing both forms of data enables simultaneous fitting that\ncan help break degeneracies in the orbital elements that arise when only one\ndata type is available. The dynamical mass estimates this approach can produce\nare important when investigating the formation mechanisms and subsequent\nevolution of substellar companions. ExoSOFT was verified through fitting to\nartificial data and was implemented using the Python and Cython programming\nlanguages; available for public download at https://github.com/kylemede/ExoSOFT\nunder the GNU General Public License v3.\n", "  The construction of a consistent measure for Yang-Mills is a precondition for\nan accurate formulation of non-perturbative approaches to QCD, both analytical\nand numerical. Using projective limits as subsets of Cartesian products of\nhomomorphisms from a lattice to the structure group, a consistent interaction\nmeasure and an infinite-dimensional calculus has been constructed for a theory\nof non-abelian generalized connections on a hypercubic lattice. Here, after\nreviewing and clarifying past work, new results are obtained for the mass gap\nwhen the structure group is compact.\n", "  Advanced hydrogen lithography techniques and low-temperature epitaxial\novergrowth enable patterning of highly phosphorus-doped silicon (Si:P)\nmonolayers (ML) with atomic precision. This approach to device fabrication has\nmade Si:P monolayer systems a testbed for multiqubit quantum computing\narchitectures and atomically precise 2-D superlattice designs whose behaviors\nare directly tied to the deterministic placement of single dopants. However,\ndopant segregation, diffusion, surface roughening, and defect formation during\nthe encapsulation overgrowth introduce large uncertainties to the exact dopant\nplacement and activation ratio. In this study, we develop a unique method by\ncombining dopant segregation/diffusion models with sputter profiling simulation\nto monitor and control, at the atomic scale, dopant movement using\nroom-temperature grown locking layers (LL). We explore the impact of LL growth\nrate, thickness, rapid thermal anneal, surface accumulation, and growth front\nroughness on dopant confinement, local crystalline quality, and electrical\nactivation within Si:P 2-D systems. We demonstrate that dopant movement can be\nmore efficiently suppressed by increasing the LL growth rate than by increasing\nLL thickness. We find that the dopant segregation length can be suppressed\nbelow a single Si lattice constant by increasing LL growth rates at room\ntemperature while maintaining epitaxy. Although dopant diffusivity within the\nLL is found to remain high even below the hydrogen desorption temperature, we\ndemonstrate that exceptionally sharp dopant confinement with high electrical\nquality within Si:P monolayers can be achieved by combining a high LL growth\nrate with a low-temperature LL rapid thermal anneal.\n", "  Mg-Si-Sn solid solutions have interesting and useful semiconducting\nproperties particularly for thermoelectric applications. While cubic solid\nsolutions have been prepared by a variety of methods, solid solutions with a\ntrigonal crystal structure have not been reported. We employed a combination of\nhigh energy ball milling and current activated pressure assisted densification\n(CAPAD) to induce and complete phase transformation from cubic to trigonal\nphase, forming dense trigonal composites. This is the first successful\npreparation of the trigonal phase in Mg-Si-Sn stem. In addition, we report the\ntransport properties of both the cubic and trigonal composites measured in the\n160 to 400 K range. The electrical conductivity of the trigonal composites was\nseveral times higher compared to the cubic counterparts while thermal\nconductivity is lower but in the range of previously reported Mg-Si-Sn\nmaterials. The Seebeck coefficient of the trigonal composites is lower compared\nto the cubic samples, leading to low ZT values. The ZT of the cubic samples,\nhowever is higher than previously reported for un-doped Mg-Si-Sn solid\nsolutions which is promising for thermoelectric applications.\n", "  In 2005, trace distance between an ideal quantum state to be distributed and\nan actual quantum state distributed was introduced as a valid security measure\nof Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) by R. Renner et al., then it has been\nperceived that the trace can be interpreted as a maximum failure probability of\nQKD. While such a perspective has been widely accepted, H. P. Yuen and O.\nHirota have been warning that such an interpretation is not correct since 2009.\nThe author of this study has been giving questions on the interpretation of the\ntrace distance based on their criticisms since QIT30 in May 2014, and has been\nproposing Yuen's idea to evaluate the security of QKD by the probability for\nthe attacker to guess the correct key. However, the author could not give the\nguessing probability concretely. In this study, the author explains how to\nderive the average guessing probability for the attacker, where its result\nequals to Yuen's derivation firstly seen in 2010. From this result, one will\nsee the problems with the maximum failure probability interpretation of the\ntrace distance clearly. This study also explains the indistinguishability\nadvantage interpretation is also invalid.\n", "  The location of a repeat plume detected at Europa is found to be coincident\nwith the strongest ionosphere detection made by Galileo radio occultation in\n1997.\n", "  We describe the MERger-event Gamma-Ray (MERGR) Telescope intended for\ndeployment by ~2021. MERGR will cover from 20 keV to 2 MeV with a wide field of\nview (6 sr) using nineteen gamma-ray detectors arranged on a section of a\nsphere. The telescope will work as a standalone system or as part of a network\nof sensors, to increase by ~50% the current sky coverage to detect short\nGamma-Ray Burst (SGRB) counterparts to neutron-star binary mergers within the\n~200 Mpc range of gravitational wave detectors in the early 2020's. Inflight\nsoftware will provide realtime burst detections with mean localization\nuncertainties of 6 deg for a photon fluence of 5 ph cm^-2 (the mean fluence of\nFermi-GBM SGRBs) and <3 deg for the brightest ~5% of SGRBs to enable rapid\nmulti-wavelength follow-up to identify a host galaxy and its redshift. To\nminimize cost and time to first light, MERGR is directly derived from\ndemonstrators designed and built at NRL for the DoD Space Test Program (STP).\nWe argue that the deployment of a network that provides all-sky coverage for\nSGRB detection is of immediate urgency to the multi-messenger astrophysics\ncommunity.\n", "  High precision calorimetry using superconducting transition edge sensors\nrequires the use of superconducting films with a suitable $T_c$, depending on\nthe application. To advance high-precision macrocalorimetry, we require\nlow-$T_c$ films that are easy to fabricate. A simple and effective way to\nsuppress $T_c$ of superconducting Iridium through the proximity effect is\ndemonstrated by using Ir/Pt bilayers as well as Au/Ir/Au trilayers. While Ir/Au\nfilms fabricated by applying heat to the substrate during Ir deposition have\nbeen used in the past for superconducting sensors, we present results of $T_c$\nsuppression on Iridium by deposition at room temperature in Au/Ir/Au trilayers\nand Ir/Pt bilayers in the range of $\\sim$20-100~mK. Measurements of the\nrelative impedance between the Ir/Pt bilayers and Au/Ir/Au trilayers fabricated\nshow factor of $\\sim$10 higher values in the Ir/Pt case. These new films could\nplay a key role in the development of scalable superconducting transition edge\nsensors that require low-$T_c$ films to minimize heat capacity and maximize\nenergy resolution, while keeping high-yield fabrication methods.\n", "  A new lower boundary for the product of variances of two observables is\nobtained in the case, when these observables are entangled with the third one.\nThis boundary can be higher than the Robertson--Schr\\\"odinger one. The special\ncase of the two-dimensional pure Gaussian state is considered as an example.\n", "  The modelling of stochastic processes is ubiquitous throughout the natural\nand social sciences. An ideal model produces the correct statistical output\nwithout any unnecessary complexity. This minimal-complexity criterion is\nimportant conceptually, entailing the least number of causes of effects\n(Occam's razor), and practically, entailing the least stored information in the\nsimulation. Here, we experimentally compare classical and quantum information\nencodings in simulating an Ising spin chain, showing that quantum encodings\nperform better and redefine our understanding of what is complex. We\nexperimentally observe a recently conjectured effect, the ambiguity of\nsimplicity. Specifically, we simulate Ising chains at different temperatures, A\nand B, such that classical encodings require fewer resources to model A than B,\nwhile quantum encodings are simpler for B than A. This challenges the\nperspective that relative complexity is contained solely in the configuration\nof the system being modelled. Our error-tolerant techniques account for\ninevitable imperfections in realising quantum simulators, thus providing the\ntechnological milestone needed to simulate increasingly complex stochastic\nprocesses.\n", "  Assume that $M$ is a smooth manifold with a symplectic structure $\\omega$.\nThen Weyl manifolds on the symplectic manifold $M$ are Weyl algebra bundles\nendowed with suitable transition functions. From the geometrical point of view,\nWeyl manifolds can be regarded as geometrizations of star products attached to\n$(M,\\omega)$. In the present paper, we are concerned with the automorphisms of\nthe Weyl manifold corresponding to Poincar\\'e-Cartan class ($c_0$ is a\n$\\check{\\rm C}$ech cocycle corresponding to the symplectic structure $\\omega$.)\n$[c_0+\\sum_{\\ell=1}^\\infty c_{\\ell} \\nu^{2\\ell}]\\in \\check{H}^2 (M)[[\\nu^2]]$.\nWe also construct modified contact Weyl diffeomorphisms.\n", "  Coherent vortices are often observed to persist for long times in turbulent\n2D flows even at very high Reynolds numbers and are observed in experiments and\ncomputer simulations to potentially be asymptotically stable in a weak sense\nfor the 2D Euler equations. We consider the incompressible 2D Euler equations\nlinearized around a radially symmetric, strictly monotone decreasing vorticity\ndistribution. For sufficiently regular data, we prove the inviscid damping of\nthe $\\theta$-dependent radial and angular velocity fields with the optimal\nrates $\\|u^r(t)\\| \\lesssim \\langle t \\rangle^{-1}$ and $\\|u^\\theta(t)\\|\n\\lesssim \\langle t \\rangle^{-2}$ in the appropriate radially weighted $L^2$\nspaces. We moreover prove that the vorticity weakly converges back to radial\nsymmetry as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, a phenomenon known as vortex\naxisymmetrization in the physics literature, and characterize the dynamics in\nhigher Sobolev spaces. Furthermore, we prove that the $\\theta$-dependent\nangular Fourier modes in the vorticity are ejected from the origin as $t \\to\n\\infty$, resulting in faster inviscid damping rates than those possible with\npassive scalar evolution. This non-local effect is called vorticity depletion.\nOur work appears to be the first to find vorticity depletion relevant for the\ndynamics of vortices.\n", "  The self-heating effect is a severe issue for high-power semiconductor\ndevices, which degrades the electron mobility and saturation velocity, and also\naffects the device reliability. On applying an ultrafast and high-resolution\nthermoreflectance imaging technique, the direct self-heating effect and surface\ntemperature increase phenomenon are observed on novel top-gate \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 on\ninsulator field-effect transistors. Here, we demonstrate that by utilizing a\nhigher thermal conductivity sapphire substrate rather than a SiO2/Si substrate,\nthe temperature rise above room temperature of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 on the insulator\nfield-effect transistor can be reduced by a factor of 3 and thereby the\nself-heating effect is significantly reduced. Both thermoreflectance\ncharacterization and simulation verify that the thermal resistance on the\nsapphire substrate is less than 1/3 of that on the SiO2/Si substrate.\nTherefore, maximum drain current density of 535 mA/mm is achieved on the\nsapphire substrate, which is 70% higher than that on the SiO2/Si substrate due\nto reduced self-heating. Integration of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 channel on a higher\nthermal conductivity substrate opens a new route to address the low thermal\nconductivity issue of \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 for power electronics applications.\n", "  Optical diffraction tomography (ODT), initially described in the seminal\npaper of Emil Wolf [Opt. Comm., 1(4), 153-156 (1969)], has received renewed\nattention recently. The vast majority of ODT experiments reported to date have\nbeen 3D images of single cells or beads demonstrating excellent image quality\nand sectioning capability. The sample thickness in these experiments is 10 to\n20 microns and the optical thickness is generally well below 2{\\pi}. In this\npaper, we explore ODT when the sample consists of multiple layers of cells. We\nassess experimentally the impact of sample thickness for the different ODT\nreconstruction algorithms and we describe a strategy that allows us to image,\nfor the first time, multi-cell clusters.\n", "  In this Letter, we present an analysis of the relation between the\nvariability of broad absorption lines (BALs) and that of the continuum. Our\nsample is multi-epoch observations of 483 quasars by the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey-I/II/III (SDSS-I/II/III). We derive the fractional flux variations of\nthe continuum and fractional equivalent width (EW) variations for C IV and Si\nIV BALs, and explore the correlations between the three. Our results reveal\nmoderate anticorrelations with high significance level between the fractional\nflux variations of the continuum and fractional EW variations for both C IV and\nSi IV BALs. We also prove a significant positive correlation between the\nfractional EW variations for C IV and Si IV BALs, which is in agreement with\nseveral previous studies. Our discoveries can serve as evidence for the idea:\nChange of an ionizing continuum is the primary driver of BAL variability.\n", "  The spatio-temporal features of the velocity field of a fully-developed\nturbulent channel flow are investigated through the natural visibility graph\n(NVG) method, which is able to fully map the intrinsic structure of the\ntime-series into complex networks. Time-series of the three velocity\ncomponents, (u,v,w), are analyzed at fixed grid-points of the whole\nthree-dimensional domain. Each time-series was mapped into a network by means\nof the NVG algorithm, so that each network corresponds to a grid-point of the\nsimulation. The degree centrality, the transitivity and the here proposed mean\nlink-length were evaluated as indicators of the global visibility,\ninter-visibility, and mean temporal distance among nodes, respectively. The\nmetrics were averaged along the directions of homogeneity (x, z) of the flow,\nso they only depend on the wall-normal coordinate, y^+. The visibility-based\nnetworks, inheriting the flow field features, unveil key temporal properties of\nthe turbulent time-series and their changes moving along y^+. Although\nintrinsically simple to be implemented, the visibility graph-based approach\noffers a promising and effective support to the classical methods for accurate\ntime-series analyses of inhomogeneous turbulent flows.\n", "  We present new analytical three-dimensional solutions of the\nmagnetohydrostatic equations, which are applicable to the co-rotating frame of\nreference outside a rigidly rotating cylindrical body, and have potential\napplications to planetary magnetospheres and stellar coronae. We consider the\ncase with centrifugal force only, and use a transformation method in which the\ngoverning equation for the \"pseudo-potential\" (from which the magnetic field\ncan be calculated) becomes the Laplace partial differential equation. The new\nsolutions extend the set of previously found solutions to those of a\n\"fractional multipole\" nature, and offer wider possibilities for modelling than\nbefore. We consider some special cases, and present example solutions.\n", "  We review the general aspects of the concept of temperature in equilibrium\nand non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Although temperature is an old and\nwell-established notion, it still presents controversial facets. After a short\nhistorical survey of the key role of temperature in thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics, we tackle a series of issues which have been recently\nreconsidered. In particular, we discuss different definitions and their\nrelevance for energy fluctuations. The interest in such a topic has been\ntriggered by the recent observation of negative temperatures in condensed\nmatter experiments. Moreover, the ability to manipulate systems at the micro\nand nano-scale urges to understand and clarify some aspects related to the\nstatistical properties of small systems (as the issue of temperature's\n\"fluctuations\"). We also discuss the notion of temperature in a dynamical\ncontext, within the theory of linear response for Hamiltonian systems at\nequilibrium and stochastic models with detailed balance, and the generalised\nfluctuation-response relations, which provide a hint for an extension of the\ndefinition of temperature in far-from-equilibrium systems. To conclude we\nconsider non-Hamiltonian systems, such as granular materials, turbulence and\nactive matter, where a general theoretical framework is still lacking.\n", "  The search for novel phases of matter is a central theme of modern physics,\nwith some of the most intriguing examples provided by the spin liquids found in\nmagnets with competing, or \"frustrated\" interactions. Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$,\na novel spin-$1/2$ magnet with a bilayer breathing-kagome lattice, has\nproperties which differ from from any known spin liquid. However, understanding\nCa$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ presents a significant challenge, because of its\ncomplex frustration. Here we use large-scale molecular-dynamics simulation to\nexplore the origin of spin-liquid behaviour in Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$. We\nuncover qualitatively different behaviour on different timescales, and argue\nthat ground state of Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$ is born out of a\nslowly-fluctuating \"spiral spin liquid\", while faster fluctuations echo the\nU(1) spin liquid found in the kagome antiferromagnet. These results provide a\nconcrete scenario for spin-liquid behaviour in Ca$_{10}$Cr$_7$O$_{28}$, and\nhighlight the possibility of spin liquids existing on multiple timescales.\n", "  We study ionic liquids composed 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations and\nbis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide anions ([C$_n$MIm][NTf$_2$]) with varying\nchain-length $n\\!=\\!2, 4, 6, 8$ by using molecular dynamics simulations. We\nshow that a reparametrization of the dihedral potentials as well as charges of\nthe [NTf$_2$] anion leads to an improvment of the force field model introduced\nby K\\\"oddermann {\\em et al.} [ChemPhysChem, \\textbf{8}, 2464 (2007)] (KPL-force\nfield). A crucial advantage of the new parameter set is that the minimum energy\nconformations of the anion ({\\em trans} and {\\em gauche}), as deduced from {\\em\nab initio} calculations and {\\sc Raman} experiments, are now both well\nrepresented by our model. In addition, the results for [C$_n$MIm][NTf$_2$] show\nthat this modification leads to an even better agreement between experiment and\nmolecular dynamics simulation as demonstrated for densities, diffusion\ncoefficients, vaporization enthalpies, reorientational correlation times, and\nviscosities. Even though we focused on a better representation of the anion\nconformation, also the alkyl chain-length dependence of the cation behaves\ncloser to the experiment. We strongly encourage to use the new NGKPL force\nfield for the [NTf$_2$] anion instead of the earlier KPL parameter set for\ncomputer simulations aiming to describe the thermodynamics, dynamics and also\nstructure of imidazolium based ionic liquids.\n", "  After a brief presentation of Feynman diagrams, we criticizise the idea that\nFeynman diagrams can be considered to be pictures or depictions of actual\nphysical processes. We then show that the best interpretation of the role they\nplay in quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics is captured by Hughes'\nDenotation, Deduction and Interpretation theory of models (DDI), where models\nare to be interpreted as inferential, non-representational devices constructed\nin given social contexts by the community of physicists.\n", "  Magnetic spinels (with chemical formula $AX_{2}$O$_{4}$, with $X$ a 3$d$\ntransition metal ion) that also have an orbital degeneracy are Jahn-Teller\nactive and hence possess a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of\nfreedom. At high temperatures, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is a cubic spinel based on\nV$^{3+}$ ions with a spin $S$=1 and a triply degenerate orbital ground state. A\nstructural transition occurs at T$_{OO}$=63 K to an orbitally ordered phase\nwith a tetragonal unit cell followed by an antiferromagnetic transition of\nT$_{N}$=42 K on cooling. We apply neutron spectroscopy in single crystals of\nMgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ to show an anomaly for intermediate wavevectors at T$_{OO}$\nassociated with the acoustic phonon sensitive to the shear elastic modulus\n$\\left(C_{11}-C_{12}\\right)/2$. On warming, the shear mode softens for momentum\ntransfers near close to half the Brillouin zone boundary, but recovers near the\nzone centre. High resolution spin-echo measurements further illustrate a\ntemporal broadening with increased temperature over this intermediate range of\nwavevectors, indicative of a reduction in phonon lifetime. A subtle shift in\nphonon frequencies over the same range of momentum transfers is observed with\nmagnetic fields. We discuss this acoustic anomaly in context of coupling to\norbital and charge fluctuations.\n", "  It is well known that related with the irreducible representations of the Lie\ngroup $SO(2)$ we find a discrete basis as well a continuous one. In this paper\nwe revisited this situation under the light of Rigged Hilbert spaces, which are\nthe suitable framework to deal with both discrete and bases in the same context\nand in relation with physical applications.\n", "  Energy harvesting is the fundamental activity in almost all forms of space\nexploration known to humans. So far, in most cases, it is not feasible to\nbring, along with probe, spacecraft or rover suitable supply of fuel to cover\nall mission's energy needs. Some concepts of mining or other form of\nmanufacturing of fuel on exploration site have been made, but they still base\neither on some facility that needs one mean of energy to generate fuel, perhaps\nof better quality, or needs some initial energy to be harvested to start a self\nsustaining cycle. Following paper summarizes key factors that determine\nsatellite energy needs, and explains some either most widespread or most\ninteresting examples of energy harvesting devices, present in Earth orbit as\nwell as exploring Solar System and, very recently, beyond. Some of presented\nenergy harvester are suitable for very large (in terms of size and\nfunctionality) probes, other fit and scale easily on satellites ranging from\ndozens of tons to few grams.\n", "  In order to obtain significant improvements in the Power Conversion\nEfficiency (PCE) of solar cells, researchers should know in the future which\nmaterial properties and cell design constitute cells with the highest possible\nefficiency. Such knowledge can be obtained by simulations and numerical\noptimizations of the cells PCE, which is shown for a Perovskite Solar Cell\n(PSC) in a multidimensional variable space. By use of a sensitivity analysis,\nbased on the analytical model of a PSC, it is shown that its efficiency is a\nnonlinear function of several variables in a multidimensional hypercube space.\nThe numerical optimization presented increases the PCE from initially 15.7 % to\n27.6 % in a nine-dimensional function space of material properties and absorber\nlayer thickness. Here the combined variable specification necessary to obtain\nsuch a high efficiency is presented, and it is discussed how the manufacturing\ncan be improved in order to successfully increase the cells PCE.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological constant problem in the light of dilatation\nsymmetry and its possible anomaly. For dilatation symmetric quantum theories\nrealistic asymptotic cosmology is obtained provided the effective potential has\na non-trivial minimum. For theories with dilatation anomaly one needs as a\nnon-trivial \"cosmon condition\" that the energy-momentum tensor in the vacuum is\npurely anomalous. Such a condition is related to the short-distance\nrenormalization group behavior of the fundamental theory. Observable deviations\nfrom the standard hot big bang cosmology are possible.\n", "  The paper considers direction of arrival (DOA) estimation from long-term\nobservations in a noisy environment. In such an environment the noise source\nmight evolve, causing the stationary models to fail. Therefore a\nheteroscedastic Gaussian noise model is introduced where the variance can vary\nacross observations and sensors. The source amplitudes are assumed independent\nzero-mean complex Gaussian distributed with unknown variances (i.e. the source\npowers), inspiring stochastic maximum likelihood DOA estimation. The DOAs of\nplane waves are estimated from multi-snapshot sensor array data using sparse\nBayesian learning (SBL) where the noise is estimated across both sensors and\nsnapshots. This SBL approach is more flexible and performs better than\nhigh-resolution methods since they cannot estimate the heteroscedastic noise\nprocess. An alternative to SBL is simple data normalization, whereby only the\nphase across the array is utilized. Simulations demonstrate that taking the\nheteroscedastic noise into account improves DOA estimation.\n", "  Double beta decay of $^{116}$Cd has been investigated with the help of\nradiopure enriched $^{116}$CdWO$_4$ crystal scintillators in the experiment\nAurora. The half-life of $^{116}$Cd relatively to the 2$\\nu$2$\\beta$ decay of\n$^{116}$Cd to the ground level of $^{116}$Sn is measured with the highest\nup-to-date accuracy as $T_{1/2}$ = [2.69 $\\pm$ 0.02 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.14 (syst.)]\n$\\times$ 10$^{19}$ yr. A new improved limit on the 0$\\nu$2$\\beta$ decay of\n$^{116}$Cd to the ground state of $^{116}$Sn is set as $T_{1/2}\\geq 2.4 \\times\n10^{23}$ yr at 90\\% C.L., that corresponds to the effective Majorana neutrino\nmass limit in the range $\\langle$$m_\\nu$$\\rangle$ $\\le$ $(1.1-1.6)$ eV,\ndepending on the nuclear matrix elements used in the estimations. New improved\nlimits on other $2\\beta$ processes in $^{116}$Cd (decays with majoron emission,\ntransitions to excited levels of $^{116}$Sn) were set at the level of\n$T_{1/2}\\geq 10^{21}-10^{22}$ yr.\n", "  Using combined magnetometry and ferromagnetic resonance studies, it is shown\nthat introduction of a hydrocarbon cover layer leads to an increase of the\ncontribution of the surface anisotropy to the effective magnetic anisotropy\nenergy of hexagonal close-packed 0001 cobalt films, largely enhancing the\nperpendicular anisotropy. Due to a weak electronic interaction of the organic\nmolecules with the Co atoms, an increase of surface anisotropy could be\nexplained by the presence of an electric field at the organic-material/Co\ninterface and by modification of surface atoms charge configuration.\n", "  Neutron scattering played an important role in the experimental exploration\nof the theoretical ideas of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, who won the\nNobel Prize in Physics in 2016. This article reviews the signatures of\nHaldane's predicted topological quantum ground state and their observation in\nearly neutron scattering experiments, which overturned the wisdom of the day.\n", "  Since 1925, exactly four arguments have been forwarded for the assumption of\na diverging (respectively --- after regularization --- very huge) zero-point\nenergy of elementary quantum fields. And exactly three arguments have been\nforwarded against this assumption. In this article, all seven arguments are\nreviewed and assessed. It turns out that the three CONTRA arguments against the\nassumption of that zero-point energy are overwhelmingly stronger than the four\nPRO arguments.\n", "  Single crystal, nanoscale diamond membranes are highly sought after for a\nvariety of applications including nanophotonics, nanoelectronics and quantum\ninformation science. However, so far, the availability of conductive diamond\nmembranes remained an unreachable goal. In this work we present a complete\nnanofabrication methodology for engineering high aspect ratio, electrically\nactive single crystal diamond membranes. The membranes have large lateral\ndirections, exceeding 500x500 um2 and are only several hundreds of nanometers\nthick. We further realize vertical single crystal p-n junctions, made from the\ndiamond membranes that exhibit onset voltages of ~ 10V and a current of several\nmA. Moreover, we deterministically introduce optically active color centers\ninto the membranes, and demonstrate for the first time a single crystal\nnanoscale diamond LED. The robust and scalable approach to engineer the\nelectrically active single crystal diamond membranes, offers new pathways for\nadvanced nanophotonics, nanoelectronics and optomechanics devices employing\ndiamond.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires offer the possibility to grow high-quality\nquantum-dot heterostructures, and, in particular, CdSe quantum dots inserted in\nZnSe nanowires have demonstrated the ability to emit single photons up to room\ntemperature. In this paper, we demonstrate a bottom-up approach to fabricate a\nphotonic fiberlike structure around such nanowire quantum dots by depositing an\noxide shell using atomic-layer deposition. Simulations suggest that the\nintensity collected in our NA = 0.6 microscope objective can be increased by a\nfactor 7 with respect to the bare nanowire case. Combining\nmicrophotoluminescence, decay time measurements, and numerical simulations, we\nobtain a fourfold increase in the collected photoluminescence from the quantum\ndot. We show that this improvement is due to an increase of the quantum-dot\nemission rate and a redirection of the emitted light. Our ex situ fabrication\ntechnique allows a precise and reproducible fabrication on a large scale. Its\nimproved extraction efficiency is compared to state-of-the-art top-down\ndevices.\n", "  The work presents the analysis of the free boundary value problem related to\nthe invasion model of new species in biofilm reactors. In the framework of\ncontinuum approach to mathematical modelling of biofilm growth, the problem\nconsists of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations\ngoverning the microbial species growth and a system of semi-linear elliptic\npartial differential equations describing the substrate trends. The model is\ncompleted with a system of elliptic partial differential equations governing\nthe diffusion and reaction of planktonic cells, which are able to switch their\nmode of growth from planktonic to sessile when specific environmental\nconditions are found. Two systems of nonlinear differential equations for the\nsubstrate and planktonic cells mass balance within the bulk liquid are also\nconsidered. The free boundary evolution is governed by a differential equation\nthat accounts for detachment. The qualitative analysis is performed and a\nuniqueness and existence result is discussed. Furthermore, two special models\nof biological and engineering interest are discussed numerically. The invasion\nof Anammox bacteria in a constituted biofilm inhabiting the deammonification\nunits of the wastewater treatment plants is simulated. Numerical simulations\nare run to evaluate the influence of the colonization process on biofilm\nstructure and activity.\n", "  CPT and Lorentz violation in the photon sector is described within the\nminimal Standard-Model Extension by a dimension-3 Chern-Simons-like operator\nparametrized by a four-vector parameter $k_{AF}$ that has been very tightly\nbounded by astrophysical observations. On the other hand, in the context of the\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ electroweak gauge sector of the Standard-Model Extension,\nCPT and Lorentz violation is described similarly, by dimension-3 operators\nparametrized by four-vector parameters $k_1$ and $k_2$. In this work, we\ninvestigate in detail the effects of the resulting CPT and Lorentz violation in\nthe photon and $Z$-boson sectors upon electroweak-symmetry breaking. In\nparticular, we show that for the photon sector the relevant Lorentz-violating\neffects are described at lowest order by the $k_{AF}$ term, but that there are\nhigher-order momentum-dependent effects due to photon-$Z$ boson mixing. As\nbounds on CPT and Lorentz violation in the $Z$ sector are relatively weak,\nthese effects could be important phenomenologically. We investigate these\neffects in detail in this work.\n", "  We demonstrate significantly improved performance of a microwave true time\ndelay line (TTDL) based on an integrated micro-ring resonator (MRR) Kerr\noptical comb source with a channel spacing of 49GHz, corresponding to 81\nchannels over the C-band. The broadband microcomb, with a record low free\nspectral range of 49GHz, results in a large number of comb lines for the TTDL,\ngreatly reducing the size, cost, and complexity of the system. The large\nchannel count results in a high angular resolution and wide beam steering\ntunable range of the phased array antenna (PAA). The enhancement of PAA\nperformance matches well with theory, corroborating the feasibility of our\napproach as a competitive solution towards implementing compact low-cost TTDL\nin radar and communications systems.\n", "  With the advent of very powerful particle accelerators, such as RHIC and the\nLHC, it becomes possible to study QCD in high energy collisions, in which the\ngluon content of the proton or nucleus is probed and its density becomes often\nlarge enough for nonlinear effects to play a role. This small-x regime of QCD\nis well described by an effective theory known as the Color Glass Condensate\n(CGC). In this thesis, we introduce the CGC and apply it to two different\nproblems.\n  First, we use the CGC to study forward heavy-quark production in pA\ncollisions. When the quarks are nearly back-to-back, the CGC result coincides\nwith the one in the TMD factorization approach. This allows us to extract the\nsmall-x limit of the Weizs\\\"acker-Williams gluon distribution, as well as the\ndipole distribution and one extra gluon TMD. Each of these gluon TMDs is\naccompanied by a partner, which couples via the quark mass and which describes\nthe linearly polarized gluon content of the unpolarized nucleus. We calculate\nthe six resulting gluon TMDs analytically in the MV model, and evolve them in\nrapidity using a numerical implementation of JIMWLK.\n  The second problem is situated within heavy-ion physics. Jets, produced in\nthe scattering of two nuclei, travel through the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nbefore reaching the detector, and are attenuated as a result of their\ninteraction with this medium. This phenomenon, known as jet quenching, is one\nof the main probes to investigate the QGP. We focus on the transverse momentum\nbroadening of a hard particle traveling through a nuclear medium, and employ\nsmall-x techniques to attempt to resum the leading logarithmic corrections due\nto soft gluon radiation. Although, ultimately, we can only solve the resulting\nin-medium evolution equation to DLA accuracy, we do present a concise framework\nfor the problem, and draw a detailed comparison with the CGC and with the\nliterature.\n", "  By performing spectroscopic single-particle measurements at cryogenic\ntemperatures over the course of hours we study %By performing spectroscopic\nlongtime single-particle measurements at cryogenic temperatures we study both\nthe spectral diffusion as well as the diffusion of the decay rates of the\nfluorescence emission of core/shell CdSe/CdS dot/rod nanoparticles. A special\nanalysis of the measurements allow for a correlation of data for single neutral\nexcitons only, undisturbed by the possible emission of other excitonic\ncomplexes. We find a nearly linear dependency of the fluorescence decay rate on\nthe emission energy. The experimental data is compared to self-consistent model\ncalculations within the effective-mass approximation, in which migrating point\ncharges set onto the surface of the nanoparticles have been assumed to cause\nthe temporal changes of optical properties. These calculations reveal a nearly\nlinear relationship between the squared electron-hole wave function overlap,\nwhich is linked to the experimentally determined fluorescence rate, and the\nexciton emission energy. Within our model single migrating surface charges are\nnot sufficient to fully explain the measured rather broad ranges of emission\nrates and energies, while two -- and in particular negative -- surface charges\nclose to the core of the DR induce large enough shifts. Importantly, for our\nnanoparticle system, the surface charges more strongly affect the hole wave\nfunction than the electron wave function and both wave functions are still\nlocalized within the dot-like core of the nanoparticle, showing that the type-I\ncharacter of the band alignment between core and shell is preserved.\n", "  This work presents EddyNet, a deep learning based architecture for automated\neddy detection and classification from Sea Surface Height (SSH) maps provided\nby the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). EddyNet is\na U-Net like network that consists of a convolutional encoder-decoder followed\nby a pixel-wise classification layer. The output is a map with the same size of\nthe input where pixels have the following labels \\{'0': Non eddy, '1':\nanticyclonic eddy, '2': cyclonic eddy\\}. We investigate the use of SELU\nactivation function instead of the classical ReLU+BN and we use an overlap\nbased loss function instead of the cross entropy loss.

It is commonly believed that the conductance is\ndetermined by the long-wave component. The CDW component is considered only\nwhen an impurity is present. We investigate the contribution of this component\nto the dynamic density response of a Luttinger liquid free from impurities. We\nshow that the conventional form of the CDW density operator does not conserve\nthe number of particles in the system. We propose the corrected CDW density\noperator devoid of this shortcoming and calculate the dissipative conductance\nin the case when the one-dimensional conductor is locally disturbed by a\nconducting probe. The contribution of the CDW component to conductance is found\nto dominate over that of the long-wave component in the low-frequency regime.\n"]}
