It is not a string\ntheory, nor loop quantum gravity, but is instead a traditional quantum field\ntheory that breaks Lorentz invariance at ultra-high (presumably\ntrans-Planckian) energies, while retaining approximate Lorentz invariance at\nlow and medium (sub-Planckian) energies. The challenge is to keep the Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking controlled and small - small enough to be compatible with\nexperiment. I will give a very general overview of what is going on in this\nfield, paying particular attention to the disturbing role of the scalar\ngraviton.\n", "  The structure in density and temperature of protoplanetary disks surrounding\nlow-mass stars is not yet well known. The protoplanetary disks mid-planes are\nexpected to be very cold and thus depleted in molecules in gas phase,\nespecially CO. Recent observations of molecules at very low apparent\ntemperature (~ 6 K) challenge this current picture of the protoplanetary disk\nstructures. We aim at constraining the physical conditions, and in particular\nthe gas-phase CO abundance in the mid-plane of protoplanetary disks. The light\nmolecule H2D+,is a tracer of cold and CO-depleted environment. It is therefore\na good candidate to explore the disks mid-planes. We performed a deep search\nfor H2D+ in the two well-known disks surrounding TW Hya and DM Tau using the\nAPEX and JCMT telescopes. The analysis of the observations are done with\nDISKFIT, a radiative transfer code dedicated to disks. In addition, we used a\nchemical model describing deuterium chemistry to infer the implications of our\nobservations on the level of CO depletion and on the ionization rate in the\ndisks mid-plane. The ortho-H2D+(1(1,0))-1(1,1)) line at 372 GHz was not\ndetected. Although our limit is three times better than previous observations,\ncomparison with the chemical modeling indicates that it remains insufficient to\nput valuable constraints on the CO abundance in the disk mid-plane. Even with\nALMA, the detection of H2D+ may not be straightforward, and H2D+ may not be a\nsufficiently sensitive tracer of the protoplanetary disks mid-plane\n", "  We study the formulation of statistical mechanics on noncommutative classical\nphase space, and construct the corresponding canonical ensemble theory. For\nillustration, some basic and important examples are considered in the framework\nof noncommutative statistical mechanics: such as the ideal gas, the extreme\nrelativistic gas, and the 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n", "  Entropic forces have recently attracted considerable attention as ways to\nreformulate, retrodict, and perhaps even \"explain'\" classical Newtonian gravity\nfrom a rather specific thermodynamic perspective. In this article I point out\nthat if one wishes to reformulate classical Newtonian gravity in terms of an\nentropic force, then the fact that Newtonian gravity is described by a\nconservative force places significant constraints on the form of the entropy\nand temperature functions. (These constraints also apply to entropic\nreinterpretations of electromagnetism, and indeed to any conservative force\nderivable from a potential.)\n  The constraints I will establish are sufficient to present real and\nsignificant problems for any reasonable variant of Verlinde's entropic gravity\nproposal, though for technical reasons the constraints established herein do\nnot directly impact on either Jacobson's or Padmanabhan's versions of entropic\ngravity. In an attempt to resolve these issues, I will extend the usual notion\nof entropic force to multiple heat baths with multiple \"temperatures'\" and\nmultiple \"entropies\".\n", "  In a pair of recent articles [PRL 105 (2010) 041302 - arXiv:1005.1132; JHEP\n1103 (2011) 056 - arXiv:1012.2867] two of the current authors have developed an\nentropy bound for equilibrium uncollapsed matter using only classical general\nrelativity, basic thermodynamics, and the Unruh effect. An odd feature of that\nbound, S <= A/2, was that the proportionality constant, 1/2, was weaker than\nthat expected from black hole thermodynamics, 1/4. In the current article we\nstrengthen the previous results by obtaining a bound involving the (suitably\naveraged) w parameter. Simple causality arguments restrict this averaged <w>\nparameter to be <= 1. When equality holds, the entropy bound saturates at the\nvalue expected based on black hole thermodynamics. We also add some clarifying\ncomments regarding the (net) positivity of the chemical potential. Overall, we\nfind that even in the absence of any black hole region, we can nevertheless get\narbitrarily close to the Bekenstein entropy.\n", "  Recent tentative experimental indications, and the subsequent theoretical\nspeculations, regarding possible violations of Lorentz invariance have\nattracted a vast amount of attention. An important technical issue that\nconsiderably complicates detailed calculations in any such scenario, is that\nonce one violates Lorentz invariance the analysis of thresholds in both\nscattering and decay processes becomes extremely subtle, with many new and\nnaively unexpected effects. In the current article we develop several extremely\ngeneral threshold theorems that depend only on the existence of some energy\nmomentum relation E(p), eschewing even assumptions of isotropy or monotonicity.\nWe shall argue that there are physically interesting situations where such a\nlevel of generality is called for, and that existing (partial) results in the\nliterature make unnecessary technical assumptions. Even in this most general of\nsettings, we show that at threshold all final state particles move with the\nsame 3-velocity, while initial state particles must have 3-velocities\nparallel/anti-parallel to the final state particles. In contrast the various\n3-momenta can behave in a complicated and counter-intuitive manner.\n", "  We study the self-focusing dynamics and collapse of vortex Airy optical beams\nin a Kerr medium. The collapse is suppressed compared to a non- vortex Airy\nbeam in a Kerr medium as a result of the existence of vortex fields. The\nlocations of collapse depend sensitively on the initial power, vortex order,\nand modulation parameters. Unlike the collapses reported before for any beam,\nthe collapse may occur in a position where the initial field is nearly zero\nwhile no collapse appears in the region where the initial field is mainly\ndistributed. This study sheds light on how to control and manipulate the\nlocation of collapse based on the initial power, vortex order and modulation\nparameter.\n", "  Aperture synthesis instruments providing a generally highly uniform sampling\nof the visibility function often leave an unsampled hole near the origin of the\n(u,v)-plane. In this paper, originally published in 1979, we first describe the\ncommon solution of retrieving the information from scans made with a large\nsingle-dish telescope. However, this is not the only means by which short\nspacing visibility data can be obtained. We propose an alternative technique\nthat employs a short-baseline interferometer to scan the entire primary beam\narea. The obvious advantage is that a short-baseline pair from the synthesis\ninstrument can be used, ensuring uniformity in instrumental characteristics.\nThis technique is the basis for the mosaicing algorithms now commonly used in\naperture synthesis radio astronomy imaging.\n", "  In this paper we propose a generalization of the Gilkey-de Witt heat kernel\nexpansion, designed to provide us with a precise estimation of the heat trace\nof non-negative Schroedinger type differential operators with non-trivial\nkernel over all the domain of its \"inverse temperature\" variable. We apply this\nmodified approach to compute effectively the one-loop kink mass shift for some\nmodels whose kink fluctuation operator spectrum is unknown and the only\nalternative to estimate this magnitude is the use of the heat kernel expansion\ntechniques.\n", "  Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations was originally\napplied only to local Rindler horizons. But at least some parts of that\nconstruction can usefully be extended to give meaningful results for arbitrary\nbifurcate null surfaces. As presaged in Jacobson's original article, this more\ngeneral construction sharply brings into focus the questions: Is entropy\nobjectively \"real\"? Or is entropy in some sense subjective and\nobserver-dependent?\n  These innocent questions open a Pandora's box of often inconclusive debate. A\nconsensus opinion, though certainly not universally held, seems to be that\nClausius entropy (thermodynamic entropy, defined via a Clausius relation dS =\ndQ/T) should be objectively real, but that the ontological status of\nstatistical entropy (Shannon or von Neumann entropy) is much more ambiguous,\nand much more likely to be observer-dependent. This question is particularly\npressing when it comes to understanding Bekenstein entropy (black hole\nentropy). To perhaps further add to the confusion, we shall argue that even the\nClausius entropy can often be observer-dependent. In the current article we\nshall conclusively demonstrate that one can meaningfully assign a notion of\nClausius entropy to arbitrary bifurcate null surfaces --- effectively defining\na \"virtual Clausius entropy\" for arbitrary \"virtual (local) causal horizons\".\n  As an application, we see that we can implement a version of the generalized\nsecond law (GSL) for this virtual Clausius entropy. This version of GSL can be\nrelated to certain (nonstandard) integral variants of the null energy condition\n(NEC). Because the concepts involved are rather subtle, we take some effort in\nbeing careful and explicit in developing our framework. In future work we will\napply this construction to generalize Jacobson's derivation of the Einstein\nequations.\n", "  In this paper quantum effects are investigated in a very special two-scalar\nfield model having a moduli space of BPS topological defects. In a\n$(1+1)$-dimensional space-time the defects are classically degenerate in mass\nkinks, but in $(3+1)$ dimensions the kinks become BPS domain walls, all of them\nsharing the same surface tension at the classical level. The heat kernel/zeta\nfunction regularization method will be used to control the divergences induced\nby the quantum kink and domain wall fluctuations. A generalization of the\nGilkey-DeWitt-Avramidi heat kernel expansion will be developed in order to\naccommodate the infrared divergences due to zero modes in the spectra of the\nsecond-order kink and domain wall fluctuation operators, which are respectively\n$N\\times N$ matrix ordinary or partial differential operators. Use of these\ntools in the spectral zeta function associated with the Hessian operators paves\nthe way to obtain general formulas for the one-loop kink mass and domain wall\ntension shifts in any $(1+1)$- or $(3+1)$-dimensional $N$-component scalar\nfield theory model. Application of these formulae to the BPS kinks or domain\nwalls of the $N=2$ model mentioned above reveals the breaking of the classical\nmass or surface tension degeneracy at the quantum level. Because the main\nparameter distinguishing each member in the BPS kink or domain wall moduli\nspace is essentially the distance between the centers of two basic kinks or\nwalls, the breaking of the degeneracy amounts to the surge in quantum-induced\nforces between the two constituent topological defects. The differences in\nsurface tension induced by one-loop fluctuations of BPS walls give rise mainly\nto attractive forces between the constituent walls except if the two basic\nwalls are very far apart. Repulsive forces between two close walls only arise\nif the coupling is approaches the critical value from below.\n", "  A mass of traces of human activities show diverse dynamic patterns. In this\npaper, we comprehensively investigate the dynamic pattern of human attention\ndefined by the quantity of interests on subdisciplines in an online academic\ncommunication forum. Both the expansion and exploration of human attention have\na power-law scaling relation with browsing actions, of which the exponent is\nclose to that in one-dimension random walk. Furthermore, the memory effect of\nhuman attention is characterized by the power-law distributions of both the\nreturn interval time and return interval steps, which is reinforced by studying\nthe attention shift that monotonically increase with the interval order between\npairs of continuously segmental sequences of expansion. At last, the observing\ndynamic pattern of human attention in the browsing process is analytically\ndescribed by a dynamic model whose generic mechanism is analogy to that of\nhuman spatial mobility. Thus, our work not only enlarges the research scope of\nhuman dynamics, but also provides an insight to understand the relationship\nbetween the interest transitivity in online activities and human spatial\nmobility in real world.\n", "  We revisit the model proposed earlier to account for the observed increase in\nthe positron fraction in cosmic rays with increasing energy, in the light of\nnew data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) experiment. The model\naccounts for the production and acceleration of secondary electrons and\npositrons in nearby supernova remnants which results in an additional, harder\ncomponent that becomes dominant at high energies. By fitting this to AMS-02\ndata we can calculate the expected concomitant rise of the boron-to-carbon\nratio, as well as of the fraction of antiprotons. If these predictions are\nconfirmed by the forthcoming AMS-02 data it would conclusively rule out all\nother proposed explanations, in particular dark matter annihilations or decays.\n", "  Spurred by the discovery of numerous exoplanets in multiple systems, binaries\nhave become in recent years one of the main topics in planet formation\nresearch. Numerous studies have investigated to what extent the presence of a\nstellar companion can affect the planet formation process. Such studies have\nimplications that can reach beyond the sole context of binaries, as they allow\nto test certain aspects of the planet formation scenario by submitting them to\nextreme environments. We review here the current understanding on this complex\nproblem. We show in particular how each of the different stages of the\nplanet-formation process is affected differently by binary perturbations. We\nfocus especially on the intermediate stage of kilometre-sized planetesimal\naccretion, which has proven to be the most sensitive to binarity and for which\nthe presence of some exoplanets observed in tight binaries is difficult to\nexplain by in-situ formation following the \"standard\" planet-formation\nscenario. Some tentative solutions to this apparent paradox are presented. The\nlast part of our review presents a thorough description of the problem of\nplanet habitability, for which the binary environment creates a complex\nsituation because of the presence of two irradation sources of varying\ndistance.\n", "  Non-linear sigma models with scalar fields taking values on\n$\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^n$ complex manifolds are addressed. In the simplest $n=1$\ncase, where the target manifold is the $\\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere, we describe the\nscalar fields by means of stereographic maps. In this case when the\n$\\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry is gauged and Maxwell and mass terms are allowed, the\nmodel accommodates stable self-dual vortices of two kinds with different\nenergies per unit length and where the Higgs field winds at the cores around\nthe two opposite poles of the sphere. Allowing for dielectric functions in the\nmagnetic field, similar and richer self-dual vortices of different species in\nthe south and north charts can be found by slightly modifying the potential.\nTwo different situations are envisaged: either the vacuum orbit lies on a\nparallel in the sphere, or one pole and the same parallel form the vacuum\norbit. Besides the self-dual vortices of two species, there exist BPS domain\nwalls in the second case. Replacing the Maxwell contribution of the gauge field\nto the action by the second Chern-Simons secondary class, only possible in\n$(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space-time, new BPS topological defects of two\nspecies appear. Namely, both BPS vortices and domain ribbons in the south and\nthe north charts exist because the vacuum orbit consits of the two poles and\none parallel. Formulation of the gauged $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^2$ model in a\nReference chart shows a self-dual structure such that BPS semi-local vortices\nexist. The transition functions to the second or third charts break the\n$\\mathbb{U}(1)\\times\\mathbb{S}\\mathbb{U}(2)$ semi-local symmetry, but there is\nstill room for standard self-dual vortices of the second species. The same\nstructures encompassing $N$ complex scalar fields are easily generalized to\ngauged $\\mathbb{C}\\mathbb{P}^N$ models.\n", "  The Starobinsky model of modified gravity suggested to explain dark energy\nmay be also considered in the astrophysical context. Recently it has been\npointed out that in contracting regions curvature oscillations around the GR\nvalue may lead to the production of high energy particles which contribute to\nthe cosmic ray flux. We revisit these calculations in the Einstein frame and\nshow that the continuous approximation for the matter density used in the\noriginal calculations is not valid. We show that this problem is generic in\n$F(R)$-gravity models introduced to describe the dark energy. We go beyond the\napproximation and find the rate of particle production to be negligible.\n", "  We argue that an arbitrary general relativistic static anisotropic fluid\nsphere, (static and spherically symmetric but with transverse pressure not\nequal to radial pressure), can nevertheless be successfully mimicked by\nsuitable linear combinations of theoretically attractive and quite simple\nclassical matter: a classical (charged) isotropic perfect fluid, a classical\nelectromagnetic field, and a classical (minimally coupled) scalar field. While\nthe most general decomposition is not unique, a preferred minimal decomposition\ncan be constructed that is unique. We show how the classical energy conditions\nfor the anisotropic fluid sphere can be related to energy conditions for the\nisotropic perfect fluid, electromagnetic field, and scalar field components of\nthe model. Furthermore we show how this decomposition relates to the\ndistribution of both electric charge density and scalar charge density\nthroughout the model. The generalized TOV equation implies that the perfect\nfluid component in this model is automatically in internal equilibrium, with\npressure forces, electric forces, and scalar forces balancing the gravitational\npseudo-force. Consequently, we can build theoretically attractive matter models\nthat can be used to mimic almost any static spherically symmetric spacetime.\n", "  A model (further referred to as the enhanced vector-based model or EVM) for\nelastic bonds in solids, composed of bonded particles is presented. The model\ncan be applied for a description of elastic deformation of rocks, ceramics,\nconcrete, nanocomposites, aerogels and other materials with structural elements\ninteracting via forces and torques. A material is represented as a set of\nparticles (rigid bodies) connected by elastic bonds. Vectors rigidly connected\nwith particles are used for description of particles orientations. Simple\nexpression for potential energy of a bond is proposed. Corresponding forces and\ntorques are calculated. Parameters of the potential are related to\nlongitudinal, transverse (shear), bending, and torsional stiffnesses of the\nbond. It is shown that fitting parameters of the potential allows one to\nsatisfy any values of stiffnesses. Therefore, the model is applicable to bonds\nwith arbitrary length/thickness ratio. Bond stiffnesses are expressed in terms\nof geometrical and elastic properties of the bonds using three models:\nBernoulli-Euler beam, Timoshenko beam, and short elastic cylinder. An approach\nfor validation of numerical implementation of the model is presented.\nValidation is carried out by a comparison of numerical and analytical solutions\nof four test problems for a pair of bonded particles. Benchmark expressions for\nforces and torques in the case of pure tension/compression, shear, bending and\ntorsion of a single bond are derived. This approach allows one to minimize the\ntime required for a numerical implementation of the model.\n  Keywords: granular solid, elastic bond, torque interactions, V-model,\ndiscrete element method, distinct element method, particle dynamics.\n", "  We carry out a series of simulations of G2-type clouds interacting with the\nblack hole at the galactic center, to determine why no large changes in the\nluminosity of Sgr A* were seen, and to determine the nature of G2. We measure\nthe accretion rate from the gas cloud onto Sgr A* for a range of simulation\nparameters, such as cloud structure, background structure, background density,\ngrid resolution, and accretion radius. For a broad range of parameters, the\namount of cloud material accreted is small relative to the amount of background\nmaterial accreted. The total accretion rate is not significantly effected for\nat least 30 years after periapsis. We find that reproducing observations of G2\nlikely requires two components for the object: an extended, cold gas cloud\nresponsible for the Br-gamma emission, and a compact core or dusty stellar\nobject dominating the bolometric luminosity. In simulations, the bolometric and\nX-ray luminosity have a peak lasting from about 1 year before to 1 year after\nperiapsis, a feature not detected in observations. Our simulated Br-gamma\nemission is largely consistent with observations leading up to periapsis, with\na slight increase in luminosity and a large increase in the FWHM of the line\nvelocity. All emission from a gaseous component of G2 should fade rapidly after\nperiapsis and be undetectable after 1 year, due to shock heating and expansion\nof the cloud. Any remaining emission should be from the compact component of\nG2.\n", "  The post-Newtonian formulation of a general class of f(R) theories is set up\nto 3rd order approximation. It turns out that the information of a specific\nform of f(R) gravity is encoded in the Yukawa potential, which is contained in\nthe perturbative expansion of the metric components. Although the Yukawa\npotential is canceled in the 2nd order expression of the effective refraction\nindex of light, detailed analysis shows that the difference of the lensing\neffect between the f(R) gravity and general relativity does appear at the 3rd\norder when $\\sqrt{f''(0)/f'(0)}$ is larger than the distance $d_0$ to the\ngravitational source. However, the difference between these two kinds of\ntheories will disappear in the axially symmetric spacetime region. Therefore\nonly in very rare case the f(R) theories are distinguishable from general\nrelativity by gravitational lensing effect at the 3rd order post-Newtonian\napproximation.\n", "  We characterize phases of the compass ladder model by using degenerate\nperturbation theory, symmetry fractionalization, and numerical techniques.\nThrough degenerate perturbation theory we obtain an effective Hamiltonian for\neach phase of the model, and show that a cluster model and the Ising model\nencapsulate the nature of all phases. In particular, the cluster phase has a\nsymmetry-protected topological order, protected by a specific\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and the Ising phase has a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-breaking order characterized by a local order parameter\nexpressed by the magnetization exponent $0.12\\pm0.01$. The symmetry-protected\ntopological phases inherit all properties of the cluster phases, although we\nshow analytically and numerically that they belong to different classes. In\naddition, we study the one-dimensional quantum compass model, which naturally\nemerges from the compass ladder, and show that a partial symmetry breaking\noccurs upon quantum phase transition. We numerically demonstrate that a local\norder parameter accurately determines the quantum critical point and its\ncorresponding universality class.\n", "  We show that the simplicity constraints, which define the dynamics of spin\nfoam models, imply, and are implied by, the first law of thermodynamics, when\nthe latter is applied to causal diamonds in the quantum spacetime. This result\nreveals an intimate connection between the holographic nature of gravity, as\nreflected by the Bekenstein entropy, and the fact that general relativity and\nother gravitational theories can be understood as constrained topological field\ntheories.\n  To state and derive this correspondence we describe causal diamonds in the\ncausal structure of spin foam histories and generalize arguments given for the\nnear horizon region of black holes by Frodden, Gosh and Perez and Bianchi. This\nallows us to apply a recent argument of Jacobson to show that if a spin foam\nhistory has a semiclassical limit described in terms of a smooth metric\ngeometry, that geometry satisfies the Einstein equations.\n  These results suggest also a proposal for a quantum equivalence principle.\n", "  The noncommutative (NC) framework elaborated by Doplicher, Fredenhagen and\nRoberts (DFR) has a Lorentz invariant spacetime structure in order to be\nconsidered as a candidate to understand the physics of the early Universe. In\nDFR formalism the NC parameter ($\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$) is a coordinate operator in\nan extended Hilbert space and it has a conjugate momentum. Since $x$ and\n$\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ are independent coordinates, the Weyl-Moyal (WM) product can\nbe used in this framework. With these elements, in this work, we have\nconstructed the standard electroweak model. To accomplish this task we have\nbegun with the WM-product basis group of symmetry. After that we have\nintroduced the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the hypercharge in DFR\nframework. The electroweak symmetry breaking was analyzed and the masses of the\nnew bosons were computed. Finally, the gauge symmetry and gauge transformations\nwere discussed.\n", "  We present the results of a study of spectral features and the velocity field\nin the atmosphere and the circumstellar envelope of the hypergiant V1302 Aql,\nthe optical counterpart of the IR source IRC+10420, based on high-resolution\nspectroscopic observations obtained in 2001-2014. We measured radial velocities\nof the following types of lines: forbidden and permitted pure emissions,\nabsorption and emission components of lines of ions, pure absorptions (e.g.,\nHeI, SiII), and interstellar components of the NaI D-lines, KI, and DIBs. The\nheliocentric radial velocity measured for pure absorptions as well as for the\nforbidden and permitted pure emissions is close to the systemic radial velocity\nand equal to Vr=63.7$\\pm$0.3, 65.2$\\pm$0.3, and 62.0$\\pm$0.4 km/s,\nrespectively. Positions of the absorption components of the lines with inverse\nP Cyg profiles are stable and indicate the presence of clumps moving toward the\nstar with a velocity of $\\sim$20 km/s. The average radial velocity of the DIBs\nis Vr(DIB)=4.6$\\pm$0.2 km/s. Comparison of the absorption lines observed in\n2001-2014 and those in earlier data shows no noticeable variations. We conclude\nthat the hypergiant reached a phase of slowing down (or termination) of the\neffective temperature growth and is currently located near the high-temperature\nboundary of the Yellow Void in the Hertszprung-Russell diagramme.\n", "  We assess the applicability of the Wigner function formulation in its present\nform to the chiral Magnetic Effect and noted some issues regarding the\nconservation and the consistency of the electric current in the presence of an\ninhomogeneous and time dependent axial chemical potential. The problems are\nrooted in the ultraviolet divergence of the underlying field theory associated\nwith the axial anomaly and can be fixed with the Pauli-Villars regularization\nof the Wigner function.\n", "  In this work the model is constructed to describe the black hole enclosed in\nthe dust cosmological background in case of zero spatial curvature. This model\nis based on our exact solution of the class of LTB inhomogeneous solutions. We\nconsidered the properties of the model and built the R-T-structure of the\nresulting space-time. It was shown that central region includes the\nSchwarzchild-like black hole. We derived the equations of motion of the test\nparticle from the point of view of the observer comoving with cosmological\nexpansion. We found analytical expressions for observable orbital and radial\nvelocities of the particle and plotted the surface profile of the total\nvelocity in this case. In comoving coordinate frame it is impossible to study\nthe questions concerning the black hole horizon but one can observe the local\nmotion of the particles influenced by the cosmological expansion.\n", "  Recent released Planck data and other astronomical observations show that the\nuniverse may be anisotropic on large scales. This hints a cosmological\nprivileged axis in our anisotropic expanding universe. This paper proceeds a\nmodified redshift in anisotropic cosmological model as $\n1+\\tilde{z}(t,\\hat{\\textbf{p}})=\\frac{a(t_{0)}}{a(t)}(1-A(\\hat{\\textbf{n}}.\\hat{\\textbf{p}}))$\n(where $A$ is the magnitude of anisotropy ,$\\hat{\\textbf{n}}$ is the direction\nof privileged axis, and $\\hat{\\textbf{p}}$ is the direction of each SNe Ia\nsample to galactic coordinates) along with anisotropic parameter\n$\\delta=\\frac{A(\\hat{\\textbf{n}}.\\hat{\\textbf{p}})}{1+A(\\hat{\\textbf{n}}.\\hat{\\textbf{p}})}$.\nThe luminosity distance is expanded with model-independent cosmographic\nparameters as a function of modified redshift $\\tilde{z}$. As the\ntransformation matrix $M(n\\times n)$ is obtained to convert the Taylor series\ncoefficients of isotropic luminosity distance to corresponding anisotropic\nparameters. These results culminate the magnitude of anisotropy about $\\mid\nA\\mid \\simeq 10^{-3}$ and the direction of preferred axis as\n$(l,b)=(297^{-34}_{+34},3^{-28}_{+28})$, which are consistent with other\nstudies in $1-\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  A linear Boltzmann equation is derived in the Boltzmann-Grad scaling for the\ndeterministic dynamics of many interacting particles with random initial data.\nWe study a Rayleigh gas where a tagged particle is undergoing hard-sphere\ncollisions with background particles, which do not interact among each other.\nIn the Boltzmann-Grad scaling, we derive the validity of a linear Boltzmann\nequation for arbitrary long times under moderate assumptions on higher moments\nof the initial distributions of the tagged particle and the possibly\nnon-equilibrium distribution of the background. The convergence of the empiric\ndynamics to the Boltzmann dynamics is shown using Kolmogorov equations for\nassociated probability measures on collision histories.\n", "  Comparing with single networks, the multiplex networks bring two main effects\non the spreading process among individuals. First, the pathogen or information\ncan be transmitted to more individuals through different layers at one time,\nwhich enlarges the spreading scope. Second, through different layers, an\nindividual can also transmit the pathogen or information to the same\nindividuals more than once at one time, which makes the spreading more\neffective. To understand the different roles of the spreading scope and\neffectiveness, we propose an epidemic model on multiplex networks with link\noverlapping, where the spreading effectiveness of each interaction as well as\nthe variety of channels (spreading scope) can be controlled by the number of\noverlapping links. We find that for Poisson degree distribution, increasing the\nepidemic scope (the first effect) is more efficient than enhancing epidemic\nprobability (the second effect) to facilitate the spreading process. However,\nfor power-law degree distribution, the effects of the two factors on the\nspreading dynamics become complicated. Enhancing epidemic probability makes\npathogen or rumor easier to outbreak in a finite system. But after that\nincreasing epidemic scopes is still more effective for a wide spreading.\nTheoretical results along with reasonable explanation for these phenomena are\nall given in this paper, which indicates that the epidemic scope could play an\nimportant role in the spreading dynamics.\n", "  Complete control over the properties of light up to the level of single\nphotons is an invaluable tool for quantum information science and fundamental\nstudies of light-matter interaction. The crucial prerequisite is the ability to\ncreate a spatio-temporal distribution of single-photon electromagnetic field\nwith the desired characteristics, i.e. to shape a photon by design. Despite the\never-growing demand for tuneable single-photon sources, there is a lack of\npractical, efficient and scalable methods for photon shaping. Here we put\nforward a novel generic method that enables lossless shaping of single photons\nwith respect to any degree of freedom or several degrees of freedom\nsimultaneously. Shaping is performed in a heralded manner, which ensures\nflexibility and scalability of the scheme. Our method can be directly\nintegrated with the current technologies: this enables experimental realization\nof numerous proposals involving shaped single photons and opens up\nqualitatively new opportunities in the future.\n", "  In this paper, we obtain luminosity distances by using ages of 32 old passive\ngalaxies distributed over the redshift interval $0.11 < z < 1.84$ and test the\ncosmic conservation of photon number by comparing them with 580 distance moduli\nof type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the so-called Union 2.1 compilation. Our\nanalyses are based on the fact that the method of obtaining ages of galaxies\nrelies on the detailed shape of galaxy spectra but not on galaxy luminosity.\nPossible departures from cosmic conservation of photon number is parametrized\nby $\\tau(z) = 2 \\epsilon z$ and $\\tau(z) = \\epsilon z/(1+z)$ (for $\\epsilon =0$\nthe conservation of photon number is recovered). We find\n$\\epsilon=0.016^{+0.078}_{-0.075}$ from the first parametrization and\n$\\epsilon=-0.18^{+0.25}_{-0.24}$ from the second parametrization, both limits\nat 95\\% c.l. In this way, no significant departure from cosmic conservation of\nphoton number is verified. In addition, by considering the total age as\ninferred from Planck (2015) analysis, we find the incubation time\n$t_{inc}=1.66\\pm0.29$ Gyr and $t_{inc}=1.23\\pm0.27$ Gyr at 68\\% c.l. for each\nparametrization, respectively.}\n", "  We compare the fixed-phase approximation with the better known, but closely\nrelated fixed-node approximation on several testing examples. We found that\nboth approximations behave very similarly with the fixed-phase results being\nvery close to the fixed-node method whenever nodes/phase were of high and\ncomparable accuracy. The fixed-phase exhibited larger biases when the trial\nwave functions errors in the nodes/phase were intentionally driven to\nunrealistically large values. We also present a formalism that enables to\ndescribe wave functions with the full antisymmetry in spin-spatial degrees of\nfreedom using our recently developed method for systems with spins as fully\nquantum variables. This opens new possibilities for simulations of fermionic\nsystems in the fixed-phase approximation formalism.\n", "  The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment operates at the Sanford\nUnderground Research Facility to detect nuclear recoils from the hypothetical\nWeakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on a liquid xenon target. Liquid\nxenon typically contains trace amounts of the noble radioactive isotopes\n$^{85}$Kr and $^{39}$Ar that are not removed by the in situ gas purification\nsystem. The decays of these isotopes at concentrations typical of\nresearch-grade xenon would be a dominant background for a WIMP search\nexmperiment. To remove these impurities from the liquid xenon, a\nchromatographic separation system based on adsorption on activated charcoal was\nbuilt. 400 kg of xenon was processed, reducing the average concentration of\nkrypton from 130 ppb to 3.5 ppt as measured by a cold-trap assisted mass\nspectroscopy system. A 50 kg batch spiked to 0.001 g/g of krypton was processed\ntwice and reduced to an upper limit of 0.2 ppt.\n", "  We study a class of potentials $f$ on one sided full shift spaces over finite\nor countable alphabets, called potentials of product type. We obtain explicit\nformulae for the leading eigenvalue, the eigenfunction (which may be\ndiscontinuous) and the eigenmeasure of the Ruelle operator. The uniqueness\nproperty of these quantities is also discussed and it is shown that there\nalways exists a Bernoulli equilibrium state even if $f$ does not satisfy\nBowen's condition. We apply these results to potentials $f:\\{-1,1\\}^\\mathbb{N}\n\\to \\mathbb{R}$ of the form $$\n  f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots)\n  =\n  x_1 + 2^{-\\gamma} \\, x_2 + 3^{-\\gamma} \\, x_3 + ...+n^{-\\gamma} \\, x_n +\n\\ldots\n  $$ with $\\gamma >1$. For $3/2 < \\gamma \\leq 2$, we obtain the existence of\ntwo different eigenfunctions. Both functions are (locally) unbounded and exist\na.s. (but not everywhere) with respect to the eigenmeasure and the measure of\nmaximal entropy, respectively.\n", "  In the light of the recent Planck downward revision of the electron\nscattering optical depth, and of the discovery of a faint AGN population at $z\n> 4$, we reassess the actual contribution of quasars to cosmic reionization. To\nthis aim, we extend our previous MCMC-based data-constrained semi-analytic\nreionization model and study the role of quasars on global reionization\nhistory. We find that, the quasars can alone reionize the Universe only for\nmodels with very high AGN emissivities at high redshift. These models are still\nallowed by the recent CMB data and most of the observations related to HI\nreionization. However, they predict an extended and early HeII reionization\nending at $z\\gtrsim4$ and a much slower evolution in the mean HeII Ly-$\\alpha$\nforest opacity than what the actual observation suggests. Thus when we further\nconstrain our model against the HeII Ly-$\\alpha$ forest data, this\nAGN-dominated scenario is found to be clearly ruled out at 2-$\\sigma$ limits.\nThe data seems to favour a standard two-component picture where quasar\ncontributions become negligible at $z\\gtrsim6$ and a non-zero escape fraction\nof $\\sim10\\%$ is needed from early-epoch galaxies. For such models, mean\nneutral hydrogen fraction decreases to $\\sim10^{-4}$ at $z=6.2$ from $\\sim0.8$\nat $z=10.0$ and helium becomes doubly ionized at much later time, $z\\sim3$. We\nfind that, these models are as well in good agreement with the observed thermal\nevolution of IGM as opposed to models with very high AGN emissivities.\n", "  In this paper zero modes of fluctuation are dissected around the two species\nof BPS vortices existing in the critical Higgs phase, where the scalar and\nvector meson masses are equal, of a gauged $\\mathbb{U}(1)$ nonlinear\n$\\mathbb{CP}^1$-model. If $2\\pi n$, $n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$, is the quantized\nmagnetic flux of the two species of BPS vortex solutions, $2n$ linearly\nindependent vortex zero modes for each species are found and described. The\nexistence of two species of moduli spaces of dimension $2n$ of these stringy\ntopological defects is thus locally shown.\n", "  Tracking experiments in dense biological tissues reveal a diversity of\nsources f or local energy injection at the cell scale. The effect of cell\nmotility has been largely studied, but much less is known abo ut the effect of\nthe observed volume fluctuations of individual cells. We devise a simple\nmicroscopic model of `actively-deforming' particles where local fluctuations of\nthe particle size constitute a unique source of motion. We demonstrate that\ncollective motion can emerge under the sole influence of such active volume\nfluctuations. We interpret the onset of diffusive motion as a nonequilibrium\nfirst-order phase transition, which arises at a well-defined amplitude of\nself-deformation. This behaviour contrasts with the glassy dynamics produced by\nself-propulsion, but resembles the mechanical response of soft solids under\nmechanical deformation. It thus constitutes the first example of active\nyielding transition.\n", "  The surprising discovery of tripling the superconducting critical temperature\nof KFe$_2$As$_2$ at high pressures issued an intriguing question of how the\nsuperconductivity in the collapsed tetragonal phase differs from that in the\nnon-collapsed phases of Fe-based superconductors. Here we report $^{89}$Y\nnuclear magnetic resonance study of YFe$_2$Ge$_{x}$Si$_{2-x}$ compounds whose\nelectronic structure is similar to that of iron-pnictide collapsed tetragonal\nphases already at ambient pressure. Fe(Ge,Si) layers show strong ferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations whereas layers are coupled antiferromagnetically -- both\npositioning the studied family close to a quantum critical point. Next,\nlocalized moments attributed either to Fe interstitial or antisite defects may\naccount for magnetic impurity pair-breaking effects thus explaining the\nsubstantial variation of superconductivity among different YFe$_2$Ge$_2$\nsamples.\n", "  Recent measurements of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions have indicated charge-separation signals perpendicular to\nthe reaction plane, and have been related to the chiral magnetic effect (CME).\nHowever, the correlation signal is contaminated with the background caused by\nthe collective motion (flow) of the collision system, and an effective approach\nis needed to remove the flow background from the correlation. We present a\nmethod study with simplified Monte Carlo simulations and a multi-phase\ntransport model, and develop a scheme to reveal the true CME signal via the\nevent-shape engineering with the flow vector of the particles of interest.\n", "  We generalize our unique continuation results recently established for a\nclass of linear and nonlinear wave equations $\\Box_g \\phi + \\sigma \\phi =\n\\mathcal{G} ( \\phi, \\partial \\phi )$ on asymptotically anti-de Sitter (aAdS)\nspacetimes to aAdS spacetimes admitting non-static boundary metrics. The new\nCarleman estimates established in this setting constitute an essential\ningredient in proving unique continuation results for the full nonlinear\nEinstein equations, which will be addressed in forthcoming papers. Key to the\nproof is a new geometrically adapted construction of foliations of pseudoconvex\nhypersurfaces near the conformal boundary.\n", "  In this paper, we get the holographic equipartition form the first order\nformulism, that is, the connection and its conjugate momentum are considered to\nbe the canonical variables. The final results have similar structure as those\nfrom the metric formulism.\n", "  Recent developments in the techniques of ultrafast pump-probe photoemission\nhave made possible the search for collective modes in strongly correlated\nsystems out of equilibrium. Including inelastic scattering processes and a\nretarded interaction, we simulate time- and angle- resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (trARPES) to study the amplitude mode of a d-wave superconductor,\na collective mode excited through the nonlinear light-matter coupling to the\npump pulse. We find that the amplitude mode oscillations of the d-wave order\nparameter occur in phase at a single frequency that is twice the\nquasi-steady-state maximum gap size after pumping. We comment on the necessary\nconditions for detecting the amplitude mode in trARPES experiments.\n", "  Quantum annealing allows for quantum fluctuations to be used used to assist\nin finding the solution to some of the worlds most challenging computational\nproblems. Recently, this field has attracted much interest because of the\nconstruction of large-scale flux-qubit based quantum annealing devices. There\nhas been recent work on [Chancellor NJP 19(2):023024, 2017] how the control\nprotocols of these devices can be modified so that individual annealer calls on\nreal devices can take initial conditions. Development is being undertaken to\nimplement such protocols in the quantum annealing devices designed by D-Wave\nSystems Inc. and these features will be available to customers soon. In this\npaper, I develop a formalism for algorithmic design in quantum annealers, which\nI call the `inference primitive' formalism. This formalism allows for a natural\ndescription of calls to quantum annealers with a general control structure.\nThis more generalized control structure includes not only the ability to\ninclude initial conditions in an annealer run, but also to control the\nannealing schedules of qubits or clusters of qubits independently, thereby\nrepresenting relative certainty values of different parts of a candidate\nsolution. I discuss the compatability of such controls with a wide variety of\nother current efforts to improve the performance of annealers, such as\nnon-stoquatic drivers, synchronizing freeze times for the qubits, and belief\npropagation techniques. To demonstrate the power of the formalism I present\nhere, I discuss how this new formalism can be used to represent annealer\nimplementations of genetic algorithms, and can represent the addition of\ngenetic components to currently used algorithms. The new tools I develop will\nallow a more complete understanding of the algorithmic space available to\nquantum annealers, and thereby make the field more competitive.\n", "  Despite compelling theoretical arguments, the use of clusters as cosmological\nprobes is, in practice, frequently questioned because of the many uncertainties\nimpinging on cluster mass estimates. Our aim is to develop a fully\nself-consistent cosmological approach of X-ray cluster surveys, exclusively\nbased on observable quantities, rather than masses. This procedure is justified\ngiven the possibility to directly derive the cluster properties via ab initio\nmodelling, either analytically or by using hydrodynamical simulations. In this\nthird paper, we evaluate the method on cluster toy-catalogues. We model the\npopulation of detected clusters in the count-rate -- hardness-ratio -- angular\nsize -- redshift space and compare the corresponding 4-dimensional diagram with\ntheoretical predictions. The best cosmology+physics parameter configuration is\ndetermined using a simple minimisation procedure; errors on the parameters are\nderived by scanning the likelihood hyper-surfaces with a wide range of starting\nvalues. The method allows a simultaneous fit of the cosmological parameters, of\nthe cluster evolutionary physics and of the selection effects. When using\ninformation from the X-ray survey alone plus redshifts, this approach is shown\nto be as accurate as the mass function for the cosmological parameters and to\nperform better for the cluster physics, as modelled in the scaling relations.\nIt enables the identification of degenerate combinations of parameter values.\nGiven the considerably shorter computer times involved for running the\nminimisation procedure in the observed parameter space, this method appears to\nclearly outperform traditional mass-based approaches when X-ray survey data\nalone are available.\n", "  The generation of very high quality electron bunches (high brightness and low\nenergy spread) from a plasma-based accelerator in the three-dimensional blowout\nregime using self-injection in tailored plasma density profiles is analyzed\ntheoretically and with particle-in-cell simulations. The underlying physical\nmechanism that leads to the generation of high quality electrons is uncovered\nby tracking the trajectories of the electrons as they cross the sheath and are\ntrapped by the wake. Details on how the intensity of the driver and the density\nscale-length of the plasma control the ultimate beam quality are described.\nThree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations indicate that this concept has\nthe potential to produce beams with peak brightnesses between $10^{20}$ and\n$10^{21}$ $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{rad}^2$and with absolute projected\nenergy spreads of $\\sim 0.3~\\mathrm{MeV}$ using existing lasers or electron\nbeams to drive nonlinear wakefields.\n", "  In the dynamics of the QCD critical point, the net-baryon fluid, linked to\nthe slow component of the order parameter, relaxes to a 3d Ising system in\nequilibrium. An analytical study of shear and bulk viscosity, with constraints\nimposed by the dynamics of the critical net-baryon fluid, the universality\nproperty and the requirements of a class of strong coupling theories, is\nperformed in the neighbourhood of the critical point. It is found that the\nshear viscosity of the net-baryon fluid is restricted in the domain $1.6\\leq\n4\\pi\\frac{\\eta}{s}\\leq 3.7$ for $T_c < T \\leq 2T_c$ whereas the bulk viscosity\nis small, $4\\pi\\frac{\\zeta}{s} < 0.05$ (for $T>1.27 T_c$) but rising towards\nthe singularity at $T=T_c$.\n", "  We systematically investigate the zero temperature phase diagram of bosons\ninteracting via dipolar interactions in three dimensions in free space via path\nintegral Monte Carlo simulations with few hundreds of particles and periodic\nboundary conditions based on the worm algorithm. Upon increasing the strength\nof the dipolar interaction and at sufficiently high densities we find a wide\nregion where filaments are stabilized along the direction of the external\nfield. Most interestingly by computing the superfluid fraction we conclude that\nsuperfluidity is anisotropic and is greatly suppressed along the orthogonal\nplane. Finally we perform simulations at finite temperature confirming the\nstability of filaments against thermal fluctuations and provide an estimate of\nthe superfluid fraction in the weak coupling limit in the framework of the\nLandau two-fluid model.\n", "  General scenario of turbulence theory is proposed and applied to streaky\nwall-bounded turbulence. This scenario introduces a new field of transverse\nwaves. Significance of the theory rests on a mathematical theorem associated\nwith the conservation law of current flux, expressed in a form of 4d physical\nspace-time representation, which predicts a system of Maxwell-type equation and\nsupports transverse waves traveling with a phase speed c_t. In regard to the\nstreaky wall flows, there exist both dynamical mechanism and energy channel\nwhich excite transverse waves and exchange energy between flow field and wave\nfield. Energy is supplied from the flow field to the wave field if wavelengths\nare sufficiently large. The waves are accompanied with a new mechanism of\nenergy dissipation, an internal friction analogous to the Ohm's effect. Some\npart of the energy is dissipated into heat. Thus, there exists a sustaining\nmechanism, which implies that the streaky structure of wall-bounded turbulence\nis a dissipative structure.\n  The predictions are consistent with experimental observations of wall\nturbulence: (i) Existence of traveling waves: The waves are characterized by\ntwo scales of wavelength and a damping-length d. (ii) Existence of two large\nscales (LSM and VLSM) observed in turbulent shear flows: Those are interpreted\nby the waves amplified with the transient growth mechanism and maintained by\ninteraction with the new transverse wave field. The waves are robust since they\nhave their own energy and momentum. (iii) Enhanced energy dissipation in wavy\nturbulence. Its bulk rate of energy dissipation takes a form resembling the\nmodels of eddy-viscosity, and its coefficient \\nu_D is estimated to be of the\norder of c_t d and much larger than the molecular viscosity.\n  No self-contradiction is incurred by the new field introduced.\n", "  We compute the one-loop corrections to the triple Higgs self-interaction\n$hhh$ in the framework of the Standard Model (SM), the Two Higgs Doublet Model\ntype III (THDM-III) and the Littlest Higgs Model with T parity (LHBM+T). Our\nresults are compared with previous results for the SM. In particular, we find\nthat an imaginary part for the $\\lambda_{hhh}$ form factor is induced when one\nof the Higgs boson legs is off-mass shell with 4-momentum magnitude higher than\nthe Higgs boson mass. This contribution is sensitive to virtual effects of the\nHiggs self-interaction, that induces a radiative correction to the $hhh$\ncoupling of order 11%. However, the radiative corrections associated to the new\ndegrees of freedom of the THDM-III and the LHBM+T are rather smaller and\ncomparable to the $W^\\pm$ and $Z^0$ gauge bosons one-loop corrections.\n", "  Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) harness the intrinsic randomness in\nmeasurement processes: the measurement outputs are truly random given the input\nstate is a superposition of the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In\nthe case of \\emph{trusted} devices, true randomness could be generated from a\nmixed state $\\rho$ so long as the system entangled with $\\rho$ is well\nprotected. We propose a random number generation scheme based on measuring the\nquadrature fluctuations of a single mode thermal state using an optical\nhomodyne detector. By mixing the output of a broadband amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE) source with a single mode local oscillator (LO) at a beam\nsplitter and performing differential photo-detection, we can selectively detect\nthe quadrature fluctuation of a single mode output of the ASE source, thanks to\nthe filtering function of the LO. Experimentally, a quadrature variance about\nthree orders of magnitude larger than the vacuum noise has been observed,\nsuggesting this scheme can tolerate much higher detector noise in comparison\nwith QRNGs based on measuring the vacuum noise. The high quality of this\nentropy source is evidenced by the small correlation coefficients of the\nacquired data. A Toeplitz hashing extractor is applied to generate unbiased\nrandom bits from the Gaussian distributed raw data, achieving an efficiency of\n5.12 bits per sample. The output of the Toeplitz extractor successfully passes\nall the NIST statistical tests for random numbers.\n", "  We investigate the existence of quantum disentangled liquid (QDL) states in\nthe half-filled Hubbard model on bipartite lattices. In the one dimensional\ncase we employ a combination of integrability and strong coupling expansion\nmethods to argue that there are indeed finite energy-density eigenstates that\nexhibit QDL behaviour in the sense of J. Stat. Mech. P10010 (2014). The states\nexhibiting the QDL property are atypical in the sense that while their entropy\ndensity is non-zero, it is smaller than that of thermal states at the same\nenergy density. We argue that for U >> t these latter thermal states exhibit a\nweaker form of the QDL property, which carries over to the higher dimensional\ncase.\n", "  Finding dense bipartite subgraphs and detecting the relations among them is\nan important problem for affiliation networks that arise in a range of domains,\nsuch as social network analysis, word-document clustering, the science of\nscience, internet advertising, and bioinformatics. However, most dense subgraph\ndiscovery algorithms are designed for classic, unipartite graphs. Subsequently,\nstudies on affiliation networks are conducted on the co-occurrence graphs\n(e.g., co-author and co-purchase) that project the bipartite structure to a\nunipartite structure by connecting two entities if they share an affiliation.\nDespite their convenience, co-occurrence networks come at a cost of loss of\ninformation and an explosion in graph sizes, which limit the quality and the\nefficiency of solutions. We study the dense subgraph discovery problem on\nbipartite graphs. We define a framework of bipartite subgraphs based on the\nbutterfly motif (2,2-biclique) to model the dense regions in a hierarchical\nstructure. We introduce efficient peeling algorithms to find the dense\nsubgraphs and build relations among them. We can identify denser structures\ncompared to the state-of-the-art algorithms on co-occurrence graphs in\nreal-world data. Our analyses on an author-paper network and a user-product\nnetwork yield interesting subgraphs and hierarchical relations such as the\ngroups of collaborators in the same institution and spammers that give fake\nratings.\n", "  The emission rate of a point dipole can be strongly increased in presence of\na well-designed optical antenna. Yet, optical antenna design is largely based\non radio-frequency rules, ignoring e.g.~ohmic losses and non-negligible field\npenetration in metals at optical frequencies. Here we combine reciprocity and\nPoynting's theorem to derive a set of optical-frequency antenna design rules\nfor benchmarking and optimizing the performance of optical antennas driven by\nsingle quantum emitters. Based on these findings a novel plasmonic cavity\nantenna design is presented exhibiting a considerably improved performance\ncompared to a reference two-wire antenna. Our work will be useful for the\ndesign of high-performance optical antennas and nanoresonators for diverse\napplications ranging from quantum optics to antenna-enhanced single-emitter\nspectroscopy and sensing.\n", "  (Abridged) The properties of stellar clumps in star forming galaxies and\ntheir evolution over the redshift range $2\\lesssim z \\lesssim 6$ are presented\nand discussed in the context of the build-up of massive galaxies at early\ncosmic times. We use HST/ACS images of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts\nfrom the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to identify clumps within a 20 kpc\nradius. We find that the population of galaxies with more than one clump is\ndominated by galaxies with two clumps, representing $\\sim21-25$\\% of the\npopulation, while the fraction of galaxies with 3, or 4 and more, clumps is\n8-11 and 7-9\\%, respectively. The fraction of clumpy galaxies is in the range\n$\\sim35-55\\%$ over $2<z<6$, increasing at higher redshifts, indicating that the\nfraction of irregular galaxies remains high up to the highest redshifts. The\nlarge and bright clumps (M$_{\\star}\\sim10^9$ up to $\\sim10^{10}$M$_\\odot$) are\nfound to reside predominantly in galaxies with two clumps. Smaller and lower\nluminosity clumps ($\\log_{10}\\left(M_{\\star}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}\\right)<9$) are\nfound in galaxies with three clumps or more. We interpret these results as\nevidence for two different modes of clump formation working in parallel. The\nsmall low luminosity clumps are likely the result of disc fragmentation, with\nviolent disc instabilities (VDI) forming several long-lived clumps in-situ, as\nsuggested from simulations. A fraction of these clumps is also likely coming\nfrom minor mergers. The clumps in the dominating population of galaxies with\ntwo clumps are significantly more massive and have properties akin to those in\nmerging pairs observed at similar redshifts; they appear as more massive than\nthe most massive clumps observed in VDI numerical simulations.\n", "  We consider a continuous-space and continuous-time diffusion process under\nresetting with memory. A particle resets to a position chosen from its\ntrajectory in the past according to a memory kernel. Depending on the form of\nthe memory kernel, we show analytically how different asymptotic behaviours of\nthe variance of the particle position emerge at long times. These range from\nstandard diffusive ($\\sigma^2 \\sim t$) all the way to anomalous ultraslow\ngrowth $\\sigma^2 \\sim \\ln \\ln t$.\n", "  The post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase is arguably one of the least\nunderstood phases of the evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. The\nrecent post-AGB evolutionary sequences computed by Miller Bertolami (2016) are\nat least three to ten times faster than those previously published by\nVassiliadis & Wood (1994) and Bloecker (1995) which have been used in a large\nnumber of studies. This is true for the whole mass and metallicity range. The\nnew models are also $\\sim$0.1-0.3 dex brighter than the previous models with\nsimilar remnant masses. In this short article we comment on the main reasons\nbehind these differences, and discuss possible implications for other studies\nof post-AGB stars or planetary nebulae.\n", "  The neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) the Rapid Burster (RB; MXB\n1730-335) uniquely shows both Type-I and Type-II X-ray bursts. The origin of\nthe latter is ill-understood but has been linked to magnetospheric gating of\nthe accretion flow. We present a spectral analysis of simultaneous Swift,\nNuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the RB during its 2015 outburst. Although\na broad Fe-K line has been observed before, the high quality of our\nobservations allows us to model this line using relativistic reflection models\nfor the first time. We find that the disk is strongly truncated at\n$41.8^{+6.7}_{-5.3}$ gravitational radii ($\\sim 87$ km), which supports\nmagnetospheric Type-II burst models and strongly disfavors models involving\ninstabilities at the innermost stable circular orbit. Assuming that the RB\nmagnetic field indeed truncates the disk, we find $B = (6.2 \\pm 1.5) \\times\n10^8$ G, larger than typically inferred for NS LMXBs. In addition, we find a\nlow inclination ($i = 29\\pm2^{\\rm o}$). Finally, we comment on the origin of\nthe Comptonized and thermal components in the RB spectrum.\n", "  Parafermionic zero modes are a novel set of excitations displaying\nnon-Abelian statistics somewhat richer than that of Majorana modes. These modes\nare predicted to occur when nearby fractional quantum Hall edge states are\ngapped by an interposed superconductor. Despite substantial experimental\nprogress, we argue that the necessary crossed Andreev reflection in this\narrangement is a challenging milestone to reach. We propose a superconducting\nquantum dot array structure on a fractional quantum Hall edge that can lead to\nparafermionic zero modes from coherent superconducting forward scattering on a\nquantum Hall edge. Such coherent forward scattering has already been\ndemonstrated in recent experiments. We show that for a spin-singlet\nsuperconductor interacting with loops of spin unpolarized $2/3$ fractional\nquantum edge, even an array size of order ten should allow one to\nsystematically tune into a parafermionic degeneracy.\n", "  We discuss collective excitations (both fundamental and solitonic\nexcitations) of quantized superfluid vortices in neutron $^3P_2$ superfluids,\nwhich likely exist in high density neutron matter such as neutron stars.\nBesides the well-known Kelvin modes (translational zero modes), we find a\ngapfull mode whose low-energy description takes the simple form of a double\nsine-Gordon model. The associated kink solution and its effects on spontaneous\nmagnetization inside the vortex core are analyzed in detail.\n", "  Measurements of flux density are described for five planets, Mars, Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune, across the six Planck High Frequency Instrument\nfrequency bands (100-857 GHz) and these are then compared with models and\nexisting data. In our analysis, we have also included estimates of the\nbrightness of Jupiter and Saturn at the three frequencies of the Planck Low\nFrequency Instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz). The results provide constraints on\nthe intrinsic brightness and the brightness time-variability of these planets.\nThe majority of the planet flux density estimates are limited by systematic\nerrors, but still yield better than 1% measurements in many cases. Applying\ndata from Planck HFI, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to a model that incorporates contributions\nfrom Saturn's rings to the planet's total flux density suggests a best fit\nvalue for the spectral index of Saturn's ring system of $\\beta _\\mathrm{ring} =\n2.30\\pm0.03$ over the 30-1000 GHz frequency range. The average ratio between\nthe Planck-HFI measurements and the adopted model predictions for all five\nplanets (excluding Jupiter observations for 353 GHz) is 0.997, 0.997, 1.018,\nand 1.032 for 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. Model predictions for\nplanet thermodynamic temperatures are therefore consistent with the absolute\ncalibration of Planck-HFI detectors at about the three-percent-level. We\ncompare our measurements with published results from recent cosmic microwave\nbackground experiments. In particular, we observe that the flux densities\nmeasured by Planck HFI and WMAP agree to within 2%. These results allow\nexperiments operating in the mm-wavelength range to cross-calibrate against\nPlanck and improve models of radiative transport used in planetary science.\n", "  Recently Pikovski et al. have proposed in [ Pikovski I et al. 2015 Nature\nPhys. 11, 668] an intriguing universal decoherence mechanism, suggesting that\ngravitation may play a conceptually important role in the quantum-to-classical\ntransition, albeit vanishingly small in everyday situations. Here we analyze\ninformation transfer induced by this mechanism. We show that generically on\nshort time-scales, gravitational decoherence leads to a redundant information\nencoding, which results in a form of objectivization of the center-of-mass\nposition in the gravitational field. We derive the relevant time-scales of this\nprocess, given in terms of energy dispersion and quantum Fisher information. As\nan example we study thermal coherent states and show certain robustness of the\neffect with the temperature. Finally, we draw an analogy between our\nobjectivization mechanism and the fundamental problem of point individuation in\nGeneral Relativity as emphasized by the Einstein's Hole argument.\n", "  A search for massive resonances decaying to a Z boson and a photon is\nperformed in events with a hadronically decaying Z boson candidate, separately\nin light-quark and b quark decay modes, identified using jet substructure and\nadvanced b tagging techniques. Results are based on samples of proton-proton\ncollisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at center-of-mass\nenergies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and\n2.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. The results of the search are combined\nwith those of a similar search in the leptonic decay modes of the Z boson,\nbased on the same data sets. Spin-0 resonances with various widths and with\nmasses in a range between 0.2 and 3.0 TeV are considered. No significant excess\nis observed either in the individual analyses or the combination. The results\nare presented in terms of upper limits on the production cross section of such\nresonances and constitute the most stringent limits to date for a wide range of\nmasses.\n", "  We explore empirical constraints on the statistical relationship between the\nradial size of galaxies and the radius of their host dark matter halos from\n$z\\sim 0.1$--3 using the GAMA and CANDELS surveys. We map dark matter halo mass\nto galaxy stellar mass using relationships from abundance matching, applied to\nthe Bolshoi-Planck dissipationless N-body simulation. We define SRHR$\\equiv\nr_e/R_h$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo virial radius, and SRHR$\\lambda\n\\equiv r_e/(\\lambda R_h)$ as the ratio of galaxy radius to halo spin parameter\ntimes halo radius. At $z\\sim 0.1$, we find an average value of SRHR $\\simeq\n0.018$ and SRHR$\\lambda \\simeq 0.5$ with very little dependence on stellar\nmass. SRHR and SRHR$\\lambda$ have a weak dependence on cosmic time since $z\\sim\n3$. SRHR shows a mild decrease over cosmic time for low mass galaxies, but\nincreases slightly or does not evolve for more massive galaxies. We find hints\nthat at high redshift ($z\\sim 2$--3), SRHR$\\lambda$ is lower for more massive\ngalaxies, while it shows no significant dependence on stellar mass at\n$z\\lesssim 0.5$. We find that for both the GAMA and CANDELS samples, at all\nredshifts from $z\\sim 0.1$--3, the observed conditional size distribution in\nstellar mass bins is remarkably similar to the conditional distribution of\n$\\lambda R_h$. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of these\nresults.\n", "  Understanding ionizing fluxes of stellar populations is crucial for various\nastrophysical problems including the epoch of reionization. Massive short-lived\nWolf-Rayet stars are generally considered as the main ionizing sources. We\nexamine the role of less massive stars that lose their envelope through\ninteraction with a companion. We use the evolutionary code MESA and the\nradiative transfer code CMFGEN to investigate stripped stars as a function of\nmetallicity (Z).\n  We show that typical progenitors, initially 12$M_{\\odot}$, produce hot and\ncompact stars (~4$M_{\\odot}$, 60-80 kK, ~1$R_{\\odot}$) that copiously produce\nionizing photons, emitting 60-85% and 30-60% of their energy as HI and HeI\nionizing radiation, for Z=0.0001-0.02. This is comparable to a typical massive\nWolf-Rayet star, when accounting for their longer lifetimes and the favoring\ninitial mass function. Stripped stars further emit their ionizing photons with\na delay (~20Myrs after star formation for this progenitor), allowing time for\nstellar feedback to disperse the birth clouds. This increases the fraction that\ncan escape and contribute to ionization of the intergalactic medium.\n  We further find that Roche stripping fails to fully remove the H-rich\nenvelope at low Z. This questions the common treatment of stripped stars in\nrapid population synthesis simulations as pure helium stars. We expect\nimplications for the rate of type Ib/c supernova at low Z and for the advanced\nevolutionary channels for type Ia supernova and gravitational wave sources. We\ndiscuss how the characteristic spectral features of stripped stars can be used\nto increase the observed sample, which is urgently needed to test the models.\n", "  A wide variety of outstanding problems in astrophysics involve the motion of\na large number of particles ($N\\gtrsim 10^{6}$) under the force of gravity.\nThese include the global evolution of globular clusters, tidal disruptions of\nstars by a massive black hole, the formation of protoplanets and the detection\nof sources of gravitational radiation. The direct-summation of $N$\ngravitational forces is a complex problem with no analytical solution and can\nonly be tackled with approximations and numerical methods. To this end, the\nHermite scheme is a widely used integration method. With different numerical\ntechniques and special-purpose hardware, it can be used to speed up the\ncalculations. But these methods tend to be computationally slow and cumbersome\nto work with. Here we present a new GPU, direct-summation $N-$body integrator\nwritten from scratch and based on this scheme. This code has high modularity,\nallowing users to readily introduce new physics, it exploits available\nhigh-performance computing resources and will be maintained by public, regular\nupdates. The code can be used in parallel on multiple CPUs and GPUs, with a\nconsiderable speed-up benefit. The single GPU version runs about 200 times\nfaster compared to the single CPU version. A test run using 4 GPUs in parallel\nshows a speed up factor of about 3 as compared to the single GPU version. The\nconception and design of this first release is aimed at users with access to\ntraditional parallel CPU clusters or computational nodes with one or a few GPU\ncards.\n", "  According to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, the rotational energy of a\nrapidly spinning neutron star is carried away by a relativistic wind and\ndeposited at a large distance, in the nebula, downstream of the wind\ntermination shock. The energy transport in the outflow is mediated by Poynting\nflux, but it is not clear how the energy stored in the fields is transferred\ninto the energized population of emitting particles. The most plausible\ndissipation mechanisms are thought to be related to the \"striped\" structure of\nthe wind, in particular, to the existence of a current sheet, prone to\nreconnection events. In this model the current sheet is a natural place for\ninternal dissipation and acceleration of particles responsible for pulsed,\nhigh-energy emission. Moreover, reconnection is a promising scenario for\nexplaining annihilation of fields at the shock and conversion of their energy\ninto the kinetic energy of particles. The shock structure, however, is likely\nto differ in the low-density plasmas, in which non-MHD effects intervene. In\nthis regime, the striped wind can dissipate its energy via an electromagnetic\nprecursor of the shock.\n", "  Surface observations indicate that the speed of the solar meridional\ncirculation in the photosphere varies in anti-phase with the solar cycle. The\ncurrent explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into\nactive regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.\nWhen these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they\ncontribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.\nThe behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains\nlargely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to\ncapture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of\nintegration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection\nzone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this\nwork we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a\n3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and\nquantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection\nzone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable\nstrength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and\namplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of\nmagnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature\ninduced by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow\nat mid latitudes in the lower convection zone that occurs near the equatorward\nedge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during cycle maximum. Globally, the\ndynamo-generated large-scale magnetic field drives variations in the meridional\nflow, in stark contrast to the conventional kinematic flux transport view of\nthe magnetic field being advected passively by the flow.\n", "  We investigate the consequences of the hybrid quantization approach for\nprimordial perturbations in loop quantum cosmology, obtaining predictions for\nthe cosmic microwave background and comparing them with data collected by the\nPlanck mission. In this work, we complete previous studies about the scalar\nperturbations and incorporate tensor modes. We compute their power spectrum for\na variety of vacuum states. We then analyze the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the\nconsistency relation between this quantity and the spectral index of the tensor\npower spectrum. We also compute the temperature-temperature, electric-electric,\ntemperature-electric, and magnetic-magnetic correlation functions. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effects of the quantum geometry in these correlation functions and\nconfront them with observations.\n", "  Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge waves in a\nvariety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices.\nWaves observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which\nsuggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two celebrated\nequatorially trapped waves known as Kelvin and Yanai modes, due to the Earth's\nrotation that breaks time-reversal symmetry. The non-trivial structure of the\nbulk Poincar\\'e wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value $2$\nguarantees existence for these waves. This invariant demonstrates that ocean\nand atmospheric waves share fundamental properties with topological insulators,\nand that topology plays an unexpected role in the Earth climate system.\n", "  We formulate a general criterion for the exact preservation of the \"lake at\nrest\" solution in general mesh-based and meshless numerical schemes for the\nstrong form of the shallow-water equations with bottom topography. The main\nidea is a careful mimetic design for the spatial derivative operators in the\nmomentum flux equation that is paired with a compatible averaging rule for the\nwater column height arising in the bottom topography source term. We prove\nconsistency of the mimetic difference operators analytically and demonstrate\nthe well-balanced property numerically using finite difference and RBF-FD\nschemes in the one- and two-dimensional cases.\n", "  We study the breaking of the discrete time-translation symmetry in small\nperiodically driven quantum systems. Such systems are intermediate between\nlarge closed systems and small dissipative systems, which both display the\nsymmetry breaking, but have qualitatively different dynamics. As a nontrivial\nexample we consider period tripling in a quantum nonlinear oscillator. We show\nthat, for moderately strong driving, the period tripling is robust on an\nexponentially long time scale, which is further extended by an even weak\ndecoherence.\n", "  We introduce and study quantized versions of Cop and Robber game. We achieve\nthis by using graph-preserving quantum operations, which are the quantum\nanalogues of stochastic operations preserving the graph. We provide the tight\nbound for the number of operations required to reach the given state. By\nextending them to the controlled operations, we define a quantum-controlled Cop\nand Robber game, which expands the classical Cop and Robber game, as well as\nthe classically controlled quantum Cop and Robber game. In contrast to the\ntypical scheme for introducing quantum games, we assume that both parties can\nutilise full information about the opponent's strategy. We show that the\nutilisation of the full knowledge about the opponent's state does not provide\nthe advantage. Moreover, the chances of catching the Robber decrease for\nclassical cop-win graphs. This result does not depend on the chosen model of\nevolution. On the other hand, the possibility to execute controlled quantum\noperations allows catching the Robber on almost all classical cop-win graphs.\nBy this, we demonstrate that it is necessary to enrich the structure of\ncorrelations between the players' systems to provide a non-trivial quantized\nCop and Robber game. Thus the quantum controlled operations offer a significant\nadvantage over the classically controlled quantum operations.\n", "  An approach for analytical description of thermal processes in harmonic\nlattices is presented. We cover longitudinal and transverse vibrations of\nchains and out-of-plane vibrations of two-dimensional lattices with\ninteractions of an arbitrary number of neighbors. Motion of each particle is\ngoverned by a single scalar equation and therefore the notion \"scalar lattice\"\nis used. Evolution of initial temperature field in an infinite lattice is\ninvestigated. An exact equation describing the evolution is derived.\nContinualization of this equation with respect to spatial coordinates is\ncarried out. The resulting continuum equation is solved analytically. The\nsolution shows that the kinetic temperature is represented as the sum of two\nterms, one describing short time behavior, the other large time behavior. At\nshort times, the temperature performs high-frequency oscillations caused by\nredistribution of energy among kinetic and potential forms (fast process).\nCharacteristic time of this process is of order of ten periods of atomic\nvibrations. At large times, changes of the temperature are caused by ballistic\nheat transfer (slow process). The temperature field is represented as a\nsuperposition of waves having the shape of initial temperature distribution and\npropagating with group velocities dependent on the wave vector. Expressions\ndescribing fast and slow processes are invariant with respect to substitution\n$t$ by $-t$. However examples considered in the paper demonstrate that these\nprocesses are irreversible. Numerical simulations show that presented theory\ndescribes the evolution of temperature field at short and large time scales\nwith high accuracy.\n", "  We derive the nonlinear fractional surface wave equation that governs\ncompression waves at an interface that is coupled to a viscous bulk medium. The\nfractional character of the differential equation comes from the fact that the\neffective thickness of the bulk layer that is coupled to the interface is\nfrequency dependent. The nonlinearity arises from the nonlinear dependence of\nthe interface compressibility on the local compression, which is obtained from\nexperimental measurements and reflects a phase transition at the interface.\nNumerical solutions of our nonlinear fractional theory reproduce several\nexperimental key features of surface waves in phospholipid monolayers at the\nair-water interface without freely adjustable fitting parameters. In\nparticular, the propagation length of the surface wave abruptly increases at a\nthreshold excitation amplitude. The wave velocity is found to be of the order\nof 40 cm/s both in experiments and theory and slightly increases as a function\nof the excitation amplitude. Nonlinear acoustic switching effects in membranes\nare thus shown to arise purely based on intrinsic membrane properties, namely\nthe presence of compressibility nonlinearities that accompany phase transitions\nat the interface.\n", "  A trigonal phase existing only as small patches on chemically exfoliated few\nlayer, thermodynamically stable 1H phase of MoS2 is believed to influence\ncritically properties of MoS2 based devices. This phase has been most often\nattributed to the metallic 1T phase. We investigate the electronic structure of\nchemically exfoliated MoS2 few layered systems using spatially resolved (lesser\nthan 120 nm resolution) photoemission spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy in\nconjunction with state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations. On the\nbasis of these results, we establish that the ground state of this phase is a\nsmall gap (~90 meV) semiconductor in contrast to most claims in the literature;\nwe also identify the specific trigonal (1T') structure it has among many\nsuggested ones.\n", "  We construct a low energy effective theory of anisotropic fractional quantum\nHall (FQH) states. We develop a formalism similar to that used in the bi-metric\napproach to massive gravity, and apply it to describe abelian anisotropic FQH\nstates in the presence of external electromagnetic and geometric backgrounds.\nWe derive a relationship between the shift, the Hall viscosity, and a new\nquantized coupling to anisotropy, which we term \"anisospin\". We verify this\nrelationship by numerically computing the Hall viscosity for a variety of\nanisotropic quantum Hall states using the density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG). Finally, we apply these techniques to the problem of nematic order and\nclarify certain disagreements that exist in the literature about the meaning of\nthe coefficient of the Berry phase term in the nematic effective action.\n", "  We conduct a systematic study of galactic outflows in star-forming galaxies\nat $z\\sim0$-$2$ based on the absorption lines of optical spectra taken from\nSDSS DR7, DEEP2 DR4, and Keck Erb et al. We carefully make stacked spectra of\nhomogeneous galaxy samples with similar stellar mass distributions at\n$z\\sim0$-$2$, and perform the multi-component fitting of model absorption lines\nand stellar continua to the stacked spectra. We obtain the maximum\n($v_\\rm{max}$) and central ($v_\\rm{out}$) outflow velocities, and estimate the\nmass loading factors ($\\eta$), a ratio of the mass outflow rate to the star\nformation rate (SFR). Investigating the redshift evolution of the outflow\nvelocities measured with the absorption lines whose depths and ionization\nenergies are similar (Na I D and Mg I at $z\\sim0$-$1$; Mg II and C II at\n$z\\sim1$-$2$), we identify, for the first time, that the average value of\n$v_\\rm{max}$ ($v_\\rm{out}$) significantly increases by 0.05-0.3 dex from\n$z\\sim0$ to $2$ at a given SFR. Moreover, we find that the value of $\\eta$\nincreases from $z\\sim0$ to $2$ by $\\eta \\propto (1 + z)^{1.2\\pm0.3}$ at a given\nhalo circular velocity $v_\\rm{cir}$ , albeit with a potential systematics\ncaused by model parameter choices. The redshift evolution of $v_\\rm{max}$\n($v_\\rm{out}$) and $\\eta$ is consistent with the galaxy-size evolution and the\nlocal velocity-SFR surface density relation, and explained by high-gas\nfractions in high-redshift massive galaxies, which is supported by recent radio\nobservations. We obtain a scaling relation of $\\eta \\propto v_\\rm{cir}^a$ for\n$a = -0.2 \\pm 1.1$ in our $z\\sim0$ galaxies that agrees with the\nmomentum-driven outflow model ($a = -1$) within the uncertainty.\n", "  Several coronagraph designs have been proposed over the last two decades to\ndirectly image exoplanets. Among these designs, the vector vortex coronagraphs\nprovide theoretically perfect starlight cancellation along with small inner\nworking angles when deployed on telescopes with unobstructed pupils. However,\ncurrent and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes\npresent complex pupil geometries, including secondary mirror central\nobscurations, that prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources\nentirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized\npupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited\nthroughput for vortex charges $>2$. We present a family of pupil plane\napodizations that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric\ncentral obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors for charge 2, 4, and 6\nvector vortex coronagraphs. These apodizations are derived analytically and\nallow the vortex coronagraph to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the\npresence of central obscurations. For a charge 4 vortex, we design polynomial\napodization functions assuming a greyscale apodizing filter that represent a\nsubstantial gain in throughput over the ring-apodized vortex coronagraph\ndesign, while for a charge 6 vortex, we design polynomial apodized vortex\ncoronagraphs that have $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ total energy throughput for the entire\nrange of central obscuration sizes studied. We propose methods for optimizing\napodizations produced with either greyscale apodizing filters or shaped\nmirrors. We conclude by demonstrating how this design may be combined with\napodizations numerically optimized for struts and segment gaps in telescope\npupils to design terrestrial exoplanet imagers for complex pupils.\n", "  Several superconducting circuit configurations are examined on the existence\nof super-radiant phase transitions (SRPTs) in thermal equilibrium. For some\nconfigurations consisting of artificial atoms, whose circuit diagrams are\nhowever not specified, and an LC resonator or a transmission line, we confirm\nthe absence of SRPTs in the thermal equilibrium following the similar analysis\nas the no-go theorem for atomic systems. We also show some other configurations\nwhere the absence of SRPTs cannot be confirmed.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to investigate the transition of a strongly\nmagnetized neutron star into the accretion regime with very low accretion rate.\nFor this purpose we monitored the Be-transient X-ray pulsar GRO J1008-57\nthroughout a full orbital cycle. The current observational campaign was\nperformed with the Swift/XRT telescope in the soft X-ray band (0.5-10 keV)\nbetween two subsequent Type I outbursts in January and September 2016. The\nexpected transition to the propeller regime was not observed. However, the\ntransitions between different regimes of accretion were detected. In\nparticular, after an outburst the source entered a stable accretion state\ncharacterised by the accretion rate of ~10^14-10^15 g/s. We associate this\nstate with accretion from a cold (low-ionised) disc of temperature below ~6500\nK. We argue that a transition to such accretion regime should be observed in\nall X-ray pulsars with certain combination of the rotation frequency and\nmagnetic field strength. The proposed model of accretion from a cold disc is\nable to explain several puzzling observational properties of X-ray pulsars.\n", "  We apply correlation analysis to random fields in numerical simulations of\nthe supernova-driven interstellar medium (ISM) with the magnetic field produced\nby dynamo action. We solve the thermo-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in a\nshearing, Cartesian box representing a local region of the ISM, subject to\nthermal and kinetic energy injection by supernova explosions, and parameterized\noptically-thin radiative cooling. We consider the cold, warm\\, and hot phases\nof the ISM separately; the analysis mostly considers the warm gas, which\noccupies the bulk of the domain. Various physical variables have different\ncorrelation lengths in the warm phase: $40 pc$, $50 pc$, and $60 pc$ for random\nmagnetic field, density, and velocity, respectively, in the midplane. The\ncorrelation time of the random velocity is comparable to the eddy turnover\ntime, about $10^7 yr$, although it may be shorter in regions with higher star\nformation rate. The random magnetic field is anisotropic, with the standard\ndeviations of its components $b_x/b_y/b_z$ having approximate ratios\n$0.5/0.6/0.6$ in the midplane. The anisotropy is attributed to the global\nvelocity shear from galactic differential rotation, and locally inhomogeneous\noutflow to the galactic halo. The correlation length of Faraday depth along the\n$z$-axis, $120 pc$, is greater than for electron density, $60 - 90 pc$, and\nvertical magnetic field, $60 pc$. Such comparisons may be sensitive to the\norientation of the line of sight. Uncertainties of the structure functions of\nsynchrotron intensity rapidly increase with the scale. This feature is hidden\nin power spectrum analysis, which can undermine the usefulness of power spectra\nfor detailed studies of interstellar turbulence.\n", "  In digital circuits, a Flip-Flop (FF) is a circuit element that has two\nstable states which can be used to store and remember state information. The\nstate of the circuit can be changed by applying signals to the control input.\nFFs are the basic building blocks of sequential logic circuits, as logic gates\nAND,OR, NOT are the basic building block for combinational logic circuits, and\nare therefore necessary for any computations involving memory. Consequently,\nthe design and implementation of FFs can be considered as a pre-requisite for\nmemory machine design. Here we present the design of an optical FFs in an\natomic multi-level system, based on the optical manipulation of populations and\ncoherences using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. We first demonstrate that\nboth populations and coherences can be transferred over multistate systems. We\nthen propose the design of toggle-FFs, Delay-FFs, and Serial-in Serial-Out\n(SISO) shift registers using such systems. For the design of the filp-flops we\nuse a three level $\\Lambda$-type system. In order to design SISO shift\nregisters we concatenate two $\\Lambda$-type systems and construct an \"M\"-type\nscheme, and similarly concatenating three $\\Lambda$-type system we are able to\nobtain a seven level system. By concatenating we are able to use output of one\nthree level $\\Lambda$-type system serve as input of another three level\n$\\Lambda$-type system. On top of using populations for design of logic gates,\nwe uniquely exploit the coherences for logic machine, which provides an\nadditional degree of freedom which can be used for the design of computing\nelements.\n", "  Recent studies of the stellar population in the solar neighborhood (<20 pc)\nsuggest that there are undetected white dwarfs (WDs) in multiple systems with\nmain sequence companions. Detecting these hidden stars and obtaining a more\ncomplete census of nearby WDs is important for our understanding of binary and\ngalactic evolution, as well as the study of explosive phenomena. In an attempt\nto uncover these hidden WDs, we present intermediate resolution spectroscopy\nover the wavelength range 3000-25000 \\AA\\ of 101 nearby M dwarfs (dMs),\nobserved with the Very Large Telescope X-Shooter spectrograph. For each star we\nsearch for a hot component superimposed on the dM spectrum. X-Shooter has\nexcellent blue sensitivity and thus can reveal a faint hot WD despite the\nbrightness of its red companion. Visual examination shows no clear evidence of\na WD in any of the spectra. We place upper limits on the effective temperatures\nof WDs that may still be hiding by fitting dM templates to the spectra, and\nmodeling WD spectra. On average our survey is sensitive to WDs hotter than\nabout 5300 K. This suggests that the frequency of WD companions of T<5300 K\nwith separation of order <50 AU among the local dM population is <3% at the 95%\nconfidence level. The reduced spectra are made available on via WISeREP\nrepository.\n", "  We present a hierarchical probabilistic model for improving geometric stellar\ndistance estimates using color--magnitude information. This is achieved with a\ndata driven model of the color--magnitude diagram, not relying on stellar\nmodels but instead on the relative abundances of stars in color--magnitude\ncells, which are inferred from very noisy magnitudes and parallaxes. While the\nresulting noise-deconvolved color--magnitude diagram can be useful for a range\nof applications, we focus on deriving improved stellar distance estimates\nrelying on both parallax and photometric information. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample\nthat also have APASS magnitudes. Our hierarchical model has 4~million\nparameters in total, most of which are marginalized out numerically or\nanalytically. We find that distance estimates are significantly improved for\nthe noisiest parallaxes and densest regions of the color--magnitude diagram. In\nparticular, the average distance signal-to-noise ratio and uncertainty improve\nby 19~percent and 36~percent, respectively, with 8~percent of the objects\nimproving in SNR by a factor greater than 2. This computationally efficient\napproach fully accounts for both parallax and photometric noise, and is a first\nstep towards a full hierarchical probabilistic model of the Gaia data.\n", "  Observations by HAWC and Milagro have detected bright and spatially extended\nTeV gamma-ray sources surrounding the Geminga and Monogem pulsars. We argue\nthat these observations, along with a substantial population of other extended\nTeV sources coincident with pulsar wind nebulae, constitute a new morphological\nclass of spatially extended TeV halos. We show that HAWCs wide field-of-view\nunlocks an expansive parameter space of TeV halos not observable by atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes. Under the assumption that Geminga and Monogem are typical\nmiddle-aged pulsars, we show that ten-year HAWC observations should eventually\nobserve 37$^{+17}_{-13}$ middle-aged TeV halos that correspond to pulsars whose\nradio emission is not beamed towards Earth. Depending on the extrapolation of\nthe TeV halo efficiency to young pulsars, HAWC could detect more than 100 TeV\nhalos from mis-aligned pulsars. These pulsars have historically been difficult\nto detect with existing multiwavelength observations. TeV halos will constitute\na significant fraction of all HAWC sources, allowing follow-up observations to\nefficiently find pulsar wind nebulae and thermal pulsar emission. The\nobservation and subsequent multi-wavelength follow-up of TeV halos will have\nsignificant implications for our understanding of pulsar beam geometries, the\nevolution of PWN, the diffusion of cosmic-rays near energetic pulsars, and the\ncontribution of pulsars to the cosmic-ray positron excess.\n", "  Pulsar Wind Nebulae, and the Crab nebula in particular, are the best cosmic\nlaboratories to investigate the dynamics of magnetized relativistic outflows\nand particle acceleration up to PeV energies. Multidimensional MHD modeling by\nmeans of numerical simulations has been very successful at reproducing, to the\nvery finest details, the innermost structure of these synchrotron emitting\nnebulae, as observed in the X-rays. Therefore, the comparison between the\nsimulated source and observations can be used as a powerful diagnostic tool to\nprobe the physical conditions in pulsar winds, like their composition,\nmagnetization, and degree of anisotropy. However, in spite of the wealth of\nobservations and of the accuracy of current MHD models, the precise mechanisms\nfor magnetic field dissipation and for the acceleration of the non-thermal\nemitting particles are mysteries still puzzling theorists to date. Here we\nreview the methodologies of the computational approach to the modeling of\nPulsar Wind Nebulae, discussing the most relevant results and the recent\nprogresses achieved in this fascinating field of high-energy astrophysics.\n", "  We present homogeneous, sub-horizontal branch photometry of twenty dwarf\nspheroidal satellite galaxies of M31 observed with the Hubble Space Telescope.\nCombining our new data for sixteen systems with archival data in the same\nfilters for another four, we show that Andromeda dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nfavor strikingly red horizontal branches or red clumps down to ~10^{4.2} Lsun\n(M_V ~ -5.8). The age-sensitivity of horizontal branch stars implies that a\nlarge fraction of the M31 dwarf galaxies have extended star formation histories\n(SFHs), and appear inconsistent with early star formation episodes that were\nrapidly shutdown. Systems fainter than ~10^{5.5} Lsun show the widest range in\nthe ratios and morphologies of red and blue horizontal branches, indicative of\nboth complex SFHs and a diversity in quenching timescales and/or mechanisms,\nwhich is qualitatively different from what is currently known for faint Milky\nWay (MW) satellites of comparable luminosities. Our findings bolster similar\nconclusions from recent deeper data for a handful of M31 dwarf galaxies. We\ndiscuss several sources for diversity of our data such as varying halo masses,\npatchy reionization, mergers/accretion, and the environmental influence of M31\nand the Milky Way on the early evolution of their satellite populations. A\ndetailed comparison between the histories of M31 and MW satellites would shed\nsignifiant insight into the processes that drive the evolution of low-mass\ngalaxies. Such a study will require imaging that reaches the oldest main\nsequence turnoffs for a significant number of M31 companions.\n", "  The authors of ref. Phys.Rev. D94 (2016) no.1, 014502 reported about a\ncareful analysis of the impact of lattice artifacts on the $SU(3)$ gauge-field\npropagators. In particular, they found that the low-momentum behavior of the\nrenormalized propagators depends on the lattice bare coupling and interpreted\nthis fact as the result of it being affected by finite lattice spacing\nartifacts. We do not share this interpretation and present here a different and\nmore suitable explanation for these results.\n", "  We investigate the compatibility of the Symmetron with dark energy by\nintroducing a non-minimal kinetic term associated with the Symmetron. In this\nnew model, the effect of the friction term appearing in the equation of motion\nof the Symmetron field becomes more pronounced due to the non-minimal kinetic\nterm appearing in the action and, under specific conditions after symmetry\nbreaking, the universe experiences an accelerating phase which, in spite of the\nlarge effective mass of the scalar field, lasts as long as the Hubble time\n$H_{0}$.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the effect of dynamical three-dimensional MHD\nturbulence on test particle acceleration, and compare how this evolving system\naffects particle energization by current sheets interaction, against\nfrozen-in-time fields. To do this we analize the ensamble particle acceleration\nfor static electromagnetic fields extracted from direct numerical simulations\nof the MHD equations, and compare with the dynamical fields. We show that a\nreduction in particle acceleration in the dynamical model results from the\nparticle trapping in the field lines, which forces the particles to remain in a\nmoving current sheet that suppress the longer exposure at the strong electric\nfield gradients located between structures, which is an efficient particle\nacceleration mechanism. In addition, we analize the effect of anisotropy caused\nby the mean magnetic field. It is well known that for sufficiently strong\nexternal fields, the system suffers a transition towards a two-dimensional\nflow. This causes an increment in the size of the coherent structures,\nresulting in a magnetized state of the particles and the reduction of the\nparticle energization.\n", "  The quenched gluon and ghost propagator data published in [1] is reanalysed\nfollowing the suggestion of [2] to resolve the differences between the infrared\ndata of the simulations. Our results confirms that the procedure works well\neither for the gluon or for the ghost propagator but not for both propagators\nsimultaneously as the observed deviations in the data follow opposite patterns.\nDefinitive conclusions require improving the determination of the (ratios) of\nlattice spacings. A simple procedure for the relative calibration of the\nlattice spacing in lattice simulations is suggested.\n", "  The generation of photons in a microcavity coupled to a laser-driven quantum\ndot interacting with longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons is studied in the\nregime of simultaneously strong driving and strong dot-cavity coupling. The\nstationary cavity photon number is found to depend in a non-trivial way on the\ndetuning between the laser and the exciton transition in the dot. In\nparticular, the maximal efficiency of the cavity feeding is obtained for\ndetunings corresponding to transition energies between cavity-dressed states\nwith excitation numbers larger than one. Phonons significantly enhance the\ncavity feeding at large detunings. In the strong-driving, strong-coupling\nlimit, the photon statistics is highly non-Poissonian. While without phonons a\ndouble-peaked structure in the photon distribution is predicted, phonons make\nthe photon statistics thermal-like with very high effective temperatures $\\sim\n10^5$ K, even for low phonon temperatures $\\sim 4$ K. These results were\nobtained by numerical calculations where the driving, the dot-cavity coupling\nand the dot-phonon interactions are taken into account without approximations.\nThis is achieved by a reformulation of an exact iterative path-integral scheme\nwhich is applicable for a large class of quantum-dissipative systems and which\nin our case reduces the numerical demands by 15 orders of magnitude.\n", "  Strong coupling between a system and its environment leads to the emergence\nof non-Markovian dynamics, which cannot be described by a time-local master\nequation. One way to capture such dynamics is to use numerical real-time path\nintegrals, where assuming a finite bath memory time enables manageable\nsimulation scaling. However, by comparing to the exactly soluble independent\nboson model, we show that the presence of transient negative decay rates in the\nexact dynamics can result in simulations with unphysical exponential growth of\ndensity matrix elements when the finite memory approximation is used. We\ntherefore reformulate this approximation in such a way that the exact dynamics\nare reproduced identically and then apply our new method to the spin-boson\nmodel with superohmic environmental coupling, commonly used to model phonon\nenvironments, but which cannot be solved exactly. Our new method allows us to\neasily access parameter regimes where we find revivals in population dynamics\nwhich are due to non-Markovian backflow of information from the bath to the\nsystem.\n", "  $L_\\mu -L_\\tau$ gauge boson ($Z'$) with a mass in the MeV to GeV region can\nresolve not only the muon $g-2$ excess, but also the gap in the high-energy\ncosmic neutrino spectrum at IceCube. It was recently proposed that such a light\ngauge boson can be detected during the Belle II experiment with a luminosity of\n50 ab$^{-1}$ by the $e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma +\\slashed{E}$ process through the\nkinetic mixing with the photon, where the missing energy $\\slashed{E}$ is from\nthe $Z' \\to \\bar\\nu \\nu$ decays. We study the phenomenological implications\nwhen a pair of singlet vector-like leptons carrying different $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$\ncharges are included, and a complex singlet scalar ($\\phi_S$) is introduced to\naccomplish the spontaneous $U(1)_{L_\\mu -L_\\tau}$ symmetry breaking. It is\nfound that the extension leads to several phenomena of interest, including (i)\nbranching ratio (BR) for $h\\to \\mu \\tau$ can be of the order of $10^{-3}$; (ii)\n$\\phi_S$-mediated muon $g-2$ can be of the order of $10\\times 10^{-10}$; (iii)\nBR for $\\tau \\to \\mu \\phi^*_S\\to \\mu Z'Z'$ can be $10^{-8}$, and (iv) kinetic\nmixing between the $Z'$ boson and photon is sensitive to the relative heavy\nlepton masses. The predicted BRs for $\\tau\\to (3\\mu+\\slashed{E}, 5\\mu$) through\nthe leptonic $Z'$ decays can reach a level of $10^{-9}$, in which the results\nfall within the sensitivity of the Belle II in the search for the rare tau\ndecays.\n", "  We study the magnetic properties of quark matter in the NJL model with the\ntensor interaction. The spin-polarized phase given by the tensor interaction\nremains even when the quark mass is zero, while the phase given by the axial\nvector interaction disappears. There are two kinds of spin-polarized phases:\none appears in the chiral-broken phase, and the other appears in the\nchiral-restored phase where the quark mass is zero. The latter phase can appear\nindependently of the strength of the tensor interaction.\n", "  We study analytically and numerically the condensation of a\ndriven-dissipative exciton-polariton system using symmetric nonresonant pumping\ngeometries. We show that the lowest condensation threshold solution carries a\ndefinite parity as a consequence of the symmetric excitation profile. At higher\npump intensities competition between the two parities can result in critical\nquenching of one and saturation of the other. Using long pump channels, we show\nthat the competition of the condensate parities gives rise to a different type\nof topologically stable defect propagating indefinitely along the condensate.\nThe defects display repulsive interactions and are characterized by a sustained\nwavepacket carrying a pair of opposite parity domain walls in the condensate\nchannel.\n", "  By using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the bending angle of light in a static,\nspherically symmetric and asymptotically flat spacetime has been recently\ndiscussed, especially by taking account of the finite distance from a lens\nobject to a light source and a receiver [Ishihara, Suzuki, Ono, Asada, Phys.\nRev. D 95, 044017 (2017)]. We discuss a possible extension of the method of\ncalculating the bending angle of light to stationary, axisymmetric and\nasymptotically flat spacetimes. For this purpose, we consider the light rays on\nthe equatorial plane in the axisymmetric spacetime. We introduce a spatial\nmetric to define the bending angle of light in the finite-distance situation.\nWe show that the proposed bending angle of light is coordinate-invariant by\nusing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The non-vanishing geodesic curvature of the\nphoton orbit with the spatial metric is caused in gravitomagnetism, even though\nthe light ray in the four-dimensional spacetime follows the null geodesic.\nFinally, we consider Kerr spacetime as an example in order to examine how the\nbending angle of light is computed by the present method. The finite-distance\ncorrection to the gravitomagnetic deflection angle due to the Sun's spin is\naround a pico-arcsecond level. The finite-distance corrections for Sgr\nA$^{\\ast}$ also are estimated to be very small. Therefore, the gravitomagnetic\nfinite-distance corrections for these objects are unlikely to be observed with\npresent technology.\n", "  The first results of radiative transfer calculations on decretion discs of\nbinary Be stars are presented. A smoothed particle hydrodynamics code computes\nthe structure of Be discs in coplanar circular binary systems for a range of\norbital and disc parameters. The resulting disc configuration consists of two\nspiral arms, and can be given as input into a Monte Carlo code, which\ncalculates the radiative transfer along the line of sight for various\nobservational coordinates. Making use of the property of steady disc structure\nin coplanar circular binaries, observables are computed as functions of the\norbital phase. Orbital-phase series of line profiles are given for selected\nparameter sets under various viewing angles, to allow comparison with\nobservations. Flat-topped profiles with and without superimposed multiple\nstructures are reproduced, showing, for example, that triple-peaked profiles do\nnot have to be necessarily associated with warped discs and misaligned\nbinaries. It is demonstrated that binary tidal effects give rise to\nphase-locked variability of the violet-to-red (V/R) ratio of hydrogen emission\nlines. The V/R ratio exhibits two maxima per cycle; in certain cases those\nmaxima are equal, leading to a clear new V/R cycle every half orbital period.\nThis study opens a way in identifying binaries and in constraining the\nparameters of binary systems that exhibit phase-locked variations induced by\ntidal interaction with a companion star.\n", "  This paper considers a broadly biologically relevant question of a chain\n(such as a protein) binding to a sequence of receptors with matching multiple\nligands distributed along the chain. This binding is critical in cell adhesion\nevents, and in protein self-assembly. Using a mean field approximation of\npolymer dynamics, we first calculate the characteristic binding time for a\ntethered ligand reaching for a specific binding site on the surface. This time\nis determined by two separate entropic effects: an entropic barrier for the\nchain to be stretched sufficiently to reach the distant target, and a\nrestriction on chain conformations near the surface. We then derive the\ncharacteristic time for a sequence of single binding events, and find that it\nis determined by the `zipper effect', optimizing the sequence of single and\nmultiple binding steps.\n", "  Hamiltonian systems such as the gravitational N-body problem have\ntime-reversal symmetry. However, all numerical N-body integration schemes,\nincluding symplectic ones, respect this property only approximately. In this\npaper, we present the new N-body integrator JANUS, for which we achieve exact\ntime-reversal symmetry by combining integer and floating point arithmetic.\nJANUS is explicit, formally symplectic and satisfies Liouville's theorem\nexactly. Its order is even and can be adjusted between two and ten. We discuss\nthe implementation ofJANUS and present tests of its accuracy and speed by\nperforming and analyzing long-term integrations of the Solar System. We show\nthat JANUS is fast and accurate enough to tackle a broad class of dynamical\nproblems. We also discuss the practical and philosophical implications of\nrunning exactly time-reversible simulations.\n", "  We discuss how contemporary multiwavelength observations of young\nOB-dominated clusters address long-standing astrophysical questions: Do\nclusters form rapidly or slowly with an age spread? When do clusters expand and\ndisperse to constitute the field star population? Do rich clusters form by\namalgamation of smaller subclusters? What is the pattern and duration of\ncluster formation in massive star forming regions (MSFRs)? Past observational\ndifficulties in obtaining good stellar censuses of MSFRs have been alleviated\nin recent studies that combine X-ray and infrared surveys to obtain rich,\nthough still incomplete, censuses of young stars in MSFRs. We describe here one\nof these efforts, the MYStIX project, that produced a catalog of 31,784\nprobable members of 20 MSFRs. We find that age spread within clusters are real\nin the sense that the stars in the core formed after the cluster halo. Cluster\nexpansion is seen in the ensemble of (sub)clusters, and older dispersing\npopulations are found across MSFRs. Direct evidence for subcluster merging is\nstill unconvincing. Long-lived, asynchronous star formation is pervasive across\nMSFRs.\n", "  Recently, large gauge transformation (LGT), the residual gauge symmetry after\ngauge fixing that survives at null infinity, has drawn much attention\nconcerning soft theorems and the memory effect. We point out that LGT charges\nin quantum electrodynamics are in fact one of non-compact generators of the two\ndimensional Euclidean group. Moreover, by comparing two equivalent descriptions\nof gauge transformation, we suggest that LGT is simply another way of\ndescribing the gauged little group for massless soft photons.\n", "  Strongly correlated metals comprise an enduring puzzle at the heart of\ncondensed matter physics. Commonly a highly renormalized heavy Fermi liquid\noccurs below a small coherence scale, while at higher temperatures a broad\nincoherent regime pertains in which quasi-particle description fails. Despite\nthe ubiquity of this phenomenology, strong correlations and quantum\nfluctuations make it challenging to study. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev(SYK) model\ndescribes a $0+1$D quantum cluster with random all-to-all \\emph{four}-fermion\ninteractions among $N$ Fermion modes which becomes exactly solvable as\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$, exhibiting a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid with\nemergent conformal symmetry and complete absence of quasi-particles. Here we\nstudy a lattice of complex-fermion SYK dots with random inter-site\n\\emph{quadratic} hopping. Combining the imaginary time path integral with\n\\emph{real} time path integral formulation, we obtain a heavy Fermi liquid to\nincoherent metal crossover in full detail, including thermodynamics, low\ntemperature Landau quasiparticle interactions, and both electrical and thermal\nconductivity at all scales. We find linear in temperature resistivity in the\nincoherent regime, and a Lorentz ratio $L\\equiv \\frac{\\kappa\\rho}{T}$ varies\nbetween two universal values as a function of temperature. Our work exemplifies\nan analytically controlled study of a strongly correlated metal.\n", "  Tests on $B-L$ symmetry breaking models are important probes to search for\nnew physics. One proposed model with $\\Delta(B-L)=2$ involves the oscillations\nof a neutron to an antineutron. In this paper a new limit on this process is\nderived for the data acquired from all three operational phases of the Sudbury\nNeutrino Observatory experiment. The search was concentrated in oscillations\noccurring within the deuteron, and 23 events are observed against a background\nexpectation of 30.5 events. These translate to a lower limit on the nuclear\nlifetime of $1.48\\times 10^{31}$ years at 90% confidence level (CL) when no\nrestriction is placed on the signal likelihood space (unbounded).\nAlternatively, a lower limit on the nuclear lifetime was found to be\n$1.18\\times 10^{31}$ years at 90% CL when the signal was forced into a positive\nlikelihood space (bounded). Values for the free oscillation time derived from\nvarious models are also provided in this article. This is the first search for\nneutron-antineutron oscillation with the deuteron as a target.\n", "  Geodesics are used in a wide array of applications in cosmology and\nastrophysics. However, it is not a trivial task to efficiently calculate exact\ngeodesic distances in an arbitrary spacetime. We show that in spatially flat\n(3+1)-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes, it is\npossible to integrate the second-order geodesic differential equations, and\nderive a general method for finding both timelike and spacelike distances given\ninitial-value or boundary-value constraints. In flat spacetimes with either\ndark energy or matter, whether dust, radiation, or a stiff fluid, we find an\nexact closed-form solution for geodesic distances. In spacetimes with a mixture\nof dark energy and matter, including spacetimes used to model our physical\nuniverse, there exists no closed-form solution, but we provide a fast numerical\nmethod to compute geodesics. A general method is also described for determining\nthe geodesic connectedness of an FLRW manifold, provided only its scale factor.\n", "  Given a certain amount of entanglement available as a resource, what is the\nmost efficient way to accomplish a quantum task? We address this question in\nthe relevant case of continuous variable quantum teleportation protocols\nimplemented using two-mode Gaussian states with a limited degree of\nentanglement and energy. We first characterize the class of single-mode\nphase-insensitive Gaussian channels that can be simulated via a\nBraunstein--Kimble protocol with non-unit gain and minimum shared entanglement,\nshowing that infinite energy is not necessary apart from the special cases of\nthe quantum limited attenuator and amplifier. We also find that, apart from the\nidentity, all phase-insensitive Gaussian channels can be simulated through a\ntwo-mode squeezed state with finite energy, albeit with a larger entanglement.\nWe then consider the problem of teleporting single-mode coherent states with\nGaussian-distributed displacement in phase space. Performing a geometrical\noptimization over phase-insensitive Gaussian channels, we determine the maximum\naverage teleportation fidelity achievable with any finite entanglement and for\nany realistically finite variance of the input distribution.\n", "  We study UV complete theories where the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is\nextended with a new abelian $U(1)$, and the field content is augmented by an\narbitrary number of scalar and fermion SM singlets, potentially including dark\nmatter (DM) candidates. Considerations such as classical and quantum gauge\ninvariance of the full theory and S-matrix unitarity, not applicable within a\nsimplified model approach, are shown to have significant phenomenological\nconsequences. The lack of gauge anomalies leads to compact relations among the\n$U(1)$ fermion charges, and puts a lower bound on the number of dark fermions.\nContrary to naive expectations, the DM annihilation to Zh is found to be p-wave\nsuppressed, as hinted by perturbative unitarity of S-matrix, with dramatic\nimplications for DM thermal relic density and indirect searches. Within this\nframework, the interplay between dark matter, new vector boson and Higgs\nphysics is rather natural and generic.\n", "  Context. Planet formation with pebbles has been proposed to solve a couple of\nlong-standing issues in the classical formation model. Some sophisticated\nsimulations have been done to confirm the efficiency of pebble accretion.\nHowever, there has not been any global N-body simulations that compare the\noutcomes of planet formation via pebble accretion with observed extrasolar\nplanetary systems. Aims. In this paper, we study the effects of a range of\ninitial parameters of planet formation via pebble accretion, and present the\nfirst results of our simulations. Methods. We incorporate the pebble accretion\nmodel by Ida et al. (2016) in the N-body code SyMBA (Duncan et al. 1998), along\nwith the effects of gas accretion, eccentricity and inclination damping and\nplanet migration in the disc. Results. We confirm that pebble accretion leads\nto a variety of planetary systems, but have difficulty in reproducing observed\nproperties of exoplanetary systems, such as planetary mass, semimajor axis, and\neccentricity distributions. The main reason behind this is a too-efficient type\nI migration, which sensitively depends on the disc model. However, our\nsimulations also lead to a few interesting predictions. First, we find that\nformation efficiencies of planets depend on the stellar metallicities, not only\nfor giant planets, but also for Earths (Es) and Super-Earths (SEs). The\ndependency for Es/SEs is subtle. Although higher metallicity environments lead\nto faster formation of a larger number of Es/SEs, they also tend to be lost\nlater via dynamical instability. Second, our results indicate that a wide range\nof bulk densities observed for Es and SEs is a natural consequence of dynamical\nevolution of planetary systems. Third, the ejection trend of our simulations\nsuggest that one free-floating E/SE may be expected for two smaller-mass\nplanets.\n", "  Formation of membrane necks is crucial for fission and fusion in lipid\nbilayers. In this work, we seek to answer the following fundamental question:\nwhat is the relationship between protein-induced spontaneous mean curvature and\nthe Gaussian curvature at a membrane neck? Using an augmented Helfrich model\nfor lipid bilayers to include membrane-protein interaction, we solve the shape\nequation on catenoids to find the field of spontaneous curvature that satisfies\nmechanical equilibrium of membrane necks. In this case, the shape equation\nreduces to a variable coefficient Helmholtz equation for spontaneous curvature,\nwhere the source term is proportional to the Gaussian curvature. We show how\nthis latter quantity is responsible for non-uniform distribution of spontaneous\ncurvature in minimal surfaces. We then explore the energetics of catenoids with\ndifferent spontaneous curvature boundary conditions and geometric asymmetries\nto show how heterogeneities in spontaneous curvature distribution can couple\nwith Gaussian curvature to result in membrane necks of different geometries.\n", "  The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is a future Higgs factory\nproposed by the Chinese high energy physics community. It will operate at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 240-250 GeV. The CEPC will accumulate an integrated\nluminosity of 5 ab$^{\\rm{-1}}$ in ten years' operation. With GEANT4-based full\nsimulation samples for CEPC, Higgs boson decaying into electron pair is studied\nat the CEPC. The upper limit of ${\\cal B}(H \\rightarrow e^+ e^-)$ could reach\n0.024\\% at 95\\% confidence level. The signal process is generated by MadGraph,\nwith Initial State Radiation (ISR) implemented, as a first step to adjust\nMadGraph for a electron positron Collider.\n", "  Preparing an integrable system in a mixed state described by a thermal\ndensity matrix , we subject it to a sudden quench and explore the subsequent\nunitary dynamics. Defining a version of the generalised Loschmidt overlap\namplitude (GLOA) through the purifications of the time evolved density matrix,\nwe claim that non-analyiticies in the corresponding \"dynamical free energy\ndensity\" persist and is referred to as mixed state dynamical quantum phase\ntransitions (MSDQPTs). Furthermore, these MSDQPTs are uniquely characterised by\na topological index constructed by the application of the Pancharatnam geometry\non the purifications of the thermal density matrix; the quantization of this\nindex however persists up to a critical temperature. These claims are\ncorroborated analysing the non-equilibrium dynamics of a transverse Ising chain\ninitially prepared in a thermal state and subjected to a sudden quench of the\ntransverse field.\n", "  Recently, we have reported a novel role of pairing in low-energy heavy ion\nreactions at energies above the Coulomb barrier, which may have a detectable\nimpact on reaction outcomes, such as the kinetic energy of fragments and the\nfusion cross section [arXiv:1611.10261, arXiv:1702.00069]. The phenomenon\nmimics the one studied experimentally with ultracold atomic gases, where two\nclouds of fermionic superfluids with different phases of the pairing fields are\nforced to merge, inducing various excitation modes of the pairing field.\nAlthough it originates from the phase difference of the pairing fields, the\nphysics behind it is markedly different from the so-called Josephson effect. In\nthis short contribution, we will briefly outline the results discussed in our\nrecent papers and explain relations with the field of ultracold atomic gases.\n", "  Determining the positions of halo centres in large-scale structure surveys is\ncrucial for many cosmological studies. A common assumption is that halo centres\ncorrespond to the location of their brightest member galaxies. In this paper,\nwe study the dynamics of brightest galaxies with respect to other halo members\nin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7. Specifically, we look at the line-of-sight\nvelocity and spatial offsets between brightest galaxies and their neighbours.\nWe compare those to detailed mock catalogues, constructed from high-resolution,\ndark-matter-only $N$-body simulations, in which it is assumed that satellite\ngalaxies trace dark matter subhaloes. This allows us to place constraints on\nthe fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}$ of haloes in which the brightest galaxy is not the\ncentral. Compared to previous studies we explicitly take into account the\nunrelaxed state of the host haloes, velocity offsets of halo cores and\ncorrelations between $f_{\\rm BNC}$ and the satellite occupation. We find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ strongly decreases with the luminosity of the brightest galaxy\nand increases with the mass of the host halo. Overall, in the halo mass range\n$10^{13} - 10^{14.5} h^{-1} M_\\odot$ we find $f_{\\rm BNC} \\sim 30\\%$, in good\nagreement with a previous study by Skibba et al. We discuss the implications of\nthese findings for studies inferring the galaxy--halo connection from satellite\nkinematics, models of the conditional luminosity function and galaxy formation\nin general.\n", "  These proceedings review the two DUNE prototype detectors, namely Single- and\nDual-Phase ProtoDUNEs. The detectors, both employing liquid argon Time\nProjection Chambers (LAr TPCs), are currently being built at CERN as part of\nthe ProtoDUNE experimental programme. Such R&D programme aims at validating the\nprototypes design and technology, which will eventually be applied to the DUNE\nFar Detector at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF).\n", "  This paper presents a new method of numerical computation of the QED\ncontributions to the electron anomalous magnetic moment which arises from\nFeynman graphs containing electron and photon lines and not containing electron\nloops. The method consists of two parts. The first part is the forest-like\nsubtraction formula that removes all ultraviolet and infrared divergences in\neach Feynman graph point-by-point in Feynman-parametric space. The second part\nis the importance sampling Monte-Carlo algorithm with the probability density\nfunction that is constructed for each Feynman graph individually. The method is\nfully automated at any order of the perturbation series. The results of\napplying the method to 2-loop, 3-loop, 4-loop Feynman graphs and to some\nindividual 5-loop graphs are presented.\n", "  The LHCb measurements of certain ratios of decay modes testing lepton flavour\nnon-universality might open an exciting world of new physics beyond the\nstandard model. The latest LHCb measurements of R_K* offer some new insight\nbeyond the previous measurement of R_K. We work out the present significance\nfor non-universality, and argue that claims of 5 sigma deviations from the SM\nbased on all present b -> s l+l- data including the ratios are misleading and\nare at present still based on guesstimates of hadronic power corrections in the\nb -> s l+l- angular observables.\n  We demonstrate that only a small part of the luminosity of 50 fb^-1 foreseen\nto be accumulated by the LHCb will be needed to offer soon a definite answer to\nthe present question whether we see a very small glimpse of lepton flavour\nnon-universal new physics or not.\n  We also present new predictions for other ratios based on our analysis of the\npresent measurements of the ratios R_K^(*) and analyse if they are able to\ndifferentiate between various new physics options within the effective field\ntheory at present or in the near future.\n", "  In finite-volume-based flow simulations, absorbing layers are widely used to\nreduce pressure wave reflections at boundaries of the computational domain. A\ndisadvantage of absorbing layers is that they contain case-dependent\nparameters; thus the question is how to optimally tune these parameters, so\nthat a desired reduction of reflections can be obtained? As a step towards the\nanswer of these questions, this article presents a theory which predicts\nreflection coefficients for absorbing layers. The theory is given for 1D-wave\npropagation and is then extended to 2D and 3D to cover waves of oblique\nincidence. The theory is validated via flow simulations of regular and\nirregular pressure waves in air and water, based on Navier-Stokes-type\nequations and the finite-volume method. Theory predictions and simulation\nresults show good agreement. It is demonstrated how the theory can be used to\noptimally tune the absorbing layer parameters to minimize undesired wave\nreflection. Thus the theory has benefits for a wide range of applications of\nfinite-volume-based flow simulations in industrial practice.\n", "  We propose a model to explain tiny masses of neutrinos with the lepton number\nconservation, where neither too heavy particles beyond the TeV-scale nor tiny\ncoupling constants are required. Assignments of conserving lepton numbers to\nnew fields result in an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry that stabilizes the dark matter\ncandidate (the lightest $Z_2$-odd particle). In this model, $Z_2$-odd particles\nplay an important role to generate the mass of neutrinos. The scalar dark\nmatter in our model can satisfy constraints on the dark matter abundance and\nthose from direct searches. It is also shown that the strong first-order phase\ntransition, which is required for the electroweak baryogenesis, can be realized\nin our model. In addition, the scalar potential can in principle contain\nCP-violating phases, which can also be utilized for the baryogenesis.\nTherefore, three problems in the standard model, namely absence of neutrino\nmasses, the dark matter candidate, and the mechanism to generate baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe, may be simultaneously resolved at the TeV-scale.\nPhenomenology of this model is also discussed briefly.\n", "  The ${\\it {spin \\ \\ light \\ \\ of \\ \\ neutrino}}$ ($SL\\nu$) is a new possible\nmechanism of electromagnetic radiation by a massive neutrino (with a nonzero\nmagnetic moment) moving in media. Since the prediction of this mechanism, the\nquestion has been debated in a number of publications as whether the effect can\nbe of any significance for realistic astrophysical conditions. Although this\neffect is strongly suppressed due to smallness of neutrino magnetic moment, for\nultra-high energy neutrinos (PeV neutrinos recently observed by the IceCube\ncollaboration, for instance) the $SL\\nu$ might be of interest in the case of\nneutrinos propagating in dense matter. An advanced view on the $SL\\nu$ in\nmatter is given, and several astrophysical settings (a neutron star, supernova,\nGamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and relic neutrino background) for which the effect can\nbe realized are considered. Taking into account the threshold condition and\nalso several competing processes, we determine conditions for which the $SL\\nu$\nmechanism is possible. We conclude that the most favorable case of the effect\nmanifestation is provided by ultra dense matter of neutron stars and ultrahigh\nenergy of the radiating neutrino, and note that these conditions can be met\nwithin galaxy clusters. It is also shown that due to the $SL\\nu$ specific\npolarization properties this electromagnetic mechanism is of interest in the\nconnection with the observed polarization of GRB emission.\n", "  Flavour physics observables are excellent probes of new physics up to very\nhigh energy scales. Here we present FlavBit, the dedicated flavour physics\nmodule of the global-fitting package GAMBIT. FlavBit includes custom\nimplementations of various likelihood routines for a wide range of flavour\nobservables, including detailed uncertainties and correlations associated with\nLHCb measurements of rare, leptonic and semileptonic decays of B and D mesons,\nkaons and pions. It provides a generalised interface to external theory codes\nsuch as SuperIso, allowing users to calculate flavour observables in and beyond\nthe Standard Model, and then test them in detail against all relevant\nexperimental data. We describe FlavBit and its constituent physics in some\ndetail, then give examples from supersymmetry and effective field theory\nillustrating how it can be used both as a standalone library for flavour\nphysics, and within GAMBIT.\n", "  We introduce and study dynamical probes of band structure topology in the\npost-quench time-evolution from mixed initial states of quantum many-body\nsystems. Our construction generalizes the notion of dynamical quantum phase\ntransitions (DQPTs), a real-time counterpart of conventional equilibrium phase\ntransitions in quantum dynamics, to finite temperatures and generalized Gibbs\nensembles. The non-analytical signatures hallmarking these mixed state DQPTs\nare found to be characterized by observable phase singularities manifesting in\nthe dynamical formation of vortex-antivortex pairs in the interferometric phase\nof the density matrix. Studying quenches in Chern insulators, we find that\nchanges in the topological properties of the Hamiltonian can be identified in\nthis scenario, without ever preparing a topologically non-trivial or\nlow-temperature initial state. Our observations are of immediate relevance for\ncurrent experiments aimed at realizing topological phases in ultracold atomic\ngases.\n", "  We report the detection of ADFS-27, a dusty, starbursting major merger at a\nredshift of z=5.655, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA). ADFS-27 was selected from Herschel/SPIRE and APEX/LABOCA data as an\nextremely red \"870 micron riser\" (i.e., S_250<S_350<S_500<S_870), demonstrating\nthe utility of this technique to identify some of the highest-redshift dusty\ngalaxies. A scan of the 3mm atmospheric window with ALMA yields detections of\nCO(5-4) and CO(6-5) emission, and a tentative detection of H2O(211-202)\nemission, which provides an unambiguous redshift measurement. The strength of\nthe CO lines implies a large molecular gas reservoir with a mass of\nM_gas=2.5x10^11(alpha_CO/0.8)(0.39/r_51) Msun, sufficient to maintain its ~2400\nMsun/yr starburst for at least ~100 Myr. The 870 micron dust continuum emission\nis resolved into two components, 1.8 and 2.1 kpc in diameter, separated by 9.0\nkpc, with comparable dust luminosities, suggesting an ongoing major merger. The\ninfrared luminosity of L_IR~=2.4x10^13Lsun implies that this system represents\na binary hyper-luminous infrared galaxy, the most distant of its kind presently\nknown. This also implies star formation rate surface densities of Sigma_SFR=730\nand 750Msun/yr/kpc2, consistent with a binary \"maximum starburst\". The\ndiscovery of this rare system is consistent with a significantly higher space\ndensity than previously thought for the most luminous dusty starbursts within\nthe first billion years of cosmic time, easing tensions regarding the space\ndensities of z~6 quasars and massive quiescent galaxies at z>~3.\n", "  We present and assess a Bayesian method to interpret gravitational wave\nsignals from binary black holes. Our method directly compares gravitational\nwave data to numerical relativity simulations. This procedure bypasses\napproximations used in semi-analytical models for compact binary coalescence.\nIn this work, we use only the full posterior parameter distribution for generic\nnonprecessing binaries, drawing inferences away from the set of NR simulations\nused, via interpolation of a single scalar quantity (the marginalized\nlog-likelihood, $\\ln {\\cal L}$) evaluated by comparing data to nonprecessing\nbinary black hole simulations. We also compare the data to generic simulations,\nand discuss the effectiveness of this procedure for generic sources. We\nspecifically assess the impact of higher order modes, repeating our\ninterpretation with both $l\\le2$ as well as $l\\le3$ harmonic modes. Using the\n$l\\le3$ higher modes, we gain more information from the signal and can better\nconstrain the parameters of the gravitational wave signal. We assess and\nquantify several sources of systematic error that our procedure could\nintroduce, including simulation resolution and duration; most are negligible.\nWe show through examples that our method can recover the parameters for equal\nmass, zero spin; GW150914-like; and unequal mass, precessing spin sources. Our\nstudy of this new parameter estimation method demonstrates we can quantify and\nunderstand the systematic and statistical error. This method allows us to use\nhigher order modes from numerical relativity simulations to better constrain\nthe black hole binary parameters.\n", "  We discuss the role of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations in unveiling the\norigin of the emitting particles in PWNe. After describing the basics of the\nPIC technique, we summarize its implications for the quiescent and the flaring\nemission of the Crab Nebula, as a prototype of PWNe. A consensus seems to be\nemerging that, in addition to the standard scenario of particle acceleration\nvia the Fermi process at the termination shock of the pulsar wind, magnetic\nreconnection in the wind, at the termination shock and in the Nebula plays a\nmajor role in powering the multi-wavelength signatures of PWNe.\n", "  We consider the massless nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation in $1+1$ dimension\nwith scalar-scalar self-interaction $\\frac{g^2}{2} (\\bar{\\Psi} \\Psi)^2$ in the\npresence of three external electromagnetic potentials $V(x)$, a potential\nbarrier, a constant potential, and a potential well. By solving numerically the\nNLD equation, we find that, for all three cases, after a short transit time,\nthe initial pulse breaks into two pulses which are solutions of the massless\nlinear Dirac equation traveling in opposite directions with the speed of light.\nDuring this splitting the charge and the energy are conserved, whereas the\nmomentum is conserved when the solutions possess specific symmetries. For the\ncase of the constant potential, we derive exact analytical solutions of the\nmassless NLD equation that are also solutions of the massless linearized Dirac\nequation.\n", "  The topology of two-dimensional movement allows for existing of anyons --\nparticles obeying statistics intermediate between that of bosons and fermions.\nIn this article, the functional form of the occupation numbers of free anyons\nis suggested as a modification of the Gibbs factor in the Bose and Fermi\nstatistics. The proposed expressions are studied in the bosonic and fermionic\nlimits. The obtained virial coefficients coincide with those of free anyons up\nto the fourth and fifth virial coefficients (the proposed approach can be\nextended for higher ones as well) and up to the second order in the anyonic\nparameter. The effective excitation spectrum corresponding to anyons is\ncalculated.\n", "  We consider the problem of computing first-passage time distributions for\nreaction processes modelled by master equations. We show that this generally\nintractable class of problems is equivalent to a sequential Bayesian inference\nproblem for an auxiliary observation process. The solution can be approximated\nefficiently by solving a closed set of coupled ordinary differential equations\n(for the low-order moments of the process) whose size scales with the number of\nspecies. We apply it to an epidemic model and a trimerisation process, and show\ngood agreement with stochastic simulations.\n", "  We study systematically resource measures of coherence and entanglement based\non R\\'enyi relative entropies, which include the logarithmic robustness of\ncoherence, geometric coherence, and conventional relative entropy of coherence\ntogether with their entanglement analogues. First, we show that each R\\'enyi\nrelative entropy of coherence is equal to the corresponding R\\'enyi relative\nentropy of entanglement for any maximally correlated state. By virtue of this\nobservation, we establish a simple operational connection between entanglement\nmeasures and coherence measures based on R\\'enyi relative entropies. We then\nprove that all these coherence measures, including the logarithmic robustness\nof coherence, are additive. Accordingly, all these entanglement measures are\nadditive for maximally correlated states. In addition, we derive analytical\nformulas for R\\'enyi relative entropies of entanglement of maximally correlated\nstates and bipartite pure states, which reproduce a number of classic results\non the relative entropy of entanglement and logarithmic robustness of\nentanglement in a unified framework. Several nontrivial bounds for R\\'enyi\nrelative entropies of coherence (entanglement) are further derived, which\nimprove over results known previously. Moreover, we determine all states whose\nrelative entropy of coherence is equal to the logarithmic robustness of\ncoherence. As an application, we provide an upper bound for the exact coherence\ndistillation rate, which is saturated for pure states.\n", "  Strongly interacting matter undergoes a crossover phase transition at high\ntemperatures $T\\sim 10^{12}$ K and zero net-baryon density. A fundamental\nquestion in the theory of strong interactions, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is\nwhether a hot and dense system of quarks and gluons displays critical phenomena\nwhen doped with more quarks than antiquarks, where net-baryon number\nfluctuations diverge. Recent lattice QCD work indicates that such a critical\npoint can only occur in the baryon dense regime of the theory, which defies a\ndescription from first principles calculations. Here we use the holographic\ngauge/gravity correspondence to map the fluctuations of baryon charge in the\ndense quark-gluon liquid onto a numerically tractable gravitational problem\ninvolving the charge fluctuations of holographic black holes. This approach\nquantitatively reproduces ab initio results for the lowest order moments of the\nbaryon fluctuations and makes predictions for the higher order baryon\nsusceptibilities and also for the location of the critical point, which is\nfound to be within the reach of heavy ion collision experiments.\n", "  A nonlinear unified fluid model that describes the Equatorial Electrojet,\nincluding the Farley-Buneman and gradient-drift plasma instabilities, is\ndefined and shown to be a noncanonical Hamiltonian system. Two geometric\nconstants of motion for the model are obtained and shown to be Casimir\ninvariants. A reformulation of the model shows the roles of the\ndensity-gradient scale-length ($L_n$) and the cross-field drift-velocity\n(${\\upsilon}_E$) in controlling the dynamics of unstable modes in the growing,\ntransition, and saturation phases of a simulation.\n", "  We study the spin-charge conversion mechanisms in a two-dimensional gas of\nelectrons moving in a smooth disorder potential by accounting for both\nRashba-type and Mott's skew scattering contributions. We find that quantum\ninterference effects between spin-flip and skew scattering give rise to\nanisotropic spin precession scattering (ASP), a direct spin-charge conversion\nmechanism that was discovered in an earlier study of graphene decorated with\nadatoms [C. Huang \\emph{et al.} Phys.~Rev.~B \\textbf{94} 085414.~(2016)]. Our\nfindings suggest that, together with other spin-charge conversion mechanisms\nsuch as the inverse galvanic effect, ASP is a fairly universal phenomenon that\nshould be present in disordered two-dimensional systems lacking inversion\nsymmetry.\n", "  We present 108 full-sky gravitational lensing simulation data sets generated\nby performing multiple-lens plane ray-tracing through high-resolution\ncosmological $N$-body simulations. The data sets include full-sky convergence\nand shear maps from redshifts $z=0.05$ to $5.3$ at intervals of $150 \\,\nh^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ comoving radial distance (corresponding to a redshift interval\nof $\\Delta z \\simeq 0.05$ at the nearby universe), enabling the construction of\na mock shear catalog for an arbitrary source distribution up to $z=5.3$. The\ndark matter halos are identified from the same $N$-body simulations with enough\nmass resolution to resolve the host halos of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) CMASS and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). Angular positions and redshifts\nof the halos are provided by a ray-tracing calculation, enabling the creation\nof a mock halo catalog to be used for galaxy-galaxy and cluster-galaxy lensing.\nThe simulation also yields maps of gravitational lensing deflections for a\nsource redshift at the last scattering surface, and we provide 108 realizations\nof lensed cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps in which the post-Born\ncorrections caused by multiple light scattering are included. We present basic\nstatistics of the simulation data, including the angular power spectra of\ncosmic shear, CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, galaxy-galaxy\nlensing signals for halos, and their covariances. The angular power spectra of\nthe cosmic shear and CMB anisotropies agree with theoretical predictions within\n$5\\%$ up to $\\ell = 3000$ (or at an angular scale $\\theta > 0.5$ arcsin). The\nsimulation data sets are generated primarily for the ongoing Subaru Hyper\nSuprime-Cam survey but are freely available for download at\nhttp://cosmo.phys.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/takahasi/allsky_raytracing.\n", "  Quantum mechanics presents peculiar properties that, on the one hand, have\nbeen the subject of several theoretical and experimental studies about its very\nfoundations and, on the other hand, provide tools for developing new\ntechnologies, the so-called quantum technologies. The nonclassicality pointed\nout by Leggett-Garg inequalities has represented, with Bell inequalities, one\nof the most investigated subject. In this letter we study the connection of\nLeggett-Garg inequalities with a new emerging field of quantum measurement, the\nweak values. In particular, we perform an experimental study of the four-time\ncorrelators Legget-Garg test, by exploiting single and sequential weak\nmeasurements performed on heralded single photons. We show violation of a\nfour-parameters Leggett-Garg inequality in different experimental conditions,\ndemonstrating an interesting connection between Leggett-Garg inequality\nviolation and anomalous weak values.\n", "  We consider the impact of neutrino self-interactions described by an\neffective four-fermion coupling on cosmological observations. Implementing the\nexact Boltzmann hierarchy for interacting neutrinos first derived in\n[arxiv:1409.1577] into the Boltzmann solver CLASS, we perform a detailed\nnumerical analysis of the effects of the interaction on the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropies, and compare our results with known\napproximations in the literature. While we find good agreement between our\nexact approach and the relaxation time approximation used in some recent\nstudies, the popular $\\left( c_{\\text{eff}}^2,c_{\\text{vis}}^2\n\\right)$-parameterisation fails to reproduce the correct scale dependence of\nthe CMB temperature power spectrum. We then proceed to derive constraints on\nthe effective coupling constant $G_{\\text{eff}}$ using currently available\ncosmological data via an MCMC analysis. Interestingly, our results reveal a\nbimodal posterior distribution, where one mode represents the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM limit with $G_{\\rm eff} \\lesssim 10^8 \\, G_{\\rm F}$, and the other\na scenario in which neutrinos self-interact with an effective coupling constant\n$G_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 3 \\times 10^9 \\, G_{\\rm F}$.\n", "  Shortly after the discovery of Weyl semimetals properties related to the\ntopology of their bulk band structure have been observed, e.g. signatures of\nthe chiral anomaly and Fermi arc surface states. These essentially single\nparticle phenomena are well understood but whether interesting many-body\neffects due to interactions arise in Weyl systems remains much less explored.\nHere, we investigate the effect of interactions in a microscopic model of a\ntype-II Weyl semimetal in a strong magnetic field. We identify a charge density\nwave (CDW) instability even for weak interactions stemming from the emergent\nnesting properties of the type-II Weyl Landau level dispersion. We map out the\ndependence of this CDW on magnetic field strength. Remarkably, as a function of\ndecreasing temperature a cascade of CDW transitions emerges and we predict\ncharacteristic signatures for experiments.\n", "  Lattice QCD calculations of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution\nfunctions (TMDs) in nucleons are presented, based on the evaluation of nucleon\nmatrix elements of quark bilocal operators with a staple-shaped gauge\nconnection. Both time-reversal odd effects, namely, the generalized Sivers and\nBoer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts, as well as time-reversal even effects,\nnamely, the generalized transversity and one of the generalized worm-gear\nshifts are studied. Results are obtained on two different $n_f = 2+1$ flavor\nensembles with approximately matching pion masses but very different\ndiscretization schemes: domain-wall fermions (DWF) with lattice spacing\n$a=0.084$ fm and pion mass 297 MeV, and Wilson-clover fermions with $a=0.114$\nfm and pion mass 317 MeV. Comparison of the results on the two ensembles yields\ninsight into the length scales at which lattice discretization errors are\nsmall, and into the extent to which the renormalization pattern obeyed by the\ncontinuum QCD TMD operator continues to apply in the lattice formulation. For\nthe studied TMD observables, the results are found to be consistent between the\ntwo ensembles at sufficiently large separation of the quark fields within the\noperator, whereas deviations are observed in the local limit and in the case of\na straight link gauge connection, which is relevant to the studies of parton\ndistribution functions. Furthermore, the lattice estimates of the generalized\nSivers shift obtained here are confronted with, and are seen to tend towards, a\nphenomenological estimate extracted from experimental data.\n", "  Topological insulating phases are primarily associated with condensed-matter\nsystems, which typically feature short-range interactions. Nevertheless, many\nrealizations of quantum matter can exhibit long-range interactions, and it is\nstill largely unknown the effect that these latter may exert upon the\ntopological phases. In this Letter, we investigate the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger\ntopological insulator in the presence of long-range interactions. We show that\nthis model can be readily realized in quantum simulators with trapped ions by\nmeans of a periodic driving. Our results indicate that the localization of the\nassociated edge states is enhanced by the long-range interactions, and that the\nlocalized components survive within the ground state of the model. These\neffects could be easily confirmed in current state-of-the-art experimental\nimplementations.\n", "  We derive a universal formula for the average heavy-heavy-light structure\nconstants for 2d CFTs with non-vanishing u(1) charge. The derivation utilizes\nthe modular properties of one-point functions on the torus. Refinements in N=2\nSCFTs, show that the resulting Cardy-like formula for the structure constants\nhas precisely the same shifts in the central charge as that of the\nthermodynamic entropy found earlier. This analysis generalizes the recent\nresults by Kraus and Maloney for CFTs with an additional global u(1) symmetry.\nOur results at large central charge are also shown to match with computations\nfrom the holographic dual, which suggest that the averaged CFT three-point\ncoefficient also serves as an useful probe of detecting black hole hair.\n", "  Low-energy random number generation is critical for many emerging computing\nschemes proposed to complement or replace von Neumann architectures. However,\ncurrent random number generators are always associated with an energy cost that\nis prohibitive for these computing schemes. In this paper, we introduce random\nnumber bit generation based on specific nanodevices: superparamagnetic tunnel\njunctions. We experimentally demonstrate high quality random bit generation\nthat represents orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency compared\nto current solutions. We show that the random generation speed improves with\nnanodevice scaling, and investigate the impact of temperature, magnetic field\nand crosstalk. Finally, we show how alternative computing schemes can be\nimplemented using superparamagentic tunnel junctions as random number\ngenerators. These results open the way for fabricating efficient hardware\ncomputing devices leveraging stochasticity, and highlight a novel use for\nemerging nanodevices.\n", "  We report a transition from a disordered state to an ordered state in the\nflow of nearly mono-disperse granular matter flowing in an inclined channel\nwith a bumpy base, in discrete element method simulations. For low\nparticle-sidewall friction coefficients, the particles are disordered and the\nBagnold velocity profile is obtained. However, for high sidewall friction, an\nordered state is obtained, characterized by a layering of the particles and\nhexagonal packing of the particles in each layer. The extent of ordering,\nquantified by the local bond-orientational order parameter, varies in the\ncross- section of the channel, with the highest ordering near the side walls.\nThe flow transition significantly affects the local rheology: the effective\nfriction coefficient is lower, and the packing fraction is higher, in the\nordered state compared to the disordered state. A simple model, incorporating\nthe extent of local ordering, is shown to describe the rheology of the system.\n", "  This paper presents the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH) of\nnearby galaxies with the aim of furthering our understanding of the different\nprocesses involved in the formation and evolution of galaxies. To this end, we\napply the fossil record method of stellar population synthesis to a rich and\ndiverse data set of 436 galaxies observed with integral field spectroscopy in\nthe CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, with stellar\nmasses ranging from $M_\\star \\sim 10^9$ to $7 \\times 10^{11} M_\\odot$. Spectral\nsynthesis techniques are applied to the datacubes to retrieve the spatially\nresolved time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), its intensity\n($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$), and other descriptors of the 2D-SFH in seven bins of\ngalaxy morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc, and Sd), and five bins of stellar\nmass. Our main results are: a) Galaxies form very fast independently of their\ncurrent stellar mass, with the peak of star formation at high redshift ($z >\n2$). Subsequent star formation is driven by $M_\\star$ and morphology, with less\nmassive and later type spirals showing more prolonged periods of star\nformation. b) At any epoch in the past the SFR is proportional to $M_\\star$,\nwith most massive galaxies having the highest absolute (but lowest specific)\nSFRs. c) While nowadays $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ is similar for all spirals, and\nsignificantly lower in early type galaxies (ETG), in the past $\\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}$ scales well with morphology. The central regions of today's ETGs are\nwhere $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ reached the highest values ($> 10^3\n\\,M_\\odot\\,$Gyr$^{-1}\\,$pc$^{-2}$), similar to those measured in high redshift\nstar forming galaxies. d) The evolution of $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ in Sbc systems\nmatches that of models for Milky-Way-like galaxies, suggesting that the\nformation of a thick disk may be a common phase in spirals at early epochs.\n", "  We study 1-dimensional chains of ghost-spins with nearest neighbour\ninteractions amongst them, developing further the study of ghost-spins in\nprevious work, defined as 2-state spin variables with indefinite norm. First we\nstudy finite ghost-spin chains with Ising-like nearest neighbour interactions:\nthis helps organize and clarify the study of entanglement earlier and we\ndevelop this further. Then we study a family of infinite ghost-spin chains with\na different Hamiltonian containing nearest neighbour hopping-type interactions.\nBy defining fermionic ghost-spin variables through a Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation, we argue that these ghost-spin chains lead in the continuum\nlimit to the $bc$-ghost CFTs.\n", "  We present calculations of molecular, atomic and ionic line emission from\nsimulations of giant molecular cloud (GMC) collisions. We post-process\nsnapshots of the magneto-hydrodynamical simulations presented in an earlier\npaper in this series by Wu et al. (2017) of colliding and non-colliding GMCs.\nUsing photodissociation region (PDR) chemistry and radiative transfer we\ncalculate the level populations and emission properties of $^{12}$CO $J=1-0$,\n[CI] $^3{\\rm\n  P}_1\\rightarrow{^3{\\rm P}}_0$ at $609\\,\\mu$m, [CII] $158\\,\\mu$m and [OI]\n$^3{\\rm P}_1\\rightarrow{^3{\\rm P}}_0$ transition at $63\\,\\mu$m. From integrated\nintensity emission maps and position-velocity diagrams, we find that\nfine-structure lines, particularly the [CII] $158\\,\\mu$m, can be used as a\ndiagnostic tracer for cloud-cloud collision activity. These results hold even\nin more evolved systems in which the collision signature in molecular lines has\nbeen diminished.\n", "  We formulate a kinematical extension of Double Field Theory on a\n$2d$-dimensional para-Hermitian manifold $(\\mathcal{P},\\eta,\\omega)$ where the\n$O(d,d)$ metric $\\eta$ is supplemented by an almost symplectic two-form\n$\\omega$. Together $\\eta$ and $\\omega$ define an almost bi-Lagrangian structure\n$K$ which provides a splitting of the tangent bundle\n$T\\mathcal{P}=L\\oplus\\tilde{L}$ into two Lagrangian subspaces. In this paper a\ncanonical connection and a corresponding generalised Lie derivative for the\nLeibniz algebroid on $T\\mathcal{P}$ are constructed. We find integrability\nconditions under which the symmetry algebra closes for general $\\eta$ and\n$\\omega$, even if they are not flat and constant. This formalism thus provides\na generalisation of the kinematical structure of Double Field Theory. We also\nshow that this formalism allows one to reconcile and unify Double Field Theory\nwith Generalised Geometry which is thoroughly discussed.\n", "  We report on our independent investigations of the puzzle of cosmological\nperturbations in extended quasidilaton. We confirm the claims of presence of\nthe Boulware-Deser ghost. We use both the language of cosmological\nperturbations with broken diffeomorphisms and the Stuckelberg approach.\n", "  We investigate the ability of the $S_3$ scalar leptoquark to address the\nrecent hints of lepton universality violation in $B$ meson decays. The $S_3$\nleptoquark with quantum numbers $(\\overline{\\mathbf{3}},\\mathbf{3},1/3)$\nnaturally emerges in the context of an $SU(5)$ GUT model without any conflict\nwith the stringent limits from observed nucleon stability. Scalar leptoquark\n$S_3$ with left-handed couplings to 2nd and 3rd generations of charged leptons\nand down-type quarks seems well-suited to address both $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and\n$R_{D^{(*)}}$. We quantify this suitability with numerical fits to a plethora\nof relevant flavor observables. The proposed $SU(5)$ model calls for a second\nleptoquark state, i.e., $\\tilde{R}_2$ with quantum numbers\n$(\\mathbf{3},\\mathbf{2},1/6)$, if one is to generate gauge coupling unification\nand neutrino mass. We accordingly include it in our study to investigate\n$\\tilde{R}_2$'s ability to offset adverse effects of $S_3$ and thus improve a\nquality of numerical fits. A global fit of the leptoquark Yukawa couplings\nshows that large couplings of light $S_3$ to $\\tau$ leptons are preferred. We\nfurthermore identify $B \\to K^{(*)} \\bar\\nu\\nu$ as the most sensitive channel\nto probe the preferred region of parameter space. Large couplings of $S_3$ to\n$\\tau$ leptons are finally confronted with the experimental searches for $\\tau$\nfinal states at the Large Hadron Collider. These searches comprise a study of\ndecay products of the leptoquark pair production, as well as, and more\nimportantly, an analysis of the high-mass $\\tau\\tau$ final states.\n", "  Topological semimetals, representing a new topological phase that lacks a\nfull bandgap in bulk states and exhibiting nontrivial topological orders,\nrecently have been extended to photonic systems, predominantly in photonic\ncrystals and to a lesser extent, metamaterials. Photonic crystal realizations\nof Dirac degeneracies are protected by various space symmetries, where Bloch\nmodes span the spin and orbital subspaces. Here, we theoretically show that\nDirac points can also be realized in effective media through the intrinsic\ndegrees of freedom in electromagnetism under electromagnetic duality. A pair of\nspin polarized Fermi arc like surface states is observed at the interface\nbetween air and the Dirac metamaterials. These surface states show linear\nk-space dispersion relation, resulting in nearly diffraction-less propagation.\nFurthermore, eigen reflection fields show the decomposition from a Dirac point\nto two Weyl points. We also find the topological correlation between a Dirac\npoint and vortex/vector beams in classic photonics. The theoretical proposal of\nphotonic Dirac point lays foundation for unveiling the connection between\nintrinsic physics and global topology in electromagnetism.\n", "  We propose a new framework, merging High Energy Factorization with\nfinal-state jet quenching effects due to interactions in a quark-gluon plasma,\nto compute di-jet rates at mid- and forward rapidity. It allows to consistently\nstudy the interplay of initial-state effects with medium interactions, opening\nthe possibility for understanding the dynamics of hard probes in heavy-ion\ncollisions and the QGP evolution in rapidity.\n", "  The direct measurement of Berry phases is still a great challenge in\ncondensed matter systems. The bottleneck has been the ability to adiabatically\ndrive an electron coherently across a large portion of the Brillouin zone in a\nsolid where the scattering is strong and complicated. We break through this\nbottleneck and show that high-order sideband generation (HSG) in semiconductors\nis intimately affected by Berry phases. Electron-hole recollisions and HSG\noccur when a near-band gap laser beam excites a semiconductor that is driven by\nsufficiently strong terahertz (THz)-frequency electric fields. We carried out\nexperimental and theoretical studies of HSG from three GaAs/AlGaAs quantum\nwells. The observed HSG spectra contain sidebands up to the 90th order, to our\nknowledge the highest-order optical nonlinearity observed in solids. The\nhighest-order sidebands are associated with electron-hole pairs driven\ncoherently across roughly 10% of the Brillouin zone around the \\Gamma point.\nThe principal experimental claim is a dynamical birefringence: the sidebands,\nwhen the order is high enough (> 20), are usually stronger when the exciting\nnear-infrared (NIR) and the THz electric fields are polarized perpendicular\nthan parallel; the sideband intensities depend on the angles between the THz\nfield and the crystal axes in samples with sufficiently weak quenched disorder;\nand the sidebands exhibit significant ellipticity that increases with\nincreasing sideband order, despite nearly linear excitation and driving fields.\nWe explain dynamical birefringence by generalizing the three-step model for\nhigh order harmonic generation. The hole accumulates Berry phases due to\nvariation of its internal state as the quasi-momentum changes under the THz\nfield. Dynamical birefringence arises from quantum interference between\ntime-reversed pairs of electron-hole recollision pathways.\n", "  Diffuse, extended radio emission in galaxy clusters, commonly referred to as\nradio halos, indicate the presence of high energy cosmic ray (CR) electrons and\ncluster-wide magnetic fields. We can predict from theory the expected surface\nbrightness of a radio halo, given magnetic field and CR density profiles.\nPrevious studies have shown that the nature of CR transport can radically\neffect the expected radio halo emission from clusters (Wiener et al. 2013).\nReasonable levels of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave damping can lead to\nsignificant CR streaming speeds. But a careful treatment of MHD waves in a high\n$\\beta$ plasma, as expected in cluster environments, reveals damping rates may\nbe enhanced by a factor of $\\beta^{1/2}$. This leads to faster CR streaming and\nlower surface brightnesses than without this effect. In this work we re-examine\nthe simplified, 1D Coma cluster simulations (with radial magnetic fields) of\nWiener et al. (2013) and discuss observable consequences of this high $\\beta$\ndamping. Future work is required to study this effect in more realistic\nsimulations.\n", "  Dark matter particles could annihilate into light and metastable mediators\nsubsequently decaying far away from where they are produced. In this scenario,\nthe indirect signatures of dark matter are altered with respect to the\nconventional situation where standard model particles are directly injected\nwhere annihilation happens. We explore here this new phenomenology for which we\ndevise the tools. We calculate the effective dark matter distribution resulting\nfrom the smearing by mediator propagation. We derive the fluxes of mediators\nand their decay particles. We study how the $J$-factor, which naturally appears\nin the calculation of the dark matter induced gamma ray signal, is modified in\nthe presence of mediators. We also derive the anisotropy which the cosmic ray\npositron flux exhibits in this scenario. We finally comment upon a recent\nproposal based on long-lived mediators where the effective dark matter density\nat the Earth is increased such as to explain the cosmic ray positron anomaly.\nWe conclude that this scenario is barely tenable as regards the very dense dark\nmatter spike which it requires at the Galactic center. The associated positron\nanisotropy is very small and undetectable, except at high energies where it\nreaches a level of order $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$.\n", "  We study shock propagation in a system of initially stationary hard-spheres\nthat is driven by a continuous injection of particles at the origin. The\ndisturbance created by the injection of energy spreads radially outwards\nthrough collision between particles. Using scaling arguments, we determine the\nexponent characterizing the power law growth of this disturbance in all\ndimensions. The scaling functions describing the various physical quantities\nare determined using large scale event driven simulations in two and three\ndimensions for both the elastic and the inelastic system. The results are shown\nto describe well the data from two different experiments on granular systems\nthat are similarly driven.\n", "  It is of interest to determine the exit angle of a vortex from a\nsuperconducting surface, since this affects the intervortex interactions and\ntheir consequences. Two ways to determine this angle are to image the vortex\nmagnetic fields above the surface, or the vortex core shape at the surface. In\nthis work we evaluate the field h(x, y, z) above a flat superconducting surface\nx, y and the currents J(x,y) at that surface for a straight vortex tilted\nrelative to the normal to the surface, for both the isotropic and anisotropic\ncases. In principle, these results can be used to determine the vortex exit\ntilt angle from analyses of magnetic field imaging or density of states data.\n", "  We present the discovery of the variable optical and X-ray counterparts to\nthe radio millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J1306-40, recently discovered by Keane\net al. We find that both the optical and X-ray fluxes are modulated with the\nsame period, which allows us to measure for the first time the orbital period\nP$_{\\rm orb}$=1.09716[6] d. The optical properties are consistent with a main\nsequence companion with spectral type G to mid K and, together with the X-ray\nluminosity (8.8$\\times$10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-10 keV band, for a\ndistance of 1.2 kpc), confirm the redback classification of this pulsar. Our\nresults establish the binary nature of PSR J1306-40, which has the longest\nP$_{\\rm orb}$ among all known compact binary MSPs in the Galactic disk. We\nbriefly discuss these findings in the context of irradiation and intrabinary\nshock emission in compact binary MSPs.\n", "  The exact law for fully developed homogeneous compressible\nmagnetohydrodynamics (CMHD) turbulence is derived. For an isothermal plasma,\nwithout the assumption of isotropy, the exact law is expressed as a function of\nthe plasma velocity field, the compressible Alfv\\'en velocity and the scalar\ndensity, instead of the Els\\\"asser variables used in previous works. The\ntheoretical results show four different types of terms that are involved in the\nnonlinear cascade of the total energy in the inertial range. Each category is\nexamined in detail, in particular those that can be written either as source or\nflux terms. Finally, the role of the background magnetic field $B_0$ is\nhighlighted and comparison with the incompressible MHD (IMHD) model is\ndiscussed. This point is particularly important when testing the exact law on\nnumerical simulations and in situ observations in space plasmas.\n", "  Position determination of photon emitters and associated strong field\nparallax effects are investigated using relativistic optics when the photon\norbits are confined to the equatorial plane of the Schwarzschild spacetime. We\nassume the emitter is at a fixed space position and the receiver moves along a\ncircular geodesic orbit. This study requires solving the inverse problem of\ndetermining the (spatial) intersection point of two null geodesic initial data\nproblems, serving as a simplified model for applications in relativistic\nastrometry as well as in radar and satellite communications.\n", "  The SCUBA-2 Ultra Deep Imaging EAO Survey (STUDIES) is a three-year JCMT\nLarge Program aiming at reaching the 450 $\\mu$m confusion limit in the\nCOSMOS-CANDELS region, to study a representative sample of the high-redshift\nfar-infrared galaxy population that gives rise to the bulk of the far-infrared\nbackground. We present the first-year data from STUDIES. We have reached a 450\n$\\mu$m noise level of 0.91~mJy for point sources at the map center, covered an\narea of 151 arcmin$^2$, and detected 98 and 141 sources at 4.0 and 3.5\n$\\sigma$, respectively. Our derived counts are best constrained in the 3.5-25\nmJy regime using directly detected sources. Below the detection limits, our\nfluctuation analysis further constrains the slope of the counts down to 1 mJy.\nThe resulting counts at 1-25 mJy are consistent with a power law having a slope\nof $-2.59$ ($\\pm0.10$ for 3.5-25 mJy, and $^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ for 1-3.5 mJy).\nThere is no evidence of a faint-end termination or turn-over of the counts in\nthis flux density range. Our counts are also consistent with previous SCUBA-2\nblank-field and lensing cluster surveys. The integrated surface brightness from\nour counts down to 1 mJy is $90.0\\pm17.2$ Jy deg$^{-2}$, which can account for\nup to $83^{+15}_{-16}\\%$ of the COBE 450 $\\mu$m background. We show that\nHerschel counts at 350 and 500 $\\mu$m are significantly higher than our 450\n$\\mu$m counts, likely caused by its large beam and source clustering.\nHigh-angular resolution instruments like SCUBA-2 at 450 $\\mu$m are therefore\nhighly beneficial for measuring the luminosity and spatial density of\nhigh-redshift dusty galaxies.\n", "  We consider a model of a Brownian motor composed of two coupled overdamped\ndegrees of freedom moving in periodic potentials and driven by two heat\nreservoirs. This model exhibits a spontaneous breaking of symmetry and gives\nrise to directed transport in the case of a non- vanishing interparticle\ninteraction strength. For strong coupling between the particles we derive an\nexpression for the propagation velocity valid for arbitrary periodic\npotentials. In the limit of strong coupling the model is equivalent to the\nB\\\"uttiker-Landauer model [1-3] for a single particle diffusing in an\nenvironment with position dependent temperature. By using numerical\ncalculations of the Fokker-Planck equation and simulations of the Langevin\nequations we study the model for arbitrary coupling, retrieving many features\nof the strong coupling limit. In particular, directed transport emerges even\nfor symmetric potentials. For distinct heat reservoirs the heat currents are\nwell-defined quantities allowing a study of the motor efficiency. We show that\nthe optimal working regime occurs for moderate coupling. Finally, we introduce\na model with discrete phase space which captures the essential features of the\ncontinuous model, can be solved in the limit of weak coupling, and exhibits a\nlarger efficiency than the continuous counterpart.\n", "  This article presents a search for flavour-changing neutral currents in the\ndecay of a top quark into an up-type ($q = c, u$) quark and a Higgs boson,\nwhere the Higgs boson decays into two photons. The proton--proton collision\ndata set analysed amounts to 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected by\nthe ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Top quark pair events are searched for, where\none top quark decays into $qH$ and the other decays into $bW$. Both the\nhadronic and leptonic decay modes of the $W$ boson are used. No significant\nexcess is observed and an upper limit is set on the $t \\rightarrow cH$\nbranching ratio of $2.2\\times 10^{-3}$ at the 95% confidence level, while the\nexpected limit in the absence of signal is $1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$. The\ncorresponding limit on the $tcH$ coupling is 0.090 at the 95% confidence level.\nThe observed upper limit on the $t \\rightarrow uH$ branching ratio is $2.4\n\\times 10^{-3}$.\n", "  We revisit the longstanding question of the onset of sediment transport\ndriven by a turbulent fluid flow via laboratory measurements. We use particle\ntracking velocimetry to quantify the fluid flow as well as the motion of\nindividual grains. As we increase the flow speed above the transition to\nsediment transport, we observe that an increasing fraction of grains are\ntransported downstream, although the average downstream velocity of the\ntransported grains remains roughly constant. However, we find that the fraction\nof mobilized grains does not vanish sharply at a critical flow rate.\nAdditionally, the distribution of the fluctuating velocities of non-transported\ngrains becomes broader with heavier tails, meaning that unambiguously\nseparating mobile and static grains is not possible. As an alternative\napproach, we quantify the statistics of grain velocities by using a mixture\nmodel consisting of two forms for the grain velocities: a decaying-exponential\ntail, which represents grains transported downstream, and a peaked distribution\ncentered at zero velocity, which represents grains that fluctuate due to the\nturbulent flow but remain in place. Our results suggest that more sophisticated\nstatistical measures may be required to quantify grain motion near the onset of\nsediment transport, particularly in the presence of turbulence.\n", "  We study numerically the spatial dynamics of light in periodic square\nlattices in the presence of a Kerr term, emphasizing the peculiarities stemming\nfrom the nonlinearity. We find that, under rather general circumstances, the\nphase pattern of the stable ground state depends on the character of the\nnonlinearity: the phase is spatially uniform if it is defocusing whereas in the\nfocusing case, it presents a chess board pattern, with a difference of $\\pi$\nbetween neighboring sites. We show that the lowest lying perturbative\nexcitations can be described as perturbations of the phase and that\nfinite-sized structures can act as tunable metawaveguides for them. The tuning\nis made by varying the intensity of the light that, because of the\nnonlinearity, affects the dynamics of the phase fluctuations. We interpret the\nresults using methods of condensed matter physics, based on an effective\ndescription of the optical system. This interpretation sheds new light on the\nphenomena, facilitating the understanding of individual systems and leading to\na framework for relating different problems with the same symmetry. In this\ncontext, we show that the perturbative excitations of the phase are\nNambu-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken $U(1)$ symmetry.\n", "  We perform a complete and systematic calculation of the octet-baryon form\nfactors within the fully covariant approach of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory\nat O(p^3). We use the extended on-mass shell renormalization scheme, and\ninclude explicitly the vector mesons and the spin-3/2 decuplet intermediate\nstates. Comparing these predictions with data including magnetic moments,\ncharges, and magnetic radii, we determine the unknown low-energy constants, and\ngive predictions for yet unmeasured observables, such as the magnetic moment of\nthe Sigma^0, and the charge and magnetic radii of the hyperons.\n", "  This work shows an unconventional route for spin-driven ferroelectricity\noriginating from a metastable magnetic field-induced canting of chromium\nsublattice in the presence of gadolinium moments in GdCrTiO5 at low\ntemperatures. Compared to the isostructural neodymium compound, significant\ndifferences of magnetism and magnetoelectric effects are seen. We present the\nresults of thorough investigations of temperature and magnetic field dependent\nmagnetization as well as ac and dc magnetic susceptibility. These bulk\nmeasurements are complemented by local-probe spectroscopy utilizing\nelectron-spin resonance and muon-spin rotation/relaxation for probing the\nchromium moments. Ferroelectric order is inferred from pyro- and magnetocurrent\nmeasurements. GdCrTiO5 shows a pyrocurrent signal around 10 K, only if the\nsystem is cooled in an applied magnetic field exceeding 10 kOe. A distinct\nspin-driven ferroelectric order is revealed in this state for temperatures\nbelow 10 K, which can be switched by changing magnetic-field direction and the\npolarity of the electric field. But, the magnetic measurements reveal no clear\nsignature of long-range magnetic ordering. The presence of such\nmeta-magnetoelectric-type behaviour in the absence of any meta-magnetic\nbehavior is rare in the literature. Our microscopic spectroscopy results\nindicate significant changes of the magnetic properties around 10 K. Probably\nthere is an exchange frustration between Gd and Cr moments, which prevents\nlong-range magnetic ordering at further high temperature. Below 10 K, weak\nmagnetic ordering occurs by minimizing frustration due to lattice distortion,\nwhich helps in magnetodielectric coupling. However, the non-polar distortion\nattains appreciable values after application of magnetic fields above 10 kOe to\nbreak the spatial inversion symmetry, which creates ferroelectricity.\n", "  We investigate the interplay of thermophoretic force and interfacial tension\non the capillary filling dynamics of a Newtonian nanofluid in a microchannel.\nIn our model, we also consider an intricate thermofluidic coupling by taking\nthe temperature dependence of viscosity aptly into account. This, in turn,\ndetermines the evolution of the viscous resistive force as the capillary front\nprogresses, and presents an involved inter-connection between the driving\nthermophoretic force and the viscous resistive force. The two distinct regimes\nof particle transport in a fluid medium, delineated by particle size, are\nexpounded to peruse the impact of imposed thermal gradients and particle size\non particle retaining propensity of the nanofluid. Additionally, we witness a\nsignificant reduction in particle bearing proclivity of the nanofluid with\nenhancement in a thermal gradient. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the\nthermophoretic actuation towards the filling of narrow capillaries under the\ninfluence of a thermal gradient.\n", "  The mergers of galaxy clusters are the most energetic events in the universe\nafter the Big Bang. With the increased availability of multi-object\nspectroscopy and X-ray data an ever increasing fraction of local clusters are\nrecognised as exhibiting signs of recent or past merging events on various\nscales. Our goal is to probe how these mergers affect the evolution and content\nof their member galaxies. We specifically aim to answer the following\nquestions: Is the quenching of star formation in merging clusters enhanced when\ncompared with relaxed clusters? Is the quenching preceded by a (short lived)\nburst of star formation? We obtained optical spectroscopy of >400 galaxies in\nthe field of the merging cluster Abell 520. We combine these observations with\narchival data to get a comprehensive picture of the state of star formation in\nthe members of this merging cluster. Finally, we compare these observations\nwith a control sample of 10 non-merging clusters at the same redshift from The\nArizona Cluster Redshift Survey (ACReS). We split the member galaxies in\npassive, star forming or recently quenched depending on their spectra. The core\nof the merger shows a decreased fraction of star forming galaxies compared to\nclusters in the non-merging sample. This region, dominated by passive galaxies,\nis extended along the axis of the merger. We find evidence of rapid quenching\nof the galaxies during the core passage with no signs of a star burst on the\ntime scales of the merger (~0.4Gyr). Additionally, we report the tentative\ndiscovery of an infalling group along the main filament feeding the merger,\ncurrently at ~2.5 Mpc from the merger centre. This group contains a high\nfraction of star forming galaxies as well as ~2/3 of all the recently quenched\ngalaxies in our survey.\n", "  To derive a power spectrum for energy density inhomogeneities in a closed\nuniverse, we study a spatially-closed inflation-modified hot big bang model\nwhose evolutionary history is divided into three epochs: an early\nslowly-rolling scalar field inflation epoch and the usual radiation and\nnon-relativistic matter epochs. (For our purposes it is not necessary to\nconsider a final dark energy dominated epoch.) We derive general solutions of\nthe relativistic linear perturbation equations in each epoch. The constants of\nintegration in the inflation epoch solutions are determined from de Sitter\ninvariant quantum-mechanical initial conditions in the Lorentzian section of\nthe inflating closed de Sitter space derived from Hawking's prescription that\nthe quantum state of the universe only include field configurations that are\nregular on the Euclidean (de Sitter) sphere section. The constants of\nintegration in the radiation and matter epoch solutions are determined from\njoining conditions derived by requiring that the linear perturbation equations\nremain nonsingular at the transitions between epochs. The matter epoch power\nspectrum of gauge-invariant energy density inhomogeneities is not a power law,\nand depends on spatial wavenumber in the way expected for a generalization to\nthe closed model of the standard flat-space scale-invariant power spectrum. The\npower spectrum we derive appears to differ from a number of other closed\ninflation model power spectra derived assuming different (presumably non de\nSitter invariant) initial conditions.\n", "  Results of recent experiment reinstate feasibility to the hypothesis that\nbiomolecular homochirality originates from beta decay. Coupled with hints that\nthis process occurred extraterrestrially suggests aluminum-26 as the most\nlikely source. If true, then its appropriateness is highly dependent on the\nhalf-life and energy of this decay. Demanding that this mechanism hold places\nnew constraints on the anthropically allowed range for multiple parameters,\nincluding the electron mass, difference between up and down quark masses, the\nfine structure constant, and the electroweak scale. These new constraints on\nparticle masses are tighter than those previously found. However, one edge of\nthe allowed region is nearly degenerate with an existing bound, which, using\nwhat is termed here as `the principle of noncoincident peril', is argued to be\na strong indicator that the fine structure constant must be an environmental\nparameter in the multiverse.\n", "  Dark photons in the MeV to GeV mass range are important targets for\nexperimental searches. We consider the case where dark photons $A'$ decay\ninvisibly to hidden dark matter $X$ through $A' \\to XX$. For generic masses,\nproposed accelerator searches are projected to probe the thermal target region\nof parameter space, where the $X$ particles annihilate through $XX \\to A' \\to\n\\text{SM}$ in the early universe and freeze out with the correct relic density.\nHowever, if $m_{A'} \\approx 2m_X$, dark matter annihilation is resonantly\nenhanced, shifting the thermal target region to weaker couplings. For $\\sim\n10\\%$ degeneracies, we find that the annihilation cross section is generically\nenhanced by four (two) orders of magnitude for scalar (pseudo-Dirac) dark\nmatter. For such moderate degeneracies, the thermal target region drops to weak\ncouplings beyond the reach of all proposed accelerator experiments in the\nscalar case and becomes extremely challenging in the pseudo-Dirac case.\nProposed direct detection experiments can probe moderate degeneracies in the\nscalar case. For greater degeneracies, the effect of the resonance can be even\nmore significant, and both scalar and pseudo-Dirac cases are beyond the reach\nof all proposed accelerator and direct detection experiments. For scalar dark\nmatter, we find an absolute minimum that sets the ultimate experimental\nsensitivity required to probe the entire thermal target parameter space, but\nfor pseudo-Dirac fermions, we find no such thermal target floor.\n", "  We study the spectrum of the large $N$ quantum field theory of bosonic\nrank-$3$ tensors, whose quartic interactions are such that the perturbative\nexpansion is dominated by the melonic diagrams. We use the Schwinger-Dyson\nequations to determine the scaling dimensions of the bilinear operators of\narbitrary spin. Using the fact that the theory is renormalizable in $d=4$, we\ncompare some of these results with the $4-\\epsilon$ expansion, finding perfect\nagreement. This helps elucidate why the dimension of operator\n$\\phi^{abc}\\phi^{abc}$ is complex for $d<4$: the large $N$ fixed point in\n$d=4-\\epsilon$ has complex values of the couplings for some of the $O(N)^3$\ninvariant operators. We show that a similar phenomenon holds in the $O(N)^2$\nsymmetric theory of a matrix field $\\phi^{ab}$, where the double-trace operator\nhas a complex coupling in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. We also study the spectra of\nbosonic theories of rank $q-1$ tensors with $\\phi^q$ interactions. In\ndimensions $d>1.93$ there is a critical value of $q$, above which we have not\nfound any complex scaling dimensions. The critical value is a decreasing\nfunction of $d$, and it becomes $6$ in $d\\approx 2.97$. This raises a\npossibility that the large $N$ theory of rank-$5$ tensors with sextic potential\nhas an IR fixed point which is free of perturbative instabilities for\n$2.97<d<3$. This theory may be studied using renormalized perturbation theory\nin $d=3-\\epsilon$.\n", "  We outline ideas on desired properties for a new generation of effective core\npotentials (ECPs) that will allow valence-only calculations to reach the full\npotential offered by recent advances in many-body wave function methods. The\nkey improvements include consistent use of correlated methods throughout ECP\nconstructions and improved transferability as required for an accurate\ndescription of molecular systems over a range of geometries. The guiding\nprinciple is the isospectrality of all-electron and ECP Hamiltonians for a\nsubset of valence states. We illustrate these concepts on a few first- and\nsecond-row atoms (B, C, N, O, S) and we obtain higher accuracy in\ntransferability than previous constructions while using a semi-local ECPs with\na small number of parameters. In addition, the constructed ECPs enable\nmany-body calculations of valence properties with higher (or same) accuracy\nthan their all-electron counterparts with uncorrelated cores. This implies that\nthe ECPs include also some of the impacts of core-core and core-valence\ncorrelations on valence properties. The results open further prospects for ECP\nimprovements and refinements.\n", "  We calculate the angular distribution spectra between beauty ($B$) and\nanti-beauty ($\\bar B$) mesons in proton-proton collisions in the leading order\napproximation of the parton Reggeization approach consistently merged with the\nnext-to-leading order corrections from the emission of additional hard gluon.\nTo describe b-quark hadronization we use the universal scale-depended\nparton-to-meson fragmentation functions extracted from the world $e^+e^-$\nannihilation data. We have obtained good agreement between our predictions and\ndata from the CMS Collaboration at the energy $\\sqrt{S}=7$ TeV for $B \\bar B$\nangular correlations within uncertainties and without free parameters.\nPredictions for analogous correlation observables at $\\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV are\nprovided.\n", "  Motivated by recent developments of black hole thermodynamics in de Rham,\nGabadadze and Tolley(dRGT) massive gravity, we study the critical behaviors of\nfour-dimensional topological Anti-de Sitter(AdS) black holes in the presence of\nBorn-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics by treating the cosmological constant as\npressure and the corresponding conjugate quantity is interpreted as\nthermodynamic volume. It shows that besides the Van der Waals-like SBH/LBH\nphase transitions appears, the so-called reentrant phase transitions (RPTs) are\nalso observed when the coupling coefficients $c_i m^2$ of massive potential and\nBorn-Infeld parameter $b$ satisfy some certain conditions.\n", "  The (generalized) Rainich conditions are algebraic conditions which are\npolynomial in the (mixed-component) stress-energy tensor. As such they are\nlogically distinct from the usual classical energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC,\nDEC), and logically distinct from the usual Hawking-Ellis (Segr\\'e-Pleba\\'nski)\nclassification of stress-energy tensors (type I, type II, type III, type IV).\nThere will of course be significant inter-connections between these\nclassification schemes, which we explore in the current article. Overall, we\nshall argue that it is best to view the (generalized) Rainich conditions as a\nrefinement of the classical energy conditions and the usual Hawking-Ellis\nclassification.\n", "  Here we present a full description of the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass\nfunction (IGIMF) theory in terms of the optimal sampling and compare it with\navailable observations. Optimal sampling is the method we use to discretize the\nIMF into stellar masses deterministically. Evidence has been indicating that\nnature may be closer to deterministic sampling as observations suggest a\nsmaller scatter of various relevant observables than random sampling would\ngive, which may result from a high level of self-regulation during the star\nformation process. The variation of the IGIMFs under various assumptions are\ndocumented. The results of the IGIMF theory are consistent with the empirical\nrelation between the total mass of a star cluster and the mass of its most\nmassive star, and the empirical relation between a galaxy's star formation rate\n(SFR) and the mass of its most massive cluster. Particularly, we note a natural\nagreement with the empirical relation between the IMF's power-law index and a\ngalaxy's SFR. The IGIMF also results in a relation between the galaxy's SFR and\nthe mass of its most massive star such that, if there were no binaries,\ngalaxies with SFR $<10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$/yr should host no Type II supernova\nevents. In addition, a specific list of initial stellar masses can be useful in\nnumerical simulations of stellar systems. For the first time, we show\noptimally-sampled galaxy-wide IMFs (OSGIMF) which mimics the IGIMF with an\nadditional serrated feature. Finally, A Python module, GalIMF, is provided\nallowing the calculation of the IGIMF and OSGIMF in dependence on the\ngalaxy-wide SFR and metallicity.\n", "  We study the possibility of a Dark Matter candidate having its origin in an\nextended Higgs sector which, at least partially, is related to a new strongly\ninteracting sector. More concretely, we consider an i2HDM (i.e. a Type-I Two\nHiggs Doublet Model supplemented with a Z_2 under which the non-standard scalar\ndoublet is odd) based on the gauge group SU(2)_1 x SU(2)_2 x U(1)_Y. We assume\nthat one of the scalar doublets and the standard fermion transform\nnon-trivially under SU(2)_1 while the second doublet transforms under SU(2)_2.\nOur main hypothesis is that standard sector is weakly coupled while the gauge\ninteractions associated to the second group is characterized by a large\ncoupling constant. We explore the consequences of this construction for the\nphenomenology of the Dark Matter candidate and we show that the presence of the\nnew vector resonance reduces the relic density saturation region, compared to\nthe usual i2DHM, in the high Dark Matter mass range. In the collider side, we\nargue that the mono-Z production is the channel which offers the best chances\nto manifest the presence of the new vector field. We study the departures from\nthe usual i2HDM predictions and show that the discovery of the heavy vector at\nthe LHC is challenging even in the mono-$Z$ channel since the typical cross\nsections are of the order of 10^{-2} fb.\n", "  We report on the design and performance of an on-chip microwave circulator\nwith a widely (GHz) tunable operation frequency. Non-reciprocity is created\nwith a combination of frequency conversion and delay, and requires neither\npermanent magnets nor microwave bias tones, allowing on-chip integration with\nother superconducting circuits without the need for high-bandwidth control\nlines. Isolation in the device exceeds 20 dB over a bandwidth of tens of MHz,\nand its insertion loss is small, reaching as low as 0.9 dB at select operation\nfrequencies. Furthermore, the device is linear with respect to input power for\nsignal powers up to hundreds of fW ($\\approx 10^3$ circulating photons), and\nthe direction of circulation can be dynamically reconfigured. We demonstrate\nits operation at a selection of frequencies between 4 and 6 GHz.\n", "  We analyze solar quiescent prominence bubble characteristics and instability\ndynamics using Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) data. We measure bubble\nexpansion rate, prominence downflows, and the profile of the boundary layer\nbrightness and thickness as a function of time. The largest bubble analyzed\nrises into the prominence with a speed of about 1.3 km/s until it is\ndestabilized by a localized shear flow on the boundary. Boundary layer\nthickness grows gradually as prominence downflows deposit plasma onto the\nbubble with characteristic speeds of 20 - 35 km/s. Lateral downflows initiate\nfrom the thickened boundary layer with characteristic speeds of 25 - 50 km/s,\n\"draining\" the layer of plasma. Strong shear flow across one bubble boundary\nleads to an apparent coupled Kelvin-Helmholtz Rayleigh-Taylor (KH-RT)\ninstability. We measure shear flow speeds above the bubble of 10 km/s and infer\ninterior bubble flow speeds on the order of 100 km/s. Comparing the measured\ngrowth rate of the instability to analytic expressions, we infer a magnetic\nflux density across the bubble boundary of ~10^{-3} T (10 gauss) at an angle of\n~70 degrees to the prominence plane. The results are consistent with the\nhypothesis that prominence bubbles are caused by magnetic flux that emerges\nbelow a prominence, setting up the conditions for RT, or combined KH-RT,\ninstability flows that transport flux, helicity, and hot plasma upward into the\noverlying coronal magnetic flux rope.\n", "  Quasi-one-dimensional $A_2\\text{Cr}_3\\text{As}_3$ (with $A = \\text{K, Cs,\nRb}$) is an intriguing new family of superconductors which exhibit many similar\nfeatures to the cuprate and iron-based unconventional superconductor families.\nYet in contrast to these systems, no charge or magnetic ordering has been\nobserved which could provide the electronic correlations presumed necessary for\nan unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism - an absence which defies\npredictions of first principles models. We report the results of neutron\nscattering experiments on polycrystalline $\\text{K}_2\\text{Cr}_3\\text{As}_3$\n$(T_c \\sim 7\\text{K})$ which probed the low temperature dynamics near $T_c$ .\nNeutron diffraction data evidence a strong response of the nuclear lattice to\nthe onset of superconductivity while inelastic scattering reveals a highly\ndispersive column of intensity at the commensurate wavevector $q =\n(00\\frac{1}{2})$ which loses intensity beneath $T_c$ - indicative of\nshort-range magnetic fluctuations. Using linear spin-wave theory we model the\nobserved scattering and suggest a possible structure to the short-range\nmagnetic order. These observations suggest that\n$\\text{K}_2\\text{Cr}_3\\text{As}_3$ is in close proximity to a magnetic\ninstability and that the incipient magnetic order both couples strongly to the\nlattice and competes with superconductivity - in direct analogy with the\niron-based superconductors.\n", "  Phonon spectra of CdSe nanoplatelets (2-6 ML) with the zinc-blende structure\nwere calculated from first principles within the density-functional theory. It\nturned out that the Lamb modes in nanoplatelets are in fact optical rather than\nacoustic vibrations. Phonon spectra of the nanoplatelets show the appearance of\na large number of low-frequency modes inherited from TA phonons in bulk CdSe.\nCalculations of the Raman spectra indicate a need to revise the interpretation\nof available experimental data. The largest contribution to the Raman spectra\nis provided by the quasi-Lamb modes with the $A_1$ symmetry. The $B_2$ modes\nwhose frequencies depend on the environment of nanoplatelets and whose\nproperties are closest to the properties of LO phonons explain the results\nobtained in the \"nanoparticle-on-mirror\" geometry. The features in Raman\nspectra previously attributed to surface optical (SO) modes should be\ninterpreted as a manifestation of lower-order quasi-Lamb $A_1$ modes.\nCalculations of the infrared spectra find, in addition to the TO phonon line,\nthe appearance of intense lines from surface modes originating from terminating\nF(Cl) atoms on the surface of nanoplatelets and true SO-modes.\n", "  Conventional axion dark matter search experiments employ cylindrical\nmicrowave cavities immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field. Exploring higher\nfrequency regions requires smaller size cavities as the TM010 resonant\nfrequencies scale inversely with cavity radius. One intuitive way to make\nefficient use of a given magnet volume, and thereby to increase the\nexperimental sensitivity, is to bundle multiple cavities together and combine\ntheir individual outputs ensuring phase-matching of the coherent axion signal.\nWe perform an extensive study for realistic design of a phase-matching\nmechanism for multiple-cavity systems and demonstrate its experimental\nfeasibility using a double-cavity system.\n", "  We investigate transition to synchrony in degree-frequency correlated\nSakaguchi-Kuramoto (SK) model on complex networks both analytically and\nnumerically. We analytically derive self-consistent equations for group angular\nvelocity and order parameter for the model in the thermodynamic limit. Using\nthe self-consistent equations we investigate transition to synchronization in\nSK model on uncorrelated scale-free (SF) and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER) networks in\ndetail. Depending on the degree distribution exponent ($\\gamma$) of SF networks\nand phase-frustration parameter, the population undergoes from first order\ntransition (explosive synchronization (ES)) to second order transition and vice\nversa. In ER networks transition is always second order irrespective of the\nphase-lag parameter. We observe that the critical coupling strength for the\nonset of synchronization is decreased by phase-frustration parameter in case of\nSF network where as in ER network, the phase-frustration delays the onset of\nsynchronization. Extensive numerical simulations using SF and ER networks are\nperformed to validate the analytical results. An analytical expression of\ncritical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization is also derived\nfrom the self consistent equations considering the vanishing order parameter\nlimit.\n", "  We show that there exists a critical point for the coupling constants in\nEinsteinian cubic gravity where the linearized equations on the\nmaximally-symmetric vacuum vanish identically. We construct an exact isotropic\nbounce universe in the critical theory in four dimensions. The comoving time\nruns from minus infinity to plus infinity, yielding a smooth universe bouncing\nbetween two de Sitter vacua. In five dimensions we adopt numerical approach to\nconstruct a bounce solution, where a singularity occurred before the bounce\ntakes place. We then construct exact anisotropic bounces that connect two\nisotropic de Sitter spacetimes with flat spatial sections. We further construct\nexact AdS black holes in the critical theory in four and five dimensions and\nobtain an exact AdS wormbrane in four dimensions.\n", "  Approximate methods to full N-body simulations provide a fast and accurate\nsolution to the development of mock catalogues for the modeling of galaxy\nclustering observables. In this paper we extend ICE-COLA (Izard et al. 2016),\nbased on an optimized implementation of the approximate COLA method, to produce\nweak lensing maps and halo catalogues in the light cone using an integrated and\nself consistent approach. We show that despite the approximate dynamics, the\ncatalogues thus produced enable an accurate modeling of weak lensing\nobservables one decade beyond the characteristic scale where the growth becomes\nnon-linear. In particular, we compare ICE-COLA to the MICE-GC N-body simulation\nfor some fiducial cases representative of upcoming surveys and find that, for\nsources at redshift $z=1$, their convergence power spectra agree to within one\npercent up to high multipoles (i.e., of order $1000$). The corresponding shear\ntwo point functions, $\\xi_{+}$ and $\\xi_{-}$, yield similar accuracy down to\n$2$ and $20$ arcmin respectively, while tangential shear around a $z=0.5$ lens\nsample is accurate down to $4$ arcmin. We show that such accuracy is stable\nagainst an increased angular resolution of the weak lensing maps. Hence, this\nopens the possibility of using approximate methods for the joint modeling of\ngalaxy clustering and weak lensing observables and their covariance in ongoing\nand future galaxy surveys.\n", "  A human pathogen, \\textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae} (NG), moves on surfaces by\nattaching and retracting polymeric structures called Type IV pili. The\n\\textit{tug-of-war} between the pili results in a two-dimensional stochastic\nmotion called \\textit{twitching motility}. In this paper, with the help of real\ntime NG trajectories, we develop coarse-grained models for their description.\nThe \\textit{fractal properties} of these trajectories are determined and their\ninfluence on \\textit{first passage time} and formation of bacterial\nmicrocolonies is studied. Our main observations are as follows: (i) NG performs\na fast ballistic walk on small time scales and a slow diffusive walk over long\ntime scales with a long crossover region; (ii) There exists a characteristic\npersistent length $l_p^*$ which yields the fastest growth of bacterial\naggregates or biofilms. Our simulations reveal that $l_{p}^{*} \\sim L^{0.6}$,\nwhere $L\\times L$ is the surface on which the bacteria move; (iii) The\nmorphologies have distinct fractal characteristics as a consequence of the\nballistic and diffusive motion of the constituting bacteria.\n", "  A new path for the generation of a sub-ion scale cascade in collisionless\nplasma turbulence, triggered by magnetic reconnection, is uncovered by means of\nhigh-resolution two-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations employing two\ncomplementary approaches, Lagrangian and Eulerian, and different driving\nmechanisms. The simulation results provide clear numerical evidences that the\ndevelopment of power-law energy spectra below the so-called ion break occurs as\nsoon as the first magnetic reconnection events take place, regardless of the\nactual state of the turbulent cascade at MHD scales. In both simulations, the\nreconnection-mediated small-scale energy spectrum of parallel magnetic\nfluctuations exhibits a very stable spectral slope of ~-2.8, whether or not a\nlarge-scale turbulent cascade has already fully developed. Once a\nquasi-stationary turbulent state is achieved, the spectrum of the total\nmagnetic fluctuations settles towards a spectral index of -5/3 in the MHD range\nand of ~-3 at sub-ion scales.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of detecting in redshift surveys a\nhemispherical power asymmetry similar to that first reported in CMB\nobservations. We assume the hemispherical asymmetry arises from a linear\ngradient in comoving coordinates in the perturbation amplitude. We predict the\nresulting clustering of galaxy or galaxy cluster tracers using an excursion set\napproach; doing so accounts for the variation of both the underlying clustering\nand the tracer bias. Based on the predicted variation of the clustering of\ntracers, we perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the galaxy clustering amplitude\nand calculate the statistical significance for ideal surveys and planned\nsurveys. The results indicate that the DESI galaxy survey would be able to\ndetect this signal with higher than $3\\sigma$ significance if the asymmetry\ndoes exist. We also investigate the amplitude and scale dependence of the above\nresult. The DESI galaxy survey can probe the dipole amplitude higher than 0.04,\nwhich correspond to a $\\pm4\\%$ difference of the temperature fluctuation along\nand opposite the dipole direction, at least at the $2\\sigma$ level.\nAdditionally, we investigate a modulation of the power spectrum that exhibits\nasymmetry only for large scales. This modulation is potentially detectable. For\nMilky Way galaxy mass tracers, the scale-dependent modulation yields a larger\nchange in the large scale power spectrum than does a scale-independent\nmodulation, because the former does not alter the bias.\n", "  We compute the weak lensing convergence power spectrum,\n$C^{\\kappa\\kappa}(\\theta)$, in a dust-filled universe using fully non-linear\ngeneral relativistic simulations. The spectrum is then compared to more\nstandard, approximate calculations by computing the Bardeen (Newtonian)\npotentials in linearized gravity and utilizing the Born approximation. We find\ncorrections to the angular power spectrum amplitude of order ten percent at\nvery large angular scales, $\\ell ~ 2-3$, and percent-level corrections at\nintermediate angular scales of $\\ell ~ 20-30$.\n", "  We study the influence of particle size asymmetry on structural evolution of\nrandomly jammed binary sphere mixtures with varying large-sphere/small-sphere\ncomposition. Simulations of jammed packings are used to assess the transition\nfrom large-sphere dominant to small-sphere dominant mixtures. For weakly\nasymmetric particle sizes, packing properties evolve smoothly, but not\nmonotonically, with increasing small sphere composition, $f$. Our simulations\nreveal that at high values of ratio $\\alpha$ of large to small sphere radii,\n($\\alpha\\geq \\alpha_c \\approx 5.75$) evolution of structural properties such as\npacking density, fraction of jammed spheres and contact statistics with $f$\nexhibit features that suggest a sharp transition, either through\ndiscontinuities in structural measures or their derivatives. We argue that this\nbehavior is related to the singular, composition dependence of close-packing\nfraction predicted in infinite aspect ratio mixtures $\\alpha\\rightarrow\\infty$\nby the Furnas model, but occurring for finite values range of $\\alpha$ above a\ncritical value, $\\alpha_c \\approx 5.75$. The existence of a sharp transition\nfrom small- to large-$f$ values for $\\alpha\\geq \\alpha_c$ can be attributed to\nthe existence of a {\\it sub-jamming transition} of small spheres in the\ninterstices of jammed large spheres along the line of compositions\n$f_{sub}(\\alpha)$. We argue that the critical value of finite size asymmetry\n$\\alpha_c \\simeq 5.75$ is consistent with the geometric criterion for the\ntransmission of small sphere contacts between neighboring tetrahedrally close\npacked interstices of large spheres, facilitating a cooperative sub-jamming\ntransition of small spheres confined within the disjoint volumes.\n", "  The quantum Hall effect is studied in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe$_2$.\nBy employing top- and back-gate electric fields at high magnetic field, the\nLandau levels of the Dirac cones in the top and bottom topological surface\nstates can be tuned independently. When one surface is tuned to the\nelectron-doped side of the Dirac cone and the other surface to the hole-doped\nside, the quantum Hall edge channels are counter-propagating. The opposite edge\nmode direction, combined with the opposite helicities of top and bottom\nsurfaces, allows for scattering between these counter-propagating edge modes.\nThe total Hall conductance is integer valued only when the scattering is\nstrong. For weaker interaction, a non-integer quantum Hall effect is expected\nand measured.\n", "  Modern softened nucleon-nucleon interactions are well-suited for perturbative\nmany-body calculations, but a many-body power counting scheme is lacking.\nEstimates of diagrammatic contributions at finite density are important\ningredients in such a scheme. Here we show how to make quantitative estimates\nof the particle-particle and hole-hole channel in uniform nuclear matter for\nsoft interactions. We also use estimates to assess the role of normal-ordered\nthree-body forces for a pure contact interaction.\n", "  The optical conductivity of a metal near a quantum critical point (QCP) is\nexpected to depend on frequency not only via the scattering time but also via\nthe effective mass, which acquires a singular frequency dependence near a QCP.\nWe check this assertion by computing diagrammatically the optical conductivity,\n$\\sigma' (\\Omega)$, near both nematic and spin-density wave (SDW) quantum\ncritical points (QCPs) in 2D. If renormalization of current vertices is not\ntaken into account, $\\sigma' (\\Omega)$ is expressed via the quasiparticle\nresidue $Z$ (equal to the ratio of bare and renormalized masses in our\napproximation) and transport scattering rate $\\gamma_{\\text{tr}}$ as $\\sigma'\n(\\Omega)\\propto Z^2 \\gamma_{\\text{tr}}/\\Omega^2$. For a nematic QCP\n($\\gamma_{\\text{tr}}\\propto\\Omega^{4/3}$ and $Z\\propto\\Omega^{1/3}$), this\nformula suggests that $\\sigma'(\\Omega)$ would tend to a constant at $\\Omega \\to\n0$. We explicitly demonstrate that the actual behavior of $\\sigma' (\\Omega)$ is\ndifferent due to strong renormalization of the current vertices, which cancels\nout a factor of $Z^2$. As a result, $\\sigma' (\\Omega)$ diverges as\n$1/\\Omega^{2/3}$, as earlier works conjectured. In the SDW case, we consider\ntwo contributions to the conductivity: from hot spots and from\"lukewarm\"\nregions of the Fermi surface. The hot-spot contribution is not affected by\nvertex renormalization, but it is subleading to the lukewarm one. For the\nlatter, we argue that a factor of $Z^2$ is again cancelled by vertex\ncorrections. As a result, $\\sigma' (\\Omega)$ at a SDW QCP scales as $1/\\Omega$\ndown to the lowest frequencies.\n", "  Context. The so-called Barbarian asteroids share peculiar, but common\npolarimetric properties, probably related to both their shape and composition.\nThey are named after (234) Barbara, the first on which such properties were\nidentified. As has been suggested, large scale topographic features could play\na role in the polarimetric response, if the shapes of Barbarians are\nparticularly irregular and present a variety of scattering/incidence angles.\nThis idea is supported by the shape of (234) Barbara, that appears to be deeply\nexcavated by wide concave areas revealed by photometry and stellar\noccultations. Aims. With these motivations, we started an observation campaign\nto characterise the shape and rotation properties of Small Main- Belt Asteroid\nSpectroscopic Survey (SMASS) type L and Ld asteroids. As many of them show long\nrotation periods, we activated a worldwide network of observers to obtain a\ndense temporal coverage. Methods. We used light-curve inversion technique in\norder to determine the sidereal rotation periods of 15 asteroids and the con-\nvergence to a stable shape and pole coordinates for 8 of them. By using\navailable data from occultations, we are able to scale some shapes to an\nabsolute size. We also study the rotation periods of our sample looking for\nconfirmation of the suspected abundance of asteroids with long rotation\nperiods. Results. Our results show that the shape models of our sample do not\nseem to have peculiar properties with respect to asteroids with similar size,\nwhile an excess of slow rotators is most probably confirmed.\n", "  We study the faint radio population using wide-field very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) observations of 2865 known radio sources in the Cosmic\nEvolution Survey (COSMOS) field. The main objective of the project was to\ndetermine where active galactic nuclei (AGN) are present. The combination of\nnumber of sources, sensitivity, angular resolution and area covered by this\nproject are unprecedented. We have detected 468 radio sources, expected to be\nAGNs, with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.4 GHz. This is, to date,\nthe largest sample assembled of VLBI detected sources in the sub-mJy regime.\nThe input sample was taken from previous observations with the Very Large Array\n(VLA). We present the catalogue with additional multiwavelength information. We\nfind a detection fraction of 20%, considering only those sources from the input\ncatalogue which were in principle detectable with the VLBA (2361). As a\nfunction of redshift, we see no evolution of the detection fraction over the\nredshift range 0.5<z<3. In addition, we find that faint radio sources typically\nhave a greater fraction of their radio luminosity in a compact core: ~70% of\nthe sub-mJy sources detected with the VLBA have more than half of their total\nradio luminosity in a VLBI-scale component, whereas this is true for only ~30%\nof the sources that are brighter than 10 mJy. This suggests that fainter radio\nsources differ intrinsically from brighter ones. Across our entire sample, we\nfind the predominant morphological classification of the host galaxies of the\nVLBA detected sources to be early type (57%), although this varies with\nredshift and at z>1.5 we find that spiral galaxies become the most prevalent\n(48%). We demonstrate that wide-field VLBI observations, together with new\ncalibration methods such as multi-source self-calibration and mosaicing, result\nin information which is difficult or impossible to obtain otherwise.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm to compute the entanglement spectrum of\narbitrary quantum states. The interesting universal part of the entanglement\nspectrum is typically contained in the largest eigenvalues of the density\nmatrix which can be obtained from the lower Renyi entropies through the\nNewton-Girard method. Obtaining the $p$ largest eigenvalues\n($\\lambda_1>\\lambda_2\\ldots>\\lambda_p$) requires a parallel circuit depth of\n$\\mathcal{O}(p(\\lambda_1/\\lambda_p)^p)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(p\\log(N))$ qubits\nwhere up to $p$ copies of the quantum state defined on a Hilbert space of size\n$N$ are needed as the input. We validate this procedure for the entanglement\nspectrum of the topologically-ordered Laughlin wave function corresponding to\nthe quantum Hall state at filling factor $\\nu=1/3$. Our scaling analysis\nexposes the tradeoffs between time and number of qubits for obtaining the\nentanglement spectrum in the thermodynamic limit using finite-size digital\nquantum computers. We also illustrate the utility of the second Renyi entropy\nin predicting a topological phase transition and in extracting the localization\nlength in a many-body localized system.\n", "  We propose a method for calculating the nucleon form factors (FFs) of\n$G$-parity-even operators by combining Chiral Effective Field Theory\n($\\chi$EFT) and dispersion analysis. The FFs are expressed as dispersive\nintegrals over the two-pion cut at $t > 4 M_\\pi^2$. The spectral functions are\nobtained from the elastic unitarity condition and expressed as products of the\ncomplex $\\pi\\pi \\rightarrow N\\bar N$ partial-wave amplitudes and the timelike\npion FF. $\\chi$EFT is used to calculate the ratio of the partial-wave\namplitudes and the pion FF, which is real and free of $\\pi\\pi$ rescattering in\nthe $t$-channel ($N/D$ method). The rescattering effects are then incorporated\nby multiplying with the squared modulus of the empirical pion FF. The procedure\nresults in a marked improvement compared to conventional $\\chi$EFT calculations\nof the spectral functions. We apply the method to the nucleon scalar FF and\ncompute the scalar spectral function, the scalar radius, the $t$-dependent FF,\nand the Cheng-Dashen discrepancy. Higher-order chiral corrections are estimated\nthrough the $\\pi N$ low-energy constants. Results are in excellent agreement\nwith dispersion-theoretical calculations. We elaborate several other\ninteresting aspects of our method. The results show proper scaling behavior in\nthe large-$N_c$ limit of QCD because the $\\chi$EFT calculation includes $N$ and\n$\\Delta$ intermediate states. The squared modulus of the timelike pion FF\nrequired by our method can be extracted from Lattice QCD calculations of vacuum\ncorrelation functions of the operator at large Euclidean distances. Our method\ncan be applied to the nucleon FFs of other operators of interest, such as the\nisovector-vector current, the energy-momentum tensor, and twist-2 QCD operators\n(moments of generalized parton distributions).\n", "  We present the first catalog and data release of the Swift-BAT AGN\nSpectroscopic Survey (BASS). We analyze optical spectra of the majority of AGN\n(77%, 641/836) detected based on their 14-195 keV emission in the 70-month\nSwift BAT all-sky catalog. This includes redshift determination, absorption and\nemission line measurements, and black hole mass and accretion rate estimates\nfor the majority of obscured and un-obscured AGN (74%, 473/641) with 340\nmeasured for the first time. With ~90% of sources at z<0.2, the survey\nrepresents a significant census of hard-X-ray selected AGN in the local\nuniverse. In this first catalog paper, we describe the spectroscopic\nobservations and datasets, and our initial spectral analysis. The FWHM of the\nemission lines show broad agreement with the X-ray obscuration (~94%), such\nthat Sy 1-1.8 have NH<10^21.9 cm^-2, and Seyfert 2, have NH>10^21.9 cm^-2.\nSeyfert 1.9 show a range of column densities. Compared to narrow line AGN in\nthe SDSS, the X-ray selected AGN have a larger fraction of dusty host galaxies\nsuggesting these types of AGN are missed in optical surveys. Using the most\nsensitive [OIII]/Hbeta and [NII]/Halpha emission line diagnostic, about half of\nthe sources are classified as Seyferts, ~15% reside in dusty galaxies that lack\nan Hbeta detection, but for which the line upper limits imply either a Seyfert\nor LINER, ~15% are in galaxies with weak or no emission lines despite high\nquality spectra, and a few percent each are LINERS, composite galaxies, HII\nregions, or in known beamed AGN.\n", "  Simulating high-weight Hamiltonians can convert local noise on the original\nHamiltonian into undesirable nonlocal noise on the simulated Hamiltonian. Here\nwe show how starting from two-local Hamiltonian in the presence of\nnon-Markovian noise, a desired computation can be simulated as well as\nprotected using fast pulses, while maintaining an energy gap against the errors\ncreated in the process.\n", "  We explore the potential of future cryogenic direct detection experiments to\ndetermine the properties of the mediator that communicates the interactions\nbetween dark matter and nuclei. Due to their low thresholds and large\nexposures, experiments like CRESST-III, SuperCDMS SNOLAB and EDELWEISS-III will\nhave excellent capability to reconstruct mediator masses in the MeV range for a\nlarge class of models. Combining the information from several experiments\nfurther improves the parameter reconstruction, even when taking into account\nadditional nuisance parameters related to background uncertainties and the dark\nmatter velocity distribution. These observations may offer the intriguing\npossibility of studying dark matter self-interactions with direct detection\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper we present a novel method to identify and characterize stellar\nclusters deeply embedded in a dark molecular cloud. The method is based on\nmeasuring stellar surface density in wide-field infrared images using star\ncounting techniques. It takes advantage of the differing $H$-band luminosity\nfunctions (HLFs) of field stars and young stellar populations and is able to\nstatistically associate each star in an image as a member of either the\nbackground stellar population or a young stellar population projected on or\nnear the cloud. Moreover, the technique corrects for the effects of\ndifferential extinction toward each individual star. We have tested this method\nagainst simulations as well as observations. In particular, we have applied the\nmethod to 2MASS point sources observed in the Orion A and B complexes, and the\nresults obtained compare very well with those obtained from deep Spitzer and\nChandra observations where presence of infrared excess or X-ray emission\ndirectly determines membership status for every star. Additionally, our method\nalso identifies unobscured clusters and a low resolution version of the Orion\nstellar surface density map shows clearly the relatively unobscured and diffuse\nOB 1a and 1b sub-groups and provides useful insights on their spatial\ndistribution.\n", "  We derive general conditions for the compatibility of channels in general\nprobabilistic theory. We introduce formalism that allows us to easily formulate\nsteering by channels and Bell nonlocality of channels as generalizations of the\nwell-known concepts of steering by measurements and Bell nonlocality of\nmeasurements. The generalization does not follow the standard line of thinking\nstemming from the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, but introduces steering and\nBell nonlocality as entanglement-assisted incompatibility tests. We show that\nall of the proposed definitions are, in the special case of measurements, the\nsame as the standard definitions, but not all of the known results for\nmeasurements generalize to channels. For example, we show that for quantum\nchannels, steering is not a necessary condition for Bell nonlocality. We\nfurther investigate the introduced conditions and concepts in the special case\nof quantum theory and we provide many examples to demonstrate these concepts\nand their implications.\n", "  The question of the competition between $\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi^{0,-}$ in the\nground-state of multi-strange hypernuclei is addressed within a\nnon-relativistic density functional approach, partially constrained by\nab-initio calculations and experimental data. The exploration of the nuclear\nchart for $10<Z<120$ as a function of the strangeness number is performed by\nadding hyperons to a nuclear core imposing either conserved total charge $Q$ or\nconserved proton number $Z$. We find that almost all $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei\npresent an instability with respect to the strong interaction decay of\n$\\Lambda$ towards $\\Xi^{0,-}$ and that most of the instabilities generates\n$\\Xi^-$ (resp. $\\Xi^0$) in the case of conserved total charge $Q$ (resp. proton\nnumber $Z$). The strangeness number at which the first $\\Xi^{0,-}$ appear is\ngenerally lower for configurations explored in the case of conserved $Q$\ncompared to the case of conserved $Z$, and corresponds to the crossing between\nthe $\\Lambda$ and the neutron or proton chemical potentials. About two to three\nhundred thousands pure $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei may exist before the onset of\n$\\Xi^{0,-}$. The largest uncertainty comes from the unknown $\\Lambda\\Xi$\ninteraction, since the $N\\Lambda$ and the $N\\Xi$ ones can be constrained by a\nfew experimental data. The uncertainty on the $\\Lambda\\Xi$ interaction can\nstill modify the previous estimation by 30-40\\%, while the impact of the\nunknown $\\Xi\\Xi$ interaction is very weak.\n", "  PS16dtm was classified as a candidate tidal disruption event (TDE) in a dwarf\nSeyfert 1 galaxy with low-mass black hole ($\\sim10^6M\\odot$) and has presented\nvarious intriguing photometric and spectra characteristics. Using the archival\nWISE and the newly released NEOWISE data, we found PS16dtm is experiencing a\nmid-infrared (MIR) flare which started $\\sim11$ days before the first optical\ndetection. Interpreting the MIR flare as a dust echo requires close\npre-existing dust with a high covering factor, and suggests the optical flare\nmay have brightened slowly for some time before it became bright detectable\nfrom the ground. More evidence is given at the later epochs. At the peak of the\noptical light curve, the new inner radius of the dust torus has grown to much\nlarger size, a factor of 7 of the initial radius due to strong radiation field.\nAt $\\sim150$ days after the first optical detection, the dust temperature has\ndropped well below the sublimation temperature. Other peculiar spectral\nfeatures shown by PS16dtm are the transient, prominent FeII emission lines and\noutflows indicated by broad absorption lines detected during the optical flare.\nOur model explains the enhanced FeII emission from iron newly released from the\nevaporated dust. The observed broad absorption line outflow could be explained\nby accelerated gas in the dust torus due to the radiation pressure.\n", "  The decay rate of the electroweak (EW) vacuum is calculated in the framework\nof the standard model (SM) of particle physics, using the recent progresses in\nthe understanding of the decay rate of metastable vacuum in gauge theories. We\ngive a manifestly gauge-invariant expression of the decay rate. We also perform\na detailed numerical calculation of the decay rate. With the best-fit values of\nthe SM parameters, we find that the decay rate of the EW vacuum per unit volume\nis about $10^{-554}\\ {\\rm Gyr^{-1}Gpc^{-3}}$; with the uncertainty in the top\nmass, the decay rate is estimated as $10^{-284}-10^{-1371}\\ {\\rm\nGyr^{-1}Gpc^{-3}}$.\n", "  This article completes and extends a recent study of the Grad-Shafranov (GS)\nreconstruction in toroidal geometry, as applied to a two and a half dimensional\nconfigurations in space plasmas with rotational symmetry. A further application\nto the benchmark study of an analytic solution to the toroidal GS equation with\nadded noise shows deviations in the reconstructed geometry of the flux rope\nconfiguration, characterized by the orientation of the rotation axis, the major\nradius, and the impact parameter. On the other hand, the physical properties of\nthe flux rope, including the axial field strength, and the toroidal and\npoloidal magnetic flux, agree between the numerical and exact GS solutions. We\nalso present a real event study of a magnetic cloud flux rope from \\textit{in\nsitu} spacecraft measurements. The devised procedures for toroidal GS\nreconstruction are successfully executed. Various geometrical and physical\nparameters are obtained with associated uncertainty estimates. The overall\nconfiguration of the flux rope from the GS reconstruction is compared with the\ncorresponding morphological reconstruction based on white-light images. The\nresults show overall consistency, but also discrepancy in that the inclination\nangle of the flux rope central axis with respect to the ecliptic plane differs\nby about 20-30 degrees in the plane of the sky. We also compare the results\nwith the original straight-cylinder GS reconstruction and discuss our findings.\n", "  For very heavy quarks $Q$, relations derived from heavy-quark symmetry\npredict the existence of novel narrow doubly heavy tetraquark states of the\nform $Q_iQ_j \\bar q_k \\bar q_l$ (subscripts label flavors), where $q$\ndesignates a light quark. By evaluating finite-mass corrections, we predict\nthat double-beauty states composed of $bb\\bar u \\bar d$, $bb\\bar u \\bar s$, and\n$bb\\bar d \\bar s$ will be stable against strong decays, whereas the\ndouble-charm states $cc \\bar q_k \\bar q_l$, mixed beauty+charm states $bc \\bar\nq_k \\bar q_l$, and heavier $bb \\bar q_k \\bar q_l$ states will dissociate into\npairs of heavy-light mesons. Observation of a new double-beauty state through\nits weak decays would establish the existence of tetraquarks and illuminate the\nrole of heavy color-antitriplet diquarks as hadron constituents.\n", "  The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is a concrete model for non-Fermi Liquid\nwith maximally chaotic behavior in $0+1$-$d$. In order to gain some insights\ninto real materials in higher dimensions where fermions could hop between\ndifferent sites, here we consider coupling a SYK lattice by a constant hopping.\nWe call this dispersive SYK model. Focusing on $1+1$-$d$ homogeneous hopping,\nby either tuning temperature or the relative strength of random interaction\n(hopping) and constant hopping, we find a crossover between a dispersive metal\nto an incoherent metal, where dynamic exponent $z$ changes from $1$ to\n$\\infty$. We study the crossover by calculating spectral function, charge\ndensity correlator and the Lyapunov exponent. We further find the Lyapunov\nexponent becomes larger when the chemical potential is tuned to approach a Van\nHove singularity because of the large density of states near the Fermi suface.\nThe effect of the topological non-trivial bands is also discussed.\n", "  We compute from first principles the effective interaction parameters\nappropriate for a low-energy description of the rare-earth nickelate\nLuNiO$_{3}$ involving the partially occupied $e_g$ states only. The calculation\nuses the constrained random-phase approximation and reveals that the effective\non-site Coulomb repulsion is strongly reduced by screening effects involving\nthe oxygen-$p$ and nickel-$t_{2g}$ states. The long-range component of the\neffective low-energy interaction is also found to be sizeable. As a result, the\neffective on-site interaction between parallel-spin electrons is reduced down\nto a small negative value. This validates effective low-energy theories of\nthese materials proposed earlier. Electronic structure methods combined with\ndynamical mean-field theory are used to construct and solve an appropriate\nlow-energy model and explore its phase diagram as a function of the on-site\nrepulsion and Hund's coupling. For the calculated values of these effective\ninteractions we find, in agreement with experiments, that LuNiO$_{3}$ is a\nmetal without disproportionation of the $e_g$ occupancy when considered in its\northorhombic structure, while the monoclinic phase is a disproportionated\ninsulator.\n", "  We consider a real, massive scalar field in BTZ spacetime, a 2+1-dimensional\nblack hole solution of the Einstein's field equations with a negative\ncosmological constant. First, we analyze the space of classical solutions in a\nmode decomposition and we characterize the collection of all admissible\nboundary conditions of Robin type which can be imposed at infinity. Secondly,\nwe investigate whether, for a given boundary condition, there exists a ground\nstate by constructing explicitly its two-point function. We demonstrate that\nfor a subclass of the boundary conditions it is possible to construct a ground\nstate that locally satisfies the Hadamard property. In all other cases, we show\nthat bound state mode solutions exist and, therefore, such construction is not\npossible.\n", "  In a two component advective flow around a compact object, a high viscosity\nKeplerian disk is flanked by a low angular momentum and low viscosity flow\nwhich forms a centrifugal pressure supported shock wave close to the black\nhole. The post-shock region which behaves as a Compton cloud becomes\nprogressively smaller during the outburst as the spectra change from the hard\nstate to the soft state in order to satisfy Rankine-Hugoniot relation in\npresence of cooling. The resonance oscillation of the shock wave which causes\nlow frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) also allows us to obtain the\nshock location from each observed QPO frequency. Applying the theory of\ntransonic flow with Compton cooling and viscosity, we obtain the viscosity\nparameter $\\alpha_{SK}$ required for the shock to form at those places in the\nlow-Keplerian component. When we compare the evolution of $\\alpha_{SK}$ for\neach outburst, we arrive at a major conclusion: In each source, the advective\nflow component typically requires exactly a similar value of $\\alpha_{SK}$ when\ntransiting from one spectral state to another (e.g., from hard state to soft\nstate through intermediate states and the other way around in the declining\nphase). Most importantly, these $\\alpha_{SK}$ values in the low-angular\nmomentum advective component are fully self-consistent in the sense that they\nremain below critical value $\\alpha_{cr}$ required to form a Keplerian disk.\nFor a further consistency check, we compute the $\\alpha_K$ of the Keplerian\ncomponent, and find that in each of the objects, $\\alpha_{SK}$ $<$\n$\\alpha_{cr}$ $<$ $\\alpha_K$.\n", "  One-dimensional Bose gases are a useful testing-ground for quantum dynamics\nin many-body theory. They allow experimental tests of many-body theory\npredictions in an exponentially complex quantum system. Here we calculate the\ndynamics of a higher-order soliton in the mesoscopic case of $N=10^3-10^4$\nparticles, giving predictions for quantum soliton breather relaxation. These\nquantum predictions use a truncated Wigner approximation, which is a $1/N$\nexpansion, in a regime where other exactly known predictions are recovered to\nhigh accuracy. Such dynamical calculations are testable in forthcoming BEC\nexperiments.\n", "  Fragmentation is the dominant mechanism for hadron production with high\ntransverse momentum. For spin-triplet S-wave heavy quarkonium production,\ncontribution of gluon fragmenting to color-singlet channel has been numerically\ncalculated since 1993. However, there is still no analytic expression available\nup to now because of its complexity. In this paper, we calculate both\npolarization-summed and polarized fragmentation functions of gluon fragmenting\nto a heavy quark-antiquark pair with quantum number $^3S_1^{[1]}$. Our\ncalculations are performed in two different frameworks. One is the widely used\nnonrelativistic QCD factorization, and the other is the newly proposed soft\ngluon factorization. In either case, we calculate at both leading order and\nnext-to-leading order in velocity expansion. All of our final results are\npresented in terms of compact analytic expressions.\n", "  We investigate the feasibility of constraining parton distribution functions\nin the proton through a comparison with data on semi-inclusive deep-inelastic\nlepton-nucleon scattering. Specifically, we reweight replicas of these\ndistributions according to how well they reproduce recent, very precise charged\nkaon multiplicity measurements and analyze how this procedure optimizes the\ndetermination of the sea quark densities and improves their uncertainties. The\nresults can help to shed new light on the long standing question on the size of\nthe flavor and charge symmetry breaking among quarks of radiative origin. An\niterative method is proposed and adopted to account for the inevitable\ncorrelation with what is assumed about the parton-to-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions in the reweighting procedure. It is shown how the fragmentation\nfunctions can be optimized simultaneously in each step of the iteration. As a\nfirst case study, we implement this method to analyze kaon production data.\n", "  The current-carrying capacity of type-II superconductors is decisively\ndetermined by how well material defect structures can immobilize vortex lines.\nIn order to gain deeper insights into the fundamental pinning mechanisms, we\nhave explored the case of vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical\ninclusions using large-scale simulations of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\nequations. We find that for a small density of particles having diameters of\ntwo coherence lengths, the vortex lattice preserves its structure and the\ncritical current $j_c$ decays with the magnetic field following a power-law\n$B^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\approx 0.66$, which is consistent with predictions\nof strong-pinning theory. For a higher density of particles and/or larger\ninclusions, the lattice becomes progressively more disordered and the exponent\nsmoothly decreases down to $\\alpha \\approx 0.3$. At high magnetic fields, all\ninclusions capture a vortex and the critical current decays faster than\n$B^{-1}$ as would be expected by theory. In the case of larger inclusions with\na diameter of four coherence length, the magnetic-field dependence of the\ncritical current is strongly affected by the ability of inclusions to capture\nmultiple vortex lines. We found that at small densities, the fraction of\ninclusions trapping two vortex lines rapidly grows within narrow field range\nleading to a peak in $j_c(B)$-dependence within this range. With increasing\ninclusion density, this peak transforms into a plateau, which then smooths out.\nUsing the insights gained from simulations, we determine the limits of\napplicability of strong-pinning theory and provide different routes to describe\nvortex pinning beyond those bounds.\n", "  For over 10 years, we have carried out a precise radial velocity (RV) survey\nto find substellar companions around evolved G,K-type stars to extend our\nknowledge of planet formation and evolution. We performed high precision RV\nmeasurements for the giant star HD 208897 using an iodine (I2) absorption cell.\nThe measurements were made at T\\\"UB\\.ITAK National Observatory (TUG, RTT150)\nand Okayama Astrophysical Observatory (OAO). For the origin of the periodic\nvariation seen in the RV data of the star, we adopted a Keplerian motion caused\nby an unseen companion. We found that the star hosts a planet with a minimum\nmass of m2sini=1.40MJ, which is relatively low compared to those of known\nplanets orbiting evolved intermediate-mass stars. The planet is in a nearly\ncircular orbit with a period of P=353 days at about 1 AU distance from the host\nstar. The star is metal rich and located at the early phase of ascent along the\nred giant branch. The photometric observations of the star at Ankara University\nKreiken Observatory (AUKR) and the HIPPARCOS photometry show no sign of\nvariation with periods associated with the RV variation. Neither bisector\nvelocity analysis nor analysis of the Ca II and Halpha lines shows any\ncorrelation with the RV measurements.\n", "  The longitudinal spin Seebeck effect refers to the generation of a spin\ncurrent when heat flows across a normal metal/magnetic insulator interface.\nUntil recently, most explanations of the spin Seebeck effect use the\ninterfacial temperature difference as the conversion mechanism between heat and\nspin fluxes. However, recent theoretical and experimental works claim that a\nmagnon spin current is generated in the bulk of a magnetic insulator even in\nthe absence of an interface. This is the so-called intrinsic spin Seebeck\neffect. Here, by utilizing a non-local spin Seebeck geometry, we provide\nadditional evidence that the total magnon spin current in the ferrimagnetic\ninsulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) actually contains two distinct terms: one\nproportional to the gradient in the magnon chemical potential (pure magnon spin\ndiffusion), and a second proportional to the gradient in magnon temperature\n($\\nabla T_m$). We observe two characteristic decay lengths for magnon spin\ncurrents in YIG with distinct temperature dependences: a temperature\nindependent decay length of ~ 10 ${\\mu}$m consistent with earlier measurements\nof pure ($\\nabla T_m = 0$) magnon spin diffusion, and a longer decay length\nranging from about 20 ${\\mu}$m around 250 K and exceeding 80 ${\\mu}$m at 10 K.\nThe coupled spin-heat transport processes are modeled using a finite element\nmethod revealing that the longer range magnon spin current is attributable to\nthe intrinsic spin Seebeck effect ($\\nabla T_m \\neq 0$), whose length scale\nincreases at lower temperatures in agreement with our experimental data.\n", "  ASASSN-13db is a M5-type star with a protoplanetary disk, the lowest mass\nstar known to experience accretion outbursts. Since its discovery in 2013, it\nhas experienced two outbursts, the second of which started in November 2014 and\nlasted until February 2017. We use high- and low-resolution spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved photometry from the ASAS-SN survey, the LCOGT and the Beacon\nObservatory to study the lightcurve and the dynamical and physical properties\nof the accretion flow. The 2014-2017 outburst lasted for nearly 800 days. A\n4.15d period in the lightcurve likely corresponds to rotational modulation of a\nstar with hot spot(s). The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable\ninverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the\ncontinuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)\nsuggest temperatures of $\\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.\nPhotometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an\nintermediate behavior between EXors and FUors. The accretion rate\n(\\.{M}=1-3$\\times$10$^{-7}$M$_\\odot$/yr), about 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the accretion rate in quiescence, is not significantly different from the\naccretion rate observed in 2013. The absorption features in the spectra suggest\nthat the system is viewed at a high angle and drives a powerful,\nnon-axisymmetric wind, maybe related to magnetic reconnection. The properties\nof ASASSN-13db suggest that temperatures lower than those for solar-type stars\nare needed for modeling accretion in very low-mass systems. Finally, the\nrotational modulation during the outburst reveals that accretion-related\nstructures settled after the begining of the outburst and can be relatively\nstable and long-lived. Our work also demonstrates the power of time-resolved\nphotometry and spectroscopy to explore the properties of variable and\noutbursting stars. (Abridged).\n", "  Determining the properties of the warm ionized medium (WIM) at the leading\nedge of spiral arms is important for understanding its dynamics and cloud\nformation. The inner edge of the Scutum arm tangency is a unique location in\nwhich to disentangle the WIM from other components. We use high spectral\nresolution [C II] 158 micron and [N II] 205 micron fine structure line\nobservations taken with the upGREAT and GREAT instruments on SOFIA, along with\nauxiliary HI and 13CO observations. The observations were in and out of the\nGalactic plane along 18 lines of sight between longitude 30deg and 32deg. We\ndetect strong [N II] emission throughout the Scutum tangency. At VLSR = 110 to\n125 km/s, where there is little, if any, 13CO, we could disentangle the [N II]\nand [C II] emission that arises from the WIM at the inner edge. We find an\naverage electron density, <n(e)> about 0.9 cm{-3} in the plane, and about 0.4\ncm{-3} above the plane. For VLSR < 110 km/s there is [N II] emission tracing\nhighly ionized gas throughout the arm's molecular layer. This ionized gas has a\nhigh density, n(e) ~ 30 cm{-3}, and a few percent filling factor. Thus, [N II]\nand [C II] at the Scutum arm tangency reveal a highly ionized gas with <n(e)>\nabout 10 to 20 times those of the interarm WIM, which is best explained by a\nmodel in which the interarm WIM is compressed as it falls into the potential\nwell of the arm. The widespread distribution of [N II] in the molecular layers\nshows that high density ionized gas is distributed throughout the Scutum arm.\nThe n(e) derived from [N II] for these molecular cloud regions are about 30\ncm{-3}, and probably arise in the ionized boundary layers of clouds. This [N\nII] emission from the ionized boundary layers is probably the result of the\nshock compression of the WIM as it impacts the arm's neutral gas, but some\ncould arise from extended HII regions.\n", "  We apply the recently-developed partition-free time-dependent\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker (TD-LB) formalism to the study of periodically-driven\ntransport in graphene nanoribbons (GNR). When an AC driving is applied, this\nformalism can be used to prove generic conditions for the existence of a\nnon-zero DC component of the net current (pump current) through the molecular\ndevice. Time-reversal symmetry breaking in the driving field is investigated\nand found to be insufficient for a non-zero pump current. We then derive\nexplicit formulas for the current response to a particular biharmonic bias. We\ncalculate the pump current through different GNR configurations and find that\nthe sign and existence of a non-zero pump current can be tuned by simple\nalterations to the static parameters of the TD bias. Further, we investigate\ntransient currents in different GNR configurations. We find a selection rule of\neven and odd harmonic response signal depending on a broken dynamical inversion\nsymmetry in the bias.\n", "  Context. The importance of the magnetic field in high-mass-star formation is\nnot yet fully clear and there are still many open questions concerning its role\nin the accretion processes and generation of jets and outflows. In the past few\nyears, masers have been successfully used to probe the magnetic field\nmorphology and strength at scales of a few au around massive protostars, by\nmeasuring linear polarisation angles and Zeeman splitting. The massive\nprotostar IRAS 18089-1732 is a well studied high-mass-star forming region,\nshowing a hot core chemistry and a disc-outflow system. Previous SMA\nobservations of polarised dust revealed an ordered magnetic field oriented\naround the disc of IRAS 18089-1732. Aims. We want to determine the magnetic\nfield in the dense region probed by 6.7 GHz methanol maser observations and\ncompare it with observations in dust continuum polarisation, to investigate how\nthe magnetic field in the compact maser region relates to the large-scale field\naround massive protostars. Methods. We reduced MERLIN observations at 6.7 GHz\nof IRAS 18089-1732 and we analysed the polarised emission by methanol masers.\nResults. Our MERLIN observations show that the magnetic field in the 6.7 GHz\nmethanol maser region is consistent with the magnetic field constrained by the\nSMA dust polarisation observations. A tentative detection of circularly\npolarised line emission is also presented. Conclusions. We found that the\nmagnetic field in the maser region has the same orientation as in the disk.\nThus the large-scale field component, even at the au scale of the masers,\ndominates over any small-scale field fluctuations. We obtained, from the\ncircular polarisation tentative detection, a field strength along the line of\nsight of 5.5 mG which appeared to be consistent with the previous estimates.\n", "  We give final shape to a recent formalism for deriving the functional forms\nof the primordial power spectra of single-scalar potential models and theories\nwhich are related to them by conformal transformation. An excellent analytic\napproximation is derived for the nonlocal correction factors which are crucial\nto capture the \"ringing\" that can result from features in the potential. We\nalso present the full algorithm for using our representation, including the\nnonlocal factors, to reconstruct the inflationary geometry from the power\nspectra.\n", "  By periodically driving the temperatures of reservoirs in quantum heat\nengines, geometric phase or Pancharatnam-Berry phase-like (PBp) effects in the\nthermodynamics can be observed. The PBp can be identified from a generating\nfunction (GF) method within an adiabatic quantum Markovian master equation\nformalism. The GF is shown not to lead to a standard open quantum system's\nfluctuation theorem in presence of phase-different modulations with an\ninapplicability in the use of the popular large deviation theory. Effect of\ncoherences on the optimized value of the flux is nullified due to PBp\ncontributions. The PBp causes the universality of the linear coefficient in the\nexpansion of the efficiency at maximum power in terms of Carnot efficiency to\nbe violated.\n", "  We develop a helioseismic inversion algorithm that can be used to recover\nsub-surface vertical profiles of 2-dimensional supergranular flows from surface\nmeasurements of synthetic wave travel times. We carry out seismic\nwave-propagation simulations through a 2-dimensional section of a flow profile\nthat resembles an averaged supergranule, and a starting model that has flows\nonly at the surface. We assume that the wave measurements are entirely without\nrealization noise for the purpose of our test. We expand the vertical profile\nof the supergranule stream function on a basis of B-splines. We iteratively\nupdate the B-spline coefficients of the supergranule model to reduce the\ntravel-times differences observed between the two simulations. We carry out the\nexercise for four different vertical profiles peaking at different depths below\nthe solar surface. We are able to accurately recover depth profiles of four\nsupergranule models at depths up to $8-10\\,\\text{Mm}$ below the solar surface\nusing $f-p_4$ modes, under the assumption that there is no realization noise.\nWe are able to obtain the peak depth and the depth of the return flow for each\nmodel. A basis-resolved inversion performs significantly better than one where\nthe flow field is inverted for at each point in the radial grid. This is an\nencouraging result and might act as a guide in developing more realistic\ninversion strategies that can be applied to supergranular flows in the Sun.\n", "  We present an NTT/SOFI spectroscopic survey of infrared selected Wolf-Rayet\ncandidates in the Scutum-Crux spiral arm (298 < l < 340, |b| < 0.5). We\nobtained near-IR spectra of 127 candidates, revealing 17 Wolf-Rayet stars - a\n~13% success rate - of which 16 are newly identified here. The majority of the\nnew Wolf-Rayet stars are classified as narrow-lined WN5-7 stars, with 2\nbroad-lined WN4-6 stars and 3 WC6-8 stars. The new stars, with distances\nestimated from previous absolute magnitude calibrations, have no obvious\nassociation with the Scutum-Crux arm. Refined near-infrared (YHJK)\nclassification criteria based on over a hundred Galactic and Magellanic Cloud\nWR stars, providing diagnostics for hydrogen in WN stars, plus the\nidentification of WO stars and intermediate WN/C stars. Finally, we find that\nonly a quarter of WR stars in the survey region are associated with star\nclusters and/or HII regions, with similar statistics found for Luminous Blue\nVariables in the Milky Way. The relative isolation of evolved massive stars is\ndiscussed, together with the significance of the co-location of LBVs and WR\nstars in young star clusters.\n", "  We describe a general mathematical framework for $\\chi^2$ discriminators in\nthe context of the compact binary coalescence search. We show that with any\n$\\chi^2$ is associated a vector bundle over the signal manifold, that is, the\nmanifold traced out by the signal waveforms in the function space of data\nsegments. The $\\chi^2$ is then defined as the square of the $L_2$ norm of the\ndata vector projected onto a finite dimensional subspace (the fibre) of the\nHilbert space of data trains and orthogonal to the signal waveform - any such\nfibre leads to a $\\chi^2$ discriminator and the full vector bundle comprising\nthe subspaces and the base manifold constitute the $\\chi^2$ discriminator. We\nshow that the $\\chi^2$ discriminators used so far in the CBC searches\ncorrespond to different fiber structures constituting different vector bundles\non the same base manifold, namely, the parameter space. The general formulation\nindicates procedures to formulate new $\\chi^2$s which could be more effective\nin discriminating against commonly occurring glitches in the data. It also\nshows that no $\\chi^2$ with a reasonable degree of freedom is foolproof. It\ncould also shed light on understanding why the traditional $\\chi^2$ works so\nwell. As an example, we propose a family of ambiguity $\\chi^2$ discriminators\nthat is an alternative to the traditional one. Any such ambiguity $\\chi^2$\nmakes use of the filtered output of the template bank, thus adding negligible\ncost to the overall search. We test the performance of ambiguity $\\chi^2$ on\nsimulated data using spinless TaylorF2 waveforms. We show that the ambiguity\n$\\chi^2$ essentially gives a clean separation between glitches and signals.\nFinally, we investigate the effects of mismatch between signal and templates on\nthe $\\chi^2$ and also further indicate how the ambiguity $\\chi^2$ can be\ngeneralized to detector networks for coherent observations.\n", "  The scientific yield of current and future optical surveys is increasingly\nlimited by systematic uncertainties in the flux calibration. This is the case\nfor Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology programs, where an improved calibration\ndirectly translates into improved cosmological constraints. Current methodology\nrests on models of stars. Here we aim to obtain flux calibration that is\ntraceable to state-of-the-art detector-based calibration. We present the SNIFS\nCalibration Apparatus (SCALA), a color (relative) flux calibration system\ndeveloped for the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS), operating at\nthe University of Hawaii 2.2 m (UH 88) telescope. By comparing the color trend\nof the illumination generated by SCALA during two commissioning runs, and to\nprevious laboratory measurements, we show that we can determine the light\nemitted by SCALA with a long-term repeatability better than 1%. We describe the\ncalibration procedure necessary to control for system aging. We present\nmeasurements of the SNIFS throughput as estimated by SCALA observations. The\nSCALA calibration unit is now fully deployed at the UH\\,88 telescope, and with\nit color-calibration between 4000 {\\AA} and 9000 {\\AA} is stable at the percent\nlevel over a one-year baseline.\n", "  We study analytically a modified dimerized Kitaev chain model under both\nperiodic and open boundary conditions and determine its phase diagram by\ncalculating the topological number and edge correlation functions of Majorana\nfermions. We explicitly give analytical solutions for eigenstates of the model\nunder open boundary conditions, which permit us to calculate two introduced\nedge correlation functions of Majorana fermions analytically. Our results\nindicate that the two edge correlation functions can be used to characterize\nthe trivial, Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like topological and topological\nsuperconductor phases. Furthermore, we find the existence of two different\ncoupling patterns of Majorana fermions in topological superconductor phase\ncharacterized by different edge correlation functions, which can also be\ndistinguished by investigating the survival probability of an edge Majorana\nunder sudden quenching of parameters.\n", "  Partition functions of quantum critical systems, expressed as conformal\nthermal tensor networks, are defined on various manifolds which can give rise\nto universal entropy corrections. Through high-precision tensor network\nsimulations of several quantum chains, we identify the universal entropy\n$S_{\\mathcal{K}} = \\ln{k}$ on the Klein bottle, where $k$ relates to quantum\ndimensions of the primary fields in conformal field theory (CFT). Different\nfrom the celebrated Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy $\\ln{g}$ ($g$ reflects\nnon-integer groundstate degeneracy), $S_{\\mathcal{K}}$ has \\textit{no} boundary\ndependence or surface energy terms accompanied, and can be very conveniently\nextracted from thermal data. On the M\\\"obius-strip manifold, we uncover an\nentropy $S_{\\mathcal{M}} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\ln{g} + \\ln{k})$ in CFT, where\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\ln{g}$ is associated with the only open edge of the M\\\"obius\nstrip, and $\\frac{1}{2} \\ln{k}$ with the non-orientable topology. We employ\n$S_{\\mathcal{K}}$ to accurately pinpoint the quantum phase transitions, even\nfor those without local order parameters.\n", "  We propose a method for calculating dynamical correlation functions at finite\ntemperature in integrable lattice models of Yang-Baxter type. The method is\nbased on an expansion of the correlation functions as a series over matrix\nelements of a time-dependent quantum transfer matrix rather than the\nHamiltonian. In the infinite Trotter-number limit the matrix elements become\ntime independent and turn into the thermal form factors studied previously in\nthe context of static correlation functions. We make this explicit with the\nexample of the XXZ model. We show how the form factors can be summed utilizing\ncertain auxiliary functions solving finite sets of nonlinear integral\nequations. The case of the XX model is worked out in more detail leading to a\nnovel form-factor series representation of the dynamical transverse two-point\nfunction.\n", "  Using the hydrodynamic model in the electrostatic approximation, we describe\nthe formation of graphene surface plasmons when a charge is in motion either\nperpendicular or parallel to a graphene sheet. In the first case, the\nelectron-energy loss (EEL) spectrum of the electron is computed, showing that\nthe resonances in the spectrum are linked to the frequency of the graphene\nsurface plasmons. In the second case, we discuss the formation of plasmonic\nwakes due to the dragging of the surface plasmons induced by the motion of the\ncharge. This effect is similar to Coulomb drag between two electron gases at a\ndistance from each other. We derive simple expressions for the electrostatic\npotential induced by the moving charge on graphene. We find an analytical\nexpression for the angle of the plasmonic wake valid in two opposite regimes.\nWe show that there is a transition from a Mach-type wake at high speeds to a\nKelvin-type wake at low ones and identify the Froude number for plasmonic\nwakes. We show that the Froude number can be controlled externally tunning both\nthe Fermi energy in graphene and the dielectric function of the environment, a\nsituation with no parallel in ship wakes.\n  Using EEL we propose a source of graphene plasmons, based on a graphene drum\nbuilt in a metallic waveguide and activated by an electron beam created by the\ntip of an electronic microscope.\n  We also introduce the notion of a plasmonic billiard.\n", "  We performed a simulation on the DUNE experiment to probe the capability of\nfuture neutrino long-baseline experiments' ability to constrain the parameter\nspace of high-energy models by using the correlation between the atmospheric\nand reactor mixing angles. As an example, we took the Tetrahedral Flavour\nSymmetry model, which predicts a strong relation between the non-zero value of\n$\\theta_{13}$ and deviation of $\\theta_{23}$ from the maximality. We show that\nin this case, the model can realistically be excluded in more than $3\\sigma$\nfor most of the parameter space. We also study the octant degeneracy at DUNE\nand its impact on the sensitivity of such models.\n", "  The classical spinning particles are considered such that quantization of\nclassical model leads to an irreducible massive representation of the\nPoincar\\'e group. The class of gauge equivalent classical particle world lines\nis shown to form a $[(d+1)/2]$-dimensional world sheet in $d$-dimensional\nMinkowski space, irrespectively to any specifics of classical model. For\nmassive spinning particles in $d=3,4$, the world sheets are shown to be\ncylinders. The radius of cylinder is fixed by representation. In higher\ndimensions, particle's world sheet turn out to be a toroidal cylinder\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{T}^D$, $D=[(d-1)/2]$. Proceeding from the fact that\nthe world lines of irreducible classical spinning particles are cylindrical\ncurves, while all the lines are gauge equivalent on the same world sheet, we\nsuggest a method to deduce the classical equations of motion for particles and\nalso to find their gauge symmetries. In $d=3$ Minkowski space, the spinning\nparticle path is defined by a single fourth-order differential equation having\ntwo zero-order gauge symmetries. The equation defines particle's path in\nMinkowski space, and it does not involve auxiliary variables. A special case is\nalso considered of cylindric null-curves, which are defined by a different\nsystem of equations. It is shown that the cylindric null-curves also correspond\nto irreducible massive spinning particles. For the higher-derivative equation\nof motion of the irreducible massive spinning particle, we deduce the\nequivalent second-order formulation involving an auxiliary variable. The\nsecond-order formulation agrees with a previously known spinning particle\nmodel.\n", "  We present the first threshold and jet radius jointly resummed cross section\nfor single-inclusive hadronic jet production. We work at next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy and our framework allows for a systematic extension beyond\nthe currently achieved precision. Longstanding numerical issues are overcome by\nperforming the resummation directly in momentum space within Soft Collinear\nEffective Theory. We present the first numerical results for the LHC and\nobserve an improved description of the available data. Our results are of\nimmediate relevance for LHC precision phenomenology including the extraction of\nparton distribution functions and the QCD strong coupling constant.\n", "  Spacetimes, which are representations of a bridge-like geometry in gravity\ntheory, are constructed as vacuum solutions to the first order equations of\nmotion. Each such configuration consists of two copies of an asymptotically\nflat sheet, connected by a bridge of finite extension where tetrad is\nnoninvertible. These solutions can be classified into static and non-static\nspacetimes. The associated SO(3,1) invariant fields, namely the metric, affine\nconnection and field-strength tensor, are all continuous across the\nhypersurfaces connecting the invertible and noninvertible phases of tetrad and\nare finite everywhere. These regular spacetime-bridge solutions do not have any\nanalogue in Einsteinian gravity in vacuum.\n", "  The prevalence and properties of kiloparsec-scale outflows in nearby Type 1\nquasars have been the subject of little previous attention. This work presents\nGemini integral field spectroscopy of ten Type 1 radio-quiet quasars at\n$z<0.3$. The excellent image quality, coupled with a new technique to remove\nthe point spread function using spectral information, allow the fitting of the\nunderlying host on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis. Fits to stars, line-emitting gas,\nand interstellar absorption show that 100% of the sample host warm ionized\nand/or cool neutral outflows with spatially-averaged velocities ($\\langle\nv_{98\\%}\\rangle \\equiv \\langle v+2\\sigma\\rangle$) of 200-1300 km/s and peak\nvelocities (maximum $v_{98\\%}$) of 500-2600 km/s. These minor-axis outflows are\npowered primarily by the central AGN, reach scales of 3-12 kpc, and often fill\nthe field of view. Including molecular data and Type 2 quasar measurements,\nnearby quasars show a wide range in mass outflow rates ($dM/dt = 1$ to $>$1000\nM$_\\odot$/yr) and momentum boosts [($c$ $dp/dt$)/L$_\\mathrm{AGN}$ = 0.01-20].\nAfter extending the mass scale to Seyferts, $dM/dt$ and $dE/dt$ correlate with\nblack hole mass ($dM/dt \\sim M_\\mathrm{BH}^{0.7\\pm0.3}$ and $dE/dt \\sim\nM_\\mathrm{BH}^{1.3\\pm0.5}$). Thus, the most massive black holes in the local\nuniverse power the most massive and energetic quasar-mode winds.\n", "  We present shape models and volume estimates of twenty asteroids based on\nrelative photometry and adaptive optics images. We discuss error estimation and\nthe effects of myopic deconvolution on shape solutions. For further analysis of\nthe information capacities of data sources, we also present and discuss\nambiguity and uniqueness results for the reconstruction of nonconvex shapes\nfrom photometry.\n", "  The atmospheres of between one quarter and one half of observed single white\ndwarfs in the Milky Way contain heavy element pollution from planetary debris.\nThe pollution observed in white dwarfs in binary star systems is, however, less\nclear, because companion star winds can generate a stream of matter which is\naccreted by the white dwarf. Here we (i) discuss the necessity or lack thereof\nof a major planet in order to pollute a white dwarf with orbiting minor planets\nin both single and binary systems, and (ii) determine the critical binary\nseparation beyond which the accretion source is from a planetary system. We\nhence obtain user-friendly functions relating this distance to the masses and\nradii of both stars, the companion wind, and the accretion rate onto the white\ndwarf, for a wide variety of published accretion prescriptions. We find that\nfor the majority of white dwarfs in known binaries, if pollution is detected,\nthen that pollution should originate from planetary material.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetic phase diagram near the upper critical field\nof KFe2As2 by magnetic torque and specific heat experiments, using a\nhigh-resolution piezo-rotary positioner to precisely control the parallel\norientation of the magnetic field with respect to the FeAs layers. We observe a\nclear double transition when the field is oriented strictly in-plane, and a\ncharacteristic upturn of the upper critical field line well beyond the Pauli\nlimit at 4.7 T. This provides firm evidence that an FFLO state is realized in\nthis iron-based KFe2As2 superconductor.\n", "  We carried out targeted ALMA observations of 129 fields in the COSMOS region\nat 1.25 mm, detecting 152 galaxies at S/N$\\geq$5 with an average continuum RMS\nof 150 $\\mu$Jy. These fields represent a S/N-limited sample of AzTEC / ASTE\nsources with 1.1 mm S/N$\\geq$4 over an area of 0.72 square degrees. Given\nALMA's fine resolution and the exceptional spectroscopic and multiwavelength\nphotometric data available in COSMOS, this survey allows us unprecedented power\nin identifying submillimeter galaxy counterparts and determining their\nredshifts through spectroscopic or photometric means. In addition to 30 sources\nwith prior spectroscopic redshifts, we identified redshifts for 113 galaxies\nthrough photometric methods and an additional nine sources with lower limits,\nwhich allowed a statistically robust determination of the redshift\ndistribution. We have resolved 33 AzTEC sources into multi-component systems\nand our redshifts suggest that nine are likely to be physically associated. Our\noverall redshift distribution peaks at $z\\sim$2.0 with a high redshift tail\nskewing the median redshift to $\\tilde{z}$=2.48$\\pm$0.05. We find that brighter\nmillimeter sources are preferentially found at higher redshifts. Our faintest\nsources, with S$_{1.25 \\rm mm}$<1.25 mJy, have a median redshift of\n$\\tilde{z}$=2.18$\\pm$0.09, while the brightest sources, S$_{1.25 \\rm mm}$>1.8\nmJy, have a median redshift of $\\tilde{z}$=3.08$\\pm$0.17. After accounting for\nspectral energy distribution shape and selection effects these results are\nconsistent with several previous submillimeter galaxy surveys, and moreover,\nsupport the conclusion that the submillimeter galaxy redshift distribution is\nsensitive to survey depth.\n", "  We study quantum Brownian motion (QBM) models for a particle in a dissipative\nenvironment coupled to a periodic potential. We review QBM for a particle in a\none-dimensional periodic potential and extend the study to that for a particle\nin two-dimensional (2D) periodic potentials of four Bravais lattice types:\nsquare, rectangular, triangular (hexagonal), and centered rectangular. We\nperform perturbative renormalization group analyses to derive the zero\ntemperature flow diagrams and phase boundaries for a particle in these\npotentials, and observe localization behavior dependent on the anisotropy of\nthe lattice parameters.\n", "  It is well-known that the non-strictly thermal character of the Hawking\nradiation spectrum generates a natural correspondence between Hawking radiation\nand black hole quasinormal modes. This main issue has been analyzed in the\nframework of Schwarzschild black holes, Kerr black holes and nonextremal\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes. In this paper, by introducing the effective\ntemperature, we reanalysis the non-strictly thermal character of large AdS\nblack holes. The results show that the effective mass corresponding to the\neffective temperature is approximatively the average one in any dimension. And\nthe other effective quantities can also be obtained. Based on the known forms\nof frequency in quasinormal modes, we reanalysis the asymptotic frequencies of\nthe large AdS black hole in three and five dimensions. Then we get the formulas\nof the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the horizon's area quantization with\nfunctions of the quantum \"overtone\" number $n$.\n", "  We have previously reported on models of low-mass stars in which the presence\nof inflated radii is ascribed to magnetic fields which impede the onset of\nconvection (e.g. MacDonald & Mullan [2017a] and citations therein). Some of our\nmagneto-convection models have been criticized because, when they were first\nreported by Mullan & MacDonald (2001), the deep interior fields were found to\nbe very large (50-100 MG). Such large fields are now known to be untenable. For\nexample, Browning et al. (2016) used stability arguments to suggest that\ninterior fields in low-mass stars cannot be larger than ~1 MG. Moreover, 3D\nmodels of turbulent stellar dynamos suggest that fields generated in low-mass\ninteriors may be not much stronger than 10-20 kG (Browning 2008). In the\npresent paper, we present magneto-convective models of inflated low-mass stars\nin which the interior fields are not permitted to be stronger than 10 kG. These\nmodels are used to fit empirical data for 15 low-mass stars for which precise\nmasses and radii have been measured. We show that our 10 kG magneto-convective\nmodels can replicate the empirical radii and effective temperatures for 14 of\nthe stars. In the case of the remaining star (in the Praesepe cluster), two\ndifferent solutions have been reported in the literature. We find that one of\nthese solutions (by Gillen et al. 2017) can be fitted well with our model using\nthe nominal age of Praesepe (800 Myr). However, the second solution (by Kraus\net al. 2017) cannot be fitted unless the star's age is assumed to be much\nyounger (~ 150 Myr).\n", "  We present a novel approach and a theoretical framework for generating high\norder exceptional points of degeneracy (EPD) in photonic structures based on\nperiodic coupled resonators optical waveguides (CROWs). Such EPDs involve the\ncoalescence of Floquet-Bloch eigenwaves in CROWs, without the presence of gain\nand loss, which is in contrast to the requirement of Parity-Time (PT) symmetry\nto develop exceptional points based on gain and loss balance. The EPDs arise\nhere by introducing symmetry breaking in a conventional chain of coupled\nresonators through coupling the chain of resonators to an adjacent uniform\noptical waveguide, which leads to unique modal characteristics that cannot be\nrealized in conventional CROWs. Such remarkable characteristics include high\nquality factors (Q-factor) and strong field enhancement, even without any\nmirrors at the two ends of a cavity. We show for the first time the capability\nof CROWs to exhibit EPDs of various order; including the degenerate band edge\n(DBE) and the stationary inflection point (SIP). The proposed CROW of finite\nlength shows enhanced quality factor when operating near the DBE, and the\nQ-factor exhibits an anomalous scaling with the CROW's length. We develop the\ntheory of EPDs in such unconventional CROW using coupled-wave equations, and we\nderive an analytical expression for the dispersion relation. The proposed\nunconventional CROW concepts have various potential applications including\nQ-switching, nonlinear devices, lasers, and extremely sensitive sensors.\n", "  The encoding of quantum information in photonic time-bin qubits is apt for\nlong distance quantum communication schemes. In practice, due to technical\nconstraints such as detector response time, or the speed with which\nco-polarized time-bins can be switched, other encodings, e.g. polarization, are\noften preferred for operations like state detection. Here, we present the\nconversion of qubits between polarization and time-bin encodings using a method\nthat is based on an ultrafast optical Kerr shutter and attain efficiencies of\n97% and an average fidelity of 0.827+/-0.003 with shutter speeds near 1 ps. Our\ndemonstration delineates an essential requirement for the development of hybrid\nand high-rate optical quantum networks.\n", "  The pairing-plus-quadrupole Hamiltonian is diagonalized in a symmetry\nrestored basis, i.e., the triaxial quasiparticle-states with angular momentum\nand particle number projections, and applied for chiral doublet bands in 128Cs.\nThe observed energy spectra and electromagnetic transition probabilities are\nreproduced well without introducing any parameter. The orientation of the\nangular momentum in the intrinsic frame is investigated by the distributions of\nits components on the three principle axes as well as those of its tilted\nangles. The evolution of the chirality with spin is illustrated and the chiral\ngeometry is demonstrated in the angular momentum projected model for the first\ntime.\n", "  We study quantitatively the importance of the recently derived NLO\ncorrections to the DIS structure functions at small x in the dipole formalism.\nWe show that these corrections can be significant and depend on the\nfactorization scheme used to resum large logarithms of energy into\nrenormalization group evolution with the BK equation. This feature is similar\nto what has recently been observed for single inclusive forward hadron\nproduction. Using a factorization scheme consistent with the one recently\nproposed for the single inclusive cross section, we show that it is possible to\nobtain meaningful results for the DIS cross sections.\n", "  Logarithmic or Sinai type subdiffusion is usually associated with random\nforce disorder and non-stationary potential fluctuations whose root mean\nsquared amplitude grows with distance. We show here that extremely persistent,\nmacroscopic ultraslow logarithmic diffusion also universally emerges at\nsufficiently low temperatures in stationary Gaussian random potentials with\nspatially decaying correlations, known to exist in a broad range of physical\nsystems. Combining results from extensive simulations with a scaling approach\nwe elucidate the physical mechanism of this unusual subdiffusion. In\nparticular, we explain why with growing temperature and/or time a first\ncrossover occurs to standard, power-law subdiffusion, with a time-dependent\npower law exponent, and then a second crossover occurs to normal diffusion with\na disorder-renormalized diffusion coefficient. Interestingly, the initial,\nnominally ultraslow diffusion turns out to be much faster than the universal de\nGennes-Baessler-Zwanzig limit of the renormalized normal diffusion, which\nphysically cannot be attained at sufficiently low temperatures and/or for\nstrong disorder. The ultraslow diffusion is also non-ergodic and displays a\nlocal bias phenomenon. Our simple scaling theory not only explains our\nnumerical findings, but qualitatively has also a predictive character.\n", "  Pair beams produced by very high-energy radiation from TeV blazars emit gamma\nrays in the GeV band by inverse-Compton scattering of soft photons. The\nobserved GeV-band signal is smaller than that expected from the full\nelectromagnetic cascade. This means that the pair beams must be affected by\nother physical processes reducing their energy flux. One possible loss\nmechanism involves beam-plasma instabilities that we consider in the present\nwork. For realistic parameters the pair beams can not be simulated by modern\ncomputers. Instead, we use a simple analytical model to find a range of the\nbeam parameters that (i) provides a physical picture similar to that of\nrealistic pair beams and (ii) at the same time can be handled by available\ncomputational resources. Afterwards, we performed corresponding 2D PIC\nsimulations. We confirm that the beams experience only small changes in the\nrelevant parameter regime, and other processes such as deflection in magnetic\nfield must be at play.\n", "  We present a new analysis of the interstellar protons toward the TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray SNR RX J0852.0$-$4622 (G266.2$-$1.2, Vela Jr.). We used the\nNANTEN2 $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) and ATCA & Parkes HI datasets in order to derive\nthe molecular and atomic gas associated with the TeV $\\gamma$-ray shell of the\nSNR. We find that atomic gas over a velocity range from $V_\\mathrm{LSR}$ = $-4$\nkm s$^{-1}$ to 50 km s$^{-1}$ or 60 km s$^{-1}$ is associated with the entire\nSNR, while molecular gas is associated with a limited portion of the SNR. The\nlarge velocity dispersion of the HI is ascribed to the expanding motion of a\nfew HI shells overlapping toward the SNR but is not due to the Galactic\nrotation. The total masses of the associated HI and molecular gases are\nestimated to be $\\sim2.5 \\times 10^4 $ $M_{\\odot}$ and $\\sim10^3$ $M_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively. A comparison with the H.E.S.S. TeV $\\gamma$-rays indicates that\nthe interstellar protons have an average density around 100 cm$^{-3}$ and shows\na good spatial correspondence with the TeV $\\gamma$-rays. The total cosmic ray\nproton energy is estimated to be $\\sim10^{48}$ erg for the hadronic\n$\\gamma$-ray production, which may still be an underestimate by a factor of a\nfew due to a small filling factor of the SNR volume by the interstellar\nprotons. This result presents a third case, after RX J1713.7$-$3946 and HESS\nJ1731$-$347, of the good spatial correspondence between the TeV $\\gamma$-rays\nand the interstellar protons, lending further support for a hadronic component\nin the $\\gamma$-rays from young TeV $\\gamma$-ray SNRs.\n", "  The tangential YORP effect (TYORP) plays a significant role in the dynamical\nevolution of asteroids, and up to now has only been studied numerically. This\npaper describes the first analytic model of the TYORP effect. Although the\nmodel rests on numerous physical and mathematical simplifications, the final\nanalytic expression for TYORP is found to be in agreement with the results of\nrigorous numeric simulations to the accuracy of several tens per cent.\n  The obtained analytic expression is used to estimate the TYORP produced by\nthe non-flat surface of regolith, -- a contribution to TYORP that has never\nbeen considered. It is found that the contribution to TYORP arising from\nregolith can be comparable to the conventional TYORP produced by boulders.\n  Then, the analytic expression is fitted with a log-normal function and used\nto integrate TYORP over all boulder sizes. The general trend of TYORP for\nmultiple boulders appears qualitatively similar to the trend of one boulder,\nand also demonstrates a maximal TYORP at some particular rotation rate. The\nobtained expression for integrated TYORP may be instrumental for simulations of\nevolution of asteroids subject to TYORP.\n  To conclude, the physical origin of TYORP is discussed in light of the\nconstructed analytic model.\n", "  We present detailed analytical modelling and in-depth investigation of\nwide-angle reflect-mode metagrating beam splitters. These recently introduced\nultrathin devices are capable of implementing intricate diffraction engineering\nfunctionalities with only a single meta-atom per macro-period, making them\nconsiderably simpler to synthesize than conventional metasurfaces. We extend\nupon recent work and focus on electrically-polarizable metagratings, comprised\nof loaded conducting wires in front of a perfect elecric conductor, excited by\ntransverse-electric polarized fields, which are more practical for planar\nfabrication. The derivation further relates the metagrating performance\nparameters to the individual meta-atom load, facilitating an efficient\nsemianalytical synthesis scheme to determine the required conductor geometry\nfor achieving optimal beam splitting. Subsequently, we utilize the model to\nanalyze the effects of realistic conductor losses, reactance deviations, and\nfrequency shifts on the device performance, and reveal that metagratings\nfeature preferable working points, in which the sensitivity to these\nnon-idealities is rather low. The analytical relations shed light on the\nphysical origin of this phenomenon, associating it with fundamental\ninterference processes taking place in the device. These results, verified via\nfull-wave simulations of realistic physical structures, yield a set of\nefficient engineering tools, as well as profound physical intuition, for\ndevising future metagrating devices, with immense potential for microwave,\nterahertz, and optical beam-manipulation applications.\n", "  We investigate quantum teleportation of ensembles of coherent states of light\nwith a Gaussian distributed displacement in phase space. Recently, the\nfollowing general question has been addressed in [P. Liuzzo-Scorpo et al.,\narXiv:1705.03017]: Given a limited amount of entanglement and mean energy\navailable as resources, what is the maximal fidelity that can be achieved on\naverage in the teleportation of such an alphabet of states? Here, we consider a\nvariation of this question, where Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering is used as a\nresource rather than plain entanglement. We provide a solution by means of an\noptimisation within the space of Gaussian quantum channels, which allows for an\nintuitive visualisation of the problem. We first show that not all channels are\naccessible with a finite degree of steering, and then prove that practical\nschemes relying on asymmetric two-mode Gaussian states enable one to reach the\nmaximal fidelity at the border with the inaccessible region. Our results\nprovide a rigorous quantitative assessment of steering as a resource for secure\nquantum teleportation beyond the so-called no-cloning threshold. The schemes we\npropose can be readily implemented experimentally by a conventional\nBraunstein-Kimble continuous variable teleportation protocol involving homodyne\ndetections and corrective displacements with an optimally tuned gain. These\nprotocols can be integrated as elementary building blocks in quantum networks,\nfor reliable storage and transmission of quantum optical states.\n", "  Various corrections to the eikonal approximations are studied for two- and\nthree-body nuclear collisions with the goal to extend the range of validity of\nthis approximation to beam energies of 10 MeV/nucleon. Wallace's correction\ndoes not improve much the elastic-scattering cross sections obtained at the\nusual eikonal approximation. On the contrary, a semiclassical approximation\nthat substitutes the impact parameter by a complex distance of closest approach\ncomputed with the projectile-target optical potential efficiently corrects the\neikonal approximation. This opens the possibility to analyze data measured down\nto 10 MeV/nucleon within eikonal-like reaction models.\n", "  In Hezaveh et al. 2017 we showed that deep learning can be used for model\nparameter estimation and trained convolutional neural networks to determine the\nparameters of strong gravitational lensing systems. Here we demonstrate a\nmethod for obtaining the uncertainties of these parameters. We review the\nframework of variational inference to obtain approximate posteriors of Bayesian\nneural networks and apply it to a network trained to estimate the parameters of\nthe Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid plus external shear and total flux\nmagnification. We show that the method can capture the uncertainties due to\ndifferent levels of noise in the input data, as well as training and\narchitecture-related errors made by the network. To evaluate the accuracy of\nthe resulting uncertainties, we calculate the coverage probabilities of\nmarginalized distributions for each lensing parameter. By tuning a single\nhyperparameter, the dropout rate, we obtain coverage probabilities\napproximately equal to the confidence levels for which they were calculated,\nresulting in accurate and precise uncertainty estimates. Our results suggest\nthat neural networks can be a fast alternative to Monte Carlo Markov Chains for\nparameter uncertainty estimation in many practical applications, allowing more\nthan seven orders of magnitude improvement in speed.\n", "  We compute the fluxes of radio photons from conversion of axion-like particle\ndark matter in cosmic magnetic fields. We find that for axion-like particle\nmasses around $10^{-6}\\,$eV and effective coupling constants to photons\n$g_{a\\gamma}\\gtrsim10^{-13}\\,{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ strongly magnetized nearby stellar\nwinds may give detectable line-like radio photon signals, although predicted\nfluxes are highly uncertain due to the poorly known structure of the magnetic\nfields. Nevertheless, it may be worth while to conduct a dedicated search in\nthe direction of such sources. When combined with a possible future laboratory\ndetection of axion-like dark matter such observations may in turn provide\ninformation on the small scale magnetic field structure in such objects.\n", "  The adsorption energy of benzene on various metal substrates is predicted\nusing the random phase approximation (RPA) for the correlation energy.\nAgreement with available experimental data is systematically better than 10%\nfor both coinage and reactive metals. The results are also compared with more\napproximate methods, including vdW-density functional theory (DFT), as well as\ndispersion corrected DFT functionals. Although dispersion corrected DFT can\nyield accurate results, for instance, on coinage metals, the adsorption\nenergies are clearly overestimated on more reactive transition metals.\nFurthermore, coverage dependent adsorption energies are well described by the\nRPA. This shows that for the description of aromatic molecules on metal\nsurfaces further improvements in density functionals are necessary, or more\ninvolved many body methods such as the RPA are required.\n", "  We present the detection and morphological characterization of hot molecular\ngas outflows in nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, using the near-IR\nintegral-field spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. We detect outflows observed in\nthe 2.12 micron H$_{2}$ 1-0 S(1) line for three out of four ULIRGs analyzed;\nIRAS 12112+0305, 14348-1447, and 22491-1808. The outflows are mapped on scales\nof 0.7-1.6 kpc, show typical outflow velocities of 300-500 km/s, and appear to\noriginate from the nuclear region. The outflows comprise hot molecular gas\nmasses of ~6-8x10$^3$ M(sun). Assuming a hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio\nof 6x10$^{-5}$, as found in nearby luminous IR galaxies, the total (hot+cold)\nmolecular gas mass in these outflows is expected to be ~1x10$^{8}$ M(sun). This\ntranslates into molecular mass outflow rates of ~30-85 M(sun)/yr, which is a\nfactor of a few lower than the star formation rate in these ULIRGs. In\naddition, most of the outflowing molecular gas does not reach the escape\nvelocity of these merger systems, which implies that the bulk of the outflowing\nmolecular gas is re-distributed within the system and thus remains available\nfor future star formation. The fastest H$_{2}$ outflow is seen in the\nCompton-thick AGN of IRAS 14348-1447, reaching a maximum outflow velocity of\n~900 km/s. Another ULIRG, IRAS 17208-0014, shows asymmetric H$_{2}$ line\nprofiles different from the outflows seen in the other three ULIRGs. We discuss\nseveral alternative explanations for its line asymmetries, including a very\ngentle galactic wind, internal gas dynamics, low-velocity gas outside the disk,\nor two superposed gas disks. We do not detect the hot molecular counterpart to\nthe outflow previously detected in CO(2-1) in IRAS 17208-0014, but we note that\nour SINFONI data are not sensitive enough to detect this outflow if it has a\nsmall hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio of < 9x10$^{-6}$.\n", "  Factorization of scattering is the hallmark of integrable 1+1 dimensional\nquantum field theories. For factorization of scattering to be possible the set\nof masses and momenta must be conserved in any two-to-two scattering process.\nWe use this fact to constrain the form of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes for\nintegrable supergravity anti-de Sitter backgrounds by analysing tree-level\nscattering of two AdS bosons into two fermions on the worldsheet of a BMN\nstring. We find a condition which can be efficiently used to rule out\nintegrability of AdS strings and therefore of the corresponding AdS/CFT\ndualities, as we demonstrate for some simple examples.\n", "  This work details the development of a three-dimensional (3D) electric field\nmodel for the LUX detector. The detector took data during two periods of\nsearching for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) searches. After the\nfirst period completed, a time-varying non-uniform negative charge developed in\nthe polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) panels that define the radial boundary of\nthe detector's active volume. This caused electric field variations in the\ndetector in time, depth and azimuth, generating an electrostatic\nradially-inward force on electrons on their way upward to the liquid surface.\nTo map this behavior, 3D electric field maps of the detector's active volume\nwere built on a monthly basis. This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL\nMultiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected\non a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the\ncourse of the exposure from -3.6 to $-5.5~\\mu$C/m$^2$. From our studies, we\ndeduce that the electric field magnitude varied while the mean value of the\nfield of $\\sim200$~V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure. As a result\nof this work the varying electric fields and their impact on event\nreconstruction and discrimination were successfully modeled.\n", "  We analytically derived the effective two-body interaction for a finite\nthickness quantum Hall system with a harmonic perpendicular confinement and an\nin-plane magnetic field. The anisotropic effective interaction in the lowest\nLandau level (LLL) and first Landau level (1LL) are expanded in the basis of\nthe generalized pseudopotentials (PPs), and we analyze how the coefficients of\nsome prominent isotropic and anisotropic PPs depend on the thickness of the\nsample and the strength of the in-plane magnetic field. We also investigate the\nstability of the topological quantum Hall states, especially the Laughlin state\nand its emergent guiding center metric, which we can now compute analytically.\nAn interesting reorientation of the anisotropy direction of the Laughlin state\nin the 1LL is revealed, and we also discuss various possible experimental\nramifications for this quantum Hall system with broken rotational symmetry.\n", "  We develop a lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method for charged mixtures\ncapable of treating dielectric heterogeneities. Using this method, we study\noil-water mixtures containing an antagonistic salt, with hydrophilic cations\nand hydrophobic anions. Our simulations reveal several phases with a spatially\nmodulated solvent composition, in which the ions partition between water-rich\nand water-poor regions according to their affinity. In addition to the recently\nobserved lamellar phase, we find tubular, droplet, and even gyroid phases\nreminiscent of those found in block copolymers and surfactant systems.\nInterestingly, these structures stem from ion-mediated interactions, which\nallows for tuning of the phase behavior via the concentrations, the ionic\nproperties, and the temperature.\n", "  A novel approach for extracting gauge-invariant information about spin-orbit\ncoupling in gravitationally interacting binary systems is introduced. This\napproach is based on the \"scattering holonomy\", i.e. the integration (from the\ninfinite past to the infinite future) of the differential spin evolution along\nthe two worldlines of a binary system in hyperboliclike motion. We apply this\napproach to the computation, at the first post-Minkowskian approximation (i.e.\nfirst order in $G$ and all orders in $v/c$), of the values of the two\ngyrogravitomagnetic ratios describing spin-orbit coupling in the Effective\nOne-Body formalism. These gyrogravitomagnetic ratios are found to tend to zero\nin the ultrarelativistic limit.\n", "  We present a measurement of the DLA mean bias from the cross-correlation of\nDLA and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest, updating earlier results of Font-Ribera et al.\n2012 with the final BOSS Data Release and an improved method to address\ncontinuum fitting corrections. Our cross-correlation is well fitted by linear\ntheory with the standard $\\Lambda CDM$ model, with a DLA bias of $b_{\\rm DLA} =\n1.99\\pm 0.11$; a more conservative analysis, which removes DLA in the Ly$\\beta$\nforest and uses only the cross-correlation at $r> 10{\\rm h^{-1}\\,Mpc}$, yields\n$b_{\\rm DLA} = 2.00\\pm 0.19$. This assumes the cosmological model from\n\\cite{Planck2015} and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest bias factors of Bautista et al.\n2017, and includes only statistical errors obtained from bootstrap analysis.\nThe main systematic errors arise from possible impurities and selection effects\nin the DLA catalogue, and from uncertainties in the determination of the\nLy$\\alpha$ forest bias factors and a correction for effects of high column\ndensity absorbers. We find no dependence of the DLA bias on column density or\nredshift. The measured bias value corresponds to a host halo mass $\\sim\n4\\cdot10^{11} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ if all DLA were hosted in halos of a similar\nmass. In a realistic model where host halos over a broad mass range have a DLA\ncross section $\\Sigma(M_h) \\propto M_h^{\\alpha}$ down to $M_h > M_{\\rm min}\n=10^{8.5} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, we find that $\\alpha > 1$ is required to have\n$b_{\\rm DLA}> 1.7$, implying a steeper relation or higher value of $M_{\\rm\nmin}$ than is generally predicted in numerical simulations of galaxy formation.\n", "  We examine the ballistic conduction through Au-NiMnSb-Au heterostructures\nconsisting of up to four units of NiMnSb in the scattering region. We\ninvestigate the dependence of the transmission function computed within the\nlocal spin density approximation (LSDA) of the density functional theory (DFT)\non the number of half-metallic units in the scattering region. For a single\nNiMnSb unit the transmission function displays a spin polarization of around 50\n% in a window of 1 eV centered around the Fermi level. By increasing the number\nof layers an almost complete spin polarization of the transmission is obtained\nin the same energy window. Supplementing the DFT-LSDA calculations with local\nelectronic interactions, of Hubbard-type on the Mn sites, leads to a\nhybridization between the interface and many-body states. The significant\nreduction of the spin polarization seen in the density of states is not\napparent in the spin-polarization of the conduction electron transmission,\nwhich suggests the localized nature of the hybridized interface and many-body\ninduced states.\n", "  In this work, we study in detail the effects of many-body forces on the\nequation of state and the structure of magnetic neutron stars. The stellar\nmatter is described within a relativistic mean field formalism that takes into\naccount many-body forces by means of a non-linear meson field dependence on the\nnuclear interaction coupling constants. We assume that matter is at zero\ntemperature, charge neutral, in beta-equilibrium, and populated by the baryon\noctet, electrons, and muons. In order to study the effects of different degrees\nof stiffness in the equation of state, we explore the parameter space of the\nmodel, which reproduces nuclear matter properties at saturation, as well as\nmassive neutron stars. Magnetic field effects are introduced both in the\nequation of state and in the macroscopic structure of stars by the\nself-consistent solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In addition,\neffects of poloidal magnetic fields on the global properties of stars, as well\nas density and magnetic field profiles are investigated. We find that not only\ndifferent macroscopic magnetic field distributions, but also different\nparameterizations of the model for a fixed magnetic field distribution impact\nthe gravitational mass, deformation and internal density profiles of stars.\nFinally, we also show that strong magnetic fields affect significantly the\nparticle populations of stars\n", "  Reconciling the stability of epigenetic patterns with the rapid turnover of\nhistone modifications and their adaptability to external stimuli is an\noutstanding challenge. Here, we propose a new biophysical mechanism that can\nestablish and maintain robust yet plastic epigenetic domains via genomic\nbookmarking (GBM). We model chromatin as a recolourable polymer whose segments\nbear non-permanent histone marks (or colours) which can be modified by \"writer\"\nproteins. The three-dimensional chromatin organisation is mediated by protein\nbridges, or \"readers\", such as Polycomb Repressive Complexes and Transcription\nFactors. The coupling between readers and writers drives spreading of\nbiochemical marks and sustains the memory of local chromatin states across\nreplication and mitosis. In contrast, GBM-targeted perturbations destabilise\nthe epigenetic patterns. Strikingly, we demonstrate that GBM alone can explain\nthe full distribution of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome. We\nfinally suggest that our model provides a starting point for an understanding\nof the biophysics of cellular differentiation and reprogramming.\n", "  We study the case of multi-component dark matter, in particular how direct\ndetection signals are modified in the presence of several stable\nweakly-interacting-massive particles. Assuming a positive signal in a future\ndirect detection experiment, stemming from two dark matter components, we study\nthe region in parameter space where it is possible to distinguish a one from a\ntwo-component dark matter spectrum. First, we leave as free parameters the two\ndark matter masses and show that the two hypotheses can be significantly\ndiscriminated for a range of dark matter masses with their splitting being the\ncritical factor. We then investigate how including the effects of different\ninteraction strengths, local densities or velocity dispersions for the two\ncomponents modifies these conclusions. We also consider the case of\nisospin-violating couplings. In all scenarios, we show results for various\ntypes of nuclei both for elastic spin-independent and spin-dependent\ninteractions. Finally, assuming that the two-component hypothesis is confirmed,\nwe quantify the accuracy with which the parameters can be extracted and discuss\nthe different degeneracies that occur. This includes studying the case in which\nonly a single experiment observes a signal, and also the scenario of having two\nsignals from two different experiments, in which case the ratios of the\ncouplings to neutrons and protons may also be extracted.\n", "  In this work, we demonstrate the importance of considering correlations\nbetween degenerate Zeeman sublevels that develop in dense atomic ensembles. In\norder to do this, we develop a set of equations capable of simulating large\nnumbers of atoms while still incorporating correlations between degenerate\nZeeman sublevels. This set of equations is exact in the single-photon limit,\nand may be interpreted as a generalization of the coupled harmonic oscillator\nequations typically used the literature. Using these equations, we demonstrate\nthat in sufficiently dense systems, correlations between Zeeman sublevels can\ncause non-trivial differences in the photon scattering lineshape in arrays and\nclouds of atoms.\n", "  We present a novel algorithm based on a Bayesian method for 2D tilted-ring\nanalysis of disk galaxy velocity fields. Compared to the conventional\nalgorithms based on a chi-squared minimisation procedure, this new\nBayesian-based algorithm suffers less from local minima of the model parameters\neven with highly multi-modal posterior distributions. Moreover, the Bayesian\nanalysis, implemented via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, only\nrequires broad ranges of posterior distributions of the parameters, which makes\nthe fitting procedure fully automated. This feature will be essential when\nperforming kinematic analysis on the large number of resolved galaxies expected\nto be detected in neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys with the Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA) and its pathfinders. The so-called '2D Bayesian Automated Tilted-ring\nfitter' (2DBAT) implements Bayesian fits of 2D tilted-ring models in order to\nderive rotation curves of galaxies. We explore 2DBAT performance on (a)\nartificial HI data cubes built based on representative rotation curves of\nintermediate-mass and massive spiral galaxies, and (b) Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) HI data from the Local Volume HI Survey (LVHIS). We find\nthat 2DBAT works best for well-resolved galaxies with intermediate inclinations\n(20 deg < i < 70 deg), complementing three-dimensional techniques better suited\nto modelling inclined galaxies.\n", "  Disordered spring networks that are undercoordinated may abruptly rigidify\nwhen sufficient strain is applied. Since the deformation in response to applied\nstrain does not change the generic quantifiers of network architecture - the\nnumber of nodes and the number of bonds between them - this rigidity transition\nmust have a geometric origin. Naive, degree-of-freedom based mechanical\nanalyses such as the Maxwell-Calladine count or the pebble game algorithm\noverlook such geometric rigidity transitions and offer no means of predicting\nor characterizing them. We apply tools that were developed for the topological\nanalysis of zero modes and states of self-stress on regular lattices to\ntwo-dimensional random spring networks, and demonstrate that the onset of\nrigidity, at a finite simple shear strain $\\gamma^\\star$, coincides with the\nappearance of a single state of self stress, accompanied by a single floppy\nmode. The process conserves the topologically invariant difference between the\nnumber of zero modes and the number of states of self stress, but imparts a\nfinite shear modulus to the spring network. Beyond the critical shear, we\nconfirm previously reported critical scaling of the modulus. In the\nsub-critical regime, a singular value decomposition of the network's\ncompatibility matrix foreshadows the onset of rigidity by way of a continuously\nvanishing singular value corresponding to nascent state of self stress.\n", "  Outcomes of numerical relativity simulations of massive core collapses or\nbinary neutron star mergers with moderate masses suggest formations of rapidly\nand differentially rotating neutron stars. Subsequent fall back accretion may\nalso amplify the degree of differential rotations. We propose new formulations\nfor modeling differential rotations of those compact stars, and present\nselected solutions of differentially rotating, stationary, and axisymmetric\ncompact stars in equilibriums. For the cases when rotating stars reach break-up\nvelocities, the maximum masses of such rotating models are obtained.\n", "  We present a second set of results from a wide-field photometric survey of\nthe environs of Milky Way globular clusters. The clusters studied are NGC 1261,\nNGC 1851 and NGC 5824: all have data from DECam on the Blanco 4m telescope. NGC\n5824 also has data from the Magellan Clay telescope with MegaCam. We confirm\nthe existence of a large diffuse stellar envelope surrounding NGC 1851 of size\nat least 240 pc in radius. The radial density profile of the envelope follows a\npower-law decline with index $\\gamma = -1.5 \\pm 0.2$ and the projected shape is\nslightly elliptical. For NGC 5824 there is no strong detection of a diffuse\nstellar envelope, but we find the cluster is remarkably extended and is similar\nin size (at least 230 pc in radius) to the envelope of NGC 1851. A stellar\nenvelope is also revealed around NGC 1261. However, it is notably smaller in\nsize with radius $\\sim$105 pc. The radial density profile of the envelope is\nalso much steeper with $\\gamma = -3.8 \\pm 0.2$. We discuss the possible nature\nof the diffuse stellar envelopes, but are unable to draw definitive conclusions\nbased on the current data. NGC 1851, and potentially NGC 5824, could be\nstripped dwarf galaxy nuclei, akin to the cases of $\\omega$ Cen, M54 and M2. On\nthe other hand, the different characteristics of the NGC 1261 envelope suggest\nthat it may be the product of dynamical evolution of the cluster.\n", "  The minimal theory of quasidilaton massive gravity allows for a stable\nself-accelerating de Sitter solution in a wide range of parameters. On the\nother hand, in order for the theory to be compatible with local gravity tests,\nthe fifth force due to the quasidilaton scalar needs to be screened at local\nscales. The present paper thus extends the theory by inclusion of a cubic\nHorndeski term in a way that (i) respects the quasidilaton global symmetry,\nthat (ii) maintains the physical degrees of freedom in the theory being three,\nthat (iii) can accommodate the Vainshtein screening mechanism and that still\n(iv) allows for a stable self-accelerating de Sitter solution. After adding the\nHorndeski term (and a k-essence type nonlinear kinetic term as well) to the\nprecursor action, we switch to the Hamiltonian language and find a complete set\nof independent constraints. We then construct the minimal theory with three\nphysical degrees of freedom by carefully adding a pair of constraints to the\ntotal Hamiltonian of the precursor theory. Switching back to the Lagrangian\nlanguage, we study cosmological solutions and their stability in the minimal\ntheory. In particular, we show that a self-accelerating de Sitter solution is\nstable for a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, as in the minimal theory of\nmassive gravity, the propagation speed of the massive gravitational waves in\nthe high momentum limit precisely agrees with the speed of light.\n", "  The microwave clock frequency of the $|5s~^2S_{1/2}, F=0,m_F=0 \\rangle\n\\leftrightarrow |5s~^2S_{1/2}, F=1,m_F=0 \\rangle$ transition in the\n$^{113}$Cd$^+$ ion has been reported as 15199862855.0192(10) Hz [Opt. Lett.\n{\\bf 40}, 4249 (2015)]. Fractional systematic due to the black-body radiation\n(BBR) shift ($\\beta$) arising from the Stark effect in the above clock\ntransition was used as $-1.1 \\times 10^{-16}$ from our unpublished preliminary\nestimation. We present here a precise value as $\\beta=-1.815(77) \\times\n10^{-16}$ by carrying out rigorous calculations of third-order polarizabilities\nof the hyperfine levels associated with the clock transition. This is\ndetermined by evaluating matrix elements of the magnetic dipole hyperfine\ninteraction Hamiltonian, electric dipole operator and energies between many\nlow-lying states of $^{113}$Cd$^+$. We employ all-order relativistic many-body\ntheories in the frameworks of Fock-space coupled-cluster and relativistic\nmulti-configuration Dirac-Fock methods.\n", "  The nearest stellar system consists of the stars Proxima, alpha Centauri A\nand B and at least one planet Proxima b. The habitability of Proxima b and any\nother planets are likely to be significantly influenced by the orbital\nevolution of the system. To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion. From 100 clones, we find that 74% orbits of Proxima Centauri are bound\nto alpha Centauri A and B while 17% and 9% orbits become unbound in the\nsimulations over the past and future 5 Gyr. If the system migrated outward in\nthe Milky Way to its current location, more than 50% of clones could become\nunstable in backward simulations. The ratio of unstable clones increases with\nthe simulation time scale and encounter rate. This provides some evidence for a\ncapture scenario for the formation of the current triple system. Despite large\nuncertainties, the metallicity difference between Proxima and alpha Centauri A\nand B is also suggestive of their different origin. Nonetheless, further\nimprovements in the available data and models will be necessary for a reliable\nassessment of the history of the Proxima-alpha Centauri system and its impact\non the habitability of Proxima b.\n", "  Optically detected magnetic resonance of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond\noffers novel routes to both DC and AC magnetometry in diamond anvil cells under\nhigh pressures ($>3$ GPa). However, a serious challenge to realizing\nexperiments has been the insertion of microwave radiation in to the sample\nspace without screening by the gasket material. We utilize designer anvils with\nlithographically-deposited metallic microchannels on the diamond culet as a\nmicrowave antenna. We detected the spin resonance of an ensemble of\nmicrodiamonds under pressure, and measure the pressure dependence of the zero\nfield splitting parameters. These experiments enable the possibility for\nall-optical magnetic resonance experiments on sub-$\\mu$L sample volumes at high\npressures.\n", "  We present an extensively updated version of the purely ray-tracing 3D dust\nradiation transfer code DART-Ray. The new version includes five major upgrades\n: 1) a series of optimizations for the ray-angular density and the scattered\nradiation source function; 2) the implementation of several data and task\nparallelizations using hybrid MPI+OpenMP schemes; 3) the inclusion of dust\nself-heating; 4) the ability to produce surface brightness maps for observers\nwithin the models in HEALPix format; 5) the possibility to set the expected\nnumerical accuracy already at the start of the calculation. We tested the\nupdated code with benchmark models where the dust self-heating is not\nnegligible. Furthermore, we performed a study of the extent of the source\ninfluence volumes, using galaxy models, which are critical in determining the\nefficiency of the DART-Ray algorithm. The new code is publicly available,\ndocumented for both users and developers, and accompanied by several programmes\nto create input grids for different model geometries and to import the results\nof N-body and SPH simulations. These programmes can be easily adapted to\ndifferent input geometries, and for different dust models or stellar emission\nlibraries.\n", "  We map the interstellar medium (ISM) including the diffuse interstellar bands\n(DIBs) in absorption toward the globular cluster NGC 6397 using VLT/MUSE. This\npilot study demonstrates the power of MUSE for mapping the local ISM on very\nsmall scales which provides a new window for ISM observations. Assuming the\nabsorbers are located at the rim of the Local Bubble we trace small-scale\nvariations in NaI and KI as well as in several DIBs structures on the order of\nmpc (milliparsec, a few thousand AU). The sightlines defined by binned stellar\nspectra are separated by only a few arcseconds and we probe the absorption\nwithin a physically connected region. This analysis utilized the fitting\nresiduals of individual stellar spectra of NGC 6397 member stars and analyzed\nlines from neutral species and several DIBs in Voronoi-binned composite spectra\nwith high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We verify the suitability of the MUSE 3D\nspectrograph for such measurements and gain new insights by probing a single\nphysical absorber with multiple sight lines.\n", "  The large majority of high energy sources detected with Fermi-LAT are\nblazars, which are known to be very variable sources. High cadence long-term\nmonitoring simultaneously at different wavelengths being prohibitive, the study\nof their transient activities can help shedding light on our understanding of\nthese objects. The early detection of such potentially fast transient events is\nthe key for triggering follow-up observations at other wavelengths. A Python\ntool, FLaapLUC, built on top of the Science Tools provided by the Fermi Science\nSupport Center and the Fermi-LAT collaboration, has been developed using a\nsimple aperture photometry approach. This tool can effectively detect relative\nflux variations in a set of predefined sources and alert potential users. Such\nalerts can then be used to trigger target of opportunity observations with\nother facilities. It is shown that FLaapLUC is an efficient tool to reveal\ntransient events in Fermi-LAT data, providing quick results which can be used\nto promptly organise follow-up observations. Results from this simple aperture\nphotometry method are also compared to full likelihood analyses. The FLaapLUC\npackage is made available on GitHub and is open to contributions by the\ncommunity.\n", "  The effect of AGN wind feedback on the accretion rate and mass evolution of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBH) is considered. It is shown, under reasonable\nassumptions, that the rate at which gas can be supplied to a SMBH at the center\nof a young galaxy, is limited to $\\sim 20 (\\sigma/350~ {\\rm km\n~s^{-1}})^4~M_\\odot/yr$ (where $\\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the host\nbulge) by interaction of winds expelled from the innermost regions of the\naccretion flow with the gas in the bulge. This rate is independent of the black\nhole mass but is sensitive to the properties of the host bulge. It is further\nargued that the interaction of the wind and the inflowing gas in the bulge can\nstrongly affect the structure of the accretion flow in the super-Eddington\nregime, potentially leading to highly super-Eddington accretion into the SMBH.\nAbout 300 Myr after the onset of the accretion phase, the AGN wind expels all\nthe gas from the bulge and the accretion rate is strongly suppressed. This\nscenario is in remarkable agreement with recent observations, as it (i) reveals\nthe origin of the maximal observed accretion rates, (ii) accounts for the\ninferred growth rate of SMBHs at high redshift (independent of their initial\nseeds masses), (iii) elucidates the decline in the accretion rate at lower\nredshifts, and (iv) explains the relation between $\\sigma$ and the mass\n$M_{BH}$ of the central SMBH, measured in the local Universe.\n", "  The anomalous features in diffraction patterns first observed by Wood over a\ncentury ago have been the subject of many investigations, both experimental and\ntheoretical. The sharp, narrow structures - and the large resonances with which\nthey are sometimes associated - arise in numerous studies in optics and\nphotonics. In this paper we present an analytical method to study diffracted\nfields of optically thin gratings that highlights the nonanalyticities\nassociated with the anomalies. Using this approach we can immediately derive\ndiffracted fields for any polarization in a compact notation. While our\nequations are approximate, they fully respect energy conservation in the\nelectromagnetic field, and describe the large exchanges of energy between\nincident and diffracted fields that can arise even for thin gratings.\n", "  We study properties of asymptotically free vectorial gauge theories with\ngauge groups $G={\\rm SO}(N_c)$ and $G={\\rm Sp}(N_c)$ and $N_f$ fermions in a\nrepresentation $R$ of $G$, at an infrared (IR) zero of the beta function,\n$\\alpha_{IR}$, in the non-Abelian Coulomb phase. The fundamental, adjoint, and\nrank-2 symmetric and antisymmetric tensor fermion representations are\nconsidered. We present scheme-independent calculations of the anomalous\ndimensions of (gauge-invariant) fermion bilinear operators\n$\\gamma_{\\bar\\psi\\psi,IR}$ to $O(\\Delta_f^4)$ and of the derivative of the beta\nfunction at $\\alpha_{IR}$, denoted $\\beta'_{IR}$, to $O(\\Delta_f^5)$, where\n$\\Delta_f$ is an $N_f$-dependent expansion variable. It is shown that all\ncoefficients in the expansion of $\\gamma_{\\bar\\psi\\psi,IR}$ that we calculate\nare positive for all representations considered, so that to $O(\\Delta_f^4)$,\n$\\gamma_{\\bar\\psi\\psi,IR}$ increases monotonically with decreasing $N_f$ in the\nnon-Abelian Coulomb phase. Using this property, we give a new estimate of the\nlower end of this phase for some specific realizations of these theories.\n", "  We review the evidence for buried ice in the asteroid belt; specifically the\nquestions around the so-called Main Belt Comets (MBCs). We summarise the\nevidence for water throughout the Solar System, and describe the various\nmethods for detecting it, including remote sensing from ultraviolet to radio\nwavelengths. We review progress in the first decade of study of MBCs, including\nobservations, modelling of ice survival, and discussion on their origins. We\nthen look at which methods will likely be most effective for further progress,\nincluding the key challenge of direct detection of (escaping) water in these\nbodies.\n", "  We present optical polarimetry in the period May-August 2017 of the enigmatic\n\"dipping\" star KIC 8462852. During that period three ~1% photometric dips were\nreported by other observers. We measured the average absolute polarization of\nthe source, and find no excess or unusual polarization compared to a nearby\ncomparison star. We place tight upper limits on any change in the degree of\npolarization of the source between epochs in- and out-of-dip of <0.1%\n(8500-Ang.) and <0.2% (7050-Ang. and 5300-Ang.). How our limits are interpreted\ndepends on the specific model being considered. If the whole stellar disk were\ncovered by material with an optical depth of ~0.01 then the fractional\npolarisation introduced by this material must be less than 10-20%. While our\nnon-detection does not constrain the comet scenario, it predicts that even\nmodest amounts of dust that have properties similar to Solar System comets may\nbe detectable. We note that the sensitivity of our method scales with the depth\nof the dip. Should a future ~20% photometric dip be observed (as was previously\ndetected by Kepler) our method would constrain any induced polarization\nassociated with any occulting material to 0.5-1.0%.\n", "  Spherically symmetric bosonic stars are one of the few examples of\ngravitating solitons that are known to form dynamically, via a classical\nprocess of (incomplete) gravitational collapse. As stationary solutions of the\nEinstein--Klein-Gordon or the Einstein--Proca theory, bosonic stars may also\nbecome sufficiently compact to develop light rings and hence mimic, in\nprinciple, gravitational-wave observational signatures of black holes (BHs). In\nthis paper, we discuss how these horizonless ultra-compact objects (UCOs) are\nactually distinct from BHs, both phenomenologically and dynamically. In the\nelectromagnetic channel, the light ring associated phenomenology reveals\nremarkable lensing patterns, quite distinct from a standard BH shadow, with an\ninfinite number of Einstein rings accumulating in the vicinity of the light\nring, both inside and outside the latter. The strong lensing region, moreover,\ncan be considerably smaller than the shadow of a BH with a comparable mass.\nDynamically, we investigate the fate of such UCOs under perturbations, via\nfully non-linear numerical simulations and observe that, in all cases, they\ndecay into a Schwarzschild BH within a time scale of $\\mathcal{O}(M)$, where\n$M$ is the mass of the bosonic star. Both these studies reinforce how difficult\nit is for horizonless UCOs to mimic BH phenomenology and dynamics, in all its\naspects.\n", "  The security of conventional cryptography systems is threatened in the\nforthcoming era of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) features\nfundamentally proven security and offers a promising option for quantum-proof\ncryptography solution. Although prototype QKD systems over optical fiber have\nbeen demonstrated over the years, the key generation rates remain several\norders-of-magnitude lower than current classical communication systems. In an\neffort towards a commercially viable QKD system with improved key generation\nrates, we developed a discrete-variable QKD system based on time-bin quantum\nphotonic states that is capable of generating provably-secure cryptographic\nkeys at megabit-per-second (Mbps) rates over metropolitan distances. We use\nhigh-dimensional quantum states that transmit more than one secret bit per\nreceived photon, alleviating detector saturation effects in the superconducting\nnanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) employed in our system that feature\nvery high detection efficiency (of over 70%) and low timing jitter (of less\nthan 40 ps). Our system is constructed using commercial off-the-shelf\ncomponents, and the adopted protocol can readily be extended to free-space\nquantum channels. The security analysis adopted to distill the keys ensures\nthat the demonstrated protocol is robust against coherent attacks, finite-size\neffects, and a broad class of experimental imperfections identified in our\nsystem.\n", "  The nonlocal transport of thermally generated magnons not only unveils the\nunderlying mechanism of the spin Seebeck effect, but also allows for the\nextraction of the magnon relaxation length ($\\lambda_m$) in a magnetic\nmaterial, the average distance over which thermal magnons can propagate. In\nthis study, we experimentally explore in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/platinum\nsystems much further ranges compared with previous investigations. We observe\nthat the nonlocal SSE signals at long distances ($d$) clearly deviate from a\ntypical exponential decay. Instead, they can be dominated by the nonlocal\ngeneration of magnon accumulation as a result of the temperature gradient\npresent away from the heater, and decay geometrically as $1/d^2$. We emphasize\nthe importance of looking only into the exponential regime (i.e., the\nintermediate distance regime) to extract $\\lambda_m$. With this principle, we\nstudy $\\lambda_m$ as a function of temperature in two YIG films which are 2.7\nand 50 $\\mu$m in thickness, respectively. We find $\\lambda_m$ to be around 15\n$\\mu$m at room temperature and it increases to 40 $\\mu$m at $T=$ 3.5 K. Finite\nelement modeling results agree with experimental studies qualitatively, showing\nalso a geometrical decay beyond the exponential regime. Based on both\nexperimental and modeling results we put forward a general guideline for\nextracting $\\lambda_m$ from the nonlocal spin Seebeck effect.\n", "  Using few-body simulations, we investigate the evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in galaxies ($M_{\\star}=10^{10}-10^{12}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at\n$z=0$) at $0<z<4$. Following galaxy merger trees from the Millennium\nsimulation, we model BH mergers with two extreme binary decay scenarios for the\n`hard binary' stage: a full or an empty loss cone. These two models should\nbracket the true evolution, and allow us to separately explore the role of\ndynamical friction and that of multi-body BH interactions on BH mergers. Using\nthe computed merger rates, we infer the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB). Our dynamical approach is a first attempt to study the\ndynamical evolution of multiple SMBHs in the host galaxies undergoing mergers\nwith various mass ratios ($10^{-4} < q_{\\star} < 1$). Our main result\ndemonstrates that SMBH binaries are able to merge in both scenarios. In the\nempty loss cone case, we find that BHs merge via multi-body interactions,\navoiding the `final parsec' problem, and entering the PTA band with substantial\norbital eccentricity. Our full loss cone treatment, albeit more approximate,\nsuggests that the eccentricity becomes even higher when GWs become dominant,\nleading to rapid coalescences (binary lifetime $\\lesssim1 {\\rm ~Gyr}$). Despite\nthe lower merger rates in the empty loss cone case, due to their higher mass\nratios and lower redshifts, the GWB in the full/empty loss cone models are\ncomparable ($0.70\\times10^{-15}$ and $0.53\\times10^{-15}$ at a frequency of\n$1~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, respectively). Finally, we compute the effects of high\neccentricities on the GWB spectrum.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the relations between gas kinematics,\nmetallicity, and stellar mass in a sample of 82 GRB-selected galaxies using\nabsorption and emission methods. We find the velocity widths of both emission\nand absorption profiles to be a proxy of stellar mass. We also investigate the\nvelocity-metallicity correlation and its evolution with redshift and find the\ncorrelation derived from emission lines to have a significantly smaller scatter\ncompared to that found using absorption lines. Using 33 GRB hosts with measured\nstellar mass and metallicitiy, we study the mass-metallicity relation for GRB\nhost galaxies in a stellar mass range of $10^{8.2} M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.1}\nM_{\\odot}$ and a redshift range of $ z\\sim 0.3-3.4$. The GRB-selected galaxies\nappear to track the mass-metallicity relation of star forming galaxies but with\nan offset of 0.15 towards lower metallicities. This offset is comparable with\nthe average error-bar on the metallicity measurements of the GRB sample and\nalso the scatter on the MZ relation of the general population. It is hard to\ndecide whether this relatively small offset is due to systematic effects or the\nintrinsic nature of GRB hosts. We also investigate the possibility of using\nabsorption-line metallicity measurements of GRB hosts to study the\nmass-metallicity relation at high redshifts. Our analysis shows that the\nmetallicity measurements from absorption methods can significantly differ from\nemission metallicities and assuming identical measurements from the two methods\nmay result in erroneous conclusions.\n", "  Schwarzschild orbit-based dynamical models are widely used to uncover the\ninternal dynamics of early-type galaxies and globular clusters. Here we present\nfor the first time the Schwarzschild models of late-type galaxies: an SBb\ngalaxy NGC 4210 and an S0 galaxy NGC 6278 from the CALIFA survey. The mass\nprofiles within $2\\,R_e$ are constrained well with $1\\sigma$ statistical error\nof $\\sim 10\\%$. The luminous and dark mass can be disentangled with\nuncertainties of $\\sim 20\\%$ and $\\sim 50\\%$ respectively. From $R_e$ to\n$2\\,R_e$, the dark matter fraction increases from $14\\pm10\\%$ to $18\\pm10\\%$\nfor NGC 4210 and from $15\\pm10\\%$ to $30\\pm20\\%$ for NGC 6278. The velocity\nanisotropy profiles of both $\\sigma_r/\\sigma_t$ and $\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R$ are\nwell constrained. The inferred internal orbital distributions reveal clear\nsubstructures. The orbits are naturally separated into three components: a cold\ncomponent with near circular orbits, a hot component with near radial orbits,\nand a warm component in between. The photometrically-identified exponential\ndisks are predominantly made up of cold orbits only beyond $\\sim 1\\,R_e$, while\nthey are constructed mainly with the warm orbits inside. Our dynamical hot\ncomponents are concentrated in the inner regions, similar to the\nphotometrically-identified bulges. The reliability of the results, especially\nthe orbit distribution, are verified by applying the model to mock data.\n", "  This work is part of a series of papers devoted to investigate the evolution\nof cluster galaxies during their infall. In the present article we imaged in\nNIR a selected sample of galaxies through- out the massive cluster Abell 85 (z\n= 0.055). We obtained (JHK) photometry for 68 objects, reaching 1 mag/arcsec^2\ndeeper than 2MASS. We use these images to unveil asymmetries in the outskirts\nof a sample of bright galaxies and develop a new asymmetry index, alpha_An,\nwhich allows to quantify the degree of disruption by the relative area occupied\nby the tidal features on the plane of the sky. We measure the asymmetries for a\nsubsample of 41 large area objects finding clear asymmetries in ten galaxies,\nmost of them being in groups and pairs projected at different clustercentric\ndistances, some of them located beyond R500 . Combining information on the\nHi-gas content of blue galaxies and the distribution of sub-structures across\nAbell 85, with the present NIR asymmetry analysis, we obtain a very powerful\ntool to confirm that tidal mechanisms are indeed present and are currently\naffecting a fraction of galaxies in Abell 85. However, when comparing our deep\nNIR images with UV-blue images of two very disrupted (jellyfish) galaxies in\nthis cluster, we discard the presence of tidal 1 interactions down to our\ndetection limit. Our results suggest that ram-pressure stripping is at the\norigin of such spectacular disruptions. We conclude that across a complex\ncluster like Abell 85, environment mechanisms, both gravitational and\nhydrodynamical, are playing an active role in driving galaxy evolution.\n", "  We use the new catalogue by Laigle et al. (2016) to provide a full census of\nVLA-COSMOS radio sources. We identify 90% of such sources and sub-divide them\ninto AGN and star-forming galaxies on the basis of their radio luminosity. The\nAGN sample is COMPLETE with respect to radio selection at all z<3.5. Out of 704\nAGN, 272 have a counterpart in the Herschel maps. By exploiting the better\nstatistics of the new sample, we confirm the results of Magliocchetti et al.\n(2014): the probability for a radio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR\nwavelengths is both a function of radio luminosity and redshift, whereby\npowerful sources are more likely FIR emitters at earlier epochs. Such an\nemission is due to star-forming processes within the host galaxy. FIR emitters\nand non-FIR emitters only differentiate in the z<1 universe. At higher\nredshifts they are indistinguishable from each other, as there is no difference\nbetween FIR-emitting AGN and star-forming galaxies. Lastly, we focus on radio\nAGN which show AGN emission at other wavelengths. We find that MIR emission is\nmainly associated with ongoing star-formation and with sources which are\nsmaller, younger and more radio luminous than the average parent population.\nX-ray emitters instead preferentially appear in more massive and older\ngalaxies. We can therefore envisage an evolutionary track whereby the first\nphase of a radio-active AGN and of its host galaxy is associated with MIR\nemission, while at later stages the source becomes only active at radio\nwavelengths and possibly also in the X-ray.\n", "  Motivated by the observational evidence of inhomogeneous clouds in\nexoplanetary atmospheres, we investigate how proposed simple cloud\ndistributions can affect atmospheric circulations and infrared emission. We\nsimulated temperatures and winds for the hot Jupiter Kepler-7b using a\nthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation model that included a simplified\naerosol radiative transfer model. We prescribed fixed cloud distributions and\nscattering properties based on results previously inferred from Kepler-7b\noptical phase curves, including inhomogeneous aerosols centered along the\nwestern terminator and hypothetical cases in which aerosols additionally\nextended across much of the planet's night side. In all cases, a strong jet\ncapable of advecting aerosols from a cooler nightside to dayside was found to\npersist, but only at the equator. Colder temperatures at mid- and\npolar-latitudes might permit aerosol to form on the dayside without the need\nfor advection. By altering the deposition and redistribution of heat, aerosols\nalong the western terminator produced an asymmetric heating that effectively\nshifts the hottest spot further east of the sub-stellar point than expected for\na uniform distribution. The addition of opaque high clouds on the nightside can\npartly mitigate this enhanced shift by retaining heat that contributes to\nwarming west of the hotspot. These expected differences in infrared phase\ncurves could place constraints on proposed cloud distributions and their\ninfrared opacities for brighter hot Jupiters.\n", "  Previous studies of the chemically peculiar Bp star 36 Lyn revealed a\nmoderately strong magnetic field, circumstellar material, and inhomogeneous\nsurface abundance distributions of certain elements. We present in this paper\nan analysis of 33 high-signal-to-noise ratio, high-resolution Stokes IV\nobservations of 36 Lyn obtained with the Narval spectropolarimeter at the\nBernard Lyot telescope at Pic du Midi Observatory. From these data, we compute\nnew measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic field, Bl, using the\nmulti-line least-squares deconvolution (LSD) technique. A rotationally phased\nBl curve reveals a strong magnetic field, with indications for deviation from a\npure dipole field. We derive magnetic maps and chemical abundance distributions\nfrom the LSD profiles, produced using the Zeeman Doppler Imaging code\nInversLSD. Using a spherical harmonic expansion to characterize the magnetic\nfield, we find that the harmonic energy is concentrated predominantly in the\ndipole mode (l = 1), with significant contribution from both the poloidal and\ntoroidal components. This toroidal field component is predicted theoretically,\nbut not typically observed for Ap/Bp stars. Chemical abundance maps reveal a\nhelium enhancement in a distinct region where the radial magnetic field is\nstrong. Silicon enhancements are located in two regions, also where the radial\nfield is stronger. Titanium and iron enhancements are slightly offset from the\nhelium enhancements, and are located in areas where the radial field is weak,\nclose to the magnetic equator.\n", "  In the framework of the STREGA (STRucture and Evolution of the GAlaxy)\nsurvey, two fields around the globular cluster Pal 12 were observed with the\naim of detecting the possible presence of streams and/or an extended halo. The\nadopted stellar tracers are the Main Sequence, Turn-off and Red Giant Branch\nstars. We discuss the lumi- nosity function and the star counts in the observed\nregion covering about 2 tidal radii, confirming that Pal 12 appears to be\nembedded in the Sagittarius Stream. Adopting an original approach to separate\ncluster and field stars, we do not find any evidence of sig- nificant\nextra-tidal Pal 12 stellar populations. The presence of the Sagittarius stream\nseems to have mimicked a larger tidal radius in previous studies. Indeed,\nadopting a King model, a redetermination of this value gives r_T = 0.22 +- 0.1\ndeg.\n", "  Whether is ground-based or space-based, any optical instrument suffers from\nsome amount of optical geometric distortion. Recently, the diffraction-limited\nimage quality afforded by space-based telescopes and by Adaptive Optics (AO)\ncorrected instruments on ground based-telescope, have increased the relative\nimportance of the error terms induced by optical distortions. In particular,\nvariable distortions present in Multi-Conjugated Adaptive Optics (MCAO) data\nare limiting the astrometry and photometry accuracy of such high resolution\ninstruments. From there, the ability to deal with those phenomenon had become a\ncritical issue for high-precision studies. We present in this paper an optimal\nmethod of distortion correction for high angular resolution images. Based on a\nprior-knowledge of the static distortion the method aims to correct the\ndynamical distortions specifically for each observation set and each frame. The\nmethod follows an inverse problem approach based on the work done by Gratadour\net al. 2005 on image re-centering, and we aim to generalized it to any kind of\ndistortion mode. The complete formalism of a Weighted Least Square\nminimization, as well as a detailed characterization of the error budget are\npresented. In particular we study the influence of different parameters such as\nthe number of frames and the density of the field (sparse or crowed images), of\nthe noise level, and of the aliasing effect. Finally, we show the first\napplication of the method on real observations collected with the Gemini MCAO\ninstrument, GeMS/GSAOI. The performance as well as the gain brought by this\nmethod are presented.\n", "  We have developed a model atom for Cu with which we perform statistical\nequilibrium computations that allow us to compute the line formation of Cu I\nlines in stellar atmospheres without assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium\n(LTE). We validate this model atom by reproducing the observed line profiles of\nthe Sun, Procyon and eleven metal-poor stars. Our sample of stars includes both\ndwarfs and giants. Over a wide range of stellar parameters we obtain excellent\nagreement among different Cu I lines. The eleven metal-poor stars have iron\nabundances in the range -4.2 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.4, the weighted mean of the\n[Cu/Fe] ratios is -0.22 dex, with a scatter of -0.15 dex. This is very\ndifferent from the results from LTE analysis (the difference between NLTE and\nLTE abundances reaches 1 dex) and in spite of the small size of our sample it\nprompts for a revision of the Galactic evolution of Cu.\n", "  Motivated by the existence of the relationship between the dynamical state of\nclusters and the shape of the velocity dispersion profiles (VDP), we study the\nVDPs for Gaussian (G) and Non-Gaussian (NG) systems for a subsample of clusters\nfrom the Yang catalog. The groups cover a redshift interval of $0.03\\leq\nz\\leq0.1$ with halo mass $\\geq 10^{14}$M$_{\\odot}$. We use a robust statistical\nmethod, Hellinger Distance, to classify the dynamical state of the systems\naccording to their velocity distribution. The stacked VDP of each class, G and\nNG, is then determined using either Bright or Faint galaxies. The stacked VDP\nfor G groups displays a central peak followed by a monotonically decreasing\ntrend which indicates a predominance of radial orbits, with the Bright stacked\nVDP showing lower velocity dispersions in all radii. The distinct features we\nfind in NG systems are manifested not only by the characteristic shape of VDP,\nwith a depression in the central region, but also by a possible higher infall\nrate associated with galaxies in the Faint stacked VDP.\n", "  We present high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the\nspectroscopic binary Chi Dra. Spectral lines in the spectrum of the main\ncomponent Chi Dra A show variable Zeeman displacement, which confrms earlier\nsuggestions about the presence of a weak magnetic field on the surface of this\nstar. Within about 2 years of time base of our observations, the longitudinal\ncomponent BL of the magnetic field exhibits variation from -11.5 +/- 2.5 G to\n+11.1 +/- 2.1 G with a period of about 23 days. Considering the rotational\nvelocity of Chi DraA in the literature and that newly measured in this work,\nthis variability may be explained by the stellar rotation under the assumption\nthat the magnetic field is globally stable. Our new measurements of the radial\nvelocities (RV) in high-resolution I-spectra of Chi Dra A refined the orbital\nparameters and reveal persistent deviations of RVs from the orbital curve. We\nsuspect that these deviations may be due to the in uence of local magnetically\ngenerated spots, pulsations, or a Jupiter-size planet orbiting the system.\n", "  We conducted an SiO maser survey towards 221 O-rich AGB stars with the aim of\nidentifying maser emission associated with the Sagittarius stellar stream. In\nthis survey, maser emission was detected in 44 targets, of which 35 were new\ndetections. All of these masers are within 5 kpc of the Sun. We also compiled a\nGalactic SiO maser catalogue including ~2300 SiO masers from the literature.\nThe distribution of these SiO masers give a scale height of 0.40 kpc, while 42\nsources deviate from the Galactic plane by more than 1.2 kpc, half of which\nwere found in this survey. Regarding SiO masers in the disc, we found both the\nrotational speeds and the velocity dispersions vary with the Galactic plane\ndistance. Assuming Galactic rotational speed $\\Theta$0 = 240 km/s , we derived\nthe velocity lags are 15 km/s and 55 km/s for disc and off-plane SiO masers\nrespectively. Moreover, we identified three groups with significant peculiar\nmotions (with 70% confidence). The most significant group is in the thick disc\nthat might trace stream/peculiar motion of the Perseus arm. The other two\ngroups are mainly made up of off-plane sources. The northern and southern\noff-plane sources were found to be moving at ~33 km/s and 54 km/s away from the\nGalactic plane, respectively. Causes of these peculiar motions are still\nunclear. For the two off-plane groups, we suspect they are thick disc stars\nwhose kinematics affected by the Sgr stellar stream or very old Sgr stream\ndebris.\n", "  Studying the physical conditions structuring the young circumstellar disks is\nrequired for understanding the onset of planet formation. Of particular\ninterest is the protoplanetary disk surrounding the Herbig star MWC480. The\nstructure and properties of the circumstellar disk of MWC480 are studied by\ninfrared interferometry and interpreted from a modeling approach. New\nobservations are driving this study, in particular some recent Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer (VLTI)/MIDI data acquired in December 2013. Our\none-component disk model could not reproduce simultaneously all our data: the\nSpectral Energy Distribution, the near-infrared Keck Interferometer data and\nthe mid-infrared data obtained with the MIDI instrument. In order to explain\nall measurements, one possibility is to add an asymmetry in our one-component\ndisk model with the assumption that the structure of the disk of MWC480 has not\nvaried with time. Several scenarios are tested, and the one considering the\npresence of an azimuthal bright feature in the inner component of the disk\nmodel provides a better fit of the data. (In this study, we assumed that the\nsize of the outer disk of MWC480 to be 20 au since most of the near and mid-IR\nemissions come from below 20 au. In our previous study (Jamialahmadi et al.\n2015), we adopted an outer radius of 80 au, which is consistent with the value\nfound by previous studies based on mm observations).\n", "  We report the observation of magnetic-field-induced suppression of the spin\nPeltier effect (SPE) in a junction of a paramagnetic metal Pt and a\nferrimagnetic insulator ${\\rm Y_{3}Fe_{5}O_{12}}$ (YIG) at room temperature.\nFor driving the SPE, spin currents are generated via the spin Hall effect from\napplied charge currents in the Pt layer, and injected into the adjacent thick\nYIG film. The resultant temperature modulation is detected by a commonly-used\nthermocouple attached to the Pt/YIG junction. The output of the thermocouple\nshows sign reversal when the magnetization is reversed and linearly increases\nwith the applied current, demonstrating the detection of the SPE signal. We\nfound that the SPE signal decreases with the magnetic field. The observed\nsuppression rate was found to be comparable to that of the spin Seebeck effect\n(SSE), suggesting the dominant and similar contribution of the low-energy\nmagnons in the SPE as in the SSE.\n", "  We present results from the analysis of 2997 fundamental mode RR Lyrae\nvariables located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). For these objects\nnear-infrared time-series photometry from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic\nClouds system (VMC) and visual light curves from the OGLE IV survey are\navailable. In this study the multi-epoch $K_{\\rm s}$-band VMC photometry was\nused for the first time to derive intensity-averaged magnitudes of the SMC RR\nLyrae stars. We determined individual distances to the RR Lyrae stars from the\nnear-infrared period-absolute magnitude-metallicity ($PM_{K_{\\rm s}}Z$)\nrelation, which has a number of advantages in comparison with the visual\nabsolute magnitude-metallicity ($M_{V}-{\\rm [Fe/H]}$) relation, such as a\nsmaller dependence of the luminosity on interstellar extinction, evolutionary\neffects and metallicity. The distances we have obtained were used to study the\nthree-dimensional structure of the SMC. The distribution of the SMC RR Lyrae\nstars is found to be ellipsoidal. The actual line-of-sight depth of the SMC is\nin the range from 1 to 10 kpc, with an average depth of 4.3 $\\pm$ 1.0 kpc. We\nfound that RR Lyrae stars in the eastern part of the SMC are affected by\ninteractions of the Magellanic Clouds. However, we do not see a clear\nbimodality in the distribution of RR Lyrae stars as observed for red clump (RC)\nstars.\n", "  I have used a sample of long Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) common to both\n\\emph{Swift} and \\emph{Fermi} to re-derive the parameters of the Yonetoku\ncorrelation. This allowed me to self-consistently estimate pseudo redshifts of\nall the bursts with unknown redshifts. This is the first time such a large\nsample of GRBs from these two instruments are used, both individually and in\nconjunction, to model the long GRB luminosity function. The GRB formation rate\nis modelled as the product of the cosmic star formation rate and a GRB\nformation efficiency for a given stellar mass. An exponential cut-off powerlaw\nluminosity function fits the data reasonably well, with $\\nu = 0.6$ and $ L_b =\n5.4 \\times10^{52} \\, \\rm{erg.s^{-1}},$ and does not require a cosmological\nevolution. In the case of a broken powerlaw, it is required to incorporate a\nsharp evolution of the break given by\n$L_{b}\\sim0.3\\times10^{52}\\left(1+z\\right)^{2.90} \\, \\rm{erg.s^{-1}},$ and the\nGRB formation efficiency (degenerate up to a beaming factor of GRBs) decreases\nwith redshift as $\\propto\\left(1+z\\right)^{-0.80}.$ However it is not possible\nto distinguish between the two models. The derived models are then used as\ntemplates to predict the distribution of GRBs detectable by CZTI on board\n\\emph{AstroSat}, as a function of redshift and luminosity. This demonstrates\nthat via a quick localization and redshift measurement of even a few CZTI GRBs,\n\\emph{AstroSat} will help in improving the statistics of GRBs both typical and\npeculiar.\n", "  In this work we explore the evolution of magnetic fields inside strongly\nmagnetized neutron stars in axisymmetry. We model numerically the coupled field\nevolution in the core and the crust. Our code models the Hall drift and Ohmic\neffects in the crust, the back-reaction on the field from magnetically-induced\nelastic deformation of the crust, the magnetic twist exchange between the crust\nand the core, and the drift of superconducting flux tubes inside the core. The\ncorrect hydromagnetic equilibrium is enforced in the core. We find that i) The\nHall attractor found by Gourgouliatos and Cumming in the crust exists also for\nconfigurations when the B-field penetrates into the core. However, the\nevolution timescale for the core-penetrating fields is dramatically different\nthan that of the fields confined to the crust. ii) The combination of Jones'\nflux tube drift and Ohmic dissipation in the crust can deplete the pulsar\nmagnetic fields on the timescale of $150$ Myr if the crust is hot\n($T\\sim2\\times10^8$ K), but acts on much slower timescales for cold neutron\nstars, such as recycled pulsars ($\\sim 1.8 $ Gyr, depending on impurity\nlevels). iii) The outward motion of superfluid vortices during the rapid\nspin-down of a young highly magnetized pulsar, can result in a partial\nexpulsion of flux from the core when $B\\lesssim 10^{13}$ G. However for\n$B\\gtrsim2\\times 10^{13}$ G, the combination of a stronger magnetic field and a\nlonger spin period implies that the core field cannot be expelled.\n", "  Do the theorised different formation mechanisms of fast and slow rotators\nproduce an observable difference in their star formation histories? To study\nthis we identify quenching slow rotators in the MaNGA sample by selecting those\nwhich lie below the star forming sequence and identify a sample of quenching\nfast rotators which were matched in stellar mass. This results in a total\nsample of 194 kinematically classified galaxies, which is agnostic to visual\nmorphology. We use u-r and NUV-u colours from SDSS and GALEX and an existing\ninference package, STARPY, to conduct a first look at the onset time and\nexponentially declining rate of quenching of these galaxies. An\nAnderson-Darling test on the distribution of the inferred quenching rates\nacross the two kinematic populations reveals they are statistically\ndistinguishable ($3.2\\sigma$). We find that fast rotators quench at a much\nwider range of rates than slow rotators, consistent with a wide variety of\nphysical processes such as secular evolution, minor mergers, gas accretion and\nenvironmentally driven mechanisms. Quenching is more likely to occur at rapid\nrates ($\\tau \\lesssim 1~\\rm{Gyr}$) for slow rotators, in agreement with\ntheories suggesting slow rotators are formed in dynamically fast processes,\nsuch as major mergers. Interestingly, we also find that a subset of the fast\nrotators quench at these same rapid rates as the bulk of the slow rotator\nsample. We therefore discuss how the total gas mass of a merger, rather than\nthe merger mass ratio, may decide a galaxy's ultimate kinematic fate.\n", "  We present a study of photometric redshift performance for galaxies and\nactive galactic nuclei detected in deep radio continuum surveys. Using two\nmulti-wavelength datasets, over the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey Bo\\\"otes and\nCOSMOS fields, we assess photometric redshift (photo-z) performance for a\nsample of $\\sim 4,500$ radio continuum sources with spectroscopic redshifts\nrelative to those of $\\sim 63,000$ non radio-detected sources in the same\nfields. We investigate the performance of three photometric redshift template\nsets as a function of redshift, radio luminosity and infrared/X-ray properties.\nWe find that no single template library is able to provide the best performance\nacross all subsets of the radio detected population, with variation in the\noptimum template set both between subsets and between fields. Through a\nhierarchical Bayesian combination of the photo-z estimates from all three\ntemplate sets, we are able to produce a consensus photo-z estimate which equals\nor improves upon the performance of any individual template set.\n", "  There is a close connection between various new phenomena in Weyl semimetals\nand the existence of linear band crossings in the single particle description.\nWe show, by a full self-consistent mean-field calculation, how this picture is\nmodified in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The chiral\nsymmetry breaking occurs at strong enough interactions and the internode\ninterband excitonic pairing channel is found to be significant, which\ndetermines the gap-opened band profile varying with interaction strength.\nRemarkably, in the resultant interacting phase, finite band Chern number jumps\nin the three-dimensional momentum space are retained, indicating the robustness\nof the topologically nontrivial features.\n", "  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Galactic Center has to date only been\nfully mapped at mm wavelengths with singledish telescopes, with resolution\nabout 30$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (1.2 pc). Using CARMA, we mapped the innermost 0.25\nsquare degrees of the CMZ over the region between -0$.\\kern-.25em ^{^\\circ}$2$\n\\leq l \\leq $0$.\\kern-.25em ^{^\\circ}$5 and -0$.\\kern-.25em ^{^\\circ}$2$ \\leq b\n\\leq $0$.\\kern-.25em ^{^\\circ}$2 (90$\\times$50 pc) with spatial and spectral\nresolution of $\\sim$10$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (0.4 pc) and $\\sim$2.5 km/s,\nrespectively. We provide a catalog of 3mm continuum sources as well as spectral\nline images of SiO(J=2-1), HCO$^{+}$(J=1-0), HCN(J=1-0), N$_{2}$H$^{+}$(J=1-0),\nand CS(J=2-1), with velocity coverage VLSR= -200 to 200 km/s. To recover the\nlarge scale structure resolved out by the interferometer, the\ncontinuum-subtracted spectral line images were combined with data from the\nMopra 22-m telescope survey, thus providing maps containing all spatial\nfrequencies down to the resolution limit. We find that integrated intensity\nratio of I(HCN)/I(HCO$^{+}$) is anti-correlated with the intensity of the 6.4\nkeV Fe K$\\alpha$, which is excited either by high energy photons or low energy\ncosmic rays, and the gas velocity dispersion as traced by HCO$^{+}$ is\ncorrelated with Fe K$\\alpha$ intensity. The intensity ratio and velocity\ndispersion patterns are consistent with variation expected from the interaction\nof low energy cosmic rays with molecular gas.\n", "  Detection of transiting exoplanets around young stars is more difficult than\nfor older systems due to increased stellar variability. Nine young open cluster\nplanets have been found in the K2 data, but no single analysis pipeline\nidentified all planets. We have developed a transit search pipeline for young\nstars which uses a transit-shaped notch and quadratic continuum in a 12 or\n24\\,hour window to fit both the stellar variability and the presence of a\ntransit. In addition, for the most rapid rotators (P$_\\mathrm{rot}<2$\\,days) we\nmodel the variability using a linear combination of observed rotations of each\nstar. To maximally exploit our new pipeline, we update the membership for four\nstellar populations observed by K2 (Upper Scorpius, Pleiades, Hyades,\nPraesepe), and conduct a uniform search of the members. We identify all known\ntransiting exoplanets in the clusters, 17 eclipsing binaries, one transiting\nplanet candidate orbiting a potential Pleiades member, and three orbiting\nunlikely members of the young clusters. Limited injection-recovery testing on\nthe known planet hosts indicates that for the older Praesepe systems, we are\nsensitive to additional exoplanets as small as 1-2\\,R$_\\oplus$, and for the\nlarger Upper Scorpius planet host (K2-33) our pipeline is sensitive to\n$\\sim$4\\,R$_\\oplus$ transiting planets. The lack of detected multiple systems\nin the young clusters is consistent with the expected frequency from the\noriginal Kepler sample, within our detection limits. With a robust pipeline\nthat detects all known planets in the young clusters, occurrence rate testing\nat young ages is now possible.\n", "  We investigate the validity of two common assumptions in the modelling of\nsuperconducting circuits: first, that the superconducting qubits are pointlike,\nand second, that the UV behaviour of the transmission line is not relevant to\nthe qubit dynamics. We show that in the experimentally accessible ultra-strong\ncoupling regime and for short (but attainable) times, the use of an inaccurate\ncutoff model (such as sharp, or none at all) could introduce very significant\ninaccuracies in the model's predictions.\n", "  Neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) around a rotating stellar-mass black\nhole (BH) is one of the plausible candidates for the central engines of\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Because the time-variant and anisotropic emission of\nneutrinos from NDAFs leads to GRB variability, NDAFs can be regarded as the\nsources of the strong gravitational waves (GWs). We calculate the dependences\nof the GW strains on both the BH spin and the accretion rate. We demonstrate\nthat for typical GRBs with either single pulse or multiple pulses, the GWs from\nNDAFs might be detected at a distance of $\\sim 100$ kpc/$\\sim 1$ Mpc by\nadvanced LIGO/Einstein Telescope with a typical frequency of $\\sim 10-100$ Hz.\nBesides NDAFs, the other two competitive candidates for GRB central engine are\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism and millisecond magnetars. We explore the GW\nsignals from these two as well, and compare the corresponding results with\nNDAFs'. We find that for a certain GRB, the possible detected distance from\nNDAFs is about two orders of magnitude higher than that from BZ mechanism, but\nat least two orders of magnitude lower than that from magnetars. The typical GW\nfrequency for BZ mechanism is the same with that of NDAFs, $\\sim 10-100$ Hz,\nwhile the typical frequency for magnetars is $\\sim 2000$ Hz. Therefore, the GWs\nreleased by the central engines of adjacent GRBs might be used to determine\nwhether there is an NDAF, a BZ jet or a magnetar in GRB center.\n", "  Energetic particles with energies from tens of keV to a few hundreds keV are\nfrequently observed in the Earth's magnetotail. Here we study, by means of a\ntest particle numerical simulation, the acceleration of different ion species\n(H$^{+}$, He$^{+}$, He$^{++}$, and O$^{n+}$ with $n=1$--$6$) in the presence of\ntransient electromagnetic perturbations. All the considered ions develop\npower-law tails at high energies, except for O$^+$ ions. This is strongly\ncorrelated to the time that the particle spend in the current sheet. Ion\nacceleration is found to be proportional to the charge state, while it grows in\na weaker way with the ion mass. We find that O$^{5+/6+}$ can reach energies\nhigher than $500$ kev. These results may explain the strong oxygen acceleration\nobserved in the magnetotail.\n", "  We study the triggering mechanism of a limb-prominence eruption and the\nassociated coronal mass ejection near AR 12342 using SDO and LASCO/SOHO\nobservations. The prominence is seen with an embedded flux thread (FT) at one\nend and bifurcates from the middle to a different footpoint location. The\nmorphological evolution of the FT is similar to an unstable flux rope (FR),\nwhich we regard as prominence embedded FR. The FR twist exceeds the critical\nvalue. In addition, the morphology of the prominence plasma in 304\\AA~images\nmarks the helical nature of the magnetic skeleton with a total of 2.96 turns\nalong arc length. The potential field extrapolation model indicates that the\ncritical height of the background magnetic field gradient falls within the\ninner corona (105Mm) consistent with the extent of coronal plasma loops. These\nresults suggest that the helical kink instability in the embedded FR caused the\nslow rise of the prominence to a height of the torus instability domain.\nMoreover, the differential emission measure analysis unveils heating of the\nprominence plasma to coronal temperatures during eruption, suggesting a\nreconnection-related heating underneath the upward rising embedded FR. The\nprominence starts with a slow rise motion of 10km/s, followed by fast and slow\nacceleration phases having an average acceleration of $28.9m/s^2$, $2.4m/s^2$\nin C2, C3 field of view respectively. As predicted by previous numerical\nsimulations, the observed synchronous kinematic profiles of the CME leading\nedge and the core supports the involved FR instability in the prominence\ninitiation.\n", "  Planets and minor bodies such as asteroids, Kuiper-belt objects and comets\nare integral components of a planetary system. Interactions among them leave\nclues about the formation process of a planetary system. The signature of such\ninteractions is most prominent through observations of its debris disk at\nmillimeter wavelengths where emission is dominated by the population of large\ngrains that stay close to their parent bodies. Here we present ALMA 1.3 mm\nobservations of HD 95086, a young early-type star that hosts a directly imaged\ngiant planet b and a massive debris disk with both asteroid- and Kuiper-belt\nanalogs. The location of the Kuiper-belt analog is resolved for the first time.\nThe system can be depicted as a broad ($\\Delta R/R \\sim$0.84), inclined\n(30\\arcdeg$\\pm$3\\arcdeg) ring with millimeter emission peaked at 200$\\pm$6 au\nfrom the star. The 1.3 mm disk emission is consistent with a broad disk with\nsharp boundaries from 106$\\pm$6 to 320$\\pm$20 au with a surface density\ndistribution described by a power law with an index of --0.5$\\pm$0.2. Our deep\nALMA map also reveals a bright source located near the edge of the ring, whose\nbrightness at 1.3 mm and potential spectral energy distribution are consistent\nwith it being a luminous star-forming galaxy at high redshift. We set\nconstraints on the orbital properties of planet b assuming co-planarity with\nthe observed disk.\n", "  Ongoing and future surveys with repeat imaging in multiple bands are\nproducing (or will produce) time-spaced measurements of brightness, resulting\nin the identification of large numbers of variable sources in the sky. A large\nfraction of these are periodic variables: compilations of these are of\nscientific interest for a variety of purposes. Unavoidably, the data-sets from\nmany such surveys not only have sparse sampling, but also have embedded\nfrequencies in the observing cadence that beat against the natural\nperiodicities of any object under investigation. Such limitations can make\nperiod determination ambiguous and uncertain. For multi-band data sets with\nasynchronous measurements in multiple pass-bands, we want to maximally utilize\nthe information on periodicity in a manner that is agnostic of differences in\nthe light curve shapes across the different channels. Given large volumes of\ndata, computational efficiency is also at a premium. This paper develops and\npresents a computationally economic method for determining periodicity which\ncombines the results from two different classes of period determination\nalgorithms. The underlying principles are illustrated through examples. The\neffectiveness of this approach for combining asynchronously sampled\nmeasurements in multiple observables that share an underlying fundamental\nfrequency is also demonstrated.\n", "  We study Bragg-induced power oscillations in Fourier space between a pair of\noptical resonant transverse modes propagating through a periodic PT symmetric\nlattice, represented by a refractive index that includes gain and loss in a\nbalanced way. Our results imply that the PT-symmetric system shows\nexceptionally rich phenomena absent in its Hermitian counterpart. It is\ndemonstrated that the resonant modes exhibit unique characteristics such as\nBragg power oscillations controlled via the PT symmetry, severe asymmetry in\nmode dynamics, and trapped enhanced transmission. We have also performed\nnumerical simulations in (1+1) and (2+1) dimensions of propagating Gaussian\nbeams to compare with analytical calculations developed under a two-waves\nmodel.\n", "  Several candidates for accreting magnetars have been proposed recently by\ndifferent authors. Existence of such systems contradicts the standard magnetic\nfield decay scenario where a large magnetic field of a neutron star reaches\n$\\lesssim$ few$\\times 10^{13}$G at ages $\\gtrsim 1$ Myr. Among other sources,\nthe high mass X-ray binary 4U0114+65 seems to have a strong magnetic field\naround $10^{14}$ G. We develop a new Bayesian estimate for the kinematic age\nand demonstrate that 4U0114+65 has kinematic age 2.4-5 Myr ($95\\%$ credential\ninterval) since the formation of the neutron star. We discuss which conditions\nare necessary to explain the potential existence of magnetars in accreting\nhigh-mass binaries with ages about few Myrs and larger. Three necessary\ningredients are: the Hall attractor to prevent rapid decay of dipolar field,\nrelatively rapid cooling of the crust in order to avoid Ohmic decay due to\nphonons, and finally, low values of the parameter $Q$ to obtain long Ohmic time\nscale due to impurities. If age and magnetic field estimates for proposed\naccreting magnetars are correct, then these systems set the strongest limit on\nthe crust impurity for a selected sample of neutron stars and provide evidence\nin favour of the Hall attractor.\n", "  The early evolution during massive star cluster formation is still uncertain.\nObserving embedded clusters at their earliest stages of formation can provide\ninsight into the spatial and temporal distribution of the stars and thus probe\ndifferent star cluster formation models. We present near-infrared imaging of an\n8'*13'(5.4pc*8.7pc) region around the massive infalling clump G286.21+0.17(also\nknown as BYF73). The stellar content across the field is determined and\nphotometry is derived in order to { obtain} stellar parameters for the cluster\nmembers. We find evidence for some sub-structure (on scales less than a pc\ndiameter) within the region with apparently at least three different\nsub-clusters associated with the molecular clump based on differences in\nextinction and disk fractions. At the center of the clump we identify a deeply\nembedded sub-cluster. Near-infrared excess is detected for 39-44% in the two\nsub-clusters associated with molecular material and 27% for the exposed\ncluster. Using the disk excess as a proxy for age this suggests the clusters\nare very young. The current total stellar mass is estimated to be at least 200\nMsun. The molecular core hosts a rich population of pre-main sequence stars.\nThere is evidence for multiple events of star formation both in terms of the\nspatial distribution within the star forming region and possibly from the disk\nfrequency.\n", "  We present precise radial velocity observations of WASP-47, a star known to\nhost a hot Jupiter, a distant Jovian companion, and, uniquely, two additional\ntransiting planets in short-period orbits: a super-Earth in a ~19 hour orbit,\nand a Neptune in a ~9 day orbit. We analyze our observations from the HARPS-N\nspectrograph along with previously published data to measure the most precise\nplanet masses yet for this system. When combined with new stellar parameters\nand reanalyzed transit photometry, our mass measurements place strong\nconstraints on the compositions of the two small planets. We find unlike most\nother ultra-short-period planets, the inner planet, WASP-47 e, has a mass (6.83\n+/- 0.66 Me) and radius (1.810 +/- 0.027 Re) inconsistent with an Earth-like\ncomposition. Instead, WASP-47 e likely has a volatile-rich envelope surrounding\nan Earth-like core and mantle. We also perform a dynamical analysis to\nconstrain the orbital inclination of WASP-47 c, the outer Jovian planet. This\nplanet likely orbits close to the plane of the inner three planets, suggesting\na quiet dynamical history for the system. Our dynamical constraints also imply\nthat WASP-47 c is much more likely to transit than a geometric calculation\nwould suggest. We calculate a transit probability for WASP-47 c of about 10%,\nmore than an order of magnitude larger than the geometric transit probability\nof 0.6%.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new ultra-short-period planet and summarize the\nproperties of all such planets for which the mass and radius have been\nmeasured. The new planet, EPIC~228732031b, was discovered in {\\it K2} Campaign\n10. It has a radius of 1.81$^{+0.16}_{-0.12}~R_{\\oplus}$ and orbits a G dwarf\nwith a period of 8.9 hours. Radial velocities obtained with Magellan/PFS and\nTNG/HARPS-N show evidence for stellar activity along with orbital motion. We\ndetermined the planetary mass using two different methods: (1) the \"floating\nchunk offset\" method, based only on changes in velocity observed on the same\nnight, and (2) a Gaussian process regression based on both the radial-velocity\nand photometric time series. The results are consistent and lead to a mass\nmeasurement of $6.5 \\pm 1.6~M_{\\oplus}$, and a mean density of\n$6.0^{+3.0}_{-2.7}$~g~cm$^{-3}$.\n", "  Hard X-rays observed in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are thought to\noriginate from the Comptonization of the optical/UV accretion disk photons in a\nhot corona. Polarization studies of these photons can help to constrain the\ncorona geometry and the plasma properties. We have developed a ray-tracing code\nthat simulates the Comptonization of accretion disk photons in coronae of\narbitrary shape, and use it here to study the polarization of the X-ray\nemission from wedge and spherical coronae. We study the predicted polarization\nsignatures for the fully relativistic and various approximate treatments of the\nelemental Compton scattering processes. We furthermore use the code to evaluate\nthe impact of non-thermal electrons and cyclo-synchrotron photons on the\npolarization properties. Finally, we model the NuSTAR observations of the\nSeyfert I galaxy Mrk 335 and predict the associated polarization signal. Our\nstudies show that X-ray polarimetry missions such as NASA's Imaging X-ray\nPolarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer (XIPE)\nproposed to ESA will provide valuable new information about the physical\nproperties of the plasma close to the event horizon of AGN black holes.\n", "  This paper studies acceleration processes of background thermal electrons in\nX-ray binary jets via turbulent stochastic interactions and shock collisions.\nBy considering turbulent magnetized jets mixed with fluctuation magnetic fields\nand ordered, large-scale one, and numerically solving the transport equation\nalong the jet axis, we explore the influence of such as magnetic turbulence,\nelectron injections, location of an acceleration region, and various cooling\nrates on acceleration efficiency. The results show that (1) the existence of\nthe dominant turbulent magnetic fields in the jets is necessary to accelerate\nbackground thermal electrons to relativistic energies. (2) Acceleration rates\nof electrons depend on magnetohydrodynamic turbulence types, from which the\nturbulence type with a hard slope can accelerate electrons more effectively.\n(3) An effective acceleration region should be located at the distance\n$>10^3R_{\\rm g}$ away from the central black hole ($R_{\\rm g}$ being a\ngravitational radius). As a result of acceleration rates competing with various\ncooling rates, background thermal electrons obtain not only an increase in\ntheir energies but also their spectra are broadened beyond the given initial\ndistribution to form a thermal-like distribution. (4) The acceleration\nmechanisms explored in this work can reasonably provide the electron maximum\nenergy required for interpreting high-energy $\\gamma$-ray observations from\nmicroquasars, but it needs to adopt some extreme parameters in order to predict\na possible very high-energy $\\gamma$-ray signal.\n", "  We report Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph far-ultraviolet\nand Arecibo Telescope H{\\sc i} 21cm spectroscopic studies of six damped and\nsub-damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs and sub-DLAs, respectively) at $z\n\\lesssim 0.1$, that have yielded estimates of their H{\\sc i} column density,\nmetallicity and atomic gas mass. This significantly increases the number of\nDLAs with gas mass estimates, allowing the first comparison between the gas\nmasses of DLAs and local galaxies. Including three absorbers from the\nliterature, we obtain H{\\sc i} masses $\\approx (0.24 - 5.2) \\times 10^9 \\: {\\rm\nM}_\\odot$, lower than the knee of the local H{\\sc i} mass function. This\nimplies that massive galaxies do not dominate the absorption cross-section for\nlow-$z$ DLAs. We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry and spectroscopy to\nidentify the likely hosts of four absorbers, obtaining low stellar masses,\n$\\approx 10^7-10^{8.7} M_\\odot$, in all cases, consistent with the hosts being\ndwarf galaxies. We obtain high H{\\sc i} 21\\,cm or CO emission line widths,\n$\\Delta V_{20} \\approx 100-290$~km~s$^{-1}$, and high gas fractions, $f_{\\rm\nHI} \\approx 5-100$, suggesting that the absorber hosts are gas-rich galaxies\nwith low star formation efficiencies. However, the H{\\sc i} 21\\,cm velocity\nspreads ($\\gtrsim 100$~km~s$^{-1}$) appear systematically larger than the\nvelocity spreads in typical dwarf galaxies.\n", "  It is now well established that globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star\nlight-element abundance variations (known as multiple stellar populations,\nMPs). Such chemical anomalies have been found in (nearly) all the ancient GCs\n(more than 10 Gyr old) of our Galaxy and its close companions, but so far no\nmodel for the origin of MPs is able to reproduce all the relevant observations.\nTo gain new insights into this phenomenon, we have undertaken a photometric\nHubble Space Telescope survey to study clusters with masses comparable to that\nof old GCs, where MPs have been identified, but with significantly younger\nages. Nine clusters in the Magellanic Clouds with ages between $\\sim$ 1.5-11\nGyr have been targeted in this survey. We confirm the presence of multiple\npopulations in all clusters older than 6 Gyr and we add NGC 1978 to the group\nof clusters for which MPs have been identified. With an age of $\\sim$ 2 Gyr,\nNGC 1978 is the youngest cluster known to host chemical abundance spreads found\nto date. We do not detect evident star-to-star variations for slightly younger\nmassive clusters ($\\sim$ 1.7 Gyr), thus pointing towards an unexpected age\ndependence for the onset of multiple populations. This discovery suggests that\nthe formation of MPs is not restricted to the early Universe and that GCs and\nyoung massive clusters share common formation and evolutionary processes.\n", "  Upper Scorpius is a subgroup of the nearest OB association,\nScorpius--Centaurus. Its young age makes it an important association to study\nstar and planet formation. We present parallaxes to 52 low mass stars in Upper\nScorpius, 28 of which have full kinematics. We measure ages of the individual\nstars by combining our measured parallaxes with pre-main sequence evolutionary\ntracks. We find there is a significant difference in the ages of stars with and\nwithout circumstellar disks. The stars without disks have a mean age of\n4.9+/-0.8 Myr and those with disks have an older mean age of 8.2+/-0.9 Myr.\nThis somewhat counterintuitive result suggests that evolutionary effects in\nyoung stars can dominate their apparent ages. We also attempt to use the 28\nstars with full kinematics (i.e.\\ proper motion, radial velocity, and parallax)\nto trace the stars back in time to their original birthplace to obtain a\ntrackback age. We find, as expected given large measurement uncertainties on\navailable radial velocity measurements, that measurement uncertainties alone\ncause the group to diverge after a few Myr.\n", "  We present the analysis of OGLE-2016-BLG-0613, for which the lensing light\ncurve appears to be that of a typical binary-lens event with two caustic spikes\nbut with a discontinuous feature on the trough between the spikes. We find that\nthe discontinuous feature was produced by a planetary companion to the binary\nlens. We find 4 degenerate triple-lens solution classes, each composed of a\npair of solutions according to the well-known wide/close planetary degeneracy.\nOne of these solution classes is excluded due to its relatively poor fit. For\nthe remaining three pairs of solutions, the most-likely primary mass is about\n$M_1\\sim 0.7\\,M_\\odot$ while the planet is a super-Jupiter. In all cases the\nsystem lies in the Galactic disk, about half-way toward the Galactic bulge.\nHowever, in one of these three solution classes, the secondary of the binary\nsystem is a low-mass brown dwarf, with relative mass ratios (1 : 0.03 : 0.003),\nwhile in the two others the masses of the binary components are comparable.\nThese two possibilities can be distinguished in about 2024 when the measured\nlens-source relative proper motion will permit separate resolution of the lens\nand source.\n", "  We investigate the global structure of the advection dominated accretion flow\naround a Schwarzschild black hole where the accretion disc is threaded by\ntoroidal magnetic fields. We consider synchrotron radiative process as an\neffective cooling mechanism active in the flow. With this, we obtain the global\ntransonic accretion solutions by exploring the variety of boundary conditions\nand dissipation parameters, namely accretion rate (${\\dot m}$) and viscosity\n($\\alpha_B$). The fact that depending on the initial parameters, steady state\naccretion flows can possess centrifugally supported shock waves. These global\nshock solutions exist even when the level of dissipation is relatively high. We\nstudy the properties of shock waves and observe that the dynamics of the\npost-shock corona (hereafter, PSC) is regulated by the flow parameters.\nInterestingly, we find that shock solution disappears completely when the\ndissipation parameters exceed their critical values. We calculate the critical\nvalues of viscosity parameter ($\\alpha^{\\rm cri}_B$) adopting the canonical\nvalues of adiabatic indices as $\\gamma=4/3$ (ultra-relativistic) and $1.5$\n(semi-non-relativistic) and find that in the gas pressure dominated domain,\n$\\alpha^{\\rm cri}_B \\sim 0.4$ for $\\gamma=4/3$ and $\\alpha^{\\rm cri}_B \\sim\n0.27$ for $\\gamma=1.5$, respectively. We further show that global shock\nsolutions are relatively more luminous compared to the shock free solutions.\nAlso, we have calculated the synchrotron spectra for shocked solutions. When\nthe shock is considered to be dissipative in nature, it would have an important\nimplication as the available energy at PSC can be utilized to power the\noutflowing matter escaped from PSC. Towards this, we calculate the maximum\nshock luminosity and discuss the observational implication of our present\nformalism.\n", "  Multi-wavelength surveys covering large sky volumes are necessary to obtain\nan accurate census of rare objects such as high luminosity and/or high redshift\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). Stripe 82X is a 31.3 deg$^2$ X-ray survey with\n$Chandra$ and $XMM$-Newton observations overlapping the legacy Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 field, which has a rich investment of\nmulti-wavelength coverage from the ultraviolet to the radio. The wide-area\nnature of this survey presents new challenges for photometric redshifts for AGN\ncompared to previous work on narrow-deep fields because it probes different\npopulations of objects that need to be identified and represented in the\nlibrary of templates. Here we present an updated X-ray plus multi-wavelength\nmatched catalog, including $Spitzer$ counterparts, and estimated photometric\nredshifts for 5961 (96% of a total of 6181) X-ray sources, which have a\nnormalized median absolute deviation, $\\sigma_{\\rm nmad}$ = 0.06 and an outlier\nfraction, $\\eta$ = 13.7%. The populations found in this survey, and the\ntemplate libraries used for photometric redshifts, provide important guiding\nprinciples for upcoming large-area surveys such as $eROSITA$ and 3$XMM$ (in\nX-ray) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; optical).\n", "  We present HI synthesis imaging of the giant elliptical galaxy IC 1459 and\nits surroundings with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our search\nfor extended HI emission revealed a large complex of HI clouds near IC 1459,\nlikely the debris from tidal interactions with neighbouring galaxies. The total\nHI mass ($\\sim 10^9$\\Msun) in the detected clouds spans 250 kpc from the\nnorth-east of the gas-rich spiral NGC 7418A to the south-east of IC 1459. The\nextent and mass of the HI debris, which shows rather irregular morphology and\nkinematics, are similar to those in other nearby groups. Together with HI\nclouds recently detected near two other IC 1459 group members, namely IC 5270\nand NGC 7418, using Phased-Array Feeds (PAFs) on the Australian Square\nKilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the detected debris make up a significant\nfraction of the group's intergalactic medium.\n", "  We discuss the origin of the LMC stellar bar by comparing the star formation\nhistories (SFH) obtained from deep color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) in the bar\nand in a number of fields in different directions within the inner disk. The\nCMDs, reaching the oldest main sequence turnoffs in these very crowded fields,\nhave been obtained with VIMOS on the VLT in service mode, under very good\nseeing conditions. We show that the SFHs of all fields share the same patterns,\nwith consistent variations of the star formation rate as a function of time in\nall of them. We therefore conclude that no specific event of star formation can\nbe identified with the formation of the LMC bar, which instead likely formed\nfrom a redistribution of disk material that occurred when the LMC disk became\nbar unstable, and shared a common SFH with the inner disk thereafter. The\nstrong similarity between the SFH of the center and edge of the bar rules out\nsignificant spatial variations of the SFH across the bar, which are predicted\nby scenarios of classic bar formation through buckling mechanisms.\n", "  We studied some statistical properties of the spatial point process displayed\nby GRBs of known redshift. To find ring like point patterns we developed an\nalgorithm and defined parameters to characterize the level of compactness and\nregularity of the rings found in this procedure. Applying this algorithm to the\nGRB sample we identified three more ring like point patterns. Although, they\nhad the same regularity but much less level of compactness than the original\nGRB ring. Assuming a stochastic independence of the angular and radial\npositions of the GRBs we obtained 1502 additional samples, altogether 542222\ndata points, by bootstrapping the original one. None of these data points\nparticipated in rings having similar level of compactness and regularity as the\noriginal one. Using an appropriate kernel we estimated the joint probability\ndensity of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. Performing MCMC\nsimulations we obtained 1502 new samples, altogether 542222 data points. Among\nthese data points only three represented ring like patterns having similar\nparameters as the original one. By defining a new statistical variable we\ntested the independence of the angular and radial variables of the GRBs. We\nconcluded that despite the existence of local irregularities in the GRBs'\nspatial distribution (e.g. the GGR) one can not reject the Cosmological\nPrinciple, based on their spatial distribution as a whole. We pointed out the\nlarge scale spatial pattern of the GRB activity does not necessarily re ects\nthe large scale distribution of the cosmic matter.\n", "  The dependence of the spin frequency derivative $\\dot{\\nu}$ of accreting\nneutron stars with a strong magnetic field (X-ray pulsars) on the mass\naccretion rate (bolometric luminosity, $L_{bol}$) has been investigated for\neight transient pulsars in binary systems with Be stars. Using data from the\nFermi/GBM and Swift/BAT telescopes, we have shown that for seven of the eight\nsystems the dependence $\\dot{\\nu}$ can be fitted by the model of angular\nmomentum transfer through an accretion disk, which predicts the relation\n$\\dot{\\nu}\\sim L^{6/7}_{bol}$. Hysteresis in the dependence\n$\\dot{\\nu}(L_{bol})$ has been confirmed in the system V 0332+53 and has been\ndetected for the first time in the systems KS 1947+300, GRO J1008-57, and 1A\n0535+26. The radius of the neutron star magnetosphere in all of the\ninvestigated systems have been estimated. We show that this quantity varies\nfrom pulsar to pulsar and depends strongly on the analytical model and the\nestimates for the neutron star and binary system parameters.\n", "  The technique of non-redundant masking (NRM) transforms a conventional\ntelescope into an interferometric array. In practice, this provides a much\nbetter constrained point spread function than a filled aperture and thus higher\nresolution than traditional imaging methods. Here we describe an NRM data\nreduction pipeline. We discuss strategies for NRM observations regarding\ndithering patterns and calibrator selection. We describe relevant image\ncalibrations and use example Large Binocular Telescope datasets to show their\neffects on the scatter in the Fourier measurements. We also describe the\nvarious ways to calculate Fourier quantities, and discuss different calibration\nstrategies. We present the results of image reconstructions from simulated\nobservations where we adjust prior images, weighting schemes, and error bar\nestimation. We compare two imaging algorithms and discuss implications for\nreconstructing images from real observations. Finally, we explore how the\ncurrent state of the art compares to next generation Extremely Large\nTelescopes.\n", "  The existence of hot Jupiters has challenged theories of planetary formation\nsince the first extrasolar planets were detected. Giant planets are generally\nbelieved to form far from their host stars, where volatile materials like water\nexist in their solid phase, making it easier for giant planet cores to\naccumulate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how giant planets\ncan migrate inward from their birth sites to short-period orbits. One such\nmechanism, called Kozai-Lidov migration, requires the presence of distant\ncompanions in orbits inclined by more than $\\sim40$ degrees with respect to the\nplane of the hot Jupiter's orbit. The high occurrence rate of wide companions\nin hot Jupiter systems lends support to this theory for migration. However, the\nexact orbital inclinations of these detected planetary and stellar companions\nis not known, so it is not clear whether the mutual inclination of these\ncompanions is large enough for the Kozai-Lidov process to operate. This paper\nshows that in systems orbiting cool stars with convective outer layers, the\norbits of most wide planetary companions to hot Jupiters must be well aligned\nwith the orbits of the hot Jupiters and the spins of the host stars. For a\nvariety of possible distributions for the inclination of the companion, the\nwidth of the distribution must be less than $\\sim20$ degrees to recreate the\nobservations with good fidelity. As a result, the companion orbits are likely\nwell-aligned with those of the hot Jupiters, and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism does\nnot enforce migration in these systems.\n", "  The observational census of trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes\ngreater than ~250 AU exhibits unexpected orbital structure that is most readily\nattributed to gravitational perturbations induced by a yet-undetected, massive\nplanet. Although the capacity of this planet to (i) reproduce the observed\nclustering of distant orbits in physical space, (ii) facilitate dynamical\ndetachment of their perihelia from Neptune, and (iii) excite a population of\nlong-period centaurs to extreme inclinations is well established through\nnumerical experiments, a coherent theoretical description of the dynamical\nmechanisms responsible for these effects remains elusive. In this work, we\ncharacterize the dynamical processes at play, from semi-analytic grounds. We\nbegin by considering a purely secular model of orbital evolution induced by\nPlanet Nine, and show that it is at odds with the ensuing stability of distant\nobjects. Instead, the long-term survival of the clustered population of\nlong-period KBOs is enabled by a web of mean-motion resonances driven by Planet\nNine. Then, by taking a compact-form approach to perturbation theory, we show\nthat it is the secular dynamics embedded within these resonances that regulates\nthe orbital confinement and perihelion detachment of distant Kuiper belt\nobjects. Finally, we demonstrate that the onset of large-amplitude oscillations\nof orbital inclinations is accomplished through capture of low-inclination\nobjects into a high-order secular resonance and identify the specific harmonic\nthat drives the evolution. In light of the developed qualitative understanding\nof the governing dynamics, we offer an updated interpretation of the current\nobservational dataset within the broader theoretical framework of the Planet\nNine hypothesis.\n", "  The Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) suite of binary stellar\nevolution models and synthetic stellar populations provides a framework for the\nphysically motivated analysis of both the integrated light from distant stellar\npopulations and the detailed properties of those nearby. We present a new\nversion 2.1 data release of these models, detailing the methodology by which\nBPASS incorporates binary mass transfer and its effect on stellar evolution\npathways, as well as the construction of simple stellar populations. We\ndemonstrate key tests of the latest BPASS model suite demonstrating its ability\nto reproduce the colours and derived properties of resolved stellar\npopulations, including well- constrained eclipsing binaries. We consider\nobservational constraints on the ratio of massive star types and the\ndistribution of stellar remnant masses. We describe the identification of\nsupernova progenitors in our models, and demonstrate a good agreement to the\nproperties of observed progenitors. We also test our models against photometric\nand spectroscopic observations of unresolved stellar populations, both in the\nlocal and distant Universe, finding that binary models provide a\nself-consistent explanation for observed galaxy properties across a broad\nredshift range. Finally, we carefully describe the limitations of our models,\nand areas where we expect to see significant improvement in future versions.\n", "  Prior high angular resolution spectroscopic observations of the\nLow-ionization nuclear emission-line region (Liner) in NGC 3998 obtained with\nthe Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) revealed a rich UV-visible spectrum consisting of broad\npermitted and broad forbidden emission lines. The photoionization code XSTAR is\nemployed together with reddening-insensitive emission line diagnostics to\nconstrain a dynamical model for the broad-line region (BLR) in NGC 3998. The\nBLR is modelled as a large H$^+$ region ${\\sim}$ 7 pc in radius consisting of\ndust-free, low density ${\\sim}$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, low metallicity ${\\sim}$ 0.01\n$Z/Z_\\odot$ gas. Modelling the shape of the broad H${\\alpha}$ emission line\nsignificantly discriminates between two independent measures of the black hole\nmass, favouring the estimate of de Francesco et al. (2006). Interpreting the\nbroad H${\\alpha}$ emission line in terms of a steady-state spherically\nsymmetric inflow leads to a mass inflow rate of 1.4 ${\\times}$ 10$^{-2}$\nM$_\\odot$/yr, well within the present uncertainty of calculations that attempt\nto explain the observed X-ray emission in terms of an advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF). Collectively, the model provides an explanation for the\nshape of the H${\\alpha}$ emission line, the relative intensities and\nluminosities for the H Balmer, [O III], and potentially several of the broad UV\nemission lines, as well as refining the initial conditions needed for future\nmodelling of the ADAF.\n", "  IR spectroscopy in the range 12-230 micron with the SPace IR telescope for\nCosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) will reveal the physical processes that\ngovern the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes through cosmic\ntime, bridging the gap between the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the\nnew generation of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) at shorter wavelengths and\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at longer wavelengths. SPICA, with\nits 2.5-m telescope actively-cooled to below 8K, will obtain the first\nspectroscopic determination, in the mid-IR rest-frame, of both the\nstar-formation rate and black hole accretion rate histories of galaxies,\nreaching lookback times of 12 Gyr, for large statistically significant samples.\nDensities, temperatures, radiation fields and gas-phase metallicities will be\nmeasured in dust-obscured galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), sampling a\nlarge range in mass and luminosity, from faint local dwarf galaxies to luminous\nquasars in the distant Universe. AGN and starburst feedback and feeding\nmechanisms in distant galaxies will be uncovered through detailed measurements\nof molecular and atomic line profiles. SPICA's large-area deep\nspectrophotometric surveys will provide mid-IR spectra and continuum fluxes for\nunbiased samples of tens of thousands of galaxies, out to redshifts of z~6.\nFurthermore, SPICA spectroscopy will uncover the most luminous galaxies in the\nfirst few hundred million years of the Universe, through their characteristic\ndust and molecular hydrogen features.\n", "  Star formation in magnetically subcritical clouds is investigated using a\nthree-dimensional non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamics simulation. Since rapid cloud\ncollapse is suppressed until the magnetic flux is sufficiently removed from the\ninitially magnetically subcritical cloud by ambipolar diffusion, it takes >\n5-10t_ff to form a protostar, where t_ff is the freefall timescale of the\ninitial cloud. The angular momentum of the star forming cloud is efficiently\ntransferred to the interstellar medium before the rapid collapse begins, and\nthe collapsing cloud has a very low angular momentum. Unlike the magnetically\nsupercritical case, no large-scale low-velocity outflow appears in such a\ncollapsing cloud due to the short lifetime of the first core. Following\nprotostar formation, a very weak high-velocity jet, which has a small momentum\nand might disappear at a later time, is driven near the protostar, while the\ncircumstellar disc does not grow during the early mass accretion phase. The\nresults show that the star formation process in magnetically subcritical clouds\nis qualitatively different from that in magnetically supercritical clouds.\n", "  Our current knowledge of star formation and accretion luminosity at\nhigh-redshift (z>3-4), as well as the possible connections between them, relies\nmostly on observations in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), which are strongly\naffected by dust obscuration. Due to the lack of sensitivity of past and\ncurrent infrared (IR) instrumentation, so far it has not been possible to get a\nglimpse into the early phases of the dust-obscured Universe. Among the next\ngeneration of IR observatories, SPICA, observing in the 12-350 micron range,\nwill be the only facility that can enable us to make the required leap forward\nin understanding the obscured star-formation rate and black-hole accretion rate\ndensities (SFRD and BHARD, respectively) with respect to what Spitzer and\nHerschel achieved in the mid- and far-IR at z<3. In particular, SPICA will have\nthe unique ability to trace the evolution of the obscured SFRD and BHARD over\ncosmic time, from the peak of their activity back to the reionisation epoch\n(i.e., 3<z<6-7), where its predecessors had severe limitations. Here we discuss\nthe potential of both deep and shallow photometric surveys performed with the\nSPICA mid-IR instrument (SMI), enabled by the very low level of impact of dust\nobscuration in a band centred at 34 micron. These unique unbiased photometric\nsurveys that SPICA will perform will be followed up by observations both with\nthe SPICA spectrometers and with other facilities at shorter and longer\nwavelengths, with the aim to fully characterise the evolution of AGNs and\nstar-forming galaxies after re-ionisation.\n", "  We use CARMA 3mm continuum and molecular lines (NH2D, N2H+, HCO+, HCN and CS)\nat ~1000 au resolution to characterize the structure and kinematics of the\nenvelope surrounding the deeply embedded first core candidate Per-Bolo 58. The\nline profile of the observed species shows two distinct peaks separated by\n0.4-0.6 km/s, most likely arising from two different optically thin velocity\ncomponents rather than the product of self-absorption in an optically thick\nline. The two velocity components, each with a mass of ~0.5-0.6 Msun, overlap\nspatially at the position of the continuum emission, and produce a general\ngradient along the outflow direction. We investigate whether these observations\nare consistent with infall in a turbulent and magnetized envelope. We compare\nthe morphology and spectra of the N2H+(1-0) with synthetic observations of an\nMHD simulation that considers the collapse of an isolated core that is\ninitially perturbed with a turbulent field. The proposed model matches the data\nin the production of two velocity components, traced by the isolated hyperfine\nline of the N2H+(1-0) spectra and shows a general agreement in morphology and\nvelocity field. We also use large maps of the region to compare the kinematics\nof the core with that of the surrounding large-scale filamentary structure and\nfind that accretion from the large-scale filament could also explain the\ncomplex kinematics exhibited by this young dense core.\n", "  We report spectroscopic observations of the 2.63 day, detached, F-type\nmain-sequence eclipsing binary V2154 Cyg. We use our observations together with\nexisting $uvby$ photometric measurements to derive accurate absolute masses and\nradii for the stars good to better than 1.5%. We obtain masses of M1 = 1.269\n+/- 0.017 M(Sun) and M2 = 0.7542 +/- 0.0059 M(Sun), radii of R1 = 1.477 +/-\n0.012 R(Sun) and R2 = 0.7232 +/- 0.0091 R(Sun), and effective temperatures of\n6770 +/- 150 K and 5020 +/- 150 K for the primary and secondary stars,\nrespectively. Both components appear to have their rotations synchronized with\nthe motion in the circular orbit. A comparison of the properties of the primary\nwith current stellar evolution models gives good agreement for a metallicity of\n[Fe/H] = -0.17, which is consistent with photometric estimates, and an age of\nabout 2.2 Gyr. On the other hand, the K2 secondary is larger than predicted for\nits mass by about 4%. Similar discrepancies are known to exist for other cool\nstars, and are generally ascribed to stellar activity. The system is in fact an\nX-ray source, and we argue that the main site of the activity is the secondary\nstar. Indirect estimates give a strength of about 1 kG for the surface magnetic\nfield on that star. A previously known close visual companion to V2154 Cyg is\nshown to be physically bound, making the system a hierarchical triple.\n", "  The extragalactic background light (EBL), from ultraviolet to infrared\nwavelengths, is predominantly due to emission from stars, accreting black holes\nand reprocessed light due to Galactic dust. The EBL can be studied through the\nimprint it leaves, via $\\gamma$-$\\gamma$ absorption of high-energy photons, in\nthe spectra of distant $\\gamma$-ray sources. The EBL has been probed through\nthe search for the attenuation it produces in the spectra of BL Lacertae (BL\nLac) objects and individual $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs). GRBs have significant\nadvantages over blazars for the study of the EBL especially at high redshifts.\nHere we analyze a combined sample of twenty-two GRBs, detected by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope between 65 MeV and 500 GeV. We report a marginal detection\n(at the ~2.8 $\\sigma$ level) of the EBL attenuation in the stacked spectra of\nthe source sample. This measurement represents a first constraint of the EBL at\nan effective redshift of ~1.8. We combine our results with prior EBL\nconstraints and conclude that Fermi-LAT is instrumental to constrain the UV\ncomponent of the EBL. We discuss the implications on existing empirical models\nof EBL evolution.\n", "  Molecular line-transition lists are an essential ingredient for\nradiative-transfer calculations. With recent databases now surpassing the\nbillion-lines mark, handling them has become computationally prohibitive, due\nto both the required processing power and memory. Here I present a\ntemperature-dependent algorithm to separate strong from weak line transitions,\nreformatting the large majority of the weaker lines into a cross-section data\nfile, and retaining the detailed line-by-line information of the fewer strong\nlines. For any given molecule over the 0.3--30 {\\micron} range, this algorithm\nreduces the number of lines to a few million, enabling faster\nradiative-transfer computations without a significant loss of information. The\nfinal compression rate depends on how densely populated is the spectrum. I\nvalidate this algorithm by comparing Exomol's HCN extinction-coefficient\nspectra between the complete (65 million line transitions) and compressed (7.7\nmillion) line lists. Over the 0.6--33 {\\micron} range, the average difference\nbetween extinction-coefficient values is less than 1\\%. A Python/C\nimplementation of this algorithm is open-source and available at\nhttps://github.com/pcubillos/repack . So far, this code handles the Exomol and\nHITRAN line-transition format.\n", "  The Kepler mission has released over 4496 planetary candidates, among which\n3483 planets have been confirmed as of April 2017. The statistical results of\nthe planets show that there are two peaks around 1.5 and 2.0 in the\ndistribution of orbital period ratios. The observations indicate that a plenty\nof planet pairs could have firstly been captured into mean motion resonances\n(MMRs) in planetary formation. Subsequently, these planets depart from exact\nresonant locations to be near MMRs configurations. Through type I migration,\ntwo low-mass planets have a tendency to be trapped into first-order MMRs (2:1\nor 3:2 MMRs), however two scenarios of mass accretion of planets and potential\noutward migration play an important role in reshaping their final orbital\nconfigurations. Under the scenario of mass accretion, the planet pairs can\ncross 2:1 MMRs and then enter into 3:2 MMRs, especially for the inner pairs.\nWith such formation scenario, the possibility that two planets are locked into\n3:2 MMRs can increase if they are formed in a flat disk. Moreover, the outward\nmigration can make planets have a high likelihood to be trapped into 3:2 MMRs.\nWe perform additional runs to investigate the mass relationship for those\nplanets in three-planet systems, and we show that two peaks near 1.5 and 2.0\nfor the period ratios of two planets can be easily reproduced through our\nformation scenario. We further show that the systems in chain resonances (e.g.,\n4:2:1, 3:2:1, 6:3:2 and 9:6:4 MMRs), have been observed in our simulations.\nThis mechanism can be applicable to understand the formation of systems of\nKepler-48, Kepler-53, Kepler-100, Kepler-192, Kepler-297, Kepler-399, and\nKepler-450.\n", "  Atmospheric modeling of low-gravity (VL-G) young brown dwarfs remains a\nchallenge. The presence of very thick clouds has been suggested because of\ntheir extremely red near-infrared (NIR) spectra, but no cloud models provide a\ngood fit to the data with a radius compatible with evolutionary models for\nthese objects. We show that cloudless atmospheres assuming a temperature\ngradient reduction caused by fingering convection provides a very good model to\nmatch the observed VL-G NIR spectra. The sequence of extremely red colors in\nthe NIR for atmospheres with effective temperature from ~2000 K down to ~1200 K\nis very well reproduced with predicted radii typical of young low-gravity\nobjects. Future observations with NIRSPEC and MIRI on the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) will provide more constrains in the mid-infrared, helping to\nconfirm/refute whether or not the NIR reddening is caused by fingering\nconvection. We suggest that the presence/absence of clouds will be directly\ndetermined by the silicate absorption features that can be observed with MIRI.\nJWST will therefore be able to better characterize the atmosphere of these hot\nyoung brown dwarfs and their low-gravity exoplanet analogues.\n", "  We investigated the possibility of acceleration of ultra-high-energy cosmic\nrays (UHECRs) in nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using archival\nmulti-wavelength observational data, and then we constrained their physical\nconditions, i.e., the luminosity of the synchrotron radiation and the size of\nthe acceleration site. First, we investigated the spatial correlation between\nthe arrival directions of UHECRs and the positions of nearby AGNs in the Fermi\nthird gamma-ray source catalog. We selected 27 AGNs as candidates of\naccelerators of UHECRs. Then, we evaluated the physical conditions in the\nacceleration regions of these AGNs via the Pe'er and Loeb method, which uses\nthe peak luminosity of synchrotron radiation and the peak flux ratio of inverse\nCompton scattering to synchrotron radiation. From the evaluation, we found that\nsix AGNs have the ability to accelerate ultra-high-energy protons in the AGN\ncores. Furthermore, we found that the minimum acceleration size must be more\nthan a few kpc for acceleration of UHE protons in the AGN lobes.\n", "  The 30 Doradus Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) contains the\nmassive starburst cluster NGC 2070 with a massive and probably younger stellar\nsub clump at its center: R136. It is not clear how such a massive inner cluster\ncould form several million years after the older stars in NGC 2070, given that\nstellar feedback is usually thought to expel gas and inhibit further star\nformation. Using the recently developed 1D feedback scheme WARPFIELD to scan a\nlarge range of cloud and cluster properties, we show that an age offset of\nseveral million years between the stellar populations is in fact to be expected\ngiven the interplay between feedback and gravity in a giant molecular cloud\n(GMC) with a density $\\gtrsim 500$ cm$^{-3}$ due to re-accretion of gas onto\nthe older stellar population. Neither capture of field stars nor gas retention\ninside the cluster have to be invoked in order to explain the observed age\noffset in NGC 2070 as well as the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM)\naround it.\n", "  As a fundamental magnetic structure in the solar corona, electric current\nsheets (CSs) can form either prior to or during solar flare, and they are\nessential for magnetic energy dissipation in the solar corona by enabling\nmagnetic reconnection. However static reconstruction of CS is rare, possibly\ndue to limitation inherent in available coronal field extrapolation codes. Here\nwe present the reconstruction of a large-scale pre-flare CS in solar active\nregion 11967 using an MHD-relaxation model constrained by SDO/HMI vector\nmagnetogram. The CS is found to be associated with a set of peculiar homologous\nflares that exhibit unique X-shaped ribbons and loops occurring in a\nquadrupolar magnetic configuration. This is evidenced by that the field lines\ntraced from the CS to the photosphere form an X shape which nearly precisely\nreproduces the shape of the observed flare ribbons, suggesting that the flare\nis a product of the dissipation of the CS through reconnection. The CS forms in\na hyperbolic flux tube, which is an intersection of two quasi-separatrix\nlayers. The recurrence of the X-shaped flares might be attributed to the\nrepetitive formation and dissipation of the CS, as driven by the photospheric\nfootpoint motions. These results demonstrate the power of data-constrained MHD\nmodel in reproducing CS in the corona as well as providing insight into the\nmagnetic mechanism of solar flares.\n", "  The dynamics of the solar wind depends intrinsically on the structure of the\nglobal solar magnetic field, which undergoes fundamental changes over the 11-yr\nsolar cycle. For instance, the wind terminal velocity is thought to be\nanti-correlated with the expansion factor, a measure of how the magnetic field\nvaries with height in the solar corona, usually computed at a fixed height\n($\\approx 2.5 R_{\\odot}$, the source surface radius which approximates the\ndistance at which all magnetic field lines become open). However, the magnetic\nfield expansion affects the solar wind in a more detailed way, its influence on\nthe solar wind properties remaining significant well beyond the source surface.\nWe demonstrate this using 3D global MHD simulations of the solar corona,\nconstrained by surface magnetograms over half a solar cycle (1989-2001). A\nself-consistent expansion beyond the solar wind critical point (even up to\n$10R_{\\odot}$) makes our model comply with observed characteristics of the\nsolar wind, namely, that the radial magnetic field intensity becomes latitude\nindependent at some distance from the Sun, and that the mass flux is mostly\nindependent of the terminal wind speed. We also show that near activity\nminimum, the expansion in the higher corona has more influence on the wind\nspeed than the expansion below $2.5 R_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We introduce a method for modeling disk galaxies designed to take full\nadvantage of data from integral field spectroscopy (IFS). The method fits\nequilibrium models to simultaneously reproduce the surface brightness, rotation\nand velocity dispersion profiles of a galaxy. The models are fully\nself-consistent 6D distribution functions for a galaxy with a Sersic-profile\nstellar bulge, exponential disk and parametric dark matter halo, generated by\nan updated version of GalactICS. By creating realistic flux-weighted maps of\nthe kinematic moments (flux, mean velocity and dispersion), we simultaneously\nfit photometric and spectroscopic data using both maximum-likelihood and\nBayesian (MCMC) techniques. We apply the method to a GAMA spiral galaxy\n(G79635) with kinematics from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and deep $g$- and $r$-band\nphotometry from the VST-KiDS survey, comparing parameter constraints with those\nfrom traditional 2D bulge-disk decomposition. Our method returns broadly\nconsistent results for shared parameters, while constraining the mass-to-light\nratios of stellar components and reproducing the HI-inferred circular velocity\nwell beyond the limits of the SAMI data. While the method is tailored for\nfitting integral field kinematic data, it can use other dynamical constraints\nlike central fibre dispersions and \\HI circular velocities, and is well-suited\nfor modelling galaxies with a combination of deep imaging and HI and/or optical\nspectra (resolved or otherwise). Our implementation (MagRite) is\ncomputationally efficient and can generate well-resolved models and kinematic\nmaps in under a minute on modern processors.\n", "  One of the primary questions when characterizing Earth-sized and\nsuper-Earth-sized exoplanets is whether they have a substantial atmosphere like\nEarth and Venus or a bare-rock surface like Mercury. Phase curves of the\nplanets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a\nsubstantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock\nsurface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has\npreviously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot\nJupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the\nthermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We\nutilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared\nphotometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary\nproperties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio\nbetween radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and\natmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by\nthermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat\nredistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective\ntimescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement\ncannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by\ncurrents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the\nscenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat\nredistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar. The\nSpitzer 4.5-micron band is thus a window into the deep atmosphere of the planet\n55 Cancri e.\n", "  We present the UV photometry of the globular cluster NGC 1851 using images\nacquired with the Ultra-violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard the ASTROSAT\nsatellite. PSF-fitting photometric data derived from images in two far-UV (FUV)\nfilters and one near-UV (NUV) filter are used to construct color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMD), in combination with HST and ground-based optical photometry. In\nthe FUV, we detect only the bluest part of the cluster horizontal branch (HB);\nin the NUV, we detect the full extent of the HB, including the red HB, blue HB\nand a small number of RR Lyrae stars. UV variability was detected in 18 RR\nLyrae stars, and 3 new variables were also detected in the central region. The\nUV/optical CMDs are then compared with isochrones of different age and\nmetallicity (generated using Padova and BaSTI models) and synthetic HB (using\nhelium enhanced $Y^2$ models). We are able to identify two populations among\nthe HB stars, which are found to have either an age range of 10-12~Gyr, or a\nrange in Y$_{ini}$ of 0.23 - 0.28, for a metallicity of [Fe/H] =$-$1.2 to\n$-$1.3. These estimations from the UV CMDs are consistent with those from\noptical studies. The almost complete sample of the HB stars tend to show a\nmarginal difference in spatial/azimuthal distribution among the blue and red HB\nstars. This study thus show cases the capability of UVIT, with its excellent\nresolution and large field of view, to study the hot stellar population in\nGalactic globular clusters.\n", "  We present the first high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) observations of a sunspot at wavelengths of 1.3 mm and 3 mm,\nobtained during the solar ALMA Science Verification campaign in 2015, and\ncompare them with the predictions of semi-empirical sunspot umbral/penumbral\natmosphere models. For the first time millimeter observations of sunspots have\nresolved umbral/penumbral brightness structure at the chromospheric heights,\nwhere the emission at these wavelengths is formed. We find that the sunspot\numbra exhibits a radically different appearance at 1.3 mm and 3 mm, whereas the\npenumbral brightness structure is similar at the two wavelengths. The inner\npart of the umbra is ~600 K brighter than the surrounding quiet Sun (QS) at 3\nmm and is ~700 K cooler than the QS at 1.3 mm, being the coolest part of\nsunspot at this wavelength. On average, the brightness of the penumbra at 3 mm\nis comparable to the QS brightness, while at 1.3 mm it is ~1000 K brighter than\nthe QS. Penumbral brightness increases towards the outer boundary in both ALMA\nbands. Among the tested umbral models, that of Severino et al. (1994) provides\nthe best fit to the observational data, including both the ALMA data analyzed\nin this study and data from earlier works. No penumbral model amongst those\nconsidered here gives a satisfactory fit to the currently available\nmeasurements. ALMA observations at multiple mm wavelengths can be used for\ntesting existing sunspot models, and serve as an important input to constrain\nnew empirical models.\n", "  The energy absorption and energy extinction cross sections of an object in\nuniform translational motion in free space are Lorentz invariant, but the total\nenergy scattering cross section is not. Indeed, the forward-scattering theorem\nholds true for co-moving observers but not for other inertial observers. If a\npulsed plane wave with finite energy density is incident upon an object, the\nenergies scattered, absorbed, and removed from the incident signal by the\nobject are finite. The difference between the energy extinction cross section\nand the sum of the total energy scattering and energy absorption cross sections\nfor a non-co-moving inertial observer can be either negative or positive,\ndepending on the object's velocity, shape, size, and composition. Calculations\nfor a uniformly translating, solid, homogeneous sphere show that all three\ncross sections go to zero as the sphere recedes directly from the source of the\nincident signal at speeds approaching c, whether the material is a plasmonic\nmetal (e.g., silver) or simply a dissipative dielectric material (e.g., silicon\ncarbide).\n", "  The Hydrogen Balmer series is a basic radiative loss channel from the flaring\nsolar chromosphere. We report here on the analysis of an extremely rare set of\nsimultaneous observations of a solar flare in the H${\\alpha}$ and H${\\beta}$\nlines at high spatial and temporal resolution, which were acquired at the Dunn\nSolar Telescope. Images of the C3.3 flare (SOL2014-04-22T15:22) made at various\nwavelengths along the H${\\alpha}$ line profile by the Interferometric\nBidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) and in the H${\\beta}$ with the Rapid\nOscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) broadband imager are analyzed to\nobtain the intensity evolution. The H${\\alpha}$ and H${\\beta}$ intensity\nexcesses in three identified flare footpoints are well correlated in time. We\nexamine the ratio of H${\\alpha}$ to H${\\beta}$ flare excess, which was proposed\nby previous authors as a possible diagnostic of the level of electron beam\nenergy input. In the stronger footpoints, the typical value of the the\nH${\\alpha}$/H${\\beta}$ intensity ratio observed is $\\sim 0.4-0.5$, in broad\nagreement with values obtained from a RADYN non-LTE simulation driven by an\nelectron beam with parameters constrained (as far as possible) by observation.\nThe weaker footpoint has a larger H${\\alpha}$/H${\\beta}$ ratio, again\nconsistent with a RADYN simulation but with a smaller energy flux. The\nH${\\alpha}$ line profiles observed have a less prominent central reversal than\nis predicted by the RADYN results, but can be brought into agreement if the\nH${\\alpha}$-emitting material has a filling factor of around 0.2--0.3.\n", "  We show that the mysterious, rapidly variable emission at ~400 MeV observed\nfrom the Crab Nebula by the AGILE and Fermi experiments could be the result of\na sudden drop in the mass-loading of the pulsar wind. The current required to\nmaintain wave activity in the wind is then carried by very few particles of\nhigh Lorentz factor. On impacting the Nebula, these particles produce a tightly\nbeamed, high luminosity burst of hard gamma-rays, similar to those observed.\nThis implies (i) the emission is synchrotron radiation in the toroidal field of\nthe Nebula, and, therefore, linearly polarized and (ii) this mechanism\npotentially contributes to the gamma-ray emission from other powerful pulsars,\nsuch as the Magellanic Cloud objects J0537-6910 and B0540-69.\n", "  High-harmonic generation by a laser-driven solid slab is simulated using\ntime-dependent density functional theory. Multiple harmonic plateaus up to very\nhigh harmonic orders are observed already at surprisingly low field strengths.\nThe full all-electron harmonic spectra are, in general, very different from\nthose of any individual Kohn-Sham orbital. Freezing the Kohn-Sham potential\ninstead is found to be a good approximation for the laser intensities and\nharmonic orders considered. The origins of the plateau cutoffs are explained in\nterms of band gaps that can be reached by Kohn-Sham electrons and holes moving\nthrough the band structure.\n", "  We estimate the population of black holes with luminous stellar companions\n(BH-LCs) in the Milky Way (MW) observable by Gaia. We evolve a realistic\ndistribution of BH-LC progenitors from zero-age to the current epoch taking\ninto account relevant physics, including binary stellar evolution, BH-formation\nphysics, and star formation rate, to estimate the BH-LC population in the MW\ntoday. We predict that Gaia will discover between 3800 and 12,000 BH-LCs by the\nend of its 5 yr mission, depending on BH natal kick strength and observability\nconstraints. We find that the overall yield, and distributions of\neccentricities and masses of observed BH-LCs can provide important constraints\non the strength of BH natal kicks. Gaia-detected BH-LCs are expected to have\nvery different orbital properties compared to those detectable via radio,\nX-ray, or gravitational wave observations.\n", "  We present high-quality fluid dynamical simulations of isothermal gas flows\nin a rotating barred potential. We show that a large quantity of gas is driven\nright into the nucleus of a model galaxy when the potential lacks a central\nmass concentration, but the inflow stalls at a nuclear ring in comparison\nsimulations that include a central massive object. The radius of the nuclear\ngas ring increases linearly with the mass of the central object. We argue that\nbars drive gas right into the nucleus in the early stages of disk galaxy\nformation, where a nuclear star cluster and perhaps a massive black hole could\nbe created. The process is self-limiting, however, because inflow stalls at a\nnuclear ring once the mass of gas and stars in the nucleus exceeds ~1% of the\ndisk mass, which shuts off rapid growth of the black hole. We briefly discuss\nthe relevance of these results to the seeding of massive black holes in\ngalaxies, the merger model for quasar evolution, and the existence of massive\nblack holes in disk galaxies that lack a significant classical bulge.\n", "  Theoretical calculations suggest the presence of low-lying excited states in\n$^{25}$O. Previous experimental searches by means of proton knockout on\n$^{26}$F produced no evidence for such excitations.\n  We search for excited states in $^{25}$O using the ${ {}^{24}\\text{O} (d,p)\n{}^{25}\\text{O} }$ reaction. The theoretical analysis of excited states in\nunbound $^{25,27}$O is based on the configuration interaction approach that\naccounts for couplings to the scattering continuum.\n  We use invariant-mass spectroscopy to measure neutron-unbound states in\n$^{25}$O. For the theoretical approach, we use the complex-energy Gamow Shell\nModel and Density Matrix Renormalization Group method with a finite-range\ntwo-body interaction optimized to the bound states and resonances of\n$^{23-26}$O, assuming a core of $^{22}$O. We predict energies, decay widths,\nand asymptotic normalization coefficients.\n  Our calculations in a large $spdf$ space predict several low-lying excited\nstates in $^{25}$O of positive and negative parity, and we obtain an\nexperimental limit on the relative cross section of a possible ${ {J}^{\\pi} =\n{1/2}^{+} }$ state with respect to the ground-state of $^{25}$O at\n$\\sigma_{1/2+}/\\sigma_{g.s.} = 0.25_{-0.25}^{+1.0}$. We also discuss how the\nobservation of negative parity states in $^{25}$O could guide the search for\nthe low-lying negative parity states in $^{27}$O.\n  Previous experiments based on the proton knockout of $^{26}$F suffered from\nthe low cross sections for the population of excited states in $^{25}$O because\nof low spectroscopic factors. In this respect, neutron transfer reactions carry\nmore promise.\n", "  In this paper, we first discuss a series of important but puzzling physical\nmechanisms concerning the energy source, various kinds of core collapsed\nsupernovae explosion mechanisms during central gravitational collapse in\nastrophysics. We also discuss the puzzle of possible association of\n$\\gamma$-ray burst with gravitational wave perturbation, the heat source for\nthe molten interior of the core of the earth and finally the puzzling problem\nof the cooling of white dwarfs. We then make use of the estimations for the\nspace flux of magnetic monopoles (hereafter MMs) and nucleon decay induced by\nMMs (called the Rubakov-Callen(RC) effect) to obtain the luminosity due to the\nRC effect. In terms of the formula for this RC luminosity, we present a unified\ntreatment for the heat source of the Earth's core, the energy source for the\nwhite dwarf interior, various kinds of core collapsed supernovae (Type II\nSupernova (SNII), Type Ib Supernova (SNIb), Type Ic Supernova (SNIc), Super\nluminous supernova (SLSN)), and the production mechanism for $\\gamma$-ray\nburst. This unified model can also be used to reasonably explain the possible\nassociation of the short $\\gamma$-ray burst detected by the Fermi $\\gamma$-ray\nBurst Monitoring Satellite (GBM) with the LIGO gravitational wave event\nGW150914 in September 2015.\n", "  The structure of weakly bound and unbound nuclei close to particle drip lines\nis one of the major science drivers of nuclear physics. A comprehensive\nunderstanding of these systems goes beyond the traditional configuration\ninteractions approach formulated in the Hilbert space of localized states\n(nuclear shell model) and requires an open quantum system description. The\ncomplex-energy Gamow Shell Model (GSM) provides such a framework as it is\ncapable of describing resonant and non-resonant many-body states on equal\nfooting.\n  To make reliable predictions, quality input is needed that allows for the\nfull uncertainty quantification of theoretical results. In this study, we carry\nout the optimization of an effective GSM (one-body and two-body) interaction in\nthe $psdf$ shell model space. The resulting interaction is expected to describe\nnuclei with $5 \\leqslant A \\leqslant 12$ at the $p-sd$-shell interface.\n  The optimized one-body potential reproduces nucleon-$^4$He scattering phase\nshifts up to an excitation energy of 20 MeV. The two-body interaction built on\ntop of the optimized one-body field is adjusted to the bound and unbound\nground-state binding energies and selected excited states of the Helium,\nLithium, and Beryllium isotopes up to $A=9$. A very good agreement with\nexperiment was obtained for binding energies. First applications of the\noptimized interaction include predictions for two-nucleon correlation densities\nand excitation spectra of light nuclei with quantified uncertainties.\n  The new interaction will enable comprehensive and fully quantified studies of\nstructure and reactions aspects of nuclei from the $psd$ region of the nuclear\nchart.\n", "  Magnetic bright points in the solar photosphere, visible in both continuum\nand G-band images, indicate footpoints of kilogauss magnetic flux tubes\nextending to the corona. The power spectrum of bright-point motion is thus also\nthe power spectrum of Alfven wave excitation, transporting energy up flux tubes\ninto the corona. This spectrum is a key input in coronal and heliospheric\nmodels. We produce a power spectrum of bright-point motion using radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations, exploiting spatial resolution higher than can\nbe obtained in present-day observations, while using automated tracking to\nproduce large data quantities. We find slightly higher amounts of power at all\nfrequencies compared to observation-based spectra, while confirming the\nspectrum shape of recent observations. This also provides a prediction for\nobservations of bright points with DKIST, which will achieve similar resolution\nand high sensitivity. We also find a granule size distribution in support of an\nobserved two-population distribution, and we present results from tracking\npassive tracers which show a similar power spectrum to that of bright points.\nFinally, we introduce a simplified, laminar model of granulation, with which we\nexplore the roles of turbulence and of the properties of the granulation\npattern in determining bright-point motion.\n", "  We use Green Bank Ammonia Survey observations of NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2)\nemission with 32'' FWHM resolution from a ~ 10 pc$^{2}$ portion of the\nCepheus-L1251 molecular cloud to identify hierarchical dense gas structures.\nOur dendrogram analysis of the NH$_3$ data results in 22 top-level structures,\nwhich reside within 13 lower-level, parent structures. The structures are\ncompact (0.01 pc $\\lesssim R_{eff} \\lesssim$ 0.1 pc) and are spatially\ncorrelated with the highest H$_2$ column density portions of the cloud. We also\ncompare the ammonia data to a catalog of dense cores identified by\nhigher-resolution (18.2'' FWHM) Herschel Space Observatory observations of dust\ncontinuum emission from Cepheus-L1251. Maps of kinetic gas temperature,\nvelocity dispersion, and NH$_3$ column density, derived from detailed modeling\nof the NH$_3$ data, are used to investigate the stability and chemistry of the\nammonia-identified and Herschel-identified structures. We show that the dust\nand dense gas in the structures have similar temperatures, with median\n$T_{dust}$ and $T_K$ measurements of 11.7 $\\pm$ 1.1 K and 10.3 $\\pm$ 2.0 K,\nrespectively. Based on a virial analysis, we find that the ammonia-identified\nstructures are gravitationally dominated, yet may be in or near a state of\nvirial equilibrium. Meanwhile, the majority of the Herschel-identified dense\ncores appear to be not bound by their own gravity and instead confined by\nexternal pressure. CCS $(2_0-1_0)$ and HC$_5$N $(9-8)$ emission from the region\nreveal broader line widths and centroid velocity offsets when compared to the\nNH$_3$ (1,1) emission in some cases, likely due to these carbon-based molecules\ntracing the turbulent outer layers of the dense cores.\n", "  We tested the performance of photometric redshifts for galaxies in the Hubble\nUltra Deep field down to 30th magnitude. We compared photometric redshift\nestimates from three spectral fitting codes from the literature (EAZY, BPZ and\nBEAGLE) to high quality redshifts for 1227 galaxies from the MUSE integral\nfield spectrograph. All these codes can return photometric redshifts with bias\n|Dzn|=|z-z_phot|/(1+z)<0.05 down to F775W=30 and spectroscopic incompleteness\nis unlikely to strongly modify this statement. We have, however, identified\nclear systematic biases in the determination of photometric redshifts: in the\n0.4<z<1.5 range, photometric redshifts are systematically biased low by as much\nas Dzn=-0.04 in the median, and at z>3 they are systematically biased high by\nup to Dzn = 0.05, an offset that can in part be explained by adjusting the\namount of intergalactic absorption applied. In agreement with previous studies\nwe find little difference in the performance of the different codes, but in\ncontrast to those we find that adding extensive ground-based and IRAC\nphotometry actually can worsen photo-z performance for faint galaxies. We find\nan outlier fraction, defined through |Dzn|>0.15, of 8% for BPZ and 10% for EAZY\nand BEAGLE, and show explicitly that this is a strong function of magnitude.\nWhile this outlier fraction is high relative to numbers presented in the\nliterature for brighter galaxies, they are very comparable to literature\nresults when the depth of the data is taken into account. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that while a redshift might be of high confidence, the association\nof a spectrum to the photometric object can be very uncertain and lead to a\ncontamination of a few percent in spectroscopic training samples that do not\nshow up as catastrophic outliers, a problem that must be tackled in order to\nhave sufficiently accurate photometric redshifts for future cosmological\nsurveys.\n", "  We provide the first direct observations of interstellar H+ and He+ pickup\nions in the solar wind from 22 AU to 38 AU. We use the Vasyliunas and Siscoe\nmodel functional form to quantify the pickup ion distributions, and while the\nfit parameters generally lie outside their physically expected ranges, this\nform allows fits that quantify variations in the pickup H+ properties with\ndistance. By ~20 AU, the pickup ions already provide the dominant internal\npressure in the solar wind. We determine the radial trends and extrapolate them\nto the termination shock at ~90 AU, where the pickup H+ to core solar wind\ndensity reaches ~0.14. The pickup H+ temperature and thermal pressure increase\nfrom 22-38 AU, indicating additional heating of the pickup ions. This produces\nvery large extrapolated ratios of pickup H+ to solar wind temperature and\npressure and an extrapolated ratio of the pickup ion pressure to the solar wind\ndynamic pressure at the termination shock of ~0.16. Such a large ratio has\nprofound implications for moderating the termination shock and the overall\nouter heliospheric interaction. We also identify suprathermal tails in the H+\nspectra and complex features in the He+ spectra, likely indicating variations\nin the pickup ion history and processing. Finally, we discover enhancements in\nboth H+ and He+ populations just below their cutoff energies, which may be\nassociated with enhanced local pickup. This study serves to document the\nrelease and as the citable reference of these pickup ion data for broad\ncommunity use and analysis.\n", "  We report high-resolution spectroscopic detection of TiO molecular signature\nin the day-side spectra of WASP-33 b, the second hottest known hot Jupiter. We\nused High-Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS; R $\\sim$ 165,000) in the wavelength\nrange of 0.62 -- 0.88 $\\mu$m with the Subaru telescope to obtain the day-side\nspectra of WASP-33 b. We suppress and correct the systematic effects of the\ninstrument, the telluric and stellar lines by using SYSREM algorithm after the\nselection of good orders based on Barnard star and other M-type stars. We\ndetect a 4.8-$\\sigma$ signal at an orbital velocity of $K_{p}$= +237.5\n$^{+13.0}_{-5.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ and systemic velocity $V_{sys}$= -1.5 $^{+4.0}\n_{-10.5}$ km s$^{-1}$, which agree with the derived values from the previous\nanalysis of primary transit. Our detection with the temperature inversion model\nimplies the existence of stratosphere in its atmosphere, however, we were\nunable to constrain the volume-mixing ratio of the detected TiO. We also\nmeasure the stellar radial velocity and use it to obtain a more stringent\nconstraint on the orbital velocity, $K_{p} = 239.0^{+2.0}_{-1.0}$ km s$^{-1}$.\nOur results demonstrate that high-dispersion spectroscopy is a powerful tool to\ncharacterize the atmosphere of an exoplanet, even in the optical wavelength\nrange, and show a promising potential in using and developing similar\ntechniques with high-dispersion spectrograph on current 10m-class and future\nextremely large telescopes.\n", "  Nanostructured palladium foams offer exciting potential for applications in\ndiverse fields such as catalyst, fuel cell, and particularly hydrogen storage\ntechnologies. We have fabricated palladium nanowire foams using a cross-linking\nand freeze-drying technique. These foams have a tunable density down to 0.1% of\nthe bulk, and a surface area to volume ratio of up to 1,540,000:1. They exhibit\nhighly attractive characteristics for hydrogen storage, in terms of loading\ncapacity, rate of absorption and heat of absorption. The hydrogen\nabsorption/desorption process is hysteretic in nature, accompanied by\nsubstantial lattice expansion/contraction as the foam converts between Pd and\nPdHx.\n", "  Cracks in brittle materials produce two types of generic surface structures:\nfacets at low velocities and micro-branches at higher ones. Here we observe a\ntransition from faceting to micro-branching in polyacrylamide gels that is\ncharacterized by nonlinear dynamic localization of crack fronts. To better\nunderstand this process we derive a first-principles nonlinear equation of\nmotion for crack fronts in the context of scalar elasticity. Its solution shows\nthat nonlinear focusing coupled to rate-dependence of dissipation governs the\ntransition to micro-branching.\n", "  We present observations in CO(3-2) that, combined with previous observations\nin CO(2-1), constrain the physical properties of the filamentary molecular gas\nin the central $\\sim$6.5 kpc of NGC 1275, the central giant elliptical galaxy\nof the Perseus cluster. We find this molecular gas to have a temperature\n$\\gtrsim 20$ K and a density $\\sim$$10^2$-$10^4 {\\rm \\ cm^{-3}}$, typically\nwarmer and denser than the bulk of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the Galaxy.\nBathed in the harsh radiation and particle field of the surrounding\nintracluster X-ray gas, the molecular gas likely has a much higher ionization\nfraction than that of GMCs. For an ionization fraction of $\\sim$$10^{-4}$,\nsimilar to that of Galactic diffuse ($\\lesssim 250 {\\rm \\ cm^{-3}}$)\npartially-molecular clouds that emit in HCN(1-0) and HCO$^+$(1-0), we show that\nthe same gas traced in CO can produce the previously reported emissions in\nHCN(3-2), HCO$^+$(3-2), and CN(2-1) from NGC 1275; the dominant source of\nexcitation for all the latter molecules is collisions with electrons. To\nprevent collapse, as evidenced by the lack of star formation in the molecular\nfilaments, they must consist of thin strands that have cross-sectional radii\n$\\lesssim$0.2-2 pc if supported solely by thermal gas pressure; larger radii\nare permissible if turbulence or poloidal magnetic fields provide additional\npressure support. We point out that the conditions required to relate CO\nluminosities to molecular gas masses in our Galaxy are unlikely to apply in\ncluster central elliptical galaxies. Rather than being virialized structures\nanalogous to GMCs, we propose that the molecular gas in NGC 1275 comprises\npressure-confined structures created by turbulent flows.\n", "  We combine low energy muon spin rotation (LE-$\\mu$SR) and soft-X-ray\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) to study the magnetic and\nelectronic properties of magnetically doped topological insulators,\n(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$. We find that one achieves a full magnetic volume fraction in\nsamples of (V/Cr)$_x$(Bi,Sb)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$ at doping levels x $\\gtrsim$ 0.16.\nThe observed magnetic transition is not sharp in temperature indicating a\ngradual magnetic ordering. We find that the evolution of magnetic ordering is\nconsistent with formation of ferromagnetic islands which increase in number\nand/or volume with decreasing temperature. Resonant ARPES at the V $L_3$ edge\nreveals a nondispersing impurity band close to the Fermi level as well as V\nweight integrated into the host band structure. Calculations within the\ncoherent potential approximation of the V contribution to the spectral function\nconfirm that this impurity band is caused by V in substitutional sites. The\nimplications of our results on the observation of the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect at mK temperatures are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we consider higher order corrections of the entropy, which\ncoming from thermal fluctuations, and find their effect on the thermodynamics\nof higher dimensional charged black holes. Leading order thermal fluctuation is\nlogarithmic term in the entropy while higher order correction is proportional\nto the inverse of original entropy. We calculate some thermodynamics quantities\nand obtain the effect of logarithmic and higher order corrections of entropy on\nthem. Validity of the first law of thermodynamics investigated and Van der\nWaals equation of state of dual picture studied. We find that five-dimensional\nblack hole behaves as Van der Waals, but higher dimensional case have not such\nbehavior. We find that thermal fluctuations are important in stability of black\nhole hence affect unstable/stable black hole phase transition.\n", "  Supernova driven winds are often invoked to remove chemically enriched gas\nfrom dwarf galaxies to match their low observed metallicities. In such shallow\npotential wells, outflows may produce massive amounts of enriched halo gas\n(circum-galactic medium or CGM) and pollute the intergalactic medium (IGM).\nHere, we present a survey of the CGM and IGM around 18 star-forming field\ndwarfs with stellar masses of $\\log\\,M_*/M_\\odot\\approx8-9$ at $z\\approx0.2$.\nEight of these have CGM probed by quasar absorption spectra at projected\ndistances, $d$, less than the host virial radius, $R_{\\rm h}$. Ten are probed\nin the surrounding IGM at $d/R_{\\rm h}=1-3$. The absorption measurements\ninclude neutral hydrogen, the dominant silicon ions for diffuse cool gas\n($T\\sim10^4$ K; Si II, Si III, and Si IV), moderately ionized carbon (C IV),\nand highly ionized oxygen (O VI). Metal absorption from the CGM of the dwarfs\nis less common and $\\approx4\\times$ weaker compared to massive star-forming\ngalaxies though O VI absorption is still common. None of the dwarfs probed at\n$d/R_{\\rm h}=1-3$ have definitive metal-line detections. Combining the\navailable silicon ions, we estimate that the cool CGM of the dwarfs accounts\nfor only $2-6\\%$ of the expected silicon budget from the yields of supernovae\nassociated with past star-formation. The highly ionized O VI accounts for\n$\\approx8\\%$ of the oxygen budget. As O VI traces an ion with expected\nequilibrium ion fractions of $\\lesssim 0.2$, the highly ionized CGM may\nrepresent a significant metal reservoir even for dwarfs not expected to\nmaintain gravitationally shock heated hot halos.\n", "  HD$\\,$169142 is an excellent target to investigate signs of planet-disk\ninteraction due to the previous evidence of gap structures. We performed J-band\n(~1.2{\\mu}m) polarized intensity imaging of HD169142 with VLT/SPHERE. We\nobserve polarized scattered light down to 0.16\" (~19 au) and find an inner gap\nwith a significantly reduced scattered light flux. We confirm the previously\ndetected double ring structure peaking at 0.18\" (~21 au) and 0.56\" (~66 au),\nand marginally detect a faint third gap at 0.70\"-0.73\" (~82-85 au). We explore\ndust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as\nmodels with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is\nable to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but\nfails to reproduce their depths. It, however, gives a good match with the ALMA\ndust continuum image at 1.3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size\ndistribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that\ndust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up\nof millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small\ngrains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation\nand dust diffusion in the dust trap. Alternatively, turbulence or charging\neffects might lead to a reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is\nnot affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense\ndisk midplane. The exploration of models shows that extracting planet\nproperties such as mass from observed gap profiles is highly degenerate.\n", "  We conduct a comprehensive set of tests of performance of surface coils used\nfor nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of quasi 2-dimensional samples. We\nreport ${^{115} \\rm{In}}$ and ${^{31} \\rm{P}}$ NMR measurements on InP,\nsemi-conducting thin substrate samples. Surface coils of both zig-zag\nmeander-line and concentric spiral geometries were used. We compare reception\nsensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of NMR signal obtained by using\nsurface-type coils to that obtained by standard solenoid-type coils. As\nexpected, we find that surface-type coils provide better sensitivity for NMR\nstudy of thin films samples. Moreover, we compare the reception sensitivity of\ndifferent types of the surface coils. We identify the optimal geometry of the\nsurface coils for a given application and/or direction of the applied magnetic\nfield.\n", "  The upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project is expected to provide\nunprecedented sensitivity in the low-energy (<~100 GeV) range for Cherenkov\ntelescopes. Most of the remaining background in this energy range results from\nmisidentified hadron showers. In order to fully exploit the potential of the\ntelescope systems it is worthwhile to look for ways to further improve the\navailable analysis methods for {\\gamma}/hadron separation. We study the\ncomposition of the background for the planned CTA-North array by identifying\nevents composed mostly of a single electromagnetic subcascade or double\nsubcascade from a {\\pi}0 (or another neutral meson) decay. We apply the\nstandard simulation chain and state-of-the-art analysis chain of CTA to\nevaluate the potential of the standard analysis to reject such events.\nSimulations show a dominant role of such single subcascade background for CTA\nup to energies ~70 GeV. We show that a natural way of rejection of such events\nstems from a shifted location of the shower maximum, and that the standard\nstereo reconstruction method used by CTA already exploits most of expected\nseparation.\n", "  A hidden Markov model (HMM) scheme for tracking continuous-wave gravitational\nradiation from neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) with wandering\nspin is extended by introducing a frequency-domain matched filter, called the\nJ-statistic, which sums the signal power in orbital sidebands coherently. The\nJ-statistic is similar but not identical to the binary-modulated F-statistic\ncomputed by demodulation or resampling. By injecting synthetic LMXB signals\ninto Gaussian noise characteristic of the Advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), it is shown that the\nJ-statistic HMM tracker detects signals with characteristic wave strain $h_0\n\\geq 2 \\times 10^{-26}$ in 370 d of data from two interferometers, divided into\n37 coherent blocks of equal length. When applied to data from Stage I of the\nScorpius X-1 Mock Data Challenge organised by the LIGO Scientific\nCollaboration, the tracker detects all 50 closed injections ($h_0 \\geq 6.84\n\\times 10^{-26}$), recovering the frequency with a root-mean-square accuracy of\n$\\leq 1.95\\times10^{-5}$ Hz. Of the 50 injections, 43 (with $h_0 \\geq 1.09\n\\times 10^{-25}$) are detected in a single, coherent 10-d block of data. The\ntracker employs an efficient, recursive HMM solver based on the Viterbi\nalgorithm, which requires $\\sim 10^5$ CPU-hours for a typical, broadband\n(0.5-kHz), LMXB search.\n", "  The mid-infrared (IR) range contains many spectral features associated with\nlarge molecules and dust grains such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\nand silicates. These are usually very strong compared to fine-structure gas\nlines, and thus valuable in studying the spectral properties of faint distant\ngalaxies. In this paper, we evaluate the capability of low-resolution mid-IR\nspectroscopic surveys of galaxies that could be performed by SPICA. The surveys\nare designed to address the question how star formation and black hole\naccretion activities evolved over cosmic time through spectral diagnostics of\nthe physical conditions of the interstellar/circumnuclear media in galaxies. On\nthe basis of results obtained with Herschel far-IR photometric surveys of\ndistant galaxies and Spitzer and AKARI near- to mid-IR spectroscopic\nobservations of nearby galaxies, we estimate the numbers of the galaxies at\nredshift z > 0.5, which are expected to be detected in the PAH features or dust\ncontinuum by a wide (10 deg^2) or deep (1 deg^2) blind survey, both for a given\nobservation time of 600 hours. As by-products of the wide blind survey, we also\nexpect to detect debris disks, through the mid-IR excess above the photospheric\nemission of nearby main-sequence stars, and we estimate their number. We\ndemonstrate that the SPICA mid-IR surveys will efficiently provide us with\nunprecedentedly large spectral samples, which can be studied further in the\nfar-IR with SPICA.\n", "  The properties of a transiting planet's host star are written in its transit\nlight curve. The light curve can reveal the stellar density and the limb\ndarkening profile in addition to the characteristics of the planet and its\norbit. For planets with strong prior constraints on orbital eccentricity, we\nmay measure these stellar properties directly from the light curve; this method\npromises to aid greatly in the characterization of transiting planet host stars\ntargeted by the upcoming NASA TESS mission and any long-period,\nsingly-transiting planets discovered in the same systems. Using Bayesian\ninference, we fit a transit model, including a nonlinear limb darkening law, to\n66 Kepler transiting planet hosts to measure their stellar properties. We\npresent posterior distributions of stellar density, limb-darkening\ncoefficients, and other system parameters for these stars. We measure densities\nto within 5% for the majority of our target stars, with the dominant\nprecision-limiting factor being the signal-to-noise ratio of the transits. 95 %\nof our measured stellar densities are in 3-sigma or better agreement with\npreviously published literature values. We make posterior distributions for all\nof our target KOIs available for online download.\n", "  Rapidly rotating neutron stars blow a relativistic, magnetized wind mainly\ncomposed of electron-positron pairs. The free expansion of the wind terminates\nfar from the neutron star where a weakly magnetized pulsar wind nebula forms,\nimplying efficient magnetic dissipation somewhere upstream. The wind current\nsheet that separates the two magnetic polarities is usually considered as the\nmost natural place for magnetic dissipation via relativistic reconnection, but\nits efficiency remains an open question. Here, the goal of this work is to\nrevisit this issue in light of the most recent progress in the understanding of\nreconnection and pulsar electrodynamics. We perform large two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations of the oblique rotator to capture the multi-scale\nevolution of the wind. We find that the current sheet breaks up into a\ndynamical chain of magnetic islands separated by secondary thin current sheets.\nThe sheet thickness increases linearly with radius while the Poynting flux\ndecreases monotonically as reconnection proceeds. The radius of complete\nannihilation of the stripes is given by the plasma multiplicity parameter at\nthe light cylinder. Current starvation within the sheets does not occur before\ncomplete dissipation as long as there is enough charges where the sheets form.\nParticles are efficiently heated up to a characteristic energy set by the\nmagnetization parameter at the light cylinder. Energetic pulsed synchrotron\nemission peaks close to the light cylinder, and presents sub-pulse variability\nassociated with the formation of plasmoids in the sheet. This study suggests\nthat the striped component of the wind dissipates far before reaching the\ntermination shock in isolated pulsars, even in very-high-multiplicity systems\nsuch as the Crab pulsar. Pulsars in binary systems may provide the best\nenvironments to study magnetic dissipation in the wind.\n", "  Nuclear reactions induced by muon neutrino with energies in the range from\n0.2 to 1.5 GeV in Monte Carlo calculations framework in the intra-nuclear\ncascade model are studied. This study was done by comparison between the\navailable experimental data and theoretical values of total cross section, and\nthe energy distribution of emitted lepton energy in the reaction muon\nneutrino-nucleus, using the targets: $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{27}$Al, $^{40}$Ar,\n$^{56}$Fe and $^{208}$Pb. A phenomenological toy model of primary\nneutrino-nucleon interaction gives a good agreement of our theoretical\ninclusive neutrino nucleus cross in comparison with the available experimental\ndata. Some interesting results on the behavior of the cross section as function\nof 1p-1n and higher contributions are also sketched. The previous results on\nthe percentage of fake events related in available experiments in $^{12}$C were\nexpanded for the set studied nuclei. With the increase of mass target, the\nnuclear effects in the cross sections were observed along with the importance\nto take into account fake events in the reactions.\n", "  We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm\ncontinuum upper limits for 5 planetary-mass companions DH Tau B, CT Cha B, GSC\n6214-210 B, 1RXS 1609 B, and GQ Lup B. Our survey, together with other ALMA\nstudies, have yielded null results for disks around young planet-mass\ncompanions and placed stringent dust mass upper limits, typically less than 0.1\nM_earth, when assuming dust continuum is optically thin. Such low-mass gas/dust\ncontent can lead to a disk lifetime estimate (from accretion rates) much\nshorter than the age of the system. To alleviate this timescale discrepancy, we\nsuggest that disks around wide companions might be very compact and optically\nthick, in order to sustain a few Myr of accretion yet have very weak\n(sub)millimeter flux so as to still be elusive to ALMA. Our order-of-magnitude\nestimate shows that compact optically-thick disks might be smaller than 1000\nR_jup and only emit ~micro-Jy of flux in the (sub)millimeter, but their average\ntemperature can be higher than that of circumstellar disks. The high disk\ntemperature could impede satellite formation, but it also suggests that mid- to\nfar-infrared might be more favorable than radio wavelengths to characterize\ndisk properties. Finally, the compact disk size might imply that dynamical\nencounters between the companion and the star, or any other scatterers in the\nsystem, play a role in the formation of planetary-mass companions.\n", "  Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are known to occur following solar\nflares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However some high-energy solar events\ndo not result in SEPs being detected at Earth, and it is these types of event\nwhich may be termed \"false alarms\".\n  We define two simple SEP forecasting algorithms based upon the occurrence of\na magnetically well-connected CME with a speed in excess of 1500 km/s (\"a fast\nCME\") or a well-connected X-class flare and analyse them with respect to\nhistorical data sets. We compare the parameters of those solar events which\nproduced an enhancement of >40 MeV protons at Earth (\"an SEP event\") and the\nfalse alarms. We find that an SEP forecasting algorithm based solely upon the\noccurrence of a well-connected fast CME produces fewer false alarms (28.8%)\nthan one based solely upon a well-connected X-class flare (50.6%). Both\nalgorithms fail to forecast a relatively high percentage of SEP events (53.2%\nand 50.6% respectively). Our analysis of the historical data sets shows that\nfalse alarm X-class flares were either not associated with any CME, or were\nassociated with a CME slower than 500 km/s; false alarm fast CMEs tended to be\nassociated with flares of class less than M3.\n  A better approach to forecasting would be an algorithm which takes as its\nbase the occurrence of both CMEs and flares. We define a new forecasting\nalgorithm which uses a combination of CME and flare parameters and show that\nthe false alarm ratio is similar to that for the algorithm based upon fast CMEs\n(29.6%), but the percentage of SEP events not forecast is reduced to 32.4%.\nLists of the solar events which gave rise to >40 MeV protons and the false\nalarms have been derived and are made available to aid further study.\n", "  Given the forthcoming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) which\nwill allow observ- ing exoplanet atmospheres with unprecedented\nsignal-over-noise ratio, spectral coverage and spatial resolution, the\nuncertainties in the atmosphere modelling used to interpret the data need to be\nas- sessed. As the first step, we compare three independent 1D\nradiative-convective models: ATMO, Exo-REM and petitCODE. We identify\ndifferences in physical and chemical processes taken into ac- count thanks to a\nbenchmark protocol we developed. We study the impact of these differences on\nthe analysis of observable spectra. We show the importance of selecting\ncarefully relevant molecular linelists to compute the atmospheric opacity.\nIndeed, differences between spectra calculated with Hitran and ExoMol exceed\nthe expected uncertainties of future JWST observations. We also show the\nlimitation in the precision of the models due to uncertainties on alkali and\nmolecule lineshape, which induce spectral effects also larger than the expected\nJWST uncertainties. We compare two chemical models, Exo-REM and Venot Chemical\nCode, which do not lead to significant differences in the emission or\ntransmission spectra. We discuss the observational consequences of using\nequilibrium or out-of- equilibrium chemistry and the major impact of phosphine,\ndetectable with the JWST.Each of the models has benefited from the benchmarking\nactivity and has been updated. The protocol developed in this paper and the\nonline results can constitute a test case for other models.\n", "  The delay in the arrival times between high and low energy photons from\ncosmic sources can be used to test the violation of the Lorentz invariance\n(LIV), predicted by some quantum gravity theories, and to constrain its\ncharacteristic energy scale ${\\rm E_{QG}}$ that is of the order of the Planck\nenergy. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars are ideal for this purpose thanks\nto their broad spectral energy distribution and cosmological distances: at\nfirst order approximation, the constraints on ${\\rm E_{QG}}$ are proportional\nto the photon energy separation and the distance of the source. However, the\nLIV tiny contribution to the total time delay can be dominated by intrinsic\ndelays related to the physics of the sources: long GRBs typically show a delay\nbetween high and low energy photons related to their spectral evolution\n(spectral lag). Short GRBs have null intrinsic spectral lags and are therefore\nan ideal tool to measure any LIV effect. We considered a sample of $15$ short\nGRBs with known redshift observed by Swift and we estimate a limit on ${\\rm\nE_{QG}}\\gtrsim 1.5\\times 10^{16}$ GeV. Our estimate represents an improvement\nwith respect to the limit obtained with a larger (double) sample of long GRBs\nand is more robust than the estimates on single events because it accounts for\nthe intrinsic delay in a statistical sense.\n", "  We report the first high spectral resolution study of 17 M giants\nkinematically confirmed to lie within a few parsecs of the Galactic Center,\nusing R=24,000 spectroscopy from Keck/NIRSPEC and a new linelist for the\ninfrared K band. We consider their luminosities and kinematics, which classify\nthese stars as members of the older stellar population and the central cluster.\nWe find a median metallicity of <[Fe/H]>=-0.16 and a large spread from\napproximately -0.3 to +0.3 (quartiles). We find that the highest metallicities\nare [Fe/H]<+0.6, with most of the stars being at or below the Solar iron\nabundance. The abundances and the abundance distribution strongly resembles\nthat of the Galactic bulge rather than disk or halo; in our small sample we\nfind no statistical evidence for a dependence of velocity dispersion on\nmetallicity.\n", "  Solar active regions (ARs) that produce strong flares and coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) are known to have a relatively high non-potentiality and are\ncharacterized by delta-sunspots and sheared magnetic structures. In this study,\nwe conduct a series of flux emergence simulations from the convection zone to\nthe corona and model four types of active regions that have been\nobservationally suggested to cause strong flares, namely the Spot-Spot,\nSpot-Satellite, Quadrupole, and Inter-AR cases. As a result, we confirm that\ndelta-spot formation is due to the complex geometry and interaction of emerging\nmagnetic fields, with finding that the strong-field, high-gradient,\nhighly-sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) is created by the combined effect\nof the advection, stretching, and compression of magnetic fields. We show that\nfree magnetic energy builds up in the form of a current sheet above the PIL. It\nis also revealed that photospheric magnetic parameters that predict flare\neruptions reflect the stored free energy with high accuracy, while\nCME-predicting parameters indicate the magnetic relationship between flaring\nzones and entire ARs.\n", "  We investigate dynamical and radiative properties of arc-shaped gas clouds\nfalling onto a stellar mass black hole based on the three-dimensional general\nrelativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (3D-GRRMHD) simulation data.\nAssuming that the gas clouds radiate due mainly to the free-free emission\nand/or optically thick, inverse Compton scattering, we calculate how the\nemissivity distributions develop with time. We find that (1) gas clouds, each\nof which has a ring-like or arc shape, are intermittently formed, and that (2)\nthey slowly fall to the black hole, keeping nearly the Keplerian orbital\nvelocity. These features support the dynamical properties of the gas clouds\nassumed in the spin measurement method proposed by Moriyama & Mineshige 2015,\nbut the radius of the inner edge of the accretion disk is larger than that of\nthe marginally stable orbit (ISCO). Next, we examine how each gas cloud is\nobserved by a distant observer by calculating the photon trajectories in the\nblack hole space-time. The luminosity of the accretion flow exhibits\nsignificant time variations on different timescales, reflecting the time\nevolution of the gas density distributions. The relatively slow variations on\nthe time durations of 0.08-0.10 sec is due to the formation and fall of gas\nclouds, while quasi-periodic flux peaks with short time intervals (0.01 sec)\nare due to the quasi-periodic enhancement of light from the non-axisymmetric\narc-shaped clouds through the beaming effect. This may account for the\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in black hole\nbinaries. The observational implications and future issues are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We investigate the contribution of outer HI disks to the observable\npopulation of merging black hole binaries. Like dwarf galaxies, the outer HI\ndisks of spirals have low star formation rates and lower metallicities than the\ninner disks of spirals. Since low-metallicity star formation can produce more\ndetectable compact binaries than typical star formation, the environments in\nthe outskirts of spiral galaxies may be conducive to producing a rich\npopulation of massive binary black holes. We consider here both detailed\ncontrolled simulations of spirals and cosmological simulations, as well as the\ncurrent range of observed values for metallicity and star formation in outer\ndisks. We find that outer HI disks contribute at least as much as dwarf\ngalaxies do to the observed LIGO/Virgo detection rates. Identifying the host\ngalaxies of merging massive black holes should provide constraints on\ncosmological parameters and insights into the formation channels of binary\nmergers.\n", "  We report ALMA observations of $^{12}$CO(3-2) and $^{13}$CO(3-2) in the\ngas-poor dwarf galaxy NGC 5253. These 0.3\"(5.5 pc) resolution images reveal\nsmall, dense molecular gas clouds that are located in kinematically distinct,\nextended filaments. Some of the filaments appear to be falling into the galaxy\nand may be fueling its current star formation. The most intense CO(3-2)\nemission comes from the central $\\sim$100 pc region centered on the luminous\nradio-infrared HII region known as the supernebula. The CO(3-2) clumps within\nthe starburst region are anti-correlated with H$\\alpha$ on $\\sim$5 pc scales,\nbut are well-correlated with radio free-free emission. Cloud D1, which\nenshrouds the supernebula, has a high $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio, as does\nanother cloud within the central 100 pc starburst region, possibly because the\nclouds are hot. CO(3-2) emission alone does not allow determination of cloud\nmasses as molecular gas temperature and column density are degenerate at the\nobserved brightness, unless combined with other lines such as $^{13}$CO.\n", "  We study Dirac quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter\n(Schwarzschild-AdS) black holes, following the generic principle for allowed\nboundary conditions proposed in \\cite{PhysRevD.92.124006}. After deriving the\nequations of motion for Dirac fields on the aforementioned background, we\nimpose vanishing energy flux boundary conditions to solve these equations. We\nfind a set of two Robin boundary conditions are allowed. These two boundary\nconditions are used to calculate Dirac normal modes on empty AdS and\nquasinormal modes on Schwarzschild-AdS black holes. In the former case, we\nrecover the known normal modes of empty AdS; in the latter case, the two sets\nof Robin boundary conditions lead to two different branches of quasinormal\nmodes. The impact on these modes of the black hole size, the angular momentum\nquantum number and the overtone number are discussed. Our results show that\nvanishing energy flux boundary conditions are a robust principle, applicable\nnot only to bosonic fields but also to fermionic fields.\n", "  Analyses of strong gravitational lenses, galaxy-scale kinematics, and\nabsorption line stellar population synthesis (SPS) have all concluded that the\nstellar initial mass function (IMF) varies within the massive early-type galaxy\n(ETG) population. However, the physical mechanism that drives variation in the\nIMF is an outstanding question. Here we use new SPS models to consider a\ndiverse set of compact, low-velocity dispersion stellar systems: globular\nclusters (GCs), an ultra-compact dwarf (UCD), and the compact elliptical (cE)\ngalaxy M32. We compare our results to massive ETGs and available dynamical\nmeasurements. We find that the GCs have stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) that\nare either consistent with a Kroupa IMF or are slightly bottom-light while the\nUCD and cE have mildly elevated M/L. The separation in derived IMFs for systems\nwith similar metallicities and abundance patterns indicates that our SPS models\ncan distinguish abundance and IMF effects. Variation among the sample in this\npaper is only $\\sim 50\\%$ in normalized M/L compared to the $\\sim 4\\times$\namong the ETG sample. This suggests that metallicity is not the sole driver of\nIMF variability and additional parameters need to be considered.\n", "  Quantum algorithms use the principles of quantum mechanics, as for example\nquantum superposition, in order to solve particular problems outperforming\nstandard computation. They are developed for cryptography, searching,\noptimisation, simulation and solving large systems of linear equations. Here,\nwe implement Grover's quantum algorithm, proposed to find an element in an\nunsorted list, using a single nuclear 3/2-spin carried by a Single Molecular\nMagnet (SMM) transistor. The coherent manipulation of this multi-level qudit is\nachieved by means of electric fields only. Grover's search algorithm was\nimplemented by constructing a quantum database via a multi-level Hadamard gate.\nThe Grover sequence then allows us to select each state. The presented method\nis of universal character and can be implemented in any multi-level quantum\nsystem with non-equal spaced energy levels, opening the way to novel quantum\nsearch algorithms.\n", "  We test the hypothesis that limitations in the sky model used to calibrate an\ninterferometric radio telescope, where the model contains extended radio\nsources, will generate bias in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum.\nThe information contained in a calibration model about the spatial and spectral\nstructure of an extended source is incomplete because a radio telescope cannot\nsample all Fourier components. Application of an incomplete sky model to\ncalibration of EoR data will imprint residual error in the data, which\npropagates forward to the EoR power spectrum. This limited information is\nstudied in the context of current and future planned instruments and surveys at\nEoR frequencies, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low). For the MWA\nEoR experiment, we find that both the additional short baseline $uv$-coverage\nof the compact EoR array, and the additional long baselines provided by TGSS\nand planned MWA expansions, are required to obtain sufficient information on\nall relevant scales. For SKA1-Low, arrays with maximum baselines of 49~km and\n65~km yield comparable performance at 50~MHz and 150~MHz, while 39~km, 14~km\nand 4~km arrays yield degraded performance.\n", "  We consider the long-term evolution of gaseous disks fed by the vaporization\nof small particles produced in a collisional cascade inside the Roche limit of\na 0.6 Msun white dwarf. Adding solids with radius \\r0\\ at a constant rate\n$\\dot{M}_0$ into a narrow annulus leads to two distinct types of evolution.\nWhen $\\dot{M}_0 > \\dot{M}_{0,crit}$ = $3 \\times 10^4 ~ (r_0 / {\\rm\n1~km})^{3.92}$~g s$^{-1}$, the cascade generates a fairly steady accretion disk\nwhere the mass transfer rate of gas onto the white dwarf is roughly $\\dot{M}_0$\nand the mass in gas is $M_g \\approx 2.3 \\times 10^{22} ~ (\\dot{M}_0 /\n10^{10}~g~s^{-1}) ~ ({\\rm 1500~K} / T_0) ~ (10^{-3} / \\alpha)$~g, where $T_0$\nis the temperature of the gas near the Roche limit and $\\alpha$ is the\ndimensionless viscosity parameter. If $ \\dot{M}_0 < \\dot{M}_{0,crit}$, the\nsystem alternates between high states with large mass transfer rates and low\nstates with negligible accretion. Although either mode of evolution adds\nsignificant amounts of metals to the white dwarf photosphere, none of our\ncalculations yield a vertically thin ensemble of solids inside the Roche limit.\nX-ray observations can place limits on the mass transfer rate and test this\nmodel for metallic line white dwarfs.\n", "  We provide, for the first time, robust observational constraints on the\ngalaxy major merger fraction up to $z\\approx 6$ using spectroscopic close pair\ncounts. Deep Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations in the\nHubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S) are used to\nidentify 113 secure close pairs of galaxies among a parent sample of 1801\ngalaxies spread over a large redshift range ($0.2<z<6$) and stellar masses\n($10^7-10^{11} M_\\odot$), thus probing about 12 Gyr of galaxy evolution.\nStellar masses are estimated from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting\nover the extensive UV-to-NIR HST photometry available in these deep Hubble\nfields, adding Spitzer IRAC bands to better constrain masses for high-redshift\n($z\\geqslant 3$) galaxies. These stellar masses are used to isolate a sample of\n54 major close pairs with a galaxy mass ratio limit of 1:6. Among this sample,\n23 pairs are identified at high redshift ($z\\geqslant 3$) through their\nLy$\\alpha$ emission. The sample of major close pairs is divided into five\nredshift intervals in order to probe the evolution of the merger fraction with\ncosmic time. Our estimates are in very good agreement with previous close pair\ncounts with a constant increase of the merger fraction up to $z\\approx 3$ where\nit reaches a maximum of 20%. At higher redshift, we show that the fraction\nslowly decreases down to about 10% at $z\\approx6$. The sample is further\ndivided into two ranges of stellar masses using either a constant separation\nlimit of $10^{9.5} M_\\odot$ or the median value of stellar mass computed in\neach redshift bin. Overall, the major close pair fraction for low-mass and\nmassive galaxies follows the same trend.\n  These new, homogeneous, and robust estimates of the major merger fraction\nsince $z\\approx6$ are in good agreement with recent predictions of cosmological\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Galaxy mergers are capable of triggering both star formation and active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and therefore may represent an important pathway in the\nco-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However,\ncorrelated enhancements of merger-induced star formation and AGN triggering may\nbe hidden by the variable conditions and timescales during which they occur. In\nPaper I, we presented evidence of merger-triggered AGN in a sample of six\nlate-stage galaxy mergers (2-8 kpc nuclear separations). In this follow-up\nwork, we use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope imaging and additional\narchival data to examine their star-forming properties to test for\nmerger-triggered star formation, and if it is correlated with SMBH growth. We\nfind that the morphological asymmetries are correlated with enhanced specific\nstar formation rates, indicating the presence of merger-triggered star\nformation. Additionally, the stellar populations become younger with increasing\nradius from the nucleus, indicating that the merger-induced star formation\nprimarily occurs on global scales. However, we also find that the star\nformation rate enhancements are consistent with or lower than those of larger\nseparation galaxy pair samples. This result is consistent with simulations\npredicting a decline of the global star formation rates in late-stage galaxy\nmergers with <10 kpc nuclear separations. Finally, we find that enhancements in\nspecific star formation rate and AGN luminosity are positively correlated, but\nthat an average temporal delay of >10^8 yrs likely exists between the peak of\nglobal star formation and the onset of AGN triggering in 80% of the systems.\n", "  Proxima Centauri, the star closest to our Sun, is known to host at least one\nterrestrial planet candidate in a temperate orbit. Here we report the ALMA\ndetection of the star at 1.3 mm wavelength and the discovery of a belt of dust\norbiting around it at distances ranging between 1 and 4 au, approximately.\nGiven the low luminosity of the Proxima Centauri star, we estimate a\ncharacteristic temperature of about 40 K for this dust, which might constitute\nthe dust component of a small-scale analog to our solar system Kuiper belt. The\nestimated total mass, including dust and bodies up to 50 km in size, is of the\norder of 0.01 Earth masses, which is similar to that of the solar Kuiper belt.\nOur data also show a hint of warmer dust closer to the star. We also find signs\nof two additional features that might be associated with the Proxima Centauri\nsystem, which, however, still require further observations to be confirmed: an\nouter extremely cold (about 10 K) belt around the star at about 30 au, whose\norbital plane is tilted about 45 degrees with respect to the plane of the sky;\nand additionally, we marginally detect a compact 1.3 mm emission source at a\nprojected distance of about 1.2 arcsec from the star, whose nature is still\nunknown.\n", "  The Galactic Center is the nuclear region of the nearest spiral galaxy, Milky\nWay, and contains the supermassive black hole with M~4x10^6 Msun, Sagittarius\nA* (Sgr A*). One of basic questions about the Galactic Center is whether Sgr A*\nalone exists as a \"massive\" black hole in the region or not. The IRS13E complex\nis a very intriguing IR object which contains a large dark mass comparable to\nthe mass of an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) from the proper motions of\nthe main member stars. However, the existence of the IMBH remains\ncontroversial. There are some objections to accepting the existence of the\nIMBH. In this study, we detected ionized gas with a very large velocity width\n(Delta v_{FWZI} ~ 650 km/s) and a very compact size (~400 AU) in the complex\nusing ALMA. We also found an extended component connecting with the compact\nionized gas. The properties suggest that this would be an ionized gas flow on\nthe Keplerian orbit with high eccentricity. The enclosed mass is estimated to\nbe 10^4 Msun by the analysis of the orbit. The mass does not conflict with the\nupper limit mass of the IMBH around Sgr A* which is derived by the long-term\nastrometry with VLBA. In addition, the object probably has an X-ray\ncounterpart. Consequently, a very fascinated possibility is that the detected\nionized gas is rotating around an IMBH embedded in the IRS13E complex.\n", "  Strongly interacting many-body systems consisting of fermions or bosons can\nhost exotic quasiparticles with anyonic statistics. Here, we demonstrate that\nmany-body systems of anyons can also form anyonic quasi-particles. The charge\nand statistics of the emergent anyons can be different from those of the\noriginal anyons.\n", "  Precise and, if possible, accurate characterization of exoplanets cannot be\ndissociated from the characterization of their host stars. In this chapter we\ndiscuss different methods and techniques used to derive fundamental properties\nand atmospheric parameters of exoplanet-host stars. The main limitations,\nadvantages and disadvantages, as well as corresponding typical measurement\nuncertainties of each method are presented.\n", "  In recent years, astronomers have witnessed major progresses in the field of\nstellar physics. This was made possible thanks to the combination of a solid\ntheoretical understanding of the phenomena of stellar pulsations and the\navailability of a tremendous amount of exquisite space-based asteroseismic\ndata. In this context, this chapter reviews the basic theory of stellar\npulsations, considering small, adiabatic perturbations to a static, spherically\nsymmetric equilibrium. It starts with a brief discussion of the solar\noscillation spectrum, followed by the setting of the theoretical problem,\nincluding the presentation of the equations of hydrodynamics, their\nperturbation, and a discussion of the functional form of the solutions.\nEmphasis is put on the physical properties of the different types of modes, in\nparticular acoustic (p-) and gravity (g-) modes and their propagation cavities.\nThe surface (f-) mode solutions are also discussed. While not attempting to be\ncomprehensive, it is hoped that the summary presented in this chapter addresses\nthe most important theoretical aspects that are required for a solid start in\nstellar pulsations research.\n", "  Over the past decade asteroseismology has become a powerful method to\nsystematically characterize host stars and dynamical architectures of exoplanet\nsystems. In this contribution I review current key synergies between\nasteroseismology and exoplanetary science such as the precise determination of\nplanet radii and ages, the measurement of orbital eccentricities, stellar\nobliquities and their impact on hot Jupiter formation theories, and the\nimportance of asteroseismology on spectroscopic analyses of exoplanet hosts. I\nalso give an outlook on future synergies such as the characterization of\nsub-Neptune-size planets orbiting solar-type stars, the study of planet\npopulations orbiting evolved stars, and the determination of ages of\nintermediate-mass stars hosting directly imaged planets.\n", "  A unitary description for wobbling motion in even-even and even-odd nuclei is\npresented. In both cases compact formulas for wobbling frequencies are derived.\nThe accuracy of the harmonic approximation is studied for the yrast as well as\nfor the excited bands in the even-even case. Important results for the\nstructure of the wave function and its behavior inside the two wells of the\npotential energy function corresponding to the Bargmann representation are\npointed out. Applications to $^{158}$Er and $^{163}$Lu reveal a very good\nagreement with available data. Indeed, the yrast energy levels in the even-even\ncase and the first four triaxial super-deformed bands, TSD1,TSD2,TSD3 and TSD4,\nare realistically described. Also, the results agree with the data for the E2\nand M1 intra- as well as inter-band transitions. Perspectives for the formalism\ndevelopment and an extensive application to several nuclei from various regions\nof the nuclides chart are presented.\n", "  The solar wind undergoes significant heating as it propagates away from the\nSun; the exact mechanisms responsible for this heating are not yet fully\nunderstood. We present for the first time a statistical test for one of the\nproposed mechanisms, stochastic ion heating. We use the amplitude of magnetic\nfield fluctuations near the proton gyroscale as a proxy for the ratio of\ngyroscale velocity fluctuations to perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic\nfield) proton thermal speed, defined as $\\epsilon_p$. Enhanced proton\ntemperatures are observed when $\\epsilon_p$ is larger than a critical value\n($\\sim 0.019 - 0.025$). This enhancement strongly depends on the proton plasma\nbeta ($\\beta_{||p}$); when $\\beta_{||p} \\ll 1$ only the perpendicular proton\ntemperature $T_{\\perp}$ increases, while for $\\beta_{||p} \\sim 1$ increased\nparallel and perpendicular proton temperatures are both observed. For\n$\\epsilon_p$ smaller than the critical value and $\\beta_{||p} \\ll 1$ no\nenhancement of $T_p$ is observed while for $\\beta_{||p} \\sim 1$ minor increases\nin $T_{\\parallel}$ are measured. The observed change of proton temperatures\nacross a critical threshold for velocity fluctuations is in agreement with the\nstochastic ion heating model of Chandran et al. (2010). We find that\n$\\epsilon_p > \\epsilon_{\\rm crit}$ in 76\\% of the studied periods implying that\nstochastic heating may operate most of the time in the solar wind at 1 AU.\n", "  The quest for Earth-like, extrasolar planets (exoplanets), especially those\nlocated inside the habitable zone of their host stars, requires techniques\nsensitive enough to detect the faint signals produced by those planets. The\nradial velocity (RV) and photometric transit methods are the most widely used\nand also the most efficient methods for detecting and characterizing\nexoplanets. However, presence of astrophysical \"noise\" makes it difficult to\ndetect and accurately characterize exoplanets. It is important to note that the\namplitude of such astrophysical noise is larger than both the signal of\nEarth-like exoplanets and state-of-the-art instrumentation limit precision,\nmaking this a pressing topic that needs to be addressed. In this chapter, I\npresent a general review of the main sources of noise in photometric and RV\nobservations, namely, stellar oscillations, granulation, and magnetic activity.\nMoreover, for each noise source I discuss the techniques and observational\nstrategies which allow us to mitigate their impact.\n", "  Plastino, Rocca and Pennini [Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{94} (2016) 012145] recently\nstated that the R\\'enyi entropy is not suitable for thermodynamics by using\nfunctional calculus, since it leads to anomalous results unlike the Tsallis\nentropy. We first show that the Tsallis entropy also leads to such anomalous\nbehaviours if one adopts the same functional calculus approach. Second, we note\nthat one of the Lagrange multipliers is set in an \\textit{ad-hoc} manner in the\nfunctional calculus approach of Plastino, Rocca and Pennini. Finally, the\nexplanation for these anomalous behaviours is provided by observing that the\ngeneralized distributions obtained by Plastino, Rocca and Pennini does not\nyield the ordinary canonical partition function in the appropriate limit and\ntherefore cannot be considered as genuine generalized distributions.\n", "  Stellar seismic inversions have proved to be a powerful technique for probing\nthe internal structure of stars, and paving the way for a better understanding\nof the underlying physics by revealing some of the shortcomings in current\nstellar models. In this lecture, we provide an introduction to this topic by\nexplaining kernel-based inversion techniques. Specifically, we explain how\nvarious kernels are obtained from the pulsation equations, and describe\ninversion techniques such as the Regularised Least-Squares (RLS) and Optimally\nLocalised Averages (OLA) methods.\n", "  The technical aspects in the use of an Equivalent Width (EW) method are\ndescribed for the derivation of spectroscopic stellar parameters with\nARES+MOOG. While the science description behind this method can be found in\nmany references, here the goal is to provide a user manual approach for the\ncodes and scripts presented in for the tutorial. All the required data is\navailable online (https://github.com/sousasag/school_codes).\n", "  The goal of AIMS (Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale) is to estimate\nstellar parameters and credible intervals/error bars in a Bayesian manner from\na set of asteroseismic frequency data and so-called classical constraints. To\nachieve reliable parameter estimates and computational efficiency, it searches\nthrough a grid of pre-computed models using an MCMC algorithm -- interpolation\nwithin the grid of models is performed by first tessellating the grid using a\nDelaunay triangulation and then doing a linear barycentric interpolation on\nmatching simplexes. Inputs for the modelling consist of individual frequencies\nfrom peak-bagging, which can be complemented with classical spectroscopic\nconstraints. AIMS is mostly written in Python with a modular structure to\nfacilitate contributions from the community. Only a few computationally\nintensive parts have been rewritten in Fortran in order to speed up\ncalculations.\n", "  A practical guide is presented to some of the main data analysis concepts and\ntechniques employed contemporarily in the asteroseismic study of stars\nexhibiting solar-like oscillations. The subjects of digital signal processing\nand spectral analysis are introduced first. These concern the acquisition of\ncontinuous physical signals to be subsequently digitally analyzed. A number of\nspecific concepts and techniques relevant to asteroseismology are then\npresented as we follow the typical workflow of the data analysis process,\nnamely, the extraction of global asteroseismic parameters and individual mode\nparameters (also known as peak-bagging) from the oscillation spectrum.\n", "  Chondrules are the dominant bulk silicate constituent of chondritic\nmeteorites and originate from highly energetic, local processes during the\nfirst million years after the birth of the Sun. So far, an astrophysically\nconsistent chondrule formation scenario, explaining major chemical, isotopic\nand textural features, remains elusive. Here, we examine the prospect of\nforming chondrules from planetesimal collisions. We show that intensely melted\nbodies with interior magma oceans became rapidly chemically equilibrated and\nphysically differentiated. Therefore, collisional interactions among such\nbodies would have resulted in chondrule-like but basaltic spherules, which are\nnot observed in the meteoritic record. This inconsistency with the expected\ndynamical interactions hints at an incomplete understanding of the planetary\ngrowth regime during the protoplanetary disk phase. To resolve this conundrum,\nwe examine how the observed chemical and isotopic features of chondrules\nconstrain the dynamical environment of accreting chondrite parent bodies by\ninterpreting the meteoritic record as an impact-generated proxy of\nplanetesimals that underwent repeated collision and reaccretion cycles. Using a\ncoupled evolution-collision model we demonstrate that the vast majority of\ncollisional debris feeding the asteroid main belt must be derived from\nplanetesimals which were partially molten at maximum. Therefore, the precursors\nof chondrite parent bodies either formed primarily small, from sub-canonical\naluminum-26 reservoirs, or collisional destruction mechanisms were efficient\nenough to shatter planetesimals before they reached the magma ocean phase.\nFinally, we outline the window in parameter space for which chondrule formation\nfrom planetesimal collisions can be reconciled with the meteoritic record and\nhow our results can be used to further constrain early solar system dynamics.\n", "  The stellar record of elemental abundances in satellite galaxies is important\nto identify the origin of r-process because such a small stellar system could\nhave hosted a single r-process event, which would distinguish member stars that\nare formed before and after the event through the evidence of a considerable\ndifference in the abundances of r-process elements, as found in the ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxy Reticulum II (Ret II). However, the limited mass of these systems\nprevents us from collecting information from a sufficient number of stars in\nindividual satellites. Hence, it remains unclear whether the discovery of a\nremarkable r-process enrichment event in Ret II explains the nature of\nr-process abundances or is an exception. We perform high-resolution\nspectroscopic measurements of r-process abundances for twelve metal-poor stars\nin the Draco dwarf galaxy in the metallicity range of -2.5<[Fe/H]<-2. We found\nthat these stars are separated into two groups with r-process abundances\ndiffering by one order of magnitude. A group of stars with high abundances of\nr-process elements was formed by a single r-process event that corresponds to\nthe event evidenced in Ret II. On the other hand, the low r-process abundance\ngroup was formed by another sporadic enrichment channel producing a far fewer\nr-process elements, which is clearly identified for the first time.\nAccordingly, we identified two populations of stars with different r-process\nabundances, which are built by two r-process events that enriched gases at\nlevels that differ by more than one order of magnitude.\n", "  Red-giant stars are low- to intermediate-mass ($M \\lesssim 10$~M$_{\\odot}$)\nstars that have exhausted hydrogen in the core. These extended, cool and hence\nred stars are key targets for stellar evolution studies as well as galactic\nstudies for several reasons: a) many stars go through a red-giant phase; b) red\ngiants are intrinsically bright; c) large stellar internal structure changes as\nwell as changes in surface chemical abundances take place over relatively short\ntime; d) red-giant stars exhibit global intrinsic oscillations. Due to their\nlarge number and intrinsic brightness it is possible to observe many of these\nstars up to large distances. Furthermore, the global intrinsic oscillations\nprovide a means to discern red-giant stars in the pre-helium core burning from\nthe ones in the helium core burning phase and provide an estimate of stellar\nages, a key ingredient for galactic studies. In this lecture I will first\ndiscuss some physical phenomena that play a role in red-giant stars and several\nphases of red-giant evolution. Then, I will provide some details about\nasteroseismology -- the study of the internal structure of stars through their\nintrinsic oscillations -- of red-giant stars. I will conclude by discussing\ngalactic archaeology -- the study of the formation and evolution of the Milky\nWay by reconstructing its past from its current constituents -- and the role\nred-giant stars can play in that.\n", "  We present the physical properties of the eclipsing binary V2281 Cyg, which\nshows a light-time effect due to a supposed tertiary component from its eclipse\ntiming variation according to the $Kepler$ observations. The high-resolution\nspectra and $BVR$ photometric data of the system were obtained at Bohyunsan\nOptical Astronomy Observatory and Mount Lemmon Optical Astronomy Observatory,\nrespectively. To determine the fundamental parameters of the eclipsing pair and\nits circumbinary object, we simultaneously analyzed the radial velocities,\nlight curves, and eclipse times including the $Kepler$ data. The masses and\nradii for the primary and secondary stars were determined with accuracy levels\nof approximately 2\\% and 1\\%, respectively, as follows: $M_{1} = 1.61 \\pm 0.04$\nM$_\\odot$ and $M_{2} = 1.60 \\pm 0.04$ M$_\\odot$, $R_{1} = 1.94 \\pm 0.02$\nR$_\\odot$ and $R_{2} = 1.93 \\pm 0.02$ R$_\\odot$. If its orbit is coplanar with\nthe eclipsing binary, the period and semimajor axis of the third body were\ncalculated to be $P_{3b}=4.1$ years and $a_{3b}=4.06$ au, respectively, and its\nmass is $M_{3b}=0.75$ M$_\\odot$. The evolutionary state of the system was\ninvestigated by comparing the masses and radii with theoretical models. The\nresults demonstrate that V2281 Cyg is a detached eclipsing binary, which\nconsists of twin main-sequence stars with an age of 1.5 Gyr.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate mechanical\nproperties and porous structure of binary glasses subjected to steady shear.\nThe model vitreous systems were prepared via thermal quench at constant volume\nto a temperature well below the glass transition. The quiescent samples are\ncharacterized by a relatively narrow pore size distribution whose mean size is\nlarger at lower glass densities. We find that in the linear regime of\ndeformation, the shear modulus is a strong function of porosity, and the\nindividual pores become slightly stretched while their structural topology\nremains unaffected. By contrast, with further increasing strain, the shear\nstress saturates to a density-dependent plateau value, which is accompanied by\npore coalescence and a gradual development of a broader pore size distribution\nwith a discrete set of peaks at large length scales.\n", "  The emission of a charged light lepton pair by a superluminal neutrino has\nbeen identified as a major factor in the energy loss of highly energetic\nneutrinos. The observation of PeV neutrinos by IceCube implies their stability\nagainst lepton pair Cerenkov radiation. Under the assumption of a\nLorentz-violating dispersion relation for highly energetic superluminal\nneutrinos, one may thus constrain the Lorentz-violating parameters. A\nkinematically different situation arises when one assumes a Lorentz-covariant,\nspace-like dispersion relation for hypothetical tachyonic neutrinos, as an\nalternative to Lorentz-violating theories. We here discuss a hitherto neglected\ndecay process, where a highly energetic tachyonic neutrinos may emit other\n(space-like, tachyonic) neutrino pairs. We find that the space-like dispersion\nrelation implies the absence of a q^2 threshold for the production of a\ntachyonic neutrino-antineutrino pair, thus leading to the dominant additional\nenergy loss mechanism for an oncoming tachyonic neutrino in the medium-energy\ndomain. Surprisingly, the small absolute value of the decay rate and energy\nloss rate in the tachyonic model imply that these models, in contrast to the\nLorentz-violating theories, are not pressured by the cosmic PeV neutrinos\nregistered by the IceCube collaboration.\n", "  This work reports on two related investigations of stochastic simulations\nwhich are widely used to study biodiversity and other related issues. We first\ndeal with the behavior of the Hamming distance under the increase of the number\nof species and the size of the lattice, and then investigate how the mobility\nof the species contributes to jeopardize biodiversity. The investigations are\nbased on the standard rules of reproduction, mobility and predation or\ncompetition, which are described by specific rules, guided by generalization of\nthe rock-paper-scissors game, valid in the case of three species. The results\non the Hamming distance indicate that it engenders universal behavior,\nindependently of the number of species and the size of the square lattice. The\nresults on the mobility confirm the prediction that it may destroy diversity,\nif it is increased to higher and higher values.\n", "  The flyby anomaly is a persistent riddle in astrodynamics. Orbital analysis\nin several flybys of the Earth since the Galileo spacecraft flyby of the Earth\nin 1990 have shown that the asymptotic post-encounter velocity exhibits a\ndifference with the initial velocity that cannot be attributed to conventional\neffects. To elucidate its origin, we have developed an orbital program for\nanalyzing the trajectory of the spacecraft in the vicinity of the perigee,\nincluding both the Sun and the Moon's tidal perturbations and the geopotential\nzonal, tesseral and sectorial harmonics provided by the EGM96 model. The\nmagnitude and direction of the anomalous acceleration acting upon the\nspacecraft can be estimated from the orbital determination program by comparing\nwith the trajectories fitted to telemetry data as provided by the mission\nteams. This acceleration amounts to a fraction of a mm/s$^2$ and decays very\nfast with altitude. The possibility of some new physics of gravity in the\naltitude range for spacecraft flybys is discussed.\n", "  We present the results of a 40 ks XMM-Newton observation centered on the\nvariable star V1818 Ori. Using a combination of the XMM-Newton and AllWISE\ncatalog data, we identify a group of about 31 young stellar objects around\nV1818 Ori. This group is coincident with the eastern edge of the dust ring\nsurrounding Kappa Ori. Previously, we concluded that the young stellar objects\non the western side of ring were formed in an episode of star formation that\nstarted 3-5 Myr ago, and are at a distance similar to that of kappa Ori\n(250-280 pc) and in the foreground to the Orion A cloud. Here we use the\nXMM-Newton observation to calculate X-ray fluxes and luminosities of the young\nstars around V1818 Ori. We find that their X-ray luminosity function (XLF),\ncalculated for a distance of ~270 pc, matches the XLF of the YSOs west of Kappa\nOri. We rule out that this group of young stars is associated to Mon R2 as\nassumed in the literature, but rather they are part of the same Kappa Ori's\nring stellar population.\n", "  We present the findings about chromospheric activity nature of KOI-256\nobtained from the Kepler Mission data. Firstly, it was found that there are\nsome sinusoidal variations out-of-eclipses due to cool spot activity. The\nsinusoidal variations modelled by the SPOTMODEL program indicate that the\nactive component has two different active regions. Their longitudinal variation\nrevealed that one of them has a migration period of 3.95 years, while the other\nhas a migration period of 8.37 years. Secondly, 225 flares were detected from\nthe short cadence data in total. The parameters, such as increase (Tr) and\ndecay (Td) times, total flare time (Tt), equivalent durations (P), were\ncalculated for each flare. The distribution of equivalent durations versus\ntotal flare times in logarithmic scale is modelled to find flare activity\nlevel. The Plateau value known as the saturation level of the active component\nwas calculated to be 2.3121+-0.0964 s, and the Half-life value, which is\nrequired flare total time to reach the saturation, was computed to be 2233.6 s.\nIn addition, the frequency of N1, which is the number of flares per an hour in\nthe system, was found to be 0.05087 1/h, while the flare frequency N2 that the\nflare-equivalent duration emitting per an hour was found to be 0.00051.\nContrary to the spot activity, it has been found that the flares are in tends\nto appear at specific phases due to the white dwarf component.\n", "  We present the results of the investigation of magnetic properties of the\nEr$_2$Ti$_{2-x}$Sn$_x$O$_7$ series. For small doping values the ordering\ntemperature decreases linearly with $x$ while the moment configuration remains\nthe same as in the $x = 0$ parent compound. Around $x = 1.7$ doping level we\nobserve a change in the behavior, where the ordering temperature starts to\nincrease and new magnetic Bragg peaks appear. For the first time we present\nevidence of a long-range order (LRO) in Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ ($x = 2.0$) below\n$T_N = 130$ mK. It is revealed that the moment configuration corresponds to a\nPalmer-Chalker type with a value of the magnetic moment significantly\nrenormalized compared to $x = 0$. We discuss our results in the framework of a\npossible quantum phase transition occurring close to $x = 1.7$.\n", "  In this paper, we test the possibility that the structure of the largest\nradio galaxy J1420-0545 may have been formed by restarted rather than primary\njet activity. This hypothesis was motivated by the unusual morphological\nproperties of the source consisting of two edge-brightened, narrow, highly\ncollinear, and symmetric lobes, thus suggesting an almost ballistic propagation\nof powerful jets into a particularly low-density external medium. New\nobservations made with the VLA together with the currently available GLEAM and\nTGSS ADR1 data releases allow the detection of an excess emission at low\nfrequencies. An extracted part (88 MHz - 200 MHz) of the spectrum of the\nemission is fitted with the DYNAGE model, giving a forecast for the\nenvironmental conditions and the energetic requirements for the presumed old\ncocoon related to a preceding epoch of jet activity.\n", "  Since the advent of the space-based photometric missions such as CoRoT and\nNASA's Kepler, asteroseismology has acquired a central role in our\nunderstanding about stellar physics. The Kepler spacecraft, especially, is\nstill releasing excellent photometric observations that contain a large amount\nof information not yet investigated. For exploiting the full potential of these\ndata, sophisticated and robust analysis tools are now essential, so that\nfurther constraining of stellar structure and evolutionary models can be\nobtained. In addition, extracting detailed asteroseismic properties for many\nstars can yield new insights on their correlations to fundamental stellar\nproperties and dynamics. After a brief introduction to the Bayesian notion of\nprobability, I describe the code DIAMONDS for Bayesian parameter estimation and\nmodel comparison by means of the nested sampling Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm.\nNSMC constitutes an efficient and powerful method, in replacement to standard\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo, very suitable for high-dimensional and multimodal\nproblems that are typical of detailed asteroseismic analyses, such as the\nfitting and mode identification of individual oscillation modes in stars (known\nas peak-bagging). DIAMONDS is able to provide robust results for statistical\ninferences involving tens of individual oscillation modes, while at the same\ntime preserving a considerable computational efficiency for identifying the\nsolution. In the tutorial, I will present the fitting of the stellar background\nsignal and the peak-bagging analysis of the oscillation modes in a red-giant\nstar, providing an example to use Bayesian evidence for assessing the peak\nsignificance of the fitted oscillation peaks.\n", "  The conventional definition of ground-level enhancement (GLE) events requires\na detection of solar energetic particles (SEP) by at least two differently\nlocated neutron monitors. Some places are exceptionally well suitable for\nground-based detection of SEP - high-elevation polar regions with negligible\ngeomagnetic and reduced atmospheric energy/rigidity cutoffs. At present, there\nare two neutron-monitor stations in such locations on the Antarctic plateau:\nSOPO/SOPB (at Amundsen-Scott station, 2835 m elevation), and DOMC/DOMB (at\nConcordia station, 3233 m elevation). Since 2015, when the DOMC/DOMB station\nstarted continuous operation, a relatively weak SEP event that was not detected\nby sea-level neutron-monitor stations was registered by both SOPO/SOPB and\nDOMC/DOMB, and it was accordingly classified as a GLE. This would lead to a\ndistortion of the homogeneity of the historic GLE list and the corresponding\nstatistics. To address this issue, we propose to modify the GLE definition so\nthat it maintains the homogeneity: A GLE event is registered when there are\nnear-time coincident and statistically significant enhancements of the count\nrates of at least two differently located neutron monitors, including at least\none neutron monitor near sea level and a corresponding enhancement in the\nproton flux measured by a space-borne instrument(s). Relatively weak SEP events\nregistered only by high-altitude polar neutron monitors, but with no response\nfrom cosmic-ray stations at sea level, can be classified as sub-GLEs.\n", "  The flare activity and the ultraviolet emission of the sun during its 24-th\ncycle are analysed. As compared to cycles 21-23, where the most powerful flares\nwere observed during the decay phase, in cycle 24 the greatest number of\npowerful flares (>X2.7) occurred in the rising phase and at the maximum with\nthe exception of the two largest flares of cycle 24 X9.3 and X8.2 in September\n2017. We showed that regression fits of solar UV indices to the overall\nradiation level from the sun are substantially different for cycle 24 compared\nto cycles 21-23. It is found that for the flare of August 9, 2011 (SDO and\nGOES-15 observations), the flare propagates in a direction from the upper\ncorona to the transition region and to the chromosphere. A study of the N-S\nasymmetry in the distribution of the flares in cycle 24 reveals a strong\npredominance of flares in the N-hemisphere in 2011 and in the S-hemisphere in\n2014. It is also found that during cycles 23 and 24, the delays in the onset of\nproton events relative to the onset of the flares that cause them have a\ndistribution with a distinct maximum corresponding to a delay of 2 hours for\nprotons with energies >10 MeV, as well as for those with energies >100 MeV.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to investigate relations between\nW-superalgebras and integrable super-Hamiltonian systems. To this end, we\nintroduce the generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov (D-S) reduction associated to a Lie\nsuperalgebra $g$ and its even nilpotent element $f$, and we find a new\ndefinition of the classical affine W-superalgebra $W(g,f,k)$ via the D-S\nreduction. This new construction allows us to find free generators of\n$W(g,f,k)$, as a differential superalgebra, and two independent Lie brackets on\n$W(g,f,k)/\\partial W(g,f,k).$ Moreover, we describe super-Hamiltonian systems\nwith the Poisson vertex algebras theory. A W-superalgebra with certain\nproperties can be understood as an underlying differential superalgebra of a\nseries of integrable super-Hamiltonian systems.\n", "  Metal crystals with tetrahedral packing are known as Frank-Kasper phases with\nlarge unit cells with the number of atoms from hundreds to thousands. The main\nfactors of the formation and stability of these phases are the atomic size\nratio and the number of valence electrons per atom. The significance of the\nelectronic energy contribution is analyzed within the Fermi sphere - Brillouin\nzone interactions model for several typical examples: Cu4Cd3, Mg2Al3 with over\nthousand atoms per cell, and for icosahedral quasicrystal approximants with 146\nto 168 atoms per cell. Our analysis shows that to minimize the crystal energy,\nit is important that the Fermi sphere (FS) is in contact with the Brillouin\nzones that are related to the strong diffraction peaks: the zones either\ninscribe the FS or are circumscribed by the FS creating contact at edges or\nvertices.\n", "  Nowhere is black hole feedback seen in sharper relief than in the Perseus\ncluster of galaxies. Owing to a combination of astrophysical and instrumental\nchallenges, however, it can be difficult to study the black hole accretion that\npowers feedback into clusters of galaxies. Recent observations with Hitomi have\nresolved the narrow Fe K-alpha line associated with accretion onto the black\nhole in NGC 1275 (3C 84), the active galaxy at the center of Perseus. The width\nof that line indicates the fluorescing material is located 6-45 pc from the\nblack hole. Here, we report on a specialized Chandra imaging observation of NGC\n1275 that offers a complementary angle. Using a sub-array, sub-pixel event\nrepositioning, and an X-ray \"lucky imaging\" technique, Chandra imaging suggests\nan upper limit of about 0.3 arc seconds on the size of the Fe K-alpha emission\nregion, corresponding to 98 pc. Both spectroscopy and direct imaging now point\nto an emission region consistent with an extended molecular torus or disk,\npotentially available to fuel the black hole. A low X-ray continuum flux was\nlikely measured from NGC 1275; contemporaneously, radio flaring and record-high\nGeV fluxes were measured. This may be an example of the correlation between\nX-ray flux dips and jet activity that is observed in other classes of accreting\nblack holes across the mass scale.\n", "  What does the diffraction pattern from a single atom look like? How does it\ndiffer from the scattering from long range potential? With the development of\nnew high-dynamic range pixel array detectors to measure the complete momentum\ndistribution, these questions have immediate relevance for designing and\nunderstanding momentum-resolved imaging modes. We explore the asymptotic limits\nof long range and short range potentials. We use a simple quantum mechanical\nmodel to explain the general and asymptotic limits for the probability\ndistribution in both and real and reciprocal space. Features in the scattering\npotential much larger than the probe size cause the bright-field disk to\ndeflect uniformly, while features much smaller than the probe size, instead of\na deflection cause a redistribution of intensity within the bright-field disk.\nBecause long range and short range features are encoded differently in the\ndiffraction pattern, it is possible to separate their contributions in\ndifferential phase contrast (DPC) or Center-of-Mass (CoM) imaging. The shape\nprofiles for atomic resolution CoM imaging are dominated by the shape of the\nprobe gradient and not the highly-singular atomic potentials or their local\nfields. Instead, only the peak height shows an atomic-number sensitivity, whose\nprecise dependence is determined by the convergence angle. At lower convergence\nangles, the contrast oscillates with increasing atomic number, similar to\nbright field imaging. The range of collection angles impacts DPC and CoM\nimaging differently, with CoM being more sensitive to the upper cutoff limit,\nwhile DPC is more sensitive to the lower cutoff.\n", "  The auxiliary functions provide efficient computation of integrals arising at\nthe self-consistent field (SCF) level for molecules using Slater-type bases.\nThis applies both in relativistic and non-relativistic electronic structure\ntheory. The relativistic molecular auxiliary functions derived in our previous\npaper [Phys. Rev. E 91, 023303 (2015)] are discussed here in detail. Two\nsolution methods are proposed in the present study. The ill-conditioned\nbinomial series representation formulae first, are replaced by convergent\nseries representation for incomplete beta functions then, they are improved by\ninserting an extra parameter used to extend the domain of convergence. Highly\naccurate results can be achieved for integrals by the procedures discussed in\nthe present study which also places no restrictions on quantum numbers in all\nranges of orbital parameters. The difficulty of obtaining analytical relations\nassociated with using non-integer Slater-type orbitals which are non-analytic\nin the sense of complex analysis at r=0 is therefore, eliminated.\n", "  We studied the central regions of the Galactic Centre to determine if the\nCircumNuclear Disk (CND) acts as an absorber or a barrier for the central\nX-rays diffuse emission. After reprocessing 4.6Ms of Chandra observations, we\nwere able to detect, for the first time, a depression in the X-ray luminosity\nof the diffuse emission whose size and location correspond to those of the CND.\nWe extracted the X-ray spectra for various regions inside the CND footprint as\nwell as for the region where the footprint is observed and for a region located\noutside the footprint. We simultaneously fitted these spectra as an optically\nthin plasma whose absorption by the interstellar medium and by the local plasma\nwere fitted independently using the MCMC method. The hydrogen column density of\nthe ISM is 7.5x10^22 cm^-2. The X-ray diffuse emission inside the CND footprint\nis formed by a 2T plasma of 1 and 4keV with slightly super-solar abundances\nexcept for the iron and carbon which are sub-solar. The plasma from the CND, in\nturn, is better described by a 1T model with abundances and local hydrogen\ncolumn density which are very different to those of the innermost regions. The\nlarge iron abundance in this region confirms that the CND is dominated by the\nshock-heated ejecta of the Sgr A East supernova remnant. We deduced that the\nCND rather acts as a barrier for the Galactic Centre plasma and that the plasma\nlocated outside the CND may correspond to the collimated outflow possibly\ncreated by Sgr A* or the interaction between the wind of massive stars and the\nmini-spiral material.\n", "  In addition to electron charge and spin, novel materials host another degree\nof freedom, the valley. For a junction composed of valley filter sandwiched by\ntwo normal terminals, we focus on the valley efficiency under disorder with two\nvalley filter models based on monolayer and bilayer graphene. Applying the\ntransfer matrix method, valley resolved transmission coefficients are obtained.\nWe find that: i) under weak disorder, when the line defect length is over about\n$15\\rm nm$, it functions as a perfect channel (quantized conductance) and\nvalley filter (totally polarized); ii) in the diffusive regime, combination\neffects of backscattering and bulk states assisted intervalley transmission\nenhance the conductance and suppress the valley polarization; iii) for very\nlong line defect, though the conductance is small, polarization is indifferent\nto length. Under perpendicular magnetics field, the characters of charge and\nvalley transport are only slightly affected. Finally we discuss the efficiency\nof transport valley polarized current in a hybrid system.\n", "  In this paper we apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to study a strongly coupled\nplasma far from equilibrium with a strong emphasis on the shear behavior. The\nplasma serves as a model for an electrically charged quark-gluon plasma. On the\ngravitational side, we use an ingoing Vaidya black brane spacetime. The highest\nrate of mass infall is confined to a short time interval.\n", "  In this paper we present experimental and numerical studies of the\nelectrohydrodynamic stretching of a sub-millimetre-sized salt water drop,\nimmersed in oil with added non-ionic surfactant, and subjected to a suddenly\napplied electric field of magnitude approaching 1 kV/mm. By varying the drop\nsize, electric field strength and surfactant concentration we cover the whole\nrange of electric capillary numbers ($Ca_E$) from 0 up to the limit of drop\ndisintegration. The results are compared with the analytical result by Taylor\n(1964) which predicts the asymptotic deformation as a function of $Ca_E$. We\nfind that the addition of surfactant damps the transient oscillations and that\nthe drops may be stretched slightly beyond the stability limit found by Taylor.\nWe proceed to study the damping of the oscillations, and show that increasing\nthe surfactant concentration has a dual effect of first increasing the damping\nat low concentrations, and then increasing the asymptotic deformation at higher\nconcentrations. We explain this by comparing the Marangoni forces and the\ninterfacial tension as the drops deform. Finally, we have observed in the\nexperiments a significant hysteresis effect when drops in oil with large\nconcentration of surfactant are subjected to repeated deformations with\nincreasing electric field strengths. This effect is not attributable to the\nflow nor the interfacial surfactant transport.\n", "  The banquet for the July 2017 conference in Cambridge, UK celebrating Stephen\nHawking's 75th birthday was held in Trinity College on July 3rd. The organizers\nasked the author, among others, to give a 10 minute after dinner talk on what\nit was like to work with Stephen. The following is an edited version of the\nauthor's speaking text.\n", "  The higher-order topological insulator (HOTI) protected by spacial symmetry\nhas been studied in-depth on models with square lattice. Our work, based on an\nalternative model on the breathing Kagome lattice, revealed that the different\ntypes of corners in the lattice could actually be conditionally gapless, or\nalways gapped. Using the Wilson loop formalism, we argue that these corner\nstates occur when the eigenvalues of the Wannier Hamiltonian cross through a\ncertain reference point during the conceptual \"pumping\" procedure. The results\ndemonstrate the corner of the Kagome lattice based HOTI is a zero-dimensional\nanalogue of the 1D chiral edge states on the boundary of a Chern insulator, but\nwith a sensitive dependence on the shape of the corner. Our method of the\npumping cylinder, which reveals the symmetry/gapless-ability correspondence,\ncan be generalized into a general scheme in determining the classification of\ncorner(hinge) states in HOTI.\n", "  The objective of this work was to study the RF sputtering process parameters\noptimisation for deposition of Silicon Nitride thin films. The process\nparameters chosen to be varied were deposition power, deposition duration, flow\nrate of argon and flow rate of nitrogen. The parameters were varied at three\nlevels according to Taguchi L9 orthogonal array. Surface topology, film\ncomposition, coating thickness, coating resistivity and refractive index were\ndetermined using SEM, XRD, profilometer, Semiconductor device analyser and UV\nspectrometer respectively. The measured film thickness values ranged from\n127.8nm to 908.3nm with deposition rate varying from 1.47nm/min to a maximum\nvalue of 10.1nm/min. The resistivity of the film varied between 1.53x1013ohm-m\nto 7.85 x1013ohm-m. Refractive index of the film was calculated to be between\n1.84 to 2.08. From the results, it was seen that film properties tend to be\npoor when there is no nitrogen flow and tend to improve with small input of\nnitrogen. Also, SEM images indicated amorphous structure of silicon nitride\nwhich was confirmed by XRD pattern.\n", "  Metalenses can achieve diffraction-limited focusing through localized phase\nmanipulation of the incoming light beam. Because these structures are\nultrathin, less than a wavelength, this has the potential of achieving\nultrathin optical elements, with a thickness limited mainly by the mechanical\nstrength of the transparent substrate. Recently proposed metalenses are based\non either dielectric nanofin arrays, or nanoparticles of large number, which\nleads to severe manufacturing challenges. To overcome these challenges, this\npaper predicts a new type of metalens with concentric-nanoring topology, where\nthe number and size of the nanorings are determined using an inverse design\nmethod. By focusing the electrical field energy at a specified position, the\nconvex-like metalens is inversely predicted with desired numerical aperture and\na diffraction-limited focal spot. The Poynting vector distribution found\ndemonstrates the mechanism of the lensing function, in which optical vortices\nare generated in the nanorings to achieve a matching of the phase and impedance\nbetween the substrate and free space, and further, to form a spherical\nwavefront and enhance the transmission of the optical energy. The inverse\ndesign method can also be extended to predict an axicon-like metalens with\nfocal beam. The improved manufacturability is concluded from the geometry of\nthe concentric-nanoring configurations.\n", "  In this letter, we have considered an electron in a double quantum dot system\ninteracting with a detector represented by a point contact. We present a\ndynamical model for the gradual decoherence of the density matrix due to the\ninteraction with the detector. The interaction of the qubit (quantum system) on\nthe quantum point contact (environment) leads to a discrete set of pointer\nstates of the double quantum dot (apparatus). The necessary time for the qubit\ndecoherence process (measurement time) has been calculated through this model.\nThe existence of a minimum time for the quantum measurement has been obtained.\n", "  OLYMPUS is a particle physics experiment that collected data in 2012 at DESY,\nin Hamburg, Germany, on the asymmetry between positron-proton and\nelectron-proton elastic scattering cross sections. A non-zero asymmetry is\nevidence of hard two-photon exchange, which has been hypothesized to cause the\ndiscrepancy in measurements of the proton's electromagnetic form factors.\nAlternating electron and positron beams, accelerated to 2 GeV, were directed\nthrough a windowless, gaseous, hydrogen target, and the scattered lepton and\nrecoiling proton were detected in coincidence using a large acceptance magnetic\nspectrometer. Determining the relative integrated luminosity between the\nelectron and positron data sets was critical, and a new technique, involving\nmulti-interaction events, was developed to achieve the desired sub-percent\naccuracy. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation was built in order to reproduce the\nconvolution of systematic effects at every stage of the experiment. The first\nstage in the simulation was new radiative event generator, which permitted the\nfull simulation of the non-trivial, radiative corrections to the measurement.\nThe analysis of the data and simulation showed that the lepton sign asymmetry\nrises by several percent between a momentum transfer of 0.5 GeV$^2/c^2$ and\n2.25 GeV$^2/c^2$. This rise as a function of increasing momentum transfer\nconfirms that two photon exchange at least partially contributes to the proton\nform factor discrepancy.\n", "  The mass and decay width of the $\\phi$ meson in cold nuclear matter are\ncomputed in an effective Lagrangian approach, with the medium dependence of\nthese properties obtained by evaluating kaon-antikaon loop contributions to the\n$\\phi$ self-energy. At normal nuclear matter density, we find a downward shift\nof the $\\phi$ mass by a few percent, while the decay width is enhanced by an\norder of magnitude. We also present $\\phi$--nucleus bound state energies and\nabsorption widths for some selected nuclei, using complex optical potentials\nobtained in the local density approximation. Our results suggest that the\n$\\phi$ should form bound states with all the nuclei considered. However, the\nidentification of the signal for these predicted bound states will need careful\ninvestigation because of their sizable absorption widths.\n", "  We probe the higher-order galaxy clustering in the final data release (DR12)\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)\nusing germ-grain Minkowski Functionals (MFs). Our data selection contains\n$979,430$ BOSS galaxies from both the northern and southern galactic caps over\nthe redshift range $z=0.2 - 0.6$. We extract the higher-order part of the MFs,\ndetecting the deviation from the purely Gaussian case with $\\chi^2 \\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ on 24 degrees of freedom across the entire data selection.\nWe measure significant redshift evolution in the higher-order functionals for\nthe first time. We find $15-35\\%$ growth, depending on functional and scale,\nbetween our redshift bins centered at $z=0.325$ and $z=0.525$. We show that the\nstructure in higher order correlations grow faster than that in the two-point\ncorrelations, especially on small scales where the excess approaches a factor\nof $2$. We demonstrate how this trend is generalizable by finding good\nagreement of the data with a hierarchical model in which the higher orders grow\nfaster than the lower order correlations. We find that the non-Gaussianity of\nthe underlying dark matter field grows even faster than the one of the galaxies\ndue to decreasing clustering bias. Our method can be adapted to study the\nredshift evolution of the three-point and higher functions individually.\n", "  The H-alpha line emission is an important probe for a number of fundamental\nquantities in galaxies, including their number density, star formation rate\n(SFR) and overall gas content. A new generation of low-resolution intensity\nmapping probes, e.g. SPHEREx and CDIM, will observe galaxies in H-alpha\nemission over a large fraction of the sky from the local Universe till a\nredshift of z ~ 6 to 10, respectively. This will also be the target line for\nobservations by the high-resolution Euclid and WFIRST instruments in the z ~\n0.7 - 2 redshift range. In this paper, we estimate the intensity and power\nspectra of the H-alpha line in the z ~ 0 - 5 redshift range using observed line\nluminosity functions (LFs), when possible, and simulations, otherwise. We\nestimate the significance of our predictions by accounting for the modelling\nuncertainties (e.g. SFR, extinction, etc.) and observational contamination. We\nfind that Intensity Mapping (IM) surveys can make a statistical detection of\nthe full H-alpha emission between z ~ 0.8 - 5. Moreover, we find that the\nhigh-frequency resolution and the sensitivity of the planned CDIM surveys allow\nfor the separation of H-alpha emission from several interloping lines. We\nexplore ways to use the combination of these line intensities to probe galaxy\nproperties. As expected, our study indicates that galaxy surveys will only\ndetect bright galaxies that contribute up to a few percent of the overall\nH-alpha intensity. However, these surveys will provide important constraints on\nthe high end of the H-alpha LF and put strong constraints on the AGN LF.\n", "  High-mass stars are commonly found in stellar clusters promoting the idea\nthat their formation occurs due to the physical processes linked with a young\nstellar cluster. It has recently been reported that isolated high-mass stars\nare present in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Due to their low velocities it has\nbeen argued that these are high-mass stars which formed without a surrounding\nstellar cluster. In this paper we present an alternative explanation for the\norigin of these stars in which they formed in a cluster environment but are\nsubsequently dispersed into the field as their natal cluster is tidally\ndisrupted in a merger with a higher-mass cluster. They escape the merged\ncluster with relatively low velocities typical of the cluster interaction and\nthus of the larger scale velocity dispersion, similarly to the observed stars.\n$N$-body simulations of cluster mergers predict a sizeable population of low\nvelocity ($\\le$ 20 km s$^{-1}$), high-mass stars at distances of > 20 pc from\nthe cluster. High-mass clusters in which gas poor mergers are frequent would be\nexpected to commonly have halos of young stars, including high-mass stars, that\nwere actually formed in a cluster environment.\n", "  We show that Mellin moments of generalized parton distributions, given as\neven polynomials in the skewness parameter, are obtained from the Taylor\nexpansion of light front wave functions. Furthermore, we derive non-standard\nversions of the inverse Radon transform to obtain the double distribution from\nthe parton number conserved light front wave function overlap. These\ntransformations are utilized to extend a generalized parton distribution from\nthe outer region to the central one. We exemplify the formalism for a light\nfront wave function that arises from an AdS/QCD duality conjecture.\n", "  We present high resolution ($0.11\"\\times0.06\"$) 3mm ALMA observations of the\nhighly inclined transition disk around the star T Cha. Our continuum image\nreveals multiple dust structures: an inner disk, a spatially resolved dust gap,\nand an outer ring. When fitting sky-brightness models to the real component of\nthe 3mm visibilities, we infer that the inner emission is compact ($\\le1$au in\nradius), the gap width is between 18-28 au, and the emission from the outer\nring peaks at $\\sim36$ au. We compare our ALMA image with previously published\n1.6$\\mu$m VLT/SPHERE imagery. This comparison reveals that the location of the\nouter ring is wavelength dependent. More specifically, the peak emission of the\n3mm ring is at a larger radial distance than that of the 1.6$\\mu$m ring,\nsuggesting that millimeter-sized grains in the outer disk are located further\naway from the central star than micron-sized grains. We discuss different\nscenarios to explain our findings, including dead zones, star-driven\nphotoevaporation, and planet-disk interactions. We find that the most likely\norigin of the dust gap is from an embedded planet, and estimate --- for a\nsingle planet scenario --- that T Cha's gap is carved by a $1.2M_{jup}$ planet.\n", "  In this communication, the feasibility of the nonlocal strain gradient theory\nfor fields of applied mechanics is investigated. It is demonstrated that the\nnonlocal strain gradient theory is physically incorrect. It is proved that each\nof the nonlocal theory and the strain gradient theory can model, both,\nhardening and softening behaviors of materials. Moreover, it is proved that the\nnonlocal theory and the strain gradient theory describe the same physical\nphenomena, and hence the strain gradient theory cannot be merged with the\nnonlocal theory in a unified model. This short communication comments on a\nseries of papers in which the nonlocal strain gradient theory was utilized in\ndifferent areas of applied mechanics.\n", "  Symplectic reflection algebra $ H_{1, \\,\\nu}(G)$ has a $T(G)$-dimensional\nspace of traces whereas, when considered as a superalgebra with a natural\nparity, it has an $S(G)$-dimensional space of supertraces. The values of $T(G)$\nand $S(G)$ depend on the symplectic reflection group $G$ and do not depend on\nthe parameter $\\nu$.\n  In this paper, the values $T(G)$ and $S(G)$ are explicitly calculated for the\ngroups $G= \\Gamma \\wr S_N$, where $\\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of\n$Sp(2,\\mathbb C)$.\n", "  This document describes some of the fundamental astrophysical problems that\nrequire observing capabilities at millimeter- and centimeter wavelengths well\nbeyond those of existing, or already planned, telescopes. The results\nsummarized in this report follow a solicitation from the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory to develop key science cases for a future U. S.-led radio\ntelescope, the \"next generation Very Large Array\" (ngVLA). The ngVLA will have\nroughly 10 times the collecting area of the Jansky VLA, operate at frequencies\nfrom 1 GHz to 116 GHz with up to 20 GHz of bandwidth, possess a compact core\nfor high surface-brightness sensitivity, and extended baselines of at least\nhundreds of kilometers and ultimately across the continent to provide\nhigh-resolution imaging. The ngVLA builds on the scientific and technical\nlegacy of the Jansky VLA and ALMA, and will be designed to provide the next\nleap forward in our understanding of planets, galaxies, and black holes.\n", "  We present a compelling finite element framework to model hydrogen assisted\nfatigue by means of a hydrogen- and cycle-dependent cohesive zone formulation.\nThe model builds upon: (i) appropriate environmental boundary conditions, (ii)\na coupled mechanical and hydrogen diffusion response, driven by chemical\npotential gradients, (iii) a mechanical behavior characterized by finite\ndeformation J2 plasticity, (iv) a phenomenological trapping model, (v) an\nirreversible cohesive zone formulation for fatigue, grounded on continuum\ndamage mechanics, and (vi) a traction-separation law dependent on hydrogen\ncoverage calculated from first principles. The computations show that the\npresent scheme appropriately captures the main experimental trends; namely, the\nsensitivity of fatigue crack growth rates to the loading frequency and the\nenvironment. The role of yield strength, work hardening, and constraint\nconditions in enhancing crack growth rates as a function of the frequency is\nthoroughly investigated. The results reveal the need to incorporate additional\nsources of stress elevation, such as gradient-enhanced dislocation hardening,\nto attain a quantitative agreement with the experiments.\n", "  In these lecture notes presented at the 2015 Villa de Leyva Summer School, we\ngive an introduction to superstring theory. We begin by studying the particle\nand superparticle in order to get a better understanding on the superstring\nside. Afterwards, we review the pure spinor formalism and end by computing the\nscattering amplitude for three gravitons at tree-level.\n", "  The work of this thesis comprises extensive Noncontact Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (NC-AFM) characterization of clean metal-oxide (YSZ(100)/(111) and\nMgO(100)) and graphitic (HOPG) supports as templates for the novel,\nphotochemically induced nucleation of cobalt oxide nanostructures, particularly\nCobalt (III) Oxide. The nanostructure-support surfaces were also studied by\nX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) to verify the nature of the supported\ncobalt oxide and to corroborate the surface topographic and phase NC-AFM data.\nHeteroepitaxial growth of Co2O3 nanostructures proves to exhibit a variety of\ndifferent growth modes based on the structure of the support surface. On this\nbasis, single-crystal support surfaces ranging from nonpolar to polar and\natomically flat to highly defective and reactive were chosen, again, yielding\nnumerous substrate-nanostructure interactions that could be probed by\nhigh-performance surface science techniques.\n", "  We discuss the current minimisation strategies adopted by research projects\ninvolving the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and\nfragmentation functions (FFs) through the training of neural networks. We\npresent a short overview of a proton PDF determination obtained using the\ncovariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) optimisation\nalgorithm. We perform comparisons between the CMA-ES and the standard nodal\ngenetic algorithm (NGA) adopted by the NNPDF collaboration.\n", "  The non-perturbative nature of QCD at hadronic scales implied the development\nof phenomenological approaches such as quark models or, more recently,\ncomputer-based calculations using Lattice QCD. However, the unique properties\nof heavy quarkonium systems allow an entire calculation in terms of\nnon-relativistic perturbative QCD. In this work, the bottomonium spectrum, up\nto $n = 3$, and the ground state charmonium states, are analyzed in the\nframework of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics at N$^3$LO. For\nbottomonium, finite charm quark mass effects in the QCD potential and the\n$\\overline{MS}$-pole mass relation are incorporated to the highest known order,\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^3)$ in the $\\Upsilon$-scheme counting. The bottom\nquark pole mass is expressed in terms of the MSR mass, a low-scale\nshort-distance mass which cancels the $u = 1/2$ renormalon of the static\npotential. We study the $n_\\ell = 3$ and $n_\\ell = 4$ schemes, finding a\nnegligible difference between the two if finite $m_c$ effects are smoothly\nincorporated in the MSR mass definition. We find that bottomonium $n=3$ states\nare not well behaved within perturbative NRQCD. Hence, fitting to the $n=1,2$\n$b\\bar b$ states we obtain $\\overline{m}_b(\\overline{m}_b) = 4.216\\pm 0.039$\nGeV. Similarly, from the lowest lying charmonium states we find\n$\\overline{m}_c(\\overline{m}_c)=1.273 \\pm 0.054$ GeV.\n", "  Landau damping is the tendency of solutions to the Vlasov equation towards\nspatially homogeneous distribution functions. The distribution functions\nhowever approach the spatially homogeneous manifold only weakly, and Boltzmann\nentropy is not changed by Vlasov equation. On the other hand, density and\nkinetic energy density, which are integrals of the distribution function,\napproach spatially homogeneous states strongly, which is accompanied by growth\nof the hydrodynamic entropy. Such a behavior can be seen when Vlasov equation\nis reduced to the evolution equations for density and kinetic energy density by\nmeans of the Ehrenfest reduction.\n", "  The metal abundance of the hot plasma that permeates galaxy clusters\nrepresents the accumulation of heavy elements produced by billions of\nsupernovae. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy of the intracluster medium provides\nan opportunity to investigate the nature of supernova explosions integrated\nover cosmic time. In particular, the abundance of the iron-peak elements\n(chromium, manganese, iron and nickel) is key to understanding how the\nprogenitors of typical type Ia supernovae evolve and explode. Recent X-ray\nstudies of the intracluster medium found that the abundance ratios of these\nelements differ substantially from those seen in the Sun, suggesting\ndifferences between the nature of type Ia supernovae in the clusters and in the\nMilky Way. However, because the K-shell transition lines of chromium and\nmanganese are weak and those of iron and nickel are very close in photon\nenergy, high-resolution spectroscopy is required for an accurate determination\nof the abundances of these elements. Here we report observations of the Perseus\ncluster, with statistically significant detections of the resonance emission\nfrom chromium, manganese and nickel. Our measurements, combined with the latest\natomic models, reveal that these elements have near-solar abundance ratios with\nrespect to iron, in contrast to previous claims. Comparison between our results\nand modern nucleosynthesis calculations disfavours the hypothesis that type Ia\nsupernova progenitors are exclusively white dwarfs with masses well below the\nChandrasekhar limit (about 1.4 times the mass of the Sun). The observed\nabundance pattern of the iron-peak elements can be explained by taking into\naccount a combination of near- and sub-Chandrasekhar-mass type Ia supernova\nsystems, adding to the mounting evidence that both progenitor types make a\nsubstantial contribution to cosmic chemical enrichment.\n", "  The collisional shift of a transition constitutes an important systematic\neffect in high-precision spectroscopy. Accurate values for van der\nWaalsinteraction coefficients are required in order to evaluate the\ndistance-dependent frequency shift. We here consider the interaction of excited\nhydrogen 6P atoms with metastable atoms (in the 2S state), in order to explore\nthe influence of quasi-degenerate 2P, and 6S states on the dipole-dipole\ninteraction. The motivation for the calculation is given by planned\nhigh-precision measurements of the transition. Due to the presence of\nquasi-degenerate levels, one can use the non-retarded approximation for the\ninteraction terms over wide distance ranges.\n", "  We propose a complete microscopic definition of the Hilbert space of minimal\nhigher spin de Sitter quantum gravity and its Hartle-Hawking vacuum state. The\nfundamental degrees of freedom are $2N$ bosonic fields living on the future\nconformal boundary, where $N$ is proportional to the de Sitter horizon entropy.\nThe vacuum state is normalizable. The model agrees in perturbation theory with\nexpectations from a previously proposed dS-CFT description in terms of a\nfermionic Sp(N) model, but it goes beyond this, both in its conceptual scope\nand in its computational power. In particular it resolves the apparent\npathologies affecting the Sp(N) model, and it provides an exact formula for\nlate time vacuum correlation functions. We illustrate this by computing\nprobabilities for arbitrarily large field excursions, and by giving fully\nexplicit examples of vacuum 3- and 4-point functions. We discuss bulk\nreconstruction and show the perturbative bulk QFT canonical commutations\nrelations can be reproduced from the fundamental operator algebra, but only up\nto a minimal error term $\\sim e^{-\\mathcal{O}(N)}$, and only if the operators\nare coarse grained in such a way that the number of accessible \"pixels\" is less\nthan $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. Independent of this, we show that upon gauging the\nhigher spin symmetry group, one is left with $2N$ physical degrees of freedom,\nand that all gauge invariant quantities can be computed by a $2N \\times 2N$\nmatrix model. This suggests a concrete realization of the idea of cosmological\ncomplementarity.\n", "  In the present study, the dependences of the morphological types of the first\nand second ranked group galaxies on the magnitude gap were studied.\n  It is shown that there is no increase in the relative number of elliptical\ngalaxies among the first and second ranked group galaxies with a large\nmagnitude gaps (in comparison with the expected, assuming that the\nmorphological type of these galaxies does not depend on the magnitude gap).\nThis result contradicts the merger hypothesis. The hypothesis proposed by\nAmbartsumian does not contradict this result.\n", "  From an astronomical and relativistic point of view, the Great War began with\nthe August, 1914 capture and imprisonment of the members of a German eclipse\nexpedition that had gone to the Crimea to look, at the request of Einstein, for\nbending of starlight by the sun. And it ended in 1919 with the\nEddington-inspired measurements of that light bending from Principe and Sobral\nand with the founding of the International Astronomical Union by scientists\nfrom \"the countries at war with the Central Powers.\" In between came\nunprecedented, and in some ways unequaled, death and destruction. The\nscientists lost were mostly too young to have made an impact (Henry Moseley and\nKarl Schwarzschild are exceptions), but many of the best-known of the next\ngeneration had, if citizens of the belligerent countries, served on the battle\nlines, and most of the rest contributed in some other way. It may come as a\nsurprise to find that both theoretical physics and observational astronomy of\nrelevance to general relativity continued to take place and that there was a\ncertain amount of communication of results, information, and even goods in both\ndirections. The early post-war years saw something of a flowering of the\nsubject, before the majority of physicists turned their attention to quantum\nmechanics and astronomers to stellar physics, though both had already been\nunder consideration during the war. War-based bitterness between French and\nGerman scholars was surely part of the context in which Einstein and Henri\nBergson faced off on 6 April 1922, in a debate on the nature of time, as part\nof an Einsteinian visit to Paris that had originally been planned for Fall,\n1914.\n", "  Patches of vegetation consist of dense clusters of shrubs, grass, or trees,\noften found to be circular characteristic size, defined by the properties of\nthe vegetation and terrain. Therefore, vegetation patches can be interpreted as\nlocalized structures. Previous findings have shown that such localized\nstructures can self-replicate in a binary fashion, where a single vegetation\npatch elongates and divides into two new patches. Here, we extend these\nprevious results by considering the more general case, where the plants\ninteract non-locally, this extension adds an extra level of complexity and\nshrinks the gap between the model and real ecosystems, where it is known that\nthe plant-to-plant competition through roots and above-ground facilitating\ninteractions have non-local effects, i.e. they extend further away than the\nnearest neighbor distance. Through numerical simulations, we show that for a\nmoderate level of aridity, a transition from a single patch to periodic pattern\noccurs. Moreover, for large values of the hydric stress, we predict an opposing\nroute to the formation of periodic patterns, where a homogeneous cover of\nvegetation may decay to spot-like patterns. The evolution of the biomass of\nvegetation patches can be used as an indicator of the state of an ecosystem,\nthis allows to distinguish if a system is in a self-replicating or decaying\ndynamics. In an attempt to relate the theoretical predictions to real\necosystems, we analyze landscapes in Zambia and Mozambique, where vegetation\nforms patches of tens of meters in diameter. We show that the properties of the\npatches together with their spatial distributions are consistent with the\nself-organization hypothesis. We argue that the characteristics of the observed\nlandscapes may be a consequence of patch self-replication, however, detailed\nfield and temporal data is fundamental to assess the real state of the\necosystems.\n", "  A fractional derivative is a temporally nonlocal operation which is\ncomputationally intensive due to inclusion of the accumulated contribution of\nfunction values at past times. In order to lessen the computational load while\nmaintaining the accuracy of the fractional derivative, a novel numerical method\nfor the Caputo fractional derivative is proposed. The present adaptive memory\nmethod significantly reduces the requirement for computational memory for\nstoring function values at past time points and also significantly improves the\naccuracy by calculating convolution weights to function values at past time\npoints which can be non-uniformly distributed in time. The superior accuracy of\nthe present method to the accuracy of the previously reported methods is\nidentified by deriving numerical errors analytically. The sub-diffusion process\nof a time-fractional diffusion equation and the creeping response of a\nfractional viscoelastic model are simulated to demonstrate the accuracy as well\nas the computational efficiency of the present method.\n", "  We discuss two aspects of turbulent Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard convection (RBC) on\nthe basis of high-resolution direct numerical simulations in a unique setting;\na closed cylindrical cell of aspect ratio of one. First, we present a\ncomprehensive comparison of statistical quantities such as energy dissipation\nrates and boundary layer thickness scales. Data are used from three simulation\nrun series at Prandtl numbers $Pr$ that cover two orders of magnitude. In\ncontrast to most previous studies in RBC the focus of the present work is on\nconvective turbulence at very low Prandtl numbers including $Pr=0.021$ for\nliquid mercury or gallium and $Pr=0.005$ for liquid sodium. In this parameter\nrange of RBC, inertial effects cause a dominating turbulent momentum transport\nthat is in line with highly intermittent fluid turbulence both in the bulk and\nin the boundary layers and thus should be able to trigger a transition to the\nfully turbulent boundary layers of the ultimate regime of convection for higher\nRayleigh number. Secondly, we predict the ranges of Rayleigh numbers for which\nthe viscous boundary layer will transition to turbulence and the flow as a\nwhole will cross over into the ultimate regime. These transition ranges are\nobtained by extrapolation from our simulation data. The extrapolation methods\nare based on the large-scale properties of the velocity profile. Two of the\nthree methods predict similar ranges for the transition to ultimate convection\nwhen their uncertainties are taken into account. All three extrapolation\nmethods indicate that the range of critical Rayleigh numbers $Ra_c$ is shifted\nto smaller magnitudes as the Prandtl number becomes smaller.\n", "  We theoretically investigate spin-wave propagation through a magnetic\nmetamaterial with spatially modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We\nestablish an effective Sch{\\\"o}dinger equation for spin-waves and derive\nboundary conditions for spin-waves passing through the boundary between two\nregions having different Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Based on these\nboundary conditions, we find that the spin-wave can be amplified at the\nboundary and the spin-wave bandgap is tunable either by an external magnetic\nfield or the strength of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which offers a\nspin-wave analogue of the field-effect transistor in traditional electronics.\n", "  Generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs) are one type of three-dimensional\nstructure functions, and they are related to the generalized distribution\nfunctions (GPDs) by the $s$-$t$ crossing of the Mandelstam variables. The GDA\nstudies provide information on three-dimensional tomography of hadrons. The\nGDAs can be investigated by the two-photon process $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to h\\bar\nh$, and the GPDs are studied by the deeply virtual Compton scattering $\\gamma^*\nh \\to \\gamma h$. The GDA studies had been pure theoretical topics, although the\nGPDs have been experimentally investigated, because there was no available\nexperimental measurement. Recently, the Belle collaboration reported their\nmeasurements on the $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ differential cross\nsection, so that it became possible to find the GDAs from their measurements.\nHere, we report our analysis of the Belle data for determining the pion GDAs.\nFrom the GDAs, the timelike gravitational form factors $\\Theta_1 (s)$ and\n$\\Theta_2 (s)$ can be calculated, which are mechanical (pressure, shear force)\nand mass (energy) form factors, respectively. They are converted to the\nspacelike form factors by using the dispersion relation, and then gravitational\nradii are evaluated for the pion. The mass and mechanical radii are obtained\nfrom $\\Theta_2$ and $\\Theta_1$ as $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2 \\rangle_{\\text{mass}}}\n=0.56 \\sim 0.69$ fm and $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2 \\rangle_{\\text{mech}}} =1.45 \\sim\n1.56$ fm, whereas the experimental charge radius is $\\sqrt {\\langle r^2\n\\rangle_{\\text{charge}}} =0.672 \\pm 0.008$ fm for the charged pion. Future\ndevelopments are expected in this new field to explore gravitational physics in\nthe quark and gluon level.\n", "  In-plane resistivity measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic\nfield up to 35~T with precise orientation within the crystallographic\n$ac-$plane were used to study the upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, of the\nhole-doped iron-based superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. Compositions\nof the samples studied were spanning from underdoped $x=$0.17 ($T_c$=12~K) and\n$x$=0.22 ($T_c$=20~K), both in the coexistence range of stripe magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, though optimal doping $x$=0.39 ($T_c$=38.4~K), $x$=0.47\n($T_c$=37.2~K), to overdoped $x$=0.65 ($T_c$=22~K), $x$=0.83 ($T_c$=10~K). We\nfind notable doping asymmetry of the shapes of the anisotropic $H_{c2}(T)$\nsuggesting important role of paramagnetic limiting effects in $H \\parallel a$\nconfiguration in overdoped compositions and multi-band effects in underdoped\ncompositions.\n", "  We show that contrary to the claim in Sci. Rep. 7, 15492 (2017), the quantum\nFisher information itself is not a valid coherence measure based on the\nresource theory of coherence because it can increase via an incoherent\noperation.\n", "  Accelerating electrons are known to radiate electromagnetic waves, a property\nthat is central to the concept of many devices, from antennas to synchrotrons.\nWhile the electrodynamics of accelerating charged particles is well understood,\nthe same is not true for charged matter waves: would a locally accelerating\ncharged matter wave, like its particle counterpart, radiate? Here we construct\na novel class of matter waves, angular accelerating electron waves, by\nsuperpositions of twisted electrons carrying orbital angular momentum. We study\nthe electrodynamic behaviour of such accelerating matter waves and reveal the\ngeneration of a solenoidal magnetic field in each component, and an\naccelerating electron wave that does not radiate. These novel properties will\nhave practical impact in spin flipping of qubits for quantum information\nprocessing, have been suggested for control of time dilation and length\ncontraction, and raise fundamental questions as to the nature of wave-particle\nduality in the context of radiating charged matter.\n", "  In spherical symmetry with radial coordinate $r$, classical Newtonian\ngravitation supports circular orbits and, for $-1/r$ and $r^2$ potentials only,\nclosed elliptical orbits [1]. Various families of elliptical orbits can be\nthought of as arising from the action of perturbations on corresponding\ncircular orbits. We show that one elliptical orbit in each family is singled\nout because its focal length is equal to the radius of the corresponding\nunperturbed circular orbit. The eccentricity of this special orbit is related\nto the famous irrational number known as the golden ratio. So inanimate\nNewtonian gravitation appears to exhibit (but not prefer) the golden ratio\nwhich has been previously identified mostly in settings within the animate\nworld.\n", "  The variational study of the ground state of the spin$-1/2$ anisotropic\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet has been revisited on a square lattice by improving\nand correcting past numerical results found in Sol. State. Comm. 165, 33\n(2013). The Hamiltonian has been implemented on a square lattice with\nantiferromagnetic interactions between nearest- and next-nearest neighbors. The\nnearest-neighbor couplings have different strengths, namely, $J_{1}$ and\n$J_{1}^{'}$, for the x and y directions, respectively. These couplings compete\nwith the next-nearest ones denoted by $J_{2}$. We obtained a new phase diagram\nin the $\\lambda - \\alpha$ plane, where $\\lambda= J_{1}^{'}/J_{1}$ and $\\alpha =\nJ_{2}/J_{1}$, whose topology is slightly different of that previously found.\nThere is no direct frontier dividing the collinear (CAF) and the\nantiferromagnetic order (AF), rather, the quantum paramagnetic phase (QP)\nseparates these two phases for all positive values of $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$.\nThe true nature of the frontiers has been obtained by scanning rigorously the\nrelevant points of the $\\lambda-\\alpha$ plane.\n", "  Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is an important technology\nin physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology. Sensitive detection with\na small sample volume is a key objective in these areas, because it is crucial,\nfor example, for the readout of a highly packed spin based quantum memory or\nthe detection of unlabeled metalloproteins in a single cell. In conventional\nEPR spectrometers, the energy transfer from the spins to the cavity at a\nPurcell enhanced rate plays an essential role and requires the spins to be\nresonant with the cavity, however the size of the cavity (limited by the\nwavelength) makes it difficult to improve the spatial resolution. Here, we\ndemonstrate a novel EPR spectrometer using a single artificial atom as a\nsensitive detector of spin magnetization. The artificial atom, a\nsuperconducting flux qubit, provides advantages both in terms of its quantum\nproperties and its much stronger coupling with magnetic fields. We have\nachieved a sensitivity of $\\sim$400 spins/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ with a magnetic\nsensing volume around $10^{-14} \\lambda^3$ (50 femto-liters). This corresponds\nto an improvement of two-order of magnitude in the magnetic sensing volume\ncompared with the best cavity based spectrometers while maintaining a similar\nsensitivity as those spectrometers . Our artificial atom is suitable for\nscaling down and thus paves the way for measuring single spins on the nanometer\nscale.\n", "  We study the steady state of two coupled two-level atoms interacting with a\nnon-equilibrium environment that consists of two heat baths at different\ntemperatures. Specifically, we analyze four cases with respect to the\nconfiguration about the interactions between atoms and heat baths. Using\nsecular approximation, the conventional master equation usually neglects\nsteady-state coherence, even when the system is coupled with a non-equilibrium\nenvironment. When employing the master equation with no secular approximation,\nwe find that the system coherence in our model, denoted by the off-diagonal\nterms in the reduced density matrix spanned by the eigenvectors of the system\nHamiltonian, would survive after a long-time decoherence evolution. The\nabsolute value of residual coherence in the system relies on different\nconfigurations of interaction channels between the system and the heat baths.\nWe find that a large steady quantum coherence term can be achieved when the two\natoms are resonant. The absolute value of quantum coherence decreases in the\npresence of additional atom-bath interaction channels. Our work sheds new light\non the mechanism of steady-state coherence in microscopic quantum systems in\nnon-equilibrium environments.\n", "  High temporal stability and spin dynamics of individual nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters in diamond crystals make them one of the most promising quantum\nemitters operating at room temperature. We demonstrate a chip-integrated\ncavity-coupled emission into propagating surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes\nnarrowing NV center's broad emission bandwidth with enhanced coupling\nefficiency. The cavity resonator consists of two distributed Bragg mirrors that\nare built at opposite sides of the coupled NV emitter and are integrated with a\ndielectric-loaded SPP waveguide (DLSPPW), using electron-beam lithography of\nhydrogen silsesquioxane resist deposited on silver-coated silicon substrates. A\nquality factor of ~ 70 for the cavity (full width at half maximum ~ 10 nm) with\nfull tunability of the resonance wavelength is demonstrated. An up to 42-fold\ndecay rate enhancement of the spontaneous emission at the cavity resonance is\nachieved, indicating high DLSPPW mode confinement.\n", "  The origin of the high-frequency radio emission detected from several\nmagnetars is poorly understood. In this paper, we report the ~40 GHz properties\nof SGR J1745-29 as measured using Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and Robert C.\nByrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations between 2013 October 26 and 2014\nMay 31. Our analysis of a Q-band (45 GHz) GBT observation on 2014 April 10\nresulted in the earliest detection of pulsed radio emission at high frequencies\n(>20 GHz); we found that the average pulse has a singly peaked profile with\nwidth ~75 ms (~2% of the 3.764 s pulse period) and an average pulsed flux\ndensity of ~100 mJy. We also detected very bright, short (<10 ms) single pulses\nduring ~70% of this neutron star's rotations, and the peak flux densities of\nthese bright pulses follow the same log-normal distribution as measured at 8.5\nGHz. Additionally, our analysis of contemporaneous JVLA observations suggest\nthat its 41/44 GHz flux density varied between ~1-4 mJy during this period,\nwith a ~2x change observed on ~20 minute timescales during a JVLA observation\non 2014 May 10. Such a drastic change over short time-scales is inconsistent\nwith the radio emission resulting from a shock powered by the magnetar's\nsupersonic motion through the surrounding medium, and instead is dominated by\npulsed emission generated in its magnetosphere.\n", "  I undertake an anatomy of the nuclear electric-dipole spectrum and discuss\nselected observations. First, using data and calculations on 208Pb as a\nrepresentative case, I identify five conspicuous structures in the spectra of\nheavy nuclei: (1) the giant dipole resonance (GDR), (2) the dipole compression\nmode, (3) the isoscalar low-energy dipole mode (IS-LED),(4) the isoscalar mode\nin the region of the GDR, and (5) a concentration of \"pygmy\" dipole strength\n(PDS) between the latter two. Next, compiling the data from Texas A&M I show\nthat the energy of (4) follows roughly a A^{-1/6} dependence on the mass\nnumber. Finally, I summarize recent theoretical studies on the PDS in exotic\nnuclei, which suggest a strong influence of shell effects and loose binding.\n", "  We realize Mn $\\delta$-doping into Si and Si/Ge interfaces using Mn atomic\nchains on Si(001). Highly sensitive X-ray absorption fine structure techniques\nreveal that encapsulation at room temperature prevents the formation of\nsilicides / germanides whilst maintaining one dimensional anisotropic\nstructures. This is revealed by studying both the incident X-ray polarization\ndependence and post-annealing effects. Density functional theory calculations\nsuggest that Mn atoms are located at substitutional sites, and show good\nagreement with experiment. A comprehensive magnetotransport study reveals\nmagnetic ordering within the Mn $\\delta$-doped layer, which is present at\naround 120\\,K. We demonstrate that doping methods based on the burial of\nsurface nanostructures allows for the realization of systems for which\nconventional doping methods fail.\n", "  The question on whether or not weakly bound states should be effectively\nincorporated in a hadronic representation of the QCD partition function is\naddressed by analyzing the example of the $X(3872)$, a resonance close to the\n$D\\bar D^*$ threshold which has been suggested as an example of a loosely bound\nmolecule. This can be decided by studying the $D \\bar D^*$ scattering\nphase-shifts in the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ channel and their contribution to the level\ndensity in the continuum, which also gives information on its abundance in a\nhot medium. In this work, it is shown that, in a purely molecular picture, the\nbound state contribution cancels the continuum, resulting in a null occupation\nnumber density at finite temperature, which implies the $X(3872)$ does not\ncount below the Quark-Gluon Plasma crossover ($T \\sim 150$MeV). However, if a\nnon-zero $c \\bar c$ component is present in the $X(3872)$ wave function such\ncancellation does not occur for temperatures above $T\\gtrsim 250$MeV.\n", "  In this work we consider the classical non-linear Boltzmann equation, where\nthe unknown is the distribution function $f$, which depends on the time $t$,\nthe vector $\\mathbf{x}$ (the position of a molecule) and its velocity\n$\\mathbf{\\xi}$. From the Boltzmann equation we derive a semi-discrete model,\nwhich consists in a set of partial differential equations in time and space.\nThe new unknowns are two moments of the distribution function $f$ and,\naccording to a finite volume scheme, integrals of $f$ with respect to the\nvelocity $\\mathbf{\\xi}$, over bounded and open sets. We do not introduce any\napproximation for the partial derivatives with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$ and the\ntime $t$. We also propose the use of truncated octahedra as bounded domains of\nintegration. This reduces both the computing complexity and the number of the\nconstant numerical coefficients arising from the collision operator. All the\nnumerical parameters can be obtained by means of numerical quadrature.\n", "  A three-orbital model derived from the two-dimensional projection of the $ab$\n$initio$ Hamiltonian for alkaline doped fullerene A$_3$C$_{60}$ with A=Cs,Rb,K\nis studied by a variational Monte Carlo method. We correctly reproduce the\nexperimental isotropic s-wave superconductivity around the $ab$ $initio$\nparameters. With narrowing the bandwidth, the transition to an insulator is\nalso reproduced, where orbital symmetry is found to be spontaneously broken\nwith emergence of an excitonic Mott insulator for two orbitals and an\nantiferromagnetic insulator nearly degenerate with a spin liquid for the third\norbital. The superconductivity is a consequence of exciton melting.\n", "  The advent of high density 3D wide azimuth survey configurations has greatly\nincreased the cost of seismic acquisition. Simultaneous source acquisition\npresents an opportunity to decrease costs by reducing the survey time. Source\ntime delays are typically long enough for seismic reflection energy to decay to\nnegligible levels before firing another source. Simultaneous source acquisition\nabandons this minimum time restriction and allows interference between seismic\nsources to compress the survey time. Seismic data processing methods must\naddress the interference introduced by simultaneous overlapping sources.\nSimultaneous source data are characterized by high amplitude interference\nartefacts that may be stronger than the primary signal. These large amplitudes\nare due to the time delay between sources and the rapid decay of seismic energy\nwith arrival time. Therefore, source interference will appear as outliers in\ndenoising algorithms that make use of a Radon transform. This will reduce the\naccuracy of Radon transform de-noising especially for weak signals. Formulating\nthe Radon transform as an inverse problem with an L1 misfit makes it robust to\noutliers caused by source interference. This provides the ability to attenuate\nstrong source interference while preserving weak underlying signal. In order to\nimprove coherent signal focusing, an apex shifted hyperbolic Radon transform\n(ASHRT) is used to remove source interferences. ASHRT transform basis functions\nare tailored to match the travel time hyperbolas of reflections in common\nreceiver gathers. However, the ASHRT transform has a high computational cost\ndue to the extension of the model dimensions by scanning for apex locations. By\nreformulating the ASHRT operator using a Stolt migration/demigration kernel\nthat exploits the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the computational efficiency of\nthe operator is drastically improved.\n", "  The impact of non-equilibrium effects on the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions\nis investigated by comparing a non-equilibrium transport approach, the\nParton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD), to a 2D+1 viscous hydrodynamical model,\nwhich is based on the assumption of local equilibrium and conservation laws.\nStarting the hydrodynamical model from the same non-equilibrium initial\ncondition as in the PHSD, using an equivalent lQCD Equation-of-State (EoS), the\nsame transport coefficients, i.e. shear viscosity $\\eta$ and the bulk viscosity\n$\\zeta$ in the hydrodynamical model, we compare the time evolution of the\nsystem in terms of energy density, Fourier transformed energy density, spatial\nand momentum eccentricities and ellipticity in order to quantify the traces of\nnon-equilibrium phenomena. In addition, we also investigate the role of initial\npre-equilibrium flow on the hydrodynamical evolution and demonstrate its\nimportance for final state observables. We find that due to non-equilibrium\neffects, the event-by-event transport calculations show large fluctuations in\nthe collective properties, while ensemble averaged observables are close to the\nhydrodynamical results.\n", "  Based on our photometric observations in 2015-2016 and archival photometric\ndata for the active red giant PZ Mon, we have found the main characteristics of\nthe stellar surface: the unspotted surface temperature Teff=4730K, the spot\ntemperature Tspot=3500K, and the relative spot area from 30 to 40%. The best\nagreement with the observations has been achieved in our three-spot model\nincluding a cool polar spot with a temperature of about 3500K as well as large\nand small warm spots with a temperature of about 4500K. The stable polar spot\nis responsible for the long-period brightness variations. Its presence is\nconfirmed by an analysis of the TiO 7054$~\\AA$ molecular band. The\nsmall-amplitude 34-day variability is attributable to the warm spots located on\nthe side of the secondary component, which determine the relatively stable\nactive longitude.\n", "  We study and formulate the Lagrangian for the LC, RC, RL, and RLC circuits by\nusing the analogy concept with the mechanical problem in classical mechanics\nformulations. We found that the Lagrangian for the LC and RLC circuits are\ngoverned by two terms i. e. kinetic energy-like and potential energy-like\nterms. The Lagrangian for the RC circuit is only a contribution from the\npotential energy-like term and the Lagrangian for the RL circuit is only from\nthe kinetic energy-like term.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a method to control the relative amount of\nquantum and classical energy correlations between two photons from a pair\nemitted by spontaneous parametric downconversion. Decoherence in the energy\nbasis is achieved by applying random spectral phases on the photons. As a\nconsequence a diverging temporal second order correlation function is observed\nand is explained by a mixture between an energy entangled pure state and a\nfully classically correlated mixte state.\n", "  We study the extent to which the outcomes of a quantum measurement can be\nmanipulated by changing the state of the measurement apparatus. The measurement\nprocess is modeled as decoherence induced by the experimenter, to gain\nknowledge about a particular system. The measurement apparatus is assumed to\ncontain a large number of degrees of freedom, and the measurement outcomes are\nobtained by looking at the long interaction time limit. We study two cases\nwhich show contrasting behaviour. With a fixed axis coupling, the measurement\nis performed along the pointer basis with a high degree of robustness, for a\nwide variety of bath states. In a second model with Heisenberg interactions,\nthe measurement outcomes can be altered considerably by changing the state of\nthe bath.\n", "  We report on self-consistent calculations of $\\bar{p}$ quasi-bound states in\nselected nuclei performed within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model\nemploying $\\bar{p}$ coupling constants tuned to reproduce $\\bar{p}$-atom data.\nWe confirmed considerable polarization of the nuclear core induced by the\nantiproton. The $\\bar{p}$ annihilation was treated dynamically, taking into\naccount the reduced phase space in the nuclear medium as well as the compressed\nnuclear density. The energy available for the annihilation products was\nevaluated self-consistently, considering additional energy shift due to\nparticle momenta in the ${\\bar p}$-nucleus system. Next, we constructed the\n$\\bar{p}$-nucleus optical potential using scattering amplitudes related to the\nlatest version of the Paris $\\bar{N}N$ potential. We explored energy dependence\nof the potential and the implications for $\\bar{p}$-nucleus quasi-bound states.\n", "  Spin-isospin excitation of ${}^3$He nucleus by proton-induced charge-exchange\nreaction, ${}^3\\mathrm{He}(p,n)ppp$, at forward neutron scattering angle is\nstudied in a plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA). In PWIA, cross sections\nof the reaction is written in terms of proton-neutron scattering amplitudes and\nresponse functions of the transition from ${}^{3}$He to three-proton state by\nspin-isospin transition operators. The response functions are calculated with\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon potential models using a Faddeev three-body method.\nCalculated cross sections agree with available experimental data in substance.\nPossible effects arising from the uncertainty of proton-neutron amplitudes and\nthree-nucleon interactions in three-proton system are examined.\n", "  Mechanical interactions between biological cells may be mediated by secreted\nproducts, making them dependent on the local particle density. Here, we explore\nthe generic physics of density-dependent attractive interactions. We show using\nBrownian dynamics simulations that density-dependent interactions can produce\ninteresting phase separation behaviour including control of aggregate size\nduring a spinodal decomposition-like separation process. We show that these\nresults are generic using continuum modelling of the appropriate Cahn-Hilliard\nequation. Our study suggests that density-dependent interactions can provide a\ngeneric mechanism for control of aggregate size during phase separation.\n", "  Over the last decades, the field of thermal neutron detection has\noverwhelmingly employed He-3-based technologies. The He-3 crisis together with\nthe forthcoming establishment of the European Spallation Source have\nnecessitated the development of new technologies for neutron detection. Today,\nseveral promising He-3-free candidates are under detailed study and need to be\nvalidated. This validation process is in general long and expensive. The study\nof detector prototypes using neutron-emitting radioactive sources is a\ncost-effective solution, especially for preliminary investigations. That said,\nneutron-emitting sources have the general disadvantage of broad, structured,\nemitted-neutron energy ranges. Further, the emitted neutrons often compete with\nunwanted backgrounds of gamma-rays, alpha-particles, and fission-fragments. By\nblending experimental infrastructure such as shielding to provide particle\nbeams with neutron-detection techniques such as tagging, disadvantages may be\nconverted into advantages. In particular, a technique known as tagging involves\nexploiting the mixed-field generally associated with a neutron-emitting source\nto determine neutron time-of-flight and thus energy on an event-by-event basis.\nThis allows for the definition of low-cost, precision neutron beams. The\nSource-Testing Facility, located at Lund University in Sweden and operated by\nthe SONNIG Group of the Division of Nuclear Physics, was developed for just\nsuch low-cost studies. Precision tagged-neutron beams derived from radioactive\nsources are available around-the-clock for advanced detector diagnostic\nstudies. Neutron measurements performed at the Source Testing Facility are thus\ncost-effective and have a very low barrier for entry. In this paper, we present\nan overview of the project.\n", "  This study presents a detailed examination of the lattice distortions\nintroduced by glancing incidence Focussed Ion Beam (FIB) milling. Using\nnon-destructive multi-reflection Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction we probe\ndamage formation in an initially pristine gold micro-crystal following several\nstages of FIB milling. These experiments allow access to the full lattice\nstrain tensor in the micro-crystal with ~25 nm 3D spatial resolution, enabling\na nano-scale analysis of residual lattice strains and defects formed. Our\nresults show that 30 keV glancing incidence milling produces fewer large\ndefects than normal incidence milling at the same energy. However the resulting\nresidual lattice strains have similar magnitude and extend up to ~50 nm into\nthe sample. At the edges of the milled surface, where the ion-beam tails impact\nthe sample at near-normal incidence, large dislocation loops with a range of\nburgers vectors are formed. Further glancing incidence FIB polishing with 5 keV\nion energy removes these dislocation loops and reduces the lattice strains\ncaused by higher energy FIB milling. However, even at the lower ion energy,\ndamage-induced lattice strains are present within a ~20 nm thick surface layer.\nThese results highlight the need for careful consideration and management of\nFIB damage. They also show that low-energy FIB-milling is an effective tool for\nremoving FIB-milling induced lattice strains. This is important for the\npreparation of micro-mechanical test specimens and strain microscopy samples.\n", "  Solid interfaces have intrinsic elasticity. However, in most experiments,\nthis is obscured by bulk stresses. Through microscopic observations of the\ncontact-line geometry of a partially wetting droplet on an anisotropically\nstretched substrate, we measure two surface-elastic constants that quantify the\nlinear dependence of the surface stress of a soft polymer gel on its strain.\nWith these two parameters, one can predict surface stresses for general\ndeformations of the material in the linear-elastic limit.\n", "  Recent works have shown that small shifts in redshift -- gravitational\nredshift or systematic errors -- could potentially cause a significant bias in\nthe estimation of cosmological parameters. I aim to verify whether a\ntheoretical correction on redshift is sufficient to ease the tension between\nthe estimates of cosmological parameters from SNe 1a dataset and Planck 2015\nresults. A free parameter for redshift shift($\\Delta z$) is implemented in the\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator. Redshift error was estimated from the Joint\nLight-curve Analysis(JLA) dataset and results from the Planck 2015 survey. The\nestimation from JLA dataset alone gives a best fit value of $\\Omega_m = 0.272$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.390$, and $\\Delta z = 3.77 \\times 10^{-4}$. The best fit\nvalues of both $\\Omega_m$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ disagrees heavily with results\nfrom other observations. Information criteria and observed density contrasts\nsuggest that the current data from SNe 1a is not accurate enough to give a\nproper estimate of $\\Delta z$. A joint analysis with Planck results seems to\ngive a more plausible value of the redshift error, and can potentially be used\nas a probe to measure our local gravitational environment.\n", "  The present work addressed in this thesis introduces, for the first time, the\nuse of tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) sensors for accurate, real-time, and\nin-situ characterization of CVD and ALD processes for noble metals, but with a\nparticular focus on gold due to its desirable optical and plasmonic properties.\nThrough the use of orthogonally-polarized transverse electric (TE) and\ntransverse magnetic (TM) resonance modes imposed by a boundary condition at the\ncladding-metal interface of the optical fiber, polarization-dependent\nresonances excited by the TFBG are easily decoupled. It was found that for\nultrathin thicknesses of gold films from CVD (~6-65 nm), the anisotropic\nproperty of these films made it non-trivial to characterize their effective\noptical properties such as the real component of the permittivity.\nNevertheless, the TFBG introduces a new sensing platform to the ALD and CVD\ncommunity for extremely sensitive in-situ process monitoring. We later also\ndemonstrate thin film growth at low (<10 cycle) numbers for the well-known\nAl2O3 thermal ALD process, as well as the plasma-enhanced gold ALD process.\nFinally, the use of ALD-grown gold coatings has been employed for the\ndevelopment of a plasmonic TFBG-based sensor with ultimate refractometric\nsensitivity (~550 nm/RIU).\n", "  We study the higher moments of the baryon number in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the QCD critical endpoint within the framework of Ising-QCD\nthermodynamics (N.~G. Antoniou {\\it et al}, arXiv:1705.09124 [hep-ph]). We show\nthat the kurtosis, as a function of the freeze-out baryon chemical potential,\nattains a sharp minimum very close to the critical point. We argue that the\nsharpness of this minimum is due to the narrowness of the critical region in\nthe chemical potential direction. Our analysis reveals that the broad minimum\nof the kurtosis observed in Au+Au central collisions at STAR (in RHIC-BES I) in\nthe colliding energy region $17$ GeV $< ~\\sqrt{s}~<$ $39$ GeV is apparently\nonly a precursor of the critical point and not a signature of its location.\n", "  In this paper, the approximate analitical solutions of the hyper-radial\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation are obtained for the generalized Wood-Saxon potential\nby implementing the Pekeris approximation to surmount the centrifugal term. The\nenergy eigenvalues and corresponding hyper-radial wave functions are found for\nany angular momentum case via the Nikiforov-Uvarov (NU) and Supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics (SUSY QM) methods. Hence, the same expressions are obtained\nfor the energy eigenvalues, and the expression of hyper-radial wave functions\ntransformed each other is shown owing to these methods. Furthermore, a finite\nnumber energy spectrum depending on the depths of the potential well $V_{0}$\nand $W$, the radial $n_{r}$ and $l$ orbital quantum numbers and parameters\n$D,a,R_{0}$ are also identified in detail. Finally, the bound state energies\nand the corresponding normalized hyper-radial wave functions for the neutron\nsystem of the a $^{56} Fe$ nucleus are calculated in $D=2$ and $D=3$, as well\nas the energy spectrum expressions of other highest dimensions are identified\nby using the energy spectrum of $D=2$ and $D=3$.\n", "  In this paper, we report first principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory to reveal the effects of selected adatoms (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg,\nCa, B, C, N, O, Al, Si, P, Ga, Ge, As, Se and S) adsorption on GaX ( where X=S,\nSe) monolayers. It is found that all adatoms adsorbed on GaX monolayers can\nform strong chemisorption bonds except for Mg atom due to weak bonding nature\nof Mg atom with early 3d transition metals. Most of the adatoms of the same\ngroup elements of the periodic table are bound to GaX substrates at the same\nadsorption sites. All adatoms stayed above the upper layer of GaX sheets except\nfor Be adatom on GaSe substrate and overall hexagonal geometry has been\nretained. The electronic structures are modified by locally through the\nsupercell calculations. Specific adatoms, such as C, Si, Ge, N, P and As give\nrise to spin polarization and attain integer magnetic moments and hence can\ncontribute half metallic character to the system. Our results can serve as a\nbasis for future experimental and theoretical studies of adsorption on GaX.\n", "  Occupying a position between entanglement and Bell nonlocality,\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering has attracted increasing attention in\nrecent years. Many criteria have been proposed and experimentally implemented\nto characterize EPR-steering. Nevertheless, only a few results are available to\nquantify steerability using analytical results. In this work, we propose a\nmethod for quantifying the steerability in two-qubit quantum states in the\ntwo-setting EPR-steering scenario, using the connection between joint\nmeasurability and steerability. We derive an analytical formula for the\nsteerability of a class of X-states. The sufficient and necessary conditions\nfor two-setting EPRsteering are presented. Based on these results, a class of\nasymmetric states, namely, one-way steerable states, are obtained.\n", "  Oxygen vacancy formation energy is an important quantity for enabling fast\noxygen diffusion and oxygen catalysis in technologies like solid oxide fuel\ncells. Both previous literature in various systems and our calculations in\nLaMnO3, La0.75Sr0.25MnO3, LaFeO3, and La0.75Sr0.25FeO3, show mixed results for\nthe direction and magnitude of the change in vacancy formation energy with\nstrain. This paper develops a model to make sense of the different trend shapes\nin vacancy formation energy versus strain. We model strain effects using a set\nof consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated\nresults may be simply explained in terms of vacancy formation volume and\nchanges in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive\nvacancy formation volume contributes to decreased vacancy formation energy\nunder tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to\nincreases in vacancy formation energy with compressive and tensile strains, and\nvice versa. The vacancy formation volume dominates the linear portion of the\nvacancy formation energy strain response, while its curvature is governed by\nthe vacancy-induced change in elastic constants. We show results sensitive to\nB-site cation, A-site doping, tilt system, and vacancy placement, which\ncontributions may be averaged under thermally averaged conditions. In general,\nvacancy formation energies for most systems calculated here decreased with\ntensile strain, with about a 30-100 meV/% strain decrease with biaxial strain\nfor those systems which showed a decrease in vacancy formation energy.\nExperimental verification is necessary to confirm the model outside of\ncalculation.\n", "  Non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries depend critically on the reversible\nformation/decomposition of metal oxides on cycling. Irreversible parasitic\nreactions cause poor rechargeability, efficiency, and cycle life and have\npredominantly been ascribed to the reactivity of reduced oxygen species with\ncell components. These species, however, cannot fully explain the side\nreactions. Here we show that singlet oxygen forms at the cathode of a\nlithium-oxygen cell during discharge and from the onset of charge, and accounts\nfor the majority of parasitic reaction products. The amount increases during\ndischarge, early stages of charge, and charging at higher voltages, and is\nenhanced by the presence of trace water. Superoxide and peroxide appear to be\ninvolved in singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxygen traps and quenchers can\nreduce parasitic reactions effectively. Awareness of the highly reactive\nsinglet oxygen in non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries gives a rationale for\nfuture research towards achieving highly reversible cell operation.\n", "  In this note, the non-relativistic Doppler spectrum of the Unruh radiation\nfrom an accelerating mass is determined. Additionally, the scattering of\nthermal bath photons off an accelerating electron in an electromagnetic field,\nas seen by a non-laboratory frame inertial observer, is examined.\n", "  Using BRITE photometric data for several close binary systems we address the\nproblem of damping pulsations in close binary systems due to proximity effects.\nBecause of small number statistics, no firm conclusion is given, but we find\npulsations in three relatively close binaries. The pulsations in these binaries\nhave, however, very low amplitudes.\n", "  We present optical BVRI and near-infrared YJHK_s photometry of the normal\nType Ia supernova 2005df, obtained with the CTIO 1.3-m and 0.9-m telescopes.\nThe B- and V-band photometry, S-corrected to the filter prescriptions of\nBessell(1990), matches the corresponding photometry from the ANU published by\nMilne et al. (2010). The R-band photometry from CTIO and ANU matches well\nwithout any corrections. A combination of V-band and near-IR photometry shows\nthat SN 2005df is unreddened in its host galaxy. Spectropolarimetry of this\nsupernova was obtained with the VLT, and the distance to the host galaxy is\nbeing determined from observations of Cepheids using the Hubble Space\nTelescope.\n", "  Time-series photometry from space in the ultraviolet can be presently done\nwith only a few platforms, none of which is able to provide wide-field\nlong-term high-cadence photometry. We present a concept of UVSat, a twin space\ntelescope which will be capable to perform this kind of photometry, filling an\nobservational niche. The satellite will host two telescopes, one for\nobservations in the ultraviolet, the other for observations in the optical\nband. We also briefly show what science can be done with UVSat.\n", "  We compare the cosmology of conformal gravity (CG), (Mannheim 2006), to\n$\\Lambda$CDM. CG cosmology has repulsive matter and radiation on cosmological\nscales, while retaining attractive gravity at local scales. Mannheim (2003)\nfinds that CG agrees with $\\Lambda$CDM for supernova data at redshifts $z<1$.\nWe use GRBs and quasars as standard candles to contrast these models in the\nredshift range $0<z<8$. We find CG deviates significantly from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nhigh redshift and that $\\Lambda$CDM is favoured by the data with\n$\\Delta\\chi^2=48$. Mannheim's model has a bounded dark energy contribution, but\nwe identify a $\\lambda$ fine-tuning problem and a cosmic coincidence problem.\n", "  We study the in-medium propagation of low-lying charmonium states: $J/\\Psi$,\n$\\Psi$(3686), and $\\Psi$(3770) in a $\\bar p$ Au $10$ GeV collision. This energy\nregime will be available for the PANDA experiment. The time evolution of the\nspectral functions of the charmonium states is studied with a BUU type\ntransport model. We observe a substantial effect of the medium in the dilepton\nspectrum.\n", "  Simulations inform all aspects of modern astrophysical research, ranging in\nscale from 1D and 2D test problems that can run in seconds on an astronomer's\nlaptop all the way to large-scale 3D calculations that run on the largest\nsupercomputers, with a spectrum of data sizes and shapes filling the landscape\nbetween these two extremes. I review the diversity of astrophysics simulation\ndata formats commonly in use by researchers, providing an overview of the most\ncommon simulation techniques, including pure N-body dynamics, smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH), adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and unstructured meshes.\nAdditionally, I highlight methods for incorporating physical phenomena that are\nimportant for astrophysics, including chemistry, magnetic fields, radiative\ntransport, and \"subgrid\" recipes for important physics that cannot be directly\nresolved in a simulation. In addition to the numerical techniques, I also\ndiscuss the communities that have developed around these simulation codes and\nargue that increasing use and availability of open community codes has\ndramatically lowered the barrier to entry for novice simulators.\n", "  With social media penetration deepening among both citizens and political\nfigures, there is a pressing need to understand whether and how political use\nof major platforms is electorally influential. Particularly, the literature\nfocused on campaign usage is thin and often describe the engagement strategies\nof politicians or attempt to quantify the impact of social media engagement on\npolitical learning, participation, or voting. Few have considered implications\nfor campaign fundraising despite its recognized importance in American\npolitics. This paper is the first to quantify a financial payoff for social\nmedia campaigning. Drawing on candidate-level data from Facebook and Twitter,\nGoogle Trends, Wikipedia page views, and Federal Election Commission (FEC)\ndonation records, we analyze the relationship between the topic and volume of\nsocial media content and campaign funds received by all 108 candidates in the\n2016 US Senate general elections. By applying an unsupervised learning approach\nto identify themes in candidate content across the platforms, we find that more\nfrequent posting overall and of issue-related content are associated with\nhigher donation income when controlling for incumbency, state population, and\ninformation-seeking about a candidate, though campaigning-related content has a\nstronger effect than the latter when the number rather than value of donations\nis considered.\n", "  The aim of this note is to discuss the relation between one-parameter\ncontinuous symmetries of the dynamics, defined on physical grounds, and\nconservation laws. In the Hamiltonian formulation, such symmetries of the\ndynamics in general leave the Hamiltonian invariant only up to a total\nderivative $ d G(q)/d t$ . In this more general case, the corresponding\nformulation of Noether theorem gives that the conservation law displays a sort\nof ano\\-ma\\-ly, the constant of motion being the sum of the canonical generator\nof the symmetry transformations plus the generator $G$ of the gauge\ntransformation $q_i \\rightarrow q_i$, $p_i \\rightarrow p_i - \\partial G/\n\\partial q_i$.\n", "  The electronic ground state of Ca3LiOsO6 was recently considered within an\nintermediate coupling regime that revealed J=3/2 spin-orbit entangled magnetic\nmoments. Through inelastic neutron scattering and density functional theory we\ninvestigate the magnetic interactions and probe how the magnetism is influenced\nby the change in hierarchy of interactions as we move from Ca3LiOsO6 (5d3) to\nCa3LiRuO6 (4d3). An alteration of the spin-gap and ordered local moment is\nobserved, however the magnetic structure, Neel temperature and exchange\ninteractions are unaltered. To explain this behavior it is necessary to include\nboth spin-orbit coupling and hybridization, indicating the importance of an\nintermediate coupling approach when describing 5$d$ oxides.\n", "  Recommender systems, inferring users' preferences from their historical\nactivities and personal profiles, have been an enormous success in the last\nseveral years. Most of the existing works are based on the similarities of\nusers, objects or both that derived from their purchases records in the online\nshopping platforms. Such approaches, however, are facing bottlenecks when the\nknown information is limited. The extreme case is how to recommend products to\nnew users, namely the so-called cold-start problem. The rise of the online\nsocial networks gives us a chance to break the glass ceiling. Birds of a\nfeather flock together. Close friends may have similar hidden pattern of\nselecting products and the advices from friends are more trustworthy.\n  In this paper, we integrate the individual's social relationships into\nrecommender systems and propose a new method, called Social Mass Diffusion\n(SMD), based on a mass diffusion process in the combined network of users'\nsocial network and user-item bipartite network. The results show that the SMD\nalgorithm can achieve higher recommendation accuracy than the Mass Diffusion\n(MD) purely on the bipartite network. Especially, the improvement is striking\nfor small degree users. Moreover, SMD provides a good solution to the\ncold-start problem. The recommendation accuracy for new users significantly\nhigher than that of the conventional popularity-based algorithm. These results\nmay shed some light on the new designs of better personalized recommender\nsystems and information services.\n", "  First-principles crystal structure search is performed to predict novel\nrubidium poly-nitrogen materials at high pressure by varying the stoichiometry,\ni. e. relative quantities of the constituent rubidium and nitrogen atoms. Three\ncompounds of high nitrogen content, RbN_{5}, RbN_{2}, and Rb_{4}N_{6}, are\ndiscovered. Rubidium pentazolate (RbN5) becomes thermodynamically stable at\npressures above \\unit[30]{GPa}. The charge transfer from Rb to N atoms enables\naromaticity in cyclo-N_{^{_{5}}}^{-} while increasing the ionic bonding in the\ncrystal. Rubidium pentazolate can be synthesized by compressing rubidium azide\n(RbN3) and nitrogen (N2) precursors above \\unit[9.42]{GPa}, and its\nexperimental discovery is aided by calculating the Raman spectrum and\nidentifying the features attributed to N_{^{_{5}}}^{-} modes. The two other\ninteresting compounds, RbN2 containing infinitely-long single-bonded nitrogen\nchains, and Rb_{4}N_{6} consisting of single-bonded N_{6} hexazine rings,\nbecome thermodynamically stable at pressures exceeding \\unit[60]{GPa}. In\naddition to the compounds with high nitrogen content, Rb_{3}N_{3}, a new\ncompound with 1:1 RbN stoichiometry containing bent N_{3} azides is found to\nexist at high pressures.\n", "  We report the preliminary measurement of the $CP$ asymmetry of the $D^0\n\\rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$ decay, which is consistent with no $CP$ violation and\nimproves the uncertainty with respect to the previous measurement of this\nquantity by more than a factor of three. Also, the expected precision on $CP$\nasymmetry of the $D^0 \\rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$ decay by the Belle II experiment\nis presented.\n", "  The top quark, the heaviest known elementary particle discovered at the\nFermilab Tevatron more than twenty years ago, has taken a central role in the\nstudy of fundamental interactions. Due to its large mass, the top quark\nprovides a unique environment for tests of the standard model. With a\ncumulative luminosity of more than 100~fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\\sqrt{s}=7,8,13$\nTeV by each of the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in\nthe first ten years of operation, top quark physics is probing uncharted\nterritories in precision and rare measurements with sensitivity to New Physics\nprocesses. This document summarizes the latest experimental measurements and\nstudies of top quark properties.\n", "  We consider the process of pumping charge through an open quantum system,\nmotivated by the example of a quantum dot with strong repulsive or attractive\nelectron-electron interaction. Using the geometric formulation of adiabatic\nnonunitary evolution put forward by Sarandy and Lidar, we derive an\nencompassing approach to ideal charge measurements of time-dependently driven\ntransport, that stays near the familiar approach to closed systems. Following\nSchaller, Kie{\\ss}lich and Brandes we explicitly account for a meter that\nregisters the transported charge outside the system. The gauge freedom\nunderlying geometric pumping effects in all moments of the transported charge\nemerges naturally as the calibration of this meter. Remarkably, we find that\ngeometric and physical considerations cannot be applied independently as done\nin closed systems: physical recalibrations do not form a group due to\nconstraints of positivity (Bochner's theorem). This complication goes unnoticed\nwhen considering only the average charge but it is relevant for understanding\nthe origin of geometric effects in the higher moments of the charge-transport\nstatistics. As an application we derive two prominent existing approaches to\npumping, based on full-counting-statistics (FCS) and adiabatic-response (AR),\nrespectively, from our approach in a transparent way. This allows us to\nreconcile all their apparent incompatibilities, in particular the puzzle how\nfor the average charge the nonadiabatic stationary-state AR result can exactly\nagree with the adiabatic nonstationary FCS result. We relate this and other\ndifficulties to a single characteristic of geometric approaches to open\nsystems: the system-environment boundary can always be chosen to either include\nor exclude the ideal charge meter. This leads to a physically motivated\nrelation between the mixed-state Berry phase and the entirely different\ngeometric phase of Landsberg.\n", "  In this paper we consider Wigner random matrices -- symmetric n by n random\nmatrices whose entries are independent identically distributed real random\nvariables. We prove that the probability distribution of one or several\neigenvalues close to the center of the spectrum does not depend on the\nprobability distribution of the entries of the matrix and is the same as for\nthe Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. We make only mild smoothness assumptions on\nthe probability distribution of the entries and assume that the probability\ndistribution of the entries decays polynomially with sufficiently large power\nor faster than polynomially.\n", "  We report a neutral salt water based battery which uses p-type and n-type\nsolution processed polymer films as the cathode and the anode of the cell. The\nspecific capacity of the electrodes (approximately 30 mAh cm-3) is achieved via\nformation of bipolarons in both the p-type and n-type polymers. By engineering\nethylene glycol and zwitterion based side chains attached to the polymer\nbackbone we facilitate rapid ion transport through the non-porous polymer\nfilms. This, combined with efficient transport of electronic charge via the\nconjugated polymer backbones, allowed the films to maintain constant capacity\nat high charge and discharge rates (>1000 C-rate). The electrodes also show\ngood stability during electrochemical cycling (less than 30% decrease in\ncapacity over >1000 cycles) and an output voltage up to 1.4 V. The performance\nof these semiconducting polymers with polar side-chains demonstrates the\npotential of this material class for fast-charging, water based electrochemical\nenergy storage devices.\n", "  We show that the Hilbert space spanned by a continuously parametrized\nwavefunction family---i.e., a quantum state manifold---is dominated by a\nsubspace, onto which all member states have close to unity projection weight.\nIts characteristic dimensionality $D_P$ is much smaller than the full Hilbert\nspace dimension, and is equivalent to a statistical complexity measure\n$e^{S_2}$, where $S_2$ is the $2^{nd}$ Renyi entropy of the manifold. In the\nthermodynamic limit, $D_P$ closely approximates the quantum geometric volume of\nthe manifold under the Fubini-Study metric, revealing an intriguing connection\nbetween information and geometry. This connection persists in compact manifolds\nsuch as a twisted boundary phase, where the corresponding geometric\ncircumference is lower bounded by a term proportional to its topological index,\nreminiscent of entanglement entropy.\n", "  [abridged] We investigate the nature of the luminous X-ray source population\ndetected in a (72 ks) Chandra ACIS-S observation of NGC 4038/39, the Antennae\ngalaxies. We derive the average X-ray spectral properties of sources in\ndifferent luminosity ranges, and we correlate the X-ray positions with radio,\nIR, and optical HST data. The X-ray sources are predominantly associated with\nyoung stellar clusters, indicating that they belong to the young stellar\npopulation. Based on both their co-added X-ray spectrum, and on the lack of\nassociated radio emission, we conclude that the Ultra Luminous X-ray sources\n(ULXs), with Lx>10^{39} erg\\s, are not young compact Supernova Remnants (SNR),\nbut accretion binaries. While their spectrum is consistent with those of ULXs\nstudied in nearby galaxies, and interpreted as the counterparts of intermediate\nmass black-holes (M >10-1000 \\msun), comparison with the position of\nstar-clusters suggests that some of the ULXs may be runaway binaries, thus\nsuggesting lower-mass binary systems. The co-added spectrum of the sources in\nthe 3x10^{38}-10^{39} erg\\s luminosity range is consistent with those of\nGalactic black-hole candidates. These sources are also on average displaced\nfrom neighboring star clusters. The softer spectrum of the less luminous\nsources suggests the presence of SNRs or of hot interstellar medium (ISM) in\nthe Chandra source extraction area. Comparison with HI and CO observations\nshows that most sources are detected in the outskirts of large concentrations\nof gas. The absorbing columns inferred from these observations would indeed\nabsorb X-rays up to 5 keV, so there may be several hidden X-ray sources.\nAssociated with these obscured regions we find 6 sources with heavily absorbed\nX-ray spectra and absorption-corrected luminosities in the ULX range.\n", "  The $\\kappa$-deformation of the (2+1)D anti-de Sitter, Poincar\\'e and de\nSitter groups is presented through a unified approach in which the curvature of\nthe spacetime (or the cosmological constant) is considered as an explicit\nparameter. The Drinfel'd-double and the Poisson-Lie structure underlying the\n$\\kappa$-deformation are explicitly given, and the three quantum kinematical\ngroups are obtained as quantizations of such Poisson-Lie algebras. As a\nconsequence, the non-commutative (2+1)D spacetimes that generalize the\n$\\kappa$-Minkowski space to the (anti-)de Sitter ones are obtained. Moreover,\nnoncommutative 4D spaces of (time-like) geodesics can be defined, and they can\nbe interpreted as a novel possibility to introduce non-commutative worldlines.\nFurthermore, quantum (anti-)de Sitter algebras are presented both in the known\nbasis related with 2+1 quantum gravity and in a new one which generalizes the\nbicrossproduct one. In this framework, the quantum deformation parameter is\nrelated with the Planck length, and the existence of a kind of \"duality\"\nbetween the cosmological constant and the Planck scale is also envisaged.\n", "  In this paper, we solve the eigen solutions to some nonlinear spinor\nequations, and compute several functions reflecting their characteristics. The\nnumerical results show that, the nonlinear spinor equation has only finite\nmeaningful eigen solutions, which have positive discrete mass spectra and\nanomalous magnetic moment. The nonlinear potential and interactions yield\ndifferent contributions to the total energy, and these components of the energy\nlead to different energy-speed relation. The magnitude of these components can\nbe detected by elaborate experiments. The weird properties of the nonlinear\nspinors might be closely related with the elementary particles and their\ninteractions, so some deeper investigations on them are significant.\n"]}
