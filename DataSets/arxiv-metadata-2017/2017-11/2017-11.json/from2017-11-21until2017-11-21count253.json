interaction\nof intense laser light with droplets. The electron bunches are emitted under\ncertain angles which depend on the ratios of droplet radius to wavelength and\nplasma frequency to laser frequency. The mechanism behind the multi-MeV\nattosecond electron bunch generation is investigated using Mie theory. It is\nshown that the angular distribution and the high electron energies are due to a\nparameter-sensitive, time-dependent local field enhancement at the droplet\nsurface.\n", "  Experiments on atoms in intense laser pulses and the corresponding exact ab\ninitio solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) yield\nphotoelectron spectra with low-energy features that are not reproduced by the\notherwise successful work horse of strong field laser physics: the \"strong\nfield approximation\" (SFA). In the semi-classical limit, the SFA possesses an\nappealing interpretation in terms of interfering quantum trajectories. It is\nshown that a conceptually simple extension towards the inclusion of Coulomb\neffects yields very good agreement with exact TDSE results. Moreover, the\nCoulomb quantum orbits allow for a physically intuitive interpretation and\ndetailed analysis of all low-energy features in the semi-classical regime, in\nparticular the recently discovered \"low-energy structure\" [C.I. Blaga et al.,\nNature Physics 5, 335 (2009) and W. Quan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 093001\n(2009)].\n", "  We propose a method to obtain Floquet states---also known as light-induced\nstates---and their quasi-energies from real-time wavefunctions without solving\nthe Floquet equation. This is useful for the analysis of various phenomena in\ntime-dependent quantum dynamics if the Hamiltonian is not strictly periodic, as\nin short laser pulses, for instance. There, the population of the Floquet\nstates depends on the pulse form and is automatically contained in the\nreal-time wavefunction but not in the standard Floquet approach. Several\nexamples in the area of intense laser-atom interaction are exemplarily\ndiscussed: (i) the observation of even harmonics for an inversion-symmetric\npotential with a single bound state; (ii) the dependence of the population of\nFloquet states on (gauge) transformations and the emergence of an invariant,\nobservable photoelectron spectrum; (iii) the driving of resonant transitions\nbetween dressed states, i.e., the dressing of dressed states, and (iv) spectral\nenhancements at channel closings due to the ponderomotive shift of\nabove-threshold ionization peaks.\n", "  The screening of a 2p core-hole in Na clusters is investigated using density\nfunctional theory applied to an extended jellium model with an all-electron\natom in the center. The study is related to recent experiments at the free\nelectron laser at DESY in which photoelectron spectra from mass-selected,\ncore-shell ionized metal clusters have been recorded. Relaxed and unrelaxed\nbinding energies as well as Kohn-Sham orbital energies are calculated in\nPerdew-Zunger self-interaction-corrected exchange-only local spin-density\napproximation for valence and 2p core electrons in Na clusters up to 58 atoms.\nThe relaxed binding energies follow approximately the metal-sphere behavior.\nThe same behavior is seen in the experiment for sufficiently big clusters,\nindicating perfect screening and that the relaxation energy due to screening\ngoes to the photoelectron. Instead, calculating the kinetic energy of the\nphotoelectrons using unrelaxed binding energies or Kohn-Sham orbital energies\nyields wrong results for core-shell electrons. The screening {\\em dynamics} are\ninvestigated using time-dependent density functional theory. It is shown that\nscreening occurs on two time scales, a core-shell-dependent inner-atomic and an\ninter-atomic valence electron time scale. In the case of Na 2p ionization the\nremaining electrons in the 2p shell screen within tens of attoseconds while the\nscreening due to cluster valence electrons occurs within several hundreds of\nattoseconds. The screening time-scales may be compared to the photon energy and\ncluster size-dependent escape times of the photoelectron in order to estimate\nwhether the photoelectron is capable of picking up the relaxation energy or\nwhether the residual system is left in an excited state.\n", "  We use a quantum trajectory-based semi-classical method to account for\nCoulomb interaction between the photoelectron and the parent ion in the\nclassically forbidden, sub-barrier region during strong-field tunneling\nionization processes. We show that---besides the well-known modification of the\ntunneling ionization probability---there is also an influence on the\ninterference pattern in the photoelectron spectra. In the long-wavelength\nlimit, the shift of the intra-cycle interference fringes caused by sub-barrier\nCoulomb effects in the laser polarization direction can be derived\nanalytically. We compare our results with \\emph{ab initio} solutions of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation and find good agreement in the\nlong-wavelength regime, whereas the standard strong field approximation fails.\nWe show that the nodal structure along low-order above-threshold ionization\nrings is also affected by sub-barrier Coulomb effects.\n", "  The Floquet theorem allows to reformulate periodic time-dependent problems\nsuch as the interaction of a many-body system with a laser field in terms of\ntime-independent, field-dressed states, also known as Floquet states. If this\nwas possible for density functional theory as well, one could reduce in such\ncases time-dependent density functional theory to a time-independent Floquet\ndensity functional theory. We analyze under which conditions the Floquet\ntheorem is applicable in a density-functional framework. By employing numerical\n{\\em ab initio} solutions of the interacting time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation with time-periodic external potentials we show that the exact\neffective potential in the corresponding Kohn-Sham equation is {\\em not}\nunconditionally periodic. Whenever several Floquet states in the interacting\nsystem are involved in a physical process the corresponding\nHartree-exchange-correlation potential is not periodic with the external\nfrequency only. Using an analytically solvable example we demonstrate that, in\ngeneral, the periodicity of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian cannot be\nrestored by choosing a different initial state. Only if the external periodic\npotential is sufficiently weak such that the initial state of the interacting\nsystem evolves adiabatically to a single, field-dressed state, the resulting\nKohn-Sham system admits the application of the Floquet theorem.\n", "  Grain growth experiments on thin metallic films have shown the geometric and\ntopological characteristics of the grain structure to be universal and\nindependent of many experimental conditions. The universal size distribution,\nhowever, is found to differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from the\nstandard Mullins curvature driven model of grain growth; with the experiments\nexhibiting an excess of small grains (termed an \"ear\") and an excess of very\nlarge grains (termed a \"tail\") compared with the model. While a plethora of\nextensions of the Mullins model have been proposed to explain these\ncharacteristics, none have been successful. In this work, large scale\nsimulations of a model that resolves the atomic scale on diffusive time scales,\nthe phase field crystal model, is used to examine the complex phenomena of\ngrain growth. The results are in remarkable agreement with the experimental\nresults, recovering the characteristic \"ear\" and \"tail\" features of the\nexperimental grain size distribution. The simulations also indicate that while\nthe geometric and topological characteristics are universal, the dynamic growth\nexponent is not.\n", "  We study the proximity-induced superconductivity effect in a double-stranded\nDNA by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and taking into account the\neffect of thermal fluctuations of the twist angle between neighboring base\npairs. We show that the electron conductance is spin-dependent and the\nconductance of spin up (down) increases (decreases) due to the spin-orbit\ncoupling. It is found that, for T<100K, the band gap energy is\ntemperature-independent and it decreases due to the SOC. In addition, by\nsolving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations and local gap parameter equation\nself-consistently, we find the critical temperature at which transition to\nsuperconductivity can take place.\n", "  Synthetic spin-orbit coupling in ultracold atomic gases can be taken to\nextremes rarely found in solids. We study a two dimensional Hubbard model of\nbosons in an optical lattice in the presence of spin-orbit coupling strong\nenough to drive direct transitions from Mott insulators to superfluids. Here we\nfind phase-modulated superfluids with finite momentum that are generated\nentirely by spin-orbit coupling. We investigate the rich phase patterns of the\nsuperfluids, which may be directly probed using time-of-flight imaging of the\nspin-dependent momentum distribution.\n", "  The strong field approximation (SFA) formulated in terms of so-called\n\"quantum orbits\" led to much insight into intense-laser driven ionization\ndynamics. In plain SFA, the emitted electron is treated as a free electron in\nthe laser field alone. However, with improving experimental techniques and more\nadvanced numerical simulations it becomes more and more obvious that the plain\nSFA misses interesting effects even on a qualitative level. Examples are\nholographic side lobes, the low-energy structure, radial patterns in\nphotoelectron spectra at low kinetic energies, and strongly rotated angular\ndistributions. For this reason increasing effort has been recently devoted to\nCoulomb corrections of the SFA. In the current paper, we follow a similar line\nbut consider ionization of metal clusters. It is known that photoelectrons from\nclusters can be much more energetic than those emitted from atoms or small\nmolecules, especially if the Mie resonance of the expanding cluster is evoked.\nWe develop a SFA that takes the collective field inside the cluster via the\nsimple rigid-sphere model into account. Our approach is based on\nfield-corrected quantum orbits so that the acceleration process (or any other\nspectral feature of interest) can be investigated in detail.\n", "  The achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in ultracold vapors of\nalkali atoms has given enormous impulse to the theoretical and experimental\nstudy of dilute atomic gases in condensed quantum states inside magnetic traps\nand optical lattices. This article offers a short survey on mathematical models\nand theories as well as numerical methods for BEC based on the mean field\ntheory. We start with the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) in three dimensions\n(3D) for modeling one-component BEC of the weakly interacting bosons, scale it\nto obtain a three-parameter model and show how to reduce it to two dimensions\n(2D) and one dimension (1D) GPEs in certain limiting regimes. Mathematical\ntheories and numerical methods for ground states and dynamics of BEC are\nprovided. Extensions to GPE with an angular momentum rotation term for a\nrotating BEC, to GPE with long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction for\na dipolar BEC and to coupled GPEs for spin-orbit coupled BECs are discussed.\nFinally, some conclusions are drawn and future research perspectives are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper a macroscopic quantum oscillator is introduced that consists of\na flux qubit in the form of a cantilever. The magnetic flux linked to the flux\nqubit and the mechanical degrees of freedom of the cantilever are naturally\ncoupled. The coupling is controlled through an external magnetic field. The\nground state of the introduced flux-qubit-cantilever corresponds to a quantum\nentanglement between magnetic flux and the cantilever displacement.\n", "  The gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are cast as an infinite-dimensional\nHamiltonian system. The gyrokinetic Poisson bracket is remarkably simple and\nsimilar to the Morrison-Marsden-Weinstein bracket for the Vlasov-Maxwell\nequations. By identifying many of the bracket's Casimirs, this work enables (i)\nthe derivation of gyrokinetic equilibrium variational principles and (ii) the\napplication of the energy-Casimir method and the method of\ndynamically-accessible variations to study stability properties of gyrokinetic\nequilibria.\n", "  Micro-organisms usually can swim in their liquid environment by flagellar or\nciliary beating. In this numerical work, we analyze the influence of flagellar\nbeating on the orbits of a swimming cell in a shear flow. We also calculate the\neffect of the flagellar beating on the rheology of a dilute suspension of\nmicro-swimmers. A three-dimensional model is proposed for Chlamydomonas\nReinhardtii swimming with a breaststroke-like beating of two anterior flagella\nmodeled by two counter-rotating fore beads. The active swimmer model reveals\nunusual angular orbits in a linear shear flow. Namely, the swimmer sustains\norientations transiently across the flow. Such behavior is a result of the\ninterplay between shear flow and swimmer's periodic beating motion of flagella\nwhich exert internal torques on the cell body. This peculiar behavior has some\nsignificant consequences on the rheological properties of the suspension. We\ncalculate the Einstein's viscosity of the suspension composed of such isolated\nmodeled microswimmers (dilute case) in a shear flow. We use numerical\nsimulations based on a Rotne-Prager like approximation for hydrodynamic\ninteraction between simplified flagella and the cell body. The results show an\nincreased intrinsic viscosity for active swimmer suspensions in comparison to\nnon-active ones as well as a shear thinning behavior in accordance with\nprevious experimental measurements [Phys. Rev. Lett. 104 , 098102 (2010)].\n", "  We present a formulation of collisional gyrokinetic theory with exact\nconservation laws for energy and canonical toroidal momentum. Collisions are\naccounted for by a nonlinear gyrokinetic Landau operator. Gyroaveraging and\nlinearization do not destroy the operator's conservation properties. Just as in\nordinary kinetic theory, the conservation laws for collisional gyrokinetic\ntheory are selected by the limiting collisionless gyrokinetic theory.\n", "  We illustrate from the viewpoint of braiding operations on WZNW conformal\nblocks how colored HOMFLY polynomials with multiplicity structure can detect\nmutations. As an example, we explicitly evaluate the (2,1)-colored HOMFLY\npolynomials that distinguish a famous mutant pair, Kinoshita-Terasaka and\nConway knot.\n", "  In this paper, we propose efficient and accurate numerical methods for\ncomputing the ground state and dynamics of the dipolar Bose-Einstein\ncondensates utilising a newly developed dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) solver\nthat is implemented with the non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)\nalgorithm. We begin with the three-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n(GPE) with a DDI term and present the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) model\nunder a strongly anisotropic confining potential. Different from existing\nmethods, the NUFFT based DDI solver removes the singularity by adopting the\nspherical/polar coordinates in Fourier space in 3D/2D, respectively, thus it\ncan achieve spectral accuracy in space and simultaneously maintain high\nefficiency by making full use of FFT and NUFFT whenever it is necessary and/or\nneeded. Then, we incorporate this solver into existing successful methods for\ncomputing the ground state and dynamics of GPE with a DDI for dipolar BEC.\nExtensive numerical comparisons with existing methods are carried out for\ncomputing the DDI, ground states and dynamics of the dipolar BEC. Numerical\nresults show that our new methods outperform existing methods in terms of both\naccuracy and efficiency.\n", "  Here, we review the progress in our understanding of the structure, and\nelectronic spectra of InAs, GaAs, InSb and CdSe clusters. First principles\napproaches based on Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory have become\ncentral to such studies and a brief overview of them is given.\n", "  A two-dimensional crystal on the surface of a sphere experiences elastic\nstress due to the incompatibility of the crystal axes and the curvature. A\ncommon mechanism to relax elastic stress is the Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld (ATG)\ninstability. With a combined numerical and analytical approach we demonstrate,\nthat also curvature induced stress in surface crystals can be relaxed by the\nlong wave length ATG instability. The numerical results are obtained using a\nsurface phase-field crystal (PFC) model, from which we determine the\ncharacteristic wave numbers of the ATG instability for various surface\ncoverages corresponding to different curvature induced compressions. The\nresults are compared with an analytic expression for the characteristic wave\nnumber, obtained from a continuum approach which accounts for hexagonal\ncrystals and intrinsic PFC symmetries. We find our numerical results in\naccordance with the analytical predictions.\n", "  We calculate the tree and penguin amplitudes in the $B^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay\nchannel employing the perturbative QCD factorization approach. Using the\namplitudes as input with the theoretical uncertainties sufficiently considered,\nwe constrain the UT angle $\\gamma$ to $53^\\circ\\leq\\gamma\\leq70^\\circ$, from\nthe measurements of the CP violation parameters $C_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}$ and\n$S_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}$ in $B^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$. The U-spin breaking effect between\n$B^0\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $B_s^0\\to K^+K^-$ is estimated to be around 30\\%.\n", "  Joint electron-ion energy spectra for the dissociative ionization of a model\nH$_2^+$ in few-cycle, infrared laser pulses are calculated via the numerical ab\ninitio solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. A strong,\npulse-dependent modulation of the ionization probability for certain values of\nthe protons' kinetic energy (but almost independent of the electron's energy)\nis observed. With the help of models with frozen ions, this feature---which\nmistakenly might be attributed to vibrational excitations---is traced back to\nthe transient population of electronically excited states, followed by\nionization. This assertion is further corroborated employing a two-level model\nincorporating strong-field ionization from the excited state.\n", "  The charge asymmetry in the production of top quark and antiquark pairs is\nmeasured in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The\ndata, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns,\nwere collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Events with a single isolated\nelectron or muon, and four or more jets, at least one of which is likely to\nhave originated from hadronization of a bottom quark, are selected. A template\ntechnique is used to measure the asymmetry in the distribution of differences\nin the top quark and antiquark absolute rapidities. The measured asymmetry is\nA[c,y] = [0.33 +/- 0.26 (stat) +/- 0.33 (syst)]%, which is the most precise\nresult to date. The results are compared to calculations based on the standard\nmodel and on several beyond-the-standard-model scenarios.\n", "  The nonlinear O(3) sigma-model in (2+1) dimensions with an additional\npotential term admits solutions called Q-lumps, having both topological and\nNoether charges. We consider in 3+1-dimensional spacetime the theory with\nQ-lumps on a domain wall in the presence of spin-orbit interaction in the bulk\nand find interaction effects for a two-particle solution through perturbation\ntheory and adiabatic approximation.\n", "  We propose an alternative theory of gravity which assumes that background\ngeometry of the Universe is fixed four dimensional Euclidean space and gravity\nis a vector field $A_k$ in this space which breaks the Euclidean symmetry.\nDirection of $A_k$ gives the time coordinate, while perpendicular directions\nare spatial coordinates. Vector gravitational field is coupled to matter\nuniversally and minimally through the equivalent metric $f_{ik}$ which is a\nfunctional of $A_k$. We show that such assumptions yield a unique theory of\ngravity, it is free of black holes and, to the best of our knowledge, passes\nall available tests. For cosmology our theory predicts the same evolution of\nthe Universe as general relativity with cosmological constant and zero spatial\ncurvature. However, the present theory provides explanation of the dark energy\nas energy of longitudinal gravitational field induced by the Universe expansion\nand yields, with no free parameters, the value of $\\Omega _{\\Lambda\n}=2/3\\approx 0.67$ which agrees with the recent Planck result $\\Omega _{\\Lambda\n}=0.686\\pm 0.02$. Such striking agreement indicates that gravity has a vector,\nrather than tensor, origin. We demonstrate that gravitational wave signals\nmeasured by LIGO are compatible with vector gravity. They are produced by\norbital inspiral of massive neutron stars which can exist in the present\ntheory. We also quantize gravitational field and show that quantum vector\ngravity is equivalent to QED. Vector gravity can be tested by making more\naccurate measurement of the time delay of radar signal traveling near the Sun;\nby improving accuracy of the light deflection experiments; or by measuring\npropagation direction of gravitational waves relative to laser interferometer\narms. Resolving the supermassive object at the center of our Galaxy with VLBA\ncould provide another test of gravity and also shed light on the nature of dark\nmatter.\n", "  We study inflation in the $\\alpha-$attractor model under a non-slow-roll\ndynamics with an ansatz proposed by Gong \\& Sasaki \\cite{Gong:2015ypa} of\nassuming $N=N\\left(\\phi\\right)$. Under this approach, we construct a class of\nlocal shapes of inflaton potential that are different from the T-models. We\nfind this type of inflationary scenario predicts an attractor at\n$n_{s}\\sim0.967$ and $r\\sim0.00055$. In our approach, the non-slow-roll\ninflaton dynamics are related to the $\\alpha-$parameter which is the curvature\nof K\\\"ahler geometry in the SUGRA embedding of this model.\n", "  We briefly review some recent advances in the study of the shadows of\nrotating black holes in alternative theories. The size and the shape of the\nshadow depend on the mass and the angular momentum, and they can also depend on\nother parameters specific of the particular model adopted. As an example, we\nshow the results corresponding to a rotating braneworld black hole.\n", "  We study the generalization of the Kerr-Newmann black hole in 5D\nEinstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with free Chern-Simons coupling parameter.\nThese black holes possess equal magnitude angular momenta and an event horizon\nof spherical topology. We focus on the extremal case with zero temperature. We\nfind that, when the Chern-Simons coupling is greater than two times the\nsupergravity case, new branches of black holes are found which violate\nuniqueness. In particular, a sequence of these black holes are non-static\nradially excited solutions with vanishing angular momentum. They approach the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution as the excitation level increases.\n", "  Recently introduced time-dependent renormalized-natural orbital theory\n(TDRNOT) is extended towards a multi-component approach in order to describe\nH$_2^+$ beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Two kinds of natural\norbitals, describing the electronic and the nuclear degrees of freedom are\nintroduced, and the exact equations of motion for them are derived. The theory\nis benchmarked by comparing numerically exact results of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for a H$_2^+$ model system with the corresponding TDRNOT\npredictions. Ground state properties, linear response spectra, fragmentation,\nand high-order harmonic generation are investigated.\n", "  The original proposal to achieve superconductivity by starting from a quantum\nspin-liquid (QSL) and doping it with charge carriers, as proposed by Anderson\nin 1987, has yet to be realized. Here we propose an alternative strategy: use a\nQSL as a substrate for heterostructure growth of metallic films to design\nexotic superconductors. By spatially separating the two key ingredients of\nsuperconductivity, i.e., charge carriers (metal) and pairing interaction (QSL),\nthe proposed setup naturally lands on the parameter regime conducive to a\ncontrolled theoretical prediction. Moreover, the proposed setup allows us to\n\"customize\" electron-electron interaction imprinted on the metallic layer. The\nQSL material of our choice is quantum spin ice well-known for its emergent\ngauge-field description of spin frustration. Assuming the metallic layer forms\nan isotropic single Fermi pocket, we predict that the coupling between the\nemergent gauge-field and the electrons of the metallic layer will drive\ntopological odd-parity pairing. We further present guiding principles for\nmaterializing the suitable heterostructure using ab initio calculations and\ndescribe the band structure we predict for the case of\nY$_2$Sn$_{2-x}$Sb$_x$O$_7$ grown on the (111) surface of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$.\nUsing this microscopic information, we predict topological odd-parity\nsuperconductivity at a few Kelvin in this heterostructure, which is comparable\nto the $T_c$ of the only other confirmed odd-parity superconductor\nSr$_2$RuO$_4$.\n", "  Using extensive direct numerical simulations, the dynamics of\nlaminar-turbulent fronts in pipe flow is investigated for Reynolds numbers\nbetween $Re=2000$ and $5500$. We here investigate the physical distinction\nbetween the fronts of weak and strong slugs both by analysing the turbulent\nkinetic energy budget and by comparing the downstream front motion to the\nadvection speed of bulk turbulent structures. Our study shows that weak\ndownstream fronts travel slower than turbulent structures in the bulk and\ncorrespond to decaying turbulence at the front. At $Re\\simeq 2900$ the\ndownstream front speed becomes faster than the advection speed, marking the\nonset of strong fronts. In contrast to weak fronts, turbulent eddies are\ngenerated at strong fronts by feeding on the downstream laminar flow. Our study\nalso suggests that temporal fluctuations of production and dissipation at the\ndownstream laminar-turbulent front drive the dynamical switches between the two\ntypes of front observed up to $Re\\simeq 3200$.\n", "  In this work we study a brane world model with variable tension which gives\nrise to four dimensional cosmologies. The brane worlds obtained correspond to\nE\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s branes whose (internal) geometry can be casted as either a four\ndimensional (A)dS$_{4}$ or a standard radiation period cosmology. The matter\ndominated period is discussed as well.\n", "  Calculating strong-field, momentum-resolved photoelectron spectra (PES) from\nnumerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) is a\nvery demanding task due to the large spatial excursions and drifts of electrons\nin intense laser fields. The time-dependent surface flux (t-SURFF) method for\nthe calculation of PES [L. Tao, A. Scrinzi, New Journal of Physics 14, 013021\n(2012)] allows to keep the numerical grid much smaller than the space over\nwhich the wavefunction would be spread at the end of the laser pulse. We\npresent an implementation of the t-SURFF method in the well established\nTDSE-solver Qprop [D. Bauer, P. Koval, Comput. Phys. Commun. 174, 396 (2006)].\nQprop efficiently propagates wavefunctions for single-active electron systems\nwith spherically symmetric binding potentials in classical, linearly (along\n$z$) or elliptically (in the $xy$-plane) polarized laser fields in dipole\napproximation. Its combination with t-SURFF makes the simulation of PES\nfeasible in cases where it is just too expensive to keep the entire\nwavefunction on the numerical grid, e.g., in the long-wavelength or long-pulse\nregime.\n", "  The saddle point approximation to the partition functions is an important way\nof deriving the thermodynamical properties of black holes. However, there are\ncertain black hole models and some mathematically analog mechanical models for\nwhich this method can not be applied directly. This is due to the fact that\ntheir action evaluated on a classical solution is not finite and its first\nvariation does not vanish for all consistent boundary conditions. These\nproblems can be dealt with by adding a counter-term to the classical action,\nwhich is a solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work\nhowever, we seek an alternative solution to this problem via the polymer\nquantization which is motivated by the loop quantum gravity.\n", "  This work describes the behaviour of water molecules in\n1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid under\nnanoconfinement between graphene sheets. By means of molecular dynamics\nsimulations, an adsorption of water molecules at the graphene surface is\nstudied. A depletion of water molecules in the vicinity of the neutral and\nnegatively charged graphene surfaces and their adsorption at the positively\ncharged surface are observed in line with the preferential hydration of the\nionic liquid anions. The findings are appropriately described using a two-level\nstatistical model. The confinement effect on the structure and dynamics of the\nmixtures is thoroughly analyzed using the density and the potential of mean\nforce profiles, as well as by the vibrational densities of states of water\nmolecules near the graphene surface. The orientation of water molecules and the\nwater-induced structural transitions in the layer closest to the graphene\nsurface are also discussed.\n", "  The \"friendship paradox\" (Feld1991) refers to the fact that, on average,\npeople have strictly fewer friends than their friends have. I show that this\nover-sampling of the most popular people amplifies behaviors that involve\ncomplementarities. People with more friends experience greater interactive\neffects and hence engage more in socially influenced activities. Given the\nfriendship paradox, people then perceive more engagement when sampling their\nfriends than exists in the overall population. Given the complementarities,\nthis feeds back to amplify average engagement. In addition, people with the\ngreatest innate benefits from a behavior also tend to be the ones who choose to\ninteract the most, leading to further feedback and amplification. These results\nare consistent with studies finding that people consistently overestimate peer\nconsumption of alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs; and, can help explain problems\nwith adolescent abuse of drugs and binge-drinking, as well as other behaviors.\nI also discuss how these results change in cases of strategic substitutes,\nwhere individuals overestimate free-riding by peers.\n", "  In this note we overview recent convergence results for correlations in the\ncritical planar nearest-neighbor Ising model. We start with a short discussion\nof the combinatorics of the model and a definition of fermionic and spinor\nobservables. After that, we illustrate our approach to spin correlations by a\nderivation of two classical explicit formulae in the infinite-volume limit.\nThen we describe the convergence results (as the mesh size tends to zero, in\narbitrary planar domains) for fermionic correlators, energy-density and spin\nexpectations. Finally, we discuss scaling limits of mixed correlators involving\nspins, disorders and fermions, and the classical fusion rules for them.\n", "  In a bipartite set-up, the vacuum state of a free Bosonic scalar field is\nentangled in real space and satisfies the area-law--- entanglement entropy\nscales linearly with area of the boundary between the two partitions. In this\nwork, we show that the area law is violated in two spatial dimensional model\nHamiltonian having dynamical critical exponent z=3. The model physically\ncorresponds to next-to-next-to-next nearest neighbour coupling terms on a\nlattice. The result reported here is the first of its kind of violation of area\nlaw in Bosonic systems in higher dimensions and signals the evidence of a\nquantum phase transition. We provide evidence for quantum phase transition both\nnumerically and analytically using quantum Information tools like entanglement\nspectra, quantum fidelity, and gap in the energy spectra. We identify the cause\nfor this transition due to the accumulation of large number of angular zero\nmodes around the critical point which catalyses the change in the ground state\nwave function due to the next-to-next-to-next nearest neighbor coupling.\nLastly, using Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation, we show that the effective\nBosonic Hamiltonian can be obtained from an interacting fermionic theory and\nprovide possible implications for condensed matter systems.\n", "  We consider the supergravity back-reaction of M2 branes wrapping around the\nspace-time cycles in 1/8-BPS microstate geometries. We show that such brane\nwrappings will generically break all the supersymmetries. In particular, all\nthe supersymmetries will be broken if there are such wrapped branes but the net\ncharge of the wrapped branes is zero. We show that if M2 branes wrap a single\ncycle, or if they wrap a several of co-linear cycles with the same orientation,\nthen the solution will be 1/16-BPS, having two supersymmetries. We comment on\nhow these results relate to using W-branes to understand the microstate\nstructure of 1/8-BPS black holes.\n", "  Most flows in nature and engineering are turbulent because of their large\nvelocities and spatial scales. Laboratory experiments of rotating\nquasi-Keplerian flows, for which the angular velocity decreases radially but\nthe angular momentum increases, are however laminar at Reynolds numbers\nexceeding one million. This is in apparent contradiction to direct numerical\nsimulations showing that in these experiments turbulence transition is\ntriggered by the axial boundaries. We here show numerically that as the\nReynolds number increases turbulence becomes progressively confined to the\nboundary layers and the flow in the bulk fully relaminarizes. Our findings\nsupport that turbulence is unlikely to occur in isothermal constant density\nquasi-Keplerian flows.\n", "  In this work we investigate the semi-classical backreaction for a quantised\nconformal scalar field and classical vacuum energy. In contrast to the usual\napproximation of a closed system, our analysis includes an environmental sector\nsuch that a quantum-to-classical transition can take place. We show that when\nthe system decoheres into a mixed state with particle number as the classical\nobservable de Sitter space is destabilized, which is observable as a gradually\ndecreasing Hubble rate. In particular we show that at late times this mechanism\ncan drive the curvature of the Universe to zero and has an interpretation as\nthe decay of the vacuum energy demonstrating that quantum effects can be\nrelevant for the fate of the Universe.\n", "  Hyperspectral unmixing is a blind source separation problem which consists in\nestimating the reference spectral signatures contained in a hyperspectral\nimage, as well as their relative contribution to each pixel according to a\ngiven mixture model. In practice, the process is further complexified by the\ninherent spectral variability of the observed scene and the possible presence\nof outliers. More specifically, multi-temporal hyperspectral images, i.e.,\nsequences of hyperspectral images acquired over the same area at different time\ninstants, are likely to simultaneously exhibit moderate endmember variability\nand abrupt spectral changes either due to outliers or to significant time\nintervals between consecutive acquisitions. Unless properly accounted for,\nthese two perturbations can significantly affect the unmixing process. In this\ncontext, we propose a new unmixing model for multitemporal hyperspectral images\naccounting for smooth temporal variations, construed as spectral variability,\nand abrupt spectral changes interpreted as outliers. The proposed hierarchical\nBayesian model is inferred using a Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method\nallowing the posterior of interest to be sampled and Bayesian estimators to be\napproximated. A comparison with unmixing techniques from the literature on\nsynthetic and real data allows the interest of the proposed approach to be\nappreciated.\n", "  The charged-particle multiplicity distribution and the transverse-energy\ndistribution measured in heavy-ion collisions at top RHIC and LHC energies are\ndescribed using the two-component model approach based on a convolution of the\nMonte Carlo Glauber model with the Weibull model for particle production. The\nmodel successfully describes the multiplicity and transverse-energy\ndistribution of minimum-bias collision data for a wide range of energies. The\nWeibull-Glauber model can be used to determine the centrality classes in\nheavy-ion collisions as an alternative to the conventional negative binomial\ndistribution (NBD)-Glauber approach.\n", "  4-dimensional spaces equipped with 2-dimensional (complex holomorphic or real\nsmooth) completely integrable distributions are considered. The integral\nmanifolds of such distributions are totally null and totally geodesics\n2-dimensional surfaces which are called the null strings. Properties of\ncongruences (foliations) of such 2-surfaces are studied. Some relations between\nproperties of congruences of null strings, Petrov-Penrose type of SD Weyl\nspinor and algebraic types of the traceless Ricci tensor are analyzed.\n", "  A new formulation of the plasma resistivity that arises from the collisional\nmomentum-transfer rate between electrons and ions is presented. The resistivity\ncomputed herein is shown to depend not only on the temperature and density but\nalso on all other polynomial velocity-space moments of the distribution\nfunction, such as the pressure tensor and heat flux vector. The exact\nexpression for the collisional momentum-transfer rate is determined, and is\nused to formulate the nonlinear anisotropic resistivity. The new formalism\nrecovers the Spitzer resistivity, as well as the concept of thermal force if\nthe heat flux is assumed to be proportional to a temperature gradient.\nFurthermore, if the pressure tensor is related to viscous stress, the latter\nenters the expression for the resistivity. The relative importance of the\nnonlinear term(s) with respect to the well-established electron inertia and\nHall terms is also examined. The subtle implications of the nonlinear\nresistivity, and its dependence on the fluid variables, are discussed in the\ncontext of magnetized plasma environments and phenomena such as magnetic\nreconnection.\n", "  The adiabatic theorem is a fundamental result established in the early days\nof quantum mechanics, which states that a system can be kept arbitrarily close\nto the instantaneous ground state of its Hamiltonian if the latter varies in\ntime slowly enough. The theorem has an impressive record of applications\nranging from foundations of quantum field theory to computational recipes in\nmolecular dynamics. In light of this success it is remarkable that a\npracticable quantitative understanding of what \"slowly enough\" means is limited\nto a modest set of systems mostly having a small Hilbert space. Here we show\nhow this gap can be bridged for a broad natural class of physical systems,\nnamely many-body systems where a small move in the parameter space induces an\northogonality catastrophe. In this class, the conditions for adiabaticity are\nderived from the scaling properties of the parameter dependent ground state\nwithout a reference to the excitation spectrum. This finding constitutes a\nmajor simplification of a complex problem, which otherwise requires solving\nnon-autonomous time evolution in a large Hilbert space. We illustrate our\ngeneral results by analyzing conditions for the transport quantization in a\ntopological Thouless pump.\n", "  We consider a three slabs configuration including two non-doped single layer\ngraphene on insulating silicon dioxide (G/SiO2) substrates and one non-doped\nsuspended single layer graphene (SG). The suspended layer is placed between two\nG/SiO2 layers. Without SG layer, the heat flux has maximum at Plasmon frequency\nsupported by the G/SiO2 slabs. In three slabs configuration, the photon heat\ntunneling is amplified between two G/SiO2 layers significantly, only for\nspecific range of vacuum gap between SG layer and G/SiO2 layers and Plasmon\nfrequency, due to the coupling of modes between each G/SiO2 layer and SG layer.\nSince, the SG layer is a single atomic layer, the photon heat tunneling\nassisted by this configuration does not depend on the thickness of middle layer\nand in consequence, it can enable novel applications for nanoscale thermal\nmanagement.\n", "  In this paper, a framework of {w_1, w_2, R} classification for constructing\nthe graphene nanomesh (GNM) of zigzag-edged hexagonal nanohole is\nsystematically built. The three integer indexes w_1, w_2, and R indicate the\ndistances between two neighboring sides of nanoholes in two directions and the\nnanohole size respectively, which leading to a straightforward gap opening\ncriteria, i.e., w_1+w_2-R=3n+1,n is integer, steered via DFT band structure\ncalculations.The guiding rule indicates that the semimetallic and\nsemiconducting variation is consistent with a peculiar sequence \"010\" and \"100\"\n(\"0\"/\"1\" represent gap closure/opening) with a period of 3 for odd and even w_1\nrespectively. The periodic nanoperforation induced gap sizes agreewith a linear\nfitting with a smaller sqrt(N_rem )/N_tot ratio, while deviates from that when\n(w_1+w_2)<R+1. Particularly, the {p, 1, p} and {1, q, q} structures demonstrate\neach unique scaling rule pertaining to the nanohole size only when n is set to\nzero. Furthermore, the coexistence of Dirac and flat bands is observed for {1,\nq, q} and {1, 1, m} structures, which is sensitive to the atomic patters\n", "  We determine the nucleon neutral weak electromagnetic form factors\n$G^{Z,p(n)}_{E,M}$ by combining results from light-front holographic QCD and\nlattice QCD calculations. We deduce nucleon electromagnetic form factors from\nlight-front holographic QCD which provides a good parametrization of the\nexperimental data of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors in the entire\nmomentum transfer range and isolate the strange quark electromagnetic form\nfactors $G^{s}_{E,M}$ using lattice QCD. From these calculations, we obtain\nprecise estimates of the neutral weak form factors in the momentum transfer\nrange of $0\\,\\text{GeV}^2\\leq Q^2 \\leq 0.5 \\,\\text{GeV}^2 $. From the lattice\nQCD calculation, we present $Q^2$-dependence of the strange quark form factors.\nWe also deduce the neutral weak Dirac and Pauli form factors $F_{1,2}^{Z,p(n)}$\nof the proton and the neutron.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered to be one of the most\npowerful sources of turbulence in hydrodynamically stable quasi-Keplerian\nflows, such as those governing accretion disk flows. Although the linear\nstability of these flows with applied external magnetic field has been studied\nfor decades, the influence of the instability on the outward angular momentum\ntransport, necessary for the accretion of the disk, is still not well known. In\nthis work we model Keplerian rotation with Taylor-Couette flow and imposed\nazimuthal magnetic field using both linear and nonlinear approaches. We present\nscalings of instability with Hartmann and Reynolds numbers via linear analysis\nand direct numerical simulations (DNS) for the two magnetic Prandtl numbers of\n$1.4 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ and $1$. Inside of the instability domains modes with\ndifferent axial wavenumbers dominate, resulting in sub-domains of\ninstabilities, which appear different for each $Pm$. The DNS show the emergence\nof 1- and 2-frequency spatio-temporally oscillating structures for $Pm=1$ close\nthe onset of instability, as well as significant enhancement of angular\nmomentum transport for $Pm=1$ as compared to $Pm=1.4 \\cdot 10^{-6}$.\n", "  The efficient mixing of fluids is key in many applications, such as chemical\nreactions and nanoparticle precipitation. Detailed experimental measurements of\nthe mixing dynamics are however difficult to obtain, and so predictive\nnumerical tools are helpful in designing and optimizing many processes. If two\ndifferent fluids are considered, the viscosity and density of the mixture\ndepend often nonlinearly on the composition, which makes the modeling of the\nmixing process particularly challenging. Hence water-water mixtures in simple\ngeometries such as T-mixers have been intensively investigated, but little is\nknown about the dynamics of more complex mixtures, especially in the turbulent\nregime. We here present a numerical method allowing the accurate simulation of\ntwo-fluid mixtures. Using a high-performance implementation of this method we\nperform direct numerical simulations resolving the spatial and temporal\ndynamics of water-ethanol flows for Reynolds numbers from 100 to 2000. The\nflows states encountered during turbulence transition and their mixing\nproperties are discussed in detail and compared to water-water mixtures.\n", "  We study perfect valley polarization in a molybdenum disulfide MoS2\nnanoribbon monolayer using two bands Hamiltonian model and non-equilibrium\nGreen's function method. The device consists of a one-dimensional quantum wire\nof MoS2 monolayer sandwiched between two zigzag MoS2 nanoribbons such that the\nsites A and B of the honeycomb lattice are constructed by the molecular orbital\nof Mo atoms, only. Spin-valley coupling is seen in energy dispersion curve due\nto the inversion asymmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Although, the time\nreversal symmetry is broken by applying an external magnetic field, the valley\npolarization is very small. A valley polarization equal to 46% can be achieved\nusing an exchange field of 0.13 eV. It is shown that a particular spin-valley\ncombination with perfect valley polarization can be selected based on a given\nset of exchange field and gate voltage as input parameters. Therefore, the\nvalley polarization can be detected by detecting the spin degree of freedom.\n", "  We are inspired by mechanical gearboxes and demonstrate its analog\ncounterpart in optics. We use nonlinear dispersion modes as \"gears\" to overcome\nthe mismatch between the ultrahigh speed of optical data and the much slower\nsampling rate of electronic digitizers and processors. We delineate the\nmathematical foundations and show its utility in ultrafast optical measurements\nand digital image compression.\n", "  There are investigated the Lie algebraic structure and integrability\nproperties of a very interesting class of nonlinear dynamical systems called\nthe heavenly equations, which were initiated by Pleba\\'nski and later analyzed\nin a series of articles. Based on the AKS-algebraic and related R-structure\nschemes there are studied orbits of the corresponding co-adjoint actions,\ndeeply related with the classical Lie-Poisson type structures on them. There is\nsuccessively demonstrated that their compatibility condition proves to coincide\nexactly with the corresponding heavenly equation under regard. It is stated\nthat all the heavenly equations allow such an origin and can be equivalently\nrepresented as a Lax type compatibility condition for specially built loop\nvector fields on the torus. The infinite hierarchy of conservations laws,\nrelated with the heavenly equations is discussed, its analytical structure,\nconnected with the Casimir invariants is mentioned. In addition, the typical\nexamples of the heavenly equations, demonstrating in details their\nintegrability within the scheme devised in the work, are presented. The\nLagrangian representation of the heavenly equations following from their\nHamiltonicity with respect to both related commuting to each other evolution\nflows, as well as their associated bi-Hamiltonian structure are also discussed.\nThe relationship of the heavenly type dynamical ssytems with the classical\nLagrange-d'Alambert principle is demonstrated.\n", "  Gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibre (PCF) is being used to generate\never wider supercontinuum spectra, in particular via dispersive wave (DW)\nemission in the deep and vacuum ultraviolet, with a multitude of applications.\nDWs are the result of the resonant transfer of energy from a self-compressed\nsoliton, a process which relies crucially on phase matching. It was recently\npredicted that, in the strong-field regime, the additional transient anomalous\ndispersion introduced by gas ionization would allow phase-matched DW generation\nin the mid-infrared (MIR)-something that is forbidden in the absence of free\nelectrons. Here we report for the first time the experimental observation of\nsuch MIR DWs, embedded in a 4.7-octave-wide supercontinuum that uniquely\nreaches simultaneously to the vacuum ultraviolet, with up to 1.7 W of total\naverage power.\n", "  Directed information transmission is paramount for many social, physical, and\nbiological systems. For neural systems, scientists have studied this problem\nunder the paradigm of feedforward networks for decades. In most models of\nfeedforward networks, activity is exclusively driven by excitatory neurons and\nthe wiring patterns between them, while inhibitory neurons play only a\nstabilizing role for the network dynamics. Motivated by recent experimental\ndiscoveries of hippocampal circuitry, cortical circuitry, and the diversity of\ninhibitory neurons throughout the brain, here we illustrate that one can\nconstruct such networks even if the connectivity between the excitatory units\nin the system remains random. This is achieved by endowing inhibitory nodes\nwith a more active role in the network. Our findings demonstrate that apparent\nfeedforward activity can be caused by a much broader network-architectural\nbasis than often assumed.\n", "  Energy bandgap largely determines the optical and electronic properties of a\nsemiconductor. Variable bandgap therefore makes versatile functionality\npossible in a single material. In layered material black phosphorus, the\nbandgap can be modulated by the number of layers; as a result, few-layer black\nphosphorus has discrete bandgap values that are relevant for opto-electronic\napplications in the spectral range from red, in monolayer, to mid-infrared in\nthe bulk limit. Here, we further demonstrate continuous bandgap modulation by\nmechanical strain applied through flexible substrates. The strain-modulated\nbandgap significantly alters the charge transport in black phosphorus at room\ntemperature; we for the first time observe a large piezo-resistive effect in\nblack phosphorus field-effect transistors (FETs). The effect opens up\nopportunities for future development of electro-mechanical transducers based on\nblack phosphorus, and we demonstrate strain gauges constructed from black\nphosphorus thin crystals.\n", "  The class of accelerated and rotating reference frames has been studied on\nthe basis of generalized Fermi-Walker coordinates. We obtain the infinitesimal\ntransformations connecting any two of these frames and also their commutation\nrelations. We thus have an infinite dimensional extension of the Poincar\\'e\nalgebra and, although it turns out to be Abelian extension, and hence trivial,\nit is noteworthy that, contrarily to Lorentz boosts, acceleration and\nrotational boost generators commute with each other and with the generators of\nPoincar\\'e group as well.\n", "  Forward Drell-Yan production at high energy can provide important constraints\non gluon densities at small $x$, in the saturation regime. In this work we\nfocus on the nuclear modification of this process, which could be measured at\nthe LHC in the near future. For this we employ the color dipole approach, using\nthe optical Glauber model to relate the dipole cross section of a nucleus to\nthe one of a proton. Combining these results with our earlier results for\nforward $J/\\psi$ production, we compute the ratio of the nuclear modification\nfactors of these two processes. This observable was recently suggested as a way\nto distinguish between initial and final state effects in forward particle\nproduction.\n", "  We come up with infinite-dimensional prequantum line bundles and moment map\ninterpretations of three different sets of equations - the generalised\nMonge-Amp`ere equation, the almost Hitchin system, and the Calabi-Yang-Mills\nequations. These are all perturbations of already existing equations. Our\nconstruction for the generalised Monge-Amp`ere equation is conditioned on a\nconjecture from algebraic geometry. In addition, we prove that for small values\nof the perturbation parameters, some of these equations have solutions.\n", "  By using the ultra-spinning limit as a generating solution technique, we\nconstruct a novel class of charged rotating asymptotic AdS black holes. That\ndescribes the exact D-dimnsioanl solutions of Einstein-Maxwell dilaton theory\nin the presence of negative cosmological constant. The obtained geometries\npossess some punctures, describing a noncompact horizon, but has a finite area.\nWe then explicitly investigate the validity of the Kerr/CFT correspondence for\nall dimensional cases. We find a main result for the central charges associated\nto $[(d-1)/2]$ copies of dual $2D$ CFTs. We then argue the existence of a\nprecise agreement between the microscopic entropy of dual CFTs and the entropy\nof the noncompact horizon.\n", "  Determining the solvation free energies of single ions in water is one of the\nmost fundamental problems in physical chemistry and yet many unresolved\nquestions remain. In particular, the ability to decompose the solvation free\nenergy into simple and intuitive contributions will have important implications\nfor models of electrolyte solution. Here, we provide definitions of the various\ntypes of single ion solvation free energies based on different simulation\nprotocols. We calculate solvation free energies of charged hard spheres using\ndensity functional theory interaction potentials with molecular dynamics\nsimulation (DFT-MD) and isolate the effects of charge and cavitation, comparing\nto the Born (linear response) model. We show that using uncorrected Ewald\nsummation leads to unphysical values for the single ion solvation free energy\nand that charging free energies for cations are approximately linear as a\nfunction of charge but that there is a small non-linearity for small anions.\nThe charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) for hard spheres, determined with quantum\nmechanics, is much larger than for the analogous real ions. This suggests that\nreal ions, particularly anions, are significantly more complex than simple\ncharged hard spheres, a commonly employed representation.\n", "  Quantum metrology allows us to attain a measurement precision that surpasses\nthe classically achievable limit by using quantum characters. The metrology\nprecision is raised from the standard quantum limit (SQL) to the Heisenberg\nlimit (HL) by using entanglement. However, it was reported that the HL returns\nto the SQL in the presence of local dephasing environments under the long\nencoding-time condition. We evaluate here the exact impacts of local\ndissipative environments on quantum metrology, based on the Ramsey\ninterferometer. It is found that the HL is asymptotically recovered under the\nlong encoding-time condition for a finite number of the probe atoms. Our\nanalysis reveals that this is essentially due to the formation of a bound state\nbetween each atom and its environment. This provides an avenue for\nexperimentation to implement quantum metrology under practical conditions via\nengineering of the formation of the system-environment bound state.\n", "  We report a direct-numerical-simulation study of Taylor-Couette flow in the\nquasi-Keplerian regime at shear Reynolds numbers up to $\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$.\nQuasi-Keplerian rotating flow has been investigated for decades as a simplified\nmodel system to study the origin of turbulence in accretion disks that is not\nfully understood. The flow in this study is axially periodic and thus the\nexperimental end-wall effects on the stability of the flow are avoided. Using\noptimal linear perturbations as initial conditions, our simulations find no\nsustained turbulence: the strong initial perturbations distort the velocity\nprofile and trigger turbulence that eventually decays.\n", "  Single ion solvation free energies are one of the most important properties\nof electrolyte solutions and yet there is ongoing debate about what these\nvalues are. Only the values for neutral ion pairs are known. Here, we use DFT\ninteraction potentials with molecular dynamics simulation (DFT-MD) combined\nwith a modified version of the quasi-chemical theory (QCT) to calculate these\nenergies for the lithium and fluoride ions. A method to correct for the error\nin the DFT functional is developed and very good agreement with the\nexperimental value for the lithium fluoride pair is obtained. Moreover, this\nmethod partitions the energies into physically intuitive terms such as surface\npotential, cavity and charging energies which are amenable to descriptions with\nreduced models. Our research suggests that lithium's solvation free energy is\ndominated by the free energetics of a charged hard sphere, whereas fluoride\nexhibits significant quantum mechanical behavior that cannot be simply\ndescribed with a reduced model.\n", "  The $N$-particle wavefunction has too many dimensions for a direct time\npropagation of a many-body system according to the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (TDSE). On the other hand, time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) tells us that the single-particle density is, in principle, sufficient.\nHowever, a practicable equation of motion (EOM) for the accurate time evolution\nof the single-particle density is unknown. It is thus an obvious idea to\npropagate a quantity which is not as reduced as the single-particle density but\nless dimensional than the $N$-body wavefunction. Recently, we have introduced\ntime-dependent renormalized-natural-orbital theory (TDRNOT). TDRNOT is based on\nthe propagation of the eigenfunctions of the one-body reduced density matrix\n(1-RDM), the so-called natural orbitals. In this paper we demonstrate how\nTDRNOT is related to the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock\n(MCTDHF) approach. We also compare the performance of MCTDHF and TDRNOT vs the\nTDSE for single-photon double ionization (SPDI) of a 1D helium model atom. SPDI\nis one of the effects where TDDFT does not work in practice, especially if one\nis interested in correlated photoelectron spectra, for which no explicit\ndensity functional is known.\n", "  A search for dark matter is performed using events with large missing\ntransverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom\nquarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the\nLHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Results\nare interpreted in the context of a Z'-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge\nsymmetry of the standard model is extended to a U(1)[Z'] group, with a new\nmassive Z' gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional\nHiggs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z' decays into a\npseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like Higgs boson, and the A decays to a\npair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the\nbackground prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields\nexclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m[Z']-m[A] phase space. For\nexample, the observed data exclude the Z' mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for\nZ' coupling strength g[Z'] = 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles\ng[chi] = 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan[beta] = 1, and m[A]\n= 300 GeV. The results of this analysis are valid for any dark matter particle\nmass below 100 GeV.\n", "  We applied the theory of regularly varying functions to the analysis of the\ncosmological parameters for the $\\Lambda$CDM model with the matter dominated\nevolution. Carroll et al. proved in 1992 that for this type of universe with\nthe curvature $k=0, -1$, the expression $H(t)t$\\, ($H(t)$ is the Hubble\nparameter) depends solely on the density parameter $\\Omega(t)$. Using this\nresult and the theory of regular variation we infer for such universe the\ncomplete asymptotics of all main cosmological parameters. More specifically,\nthe following is derived. If the limit $\\omega= \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\Omega(t)$\ndoes exist and $\\omega \\not= 0$ then the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ is\nequal to $0$. If $\\omega=0$ then for the expansion scale factor $a(t)$ we have\n$a(t)\\sim e^{\\sqrt{\\Lambda/3}}$. On the other hand, if the limit\n$\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\Omega(t)$ does not exist then $a(t)$ bounces between two\npower functions and therefore has infinitely many flexion points. Hence, the\ndeceleration parameter in this case changes the sign infinitely many times.\n", "  Recently, the author proposed an alternative vector theory of gravity. To the\nbest of our knowledge, vector gravity also passes available tests of gravity,\nand, in addition, predicts the correct value of the cosmological constant\nwithout free parameters. It is important to find a new feasible test which can\ndistinguish between vector gravity and general relativity and determine whether\ngravity has a vector or a tensor origin. Here we propose such an experiment\nbased on measurement of propagation direction of gravitational waves relative\nto the perpendicular arms of a laser interferometer. We show that transverse\ngravitational wave in vector gravity produces no signal when it propagates in\nthe direction perpendicular to the interferometer plane or along one of the\narms. In contrast, general relativistic wave yields no signal when it\npropagates parallel to the interferometer plane at $45^{\\circ }$ angle relative\nto an interferometer arm. The test can be performed in the nearest years in a\njoint run of the two LIGO and one Virgo interferometers.\n", "  We studied the acceptance dependence of proton cumulants (up to fourth order)\nand correlation functions in 0--5\\% most central Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}}$=7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV from UrQMD\nmodel. We found that high order proton cumulants show suppressions at large\nacceptance. By decomposing the proton cumulants into linear combination of\nmulti-proton correlation functions, we observed the two-proton correlation\nfunctions always show negative values due to the effects of baryon number\nconservations. The three and four-proton correlation functions are close to\nzero and show negligible acceptance dependence. We further observed that the\nproton cumulants and correlation functions follow similar trends and show a\nscaling behavior when plotting the results versus mean number of protons. The\ncomparisons between experimental data and the UrQMD calculations show that the\nnon-monotonic energy dependence of proton correlation functions measured by\nSTAR experiment cannot be described by the UrQMD model. The UrQMD calculations\ncan provide us baselines for the experimental studies of the proton cumulants\nand correlation functions. Finally, we propose to measure the rapidity\ndependence of the reduced proton correlation functions to search for the QCD\ncritical point in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The Fe1+xTe phase diagram consists of two distinct magnetic structures with\ncollinear order present at low interstitial iron concentrations and a helical\nphase at large values of x with these phases separated by a Lifshitz point. We\nuse unpolarized single crystal diffraction to confirm the helical phase for\nlarge interstitial iron concentrations and polarized single crystal diffraction\nto demonstrate the collinear order for the iron deficient side of the Fe1+xTe\nphase diagram. Polarized neutron inelastic scattering show that the\nfluctuations associated with this collinear order are predominately transverse\nat low energy transfers, consistent with a localized magnetic moment picture.\nWe then apply neutron inelastic scattering and polarization analysis to\ninvestigate the dynamics and structure near the boundary between collinear and\nhelical order in the Fe1+xTe phase diagram. We first show that the phase\nseparating collinear and helical order is characterized by a spin-density wave\nwith a single propagation wave vector of (~ 0.45, 0, 0.5). We do not observe\nharmonics or the presence of a charge density wave. The magnetic fluctuations\nassociated with this wavevector are different from the collinear phase being\nstrongly longitudinal in nature and correlated anisotropically in the (H,K)\nplane. The excitations preserve the C4 symmetry of the lattice, but display\ndifferent widths in momentum along the two tetragonal directions at low energy\ntransfers. While the low energy excitations and minimal magnetic phase diagram\ncan be understood in terms of localized interactions, we suggest that the\npresence of density wave phase implies the importance of electronic and orbital\nproperties.\n", "  Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to\ndirectly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet,\nthe ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is\ncrucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of\nthe full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use\nautomatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also\nenables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum\nsupremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a\n45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5\npetabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum\ncircuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with\nthe reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution\nover state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every\nscale.\n", "  We develop an alternative thermodynamic cycle for the Stirling machine, where\nthe polytropic process plays a central role. Analytical expressions for\npressure and temperatures of the working gas are obtained as a function of the\nvolume and the parameter which characterizes the polytropic process. This\napproach achieves a closer agreement with the experimental pressure-volume\ndiagram and can be adapted to any type of the Stirling engine.\n", "  We present the first exact calculations of the time dependence of causal\ncorrelations in driven nonequilibrium states in (2+1)-dimensional systems using\nholography. Comparing exact results with those obtained from simple prototype\ngeometries that are parametrized only by a time dependent temperature, we find\nthat the universal slowly varying features are controlled just by the pump\nduration and the initial and final temperatures only. We provide numerical\nevidence that the locations of the event and apparent horizons in the dual\ngeometries can be deduced from the nonequilibrium causal correlations without\nany prior knowledge of the dual gravity theory.\n", "  We generalize the recently proposed resource theory of coherence (or\nsuperposition) [Baumgratz, Cramer & Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113:140401; Winter\n& Yang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116:120404] to the setting where not only the free\n(\"incoherent\") resources, but also the objects manipulated are quantum\noperations, rather than states. In particular, we discuss an information\ntheoretic notion of coherence capacity of a quantum channel, and prove a\nsingle-letter formula for it in the case of unitaries. Then we move to the\ncoherence cost of simulating a channel, and prove achievability results for\nunitaries and general channels acting on a $d$-dimensional system; we show that\na maximally coherent state of rank $d$ is always sufficient as a resource if\nincoherent operations are allowed. We also show lower bounds on the simulation\ncost of channels that allow us to conclude that there exists bound coherence in\noperations, i.e. maps with non-zero cost of implementing them but zero\ncoherence capacity; this is in contrast to states, which do not exhibit bound\ncoherence.\n", "  Light reflection on a mirror can be thought as a simple physical effect.\nHowever if this happens when the mirror moves a rich scenario opens up. Here we\naim at analyzing it from a quantum communication perspective. In particular, we\nstudy the kind of quantum channel that arises from (Gaussian) light reflection\nupon an accelerating mirror. Two competing mechanisms emerge in such a context,\nnamely photons production by the mirror's motion and {\\blu interference between\nmodes}. As consequence we find out a quantum amplifier channel and quantum\nlossy channel respectively below and above a threshold frequency (that depends\non parameters determining mirror's acceleration). Exactly at the threshold\nfrequency the channel behaves like a purely classical additive channel, while\nit becomes purely erasure for large frequencies. In addition the time behavior\nof the channel is analyzed by employing wave packets expansion of the light\nfield.\n", "  Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is one of the most important methods in\nmachine learning, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is often used\nto obtain maximum likelihood estimates. However, EM heavily depends on initial\nconfigurations and fails to find the global optimum. On the other hand, in the\nfield of physics, quantum annealing (QA) was proposed as a novel optimization\napproach. Motivated by QA, we propose a quantum annealing extension of EM,\nwhich we call the deterministic quantum annealing expectation-maximization\n(DQAEM) algorithm. We also discuss its advantage in terms of the path integral\nformulation. Furthermore, by employing numerical simulations, we illustrate how\nit works in MLE and show that DQAEM outperforms EM.\n", "  We look for new steps on the dynamical operations that may squeeze\nsimultaneously some families of quantum states, independently of their initial\nshape, induced by softly acting external fields which might produce the\nsqueezing of the canonical observables $q,p$ of charged particles. Also, we\npresent some exactly solvable cases of the problem which appear in the\nsymmetric evolution intervals permitting to find explicitly the time dependence\nof the external fields needed to generate the required evolution operators.\nCuriously, our results are interrelated with a simple, non--trivial,\nanti--commuting algebra of Toeplitz which describes the problem more easily\nthan the frequently used Ermakov--Milne invariants.\n", "  We relate the breakdown of equations of states for the mechanical pressure of\ngeneric dry active systems to the lack of momentum conservation in such\nsystems. We show how sources and sinks of momentum arise generically close to\nconfining walls. These typically depend on the interactions of the container\nwith the particles, which makes the mechanical pressure a container-dependent\nquantity. We show that an equation of state is recovered if the dynamics of the\norientation of active particles are decoupled from other degrees of freedom and\nlead to an apolar bulk steady-state. This is related to the fact that the mean\nsteady-state active force density is the divergence of the flux of \"active\nimpulse\", an observable which measures the mean momentum particles will receive\nfrom the substrate in the future.\n", "  The recent measurement of $R_{K^*}$ is yet another hint of new physics (NP),\nand supports the idea that it is present in $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays. We\nperform a combined model-independent and model-dependent analysis in order to\ndeduce properties of this NP. Like others, we find that the NP must obey one of\ntwo scenarios: (I) $C_9^{\\mu\\mu}({\\rm NP}) < 0$ or (II) $C_9^{\\mu\\mu}({\\rm NP})\n= - C_{10}^{\\mu\\mu}({\\rm NP}) < 0$. A third scenario, (III) $C_9^{\\mu\\mu}({\\rm\nNP}) = - C_{9}^{\\prime \\mu\\mu}({\\rm NP})$, is rejected largely because it\npredicts $R_K = 1$, in disagreement with experiment. The simplest NP models\ninvolve the tree-level exchange of a leptoquark (LQ) or a $Z'$ boson. We show\nthat scenario (II) can arise in LQ or $Z'$ models, but scenario (I) is only\npossible with a $Z'$. Fits to $Z'$ models must take into account the additional\nconstraints from $B^0_s$-${\\bar B}^0_s$ mixing and neutrino trident production.\nAlthough the LQs must be heavy, O(TeV), we find that the $Z'$ can be light,\ne.g., $M_{Z'} = 10$ GeV or 200 MeV.\n", "  One of the major difficulties in employing phase field crystal (PFC) modeling\nand the associated amplitude (APFC) formulation is the ability to tune model\nparameters to match experimental quantities. In this work we address the\nproblem of tuning the defect core and interface energies in the APFC\nformulation. We show that the addition of a single term to the free energy\nfunctional can be used to increase the solid-liquid interface and defect\nenergies in a well-controlled fashion, without any major change to other\nfeatures. The influence of the newly added term is explored in two-dimensional\ntriangular and honeycomb structures as well as bcc and fcc lattices in three\ndimensions. In addition, a finite element method (FEM) is developed for the\nmodel that incorporates a mesh refinement scheme. The combination of the FEM\nand mesh refinement to simulate amplitude expansion with a new energy term\nprovides a method of controlling microscopic features such as defect and\ninterface energies while simultaneously delivering a coarse-grained examination\nof the system.\n", "  There has been renewed interest in the use of magnetic nanoparticles to\nconvert high frequency electromagnetic energy into heat. During the last\ndecade, numerous examples in the field of catalysis, lightweight thermoplastic\ncomposites for aeronautical and automotive engineering, and biomedical\napplications as well, have flourished. In a recent Letter \"Ultrathin Interface\nRegime of Core-Shell Magnetic Nanoparticles for Effective Magnetism Tailoring\",\nMoon et al. DOI: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b04016 claim to have observed a new\ninterface spin canting phenomenon in core-shell ferrrites that pushes heating\nefficiencies above 10,000 W/g. If this were true, it represents new\nopportunities for further tailoring nanoscale agents to be used in drug\ndelivery and selective destruction of tumours by hyperthermia. But here I argue\nthat these claims are inconsistent with the facts of physics.\n", "  We present a new way of continuously reading-out the state of a single\nelectronic spin. Our detection scheme is based on an exchange interaction\nbetween the electronic spin and a nearby read-out quantum dot. The coupling\nbetween the two systems results in a spin-dependent conductance through the\nread-out dot and establishes an all electrical and non-destructive single spin\ndetection. With conductance variations up to 4% and read-out fidelities greater\nthan 99.5%, this method represents an alternative to systems where spin to\ncharge conversion cannot be implemented. Using a semi-classical approach, we\npresent an asymetric exchange coupling model in good agreement with our\nexperimental results.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is thought to be a powerful source of\nturbulence in Keplerian accretion disks. Motivated by recent laboratory\nexperiments, we study the MRI driven by an azimuthal magnetic field in an\nelectrically conducting fluid sheared between two concentric rotating\ncylinders. By adjusting the rotation rates of the cylinders, we approximate\nangular velocity profiles $\\omega \\propto r^{q}$. We perform direct numerical\nsimulations of a steep profile close to the Rayleigh line $q \\gtrsim -2 $ and a\nquasi-Keplerian profile $q \\approx -3/2$ and cover wide ranges of Reynolds\n($Re\\le 4\\cdot10^4$) and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($0\\le Pm \\le 1$). In the\nquasi-Keplerian case, the onset of instability depends on the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber, with $Rm_c \\approx 50$, and angular momentum transport scales as\n$\\sqrt{Pm} Re^2$ in the turbulent regime. The ratio of Maxwell to Reynolds\nstresses is set by $Rm$. At the onset of instability both stresses have similar\nmagnitude, whereas the Reynolds stress vanishes or becomes even negative as\n$Rm$ increases. For the profile close to the Rayleigh line, the instability\nshares these properties as long as $Pm\\gtrsim0.1$, but exhibits a markedly\ndifferent character if $Pm\\rightarrow 0$, where the onset of instability is\ngoverned by the Reynolds number, with $Re_c \\approx 1250$, transport is via\nReynolds stresses and scales as $Re^2$. At intermediate $Pm=0.01$ we observe a\ncontinuous transition from one regime to the other, with a crossover at\n$Rm=\\mathcal{O}(100)$. Our results give a comprehensive picture of angular\nmomentum transport of the MRI with an imposed azimuthal field.\n", "  We demonstrate that a deep neural network can significantly improve optical\nmicroscopy, enhancing its spatial resolution over a large field-of-view and\ndepth-of-field. After its training, the only input to this network is an image\nacquired using a regular optical microscope, without any changes to its design.\nWe blindly tested this deep learning approach using various tissue samples that\nare imaged with low-resolution and wide-field systems, where the network\nrapidly outputs an image with remarkably better resolution, matching the\nperformance of higher numerical aperture lenses, also significantly surpassing\ntheir limited field-of-view and depth-of-field. These results are\ntransformative for various fields that use microscopy tools, including e.g.,\nlife sciences, where optical microscopy is considered as one of the most widely\nused and deployed techniques. Beyond such applications, our presented approach\nis broadly applicable to other imaging modalities, also spanning different\nparts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be used to design computational\nimagers that get better and better as they continue to image specimen and\nestablish new transformations among different modes of imaging.\n", "  Sound waves on a fluid stream, in a de Laval nozzle, are shown to correspond\nto quasinormal modes emitted by black holes that are physical solutions in a\nquadratic curvature gravity with cosmological constant. Sound waves patterns in\ntranssonic regimes at a laboratory are employed here to provide experimental\ndata regarding generalized theories of gravity, comprised by the exact de\nSitter-like solution and a perturbative solution around the Schwarzschild-de\nSitter standard solution. Using the classical tests of General Relativity to\nbound free parameters in these solutions, acoustic perturbations on fluid flows\nin nozzles are then regarded to study quasinormal modes of these black holes\nsolutions, providing deviations of the de Laval nozzle cross-sectional area,\nwhen compared to the Schwarzschild solution. The fluid sonic point in the\nnozzle, for sound waves in the fluid, implements the acoustic event horizon\ncorresponding to quasinormal modes.\n", "  We investigate effects of pairing and of quadrupole deformation on two sorts\nof nuclear excitations,$\\gamma$-vibrational $K^{\\pi}=2^+$ states and dipole\nresonances (isovector dipole, pygmy, compression, toroidal). The analysis is\nperformed within the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) based on\nthe Skyrme energy functional using the Skyrme parametrization SLy6. Particular\nattention is paid to i) the role of the particle-particle (pp) channel in the\nresidual interaction of QRPA, ii) comparison of volume pairing (VP) and surface\npairing (SP), iii) peculiarities of deformation splitting in the various\nresonances. We find that the impact of the pp-channel on the considered\nexcitations is negligible. This conclusion applies also to any other excitation\nexcept for the $K^{\\pi}=0^+$ states. Furthermore, the difference between VP and\nSP is found small (with exception of peak height in the toroidal mode). In the\nlow-energy isovector dipole (pygmy) and isoscalar toroidal modes, the branch\n$K^{\\pi}=1^-$ is shown to dominate over $K^{\\pi}=0^-$ one in the range of\nexcitation energy $E <$ 8--10 MeV. The effect becomes impressive for the\ntoroidal resonance whose low-energy part is concentrated in a high peak of\nalmost pure $K^{\\pi}=1^-$ nature. This peculiarity may be used as a fingerprint\nof the toroidal mode in future experiments. The interplay between pygmy,\ntoroidal and compression resonances is discussed, the interpretation of the\nobserved isoscalar giant dipole resonance is partly revised.\n", "  Edge/surface states often appear in a topologically nontrivial phase, when\nthe system has a boundary. The edge state of a one-dimensional topological\ninsulator is one of the simplest examples. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) is an\nideal probe to detect and analyze the edge state for its high sensitivity and\nprecision. We consider ESR of the edge state of a generalized\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping and a\nstaggered spin-orbit coupling. The spin-orbit coupling is generally expected to\nbring about nontrivial changes on the ESR spectrum. Nevertheless, in the\nabsence of the NNN hoppings, we find that the ESR spectrum is unaffected by the\nspin-orbit coupling thanks to the chiral symmetry. In the presence of both the\nNNN hopping and the spin-orbit coupling, on the other hand, the edge ESR\nspectrum exhibits a nontrivial frequency shift. We derive an explicit\nanalytical formula for the ESR shift in the second order perturbation theory,\nwhich agrees very well with a non-perturbative numerical calculation.\n", "  Using a turn-key Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser frequency comb, an\noff-the-shelf supercontinuum device, and Fabry-Perot mode filters, we report\nthe generation of a 16 GHz frequency comb spanning a 90 nm band about a center\nwavelength of 566 nm. The light from this astro-comb is used to calibrate the\nHARPS-N astrophysical spectrograph for precision radial velocity measurements.\nThe comb-calibrated spectrograph achieves a stability of $\\sim$ 1 cm/s within\nhalf an hour of averaging time. We also use the astro-comb as a reference for\nmeasurements of solar spectra obtained with a compact telescope, and as a tool\nto study intrapixel sensitivity variations on the CCD of the spectrograph.\n", "  Although ultraviolet (UV) light is important in many areas of science and\ntechnology, there are very few if any lasers capable of delivering\nwavelength-tunable ultrashort UV pulses at MHz repetition rates. Here we report\nthe generation of deep-UV laser pulses at MHz repetition rates and \\mu\nJ-energies by means of dispersive wave (DW) emission from self-compressed\nsolitons in gas-filled single-ring hollow-core photonic crystal fiber (SR-PCF).\nPulses from an ytterbium fiber laser (~300 fs) are first compressed to ~25 fs\nin a SR-PCF-based nonlinear compression stage, and subsequently used to pump a\nsecond SR-PCF stage for broadband DW generation in the deep UV. The UV\nwavelength is tunable by selecting the gas species and the pressure. At 100 kHz\nrepetition rate, a pulse energy of 1.05 \\mu J was obtained at 205 nm (average\npower 0.1 W), and at 1.92 MHz, a pulse energy of 0.54 \\mu J was obtained at 275\nnm (average power 1.03 W).\n", "  We study some analytic properties of the BFKL ladder at next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy (NLLA). We use a procedure by Chirilli and Kovchegov to\nconstruct the NLO eigenfunctions, and we show that the BFKL ladder can be\nevaluated order by order in the coupling in terms of certain generalised\nsingle-valued multiple polylogarithms recently introduced by Schnetz. We\ndevelop techniques to evaluate the BFKL ladder at any loop order, and we\npresent explicit results up to five loops. Using the freedom in defining the\nmatter content of the NLO BFKL eigenvalue, we obtain conditions for the BFKL\nladder in momentum space at NLLA to have maximal transcendental weight. We\nobserve that, unlike in moment space, the result in momentum space in N = 4 SYM\nis not identical to the maximal weight part of QCD, and moreover that there is\nno gauge theory with this property. We classify the theories for which the BFKL\nladder at NLLA has maximal weight in terms of their field content, and we find\nthat these theories are highly constrained: there are precisely four classes of\ntheories with this property involving only fundamental and adjoint matter, all\nof which have a vanishing one-loop beta function and a matter content that fits\ninto supersymmetric multiplets. Our findings indicate that theories which have\nmaximal weight are highly constrained and point to the possibility that there\nis a connection between maximal transcendental weight and superconformal\nsymmetry.\n", "  In diamond, the mechanical vibration induced strain can lead to interaction\nbetween the mechanical mode and the nitrogen-vecancy (NV) centers. In this\nwork, we propose to utilize the strain induced coupling for the quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) single phonon measurement and memory in diamond. The\nsingle phonon in a diamond mechanical resonator can be perfectly absorbed and\nemitted by the NV centers ensemble (NVE) with adiabatically tuning the\nmicrowave driving. An optical laser drives the NVE to the excited states, which\nhave much larger coupling strength to the mechanical mode. By adiabatically\neliminating the excited states under large detuning limit, the effective\ncoupling between the mechanical mode and the NVE can be used for QND\nmeasurement of the single phonon state. Under realistic experimental\nconditions, we numerically simulate the scheme. It is found that the fidelity\nof the absorbing and emitting process can reach a much high value. The overlap\nbetween the input and the output phonon shapes can reach $98.57\\%$.\n", "  The dynamic process of a laser or particle beam propagating from vacuum into\nunderdense plasma has been investigated theoretically. Our theoretical model\ncombines a Lagrangian fluid model with the classic quasistatic wakefield\ntheory. It is found that background electrons can be injected into wakefields\nbecause sharp vacuum-plasma transitions can reduce the injection threshold. The\ninjection condition, injection threshold as well as the injection length can be\ngiven theoretically by our model and are compared with results from computer\nsimulations. Moreover, electron beams of high qualities can be produced near\nthe injection thresholds and the proposed scheme is promising in reducing the\ninjection threshold and improving the beam qualities of plasma based\naccelerators.\n", "  The study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in\ntwo-dimensional $|\\varphi|^4$ models can be performed in several\nrepresentations, and the amplitude-phase (AP) Madelung parametrization is a\nnatural way to study the contribution of density fluctuations to nonuniversal\nquantities. We introduce a functional renormalization group scheme in AP\nrepresentation where amplitude fluctuations are integrated first to yield an\neffective sine-Gordon model with renormalized superfluid stiffness. By a\nmapping between the lattice XY and continuum $|\\varphi|^4$ models, our method\napplies to both on equal footing. Our approach correctly reproduces the\nexistence of a line of fixed points and of universal thermodynamics and it\nallows to estimate universal and nonuniversal quantities of the two models,\nfinding good agreement with available Monte Carlo results. The presented\napproach is flexible enough to treat parameter ranges of experimental\nrelevance.\n", "  We evaluate one-loop amplitudes of N = 4 supergravity in D dimensions using\nthe double-copy procedure that expresses gravity integrands in terms of\ncorresponding ones in Yang--Mills theory.We organize the calculation in terms\nof a set of gauge-invariant tensors, allowing us to identify evanescent\ncontributions. Among the latter, we find the matrix elements of supersymmetric\ncompletions of curvature-squared operators. In addition, we find that such\nevanescent terms and the U(1)-anomalous contributions to one-loop N = 4\namplitudes are tightly intertwined. The appearance of evanescent operators in N\n= 4 supergravity and their relation to anomalies raises the question of their\neffect on the known four-loop divergence in this theory. We provide bases of\ngauge-invariant tensors and corresponding projectors useful for Yang--Mills\ntheories as a by-product of our analysis.\n", "  Momentum-resolved photoelectron emission from xenon in colinearly polarized\ntwo-color laser fields at above-threshold ionization conditions is studied both\nexperimentally and theoretically. We utilize phase-of-the-phase spectroscopy as\nrecently introduced by Skruszewicz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 043001 (2015)\nto analyze the dependence of the yields on the relative phase $\\varphi$ between\nthe fundamental and second harmonic laser fields. The resulting phase-of-phase\nspectra feature a characteristic checkerboard pattern, which can analytically\nbe described within the strong-field approximation.\n", "  Conventional dark matter direct detection experiments set stringent\nconstraints on dark matter by looking for elastic scattering events between\ndark matter particles and nuclei in underground detectors. However these\nconstraints weaken significantly in the sub-GeV mass region, simply because\nlight dark matter does not have enough energy to trigger detectors regardless\nof the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section. Even if future experiments\nlower their energy thresholds, they will still be blind to parameter space\nwhere dark matter particles interact with nuclei strongly enough that they lose\nenough energy and become unable to cause a signal above the experimental\nthreshold by the time they reach the underground detector. Therefore in case\ndark matter is in the sub-GeV region and strongly interacting, possible\nunderground scatterings of dark matter with terrestrial nuclei must be taken\ninto account because they affect significantly the recoil spectra and event\nrates, regardless of whether the experiment probes DM via DM-nucleus or\nDM-electron interaction. To quantify this effect we present the publicly\navailable Dark Matter Simulation Code for Underground Scatterings (DaMaSCUS), a\nMonte Carlo simulator of DM trajectories through the Earth taking underground\nscatterings into account. Our simulation allows the precise calculation of the\ndensity and velocity distribution of dark matter at any detector of given depth\nand location on Earth. The simulation can also provide the accurate recoil\nspectrum in underground detectors as well as the phase and amplitude of the\ndiurnal modulation caused by this shadowing effect of the Earth, ultimately\nrelating the modulations expected in different detectors, which is important to\ndecisively conclude if a diurnal modulation is due to dark matter or an\nirrelevant background.\n", "  We study the Regge-like spectra of light mesons in a relativized quark model.\nAn analytical mass formula is presented for the light unflavored mesons with\nthe help of auxiliary field method, by which a quasi-linear\nRegge-Chew-Frautschi plot is predicted for the orbitally excited states. We\nshow that the trajectory slope is proportional to the inverse confining\nparameter $1/a$ up to a factor depending on the strong coupling $\\alpha_{s}$\nwhen the orbital quantum number $L$ is large. The result is tested against the\nexperimental data of the spectra of the meson families\n$\\pi/b$,$\\rho/a$,$\\eta/h$ and $\\omega/f$ in the ($L$,$M^{2}$) planes, with the\nfitted parameters consistent with that in the literatures.\n", "  We determine within lattice QCD, the nucleon spin carried by valence and sea\nquarks, and gluons. The calculation is performed using an ensemble of gauge\nconfigurations with two degenerate light quarks with mass fixed to\napproximately reproduce the physical pion mass. We find that the total angular\nmomentum carried by the quarks in the nucleon is $J_{u+d+s}{=}0.408(61)_{\\rm\nstat.}(48)_{\\rm syst.}$ and the gluon contribution is $J_g {=}0.133(11)_{\\rm\nstat.}(14)_{\\rm syst.}$ giving a total of $J_N{=}0.54(6)_{\\rm stat.}(5)_{\\rm\nsyst.}$ consistent with the spin sum. For the quark intrinsic spin contribution\nwe obtain $\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta \\Sigma_{u+d+s}{=}0.201(17)_{\\rm stat.}(5)_{\\rm\nsyst.}$. All quantities are given in the $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ scheme at\n2~GeV. The quark and gluon momentum fractions are also computed and add up to\n$\\langle x\\rangle_{u+d+s}+\\langle x\\rangle_g{=}0.804(121)_{\\rm stat.}(95)_{\\rm\nsyst.}+0.267(12)_{\\rm stat.}(10)_{\\rm syst.}{=}1.07(12)_{\\rm stat.}(10)_{\\rm\nsyst.}$ satisfying the momentum sum.\n", "  The generalized diffusion equations with fractional order derivatives have\nshown be quite efficient to describe the diffusion in complex systems, with the\nadvantage of producing exact expressions for the underlying diffusive\nproperties. Recently, researchers have proposed different fractional-time\noperators (namely: the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu) which, differently\nfrom the well-known Riemann-Liouville operator, are defined by non-singular\nmemory kernels. Here we proposed to use these new operators to generalize the\nusual diffusion equation. By analyzing the corresponding fractional diffusion\nequations within the continuous time random walk framework, we obtained waiting\ntime distributions characterized by exponential, stretched exponential, and\npower-law functions, as well as a crossover between two behaviors. For the mean\nsquare displacement, we found crossovers between usual and confined diffusion,\nand between usual and sub-diffusion. We obtained the exact expressions for the\nprobability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions\nemerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion\nequation is solved without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion\nboundary conditions. We have further shown that these new fractional diffusion\nequations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic resetting, and to\nfractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order. Thus, our\nresults show that these new operators are a simple and efficient way for\nincorporating different structural aspects into the system, opening new\npossibilities for modeling and investigating anomalous diffusive processes.\n", "  We generalize the twisted quantum double model of topological orders in two\ndimensions to the case with boundaries by systematically constructing the\nboundary Hamiltonians. Given the bulk Hamiltonian defined by a gauge group $G$\nand a three-cocycle in the third cohomology group of $G$ over $U(1)$, a\nboundary Hamiltonian can be defined by a subgroup $K$ of $G$ and a two-cochain\nin the second cochain group of $K$ over $U(1)$. The consistency between the\nbulk and boundary Hamiltonians is dictated by what we call the Frobenius\ncondition that constrains the two-cochain given the three-cocyle. We offer a\nclosed-form formula computing the ground state degeneracy of the model on a\ncylinder in terms of the input data only, which can be naturally generalized to\nsurfaces with more boundaries. We also explicitly write down the ground-state\nwavefunction of the model on a disk also in terms of the input data only.\n", "  We present an algorithmic construction scheme for matrix-product-operator\n(MPO) representations of arbitrary $U(1)$-invariant operators whenever there is\nan expression of the local structure in terms of a finite-states machine (FSM).\nGiven a set of local operators as building blocks, the method automatizes two\nmajor steps when constructing a $U(1)$-invariant MPO representation: (i) the\nbookkeeping of auxiliary bond-index shifts arising from the application of\noperators changing the local quantum numbers and (ii) the appearance of phase\nfactors due to particular commutation rules. The automatization is achieved by\npost-processing the operator strings generated by the FSM. Consequently, MPO\nrepresentations of various types of $U(1)$-invariant operators can be\nconstructed generically in MPS algorithms reducing the necessity of expensive\nMPO arithmetics. This is demonstrated by generating arbitrary products of\noperators in terms of FSM, from which we obtain exact MPO representations for\nthe variance of the Hamiltonian of a $S=1$ Heisenberg chain.\n", "  Shot noise is an important ingredient to any measurement or theoretical\nmodeling of discrete tracers of the large scale structure. Recent work has\nshown that the shot noise in the halo power spectrum becomes increasingly\nsub-Poissonian at high mass. Interestingly, while the halo model predicts a\nshot noise power spectrum in qualitative agreement with the data, it leads to\nan unphysical white noise in the cross halo-matter and matter power spectrum.\nIn this work, we show that absorbing all the halo model sources of shot noise\ninto the halo fluctuation field leads to meaningful predictions for the shot\nnoise contributions to halo clustering statistics and remove the unphysical\nwhite noise from the cross halo-matter statistics. Our prescription\nstraightforwardly maps onto the general bias expansion, so that the\nrenormalized shot noise terms can be expressed as combinations of the halo\nmodel shot noises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Poissonian\ncontributions are related to volume integrals over correlation functions and\ntheir response to long-wavelength density perturbations. This leads to a new\nclass of consistency relations for discrete tracers, which appear to be\nsatisfied by our reformulation of the halo model. We test our theoretical\npredictions against measurements of halo shot noise bispectra extracted from a\nlarge suite of numerical simulations. Our model reproduces qualitatively the\nobserved sub-Poissonian noise, although it underestimates the magnitude of this\neffect.\n", "  We study the dynamical density matrix renormalization group (DDMRG) and\ntime-dependent density matrix renormalization group (td-DMRG) algorithms in the\nab initio context, to compute dynamical correlation functions of correlated\nsystems. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in small\nmodel problems, and propose two simple improved formulations, DDMRG$^{++}$ and\ntd-DMRG$^{++}$, that give increased accuracy at the same bond dimension, at a\nnominal increase in cost. We apply DDMRG$^{++}$ to obtain the oxygen\ncore-excitation energy in the water molecule in a quadruple-zeta quality basis,\nwhich allows us to estimate the remaining correlation error in existing coupled\ncluster results. Further, we use DDMRG$^{++}$ to compute the local density of\nstates and gaps, and td-DMRG$^{++}$ to compute the complex polarization\nfunction, in linear hydrogen chains with up to 50 H atoms, to study metallicity\nand delocalization as a function of bond-length.\n", "  Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the H to ZZ to 4l (l= e, mu)\ndecay channel. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV,\ncollected with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns is used. The signal strength modifier mu,\ndefined as the ratio of the observed Higgs boson rate in the H to ZZ to 4l\ndecay channel to the standard model expectation, is measured to be mu = 1.05\n+0.19/-0.17 at m[H ]= 125.09 GeV, the combined ATLAS and CMS measurement of the\nHiggs boson mass. The signal strength modifiers for the individual Higgs boson\nproduction modes are also measured. The cross section in the fiducial phase\nspace defined by the requirements on lepton kinematics and event topology is\nmeasured to be 2.92 +0.48/-0.44 (stat) +0.28/-0.24 (syst) fb, which is\ncompatible with the standard model prediction of 2.76 +/- 0.14 fb. Differential\ncross sections are reported as a function of the transverse momentum of the\nHiggs boson, the number of associated jets, and the transverse momentum of the\nleading associated jet. The Higgs boson mass is measured to be m[H] = 125.26\n+/- 0.21 GeV and the width is constrained using on-shell production to be\nGamma[H] < 1.10 GeV, at 95% confidence level.\n", "  Spin caloritronics studies the interplay between charge-, heat- and\nspin-currents, which are initiated by temperature gradients in magnetic\nnanostructures. A plethora of new phenomena has been discovered that promises,\ne.g., to make wasted heat in electronic devices useable or to provide new\nread-out mechanisms for information. However, only few materials have been\nstudied so far with Seebeck voltages of only some {\\mu}V, which hampers\napplications. Here, we demonstrate that half-metallic Heusler compounds are hot\ncandidates for enhancing spin-dependent thermoelectric effects. This becomes\nevident when considering the asymmetry of the spin-split density of electronic\nstates around the Fermi level that determines the spin-dependent thermoelectric\ntransport in magnetic tunnel junctions. We identify Co$_2$FeAl and Co$_2$FeSi\nHeusler compounds as ideal due to their energy gaps in the minority density of\nstates, and demonstrate devices with substantially larger Seebeck voltages and\ntunnel magneto-Seebeck effect ratios than the commonly used Co-Fe-B based\njunctions.\n", "  Glass-to-glass and liquid-to-liquid phase transitions are observed in bulk\nand confined water, with or without applied pressure. They result from the\ncompetition of two liquid phases separated by an enthalpy difference depending\non temperature. The classical nucleation equation of these phases is completed\nby this quantity existing at all temperatures, a pressure contribution, and an\nenthalpy excess. This equation leads to two homogeneous nucleation temperatures\nin each liquid phase, the first one being the formation temperature of an\nordered liquid phase below the melting temperature and the second one\ncorresponding to the overheating temperature. Thermodynamic properties, double\nglass transition temperatures, sharp enthalpy and volume changes are predicted\nin agreement with experimental results. The first-order transition line between\nfragile and strong liquids joins two critical points. Glass phase above its\ntransition temperature becomes ordered liquid phase disappearing at a\nfirst-order transition temperature at low pressure and at a temperature larger\nthan the melting temperature at high pressure.\n", "  The charmless three-body decays $B^0_{(s)} \\to K_{\\mathrm{\\scriptscriptstyle\nS}}^0 h^+ h^{\\prime -}$ (where $h^{(\\prime)} = \\pi, K$) are analysed using a\nsample of $pp$ collision data recorded by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of $3\\mbox{fb}^{-1}$.

These theories\nare related through the BCJ double-copy construction, and the $(DF)^2$ gauge\ntheory obeys color-kinematics duality. We work out the worldsheet details of\nthese theories and show that they admit a formulation as integrals on the\nsupport of the scattering equations, or alternatively, as ambitwistor string\ntheories. For gravity, this generalizes the work done by Berkovits and Witten\non conformal gravity to $D$ dimensions. The ambitwistor is also interpreted as\na $D$-dimensional generalization of Witten's twistor string (SYM + conformal\nsupergravity). As part of our ambitwistor investigation, we discover another\n$(DF)^2$ gauge theory containing a photon that couples to Einstein gravity.\nThis theory can provide an alternative KLT description of Einstein gravity\ncompared to the usual Yang-Mills squared.\n", "  Shielding charged particle beams from transverse magnetic fields is a common\nchallenge for particle accelerators and experiments. We demonstrate that a\nmagnetic field cloak is a viable solution. It allows for the use of dipole\nmagnets in the forward regions of experiments at an Electron Ion Collider (EIC)\nand other facilities without interfering with the incoming beams. The dipoles\ncan improve the momentum measurements of charged final state particles at\nangles close to the beam line and therefore increase the physics reach of these\nexperiments. In contrast to other magnetic shielding options (such as active\ncoils), a cloak requires no external powering. We discuss the design\nparameters, fabrication, and limitations of a magnetic field cloak and\ndemonstrate that cylinders made from 45 layers of YBCO high-temperature\nsuperconductor, combined with a ferromagnetic shell made from epoxy and\nstainless steel powder, shield more than 99% of a transverse magnetic field of\nup to 0.45 T (95 % shielding at 0.5 T) at liquid nitrogen temperature. The\nferromagnetic shell reduces field distortions caused by the superconductor\nalone by 90% at 0.45 T.\n", "  We present an input/output analysis of photon-correlation experiments whereby\na quantum mechanically entangled bi-photon state interacts with a material\nsample placed in one arm of a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) apparatus. We show that the\noutput signal contains detailed information about subsequent entanglement with\nthe microscopic quantum states in the sample. In particular, we apply the\nmethod to an ensemble of emitters interacting with a common photon mode within\nthe open-system Dicke Model. Our results indicate considerable dynamical\ninformation concerning spontaneous symmetry breaking can be revealed with such\nan experimental system.\n", "  Dark Matter might be an accidentally stable baryon of a new confining gauge\ninteraction. We extend previous studies exploring the possibility that the DM\nis made of dark quarks heavier than the dark confinement scale. The resulting\nphenomenology contains new unusual elements: a two-stage DM cosmology\n(freeze-out followed by dark condensation), a large DM annihilation cross\nsection through recombination of dark quarks (allowing to fit the positron\nexcess). Light dark glue-balls are relatively long lived and give extra\ncosmological effects; DM itself can remain radioactive.\n", "  We present a blueprint for building a fault-tolerant universal quantum\ncomputer with Rydberg atoms. Our scheme, which is based on the surface code,\nuses individually-addressable optically-trapped atoms as qubits and exploits\nelectromagnetically induced transparency to perform the multi-qubit gates\nrequired for error correction and computation. We discuss the advantages and\nchallenges of using Rydberg atoms to build such a quantum computer, and we\nperform error correction simulations to obtain an error threshold for our\nscheme. Our findings suggest that Rydberg atoms are a promising candidate for\nquantum computation, but gate fidelities need to improve before fault-tolerant\nuniversal quantum computation can be achieved.\n", "  High density implants such as metals often lead to serious artifacts in the\nreconstructed CT images which hampers the accuracy of image based diagnosis and\ntreatment planning. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet frame based CT\nimage reconstruction model to reduce metal artifacts. This model is built on a\njoint spatial and Radon (projection) domain (JSR) image reconstruction\nframework with a built-in weighting and re-weighting mechanism in Radon domain\nto repair degraded projection data. The new weighting strategy used in the\nproposed model not only makes the regularization in Radon domain by wavelet\nframe transform more effective, but also makes the commonly assumed linear\nmodel for CT imaging a more accurate approximation of the nonlinear physical\nproblem. The proposed model, which will be referred to as the re-weighted JSR\nmodel, combines the ideas of the recently proposed wavelet frame based JSR\nmodel \\cite{Dong2013} and the normalized metal artifact reduction model\n\\cite{meyer2010normalized}, and manages to achieve noticeably better CT\nreconstruction quality than both methods. To solve the proposed re-weighted JSR\nmodel, an efficient alternative iteration algorithm is proposed with guaranteed\nconvergence. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real CT image data\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the re-weighted JSR model and its advantage\nover some of the state-of-the-art methods.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to examine the dynamic response\nof amorphous solids to oscillatory shear at finite temperatures. The data were\ncollected from a poorly annealed binary glass, which was deformed periodically\nin the elastic regime during several hundred shear cycles. We found that the\ncharacteristic time required to reach a steady state with a minimum potential\nenergy is longer at higher temperatures and larger strain amplitudes. With\ndecreasing strain amplitude, the asymptotic value of the potential energy\nincreases but it remains lower than in quiescent samples. The transient decay\nof the potential energy correlates well with a gradual decrease in the volume\noccupied by atoms with large nonaffine displacements. By contrast, the maximum\namplitude of shear stress oscillations is attained relatively quickly when a\nlarge part of the system starts to deform reversibly.\n", "  We establish the nonlinear stability of solitary waves (solitons) and\nperiodic traveling wave solutions (cnoidal waves) for a Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)\nequation which includes a fifth order dispersive term. The traveling wave\nsolutions which yield solitons for zero boundary conditions and wave-trains of\ncnoidal waves for nonzero boundary conditions are analyzed using stability\ntheorems, which rely on the positivity properties of the Fourier transforms. We\nshow that all families of solutions considered here are (orbitally) stable.\n", "  Single-mode Josephson junction-based parametric amplifiers are often modeled\nas perfect amplifiers and squeezers. We show that, in practice, the gain,\nquantum efficiency, and output field squeezing of these devices are limited by\nusually neglected higher-order corrections to the idealized model. To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength. This theoretical study\nis complemented by experimental characterization of the output field of a\nflux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier. In addition to a measurement of the\nsqueezing level of the filtered output field, the Husimi Q-function of the\noutput field is imaged by the use of a deconvolution technique and compared to\nnumerical results. This work establishes nonlinear corrections to the standard\ndegenerate parametric amplifier model as an important contribution to Josephson\nparametric amplifier's squeezing and noise performance.\n", "  Non-dipole effects in strong-field photoelectron momentum spectra have been\nrevealed experimentally [C.T.L. Smeenk et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 193002\n(2011); A. Ludwig et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 243001 (2014)]. For certain\nlaser parameters and photoelectron momenta the spectra were found to be shifted\nagainst the laser propagation direction whereas one would naively assume that\nthe radiation pressure due to the $\\vec{v}\\times\\vec{B}$-force pushes electrons\nalways in propagation direction. Only the interplay between Lorentz and Coulomb\nforce may give rise to such counterintuitive dynamics. In this work, we\ncalculate the momentum-dependent shift in and against the propagation direction\nby extending the quantum trajectory-based Coulomb-corrected strong-field\napproximation beyond the dipole approximation. A semi-analytical treatment\nwhere both magnetic and Coulomb force are treated perturbatively but\nsimultaneously reproduces the results from the full numerical solution of the\nequations of motion.\n", "  We present a simple no-go theorem for the existence of a deformation\nquantization of a homogeneous space M induced by a Drinfel'd twist: we argue\nthat equivariant line bundles on M with non-trivial Chern class and symplectic\ntwist star products cannot both exist on the same manifold M. This implies, for\nexample, that there is no symplectic star product on the complex projective\nspaces induced by a twist based on U(gl(n,C))[[h]] or any sub-bialgebra, for\nevery n greater or equal than 2.\n", "  Using data from the $\\nu$-cleus detector, based on the surface of the Earth,\nwe place constraints on dark matter in the form of Strongly Interacting Massive\nParticles (SIMPs) which interact with nucleons via nuclear-scale cross\nsections. For large SIMP-nucleon cross sections the sensitivity of traditional\ndirect dark matter searches using underground experiments is limited by the\nenergy loss experienced by SIMPs, due to scattering with the rock overburden\nand experimental shielding on their way to the detector apparatus. Hence a\nsurface-based experiment is ideal for a SIMP search, despite the much larger\nbackground, resulting from the lack of shielding. We show using data from a\nrecent surface run of a low-threshold cryogenic detector that values of the\nSIMP-nucleon cross section up to approximately $10^{-27}$ cm$^2$ can be\nexcluded for SIMPs with masses above 100 MeV.\n", "  Motivated by the very recent experimental realization of electronic Lieb\nlattices and research interest on topological states of matter, we study the\ntopological phase transitions driven by Anderson disorder on spin-orbit coupled\nLieb lattices in the presence of spin-independent and dependent potentials. By\ncombining the numerical transport and self-consistent Born approximation\nmethods, we found that both time-reversal invariant and broken Lieb lattices\ncan host disorder-induced gapful topological phases, including the quantum spin\nHall insulator (QSHI) and quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI) phases. For\nthe time-reversal invariant case, this disorder can induce a topological phase\ntransition directly from normal insulator (NI) to the QSHI. While for the\ntime-reversal broken case, the disorder can induce either a QAHI-QSHI phase\ntransition or a NI-QAHI-QSHI phase transition. Remarkably, the time-reversal\nbroken QSHI phase can be induced by Anderson disorder on the spin-orbit coupled\nLieb lattices without time-reversal symmetry.\n", "  A measurement of vector boson scattering and constraints on anomalous quartic\ngauge couplings from events with two Z bosons and two jets are presented. The\nanalysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV collected with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. The search is performed in the fully\nleptonic final state ZZ to lll'l', where l, l' = e, mu. The electroweak\nproduction of two Z bosons in association with two jets is measured with an\nobserved (expected) significance of 2.7 (1.6) standard deviations. A fiducial\ncross section for the electroweak production is measured to be sigma[EW](pp ->\nZZjj -> lll'l'jj) = 0.40 -0.16 +0.21 (stat) -0.09 +0.13 (syst) fb, which is\nconsistent with the standard model prediction. Limits on anomalous quartic\ngauge couplings are determined in terms of the effective field theory operators\nT0, T1, T2, T8, and T9. This is the first measurement of vector boson\nscattering in the ZZ channel at the LHC.\n", "  Modern machine learning techniques can be used to construct powerful models\nfor difficult collider physics problems. In many applications, however, these\nmodels are trained on imperfect simulations due to a lack of truth-level\ninformation in the data, which risks the model learning artifacts of the\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce the paradigm of classification without\nlabels (CWoLa) in which a classifier is trained to distinguish statistical\nmixtures of classes, which are common in collider physics. Crucially, neither\nindividual labels nor class proportions are required, yet we prove that the\noptimal classifier in the CWoLa paradigm is also the optimal classifier in the\ntraditional fully-supervised case where all label information is available.\nAfter demonstrating the power of this method in an analytical toy example, we\nconsider a realistic benchmark for collider physics: distinguishing quark-\nversus gluon-initiated jets using mixed quark/gluon training samples. More\ngenerally, CWoLa can be applied to any classification problem where labels or\nclass proportions are unknown or simulations are unreliable, but statistical\nmixtures of the classes are available.\n", "  A decentralized online quantum cash system, called qBitcoin, is given. We\ndesign the system which has great benefits of quantization in the following\nsense. Firstly, quantum teleportation technology is used for coin transaction,\nwhich prevents from the owner of the coin keeping the original coin data even\nafter sending the coin to another. This was a main problem in a classical\ncircuit and a blockchain was introduced to solve this issue. In qBitcoin, the\ndouble-spending problem never happens and its security is guaranteed\ntheoretically by virtue of quantum information theory. Making a block is time\nconsuming and the system of qBitcoin is based on a quantum chain, instead of\nblocks. Therefore a payment can be completed much faster than Bitcoin. Moreover\nwe employ quantum digital signature so that it naturally inherits properties of\npeer-to-peer (P2P) cash system as originally proposed in Bitcoin.\n", "  We search for the rare decay $D^+\\to D^0 e^+\\nu_{e}$, using a data set with\nan integrated luminosity of 2.93 $\\rm fb^{-1}$ collected at $\\sqrt{s}=3.773$\nGeV with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage rings. No signals\nare observed. We set the upper limit on the branching fraction for $D^+\\to D^0\ne^+\\nu_e$ to be $1.0\\times 10^{-4}$ at the 90\\% confidence level.\n", "  We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on spatial dust distribution\ninside H$_\\mathrm{II}$ regions using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic\nsimulations, which include absorption and re-emission of photons by dust. In\norder to investigate grain size effects as well, we introduce two additional\nfluid components describing large and small dust grains in the simulations.\nRelative velocity between dust and gas strongly depends on the drag force. We\ninclude collisional drag force and coulomb drag force. We find that, in a\ncompact H$_\\mathrm{II}$ region, a dust cavity region is formed by radiation\npressure. Resulting dust cavity sizes (~0.2 pc) agree with observational\nestimates reasonably well. Since dust inside an H$_\\mathrm{II}$ region is\nstrongly charged, relative velocity between dust and gas is mainly determined\nby the coulomb drag force. Strength of the coulomb drag force is about 2-order\nof magnitude larger than that of the collisional drag force. In addition, in a\ncloud of mass $10^5$ $M_{\\odot}$, we find that the radiation pressure changes\nthe grain size distribution inside H$_\\mathrm{II}$ regions. Since large (0.1\n$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) dust grains are accelerated more efficiently than small (0.01\n$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) grains, the large to small grain mass ratio becomes smaller\nby an order of magnitude compared with the initial one. Resulting dust size\ndistributions depend on the luminosity of the radiation source. The large and\nsmall grain segregation becomes weaker when we assume stronger radiation\nsource, since dust grain charges become larger under stronger radiation and\nhence coulomb drag force becomes stronger.\n", "  The notion of weak measurement in quantum mechanics has gained a significant\nand wide interest in realizing apparently counterintuitive quantum effects. In\nrecent times, several theoretical and experimental works have been reported for\ndemonstrating the joint weak value of two observables where the coupling\nstrength is restricted to the second order. In this paper, we extend such a\nformulation by providing a complete treatment of joint weak measurement\nscenario for all-order-coupling for the observable satisfying $A^2=\\mathbb{I}$\nand $A^2=A$, which allows us to reveal several hitherto unexplored features. By\nconsidering the probe state to be discrete as well as continuous variable, we\ndemonstrate how the joint weak value can be inferred for any given strength of\nthe coupling. A particularly interesting result we pointed out that even if the\ninitial pointer state is uncorrelated, the single pointer displacement can\nprovide the information about the joint weak value, if at least third order of\nthe coupling is taken into account. As an application of our scheme, we provide\nan all-order-coupling treatment of the well-known Hardy paradox by considering\nthe continuous as well as discrete meter states and show how the negative joint\nweak probabilities emerge in the quantum paradoxes at the weak coupling limit.\n", "  We study the influence of the close-lying massive bodies on the YBCO material\nwhile it is being saturated with air components. It has been found the effect\nthat can be interpreted as attraction/repulsion of the bodies to/from the\nsamples of hydrated YBCO. This force interaction has been confirmed by a\n\"direct\" dynamometric method for the Earth as a maximum massive body to be used\nin our experiments.\n", "  We suggest and experimentally realize a spectral photonic lattice - a signal\ncan hop between discrete frequency channels, driven by nonlinear interaction\nwith stronger pump lasers. By controlling the complex envelope and frequency\nseparations of multiple pumps, it is possible to introduce non- local hopping\nand to break time-reversal symmetry, which opens up new possibilities for\nphotonic quantum simulation. As two examples, we observe a spectral quantum\nwalk and demonstrate the discrete Talbot effect in the spectral domain, where\nwe find novel instances containing asymmetry and periodicities not possible in\nspatial lattices.\n", "  We obtain expressions for the shear and the vorticity tensors of\nperfect-fluid spacetimes, in terms of the divergence of the Weyl tensor. For\nsuch spacetimes, we prove that if the gradient of the energy density is\nparallel to the velocity, then either the expansion rate is zero, or the\nvorticity vanishes. This statement recalls the \"shear-free conjecture\" for a\nperfect barotropic fluid: vanishing shear implies either vanishing expansion\nrate or vanishing vorticity. Finally, we give a new condition for a perfect\nfluid to be a Generalized Robinson-Walker spacetime.\n", "  The classical self-oscillations can collapse merely due to their mutual\ncouplings. We investigate this oscillation collapse in quantum van der Pol\noscillators. For a pair of quantum oscillators, the steady-state mean phonon\nnumber is shown to be lower than in the corresponding classical model with a\nGaussian white noise that mimics quantum noise. We further show within the\nmean-field theory that a number of globally coupled oscillators undergo a\ntransition from the synchronized periodic motion to the collective oscillation\ncollapse. A quantum many-body simulation suggests that the increase in the\nnumber of oscillators leads to a lower steady-state mean phonon number, bounded\nbelow by the mean-field result.\n", "  We investigate the electronic and magnetic structures of the 122\n(AM$_2$B$_2$) hexagonal transition-metal pnictides with A=(Sr, Ca), M=(Cr, Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni) and B=(As, P, Sb). It is found that the family of materials share\ncritical similarities with those of tetragonal structures that include the\nfamous iron-based high temperature superconductors. In both families, the next\nnearest neighbor(NNN) effective antiferromagnetic(AFM) exchange couplings reach\nthe maximum value in the iron-based materials. While the NNN couplings in the\nlatter are known to be responsible for the C-type AFM state and to result in\nthe extended s-wave superconducting state upon doping, they cause the former to\nbe extremely frustrated magnetic systems and can lead to an time reversal\nsymmetry broken $d+id$ superconducting state upon doping. The iron-based\ncompounds with the hexagonal structure, thus if synthesized, can help us to\ndetermine the origin of high temperature superconductivity.\n", "  Family of compounds CBr$_n$Cl$_{4-n}$ has been proven helpful in unraveling\nmicroscopic mechanisms responsible of glassy behavior. Some of the family\nmembers show translational ordered phases with minimal disorder which appears\nto reveal glassy features, thus deserving special attention in the search for\nuniversal glass anomalies. In this work, we studied CBrCl$_3$ dynamics by\nperforming extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Molecules of this compound\nperform reorientational discrete jumps, where the atoms exchange equivalent\npositions among each other revealing a cage-orientational jump motion fully\ncomparable to the cage-rototranslational jump motion in supercooled liquids.\nCorrelation times were calculated from rotational autocorrelation functions\nshowing good agreement with previous reported dielectric results. From mean\nwaiting and persistence times calculated directly from trajectory results, we\nare able to explain which microscopic mechanisms lead to characteristic times\nassociated with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$-relaxation times measured experimentally.\nWe found that two nonequivalent groups of molecules have a longer\ncharacteristic time than the other two nonequivalent groups, both of them\nbelonging to the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic (C2/c) lattice.\n", "  We investigate the influence of gradient-enhanced dislocation hardening on\nthe mechanics of notch-induced failure. The role of geometrically necessary\ndislocations (GNDs) in enhancing cracking is assessed by means of a\nmechanism-based strain gradient plasticity theory. Both stationary and\npropagating cracks from notch-like defects are investigated through the finite\nelement method. A cohesive zone formulation incorporating monotonic and cyclic\ndamage contributions is employed to address both loading conditions.\nComputations are performed for a very wide range of length scale parameters and\nnumerous geometries are addressed, covering the main types of notches. Results\nreveal a strong influence of the plastic strain gradients in all the scenarios\nconsidered. Transitional combinations of notch angle, radius and length scale\nparameter are identified that establish the regimes of GNDs-relevance, laying\nthe foundations for the rational application of gradient plasticity models in\ndamage assessment of notched components.\n", "  The discovery of 1991 VG on 1991 November 6 attracted an unprecedented amount\nof attention as it was the first near-Earth object (NEO) ever found on an\nEarth-like orbit. At that time, it was considered by some as the first\nrepresentative of a new dynamical class of asteroids, while others argued that\nan artificial (terrestrial or extraterrestrial) origin was more likely. Over a\nquarter of a century later, this peculiar NEO has been recently recovered and\nthe new data may help in confirming or ruling out early theories about its\norigin. Here, we use the latest data to perform an independent assessment of\nits current dynamical status and short-term orbital evolution. Extensive N-body\nsimulations show that its orbit is chaotic on time-scales longer than a few\ndecades. We confirm that 1991 VG was briefly captured by Earth's gravity as a\nminimoon during its previous fly-by in 1991-1992; although it has been a\nrecurrent transient co-orbital of the horseshoe type in the past and it will\nreturn as such in the future, it is not a present-day co-orbital companion of\nthe Earth. A realistic NEO orbital model predicts that objects like 1991 VG\nmust exist and, consistently, we have found three other NEOs --2001 GP2, 2008\nUA202 and 2014 WA366-- which are dynamically similar to 1991 VG. All this\nevidence confirms that there is no compelling reason to believe that 1991 VG is\nnot natural.\n", "  Application of CTRW to dipole hopping transport is considered. Correct\nversions of derivation of the CTRW-equations are presented. Existence of\ndifferent forms of memory kernels is demonstrated. Correction of Scher-Lax\nmemory kernel within geometrical memory approach is fulfilled in accordance\nwith leading terms of concentration expansion. Approximate solution for\nautocorrelation function is constructed. Modern state of numerical simulation\nand experimental measurements of autocorrelation function in nuclear\npolarization delocalization is described.\n", "  We propose a slightly revised Miller-Hagberg (MH) algorithm that efficiently\ngenerates a random network from a given expected degree sequence. The revision\nwas to replace the approximated edge probability between a pair of nodes with a\ncombinatorically calculated edge probability that better captures the\nlikelihood of edge presence especially where edges are dense. The computational\ncomplexity of this combinatorial MH algorithm is still in the same order as the\noriginal one. We evaluated the proposed algorithm through several numerical\nexperiments. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was\nparticularly good at accurately representing high-degree nodes in dense,\nheterogeneous networks. This algorithm may be a useful alternative of other\nmore established network randomization methods, given that the data are\nincreasingly becoming larger and denser in today's network science research.\n", "  A smart grid can be considered as a complex network where each node\nrepresents a generation unit or a consumer. Whereas links can be used to\nrepresent transmission lines. One way to study complex systems is by using the\nagent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm. An ABM is a way of representing a complex\nsystem of autonomous agents interacting with each other. Previously, a number\nof studies have been presented in the smart grid domain making use of the ABM\nparadigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have\nfocused on the specification aspect of ABM. An ABM specification is important\nnot only for understanding but also for replication of the model. In this\nstudy, we focus on development as well as specification of ABM for smart grid.\nWe propose an ABM by using a combination of agent-based and complex\nnetwork-based approaches. For ABM specification, we use ODD and DREAM\nspecification approaches. We analyze these two specification approaches\nqualitatively as well as quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDREAM is a most useful approach as compared with ODD for modeling as well as\nfor replication of models for smart grid.\n", "  Micro- and nanoscale objects with anisotropic shape are key components of a\nvariety of biological systems and inert complex materials, and represent\nfundamental building blocks of novel self-assembly strategies. The time scale\nof their thermal motion is set by their translational and rotational diffusion\ncoefficients, whose measurement may become difficult for relatively large\nparticles with small optical contrast. Here we show that Dark Field\nDifferential Dynamic Microscopy is the ideal tool for probing the\nroto-translational Brownian motion of shape anisotropic particles. We\ndemonstrate our approach by successful application to aqueous dispersions of\nnon-motile bacteria and of colloidal aggregates of spherical particles.\n", "  Classical simulation of quantum computation has often been viewed as the\nmethod to determine where the horizon of quantum supremacy is located---that\nis, where quantum computation can no longer be simulated by classical methods.\nAs of now, the 50 qubit threshold for quantum supremacy has been determined\nlargely by the state vector simulation method's exponential space demands\nplacing an upper bound on simulation memory capabilities. To investigate this\nclaim, we present and test an implementation of a known path integral\nsimulation algorithm running in linear space; the method is based on\nrecursively traversing the underlying computation tree for quantum algorithms\nand summing over possible amplitudes. We find that the implementation is able\nto simulate the hidden subgroup method (HSP) standard method---a notable class\nof circuits including Shor's algorithm amongst others---in a reasonable amount\nof time using extremely low memory, as well as other circuits with similar\nparameters. The performance results of this algorithm suggest that it can serve\nas a feasible alternative to state vector simulation and that with respect to\nthe HSP standard method, quantum supremacy may be more accurately measured\nusing the recursive path-summing method on large numbers of qubits, compared to\nthe state vector method.\n", "  For a gas at thermal equilibrium, it is usually assumed that the velocity\ndistribution follows an isotropic 3-dimensional Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) law.\nThis assumption classically implies the assumption of a \"cos theta\" law for the\nflux of atoms leaving the surface, although such a law has no grounds in\nsurface physics. In a variety of recently developed sub-Doppler laser\nspectroscopy techniques for gases one-dimensionally confined in a thin cell,\nthe specific contribution of atoms moving nearly parallel to the boundary of\nthe vapor container becomes essential. We report here on the implementation of\nan experiment to probe effectively the distribution of atomic velocities\nparallel to the windows for a thin (60 microns) Cs vapor cell. The principle of\nthe set-up relies on a spatially separated pump-probe experiment, where the\nvariations of the signal amplitude with the pump-probe separation provide the\ninformation on the velocity distribution. The experiment is performed in a\nsapphire cell on the Cs resonance line, which benefits of a long-lived\nhyperfine optical pumping. Presently, we can analyze specifically the density\nof atoms with slow normal velocities ~ 5-20 m/s, already corresponding to\nunusual grazing flight theta at ~85{\\deg}-88.5{\\deg} from the normal to the\nsurface and no deviation from the M-B law is found within the limits of our\nelementary set-up. Finally we suggest tracks to explore more parallel\nvelocities, when surface details -roughness or structure- and the atom-surface\ninteraction should play a key role to restrict the applicability of a M-B-type\ndistribution.\n", "  Holographic principle states that the maximum entropy of a system is its\nboundary area in Planck units. However, such a holographic entropy cannot be\nrealized by the conventional quantum field theory. We need a new microscopic\ntheory which naturally possesses all the holographic degrees of freedom. In\nthis paper, we provide some preliminary thoughts on how to construct a theory\nwith holographic degrees of freedom. It may shed light on the understanding of\nquantum properties of gravity and the early stage of the universe.\n", "  We report an integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) observation of a\ngravitationally lensed spiral galaxy A1689B11 at redshift $z=2.54$. It is the\nmost ancient spiral galaxy discovered to date and the second kinematically\nconfirmed spiral at $z\\gtrsim2$. Thanks to gravitational lensing, this is also\nby far the deepest IFS observation with the highest spatial resolution ($\\sim$\n400 pc) on a spiral galaxy at a cosmic time when the Hubble sequence is about\nto emerge. After correcting for a lensing magnification of 7.2 $\\pm$ 0.8, this\nprimitive spiral disk has an intrinsic star formation rate of 22 $\\pm$ 2\n$M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, a stellar mass of 10$^{9.8 \\pm 0.3}$$M_{\\odot}$ and a\nhalf-light radius of $r_{1/2}=2.6 \\pm 0.7$ kpc, typical of a main-sequence\nstar-forming (SF) galaxy at $z\\sim2$. However, the H\\alpha\\ kinematics show a\nsurprisingly tranquil velocity field with an ordered rotation ($V_{\\rm c}$ =\n200 $\\pm$ 12 km/s) and uniformly small velocity dispersions ($V_{\\rm \\sigma,\nmean}$ = 23 $\\pm$ 4 km/s and $V_{\\rm \\sigma, outer-disk}$ = 15 $\\pm$ 2 km/s).\nThe low gas velocity dispersion is similar to local spiral galaxies and is\nconsistent with the classic density wave theory where spiral arms form in\ndynamically cold and thin disks. We speculate that A1689B11 belongs to a\npopulation of rare spiral galaxies at $z\\gtrsim2$ that mark the formation epoch\nof thin disks. Future observations with JWST will greatly increase the sample\nof these rare galaxies and unveil the earliest onset of spiral arms.\n", "  Ni-rich $\\gamma$ cells and Nb-rich eutectic droplets that form during laser\npower bed fusion solidification of Ni-Nb alloys are studied using experiments\nand simulations. Finite element simulations estimate the cooling rates in the\nmelt pool and phase-field simulations predict the resulting cellular\nmicrostructures. The cell and droplet spacings are determined as a function of\ncooling rate and fit to a power law. The formation of Laves phase is predicted\nfor a critical composition of Nb in the liquid droplets. Finally, our\nsimulations demonstrate that anisotropy in the $\\gamma$ orientation influences\nthe Laves fraction significantly.\n", "  Using algebraic techniques we obtain quasinormal modes and frequencies\nassociated to generalized forms of the scattering P\\\"oschl-Teller potential.\nThis approach is based on the association of the corresponding equations of\nmotion with Casimir invariants of differential representations of the Lie\nalgebra sl(2). In the presented development, highest weight representations are\nconstructed and fundamental states are calculated. An infinite tower of\nquasinormal mode solutions is obtained by the action of a lowering operator.\nThe algebraic results are used in the analysis of the Cauchy initial value\nproblem associated to the generalized P\\\"oschl-Teller potentials. For the\nscattering potentials considered, there are no late-time tails and the dynamics\nis always stable.\n", "  We study long range density fluctuations (hyperuniformity) in two-dimensional\njammed packings of bidisperse droplets. Taking advantage of microfluidics, we\nsystematically span a large range of size and concentration ratios of the two\ndroplet populations. We identify various defects increasing long range density\nfluctuations mainly due to organization of local particle environment. By\nchoosing an appropriate bidispersity, we fabricate materials with a high level\nof hyperuniformity. Interesting transparency properties of these optimized\nmaterials are established based on numerical simulations.\n", "  We consider the uncertainty bound on the sum of variances of two incompatible\nobservables in order to derive a corresponding steering inequality. Our\nsteering criterion when applied to discrete variables yields the optimum\nsteering range for two qubit Werner states in the two measurement and two\noutcome scenario. We further employ the derived steering relation for several\nclasses of continuous variable systems. We show that non-Gaussian entangled\nstates such as the photon subtracted squeezed vacuum state and the\ntwo-dimensional harmonic oscillator state furnish greater violation of the sum\nsteering relation compared to the Reid criterion as well as the entropic\nsteering criterion. The sum steering inequality provides a tighter steering\ncondition to reveal the steerability of continuous variable states.\n", "  We present a ground-to-space quantum key distribution (QKD) mission concept\nand the accompanying feasibility study for the development of the low earth\norbit CubeSat payload. The quantum information is carried by single photons\nwith the binary codes represented by polarization states of the photons.\nDistribution of entangled photons between the ground and the satellite can be\nused to certify the quantum nature of the link: a guarantee that no\neavesdropping can take place. By placing the entangled photon source on the\nground, the space segments contains only the less complex detection system,\nenabling its implementation in a compact enclosure, compatible with the 12U\nCubeSat standard (12 dm3). This reduces the overall cost of the project, making\nit an ideal choice as a pathfinder for future European quantum communication\nsatellite missions. The space segment is also more versatile than one that\ncontains the source since it is compatible with a multiple of QKD protocols\n(not restricted to entangled photon schemes) and can be used in quantum physics\nexperiments, such as the investigation of entanglement decoherence. Other\npossible experiments include atmospheric transmission/turbulence\ncharacterization, dark area mapping, fine pointing and tracking, and accurate\nclock synchronization; all crucial for future global scale quantum\ncommunication efforts.\n", "  With nowadays steadily growing quantum processors, it is required to develop\nnew quantum tomography tools that are tailored for high-dimensional systems. In\nthis work, we describe such a computational tool, based on recent ideas from\nnon-convex optimization. The algorithm excels in the compressed-sensing-like\nsetting, where only a few data points are measured from a low-rank or\nhighly-pure quantum state of a high-dimensional system. We show that the\nalgorithm can practically be used in quantum tomography problems that are\nbeyond the reach of convex solvers, and, moreover, is faster than other\nstate-of-the-art non-convex approaches. Crucially, we prove that, despite being\na non-convex program, under mild conditions, the algorithm is guaranteed to\nconverge to the global minimum of the problem; thus, it constitutes a provable\nquantum state tomography protocol.\n", "  We show that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in InSe enables the optical transition\nacross the principal band gap to couple with in-plane polarized light. This\ntransition, enabled by $p_{x,y}\\leftrightarrow p_z$ hybridization due to\nintra-atomic SOC in both In and Se, can be viewed as a transition between two\ndominantly $s$- and $p_z$-orbital based bands, accompanied by an electron\nspin-flip. Having parametrized $\\mathbf{k\\cdot p}$ theory using first\nprinciples density functional theory we estimate the absorption for\n$\\sigma^{\\pm}$ circularly polarized photons in the monolayer as $\\sim 1.5\\%$,\nwhich saturates to $\\sim 0.3\\%$ in thicker films ($3-5$ layers). Circularly\npolarized light can be used to selectively excite electrons into spin-polarized\nstates in the conduction band, which permits optical pumping of the spin\npolarization of In nuclei through the hyperfine interaction.\n", "  We report a study of magnetism and magnetic transitions of hexagonal\nErMnO$_3$ single crystals by magnetization, specific heat and heat transport\nmeasurements. Magnetization data show that the $c$-axis magnetic field induces\nthree magnetic transitions at 0.8, 12 and 28 T. The specific heat shows a peak\nat 2.2 K, which is due to a magnetic transition of Er$^{3+}$ moments. For\nlow-$T$ thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$), a clear dip-like feature appears in\n$\\kappa(H)$ isotherm at 1--1.25 T for $H \\parallel ab$; while in the case of $H\n\\parallel c$, a step-like increase is observed at 0.5--0.8 T. The transition\nfields in $\\kappa(H)$ are in good agreement with those obtained from\nmagnetization, and the anomaly of $\\kappa$ can be understood by a spin-phonon\nscattering scenario. The natures of magnetic structures and corresponding\nfield-induced transitions at low temperatures are discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we use the unified transform method to consider the\ninitial-boundary value problem for the coupled Fokas-Lenells equations on the\nhalf-line, assuming that the solution $\\{q(x,t),r(x,t)\\}$ of the coupled\nFokas-Lenells equations exists, we show that $\\{q_x(x,t),r_x(x,t)\\}$ can be\nexpressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem\nformulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $\\lambda$. Thus, the\nsolution $\\{q(x,t),r(x,t)\\}$ can be obtained by integration with respect to\n$x$.\n", "  Energetically minimum configurations of the first- and second-nearest\nneighbor (NN) CO2 molecules surrounding a vacancy, created by removing a single\nmolecule from the Pa3 structure, were calculated by use of the Monte Carlo\nsimulation technique at zero temperature. It was found that among the 1st NN\nmolecules, only six NN molecules, closest to the oxygen atoms of the removed\nCO2 molecule, significantly changed the positions and orientations, while the\nother six molecules were not influenced by the creation of the vacancy. The\nconfigurations of the molecules no longer had the three-fold symmetry that the\nPa3 structure possessed. The influence of the vacancy on the 2nd NN molecules\nwas relatively small.\n", "  We study the induced interaction between multiple probes locally interacting\nwith driven colloids and trapped in a toroidal geometry. The effective binary\nforces between the probes break the action-reaction principle and their range\ndecreases with the driving. We demonstrate how in the stationary nonlinear\nnonequilibrium regime these interactions induce stability of a crystal-like\npattern, where the probes are equidistant, when the probe-colloid interaction\nis either completely attractive or completely repulsive.\n", "  The coupling of electron orbital motion and spin leads to nontrivial changes\nin energy-level structures, leading to various spectroscopies and applications.\nIn atoms, such spin-orbit coupling (SOC) causes anomalous Zeeman splitting,\nknown as the Paschen-Back (PB) effect, in the pres-ence of a strong magnetic\nfield. In solids, SOC generates energy-band inversion or splitting, a\nprerequisite for topological phases or Majorana fermions, at zero or weak\nmagnetic fields. Here, we present the first observation of PB splitting of\nLandau levels (LLs) in indium arsenide nan-owires in a strong-field regime. Our\nenergy-resolved transport spectroscopy results indicated the presence of\nLL-dependent anomalous Zeeman splitting in these nanowires, analogous to the\natomic PB effect. This result was found to be in good agreement with a\ntheoretical analysis based on Rashba SOC. Our findings also suggested a way of\ngenerating spin-resolved electron transport in nanowires.\n", "  We show that the central finite difference formula for the first and the\nsecond derivative of a function can be derived, in the context of quantum\nmechanics, as matrix elements of the momentum and kinetic energy operators\nusing, as a basis set, the discrete coordinate eigenkets $\\vert x_n\\rangle$\ndefined on the uniform grid $x_n=na$. Simple closed form expressions of the\nmatrix elements are obtained starting from integrals involving the canonical\ncommutation rule. A detailed analysis of the convergence toward the continuum\nlimit with respect to both the grid spacing and the approximation order is\npresented. It is shown that the convergence from below of the eigenvalues in\nelectronic structure calculations is an intrinsic feature of the finite\ndifference method.\n", "  We apply four statistical learning methods to a sample of $7941$ galaxies\n($z<0.06$) from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to test the\nfeasibility of using automated algorithms to classify galaxies. Using $10$\nfeatures measured for each galaxy (sizes, colours, shape parameters \\& stellar\nmass) we apply the techniques of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification\nTrees (CT), Classification Trees with Random Forest (CTRF) and Neural Networks\n(NN), returning True Prediction Ratios (TPRs) of $75.8\\%$, $69.0\\%$, $76.2\\%$\nand $76.0\\%$ respectively. Those occasions whereby all four algorithms agree\nwith each other yet disagree with the visual classification (`unanimous\ndisagreement') serves as a potential indicator of human error in\nclassification, occurring in $\\sim9\\%$ of ellipticals, $\\sim9\\%$ of Little Blue\nSpheroids, $\\sim14\\%$ of early-type spirals, $\\sim21\\%$ of intermediate-type\nspirals and $\\sim4\\%$ of late-type spirals \\& irregulars. We observe that the\nchoice of parameters rather than that of algorithms is more crucial in\ndetermining classification accuracy. Due to its simplicity in formulation and\nimplementation, we recommend the CTRF algorithm for classifying future galaxy\ndatasets. Adopting the CTRF algorithm, the TPRs of the 5 galaxy types are : E,\n$70.1\\%$; LBS, $75.6\\%$; S0-Sa, $63.6\\%$; Sab-Scd, $56.4\\%$ and Sd-Irr,\n$88.9\\%$. Further, we train a binary classifier using this CTRF algorithm that\ndivides galaxies into spheroid-dominated (E, LBS \\& S0-Sa) and disk-dominated\n(Sab-Scd \\& Sd-Irr), achieving an overall accuracy of $89.8\\%$. This translates\ninto an accuracy of $84.9\\%$ for spheroid-dominated systems and $92.5\\%$ for\ndisk-dominated systems.\n", "  A multiwavelength study of laboratory carbons with varying degrees of\nhydrogenation and sp$^2$ hybridization is required to characterize the\nstructure of the carbonaceous carriers of interstellar and circumstellar\nextinction. Analogs to carbonaceous interstellar dust encountered in various\nphases of the interstellar medium have been prepared in the laboratory. Thin\nfilms have been measured in transmission in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV; 120 -\n210 nm) within the atmospheric pressure experiment (APEX) chamber of the DISCO\nbeam line at the SOLEIL synchrotron radiation facility. Spectra of these films\nwere further measured through the UV-Vis (210 nm - 1 $\\mu$m) and in the\nmid-infrared (3 - 15 $\\mu$m). Tauc optical gaps, E$_g$, are derived from the\nvisible spectra. The major spectral features are fitted through the VUV to the\nmid infrared to obtain positions, full-widths at half maximum (FWHM), and\nintegrated intensities. These are plotted against the position of the\n$\\pi$-$\\pi^*$ electronic transitions peak. Unidentified or overlapping features\nin the UV are identified by correlations with complementary infrared data. A\ncorrelation between the optical gap and position of the $\\pi$-$\\pi^*$\nelectronic transitions peak is found. The latter is also correlated to the\nposition of the sp$^3$ carbon defect band at ~8 $\\mu$m, the aromatic C=C\nstretching mode position at ~6 $\\mu$m, and the H/C ratio. Our study suggests\nthat carriers of the interstellar UV bump should exhibit infrared bands akin to\nthe A/B classes of the aromatic infrared bands, while the circumstellar bump\ncarriers should exhibit bands corresponding to the B/C classes.\n", "  Traditional force-fields cannot model chemical reactivity, and suffer from\nlow generality without re-fitting. Neural network potentials promise to address\nthese problems, offering energies and forces with near ab-initio accuracy at\nlow cost. However a data-driven approach is naturally inefficient for\nlong-range interatomic forces that have simple physical formulas. In this\nmanuscript we construct a hybrid model chemistry consisting of a nearsighted\nNeural-Network potential with screened long-range electrostatic and\nVan-Der-Waals physics. This trained potential, simply dubbed \"TensorMol-0.1\",\nis offered in an open-source python package capable of many of the simulation\ntypes commonly used to study chemistry: Geometry optimizations, harmonic\nspectra, and open or periodic molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and nudged\nelastic band calculations. We describe the robustness and speed of the package,\ndemonstrating millihartree accuracy and scalability to tens-of-thousands of\natoms on ordinary laptops. We demonstrate the performance of the model by\nreproducing vibrational spectra, and simulating molecular dynamics of a\nprotein. Our comparisons with electronic structure theory and experiment\ndemonstrate that neural network molecular dynamics is poised to become an\nimportant tool for molecular simulation, lowering the resource barrier to\nsimulate chemistry.\n", "  Laser interaction with uniform and nanostructured near-critical plasmas has\nbeen investigated by means of 2D particle-in-cell simulations. The effect of a\nnanostructure (modeled as a collection of solid-density nanospheres) on energy\nabsorption and radiative losses has been assessed in a wide range of laser\nintensities and average densities of the target. The nanostructure was found to\naffect mainly the conversion efficiency of laser energy into ion kinetic energy\nand radiative losses for the highest simulated intensities.\n", "  A common viewpoint is that a particle could be quantum entangled with another\nparticle arbitrarily far away. But in this paper we suggest that there is an\nutmost distance for the existence of quantum entanglement between two\nparticles, beyond which the initial quantum entanglement would be broken by\nsome quantum gravitational effect. The utmost distance is proposed to be\n$L_{QE}=\\lambda^\\alpha l_{p}^{1-\\alpha}$, where $\\lambda$ is the quantum\nwavelength of the particles and $l_{p}= 1.616 \\times 10^{-35} m$ is the Planck\nlength. The most probable value of the parameter $\\alpha$ is $2$ or $3$. As\nother quantum-gravitational effects, this effect is very weak and hard to be\ndetected in foreseeable experiment.\n", "  We study S-duality of Argyres-Douglas theories obtained by compactification\nof 6d (2,0) theories of ADE type on a sphere with irregular punctures. The\nweakly coupled descriptions are given by the degeneration limit of auxiliary\nRiemann sphere with marked points, among which three punctured sphere\nrepresents isolated superconformal theories. We also discuss twisted irregular\npunctures and their S-duality.\n", "  We compare two approaches to refine the \"linear model\" of cavity\noptomechanics, in order to describe radiation pressure effects that are beyond\nfirst order in the coupling constant. We compare corrections derived from (I) a\nwidely used phenomenological Hamiltonian that conserves the photon number and\n(II) a two-mode truncation of C. K. Law's microscopic model, which we take as\nthe \"true\" Hamiltonian of the system. While these approaches agree at first\norder, the latter model does not conserve the photon number, resulting in\nchallenging computations from second order onwards. Our numerics suggest that\nthe phenomenological Hamiltonian significantly improves the linear model, yet\nit does not fully capture all second-order corrections arising from the C. K.\nLaw model. We conclude that, even when the mechanical frequency is much lower\nthan the cavity one, photon number conservation must be eventually given up to\nmodel cavity optomechanics with high accuracy.\n", "  The thesis is centred on the theory of experimental methods in solid-state\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy, which deals with the\ninteraction of electromagnetic radiation with nuclei in a magnetic field and\npossessing a fundamental quantum mechanical property called spin.\nOrientation-dependent interactions in ssNMR, while offering a wealth of\ninformation, lead to broad indistinct signal and therefore are averaged out,\npredominantly by Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS). Reintroduction of the coupling\ninteractions is achieved through radio frequency recoupling pulse sequences.\nNMR experiments are in general understood by finding the effective Hamiltonian,\nwhich best approximates the spin dynamics and is found using average\nHamiltonian theory (AHT) or the Floquet theory, the former is the popular\napproach. The two theories yield the same effective Hamiltonian, valid for\nstroboscopic observations. Generalised expressions, for the effective\nHamiltonian using AHT, are derived in the frequency domain in this dissertation\nto allow for appreciation of the equivalence with Floquet theory-mediated\neffective Hamiltonian. The derivation relies on the ability to express the time\ndependency of the interactions with a finite set of fundamental frequencies,\nwhich has long been sought and the lack of which has, at times, been\nmisunderstood as limitations of AHT. A formalism to represent any periodic\ntime-dependent interaction in the Fourier space with no more than two\nfundamental frequencies for every involved spin, presented here, which allows\nfor the computation of effective Hamiltonian for any pulsed experiment. The\nformalism has been applied to understand established dipolar recoupling pulse\nsequences. Limitations of the pulse sequences are addressed by designing novel\nvariants of the pulse sequences, aided by insights gained through the effective\nHamiltonian description.\n", "  Atom probe tomography (APT) is a valuable near-atomic scale imaging\ntechnique, which yields mass spectrographic data. Experimental correctness can\noften pivot on the identification of peaks within a dataset, this is a manual\nprocess where subjectivity and errors can arise. The limitations of manual\nprocedures complicate APT experiments for the operator and furthermore are a\nbarrier to technique standardisation. In this work we explore the capabilities\nof computer-guided ranging to aid identification and analysis of mass spectra.\nWe propose a fully robust algorithm for enumeration of the possible identities\nof detected peak positions, which assists labelling. Furthermore, a simple\nranking scheme is developed to allow for evaluation of the likelihood of each\npossible identity being the likely assignment from the enumerated set. We\ndemonstrate a simple, yet complete work-chain that allows for the conversion of\nmass-spectra to fully identified APT spectra, with the goal of minimising\nidentification errors, and the inter-operator variance within APT experiments.\nThis work chain is compared to current procedures via experimental trials with\ndifferent APT operators, to determine the relative effectiveness and precision\nof the two approaches. It is found that there is little loss of precision (and\noccasionally gain) when participants are given computer assistance. We find\nthat in either case, inter-operator precision for ranging varies between 0 and\n2 \"significant figures\" (2{\\sigma} confidence in the first n digits of the\nreported value) when reporting compositions. Intra-operator precision is weakly\ntested and found to vary between 1 and 3 significant figures, depending upon\nspecies composition levels. Finally it is suggested that inconsistencies in\ninter-operator peak labelling may be the largest source of scatter when\nreporting composition data in APT.\n", "  First steps towards developing a new perturbation theory for molecular\nliquids are taken. By choosing a new form of splitting the site-site potential\nfunctions between molecules, we will get a set of atomic fluids as the\nreference system with known structure and thermodynamics. The perturbative part\nof the potential function is then expanded up to two terms. The excess\nHelmholtz free energy of the system is then obtained for three computable\ncontributions. The derivation shows that the excess Helmholtz free energy has\nnothing to do with intra-atomic potentials, all contributions come merely from\ninter-atomic potentials. Then it is applied to compute the thermodynamics of\ntwo systems; hard sphere chain and carbon dioxide molecular fluids. The results\ncompared with the computer simulation data show that the theory works well at\nlow densities.\n", "  In this paper we present a constitutive model to describe unsaturated flow\nthat considers the hysteresis phenomena. This constitutive model provides\nsimple mathematical expressions for both saturation and hydraulic conductivity\ncurves, and a relationship between permeability and porosity. The model is\nbased on the assumption that the porous media can be represented by a bundle of\ncapillary tubes with throats or \"ink-bottles\" and a fractal pore size\ndistribution. Under these hypotheses, hysteretic curves are obtained for\nsaturation and relative hydraulic conductivity in terms of pressure head.\nHowever, a non-hysteretic relationship is obtained when relative hydraulic\nconductivity is expressed as a function of saturation. The proposed\nrelationship between permeability and porosity is similar to the well-known\nKozeny-Carman equation but depends on the fractal dimension. The performance of\nthe constitutive model is tested against different sets of experimental data\nand previous models. In all of the cases the proposed expressions fit fairly\nwell the experimental data and predicts values of permeability and hydraulic\nconductivity better than others models.\n", "  The Coulomb dissociation is studied of the $^8L$i nuclei on Pb target at\nenergies 40.3 and 69.5 MeV/nucleon, in the experiment NSCL #03038. The\n$^{6,7}$Li, $^{4,6}$He, and $^2$H fragments were identified. The resonance\ndecay and the direct breakup reactions were observed. The data give\nexperimental evidence that the Coulomb dissociation is a two-step process. The\nprojectile in the approaching phase is braked down and the valence neutron gets\nforced oscillation. The increasing Coulonb force holds the projectile and\nbrings through the excited states up to the closest approach point. There\nreleased, the projectile is trapped into a primary, highly excited state in the\ncontinuum. The lifetime of the primary state depends on the multipolarity of\nthe deformed projectile. At intermediate energy the collision is a sudden\nreaction, the valence neutron may stay --- during the impact --- in the forward\nor backward hemisphere of the nucleus, and the orbit of the valence neutron\ngets prolate or oblate, dipole or multipole deformation and the nucleus gets\nsingle-particle or collective excitation. The primary excited states,\ndeveloping will decay prompt or delayed into the same reaction channel,\nresulting in the two decay mechanisms.\n", "  In order to shed light on the second harmonic generation (SHG) of new 2-D\nsystems, first principles methods are used to calculate the second order\nsusceptibility \\chi(2) for different types of layered alloys such as monolayers\nof transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) alloys, TMD Haeckelite alloys,\nnanotubes of TMD alloys, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) systems which include\nBxNyCz alloys, BN and BNC2 nanotubes, BxNxCy Haeckelites and BN Schwarzites\n(porous BN). It is found that the tungsten based alloys possess higher \\chi(2)\nthan Mo based at high photon energies, but at low energies, one type of MoSSe\ndominates. The hypothetical TMD Haeckelites NbSSe and Nb0.5Ta0.5S2 reveal the\nhighest \\chi(2) of all the calculated structures. Zigzag TMD alloy nanotubes\nshow higher \\chi(2) as the diameter is reduced and approximate to the monolayer\nfor big diameters. BNC alloys exhibit a higher \\chi(2) than the h-BN monolayer\nand are comparable to TMD alloys, except for one case which doubles its\nintensity. The BN tubes show an increase of \\chi(2) as the diameter decreases,\nsimilarly to the TMD nanotubes. BxNxCy Haeckelites possess a very high \\chi(2)\nand may shed light on the role of extended defects in nonlinear optical\nproperties. One of the BN Schwarzites exhibits a higher \\chi(2) than already\nknown 3-D materials.\n", "  We report a computational discovery of novel grain boundary structures and\nmultiple grain boundary phases in elemental bcc tungsten. While grain boundary\nstructures created by the \\gamma-surface method as a union of two perfect half\ncrystals have been studied extensively, it is known that the method has\nlimitations and does not always predict the correct ground states. Here, we use\na newly developed computational tool, based on evolutionary algorithms, to\nperform a grand-canonical search of a high-angle symmetric tilt boundary in\ntungsten, and we find new ground states and multiple phases that cannot be\ndescribed using the conventional structural unit model. We use MD simulations\nto demonstrate that the new structures can coexist at finite temperature in a\nclosed system, confirming these are examples of different GB phases. The new\nground state is confirmed by first-principles calculations.\n", "  Earth's climate, mantle, and core interact over geologic timescales. Climate\ninfluences whether plate tectonics can take place on a planet, with cool\nclimates being favorable for plate tectonics because they enhance stresses in\nthe lithosphere, suppress plate boundary annealing, and promote hydration and\nweakening of the lithosphere. Plate tectonics plays a vital role in the\nlong-term carbon cycle, which helps to maintain a temperate climate. Plate\ntectonics provides long-term cooling of the core, which is vital for generating\na magnetic field, and the magnetic field is capable of shielding atmospheric\nvolatiles from the solar wind. Coupling between climate, mantle, and core can\npotentially explain the divergent evolution of Earth and Venus. As Venus lies\ntoo close to the sun for liquid water to exist, there is no long-term carbon\ncycle and thus an extremely hot climate. Therefore plate tectonics cannot\noperate and a long-lived core dynamo cannot be sustained due to insufficient\ncore cooling. On planets within the habitable zone where liquid water is\npossible, a wide range of evolutionary scenarios can take place depending on\ninitial atmospheric composition, bulk volatile content, or the timing of when\nplate tectonics initiates, among other factors. Many of these evolutionary\ntrajectories would render the planet uninhabitable. However, there is still\nsignificant uncertainty over the nature of the coupling between climate,\nmantle, and core. Future work is needed to constrain potential evolutionary\nscenarios and the likelihood of an Earth-like evolution.\n", "  Computational imaging through scatter generally is accomplished by first\ncharacterizing the scattering medium so that its forward operator is obtained;\nand then imposing additional priors in the form of regularizers on the\nreconstruction functional so as to improve the condition of the originally\nill-posed inverse problem. In the functional, the forward operator and\nregularizer must be entered explicitly or parametrically (e.g. scattering\nmatrices and dictionaries, respectively.) However, the process of determining\nthese representations is often incomplete, prone to errors, or infeasible.\nRecently, deep learning architectures have been proposed to instead learn both\nthe forward operator and regularizer through examples. Here, we propose for the\nfirst time, to our knowledge, a convolutional neural network architecture\ncalled \"IDiffNet\" for the problem of imaging through diffuse media and\ndemonstrate that IDiffNet has superior generalization capability through\nextensive tests with well-calibrated diffusers. We found that the Negative\nPearson Correlation Coefficient loss function for training is more appropriate\nfor spatially sparse objects and strong scattering conditions. Our results show\nthat the convolutional architecture is robust to the choice of prior, as\ndemonstrated by the use of multiple training and testing object databases, and\ncapable of achieving higher space-bandwidth product reconstructions than\npreviously reported.\n", "  We examine Ralph's equivalent circuit model of D-CTCs, which was proposed to\nderive Deutsch's maximum entropy rule of D-CTCs. By constructing\ncounterexamples we show that the equivalent circuit model does not always\nreproduce the unique fixed state with the maximal von Neumann entropy. We\nspeculate that the equivalent circuit model remains the correct description of\nD-CTCs and it can reproduce a revised maximum entropy rule of D-CTCs. We also\nsuggest that the revised maximum entropy rule may eliminate the discontinuous\nquantum evolutions of D-CTCs.\n", "  We demonstrate that a complete projection in Hilbert Space figuratively\ndescribes a superposed state, introducing a new scale to qualify an FSO system.\nMeasurement simulation of superposed OAM beam through this projection scheme is\ngiven.\n", "  Understanding the energy transport by charge carriers and phonons in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures is essential for the\ndevelopment of future energy-efficient 2D nanoelectronics. Here, we performed\nin situ spatially resolved Raman thermometry on an electrically biased graphene\nchannel and its hBN substrate to study the energy dissipation mechanism in\ngraphene/hBN heterostructures. By comparing the temperature profile along the\nbiased graphene channel with that along the hBN substrate, we found that the\nthermal boundary resistance between the graphene and hBN was in the range of\n(1-2) x 10^(-7) m^(2) KW^(-1) from ~100 C to the onset of graphene break-down\nat ~600 C in air. Consideration of an electro-thermal transport model together\nwith the Raman thermometry conducted in air showed that local doping occurred\nunder a strong electric field played a crucial role in the energy dissipation\nof the graphene/hBN device up to T ~ 600 C.\n", "  The Belle-II VerteX Detector (VXD) is a 6 layers silicon tracker device that\nwill cope with an unprecedented luminosity of 8 x 10^35 cm-2 s-1 achievable by\nthe new SuperKEKB e+e- collider, now under commissioning at the KEK laboratory\n(Tsukuba, Japan). A radiation monitoring and beam abort system has been\ndeveloped based on single-crystal s-CVD diamond sensors. The sensors will be\nplaced in 20 key positions in the vicinity of the interaction region. The\nsevere space limitations require a remote readout of the sensors. In this\ncontribution we present the system design, along with the sensor\ncharacterisation procedure. We present also the preliminary results with the\nprototype system during the first SuperKEKB commissioning phase in\nFebruary-June 2016.\n", "  The paper introduces a novel topological method for prediction and modeling\nfor a nonlinear time--series that exhibit recurring patterns. According to the\nmodel, global manifold of the reconstructed state--space can be approximated by\na few overlapping recurrence neighborhoods. The inherent redundancy structure\nof the delay embedding procedure and the property of recurrence are used to\nreduce the computational load, which is inevitable in nonlinear analysis. The\nmodeling and prediction possibilities of the model are demonstrated using (i) a\nnumerical data generated by a dynamical system: the Duffing oscillator and (ii)\na real--life data: Electrocardiogram ECG data of a healthy human. A potential\napplication of the proposed model is demonstrated for a multivariate\ncardiovascular data set that exhibits the property of recurrence. Real--time\nmonitoring of cardiovascular signals are essential in clinical research and\ncorruption of data are very common. It is a challenging task for a model to\nperform cognitive functions based on the contextual information, explicitly\npredicting gaps or loss of data and identifying noises in the physiological\ndata. Paper concludes with an application of the proposed model in addressing\nsome of these the issues.\n", "  Topological insulators have inspired the study with various quantum\nsimulators. Exploiting the tunability of the qubit frequency and qubit-qubit\ncoupling, we show that a superconducting qubit chain can simulate various\ntopological band models. When the system is restricted to the single-spin\nexcitation subspace, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model can be equivalently\nsimulated by alternating the coupling strength between neighboring qubits. The\nexistence of topological edge states in this qubit chain is demonstrated in the\nquench dynamics after the first qubit is excited. This excitation propagates\nalong the chain where the qubit-qubit coupling is homogeneous. In contrast, in\nour qubit chain, the spin-up state localizes at the first qubit and the rest\nqubits remain in the spin-down state. We further show that the spin-up state\ncan be transported along the chain by modulating the coupling strengths and the\nqubit frequencies. This demonstrates adiabatic pumping based on the Rice-Mele\nmodel. Moreover, we also discuss possible ways to construct other topological\nmodels with different topological phenomena within the current technology of\nsuperconducting qubits.\n", "  Recent experiments (Le Bouil et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 112, 246001)\nhave analyzed the statistics of local deformation in a granular solid\nundergoing plastic deformation. Experiments report strongly anisotropic\ncorrelation between events, with a characteristic angle that was interpreted\nusing elasticity theory and the concept of Eshelby transformations with\ndilation; interestingly, the shear bands that characterize macroscopic failure\noccur at an angle that is different from the one observed in microscopic\ncorrelations. Here, we interpret this behavior using a mesoscale elastoplastic\nmodel of solid flow that incorporates a local Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion.\nWe show that the angle observed in the microscopic correlations can be\nunderstood by combining the elastic interactions associated with Eshelby\ntransformation with the local failure criterion. At large strains, we also\ninduce permanent shear bands at an angle that is different from the one\nobserved in the correlation pattern. We interpret this angle as the one that\nleads to the maximal instability of slip lines.\n", "  Social media has changed the ways of communication, where everyone is\nequipped with the power to express their opinions to others in online\ndiscussion platforms. Previously, a number of stud- ies have been presented to\nidentify opinion leaders in online discussion networks. Feng (\"Are you\nconnected? Evaluating information cascade in online discussion about the\n#RaceTogether campaign\", Computers in Human Behavior, 2016) identified five\ntypes of central users and their communication patterns in an online\ncommunication network of a limited time span. However, to trace the change in\ncommunication pattern, a long-term analysis is required. In this study, we\ncritically analyzed framework presented by Feng based on five types of central\nusers in online communication network and their communication pattern in a\nlong-term manner. We take another case study presented by Udnor et al.\n(\"Determining social media impact on the politics of developing countries using\nsocial network analytics\", Program, 2016) to further understand the dynamics as\nwell as to perform validation . Results indicate that there may not exist all\nof these central users in an online communication network in a long-term\nmanner. Furthermore, we discuss the changing positions of opinion leaders and\ntheir power to keep isolates interested in an online discussion network.\n", "  Transmission profiles in bilayer graphene have been studied theoretically in\npresence of a pair of delta function magnetic barriers. Two types of asymmetric\nFano resonances are discussed in connection to the electronic cloaking effect\nin graphene nanostructures. One arises in a static (time independent) vector\nbarrier due to the quantum interference between the discrete hole like state\ninside the barrier and the electron like continuum outside. In this case the\ncomputed results for normal incidence indirectly verify that the cloaking\neffect is a manifestation of the chirality conservation in charge transport\nthrough bilayer graphene scalar barriers. While the other arising due to\ndiscrete continuum coupling via the exchange of photon under the application of\nan external time periodic scalar potential. The study of Fano resonances in\ntransmission spectrum is very much urgent in regards of localization of charge\ncarriers in graphene nano structures for its application in digital device\nfabrication.\n", "  Ductile damage modeling within the Small Punch Test (SPT) is extensively\ninvestigated. The capabilities of the SPT to reliably estimate fracture and\ndamage properties are thoroughly discussed and emphasis is placed on the use of\nnotched specimens. First, different notch profiles are analyzed and constraint\nconditions quantified. The role of the notch shape is comprehensively examined\nfrom both triaxiality and notch fabrication perspectives. Afterwards, a\nmethodology is presented to extract the micromechanical-based ductile damage\nparameters from the load-displacement curve of notched SPT samples.\nFurthermore, Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman model predictions from a top-down\napproach are employed to gain insight into the mechanisms governing crack\ninitiation and subsequent propagation in small punch experiments. An accurate\nassessment of micromechanical toughness parameters from the SPT is of\ntremendous relevance when little material is available.\n", "  We consider how to quantify non-Gaussianity for the correlation of a\nbipartite quantum state by using various measures such as relative entropy and\ngeometric distances. We first show that an intuitive approach, i.e.,\nsubtracting the correlation of a reference Gaussian state from that of a target\nnon-Gaussian state, fails to yield a non-negative measure with monotonicity\nunder local Gaussian channels. Our finding clearly manifests that quantum-state\ncorrelations generally have no Gaussian extremality. We therefore propose a\ndifferent approach by introducing relevantly averaged states to address\ncorrelation. This enables us to define a non-Gaussianity measure based on,\ne.g., the trace-distance and the fidelity, fulfilling all requirements as a\nmeasure of non-Gaussian correlation. For the case of the fidelity-based\nmeasure, we also present readily computable lower bounds of non-Gaussian\ncorrelation.\n", "  Temperature dependence of the capacitance of the electrical double layer\n(EDL) in concentrated electrolytes/ionic liquids has been under debates for\ndecades. To rationalise the capacitance vs temperature dependence, we run\nmolecular dynamics simulations of the EDL at variable temperatures. We show\nthat the dependence is related to the smearing of the EDL multilayer structure\nwith increasing temperature. The results are in agreement with the recent\nexperimental data. To explain the results, we propose a phenomenological ionic\nbilayer model.\n", "  We present the results of a community study aimed at exploring some of the\nscientific opportunities that the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA)\ncould open in the field of multi-messenger time-domain astronomy. We focus on\ncompact binary mergers, golden astrophysical targets of ground-based\ngravitational wave (GW) detectors such as advanced LIGO. A decade from now, a\nlarge number of these mergers is likely to be discovered by a world-wide\nnetwork of GW detectors. This will enable the identification of host galaxies,\neither directly through detection of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, or\nindirectly by probing potential anisotropies in the spatial distribution of\nmergers. Identifying the host galaxy population of GW mergers would provide a\nway to constrain the efficiency of various binary neutron star (NS) or black\nhole (BH) formation scenarios, and the merger timescale distributions as linked\nto merger rates in early- and late-type galaxies. We discuss how a radio array\nwith ~10x the sensitivity of the current Karl G. Jansky VLA and ~10x the\nresolution, would enable resolved radio continuum studies of binary merger\nhosts, probing regions of the galaxy undergoing star formation (which can be\nheavily obscured by dust and gas), AGN components, and mapping the offset\ndistribution of the mergers with respect to the host galaxy light. For compact\nbinary mergers containing at least one NS and with associated EM counterparts,\nwe show how the ngVLA would enable direct size measurements of the relativistic\nmerger ejecta and probe, for the first time directly, their dynamics.\n", "  This project proposes to reuse the DAFNE accelerator complex for producing a\nhigh intensity (up to 10^10), high-quality beam of high-energy (up to 500 MeV)\npositrons for HEP experiments, mainly - but not only - motivated by light dark\nparticles searches. Such a facility would provide a unique source of\nultra-relativistic, narrow-band and low-emittance positrons, with a high duty\nfactor, without employing a cold technology, that would be an ideal facility\nfor exploring the existence of light dark matter particles, produced in\npositron-on-target annihilations into a photon+missing mass, and using the\nbump-hunt technique. The PADME experiment, that will use the extracted beam\nfrom the DAFNE BTF, is indeed limited by the low duty-factor (10^-5=200 ns/20\nms). The idea is to use a variant of the third of integer resonant extraction,\nwith the aim of getting a <10^-6 m rad emittance and, at the same time,\ntailoring the scheme to the peculiar optics of the DAFNE machine. In\nalternative, the possibility of kicking the positrons by means of channelling\neffects in crystals can be evaluated. This would not only increase the\nextraction efficiency but also improve the beam quality, thanks to the high\ncollimation of channelled particles.\n", "  Magnetic confinement of the winds of hot, massive stars has far-reaching\nconsequences on timescales ranging from hours to Myr. Understanding the\nlong-term effects of this interplay has already led to the identification of\ntwo new evolutionary pathways to form `heavy' stellar mass black holes and\npair-instability supernova even at galactic metallicity. We are performing 1D\nstellar evolution model calculations that, for the first time, account for the\nsurface effects and the time evolution of fossil magnetic fields. These models\nwill be thoroughly confronted with observations and will potentially lead to a\nsignificant revision of the derived parameters of observed magnetic massive\nstars.\n", "  We explore how ideas from infectious disease and genetics can be used to\nuncover patterns of cultural inheritance and innovation in a corpus of 591\nnational constitutions spanning 1789 - 2008. Legal \"Ideas\" are encoded as\n\"topics\" - words statistically linked in documents - derived from topic\nmodeling the corpus of constitutions. Using these topics we derive a diffusion\nnetwork for borrowing from ancestral constitutions back to the US Constitution\nof 1789 and reveal that constitutions are complex cultural recombinants. We\nfind systematic variation in patterns of borrowing from ancestral texts and\n\"biological\"-like behavior in patterns of inheritance with the distribution of\n\"offspring\" arising through a bounded preferential-attachment process. This\nprocess leads to a small number of highly innovative (influential)\nconstitutions some of which have yet to have been identified as so in the\ncurrent literature. Our findings thus shed new light on the critical nodes of\nthe constitution-making network. The constitutional network structure reflects\nperiods of intense constitution creation, and systematic patterns of variation\nin constitutional life-span and temporal influence.\n", "  The creation of transuranium nuclides under pulsed neutron fluxes of\nthermonuclear explosions is investigated within the kinetic model of the\nastrophysical r process, taking into account the time dependence of the\nexternal parameters and the processes accompanying the beta decay of\nneutron-rich nuclei. Time-dependent neutron fluxes in the interval ~ 10e-6 s\nwere modeled within the framework of the developed adiabatic binary model. The\nprobabilities of beta-delayed processes were calculated on the base of the\nmicroscopic theory of finite Fermi systems. Calculations of transuranium\nnuclides yields Y(A) are made for three experimental USA thermonuclear\nexplosions \"Mike\" (YM), \"Par\" (YP) and \"Barbel\" (YB). The root-mean-square\ndeviations of the calculations compare to the experimental data (r.m.s.) are\n91% for YM, 33% for YP, 29% for YB , which are significantly lower than for\nother known calculations. The exponential approximation of the experimental\ndependences Y(A) is carried out and the obtained values of r.m.s are equal to\n56%, 86.8% and 60.2% for YM, YP and YB correspondingly, which is better or\ncomparable with other calculations. An even-odd anomaly in the observed yields\nof heavy nuclei is explained by the predominant influence of processes\naccompanying the beta decay of heavy neutron-excess isotopes.\n", "  Fabrication techniques such as laser patterning offer excellent potential for\nlow cost and large area device fabrication. Conductive polymers can be used to\nreplace expensive metallic inks such as silver and gold nanoparticles for\nprinting technology. Electrical conductivity of the polymers can be improved by\nblending with carbon nanotubes. In this work, formulations of acid\nfunctionalised multiwall carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNT) and poly\n(ethylenedioxythiophene) [PEDOT]: polystyrene sulphonate [PSS] were processed,\nand thin films were prepared on plastic substrates. Conductivity of PEDOT: PSS\nincreased almost four orders of magnitude after adding f-MWCNT. Work function\nof PEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNT films was ~ 0.5eV higher as compared to the work function\nof pure PEDOT:PSS films, determined by Kelvin probe method. Field-effect\ntransistors source-drain electrodes were prepared on PET plastic substrates\nwhere PEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNT were patterned using laser ablation at 44mJ/pulse\nenergy to define 36 micron electrode separation. Silicon nanowires were\ndeposited using dielectrophoresis alignment technique to bridge the\nPEDOT:PSS/f-MWCNT laser patterned electrodes. Finally, top-gated nanowire field\neffect transistors were completed by depositing parylene C as polymer gate\ndielectric and gold as the top-gate electrode. Transistor characteristics\nshowed p-type conduction with excellent gate electrode coupling, with an ON/OFF\nratio of ~ 200. Thereby, we demonstrate the feasibility of using high\nworkfunction, printable PEDOT:PSS/MWCNT composite inks for patterning\nsource/drain electrodes for nanowire transistors on flexible substrates.\n", "  This study examines the feasibility of the full-field ultrasonic\ncharacterization of fractures in rock. To this end, a slab-like specimen of\ngranite is subjected to in-plane, O(10$^4$Hz) excitation while monitoring the\ninduced 2D wavefield by a Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometer (SLDV) with\nsub-centimeter spatial resolution. Upon suitable filtering and interpolation,\nthe observed wavefield is verified to conform with the plane-stress\napproximation and used to: (i) compute the maps of elastic modulus in the\nspecimen (before and after fracturing) via a rudimentary application of the\nprinciple of elastography; (ii) reconstruct the fracture geometry; (iii) expose\nthe fracture's primal (traction-displacement jump) contact behavior, and (iv)\nidentify its profiles of shear and normal specific stiffness. Through the use\nof full-field ultrasonic data, the approach provides an unobscured,\nhigh-resolution insight into the fracture's contact behavior, foreshadowing\nin-depth laboratory exploration of interdependencies between the fracture\ngeometry, aperture, interphase properties, and its seismic characteristics.\n", "  A theoretical investigation is carried out to understand the basic features\nof nonlinear propagation of heavy ion-acoustic (HIA) waves subjected to an\nexternal magnetic field in an electron-positron-ion (EPI) plasma which consists\nof cold magnetized positively charged heavy ion fluids, and superthermal\ndistributed electrons and positrons. In the nonlinear regime, the Korteweg-de\nVries (K-dV) and modified K-dV(MK-dV) equations describing the propagation of\nHIA waves are derived. The latter admits a solitary wave solution with both\npositive and negative potentials (for K-dV equation) and only positive\npotential (for mK-dV equation) in the weak amplitude limit. It is observed that\nthe effects of external magnetic field (obliqueness), superthermal electrons\nand positrons, different plasma species concentration, heavy ion dynamics and\ntemperature ratio significantly modify the basic features of solitary waves\n(SWs). The application of the results in a magnetized EPI plasma, which occurs\nin many astrophysical objects (e.g., pulsars, cluster explosions, and active\ngalactic nuclei) is briefly discussed.\n", "  We study condensation of scalar fields around compact reflecting stars in a\nbox. We propose no light scalar hair behaviors that the neutral compact star\ncannot support the existence of small single positive mass scalar field in it's\nexterior spacetime for very general self-interacting potentials. Moreover, we\nfind that this no light scalar hair property can be violated by including an\nadditional Maxwell field coupled to the scalar field in a charged compact\nreflecting star background.\n", "  Surface fluorination of TiO$_2$ (F-TiO$_2$) has complicate photocatalytic\nbehavior in degradation of organic compounds. This work attempts to establish\nan elegant scenario based on the band model to understand this behavior.\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations show that fluorination of the\nrutile TiO$_2$(110) surface (F-TiO$_2$${110}$) results in the falling of band\nedges. The falling of valence band edge (VBE) facilitates production of free\n$\\cdot$OH radicals, whereas the falling of conduction band edge (CBE) lowers\nthe reducing power of photo-electrons and inhibits reductive reactions mediated\nby them. As a result, the photo-electrons are built up in the conduction band\nwhich depresses photo-holes in the valence band to produce $\\cdot$OH radicals\ndue to the requirement of electrical neutrality and thus leads to a low\ndegradation rate of organic compounds. Even though, our model suggests a route\nto improve the degradation efficiency, by introducing a scavenger of\nphoto-electrons to promote formation of $\\cdot$OH radicals.\n", "  Non-Hermitian systems with parity-time symmetry have been developed rapidly\nand hold great promise for future applications. Unlike most existing works\nconsidering the symmetry of the free energy terms (e.g., gain-loss system), in\nthis paper, we report that a realizable non-Hermitian interaction between two\nquantum resonances can also have a real spectrum after the exceptional point.\nThat phenomenon is similar with that in the gain-loss system so that the\nnon-Hermitian interaction can be an excellent substitute for quantum gain. Such\na non-Hermitian interaction can be realized in designed optomechanics, and we\nfind that its dynamics are in accordance with those of normal gain system as\nexpected. As examples, the phase transition near the exceptional point and the\ninduced chaos in weak nonlinear coupling are shown and analyzed for an\nintuitive visual. Our results provide a platform for realizing parity-time\nsymmetry devices and studying properties of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.\n", "  Red blood cells flowing through capillaries assume a wide variety of\ndifferent shapes owing to their high deformability. Predicting the realized\nshapes is a complex field as they are determined by the intricate interplay\nbetween the flow conditions and the membrane mechanics. In this work we\nconstruct the shape phase diagram of a single red blood cell with a\nphysiological viscosity ratio flowing in a microchannel. We use both\nexperimental in-vitro measurements as well as 3D numerical simulations to\ncomplement the respective other one. Numerically, we have easy control over the\ninitial starting configuration and natural access to the full 3D shape. With\nthis information we obtain the phase diagram as a function of initial position,\nstarting shape and cell velocity. Experimentally, we measure the occurrence\nfrequency of the different shapes as a function of the cell velocity to\nconstruct the experimental diagram which is in good agreement with the\nnumerical observations. Two different major shapes are found, namely croissants\nand slippers. Notably, both shapes show coexistence at low (<1 mm/s) and high\nvelocities (>3 mm/s) while in-between only croissants are stable. This\npronounced bistability indicates that RBC shapes are not only determined by\nsystem parameters such as flow velocity or channel size, but also strongly\ndepend on the initial conditions.\n", "  Dynamic cavity effect of a Topological Insulator Bi2Te3 based Passive\nQ-switched (QS) solid state laser was investigated. With a saturation intensity\nas low as a few kW, Bi2Te3 processed by hydrothermal exfoliation serves a\nsensitive saturable absorber to initiate Q-switching. Without material damage,\na transition from QS state to CW state was observed when the pumping strength\nincreases which was explained by the modulation instability spectrum of laser\nrate equation.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a scheme of a long-lived broadband superefficient\nmultiresonator quantum memory in which a common resonator is connected with an\nexternal waveguide and with a system of high-quality miniresonators containing\nlong-lived resonant electron spin ensembles. The scheme with 4 miniresonators\nhas been analyzed in details and it was shown that it is possible to store an\ninput broadband signal field to the electron spin ensembles with quantum\nefficiency 99.99%. The considered multiresonator system opens the way to\nelaboration of efficient multiqubit quantum memory devices for superconducting\nquantum computer.\n", "  Considering the fact that, a wide range of variation in masses of various\nstates of heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons can be seen in different models\nand the experimental data on masses of many of these states is not yet\ncurrently available, in this paper, we study the analytical calculation of\nheavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons mass spectra ( such as $\\eta_{c}$,\n$B_{c}$, $\\eta_{b}$, $J/\\psi$, $B^{*}_{c}$ and $\\Upsilon$) and their\ncorresponding wave functions in the framework of Bethe-Salpeter equation under\nthe covariant instantaneous ansatz. The parameters of the framework were\ndetermined by a fit to the heavy pseudoscalar and vector mesons mass spectrum\nof ground states. These input parameters so fixed were found to give good\nagreements with data on mass spectra of ground and excited states of these\nmesons mass spectra.\n", "  Van der Waals (vdW) materials, weakly bound layered compounds, have received\nenormous interest as they offer a malleable playground for a wide range of\nphysical properties in thermal, electronic and optical devices. In particular,\nowing to their inherent deep subwavelength light confinement, they support a\nvariety of light-matter interactions phenomena such as plasmons, excitons and\nphonons conveyed as polaritonic modes. Specifically, semiconductor vdW\nmaterials such as WSe_2 are particularly attractive for photonic and quantum\nintegrated technologies since they sustain VIS-NIR exciton-polariton modes at\nroom temperature. In the quest to unravel the underlying physics of these\nintriguing phenomena, advanced subdiffraction imaging techniques such as SNOM\nhas provided valuable insights on the nature of the EP coupling mechanism to\nthe waveguide modes sustained in vdW materials. While most of these works\nfocused on the steady state of the EP, the spatio-temporal dynamics of EP\nformation, happening in the sub-picosecond regime, remains largely unexplored.\nHence, a direct imaging at the femtosecond-nanoscale of the EP evolution is\ncritical to the understanding of these coupled light-matter states. Here we\nreport for the first time the ultrafast and deep-subwavelength imaging of EP\nformation and propagation in WSe2 waveguides. Our method, based on a novel\nultrafast pump-probe near-field imaging, allows to directly visualize the EP\ntime evolution at room temperature. More specifically, and in agreement with\nour time dependent model, we directly observe a significantly slow EP wave\npacket group velocity of v_g~0.017c which is attributed to the bandgap\nrenormalization originating in the light coupling near the exciton transition.\nThese findings suggest that vdW materials could be used for slow light with\napplications in light storage for memory, enhanced optical nonlinearity,\nsensing and more.\n", "  Daily operation of a large-scale experiment is a resource consuming task,\nparticularly from perspectives of routine data quality monitoring. Typically,\ndata comes from different sub-detectors and the global quality of data depends\non the combinatorial performance of each of them. In this paper, the problem of\nidentifying channels in which anomalies occurred is considered. We introduce a\ngeneric deep learning model and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the\nmodel learns to identify 'channels' which are affected by an anomaly. Such\nmodel could be used for data quality manager cross-check and assistance and\nidentifying good channels in anomalous data samples. The main novelty of the\nmethod is that the model does not require ground truth labels for each channel,\nonly global flag is used. This effectively distinguishes the model from\nclassical classification methods. Being applied to CMS data collected in the\nyear 2010, this approach proves its ability to decompose anomaly by separate\nchannels.\n", "  Drying of particle suspensions is an ubiquitous phenomenon with many natural\nand practical applications. In particular, in unidirectional drying, the\nevaporation of the solvent induces flows which accumulate particles at the\nliquid/air interface. The progressive build-up of a dense region of particles\ncan be used, in particular, in the processing of advanced materials and\narchitectures while the development of heterogeneities and defects in such\nsystems is critical to their function. A lot of attention has thus been paid to\ncorrelate the flow and particles dynamics to the ordering of particles.\nHowever, dynamic observation at the particle scale and its correlation with\nlocal particle ordering are still missing. Here we show by measuring the\nparticle velocities with high frame rate laser scanning confocal microscopy\nthat the ordering of weakly Brownian particles during directional drying in a\nHele-Shaw cell opened on one side depends on the particle velocity. Under the\nambient and experimental conditions presented in the following, the particle\nvelocities accumulate in two branches. A higher degree of ordering is found for\nthe branch of faster particle velocity which we explain by an increase in the\npressure drop which drags the particles into a denser packing as the flow\nvelocity increases. This counter-intuitive behaviour is the opposite to what is\nfound with Brownian particles, which can reorganize by Brownian motion into\ndenser packing during drying, as long as the flow velocity is not too high.\nThese results show that different kinetic conditions can be used to obtain\ndense, defect-free regions of particles after drying. In particular, it\nsuggests that rapid, directional drying could be used to control the\ncrystallinity of particle deposits.\n", "  Galaxy clusters constitute a major cosmological probe. However, Planck 2015\nresults have shown a weak tension between CMB-derived and cluster-derived\ncosmological parameters. This tension might be due to poor knowledge of the\ncluster mass and observable relationship.\n  As for now, arcmin resolution Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations ({\\it e.g.}\nSPT, ACT and Planck) only allowed detailed studies of the intra cluster medium\nfor low redshift clusters ($z<0.2$). For high redshift clusters ($z>0.5$) high\nresolution and high sensitivity SZ observations are needed. With both a wide\nfield of view (6.5 arcmin) and a high angular resolution (17.7 and 11.2 arcsec\nat 150 and 260 GHz), the NIKA2 camera installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope\n(Pico Veleta, Spain) is particularly well adapted for these observations. The\nNIKA2 SZ observation program will map a large sample of clusters (50) at\nredshifts between 0.5 and 0.9. As a pilot study for NIKA2, several clusters of\ngalaxies have been observed with the pathfinder, NIKA, at the IRAM 30-m\ntelescope to cover the various configurations and observation conditions\nexpected for NIKA2.}\n", "  The generic cosmological solution is analyzed both for the non-asymptotic\nlimit to the cosmological singularity and in the asymptotic limit analytically.\nThe Bianchi I solution and the Bianchi IX solution, described as a sequence of\nBianchi I reparameterized solutions, are analyzed with respect to the\nasymptotic symmetry implied by the space part of the metric tensor. Numerical\nstudies are explained. The semiclassical regime is proposed by using the\ndegrees of freedom for the initial conditions to the Einstein field equations,\ni.e. those which are not necessarily characterizing for a Bianchi scheme. The\nappropriate homegeneization techniques and the de-homogenization techniques\nreferred to a generic system of PDE's are discussed and applied to the affine\n(Misner) space containing the dynamics pertinent to the Hamiltonian problem\nassociated to the solution of the Hamiltonian constraint. The asymptotic limit\nto the cosmological singularity for the generic cosmological solution is\nimplemented within the asymptotic Kasner parametrization of the BKL approach\nand for the Misner-Chitre formalism. The EFE in the Misner-Chitre approach\nimply constraints on the non-asymptotical degrees of freedom, which allow one\nto define classes of solutions on the anisotropy plane.\n", "  When plasmonic nanoparticles are coupled with semiconductors, highly\nenergetic hot carriers can be extracted from the metal-semiconductor interface\nfor various applications in light energy conversion. Hot charge-carrier\nextraction upon plasmon decay using such an interface has been argued to occur\nafter the formation of an intermediate electron population with a uniform\nmomentum distribution. The efficiency of the charge separation process is thus\ndiscussed to be limited by this spatial homogeneity in certain plasmon-induced\napplications. Here we demonstrate using visible pump, near-infrared probe\ntransient absorption spectroscopy that increases in the contact area between\nmetal and semiconductor leads to an increase in the quantum yield for hot\nelectron injection that is inconsistent with the homogeneous energy-momentum\ndistribution of hot-electrons. Instead, further analysis of the experimental\ndata suggests that the highly energetic electrons are emitted across the\ninterface via a surface charge emission mechanism that occurs via a plasmon\nexcitation\n", "  The paper discusses the peculiarities of flame propagation in the ultra-lean\nhydrogen-air mixture. Numerical analysis of the problem shows the possibility\nof the stable self-sustained flame ball existence in unconfined space on\nsufficiently large spatial scales. The structure of the flame ball is\ndetermined by the convection processes related to the hot products rising in\nthe terrestrial gravity field. It is shown that the structure of the flame ball\ncorresponds to the axisymmetric structures of the gaseous bubble in the liquid.\nIn addition to the stable flame core, there are satellite burning kernels\nseparated from the original flameball and developing inside the thermal wake\nbehind the propagating flame ball. The effective area of burning expands with\ntime due to flame ball and satellite kernels development. Both stable flame\nball existence in the ultra-lean mixture and increase in the burning area\nindicate the possibility of transition to rapid deflagrative combustion as soon\nas the flame ball enters the region filled with hydrogen-air mixture of the\nricher composition. Such a scenario is intrinsic to the natural spatial\ndistribution of hydrogen in the conditions of terrestrial gravity and therefore\nit is crucial to take it into account in elaborating risk assessments\ntechniques and prevention measures.\n", "  A continuing challenge in material science is how to create active materials\nin which shape changes or displacements can be generated electrically or\nthermally. Here we borrow principles from hydraulics, in particular that\nconfined geometries can be used to focus expansion into large displacements, to\ncreate solid materials with amplified shape changes. Specifically, we confined\nan elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) sheet between two more rigid layers and\ncaused focused expansion into embossed channels by local resistive heating,\nresulting in a 10x greater relative displacement than the unconfined geometry.\nWe used this effect to create electrically controlled microfluidic valves that\nopen and close in less than 100 ms, can cycle >10,000 times, and operate with\nas little as 20 mW of power. We investigate this mechanism and establish design\nrules by varying dimensions, configurations, and materials. We show the\ngenerality of elastomeric focusing by creating additional devices where local\nheating and expansion are generated either wirelessly through inductive\ncoupling or optically with a laser, allowing arbitrary and dynamic positioning\nof a microfluidic valve along the channels.\n", "  Based on operators borrowed from scattering theory, several concrete\nrealizations of index theorems are proposed. The corresponding operators belong\nto some C*-algebras of pseudo-differential operators with coefficients which\neither have limits at plus and minus infinity, or which are periodic or\nasymptotically periodic, or which are uniformly almost periodic. These various\nsituations can be deduced from a single partial isometry which depends on\nseveral parameters. All computations are explicitly performed.\n", "  Dual energy computed tomography (DECT) has become of particular interest in\nclinic recent years. The DECT scan comprises two images, corresponding to two\nphoton attenuation coefficients maps of the objects. Meanwhile, the DECT images\nare less accessible sometimes, compared to the conventional single energy CT\n(SECT). This motivates us to simulate pseudo DECT (pDECT) images from the SECT\nimages. Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we present a deep\nlearning based framework to yield pDECT images from SECT images, utilizing the\nintrinsic characteristics underlying DECT images, i.e., global correlation and\nhigh similarity. To demonstrate the performance of the deep learning based\nframework, a cascade deep ConvNet (CD-ConvNet) approach is specifically\npresented in the deep learning framework. In the training step, the CD-ConvNet\nis designed to learn the non-linear mapping from the measured energy-specific\n(i.e., low-energy) CT images to the desired energy-specific (i.e., high-energy)\nCT images. In the testing step, the trained CD-ConvNet can be used to yield\ndesired high-energy CT images from the low-energy CT images, and then produce\naccurate basic material maps. Clinical patient data were employed to validate\nand evaluate the presented CD-ConvNet approach performance. Both visual and\nquantitative results demonstrate the presented CD-ConvNet approach can yield\nhigh quality pDECT images and basic material maps.\n", "  In this work, we report X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and valence band (VB)\nspectroscopy measurements of surfactant-free silver nanoparticles and\nsilver/linear carbon chains (Ag@LCC) structures prepared by pulse laser\nablation (PLA) in water. Our measurements demonstrate significant oxidation\nonly on the surfaces of the silver nanoparticles with many covalent\ncarbon-silver bonds but only negligible traces of carbon-oxygen bonds.\nTheoretical modeling also provides evidence of the formation of robust\ncarbon-silver bonds between linear carbon chains and pure and partially\noxidized silver surfaces. A comparison of theoretical and experimental\nelectronic structures also provides evidence of the presence of non-oxidized\nlinear carbon chains on silver surfaces. To evaluate the chemical stability, we\ninvestigated the energetics of the physical adsorption of oxidative species\n(water and oxygen) and found that this adsorption is much preferrable on\noxidized or pristine silver surfaces than the adsorption of linear carbon\nchains, which makes the initial step in the oxidation of LCC energetically\nunfavorable.\n", "  We demonstrate a mechanochemical approach to fabrication of a bidirectional\nsurface on a doped silicon wafer. In the initial step of our fabrication\nprocedure, a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) stylus is pressed and drawn on\nthe Si surface. This rubbing action provides a mechanochemical treatment of the\nSi surface, which unexpectedly alters the etching direction in the subsequent\nmetal-assisted chemical etching step. Hence, Si nanowires of two different\norientations can be patterned conveniently by a rub-write step. The mechanism\nof bidirectional Si nanowire formation is investigated. This anisotropy is\nexploited to propel water droplets on a fluidic track.\n", "  Cylindrical vector vortex (CVV) beams, complex light fields that exhibit a\nvector nature and carry quantized orbital angular momentum states, have been\nwidely investigated due to their rich applications. Current technologies to\ngenerate CVV beams using individual polarization and spatial phase\nmanipulations suffer from bulky size and low configurability. In this work, we\npropose and experimentally demonstrate an approach to generate CVV beams with\nan integrated device based on silicon nitride microring resonator and embedded\ntop-gratings. The device is capable of generating broad-band radially and\nazimuthally polarized vortex beams by simply switching the polarization and\nwavelength of the excited whispering-gallery-modes. In addition, we develop a\nmethod to fabricate the devices of shallow-etched top-gratings with only\none-step etching. This novel method provides new capabilities to develop\non-chip integrated devices with great ease and flexibility.\n", "  We report the proximity induced anomalous transport behavior in a Nb\nBi1.95Sb0.05Se3 heterostructure. Mechanically Exfoliated single crystal of\nBi1.95Sb0.05Se3 topological insulator (TI) is partially covered with a 100 nm\nthick Niobium superconductor using DC magnetron sputtering by shadow masking\ntechnique. The magnetotransport (MR) measurements have been performed\nsimultaneously on the TI sample with and without Nb top layer in the\ntemperature,T, range of 3 to 8 K, and a magnetic field B up to 15 T. MR on TI\nregion shows Subnikov de Haas oscillation at fields greater than 5 T. Anomalous\nlinear change in resistance is observed in the field range of negative 4T to\npositive 4T at which Nb is superconducting. At 0 T field, the temperature\ndependence of resistance on the Nb covered region revealed a superconducting\ntransition (TC) at 8.2 K, whereas TI area showed similar TC with the absence of\nzero resistance states due to the additional resistance from superconductor\n(SC) TI interface. Interestingly below the TC the R vs T measured on TI showed\nan enhancement in resistance for positive field and prominent fall in\nresistance for negative field direction. This indicates the directional\ndependent scattering of the Cooper pairs on the surface of the TI due to the\nsuperposition of spin singlet and triplet states in the superconductor and TI\nrespectively.\n", "  The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has been widely utilized to\nstudy thermal transport in materials within the relaxation time approximation\n(RTA). However, the RTA limits the study to materials for which this mean field\nscattering assumption is a valid approximation, preventing the study of a wider\nclass of materials, including graphene and diamond. Here we develop a Green's\nfunction solution of the linearized BTE for an arbitrary distribution of heat\nsources in an unbounded medium, which includes the full scattering matrix, and\nprovide an analytical expression for the temperature distribution. We provide a\ncondition on the scattering matrix to satisfy energy conservation simply in\nterms of the phonon frequencies, group velocities, and mode specific heat. We\nprovide numerical calculations for graphene for the particular geometry of a\nspatially sinusoidal heating profile to highlight the importance of using the\nfull scattering matrix compared to the RTA.\n", "  Expanding the use of physical degrees of freedom to employ spatial\nmultiplexing of data in optical communication is considered the most disruptive\nand effective solution to meet the capacity demand of the growing information\ntraffic. Development of space-division-multiplexing methods stimulated research\non spatial modulation, detection and processing of data, attracting interest\nfrom various fields of science. A passive all-dielectric metasurface with\nnear-unity transmission is used to engineer spatial mode profiles, potentially\nof arbitrary complexity. The broadband response of the metasurface covers S, C,\nand L bands of fibre communications. Unlike conventional phase plates, the\nmetasurface allows for both phase and polarization conversion, providing full\nflexibility for mode engineering. We employ the metasurface for both mode\nmodulation and mode multiplexing in free-space optical communication, and\ndemonstrate that it is capable of mode multiplexing with an extinction ratio in\nexcess of 20 dB over the whole C-band with negligible penalty even for 100 Gb/s\nDP-QPSK signals. These results merge two seemingly different fields, optical\ncommunication and metamaterials, and suggest a novel approach for ultimate\nminiaturisation of mode multiplexers and advanced LiFi technologies.\n", "  To shed more light on the nature of the observed Ly{\\alpha} absorption during\ntransits of HD 209458b and to quantify the major mechanisms responsible for the\nproduction of fast hydrogen atoms (the so called energetic neutral atoms, ENAs)\naround the planet, 2D hydrodynamic multifluid modeling of the expanding\nplanetary upper atmosphere, which is driven by stellar XUV, and its interaction\nwith the stellar wind has been performed. The model selfconsistently describes\nthe escaping planetary wind, taking into account the generation of ENAs due to\nparticle acceleration by the radiation pressure and by the charge exchange\nbetween the stellar wind protons and planetary atoms. The calculations in a\nwide range of stellar wind parameters and XUV flux values showed that under\ntypical Sun-like star conditions, the amount of generated ENAs is too small,\nand the observed absorption at the level of 6-8 percent can be attributed only\nto the non-resonant natural line broadening. For lower XUV fluxes, e.g., during\nthe activity minima, the number of planetary atoms that survive photoionization\nand give rise to ENAs increases, resulting in up to 10-15 percent absorption at\nthe blue wing of the Lya line, caused by resonant thermal line broadening. A\nsimilar asymmetric absorption can be seen under the conditions realized during\ncoronal mass ejections, when sufficiently high stellar wind pressure confines\nthe escaping planetary material within a kind of bowshock around the planet. It\nwas found that the radiation pressure in all considered cases has a negligible\ncontribution to the production of ENAs and the corresponding absorption.\n", "  We describe a compact THz-pump and X-ray-probe beamline, based on an electron\nlinac, for ultrafast time-resolved diffraction applications. Two high-energy\nelectron ($\\gamma>50$) bunches, $5~$ns apart, impinge upon a single-foil or a\nmultifoil radiator and generate THz radiation and X-rays simultaneously. The\nTHz pulse from the first bunch is synchronized to the X-ray beam of the second\nbunch by using an adjustable optical delay of THz pulse. The peak power of THz\nradiation from the multifoil radiator is estimated to be $0.14~$GW for a\n$200~$pC well-optimized electron bunch. GEANT4 simulations show a carbon foil\nwith thickness of $0.5~-~1.0~$mm has the highest yield of $10~-~20~$keV hard\nX-rays for a $25~$MeV beam, which is approximately $10^3$ photons/(keV\npC-electrons) within a few degrees of the polar angle. A carbon multifoil\nradiator with $35$ foils ($25~$$\\mu m~$thick each) can generate close to $10^3$\nhard X-rays/(keV pC-electrons) within a $2^\\circ$ acceptance angle. With\n$200~$pC charge and $100~$Hz repetition rate, we can generate $10^7$ X-rays per\n$1~$keV energy bin per second or $10^5$ X-rays per $1~$keV energy bin per\npulse. The longitudinal time profile of X-ray pulse ranges from $400~-~600~$fs\ndepending on the acceptance angle. The broadening of the time duration of X-ray\npulse is observed owing to its diverging effect. A double-crystal monochromator\n(DCM) will be used to select and transport the desired X-rays to the sample.\nThe heating of the radiators by an electron beam is negligible because of the\nlow beam current.\n", "  We report the results of GIXRR, UV-VIS NIR and XPS measurements on Si and Ge\nthin films of various thicknesses. While GIXRR measurements show no presence of\noxide on the top of these films, XPS measurements show small amount of oxides.\nAlso, a sharp increase in surface roughness is seen with thickness in agreement\nwith the columnar growth of films. In contrast, in case of Si films, oxide is\npresent even inside the layers but in a very small amount and is not detected\nin GIXRR/absorption measurements.\n", "  We report here a quantitative method of Transmission Electron Microscopy\n(TEM) to measure the shapes, sizes and volumes of nanoparticles which are\nresponsible for their properties. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) acting as\nnucleating agents for the electroless deposition of silver NPs on SU-8 polymers\nwere analyzed in this project. The atomic-number contrast (Z-contrast) imaging\ntechnique reveals the height and effective diameter of each Au NP and a volume\ndistribution is obtained. Varying the reducing agents produced Au NPs of\ndifferent sizes which were found both on the polymer surface and in some cases\nburied several nanometers below the surface. The morphology of Au NPs is an\nimportant factor for systems that use surface-bound nanoparticles as nucleation\nsites as in electroless metallization. Electrolessly deposited silver layers\nreduced by hydroquinone on SU-8 polymer are analyzed in this project.\n", "  Predicting when rupture occurs or cracks progress is a major challenge in\nnumerous elds of industrial, societal and geophysical importance. It remains\nlargely unsolved: Stress enhancement at cracks and defects, indeed, makes the\nmacroscale dynamics extremely sensitive to the microscale material disorder.\nThis results in giant statistical uctuations and non-trivial behaviors upon\nupscaling dicult to assess via the continuum approaches of engineering. These\nissues are examined here. We will see: How linear elastic fracture mechanics\nsidetracks the diculty by reducing the problem to that of the propagation of a\nsingle crack in an eective material free of defects, How slow cracks sometimes\ndisplay jerky dynamics, with sudden violent events incompatible with the\nprevious approach, and how some paradigms of statistical physics can explain\nit, How abnormally fast cracks sometimes emerge due to the formation of\nmicrocracks at very small scales.\n", "  The Luttinger-Ward functional was proposed more than five decades ago to\nprovide a link between static and dynamic quantities in a quantum many-body\nsystem. Despite its widespread usage, the derivation of the Luttinger-Ward\nfunctional remains valid only in the formal sense, and even the very existence\nof this functional has been challenged by recent numerical evidence. In a\nsimpler and yet highly relevant regime, namely the Euclidean lattice field\ntheory, we rigorously prove that the Luttinger-Ward functional is a\nwell-defined universal functional over all physical Green's functions. Using\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional, the free energy can be variationally minimized\nwith respect to Green's functions in its domain. We then derive the widely used\nbold diagrammatic expansion rigorously, without relying on formal arguments\nsuch as partial resummation of bare diagrams to infinite order.\n", "  The initial mass function (IMF) is a key ingredient in many studies of galaxy\nformation and evolution. Although the IMF is often assumed to be universal,\nthere is continuing evidence that it is not universal. Spectroscopic studies\nthat derive the IMF of the unresolved stellar populations of a galaxy often\nassume that this spectrum can be described by a single stellar population\n(SSP). To alleviate these limitations, in this paper we have developed a unique\nhierarchical Bayesian framework for modelling composite stellar populations\n(CSPs). Within this framework we use a parameterized IMF prior to regulate a\ndirect inference of the IMF. We use this new framework to determine the number\nof SSPs that is required to fit a set of realistic CSP mock spectra. The CSP\nmock spectra that we use are based on semi-analytic models and have an IMF that\nvaries as a function of stellar velocity dispersion of the galaxy. Our results\nsuggest that using a single SSP biases the determination of the IMF slope to a\nhigher value than the true slope, although the trend with stellar velocity\ndispersion is overall recovered. If we include more SSPs in the fit, the\nBayesian evidence increases significantly and the inferred IMF slopes of our\nmock spectra converge, within the errors, to their true values. Most of the\nbias is already removed by using two SSPs instead of one. We show that we can\nreconstruct the variable IMF of our mock spectra for signal-to-noise ratios\nexceeding $\\sim$75.\n", "  The electromagnetic instabilities excited by the temperature anisotropy have\nbeen always one of the interesting issues in real high-density physical\nsystems, where the relativistic and quantum effects due to spin can be\nimportant. This paper discusses the case where plasma is not strongly coupled\nbut is still in regimes where a classic plasma description is not fully\nadequate. The length scale of the plasma can be larger than the de-Broglie\nlength so that the quantum effects relevance to the spin can be significant. In\naddition, the only relativistic effects are due to the electrons spin, for\nexample the spin-orbit coupling effect (the weak (semi) relativistic effects).\nObtained results imply that these effects can not be important in the ICF\nsubjects while these can lead to significant results in the astrophysical\nsubjects because of the strong magnetic fields. It is found that the weakly\nrelativistic effects can cover the magnetic dipole force and the spin\nprecession effects so that the growth rate of the instability can increase\ncompared to the non relativistic spin polarized cases. Indeed, it is expected\nthat the probability of electron capture in the background magnetic fields and\nthe particle energy dissipation will be reduced so that there will be a high\nportion of free energy in the system.\n", "  The electronic transport properties of the delafossite oxides ABO$_2$ are\nusually understood in terms of two well separated entities, namely, the\ntriangular A$^+$ and (BO$_2$)$^-$ layers. Here we review several cases among\nthis extensive family of materials where the transport depends on the\ninterlayer coupling and displays unconventional properties. We review the doped\nthermoelectrics based on CuRhO$_2$ and CuCrO$_2$, which show a high-temperature\nrecovery of Fermi-liquid transport exponents, as well as the highly anisotropic\nmetals PdCoO$_2$, PtCoO$_2$ and PdCrO$_2$ where the sheer simplicity of the\nFermi surface leads to unconventional transport. We present some of the\ntheoretical tools that have been used to investigate these transport properties\nand review what can and cannot be learned from the extensive set of electronic\nstructure calculations that have been performed.\n", "  This review summarises results of recent magnetic and chemical abundance\nsurface mapping studies of early-type stars. We discuss main trends uncovered\nby observational investigations and consider reliability of spectropolarimetric\ninversion techniques used to infer these results. A critical assessment of\ntheoretical attempts to interpret empirical magnetic and chemical maps in the\nframework of, respectively, the fossil field and atomic diffusion theories is\nalso presented. This confrontation of theory and observations demonstrates that\n3D MHD models of fossil field relaxation are successful in matching the\nobserved range of surface magnetic field geometries. At the same time, even the\nmost recent time-dependent atomic diffusion calculations fail to reproduce\ndiverse horizontal abundance distributions found in real magnetic hot stars.\n", "  Presently, one of the most ambitious technological goals is the development\nof devices working under the laws of quantum mechanics. One prominent target is\nthe quantum computer, which would allow the processing of information at\nquantum level for purposes not achievable with even the most powerful computer\nresources. The large-scale implementation of quantum information would be a\ngame changer for current technology, because it would allow unprecedented\nparallelised computation and secure encryption based on the principles of\nquantum superposition and entanglement. Currently, there are several physical\nplatforms racing to achieve the level of performance required for the quantum\nhardware to step into the realm of practical quantum information applications.\nSeveral materials have been proposed to fulfil this task, ranging from quantum\ndots, Bose-Einstein condensates, spin impurities, superconducting circuits,\nmolecules, amongst others. Magnetic molecules are among the list of promising\nbuilding blocks, due to (i) their intrinsic monodispersity, (ii) discrete\nenergy levels (iii) the possibility of chemical quantum state engineering, and\n(iv) their multilevel characteristics, leading to the so called Qudits (d > 2),\namongst others. Herein we review how a molecular multilevel nuclear spin qubit\n(or qudit, where d = 4), known as TbPc2, gathers all the necessary requirements\nto perform as a molecular hardware platform with a first generation of\nmolecular devices enabling even quantum algorithm operations.\n", "  The multiplicity dependence of charmed-particle production can unveil new\ninformation on processes taking part at the parton level and on the interplay\nof soft and hard production mechanisms in collisions of relativistic hadrons.\nIn this contribution, we report on multiplicity-differential measurements of\n$\\rm{J}/\\psi$ in pp and p-Pb collisions studied by the ALICE Collaboration.\nComparisons between measurements at different energies are drawn as well as\ncomparisons with $\\rm{D}$ mesons. We also discuss the comparison with different\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  Photothermal therapies are based on the optical excitation of plasmonic\nnanoparticles in the biological environment. The effects of the irradiation on\nthe biological medium depend critically on the heat transfer process at the\nnanoparticle interface, on the temperature reached by the tissues as well as on\nthe spatial extent of temperature gradients. Unfortunately, both the\ntemperature and its biological effects are difficult to be probed\nexperimentally at the molecular scale. Here, we approach this problem using\nnonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on photoporation, a\nphotothermal application based on the irradiation of gold nanoparticles by\nsingle, short-duration laser pulses. The nanoparticles, stably bound to cell\nmembranes, convert the radiation into heat, inducing transient changes of\nmembrane permeability. We make a quantitative prediction of the temperature\ngradient around the nanoparticle upon irradiation by typical experimental laser\nfluences. Water permeability is locally enhanced around the NP, in an annular\nregion that extends only a few nm far from the nanoparticle interface. We\ncorrelate the local enhancement of permeability at the NP-lipid interface to\nthe temperature inhomogeneities of the membrane and to the consequent\navailability of free volume pockets within the membrane core.\n", "  We have developed a Watt-level single-frequency tunable fiber laser in the\n915-937 nm spectral window. The laser is based on a neodymium-doped fiber\nmaster oscillator power amplifier architecture, with two amplification stages\nusing a 20 mW extended cavity diode laser as seed. The system output power is\nhigher than 2 W from 921 to 933 nm, with a stability better than 1.4 percent\nand a low relative intensity noise.\n", "  Silicon represents a common intrinsic impurity in graphene, commonly bonding\nto either three or four carbon neighbors respectively in a single or double\ncarbon vacancy. We investigate the effect of the latter defect (Si-C$_4$) on\nthe structural and electronic properties of graphene using density functional\ntheory (DFT). Calculations based both on molecular models and with periodic\nboundary conditions have been performed. The two-carbon vacancy was constructed\nfrom pyrene (pyrene-2C) which was then expanded to circumpyrene-2C. The\nstructural characterization of these cases revealed that the ground state is\nslightly non-planar, with the bonding carbons displaced from the plane by up to\n$\\pm$0.2 {\\AA}. This non-planar structure was confirmed by embedding the defect\ninto a 10$\\times$8 supercell of graphene, resulting in 0.22 eV lower energy\nthan the previously considered planar structure. Natural bond orbital (NBO)\nanalysis showed sp$^3$ hybridization at the silicon atom for the non-planar\nstructure and sp$^2$d hybridization for the planar structure. Atomically\nresolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and corresponding spectrum\nsimulations provide a mixed picture: a flat structure provides a slightly\nbetter overall spectrum match, but a small observed pre-peak is only present in\nthe corrugated simulation. Considering the small energy barrier between the two\nequivalent corrugated conformations, both structures could plausibly exist as a\nsuperposition over the experimental timescale of seconds.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab will search for the coherent $\\mu \\to e$\nconversion on aluminum atoms. The detector system consists of a straw tube\ntracker and a crystal calorimeter. A pre-production of 150 Silicon\nPhotomultiplier arrays for the Mu2e calorimeter has been procured. A detailed\nquality assur- ance has been carried out on each SiPM for the determination of\nits own operation voltage, gain, dark current and PDE. The measurement of the\nmean-time-to-failure for a small random sample of the pro-production group has\nbeen also completed as well as the determination of the dark current increase\nas a function of the ioninizing and non-ioninizing dose.\n", "  In this paper, new boundary differential equations for the two-dimensional\nexterior scattering problem have been derived. It has been shown that the\nHelmholtz equation can be reduced to an inhomogeneous Bessel's equation in a\nbody-fitted coordinate system. By imposing the Sommerfeld radiation condition\nto the general solution of the Bessel's equation, an integro-differential\nequation, which is equivalent to the original Helmholtz equation, can be\nobtained. The boundary differential equation can then be established by use of\nthe integration by parts to get rid of the integral in the integro-differential\nequation for high frequency problems. Numerical examples have been presented to\ndemonstrate the validity of the new boundary differential equations.\n", "  Anomalous thermal expansion behaviour of several open frame-work compounds\nhas been extensively investigated using the techniques of inelastic neutron\nscattering and lattice dynamics. These compounds involve increasing level of\nstructural complexity and flexibility, which leads to increased values of\nthermal expansion coefficients approaching colossal values. In several\ncompounds, neutron inelastic scattering experiments have produced quantitative\nestimates of the anharmonicity of phonons over a range of low energies, and\nthereby explained the observed thermal expansion quantitatively. The\nanharmonicity is found to be an order of magnitude larger than that in usual\nmaterials. Lattice dynamical calculations have correctly predicted the observed\nanharmonicity in the neutron experiments and revealed the overall nature of\nphonons involved. In compounds showing negative thermal expansion, the phonons\nresponsible have rather low energies up to 10 meV. In most compounds, the\nanharmonic phonons span all over the Brillouin zone, while in some cases the\nspecific phonons are limited to certain wave-vectors. The nature of specific\nphonons responsible for anomalous behavior is found to be different in all\nthese compounds. These phonons generally involve transverse vibrations,\nlibrations and internal distortions of the polyhedral units. The paper reviews\nrecent advances in the understanding of anomalous thermal expansion behaviour.\n", "  We present a summary of possible signals of the chiral symmetry restoration\nand deconfinement phase transitions which may be, respectively, probed at the\ncenter of mass collision energies at 4.3-4.9 GeV and above 8.7-9.2 GeV. It is\nargued that these signals may evidence for an existence of the tricritical\nendpoint of QCD phase diagram at the collision energy around 8.7-9.2 GeV. The\nequation of state of hadronic matter with the restored chiral symmetry is\ndiscussed and the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is found.\n", "  We propose an experimentally friendly scheme for trapping quasi- relativistic\nelec- trons in graphene by an electromagnetic beam with circular polarization\nand spatially inhomogeneous profile with an intensity dip. The trapping is\nachieved due to the ef- fect of bandgap opening outside the trapping region.\nThe proposed mechanism allows for non- invasive electron confinement in\ngraphene without any need of the chemical patterning of the sample or the\napplication of metallic gates.\n", "  A search for the production of a Higgs boson in association with a single top\nquark (tH) is performed using the decay $\\text{H} \\to \\text{b}\\bar{\\text{b}}$.\nThis Higgs boson production mode is sensitive to the coupling modifiers of the\nHiggs boson to top quarks ($\\kappa_{\\text{t}}$) and to weak gauge bosons\n($\\kappa_{\\text{V}}$) and thus can be used to lift the degeneracy regarding the\nsign of the top quark Yukawa coupling. The 2015 pp collisions data at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are analyzed. Boosted decision trees are used\nto reconstruct and classify the events. Upper limits on the tH production cross\nsection are determined at 51 different points in the $\\kappa_{\\text{t}} -\n\\kappa_{\\text{V}}$ plane.\n", "  We report on the phonon spectrum probed at the $\\beta$--FeSe(001) surface by\nmeans of high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS). Single\ncrystals of $\\beta$--FeSe are cleaved under ultra-high vacuum conditions and\nare subsequently measured below and above the nematic transition temperature.\nIn total we observe five phonon modes and a phonon cutoff energy of about 40\nmeV. We identify the origin of each phonon mode based on the selection rules of\nHREELS and by comparing the experimental results to the ones of \\emph{ab\ninitio} density functional calculations. The most prominent phonon modes\n$A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $A_{2u}$ appear at energies of about $20.5$ and $25.6$\nand $40$ meV, respectively. These phonon modes disperse rather weakly while\nchanging the momentum from zero up to the zone boundary, indicating that they\nare mainly of optical nature. A comparison between our results and the results\nof \\emph{ab initio} calculations indicates that there must be a mutual\ninterplay between magnetism and lattice dynamics in this compound, similar to\nthe other Fe-based superconductors. Finally, we comment on the role of\ntemperature on the phonon modes probed at the $\\bar{\\Gamma}$--point. It is\nobserved that both the $B_{1g}$ and $A_{2u}$ phonon modes undergo a downward\nshift while increasing the temperature from 15 to 300 K. In the case of the\n$A_{2u}$ mode this shift is about 1.5 meV.\n", "  Quantum correlations between two free spinless dissipative distinguishable\nparticles (interacting with a thermal bath) are studied analytically using the\nquantum master equation and tools of quantum information. Bath-induced\ncoherence and correlations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space are shown.\nWe show that for temperature T > 0 the time-evolution of the reduced density\nmatrix cannot be written as the direct product of two independent particles. We\nhave found a time-scale that characterizes the time when the bath-induced\ncoherence is maximum before being wiped out by dissipation (purity, relative\nentropy, spatial dispersion, and mirror correlations are studied). The Wigner\nfunction associated to the Wannier lattice (where the dissipative quantum walks\nmove) is studied as an indirect measure of the induced correlations among\nparticles. We have supported the quantum character of the correlations by\nanalyzing the geometric quantum discord.\n", "  Entropy concept was introduced by Clausius 160 years ago, and has been\ncontinually enriched, developed and interpreted by the researchers in many\ndifferent scientific disciplines ever since. Thermodynamics and other\nscientific disciplines face several simple but crucial questions concerning the\nentropy concept. Thus, it is frequently possible to notice a misuse of entropy.\nSometimes unbelievable confusion in the literature is summarized by von\nNeumann's sentence: \"No one knows what entropy really is.\" Four major questions\nstand before thermodynamics. (1) How many kinds of entropy are there? (2) What\nis the physical meaning of entropy? (3) Is entropy a subjective or an objective\nproperty? (4) Is entropy in any way related to information? This paper attempts\nto describe the roots, the conceptual history of this important concept and to\ndescribe the path of its development and application in different scientific\ndisciplines. Through this we attempt to give some possible answers to the\nquestions mentioned above.\n", "  Several types of sensors have been available in off-the-shelf mobile devices,\nincluding motion, magnetic, vision, acoustic, and location sensors. This paper\nfocuses on the fusion of the data acquired from motion and magnetic sensors,\ni.e., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors, for the recognition of\nActivities of Daily Living (ADL) using pattern recognition techniques. The\nsystem developed in this study includes data acquisition, data processing, data\nfusion, and artificial intelligence methods. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\nare included in artificial intelligence methods, which are used in this study\nfor the recognition of ADL. The purpose of this study is the creation of a new\nmethod using ANN for the identification of ADL, comparing three types of ANN,\nin order to achieve results with a reliable accuracy. The best accuracy was\nobtained with Deep Learning, which, after the application of the L2\nregularization and normalization techniques on the sensors data, reports an\naccuracy of 89.51%.\n", "  As water shortages intensify globally under the stresses of increasing\ndemand, aquifer depletion, and climate change, the market for efficient\ndesalination technologies has grown rapidly to fill the void. One such\ndeveloping technology, membrane distillation (MD), has experienced keen\nacademic interest and an increase in start-up businesses in the past decade. MD\nhas expanded into a niche of small scale thermal desalination using solar and\nwaste heat resources, due to its fouling resistance, scalability, and\nacceptable efficiency. Recent studies indicate that MD could attain the\nefficiencies of state-of-the-art mature thermal desalination technologies,\nalthough additional engineering and scientific challenges must first be\novercome.\n  The aim of this research is to better understand and provide solutions for\ntwo major challenge areas for MD: efficiency and membrane fouling. Studies on\nimproving MD efficiency included examining the effects of tilt angle on MD\nperformance using numerical simulations paired with experiments, devising a\nnovel MD system design for with superhydrophobic surfaces to improved\nefficiencies, and an entropy-generation comparison of MD to other desalination\ntechnologies. For fouling studies in MD, a review of MD fouling was undertaken\nto synthesize conclusions from the literature and to explore gaps in the\nliterature. This review lead to studies of the effect of filtration and bulk\nnucleation on MD fouling, a study on heterogeneous nucleation of inorganic\nsalts with a fouling regime map to avoid nucleation, and fouling prevention via\ninduced air-layers.\n", "  Among the many outreach and communication tools available in our digital era,\ntraditional tools such as exhibitions still hold an important place. The ALICE\ncollaboration is setting up a new exhibition at the experiment's site, as part\nof the ALICE Visitor Centre. Its goal is to communicate to visitors the physics\nand the tools and methods used by ALICE. It combines modern technology such as\nvideo mapping with real detector items, aiming to fascinate the visitors and\ngive them an immersive experience of a high energy physics experiment. The\ndevelopment process, the messages to be delivered and the choices for the\ncontents and the way of exhibiting them are discussed; and the final design and\npresent status of the project are presented.\n", "  It is shown how the geometrical splitting of N-point Feynman diagrams can be\nused to simplify the parametric integrals and reduce the number of variables in\nthe occurring functions. As an example, a calculation of the\ndimensionally-regulated one-loop four-point function in general kinematics is\npresented.\n", "  It is well known that due to its divergence at large impact parameters, the\nBoltzmann collision integral in the kinetic equation for 3D systems of\nparticles interacting through a $1/r$ potential must be replaced by a\nBalescu-Lenard-like collision term. However, the latter diverges at small\nimpact parameters. This comes from the fact that only weak interactions are\nconsidered while strong collisions between close particles are neglected in its\nderivation. We show that a solution to this dilemma exists in the framework of\nthe BBGKY formulation of statistical mechanics. It is based on a separate\ntreatment of the contribution of the strong interactions from that of the weak\ninteractions. The strong interaction part leads to a new term that involves a\nfractional Laplacian operator in velocity space while the weak interaction\ncomponent yields the Balescu-Lenard collision term with an explained lower\ncut-off at the Landau length. For spatially uniform initial conditions, the\nfractional Laplacian contribution leads to a long-tailed velocity distribution\nas long as the spatial inhomogeneity remains small. We present results from\nmolecular dynamics simulations confirming the existence of such long tails.\n", "  The effect of the primeval sources of radiation and particles on the\nthermodynamical state of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of\nReionisation is still unclear. In this work, we explore the contribution of\nelectrons accelerated in the jets of high-redshift microquasars to heating and\nionising the intergalactic medium. We develop Monte Carlo simulations of the\npropagation and energy deposition of these electrons as they travel away from\ntheir sources. We find that microquasars contribute significantly to heating\nthe intergalactic medium and are effective ionisers only near the galaxies.\nTheir effect on heating is of the same order of magnitude than that of CRs from\nSNe.\n", "  We propose a noisy quantum analogue of the well known Stuart--Landau equation\nfor weakly nonlinear oscillators. Surprisingly, we find the oscillator's\namplitude to be amplified by the very same noise responsible for its stochastic\ndynamics. This has interesting implications for the theory of linear amplifiers\nand the so-called quantum van der Pol model used in quantum synchronisation. We\nthen go beyond the weakly nonlinear regime and obtain an exact quantum analogue\nof the nonlinear oscillator which van der Pol proposed in his 1926 paper.\n", "  A review of ATLAS and CMS measurements of the inclusive $t\\bar{t}$ production\ncross-section in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$7-13 TeV is presented, focusing\non the most precise results in the dilepton and lepton+jets final states. The\nmeasurements are in good agreement with state-of-the-art QCD predictions, and\nhave been used to determine the top quark pole mass and provide constraints on\nproton parton distribution functions.\n", "  We have re-examined the temperature-doping (T-p) phase diagram of YBa2Cu3Oy\n(YBCO) to address several issues therein by using the temperature derivative of\nin-plane resistivity, d\\{rho}ab/dT. For p less than about 0.15, a temperature\nTf has been defined to mark the onset of an upturn in d\\{rho}ab/dT at T>Tc,\nwhich, in light of prior studies on another cuprate La2-xSrxCuO4, is attributed\nto the onset of superconducting fluctuations in normal state. The Tf exhibits a\ndoping dependence similar to Tc, and the interval between Tf and Tc is about\n5-30 K across the underdoped regime, showing agreement with a variety of other\nmeasurements to probe a restricted temperature range of superconducting\nfluctuations. Above Tf, the d\\{rho}ab/dT increases linearly as T increases up\nto a value denoted as T2, which is about half the T* and falls roughly in\nparallel with T* as p rises up to about 0.13, indicating a prominent\nT^2-dependent \\{rho}ab in this T-p region. The d\\{rho}ab/dT helps reveal that,\nat Tf<T<T2, the \\{rho}ab also involves an insulating-like component for p<0.08,\nor a T-linear component for p>0.10-0.11, thereby leaving a narrow window of\ndoping for \\{rho}ab to show a pure T^2 dependence. As T increases further, the\nd\\{rho}ab/dT reaches a local maximum at a temperature T_R, signifying the known\ncurvature change (inflection point) in \\{rho}ab. With the derivatives, it is\nillustrated that, in the vicinity of T_R, the in-plane Hall coefficient R_H and\nthermopower Sab of YBCO display curvature changes as well, suggesting a\ncorrelation of the three transport properties. It is also found that the\ndSab/dT shows the onset of an upturn at a temperature coinciding with the Tf,\nwhich, backing the identification of Tf with the onset of superconducting\nfluctuations, demonstrates further the virtue of using the temperature\nderivative to unveil information helpful for the study of high-Tc cuprates.\n", "  In this proceedings contribution, we will review the basics of quasiparticle\nanisotropic hydrodynamics. Then, we will present some recent phenomenological\nresults of 3+1d quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics and Pb-Pb $2.76$ TeV\ncollisions from the ALICE collaboration. We show that 3+1d quasiparticle\nanisotropic hydrodynamics model is able to describe the experimental results\nfor Pb-Pb collisions at $2.76$ TeV quite well for many observables such as the\nspectra, the elliptic flow, and HBT radii in many centrality classes.\n", "  The interaction between dislocations and precipitates plays an important role\nin the mechanical behavior of alloys. To provide more insight into the physics\nof this interaction, this research analyzes short-range interactions of an edge\ndislocation with an array of equally-spaced identical precipitates. We use a\nmodified dislocation dynamics approach accounting for penetrable and\nimpenetrable precipitates. This research quantifies the effects of precipitate\nresistance on the geometry of the dislocation-precipitation interaction and the\nlocal distribution of plastic strain near a precipitate. The results show that\na precipitate with a higher resistance causes an increase in the maximum value\nof dislocation curvature during the bypass. In addition, a higher level of\nprecipitate resistance leads to a lower level of plastic deformation. Moreover,\nwe observed a high plastic strain gradient at the interface of non-shearable\nprecipitates.\n", "  If sufficiently irradiated by its central star, a protoplanetary disks falls\ninto an equilibrium state exhibiting vertical shear. This state may be subject\nto a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical shear instability' (VSI), whose\nbreakdown into turbulence transports a moderate amount of angular momentum\nwhile also facilitating planet formation, possibly via the production of\nsmall-scale vortices. In this paper, we show that VSI modes (a) exhibit\narbitrary spatial profiles and (b) remain nonlinear solutions to the\nincompressible local equations, no matter their amplitude. The modes are\nthemselves subject to parasitic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, though the disk\nrotation significantly impedes the parasites and permits the VSI to attain\nlarge amplitudes (fluid velocities < 10% the sound speed). This `delay' in\nsaturation probably explains the prominence of the VSI linear modes in global\nsimulations. More generally, the parasites may set the amplitude of VSI\nturbulence in strongly irradiated disks. They are also important in breaking\nthe axisymmetry of the flow, via the unavoidable formation of vortices. The\nvortices, however, are not aligned with the orbital plane and thus express a\npronounced $z$-dependence. We also briefly demonstrate that the vertical shear\nhas little effect on the magnetorotational instability, whereas magnetic fields\neasily quench the VSI, a potential issue in the ionised surface regions of the\ndisk and also at larger radii.\n", "  There is a new urgency for wider segments of the non-expert population to\njoin in shaping the future direction of our technological society. Certain\ndecisions being made now in the development of energy resources will profoundly\naffect the lives of the next few generations. This course is oriented toward\nproviding an educational base for participating in these decisions. At this\nlevel, there is no need for any mathematics beyond simple arithmetic, nor for\nany previous knowledge of physics or chemistry.\n", "  We discuss the general structure of metric geometries, and how metricity\nimplies the complete antisymmetry of Cartan tensor; an application in the frame\nof Lie group theory is given. Interpretations of the completely antisymmetric\ntorsion in physical models are reviewed.\n", "  We show that the Lorentz-Dirac equation is not an unavoidable consequence of\nenergy-momentum conservation for a point charge. What follows solely from\nconservation laws is a less restrictive equation already obtained by Honig and\nSzamosi. The latter is not properly an equation of motion because, as it\ncontains an extra scalar variable, it does not determine the future evolution\nof the charge. We show that a supplementary constitutive relation can be added\nso that the motion is determined and free from the troubles that are customary\nin Lorentz-Dirac equation, i. e. preacceleration and runaways.\n"]}
