These crystals are the only available perovskite\nsubstrates in this lattice constant range that can withstand virtually any thin\nfilm growth conditions. Two members of this series, PmScO3 and EuScO3, are,\nhowever, not suitable for substrate applications. Because the pseudo-cubic\nlattice parameters between neighbouring REScO3 compounds decrease with rising\natomic number of the RE in about 0.01 Angstrom steps, the unsuitability of\nPmScO3 (radioactivity) and EuScO3 (incompatibility with Si) causes an\ninterruption in this lattice spacing sequence. To replace them, solid solutions\nof their adjacent rare-earth scandates, i.e., (Nd0.5Sm0.5)ScO3 and\n(Sm0.5Gd0.5)ScO3, were grown by the Czochralski method. Their average\npseudo-cubic lattice parameters of 3.9979 Angstrom and 3.9784 Angstrom are very\nclose to those of PmScO3 and EuScO3, respectively, and they show very low\nsegregation. These qualities make these solid solutions excellent substitutes\nfor PmScO3 and EuScO3.\n", "  The TiO2 rich part of the (1-x) SrO + x TiO2 phase diagram 0.5 <= x <= 1.0\nwas redetermined and the eutectic point between SrTiO3 and TiO2 was found at\nx_eut=0.7700+/-0.0001; T_eut=(1449+/-3) deg C. From TiO2 rich melt solutions,\nx=0.75 centimeter-sized single crystals could be grown. The best crystals with\netch pit density <2 x 10^4/cm^2 were obtained for growth directions <110> and\n<100>. AFM investigation of the interface reveals layer-by-layer growth.\n", "  Random tunneling two-level systems (TLSs) in dielectrics have been of\ninterest recently because they adversely affect the performance of\nsuperconducting qubits. The coupling of TLSs to qubits has allowed individual\nTLS characterization, which has previously been limited to TLSs within (thin)\nJosephson tunneling barriers made from aluminum oxide. Here we report on the\nmeasurement of an individual TLS within the capacitor of a lumped-element LC\nmicrowave resonator, which forms a cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) system\nand allows for individual TLS characterization in a different structure and\nmaterial than demonstrated with qubits. Due to the reduced volume of the\ndielectric (80 $\\mu$m$^{3}$), even with a moderate dielectric thickness (250\nnm), we achieve the strong coupling regime as evidenced by the vacuum Rabi\nsplitting observed in the cavity spectrum. A TLS with a coherence time of 3.2\n$\\mu$s was observed in a film of silicon nitride as analyzed with a\nJaynes-Cummings spectral model, which is larger than seen from superconducting\nqubits. As the drive power is increased, we observe an unusual but explicable\nset of continuous and discrete crossovers from the vacuum Rabi split\ntransitions to the Glauber (coherent) state.\n", "  The development of semiconductor electronics is shortly reviewed, beginning\nwith the development of germanium devices (band gap $E_g=0.66$ eV) after world\nwar II. Quickly a tendency to alternative materials with wider band gap became\napparent, starting with silicon ($E_g=1.12$ eV). This improved the signal/noise\nratio for classical electronic applications. Both semiconductors have\ntetrahedral coordination, and by isoelectronic alternative replacement of Ge or\nSi with carbon or several anions and cations other semiconductors with wider\n$E_g$ are obtained, that are transparent for visible light and belong to the\ngroup of wide band gap semiconductors. Nowadays some nitrides, especially GaN\nand AlN, are the most important materials for optical emission in the\nultraviolet and blue spectral region. Oxide crystals, such as ZnO and\n$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, offer similarly good electronic properties but suffer\nstill from significant difficulties in obtaining stable and technically\nsufficient $p$-type conductivity.\n", "  The magnetization curve in a frustrated two-leg spin-ladder system is\ntheoretically studied using both analytical and numerical methods. This spin\nsystem is mapped onto a hard-core boson system, which is composed of\nbond-operators describing the triplon excitation. By the analytical method\nusing the mean-field theory on the bond-operators, we show that cusp\nsingularities emerge in the magnetization curve as a function of a magnetic\nfield due to the strong frustration. This originates from a change of number of\nFermi points in the bosonic dispersion relation with the applied field. It is\nanalogous to Lifshitz transition. This singularity is clarified by numerical\ncalculation with the density-matrix renormalization-group method. Our results\nwill be useful to understand the magnetization process observed in the\nfrustrated two-leg spin-ladder compound BiCu2PO6.\n", "  We present a powerful new algorithm that combines both spatial information\n(event locations and the point spread function) and spectral information\n(photon energies) to separate photons from overlapping sources. We use Bayesian\nstatistical methods to simultaneously infer the number of overlapping sources,\nto probabilistically separate the photons among the sources, and to fit the\nparameters describing the individual sources. Using the Bayesian joint\nposterior distribution, we are able to coherently quantify the uncertainties\nassociated with all these parameters. The advantages of combining spatial and\nspectral information are demonstrated through a simulation study. The utility\nof the approach is then illustrated by analysis of observations of FK Aqr and\nFL Aqr with the XMM-Newton Observatory and the central region of the Orion\nNebula Cluster with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\n", "  Hawking radiation is generally derived using a non-interacting field theory.\nSome time ago, Leahy and Unruh showed that, in two dimensions with a\nSchwarzschild geometry, a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction gets\nthe coupling switched off near the horizon of the black hole. This would imply\nthat interaction has no effect on Hawking radiation and free theory for\nparticles can be used. Recently, a set of exact classical solutions for the\nquartic scalar field theory has been obtained. These solutions display a\nmassive dispersion relation even if the starting theory is massless. When one\nconsiders the corresponding quantum field theory, this mass gap becomes a tower\nof massive excitations and, at the leading order, the theory is trivial. We\napply these results to Hawking radiation for a Kerr geometry and prove that the\nLeahy-Unruh effect is at work. Approaching the horizon the scalar field theory\nhas the mass gap going to zero. We devise a technique to study the interacting\nscalar theory very near the horizon increasing the coupling. As these solutions\nare represented by a Fourier series of plane waves, Hawking radiation can be\nimmediately obtained with well-known techniques. These results open a question\nabout the behavior of the Standard Model of particles very near the horizon of\na black hole where the interactions turn out to be switched off and the\nelectroweak symmetry could be restored.\n", "  The technology of scintillating bolometers based on zinc molybdate\n(ZnMoO$_4$) crystals is under development within the LUMINEU project to search\nfor 0$\\nu$2$\\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo with the goal to set the basis for large\nscale experiments capable to explore the inverted hierarchy region of the\nneutrino mass pattern. Advanced ZnMoO$_4$ crystal scintillators with mass of\n$\\sim$~0.3 kg were developed and Zn$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystal from enriched\n$^{100}$Mo was produced for the first time by using the low-thermal-gradient\nCzochralski technique. One ZnMoO$_4$ scintillator and two samples (59 g and 63\ng) cut from the enriched boule were tested aboveground at milli-Kelvin\ntemperature as scintillating bolometers showing a high detection performance.\nThe first results of the low background measurements with three ZnMoO$_4$ and\ntwo enriched detectors installed in the EDELWEISS set-up at the Modane\nUnderground Laboratory (France) are presented.\n", "  We initiate a systematic study of four dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) based on the analysis of their Coulomb\nbranch geometries. Because these SCFTs are not uniquely characterized by their\nscale-invariant Coulomb branch geometries we also need information on their\ndeformations. We construct all inequivalent such deformations preserving\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and additional physical consistency conditions in\nthe rank 1 case. These not only include all the ones previously predicted by\nS-duality, but also 16 additional deformations satisfying all the known\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ low energy consistency conditions. All but two of these\nadditonal deformations have recently been identified with new rank 1 SCFTs;\nthese identifications are briefly reviewed.\n  Some novel ingredients which are important for this study include: a\ndiscussion of RG-flows in the presence of a moduli space of vacua; a\nclassification of local $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry-preserving deformations\nof unitary $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs; and an analysis of charge normalizations and\nthe Dirac quantization condition on Coulomb branches.\n  This paper is the first in a series of three. The second paper, 1601.00011,\ngives the details of the explicit construction of the Coulomb branch geometries\ndiscussed here, while the third, 1609.04404, discusses the computation of\ncentral charges of the associated SCFTs.\n", "  We consider Chern-Simons theory on 3-manifold $M$ that is the total space of\na circle bundle over a 2d base $\\Sigma$. We show that this theory is equivalent\nto a new 2d TQFT on the base, which we call Caloron BF theory, that can be\nobtained by an appropriate type of push-forward. This is a gauge theory on a\nbundle with structure group given by the full affine level $k$ central\nextension of the loop group $LG$. The space of fields of this 2d theory is\nnaturally symplectic, and this provides a new formulation of a result of\nBeasley-Witten about the equivariant localization of the Chern-Simons path\nintegral. The main tool that we employ is the Caloron correspondence,\noriginally due to Murray-Garland, that relates the space of gauge fields on $M$\nwith a certain enlarged space of connections on an equivariant version of the\nloop space of the $G$-bundle. We show that the symplectic structure that\nBeasley-Witten found is related to a looped version of the Atiyah-Bott\nconstruction in 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. We also show that Wilson loops\nthat wrap a single circle fiber are also described very naturally in this\nframework.\n", "  An ensemble of pulse-coupled phase-oscillators is thoroughly analysed in the\npresence of a mean-field coupling and a dispersion of their natural\nfrequencies. In spite of the analogies with the Kuramoto setup, a much richer\nscenario is observed. The \"synchronised phase\", which emerges upon increasing\nthe coupling strength, is characterized by highly-irregular fluctuations: a\ntime-series analysis reveals that the dynamics of the order parameter is indeed\nhigh-dimensional. The complex dynamics appears to be the result of the\nnon-perturbative action of a suitably shaped phase-response curve. Such\nmechanism differs from the often invoked balance between excitation and\ninhibition and might provide an alternative basis to account for the\nself-sustained brain activity in the resting state. The potential interest of\nthis dynamical regime is further strengthened by its (microscopic) linear\nstability, which makes it quite suited for computational tasks. The overall\nstudy has been performed by combining analytical and numerical studies,\nstarting from the linear stability analysis of the asynchronous regime, to\ninclude the Fourier analysis of the Kuramoto order parameter, the computation\nof various types of Lyapunov exponents, and a microscopic study of the\ninter-spike intervals.\n", "  The quasi-spin correlations in a frustrated quantum spin ladder with one-half\nmagnetization are theoretically studied by using the density-matrix\nrenormalization-group method and the quasi-spin transformation. In this model,\nthe frustration induces a gapless-to-gapful phase transition with a strong rung\ncoupling. The gapful state is observed as the one-half magnetization plateau in\nthe magnetization curve. In the magnetization-plateau state, we find that the\nquasi-spin dimer has a large expectation value with long-ranged correlations.\nThis result does not only comes in useful to clarify the magnetization-plateau\nstate, but gives a crucial information to understand the magnetization curve of\nthe real compound BiCu$_2$PO$_6$, whose effective spin model corresponds to\nours.\n", "  The matrix integral has many applications in diverse fields. This review\narticle begins by presenting detailed key background knowledge about matrix\nintegral. Then the volumes of orthogonal groups and unitary groups are\ncomputed, respectively. As a unification, we present Mcdonald's volume formula\nfor a compact Lie group. With this volume formula, one can easily derives the\nvolumes of orthogonal groups and unitary groups. Applications are also\npresented as well. Specifically, The volume of the set of mixed quantum states\nis computed by using the volume of unitary group. The volume of a metric ball\nin unitary group is also computed as well.\n  There are no new results in this article, but only detailed and elementary\nproofs of existing results. The purpose of the article is pedagogical, and to\ncollect in one place many, if not all, of the quantum information applications\nof the volumes of orthogonal and unitary groups.\n", "  Networks are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering. A number of\nmethods, including some from our own group, have explored how one goes about\ncomputing or predicting the dynamics of networks given information about\ninternal models of individual nodes and network connectivity, possibly with\nadditional information provided by statistical or descriptive metrics that\ncharacterize the network. But what can be inferred about network dynamics when\nthere is no knowledge or information about the internal model or dynamics of\nparticipating nodes? Here, we explore how connected subsets of nodes\ncompetitively interact in order to activate a common downstream node they\nconnect into. We achieve this by assuming a simple set of rules borrowed from\nneurophysiology. The model we develop reflects a local process from which\nglobal network dynamics emerges. We call this model a competitive refractory\ndynanics model. It is derived from a consideration of spatial and temporal\nsummation in biological neurons, whereby summating post synaptic potentials\n(PSPs) along the dendritic tree contribute towards the membrane potential at\nthe initial segment reaching a threshold potential. We first show how the\n'winning node' or set of 'winning' nodes that achieve activation of a\ndownstream node is computable by the model. We then derive a formal definition\nof optimized network signaling within our framework. We define a ratio between\nthe signaling latencies on the edges of the network and the internal time it\ntakes individual nodes to process incoming signals. We show that an optimal\nratio is one where the speed of information propagation between connected nodes\ndoes not exceed the internal dynamic time scale of the nodes. We then show how\nwe can use these results to arrive at a unique interpretation for the\nprevalence of the small world network topology in natural and engineered\nsystems.\n", "  We present a comparison between two different mathematical models used in the\ndescription of the Ebola virus propagation currently occurring in West Africa.\nIn order to improve the prediction and the control of the propagation of the\nvirus, numerical simulations and optimal control of the two models for Ebola\nare investigated. In particular, we study when the two models generate similar\nresults.\n", "  Given the fact that the relatively light Higgsino mass $\\mu$ favored in\nnatural supersymmetry usually results in a sizable scattering cross section\nbetween the neutralino dark matter and the nucleon, we study the impact of the\nrecently updated direct detection bounds from LUX experiment, including both\nSpin Independent (SI) and Spin Dependent (SD) measurements, on the parameter\nspace of natural Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (nNMSSM).\nDifferent from the common impression that the SI bound is stronger than the SD\none, we find that the SD bound is complementary to the SI bound and in some\ncases much more powerful than the latter in limiting the nNMSSM scenarios.\nAfter considering the LUX results, nNMSSM is severely limited, e.g. for the\npeculiar scenarios of the NMSSM where the next-to-lightest CP-even Higgs\ncorresponds to the $125 {\\rm GeV}$ Higgs boson discovered at the LHC, the\nsamples obtained in our random scan are excluded by more than $85\\%$. By\ncontrast, the monojet search at the LHC Run-I can not exclude any sample of\nnNMSSM. We also investigate the current status of nNMSSM and conclude that,\nalthough the parameter points with low fine tuning are still attainable, they\nare distributed in some isolated parameter islands which are difficult to get.\nFuture dark matter direct search experiments such as XENON-1T will provide a\nbetter test of nNMSSM.\n", "  We probe magnetic domain walls in cylindrical soft magnetic nanowires using\nelectron holography. We detail the modelling of expected contrast for both\ntransverse and Bloch point domain walls and provide comparison with\nexperimental observations performed on NiCo nanowires, involving also both\nmagnetic and electrostatic contribution to the electron holography map. This\nallows the fast determination of the domain wall type without the need for\nuneasy and time-consuming experimental removal of the electrostatic\ncontribution. Finally, we describe and implement a new efficient algorithm for\ncalculating the magnetic contrast.\n", "  We provide explicit lower bounds for the ground-state energy of the\nrenormalized Nelson model in terms of the coupling constant $\\alpha$ and the\nnumber of particles $N$, uniform in the meson mass and valid even in the\nmassless case. In particular, for any number of particles $N$ and large enough\n$\\alpha$ we provide a bound of the form $-C\\alpha^2 N^3\\log^2(\\alpha N)$, where\n$C$ is an explicit positive numerical constant; and if $\\alpha$ is sufficiently\nsmall, we give one of the form $-C\\alpha^2 N^3\\log^2 N$ for $N \\geq 2$, and\n$-C\\alpha^2$ for $N = 1$. Whereas it is known that the renormalized Hamiltonian\nof the Nelson model is bounded below (as realized by E. Nelson) and implicit\nlower bounds have been given elsewhere (as in a recent work by Gubinelli,\nHiroshima, and L\\\"{o}rinczi), ours seem to be the first fully explicit lower\nbounds with a reasonable dependence on $\\alpha$ and $N$. We emphasize that the\nlogarithmic term in the bounds above is probably an artifact in our\ncalculations, since one would expect that the ground-state energy should behave\nas $-C\\alpha^2 N^3$ for large $N$ or $\\alpha$, as in the polaron model of H.\nFr\\\"{o}hlich.\n", "  In metric formalism, Noether symmetry of F(R) theory of gravity in vacuum and\nin the presence of pressureless dust yields $F(R)\\propto R^\\frac{3}{2}$ along\nwith the conserved current $\\frac{d}{dt} (a\\sqrt R)$ in Robertson-Walker metric\nand nothing else. However, Roshan et.al. had claimed in $\\mathrm{Phys. Lett.\n\\textbf{B668}, 238 (2008)}$ \\cite{o} that Noether symmetry in the context of\nPalatini $F(\\Re)$ theory of gravity admits $F(\\Re)\\propto \\Re^{s}$, (where $s$\nis an arbitrary constant) in matter domain era in Friedmann- Robertson-Walker\nuniverse. But, it has been shown that the conserved current obtained under the\nprocess does not satisfy the field equations in general. Here, it is shown that\nNoether Symmetry admits $F(\\Re)\\propto\\Re^\\frac{3}{2}$ along with a conserved\ncurrent $\\Sigma_{0} {a}[\\frac{\\dot a}{a}+ \\frac{\\dot\\Phi}{2\\Phi}]$ in Palatini\ngravity. Thus, their claim is not right.\n", "  Measurements of charm mixing and $C\\!P$ violation parameters from the\ndecay-time-dependent ratio of $ D^0 \\to K^+ \\pi^- $ to $ D^0 \\to K^- \\pi^+ $\ndecay rates and the charge-conjugate ratio are reported. The analysis uses\n$\\overline{B}\\to D^{*+} \\mu^- X$, and charge-conjugate decays, where $D^{*+}\\to\nD^0 \\pi^+$, and $D^0\\to K^{\\mp} \\pi^{\\pm}$. The $pp$ collision data are\nrecorded by the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 8\nTeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The data are\nanalyzed under three hypotheses: (i) mixing assuming $C\\!P$ symmetry, (ii)\nmixing assuming no direct $C\\!P$ violation in the Cabibbo-favored or doubly\nCabibbo-suppressed decay amplitudes, and (iii) mixing allowing either direct\n$C\\!P$ violation and/or $C\\!P$ violation in the superpositions of flavor\neigenstates defining the mass eigenstates. The data are also combined with\nthose from a previous LHCb study of $D^0\\to K \\pi$ decays from a disjoint set\nof $ D^{*+} $ candidates produced directly in $pp$ collisions. In all cases,\nthe data are consistent with the hypothesis of $C\\!P$ symmetry.\n", "  Nodal semimetals, materials systems with nodal-point or -line Fermi surfaces,\nare much sought after for their novel transport and topological properties.\nIdentification of experimental materials candidates, however, has mainly relied\non exhaustive database searches. Here we show how recent studies on the\ninterplay between electron filling and nonsymmorphic space-group symmetries can\nguide the search for nodal semimetals which are `filling-enforced'. We recast\nthe previously-derived constraints on the allowed electron fillings for band\ninsulators in the 230 space groups into a new form, which enables effective\nscreening of materials candidates based solely on their (1) space group, (2)\nelectron count in the formula unit, and (3) multiplicity of the formula unit.\nThis criterion greatly reduces the computation load for discovering topological\nmaterials in a database of previously-synthesized compounds. Of the more than\n30,000 entires listed in a few selected nonsymmorphic space groups, our filling\ncriterion alone eliminates 96% of the entries before they are passed on for\nfurther analysis. From this guided search, we discover a handful of candidates,\nincluding the monoclinic crystals Ca$_2$Pt$_2$Ga, AgF$_2$, and Ca$_2$InOsO$_6$,\nand the orthorhombic crystal CsHg$_2$. Based on ab initio calculations, we show\nthat these materials have filling-enforced Dirac nodes near the Fermi energy.\nIn addition, we also identify CaPtGa as a promising filling-enforced Dirac-ring\nsemimetal candidate.\n", "  We consider simplified models for dark matter (DM) at the LHC, focused on\nmono-Higgs, -Z, or -b produced in the final state. Our primary purpose is to\nstudy the LHC reach of a relatively complete set of simplified models for these\nfinal states, while comparing the reach of the mono-X DM search against direct\nsearches for the mediating particle. We find that direct searches for the\nmediating particle, whether in di-jets, jets+MET, multi-b+MET, or di-boson+MET,\nare usually stronger. We draw attention to the cases that the mono-X search is\nstrongest, which include regions of parameter space in inelastic DM, two Higgs\ndoublet, and squark mediated production models with a compressed spectrum.\n", "  The design of low temperature bolometric detectors for rare event searches\nnecessitates careful selection and characterization of structural materials\nbased on their thermal properties. We measure the thermal conductivities of\npolytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and Al$_2$O$_3$ ceramic (alumina) in the\ntemperature ranges of 0.17-0.43 K and 0.1-1.3 K, respectively. For the former,\nwe observe a quadratic temperature dependence across the entire measured range.\nFor the latter, we see a cubic dependence on temperature above ~0.3 K, with a\nlinear contribution below that temperature. This paper presents our measurement\ntechniques, results, and theoretical discussions. Keywords: Thermal\nConductivity, PTFE, Al$_2$O$_3$ ceramic, Bolometer\n", "  For open systems described by the quantum master equation (QME), we\ninvestigate the excess entropy production under quasistatic operations between\nnonequilibrium steady states. The average entropy production is composed of the\ntime integral of the instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the\nexcess entropy production. We propose to define average entropy production rate\nusing the average energy and particle currents, which are calculated by using\nthe full counting statistics with QME. The excess entropy production is given\nby a line integral in the control parameter space and its integrand is called\nthe Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime,\nwe show that BSN vector is described by $\\ln \\breve{\\rho}_0$ and $\\rho_0$ where\n$\\rho_0$ is the instantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\breve{\\rho}_0$ is\nthat of the QME which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. If\nthe system Hamiltonian is non-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible,\nthe excess entropy production approximately reduces to the difference between\nthe von Neumann entropies of the system. Additionally, we point out that the\nexpression of the entropy production obtained in the classical Markov jump\nprocess is different from our result and show that these are approximately\nequivalent only in the weakly nonequilibrium regime.\n", "  We review recent progress in the theoretical description of hard probes in\nheavy-ion collisions within the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory\n(SCET). Firstly, we consider the inclusive production of heavy flavor mesons\nand jets with a small radius parameter in proton-proton collisions. Secondly,\nwe describe how in-medium effects can be incorporated consistently with the\nproton-proton baseline calculations. The in-medium interactions are described\nby Glauber gluon interactions. We present results for the nuclear modification\nfactor $R_{AA}$ which is most commonly used to study the quenching of hadron or\njet production yields in heavy-ion collisions and we compare to recent data\nfrom the LHC.\n", "  Proton inelastic scattering experiments at energy E_p = 200 MeV and a\nspectrometer scattering angle of 0 degree were performed on 144,146,148,150Nd\nand 152Sm exciting the IsoVector Giant Dipole Resonance (IVGDR). Comparison\nwith results from photo-absorption experiments reveals a shift of resonance\nmaxima towards higher energies for vibrational and transitional nuclei. The\nextracted photo-absorption cross sections in the most deformed nuclei, 150Nd\nand 152Sm, exhibit a pronounced asymmetry rather than a distinct double-hump\nstructure expected as a signature of K-splitting. This behaviour can be related\nto the proximity of these nuclei to the critical point of the phase shape\ntransition from vibrators to rotors with a soft quadrupole deformation\npotential. Self-consistent random-phase approximation (RPA) calculations using\nthe SLy6 Skyrme force provide a relevant description of the IVGDR shapes\ndeduced from the present data\n", "  We discuss the quantum simulation of symmetry-protected topological (SPT)\nstates for interacting fermions in quasi-one-dimensional gases of\nalkaline-earth-like atoms such as $^{173}$Yb. Taking advantage of the\nseparation of orbital and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom in these atoms, we\nconsider Raman-assisted spin-orbit couplings in the clock states, which,\ntogether with the spin-exchange interactions in the clock-state manifolds, give\nrise to SPT states for interacting fermions. We numerically investigate the\nphase diagram of the system, and study the phase transitions between the SPT\nphase and the symmetry-breaking phases. The interaction-driven topological\nphase transition can be probed by measuring local density distribution of the\ntopological edge modes.\n", "  Associated to quantum affine general linear Lie superalgebras are two\nfamilies of short exact sequences of representations whose first and third\nterms are irreducible: the Baxter TQ relations involving infinite-dimensional\nrepresentations; the extended T-systems of Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules. We\nmake use of these representations over the full quantum affine superalgebra to\ndefine Baxter operators as transfer matrices for the quantum integrable model\nand to deduce Bethe Ansatz Equations, under genericity conditions.\n", "  Strangeness signature of of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is central to the\nexploration of baryon-dense matter: the search for the critical point and onset\nof deconfinement. I report on the discovery of QGP by means of strangeness: The\nkey historical figures and their roles in this quest are introduced and the\nexperimental results obtained are discussed. The important role of antihyperons\nis emphasized. The statistical hadronization model, and sudden hadronization\nare described. Results of present day data analysis: strangeness and entropy\ncontent of a large fireball, and the universal hadronization condition\ndescribing key features of all explored collision systems are presented.\n", "  We modify the standard relativistic dispersion relation in a way which breaks\nLorentz symmetry - the effect is predicted in a high-energy regime of some\nmodern theories of quantum gravity. We show that it is possible to realise this\nscenario within the framework of Rainbow Gravity which introduces two new\nenergy-dependent functions $f_1(E)$ and $f_2(E)$ into the dispersion relation.\nAdditionally, we assume that the gravitational constant $G$ and the\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ also depend on energy $E$ and introduce the\nscaling function $h(E)$ in order to express this dependence. For cosmological\napplications we specify the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ in order to fit massless\nparticles which allows us to derive modified cosmological equations. Finally,\nby using Hubble+SNIa+BAO(BOSS+Lyman $\\alpha$)+CMB data, we constrain the energy\nscale $E_{LV}$ to be at least of the order of $10^{16}$ GeV at $1\\sigma$ which\nis the GUT scale or even higher $10^{17}$ GeV at $3\\sigma$. Our claim is that\nthis energy can be interpreted as the decoupling scale of massless particles\nfrom spacetime Lorentz violating effects.\n", "  Various astrophysical processes are known, where the fly-by of a massive\nobject affects matter initially supported against gravity by rotation. Examples\nare perturbations of galaxies, protoplanetary discs or planetary systems. We\napproximate such events as subset of the restricted three-body problem by\nconsidering only perturbations of non-interacting low-mass objects initially on\ncircular Keplerian orbits. In this paper we present a new parametrisation of\nthe initial conditions of this problem. Under certain conditions the initial\npositions of the low-mass objects can be specified largely independent of the\ninitial position of the perturber. Exploiting additionally the known scalings\nof the problem reduces the parameter space of initial conditions for one\nspecific perturbation to two dimensions. To this two-dimensional initial\ncondition space we have related the final properties of the perturbed\ntrajectories of the low-mass objects from our numerical simulations. That way,\nmaps showing the effect of the perturbation on the low-mass objects have been\ncreated, which provide a new view on the perturbation process. Comparing the\nmaps for different mass-ratios reveals that the perturbations by low- and\nhigh-mass perturbers are dominated by different physical processes. The\nequal-mass case is a complicated mixture of the other two cases. Since the\nfinal properties of trajectories with similar initial conditions are usually\nalso similar, the results of the limited number of integrated trajectories can\nbe generalised to the full presented parameter space by interpolation. Since\nour results are also unique within the accuracy strived for, they constitute\ngeneral numerical solutions for this subset of the restricted three-body\nproblem. As such, they can be used to predict the evolution of real physical\nproblems by simple transformations like scaling and without further\nsimulations. (...)\n", "  The way Quantum Mechanics (QM) is introduced to people used to Classical\nMechanics (CM) is by a complete change of the general methodology) despite QM\nhistorically stemming from CM as a means to explain experimental results.\nTherefore, it is desirable to build a bridge from CM to QM.\n  This paper presents a generalization of CM to QM. It starts from the\ngeneralization of a point-like object and naturally arrives at the quantum\nstate vector of quantum systems in the complex valued Hilbert space, its time\nevolution and quantum representation of a measurement apparatus of any size.\nEach time, when generalization is performed, there is a possibility to develop\nnew theory giving up most simple generalizations. It is shown that a\nmeasurement apparatus is a special case of a general quantum object. An example\nof a measurement apparatus of an intermediate size is considered in the end.\n", "  According to quantum theory, pure physical states correspond to equivalence\nclasses of state vectors, where any two members of one class differ by a\ncomplex factor. The point is that such a factor does not change the probability\nfor the occurrence of any measurement result as computed within the formalism\nof quantum mechanics. In the formalism to be presented here, the state vector\ndoes not only determine the probabilities for the occurrence of measurement\nresults, rather it determines the result itself. The information which guides\nthe selection process is obtained from the state vector in a way that is not\ninvariant against multiplication by a complex factor. It can be seen as a kind\nof global phase of the state vectors. This global phase then is a perfectly\nhidden variable. For this presentation of quantum mechanics we have a\nremarkable parallelism to classical statistical mechanics: If we would know\nexactly the initial state of a system, we could compute the outcomes for all\nexperiments to be done later on this system. In the quantum case the initial\nstate is to be represented by its state vector with specified phase, e.g. as a\nconcrete complex-valued wave function.\n", "  We obtain asymptotic formulas for the partition function of the six-vertex\nmodel with domain wall boundary conditions and half-turn symmetry in each of\nthe phase regions. The proof is based on the Izergin--Korepin--Kuperberg\ndeterminantal formula for the partition function, its reduction to orthogonal\npolynomials, and on an asymptotic analysis of the orthogonal polynomials under\nconsideration in the framework of the Riemann--Hilbert approach.\n", "  We have trained a deep (convolutional) neural network to predict the\nground-state energy of an electron in four classes of confining two-dimensional\nelectrostatic potentials. On randomly generated potentials, for which there is\nno analytic form for either the potential or the ground-state energy, the\nneural network model was able to predict the ground-state energy to within\nchemical accuracy, with a median absolute error of 1.49 mHa. We also\ninvestigate the performance of the model in predicting other quantities such as\nthe kinetic energy and the first excited-state energy of random potentials.\n", "  This work examines the formation of wake fields caused by ions streaming\naround a charged dust particle, using three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations with charge-neutral collisions included. The influence of an\nexternal driving electric field, which leads to a non-Maxwellian distribution\nof ions, is investigated in detail. The wake features formed for non-Maxwellian\nions exhibit significant deviations from those observed within the model of a\nshifted Maxwellian distribution. The dependence of the peak amplitude and\nposition of the wake potential upon the degree of collisionality is analyzed\nfor a wide range of streaming velocities (Mach numbers). In contrast to a\nshifted Maxwellian distribution of ions, the drift-driven non-Maxwellian\ndistribution exhibits an increase of the wake amplitude of the first attractive\npeak with increase in collisionality for high streaming velocities. At very low\nMach numbers, collision-induced amplification is observed for Maxwellian as\nwell as non-Maxwellian distributions.\n", "  We present a search strategy for both Dirac and Majorana sterile neutrinos\nfrom the purely leptonic decays of $W^\\pm \\to e^\\pm e^\\pm \\mu^\\mp \\nu$ and\n$\\mu^\\pm \\mu^\\pm e^\\mp \\nu$ at the 14 TeV LHC. The discovery and exclusion\nlimits for sterile neutrinos are shown using both the Cut-and-Count (CC) and\nMulti-Variate Analysis (MVA) methods. We also discriminate between Dirac and\nMajorana sterile neutrinos by exploiting a set of kinematic observables which\ndiffer between the Dirac and Majorana cases. We find that the MVA method,\ncompared to the more common CC method, can greatly enhance the discovery and\ndiscrimination limits. Two benchmark points with sterile neutrino mass $m_N =\n20$ GeV and 50 GeV are tested. For an integrated luminosity of 3000 ${\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$, sterile neutrinos can be found with $5 \\sigma$ significance if\nheavy-to-light neutrino mixings $|U_{Ne}|^2 \\sim |U_{N\\mu}|^2\\sim 10^{-6}$,\nwhile Majorana vs. Dirac discrimination can be reached if at least one of the\nmixings is of order $10^{-5}$.\n", "  The extensive research of two-dimensional layered materials has revealed that\nvalleys, as energy extrema in momentum space, could offer a new degree of\nfreedom for carrying information. Based on this concept, researchers have\npredicted valley-Hall topological insulators which could support\nvalley-polarized edge states at non-trivial domain walls. Recently, several\nkinds of photonic or sonic crystals have been proposed as classical\ncounterparts of valley-Hall topological insulators. However, direct\nexperimental observation of valley-polarized edge states in photonic crystals\nis still difficult until now. Here, we demonstrate a designer surface plasmon\ncrystal comprising metallic patterns deposited on a dielectric substrate, which\ncan become a valley-Hall photonic topological insulator by exploiting the\nmirror-symmetry-breaking mechanism. Topological edge states with\nvalley-dependent transport are directly visualized in the microwave regime. The\nobserved edge states are confirmed to be fully valley-polarized through spatial\nFourier transforms. Topological protection of the edge states at sharp corners\nis also experimentally demonstrated.\n", "  We report on the development and application of an atomic layer etching (ALE)\nprocedure based on alternating exposures of trimethylaluminum and anhydrous\nhydrogen fluoride (HF) implemented to controllably etch aluminum oxide. Our ALE\nprocess utilizes the same chemistry previously demonstrated in the atomic layer\ndeposition of aluminum fluoride thin films, and can therefore be exploited to\nremove the surface oxide from metallic aluminum and replace it with thin\nfluoride layers in order to improve the performance of ultraviolet aluminum\nmirrors. This ALE process is modified relative to existing methods through the\nuse of a chamber conditioning film of lithium fluoride, which is shown to\nenhance the loss of fluorine surface species and results in conformal\nlayer-by-layer etching of aluminum oxide films. Etch properties were explored\nover a temperature range of 225 to 300 {\\deg}C with the Al2O3 etch rate\nincreasing from 0.8 to 1.2 {\\AA} per ALE cycle at a fixed HF exposure of 60 ms\nper cycle. The effective etch rate has a dependence on the total HF exposure,\nbut the process is shown to be scalable to large area substrates with a\npost-etch uniformity of better than 2% demonstrated on 125 mm diameter wafers.\nThe efficacy of the ALE process in reducing interfacial native aluminum oxide\non evaporated aluminum mirrors is demonstrated with characterization by x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy and measurements of ultraviolet reflectance at\nwavelengths down to 120 nm.\n", "  Many determinantal inequalities for positive definite block matrices are\nconsequences of general entropy inequalities, specialised to Gaussian\ndistributed vectors with prescribed covariances. In particular, strong\nsubadditivity (SSA) yields \\begin{equation*} \\ln\\det V_{AC} + \\ln\\det V_{BC} -\n\\ln\\det V_{ABC} - \\ln\\det V_C \\geq 0 \\end{equation*} for all $3\\times 3$-block\nmatrices $V_{ABC}$, where subscripts identify principal submatrices. We shall\nrefer to the above inequality as SSA of log-det entropy. In this paper we\ndevelop further insights on the properties of the above inequality and its\napplications to classical and quantum information theory.\n  In the first part of the paper, we show how to find known and new necessary\nand sufficient conditions under which saturation with equality occurs.\nSubsequently, we discuss the role of the classical transpose channel (also\nknown as Petz recovery map) in this problem and find its action explicitly. We\nthen prove some extensions of the saturation theorem, by finding faithful lower\nbounds on a log-det conditional mutual information.\n  In the second part, we focus on quantum Gaussian states, whose covariance\nmatrices are not only positive but obey additional constraints due to the\nuncertainty relation. For Gaussian states, the log-det entropy is equivalent to\nthe R\\'enyi entropy of order $2$. We provide a strengthening of log-det SSA for\nquantum covariance matrices that involves the so-called Gaussian R\\'enyi-$2$\nentanglement of formation, a well-behaved entanglement measure defined via a\nGaussian convex roof construction. We then employ this result to define a\nlog-det entropy equivalent of the squashed entanglement, which is remarkably\nshown to coincide with the Gaussian R\\'enyi-$2$ entanglement of formation. This\nallows us to establish useful properties of such measure(s), like monogamy,\nfaithfulness, and additivity on Gaussian states.\n", "  Human decision making underlies data generating process in multiple\napplication areas, and models explaining and predicting choices made by\nindividuals are in high demand. Discrete choice models are widely studied in\neconomics and computational social sciences. As digital social networking\nfacilitates information flow and spread of influence between individuals, new\nadvances in modeling are needed to incorporate social information into these\nmodels in addition to characteristic features affecting individual choices. In\nthis paper, we propose two novel models with scalable training algorithms:\nlocal logistics graph regularization (LLGR) and latent class graph\nregularization (LCGR) models. We add social regularization to represent\nsimilarity between friends, and we introduce latent classes to account for\npossible preference discrepancies between different social groups. Training of\nthe LLGR model is performed using alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM), and training of the LCGR model is performed using a specialized Monte\nCarlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Scalability to large graphs is\nachieved by parallelizing computation in both the expectation and the\nmaximization steps. The LCGR model is the first latent class classification\nmodel that incorporates social relationships among individuals represented by a\ngiven graph. To evaluate our two models, we consider three classes of data to\nillustrate a typical large-scale use case in internet and social media\napplications. We experiment on synthetic datasets to empirically explain when\nthe proposed model is better than vanilla classification models that do not\nexploit graph structure. We also experiment on real-world data, including both\nsmall scale and large scale real-world datasets, to demonstrate on which types\nof datasets our model can be expected to outperform state-of-the-art models.\n", "  A gravitational field model based on two symmetric tensors, $g_{\\mu \\nu}$ and\n$\\tilde{g}_{\\mu \\nu}$, is presented. In this model, new matter fields are added\nto the original matter fields, motivated by an additional symmetry\n($\\tilde{\\delta}$ symmetry). We call them $\\tilde{\\delta}$ matter fields. We\nfind that massive particles do not follow geodesics, while trajectories of\nmassless particles are null geodesics of an effective metric. Then we study the\nCosmological case, where we get an accelerated expansion of the Universe\nwithout dark energy.\n", "  The electric field in the vicinity of the top of an emitter with a profile\nconsisting of a triangular protrusion on an infinite line is analytically\nobtained when this system is under an external uniform electric field. The same\nproblem is also studied when the profile features a two-stage system,\nconsisting of a triangular protrusion centered on the top of a rectangular one\non a line. These problems are approached by using a Schwarz-Christoffel\nconformal mapping, and the validity of Schottky's conjecture (SC) is discussed.\nThe authors provide an analytical proof of SC when the dimensions of the\nupper-stage structure are much smaller than those of the lower-stage structure,\nfor large enough aspect ratios and considering that the field enhancement\nfactor (FEF) of the rectangular structure is evaluated on the center of the top\nof the structure, while the FEF of the triangular stage is evaluated near the\nupper corner of the protrusion. The numerical solution of our exact equations\nshows that SC may remain valid even when both stages feature dimensions of the\nsame order of magnitude, reinforcing the validity of SC for multistage field\nemitters.\n", "  Light-matter interaction in two-dimension photonic materials allows for\nconfinement and control of free-space radiation on sub-wavelength scales. Most\nnotably, the van der Waals heterostructure obtained by stacking graphene (G)\nand hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) can provide for hybrid hyperbolic plasmon\nphonon-polaritons (HP3). Here, we present a polariton diode effect and low-bias\ncontrol of HP3 modes confined in G-hBN. Using broadband infrared synchrotron\nradiation coupled to a scattering-type near-field optical microscope, we launch\nHP3 waves over both hBN Reststrahlen bands and observe the unidirectional\npropagation of HP3 modes at in-plane heterointerfaces associated with the\ntransition between different substrate dielectrics. By electric gating we\nfurther control the HP3 hybridization modifying the coupling between the\ncontinuum graphene plasmons and the discrete hyperbolic phonon polaritons of\nhBN as described by an extended Fano model. This is the first demonstration of\nunidirectional control of polariton propagation, with break in\nreflection/transmission symmetry for HP3 modes. G-hBN and related hyperbolic\nmetamaterial nanostructures can therefore provide the basis for novel logic\ndevices of on-chip nano-optics communication and computing.\n", "  We consider the model of modified gravity with dynamical torsion. This model\nwas previously found to have promising stability properties about various\nbackgrounds. Here we study the stability of linear perturbations about the\nself-accelerating solution. We apply the $(3 + 1)$-decomposition and consider\nthe scalar sector of perturbations. We find that the number of degrees of\nfreedom is equal to 2, which is the same as in Minkowski background. However,\nthere is at least one instability in the scalar sector, if the value of\nbackground torsion is large enough. This does not rule out the possibility of\nstable self-acceleration with torsion of the order of the effective\ncosmological constant.\n", "  Projection operators are central to the algebraic formulation of quantum\ntheory because both wavefunction and hermitian operators(observables) have\nspectral decomposition in terms of the spectral projections. Projection\noperators are hermitian operators which are idempotents also. We call them\nquantum idempotents. They are also important for the conceptual understanding\nof quantum theory because projection operators also represent observation\nprocess on quantum system. In this paper we explore the algebra of quantum\nidempotents and show that they generate Iterant algebra (defined in the paper),\nLie algebra, Grassmann algebra and Clifford algebra which is very interesting\nbecause these later algebras were introduced for the geometry of spaces and\nhence are called geometric algebras. Thus the projection operator\nrepresentation gives a new meaning to these geometric algebras in that they are\nalso underlying algebras of quantum processes and also they bring geometry\ncloser to the quantum theory. It should be noted that projection operators not\nonly make lattices of quantum logic but they also span projective geometry. We\nwill give iterant representations of framed braid group algebras, parafermion\nalgebras and the $su(3)$ algebra of quarks. These representations are very\nstriking because iterant algebra encodes the spatial and temporal aspects of\nrecursive processes. In that regard our representation of these algebras for\nphysics opens up entirely new perspectives of looking at fermions,spins and\nparafermions(anyons).\n", "  Generating anatomically realistic three-dimensional (3D) models of the human\nsinonasal cavity for numerical investigations of sprayed drug transport\npresents a host of methodological ambiguities. For example, subject-specific\nradiographic images used for 3D reconstructions typically exclude spray\nbottles. Subtracting a bottle contour from the 3D airspace and dilating the\nanterior nasal vestibule for nozzle placement augment the complexity of\nmodel-building. So, we explored the question: how essential are these steps to\nadequately simulate nasal airflow and identify the optimal delivery conditions\nfor intranasal sprays? In particular, we focused on particle deposition\npatterns in the maxillary sinus, a critical target site for chronic\nrhinosinusitis (CRS). The models were reconstructed from post-surgery computed\ntomography scans for a 39-year-old Caucasian male, with CRS history.\nInspiratory airflow patterns during resting breathing are reliably tracked\nthrough CFD-based steady state laminar-viscous modeling and such regimes\nportray relative lack of sensitivity to inlet perturbations. Consequently, we\nhypothesized that the posterior airflow transport and the particle deposition\ntrends should not be radically affected by the nozzle subtraction and\nvestibular dilation. The study involved 1 base model and 2 derived models; the\nlatter two with nozzle contours (two different orientations) subtracted from\nthe dilated anterior segment of the left vestibule. We analyzed spray transport\nin the left maxillary sinus for multiple release conditions. Similar release\npoints, localized on an approximately 2mm-by-4.5mm contour, facilitated\nimproved maxillary deposition in all three test cases. This suggests functional\nredundancy of nozzle insertion in a 3D numerical model for identifying the\noptimal spray release locations.\n", "  We study the spatio-temporal instability generated by a universal unstable\nattractor in normal dispersion graded-index multimode fiber (GRIN MMF) for\nfemtosecond pulses. Our results present the generation of geometric parametric\ninstability (GPI) sidebands with ultrashort input pulse for the first time.\nObserved GPI sidebands are 91 THz detuned from the pump wavelength, 800 nm.\nDetailed analysis carried out numerically by employing coupled-mode pulse\npropagation model including optical shock and Raman nonlinearity terms. A\nsimplified theoretical model and numerically calculated spectra are\nwell-aligned with experimental results. For input pulses of 200-fs duration,\nformation and evolution of GPI are shown in both spatial and temporal domains.\nThe spatial intensity distribution of the total field and GPI sidebands are\ncalculated. Numerically and experimentally obtained beam shapes of first GPI\nfeatures a Gaussian-like beam profile. Our numerical results verify the unique\nfeature of GPI and generated sidebands preserve their inherited spatial\nintensity profile from the input pulse for different propagation distances\nparticularly for focused and spread the total field inside the GRIN MMF.\n", "  A large class of spherically symmetric static extremal black hole spacetimes\npossesses a stable null photon sphere on their horizons. For the extremal\nKerr-Newman family, the photon sphere only really coincides with the horizon in\nthe sense clarified by Doran. The condition under which photon orbit is stable\non an asymptotically flat extremal Kerr-Newman black hole horizon has recently\nbeen clarified; it is found that a sufficiently large angular momentum\ndestabilizes the photon orbit, whereas electrical charge tends to stabilize it.\nWe investigated the effect of a negative cosmological constant on this\nobservation, and found the same behavior in the case of an extremal\nasymptotically Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes in (3+1)-dimensions. In\n(2+1)-dimensions, in the presence of electrical charge, the angular momentum\nnever becomes large enough to destabilize the photon orbit. We comment on the\ninstabilities of black hole spacetimes with a stable photon orbit.\n", "  Bulk single crystals of manganese phosphide (MnP) were grown from melt at 1\nGPa and 1200 C by using a cubic-anvil, high-pressure, and high-temperature\ntechnique. The obtained black colored crystals exhibit a plate-like morphology,\nwith flat surfaces and maximum dimensions up to 4 x 2 x 0.5 mm3. The\northorhombic crystal structure was confirmed by X-ray diffraction [Pnma, 62, Z\n= 4, a = 5.2510(4) {\\AA}, b = 3.1670(3) {\\AA}, c = 5.90098 (4) {\\AA} and V =\n98.279(14) {\\AA}3]. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements reveal the\noccurrence of two successive transitions: a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic\ntransition at Tc = 290.5 K and the development of a double helimagnetic order\nat Ts = 44.5 K. Zero-field 31P NMR measurements in the FM and in the screw-spin\nAFM state show prominent features, which are compared with previous\nexperimental data and theoretical calculations. The relatively large crystals\nobtained here open up new possibilities for further explorations of this\ninteresting material.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the radio burst signals from three kinds of\nstructures of superconducting cosmic strings. By taking into account the\nobservational factors including scattering and relativistic effects, we derive\nthe event rate of radio bursts as a function of redshift with the theoretical\nparameters $G\\mu$ and $\\mathcal{I}$ of superconducting strings. Our analyses\nshow that cusps and kinks may have noticeable contributions to the event rate\nand in most cases cusps would dominate the contribution, while the kink-kink\ncollisions tend to have secondary effects. By fitting theoretical predictions\nwith the normalized data of fast radio bursts, we for the first time constrain\nthe parameter space of superconducting strings and report that the parameter\nspace of $G\\mu \\sim [10^{-14}, 10^{-12}]$ and $\\mathcal{I} \\sim [10^{-1},\n10^{2}] ~ \\rm{GeV}$ fit the observation well although the statistic\nsignificance is low due to the lack of observational data. Moreover, we derive\ntwo types of best fittings, with one being dominated by cusps with a redshift\n$z = 1.3$, and the other dominated by kinks at the range of the maximal event\nrate.\n", "  Dynamical properties of two bosonic quantum walkers in a one-dimensional\nlattice are studied theoretically. Depending on the initial state,\ninteractions, lattice tilting, and lattice disorder, whole plethora of\ndifferent behaviors are observed. Particularly, it is shown that two bosons\nsystem manifests the many-body localization like behavior in the presence of a\nquenched disorder. The whole analysis is based on a specific decomposition of\nthe temporal density profile into different contributions from singly and\ndoubly occupied sites. In this way, the role of interactions is extracted.\nSince the contributions can be directly measured in experiments with ultra-cold\natoms in optical lattices, the predictions presented may have some importance\nfor upcoming experiment.\n", "  Designing protocols to dynamically direct the self-assembly of colloidal\nparticles has become an important direction in soft matter physics because of\nthe promising applications in fabrication of dynamic responsive functional\nmaterials. Here using computer simulations, we found that in the mixture of\npassive colloids and eccentric self-propelled active particles, when the\neccentricity and self-propulsion of active particles are high enough, the\neccentric active particles can push passive colloids to form a large dense\ndynamic cluster, and the system undergoes a novel dynamic demixing transition.\nOur simulations show that the dynamic demixing occurs when the eccentric active\nparticles move much faster than the passive particles such that the dynamic\ntrajectories of different active particles can overlap with each other while\npassive particles are depleted from the dynamic trajectories of active\nparticles. Our results suggest that this is in analogy to the entropy driven\ndemixing in colloid-polymer mixtures, in which polymer random coils can overlap\nwith each other while deplete the colloids. More interestingly, we find that by\nfixing the passive colloid composition at certain value, with increasing the\ndensity, the system undergoes an intriguing re-entrant mixing, and the demixing\nonly occurs within certain intermediate density range. This suggests a new way\nof designing active matter to drive the self-assembly of passive colloids and\nfabricate dynamic responsive materials.\n", "  Hybrid functionals' non-local exchange-correlation potential contains a\nderivative discontinuity that improves on standard semi-local density\nfunctional theory (DFT) band gaps. Moreover, by careful parameterization,\nhybrid functionals can provide self-interaction reduced description of selected\nstates. On the other hand, the uniform description of all the electronic states\nof a given system is a know drawback of these functionals that causes varying\naccuracy in the description of states with different degrees of localization.\nThis limitation can be remedied by the orbital dependent exact exchange\nextension of hybrid functionals; the hybrid-DFT+V$_w$ method [V. Iv{\\'a}dy, et\nal., Phys. Rev. B 90, 035146 (2014)]. Based on the analogy of quasi-particle\nequations and hybrid-DFT single particle equations, here we demonstrate that\nparameters of hybrid-DFT+V$_w$ functional can be determined from approximate\nquasi-particle spectra. The proposed technique leads to a reduction of\nself-interaction and provides improved description for both $s$ / $p$ and $d$ /\n$f$-electrons of the simulated system. The performance of our charge\nself-consistent method is illustrated on the electronic structure calculation\nof cerium dioxide where good agreement with both quasi-particle and\nexperimental spectra is achieved.\n", "  We consider the simulation of a quantum channel by two parties who share a\nresource state and may apply local operations assisted by classical\ncommunication (LOCC). One specific type of such LOCC is standard teleportation,\nwhich is however limited to the simulation of Pauli channels. Here we show how\nwe can easily enlarge this class by means of a minimal perturbation of the\nteleportation protocol, where we introduce noise in the classical communication\nchannel between the remote parties. By adopting this noisy protocol, we provide\na necessary condition for simulating a non-Pauli channel. In particular, we\ncharacterize the set of channels that are generated assuming the Choi matrix of\nan amplitude damping channel as a resource state. Within this set, we identify\na class of Pauli-damping channels for which we bound the two-way quantum and\nprivate capacities.\n", "  In a fluid subject to a magnetic field the viscous stress tensor has a\ndissipationless antisymmetric component controlled by the so-called Hall\nviscosity. We here propose an all-electrical scheme that allows a determination\nof the Hall viscosity of a two-dimensional electron liquid in a solid-state\ndevice.\n", "  We present a new technique to infer dust locations towards reddened Type Ia\nsupernovae and to help discriminate between an interstellar and a circumstellar\norigin for the observed extinction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that\nthe time-evolution of the light-curve shape and especially of the colour excess\n\\ebv~places strong constraints on the distance between dust and the supernova.\nWe apply our approach to two highly-reddened Type Ia supernovae for which dust\ndistance estimates are available in the literature: SN 2006X and SN 2014J. For\nthe former, we obtain a time-variable $E(B-V)$ and from this derive a distance\nof $27.5^{+9.0}_{-4.9}$ or $22.1^{+6.0}_{-3.8}$ pc depending on whether dust\nproperties typical of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) or the Milky Way (MW)\nare used. For the latter, instead, we obtain a constant $E(B-V)$ consistent\nwith dust at distances larger than 50 and 38 pc for LMC$-$ and MW$-$type dust,\nrespectively. Values thus extracted are in excellent agreement with previous\nestimates for the two supernovae. Our findings suggest that dust responsible\nfor the extinction towards these supernovae is likely to be located within\ninterstellar clouds. We also discuss how other properties of reddened Type Ia\nsupernovae $-$ such as their peculiar extinction and polarization behaviour and\nthe detection of variable, blue-shifted sodium features in some of these events\n$-$ might be compatible with dust and gas at interstellar-scale distances.\n", "  We investigate the Collins azimuthal asymmetry of hadrons produced inside\njets in transversely polarized proton-proton collisions. Recently, the quark\ntransversity distributions and the Collins fragmentation functions have been\nextracted within global analyses from data of the processes semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering and electron-positron annihilation. We calculate the\nCollins azimuthal asymmetry for charged pions inside jets using these\nextractions for RHIC kinematics at center-of-mass energies of 200 and 500 GeV.\nWe compare our results with recent data from the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and\nfind good agreement, which confirms the universality of the Collins\nfragmentation functions. In addition, we further explore the impact of\ntransverse momentum dependent evolution effects.\n", "  Plastic scintillators detectors (PSDs) have been studied as dosimeters, since\nthey provide a cost-effective alternative to conventional ionization chambers.\nMeasurement and analysis of energy dependency were performed on a Siemens\nMammomat tomograph for two different peak kilovoltages: 26 kV and 35 kV. Both\nPSD displayed good linearity for each energy considered and almost no energy\ndependence.\n", "  Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we systematically\nstudy the doping dependence of the crossover from one to two dimensions and its\nimpact on the magnetic properties of the Hubbard model. A square lattice of\nchains is used, in which the dimensionality can be tuned by varying the\ninterchain coupling $t_\\perp$. The dynamical spin structure factor and static\nquantities, such as the static spin susceptibility and nearest-neighbor spin\ncorrelation function, are characterized in the one- and two-dimensional limits\nas a benchmark. When the dimensionality is tuned between these limits, the\nmagnetic properties, while evolving smoothly from one to two dimensions,\ndrastically change regardless of the doping level. This suggests that the spin\nexcitations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, even in the heavily doped\ncase, cannot be explained using the spinon picture known from one dimension.\nThe DQMC calculations are complemented by cluster perturbation theory studies\nto form a more complete picture of how the crossover occurs as a function of\ndoping and how doped holes impact magnetic order.\n", "  We study the charge transfer dynamics following the formation of a phase or\nvoltage biased su- perconducting nano-junction using a full counting statistics\nanalysis. We demonstrate that the evolution of the zeros of the generating\nfunction allows one to identify the population of different many body states\nmuch in the same way as the accumulation of Yang-Lee zeros of the partition\nfunction in equilibrium statistical mechanics is connected to phase\ntransitions. We give an exact expression connecting the dynamical zeros to the\ncharge transfer cumulants and discuss when an approximation based on \"dominant\"\nzeros is valid. We show that, for generic values of the parameters, the system\ngets trapped into a metastable state characterized by a non-equilibrium\npopulation of the many body states which is dependent on the initial\nconditions. We study in particular the effect of the switching rates in the\ndynamics showing that, in contrast to intuition, the deviation from thermal\nequilibrium increases for the slower rates. In the voltage biased case the\nsteady state is reached independently of the initial conditions. Our method\nallows us to obtain accurate results for the steady state current and noise in\nquantitative agreement with steady state methods developed to describe the\nmultiple Andreev reflections regime. Finally, we discuss the system dynamics\nafter a sudden voltage drop showing the possibility of tuning the many body\nstates population by an appropriate choice of the initial voltage, providing a\nfeasible experimental way to access the quench dynamics and control the state\nof the system.\n", "  A precessing spin observed in a rotating frame of reference appears\nfrequency-shifted, an effect analogous to the precession of a Foucault pendulum\nobserved on the rotating Earth. This frequency shift can be understood as\narising from a magnetic pseudo-field in the rotating frame that nevertheless\nhas physically significant consequences, such as the Barnett effect. Detecting\nthese pseudo-fields is experimentally challenging, as a rotating-frame sensor\nis required. Previous work has realised classical rotating-frame detectors.\nHere we use quantum sensors, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres, in a rapidly\nrotating diamond to detect pseudo-fields in the rotating frame. While\nconventional magnetic fields induce precession at a rate proportional to the\ngyromagnetic ratio, rotation shifts the precession of all spins equally, and\nthus primarily affect nearby $^{13}$C nuclear spins. We are thus able to\nexplore these effects via quantum sensing in a rapidly rotating frame, and\ndefine a new approach to quantum control using rotationally-induced nuclear\nspin-selective magnetic fields. This work provides an integral step towards\nrealising precision rotation sensing and quantum spin gyroscopes.\n", "  We have investigated the mechanism at the origin of the infra-red radiation\nemitted by a biased tunnel junction by detecting photons at frequencies\n$\\nu<eV/h$. To address this regime, the bias voltage $V$ exceeds one volt and\nthe potential profile of the tunnel barrier is driven far from its equilibrium\nstate. As a consequence, the $I(V)$ characteristic of the junction is strongly\nnonlinear. At optical frequencies, the transport through the junction cannot be\nsimply expressed in term of the dc current and the current fluctuations are no\nlonger described by the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Taking into account\nthe energy and voltage dependence of the transmission of the tunnel junction in\na Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker scattering approach, we experimentally demonstrate that\nthe photon emission results from the fluctuations of the current inside the\ntunneling barrier.\n", "  Tidal gravitational forces can modify the shape of galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies, thus correlating their orientation with the surrounding matter\ndensity field. We study the dependence of this phenomenon, known as intrinsic\nalignment (IA), on the mass of the dark matter haloes that host these bright\nstructures, analysing the Millennium and Millennium-XXL $N$-body simulations.\nWe closely follow the observational approach, measuring the halo position-halo\nshape alignment and subsequently dividing out the dependence on halo bias. We\nderive a theoretical scaling of the IA amplitude with mass in a dark matter\nuniverse, and predict a power-law with slope $\\beta_{\\mathrm{M}}$ in the range\n$1/3$ to $1/2$, depending on mass scale. We find that the simulation data agree\nwith each other and with the theoretical prediction remarkably well over three\norders of magnitude in mass, with the joint analysis yielding an estimate of\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.36^{+0.01}_{-0.01}$. This result does not depend on\nredshift or on the details of the halo shape measurement. The analysis is\nrepeated on observational data, obtaining a significantly higher value,\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{M}} = 0.56^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. There are also small but\nsignificant deviations from our simple model in the simulation signals at both\nthe high- and low-mass end. We discuss possible reasons for these\ndiscrepancies, and argue that they can be attributed to physical processes not\ncaptured in the model or in the dark matter-only simulations.\n", "  Third order anharmonic scattering in light-matter systems can drive a wide\nvariety of practical and physically interesting processes from lasing to\npolariton condensation. Motivated by recent experimental results in the\nnonlinear optics of localised phonon polaritons, in this Letter we develop a\nquantum theory capable of describing four-wave mixing in arbitrarily\ninhomogeneous photonic environments. Using it we investigate Kerr\nself-interaction and parametric scattering of surface and localised phonon\npolaritons, showing both processes to be within experimental reach.\n", "  We study the return probability and its imaginary ($\\tau$) time continuation\nafter a quench from a domain wall initial state in the XXZ spin chain, focusing\nmainly on the region with anisotropy $|\\Delta|< 1$. We establish exact Fredholm\ndeterminant formulas for those, by exploiting a connection to the six vertex\nmodel with domain wall boundary conditions. In imaginary time, we find the\nexpected scaling for a partition function of a statistical mechanical model of\narea proportional to $\\tau^2$, which reflects the fact that the model exhibits\nthe limit shape phenomenon. In real time, we observe that in the region\n$|\\Delta|<1$ the decay for large times $t$ is nowhere continuous as a function\nof anisotropy: it is either gaussian at root of unity or exponential otherwise.\nAs an aside, we also determine that the front moves as $x_{\\rm\nf}(t)=t\\sqrt{1-\\Delta^2}$, by analytic continuation of known arctic curves in\nthe six vertex model. Exactly at $|\\Delta|=1$, we find the return probability\ndecays as $e^{-\\zeta(3/2) \\sqrt{t/\\pi}}t^{1/2}O(1)$. It is argued that this\nresult provides an upper bound on spin transport. In particular, it suggests\nthat transport should be diffusive at the isotropic point for this quench.\n", "  The Bethe-Salpeter equation for two-body bound system with spin $1/2$\nconstituent is addressed directly in the Minkowski space. In order to\naccomplish this aim we use the Nakanishi integral representation of the\nBethe-Salpeter amplitude and exploit the formal tool represented by the exact\nprojection onto the null-plane. This formal step allows one i) to deal with\nend-point singularities one meets and ii) to find stable results, up to\nstrongly relativistic regimes, that settles in strongly bound systems. We apply\nthis technique to obtain the numerical dependence of the binding energies upon\nthe coupling constants and the light-front amplitudes for a fermion-fermion\n$0^+$ state with interaction kernels, in ladder approximation, corresponding to\nscalar-, pseudoscalar- and vector boson exchanges, respectively. After\ncompleting the numerical survey of the previous cases, we extend our approach\nto a quark-antiquark system in $0^-$ state, taking both constituent-fermion and\nexchanged boson masses, from lattice calculations. Interestingly, the\ncalculated light-front amplitudes for such a mock pion show peculiar signatures\nof the spin degrees of freedom.\n", "  Dysphagia affects 590 million people worldwide and increases risk for\nmalnutrition. Pureed food may reduce choking, however preparation differences\nimpact nutrient density making quality assurance necessary. This paper is the\nfirst study to investigate the feasibility of computational pureed food\nnutritional density analysis using an imaging system. Motivated by a\ntheoretical optical dilution model, a novel deep neural network (DNN) was\nevaluated using 390 samples from thirteen types of commercially prepared purees\nat five dilutions. The DNN predicted relative concentration of the puree sample\n(20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% initial concentration). Data were captured using\nsame-side reflectance of multispectral imaging data at different polarizations\nat three exposures. Experimental results yielded an average top-1 prediction\naccuracy of 92.2+/-0.41% with sensitivity and specificity of 83.0+/-15.0% and\n95.0+/-4.8%, respectively. This DNN imaging system for nutrient density\nanalysis of pureed food shows promise as a novel tool for nutrient quality\nassurance.\n", "  We demonstrate full charge control, narrow optical linewidths, and optical\nspin pumping on single self-assembled InGaAs quantum dots embedded in a\n$162.5\\,\\text{nm}$ thin diode structure. The quantum dots are just\n$88\\,\\text{nm}$ from the top GaAs surface. We design and realize a p-i-n-i-n\ndiode that allows single-electron charging of the quantum dots at close-to-zero\napplied bias. In operation, the current flow through the device is extremely\nsmall resulting in low noise. In resonance fluorescence, we measure optical\nlinewidths below $2\\,\\mu\\text{eV}$, just a factor of two above the transform\nlimit. Clear optical spin pumping is observed in a magnetic field of\n$0.5\\,\\text{T}$ in the Faraday geometry. We present this design as ideal for\nsecuring the advantages of self-assembled quantum dots -- highly coherent\nsingle photon generation, ultra-fast optical spin manipulation -- in the thin\ndiodes required in quantum nano-photonics and nano-phononics applications.\n", "  We present a generic model of (non-destructive) quantum measurement. Being\nformulated within reversible quantum mechanics, the model illustrates a\nmechanism of a measurement process --- a transition of the measured system to\nan eigenstate of the measured observable. The model consists of a two-level\nsystem $\\mu$ interacting with a larger system $A$, consisting of smaller\nsubsystems. The interaction is modelled as a scattering process. Restricting\nthe states of $A$ to product states leads to a bifurcation process: In the\nlimit of a large system $A$, the initial states of $A$ that are efficient in\nleading to a final state are divided into two separated subsets. For each of\nthese subsets, $\\mu$ ends up in one of the eigenstates of the measured\nobservable. The probabilities obtained in this branching confirm the Born rule.\n", "  Precise knowledge of the static density response function (SDRF) of the\nuniform electron gas (UEG) serves as key input for numerous applications, most\nimportantly for density functional theory beyond generalized gradient\napproximations. Here we extend the configuration path integral Monte Carlo\n(CPIMC) formalism that was previously applied to the spatially uniform electron\ngas to the case of an inhomogeneous electron gas by adding a spatially periodic\nexternal potential. This procedure has recently been successfully used in\npermutation blocking path integral Monte Carlo simulations (PB-PIMC) of the\nwarm dense electron gas [Dornheim \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. E in press,\narXiv:1706.00315], but this method is restricted to low and moderate densities.\nImplementing this procedure into CPIMC allows us to obtain exact finite\ntemperature results for the SDRF of the electron gas at \\textit{high to\nmoderate densities} closing the gap left open by the PB-PIMC data. In this\npaper we demonstrate how the CPIMC formalism can be efficiently extended to the\nspatially inhomogeneous electron gas and present the first data points.\nFinally, we discuss finite size errors involved in the quantum Monte Carlo\nresults for the SDRF in detail and present a solution how to remove them that\nis based on a generalization of ground state techniques.\n", "  We analyze the time evolution of citations acquired by articles from journals\nof the American Physical Society (PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE and PRL). The\nobserved change over time in the number of papers published in each journal is\nconsidered an exogenously caused variation in citability that is accounted for\nby a normalization. The appropriately inflation-adjusted citation rates are\nfound to be separable into a preferential-attachment-type growth kernel and a\npurely obsolescence-related (i.e., monotonously decreasing as a function of\ntime since publication) aging function. Variations in the empirically extracted\nparameters of the growth kernels and aging functions associated with different\njournals point to research-field-specific characteristics of citation intensity\nand knowledge flow. Comparison with analogous results for the citation dynamics\nof technology-disaggregated cohorts of patents provides deeper insight into the\nbasic principles of information propagation as indicated by citing behavior.\n", "  In this letter, we report precise and robust observational constraints on\ndark matter-dark energy scattering cross section, using the latest data from\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) Planck temperature and polarization, baryon\nacoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements and weak gravitational lensing data\nfrom Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). The scattering\nscenario consists of a pure momentum exchange between the dark components, and\nwe find $\\sigma_d < 10^{-29} \\, {\\rm cm^2}$ at 95\\% CL from the joint analysis\n(CMB + BAO + CFHTLenS), for typical dark matter particle mass of the order 1-10\n${\\rm GeV}/c^2$. We notice that the scattering among the dark components may\ninfluence the growth of large scale structure in the Universe, leaving the\nbackground cosmology unaltered.\n", "  A scintillating bolometer technology based on $^{100}$Mo-enriched lithium\nmolybdate (Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$) crystals has been developed by LUMINEU to\nsearch for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\\nu 2\\beta$) decay of $^{100}$Mo. The\nresults of several low temperature tests at underground environments have\nproved the reproducibility of high detector performance and crystal\nradiopurity: in particular $\\sim$5--6~keV FWHM energy resolution and at least\n9$\\sigma$ rejection of $\\alpha$'s in the vicinity of the $0\\nu 2\\beta$ decay of\n$^{100}$Mo (3034 keV) and below 10~$\\mu$Bq/kg bulk activity of $^{228}$Th and\n$^{226}$Ra. A modest acquired exposure (0.1~kg$\\times$yr) is a limiting factor\nof the LUMINEU experiment sensitivity to the $0\\nu 2\\beta$ decay half-life of\n$^{100}$Mo ($T_{1/2}$ $\\geq$ 0.7$\\times$10$^{23}$ yr at 90\\% C.L.), however the\ntwo-neutrino $2\\beta$ decay has been measured with the best up to-date\naccuracy, $T_{1/2}$ = $\\left[6.92 \\pm 0.06(\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.36(\\mathrm{syst.})\\right] \\times 10^{18}$ yr. The applicability of the\nLUMINEU technology for a tonne-scale $0\\nu 2\\beta$ decay bolometric project\nCUPID is going to be demonstrated by the CUPID-0/Mo experiment with $\\sim$5~kg\nof $^{100}$Mo embedded in forty 0.2~kg Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ scintillating\nbolometers. A first phase of the experiment with twenty Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$\ndetectors is in preparation at the Modane underground laboratory (France) to\nstart by the end of 2017.\n", "  The design of electrically driven quantum dot devices for quantum optical\napplications asks for modeling approaches combining classical device physics\nwith quantum mechanics. We connect the well-established fields of\nsemi-classical semiconductor transport theory and the theory of open quantum\nsystems to meet this requirement. By coupling the van Roosbroeck system with a\nquantum master equation in Lindblad form, we introduce a new hybrid\nquantum-classical modeling approach, which provides a comprehensive description\nof quantum dot devices on multiple scales: It enables the calculation of\nquantum optical figures of merit and the spatially resolved simulation of the\ncurrent flow in realistic semiconductor device geometries in a unified way. We\nconstruct the interface between both theories in such a way, that the resulting\nhybrid system obeys the fundamental axioms of (non-)equilibrium thermodynamics.\nWe show that our approach guarantees the conservation of charge, consistency\nwith the thermodynamic equilibrium and the second law of thermodynamics. The\nfeasibility of the approach is demonstrated by numerical simulations of an\nelectrically driven single-photon source based on a single quantum dot in the\nstationary and transient operation regime.\n", "  An investigation of the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of the\nrecently reported material K4 phosphorus was made in this work. The K4\nphosphorus has been proved to be mechanically and dynamically stable up to 7\nGPa under hydrostatic pressure. We compared the elastic anisotropy, average\nacoustic velocity and Debye temperature of K4 phosphorus at 0 and 7 GPa. The\nideal tensile at large strains of K4 phosphorus was also examined, with the\nresults showing that it would cleave under the tensile strength of 8.5 GPa with\nthe strain of 0.3. In addition, the effect of tensile strain and pressure on\noptical properties and band gap were studied.\n", "  Recent experiments on walking droplets suggest an underlying connection\nbetween fluid dynamics and the quantum mechanics. Such experiments may be used\nto support the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. In this paper we show that\nmany quantum-like features of hydrodynamic excitations can be explained in the\nframework of the parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\n(DNLSE). It is shown that the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (NLSE)\ndescribes the pseudoquantum features of a given pseudoparticle in the Sagdeev\npseudopotential just as the ordinary linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (LSE)\ndescribes the quantum nature of real particles. The NLSE is shown to reduce to\nnonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (NHJE) for the phase function of the complex\nwavefunction. The origin of the wave-particle dual-character in both LSE and\nNLSE is explained and basic similarities between the two models is highlighted.\nIt is shown that many more pseudoquantum effects (yet to be explored) such as\npseudoentanglement, self-interference effect and quantization of pseudoparticle\nenergy are inherent features of classical fluids. Current investigation\nsuggests that emergence of the quantum nature of fluids is independent from\ndynamics of the bouncing droplets or their interactions with the surface waves\ninstantaneously created by them. In contrast to previous suggestions, it is\nremarked that intrinsically nonlinear collective excitations of a fluid can\ndrive any particle even a pseudoparticle to behave quantum mechanically. These\ncollective interactions in hydrodynamic model confirm the important nonlocal\ncharacter (which is a key aspect of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory) of\nall the pseudoquantum phenomena. The recent hydrodynamic quantum analog\nexperiments and extensive new theoretical models may hopefully enable\nphysicists to unlock the decade long hidden mystery of the quantum weirdness.\n", "  We have fabricated and characterized 10,000 and 20,440 pixel Microwave\nKinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) arrays for the Dark-speckle Near-IR\nEnergy-resolved Superconducting Spectrophotometer (DARKNESS) and the MKID\nExoplanet Camera (MEC). These instruments are designed to sit behind adaptive\noptics systems with the goal of directly imaging exoplanets in a 800-1400 nm\nband. Previous large optical and near-IR MKID arrays were fabricated using\nsubstoichiometric titanium nitride (TiN) on a silicon substrate. These arrays,\nhowever, suffered from severe non-uniformities in the TiN critical temperature,\ncausing resonances to shift away from their designed values and lowering usable\ndetector yield. We have begun fabricating DARKNESS and MEC arrays using\nplatinum silicide (PtSi) on sapphire instead of TiN. Not only do these arrays\nhave much higher uniformity than the TiN arrays, resulting in higher pixel\nyields, they have demonstrated better spectral resolution than TiN MKIDs of\nsimilar design. PtSi MKIDs also do not display the hot pixel effects seen when\nilluminating TiN on silicon MKIDs with photons with wavelengths shorter than 1\num.\n", "  As experimentalists explore new opportunities in strong field radiation\noffered by current generation light sources, new theoretical tools become\ninevitable in dealing with the challenging non-linear dynamics that come into\nplay as a result of the increasing laser intensities and the shorter\nwavelengths. While many theoretical studies employ the electric dipole\napproximation for convenience reasons, in the strong-field regime the validity\nof this approximation is questionable. We have made a detailed comparison of\nthe expansion of the retardation term, $e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$ in\nboth Taylor and Rayleigh series multipole approximations with the angle between\nthe radial vector and the direction of propagation chosen arbitrarily to be\n$45^{\\circ}$. It is verified in this paper that the Rayleigh plane-wave\nexpansion provides a larger validity range in comparison to the widely used\nTaylor expansion. We also take note that the Taylor approximated spherical\nBessel functions reproduce the lower limits of the regular spherical Bessel\nfunctions but deviates strongly in the asymptotic region. We conclude that the\nuse of the Rayleigh plane-wave expansion provides the most accurate\ncontribution of any given order of the multipole expansion. The discrepancy in\nthe dipole and non-dipole photoelectron energy spectra as predicted by these\napproximations using short-wavelength intense laser pulses interacting with\nhydrogen atom in its ground state show the importance of the higher-order terms\nabsent in the Taylor expansion.\n", "  We study electrically charged compact stars in the framework of extended\ntheory of gravity (ETG). We assume that the charge density is proportional to\nthe energy density. The polytropic equation of state is chosen to describe the\nstate of the charged perfect fluid. We aim to find the Oppenheimer Volkoff (OV)\nmass limit for charged compact stars. A detailed numerical study is performed.\nWe show the dependence of the mass-radius diagram of the spheres on the values\nof the perturbatif parameter $\\beta$, the polytropic exponent $\\gamma$ and the\ncharge fraction $\\alpha$. Our results are compared with those found in the\nliterature in the case of applying General Relativity (GR).\n", "  The excellent electronic and mechanical properties of graphene allow it to\nsustain very large currents, enabling its incandescence through Joule heating\nin suspended devices. Although interesting scientifically and promising\ntechnologically, this process is unattainable in ambient environment, because\ngraphene quickly oxidises at high temperatures. Here, we take the performance\nof graphene-based incandescent devices to the next level by encapsulating\ngraphene with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Remarkably, we found that the hBN\nencapsulation provides an excellent protection for hot graphene filaments even\nat temperatures well above 2000 K. Unrivalled oxidation resistance of hBN\ncombined with atomically clean graphene/hBN interface allows for a stable light\nemission from our devices in atmosphere for many hours of continuous operation.\nFurthermore, when confined in a simple photonic cavity, the thermal emission\nspectrum is modified by a cavity mode, shifting the emission to the visible\nrange spectrum. We believe our results demonstrate that hBN/graphene\nheterostructures can be used to conveniently explore the technologically\nimportant high-temperature regime and to pave the way for future optoelectronic\napplications of graphene-based systems.\n", "  The second Gaia data release (DR2) is scheduled for April 2018. While Gaia\nDR1 had increased the number of stars with parallaxes by a factor 20 with\nrespect to the Hipparcos catalogue, Gaia DR2 will bring another factor 500\nincrease, with parallaxes (and proper motions) for more than a billion stars.\nIn addition, Gaia DR2 will deliver improved accuracy and precision for the\nastrometric and photometric data, $G$, $G_\\mathrm{BP}$, $G_\\mathrm{RP}$\nmagnitudes, radial velocities, identification and characterisation of variable\nstars and asteroids as well as stellar parameters for stars down to $G = 17$\nmag. On behalf of the teams of the Gaia-DPAC consortium, these proceedings give\na foretaste of Gaia DR2, 6 months before the release.\n", "  We review the status of cooling techniques aimed at achieving the deepest\nquantum degeneracy for atomic Fermi gases. We first discuss some physical\nmotivations, providing a quantitative assessment of the need for deep quantum\ndegeneracy in relevant physics cases, such as the search for unconventional\nsuperfluid states. Attention is then focused on the most widespread technique\nto reach deep quantum degeneracy for Fermi systems, sympathetic cooling of\nBose-Fermi mixtures, organizing the discussion according to the specific\nspecies involved. Various proposals to circumvent some of the limitations on\nachieving the deepest Fermi degeneracy, and their experimental realizations,\nare then reviewed. Finally, we discuss the extension of these techniques to\noptical lattices and the implementation of precision thermometry crucial to the\nunderstanding of the phase diagram of classical and quantum phase transitions\nin Fermi gases.\n", "  According to the hierarchical model of galaxy formation underlying our\ncurrent understanding of cosmology, the Milky Way (MW) has continued to accrete\nsmaller-sized dwarf galaxies since its formation. Remnants of this process\nsurround the MW as debris streams and satellite galaxies, and provide\ninformation that is complementary to studies of the Galaxy itself. The\nsatellite system thus has the potential to teach us about the formation and\nevolution of the MW. Can the existence of a narrow, co-rotating plane of\nsatellite galaxies (the Vast Polar Structure, VPOS) put constraints on our\nGalaxy's properties? Are such satellite galaxy planes more narrow around less\nmassive hosts, more abundant around more concentrated hosts, more kinematically\ncoherent around more early-forming halos? To address such questions, we have\nlooked for correlations between properties of satellite galaxy planes fitted to\ncosmological simulations in the ELVIS suite and properties of their host dark\nmatter halos, while accounting for realistic observational biases such as the\nobscuration by the disk of the MW. We find no evidence for strong correlations\nthat would allow conclusions on the host halo properties from the mere\nexistence of the VPOS around our Galaxy.\n", "  A detection of the predicted anticorrelation between 21cm and either Ly-alpha\nor H-alpha from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR) would be a powerful probe of\nthe first galaxies. While 3D intensity maps isolate foregrounds in low\nk_\\parallel modes, infrared surveys cannot yet match the field of view and\nredshift resolution of radio intensity mapping experiments. In contrast, 2D\n(i.e., broad band) infrared intensity maps can be measured with current\nexperiments and are limited by foregrounds instead of photon or thermal noise.\nWe show 2D experiments can measure most of the 3D fluctuation power at k<0.2\nMpc^-1 while preserving its correlation properties. However, we show\nforegrounds pose two challenges: (1) simple geometric effects produce\npercent-level correlations between radio and infrared fluxes, even if their\nluminosities are uncorrelated; and (2) radio and infrared foreground residuals\ncontribute sample variance noise to the cross spectrum. The first challenge\ndemands better foreground masking and subtraction, while the second demands\nlarge fields of view to average away uncorrelated radio and infrared power.\nUsing radio observations from the Murchison Widefield Array and near-infrared\nobservations from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, we set an\nupper limit on residual foregrounds of the 21cm--Ly-alpha cross power spectrum\nat z\\sim7 of \\Delta^2<181 kJy/sr * mK (95\\%) at \\ell\\sim800. We predict levels\nof foreground correlation and sample variance noise in future experiments,\nshowing that higher resolution surveys such as LOFAR, SKA-LOW, and the Dark\nEnergy Survey can start to probe models of the 21cm--Ly\\alpha EOR cross\nspectrum.\n", "  At present, there have been suggested two types of physical mechanism that\nmay facilitate preferential pairing between DNA molecules, with identical or\nsimilar base pair texts, without separation of base pairs. One solely relies on\nbase pair specific patterns of helix distortion being the same on the two\nmolecules, discussed extensively in the past. The other mechanism proposes that\nthere are preferential interactions between base pairs of the same composition.\nWe introduce a model, built on this second mechanism, where both thermal\nstretching and twisting fluctuations are included, as well as the base pair\nspecific helix distortions. Firstly, we consider an approximation for weak\npairing interactions, or short molecules. This yields a dependence of the\nenergy on the square root of the molecular length, which could explain recent\nexperimental data. However, analysis suggests that this approximation is\nno-longer valid at large DNA lengths. In a second approximation, for long\nmolecules, we define two adaptation lengths for twisting and stretching, over\nwhich the pairing interaction can limit the accumulation of helix disorder.\nWhen the pairing interaction is sufficiently strong, both adaptation lengths\nare finite; however, as we reduce pairing strength, the stretching adaptation\nlength remains finite but the torsional one becomes infinite. This second state\npersists to arbitrarily weak values of the pairing strength; suggesting that,\nif the molecules are long enough, the pairing energy scales as length. To probe\ndifferences between the two pairing mechanisms, we also construct a model of\nsimilar form. However, now, pairing between identical sequences solely relies\non the intrinsic helix distortion patterns. Between the two models, we see\ninteresting qualitative differences. We discuss our findings, and suggest new\nwork to distinguish between the two mechanisms.\n", "  We reply to misleading claims made in a comment to our work by Birse and\nMcGovern in arXiv:1708.09341.\n", "  Modification of the hard jet substructure in terms of the Soft Drop jet\ngrooming algorithm observables is studied for three different scenarios of jet\nquenching in a quark-gluon plasma: i) an explicit enhancement of the parton\nsplitting functions, ii) increased soft gluon emissions induced by an in-medium\nvirtuality gain, and iii) energy loss due to a drag force. Despite the fact\nthat first two scenarios both correspond to a radiative energy loss mechanism\nand lead to similar modifications of parton showers, they are shown to have\nvery different impacts on the momentum balance of hard subjets. Simulations for\nheavy-ion collisions based on the second scenario are presented and found to be\nin a good agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  This paper presents a simple model of polarisation rotation in optically thin\nrelativistic jets of blazars. The model is based on the development of helical\n(kink) mode of current-driven instability. A possible explanation is suggested\nfor the observational connection between polarisation rotations and\noptical/gamma-ray flares in blazars, if the current-driven modes are triggered\nby secular increases of the total jet power. The importance of intrinsic\ndepolarisation in limiting the amplitude of coherent polarisation rotations is\ndemonstrated. The polarisation rotation amplitude is thus very sensitive to the\nviewing angle, which appears to be inconsistent with the observational\nestimates of viewing angles in blazars showing polarisation rotations. Overall,\nthere are serious obstacles to explaining large-amplitude polarisation\nrotations in blazars in terms of current-driven kink modes.\n", "  In this work, we generalize the local spin analysis of Clark and Davidson [J.\nChem. Phys. 115(16), 7382 (2001)] for the partitioning of the expectation value\nof the molecular spin square operator, $\\langle S^2 \\rangle$, into atomic\ncontributions, $\\langle S_A \\cdot S_B \\rangle$, to the noncollinear spin case\nin the framework of density functional theory (DFT). We derive the working\nequations and we show applications to the analysis of the noncollinear spin\nsolutions of typical spin-frustrated systems and to the calculation of magnetic\nexchange couplings. In the former case, we employ the triangular H$_3$He$_3$\ntest molecule and a Mn$_3$ complex to show that the local spin analysis\nprovides additional information that complements the standard one-particle spin\npopulation analysis. For the calculation of magnetic exchange couplings,\n$J_{AB}$, we employ the local spin partitioning to extract $\\langle S_A \\cdot\nS_B \\rangle$ as a function of the interatomic spin orientation given by the\nangle $\\theta$. This, combined with the dependence of the electronic energy\nwith $\\theta$, provides a methodology to extract $J_{AB}$ from DFT calculations\nthat, in contrast to conventional energy differences based methods, does not\nrequire the use of $ad-hoc$ $S_A$ and $S_B$ values.\n", "  Artificial Spin Ices are two dimensional arrays of magnetic, interacting\nnano-structures whose geometry can be chosen at will, and whose elementary\ndegrees of freedom can be characterized directly. They were introduced at first\nto study frustration in a controllable setting, to mimic the behavior of spin\nice rare earth pyrochlores, but at more useful temperature and field ranges and\nwith direct characterization, and to provide practical implementation to\ncelebrated, exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics previously devised\nto gain an understanding of degenerate ensembles with residual entropy. With\nthe evolution of nano--fabrication and of experimental protocols it is now\npossible to characterize the material in real-time, real-space, and to realize\nvirtually any geometry, for direct control over the collective dynamics. This\nhas recently opened a path toward the deliberate design of novel, exotic\nstates, not found in natural materials, and often characterized by topological\nproperties. Without any pretense of exhaustiveness, we will provide an\nintroduction to the material, the early works, and then, by reporting on more\nrecent results, we will proceed to describe the new direction, which includes\nthe design of desired topological states and their implications to kinetics.\n", "  Selenium has attracted intensive attention as a promising material candidate\nfor future optoelectronic applications. However, selenium has a strong tendency\nto grow into nanowire forms due to its anisotropic atomic structure, which has\nlargely hindered the exploration of its potential applications. In this work,\nusing a physical vapor deposition method, we have demonstrated the synthesis of\nlarge-size, high-quality 2D selenium nanosheets, the minimum thickness of which\ncould be as thin as 5 nm. The Se nanosheet exhibits a strong in-plane\nanisotropic property, which is determined by angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy.\nBack-gating field-effect transistors based on a Se nanosheet exhibit p-type\ntransport behaviors with on-state current density around 20 mA/mm at Vds = 3 V.\nFour-terminal field effect devices are also fabricated to evaluate the\nintrinsic hole mobility of the selenium nanosheet, and the value is determined\nto be 0.26 cm2 Vs at 300 K. The selenium nanosheet phototransistors show an\nexcellent photoresponsivity of up to 263 A/W, with a rise time of 0.1 s and\nfall time of 0.12 s. These results suggest that crystal selenium as a 2D form\nof a 1D van der Waals solid opens up the possibility to explore device\napplications.\n", "  The thermally-induced structural evolution of silicon- and oxygen-containing\nhydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H:Si:O) was investigated by X-ray\nphotoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, as well as molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. The spectroscopic results indicate that the introduction of Si and\nO in hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) increases the activation energy for\nthe conversion of sp3- to sp2-bonded C. MD simulations indicate that the higher\nthermal stability of a-C:H:Si:O compared to a-C:H derives from the lower\nfraction of strained C-C sp3 bonds in a-C:H:Si:O.\n", "  Electron acceleration by relativistically intense laser beam propagating\nalong a curved surface allows to split softly the accelerated electron bunch\nand the laser beam. The presence of a curved surface allows to switch an\nadiabatic invariant of electrons in the wave instantly leaving the gained\nenergy to the particles. The efficient acceleration is provided by the presence\nof strong transient quasistationary fields in the interaction region and a long\nefficient acceleration length. The curvature of the surface allows to select\nthe accelerated particles and provides their narrow angular distribution. The\nmechanism at work is explicitly demonstrated in theoretical models and\nexperiments.\n", "  The generation of X-rays and {\\gamma}-rays based on synchrotron radiation\nfrom free electrons, emitted in magnet arrays such as undulators, forms the\nbasis of much of modern X-ray science. This approach has the drawback of\nrequiring very high energy, up to the multi-GeV-scale, electron beams, to\nobtain the required photon energy. Due to the limit in accelerating gradients\nin conventional particle accelerators, reaching high energy typically demands\nuse of instruments exceeding 100's of meters in length. Compact, less costly,\nmonochromatic X-ray sources based on very high field acceleration and very\nshort period undulators, however, may revolutionize diverse advanced X-ray\napplications ranging from novel X-ray therapy techniques to active\ninterrogation of sensitive materials, by making them accessible in cost and\nsize. Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach, which\nemploys a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron\nlaser (IFEL), followed by a collision point for inverse Compton scattering\n(ICS), a scheme where a laser is used to provide undulator fields. We present\nan experimental proof-of-principle of this approach, where a TW-class CO2 laser\npulse is split in two, with half used to accelerate a high quality electron\nbeam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction, and the other half acts as an\nelectromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS. These\nresults demonstrate the feasibility of this scheme, which can be joined with\nother techniques such as laser recirculation to yield very compact, high\nbrilliance photon sources, extending from the keV to MeV scale. Furthermore,\nuse of the IFEL acceleration with the ICS interaction produces a train of very\nhigh intensity X-ray pulses, thus also permitting a unique tool that can be\nphase-locked to a laser pulse in frontier pump-probe experimental scenarios.\n", "  We used infrared data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Diviner\nLunar Radiometer Experiment to globally map thermophysical properties of the\nMoon's regolith fines layer. Thermal conductivity varies from\n7.4$\\times$10$^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at the surface, to\n3.4$\\times$10$^{-3}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at depths of $\\sim$1 m, given density\nvalues of 1100 kg m$^{-3}$ at the surface, to 1800 kg m$^{-3}$ at 1-m depth. On\naverage, the scale height of these profiles is $\\sim$7 cm, corresponding to a\nthermal inertia of 55 $\\pm$2 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ at 273 K, relevant\nto the diurnally active near-surface layer, $\\sim$4-7 cm. The\ntemperature-dependence of thermal conductivity and heat capacity leads to a\n$\\sim$2$\\times$ diurnal variation in thermal inertia at the equator. On global\nscales, the regolith fines are remarkably uniform, implying rapid\nhomogenization by impact gardening of this layer on timescales $<$ 1 Gyr.\nRegional and local scale variations show prominent impact features $<$ 1 Gyr\nold, including higher thermal inertia ($>$ 100 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$)\nin the interiors and ejecta of Copernican-aged impact craters, and lower\nthermal inertia ($<$ 50 J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$) within the lunar cold\nspots identified by Bandfield et al. (2014). Observed trends in ejecta thermal\ninertia provide a potential tool for age-dating craters of previously unknown\nage, complementary to the approach suggested by Ghent et al. (2014). Several\nanomalous regions are identified in the global 128 pixels-per-degree maps\npresented here, including a high-thermal inertia deposit near the antipode of\nTycho crater.\n", "  An efficient silicon based light source presents an unreached goal in the\nfield of photonics, due to Silicons indirect electronic band structure\npreventing direct carrier recombination and subsequent photon emission. Here we\nutilize inelastically tunneling electrons to demonstrate an electrically driven\nlight emitting silicon based tunnel junction operating at room temperature. We\nshow that such a junction is a source for plasmons driven by the electrical\ntunnel current. We find that the emission spectrum is not given by the quantum\ncondition where the emission frequency would be proportional to the applied\nvoltage, but the spectrum is determined by the spectral overlap between the\nenergy dependent tunnel current and the modal dispersion of the plasmon.\nExperimentally we find the highest light outcoupling efficiency corresponding\nto the skin depth of the metallic contact of this metal insulator semiconductor\njunction. Distinct from LEDs, the temporal response of this tunnel source is\nnot governed by nanosecond carrier lifetimes known to semiconductors, but\nrather by the tunnel event itself and Heisenbergs uncertainty principle.\n", "  There are increasing evidences that ferroelectric states at the nanoscale can\nexhibit fascinating topological structures including polar vortices and\nskyrmions,akin to those observed in the ferromagnetic systems. Here we report\nthe discovery of a new type of polar topological structure,ordered array of\nnanoscale spirals in the tricolor ferroelectric superlattice system via phase\nfield simulations. This polar spiral structure is composed of fine ordered\nsemivortex arrays with vortex cores forming a wavy distribution. It is\ndemonstrated that this tricolor system has an ultrahigh Curie temperature of\n1000 K and a temperature of 650 K for the phase transformation from spiral\nstructure to inplane orthorhombic domain structure, showing a greatly enhanced\nthermal stability than the recently discovered polar vortex lattices in the\nsuperlattice system. Moreover, the spiral structure has a net inplane\npolarization that could be switched by an experimentally feasible irrotational\ninplane field. The switching process involves a metastable vortex state, and is\nfully reversible.\n", "  We review the observations of dust emission in supernova rem- nants (SNRs)\nand supernovae (SNe). Theoretical calculations suggest that SNe, particularly\ncore-collapse, should make significant quantities of dust, perhaps as much as a\nsolar mass. Observations of extragalactic SNe have yet to find anywhere near\nthis amount, but this may be the result of observa- tional limitations. SN\n1987A, in the process of transitioning from a SN to an SNR, does show signs of\na significant amount of dust forming in its ejecta, but whether this dust will\nsurvive the passage of the reverse shock to be injected into the ISM is\nunknown. IR observations of SNRs have not turned up significant quantities of\ndust, and the dust that is observed is generally swept-up by the forward shock,\nrather than created in the ejecta. Because the shock waves also destroy dust in\nthe ISM, we explore the question of whether SNe might be net destroyers, rather\nthan net creators of dust in the universe.\n", "  We explore the malleability of ultra-small metal nanoparticles by means of ab\ninitio calculations. It is revealed that, when strained, such nanoparticles\nexhibit complex behavior, including bifurcation between slow and fast quakes of\ntheir atomic structure, despite being few-body systems. We show the bifurcation\nto arise from the collapse of the nanoparticle's stiffness and a broken soft\nmode symmetry, and that whether a slow or fast quake occurs can be controlled\nby varying the amplitude of the externally applied strains. We predict that\nwhile energy is released abruptly in a fast quake, surprisingly, it continues\nto build up during a slow quake and that, in common with slow-slip geological\nearthquakes, the slow nanoparticle quake is a silent precursor to a fast\n\"seismic\" quake. We show that electrical conductance and force measurements can\ndetect and distinguish between slow and fast quakes, opening the way for\nexperiments and potential applications of these phenomena.\n", "  Construction and training principles have been proposed and tested for an\nartificial neural network based on metal-oxide thin-film nanostructures\npossessing bipolar resistive switching (memristive) effect. Experimental\nelectronic circuit of neural network is implemented as a double-layer\nperceptron with a weight matrix composed of 32 memristive devices. The network\ntraining algorithm takes into account technological variations of the\nparameters of memristive nanostructures. Despite the limited size of weight\nmatrix the developed neural network model is well scalable and capable of\nsolving nonlinear classification problems.\n", "  Direct and alternating current iontophoresis and electro-osmosis\nmethodologies have provided new methods of transcutaneous drug delivery. A\nbyproduct of such methods is lowering the electrical impedance of the electrode\nto skin contact, as conductive ions permeate the stratum corneum, the primary\nresistive layer of the skin. We developed a method for adapting iontophoresis\nto condition the electrode to skin contact, both for electrophysiological\nrecording and electrical stimulation of body tissues. By utilizing direct\ncurrent to treat electrodes with high impedance we show the effectiveness of\niontopheresis as a driving force for permeation of ionic electrolyte into the\nskin barrier. We applied direct current (DC) levels of 50 {\\mu}A to electrodes\non the human head for 30 seconds with paste (Nihon Kohden Elefix) electrolyte.\nTypically immediately after DC treatment conditioning there was an impedance\ndrop of 10-30%. The effect was lasting over several hours, with the paste\nelectrolyte. These results demonstrate the feasibility of DC conditioning to\nreduce the set time of electrolytic solutions and to maintain good skin contact\nduring extended recording or stimulation sessions.\n", "  Two important problems in studying the quantum black hole, namely the\nconstruction of the Hilbert space and the definition of the time evolution\noperator on such Hilbert space, are discussed using the de Sitter background\nfield method for an observer far from the black hole. This is achieved through\nthe ambient space formalism. Remarkably, in this approximation (distant\nobserver), the theory preserves unitarity and analyticity, it is free from any\ninfrared divergence, and it renders a quantum black hole entropy that turns out\nto be finite.\n", "  Comparative analysis of three stabilization mechanisms of unstable states of\nphysical systems is presented in this review. These mechanisms are: the quantum\nZeno effect, the stabilization of unstable states in an external fast\noscillating field (i.e. the Kapitza pendulum), and the mechanism named as the\nspinning top mechanism. The common features of these mechanisms, as well as the\ndifferences between them, are analyzed in the paper. In particular, it is shown\nthat the stabilization of quantum systems is possible without involvement of\nsuch concept as the collapse of wave function. For stabilization it is\nsufficient to have a stabilizing radiation flow with the Rabi frequency of\ntransitions exceeding some frequency. This frequency is inversely proportional\nto the lifetime of the state under stabilization. It is shown that the Top\nprinciple allows stabilizing unstable systems using affecting only those states\nto which these systems must go over.\n  It is shown that stabilization of unstable states by impact of rapidly\noscillating forces occurs by non-self-consistent exposure, i.e. the dynamics of\nstabilizing field is independent on the dynamics of the stabilized state.\nStabilization using the spinning top principle involves self-consistent forces,\nand thus, in many cases can be the most effective mechanism of stabilization.\n", "  Bolometers are low temperature particle detectors with high energy resolution\nand detection efficiency. Some types of bolometric detectors are also able to\nperform an efficient particle identification. A wide variety of radiopure\ndielectric and diamagnetic materials makes the bolometric technique favorable\nfor applications in astroparticle physics. In particular, thanks to their\nsuperior performance, bolometers play an important role in the world-wide\nefforts on searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay. Such experiments\nstrongly require an extremely low level of the backgrounds that can easily\nmimic the process searched for. Here we overview recent progress in the\ndevelopment of low background techniques for bolometric double-beta decay\nsearches.\n", "  In this work a general framework for damage and fracture assessment including\nthe effect of strain gradients is provided. Both mechanism-based and\nphenomenological strain gradient plasticity (SGP) theories are implemented\nnumerically using finite deformation theory and crack tip fields are\ninvestigated. Differences and similarities between the two approaches within\ncontinuum SGP modeling are highlighted and discussed. Local strain hardening\npromoted by geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) in the vicinity of the\ncrack leads to much higher stresses, relative to classical plasticity\npredictions. These differences increase significantly when large strains are\ntaken into account, as a consequence of the contribution of strain gradients to\nthe work hardening of the material. The magnitude of stress elevation at the\ncrack tip and the distance ahead of the crack where GNDs significantly alter\nthe stress distributions are quantified. The SGP dominated zone extends over\nmeaningful physical lengths that could embrace the critical distance of several\ndamage mechanisms, being particularly relevant for hydrogen assisted cracking\nmodels. A major role of a certain length parameter is observed in the multiple\nparameter version of the phenomenological SGP theory. Since this also dominates\nthe mechanics of indentation testing, results suggest that length parameters\ncharacteristic of mode I fracture should be inferred from nanoindentation.\n", "  The rapid expansion of wind and solar energy leads to an increasing\nvolatility in the electricity generation. Previous studies have shown that\nstorage devices provide an opportunity to balance fluctuations in the power\ngrid. An economical operation of these devices is linked to solutions of\nprobabilistic optimization problems, due to the fact that future generation is\nnot deterministic in general. For this reason, reliable forecast methods as\nwell as appropriate robust optimization algorithms take an increasingly\nimportant role in future power operation systems. Taking an uncertain\navailability of electricity into account, we present a method to calculate\ncost-optimal charging strategies for energy storage units. The proposed method\nsolves subproblems which result from a sliding window approach applied on a\nlinear program by utilizing statistical measures. The prerequisite of this\nmethod is a recently developed fast algorithm for storage-related optimization\nproblems. To present the potential of the proposed method, a Power-To-Heat\nstorage system is investigated as an example using today's available forecast\ndata and a robust statistical measure. Second, the novel approach proposed here\nis compared with a common robust optimization method for stochastic scenario\nproblems. In comparison, the proposed method provides lower acquisition costs,\nespecially for today's available forecasts, and is more robust under\nperturbations in terms of deteriorating predictions, both based on empirical\nanalyses. Furthermore, the introduced approach is applicable to general\ncost-optimal operation problems and also real-time optimization concerning\nuncertain acquisition costs.\n", "  We present a new paradigm for the simulation of arrays of Imaging Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) which overcomes limitations of current approaches.\nUp to now, all major IACT experiments rely on the same Monte-Carlo simulation\nstrategy, using predefined observation and instrument settings. Simulations\nwith varying parameters are generated to provide better estimates of the\nInstrument Response Functions (IRFs) of different observations. However, a\nlarge fraction of the simulation configuration remains preserved, leading to\ncomplete negligence of all related influences. Additionally, the simulation\nscheme relies on interpolations between different array configurations, which\nare never fully reproducing the actual configuration for a given observation.\nInterpolations are usually performed on zenith angles, off-axis angles, array\nmultiplicity, and the optical response of the instrument. With the advent of\nhybrid systems consisting of a large number of IACTs with different sizes,\ntypes, and camera configurations, the complexity of the interpolation and the\nsize of the phase space becomes increasingly prohibitive. Going beyond the\nexisting approaches, we introduce a new simulation and analysis concept which\ntakes into account the actual observation conditions as well as individual\ntelescope configurations of each observation run of a given data set. These\nrun-wise simulations (RWS) thus exhibit considerably reduced systematic\nuncertainties compared to the existing approach, and are also more\ncomputationally efficient and simple. The RWS framework has been implemented in\nthe H.E.S.S. software and tested, and is already being exploited in science\nanalysis.\n", "  Neutron stars are among the most fascinating astrophysical sources, being\ncharacterized by strong gravity, densities about the nuclear one or even above,\nand huge magnetic fields. Their observational signatures can be extremely\ndiverse across the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the periodic and\nlow-frequency signals of radio pulsars, up to the abrupt high-energy gamma-ray\nflares of magnetars, where energies of ~10^46 erg are released in a few\nseconds. Fast-rotating and highly magnetized neutron stars are expected to\nlaunch powerful relativistic winds, whose interaction with the supernova\nremnants gives rise to the non-thermal emission of pulsar wind nebulae, which\nare known cosmic accelerators of electrons and positrons up to PeV energies. In\nthe extreme cases of proto-magnetars (magnetic fields of ~10^15 G and\nmillisecond periods), a similar mechanism is likely to provide a viable engine\nfor the still mysterious gamma-ray bursts. The key ingredient in all these\nspectacular manifestations of neutron stars is the presence of strong magnetic\nfields in their constituent plasma. Here we will present recent updates of a\ncouple of state-of-the-art numerical investigations by the high-energy\nastrophysics group in Arcetri: a comprehensive modeling of the steady-state\naxisymmetric structure of rotating magnetized neutron stars in general\nrelativity, and dynamical 3-D MHD simulations of relativistic pulsar winds and\ntheir associated nebulae.\n", "  The Magellanic Clouds host a large population of massive (> 10^4 Msun) star\nclusters with ages ranging from a few Myr to 12 Gyr. In nearly all cases, close\ninspection of their CMDs reveals features that deviate from expectations of a\nclassic isochrone. Young (< 2 Gyr) clusters show extended main sequence\nturnoffs and in some cases split/dual main sequences. Clusters older than ~ 2\nGyr show splitting in the red giant branches when viewed in UV filters that are\nsensitive to abundance variations (in particular nitrogen). A distribution of\nstellar rotation rates appears to be the cause of the complex features observed\nin the young and intermediate age clusters, while above ~ 2 Gyr the features\nseem to be the same light-element abundance variations as observed in the\nancient Galactic globular clusters, a.k.a. \"multiple populations\". Here, we\nprovide an overview of current observations and their interpretations and\nsummarise possible links between all the classes of complexities, regardless of\nage.\n", "  A simple yet precise optical technique for measuring the ambipolar carrier\nmobility in semiconductors is presented. Using tightly focused Gaussian laser\nbeams in a photo-reflectance system, the modulated reflectance signal is\nmeasured as a function of the Z (longitudinal) displacement of the sample from\nfocus. The modulated component of the reflected probe beam is a Gaussian beam\nwith its profile determined by the focal parameters and the complex diffusion\nlength. The reflected probe beam is collected and input to the detector,\nthereby integrating over the radial profile of the beam. This results in\nanalytic expressions for the Z dependence of the signal in terms of diffusion\nlength and recombination lifetime. Best fit values for the diffusion length and\nrecombination lifetime are obtained via an iterative fitting procedure. The\noutput diffusion lengths and recombination lifetimes and their estimated\nuncertainties are combined according to the Einstein relation to yield the\nmobility and its uncertainty.\n", "  The nonlinear propagation of electrostatic solitary waves is studied in a\ncollisionless electron-positron pair plasma consisting of adiabatic cool\nelectrons, mobile cool positrons (or electron holes), hot suprathermal\nelectrons described by a $\\kappa$ distribution, and stationary ions. The linear\ndispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak\ndependence of the phase speed on physical conditions of positrons in\nappropriate ranges of parameters. The Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is\nused to obtain the existence of electrostatic solitary wave structures,\nfocusing on how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions of\npositrons and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive polarity\nelectrostatic solitary waves are found to exist in different ranges of Mach\nnumbers. As the positrons constitute a small fraction of the total number\ndensity, they slightly affect the existence domains. However, the positrons can\nsignificantly change the wave potential at a fixed soliton speed. The results\nindicate that the positive potential can greatly be grown by increasing the\nelectron suprathermality (lower $\\kappa$) at a fixed true Mach number. It is\nfound that a fraction of positrons maintain the generation of positive polarity\nelectrostatic solitary waves in the presence of suprathermal electrons in pair\nplasmas.\n", "  We present a new Hamiltonian formulation of barotropic Hall\nmagnetohydrodynamics in two complementary approaches based on Dirac's\nconstraint analysis. In one case the Hamiltonian is canonical involving\nphysical variables only but the brackets are noncanonical, while in the other\ncase the phase space is enlarged to retain the canonical structure of brackets.\n", "  IITMSAT is a student-built nano satellite mission of Indian Institute of\nTechnology Madras, Chennai, India. The objective is to study the precipitation\nof high energy electrons and protons from Van-Allen radiation belts to lower\naltitude of 600-900 km due to resonance interaction with low frequency EM\nwaves. The unique communications system design of IITMSAT evolves from the\nchallenging downlink data requirement of 1 MB per day in the UHF band posed by\nthe mission and the satellite's payload, SPEED (Space based Proton and Electron\nEnergy Detector). To ensure continuous downlink data stream in the short Low\nearth Orbit passes, a robust physical layer protocol was designed to counter\ntime-varying aspects of a Space-Earth telecom link. For the on-board\ncommunications system, two types of design alternatives exist for each module.\nThe first option is a custom design wherein a module is developed from scratch\nusing discrete components.The other option is an integrated design wherein an\nelectronics COTS module can be directly plugged into the subsystem. This module\nis evaluated by carrying out vibration and thermal tests. If an integrated\nmodule is low-cost and meets the design requirements, it is preferred over a\ncustom design. In order to carry out performance tests under simulated link\nconditions, an RF attenuation test setup was designed that can work at extreme\ntemperatures. Burn-In tests for 72 hours at ambient and extreme temperatures\nwere carried out. Integrated tests indicate all IITMSAT design requirements\nhave been met. Hence a robust communications system has been validated. The\ntime taken for development of on-board telecom and GS was less than a year and\nwas achieved at a low cost which agrees to a LeanSat approach.\n", "  Our current understanding of the chemistry and mass-loss processes in\nsolar-like stars at the end of their evolution depends critically on the\ndescription of convection, pulsations and shocks in the extended stellar\natmosphere. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere models provide\nobservational predictions, but so far the resolution to constrain the complex\ntemperature and velocity structures seen in the models has been lacking. Here\nwe present submillimeter continuum and line observations that resolve the\natmosphere of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya. We show that hot gas with\nchromospheric characteristics exists around the star. Its filling factor is\nshown to be small. The existence of such gas requires shocks with a cooling\ntime larger than commonly assumed. A shocked hot layer will be an important\ningredient in the models of stellar convection, pulsation and chemistry that\nunderlie our current understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution.\n", "  We identify the correct power counting of all the variables in the low-$q^2$\nwindow of the inclusive decay $\\bar B \\to X_s \\ell^+\\ell^-$ within the\neffective theory SCET if a hadronic mass cut is imposed. Furthermore we analyse\nthe resolved power corrections at the order $1/m_b$ in a systematic way. As a\nspecial feature, the resolved contributions stay nonlocal when the hadronic\nmass cut is released. Therefore they represent an irreducible uncertainty\nindependent of the hadronic mass cut.\n", "  A classical model based on a power law assumption for the radius-time\nrelationship in the expansion of a Supernova (SN) allows to derive an\nanalytical expression for the flow of mechanical kinetic energy and the time\nduration of Gamma-ray burst (GRB). A random process based on the ratio of two\ntruncated lognormal distributions for luminosity and luminosity distance allows\nto derive the statistical distribution for time duration of GRBs. The high\nvelocities involved in the first phase of expansion of a SN requires a\nrelativistic treatment. The circumstellar medium is assumed to follow a density\nprofile of Plummer type with eta=6. A series solution for the relativistic flow\nof kinetic energy allows to derive in a numerical way the duration time for\nGRBs. Here we analyse two cosmologies: the standard cosmology and the plasma\ncosmology.\n", "  Considered are ${\\cal N}=2\\, SU(N_c)$ or $U(N_c)$ SQCD with $N_F<2N_c-1$\nequal mass quark flavors. ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry is softly broken down to\n${\\cal N}=1$ by the mass term $\\mu_{\\rm x}{\\rm Tr}\\,(X^2)$ of colored adjoint\nscalar partners of gluons, $\\mu_{\\rm x}\\ll\\Lambda_2$ ($\\Lambda_2$ is the scale\nfactor of the $SU(N_c)$ gauge coupling).\n  There is a large number of different types of vacua in these theories with\nboth unbroken and spontaneously broken global flavor symmetry,\n$U(N_F)\\rightarrow U({\\rm n}_1)\\times U({\\rm n}_2)$. We consider in this paper\nthe large subset of these vacua with the unbroken non-trivial $Z_{2N_c-N_F\\geq\n2}$ discrete symmetry, at different hierarchies between the Lagrangian\nparameters $m\\gtrless\\Lambda_2,\\,\\, \\mu_{\\rm x}\\gtrless m$. The forms of low\nenergy Lagrangians, charges of light particles and mass spectra are described\nin the main text for all these vacua.\n  The calculations of power corrections to the leading terms of the low energy\nquark and dyon condensates are presented in two important Appendices. The\nresults agree with also presented in these Appendices independent calculations\nof these condensates using roots of the Seiberg-Witten spectral curve. This\nagreement confirms in a non-trivial way a self-consistency of the whole\napproach.\n  Our results differ essentially from corresponding results in e.g. recent\nrelated papers arXiv:1304.0822, arXiv:1403.6086, and arXiv:1704.06201 of\nM.Shifman and A.Yung (and in a number of their previous numerous papers on this\nsubject), and we explain in the text the reasons for these differences. (See\nalso the extended critique of a number of results of these authors in section 8\nof arXiv:1308.5863).\n", "  This survey is a short version of a chapter written by the first two authors\nin the book [A. Henrot, editor. Shape optimization and spectral theory. Berlin:\nDe Gruyter, 2017] (where more details and references are given) but we have\ndecided here to put more emphasis on the role of the Aharonov-Bohm operators\nwhich appear to be a useful tool coming from physics for understanding a\nproblem motivated either by spectral geometry or dynamics of population.\nSimilar questions appear also in Bose-Einstein theory. Finally some open\nproblems which might be of interest are mentioned.\n", "  In this contribution, the results on soft hadron physics concerning the\nunderlying event and Bose-Einsten correlations obtained using data collected in\nproton-proton collisions with the ATLAS experiment are presented.\n", "  Interactions of the uniform mode with higher order modes due to\nincommensurately modulated equilibrium state change the usual relaxation\nbehaviour to a more complex one. A multirelaxation character should be present\neven in the single-plane-wave limit. Our model enables one to describe dynamic\ndielectric response of the incommensurable modulated phases in order-disorder\nsystems.\n", "  We report anomalous critical transport behavior in a GaAs structure\ncontaining a dense array of ErAs quantum dots. The structure displays a voltage\n(electric field)-controlled insulator-to-metal transition and strong hysteresis\nin the Kondo-like current-vs-temperature characteristic, with critical\ntemperatures as high as 50 K. We attribute this behavior to a strong\ndistributed Kondo resonance between the quantum dots after the Coulomb blockade\nof the array is lifted. This is consistent with a high sensitivity of the phase\ntransition to a small external magnetic field that we have observed in the\nVoigt configuration, and a phenomenological model based on the RKKY interaction\nwithin a quantum dot and the cooperative Kondo-resonance amongst quantum dots.\n", "  We propose the generalization of the Fourier modal method aimed at\ncalculating localized eigenmodes of integrated optical resonators. The method\nis based on constructing the analytic continuation of the structure's\nscattering matrix and calculating its poles. The method allows one to calculate\nthe complex frequency of the localized mode and the corresponding field\ndistribution. We use the proposed method to calculate the eigenmodes of\nrectangular dielectric block located on metal surface. We show that excitation\nof these modes by surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) results in resonant features\nin the SPP transmission spectrum. The proposed method can be used to design and\ninvestigate optical properties of integrated and plasmonic optical devices.\n", "  The ALICE Central Trigger Processor (CTP) is going to be upgraded for LHC Run\n3 with completely new hardware and a new Trigger and Timing Control (TTC-PON)\nsystem based on a Passive Optical Network (PON) system. The new trigger system\nhas been designed as dead time free and able to transmit trigger data at 9.6\nGbps. A new universal trigger board has been designed, where by changing the\nFMC card, it can function as a CTP or as a LTU. It is based on the Xilinx\nKintex Ultrascale FPGA and upgraded TTC-PON. The new trigger system and the\nprototype of the trigger board will be presented.\n", "  Motivated by recent realizations of spin-1 NaRb mixtures in the experiments,\nhere we investigate heteronuclear magnetism in the Mott-insulating regime.\nDifferent from the identical mixtures where the boson (fermion) statistics only\nadmits even (odd) parity states from angular momentum composition, for\nheteronuclear atoms in principle all angular momentum states are allowed, which\ncan give rise to new magnetic phases. Various magnetic phases can be developed\nover these degenerate spaces, however, the concrete symmetry breaking phases\ndepend not only on the degree of degeneracy, but also the competitions from\nmany-body interactions. We unveil these rich phases using the bosonic dynamical\nmean-field theory approach. These phases are characterized by various orders,\nincluding spontaneous magnetization order, spin magnitude order, singlet\npairing order and nematic order, which may coexist, especially in the regime\nwith odd parity. Finally we address the possible parameter regimes for\nobserving these spin-ordered Mott phases.\n", "  With automated measurements, large data sets can be assembled with relative\nease. Often these data sets have a large degree of variance. Nonetheless, we\nhope to find groups within the data set with shared distinguishing\ncharacteristics. Recently Albrecht, et al demonstrated a multi-parameter\nvector-based classification analysis which provided a powerful means to find\nclusters within a data set of conductance versus displacement traces measured\nfrom single molecular break junctions (Lemmer, et al, Nature Communications,\n2016, 7, 12922). An idealized blank tunneling trace was used as a reference to\ncalculate three vector variables. The authors suggested a more appropriate\nreference can be chosen to better form clusters in the data. Here we propose\nusing a principal component of the correlation matrix calculated from the data\nset to construct a fast and strategic reference trace. Principal components\nform an orthogonal basis set in units of the independent variables comprising\nthe correlation matrix. The first principal component, the one corresponding to\nthe largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix, points in the direction of\nlargest variance in the data. We used both a blank tunneling reference trace\nand a reference trace constructed from the first principal component of the\ncorrelation matrix to analyze a set of 4,4'-bipyridine single molecular break\njunctions. The blank tunneling reference trace produced a single elongated\ncluster in the vector analysis plot whereas the reference trace constructed\nfrom the principal component distinguished two arms in the cluster. We\nhypothesize that these two arms are due to groups of traces with either long or\nshort molecular plateaus. Statistically based sorting algorithms, like\nvector-based categorization techniques, provide an objective framework to\nformulate such hypothesis and aid in designing new and pointed studies to\nverify them.\n", "  We show that fore-aft asymmetry, a generic feature of living organisms and\nsome active matter systems, can have a strong influence on the collective\nproperties of even the simplest flocking models. Specifically, an arbitrarily\nweak asymmetry favoring front neighbors changes qualitatively the phase diagram\nof the Vicsek model. A region where many sharp traveling band solutions coexist\nis present at low noise strength, below the Toner-Tu liquid, at odds with the\nphase-separation scenario well describing the usual isotropic model. Inside\nthis region, a `banded liquid' phase with algebraic density distribution\ncoexists with band solutions. Linear stability analysis at the hydrodynamic\nlevel suggests that these results are generic and not specific to the Vicsek\nmodel.\n", "  Squaraine dyes (SQs) represent a versatile class of functional molecules with\nstrong absorption and emission features, widely used as near-infrared\nsensitizers in organic and hybrid photovoltaic devices. In this context, the\nphotodynamics of such molecules has been seen to influence dramatically the\nefficiency of the photogeneration process. The most accepted interpretation of\nexcited state deactivation in SQs is represented by a trans-cis\nphotoisomerization around a CC double bond of the polymethinic-like bridge,\nalthough such scenario does not explain satisfyingly the decay route of SQs\ndyes in conformational constrained systems or in highly viscous environments.\nHere we combine steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques with\nhigh level ab initio calculations to shed light into the photophysics of\ncis-locked indolenine-based SQs. Our results point towards alternative\ndeactivation routes, possibly involving a dark state in molecules lacking\ncentral substitution and the rotation of the central substituent in the\ncore-functionalized ones. These novel results can suggest a synthetic rationale\nto design dyes that permit quantitative and effective charge\ngeneration/diffusion and collection in photovoltaic diodes and, thus, enhance\ntheir efficiency.\n", "  We derive exact expressions for the relativistic redshift between an\nEarth-bound observer, that is meant to model a standard clock on the Earth's\nsurface, and various (geodesic) observers in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We\nassume that the observers exchange radial light signals to compare the\nfrequencies of standard clocks, which they transport along their respective\nworldlines. We calculate the redshift between an Earth-bound clock and static\nobservers, observers in radial free fall, on circular geodesics, and on\narbitrary bound quasi-elliptical orbits. For the latter case, we consider as\nexamples an almost circular orbit, the Schwarzschild analog of Galileo\nsatellites 5 orbits with a moderate eccentricity, and a highly elliptical orbit\nas special examples. Furthermore, we also use orbits close to a Schwarzschild\nblack hole to highlight the influence of the relativistic perigee precession on\nthe redshift signal. Calculating a post-Newtonian expansion of our results, the\ntotal redshift is decomposed into its special relativistic Doppler parts and\nthe gravitational part due to the theory of General Relativity. To investigate\nthe impact of higher order relativistic multipole moments on the gravitational\nredshift, we consider static observers in a general Weyl spacetime. We give a\ngeneral expression for the mutual redshift of their standard clocks and\nconsider in particular the effect of the relativistic quadrupole as a\nmodification of the Schwarzschild result.\n", "  We study Picard groups and $K_0$ groups for the cluster algebras that come\nfrom the cluster categories of \\cite{HernandezLeclerc}. This is inspired by a\nstudy of boundaries and defects in the associated spin chains. We also do some\ndiscussion for their formal deformation quantizations.\n", "  In this dissertation we apply the pionless effective field theory to low\nenergy neutron deuteron elastic scattering process. We calculated some of the\npolarization observables in neutron deuteron scattering to\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order, in particular the transverse asymmetry\n$A_y$. All of the previous calculations have the same characteristic feature of\nunder-predicting this observable, this is known as the $A_y$-puzzle. At this\norder of the pionless EFT new two-body $P$-wave interaction terms enter into\nthe Lagrangian. This interaction terms give crucial contributions to the $A_y$\nobservable. By varying the interaction coefficients within the allowed error\nestimates of the pionless EFT we find results that at this order are consistent\nwith the experimental data. Our conclusion is that the $A_y$-puzzle is likely\nto be solved within the next few orders of the \\EFT. Other observables in\nneutron-deuteron scattering process are also calculated and are in good\nagreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Papers on neutrino astronomy (diffuse fluxes and point sources, prepared for\nthe 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea) by\nthe ANTARES Collaboration\n", "  We extend the analysis of boundedness and stability, initiated for scalar\nfields in anti de Sitter space in a previous work, to the case of vector\nfields. We show that the double trace deformation of Marolf and Ross is\ndistinct from the double trace deformation of Witten. The former gives rise to\nan $SL(2,{\\bf R})$ family of theories whereas the latter gives rise to an\nindependent $SL(2,{\\bf Z})$. We analyze the finite temperature two-point\ncorrelation function of current operators and infer the susceptibility and\nspectrum of low lying states. We discuss various physical features exhibited by\nthese theories.\n", "  We analyze data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instruments on board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) to characterize the spatio-temporal acoustic power\ndistribution in active regions as a function of the height in the solar\natmosphere. For this, we use Doppler velocity and continuum intensity observed\nusing the magnetically sensitive line at 6173 \\AA\\ as well as intensity at 1600\n\\AA\\ and 1700 \\AA. We focus on the power enhancements seen around AR 11330 as a\nfunction of wave frequency, magnetic field strength, field inclination and\nobservation height. We find that acoustic halos occur above the acoustic cutoff\nfrequency and extends up to 10 mHz in HMI Doppler and AIA 1700 \\AA\\\nobservations. Halos are also found to be strong functions of magnetic field and\ntheir inclination angle. We further calculate and examine the spatially\naveraged relative phases and cross-coherence spectra and find different wave\ncharacteristics at different heights.\n"]}
