A given quantum walk\ndoes not generally admit a continuous limit but some families (1-jets) of\nquantum walks do. All families (1-jets) admitting a continuous limit are\nidentified. The continuous limit is described by a Dirac-like equation or,\nalternately, a couple of Klein-Gordon equations. Variational principles leading\nto these equations are also discussed, together with local invariance\nproperties.\n", "  A particular family of time- and space-dependent discrete-time quantum walks\n(QWs) is considered in one dimensional physical space. The continuous limit of\nthese walks is defined through a new procedure and computed in full detail. In\nthis limit, the walks coincide with the propagation of a massless Dirac fermion\nin an arbitrary gravitational field. A QW mimicking the radial propagation of a\nfermion outside and inside the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is\nexplicitly constructed and simulated numerically. Finally, the limiting\nprocedure and the main result itself are carefully discussed.\n", "  Expanding the ordinary Dirac's equation in quaternionic form yields\nMaxwell-like field equations. As in the Maxwell's formulation, the particle\nfields are represented by a scalar, $\\psi_0$ and a vector $\\vec{\\psi}$. The\nanalogy with Maxwell's equations requires that the inertial fields are\n$\\vec{E}_D=c^2\\vec{\\alpha}\\times\\vec{\\psi}$, and\n$\\vec{B}_D=\\vec{\\alpha}\\,\\psi_0+c\\beta\\,\\vec{\\psi}$ and that\n$\\psi_0=-c\\beta\\,\\vec{\\alpha}\\cdot\\vec{\\psi}$, where $\\beta$, $\\vec{\\alpha}$\nand $c$ are the Dirac matrices and the speed of light, respectively. An\nalternative solution suggests that magnetic monopole-like behavior accompanies\nDirac's field. In this formulation, a field-like representation of Dirac's\nparticle is derived. It is shown that when the vector field of the particle,\n$\\vec{\\psi}$, is normal to the vector $\\vec{\\alpha}$, Dirac's field represents\na medium with maximal conductivity. The energy flux (Poynting vector) of the\nDirac's fields is found to flow in opposite direction to the particle's motion.\nA system of equivalently symmetrized Maxwell's equations is introduced. A\nlongitudinal (scalar) wave traveling at speed of light is found to accompany\nmagnetic charges flow. This wave is not affected by presence of electric\ncharges and currents. The Lorentz boost transformations of the matter fields\nare equivalent to $c\\vec{\\psi}\\,'\n=c\\vec{\\psi}\\pm\\beta\\vec{\\alpha}\\,\\psi_0\\,,\\psi_0\\,'=\\psi_0\\mp\nc\\beta\\vec{\\alpha}\\cdot\\vec{\\psi}\\,.$\n", "  Symbolic methods of umbral nature play an important and increasing role in\nthe theory of special functions and in related fields like combinatorics. We\ndiscuss an application of these methods to the theory of lacunary generating\nfunctions for the Laguerre polynomials for which we give a number of new closed\nform expressions. We present furthermore the different possibilities offered by\nthe method we have developed, with particular emphasis on their link to a new\nfamily of special functions and with previous formulations, associated with the\ntheory of quasi monomials.\n", "  In the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has been\nrevolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were\n1,000 times more abundant in the early Universe than at present. It has,\nhowever, been difficult to measure the complete redshift 2 distribution of\nthese objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z > 4). Here we report a\nredshift survey at a wavelength of three millimeters, targeting carbon monoxide\nline emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction of\nextraordinarily bright millimetrewave-selected sources. High-resolution imaging\ndemonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed by\nforeground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources and\nmultiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust,\nunambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z > 4,\nindicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is\ngreater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample\nindicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,\npowered by extreme bursts of star formation.\n", "  Delay-coupled networks are investigated with nonidentical delay times and the\neffects of such heterogeneity on the emergent dynamics of complex systems are\ncharacterized. A simple decomposition method is presented that decouples the\ndynamics of the network into node-size modal equations in the vicinity of\nequilibria. The resulting independent components contain distributed delays\nthat map the spatiotemporal complexity of the system to the time domain. We\ndemonstrate that this new approach can be used to reveal new physical phenomena\nin heterogenous vehicular traffic when vehicles are linked via\nvehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication.\n", "  We demonstrate here that ultrathin ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt films with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy exhibit a sizeable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) effect. Such a DMI effect modifies the domain-wall (DW)\nenergy density and consequently, results in an asymmetric DW expansion driven\nby an out-of-plane magnetic field under an in-plane magnetic field bias. From\nan analysis of the asymmetry, the DMI effect is estimated to be strong enough\nfor the DW to remain in the N\\'eel-type configuration in contrast to the\ngeneral expectations of these materials. Our findings emphasize the critical\nrole of the DMI effect on the DW dynamics as the underlying physics of the\nasymmetries that are often observed in spin-transfer-related phenomena.\n", "  The continuous limit of quantum walks (QWs) on the line is revisited through\na recently developed method. In all cases but one, the limit coincides with the\ndynamics of a Dirac fermion coupled to an artificial electric and/or\nrelativistic gravitational field. All results are carefully discussed and\nillustrated by numerical simulations.\n", "  Explaining baryon asymmetry, dark matter and inflation are important elements\nof a successful theory that extends beyond the Standard Model of particle\nphysics. In this paper we explore these issues within the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), by studying the conditions for a\nstrongly first order electroweak phase transition, the abundance of the\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), and inflation driven by a gauge\ninvariant flat direction of MSSM made up of right handed squarks. We present\nthe regions of parameter space which can yield successful predictions for\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the observed relic density for the\nneutralino LSP, and successful baryogenesis constrained by collider\nmeasurements, such as the recent Higgs mass bound, branching ratios of rare,\nflavour violating decays, and the invisible Z decay width. We also explore\nwhere dark matter interactions with xenon nuclei would fall within current\nbounds of XENON100 and the projected limits for the XENON1T and LUX\nexperiments.\n", "  We revisit the constraints on the parameter space of the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), from charge and color breaking minima in\nthe light of information on the Higgs from the LHC so far. We study the\nbehavior of the scalar potential keeping two light sfermion fields along with\nthe Higgs in the pMSSM framework and analyze the stability of the vacuum. We\nfind that for lightest stop $\\lesssim 1$ TeV and small $\\mu \\lesssim 500$ GeV,\nthe absolute stability of the potential can be attained only for $|X_{t}|\n\\lesssim \\sqrt{ 6 m_{\\tilde{t}_1} m_{\\tilde{t}_2}}$. The bounds become stronger\nfor larger values of the $\\mu$ parameter. Note that this is approximately the\nvalue of $X_t$ which maximizes the Higgs mass. Our bounds on the low scale MSSM\nparameters are more stringent than those reported earlier in literature. We\nreanalyze the stau sector as well, keeping both staus. We study the connections\nbetween the observed Higgs rates and vacuum (meta)stability. We show how a\nprecision study of the ratio of signal strengths,\n($\\mu_{\\gamma\\gamma}/\\mu_{ZZ}$) can shed further light.\n", "  We extend the notion of bialgebra for Lie algebras to Leibniz algebras and\nalso, the correspondence between the Leibniz bialgebras (for different right or\nleft cases) and its dual is investigated. Moreover, the coboundary Leibniz\nbialgebras, the classical $r$-matrices and Yang-Baxter equations related to the\nLeibniz algebras are defined, and some examples are given. Finally, a method\nfor construction of a dynamical system on a Leibniz manifold via Leibniz\nbialgebra is presented.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the current-induced spin-orbit torques in\nperpendicularly magnetized Ta/CoFeB/MgO layers. The samples were annealed in\nsteps up to 300 degrees C and characterized using x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and Hall effect\nmeasurements. By performing adiabatic harmonic Hall voltage measurements, we\nshow that the transverse (field-like) and longitudinal (antidamping-like)\nspin-orbit torques are composed of constant and magnetization-dependent\ncontributions, both of which vary strongly with annealing. Such variations\ncorrelate with changes of the saturation magnetization and magnetic anisotropy\nand are assigned to chemical and structural modifications of the layers. The\nrelative variation of the constant and anisotropic torque terms as a function\nof annealing temperature is opposite for the field-like and antidamping\ntorques. Measurements of the switching probability using sub-{\\mu}s current\npulses show that the critical current increases with the magnetic anisotropy of\nthe layers, whereas the switching efficiency, measured as the ratio of magnetic\nanisotropy energy and pulse energy, decreases. The optimal annealing\ntemperature to achieve maximum magnetic anisotropy, saturation magnetization,\nand switching efficiency is determined to be between 240 degrees and 270\ndegrees C.\n", "  We investigate the environment in which direct-collapse black holes may form\nby analysing a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation that is part of the\nFirst Billion Years project. This simulation includes the most relevant\nphysical processes leading to direct collapse of haloes, most importantly,\nmolecular hydrogen depletion by dissociation of $H_2$ and $H^-$ from the\nevolving Lyman-Werner radiation field. We selected a sample of pristine atomic\ncooling haloes that have never formed stars in their past, have not been\npolluted with heavy elements and are cooling predominantly via atomic hydrogen\nlines. Amongst them we identified six haloes that could potentially harbour\nmassive seed black holes formed via direct collapse (with masses in the range\nof $10^{4-6} M_{sun}$). These potential hosts of direct-collapse black holes\nform as satellites and are found within 15 physical kpc of proto-galaxies, with\nstellar masses in the range $10^{5-7} M_{sun}$ and maximal star formation rates\nof 0.1 Msun/yr over the past 5 Myr, and are exposed to the highest flux of\nLyman-Werner radiation emitted from the neighbouring galaxies. It is the\nproximity to these proto-galaxies that differentiates these haloes from rest of\nthe sample.\n", "  We discuss renormalization in a toy model with one fermion field and one real\nscalar field phi, featuring a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry which\nforbids a fermion mass term and a phi^3 term in the Lagrangian. We employ a\nrenormalization scheme which uses the MSbar scheme for the Yukawa and quartic\nscalar couplings and renormalizes the vacuum expectation value of phi by\nrequiring that the one-point function of the shifted field is zero. In this\nscheme, the tadpole contributions to the fermion and scalar selfenergies are\ncanceled by choice of the renormalization parameter delta_v of the vacuum\nexpectation value. However, delta_v and, therefore, the tadpole contributions\nreenter the scheme via the mass renormalization of the scalar, in which place\nthey are indispensable for obtaining finiteness. We emphasize that the above\nrenormalization scheme provides a clear formulation of the hierarchy problem\nand allows a straightforward generalization to an arbitrary number of fermion\nand scalar fields.\n", "  Magnetic ratchets -- two-dimensional systems with superimposed\nnon-centrosymmetric ferromagnetic gratings -- are considered theoretically. It\nis demonstrated that excitation by radiation results in a directed motion of\ntwo-dimensional carriers due to pure orbital effect of the periodic magnetic\nfield. Magnetic ratchets based on various two-dimensional systems like\ntopological insulators, graphene and semiconductor heterostructures are\ninvestigated. The mechanisms of the electric current generation caused by both\nradiation-induced heating of carriers and by acceleration in the radiation\nelectric field in the presence of space-oscillating Lorentz force are studied\nin detail. The electric currents sensitive to the linear polarization plane\norientation as well as to the radiation helicity are calculated. It is\ndemonstrated that the frequency dependence of the magnetic ratchet currents is\ndetermined by the dominant elastic scattering mechanism of two-dimensional\ncarriers and differs for the systems with linear and parabolic energy\ndispersions.\n", "  This paper extends the parabolic integral equation method, which is very\neffective for forward scattering from rough surfaces, to include backscatter.\nThis is done by applying left-right splitting to a modified two-way governing\nintegral operator, to express the solution as a series of Volterra operators;\nthis series describes successively higher-order surface interactions between\nforward and backward going components, and allows highly efficient numerical\nevaluation. This and equivalent methods such as ordered multiple interactions\nhave been developed for the full Helmholtz integral equations, but not\npreviously applied to the parabolic Green's function. In addition, the form of\nthis Green's function allows the mean field and autocorrelation to be found\nanalytically to second order in surface height. These may be regarded as\nbackscatter corrections to the standard parabolic integral equation method.\n", "  We study 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories with a co-dimension two full\nsurface operator, which exhibit a fascinating interplay of supersymmetric gauge\ntheories, equivariant Gromov-Witten theory and geometric representation theory.\nFor pure Yang-Mills and $\\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory, we describe a full surface\noperator as the 4d gauge theory coupled to a 2d $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ gauge\ntheory. By supersymmetric localizations, we present the exact partition\nfunctions of both 4d and 2d theories which satisfy integrable equations. In\naddition, the form of the structure constants with a semi-degenerate field in\nSL(N,R) WZNW model is predicted from one-loop determinants of 4d gauge theories\nwith a full surface operator via the AGT relation.\n", "  A numerical study of the crushing of circular aluminium tubes with and\nwithout aluminium foam fillers has been carried out to investigate their\nbuckling behaviours under axial compression. A crushing mode classification\nchart has been established for empty tubes. The influence of boundary\nconditions on crushing mode has also been investigated. The effect of foam\nfiller on the crushing mode of tubes filled with foam was then examined. The\npredicted results would assist the design of crashworthy tube components with\nthe preferred crushing mode with the maximum energy absorption.\n", "  Discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) in random artificial electric and\ngravitational fields are studied analytically and numerically. The analytical\ncomputations are carried by a new method which allows a direct exact analytical\ndetermination of the equations of motion obeyed by the average density\noperator. It is proven that randomness induces decoherence and that the quantum\nwalks behave asymptotically like classical random walks. Asymptotic diffusion\ncoefficients are computed exactly. The continuous limit is also obtained and\ndiscussed.\n", "  In search for the cheapest but still reliable numerical simulation, a\nsystematic study on the effect of the computational domain (\"box\") size on\ndirect numerical simulations of Taylor-Couette flow was performed. Four boxes,\nwith varying azimuthal and axial extents were used. The radius ratio between\nthe inner cylinder and the outer cylinder was fixed to $\\eta=r_i/r_o=0.909$,\nand the outer was kept stationary, while the inner rotated at a Reynolds number\n$Re_i=10^5$. Profiles of mean and fluctuation velocities are compared, as well\nas autocorrelations and velocity spectra. The smallest box is found to\naccurately reproduce the torque and mean azimuthal velocity profiles of larger\nboxes, while having smaller values of the fluctuations than the larger boxes.\nThe axial extent of the box directly reflects on the Taylor-rolls and plays a\ncrucial role on the correlations and spectra. The azimuthal extent is also\nfound to play a significant role, as larger boxes allow for azimuthal wave-like\npatterns in the Taylor rolls to develop, which affects the statistics in the\nbulk region. For all boxes studied, the spectra does not reach a box\nindependent maximum.\n", "  We present harmonic transverse voltage measurements of current-induced\nthermoelectric and spin-orbit torque (SOT) effects in ferromagnet/normal metal\nbilayers, in which thermal gradients produced by Joule heating and SOT coexist\nand give rise to ac transverse signals with comparable symmetry and magnitude.\nBased on the symmetry and field-dependence of the transverse resistance, we\ndevelop a consistent method to separate thermoelectric and SOT measurements. By\naddressing first ferromagnet/light metal bilayers with negligible spin-orbit\ncoupling, we show that in-plane current injection induces a vertical thermal\ngradient whose sign and magnitude are determined by the resistivity difference\nand stacking order of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers. We then study\nferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers with strong spin-orbit coupling, showing that\nsecond harmonic thermoelectric contributions to the transverse voltage may lead\nto a significant overestimation of the antidamping SOT. We find that\nthermoelectric effects are very strong in Ta(6nm)/Co(2.5nm) and negligible in\nPt(6nm)/Co(2.5nm) bilayers. After including these effects in the analysis of\nthe transverse voltage, we find that the antidamping SOTs in these bilayers,\nafter normalization to the magnetization volume, are comparable to those found\nin thinner Co layers with perpendicular magnetization, whereas the field-like\nSOTs are about an order of magnitude smaller.\n", "  We study the entanglement in a system consisting of two non-interacting atoms\nlocated in separate cavities, both in their ground states. A single incoming\nphoton has a non-zero probability of entering either of the two cavities. The\nJaynes-Cummings interaction in the rotating wave approximation describes the\ncoupling of each atom with the radiation field. We compute and analyze the\natom-atom entanglement, the entanglement between the two photon modes, and also\nthe entanglement between each atom and each photon mode. The measure of\nentanglement is the von Neumann entropy. For the case in which the two\natom-photon systems have identical properties, but allowing for non-resonant\nconditions, the sum of the atom-atom and photon-modes-entanglement is time\nindependent. The effect of detuning is to decrease the strength of the largest\nentanglement achieved and to shorten the time for it to occur. The results\nsupport the fact that the state of the photons after emergence from cavities is\nentangled, notwithstanding its single-particle nature. In addition, for the\ncase of resonance and identical cavity parameters, we demonstrate that von\nNeumann entropy is always greater than or equal to the measure of entanglement\nknown as negativity.\n", "  We introduce the $2D$ dimensional double space with the coordinates $Z^M=\n(x^\\mu, y_\\mu)$ which components are the coordinates of initial space $x^\\mu$\nand its T-dual $y_\\mu$. We shall show that in this extended space the T-duality\ntransformations can be realized simply by exchanging places of some coordinates\n$x^a$, along which we want to perform T-duality and the corresponding dual\ncoordinates $y_a$. In such approach it is evident that T-duality leads to the\nphysically equivalent theory and that complete set of T-duality transformations\nform subgroup of the $2D$ permutation group. So, in the double space we are\nable to represent the backgrounds of all T-dual theories in unified manner.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of the Taylor-Couette (TC) problem, the flow\nbetween two coaxial and independently rotating cylinders, have been performed.\nThe study focuses on TC flow with mild curvature (small gap) with a radius\nratio of $\\eta=r_i/r_o=0.909$, an aspect ratio of $\\Gamma=L/d=2\\pi/3$, and a\nstationary outer cylinder. Three inner cylinder Reynolds of $1\\cdot10^5$,\n$2\\cdot10^5$ and $3\\cdot 10^5$ were simulated, corresponding to frictional\nReynolds numbers between $Re_\\tau\\approx 1400$ and $Re_\\tau \\approx 4000$. An\nadditional case with a large gap, $\\eta=0.5$ and driving of $Re=2\\cdot10^5$ was\nalso performed. Small-gap TC was found to be dominated by spatially-fixed\nlarge-scale structures, known as Taylor rolls (TRs). TRs are attached to the\nboundary layer, and are active, i.e. they transport angular velocity through\nReynolds stresses. An additional simulation with inner cylinder Reynolds number\nof $Re=1\\cdot10^5$ and fixed outer cylinder with an externally imposed axial\nflow of comparable strength as the wind of the TRs was also conducted. The\naxial flow was found to convect the TRs without any weakening effect. For\nsmall-gap TC, evidence for the existence of logarithmic velocity fluctuations,\nand of an overlap layer, in which the velocity fluctuations collapse in outer\nunits, was found. Profiles consistent with a logarithmic dependence were also\nfound for the angular velocity in large-gap TC, albeit in a very reduced range\nof scales. Finally, the behaviour of both small- and large-gap TC was compared\nto other canonical flows. Small-gap TC has similar behaviour in the near-wall\nregion to other canonical flows, while large-gap TC displays very different\nbehaviour.\n", "  We derive the probability that all eigenvalues of a random matrix $\\bf M$ lie\nwithin an arbitrary interval $[a,b]$,\n$\\psi(a,b)\\triangleq\\Pr\\{a\\leq\\lambda_{\\min}({\\bf M}), \\lambda_{\\max}({\\bf\nM})\\leq b\\}$, when $\\bf M$ is a real or complex finite dimensional Wishart,\ndouble Wishart, or Gaussian symmetric/Hermitian matrix. We give efficient\nrecursive formulas allowing the exact evaluation of $\\psi(a,b)$ for Wishart\nmatrices, even with large number of variates and degrees of freedom. We also\nprove that the probability that all eigenvalues are within the limiting\nspectral support (given by the Mar{\\v{c}}enko-Pastur or the semicircle laws)\ntends for large dimensions to the universal values $0.6921$ and $0.9397$ for\nthe real and complex cases, respectively. Applications include improved bounds\nfor the probability that a Gaussian measurement matrix has a given restricted\nisometry constant in compressed sensing.\n", "  Magnetoresistive effects are usually invariant upon inversion of the\nmagnetization direction. In noncentrosymmetric conductors, however, nonlinear\nresistive terms can give rise to a current dependence that is quadratic in the\napplied voltage and linear in the magnetization. Here we demonstrate that such\nconditions are realized in simple bilayer metal films where the spin-orbit\ninteraction and spin-dependent scattering couple the current-induced spin\naccumulation to the electrical conductivity. We show that the longitudinal\nresistance of Ta|Co and Pt|Co bilayers changes when reversing the polarity of\nthe current or the sign of the magnetization. This unidirectional\nmagnetoresistance scales linearly with current density and has opposite sign in\nTa and Pt, which we associate with the modification of the interface scattering\npotential induced by the spin Hall effect in these materials. Our results\nsuggest a route to control the resistance and detect magnetization switching in\nspintronic devices using a two-terminal geometry, which applies also to\nheterostructures including topological insulators.\n", "  Smoothing is an estimation method whereby a classical state (probability\ndistribution for classical variables) at a given time is conditioned on\nall-time (both past and future) observations. Here we define a smoothed quantum\nstate for a partially monitored open quantum system, conditioned on an all-time\nmonitoring-derived record. We calculate the smoothed distribution for a\nhypothetical unobserved record which, when added to the real record, would\ncomplete the monitoring, yielding a pure-state \"quantum trajectory\". Averaging\nthe pure state over this smoothed distribution yields the (mixed) smoothed\nquantum state. We study how the choice of actual unravelling affects the purity\nincrease over that of the conventional (filtered) state conditioned only on the\npast record.\n", "  We introduce and study stochastic $N$-particle ensembles which are\ndiscretizations for general-$\\beta$ log-gases of random matrix theory. The\nexamples include random tilings, families of non-intersecting paths,\n$(z,w)$-measures, etc. We prove that under technical assumptions on general\nanalytic potential, the global fluctuations for such ensembles are\nasymptotically Gaussian as $N\\to\\infty$. The covariance is universal and\ncoincides with its counterpart in random matrix theory.\n  Our main tool is an appropriate discrete version of the Schwinger-Dyson (or\nloop) equations, which originates in the work of Nekrasov and his\ncollaborators.\n", "  In this article we offer the new interpretation of T-dualization procedure of\ntype II superstring theory in double space framework. We use the ghost free\naction of type II superstring in pure spinor formulation in approximation of\nconstant background fields up to the quadratic terms. T-dualization along any\nsubset of the initial coordinates, $x^a$, is equivalent to the permutation of\nthis subset with subset of the corresponding T-dual coordinates, $y_a$, in\ndouble space coordinate $Z^M=(x^\\mu,y_\\mu)$. Demanding that the T-dual\ntransformation law after exchange $x^a\\leftrightarrow y_a$ has the same form as\ninitial one, we obtain the T-dual NS-NS and NS-R background fields. The T-dual\nR-R field strength is determined up to one arbitrary constant under some\nassumptions. The compatibility between supersymmetry and T-duality produces\nchange of bar spinors and R-R field strength. If we dualize odd number of\ndimensions $x^a$, such change flips type IIA/B to type II B/A. If we T-dualize\ntime-like direction, one imaginary unit $i$ maps type II superstring theories\nto type $II^\\star$ ones.\n", "  The nonlinear optical Galton board (NLOGB), a quantum walk like (but\nnonlinear) discrete time quantum automaton, is shown to admit a complex\nevolution leading to long time thermalized states. The continuous limit of the\nGalton Board is derived and shown to be a nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE). The\n(Galerkin truncated) NLDE evolution is shown to thermalize toward states\nqualitatively similar to those of the NLOGB. The NLDE conserved quantities are\nderived and used to construct a stochastic differential equation converging to\ngrand canonical distributions that are shown to reproduce the (micro canonical)\nNLDE thermalized statistics. Both the NLOGB and the Galerkin-truncated NLDE are\nthus demonstrated to exhibit spontaneous thermalization.\n", "  I develop the idea that our world is a brane-like object embedded in\nEuclidean bulk. In its ground state, the brane constituent matter is assumed to\nbe homogeneous and isotropic, and of negligible influence on the bulk geometry.\nThe analysis of this paper is model independent, in the sense that action\nfunctional of bulk fields is not specified. Instead, the behavior of the brane\nis derived from the universally valid conservation equation of the bulk stress\ntensor. The present work studies the behavior of a $3$-sphere in the\n$5$-dimensional Euclidean bulk. The sphere is made of bulk matter characterized\nby the equation of state $p=\\alpha\\rho$. It is shown that stability of brane\nvibrations requires $\\alpha < 0$. Then, the stable brane perturbations obey\nKlein-Gordon-like equation with an effective metric of Minkowski signature. The\nargument is given that it is this effective metric that is detected in physical\nmeasurements. The corresponding effective Universe is analyzed for all the\nvalues of $\\alpha<0$. In particular, the effective metric is shown to be a\nsolution of Einstein's equations coupled to an effective perfect fluid. The\neffective energy density and pressure at the present epoch are calculated. So\nare the age of the Universe, and the effective cosmological constant. All the\nresults are presented in two tables. As an illustration, one simple choice of\nthe brane constituent matter is studied in detail.\n", "  A simple apparatus for the measurement of Seebeck coefficient ($\\alpha$) in\nthe temperature range 300-620 K has been fabricated. Our design is appropriate\nfor the characterization of samples with different geometries like disk and rod\nshaped. The sample holder assembly of the apparatus has been designed in such a\nway that, single heater used for sample heating purpose is enough to provide a\nself maintain temperature gradient (1-10 K) across the sample. The value of\n$\\alpha$ is obtained without explicit measurement of temperature gradient. The\nwhole apparatus is fabricated from the materials, which are commonly available,\nso that any part can be replaced in case of any damage. Commercially available\nstandard Nickel (Ni) metal sample has been used as a reference material for\ncalibration of the instrument. The experimentally observed value of $\\alpha$ by\nour apparatus gives the similar temperature dependent behavior as reported in\nthe literature. In order to study the thermoelectric behavior of oxide\nmaterials, we have synthesized polycrystalline LaCoO$_{3}$ powder samples by\nusing solution combustion method and investigated the thermoelectric\nproperties. Temperature dependent thermoelectric behavior of these samples were\ncharacterized in the temperature range 300-600 K.\n", "  We define and compute the $L^2$ metric on the framed moduli space of circle\ninvariant 1-instantons on the 4-sphere. This moduli space is four dimensional\nand our metric is $SO(3) \\times U(1)$ symmetric. We study the behaviour of\ngeneric geodesics and show that the metric is geodesically incomplete.\nCircle-invariant instantons on the 4-sphere can also be viewed as hyperbolic\nmonopoles, and we interpret our results from this viewpoint. We relate our\nresults to work by Habermann on unframed instantons on the 4-sphere and, in the\nlimit where the radius of the 4-sphere tends to infinity, to results on\ninstantons on Euclidean 4-space.\n", "  An expression in terms of (cyclotomic) harmonic sums can be simplified by the\nquasi-shuffle algebra in terms of the so-called basis sums. By construction,\nthese sums are algebraically independent within the quasi-shuffle algebra. In\nthis article we show that the basis sums can be represented within a tower of\ndifference ring extensions where the constants remain unchanged. This property\nenables one to embed this difference ring for the (cyclotomic) harmonic sums\ninto the ring of sequences. This construction implies that the sequences\nproduced by the basis sums are algebraically independent over the rational\nsequences adjoined with the alternating sequence.\n", "  The cumulative emission resulting from hadronic cosmic-ray interactions in\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs) has been proposed as the dominant contribution to\nthe astrophysical neutrino flux at TeV to PeV energies reported by IceCube. The\nsame particle interactions also inevitably create $\\gamma$-ray emission that\ncould be detectable as a component of the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background\n(EGB), which is now measured with the Fermi-LAT in the energy range from 0.1 to\n820 GeV. New studies of the blazar flux distribution at $\\gamma$-ray energies\nabove 50 GeV place an upper bound on the residual non-blazar component of the\nEGB. We show that these results are in strong tension with models that consider\nSFGs as the dominant source of the diffuse neutrino backgrounds. A\ncharacteristic spectral index for parent cosmic rays in starburst galaxies of\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm SB} \\simeq 2.3$ for $dN/dE \\propto E^{-\\Gamma_{\\rm SB}}$ is\nconsistent with the observed scaling relation between $\\gamma$-ray and IR\nluminosity for SFGs, the bounds from the non-blazar EGB, and the observed\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra of individual starbursts, but underpredicts the IceCube\ndata by approximately an order of magnitude.\n", "  We show how to verify the metrological usefulness of quantum states based on\nthe expectation values of an arbitrarily chosen set of observables. In\nparticular, we estimate the quantum Fisher information as a figure of merit of\nmetrological usefulness. Our approach gives a tight lower bound on the quantum\nFisher information for the given incomplete information. We apply our method to\nthe results of various multiparticle quantum states prepared in experiments\nwith photons and trapped ions, as well as to spin-squeezed states and Dicke\nstates realized in cold gases. Our approach can be used for detecting and\nquantifying metrologically useful entanglement in very large systems, based on\na few operator expectation values. We also gain new insights into the\ndifference between metrological useful multipartite entanglement and\nentanglement in general.\n", "  This paper provides both a detailed study of color-dependence of link\nhomologies, as realized in physics as certain spaces of BPS states, and a broad\nstudy of the behavior of BPS states in general. We consider how the spectrum of\nBPS states varies as continuous parameters of a theory are perturbed. This\nquestion can be posed in a wide variety of physical contexts, and we answer it\nby proposing that the relationship between unperturbed and perturbed BPS\nspectra is described by a spectral sequence. These general considerations unify\nprevious applications of spectral sequence techniques to physics, and explain\nfrom a physical standpoint the appearance of many spectral sequences relating\nvarious link homology theories to one another. We also study structural\nproperties of colored HOMFLY homology for links and evaluate Poincare\npolynomials in numerous examples. Among these structural properties is a novel\n\"sliding\" property, which can be explained by using (refined) modular S-matrix.\nThis leads to the identification of modular transformations in Chern-Simons\ntheory and 3d N=2 theory via the 3d/3d correspondence. Lastly, we introduce the\nnotion of associated varieties as classical limits of recursion relations of\ncolored superpolynomials of links, and study their properties.\n", "  We investigate the quantum entanglement of systems of coupled harmonic\noscillators on the basis of thermo-field dynamics (TFD). For coupled harmonic\noscillators at equilibrium, the extended entanglement entropy is derived using\nthe TFD method, and it is demonstrated to be controlled by temperature and\ncoupling parameters. For non-equilibrium systems, in addition to temperature\nand coupling parameters, the time dependence of the extended entanglement\nentropy is calculated in accordance with the dissipative von Neumann equation,\nand the dissipative dynamics of the systems of coupled harmonic oscillators is\ndiscussed. Consequently, based on TFD, the physical parametrization of the\nentanglement entropies is confirmed in both the equilibrium and non-equilibrium\ncases of harmonic oscillator systems by means of the laws of thermodynamics.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the study of theexistence/non-existence of the\ndiscrete spectrum of the Laplaceoperator on a domain of $\\mathbb R ^3$ which\nconsists in atwisted tube. This operator is defined by means of mixed\nboundaryconditions. Here we impose Neumann Boundary conditions on abounded open\nsubset of the boundary of the domain (the Neumannwindow) and Dirichlet boundary\nconditions elsewhere.\n", "  Recent advances in solid-state qubit technology are paving the way to\nfault-tolerant quantum computing systems. However, qubit technology is limited\nby qubit coherence time and by the complexity of coupling the quantum system\nwith a classical electronic infrastructure.\n  We propose an infrastructure, enabling to read and control qubits, that is\nimplemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA platform\nsupports functionality required by several qubit technologies and can operate\nphysically close to the qubits over a temperature range from 4K to 300K.\nExtensive characterization of the platform over this temperature range revealed\nall major components (such as LUTs, MMCM, PLL, BRAM, IDELAY2) operate correctly\nand the logic speed is very stable. The stability is finally concretized by\noperating an integrated ADC with relatively stable performance over\ntemperature.\n", "  Crossed Andreev reflection (cAR) is a scattering process that happens in a\nquantum transport set-up consisting of two normal metals (NM) attached to a\nsuperconductor (SC), where an electron incident from one NM results in a hole\nemerging in the other. Typically, an electron tunnelling through the\nsuperconductor from one NM to the other (ET) competes with cAR and masks the\nsignature of cAR in the conductance spectrum. We propose a novel scheme to\nenhance cAR, in which SC part of the NM-SC-NM is side-coupled to another SC\nhaving a different SC phase to form a Josephson junction in the transverse\ndirection. At strong enough coupling and adequate phase difference, one can\nsmoothly traverse between highly ET-dominant to highly cAR-dominant transport\nregimes by tuning chemical potential, due to the appearance of subgap Andreev\nstates that are extended in the longitudinal direction. We also discuss\nconnections to realistic systems.\n", "  In this work we propose an ensemble 4D seismic history matching framework for\nreservoir characterization. Compared to similar existing frameworks in\nreservoir engineering community, the proposed one consists of some relatively\nnew ingredients, in terms of the type of seismic data in choice, wavelet\nmultiresolution analysis for the chosen seismic data and related data noise\nestimation, and the use of recently developed iterative ensemble history\nmatching algorithms.\n  Typical seismic data used for history matching, such as acoustic impedance,\nare inverted quantities, whereas extra uncertainties may arise during the\ninversion processes. In the proposed framework we avoid such intermediate\ninversion processes. In addition, we also adopt wavelet-based sparse\nrepresentation to reduce data size. Concretely, we use intercept and gradient\nattributes derived from amplitude versus angle (AVA) data, apply multilevel\ndiscrete wavelet transforms (DWT) to attribute data, and estimate noise level\nof resulting wavelet coefficients. We then select the wavelet coefficients\nabove a certain threshold value, and history-match these leading wavelet\ncoefficients using an iterative ensemble smoother.\n  (The rest of the abstract is omitted for exceeding the limit of length)\n", "  In this article we offer the interpretation of the fermionic T-duality of the\ntype II superstring theory in double space. We generalize the idea of double\nspace doubling the fermionic sector of the superspace. In such doubled space\nfermionic T-duality is represented as permutation of the fermionic coordinates\n$\\theta^\\alpha$ and $\\bar\\theta^\\alpha$ with the corresponding fermionic T-dual\nones, $\\vartheta_\\alpha$ and $\\bar\\vartheta_\\alpha$, respectively. Demanding\nthat T-dual transformation law has the same form as inital one, we obtain the\nknown form of the fermionic T-dual NS-R i R-R background fields. Fermionic\nT-dual NS-NS background fields are obtained under some assumptions. We conclude\nthat only symmetric part of R-R field strength and symmetric part of its\nfermionic T-dual contribute to the fermionic T-duality transformation of\ndilaton field and analyze the dilaton field in fermionic double space. As a\nmodel we use the ghost free action of type II superstring in pure spinor\nformulation in approximation of constant background fields up to the quadratic\nterms.\n", "  We consider a theory of an open string moving in a weakly curved background,\ncomposed of a constant metric and a linearly coordinate dependent Kalb-Ramond\nfield with an infinitesimal field strength. We find its T-dual using the\ngeneralized Buscher procedure developed for the closed string moving in a\nweakly curved background, and the fact that solving the boundary conditions,\nthe open string theory transforms to the effective closed string theory. So,\nT-dualizing the effective theory along all effective directions we obtain its\nT-dual theory and resume the open sting theory which has such an effective\ntheory. In this way we obtain the open string theory T-dual.\n", "  A series of direct numerical simulations of Taylor-Couette (TC) flow, the\nflow between two coaxial cylinders, with the outer cylinder rotating and the\ninner one fixed, were performed. Three cases, with outer cylinder Reynolds\nnumbers $Re_o$ of $Re_o=5.5\\cdot10^4$, $Re_o=1.1\\cdot10^5$ and\n$Re_o=2.2\\cdot10^5$ were considered. The radius ratio $\\eta=r_i/r_o$ was fixed\nto $\\eta=0.909$ to mitigate the effects of curvature. The vertical aspect ratio\n$\\Gamma$ was fixed to $\\Gamma=2.09$. Being linearly stable, outer cylinder\nrotation TC flow is known to have very different behavior than pure inner\ncylinder rotation TC flow. Here, we find that the flow nonetheless becomes\nturbulent, but the torque required to drive the cylinders and level of velocity\nfluctuations was found to be smaller than those for pure inner cylinder\nrotation at comparable Reynolds numbers. The mean angular momentum profiles\nshowed a large gradient in the bulk, instead of the constant angular momentum\nprofiles of pure inner cylinder rotation. The near-wall mean and fluctuation\nvelocity profiles were found to coincide only very close to the wall, showing\nlarge deviations from both pure inner cylinder rotation profiles and the\nclassic von Karman law of the wall elsewhere. Finally, transport of angular\nvelocity was found to occur mainly through intermittent bursts, and not through\nwall-attached large-scale structures as is the case for pure inner cylinder\nrotation.\n", "  About 0.4s after the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory\n(LIGO) detected a transient gravitational-wave (GW) signal GW150914, the Fermi\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) also found a weak electromagnetic transient (GBM\ntransient 150914). Time and location coincidences favor a possible association\nbetween GW150904 and GBM transient 150914. Under this possible association, we\nadopt Fermi's electromagnetic (EM) localization and derive constraints on\npossible violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) from the\nobservations of two events. Our calculations are based on four comparisons:\n(1)The first is the comparison of the initial GWs detected at the two LIGO\nsites. From the different polarizations of these initial GWs, we obtain a limit\non any difference in the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter\n$\\Delta\\gamma\\lesssim 10^{-10}$. (2) The second is a comparison of GWs and\npossible EM waves. Using a traditional super-Eddington accretion model for GBM\ntransient 150914, we again obtain an upper limit $\\Delta\\gamma\\lesssim\n10^{-10}$. Compared with previous results for photons and neutrinos, our limits\nare five orders of magnitude stronger than those from PeV neutrinos in blazar\nflares, and seven orders stronger than those from MeV neutrinos in SN1987A. (3)\nThe third is a comparison of GWs with different frequencies in the range [35\nHz, 250 Hz]. (4) The fourth is a comparison of EM waves with different energies\nin the range [1 keV, 10 MeV]. These last two comparisons lead to an even\nstronger limit, $\\Delta\\gamma\\lesssim 10^{-8}$. Our results highlight the\npotential of multi-messenger signals exploiting different emission channels to\nstrengthen existing tests of the WEP.\n", "  We study a class of non-exotic minimal $U(1) '$ extensions of the Standard\nModel, which includes all scenarios that are anomaly-free with the ordinary\nfermion content augmented by one Right-Handed neutrino per generation, wherein\nthe new Abelian gauge group is spontaneously broken by the non-zero Vacuum\nExpectation Value of an additional Higgs singlet field, in turn providing mass\nto a $Z'$ state. By adopting the $B-L$ example, whose results can be recast\ninto those pertaining to the whole aforementioned class, and allowing for both\nscalar and gauge mixing, we first extract the surviving parameter space in\npresence of up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints. Over the\ncorresponding parameter configurations, we then delineate the high energy\nbehaviour of such constructs in terms of their stability and perturbativity.\nFinally, we highlight key production and decay channels of the new states\nentering the spectra of this class of models, i.e., heavy neutrinos, a second\nHiggs state and the $Z'$, which are amenable to experimental investigation at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. We therefore set the stage to establish a direct\nlink between measurements obtainable at the Electro-Weak scale and the dynamics\nof the underlying model up to those where a Grand Unification Theory embedding\na $U(1)'$ can be realised.\n", "  We study the compactification of 5d SCFTs to 4d on a circle with a twist in a\ndiscrete global symmetry element of these SCFTs. We present evidence that this\nleads to various 4d N=2 isolated SCFTs. These include many known theories as\nwell as seemingly new ones. The known theories include the recently discovered\nrank 1 SU(4) SCFT and its mass deformations. One application of the new SCFTs\nis in the dual descriptions of the 4d gauge theory SU(N)+1S+(N-2)F. Also\ninteresting is the appearance of a theory with rank 1 and $F_4$ global\nsymmetry.\n", "  The origin of enhanced superconductivity over 50 K in the recently discovered\nFeSe monolayer films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$ (STO), as compared to 8 K in bulk\nFeSe, is intensely debated. As with the ferrochalcogenides\nA$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ and potassium doped FeSe, which also have a\nrelatively high superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$), the Fermi surface\n(FS) of the FeSe/STO monolayer films is free of hole-like FS, suggesting that a\nLifshitz transition by which these hole FSs vanish may help increasing $T_c$.\nHowever, the fundamental reasons explaining this increase of $T_c$ remain\nunclear. Here we report a 15 K jump of $T_c$ accompanying a second Lifshitz\ntransition, characterized by the emergence of an electron pocket at the\nBrillouin zone (BZ) centre, that is triggered by high electron doping following\nin-situ deposition of potassium on FeSe/STO monolayer films. Our results\nsuggest that the pairing interactions are orbital-dependent with the $d_{xy}$\norbital playing a determining role in generating enhanced superconductivity in\nFeSe.\n", "  We present the thermoelectric (TE) properties of LaCoO$_{3}$ compound in the\ntemperature range 300-600 K. The experimental value of Seebeck coefficient\n($\\alpha$) at 300 K is found to be $\\sim$635 $\\mu$V/K. The value of $\\alpha$\ndecreases continuously with increase in temperature and reaches to $\\sim$46\n$\\mu$V/K at $\\sim$600 K. The electronic and TE properties of the compound have\nalso been investigated by combining the \\textit{ab-initio} electronic\nstructures and Boltzmann transport calculations. LSDA plus Hubbard U (U= 2.75\neV) calculation on low spin configuration of the compound gives an energy gap\nof $\\sim$0.5 eV, which is close to the experimentally reported energy gap. The\neffective mass of holes (\\textit{m$^{*}_h$}) at $\\Gamma$ point is nearly two\ntimes larger than the value of effective mass of electrons (\\textit{m$^{*}_e$})\nat FB point along the L and T directions, whereas the \\textit{m$^{*}_e$} at FB\npoint along the $\\Gamma$ direction is nearly eight times larger than the value\nof \\textit{m$^{*}_h$} at $\\Gamma$ point along the FB direction. The large\neffective mass at FB point along the $\\Gamma$ direction suggests that the TE\nproperty of this compound is mainly decided by the effective mass of the charge\ncarriers in this direction. The calculated temperature dependent values of\n$\\alpha$ are in fairly good agreement with experimental data in the temperature\nrange 300-360 K, and above this temperature slight deviation is observed. The\nvalue of power factor (PF) for \\textit{n}-type is $\\sim$1.3 times larger the\nvalue of \\textit{p}-type doped compound at 1100 K. The value of\n\\textit{figure-of-merit} (\\textit{ZT}) for \\textit{n}-type doped compound is\nobtained $\\sim$0.35 in the temperature range 600-1100 K, which suggests that\nwith appropriate \\textit{n}-type doping this compound can be used as a good TE\nmaterial in the high temperature region.\n", "  Since all Einstein spacetimes are vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity in\nfour dimensions, in this paper we study various aspects of non-Einstein vacuum\nsolutions to this theory. Most such known solutions are of traceless Ricci and\nPetrov type N with a constant Ricci scalar. Thus we assume the Ricci scalar to\nbe constant which leads to a substantial simplification of the field equations.\nWe prove that a vacuum solution to quadratic gravity with traceless Ricci\ntensor of type N and aligned Weyl tensor of any Petrov type is necessarily a\nKundt spacetime. This will considerably simplify the search for new\nnon-Einstein solutions. Similarly, a vacuum solution to quadratic gravity with\ntraceless Ricci type III and aligned Weyl tensor of Petrov type II or more\nspecial is again necessarily a Kundt spacetime.\n  Then we study the general role of conformal transformations in constructing\nvacuum solutions to quadratic gravity. We find that such solutions can be\nobtained by solving one non-linear partial differential equation for a\nconformal factor on any Einstein spacetime or, more generally, on any\nbackground with vanishing Bach tensor. In particular, we show that all\ngeometries conformal to Kundt are either Kundt or Robinson-Trautman, and we\nprovide some explicit Kundt and Robinson-Trautman solutions to quadratic\ngravity by solving the above mentioned equation on certain Kundt backgrounds.\n", "  Silicon quantum dots are attractive candidates for the development of\nscalable, spin-based qubits. Pauli spin blockade in double quantum dots\nprovides an efficient, temperature independent mechanism for qubit readout.\nHere we report on transport experiments in double gate nanowire transistors\nissued from a CMOS process on 300 mm silicon-on-insulator wafers. At low\ntemperature the devices behave as two few-electron quantum dots in series. We\nobserve signatures of Pauli spin blockade with a singlet-triplet splitting\nranging from 0.3 to 1.3 meV. Magneto-transport measurements show that\ntransitions which conserve spin are shown to be magnetic-field independent up\nto B = 6 T.\n", "  Symmetry fractionalization describes the fascinating phenomena that\nexcitations in a 2D topological system can transform under symmetry in a\nfractional way. For example in fractional quantum Hall systems, excitations can\ncarry fractional charges while the electrons making up the system have charge\none. An important question is to understand what symmetry fractionalization\n(SF) patterns are possible given different types of topological order and\ndifferent symmetries. A lot of progress has been made recently in classifying\nthe SF patterns, providing deep insight into the strongly correlated\nexperimental signatures of systems like spin liquids and topological\ninsulators. We review recent developments on this topic. First, it was shown\nthat the SF patterns need to satisfy some simple consistency conditions. More\ninteresting, it was realized that some seemingly consistent SF patterns are\nactually `anomalous', i.e. they cannot be realized in strictly 2D systems. We\nreview various methods that have been developed to detect such anomalies.\nApplying such an understanding to 2D spin liquid allows one to enumerate all\npotentially realizable SF patterns and propose numerical and experimental\nprobing methods to distinguish them. On the other hand, the anomalous SF\npatterns were shown to exist on the surface of 3D systems and reflect the\nnontrivial order in the 3D bulk. We review examples of this kind where the bulk\nstates are topological insulators, topological superconductors, or have other\nsymmetry protected topological orders.\n", "  We analyze the simulation of Dirac neutrino oscillations using quantum walks,\nboth in vacuum and in matter. We show that this simulation, in the continuum\nlimit, reproduces a set of coupled Dirac equations that describe neutrino\nflavor oscillations, and we make use of this to establish a connection with\nneutrino phenomenology, thus allowing to fix the parameters of the simulation\nfor a given neutrino experiment. We also analyze how matter effects for\nneutrino propagation can be simulated in the quantum walk. In this way,\nimportant features, such as the MSW effect, can be incorporated. Thus, the\nsimulation of neutrino oscillations with the help of quantum walks might be\nuseful to explore these effects in extreme conditions, such as the solar\ninterior or supernovae, in a complementary way to existing experiments.\n", "  There is a surprising isomorphism between the quantised universal enveloping\nalgebras of osp(1|2n) and so(2n+1). This same isomorphism emerged in recent\nwork of Mikhaylov and Witten in the context of string theory as a T-duality\ncomposed with an S-duality. We construct similar Hopf superalgebra isomorphisms\nfor families of pairs of quantum affine superalgebras. An immediate consequence\nis that the representation categories of the quantum affine superalgebras in\neach pair are equivalent as strict tensor categories.\n", "  Quantization of the gravitational field may allow the existence of a decay\nchannel of black holes into white holes with an explicit time-reversal\nsymmetry. The definition of a meaningful decay probability for this channel is\nstudied in spherically symmetric situations. As a first nontrivial calculation,\nwe present the functional integration over a set of geometries using a\nsingle-variable function to interpolate between black-hole and white-hole\ngeometries in a bounded region of spacetime. This computation gives a finite\nresult which depends only on the Schwarzschild mass and a parameter measuring\nthe width of the interpolating region. The associated probability distribution\ndisplays an exponential decay law on the latter parameter, with a mean lifetime\ninversely proportional to the Schwarzschild mass. In physical terms this would\nimply that matter collapsing to a black hole from a finite radius bounces back\nelastically and instantaneously, with negligible time delay as measured by\nexternal observers. These results invite to reconsider the ultimate nature of\nastrophysical black holes, providing a possible mechanism for the formation of\nblack stars instead of proper general relativistic black holes. The existence\nof both this decay channel and black stars can be tested in future observations\nof gravitational waves.\n", "  Using detailed first-principles calculations, we investigate the hopping rate\nof vacancies in phosphorene, an emerging elemental 2D material besides\ngraphene. Our work predicts that a direct observation of these mono-vacancies\n(MVs), showing a highly mobile and anisotropic motion, is possible only at low\ntemperatures around 70 K or below where the thermal activity is greatly\nsuppressed. At room temperature, the motion of a MV is sixteen orders faster\nthan that in graphene, because of the low diffusion barrier of 0.3 eV. Built-in\nstrain associated with the vacancies extends far along the zigzag direction\nwhile attenuating rapidly along the armchair direction. We reveal new features\nof the motion of di-vacancies (DVs) in phosphorene via multiple\ndissociation-recombination processes of vacancies owing to a small energy cost\nof ~ 1.05 eV for the splitting of a DV into two MVs. Furthermore, we find that\nuniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag direction can promote the motion of\nMVs, while the tensile strain along the armchair direction has the opposite\neffect. These itinerant features of vacancies, rooted in the unique puckering\nstructure facilitating bond reorganization, enable phosphorene to be a bright\nnew opportunity to broaden the knowledge of the evolution of vacancies, and a\nproper control of the exceedingly active and anisotropic movement of the\nvacancies should be critical for applications based on phosphorene.\n", "  We explore the ground-state phase diagram of the $S\\!=\\!1/2$ two-leg ladder\nwith different isotropic leg interactions and uniform anisotropic rung ones,\nwhich is described by the Hamiltonian ${\\cal H}=J_{{\\rm l},a}\n\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{L}{\\vec S}_{j,a}\\cdot {\\vec S}_{j+1,a}+J_{{\\rm l},b}\n\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{L} {\\vec S}_{j,b}\\cdot {\\vec S}_{j+1,b}+J_{\\rm r}\n\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{L} \\bigl\\{S_{j,a}^x S_{j,b}^x + S_{j,a}^y S_{j,b}^y +\n\\Delta S_{j,a}^z S_{j,b}^z \\bigr\\}$. This system has a frustration when\n$J_{{\\rm l},a} J_{{\\rm l},b}\\!<\\!0$ irrespective of the sign of $J_{\\rm r}$.\nThe phase diagrams on the $\\Delta$ ($0\\!\\leq\\!\\Delta\\!<\\!1$) versus $J_{{\\rm\nl},b}$ plane in the cases of {$J_{{\\rm l},a}\\!=\\!-0.2$ and $J_{{\\rm\nl},a}\\!=\\!0.2$ with $J_{{\\rm r}}\\!=\\!-1$ are determined numerically. We employ\nthe physical consideration, the level spectroscopy analysis of the results\nobtained by the exact diagonalization method and also the density-matrix\nrenormalization-group method. It is found that the non-collinear ferrimagnetic\n(NCFR) state appears as the ground state in the frustrated region of the\nparameters. Furthermore, the direct-product triplet-dimer (TD) state in which\nall rungs form the TD pair is the exact ground state, when $J_{{\\rm\nl},a}\\!+\\!J_{{\\rm l},b}\\!=\\!0$ and $0 \\leq \\Delta \\leq 0.83$. The obtained\nphase diagrams consist of the TD, $XY$ and Haldane phases as well as the NCFR\nphase.\n", "  We develop the theoretical framework for calculating magnetic noise from\nconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials. We describe how local measurements\nof this noise can directly probe the wave-vector dependent transport properties\nof the material over a broad range of length scales, thus providing new insight\ninto a range of correlated phenomena in 2D electronic systems. As an example,\nwe demonstrate how transport in the hydrodynamic regime in an electronic system\nexhibits a unique signature in the magnetic noise profile that distinguishes it\nfrom diffusive and ballistic transport and how this can be used to measure the\nviscosity of the electronic fluid. We employ a Boltzmann approach in a two-time\nrelaxation-time approximation to compute the conductivity of graphene and\nquantitatively illustrate these transport regimes and the experimental\nfeasibility of observing them. Next, we discuss signatures of isolated\nimpurities lodged inside the conducting 2D material. The noise near an impurity\nis found to be suppressed compared to the background by an amount that is\ndirectly proportional to the cross-section of electrons/holes scattering off of\nthe impurity. We use these results to outline an experimental proposal to\nmeasure the temperature dependent level-shift and line-width of the resonance\nassociated with an Anderson impurity.\n", "  Topological order is now being established as a central criterion for\ncharacterizing and classifying ground states of condensed matter systems and\ncomplements categorizations based on symmetries. Fractional quantum Hall\nsystems and quantum spin liquids are receiving substantial interest because of\ntheir intriguing quantum correlations, their exotic excitations and prospects\nfor protecting stored quantum information against errors. Here we show that the\nHamiltonian of the central model of this class of systems, the Toric Code, can\nbe directly implemented as an analog quantum simulator in lattices of\nsuperconducting circuits. The four-body interactions, which lie at its heart,\nare in our concept realized via Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices\n(SQUIDs) that are driven by a suitably oscillating flux bias. All physical\nqubits and coupling SQUIDs can be individually controlled with high precision.\nTopologically ordered states can be prepared via an adiabatic ramp of the\nstabilizer interactions. Strings of qubit operators, including the stabilizers\nand correlations along non-contractible loops, can be read out via a capacitive\ncoupling to read-out resonators. Moreover, the available single qubit\noperations allow to create and propagate elementary excitations of the Toric\nCode and to verify their fractional statistics. The architecture we propose\nallows to implement a large variety of many-body interactions and thus provides\na versatile analog quantum simulator for topological order and lattice gauge\ntheories.\n", "  We present the asymptotic solutions for spacetimes with non-zero cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$ coupled to Maxwell fields, using the Newman-Penrose\nformalism. This extends a recent work that dealt with the vacuum Einstein\n(Newman-Penrose) equations with $\\Lambda\\neq0$. The results are given in two\ndifferent null tetrads: the Newman-Unti and Szabados-Tod null tetrads, where\nthe peeling property is exhibited in the former but not the latter. Using these\nasymptotic solutions, we discuss the mass-loss of an isolated\nelectro-gravitating system with cosmological constant. In a universe with\n$\\Lambda>0$, the physics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation is relatively\nstraightforward compared to those of gravitational radiation: 1) It is clear\nthat outgoing EM radiation results in a decrease to the Bondi mass of the\nisolated system. 2) It is also perspicuous that if any incoming EM radiation\nfrom elsewhere is present, those beyond the isolated system's cosmological\nhorizon would eventually arrive at the spacelike $\\mathcal{I}$ and increase the\nBondi mass of the isolated system. Hence, the (outgoing and incoming) EM\nradiation fields do not couple with $\\Lambda$ in the Bondi mass-loss formula in\nan unusual manner, unlike the gravitational counterpart where outgoing\ngravitational radiation induces non-conformal flatness of $\\mathcal{I}$. These\nasymptotic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-de Sitter equations presented here\nmay be used to extend a raft of existing results based on Newman-Unti's\nasymptotic solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations where $\\Lambda=0$, to\nnow incorporate the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.\n", "  Generalized Parton Distributions are investigated within a holographic\napproach where the string modes in the fifth dimension describe the nucleon in\na bottom-up or AdS/QCD framework. The aim is to bring the AdS/QCD results in\nthe realm of phenomenology in order to extract consequences and previsions. Two\nmain aspects are studied: i) the role of the confining potential needed for\nbreaking conformal invariance and introducing confinement (both: classic\nSoft-Wall and recent Infra-Red potentials are investigated); ii) the extension\nof the predicted GPDs to the entire range of off-forward kinematics by means of\nDouble-Distributions. Higher Fock states are included describing the nucleon as\na superposition of three valence quarks and quark-antiquark pairs and gluons.\n", "  We introduce shaken lattice interferometry with atoms trapped in a\none-dimensional optical lattice. By phase modulating (shaking) the lattice, we\ncontrol the momentum state of the atoms. Through a sequence of shaking\nfunctions, the atoms undergo an interferometer sequence of splitting,\npropagation, reflection, reverse propagation, and recombination. Each shaking\nfunction in the sequence is optimized with a genetic algorithm to achieve the\ndesired momentum state transitions. As with conventional atom interferometers,\nthe sensitivity of the shaken lattice interferometer increases with\ninterrogation time. The shaken lattice interferometer may also be optimized to\nsense signals of interest while rejecting others, such as the measurement of an\nAC inertial signal in the presence of an unwanted DC signal.\n", "  We propose an adaptive scheme of broadening the discrete spectral data from\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations to improve the resolution of\ndynamical properties at finite energies. While the conventional scheme\noverbroadens narrow features at large frequency by broadening discrete weights\nwith constant width in log-frequency, our scheme broadens each discrete\ncontribution individually based on its sensitivity to a z-shift in the\nlogarithmic discretization intervals. We demonstrate that the adaptive\nbroadening better resolves various features in non-interacting and interacting\nmodels at comparable computational cost. The resolution enhancement is more\nsignificant for coarser discretization as typically required in multi-band\ncalculations. At low frequency below the energy scale of temperature, the\ndiscrete NRG data necessarily needs to be broadened on a linear scale. Here we\nprovide a method that minimizes transition artefacts in between these\nbroadening kernels.\n", "  We discuss models with no dynamical vector fields in various dimensions which\nwe claim might have exceptional symmetry on some loci of their parameter space.\nIn particular we construct theories with four supercharges flowing to theories\nwith global symmetry enhancing to $F_4$, $E_6$, and $E_7$. The main evidence\nfor these claims is based on extracting information about the symmetry\nproperties of the theories from their supersymmetric partition functions.\n", "  We consider the production of $b\\bar b$ quarks and Drell-Yan lepton pairs at\nLHC conditions focusing attention on the total transverse momentum of the\nproduced pair and on the azimuthal angle between the momenta of the outgoing\nparticles. Plotting the corresponding distributions in bins of the final state\ninvariant mass, one can reconstruct the full map of the transverse momentum\ndependent parton densities in a proton. We give examples of how can these\ndistributions can look like at the LHC energies.\n", "  In the 1980s, Helffer and Sj\\\"ostrand examined in a series of articles the\nconcentration of the ground state of a Schr\\\"odinger operator in the\nsemiclassical limit. In a similar spirit, and using the asymptotics for the\nSzeg\\\"o kernel, we show a theorem about the localization properties of the\nground state of a Toeplitz operator, when the minimal set of the symbol is a\nfinite set of non-degenerate critical points. Under the same condition on the\nsymbol, for any integer K we describe the first K eigenvalues of the operator.\n", "  Artificial lattices have been employed in many two-dimensional systems,\nincluding those of electrons, atoms and photons, in a quest for massless Dirac\nparticles with flexibility and controllability. Periodically patterned molecule\nassembly and electrostatic gating as well as moir\\'e pattern induced by\nsubstrate, have produced electronic states with linear dispersions from\nisotropic two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Here we demonstrate that\nmassless Dirac fermions with tunable anisotropic characteristics can, in\ngeneral, be generated in highly anisotropic 2DEG under slowly varying external\nperiodic potentials. For patterned few-layer black phosphorus superlattices,\nthe new chiral quasiparticles exist exclusively in an isolated energy window\nand inherit the strong anisotropic properties of pristine black phosphorus.\nThese states exhibit asymmetric Klein tunneling with the direction of incidence\nfor wave packet with perfect transmission deviating from normal incidence by\nmore than 50{\\deg} under an appropriate barrier orientation.\n", "  We consider an analogue de Sitter cosmos in an expanding\nquasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate with dominant dipole-dipole\ninteractions between the atoms or molecules in the ultracold gas. It is\ndemonstrated that a hallmark signature of inflationary cosmology, the scale\ninvariance of the power spectrum of inflaton field correlations, experiences\nstrong modifications when, at the initial stage of expansion, the excitation\nspectrum displays a roton minimum. Dipolar quantum gases thus furnish a viable\nlaboratory tool to experimentally investigate, with well-defined and\ncontrollable initial conditions, whether primordial oscillation spectra\ndeviating from Lorentz invariance at trans-Planckian momenta violate standard\npredictions of inflationary cosmology.\n", "  The rational design of photonic nanostructures consists in anticipating their\noptical response from simple models or as variations of reference systems. This\nstrategy is limited when different objectives are simultaneously targeted.\nInspired from biology, evolutionary approaches drive the morphology of a\nnano-object towards an optimum through several cycles of selection, mutation\nand cross-over, mimicking the process of natural selection. However, their\nextension to scenarii with multiple objectives demands efficient computational\nschemes. We present a numerical technique to design photonic nanostructures\nwith optical properties optimized along several arbitrary objectives. This\ncombination of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms with frequency-domain\nelectro-dynamical simulations is used to design silicon nanostructures resonant\nat user-defined, polarization-dependent wavelengths. The spectra of pixels\nfabricated by electron beam lithography following the optimized design show\nexcellent agreement with the targeted objectives. The method is self-adaptive\nto arbitrary constraints, and therefore particularly interesting for the design\nof complex structures within technological limits.\n", "  We provide new constructions of unitary $t$-designs for general $t$ on one\nqudit and $N$ qubits, and propose a design Hamiltonian, a random Hamiltonian of\nwhich dynamics always forms a unitary design after a threshold time, as a basic\nframework to investigate randomising time evolution in quantum many-body\nsystems. The new constructions are based on recently proposed schemes of\nrepeating random unitaires diagonal in mutually unbiased bases. We first show\nthat, if a pair of the bases satisfies a certain condition, the process on one\nqudit approximately forms a unitary $t$-design after $O(t)$ repetitions. We\nthen construct quantum circuits on $N$ qubits that achieve unitary $t$-designs\nfor $t = o(N^{1/2})$ using $O(t N^2)$ gates, improving the previous result\nusing $O(t^{10}N^2)$ gates in terms of $t$. Based on these results, we present\na design Hamiltonian with periodically changing two-local spin-glass-type\ninteractions, leading to fast and relatively natural realisations of unitary\ndesigns in complex many-body systems.\n", "  We investigate the entropy product formula for various gravitational\ninstantons. We speculate that due to the mass-independent features of the said\ninstantons they are \\emph{universal} as well as they are \\emph{quantized}. For\nisolated Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole, these properties simply\n\\emph{fail}.\n", "  The critical Lyman--Werner flux required for direct collapse blackholes\n(DCBH) formation, or J$_{crit}$, depends on the shape of the irradiating\nspectral energy distribution (SED). The SEDs employed thus far have been\nrepresentative of {{realistic}} single stellar populations. We study the effect\nof binary stellar populations on the formation of DCBH, as a result of their\ncontribution to the Lyman--Werner radiation field. Although binary populations\nwith ages $>$ 10 Myr yield a larger LW photon output, we find that the\ncorresponding values of J$_{crit}$ can be up to 100 times higher than single\nstellar populations. We attribute this to the shape of the binary SEDs as they\nproduce a sub--critical rate of H$^-$ photodetaching 0.76 eV photons as\ncompared to single stellar populations, reaffirming the role that H$^-$ plays\nin DCBH formation. This further corroborates the idea that DCBH formation is\nbetter understood in terms of a critical region in the H$_2$--H$^-$\nphoto--destruction rate parameter space, rather than a single value of LW flux.\n", "  The existence of near-threshold charmed baryon $\\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ implies\nthat the pion and the lightest, isospin-$1$ charmed baryon $\\Sigma_c$ interact\nvery strongly at extremely low energies. Using the two-flavor version of heavy\nhadron chiral perturbation theory, I explore the direct consequences of this\nstrong force by investigating whether the $\\Sigma_c$ can trap two very soft\npions to form any visible hadronic states. The answer is positive. It is found\nwithout tuning any free parameters or ultraviolet cutoff that the state in\nquestion, with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 1({\\frac{1}{2}}^+)$, presents itself\nas a resonance pole only a few MeVs away from the $\\pi \\pi \\Sigma_c$ threshold.\nSubleading corrections are estimated with power-counting arguments, and the\nsmallness of pion momenta is found to facilitate the reliability of the\nanalysis. Because of its proximity in mass, this excited $\\Sigma_c$ resonance\nis speculated to be related to the broad resonance labeled as\n$\\Lambda_c^+(2765)$.\n", "  The unifying feature of glass formers (such as polymers, supercooled liquids,\ncolloids, granulars, spin glasses, superconductors, ...) is a sluggish dynamics\nat low temperatures. Indeed, their dynamics is so slow that thermal equilibrium\nis never reached in macroscopic samples: in analogy with living beings, glasses\nare said to age. Here, we show how to relate experimentally relevant quantities\nwith the experimentally unreachable low-temperature equilibrium phase. We have\nperformed a very accurate computation of the non-equilibrium\nfluctuation-dissipation ratio for the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Ising\nspin glass, by means of large-scale simulations on the special-purpose\ncomputers Janus and Janus II. This ratio (computed for finite times on very\nlarge, effectively infinite, systems) is compared with the equilibrium\nprobability distribution of the spin overlap for finite sizes. The resulting\nquantitative statics-dynamics dictionary, based on observables that can be\nmeasured with current experimental methods, could allow the experimental\nexploration of important features of the spin-glass phase without\nuncontrollable extrapolations to infinite times or system sizes.\n", "  In the present work, we have reported the temperature dependent thermopower\n($\\alpha$) behavior of La$_{0.75}$Ba$_{0.25}$CoO$_{3}$ compound in the\ntemperature range 300-600 K. Using the Heikes formula, the estimated value of\n$\\alpha$ corresponding to high-spin configuration of Co$^{3+}$ and Co$^{4+}$\nions is found to be $\\sim$$16$ $\\mu$V/K, which is close to the experimental\nvalue, $\\sim$13 $\\mu$V/K, observed at $\\sim$600 K. The temperature dependent TE\nbehavior of the compound is studied by combining the WIEN2K and BoltzTrap code.\nThe self consistency field calculations show that the compound have\nferromagnetic ground state structure. The electronic structure calculations\ngive half metallic characteristic with a small gap of $\\sim$50 meV for down\nspin channel. The large and positive value for down spin channel is obtained\ndue to the unique band structure shown by this spin channel. The temperature\ndependent relaxation time for both the spin-channel charge carriers is\nconsidered to study the thermopower data in temperature range 300-600 K. An\nalmost linear values of $\\tau_{up}$ and a non-linear values of $\\tau_{dn}$ are\ntaken into account for evaluation of $\\alpha$. By taking the temperature\ndependent values of relaxation time for both the spin channels, the calculated\nvalues of $\\alpha$ using two current model are found to be in good agreement\nwith experimental values in the temperature range 300-600 K. At 300 K, the\ncalculated value of electrical conductivity by using the same value of\nrelaxation time, i.e. 0.1 $\\times $10$^{-14}$ seconds for spin-up and 0.66\n$\\times $10$^{-14}$ seconds for spin-dn channel, is found to be equal to the\nexperimentally reported value.\n", "  We consider the dissipative coupling between a stochastic Lattice Boltzmann\n(LB) fluid and a particle-based Molecular Dynamics (MD) system, as it was first\nintroduced by Ahlrichs and D\\\"unweg (J. Chem. Phys. 111 (1999) 8225). The fluid\nvelocity at the position of a particle is determined by interpolation, such\nthat a Stokes friction force gives rise to an exchange of momentum between the\nparticle and the surrounding fluid nodes. For efficiency reasons, the LB time\nstep is chosen as a multiple of the MD time step, such that the MD system is\nupdated more frequently than the LB fluid. In this situation, there are\ndifferent ways to implement the coupling: Either the fluid velocity at the\nsurrounding nodes is only updated every LB time step, or it is updated every MD\nstep. It is demonstrated that the latter choice, which enforces momentum\nconservation on a significantly shorter time scale, is clearly superior in\nterms of stability and accuracy, and nevertheless only marginally slower in\nterms of execution speed. The second variant is therefore the recommended\nimplementation.\n", "  Since pioneering works of Hanbury-Brown and Twiss, intensity-intensity\ncorrelations have been widely used in astronomical systems, for example to\ndetect binary stars. They reveal statistics effects and two-particle\ninterference, and offer a decoherence-free probe of the coherence properties of\nlight sources. In the quantum Hall edge channels, the concept of quantum optics\ncan transposed to electrons, and an analogous two-particle interferometry can\nbe developed, in order to characterize single-electron states. We review in\nthis article the recent experimental and theoretical progress on this topic.\n", "  The distribution of forces on the surface of complex, deforming geometries is\nan invaluable output of flow simulations. One particular example of such\ngeometries involves self-propelled swimmers. Surface forces can provide\nsignificant information about the flow field sensed by the swimmers, and are\ndifficult to obtain experimentally. At the same time, simulations of flow\naround complex, deforming shapes can be computationally prohibitive when\nbody-fitted grids are used. Alternatively, such simulations may employ\npenalization techniques. Penalization methods rely on simple Cartesian grids to\ndiscretize the governing equations, which are enhanced by a penalty term to\naccount for the boundary conditions. They have been shown to provide a robust\nestimation of mean quantities, such as drag and propulsion velocity, but the\ncomputation of surface force distribution remains a challenge. We present a\nmethod for determining flow- induced forces on the surface of both rigid and\ndeforming bodies, in simulations using re-meshed vortex methods and Brinkman\npenalization. The pressure field is recovered from the velocity by solving a\nPoisson's equation using the Green's function approach, augmented with a fast\nmultipole expansion and a tree- code algorithm. The viscous forces are\ndetermined by evaluating the strain-rate tensor on the surface of deforming\nbodies, and on a 'lifted' surface in simulations involving rigid objects. We\npresent results for benchmark flows demonstrating that we can obtain an\naccurate distribution of flow-induced surface-forces. The capabilities of our\nmethod are demonstrated using simulations of self-propelled swimmers, where we\nobtain the pressure and shear distribution on their deforming surfaces.\n", "  Consonance is related to the perception of pleasantness arising from a\ncombination of sounds and has been approached quantitatively using mathematical\nrelations, physics, information theory, and psychoacoustics. Tonal consonance\nis present in timbre, musical tuning, harmony, and melody, and it is used for\nconveying sensations, perceptions, and emotions in music. It involves the\nphysical properties of sound waves and is used to study melody and harmony\nthrough musical intervals and chords. From the perspective of complexity, the\nmacroscopic properties of a system with many parts frequently rely on the\nstatistical properties of its constituent elements. Here we show how the tonal\nconsonance parameters for complex tones can be used to study complexity in\nmusic. We apply this formalism to melody, showing that melodic lines in musical\npieces can be described in terms of the physical properties of melodic\nintervals and the existence of an entropy extremalization principle subject to\npsychoacoustic macroscopic constraints with musical meaning. This result\nconnects the human perception of consonance with the complexity of human\ncreativity in music through the physical properties of the musical stimulus.\n", "  Using the charmonium light-front wavefunctions obtained by diagonalizing an\neffective Hamiltonian with the one-gluon exchange interaction and a confining\npotential inspired by light-front holography in the basis light-front\nquantization formalism, we compute production of charmonium states in\ndiffractive deep inelastic scattering and ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions\nwithin the dipole picture. Our method allows us to predict yields of all vector\ncharmonium states below the open flavor thresholds in high-energy deep\ninelastic scattering, proton-nucleus and ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions,\nwithout introducing any new parameters in the light-front wavefunctions. The\nobtained charmonium cross section is in reasonable agreement with experimental\ndata at HERA, RHIC and LHC. We observe that the cross-section ratio\n$\\sigma_{\\Psi(2s)}/\\sigma_{J/\\Psi}$ reveals significant independence of model\nparameters.\n", "  With its electrically tunable light absorption and ultrafast photoresponse,\ngraphene is a promising candidate for high-speed chip-integrated photonics. The\ngeneration mechanisms of photosignals in graphene photodetectors have been\nstudied extensively in the past years. However, the knowledge about efficient\nlight conversion at graphene pn-junctions has not yet been translated into\nhigh-performance devices. Here, we present a graphene photodetector integrated\non a silicon slot-waveguide, acting as a dual-gate to create a pn-junction in\nthe optical absorption region of the device. While at zero bias the\nphoto-thermoelectric effect is the dominant conversion process, an additional\nphotoconductive contribution is identified in a biased configuration. Extrinsic\nresponsivities of 35 mA/W, or 3.5 V/W, at zero bias and 76 mA/W at 300 mV bias\nvoltage are achieved. The device exhibits a 3 dB-bandwidth of 65 GHz, which is\nthe highest value reported for a graphene-based photodetector.\n", "  We extend the classification of supersymmetric locally AdS$_3$ geometries,\nbeyond BTZ black holes, to the Banados geometries, noting that supersymmetries\nare in one-to-one correspondence with solutions to the Hill differential\ncondition. We show that the number of global supersymmetries is an orbit\ninvariant quantity and identify geometries with zero, one, two, three and four\nglobal supersymmetries. As an application of our classification, we exploit\nsupersymmetry, which is preserved locally in the bulk, to determine space-like\nco-dimension two surfaces in AdS$_3$. In the process, we by-pass geodesics or\nmappings of AdS$_3$, neither of which have an analogue in higher dimensions, to\nrecover known Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi surfaces. Our findings suggest\nsupersymmetry can be exploited to find extremal surfaces in holographic\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  A linear correlation is found between the magnitude of nucleon-nucleon\nshort-range correlations and the nuclear binding energy per nucleon with\npairing energy removed. By using this relation, the strengths of\nnucleon-nucleon short-range correlations of some unmeasured nuclei are\npredicted. Discussions on nucleon-nucleon pairing energy and nucleon-nucleon\nshort-range correlations are made. The found nuclear dependence of\nnucleon-nucleon short-range correlations may shed some lights on the\nshort-range structure of nucleus.\n", "  We analyse the smooth and sharp creation of a pointlike source for a\nquantised massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, as\na model for the breakdown of correlations that has been proposed to occur at\nthe horizon of an evaporating black hole. The creation is implemented by a\ntime-dependent self-adjointness parameter at the excised spatial origin. In a\nsmooth creation, the renormalised energy density $\\langle T_{00} \\rangle$ is\nwell defined away from the source, but it is unbounded both above and below:\nthe outgoing pulse contains an infinite negative energy, while a cloud of\ninfinite positive energy lingers near the fully-formed source. In the sharp\ncreation limit, $\\langle T_{00} \\rangle$ diverges everywhere in the timelike\nfuture of the creation event, and so does the response of an Unruh-DeWitt\ndetector that operates in the timelike future of the creation event. The source\ncreation is significantly more singular than the corresponding process in $1+1$\ndimensions, analysed previously, and it may be sufficiently singular to break\nquantum correlations as proposed in a black hole spacetime.\n", "  We report a systematic first-principles investigation of the influence of\ndifferent magnetic insulators on the magnetic proximity effect induced in\ngraphene. Four different magnetic insulators are considered: two ferromagnetic\neuropium chalcogenides namely EuO and EuS and two ferrimagnetic insulators\nyttrium iron garnet (YIG) and cobalt ferrite (CFO). The obtained\nexchange-splitting varies from tens to hundreds of meV. We also find an\nelectron doping induced by YIG and europium chalcogenides substrates, that\nshift the Fermi level up to 0.78 eV and 1.3 eV respectively, whereas hole\ndoping up to 0.5 eV is generated by CFO. Furthermore, we study the variation of\nthe extracted exchange and tight binding parameters as a function of the EuO\nand EuS thicknesses. We show that those parameters are robust to thickness\nvariation such that a single monolayer of magnetic insulator can induce a large\nmagnetic proximity effect on graphene. Those findings pave the way towards\npossible engineering of graphene spin-gating by proximity effect especially in\nview of recent experiments advancement.\n", "  The top-down holographic Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model for low-energy QCD,\naugmented by finite quark masses, has recently been found to be able to\nreproduce the decay pattern of the scalar glueball candidate f0(1710) on a\nquantitative level. In this Letter we show that this model predicts a narrow\npseudoscalar glueball heavier than the scalar glueball and with a very\nrestricted decay pattern involving eta or eta' mesons. Production should be\neither in pairs or in association with eta(') mesons. We discuss the prospect\nof discovery in high-energy hadron collider experiments through central\nexclusive production by comparing with eta' pair production.\n", "  The low-frequency response of systems near the many-body localization phase\ntransition, on either side of the transition, is dominated by contributions\nfrom rare regions that are locally \"in the other phase\", i.e., rare localized\nregions in a system that is typically thermal, or rare thermal regions in a\nsystem that is typically localized. Rare localized regions affect the\nproperties of the thermal phase, especially in one dimension, by acting as\nbottlenecks for transport and the growth of entanglement, whereas rare thermal\nregions in the localized phase act as local \"baths\" and dominate the\nlow-frequency response of the MBL phase. We review recent progress in\nunderstanding these rare-region effects, and discuss some of the open questions\nassociated with them: in particular, whether and in what circumstances a single\nrare thermal region can destabilize the many-body localized phase.\n", "  Strongly interacting one-dimensional (1D) Bose-Fermi mixtures form a tunable\nXXZ spin chain. Within the spin-chain model developed here, all properties of\nthese systems can be calculated from states representing the ordering of the\nbosons and fermions within the atom chain and from the ground-state wave\nfunction of spinless noninteracting fermions. We validate the model by means of\nan exact diagonalization of the full few-body Hamiltonian in the strongly\ninteracting regime. Using the model, we explore the phase diagram of the atom\nchain as a function of the boson-boson (BB) and boson-fermion (BF) interaction\nstrengths and calculate the densities, momentum distributions, and trap-level\noccupancies for up to 17 particles. In particular, we find antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) order and a demixing of the bosons and fermions in\ncertain interaction regimes. We find, however, no demixing for equally strong\nBB and BF interactions in agreement with earlier calculations that combined the\nBethe ansatz with a local-density approximation.\n", "  We investigate non-equilibrium properties of the frustrated Heisenberg\nantiferromagnets on the triangular lattice. Nonequilibrium critical relaxation\nof frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets shows a dynamic transition (or, at\nleast, sharp crossover) at the same temperature $T_{\\rm u}=0.282 J$ as for\nstatic properties due to unbinding of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortices. We show that\nstarting from the high-temperature initial state, due to presence of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortices in the considering system, in a broad temperature range\n$T<T_{\\rm u}$ the dynamic properties in the intermediate time range are similar\nto those of two-dimensional XY model below Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition. The interaction of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-vortices with spin-wave degrees\nof freedom does not emerge until rather long times.\n", "  We simulate the entanglement dynamics in a critical random quantum Ising\nchain with generic perturbations using the time-evolving block decimation\nalgorithm. Starting from a product state, we observe super-logarithmic growth\nof entanglement entropy with time. The numerical result is consistent with the\nanalytical prediction of Vosk and Altman using a real-space renormalization\ngroup technique.\n", "  This paper studies the problem of maximizing the social welfare while\nstabilizing both the physical power network as well as the market dynamics. For\nthe physical power grid a third-order structure-preserving model is considered\ninvolving both frequency and voltage dynamics. By applying the primal-dual\ngradient method to the social welfare problem, a distributed dynamic pricing\nalgorithm in port-Hamiltonian form is obtained. After interconnection with the\nphysical system a closed-loop port-Hamiltonian system of differential-algebraic\nequations is obtained, whose properties are exploited to prove local asymptotic\nstability of the optimal points.\n", "  Recently, generalized equations of type IIB supergravity have been derived\nfrom the requirement of classical kappa-symmetry of type IIB superstring theory\nin the Green-Schwarz formulation. These equations are covariant under\ngeneralized T-duality transformations and hence one may expect a formulation\nsimilar to double field theory (DFT). In this paper, we consider a modification\nof the DFT equations of motion by relaxing a condition for the generalized\ncovariant derivative with an extra generalized vector. In this modified double\nfield theory (mDFT), we show that the flatness condition of the modified\ngeneralized Ricci tensor leads to the NS-NS part of the generalized equations\nof type IIB supergravity. In particular, the extra vector fields appearing in\nthe generalized equations correspond to the extra generalized vector in mDFT.\nWe also discuss duality symmetries and a modification of the string charge in\nmDFT.\n", "  We have performed ground-based transmission spectroscopy of the hot Jupiter\nHAT-P-18b using the ACAM instrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT).\nDifferential spectroscopy over an entire night was carried out at a resolution\nof $R \\approx 400$ using a nearby comparison star. We detect a bluewards slope\nextending across our optical transmission spectrum which runs from 4750 to\n9250\\AA. The slope is consistent with Rayleigh scattering at the equilibrium\ntemperature of the planet (852K). We do not detect enhanced sodium absorption,\nwhich indicates that a high-altitude haze is masking the feature and giving\nrise to the Rayleigh slope. This is only the second discovery of a Rayleigh\nscattering slope in a hot Jupiter atmosphere from the ground, and our study\nillustrates how ground-based observations can provide transmission spectra with\nprecision comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope.\n", "  The variance and uncertainty product of the position and momentum\nmany-particle operators of structureless bosons interacting by a long-range\ninter-particle interaction and trapped in a single-well potential are\ninvestigated. In the first example, of an out-of-equilibrium interaction-quench\nscenario, it is found that, despite the system being fully condensed, already\nwhen a fraction of a particle is depleted differences with respect to the\nmean-field quantities emerge. In the second example, of the pathway from\ncondensation to fragmentation of the ground state, we find out that, although\nthe cloud's density broadens while the system's fragments, the position\nvariance actually decreases, the momentum variance increases, and the\nuncertainty product is not a monotonous function but has a maximum. Implication\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  The phase diagram of cuprate high-temperature superconductors features an\nenigmatic pseudogap region that is characterized by a partial suppression of\nlow energy electronic excitations. Polarized neutron diffraction, Nernst\neffect, THz polarimetery and ultrasound measurements on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$\nsuggest that the pseudogap onset below a temperature T* coincides with a bona\nfide thermodynamic phase transition that breaks time-reversal, four-fold\nrotation and mirror symmetries respectively. However, the full point group\nabove and below T* has not been resolved and the fate of this transition as T*\napproaches the superconducting critical temperature T$_c$ is poorly understood.\nHere we reveal the point group of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ inside its pseudogap and\nneighboring regions using high sensitivity linear and second harmonic optical\nanisotropy measurements. We show that spatial inversion and two-fold rotational\nsymmetries are broken below T* while mirror symmetries perpendicular to the\nCu-O plane are absent at all temperatures. This transition occurs over a wide\ndoping range and persists inside the superconducting dome, with no detectable\ncoupling to either charge ordering or superconductivity. These results suggest\nthat the pseudogap region coincides with an odd-parity order that does not\narise from a competing Fermi surface instability and exhibits a quantum phase\ntransition inside the superconducting dome.\n", "  The advent of microcomputers in the 1970s has dramatically changed our\nsociety. Since then, microprocessors have been made almost exclusively from\nsilicon, but the ever-increasing demand for higher integration density and\nspeed, lower power consumption and better integrability with everyday goods has\nprompted the search for alternatives. Germanium and III-V compound\nsemiconductors are being considered promising candidates for future\nhigh-performance processor generations and chips based on thin-film plastic\ntechnology or carbon nanotubes could allow for embedding electronic\nintelligence into arbitrary objects for the Internet-of-Things. Here, we\npresent a 1-bit implementation of a microprocessor using a two-dimensional\nsemiconductor - molybdenum disulfide. The device can execute user-defined\nprograms stored in an external memory, perform logical operations and\ncommunicate with its periphery. Importantly, our 1-bit design is readily\nscalable to multi-bit data. The device consists of 115 transistors and\nconstitutes the most complex circuitry so far made from a two-dimensional\nmaterial.\n", "  The effects of charge doping on the structural deformation and on the\nelectronic structure of armchair single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles are\ninvestigated through first-principles calculations. In particular, we select a\n(6; 6) SWNT as an example and we calculate a mechanical deformation in the SWNT\nbundles as a function of gate voltage, which could serve as a basis of the\nelectromechanical actuators in an artificial muscle. We find that the\nmagnitudes of the actuation responses such as strain and stress of the (6; 6)\nSWNT bundle in the case of hole doping are substantially larger than those of\nelectron doping. The (6; 6) SWNT bundle also exhibits a low-symmetry and opens\nan energy band gap of about 0.41 eV around the charge neutral condition, which\nallows a semiconductor-to-metal transition in the electron-doping regime when\nthe relative shift of the Fermi energy goes up to 0.60 eV, above which the\nYoung modulus increases.\n", "  The finding that massive galaxies grow with cosmic time fired the starting\ngun for the search of objects which could have survived up to the present day\nwithout suffering substantial changes (neither in their structures, neither in\ntheir stellar populations).\n  Nevertheless, and despite the community efforts, up to now only one firm\ncandidate to be considered one of these relics is known: NGC 1277. Curiously,\nthis galaxy is located at the centre of one of the most rich near galaxy\nclusters: Perseus. Is its location a matter of chance? Should relic hunters\nfocus their search on galaxy clusters?\n  In order to reply this question, we have performed a simultaneous and\nanalogous analysis using simulations (Millennium I-WMAP7) and observations (New\nYork University Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue). Our results in both frameworks\nagree: it is more probable to find relics in high density environments.\n", "  Quantum error correction is instrumental in protecting quantum systems from\nnoise in quantum computing and communication settings. Pauli channels can be\nefficiently simulated and threshold values for Pauli error rates under a\nvariety of error-correcting codes have been obtained. However, realistic\nquantum systems can undergo noise processes that differ significantly from\nPauli noise. In this paper, we present an efficient hard decoding algorithm for\noptimizing thresholds and lowering failure rates of an error-correcting code\nunder general completely positive and trace-preserving (i.e., Markovian) noise.\nWe use our hard decoding algorithm to study the performance of several\nerror-correcting codes under various non-Pauli noise models by computing\nthreshold values and failure rates for these codes. We compare the performance\nof our hard decoding algorithm to decoders optimized for depolarizing noise and\nshow improvements in thresholds and reductions in failure rates by several\norders of magnitude. Our hard decoding algorithm can also be adapted to take\nadvantage of a code's non-Pauli transversal gates to further suppress noise.\nFor example, we show that using the transversal gates of the 5-qubit code\nallows arbitrary rotations around certain axes to be perfectly corrected.\nFurthermore, we show that Pauli twirling can increase or decrease the threshold\ndepending upon the code properties. Lastly, we show that even if the physical\nnoise model differs slightly from the hypothesized noise model used to\ndetermine an optimized decoder, failure rates can still be reduced by applying\nour hard decoding algorithm.\n", "  Analysis of the time series obtained with the O-Mode reflectometer (Rhodes et\nal 1997 Plasma Phys. and Control. Fusion 40 (1998) 493-510) and the gas puff\nimaging (Cziegler, I. et al 2010 Phys. of Plasmas 17, No. 5 (2010) 056120)\nsystems on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak reveals that the turbulent edge density\nfluctuations are chaotic. Supporting evidence for this conclusion includes: the\nobservation of exponential power spectra (which is associated with\nLorentzian-shaped pulses in the time series), the population of the\ncorresponding Bandt-Pompe probability distributions (Bandt and Pompe 2002 Phys.\nRev. Lett. 88 174102), and the location of the signal on the complexity-entropy\nplane (C-H plane) (Rosso et al 2007 Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 154102 (2007)). The\nclassification of edge turbulence as chaotic opens the door for further work to\nunderstand the underlying process and the impact on turbulent transport.\n", "  We initiate the study of how tensor networks reproduce properties of static\nholographic space-times, which are not locally pure anti-de Sitter. We consider\ngeometries that are holographically dual to ground states of defect, interface\nand boundary CFTs and compare them to the structure of the requisite MERA\nnetworks predicted by the theory of minimal updates. When the CFT is deformed,\ncertain tensors require updating. On the other hand, even identical tensors can\ncontribute differently to estimates of entanglement entropies. We interpret\nthese facts holographically by associating tensor updates to turning on\nnon-normalizable modes in the bulk. In passing, we also clarify and complement\nexisting arguments in support of the theory of minimal updates, propose a novel\nansatz called rayed MERA that applies to a class of generalized interface CFTs,\nand analyze the kinematic spaces of the thin wall and AdS3-Janus geometries.\n", "  Nonperturbative methods have been well-developed for QED with the so-called\nt-electric potential steps. In this case a calculation technique is based on\nthe existence of specific exact solutions (in and out solutions) of the Dirac\nequation. However, there are only few cases when such solutions are known.\nHere, we demonstrate that for t-electric potential steps slowly varying with\ntime there exist physically reasonable approximations that maintain the\nnonperturbative character of QED calculations even in the absence of the exact\nsolutions. Defining the slowly varying regime in general terms, we can observe\na universal character of vacuum effects caused by a strong electric field. In\nthe present article, we find universal approximate representations for the\ntotal density of created pairs and vacuum mean values of the current density\nand energy-momentum tensor that hold true for arbitrary t-electric potential\nsteps slowly varying with time. These representations do not require knowledge\nof the corresponding solutions of the Dirac equation, they have a form of\nsimple functionals of a given slowly varying electric field. We establish\nrelations of these representations with leading terms of the derivative\nexpansion approximation. These results allow one to formulate some\nsemiclassical approximations that are not restricted by the smallness of\ndifferential mean numbers of created pairs.\n", "  We study the $P-V$ criticality and phase transition in the extended phase\nspace of anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in higher-dimensional de Rham,\nGabadadze and Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity, treating the cosmological constant\nas pressure and the corresponding conjugate quantity is interpreted as\nthermodynamic volume. Besides the usual small/large black hole phase\ntransitions, the interesting thermodynamic phenomena of reentrant phase\ntransitions (RPTs) are observed for black holes in all $d\\geq6$-dimensional\nspacetime when the coupling coefficients $c_i m^2$ of massive potential satisfy\nsome certain conditions.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much attention for use in\nnanomechanical devices because of their exceptional properties, such as large\nresonant frequencies, low mass, and high quality factors. Here, we report the\nfirst experimental realization of parametric strong coupling between two\nmechanical modes on a single CNT nanomechanical resonator, by applying an extra\nmicrowave pump. This parametric pump method can be used to couple mechanical\nmodes with arbitrary frequency differences. The properties of the mechanical\nresonator are detected by single-electron tunneling at low temperature, which\nis found to be strongly coupled to both modes. The coupling strength between\nthe two modes can be tuned by the pump power, setting the coupling regime from\nweak to strong. This tunability may be useful in further phonon manipulations\nin carbon nanotubes.\n", "  This is an introduction to the approach to the extraction of cosmological\ndynamics from full quantum gravity based on group field theory condensates. We\noutline its general perspective, which sees cosmology as the hydrodynamics of\nthe fundamental quantum gravity degrees of freedom, as well as its concrete\nimplementation within the group field theory formalism. We summarise recent\nwork showing the emergence of a bouncing cosmological dynamics from a\nfundamental group field theory model, and provide a brief but complete survey\nof other results in the literature. Finally, we discuss open issues and\ndirections for further research.\n", "  The Lindblad dynamics of the XX quantum chain with large random fields $h_j$\n(the couplings $J_j$ can be either uniform or random) is considered for\nboundary-magnetization-drivings acting on the two end-spins. Since each\nboundary-reservoir tends to impose its own magnetization, we first study the\nrelaxation spectrum in the presence of a single reservoir as a function of the\nsystem size via some boundary-strong-disorder renormalization approach. The\nnon-equilibrium-steady-state in the presence of two reservoirs can be then\nanalyzed from the effective renormalized Linbladians associated to the two\nreservoirs. The magnetization is found to follow a step profile, as found\npreviously in other localized chains. The strong disorder approach allows to\ncompute explicitly the location of the step of the magnetization profile and\nthe corresponding magnetization-current for each disordered sample in terms of\nthe random fields and couplings.\n", "  We discuss strategies to make inferences on the thermal relic abundance of a\nWeakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) when the same effective\ndimension-six operator that explains an experimental excess in direct detection\nis assumed to drive decoupling at freeze-out, and apply them to the\nproton-philic Spin-dependent Inelastic Dark Matter (pSIDM) scenario, a\nphenomenological set-up containing two states $\\chi_1$ and $\\chi_2$ with\n$m_{\\chi_2}>m_{\\chi_1}$ that we have shown in a previous paper to explain the\nDAMA effect in compliance with the constraints from other detectors. We update\nexperimental constraints on pSIDM, extend the analysis to the most general\nspin-dependent momentum-dependent interactions allowed by non-relativistic\nEffective Field Theory (EFT), and consider for the WIMP velocity distribution\nin our Galaxy both a halo-independent approach and a standard Maxwellian. The\nproblem of calculating the relic abundance by using direct detection data to\nfix the model parameters is affected by a strong sensitivity on $f(v)$ and by\nthe degeneracy between the WIMP local density and the WIMP-nucleon scattering\ncross section. As a consequence, a DM direct detection experiment is not\ndirectly sensitive to the physical cut-off scale of the EFT, but on some\ndimensional combination that does not depend on the actual value of the relic\nabundance. However, such degeneracy can be used to develop a consistency test\non the possibility that the WIMP is a thermal relic in the first place. When we\napply it to the pSIDM scenario we find that only a WIMP with a standard\nspin-dependent interaction ${\\cal O}_{spin}$ with quarks can be a thermal\nrelic, for a galactic velocity distribution that departs from a Maxwellian.\nHowever all the $\\chi_2$ states must have already decayed today, and this\nrequires some additional mechanism besides that provided by the ${\\cal\nO}_{spin}$ operator.\n", "  We studied atomic dynamics of sigma-Fe(100-x)Cr(x) (x=45 and 49.5) alloys\nusing nuclear inelastic scattering of synchrotron radiation. For the\nsigma-Fe55Cr45 alloy, the derived reduced iron-partial density of phonon states\nreveal a huge difference in the low-energy region between magnetic and\nparamagnetic states. The latter implies a ca.36% increase of the sound velocity\nin the magnetic phase, which testifies to a magnetically-induced hardening of\nthe lattice.\n", "  Numerous applications require the simultaneous redistribution of the\nirradiance and phase of a laser beam. The beam shape is thereby determined by\nthe respective application. An elegant way to control the irradiance and phase\nat the same time is from double freeform surfaces. In this work the numerical\ndesign of continuous double freeform surfaces from ray mapping methods for\ncollimated beam shaping with arbitrary irradiances is considered. These methods\nconsist of the calculation of a proper ray mapping between the source and the\ntarget irradiance and the subsequent construction of the freeform surfaces. By\ncombining the law of refraction, the constant optical path length and the\nsurface continuity condition, a partial differential equation (PDE) for the ray\nmapping is derived. It is shown that the PDE can be fulfilled in a small-angle\napproximation by a mapping derived from optimal mass transport with a quadratic\ncost function. To overcome the restriction to the paraxial regime we use this\nmapping as an initial iterate for the simultaneous solution of the Jacobian\nequation and the ray mapping PDE by an optimization. The presented approach\nenables the efficient calculation of compact double freeform surfaces for\ncomplex target irradiances. This is demonstrated by applying it to the design\nof a single-lens and a two-lens system.\n", "  Experiments of time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (Tr-XMCD) and\nresonant x-ray scattering at a beamline BL07LSU in SPring-8 with a\ntime-resolution of under 50 ps are presented. A micro-channel plate is utilized\nfor the Tr-XMCD measurements at nearly normal incidence both in the partial\nelectron and total fluorescence yield (PEY and TFY) modes at the L2,3\nabsorption edges of the 3d transition-metals in the soft x-ray region. The\nultrafast photo-induced demagnetization within 50 ps is observed on the\ndynamics of a magnetic material of FePt thin film, having a distinct threshold\nof the photon density. The spectrum in the PEY mode is less-distorted both at\nthe L2,3 edges compared with that in the TFY mode and has the potential to\napply the sum rule analysis for XMCD spectra in pump-probed experiments.\n", "  We study scenarios of parallel cyclic multiverses which allow for a different\nevolution of the physical constants, while having the same geometry. These\nuniverses are classically disconnected, but quantum-mechanically entangled.\nApplying the thermodynamics of entanglement, we calculate the temperature and\nthe entropy of entanglement. It emerges that the entropy of entanglement is\nlarge at big bang and big crunch singularities of the parallel universes as\nwell as at the maxima of the expansion of these universes. The latter seems to\nconfirm earlier studies that quantum effects are strong at turning points of\nthe evolution of the universe performed in the context of the timeless nature\nof the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and decoherence. On the other hand, the entropy\nof entanglement at big rip singularities is going to zero despite its\npresumably quantum nature. This may be an effect of total dissociation of the\nuniverse structures into infinitely separated patches violating the null energy\ncondition. However, the temperature of entanglement is large/infinite at every\nclassically singular point and at maximum expansion and seems to be a better\nmeasure of quantumness.\n", "  Layered perovskite iridates realize a rare class of Mott insulators that are\npredicted to be strongly spin-orbit coupled analogues of the parent state of\ncuprate high-temperature superconductors. Recent discoveries of pseudogap,\nmagnetic multipolar ordered and possible $d$-wave superconducting phases in\ndoped Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ have reinforced this analogy among the single layer\nvariants. However, unlike the bilayer cuprates, no electronic instabilities\nhave been reported in the doped bilayer iridate Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we show\nthat Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ realizes a weak Mott state with no cuprate analogue by\nusing ultrafast time-resolved optical reflectivity to uncover an intimate\nconnection between its insulating gap and antiferromagnetism. However, we\ndetect a subtle charge density wave-like Fermi surface instability in metallic\nelectron doped Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ at temperatures ($T_{DW}$) close to 200 K via\nthe coherent oscillations of its collective modes, which is reminiscent of that\nobserved in cuprates. The absence of any signatures of a new spatial\nperiodicity below $T_{DW}$ from diffraction, scanning tunneling and\nphotoemission based probes suggests an unconventional and possibly short-ranged\nnature of this density wave order.\n", "  The characteristics of low energy antiproton annihilations on nuclei (e.g.\nhadronization and product multiplicities) are not well known, and Monte Carlo\nsimulation packages that use different models provide different descriptions of\nthe annihilation events. In this study, we measured the particle multiplicities\nresulting from antiproton annihilations on nuclei. The results were compared\nwith predictions obtained using different models in the simulation tools GEANT4\nand FLUKA. For this study, we exposed thin targets (Cu, Ag and Au) to a very\nlow energy antiproton beam from CERN's Antiproton Decelerator, exploiting the\nsecondary beamline available in the AEgIS experimental zone. The antiproton\nannihilation products were detected using emulsion films developed at the\nLaboratory of High Energy Physics in Bern, where they were analysed at the\nautomatic microscope facility. The fragment multiplicity measured in this study\nis in good agreement with results obtained with FLUKA simulations for both\nminimally and heavily ionizing particles.\n", "  Generation of topological phases of matter with SU(3) symmetry in a condensed\nmatter setup is challenging due to the lack of an intrinsic three-fold\nchirality of quasiparticles. We uncover two salient ingredients required to\nexpress a three-component lattice Hamiltonian in a SU(3) format with\nnon-trivial topological invariant. We find that all three SU(3) components must\nbe entangled via a gauge field, with opposite chirality between any two\ncomponents, and there must be band inversions between all {\\it three}\ncomponents in a given eigenstate. For spinless particles, we show that such\nchiral states can be obtained in a tripartite lattice with three inequivalent\nlattice sites in which the Bloch phase associated with the nearest neighbor\nhopping acts as $k$-space gauge field. The second and a more crucial criterion\nis that there must also be an odd-parity Zeeman-like term, i.e.\n$\\sin(k)\\sigma_z$ term where $\\sigma_z$ is the third Pauli matrix defined in\nany two components of the SU(3) basis. Solving the electron-photon interaction\nterm in a periodic potential with a modified tight-binding model, we show that\nsuch a term can be engineered with site-selective photon polarization. Such\nsite selective polarization can be obtained in multiple ways, such as using\nSisyphus cooling technique, polarizer plates, etc. With the $k$-resolved Berry\ncurvature formalism, we delineate the relationship between the SU(3) chirality,\nband inversion, and $k$-space monopoles, governing finite Chern number without\nbreaking the time-reversal symmetry. The topological phase is affirmed by edge\nstate calculation, obeying the bulk-boundary correspondence.\n", "  The angular dependence of the differential cross section of unpolarized\nlight-by-light scattering summed over final polarizations is the same in any\nlow-energy effective theory of quantum electrodynamics and also in Born-Infeld\nelectrodynamics. In this paper we derive general expressions for\npolarization-dependent low-energy scattering amplitudes, including a\nhypothetical parity-violating situation. These are evaluated for quantum\nelectrodynamics with charged scalar or spinor particles, which give strikingly\ndifferent polarization effects. Ordinary quantum electrodynamics is found to\nexhibit rather intricate polarization patterns for linear polarizations,\nwhereas supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics and Born-Infeld electrodynamics\ngive particularly simple forms.\n", "  We introduce a method for the verification of nonclassical light which is\nindependent of the complex interaction between the generated light and the\nmaterial of the detectors. This is accomplished by means of a multiplexing\narrangement. Its theoretical description yields that the coincidence statistics\nof this measurement layout is a mixture of multinomial distributions for any\nclassical light field and any type of detector. This allows us to formulate\nbounds on the statistical properties of classical states. We apply our directly\naccessible method to heralded multiphoton states which are detected with a\nsingle multiplexing step only and two detectors, which are in our work\nsuperconducting transition-edge sensors. The nonclassicality of the generated\nlight is verified and characterized through the violation of the classical\nbounds without the need for characterizing the used detectors.\n", "  Inviscid invariants of flow equations are crucial in determining the\ndirection of the turbulent energy cascade. In this work we investigate a\nvariant of the three dimensional Navier-Stokes equations that shares exactly\nthe same ideal invariants (energy and helicity) and the same symmetries (under\nrotations, reflexions and scale transforms) as the original equations. It is\ndemonstrated that the examined system displays a change in the direction of the\nenergy cascade when varying the value of a free parameter which controls the\nrelative weights of the triadic interactions between different helical Fourier\nmodes. The transition from a forward to inverse cascade is shown to occur at a\ncritical point in a discontinuous manner with diverging fluctuations close to\ncriticality. Our work thus supports the observation that purely isotropic and\nthree dimensional flow configurations can support inverse energy transfer when\ninteractions are altered and that inside all turbulent flows there is a\ncompetition among forward and backward transfer mechanism which might lead to\nmultiple energy-containing turbulent states.\n", "  Superconducting linacs are capable of producing intense, stable, high-quality\nelectron beams that have found widespread applications in science and industry.\nThe 9-cell 1.3-GHz superconducting standing-wave accelerating RF cavity\noriginally developed for $e^+/e^-$ linear-collider applications [B. Aunes, {\\em\net al.} Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams {\\bf 3}, 092001 (2000)] has been broadly\nemployed in various superconducting-linac designs. In this paper we discuss the\ntransfer matrix of such a cavity and present its measurement performed at the\nFermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility. The experimental\nresults are found to be in agreement with analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  There are major discrepancies between recent B-spline R-matrix (BSR) and\nDirac Atomic R-matrix Code (DARC) calculations regarding electron-impact\nexcitation rates for transitions in Mg$^{4+}$, with claims that the DARC\ncalculations are much more accurate. To identify possible reasons for these\ndiscrepancies and to estimate the accuracy of the various results, we carried\nout independent BSR calculations with the same 86 target states as in the\nprevious calculations, but with a different and more accurate representation of\nthe target structure. We find close agreement with the previous BSR results for\nthe majority of transitions, thereby confirming their accuracy. At the same\ntime the differences with the DARC results are much more pronounced. The\ndiscrepancies in the final results for the collision strengths are mainly due\nto differences in the structure description, specifically the inclusion of\ncorrelation effects, and due to the likely occurrence of pseudoresonances. To\nfurther check the convergence of the predicted collision rates, we carried out\neven more extensive calculations involving 316 states of Mg$^{4+}$. Extending\nthe close-coupling expansion results in major corrections for transitions\ninvolving the higher-lying states and allows us to assess the likely\nuncertainties in the existing datasets.\n", "  A one-dimensional (1D) $q$-state Potts model with $N$ sites, $m$-site\ninteraction $K$ in a field $H$ is studied for arbitrary values of $m$. Exact\nresults for the partition function and the two-point correlation function are\nobtained at $H=0$. The system in a field is shown to be self-dual. Using a\nchange of Potts variables, it is mapped onto a standard 2D Potts model, with\nfirst-neighbour interactions $K$ and $H$, on a cylinder with helical boundary\nconditions (BC). The 2D system has a length $N/m$ and a transverse size $m$.\nThus the Potts chain with multi-site interactions is expected to develop a 2D\ncritical singularity along the self-duality line, $(e^{qK}-1)(e^{qH}-1)=q$,\nwhen $N/m\\to\\infty$ and $m\\to\\infty$.\n", "  In this study we focus on the $z\\sim6.6$ Lyman-$\\alpha$ CR7 consisting of\nclump A that is host to a potential direct collapse black hole (DCBH), and two\nmetal enriched star forming clumps B and C. In contrast to claims that\nsignatures of metals rule out the existence of DCBHs, we show that metal\npollution of A from star forming clumps clumps B and C is inevitable, and that\nA can form a DCBH well before its metallicity exceeds the critical threshold of\n$10^{-5}-10^{-6}\\ \\rm Z_{\\odot}$. Assuming metal mixing happens\ninstantaneously, we derive the metallicity of A based on the star formation\nhistory of B and C. We find that treating a final accreting black hole of\n$10^6-10^7\\ \\rm M_{\\odot}$ in A for nebular emission already pushes its\n$H_{160}$ - [3.6] and [3.6]-[4.5] colours into the 3$\\sigma$ limit of\nobservations. Hence, we show that the presence of metals in DCBH hosts is\ninevitable, and that it is the coevolution of the LW radiation field and metals\noriginating from neighbouring galaxies that governs DCBH formation in a\nneighbouring {initially} pristine atomic cooling haloes.\n", "  We show that the $R_K$ puzzle in LHCb data and the discrepancy in the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the muon can be simultaneously explained if a 10\nMeV mass $Z^\\prime$ boson couples to the muon but not the electron, and that\nclear evidence of the nonstandard matter interactions of neutrinos induced by\nthis coupling may be found at DUNE.\n", "  We consider (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity with a reflecting dynamical\nboundary. The boundary cuts off the region of strong coupling and makes our\nmodel causally similar to the spherically-symmetric sector of multidimensional\ngravity. We demonstrate that this model is exactly solvable at the classical\nlevel and possesses an on-shell SL(2,R) symmetry. After introducing general\nclassical solution of the model, we study a large subset of soliton solutions.\nThe latter describe reflection of matter waves off the boundary at low energies\nand formation of black holes at energies above critical. They can be related to\nthe eigenstates of the auxiliary integrable system, the Gaudin spin chain. We\nargue that despite being exactly solvable, the model in the critical regime,\ni.e. at the verge of black hole formation, displays dynamical instabilities\nspecific to chaotic systems. We believe that this model will be useful for\nstudying black holes and gravitational scattering.\n", "  We propose and study systems of coupled atomic wires in a perpendicular\nsynthetic magnetic field as a platform to realize exotic phases of quantum\nmatter. This includes (fractional) quantum Hall states in arrays of many wires\ninspired by the pioneering work [Kane et al. PRL {\\bf{88}}, 036401 (2002)], as\nwell as Meissner phases and Vortex phases in double-wires. With one continuous\nand one discrete spatial dimension, the proposed setup naturally complements\nrecently realized discrete counterparts, i.e. the Harper-Hofstadter model and\nthe two leg flux ladder, respectively. We present both an in-depth theoretical\nstudy and a detailed experimental proposal to make the unique properties of the\nsemi-continuous Harper-Hofstadter model accessible with cold atom experiments.\nFor the minimal setup of a double-wire, we explore how a sub-wavelength spacing\nof the wires can be implemented. This construction increases the relevant\nenergy scales by at least an order of magnitude compared to ordinary optical\nlattices, thus rendering subtle many-body phenomena such as Lifshitz\ntransitions in Fermi gases observable in an experimentally realistic parameter\nregime. For arrays of many wires, we discuss the emergence of Chern bands with\nreadily tunable flatness of the dispersion and show how fractional quantum Hall\nstates can be stabilized in such systems. Using for the creation of optical\npotentials Laguerre-Gauss beams that carry orbital angular momentum, we detail\nhow the coupled atomic wire setups can be realized in non-planar geometries\nsuch as cylinders, discs, and tori.\n", "  A closed formula of the universal part of supersymmetric R\\'enyi entropy\n$S_q$ for six-dimensional $(1,0)$ superconformal theories is proposed. Within\nour arguments, $S_q$ across a spherical entangling surface is a cubic\npolynomial of $\\nu=1/q$, with $4$ coefficients expressed as linear combinations\nof the 't Hooft anomaly coefficients for the $R$-symmetry and gravitational\nanomalies. As an application, we establish linear relations between the\n$c$-type Weyl anomalies and the 't Hooft anomaly coefficients. We make a\nconjecture relating the supersymmetric R\\'enyi entropy to an equivariant\nintegral of the anomaly polynomial in even dimensions and check it against\nknown data in four dimensions and six dimensions.\n", "  The detection of high-redshift ($z>$3) blazars enables the study of the\nevolution of the most luminous relativistic jets over cosmic time. More\nimportantly, high-redshift blazars tend to host massive black holes and can be\nused to constrain the space density of heavy black holes in the early Universe.\nHere, we report the first detection with the \\fermi-Large Area Telescope of\nfive \\gm-ray emitting blazars beyond $z=3.1$, more distant than any blazars\npreviously detected in $\\gamma$-rays. Among these five objects, NVSS\nJ151002+570243 is now the most distant known \\gm-ray emitting blazar at\n$z=4.31$. These objects have steeply falling \\gm-ray spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) and, those that have been observed in X-rays, a very hard\nX-ray spectrum, both typical of powerful blazars. Their Compton dominance\n(ratio of the inverse Compton to synchrotron peak luminosities) is also very\nlarge ($>20$). All of these properties place these objects among the most\nextreme members of the blazar population. Their optical spectra and the\nmodeling of their optical-UV SEDs confirm that these objects harbor massive\nblack holes ($M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^{8-10} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). We find that, at\n$z\\approx4$, the space density of $>10^{9} {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ black holes hosted\nin radio-loud and radio-quiet active galactic nuclei are similar, implying that\nradio-loudness may play a key role in rapid black hole growth in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  We discuss thermal transport through a Josephson junction in a time-dependent\nsituation. We write the spectral representation of the heat current pumped by a\ngeneric drive. This enables separation of the dissipative and reactive\ncontributions, of which the latter do not contribute to long-time averages. We\ndiscuss the physical interpretation, and note that the condensate heat current\nidentified in [K. Maki and A. Griffin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 15, 921 (1965)] is\npurely reactive. The results enable a convenient description of heat exchanges\nin a Josephson system in the presence of an external drive, with possible\napplications for the implementation of new cooling devices.\n", "  By analysing the K2 short-cadence photometry we detect starspot occultation\nevents in the lightcurve of WASP-107, the host star of a warm-Saturn exoplanet.\nWASP-107 also shows a rotational modulation with a period of 17.5 +/- 1.4 d.\nGiven that the rotational period is nearly three times the planet's orbital\nperiod, one would expect in an aligned system to see starspot occultation\nevents to recur every three transits. The absence of such occultation\nrecurrences suggests a misaligned orbit unless the starspots' lifetimes are\nshorter than the star's rotational period. We also find stellar variability\nresembling gamma Doradus pulsations in the lightcurve of WASP-118, which hosts\nan inflated hot Jupiter. The variability is multi-periodic with a variable\nsemi-amplitude of about 200 ppm. In addition to these findings we use the K2\ndata to refine the parameters of both systems, and report non-detections of\ntransit-timing variations, secondary eclipses and any additional transiting\nplanets. We used the upper limits on the secondary-eclipse depths to estimate\nupper limits on the planetary geometric albedos of 0.7 for WASP-107b and 0.2\nfor WASP-118b.\n", "  Soft particulate media include a wide range of systems involving athermal\ndissipative particles both in non-living and biological materials.\nCharacterization of flows of particulate media is of great practical and\ntheoretical importance. A fascinating feature of these systems is the existence\nof a critical rigidity transition in the dense regime dominated by highly\nintermittent fluctuations that severely affects the flow properties. Here, we\nunveil the underlying mechanisms of rare fluctuations in soft particulate\nflows. We find that rare fluctuations have different origins above and below\nthe critical jamming density and become suppressed near the jamming transition.\nWe then conjecture a time-independent local fluctuation relation, which we\nverify numerically, and that gives rise to an effective temperature. We discuss\nsimilarities and differences between our proposed effective temperature with\nthe conventional kinetic temperature in the system by means of a universal\nscaling collapse.\n", "  Muon spin relaxation ($\\mu$SR) measurements were carried out on\nSrDy$_2$O$_4$, a frustrated magnet featuring short range magnetic correlations\nat low temperatures. Zero-field muon spin depolarization measurements\ndemonstrate that fast magnetic fluctuations are present from $T=300$ K down to\n20 mK. The coexistence of short range magnetic correlations and fluctuations at\n$T=20$ mK indicates that SrDy$_2$O$_4$ features a spin liquid ground state.\nLarge longitudinal fields affect weakly the muon spin depolarization, also\nsuggesting the presence of fast fluctuations. For a longitudinal field of\n$\\mu_0H=2$ T, a non-relaxing asymmetry contribution appears below $T=6$ K,\nindicating considerable slowing down of the magnetic fluctuations as\nfield-induced magnetically-ordered phases are approached.\n", "  In the framework of the Einstein-aether theory we consider a cosmological\nmodel, which describes the evolution of the unit dynamic vector field with\nactivated rotational degree of freedom. We discuss exact solutions of the\nEinstein-aether theory, for which the space-time is of the G\\\"odel-type, the\nvelocity four-vector of the aether motion is characterized by a non-vanishing\nvorticity, thus the rotational vectorial modes can be associated with the\nsource of the universe rotation. The main goal of our paper is to study the\nmotion of test relativistic particles with vectorial internal degree of freedom\n(spin or polarization), which is coupled to the unit dynamic vector field. The\nparticles are considered as the test ones in the given space-time background of\nthe G\\\"odel-type; the spin (polarization) coupling to the unit dynamic vector\nfield is modeled using exact solutions of three types. The first exact solution\ndescribes the aether with arbitrary Jacobson's coupling constants; the second\none relates to the case, when the Jacobson's constant responsible for the\nvorticity is vanishing; the third exact solution is obtained using three\nconstraints for the coupling constants. The analysis of the exact expressions,\nwhich are obtained for the particle momentum and for the spin (polarization)\nfour-vector components, shows that the interaction of the spin (polarization)\nwith the unit vector field induces a rotation, which is additional to the\ngeodesic precession of the spin (polarization) associated with the universe\nrotation as a whole.\n", "  The security of code-based cryptosystems such as the McEliece cryptosystem\nrelies primarily on the difficulty of decoding random linear codes. The best\ndecoding algorithms are all improvements of an old algorithm due to Prange:\nthey are known under the name of information set decoding techniques. It is\nalso important to assess the security of such cryptosystems against a quantum\ncomputer. This research thread started in Overbeck and Sendrier's 2009 survey\non code-based cryptography, and the best algorithm to date has been Bernstein's\nquantising of the simplest information set decoding algorithm, namely Prange's\nalgorithm. It consists in applying Grover's quantum search to obtain a\nquadratic speed-up of Prange's algorithm. In this paper, we quantise other\ninformation set decoding algorithms by using quantum walk techniques which were\ndevised for the subset-sum problem by Bernstein, Jeffery, Lange and Meurer.\nThis results in improving the worst-case complexity of $2^{0.06035n}$ of\nBernstein's algorithm to $2^{0.05869n}$ with the best algorithm presented here\n(where $n$ is the codelength).\n", "  We investigate the superfluid behavior of a two-dimensional (2D) Bose gas of\n$^{87}$Rb atoms using classical field dynamics. In the experiment by R.\nDesbuquois \\textit{et al.}, Nat. Phys. \\textbf{8}, 645 (2012), a 2D\nquasicondensate in a trap is stirred by a blue-detuned laser beam along a\ncircular path around the trap center. Here, we study this experiment from a\ntheoretical perspective. The heating induced by stirring increases rapidly\nabove a velocity $v_c$, which we define as the critical velocity. We identify\nthe superfluid, the crossover, and the thermal regime by a finite, a sharply\ndecreasing, and a vanishing critical velocity, respectively. We demonstrate\nthat the onset of heating occurs due to the creation of vortex-antivortex\npairs. A direct comparison of our numerical results to the experimental ones\nshows good agreement, if a systematic shift of the critical phase-space density\nis included. We relate this shift to the absence of thermal equilibrium between\nthe condensate and the thermal wings, which were used in the experiment to\nextract the temperature. We expand on this observation by studying the full\nrelaxation dynamics between the condensate and the thermal cloud.\n", "  The development of short- and long-range magnetic order induced in a\nfrustrated zig-zag ladder compound SrDy2O4 by an applied field is studied using\nneutron diffraction techniques. In zero field, SrDy2O4 lacks long-range\nmagnetic order down to temperatures as low as 60 mK, and the observed powder\nneutron diffraction (PND) patterns are dominated by very broad diffuse\nscattering peaks. Single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the\nzero-field magnetic structure consists of a collection of antiferromagnetic\nchains running along the c axis and that there is very little correlation\nbetween the chains in the ab plane. In an applied magnetic field, the broad\ndiffuse scattering features in PND are gradually replaced by much sharper\npeaks, however, the pattern remains rather complex, reflecting the highly\nanisotropic nature of SrDy2O4. Single crystal neutron diffraction shows that a\nmoderate field applied along the b axis induces an up-up-down magnetic order\nassociated with a 1/3-magnetisation plateau, in which magnetic correlation\nlength in the ab plane is significantly increased, but it nevertheless remains\nfinite. The resolution limited k = 0 peaks associated with a ferromagnetic\narrangement appear in powder and single crystal neutron diffraction patterns in\nfields of 2.5 T and above.\n", "  To obtain a unified framework for symmetric and asymmetric heterotic orbifold\nconstructions we provide a systematic study of Narain compactifications\norbifolded by finite order T-duality subgroups. We review the generalized\nvielbein that parametrizes the Narain moduli space (i.e. the metric, the\nB-field and the Wilson lines) and introduce a convenient basis of generators of\nthe heterotic T-duality group. Using this we generalize the space group\ndescription of orbifolds to Narain orbifolds. This yields a unified,\ncrystallographic description of the orbifold twists, shifts as well as Narain\nmoduli. In particular, we derive a character formula that counts the number of\nunfixed Narain moduli after orbifolding. Moreover, we develop new machinery\nthat may ultimately open up the possibility for a full classification of Narain\norbifolds. This is done by generalizing the geometrical concepts of Q-, Z- and\naffine classes from the theory of crystallography to the Narain case. Finally,\nwe give a variety of examples illustrating various aspects of Narain orbifolds,\nincluding novel T-folds.\n", "  Given a locally convex vector space with a topology induced by Hilbert\nseminorms and a continuous bilinear form on it we construct a topology on its\nsymmetric algebra such that the usual star product of exponential type becomes\ncontinuous. Many properties of the resulting locally convex algebra are\nexplained. We compare this approach to various other discussions of convergent\nstar products in finite and infinite dimensions. We pay special attention to\nthe case of a Hilbert space and to nuclear spaces.\n", "  We discuss the propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves in the\npost-Newtonian approximation of the general theory of relativity. We consider\ndiffraction of EM waves in the static gravitational field of a massive\nmonopole. We develop a wave-theoretical description of the solar gravitational\nlens (SGL) and show that with its enormous magnifying power of $\\sim 10^{11}$\n(for $\\lambda=1~\\mu$m) and angular resolution of $\\lesssim 10^{-10}$ arcsec,\nthe SGL may be used for direct megapixel imaging of an exoplanet.\n", "  Dirac electrons in a single-component molecular conductor [Pd(dddt)$_2$]\nunder pressure have been examined using a tight-binding model which consists of\nHOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) and LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular\nOrbital) functions in four molecules per unit cell. The Dirac cone between the\nconduction and valence bands comes from the property that HOMO has ungerade\nsymmetry and LUMO has gerade symmetry. The Dirac point forms a loop in the\nthree-dimensional Brillouin zone, which is symmetric with respect to the plane\nof $k_y$ = 0 where $k_y$ is the intralayer momentum along the molecular\nstacking direction, i.e., with the largest (HOMO-HOMO, LUMO-LUMO) transfer\nenergy. The parity at TRIM (time reversal invariant momentum) is calculated\nusing the inversion symmetry around the lattice point of the crystal. It is\nshown that such an exotic Dirac electron is understood from the parity of the\nwave function at the TRIM and also from an effective Hamiltonian.\n", "  We use a locally constant field approximation (LCFA) to study the one-loop\nHeisenberg-Euler effective action in a particular class of slowly varying\ninhomogeneous electric fields of Lorentzian shape with $0\\leq d\\leq 4$\ninhomogeneous directions. We show that for these fields, the LCFA of the\nHeisenberg-Euler effective action can be represented in terms of a single\nparameter integral, with the constant field effective Lagrangian with rescaled\nargument as integration kernel. The imaginary part of the Heisenberg-Euler\neffective action contains information about the instability of the quantum\nvacuum towards the formation of a state with real electrons and positrons.\nHere, we in particular focus on the dependence of the instantaneous vacuum\ndecay rate on the dimension $d$ of the field inhomogeneity. Specifically for\nweak fields, we find an overall parametric suppression of the effect with\n$(E_0/E_{\\rm cr})^{d/2}$, where $E_0$ is the peak field strength of the\ninhomogeneity and $E_{\\rm cr}$ the critical electric field strength.\n", "  For multipartite entangled states, entanglement monogamy is an important\nproperty. We investigate the monogamy relations for multiqubit generalized\nW-class states. We present new analytical monogamy inequalities satisfied by\nthe $x$-th power of the dual of convex-roof extended negativity, namely CRENOA,\nfor $x\\geq2$ and $x\\leq0$. As for The squared R\\'enyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement\n(SR$\\alpha$E) with $\\alpha$ in the region $[(\\sqrt 7 - 1)/2,(\\sqrt {13} -\n1)/2]$, we show the upper bound of SR$\\alpha$E.\n", "  Methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite solar cells (CH3NH3PbY3, where Y =\nI(3-x)Brx=1-3, I(3-x)Clx=1-3, Br(3-x)Cl x=1-3, and IBrCl) are photonic\nsemiconductors. Researches on various fundamental and technological aspects of\nthese materials are extensively on-going to make them stable environmentally\nand for commercialization. Research studies addressing these materials as\norganometallic are massively and repeatedly appearing in very reputable, highly\ncited and high impact peer-reviewed research publications, including, for\nexample, Energy and Environmental Science, Nature Chemistry, Nature\nCommunication, Advanced Materials, Science, ACS Nano, and many other chemistry\nand materials based journals of the Wiley, Elsevier, Springer and Macmillan\nPublishers, and the Royal and American Society Sciences. Herein, we candidly\naddresses the question: whether should scientists in the perovskite and\nnanomaterials science communities refer CH3NH3PbY3 and their mixed halogen\nderivatives as organometallic?\n", "  We established the allowed parameters of two-Higgs doublet model(2HDM) from\nflavor physics observables, precisely from rare $B$ meson decays. In our\nanalysis most formidable constraints on the 2HDM parameters arise from the\nbranching ratio of rare radiative $B$ meson decay i.e., $B\\to X_{s}\\gamma$.\nHowever, the constraints arising from the branching ratio of\n$B_{s}\\to\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay in $m_{H^{\\pm}}-\\tan\\beta$ plane give\n$m_{H^{\\pm}} >$ 80 GeV for the value of $\\tan\\beta\\sim 2$, that is in agreement\nwith large electron-positron collider (LEP) data. Furthermore, we also\ninvestigate the bounds on the $CP$-even $m_{H}$ and $CP$-odd $m_{A^{0}}$ Higgs\nboson not only from above mentioned physical observables, but also from the\nzero crossing of the forward-backward asymmetry of $B\\to\nK^{\\ast}\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay. Therefore, these bounds on parameters of the\n2HDM will provides a fertile ground to test the 2HDM at current and future\n$B$-physics experiments.\n", "  The esoteric importance of intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction to\ndesign novel methylammonium trihalide organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite solar\ncell materials is uncovered, establishing the unified structure-property\nrelationship between the calculated Y...H intermolecular hydrogen bonding\ndistance and the experimentally reported onset of optical absorption (bandgap)\nfor the bulk geometries of the ten-membered methylammonium lead trihalide\n(CH3NH3PbY3) perovskite solar cell series, where Y = X (X = Cl, Br, I) and the\nmixed halogen derivatives. The same relationship is also revealed for the\nten-membered methylammonium tin trihalide (CH3NH3SnY3) perovskite solar cell\nseries. The relationship unequivocally demonstrates that the intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding interaction does not only enforce the aforesaid materials to\nbecome functional for optoelectronic application, but also serve as an asset to\npartially address the often debated question what is the role played by the\nCH3NH3+ organic cation.\n", "  We present a list of optimized damping range parameters $s_R$ to be used with\nthe Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals dispersion-correction scheme [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 102, 073005 (2009)]. The optimal $s_R$ are obtained for seven popular\ngeneralized-gradient approximation exchange-correlation density functionals:\nPBE, RPBE, revPBE, PBEsol, BLYP, AM05 and PW91. The optimization is carried out\nin the standard way by minimizing the mean absolute error of the S22 test set,\nwhere the reference interaction energies are taken from coupled-cluster\ncalculations. With the optimized range parameters, we assess the impact of van\nder Waals corrections on the ability of these functionals to accurately\ndescribe structural and thermodynamic properties of liquid water: radial\ndistribution functions, self-diffusion coefficients and standard molar\nentropies.\n", "  We study diffusion and butterfly velocity ($v_B$) in two holographic models,\nlinear axion and axion-dilaton model, with a momentum relaxation parameter\n($\\beta$) at finite density or chemical potential ($\\mu$). Axion-dilaton model\nis particularly interesting since it shows linear-$T$-resistivity, which may\nhave something to do with the universal bound of diffusion. At finite density,\nthere are two diffusion constants $D_\\pm$ describing the coupled diffusion of\ncharge and energy. By computing $D_\\pm$ exactly, we find that in the incoherent\nregime ($\\beta/T \\gg 1,\\ \\beta/\\mu \\gg 1$) $D_+$ is identified with the charge\ndiffusion constant ($D_c$) and $D_-$ is identified with the energy diffusion\nconstant ($D_e$). In the coherent regime, at very small density, $D_\\pm$ are\n`maximally' mixed in the sense that $D_+(D_-)$ is identified with $D_e(D_c)$,\nwhich is opposite to the case in the incoherent regime. In the incoherent\nregime $D_e \\sim C_- \\hbar v_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_- = 1/2$ or 1 so it is\nuniversal independently of $\\beta$ and $\\mu$. However, $D_c \\sim C_+ \\hbar\nv_B^2 / k_B T$ where $C_+ = 1$ or $ \\beta^2/16\\pi^2 T^2$ so, in general, $C_+$\nmay not saturate to the lower bound in the incoherent regime, which suggests\nthat the characteristic velocity for charge diffusion may not be the butterfly\nvelocity. We find that the finite density does not affect the diffusion\nproperty at zero density in the incoherent regime.\n", "  Precise (sub-meter level) real-time navigation using a space-capable\nsingle-frequency global positioning system (GPS) receiver and ultra-rapid\n(real-time) ephemerides from the international global navigation satellite\nsystems service is proposed for low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites. The C/A\ncode and L1 carrier phase measurements are combined and single-differenced to\neliminate first-order ionospheric effects and receiver clock offsets. A\nrandom-walk process is employed to model the phase ambiguities in order to\nabsorb the time-varying and satellite-specific higher-order measurement errors\nas well as the GPS clock correction errors. A sequential Kalman filter which\nincorporates the known orbital dynamic model is developed to estimate orbital\nstates and phase ambiguities without matrix inversion. Real flight data from\nthe single-frequency GPS receiver onboard China's SJ-9A small satellite are\nprocessed to evaluate the orbit determination accuracy. Statistics from\ninternal orbit assessments indicate that three-dimensional accuracies of better\nthan 0.50 m and 0.55 mm/s are achieved for position and velocity, respectively.\n", "  We investigated the evolution of magnetism in the UIr1-xRhxGe system by the\nsystematic study of high-quality single crystals. Lattice parameters of both\nparent compounds are very similar resulting in almost identical nearest\ninteratomic uranium distance close to the Hill limit. We established the x-T\nphase diagram of the UIr1-xRhxGe system and found a discontinuous\nantiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic boundary at xcrit = 0.56 where a local minimum\nin ordering temperature and maximum of the Sommerfeld coefficient 175 mJ/mol K2\noccurs in the UCoGe-URhGe-UIrGe system, signaling an increase in magnetic\nfluctuations. However, a quantum critical point is not realized because of the\nfinite ordering temperature at xcrit. A magnon gap on the antiferromagnetic\nside abruptly suppresses magnetic fluctuations. We find a field-induced first\norder transition in the vicinity of the critical magnetic field along the b\naxis in the entire UIr1-xRhxGe system including the ferromagnetic region\nUCo0.6Rh0.4Ge - URhGe.\n", "  Face-centered cubic (FCC) is an important crystal structure, and there are\nten elemental FCC metals (Al, Ag, Au, Ca, Cu, Pb, Pd, Pt, Rh, and Sr) that have\nthis structure. Three of them could be used as photocathodes (Au, Rh, Pt, and\nPd have very high work functions; Ca and Sr are very reactive). Au has high\nwork function, but it is included for the sake of the completeness of noble\nmetals' photoemission investigation. In this paper, we will apply the\nnonparametric photoemission model to investigate these four remaining FCC\nphotocathodes; two noble metals (Cu and Au), two p-block metals (Al and Pb).\nApart from the fact that the direct photoemission is dominant for most FCC\nphotocathodes, photoemission from a surface state has also been observed for\nthe (111)-face of noble metals. The optical properties of the (111) surface\nstate will be extensively reviewed both experimentally and theoretically, and a\nsurface state DFT evaluation will be performed to show that the photocathode\ngenerated hollow cone illumination (HCI) can be realized.\n", "  Due to the non-ionizing property, researchers have chosen to investigate\nterahertz radiation (THz) Imaging instrumentation for Bio-Sensing applications.\nThe present work is to design and fabricate a near field lens that can focus\nguided terahertz radiation to a microscopic region for the detection of\ncancer-affected cells in Biological tissue. Operational characteristics such as\nfield of view, optical loss factor, and hydrophobicity must be included to\nachieve an effective design of the lens.\n", "  When a droplet (which size is characterized by R) is confined between two\nparallel planes, its morphology will change accordingly to either varying the\nvolume of the droplet or the separation (characterized by h) between the\nplanes. We are aiming at investigating how such a geometric confinement affects\nthe wetting behaviours of a droplet. Our focus lies on two distinguished\nregimes: (1) a pancake shape in a Hele-Shaw cell when the droplet is highly\ncompressed (i.e. h/R << 1), in which particular attention is paid on nonwetting\nand wetting cases, respectively; and (2) a liquid Hertzian contact rendered by\na slight confinement (i.e. h/(2R) --> 1) in a nonwetting case. To realize this\naim, we first develop strict analytical expressions of the shape of the droplet\nwhich are available for arbitrary contact angles between the liquid and the\nsolid planes, but in which the elliptic integrals indicate that these solutions\nare implicit. By employing asymptotic methods, we are able to give expressions\nof relevant geometrical and physical parameters (the Laplace pressure, droplet\nvolume, surface energy and external force) in terms of sole functions of R and\nh in an explicit manner. Comparisons suggest that over a large range of h/R,\nour asymptotic results quantitatively agree well with the numerical solutions\nof the analytical expressions. This systematic study of the parameter space\nallows a comprehensive understanding of the geometric confinement on wetting,\nespecially a wide existence of logarithmic behaviours in a liquid Hertzian\ncontact, to be identified.\n", "  We present an algorithm to compute the Jordan chain of a nearly defective\nmatrix with a $2\\times2$ Jordan block. The algorithm is based on an\ninverse-iteration procedure and only needs information about the invariant\nsubspace corresponding to the Jordan chain, making it suitable for use with\nlarge matrices arising in applications, in contrast with existing algorithms\nwhich rely on an SVD. The algorithm produces the eigenvector and Jordan vector\nwith $O(\\varepsilon)$ error, with $\\varepsilon$ being the distance of the given\nmatrix to an exactly defective matrix. As an example, we demonstrate the use of\nthis algorithm in a problem arising from electromagnetism, in which the matrix\nhas size $212^2\\times 212^2$. An extension of this algorithm is also presented\nwhich can achieve higher order convergence [$O(\\varepsilon^2)$] when the matrix\nderivative is known.\n", "  In this paper, some preliminary considerations on the feedback systems for\nFCC-ee are developed. Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems have been designed in the\nlast years for other e+/e- colliders like PEP-II, KEKB, DAFNE, SuperB and\nSuperKEKB. In all these cases, similar approaches have been implemented, even\nif some design variations have been suitable or necessary for different\nreasons. Bunch-by-bunch feedback systems are based on the concept that the\nbarycenter of each bunch moves with harmonic motion around the equilibrium\npoint in three planes (L, H, V). The feedback copes with the forcing excitation\nby producing damping correction for each individual bunch. This is possible\nmanaging every single bunch by a dedicated processing channel in real time. For\nFCC-ee the very high number of stored bunches requires much more power in terms\nof processing capability for the feedback systems. Ring length (100 Km) and\nvery low fractional tunes must be also considered requiring for a more\neffective strategy in the feedback system design.\n", "  Observations of infrared and optical light curves of hot Jupiters have\ndemonstrated that the peak brightness is generally offset eastward from the\nsubstellar point [1,2]. This observation is consistent with hydrodynamic\nnumerical simulations that produce fast, eastward directed winds which advect\nthe hottest point in the atmosphere eastward of the substellar point [3,4].\nHowever, recent continuous Kepler measurements of HAT-P-7 b show that its peak\nbrightness offset varies significantly in time, with excursions such that the\nbrightest point is sometimes westward of the substellar point [5]. These\nvariations in brightness offset require wind variability, with or without the\npresence of clouds. While such wind variability has not been seen in\nhydrodynamic simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, it has been seen in\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations [6]. Here we show that MHD simulations of\nHAT-P-7 b indeed display variable winds and corresponding variability in the\nposition of the hottest point in the atmosphere. Assuming the observed\nvariability in HAT-P-7 b is due to magnetism we constrain its minimum magnetic\nfield strength to be 6\\,G. Similar observations of wind variability on hot\ngiant exoplanets, or lack thereof, could help constrain their magnetic field\nstrengths. Since dynamo simulations of these planets do not exist and\ntheoretical scaling relations [7] may not apply, such observational constraints\ncould prove immensely useful.\n", "  One of the main features of a Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is the presence\nof two additional neutral Higgs states, besides the one mimicking the ~125 GeV\nstate observed at the LHC. The three Higgs bosons of a 2HDM can be produced at\nthe LHC either singly via gluon fusion or in pairs with each other. When\nanalyzing their pair production, the emphasis is laid on gluon-initiated\nprocesses, and the electroweak (EW) production is generally not treated on the\nsame footing, assuming its contribution to be highly subleading. We show here\nthat when the sum of the masses of the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs\nbosons in the Type-I 2HDM is smaller than the Z-boson mass, their EW pair\nproduction can dominate over QCD pair production by orders of magnitude.\n", "  Membrane proteins constitute a large portion of the human proteome and\nperform a variety of important functions as membrane receptors, transport\nproteins, enzymes, signaling proteins, and more. The computational studies of\nmembrane proteins are usually much more complicated than those of globular\nproteins. Here we propose a new continuum model for Poisson-Boltzmann\ncalculations of membrane channel proteins. Major improvements over the existing\ncontinuum slab model are as follows: 1) The location and thickness of the slab\nmodel are fine-tuned based on explicit-solvent MD simulations. 2) The highly\ndifferent accessibility in the membrane and water regions are addressed with a\ntwo-step, two-probe grid labeling procedure, and 3) The water pores/channels\nare automatically identified. The new continuum membrane model is optimized (by\nadjusting the membrane probe, as well as the slab thickness and center) to best\nreproduce the distributions of buried water molecules in the membrane region as\nsampled in explicit water simulations. Our optimization also shows that the\nwidely adopted water probe of 1.4 {\\AA} for globular proteins is a very\nreasonable default value for membrane protein simulations. It gives an overall\nminimum number of inconsistencies between the continuum and explicit\nrepresentations of water distributions in membrane channel proteins, at least\nin the water accessible pore/channel regions that we focus on. Finally, we\nvalidate the new membrane model by carrying out binding affinity calculations\nfor a potassium channel, and we observe a good agreement with experiment\nresults.\n", "  The ability to engineer metamaterials with tunable nonlinear optical\nproperties is crucial for nonlinear optics. Traditionally, metals have been\nemployed to enhance nonlinear optical interactions through field localization.\nHere, inspired by the electronic properties of materials, we introduce and\ndemonstrate experimentally an asymmetric metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM)\nmetamaterial that exhibits a large and electronically tunable effective\nsecond-order optical susceptibility (\\c{hi}(2)). The induced \\c{hi}(2)\noriginates from the interaction between the third-order optical susceptibility\nof the semiconductor (\\c{hi}(3)) with the engineered internal electric field\nresulting from the two metals with dissimilar work function at its interfaces.\nWe demonstrate a five times larger second-harmonic intensity from the MSM\nmetamaterial, compared to contributions from its constituents with electrically\ntunable nonlinear coefficient ranging from 2.8 to 15.6 pm/V.\n", "  An analysis software was developed for the high aspect ratio optical scanning\nsystem in the Detec- tor Laboratory of the University of Helsinki and the\nHelsinki Institute of Physics. The system is used e.g. in the quality assurance\nof the GEM-TPC detectors being developed for the beam diagnostics system of the\nSuperFRS at future FAIR facility. The software was tested by analyzing five\nCERN standard GEM foils scanned with the optical scanning system. The\nmeasurement uncertainty of the diameter of the GEM holes and the pitch of the\nhole pattern was found to be 0.5 {\\mu}m and 0.3 {\\mu}m, respectively. The\nsoftware design and the performance are discussed. The correlation between the\nGEM hole size distribution and the corresponding gain variation was studied by\ncomparing them against a detailed gain mapping of a foil and a set of six lower\nprecision control measurements. It can be seen that a qualitative estimation of\nthe behavior of the local variation in gain across the GEM foil can be made\nbased on the measured sizes of the outer and inner holes.\n", "  If properly interpreted, the impact record of the Moon, Earth's nearest\nneighbour, can be used to gain insights into how the Earth has been influenced\nby impacting events since its formation ~4.5 billion years (Ga) ago. However,\nthe nature and timing of the lunar impactors - and indeed the lunar impact\nrecord itself - are not well understood. Of particular interest are the ages of\nlunar impact basins and what they tell us about the proposed \"lunar cataclysm\"\nand/or the late heavy bombardment (LHB), and how this impact episode may have\naffected early life on Earth or other planets. Investigations of the lunar\nimpactor population over time have been undertaken and include analyses of\norbital data and images; lunar, terrestrial, and other planetary sample data;\nand dynamical modelling. Here, the existing information regarding the nature of\nthe lunar impact record is reviewed and new interpretations are presented.\nImportantly, it is demonstrated that most evidence supports a prolonged lunar\n(and thus, terrestrial) bombardment from ~4.2 to 3.4 Ga and not a cataclysmic\nspike at ~3.9 Ga. Implications for the conditions required for the origin of\nlife are addressed.\n", "  Quantum information has been drawing a wealth of research in recent years,\nshedding light on questions at the heart of quantum mechanics, as well as\nadvancing fields such as complexity theory, cryptography, key distribution, and\nchemistry. These fundamental and applied aspects of quantum information rely on\na crucial issue: the ability to characterize a quantum state from measurements,\nthrough a process called Quantum State Tomography (QST). However, QST requires\na large number of measurements, each derived from a different physical\nobservable corresponding to a different experimental setup. Unfortunately,\nchanging the setup results in unwanted changes to the data, prolongs the\nmeasurement and impairs the assumptions that are always made about the\nstationarity of the noise. Here, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by\nperforming QST with a single observable. A single observable can often be\nrealized by a single setup, thus considerably reducing the experimental effort.\nIn general, measurements of a single observable do not hold enough information\nto recover the quantum state. We overcome this lack of information by relying\non concepts inspired by Compressed Sensing (CS), exploiting the fact that the\nsought state - in many applications of quantum information - is close to a pure\nstate (and thus has low rank). Additionally, we increase the system dimension\nby adding an ancilla that couples to information evolving in the system,\nthereby providing more measurements, enabling the recovery of the original\nquantum state from a single-observable measurements. We demonstrate our\napproach on multi-photon states by recovering structured quantum states from a\nsingle observable, in a single experimental setup. We further show how this\napproach can be used to recover quantum states without number-resolving\ndetectors.\n", "  A simple model to study boson stars is to consider these stellar objects as\nquantum systems of $N$ identical self-gravitating particles within a\nnon-relativistic framework. Some results obtained with point-like particles are\nrecalled as well as the validity limits of this model. Approximate analytical\ncalculations are performed using envelope theory for a truncated Coulomb-like\npotential simulating a particle size. If the boson mass is sufficiently small,\nthe description of small mass boson stars is possible within non-relativistic\nformalism. The mass and radius of these stellar objects are strongly dependent\non the value of the truncation parameter.\n", "  In this work, a coarse-grained (CG) model of carbon nanotube (CNT) reinforced\npolymer matrix composites is developed. A distinguishing feature of the CG\nmodel is the ability to capture interactions between polymer chains and\nnanotubes. The CG potentials for nanotubes and polymer chains are calibrated\nusing the strain energy conservation between CG models and full atomistic\nsystems. The applicability and efficiency of the CG model in predicting the\nelastic properties of CNT/polymer composites are evaluated through verification\nprocesses with molecular simulations. The simulation results reveal that the CG\nmodel is able to estimate the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites with\nhigh accuracy and low computational cost. The effect of the volume fraction of\nCNT reinforcements on the Young's modulus of the nanocomposites is\ninvestigated. The application of the method in the modeling of large unit cells\nwith randomly distributed CNT reinforcements is examined. The established CG\nmodel will enable the simulation of reinforced polymer matrix composites across\na wide range of length scales from nano to mesoscale.\n", "  Short-fiber-reinforced polymer composites are increasingly used in\nengineering applications and industrial products owing to their unique\ncombination of superior mechanical properties, and relatively easy and low cost\nmanufacturing process. The mechanical behavior of short carbon nanotube (CNT)\npolymer composites, however, remains poorly understood due to size and time\nlimitations of experiments and atomistic simulations. To address this issue,\nthe tensile fracture behavior of short CNT reinforced poly (methyl\nmethacrylate) (PMMA) matrix composites is investigated using a coarse-grained\n(CG) model. The reliability of the CG model is demonstrated by reproducing\nexperimental results on the stress-stain behavior of the polymer material. The\neffect of the nanotube weight fraction on the mechanical properties, i.e. the\nYoung's modulus, yield strength,tensile strength and critical strain, of the\nCNT/polymer composites is studied in detail. The dependence of the mechanical\nproperties of the composites on the orientation and length-to-diameter aspect\nratio of nanotube reinforcements is also examined.\n", "  In the present investigation, a strongly bonded strip of an\naluminium-magnesium based alloy AA5086 is successfully produced through\naccumulative roll bonding (ARB). A maximum of up to eight passes has been used\nfor the purpose. Microstructural characterization using electron backscatter\ndiffraction (EBSD) technique indicates the formation of submicron sized\n(~200-300 nm) subgrains inside the layered microstructure. The material is\nstrongly textured where individual layers possess typical FCC rolling texture\ncomponents. More than three times enhancement in 0.2% proof stress (PS) has\nbeen obtained after 8 passes due to grain refinement and strain hardening\n", "  We investigate the properties of static and axisymmetric vacuum solutions of\nEinstein equations which generalize the Schwarzschild spherically symmetric\nsolution to include a quadrupole parameter. We test all the solutions with\nrespect to elementary and asymptotic flatness and curvature regularity.\nAnalyzing their multipole structure, according to the relativistic invariant\nGeroch definition, we show that all of them are equivalent up to the level of\nthe quadrupole. We conclude that the $q-$metric, a variant of the\nZipoy-Voorhees metric, is the simplest generalization of the Schwarzschild\nmetric, containing a quadrupole parameter.\n", "  We present a new method for the analysis of electromagnetic scattering from\nhomogeneous penetrable bodies. Our approach is based on a reformulation of the\ngoverning Maxwell equations in terms of two uncoupled vector Helmholtz systems:\none for the electric feld and one for the magnetic field. This permits the\nderivation of resonance-free Fredholm equations of the second kind that are\nstable at all frequencies, insensitive to the genus of the scatterers, and\ninvertible for all passive materials including those with negative\npermittivities or permeabilities. We refer to these as decoupled field integral\nequations.\n", "  Resistively detected NMR (RDNMR) based on dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)\nin a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHF) is a highly-sensitive method for the\ndiscovery of fascinating quantum Hall phases; however, the mechanism of this\nDNP and in particular the role of quantum Hall edge states in it are unclear.\nHere we demonstrate the important but previously unrecognized effect of chiral\nedge modes on the nuclear spin polarization. A side-by-side comparison of the\nRDNMR signals from Hall bar and Corbino disk configurations allows us to\ndistinguish the contributions of bulk and edge states to DNP in QHF. The\nunidirectional current flow along chiral edge states makes the polarization\nrobust to thermal fluctuations at high temperatures and makes it possible to\nobserve a reciprocity principle of the RDNMR response. These findings help us\nbetter understand complex NMR responses in QHF, which has important\nimplications for the development of RDNMR techniques.\n", "  Treated traditionally by the Ehrenfest approximation, dynamics of a\none-dimensional molecular crystal model with off-diagonal exciton-phonon\ncoupling is investigated in this work using the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent\nvariational principle with the multi-D$_2$ {\\it Ansatz}. It is shown that the\nEhrenfest method is equivalent to our variational method with the single D$_2$\n{\\it Ansatz}, and with the multi-D$_2$ {\\it Ansatz}, the accuracy of our\nsimulated dynamics is significantly enhanced in comparison with the\nsemi-classical Ehrenfest dynamics. The multi-D$_2$ {\\it Ansatz} is able to\ncapture numerically accurate exciton momentum probability and help clarify the\nrelation between the exciton momentum redistribution and the exciton energy\nrelaxation. The results demonstrate that the exciton momentum distributions in\nthe steady state are determined by a combination of the transfer integral and\nthe off-diagonal coupling strength, independent of the excitonic initial\nconditions. We also probe the effect of the transfer integral and the\noff-diagonal coupling on exciton transport in both real and reciprocal space\nrepresentations. Finally, the variational method with importance sampling is\nemployed to investigate temperature effects on exciton transport using the\nmulti-$\\rm D_2$ {\\it Ansatz}, and it is demonstrated that the variational\napproach is valid in both low and high temperature regimes.\n", "  The interaction between noncolinear laser and relativistic electron beams in\nstatic magnetic undulator has been studied within the framework of dispersion\nequations. For a free-electron laser without inversion (FELWI), the threshold\nparameters are found. The large-amplification regime should be used to bring an\nFELWI above the threshold laser power.\n", "  In this paper, the partially party-time ($PT$) symmetric nonlocal\nDavey-Stewartson (DS) equations with respect to $x$ is called $x$-nonlocal DS\nequations, while a fully $PT$ symmetric nonlocal DSII equation is called\nnonlocal DSII equation. Three kinds of solutions, namely breather, rational and\nsemi-rational solutions for these nonlocal DS equations are derived by\nemploying the bilinear method. For the $x$-nonlocal DS equations, the usual\n($2+1$)-dimensional breathers are periodic in $x$ direction and localized in\n$y$ direction. Nonsingular rational solutions are lumps, and semi-rational\nsolutions are composed of lumps, breathers and periodic line waves. For the\nnonlocal DSII equation, line breathers are periodic in both $x$ and $y$\ndirections with parallels in profile, but localized in time. Nonsingular\nrational solutions are ($2+1$)-dimensional line rogue waves, which arise from a\nconstant background and disappear into the same constant background, and this\nprocess only lasts for a short period of time. Semi-rational solutions describe\ninteractions of line rogue waves and periodic line waves.\n", "  The pairing of composite fermions (CFs), electron-flux quasi-particles, is\ncommonly proposed to explain the even-denominator fractional quantum Hall state\nobserved at $\\nu=5/2$ in the first excited ($N=1$) Landau level (LL) of a\ntwo-dimensional electron system (2DES). While well-established to exist in the\nlowest ($N=0$) LL, much is unknown about CFs in the $N=1$ LL. Here we carry out\ngeometric resonance measurements to detect CFs at $\\nu=5/2$ by subjecting the\n2DES to a one-dimensional density modulation. Our data, taken at a temperature\nof 0.3 K, reveal no geometric resonances for CFs in the $N=1$ LL. In stark\ncontrast, we observe clear signatures of such resonances when $\\nu=5/2$ is\nplaced in the $N=0$ LL of the anti-symmetric subband by varying the 2DES width.\nThis finding implies that the CFs' mean-free-path is significantly smaller in\nthe $N=1$ LL compared to the $N=0$ LL. Our additional data as a function of\nin-plane magnetic field highlight the role of subband index and establish that\nCFs at $\\nu=5/2$ in the $N=0$ LL are more anisotropic in the symmetric subband\nthan in the anti-symmetric subband.\n", "  The existence of a spin-liquid ground state of the $s=1/2$ Heisenberg kagome\nantiferromagnet (KAFM) is well established. Meanwhile, also for the $s=1$\nHeisenberg KAFM evidence for the absence of magnetic long-range order (LRO) was\nfound. Magnetic LRO in Heisenberg KAFMs can emerge by increasing the spin\nquantum number $s$ to $s>1$ and for $s=1$ by an easy-plane anisotropy. In the\npresent paper we discuss the route to magnetic order in $s=1/2$ KAFMs by\nincluding an isotropic interlayer coupling (ILC) $J_\\perp$ as well as an\neasy-plane anisotropy in the kagome layers by using the coupled-cluster method\nto high orders of approximation. We consider ferro- as well as\nantiferromagnetic $J_\\perp$. To discuss the general question for the crossover\nfrom a purely two-dimensional (2D) to a quasi-2D and finally to a\nthree-dimensional system we consider the simplest model of stacked (unshifted)\nkagome layers. Although the ILC of real kagome compounds is often more\nsophisticated, such a geometry of the ILC can be relevant for barlowite. We\nfind that the spin-liquid ground state present for the strictly 2D $s=1/2$\n$XXZ$ KAFM survives a finite ILC, where the spin-liquid region shrinks\nmonotonously with increasing anisotropy. If the ILC becomes large enough (about\n15\\% of intralayer coupling for the isotropic Heisenberg case and about 4\\% for\nthe $XY$ limit) magnetic LRO can be established, where the $q=0$ symmetry is\nfavorable if $J_\\perp$ is of moderate strength. If the strength of the ILC\nfurther increases, $\\sqrt{3}\\times \\sqrt{3}$ LRO can become favorable against\n$q=0$ LRO.\n", "  Einstein's field equation of General Relativity (GR) has been known for over\n100 years, yet it remains challenging to solve analytically in strongly\nrelativistic regimes, particularly where there is a lack of a priori symmetry.\nNumerical Relativity (NR) - the evolution of the Einstein Equations using a\ncomputer - is now a relatively mature tool which enables such cases to be\nexplored. In this thesis, a description is given of the development and\napplication of a new Numerical Relativity code, GRChombo. GRChombo uses the\nstandard BSSN formalism, incorporating full adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and\nmassive parallelism via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The AMR capability\npermits the study of physics which has previously been computationally\ninfeasible in a full 3+1 setting. The functionality of the code is described,\nits performance characteristics are demonstrated, and it is shown that it can\nstably and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as black hole mergers. We\nuse GRChombo to study the effects of inhomogeneous initial conditions on the\nrobustness of small and large field inflationary models. and investigate the\ncritical behaviour which occurs in the collapse of both spherically symmetric\nand asymmetric scalar field bubbles.\n", "  DNA is an essential molecule central to the survival and propagation of life,\nit was imperative to investigate possible electromagnetic properties inherent\nto it, such as the existence of any non-trivial interactions of this molecule\nwith electromagnetic fields (beyond the usual dielectric response and damage by\nionizing gamma radiations). Extensive investigations were carried out with both\nprokaryotic and eukaryotic purified DNA samples utilizing some of the most\nsensitive and precision instrumentation and methods available, while scanning\nthe whole spectral region from 1Hz to 100KHz (in the low frequencies) and all\nthe way to the high-frequency region of 100MHz (including investigations on the\neffects of 100MHz high-frequency fields as well as 2.4GHz microwave fields on\nthe DNA). We were unable to detect any electromagnetism of any kind intrinsic\nto the DNA or its coupling to external noise sources, whether concentrated or\ndiluted in water, as compared to control samples (H2O or empty chambers),\nneither existence of any possible spontaneous or stimulated/induced\nelectromagnetic fields or waves emanated from both the eukaryotic and\nprokaryotic genetic material. Based on our measurements, we conclude that\neither there is no intrinsic electromagnetic activity or fields present in the\nDNA material, in both concentrated or diluted form, or any such activity is\nextremely weak in its intensity and beyond the measurement limits of current\nscientific methods.\n", "  Periodicity plays a significant role in the chaos theory from the beginning\nsince the skeleton of chaos can consist of infinitely many unstable periodic\nmotions. This is true for chaos in the sense of Devaney [1], Li-Yorke [2] and\nthe one obtained through period-doubling cascade [3]. Countable number of\nperiodic orbits exist in any neighborhood of a structurally stable Poincar\\'{e}\nhomoclinic orbit, which can be considered as a criterion for the presence of\ncomplex dynamics [4]-[6]. It was certified by Shilnikov [7] and Seifert [8]\nthat it is possible to replace periodic solutions by Poisson stable or almost\nperiodic motions in a chaotic attractor. Despite the fact that the idea of\nreplacing periodic solutions by other types of regular motions is attractive,\nvery few results have been obtained on the subject. The present study\ncontributes to the chaos theory in that direction.\n  In this paper, we take into account chaos both through a cascade of almost\nperiodic solutions and in the sense of Li-Yorke such that the original Li-Yorke\ndefinition is modified by replacing infinitely many periodic motions with\nalmost periodic ones, which are separated from the motions of the scrambled\nset. The theoretical results are valid for systems with arbitrary high\ndimensions. Formation of the chaos is exemplified by means of unidirectionally\ncoupled Duffing oscillators. The controllability of the extended chaos is\ndemonstrated numerically by means of the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke [9] control\ntechnique. In particular, the stabilization of tori is illustrated.\n", "  The annual modulation measured by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment can be explained\nby the interaction of dark matter WIMPs in NaI(Tl) scintillator detectors.\nOther experiments, with different targets or techniques, exclude the region of\nparameters singled out by DAMA/LIBRA, but the comparison of their results\nrelies on several hypotheses regarding the dark matter model. ANAIS-112 is a\ndark matter search with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators under commissioning\nat the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) to test the DAMA/LIBRA result in a\nmodel independent way. We analyze its prospects in terms of the a priori\ncritical and detection limits of the experiment. The analysis is based on the\ndetector response and the background level measured for the first modules\noperated in Canfranc.\n", "  A preconditioned, multipole-accelerated, Krylov-subspace iterative algorithm\nfor the electromagnetic scattering analysis of three dimensional (3D),\narbitrary shaped dielectric structures composed of single and multi-layered\ndielectric materials is presented. A surface integral equation (SIE)\nformulation using Maxwells equations and the equivalence principle which\nproduces a well-conditioned matrix equation is applied. The surface integral\nequation is discretized using the well-known Method of Moments (MoM) based on a\nGalerkin scheme. The dense matrix is solved efficiently via an iterative method\naccelerated by the Multilevel Fast Multipole Method (MLFMM) coupled with an\nincomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning technique. Compared to the proposed methods\nin the literature, proposed method is much simpler and efficient to implement\nfor layered dielectric structures. 3D numerical examples are presented to\ndemonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed approach.\n", "  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive substrate for catalytic\nreactions due to the high area density of reaction sites and the ability to\ntailor an array of material attributes. This study focuses on a thermally\nstable crystalline UiO-66(Zr) MOF structure and the modulation of the\nelectronic structure using two strategies to improve the catalytic conversion\nand selectivity of benzene alcohol to benzedehyate. Those two strategies\ninclude the functionalization of the organic struts with branched ligands and\nmanually creating structural defects with unsaturated organic linkers. A\ncombination of computational and experimental results provide evidence of\nimproved catalytic activity of MOFs via these two approaches. Functional groups\nattached to the main organic strut modify the electronic environment of the\nphotoactive aromatic carbon and thereby decrease the optical band gap by 1eV.\nWhereas the introduction of structural defects due to the organic linker\ndesaturation provided a shift in the HUMO as a result of the decrease in strut\ncoordination with the inorganic knots.\n", "  We present an analytical model to study the electronic properties, including\nfull band structure, low energy dispersions around the Dirac point and density\nof states of the ABC-stacking $N$-layer graphene (ABCNLG). An ABCNLG can be\nsimulated by a linear atomic chain with $2N$ atoms. With only nearest-neighbor\ninter- and intra-layer hopping integrals taken into account, the Hamiltonian\nrepresentation is a complex $2N \\times 2N$ tridiagonal matrix $H_0$. Through a\nunitary transformation, we can reduce the $2N \\times 2N$ Hamiltonian matrix\ninto two real $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrices $\\mathbb{H}_{s}$ and\n$\\mathbb{H}_{a}$, i. e., $H_0=\\mathbb{H}_{s} \\oplus \\mathbb{H}_{a} $. What's\nmore, the two matrices satisfy the relation $\\mathbb{H}_{a}=-\\mathbb{H}_{s}$.\nAs a result, energy spectrum associated with $\\mathbb{H}_{s}$ and\n$\\mathbb{H}_{s}$ have the relation $\\lambda_{a}=-\\lambda_{s}$. Such a\ncharacteristic is reflected on the energy dispersions and density of states.\nOur model can be applied to explore the basic properties of linear chain model\nand the eigenvalue problem of the tridiagonal matrices.\n", "  Theory of gravity is considered in the Regge-Teitelboim approach in which the\npseudo-Riemannian space is treated as a surface isometrically embedded in an\nambient Minkowski space of higher dimension. This approach is formulated in\nterms of a field theory in which the original pseudo-Rimannian space is defined\nby the field constant-value surfaces. The symmetry properties of the proposed\ntheory are investigated, and possible structure of the field-theoretical\nLagrangian is discussed.\n", "  To precisely measure radon concentrations in purified air supplied to the\nSuper-Kamiokande detector as a buffer gas, we have developed a highly sensitive\nradon detector with an intrinsic background as low as 0.33$\\pm$0.07\nmBq/m$^{3}$. In this article, we discuss the construction and calibration of\nthis detector as well as results of its application to the measurement and\nmonitoring of the buffer gas layer above Super-Kamiokande. In March 2013, the\nchilled activated charcoal system used to remove radon in the input buffer gas\nwas upgraded. After this improvement, a dramatic reduction in the radon\nconcentration of the supply gas down to 0.08 $\\pm$ 0.07 mBq/m$^{3}$.\nAdditionally, the Rn concentration of the in-situ buffer gas has been measured\n28.8$\\pm$1.7 mBq/m$^{3}$ using the new radon detector. Based on these\nmeasurements we have determined that the dominant source of Rn in the buffer\ngas arises from contamination from the Super-Kamiokande tank itself.\n", "  We have analyzed the transformation from initial coordinates $(v,r)$ of the\nVaidya metric with light coordinate $v$ to the most physical diagonal\ncoordinates $(t,r)$. An exact solution has been obtained for the corresponding\nmetric tensor in the case of a linear dependence of the mass function of the\nVaidya metric on light coordinate $v$. In the diagonal coordinates, a narrow\nregion (with a width proportional to the mass growth rate of a black hole) has\nbeen detected near the visibility horizon of the Vaidya accreting black hole,\nin which the metric differs qualitatively from the Schwarzschild metric and\ncannot be represented as a small perturbation. It has been shown that, in this\ncase, a single set of diagonal coordinates $(t,r)$ is insufficient to cover the\nentire range of initial coordinates $(v,r)$ outside the visibility horizon; at\nleast three sets of diagonal coordinates are required, the domains of which are\nseparated by singular surfaces on which the metric components have\nsingularities (either $g_{00}=0$ or $g_{00}=\\infty$.). The energy-momentum\ntensor diverges on these surfaces; however, the tidal forces turn out to be\nfinite, which follows from an analysis of the deviation equations for\ngeodesics. Therefore, these singular surfaces are exclusively coordinate\nsingularities that can be referred to as false firewalls because there are no\nphysical singularities on them. We have also considered the transformation from\nthe initial coordinates to other diagonal coordinates $(\\eta,y)$, in which the\nsolution is obtained in explicit form, and there is no energy-momentum tensor\ndivergence.\n", "  Following the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational principle, transient\ndynamics of a one-dimensional Holstein polaron with diagonal and off-diagonal\nexciton-phonon coupling in an external electric field is studied by employing\nthe multi-D$_2$ {\\it Ansatz}, also known as a superposition of the usual\nDavydov D$_2$ trial states. Resultant polaron dynamics has significantly\nenhanced accuracy, and is in perfect agreement with that derived from the\nhierarchy equations of motion method. Starting from an initial broad wave\npacket, the exciton undergoes typical Bloch oscillations. Adding weak\nexciton-phonon coupling leads to a broadened exciton wave packet and a reduced\ncurrent amplitude. Using a narrow wave packet as the initial state, the bare\nexciton oscillates in a symmetric breathing mode, but the symmetry is easily\nbroken by weak coupling to phonons, resulting in a non-zero exciton current.\nFor both scenarios, temporal periodicity is unchanged by exciton-phonon\ncoupling. In particular, at variance with the case of an infinite linear chain,\nno steady state is found in a finite-sized ring within the anti-adiabatic\nregime. For strong diagonal coupling, the multi-$\\rm D_2$ {\\it Anstaz} is found\nto be highly accurate, and the phonon confinement gives rise to exciton\nlocalization and decay of the Bloch oscillations.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the nonlocal discrete focusing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger (NLS) and nonlocal discrete defocusing NLS equation are gauge\nequivalent to the discrete coupled Heisenberg ferromagnet (HF) equation and the\ndiscrete modified coupled HF equation, respectively. Under the continuous\nlimit, the discrete coupled HF equation and the modified discrete coupled HF\nequation lead to the corresponding coupled HF equation and modified coupled HF\nequation. This means that the nonlocal focusing and defocusing NLS equations\nare gauge equivalent to the coupled HF and coupled modified HF equations. The\nsolution of the modified coupled HF equation is obtained by using the solution\nof nonlocal defocusing NLS equation.\n", "  Several deviations from the Standard Model predictions have been recently\nobserved in the decays mediated by $b \\rightarrow s l^+ l^-$ transitions. These\ncould be pointing towards new vector-current contributions or could be\nexplained by underestimated charm-loop effects. New results from an LHCb Run 1\n$B^+\\rightarrow K^+ \\mu^+ \\mu^- $ analysis that includes the decays via\nintermediate charm- resonances are discussed. Also, new results from the fully\nleptonic rare modes searches are presented. This includes the latest Run 1 and\nRun 2 $B^0_{(s)} \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ analysis from LHCb where the $B^0_{s}\n\\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ candidates are used to determine the effective\nlifetime of the $B^0_{s} \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decays - a pioneering result\nthat in the future will solve the current ambiguity in the (pseudo-)scalar\ncontributions.\n", "  To make research of chaos more friendly with discrete equations, we introduce\nthe concept of an unpredictable sequence as a specific unpredictable function\non the set of integers. It is convenient to be verified as a solution of a\ndiscrete equation. This is rigorously proved in this paper for quasilinear\nsystems, and we demonstrate the result numerically for linear systems in the\ncritical case with respect to the stability of the origin. The completed\nresearch contributes to the theory of chaos as well as to the theory of\ndiscrete equations, considering unpredictable solutions.\n", "  In this paper, We extend the two-component coupled Hirota equation to the\nthree-component one, and reconstruct the Lax pair with $4\\times4$ matrixes of\nthis three-component coupled system including higher-order effects such as\nthird-order dispersion, self-steepening and delayed nonlinear response.\nCombining the generalized Darboux transformation and a specific vector solution\nof this $4\\times4$ matrix spectral problem, we study higher-order localized\nnonlinear waves in this three-component coupled system. Then, the semi-rational\nand multi-parametric solutions of this system are derived in our paper. Owing\nto these more free parameters in the interactional solutions than those in\nsingle- and two-component Hirota equation, this three-component coupled system\nhas more abundant and fascinating localized nonlinear wave solutions\nstructures. Besides, in the first- and second-order localized waves, we get a\nvariety of new and appealing combinations among these three components $q_1,\nq_2$ and $q_3$. Instead of considering various arrangements of the three\npotential functions, we consider the same combination as the same type\nsolution. Moreover, the phenomenon that these nonlinear localized waves merge\nwith each other observably, may appears by increasing the absolute values of\ntwo free parameters $\\alpha, \\beta$. These results further uncover some\nstriking dynamic structures in multi-component coupled system.\n", "  This paper presents a new formal method for verification of quantum\ncommunication protocols. By extending the symbolic system of Petri nets, we can\ndefine quantum pure states in Petri-net settings. Therefore, it is possible to\nemerge a framework from formalizing basic quantum phenomena, which are utilized\nto achieve communication tasks. We also present an example of applying this\nframework to the modeling and analyzing quantum communication protocols to show\nhow it works.\n", "  According to recent observations relative number of flare stars does not\nchange very much from cool dwarfs to hot A stars. Flare energies are strongly\ncorrelated with stellar luminosity and radius. Whence it follows that the\ntypical magnetic field associated with a flare is several tens gauss and the\ntypical flare loop length-scales are parts of the stellar radius. Flares on\nO--B stars were not observed, but they are possible, since strong magnetic\nfields are detected on O--B stars. Therefore stars of O--M spectral classes are\npotential sources of cosmic rays. Energy estimates of a magnetic field strength\nin a tube in photospheres of O--M stars are performed. Basing on their values\npossible flare energies and numbers of accelerated protons are estimated. The\nvalues obtained for the Sun correspond to observations by order of magnitude\nthat justify estimates for other stars. Values of magnetic field strength in a\ntube differ less than five times for O and M flares (700 and 3500~G), but\ncorresponding flare energies and numbers of accelerated protons for O stars are\ngreater by five orders. Contrary fluencies of stellar protons appear to be five\norders less.\n", "  We propose a new method of detecting Ellis wormholes by use of the images of\nwormholes surrounded by optically thin dust. First, we derive steady solutions\nof dust and more general medium surrounding the wormhole by solving\nrelativistic Euler equations. We find two types of dust solutions: one is a\nstatic solution with arbitrary density profile, and the other is a solution of\ndust which passes into the wormhole and escapes into the other side with\nconstant velocity. Next, solving null geodesic equations and radiation transfer\nequations, we investigate the images of the wormhole surrounded by dust for the\nabove steady solutions. Because the wormhole spacetime possesses unstable\ncircular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in the image, just as in\nSchwarzschild spacetime. This indicates that the appearance of a bright ring\nsolely confirms neither a black hole nor a wormhole. However, we find that the\nintensity contrast between the inside and the outside of the ring are quite\ndifferent. Therefore, we could tell the difference between an Ellis wormhole\nand a black hole with high-resolution very-long-baseline-interferometry\nobservations in the near future.\n", "  Collective phenomena emerge from the interaction of natural or artificial\nunits with a complex organization. The interplay between structural patterns\nand dynamics might induce functional clusters that, in general, are different\nfrom topological ones. In biological systems, like the human brain, the overall\nfunctionality is often favored by the interplay between connectivity and\nsynchronization dynamics, with functional clusters that do not coincide with\nanatomical modules in most cases. In social, socio-technical and engineering\nsystems, the quest for consensus favors the emergence of clusters.\n  Despite the unquestionable evidence for mesoscale organization of many\ncomplex systems and the heterogeneity of their inter-connectivity, a way to\npredict and identify the emergence of functional modules in collective\nphenomena continues to elude us. Here, we propose an approach based on random\nwalk dynamics to define the diffusion distance between any pair of units in a\nnetworked system. Such a metric allows to exploit the underlying diffusion\ngeometry to provide a unifying framework for the intimate relationship between\nmetastable synchronization, consensus and random search dynamics in complex\nnetworks, pinpointing the functional mesoscale organization of synthetic and\nbiological systems.\n", "  Wavefront aberrations are identified as a major limitation in quantum\nsensors. They are today the main contribution in the uncertainty budget of best\ncold atom interferometers based on two-photon laser beam splitters, and\nconstitute an important limit for their long-term stability, impeding these\ninstruments from reaching their full potential. Moreover, they will also remain\na major obstacle in future experiments based on large momentum beam splitters.\nIn this article, we tackle this issue by using a deformable mirror to control\nactively the laser wavefronts in atom interferometry. In particular, we\ndemonstrate in an experimental proof of principle the efficient correction of\nwavefront aberrations in an atomic gravimeter.\n", "  Magnetic nanoparticles in a colloidal solution self-assemble in various\naligned structures, which has a profound influence on the flow behavior.\nHowever, the precise role of the microstructure in the development of the\nrheological response has not been reliably quantified. We investigate the\nself-assembly of dipolar colloids in simple shear using hybrid molecular\ndynamics and multi-particle collision dynamics simulations with explicit\ncoarse-grained hydrodynamics; conduct simulated rheometric studies and apply\nmicromechanical models to produce master curves, showing evidence of the\nuniversality of the structural behavior governed by the competition of the\nbonding (dipolar) and erosive (thermal and/or hydrodynamic) stresses. The\nsimulations display viscosity changes across several orders of magnitude in\nfair quantitative agreement with various literature sources, substantiating the\nuniversality of the approach, which seems to apply generally across vastly\ndifferent length scales and a broad range of physical systems.\n", "  As an extension of our previous work, which investigated the shadows of the\nEllis wormhole surrounded by nonrotating dust, in this paper we study wormhole\nshadows in rotating dust flow. First, we derive steady-state solutions of\nslowly rotating dust surrounding the wormhole by solving relativistic Euler\nequations. Solving null geodesic equations and radiation transfer equations, we\ninvestigate the images of the wormhole surrounded by dust for the above\nsteady-state solutions. Because the Ellis wormhole spacetime possesses unstable\ncircular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in the image, just as in\nSchwarzschild spacetime. The bright ring looks distorted due to rotation. Aside\nfrom the bright ring, there appear weakly luminous complex patterns by the\nemission from the other side of the throat. These structure could be detected\nby high-resolution very-long-baseline-interferometry observations in the near\nfuture.\n", "  We report the preliminary results of the azimuthal correlations between\n$D^{*\\pm}$ mesons and charged hadrons ($D^{*}$-h) measured by the STAR\nexperiment in proton+proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV. Results at\nmid-rapidity in the transverse-momentum range 8 $\\le$ $p^{D^{*}}_{T}$ $\\le$ 20\nGeV/$c$ are compared with light hadron triggered correlations (h-h) and PYTHIA\npredictions. We also present an exploratory study of azimuthal correlations\nbetween $D^{*+}$ and $D^{*-}$ mesons in p+p collisions. The prospects of\nmeasuring heavy-flavor triggered correlations in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC\nenergies are also discussed.\n", "  We present a theoretical model for understanding the kinetics of a long\npolymer in solution. A Smoluchowski-like equation has been used to model the\nproblem of polymer looping with a Dirac delta function sink of finite strength.\nThe results for rate constants have been obtained by using Green's function. In\nthis model, the rate constants for end-to-end looping of polymer exhibits\nsimple Arrhenius behavior. The rate constants are sensitive to relaxation time,\nbond length and chain length dependence of the looping probability. In\nparticular, for short term rate constant, relaxation time makes loop formation\nbetween two ends of a polymer chain slower but has a direct dependence with\nlong term rate constant. We also show that for shorter polymer strands looping\nis slower as compared to polymer having longer chain length. The long term rate\nconstant shows inverse square root dependence on the length of the chain. The\nbond length strongly affects the probability of loop formation as for long\nconstructs of polymer, the end-to-end distance is found to exhibit inverse\npower law relationship to bond length. We also observe that the short term rate\nconstant for flexible polymer shows stronger affinity for loop formation.\n", "  The low-temperature thermodynamic properties of the frustrated pyrochlore\nTb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ have been studied using the single crystal of\n$x=0.005$ sitting in a long range ordered phase in the $x$-$T$ phase diagram.\nWe observed that the specific heat exhibits a minimum around 2 K and slightly\nincreases on cooling, similar to a Schottky-like anomaly for canonical spin\nices. A clear specific-heat peak observed at $T_{\\rm c} = 0.53$ K is ascribable\nto the phase transition to a quadrupolar state, which contributes to a\nrelatively large change in entropy, $S \\simeq 2.7$ J K$^{-1}$mol$^{-1}$.\nHowever, it is still smaller than $R\\ln2$ for the ground state doublet of the\nTb ions. The entropy release persists to higher temperatures, suggesting strong\nfluctuations associated with spin ice correlations above $T_{\\rm c}$. We\ndiscuss the field dependence of the entropy change for $H||[111]$ and\n$H||[001]$.\n", "  Applying Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) to the geomagnetic data\nrecorded at three measuring stations in Japan, Rong et al. in 2012 reported\nthat anomalous magnetic field variations were identified well before the\noccurrence of the disastrous Tohoku $M_w$9.0 earthquake that occurred on 11\nMarch 2011 in Japan exhibiting increased \"non-uniform\" scaling behavior. Here,\nwe provide an explanation for the appearance of this increase of \"non-uniform\"\nscaling on the following grounds: These magnetic field variations are the ones\nthat accompany the electric field variations termed Seismic Electric Signals\n(SES) activity which have been repeatedly reported that precede major\nearthquakes. DFA as well as multifractal DFA reveal that the latter electric\nfield variations exhibit scaling behavior as shown by analyzing SES activities\nobserved before major earthquakes in Greece. Hence, when these variations are\nsuperimposed on a background of pseudosinusoidal trend, their long range\ncorrelation properties -quantified by DFA- are affected resulting in an\nincrease of the \"non-uniform\" scaling behavior. The same is expected to hold\nfor the former magnetic field variations.\n", "  Xu et al. [J. Asian Earth Sci. {\\bf 77}, 59-65 (2013)] It has just been\nreported that approximately 2 months prior to the $M_w$9.0 Tohoku earthquake\nthat occurred in Japan on 11 March 2011 anomalous variations of the geomagnetic\nfield have been observed in the vertical component at a measuring station about\n135 km from the epicenter for about 10 days (4 to 14 January 2011). Here, we\nshow that this observation is in striking agreement with independent recent\nresults obtained from natural time analysis of seismicity in Japan. In\nparticular, this analysis has revealed that an unprecedented minimum of the\norder parameter fluctuations of seismicity was observed around 5 January 2011,\nthus pointing to the initiation at that date of a strong precursory Seismic\nElectric Signals activity accompanied by the anomalous geomagnetic field\nvariations. Starting from this date, natural time analysis of the subsequent\nseismicity indicates that a strong mainshock was expected in a few days to one\nweek after 08:40 LT on 10 March 2011.\n", "  Probabilities enter quantum mechanics via Born's rule, the uniqueness of\nwhich was proven by Gleason. Busch subsequently relaxed the assumptions of this\nproof, expanding its domain of applicability in the process. Extending this\nwork to sequential measurement processes is the aim of this paper. Given only a\nsimple set of postulates, a probability measure is derived utilising the\nconcept of Liouville space and the most general permissible quantum channel\narises in the same manner. Super-Liouville space is constructed and a Bayesian\ninterpretation of this object is provided. An important application of the new\nmethod is demonstrated, providing an axiomatic derivation of important results\nof the BB84 protocol in quantum cryptography.\n", "  We report the electronic properties of the NdNiO3, prepared at the ambient\noxygen pressure condition. The metal-insulator transition temperature is\nobserved at 192 K, but the low temperature state is found to be less insulating\ncompared to the NdNiO3 prepared at high oxygen pressure. The electric\nresistivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity of the compound show\nlarge hysteresis below the metal-insulator transition. The large value of the\neffective mass (m* ~ 8me) in the metallic state indicate the narrow character\nof the 3d band. The electric conduction at low temperatures (T = 2 - 20 K) is\ngoverned by the variable range hopping of the charge carriers.\n", "  Current 3$\\nu$ global fits predict two degenerate solutions for\n$\\theta_{23}$: one lies in lower octant ($\\theta_{23} <\\pi/4$), and the other\nbelongs to higher octant ($\\theta_{23} >\\pi/4$). Here, we study how the\nmeasurement of $\\theta_{23}$ octant would be affected in the upcoming Deep\nUnderground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) if there exist a light eV-scale sterile\nneutrino. We show that in 3+1 scheme, a new interference term in $\\nu_\\mu \\to\n\\nu_e$ oscillation probability can spoil the chances of measuring $\\theta_{23}$\noctant completely.\n", "  The Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) captures the total integrated\nemission from stars and galaxies throughout the cosmic history. The amplitude\nof the near-infrared EBL from space absolute photometry observations has been\ncontroversial and depends strongly on the modeling and subtraction of the\nZodiacal light foreground. We report the first measurement of the diffuse\nbackground spectrum at 0.8-1.7 um from the CIBER experiment. The observations\nwere obtained with an absolute spectrometer over two flights in multiple sky\nfields to enable the subtraction of Zodiacal light, stars, terrestrial\nemission, and diffuse Galactic light. After subtracting foregrounds and\naccounting for systematic errors, we find the nominal EBL brightness, assuming\nthe Kelsall Zodiacal light model, is 42.7+11.9/-10.6 nW/m2/sr at 1.4 um. We\nalso analyzed the data using the Wright Zodiacal light model, which results in\na worse statistical fit to the data and an unphysical EBL, falling below the\nknown background light from galaxies at <1.3 um. Using a model-independent\nanalysis based on the minimum EBL brightness, we find an EBL brightness of\n28.7+5.1/-3.3 nW/m2/sr at 1.4 um. While the derived EBL amplitude strongly\ndepends on the Zodiacal light model, we find that we cannot fit the spectral\ndata to Zodiacal light, Galactic emission, and EBL from solely integrated\ngalactic light from galaxy counts. The results require a new diffuse component,\nsuch as an additional foreground or an excess EBL with a redder spectrum than\nthat of Zodiacal light.\n", "  We prove that any hyperbolic end with particles (cone singularities along\ninfinite curves of angles less than $\\pi$) admits a unique foliation by\nconstant Gauss curvature surfaces. Using a form of duality between hyperbolic\nends with particles and convex globally hyperbolic maximal (GHM) de Sitter\nspacetime with particles, it follows that any convex GHM de Sitter spacetime\nwith particles also admits a unique foliation by constant Gauss curvature\nsurfaces. We prove that the grafting map from the product of Teichm\\\"uller\nspace with the space of measured laminations to the space of complex projective\nstructures is a homeomorphism for surfaces with cone singularities of angles\nless than $\\pi$, as well as an analogue when grafting is replaced by \"smooth\ngrafting\".\n", "  The 2016 update of the discovery of nuclide project is presented. Only twelve\nnew nuclides were observed for the first time in 2016.

Following Yanagida's suggestion we demonstrate that no Higgs fields are\nneeded. Strong flavor gluon interactions themselves, treated in a separable\napproximation, result in universally split lepton and quark masses calculated\nin terms of a few parameters. While the realistic splitting of charged lepton\nand quark masses requires the electroweak and QCD radiative corrections the\nneutrino seesaw mass matrix comes out exact.\n", "  Digital signatures play an important role in software distribution, modern\ncommunication and financial transactions, where it is important to detect\nforgery and tampering. Signatures are a cryptographic technique for validating\nthe authenticity and integrity of messages, software, or digital documents. The\nsecurity of currently used classical schemes relies on computational\nassumptions. Quantum digital signatures (QDS), on the other hand, provide\ninformation-theoretic security based on the laws of quantum physics. Recent\nwork on QDS shows that such schemes do not require trusted quantum channels and\nare unconditionally secure against general coherent attacks. However, in\npractical QDS, just as in quantum key distribution (QKD), the detectors can be\nsubjected to side-channel attacks, which can make the actual implementations\ninsecure. Motivated by the idea of measurement-device-independent quantum key\ndistribution (MDI-QKD), we present a measurement-device-independent QDS\n(MDI-QDS) scheme, which is secure against all detector side-channel attacks.\nBased on the rapid development of practical MDI-QKD, our MDI-QDS protocol could\nalso be experimentally implemented, since it requires a similar experimental\nsetup.\n", "  Entanglement in multipartite systems can be achieved by the coherent\nsuperposition of product states, generated through a universal unitary\ntransformation, followed by spontaneous parametric down-conversions and path\nidentification.\n", "  We present a measurement of the cosmic-ray electron+positron spectrum between\n7 GeV and 2 TeV performed with almost seven years of data collected with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope. We find that the spectrum is well fit by a broken\npower law with a break energy at about 50 GeV. Above 50 GeV, the spectrum is\nwell described by a single power law with a spectral index of $3.07 \\pm 0.02 \\;\n(\\text{stat+syst}) \\pm 0.04 \\; (\\text{energy measurement})$.

To any\noriented long knot diagram of $K$, we associate a quadratic polynomial in\nvariables bijectively associated with the bridges of the diagram such that,\nwhen the variables projected to $\\mathbb{T}$ satisfy the linear equations\ncharacterizing the first homology group $H_1(\\tilde{X}_2)$ of the double cyclic\ncovering of $X$, the polynomial projects down to a well defined\n$\\mathbb{T}$-valued function on $T^1(\\tilde{X}_2,\\mathbb{T})$ (the dual of the\ntorsion part $T_1$ of $H_1$). This function is sensitive to knot chirality, for\nexample, it seems to confirm chirality of the knot $10_{71}$. It also\ndistinguishes the knots $7_4$ and $9_2$ known to have identical Alexander\npolynomials and the knots $9_2$ and K11n13 known to have identical Jones\npolynomials but does not distinguish $7_4$ and K11n13.\n", "  The objective of this thesis is to present a viable extension of general\nrelativity free from cosmological singularities. A viable cosmology, in this\nsense, is one that is free from ghosts, tachyons or exotic matter, while\nstaying true to the theoretical foundations of General Relativity such as\ngeneral covariance, as well as observed phenomenon such as the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe and inflationary behaviour at later times. To this\nend, an infinite derivative extension of relativity is introduced, with the\ngravitational action derived and the non-linear field equations calculated,\nbefore being linearised around both Minkowski space and de Sitter space. The\ntheory is then constrained so as to avoid ghosts and tachyons by appealing to\nthe modified propagator, which is also derived. Finally, the Raychaudhuri\nEquation is employed in order to describe the ghost-free, defocusing behaviour\naround both Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes, in the linearised regime.\n", "  We briefly present the spectroscopic evolution of the recent outburst of the\nclassical nova V1369 Cen, and the presence of a narrow absorption line\nidentified as due to the resonance of neutral lithium at 6708 \\AA.

The IO waves induced by the gravity are damped by electromagnetic (EM)\nwaves leads to the formation of LH waves. For higher wave vector, these LH wave\nresults in to the resonant absorption and re-emission of EM waves, called as\ngravity induced resonant emission (gire).

Herewith a structurally and electronically resembling 2D\nsheet, which can be regarded as Xene functionalized by covalent interactions\nwithin a 3D periodic structure, is predicted to constitute a 3D strong\ntopological insulator with Z2 = 1;(111) (primitive cell, rhombohedral setting)\nin the structural family of layered AXTe (A = Ga, In; X = Ge, Sn) bulk\nmaterials. The host structure GaGeTe is a long-known bulk semiconductor; the\n\"heavy\", isostructural analogues InSnTe and GaSnTe are predicted to be\ndynamically stable. Spin-orbit interaction in InSnTe opens a small topological\nband gap with inverted gap edges that are mainly composed of the In-5s and\nTe-5p states. Our simulations classify GaSnTe as a semimetal with topological\nproperties, whereas the verdict for GaGeTe is not conclusive and urges further\nexperimental verification. AXTe family structures can be regarded as stacks of\n2D layered cut-outs from a zincblende-type lattice and are composed by elements\nthat are broadly used in modern semiconductor devices; hence they represent an\naccessible, attractive alternative for applications in spintronics. The layered\nnature of AXTe should facilitate exfoliation of its hextuple layers and\nmanufacture of heterostuctures.\n", "  The electron neutron scattering process determines the electrical and thermal\nconductivity of neutron stars plasma. As we approach the resonance section of\nthe growth is much higher than the growth predicted by the perturbation theory.\nThe stated mathematical formalism is borrowed from the theory of light which is\nscattered on the excited system\n", "  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most violent explosions in the universe, seen\nprimarily as bright, short flashes of gamma-rays. Long GRBs are most likely\nassociated with the violent death of a very massive star. They are thus\nbelieved to originate within regions of recent or ongoing star formation with\nvarious bright, young stars, for instance, OB associations. GRBs have been\ndetected in gamma-rays by satellite-borne gamma-ray telescopes at MeV - GeV\nenergies, but could potentially also emit gamma-rays at even higher energies\n(Very-High-Energy [VHE] gamma-rays: E > 100 GeV), as observed by ground-based\nCherenkov Telescope facilities, such as the High Energy Stereoscopic System\n(H.E.S.S) in Namibia. VHE gamma-rays can be absorbed by low energy photons by\npair production, and the stars in the vicinity of a GRB provide a dense\nradiation environment, which could lead to such absorption. We have\ninvestigated representative GRB environments and provide an estimate of the\nopacity to gamma-gamma absorption for VHE gamma-rays from GRBs. We find that\nfor the likely properties of OB associations around GRB progenitors,\ngamma-gamma absorption is expected to be negligible.\n", "  This paper provides a general method for defining a generalized quantum\nobservable (or POVM) that supplies properly normalized conditional\nprobabilities for the time of occurrence (i.e., of detection). This method\ntreats the time of occurrence as a probabilistic variable whose value is to be\ndetermined by experiment and predicted by the Born rule. This avoids the\nproblematic assumption that a question about the time at which an event occurs\nmust be answered through instantaneous measurements of a projector by an\nobserver, common to both Rovelli (1998) and Oppenheim et al. (2000). I also\naddress the interpretation of experiments purporting to demonstrate the quantum\nZeno effect, used by Oppenheim et al. (2000) to justify an inherent uncertainty\nfor measurements of times.\n", "  A procedure of space proton-induced Soft Error Rate calculation based on\nheavy ion testing data is proposed. The approach relies on Geant4-assisted\nMonte Carlo simulation of the secondary particle LET spectra produced by proton\ninteractions.\n", "  These lecture notes were created for a graduate-level course on quantum\nsimulation taught at Leibniz University Hannover in 2013. The first part of the\ncourse discusses various state of the art methods for the numerical description\nof many-body quantum systems. In particular, I explain successful applications\nand inherent limitations due to the exponential complexity of the many-body\nproblem. In the second part of the course, I show how using highly controllable\nquantum system such as ultracold atoms will provide a way to overcome the\nlimitations of classical simulation methods. I discuss several theoretical and\nexperimental achievements and outline the road for future developments.\n", "  We report calculations of energy levels, radiative rates, collision\nstrengths, and effective collision strengths for transitions among the lowest\n25 levels of the n <= 5 configurations of He~II. The general-purpose\nrelativistic atomic structure package (GRASP) and Dirac atomic R-matrix code\n(DARC) are adopted for the calculations. Radiative rates, oscillator strengths,\nand line strengths are reported for all electric dipole (E1), magnetic dipole\n(M1), electric quadrupole (E2), and magnetic quadrupole (M2) transitions among\nthe 25 levels. Furthermore, collision strengths and effective collision\nstrengths are listed for all 300 transitions among the above 25 levels over a\nwide energy (temperature) range up to 9 Ryd (10**5.4 K). Comparisons are made\nwith earlier available results and the accuracy of the data is assessed.\n", "  We apply covert quantum communication based on entanglement generated from\nthe Minkowski vacuum to the setting of quantum computation and quantum\nnetworks. Our approach hides the generation and distribution of entanglement in\nquantum networks by taking advantage of relativistic quantum effects. We devise\na suite of covert quantum teleportation protocols that utilize the shared\nentanglement, local operations, and covert classical communication to transfer\nor process quantum information in stealth. As an application of our covert\nsuite, we construct two prominent examples of measurement-based quantum\ncomputation, namely the teleportation-based quantum computer and the one-way\nquantum computer. In the latter case we explore the covert generation of graph\nstates, and subsequently outline a protocol for the covert implementation of\nuniversal blind quantum computation.\n", "  In this paper, a reduced model of quasilinear diffusion by a small Larmor\nradius approximation is derived to couple the Maxwell's equations and the\nFokker-Planck equation self-consistently for ion cyclotron range of frequency\nwaves in a tokamak. The reduced model ensures the important properties of the\nfull model by Kennel-Engelmann diffusion, such as diffusion directions, wave\npolarizations, and H-theorem. The kinetic energy change (W-dot) is used to\nderive the reduced model diffusion coefficients for the fundamental damping and\nthe second harmonic damping to the lowest order of the finite Larmor radius\nexpansion. The quasilinear diffusion coefficients are implemented in a coupled\ncode (TORIC-CQL3D) with the equivalent reduced model of dielectric tensor. We\nalso present the simulations of the ITER minority heating scenario, in which\nthe reduced model is verified within the allowable errors from the full model\nresults.\n", "  To program a quantum annealer, one must construct objective functions whose\nminima encode hard constraints imposed by the underlying problem. For such\n\"penalty models,\" one desires the additional property that the gap in the\nobjective value between such minima and states that fail the constraints is\nmaximized amongst the allowable objective functions. In this short note, we\nprove the standard penalty model for the constraint that a bitstring has given\nHamming weight is optimal with respect to objective value gap.\n", "  Prior to macroscopic yielding, most materials undergo a regime of plastic\nactivity that cannot be resolved in conventional bulk deformation experiments.\nIn this pre-yield, or micro-plastic regime, it is the initial three dimensional\ndefect network that is probed and the intermittently evolving microstructure\nadmits small increments in plastic strain. By reducing the sample size, this\nintermittent activity becomes increasingly apparent and can be routinely\nobserved through small-scale mechanical testing. In some cases, the\nintermittent activity was shown to exhibit aspects of scale-free behavior,\nprompting a paradigm shift away from traditional microstructure-dependent unit\nmechanisms that may be associated with a well defined length and stress scale.\nIn this article, we discuss and review connections between classical\nmicro-plasticity and intermittent flow across all length scales, with the aim\nof highlighting the value of miniaturized testing as a means to unravel this\nvery early regime of bulk plasticity.\n", "  Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) is an alternative to the quantum\ncircuit model, whereby the computation proceeds via measurements on an\nentangled resource state. Noise processes are a major experimental challenge to\nthe construction of a quantum computer. Here, we investigate how noise\nprocesses affecting physical states affect the performed computation by\nconsidering MBQC on a one-dimensional cluster state. This allows us to break\ndown the computation in a sequence of building blocks and map physical errors\nto logical errors. Next, we extend the Matrix Product State construction to\nmixed states (which is known as Matrix Product Operators) and once again map\nthe effect of physical noise to logical noise acting within the correlation\nspace. This approach allows us to consider more general errors than the\nconventional Pauli errors, and could be used in order to simulate noisy quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  We construct regular rotating black hole and no-horizon spacetimes based on\nthe recently introduced spherically symmetric generic regular black hole\nspacetimes related to electric or magnetic charge under nonlinear\nelectrodynamics coupled to general relativity that for special values of the\nspacetime parameters reduce to the Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes. We show that\nthe weak and strong energy conditions are violated inside the Cauchy horizons\nof these generic rotating black holes. We give the boundary between the\nrotating black hole and no-horizon spacetimes and determine the black hole\nhorizons and the boundary of the ergosphere. We introduce the separated Carter\nequations for the geodesic motion in these rotating spacetimes. For the most\ninteresting new class of the regular spacetimes, corresponding for magnetic\ncharges to the Maxwell field in the weak field limit of the nonlinear\nelectrodynamics, we determine the structure of the circular geodesics and\ndiscuss their properties. We study the epicyclic motion of a neutral particle\nmoving along the stable circular orbits around the \"Maxwellian\" rotating\nregular black holes. We show that epicyclic frequencies measured by the distant\nobservers and related to the oscillatory motion of the neutral test particle\nalong the stable circular orbits around the rotating singular and regular\nMaxwellian black holes are always smaller than ones in the Kerr spacetime.\n", "  Several observations suggest the existence of super-massive black holes\n(SMBH) at the centers of giant galaxies. However the mechanism under which\nthese objects form remains non completely understood. In this work we review an\nalternative mechanism of formation of galactic SMBHs. This is, the collapse of\nultra-light scalar field configurations playing the role of dark matter halos.\nSeveral works have studied this scenario and investigated its plausibility. The\ntheory of collapse of scalar field configurations into compact objects has been\nextensively studied regarding to boson stars, in this work we extrapolate such\nresults for models of galactic halos hosting central SMBHs. We construct the\nsimplest setup of an ultra-light scalar field configuration laying in a\nSchwarzschild space-time for modeling a galactic system with a SMBH in the\nquasi-static limit. This model is applicable to systems either out of their\naccretion-phase at late times or either for those undergoing into a very slow\naccretion-phase, such as some early-type giant elliptic galaxies and bulges.\n  On the other hand, very recent direct observation of Sagittarius A by the\nEvent Horizon Telescope will open an era of explorations of the deep-inner\ngalactic region of the Milky Way that will enable us to test and distinguish\nvarious dark matter models. Thus we use our model to give a very first step\ntowards that direction. We derive the stellar kinematics induced by this sort\ndark matter to obtain information of the black hole's influence into the\nobservable features of the velocity field of visible matter deep inside the\ngalaxy. Thus we compute the radial velocity, acceleration and velocity\ndispersion densities for some realistic cases.\n", "  We report the temperature and magnetic field dependence of transport\nproperties in epitaxial films of the manganite La$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ in\nthe overdoped region of the phase diagram for $x > 0.5$, where a\ncharge--ordered (CO) and an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase are present.\nResistivity, magnetoresistance and angular dependence of magnetoresistance were\nmeasured in the temperature interval $4.2 ~\\mathrm{K} < T < 300 ~\\mathrm{K}$,\nfor three concentrations $x = 0.52, 0.58$ and $0.75$ and in magnetic fields up\nto 5 T. The semiconductor/insulator--like behavior in zero field was observed\nin the entire temperature range for all three concentrations \\textit{x} and the\nelectric conduction, at lower temperatures, in the CO state obeys 3D Mott's\nvariable--range hopping model. A huge negative magnetoresistance for $x = 0.52$\nand $x = 0.58$, a metal--insulator transition for $B > 3 ~\\mathrm{T}$ for $x =\n0.52$ and the presence of anisotropy in magnetoresistance for $x = 0.52$ and $x\n= 0.58$ show the fingerprints of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) behavior\nimplying the existence of ferromagnetic (FM) clusters. The declining influence\nof the FM clusters in the CO/AF part of the phase diagram with increasing $x$\ncontributes to a possible explanation that a phase coexistence is the origin of\nthe CMR phenomenon.\n", "  Density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function calculations\nhave been used to explore spin-resolved transport through the high-spin state\nof an iron(II)sulfur single molecular magnet. Our results show that this\nmolecule exhibits near-perfect spin filtering, where the spin-filtering\nefficiency is above 99%, as well as significant negative differential\nresistance centered at a low bias voltage. The rise in the spin-up conductivity\nup to the bias voltage of 0.4 V is dominated by a conductive lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbital, and this is accompanied by a slight increase in the magnetic\nmoment of the Fe atom. The subsequent drop in the spin-up conductivity is\nbecause the conductive channel moves to the highest occupied molecular orbital\nwhich has a lower conductance contribution. This is accompanied by a drop in\nthe magnetic moment of the Fe atom. These two exceptional properties, and the\nfact that the onset of negative differential resistance occurs at low bias\nvoltage, suggests the potential of the molecule in nanoelectronic and\nnanospintronic applications.\n", "  In this expository note, we discuss spatially inhomogeneous quantum walks in\none dimension and describe a genre of mathematical methods that enables one to\ntranslate information about the time-independent eigenvalue equation for the\nunitary generator into dynamical estimates for the corresponding quantum walk.\nTo illustrate the general methods, we show how to apply them to a 1D coined\nquantum walk whose coins are distributed according to an element of the\nThue--Morse subshift.\n", "  Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the only extraterrestrial body known to\nsupport stable liquid on its surface, in the form of seas and lakes that dot\nthe polar regions. Many indications suggest that the liquid should be composed\nof a mixture of N2, CH4 and C2H6. Recent RADAR observations of Titan's large\nsea, called ``Ligeia Mare'', have shown unexplained and ephemeral bright\nfeatures, possibly due to rising bubbles. Here we report that our numerical\nmodel, when combined with experimental data found in the literature, shows that\nLigeia Mare's bed is a favourable place for nitrogen exsolution. This process\ncould produce centimeter-sized and radar-detectable bubbles.\n"]}
